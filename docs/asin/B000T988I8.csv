This film had terrible marketing, the trailer made me believe this was a comedy but this film is not, Georgia Rule deals with serious and adult subject matter, I won't give it away but I highly recommend this movie 100%. It seems like every Garry Marshall film is absolutely engaging and heartwarming like Beaches, Raising Helen, Pretty Woman, and The Other Sister. Marshall is probably my second favorite director behind James Mangold (Walk the Line, Identity, Girl, Interrupted.) One of the things that surprised me is Lindsay Lohan's perfomance, she blew me away and in her previous films, I felt her acting was wooden and lacked originality but as the rebellious and hard to love Rachel, she nails it and you feel her pain and frustration towards everyone she encounters.  Felicity Huffman and Jane Fonda are excellent as always. Every performance is top-notch including Dermont Mulroney who is way too under-rated even to this day. So with that being said, Georgia Rule was the one film I felt that deserved so much more appreciation.

1088632,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B000T988I8,AIROLF,"[4, 4]","Georgia Rule as a romantic comedy is a very tough sell. The movie starts with quite a lot of humour but turns dark fairly quickly. As a dramedy, this movie takes on more than it can chew for a Mother's Day release.The central theme of the movie, that of the love-hate pattern in the mother-daughter relationships, is inconsistent throughout the film. Nevertheless, the movie somehow works. It's not overbearingly a tearjerker, although a definitely chick film (at the film screening I went to, 98% of the audience were women in the middle age demographic).Similarly to what she did in Bobby, Lindsay Lohan outshines everyone in the cast, including Jane Fonda (Fun with Dick and Jane, Klute) and Felicity Hoffman (Desperate Housewives, Transamerica), who play her grandmother and mother, respectively. Her reported nonchalantant and disruptive attitude on the set coincides with her character's. The wardrobe seems to be Lohan's as well; she is often spotted off screen in similar outfits. She looks remarkably good in skinny jeans, generally a hard feat too pull off, rivaled only by Kate Moss.The weakness of the movie stems from needing to justify such attitudes and from trying to be at several places at once. As mentioned before, the movie looses its central focus, while it explores its darker side and attempts to make commentary on everything from alcoholism to Mormonism to small town living to premarital sex.Overall, this movie is a nice retreat from the summer popcorn fare.

Kote ""poison ivy""","[2, 2]","Georgia Rule is one of the most painfully underappreciated movies of 2007, if not arguably the decade.Having the misfortune to be released in a time when Lindsay Lohan's personal life began to overshadow her work, Georgia Rule suffered, with critics and the general public beginning to disdain Lohan, and setting forth biases that should have - but weren't - set aside when it came to her films. The misleading promotion didn't help matters either, and thus, Georgia Rule went on to become a Razzie nominee and a box office failure.Georgia Rule is actually a fantastic family drama. Made by the director of Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries, Georgia Rule is a powerful drama dealing with family relationships, child abuse, alcoholism, and estrangement. Sounds like a lot to take in from a film made by the same man who directed Kate Hudson's light comedy Raising Helen, but Georgia Rule works on a lot of levels. Often times a tearjerker, Georgia Rule still manages to be funny and an an enjoyable picture. The subjects it tackles are dark, but the film is light - and that's actually a positive here. Georgia Rule is like a chick flick, but with a strong script.Led by three generations of top actresses - the legendary Jane Fonda, Desperate Housewives star and Oscar nominee Felicity Huffman, and the Mean Girls star Lindsay Lohan - the film excels in it's acting. Lohan actually delivers one of the best performances of her career, what once she described before release as being work she was genuinely proud of. Fonda shines as the title character Georgia, and Felicity, as usual, delivers a knockout performance as Rachel's (Lohan) mother.My only hope for this film is that it gets the recognition it deserves.

I had a ton of OTHER movies I could have been watching, but for some reason I decided that I wanted to watch something made in my lifetime, so I opted for this mess.How does that Cher song go?  ""If I could turn back time.""  Yeah, something like that.Fonda, Lohan and Huffman fumble their way through this clich&eacute;d mess of a ridiculous film that does nothing new, and provides us with no redeemable moments.  The acting is atrocious by almost all parties outside of Dermot Mulroney, which is remarkable beings that I find him almost always flat and uninteresting.  Cary Elwes has a certain `creepy' charisma, but his character is completely wasted on this dreadful script.The film follows wild child Rachel as she is dumped at the doorstep of her grandmother Georgia by her self consumed mother, Lilly.  Lilly is hoping that Georgia's idea of tough love (something Lilly resents herself) is going to whip Rachel into shape.  It is apparent that Lilly doesn't believe in her mother's methods and so it is obvious that Lilly is not doing this for Rachel, she is doing this because she doesn't want to deal with it herself.  She is selfish.  Rachel quickly makes an impact on the community by dressing provocatively and throwing herself at anything with three legs (if you get my hint) and once allegations of abuse start flying, Georgia is calling Lilly and Lilly is calling Rachel and everyone is lying and defending and backpedaling and just making a total mockery of our intelligence.This movie makes you feel stupid.It also doesn't help that it feels like an after-school special.The film is far from believable, which is sad because it almost makes fun of a very serious situation (child abuse is no joke).  Lohan's clich&eacute;d and nearly comical antics are just forced and ridiculous to witness.  Huffman's character is a monster, a total creep of a woman who turns the viewer off almost immediately.  In fact, even her `good' act in the films end seems like a sacrifice.  I've made it clear before, I'm not really a fan of Fonda, but I admit that I have been tantalized by her antics before.  This is not one of those times.  She is awful here.That is the word that should describe this movie; awful.Portraying the community as simpletons who obsess about god was insulting.  Portraying an abuse victim the way Lohan did was also insulting.  Expecting us to side with ANY of these people, let alone CARE if things work out in the end, was just stupid.

Vegan,"[6, 8]","Unless someone has told you about this movie, I can pretty much guarantee that you will be in for a surprise when you find out what this movie is about.  This movie isn't a light-hearted comedy with a moral at the end. It doesn't teach lessons about life.  This movie is a dark tale with some bit of comedy and romance.  As it is, Georgia Rule is a fairly hard-hitting family drama, and I thought it did a great job of showing both the flaws and strengths of three generations of women: Rachel (Lindsay Lohan, who is absolutely great, aside from the semi-valid criticism that she is basically playing herself), a bratty California sex-pot who's been hiding a traumatic secret in the interest of her mother's happiness; Lilly (Felicity Huffman, consistently strong), who clearly loves her daughter despite her struggles with alcoholism and guilt over her role in her daughter's troubles; and the eponymous Georgia (Jane Fonda, fantastic), a somewhat self-centered disciplinarian who honestly takes the interests of her family at heart.I think a lot of the poor reviews for this film are based on the fact that it simply is not a comedy (which I understand is how it was advertised).

Well, it's just a solid story about a young teenage woman trying to find her way in life, and deal with all the frustrations and difficulties of moving forward.  That's what I got out of it anyway.  Life can be hard sometimes, and during those hard times, we have to deal with the things life throws at us, no matter how crappy or difficult it is for us to deal with it.  Leaving the past behind is an important lesson, and the storyline in this movie will show you that.Now, the main part of the storyline in the film is whether the teenage girl is being honest when she claims some horrible things happened to her in the past.  It's up to us to figure out whether there's any truth to those claims.  This film seriously deserves a lot of credit for not only telling a great story, but showing us how important it is to be honest with our feelings, or we may never know what honesty is TRULY like.I really don't think what our opinion on Lindsay Lohan might be should have *anything* to do with her magnificent performance in the movie.  This is my first experience seeing her on film, and I was moved.  She's a lot better than many people give her credit for.

I found this to be a great mother/daughter/generational movie in which a angst ridden teen travels to a small town to live with her Grandmother and finds herself. There were a few looseends at the end however with Dermot and Felicity's characters and what actually happens between them. That I thought should have played out somehow which it didn't and I found that dissapointing. Lohan's love interest was adorable as Harlan and they were a cute match. I think Lohan is an incredible actress and I can't wait to see her again in another film because she has the makings of an Academy Award Winner if she gets her act together. Jane Fonda did a great job too and it was nice seeing her in a movie again. She definately wasn't the evil character she was made out to be in the beginning but thats expected.The plot kept you guessing about what truly happened between Lohan and her step-father but I think deep down the audience knows the truth from her actions.

Harmon ""animal lover""","[10, 11]","Though I don't recall this movie getting great reviews from the critics, I expected at least a decent movie considering the three main stars.  I got more than expected.  The three lead actresses were well chosen.  Jane Fonda, looking exceptionally well at age 70, is outstanding as the grandmother, Georgia, who lives her life by certain 'rules,' hence the title, and who has a history with her daughter, Lilly, (Felicity Huffman), that seems lacking in emotion.  'Seems' is the operative word.  While we aren't exactly privy to what has caused this rift between mother and daughter, we glean from one particular scene that Georgia's parents never told HER that they loved her.  We gather that Georgia's apparent inability to say the three words, ""I love you"" to her daughter may simply be because she was not told what she needed to hear from her parents.  In one touching scene between Georgia and Lilly, when Lilly asks her mother if she ever loved her, Georgia replies, 'How could I not love you?'  She still is not able to say those three magic words to her daughter though she has no trouble saying them to her granddaughter, Rachel, (Lindsay Lohan). Dermont Mulroney is wonderfully cast as the  kindly veterinarian whom Rachel works for and Cary Elwes well cast in a somewhat chilling performance as Rachel's stepfather.Rachel lies, manipulates, has a history of drug abuse and all manner of teen problems.  There is, of course, a reason for her behaviour and underneath it all, we see many glimpses of a tender heart.This is Ms. Lohan's best performance since she made her wonderful debut as identical twins in 'The Parent Trap' at the age of eleven.  Despite the two other big name stars, Lindsay Lohan is THE star of this movie.  We can only hope that this gifted young lady is able to heal herself before a very promising career is ruined.",4,How do we know we're loved?  4 1/2 stars,1189468800,"09 11, 2007",2007,1850,"['do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'movie', 'getting', 'great', 'reviews', 'critics', 'expected', 'least', 'decent', 'movie', 'considering', 'three', 'main', 'stars', 'got', 'more', 'expected', 'three', 'lead', 'actresses', 'were', 'well', 'chosen', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'looking', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'age', '70', 'outstanding', 'grandmother', 'Georgia', 'who', 'life', 'certain', ""'rules"", 'hence', 'title', 'who', 'history', 'daughter', 'Lilly', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'lacking', 'emotion', 'operative', 'word', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'privy', 'what', 'caused', 'rift', 'mother', 'daughter', 'glean', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'Georgia', 'parents', 'never', 'told', 'loved', 'gather', 'Georgia', 'apparent', 'inability', 'say', 'three', 'words', 'love', 'daughter', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'was', 'not', 'told', 'what', 'needed', 'hear', 'parents', 'one', 'touching', 'scene', 'Georgia', 'Lilly', 'when', 'Lilly', 'mother', 'ever', 'loved', 'Georgia', 'replies', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'still', 'not', 'able', 'say', 'three', 'magic', 'words', 'daughter', 'trouble', 'saying', 'granddaughter', 'Rachel', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Dermont', 'Mulroney', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'kindly', 'veterinarian', 'whom', 'Rachel', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'well', 'cast', 'somewhat', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Rachel', 'stepfather.Rachel', 'manipulates', 'history', 'drug', 'abuse', 'manner', 'teen', 'problems', 'course', 'reason', 'behaviour', 'underneath', 'see', 'many', 'glimpses', 'tender', 'heart.This', 'Ms.', 'Lohan', 'best', 'performance', 'made', 'wonderful', 'debut', 'identical', 'twins', ""'The"", 'Parent', 'Trap', 'age', 'eleven', 'two', 'other', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'THE', 'star', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'gifted', 'young', 'lady', 'able', 'heal', 'very', 'promising', 'career', 'ruined']",N/A

Her performance, as a promiscuous, damaged teenager, is fine. And her seasoned co-stars, Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Dermot Mulroney, are all excellent in their respective roles.What spoils the film is that it's just hopelessly uneven. It constantly shifts in tone from breezy comedy to melodrama. Most of the blame should probably be assigned to director Gary Marshall, who has made similar errors with films before (like ""Exit to Eden"", which couldn't decide if it was a goofy comedy or an erotic romance).The shifts in tone make it almost impossible for the viewer to really sympathize with the characters. During the comedic scenes, all three generations of women (Fonda's ""Georgia"", Huffman's ""Lili"" and Lohan's ""Rachel"") draw laughs for their harsh bravado, which, although amusing, is never likable.

1088648,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000T988I8,Ed Uyeshima,"[6, 8]","I am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy. Attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid betweenOn Golden PondandThe Prince of Tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. The main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between Garry Marshall's sentimental direction and Mark Andrus' dark, rather confusing screenplay. The story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have driven all the way from San Francisco to small-town Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under Georgia's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion.The set-up is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. It veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. The three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. Probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker's voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachel's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. Felicity Huffman is forced to play Lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter's state of mind. She does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being.At close to seventy, Jane Fonda looks great, even as weather-beaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty Georgia. The problem I have with Fonda's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares. Between this and 2005's execrableMonster-in-Law, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. It should come as no surprise that the actresses' male counterparts are completely overshadowed. Garrett Hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the nave Harlan, a devout Mormon whose sudden love for Rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint. Cary Elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as Lilly's husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie's ending.There is also the omnipresent Dermot Mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower, Lilly's former flame and Rachel's new boss as town veterinarian Dr. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf has a barely-there role as Simon's sister Paula, while Marshall regular Hector Elizondo and songsmith Paul Williams show up in cameos. Some of Andrus' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. There are several small extras with the 2007 DVD, none all too exciting. Marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. There are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. A seven-minute making-of featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to Marshall.",2,Georgia May Rule...But This Movie Sure Doesn't,1189296000,"09 9, 2007",2007,3600,"['am', 'uncertain', 'what', 'make', 'misshapen', '2007', 'dramedy', 'Attempting', 'be', 'new', 'millennium', 'cross-hybrid', 'betweenOn', 'Golden', 'PondandThe', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'erratic', 'mess', 'shifting', 'so', 'mercurially', 'comedy', 'melodrama', 'emotional', 'pitch', 'always', 'off', 'main', 'problem', 'be', 'irreconcilable', 'difference', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'sentimental', 'direction', 'Mark', 'Andrus', 'dark', 'rather', 'confusing', 'screenplay', 'story', 'unraveling', 'relationship', 'mother', 'Lilly', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'who', 'have', 'driven', 'way', 'San', 'Francisco', 'small-town', 'Hull', 'Idaho', 'where', 'grandmother', 'Georgia', 'idea', 'Lilly', 'leave', 'Rachel', 'summer', 'Georgia', 'taskmaster', 'jurisdiction', 'replete', 'draconian', 'rules', 'young', '17-year', 'old', 'become', 'incorrigible', 'hellion.The', 'set-up', 'clear', 'enough', 'characters', 'are', 'made', 'shift', 'quickly', 'often', 'inexplicably', 'sympathetic', 'shrill', 'fit', 'contrived', 'contours', 'storyline', 'haphazardly', 'issues', 'alcoholism', 'child', 'molestation', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'pat', 'resolution', 'three', 'actresses', 'center', 'redeem', 'dramatic', 'convolutions', 'varying', 'degrees', 'Probably', 'due', 'off-screen', 'reputation', 'scratchy', 'smoker', 'voice', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'Rachel', 'promiscuity', 'manipulative', 'tactics', 'palpable', 'less', 'credible', 'character', 'psychological', 'wounds', 'give', 'reason', 'hedonistic', 'behavior', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'forced', 'play', 'Lilly', 'two', 'strident', 'notes', 'petulant', 'resentful', 'daughter', 'mother', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'close', 'angry', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'who', 'recognize', 'own', 'accountability', 'daughter', 'state', 'mind', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'fronts', 'efforts', 'never', 'add', 'up', 'flesh-and-blood', 'human', 'being.At', 'close', 'seventy', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'great', 'even', 'as', 'weather-beaten', 'here', 'star', 'presence', 'get', 'away', 'cartoon-like', 'dimensions', 'flinty', 'Georgia', 'problem', 'have', 'Fonda', 'casting', 'legendary', 'actress', 'far', 'more', 'series', 'one-liners', 'maternal', 'stares', 'Between', '2005', 'execrableMonster-in-Law', 'make', 'one', 'wonder', 'best', 'work', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'actresses', 'male', 'counterparts', 'are', 'completely', 'overshadowed', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'little', 'too', 'surfer-dude', 'nave', 'Harlan', 'devout', 'Mormon', 'sudden', 'love', 'Rachel', 'could', 'delay', 'two-year', 'missionary', 'stint', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'plays', 'familiar', 'suspicious', 'note', 'Lilly', 'husband', 'unfortunate', 'case', 'where', 'predictable', 'casting', 'telegraph', 'movie', 'ending.There', 'also', 'omnipresent', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'morose', 'triple-play', 'role', 'wounded', 'widower', 'Lilly', 'former', 'flame', 'Rachel', 'new', 'boss', 'town', 'veterinarian', 'Dr.', 'Simon', 'Ward', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'barely-there', 'role', 'Simon', 'sister', 'Paula', 'Marshall', 'regular', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'songsmith', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'show', 'up', 'cameos', 'Andrus', 'dialogue', 'plain', 'awful', 'wavering', 'seriocomic', 'tone', 'never', 'anything', 'feels', 'right', 'are', 'several', 'small', 'extras', '2007', 'DVD', 'none', 'too', 'exciting', 'Marshall', 'commentary', 'track', 'plenty', 'trademark', 'laconic', 'humor', 'are', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'three', 'variations', 'ending', 'gag', 'reel', 'seven-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'six-minute', 'short', 'spotlighting', 'three', 'actresses', 'five-minute', 'tribute', 'Marshall']",N/A

1088654,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000T988I8,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Garry Marshall is highly regarded for his style in pulling of sophisticated comedies ('Pretty Woman', 'The Other Sister', 'Beaches', 'Frankie and Johnny' etc) and for this film he selected a script by an equally respected writer, Mark Andrus ('As Good as it Gets', Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood', 'Life as a House').  To add to this assured formula he managed to cast some fine actors, and so the audience is left wondering 'What happened?'Most people would judge the cover of this DVD to represent a full-blooded comedy.  But that is the first blunder.  What happens in this film is the examination of a severely dysfunctional family of women: Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is an oversexed 17 year old tyrant whose alcoholic mother Lilly (Felicity Huffman) can no longer tolerate and ships her miscreant daughter off to the 'hell world' of Lilly's distant controlling mother Georgia (Jane Fonda) to shape Rachel up for college.  Georgia of the many rules and rigid lifestyle lives in Idaho and Rachel arrives and immediately plies her bad personality on the folks of the little town, including seducing a soon-to-be Mormon evangelist Harlan (Garrett Hedlund) and shocking the little boys who are cared for by Georgia. Georgia gets Rachel a job as an office girl for Dr. Ward (Dermot Mulroney) who is an ex-lover of Lilly but a role model for the town since his wife and son's accidental death. Rachel decides to get back at her mother and her stepfather Arnold (Cary Elwes) by explaining her misbehavior to Simon: her stepfather sexually abused her from age 12 to 14. In an attempt to help Rachel's family heal, Simon informs Georgia who informs Lilly about the abuse and Lilly responds by leaving Arnold to return to Idaho, cut her hair, and give in to drinking wholeheartedly. Was Lilly's confession true or fabricated? This question serves as the climax that brings about changes in everyone.  The point is dulled by the fact that we never really care about any of these involved characters, so shallow is the writing that could have salvaged a story by fleshing out potentially interesting characters.The cast is so good that they give it their all to try to save this sinking ship of a film.  We want to praise Fonda and Huffman but their roles simply don't allow the actors to go very far.  Marshall has worked with many of these actors before (even Hector Elizondo is given a very tiny part!) but this time the cake doesn't rise.  Worth viewing for the opportunity to see some very good actors given a few moments of valid screen time.

1088656,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B000T988I8,Gregor von Kallahann,"[22, 26]","Viewing GEORGIA RULE recently I flashed back on a passage from Salinger's FRANNY AND ZOOEY (which I had recently re-read). There is a passage in that book in which a young television actor, speaks disparagingly of scripts that are ""courageous,"" without their necessarily being particularly good. What he's talking about, of course, is the kind of drama that is supposed to be risky and challenging, a bit off beat maybe. ""Edgy"" might be the current word. That's precisely the kind of dramatic work GEORGIA RULE tries to be. You can just imagine the filmmakers patting themselves (and each other) on the back, congratulating themselves on their frankness and daring.This is a movie that wants to say SO MUCH--to bravely go where no screenwriter (or director OR producer) would have dared to go before (except that they HAVE, in point of fact). You've got your intergenerational conflict, your intergenerational substance abuse, you've got promiscuous teens--and apparently incestuous step-dads. You've got salty grandmas, agonized moms and troubled, but spunky teens. Now even if you haven't seen all these ingredients mixed up before, it's hard not to find GEORGIA RULE a bit contrived and quite desperate. It nearly breaks under the strain.The reviews for this film have not been kind, and it seems likely that whatever notoriety it may have garnered may have more to do with Lindsay Lohan's reported bad behavior on the set than with the film's inherent quality. As it turns out, she probably could have just pleaded ""Method"" and claimed that she was just staying in character off-camera. Her Rachel is a bit of a wastrel. With a heart of gold, of course.This is a film that virtually invites reviewers to say something cranky about a stellar cast adrift in a lame production. Well, it IS a pretty solid cast, and all the actors have their moments. Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan have some very strong scenes--and others where the script or their director (or their own best instincts) let them down. Jane Fonda is probably the most consistent of the three starring actresses, but that may have much to do with her character's flinty, discipline-for-discipline's sake nature. She can coast a bit on her character's quirks. Huffman and Lohan are required to take more risks. Sometimes they take off, and sometimes they fall flat (quite literally in Huffman's case).GEORGIA RULE, while not especially good, could prove instructive to aspiring actors. It's true you get to see good actors at work (and I mean, HARD at work). What you don't get is a good, solid story. In 2007, simply presenting viewers with intergenerational dysfunctionality doesn't cut it anymore--if it ever did. Yes, we know that happy families are all alike, and that unhappy families are unhappy in uniquely different ways. If that's true, however, you shouldn't have to struggle so much to show those differences.

The script also gives Georgia babysitting duties so she can hang out with two little boys rather like the boy in ON GOLDEN POND, except doubled of course, two of them instead of the one from the 1979 Oscar winner.  I thoroughly enjoyed this journey into the past, and I hope that the critical drubbing GEORGIA RULE got won't prevent Jane from once again retiring from the screen.  We need her there, maybe just not in this part.  She was excellent, but the script had her in the movie more than she needed to be, I suppose to give fairly even weight to all three of its big name actresses.Felicity Huffman, whom I don't like in general, impressed me with her turn as the alcoholic mother clinging to a loser husband (Cary Elwes) in order to live in expensive, glittering San Francisco.  She has one scene that took my breath away, when she gets some shocking news and tries to descend a staircase, she lifts a foot and misses the step entirely, in a brave, physical gesture that convinced me she was totally inside her character's mind.Perhaps due to the off camera antics of Lindsay Lohan, the movie is noticeably choppy and doesn't make sense from scene to scene.  One has the feeling that big parts of the script were either not filmed or cut.  Why for example does Georgia send Rachel to live with Simon--the vet slash doctor--and not act like it's strange for a young teen to be living with a middle aged man she has just met last week?  I didn't get it, and sure enough, before you can say, Samantha Ronson, there's Lindsay creeping into his bed and telling him that she wants him.  But he teaches her the difference between appropriate love and the slut love of someone ruined by interference during childhood.However even though her bad behavior earned her the reputation of being horrible to work with, Lohan is captivating in a difficult part.

1088667,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000T988I8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","""Georgia Rule"" is a hard movie to watch because these days it is pretty much impossible to look at Lindsay Lohan and think of her as the character she is playing in a movie and not as a young woman who has derailed her career over the past summer.  Especially when the character she plays is a self-destructive young woman without suitable parental influence, which is not to suggest that this 2007 film from director Garry Marshall typecasts Lohan, but that she and her character are clearly kindred spirits.Rachel (Lohan) has become a handful for her mother, Lilly (Felicity Huffman), who decides for some reason that makes no sense outside of the boundaries of narrative necessity, to leave Rachel with her grandmother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), who lives in Idaho and whom Lilly has not seen in a long time.  The notion is that desperate times call for desperate measures, but there is never a sense that Georgia with her rules was that horrible of a mother and that whatever flaws Lilly had as a child had become manifestly worse as an adult and a mother.  But then we all know what tough love can do for a troubled young girl, and since this film is direct by Marshall, known for ""Pretty Woman"" and other comedies, we expect a happy ending.We know that Rachel likes to shock people, but a bigger clue to her personality is that when it comes to men she inevitably employs her sexuality.  Rachel believes the best defense is a good offense, so she always wants to get in the first shot, but when she realizes the lip she gives Dr. Simon Ward (Dermot Mulroney) hit home in a painful way that she did not intend, she feels bad about it, which gives us some small reason to have hope for her.  But then we cannot make heads or tails out of her relationship with Harlan (Garrett Hedlund), especially given his less than deep reasons for liking her.  This is one of those movies where you have to watch it a second time to put everything that happens in the first half in the proper context.  Just be aware that when you do that it is not all going to make sense.It is clearly established that Rachel is a liar, but the pivotal question in this film is whether or not she is lying about one particular thing, and the whole last act of the movie revolves around that issue.  At this point the movie starts doing reverses and double reverses.  This is a problem for me because instead of telling a compelling story I get the feeling the movie just wants to trick me into thinking the wrong thing.  By the time the ""truth"" is revealed, I had stopped caring, and it was that point where I decided to round down on ""Georgia Rule.""  This judgment was reinforced when I discovered there are all sorts of alternative endings included on the DVD, and while Marshall makes light of the search for the proper ending I must say that films that do not have a clear sense of what the ending should be from start to finish usually seem to have significant problems.  If by nothing else other than default Marshall picked the best ending, because I would hate for Fate to provide too happy an ending for these women.Ultimately, ""Georgia Rule"" is not a bad movie, but rather it fails to be a good one.  That is disappointing given the presence of Fonda and Huffman, because their relationship along could have made for an interesting movie without ever brining Lohan into the mix.  Given the setup there should be at least one dramatic scene between each pair of characters, but sadly that does not prove to be the case.  I could even make the case that each actress has a stronger scene with Cary Elwes as Arnold, husband to Lilly and step-father to Rachel, than they ever do with each other.  Lohan's best scene is when she turns the tables on the local girls who are keeping an eye on her, but when it comes to repairing her relationships with her mother and grandmother the script by Mark Andrus (""Life as a House"") basically fast forwards through the by-the-numbers plotlines.",4,"Given the cast, ""Georgia Rule"" ends up being quite a disappointment",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,3960,"['Georgia', 'Rule', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'days', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'look', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'think', 'character', 'playing', 'movie', 'not', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'derailed', 'career', 'past', 'summer', 'Especially', 'when', 'character', 'self-destructive', 'young', 'woman', 'suitable', 'parental', 'influence', 'not', 'suggest', '2007', 'film', 'director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'Lohan', 'character', 'are', 'clearly', 'kindred', 'spirits.Rachel', 'Lohan', 'become', 'handful', 'mother', 'Lilly', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'who', 'reason', 'sense', 'boundaries', 'narrative', 'necessity', 'leave', 'Rachel', 'grandmother', 'Georgia', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'who', 'Idaho', 'whom', 'Lilly', 'not', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'notion', 'desperate', 'times', 'call', 'desperate', 'measures', 'never', 'sense', 'Georgia', 'rules', 'was', 'horrible', 'mother', 'flaws', 'Lilly', 'had', 'child', 'had', 'become', 'manifestly', 'worse', 'adult', 'mother', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'tough', 'love', 'can', 'do', 'troubled', 'young', 'girl', 'film', 'direct', 'Marshall', 'known', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'other', 'comedies', 'expect', 'happy', 'ending.We', 'know', 'Rachel', 'shock', 'people', 'bigger', 'clue', 'personality', 'when', 'men', 'inevitably', 'sexuality', 'Rachel', 'best', 'defense', 'good', 'offense', 'always', 'get', 'first', 'shot', 'when', 'lip', 'Dr.', 'Simon', 'Ward', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'hit', 'home', 'painful', 'way', 'did', 'not', 'intend', 'bad', 'small', 'reason', 'have', 'hope', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'heads', 'relationship', 'Harlan', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'especially', 'given', 'less', 'deep', 'reasons', 'liking', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'have', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'put', 'everything', 'first', 'half', 'proper', 'context', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'when', 'do', 'not', 'going', 'make', 'sense.It', 'clearly', 'established', 'Rachel', 'liar', 'pivotal', 'question', 'film', 'not', 'lying', 'one', 'particular', 'thing', 'whole', 'last', 'act', 'movie', 'issue', 'point', 'movie', 'doing', 'reverses', 'double', 'reverses', 'problem', 'instead', 'telling', 'compelling', 'story', 'get', 'feeling', 'movie', 'just', 'trick', 'thinking', 'wrong', 'thing', 'time', 'truth', 'revealed', 'had', 'stopped', 'caring', 'was', 'point', 'where', 'decided', 'round', 'down', 'Georgia', 'Rule', 'judgment', 'was', 'reinforced', 'when', 'discovered', 'are', 'sorts', 'alternative', 'endings', 'included', 'DVD', 'Marshall', 'light', 'search', 'proper', 'ending', 'must', 'say', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'clear', 'sense', 'what', 'ending', 'should', 'be', 'start', 'finish', 'usually', 'seem', 'have', 'significant', 'problems', 'nothing', 'else', 'other', 'default', 'Marshall', 'picked', 'best', 'ending', 'would', 'hate', 'Fate', 'provide', 'too', 'happy', 'ending', 'women.Ultimately', 'Georgia', 'Rule', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'rather', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'disappointing', 'given', 'presence', 'Fonda', 'Huffman', 'relationship', 'along', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'interesting', 'movie', 'ever', 'brining', 'Lohan', 'mix', 'Given', 'setup', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'pair', 'characters', 'sadly', 'not', 'prove', 'be', 'case', 'could', 'even', 'make', 'case', 'actress', 'stronger', 'scene', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Arnold', 'husband', 'Lilly', 'step-father', 'Rachel', 'ever', 'do', 'other', 'Lohan', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'tables', 'local', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'keeping', 'eye', 'when', 'repairing', 'relationships', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'script', 'Mark', 'Andrus', 'Life', 'House', 'basically', 'fast', 'forwards', 'by-the-numbers', 'plotlines']",N/A
1088668,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000T988I8,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 12]","I read a review that bashed this film; so I decided that I'd like to see it, knowing my frequent disagreement with reviews in our local paper.  The film pleasantly surprised me.Jane Fonda is such an amazing actress.  This is only her second film since breaking her hiatus between 1990's ""Stanley & Iris"" & 2005's ""Monster In-Law.""  With Oscars for ""Klute"" (1971) & ""Coming Home"" (1978) and four other nominations (""They Shoot Horses Don't They"" [69], ""Julia"" [78], ""The China Syndrome"" [79] & ""On Golden Pond"" [81]), she is one of the most celebrated of actresses.  As the firm grandmother Georgia who makes strict rules that caused her daughter to flee this small Idaho town, she makes the film hers.  Watching Jane Fonda act is like sitting in a train station trying to follow 5 trains simultaneously.  She has SO many levels and bounces between shadings and inflections with such rapidity that she really is like a whirlwind of energy.  The relationship that grows between Georgia and her granddaughter warms the film.  The movie will always be interesting because Fonda was in it!After ""Transamerica"" which earned Felicity Huffman her Oscar nomination in 2005, there isn't much she would not do for a role.  In this one, she explores the extremes of Lily, a grown woman who feels like a rebellious teenager in her mother's presence, a mother who knows that her daughter is out of control, a wife in love with her husband who becomes repulsed by his actions, a drunk and a lush who winds up naked on her mother's lawn in pursuit of another bottle.  Huffman proves that her Emmy win for ""Desperate Housewives"" (2005) is based on great range.Lindsay Lohan plays Rachel.  I enjoyed her in ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" Robert Altman's last film.  She does a good job here as the big city girl who seems to have no respect for anyone or anything.  Then come the darker plot twists as we find that her stepfather Arnold, played by Cary Elwes from ""Twister,"" has abused her.  We're actually uncertain for a time whether it was a lie or actually happened, but eventually stepfather and stepdaughter have the showdown scene in his motel room that nails the past history.Dermott Mulroney does a nice job as the local veterinarian Simon; and Garrett Hedlund from ""Troy,"" ""Four Brothers"" & ""Eragon"" does a good job as Harlan, a Mormon youth, being led astray by Rachel.Garry Marshall, who is famous for his sitcoms (Lavern & Shirley) and has directed comedic films like ""Raising Helen"" & ""Orange County,"" does a good job of keeping the pacing brisk.  Unlike our local paper, I did not find this film a series of cliches about dysfunctional families.  I found the three lead women characters engaging, their stories moving, and I frequently laughed out loud at some great comic timing.  I'm not sure where this was shot, but the scenery representing Idaho was gorgeous.  This was a film that was well done, but has a serious side to it.

The fact that Hollywood felt this was an exciting subject and would ""add"" to this film angers me greatly.

Rachel enjoys getting a rise out of the small town residents, especially the men.

So, what's the story?Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) comes to live with her grandmother, Georgia (Jane Fonda) in Idaho.  Seems Rachel is at loose ends between high school and college.Rachel is also a handful. Admittedly, Georgia has more Rules of the House than a ""Roberts Rules of Order"" but it doesn't seem that Rachel understands behavior management at all. She's rude, she uses bad language, and she's trouble.She's also been abused by her stepfather. Or has she?  An aside remark to Simon, (Mulroney) the town vet.  Of course, Simon tells Georgia, who tells Rachel's mother (Felicity Huffman). Arnold (Cary Elwes) the stepfather is the perfect oily California criminal attorney. He seems so sincere--and yet...From there, we sit through trauma after trauma as we wonder whether Rachel is lying--and if she's not, will her mother get a clue?  ""Georgia Rule"" is a tough watch, particularly near the holidays when some of us are not especially looking forward to our own family dramas.

1088684,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000T988I8,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","**1/2The all-star melodrama, ""Georgia Rule,"" provides us with three generations of women who have never figured out how to get along with one another.  Rachel (Lindsay Lohan) is a spoiled, out-of-control teenager from California whose increasingly desperate mother, Lilly (Felicity Huffman), ships her off to a small town in Idaho to spend the summer with her slightly eccentric grandmother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), a woman for whom Lilly herself has nothing but the deepest contempt.  After some initial tension between the two generational bookends, Georgia manages to break through Rachel`s hard outer shell and uncover the good person within, all the while instilling the values of hard work, discipline and mutual respect into a girl woefully lacking in each of those qualities.As written by Mark Andrus, ""Georgia Rule"" is a largely unconvincing comedy/drama that bites off considerably more than it can chew in terms of both drama and theme.  Even though the movie thinks it's being wise about the ways of human nature, many of the script's observations on familial relationships wouldn't pass muster in a Psychology 101 course.  Each character is given her own distinctive quirk or eccentricity - Georgia is an inflexible stickler for rules, Lilly is a bitter alcoholic, Rachel is a pathological liar - and a pat explanation for why she is like she is, but none of it rings particularly true or convincing.  The movie delves into such dark areas as child molestation and alcoholism, but neither Andrus nor director Garry Marshall displays the subtlety or depth of insight necessary to pull such material off.  Too often, they go for the grand - albeit corny - over-the-top gesture when a simple, understated moment would do.  Moreover, the small-town characters who surround the leads lack a sense of authenticity, adding to the whole Hollywood-comes-to-Boise feel of the piece.The acting is fine, though hardly spectacular (Lohan is occasionally annoying, but then, since her character is supposed to be annoying, I guess that's not really much of a criticism), but even the performers can`t help the movie stand up under the weight of contrivance and self-importance that ultimately crushes in on it.",2,overheated melodrama,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,2207,"['**1/2The', 'all-star', 'melodrama', 'Georgia', 'Rule', 'three', 'generations', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'one', 'Rachel', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'spoiled', 'out-of-control', 'teenager', 'California', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'mother', 'Lilly', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'off', 'small', 'town', 'Idaho', 'spend', 'summer', 'slightly', 'eccentric', 'grandmother', 'Georgia', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'woman', 'whom', 'Lilly', 'nothing', 'deepest', 'contempt', 'initial', 'tension', 'two', 'generational', 'bookends', 'Georgia', 'break', 'Rachel', 's', 'hard', 'outer', 'shell', 'good', 'person', 'while', 'instilling', 'values', 'hard', 'work', 'discipline', 'mutual', 'respect', 'girl', 'woefully', 'lacking', 'qualities.As', 'written', 'Mark', 'Andrus', 'Georgia', 'Rule', 'largely', 'unconvincing', 'comedy/drama', 'considerably', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'terms', 'drama', 'theme', 'Even', 'movie', 'being', 'wise', 'ways', 'human', 'nature', 'many', 'script', 'observations', 'familial', 'relationships', 'would', ""n't"", 'pass', 'muster', 'Psychology', '101', 'course', 'character', 'given', 'own', 'distinctive', 'quirk', 'eccentricity', 'Georgia', 'inflexible', 'stickler', 'rules', 'Lilly', 'bitter', 'alcoholic', 'Rachel', 'pathological', 'liar', 'pat', 'explanation', 'why', 'none', 'particularly', 'true', 'convincing', 'movie', 'such', 'dark', 'areas', 'child', 'molestation', 'alcoholism', 'Andrus', 'director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'subtlety', 'depth', 'insight', 'necessary', 'pull', 'such', 'material', 'Too', 'often', 'go', 'grand', 'albeit', 'corny', 'over-the-top', 'gesture', 'when', 'simple', 'understated', 'moment', 'would', 'do', 'Moreover', 'small-town', 'characters', 'who', 'surround', 'leads', 'lack', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'adding', 'whole', 'Hollywood-comes-to-Boise', 'feel', 'piece.The', 'acting', 'fine', 'though', 'hardly', 'spectacular', 'Lohan', 'occasionally', 'annoying', 'then', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'annoying', 'guess', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'criticism', 'even', 'performers', 'can', 't', 'help', 'movie', 'stand', 'up', 'weight', 'contrivance', 'self-importance', 'ultimately']",N/A

The abiding contempt Hollywood has for homespun values shines through.  Childhood incest is anything but simple and leaves lasting, deep scars.  A girl in actress Lindsay Lohan's situation will either go ""hypo"" (almost asexual) or ""hyper"" (overly sexual).  Lohan's character goes the hyper route (why is that a surprise, given Hollywood's fascination with bad girls).  Instead of being sympathetic, she prostitutes herself to practical strangers... and is so hostile... it shows her ""reading"" but there is no indication this girl has any motive other than to have sex with any man who has a pulse.  Her mother is equally despicable and unlikable.  For that town's sake, I kept hoping they'd hop in their luxury cars and head back to California.  There's always this creepy element about such films... that somehow Hollywood will ""set us hicks straight.""  Example: Lohan works for the local vet (who is also a medical doctor) and is able to make a guy pay his bill, finally, after the other inept hayseeds couldn't.  Wow!  Lohan's going to straighten up this hick town, just like Hollywood will.The only real or genuine feeling in the film, is when Georgia, played by Jane Fonda (why did she go from ""The China Syndrome"" and ""Klute"" to this?), threatened to pound the sexual offender's Ferrari (the stepfather's car). Man, I was going to join her, but instead, head over to the camera and director!  Who created this dreck?It is so contrived, so horrible.  What is wrong with this mother and Lohan's character?  They can't follow ""rules"" or feel any kind of restrictions on them is suffocating?  Give me a break.  Honoring laws and rules makes us mature adults.  Being a responsible adult takes guts and courage, being a spoiled temperamental brat takes only one thing -- a mirror.  If the mom / daughter of this story want to live in anarchy, let them.  There's a reason for laws and civilized society.Equally infuriating was the superficial treatment of childhood incest.  It was almost ""cute"" when the mom finally tried to beat up the icky stepfather in the final confrontation.
