388186,A3T8QI2HA950VD,630391134X,50HudsonCommodore,"[7, 8]","""La historia oficial"" (""The Official Story"", 1985) is the second in what I consider to be a trilogy of films dealing with political repression and its consequences in Argentina, and by extension universally.  The film is about a secondary school history teacher, her ""well connected"" businessman husband and their 5 year old adopted daughter.  At least the official story is that the daughter is adopted.  The mother begins to question the adoption and unusual events surrounding how her husband unexpectedly brought their baby home 5 years earlier.  She begins to search for records of the birth and the natural parents and can find none.  The only thing that is clear is that her husband is lying and hiding something.  Meanwhile, her husband's company is having some sort of political trouble.  As the mother investigates more, she encounters an older woman who she believes is the natural grandmother of her daughter.  The conflict between the mother, the possible natural grandmother, the husband, his family, his business, his lies and the changing political situation provides the dramatic movement to the unexpected conclusion.The film was made in 1985, two years after the fall of the military dictatorship of the 1970s and early 80s.  The Argentine audience would have been very familiar with the constant demonstrations of the ""Madres de la Plaza de Mayo"" (Mothers of the Plaza) who were  demanding to know what happened to their children who disappeared during the military dictatorship.  As we know today, many of their children were tortured and killed and the women who were pregnant were kept prisoners until the birth of the child.  The babies were then adopted by political sympathizers and the mothers killed.  This is a tough film dealing with an unbelievably tough subject; but it is well worth viewing for a mature audience.  The other two films that deal with the history and consequences of political repression are ""Camila"" (1984) and ""Vidas privadas""(Private Lives, 2001).",5,"Family, love, politics and repression",1263772800,"01 18, 2010",2010,1998,"['La', 'historia', 'oficial', 'Official', 'Story', '1985', 'second', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'trilogy', 'films', 'dealing', 'political', 'repression', 'consequences', 'Argentina', 'extension', 'universally', 'film', 'secondary', 'school', 'history', 'teacher', 'well', 'connected', 'businessman', 'husband', '5', 'year', 'old', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'least', 'official', 'story', 'daughter', 'adopted', 'mother', 'question', 'adoption', 'unusual', 'events', 'surrounding', 'how', 'husband', 'unexpectedly', 'brought', 'baby', 'home', '5', 'years', 'earlier', 'search', 'records', 'birth', 'natural', 'parents', 'can', 'find', 'none', 'only', 'thing', 'clear', 'husband', 'lying', 'hiding', 'something', 'Meanwhile', 'husband', 'company', 'having', 'sort', 'political', 'trouble', 'mother', 'more', 'older', 'woman', 'who', 'natural', 'grandmother', 'daughter', 'conflict', 'mother', 'possible', 'natural', 'grandmother', 'husband', 'family', 'business', 'lies', 'changing', 'political', 'situation', 'dramatic', 'movement', 'unexpected', 'conclusion.The', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1985', 'two', 'years', 'fall', 'military', 'dictatorship', '1970s', 'early', '80s', 'Argentine', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'familiar', 'constant', 'demonstrations', 'Madres', 'de', 'la', 'Plaza', 'de', 'Mayo', 'Mothers', 'Plaza', 'who', 'were', 'demanding', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'children', 'who', 'disappeared', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'know', 'today', 'many', 'children', 'were', 'tortured', 'killed', 'women', 'who', 'were', 'pregnant', 'were', 'kept', 'prisoners', 'birth', 'child', 'babies', 'were', 'then', 'adopted', 'political', 'sympathizers', 'mothers', 'killed', 'tough', 'film', 'dealing', 'unbelievably', 'tough', 'subject', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'mature', 'audience', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'deal', 'history', 'consequences', 'political', 'repression', 'are', 'Camila', '1984', 'Vidas', 'privadas', 'Private', '2001']",The Official Story VHS

My teacher was from Argentina and the film definitely spoke to her in a distinctive way, since she was a product of that nation and knew, firsthand, the goings on of the government with ""Los Desaparecidos"" (The Disappeared Ones).  It was a fleet of intellectuals, old people, young people, men and women all considered a threat to Argentinean government (or subversive), who were mysteriously disappeared by the government, tortured, raped, and, in many cases, killed for speaking their minds openly about the state of political affairs.This beautifully made film won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1985.  THE OFFICIAL STORY was sensitively directed by Luis Puenzo, starring Norma Aleandro, Hector Alterio and Chuchuna Villafane.  Alicia (Norma Aleandro) is a teacher at an all boys school and fails to make a real connection with people of any age, much less the students she interacts with on a daily basis.  She and her husband, Roberto (Hector Alterio) have adopted a little girl and it isn't until Alicia has a chance encounter with her friend, Ana (Chunchuna Villafane) that she becomes aware of the bleak reality of the disappeared ones, and begins to wonder whether her adoptive daughter might be a descendant of one of them.This film is raw, unrepentant and very, very well done.

She IS Alicia and her portrayal of coming to terms with Argentina's dirty war secrets is the most compelling acting I've seen in my life. She is simply remarkable and the film's power and emotion center on her flawless portrayal.Some heart-wrenching moments:When she gently unfolds her baby's cloth diaper, long saved in a box of momentos from her infancy, or when she snuggles up to little Gaby, holding tight to her child, the woman's agony becomes so real that you forget that you're watching a movie and your heart feels the pain of her situation.I've seen this movie at least 10 times and I find myself still tearing up when Norma performs Alicia so masterfully.An interesting symbol I've noticed in the film:The opening and closing of doors.----Alicia watching the doors swing back and forth while witnessing the birth of a child in the hospital----Alicia seeing a door at Roberto's office suddenly close, to hide a criminal act in progress----Roberto closing the door on her fingers, as if to keep her from passing through the door----Alicia's departure, the silence leading up to the heavy close of the door, as we see her profile finally pass through.(These are the examples that come to mind. I'm sure there are more)In the context of Argentine history in the mid 1980's, the country itself was passing through a door to democracy.(Un pasito para all&iacute;, que miedo que me da...)

388192,A30X4URPLQ3H3F,630391134X,Jim,"[3, 3]","This is one of the most emotionally powerful political films I have ever seen. We witness an Argentine history teacher's awakening to the truth behind her daughter's adoption.  It was filmed shortly after the fall of Argentina's military dictatorship.  During the dictatorship in the late 1970s and early 1980s there were tens of thousands of Argentines including children who Disappeared without a trace.  Today(2010) visitors to Buenos Aires can still see the mothers and grandmothers marching and protesting for an accounting of their missing relatives.When I first saw this at a film festival shortly after its release in the 1980s, I knew nothing about the Disappeared.  Since then I have become a social dancer of the Argentine tango. So I decided to watch the DVD with this different perspective...and an interest inArgentina's history.  The dictatorship forbid tango dancing for political reasons.  A scene in which one of the characters relates that during a raid on her apartment her poster of Gardel was torn to ""shreds"" hints at that.  Dancers were arrested if they gathered for milongas.

But I did not at all like the ending; it very much ruined it for me.  I'm a person who needs closure.  Yes, this was a movie demonstrating a tragic topic and should be sad.  But that was just cruel, to end with the poor little girl singing about how she's so lost.  We don't know her fate.I also felt that Roberto was a sort of villainized character.  He had a point about Gaby having to lose another mother.  I hope that Alicia, when she left, was going to get Gaby.  What I would like to know is what they decided to do with Sara, her possible grandmother.  Again, I need closure!  I was expecting a depressing ending, but not to be left hanging like this!  Arghhhhh.I also had a problem with Gaby's having been born in captivity.  It makes that scene where the little boys suddenly burst into her room kind of pointless; it's meaningful, powerful, and was one of my favorite scenes untiL I realized she was just startled.  I guess it still has meaning, but, I dunno.  Just my being nitpicky, I guess.I also want to know who Pedro was.  Also, what Gaby's possible parents did that got them arrested.  I realize that it could have been something very minor, but it would be nice to know.

It tells of a mother who learns the truth about her adopted daughter.The story is set in Argentina in the 1980s. Alicia is a high school teacher who talks with her students daily about the events that go on around her. She has a lawyer husband and an adopted 5 year old daughter. Her life seems pretty ideal.Suddenly, Alicia is given a hint that her daughter wasn't given to her through a traditional adoption - that in fact the young girl was orphaned by government action and was stolen from her proper family.  This was the time of the ""Desaparecidos"" - the ""disappeared"". Some estimate that 30,000 or more Argentians were massacred during this period of political unrest. Alicia's husband denies that their child is involved in this situation. Alicia becomes more and more curious, doing investigations into the actual history of what happened.Alicia knows little of what her husband actually ""does"". She sees him as a strong but loving man. As she begins to assert her own independence, though, her husband becomes more and more controlling.In fact, the movie has a ""R"" rating but throughout most of the movie, nothing scary happens. The dialogue tells you about the tortures and evils that happened without actually showing any. It demonstrates how petrified current Argentinians are, while only hinting at the reason. The core reason for that R rating comes in the last 10 minutes of the film.At this point, Alicia knows for sure that her child was stolen from her rightful family after the parents were slain. Alicia has brought the daughter to the grandma's house so that she and her husband can discuss the issue without the daughter being present. The husband, however, thinks that Alicia has returned the child to her ""real family"" and gets upset. He brutally attacks his wife, slamming her fingers in a door jam and slamming her head on the ground. When Alicia is finally able to gasp out that the daughter is just somewhere safe, the husband is apologetic - but the damage is done. Alicia has realized just how brutal her husband is and what he is capable of. She leaves.The behavior of the husband towards Alicia mimics the behavior of the Argentinian government towards its people. In both cases the attitude was one of paternal control, with violence always at the ready if things did not go just the way that was wanted.From a domestic violence standpoint, the movie shows that you can often never know what someone is truly like until you are in a tough situation. Alicia thought her husband was a bit controlling but generally OK through her years of marriage. She didn't suspect that he could physically attack her.

388199,A23VBURIWZPRR2,630391134X,purplehaloz,"[3, 3]","This is a beautiful, extraordinarily well crafted film about the aftermath of the Dirty War in Argentina from 1976 to 1983. There are several contexts that director Puenzo features in this excellent screenplay.Alicia, the heroine of this film (played by Norma Aleandro) is a high school Argentine History teacher. Her students, by utilizing their own critical abilities and independent research, help her to realize that history is not just about the regime-certified ""facts"" but rather about freedom, memory and truth. The national anthem at the beginning of the film speaks to Argentine ideals about freedom.Alicia's character grows and changes, with help from the Grandmothers, who were actually the parents of the disappeared, and other peaceful protesters that call for truth, and the recovery of their grandchildren who were taken from their parents at birth while in captivity by the Argentine military. This film works beautifully level through its alignment of the personal and the historical changes, with Alicia representing the former.The society and the individual both undergo monumental development during this era. As Ana, the friend of Alicia, suggests when she finally confronts Alicia's husband Roberto, the ship may well be sinking. It is also interesting to see how the protesters connect, and draw in support from Argentinians, over the loss of the War in the Malvinas/Falklands with the evilness of the military rulers. (One can only wonder what would have happened if Hitler had not lost the war with the Soviet Union, which was a decisive battleground in the Second World War).It is also gratifying see how Ana confronts the former classmate, who heartlessly turns a blind eye to the suffering and unspeakable atrocities that had been waged in this Dirty War against people like Ana, who fortunately got away to Europe before returning to a newer, more enlightened Argentina that is just beginning to grow up, a growing up that reflects a return to its ideals and principles expressed in its national anthem in the opening scene. This film is a work of art that speaks to the need for truth, for justice, for democracy and is a message well worth repeating to people everywhere.",5,"Memory, Justice and Truth: The Human Struggle",1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,2203,"['beautiful', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'aftermath', 'Dirty', 'War', 'Argentina', '1976', '1983', 'are', 'several', 'contexts', 'director', 'Puenzo', 'excellent', 'screenplay.Alicia', 'heroine', 'film', 'played', 'Norma', 'Aleandro', 'high', 'school', 'Argentine', 'History', 'teacher', 'students', 'utilizing', 'own', 'critical', 'abilities', 'independent', 'research', 'help', 'realize', 'history', 'not', 'just', 'regime-certified', 'facts', 'rather', 'freedom', 'memory', 'truth', 'national', 'anthem', 'beginning', 'film', 'Argentine', 'ideals', 'freedom.Alicia', 'character', 'grows', 'changes', 'help', 'Grandmothers', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'parents', 'disappeared', 'other', 'peaceful', 'protesters', 'call', 'truth', 'recovery', 'grandchildren', 'who', 'were', 'taken', 'parents', 'birth', 'captivity', 'Argentine', 'military', 'film', 'beautifully', 'level', 'alignment', 'personal', 'historical', 'changes', 'Alicia', 'representing', 'former.The', 'society', 'individual', 'undergo', 'monumental', 'development', 'era', 'Ana', 'friend', 'Alicia', 'when', 'finally', 'Alicia', 'husband', 'Roberto', 'ship', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'sinking', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'protesters', 'connect', 'draw', 'support', 'Argentinians', 'loss', 'War', 'Malvinas/Falklands', 'evilness', 'military', 'rulers', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Hitler', 'had', 'not', 'lost', 'war', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'decisive', 'battleground', 'Second', 'World', 'War', '.It', 'also', 'gratifying', 'see', 'how', 'Ana', 'former', 'classmate', 'who', 'heartlessly', 'blind', 'eye', 'suffering', 'unspeakable', 'atrocities', 'had', 'been', 'waged', 'Dirty', 'War', 'people', 'Ana', 'who', 'fortunately', 'got', 'away', 'Europe', 'returning', 'newer', 'more', 'enlightened', 'Argentina', 'just', 'beginning', 'grow', 'up', 'growing', 'up', 'return', 'ideals', 'principles', 'expressed', 'national', 'anthem', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'work', 'art', 'need', 'truth', 'justice', 'democracy', 'message', 'well', 'worth', 'repeating', 'people', 'everywhere']",The Official Story VHS
388200,A2HJB9J5O5CLPB,630391134X,R. A Rubin,"[1, 2]","Cry for me Argentina. Back in the early 80's Argentina went through hard times economically.  Actually, the country before the 1930's was one of the most prosperous in the world. They exported beef and raw materials.  Their economy was fueled especially with British money that built the railroads and infrostructure.  The cities were modern.  Then it all dried up.  The Peronists took over, a populist-quasi-fascist-socialist group and they gave way to a military juanta.  Corruption and violence continued for the the next 30 years.The most famous event during the 80's, the suppression of the Left by the Military. Many of those dissappearing into prisions were students and childbearing women.  They were raped, tortured and murdered, literally vanishing into thin air.  Some of the babies were adopted no questions asked. So there is the setting for this heartrendering story of the aftermath of that period.  It is riviting and one of the few pro-lefty films that didn't want to make me throw up.

388202,A220FJEQNGMSRN,630391134X,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 4]","The Official Story is an excellent example of how to mix political cinema with human drama, avoiding agitprop or crude sloganeering to put a human face on the issue of Argentina's disappeared - in particular the children taken away from undesirables and given to well-connected families who won't ask any questions. When one well-heeled adopted mother learns of this and begins to suspect that her adopted daughter may be one of those children, rather than turn into a sermon the film focuses on her own fears as she tries to disprove the possibility until ultimately she is in the same uncertain hell as the families of the disappeared - she can suspect, but she can never truly know.Although some of the devices may seem a little too schematic - she's a history teacher who depends solely on the `verifiable' official version of her country's history - it wears them lightly and is often extremely powerful.
