1259445,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002BEJ3BA,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 9]","In 2008, the novel ""Winged Creatures"" writted by Roy Freirich was released.  Not long after, the film was greenlighted for a live film adaptation and Director Rowan Woods (""Farscape"" and ""Little Fish"") would be the man to bring some life to the original story for the big screen.  Joining Woods is composer Marcelo Zarvos (""The Air I Breathe"" and ""The Good Shepherd"") and cinematographer Eric Alan Edwards (""Love Happens"", ""The King of Texas"" and ""Knocked Up"").Starring an all-star cast which includes Kate Beckinsale (""Van Helsing"", ""Underworld"" and ""Vacancy""), Forest Whitaker (""The Last King of Scotland"", ""Vantage Point"" and ""Street Kings""), Dakota Fanning (""War of the Worlds"", ""Push"" and ""Man on Fire""), Guy Pearce (""Bedtime Stories"", ""Traitor"", ""Rules of Engagement"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo""),  Josh Hutcherson (""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", ""Bridge to Terabithia"" and ""Little Manhattan""),  Jennifer Hudson (""Sex and the City""and ""Dreamgirls""), Jean Tripplehorn (""The Firm"", ""Water World"" and ""The Trap"") and Jackie Earle Haley (""Watchmen"", ""Breaking Away"" and ""The Bad News Bears"").""FRAGMENTS"" (known as ""Winged Creatures"" in other countries) is a film that has had its challenges.  Because of its not-so-happy storyline, the film had challenges with financing and only when all-star talent such as Kate Beckinsale, Forest Whitaker, Guy Pearce, Dakota Fanning and a few others were part of the film, then the film was able to obtain financing.  But unfortunately, after a test screening at the Los Angeles Film Festival, the film didn't get massive distribution at theaters and very few people saw it.  In fact, there were posters that the film would be in theaters in July 2009 but for some reason, the film is being released in the US on DVD in August 2009.With that being said, I have to emphasize that I doubt that its treatment was due to a bad film but because it's a film that is more or less straight-forward and makes no attempt to captivate the hearts of the viewer.  This is not that type of film.  I'll explain further during my ""Judgment Call"" at the end of this review.The film revolves around a tragic incident.  During a normal day at a restaurant in Los Angeles, a man walks in and starts shooting.  A few people are dead, some injured and the gunman kills himself.  But its what happens afterward is what ""FRAGMENTS"" is about.  Post-Traumatic stress that the characters are suffering.  And each suffer in their own way.Kate Beckinsale as Carla Davenport - The waitress at the diner.  Before the tragedy, she was a loving mother always trying to find out how her baby is doing.  After the tragedy, despite thinking she is fine, she is suffering post-traumatic situations in which she starts to neglect her toddler by not feeding him.  And uses the opportunity to bring her child to the doctor and see if she can get close to Dr. Bruce Laraby.The Hagen Family:Dakota Fanning as Anne Hagen - Anne is a teenager who hid under the table with her friend Jimmy while the gunman was shooting.  While her father was gunned down, she froze and the only thing that she watched was birds flying out the window.  She deals with her father's death by treating him as a hero but in a way, uses religion and God to justify her emotions.  She seems strong-willed and like nothing has phased her.  She sees herself as a witness and that people should forgive the killer.  She is instrumental in helping another friend and grieving family through their ordeal.Jean Tripplehorn as Doris Hagen - The mother of Anne who is concerned with her daughter.  Her daughter has become religious but is that to conceal her pain or has the murder of her husband brought Anne closer to God?The Jasperson FamilyJosh Hutcherson as Jimmy Jasperson - A close friend to Anne but has been affected deeply after the tragedy.  Jimmy was hiding under the table with Anne when her father was killed.  Since the incident,  Jimmy has stopped talking and his parents constantly fight of how to get Jimmy out of his shell. The hospital has been offering counseling but he refuses.  He harbords this deep pain that he doesn't know how to let go.Jackie Earle Haley as Bob Jasperson and Robert Weigurt as Lydia Jasperson - The parents of Jimmy who are constantly arguing and have their own way of dealing with Jimmy's situation.  Jimmy's father is against him receiving counseling because Jimmy's brother, who is in the military, was wounded in battle in the Middle East.  When his brother came back, he was not the same and was in a state of depression.  The family reached out and got him counseling but in the end, their older son is now in the coma and Bob believes that counseling may hurt their youngest son.The Archenault FamilyForest Whitaker as Charlie Archenault - Charlie is a man who believes in luck.  While eating at the diner, he is seen holding a pamphlet on cancer.  He was wounded during the diner tragedy and a doctor has told him he was lucky.  Charlie tries to deal with the tragedy in his own way and that is by gambling.Jennifer Hudson as Kathy Archenault - The authorities are continuously questioning Kathy in regards to her father's involvement in the shooting and want to speak to him.  She has no idea what's going on and her father will not answer any of her calls.The Laraby FamilyGuy Pearce as Dr. Bruce Laraby - Dr. Laraby was actually in the diner the day of the shooting and opened the door for the gunman when he exited the diner.  He was the doctor who tried to save Anne Hagen's father during surgery but was unable to.  Since that day, he has had bad luck with his patients and he has been affected by the tragedy, despite not being at the diner of the time of the tragedy.Embeth Davidtz as Jan Laraby - The loving wife of Dr. Bruce Laraby - For some reason, she has been suffering from some type of illness and not knowing why she is feeling this way.The film divides itself into these five different ensemble stories of how each character have lived their life not long after the tragic incident.  There is no straying away from that plot, we literally see how these individuals are brought to their lowest of lows and how, if they can, recover from it.VIDEO & AUDIO:""FRAGMENTS"" is featured in Anamorphic Widescreen (1:85:1).  For the most part, the picture quality on DVD is good, as many parts of the film are shot outdoors and you are able to get some vibrancy with the colors.Audi is featured in English and French 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily a dialogue-driven film in which the majority of the audio comes from the front and center channels.  Although, the gunshots from the tragic incident is probably where you will hear most of the punch throughout the soundtrack.  Because the tragedy is replayed many times in different situations, the gunshots are heard throughout the film and you can hear it clearly through the front channels and some usage from the surrounds.  But for the most part, it is a dialogue-driven film and you can hear the talent quite clearly.Subtitles are featured in English and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:There is one special feature included on the DVD and that is an audio commentary by Director Rowan Woods.  Woods is upfront about the challenges of funding of the film, why it was shot in Los Angeles, working with the various talents in the film, challenges of making an ensemble film but most importantly is his feelings of why audiences may have not gravitated towards the film.Many people have many questions of why the film didn't receive that much attention, especially since it has an all-star cast and the DVD commentary by Rowan Woods will help answer that.JUDGMENT CALL:""FRAGMENTS"" is a film that will be compared to other ensemble films such as ""CRASH"" and ""BABEL"".  It can also be compared to the television series ""The Nine"" which has a similarity to this film but the main difference is that ""The Nine"" revovles around a bank heist and the victims end up becoming close friends and become their own support group, as they also deal with their own post-traumatic stress.  There is also a mystery element that grabs the attention of the viewer.With ""FRAGMENTS"", there is no mystery, there is no support group.  It's straightforward in showing us that these people who do not want to get professional help have been mentally scarred by these events.  The film doesn't make one appreciative of the characters either.Maybe with the exception of Dakota Fanning and Josh Hutcherson's characters (which the two are more or less the primary characters and have a big reveal at the end), the other characters are just not likable. It's one thing for the viewer to understand that these characters are suffering from post-traumatic stress but how they deal with it is quite shocking.The actions that Carla Davenport (Beckinsale) goes through by neglecting her son while trying to get attention is just going to upset people who will no doubt be upset of how bad of a mother she becomes and the neglect she has towards her own baby.Dr. Bruce Laraby (Pearce) and what he does to his wife in order to makeup his inner ego of losing patients is also going to upset people.And Forest Whitaker's role as Charlie Archenault is not going to have viewers feel happy as he tries to gamble his life away and in the process, hurting himself even further.With an ensemble film, there is some sort of mystery, some sort of storyline that can either captivate your attention, ""FRAGMENTS"" keeps you watching throughout the end to find out, what really transpired on that fateful day and after seeing the characters being put through hell, you find yourself asking the question, ""is that it?"".And that leads to the question of, how much of ""Winged Creatures"" made it into the final cut of ""FRAGMENTS"".  Perhaps it was too ambitious to take the novel and give it a proper film adaptation because perhaps, there was a lot of storyline that needed to be cut out.  Granted, this film could have been even more tragic than it was, and I'm glad it wasn't.For the most parts, we do get a solid performance from Beckinsale who shows that she can portray a variety of characters quite well.  Dakota Fanning is a talented actress and is able to deliver emotion in a variety of levels (like she has done while she was younger). Josh Hutcherson is definitely put into a more emotional role than his previous films but overall, the kid definitely has talent and provides a balance with Fanning's character.Forest Whitaker is more or less a loss soul and you wonder if this character was going to snap but in the end, his fix for dealing with his problems is through intense gambling.  Guy Pearce started off strong but its his character that is indirectly such a sleazeball, that you just can't believe how far he would go in order to boost his inner machismo.  Academy Award winning actress and singer Jennifer Hudson has a short role that it didn't make much of a difference to the overall story.Supporting characters such as Jeanne Tripplehorn as Anne's mother and Jackie Earle Haley was great to see both on the big screen.  Especially, Haley for those of us who grew up seeing this actor when he was a child star through the late 70's and 80's.If anything, the positive of the film is that it was an interesting film that focuses not on any conspiracy or mystery, it's a look of how people deal with tragedy differently.""FRAGMENTS"" is  a deep and somewhat depressing, provocative film and in the end, I enjoyed it for its take on characters dealing with post-traumatic stress.  Again, no conspiracy, no mystery.  It's a straightforward story of characters near their breaking point.I wish there were more special features included on the DVD but the commentary was definitely interesting in hearing Director Rowan Woods discuss his overall feeling about the film.For the most part, ""FRAGMENTS"" may grab your attention but it's simply not a film that I can find myself watching it repetitively.",3,An all-star cast in an ensemble film.

The difference here is that we follow the stories after they diverge from a single violent act.A man walks into a diner, pulls a gun, and starts shooting people at random. Some are killed. Some are wounded. He finally turns the gun on himself and the episode is over. We follow the aftermath of several of the survivors and how the incident has changed their lives.This is a fine ensemble cast of veterans who all do a good job with their rolls. It's acted well and directed well. The music is somewhere between spooky and somber and doesn't intrude on the proceedings.I suppose my problem with the film lies at the script level. We follow several stories but three of them are key and a couple of them I didn't really understand. The third (with Dakota Fanning) involved a particular point that maybe shouldn't have been so devastating to her and might not have been had she confided in someone who could have put it in perspective for her. I cannot articulate on any of them without being a spoiler so, anyone interested enough, will need to find out on their own.That being said, this is still a good movie and well worth watching.

1259448,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002BEJ3BA,Grady Harp,"[36, 39]","FRAGMENTS (AKA Winged Creatures) is an uncomfortable movie: the subject matter of spontaneous unsuspected violence and the subsequent impact on the lives of those who survive a near death situation is terrifying.  FRAGMENTS  takes a moment in time and then reveals how that moment alters the psyche and behavior of numerous people from children to adults. It is disconcerting to watch, but at the same time it makes us face the possibilities of how isolated cracks in the universe can alter our lives. As the tagline suggests 'You have to lose your way to find it.'The film opens with a day in a Los Angeles diner where a gunman enters and randomly opens fire on the customers at the tables and the staff serving them and then kills himself.  We are forced to watch this happen but through the eyes of the people attempting to dodge the attack.  Among these are a waitress (Kate Beckinsale), a man seated at the counter being denied attention as he glances at his new brochures on dealing with cancer (Forest Whitaker), a doctor (Guy Pearce), a young girl (Dakota Fanning) who witnesses the murder of her father, a young boy (Josh Hutcherson) whose terror results in his becoming mute, among others. The film then abruptly clips to the fragments that remain - the lives as being lived by the survivors as well as their families - a cast of brilliant cameos by Jeanne Tripplehorn, Jackie Earle Haley, Robin Weigert, Jennifer Hudson and Embeth Davidtz.  While none of the characters seem to be people about whom we would care under normal circumstances, the fact that the writer and director (Roy Freier and Rowan Woods) have placed us in the midst of the initial incident allows us to watch the strange transformations that happen to these people as a result of being struck by post traumatic stress - maladaptive behavior toward spouses and children, hiding behind becoming an instant religious zealot, gambling as a disease, and the other splinters the impact of murder and suicide observed at close range can cause.  Very little is resolved by film's end but the film does force us to witness something that could happen to any of us and make us re-evaluate our values and abilities to cope with trauma. This is an ensemble cast film, strongly projected, and if the producers and creators of the film merely allowed us more time to get to know each character better the film probably would have been a success in the theaters instead of going straight to DVD.

For me, Dakota Fanning was the central character and had the biggest epiphany moment at the end, so I think fans of hers will be pleased. Forest Whitaker stumbled onto the set from his last four films of a similar nature, so I rate this on a higher element because of the editing alone, maybe the music and the moment of clarity given to the central story at the end. Since Kate Beckinsale's and Guy Pearce's characters were both totally unlikeable and despicable, I have to call this a Fanning film again.The sound and picture are solid, but the supplement was inconsequential. I did listen to most of the commentary, but it was one of those that underwhelmed me. Four stars for the film itself, I feel a very worthy watch.

1259457,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B002BEJ3BA,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Most films that are split into separate parts and tell a story in pieces, come together at the end. All the characters converge, culminating in a terrific ending, but Fragments was different, in that all the characters were together in the opening sequence, and then the film splits into individual stories. The story is centered around a group of people in a diner, when a shooter comes in an opens fire. Following the shooting, we see how each person reacts and how their lives are changed by what happened. It sounds like a very good story and that's exactly why I rented it, however the reverse order of the film makes it somewhat anti-climatic. All the interesting stuff happens in the beginning of the film and what follows, just gets slower, stranger, and somewhat less interesting. The film really doesn't have a single person that you can put the label of star on, but as far as performances go, Forrest Whitaker easily gives the strongest one. Whitaker does almost exclusively independent films and is always overlooked because of it, but this man can honestly play any role and in my eyes is among the elite in Hollywood. On the reverse side, Dakota Fanning's character almost completely destroys this film. After what happened, this little girl finds God and starts preaching to the masses. I'm all for anything that gives people hope and makes their lives better, but when anyone, even a character in a movie, starts preaching to anyone who will listen, it gets very old, very quickly. Fragments is not a bad film, just an unusual one. With the story they had, following the traditional format would have been impossible, but that doesn't mean that this was the way to go.

This is a poignant drama that balances the beauty, mystery, mundaneness and horror of the human existence in the manner of ""Snow Angels"" (2007), ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""Crash"" (2004). Unfortunately, it's not nearly as effective.THE PLOT: After a random killing spree at a diner five of the survivors deal with survivor guilt and post-traumatic stress.The movie had great potential but somehow the story fragments don't quite come together into a satisfying whole (sorry). The first bad sign for me was the unconvincing acting immediately following the killing spree by Josh Hutcherson (Jimmy) and Forest Whitaker (Charlie). Thankfully, after that, everyone rises to the challenge. But this leaves a bad first impression.From there, the story becomes marginally engrossing as we observe the five different storylines, which somewhat interconnect.Like the three films mentioned above, ""Fragments"" is a study of human nature and the human experience. Attempting to cope, each of the five characters responds to their trauma in a generally destructive way.The five storylines can be summed up as such:*** SPOILER ALERT!!! ***1.) Charlie gambles everything away and physically abuses himself directly (alcohol) and indirectly (failing to pay his debts).2.) Carla (Kate Beckinsale) neglects her baby while seeking physical intimacy.3.) Anne (Dakota Fanning) becomes hyper-religious to cover up a lie.4.) Jimmy clams up, shutting others out, and ultimately arms himself.5.) Doctor Lareby (Guy Pearce) alternately poisons and saves his wife.*** END SPOILER ***I appreciate the fact that the film shoots for depth and, despite the raw reality of each storyline, there's a tangible air of reverence and spirituality.
