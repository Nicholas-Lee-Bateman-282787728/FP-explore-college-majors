In this wasteland, football is shoulder to shoulder with religion, quarterbacks inspire as much awe as snake handlers. If the local team ascends to state championship, Odessa will have pride. If they don't, Odessa will be left with, well, Odessa.This is the obsessive, semi-demented atmosphere informing Friday Night Lights, a football movie which is really more about collective mental illness and the toll it takes on small town teenagers. Billy Bob Thornton is superb and understated as the team's coach, a thoroughly unenviable job. He can't get a haircut without being grilled about the team's prospects. Tim McGraw is excellent as the loathsome former star player unable to cope with life-after-football who vents his self-hatred by berating his son for lackluster gridiron performance.A key player destroys his health and future prospects simply to play one more game. The quarterback is so stressed out he can barely suit up. No matter how many games these guys win, everyone's a loser and depression is rampant. The noble virtues of sportsmanship, team effort, sacrifice, and personal excellence have completely given way to winning at all costs, at times it's almost impossible to remember that these are high-school teenagers.Director Peter Berg could have made a supercilious portrait of hayseeds gone mad.  But the movie is actually more engaging, and more disturbing than that. It's a real and compelling portrait of a particularly American illness; the need to win, and the illusion that winning in and of itself constitutes virtue.",5,The Only Game In Town,1139097600,"02 5, 2006",2006,1665,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'Odessa', 'Texas', 'know', 'are', 'more', 'horrible', 'places', 'earth', ""'re"", 'uninhabited', 'wasteland', 'football', 'shoulder', 'shoulder', 'religion', 'quarterbacks', 'inspire', 'much', 'awe', 'snake', 'handlers', 'local', 'team', 'ascends', 'state', 'championship', 'Odessa', 'will', 'have', 'pride', 'do', ""n't"", 'Odessa', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'well', 'Odessa.This', 'obsessive', 'semi-demented', 'atmosphere', 'informing', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'football', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'collective', 'mental', 'illness', 'toll', 'small', 'town', 'teenagers', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'superb', 'understated', 'team', 'coach', 'thoroughly', 'unenviable', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'haircut', 'being', 'grilled', 'team', 'prospects', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'excellent', 'loathsome', 'former', 'star', 'player', 'unable', 'cope', 'life-after-football', 'who', 'self-hatred', 'berating', 'son', 'lackluster', 'gridiron', 'performance.A', 'key', 'player', 'health', 'future', 'prospects', 'simply', 'play', 'one', 'more', 'game', 'quarterback', 'so', 'stressed', 'can', 'barely', 'suit', 'up', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'games', 'guys', 'win', 'everyone', 'loser', 'depression', 'rampant', 'noble', 'virtues', 'sportsmanship', 'team', 'effort', 'sacrifice', 'personal', 'excellence', 'have', 'completely', 'given', 'way', 'winning', 'costs', 'times', 'almost', 'impossible', 'remember', 'are', 'high-school', 'teenagers.Director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'supercilious', 'portrait', 'hayseeds', 'gone', 'mad', 'movie', 'actually', 'more', 'engaging', 'more', 'disturbing', 'real', 'compelling', 'portrait', 'particularly', 'American', 'illness', 'need', 'win', 'illusion', 'winning', 'virtue']",Friday Night Lights

630423,A24PTVSZSM8968,B00005JNEW,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","As someone who lives in eastern New Mexico which is close to west Texas, the story is interesting because it's set in the local area. Unfortunately, the movie is a bit out of sorts. Aside from some of the details that were changed, my biggest complaint is about what the movie focused on. Essentially, it's a movie about football in a small west Texas city. Apparently the author of the book wanted to write about football in an American town and settled on Odessa where he went to live for a year. He wrote his book about high school football that year. This is all fine and good, but the movie lacks much character development or focus on the town and its people. It ends up seeming like a movie about miracle season. The whole movie stresses the potential for the team and the goal of winning the state championship. You continue to think this is going to be a feel-good movie about a miracle season against the odds right up until they fall a foot short of winning the state championship. It turns out that the next year the school went undefeated and won the state championship. That would have been a better season to focus on for this kind of story. If the movie had simply focused on what the book intended to be, it would have been a pretty good movie. Instead, you end up coming away feeling swindled. You can kind of forgive the lack of character development until you realize that's all there really was to the story.

630424,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,B00005JNEW,"Amazon Customer ""Michael S. Beverly""","[0, 1]","Based on a true story, but told and shown with a bit of over-the-top melodrama, this film may have the makings of a cult classic high school flick, but I think its semi tragic ending will preclude that from happening.  Nearly a soap opera in some aspects, there is still plenty of ""high-light"" film footage that gives the film a dramatic flair, but unlike a film, like say, Miracle, this one won't have you smiling at the end wanting to see it again.The acting is mostly good, and the realism of the undue and sometimes cruel pressure put on high school aged boys comes across very well, and if the film has a redeeming message it is simply not to accept the behavior presented, to not glorify the actions taken by the participants; be they parents, players, coaches or members of the community reliving the past vicariously through local high school football players.I suppose this realism and drama actually  make this film a better work of art than if it was a feel good movie just about winning, I just don't know if that  sells as well.  That, I suppose, is the rub, it's a good movie precisely because of the message it gets across, but it's not as fun as the type of movie people watch for escapism, the kind I'd normally recommend owning to watch again and again.In any case, I do recommend it as a decent movie, at least to see once, and it certainly reminded me that, yes, high school really sucked.",3,High School Football Mini Drama,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,1409,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'shown', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'melodrama', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'makings', 'cult', 'classic', 'high', 'school', 'flick', 'think', 'semi', 'tragic', 'ending', 'will', 'preclude', 'happening', 'Nearly', 'soap', 'opera', 'aspects', 'still', 'plenty', 'high-light', 'film', 'footage', 'film', 'dramatic', 'flair', 'film', 'say', 'Miracle', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'smiling', 'end', 'wanting', 'see', 'again.The', 'acting', 'mostly', 'good', 'realism', 'undue', 'sometimes', 'cruel', 'pressure', 'put', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'boys', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'redeeming', 'message', 'simply', 'not', 'accept', 'behavior', 'presented', 'not', 'glorify', 'actions', 'taken', 'participants', 'be', 'parents', 'players', 'coaches', 'members', 'community', 'reliving', 'past', 'vicariously', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'players.I', 'suppose', 'realism', 'drama', 'actually', 'make', 'film', 'better', 'work', 'art', 'was', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'winning', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'as', 'well', 'suppose', 'rub', 'good', 'movie', 'precisely', 'message', 'not', 'as', 'fun', 'type', 'movie', 'people', 'watch', 'escapism', 'kind', ""'d"", 'normally', 'recommend', 'owning', 'watch', 'again', 'again.In', 'case', 'do', 'recommend', 'decent', 'movie', 'least', 'see', 'once', 'certainly', 'reminded', 'yes', 'high', 'school', 'really', 'sucked']",Friday Night Lights
630425,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00005JNEW,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[1, 2]","The fact that this movie is based on the true story of the Permian Panthers from Odessa Texas, (a small town high school football team who threatened greatness) makes it all the more absorbing, but the power of the film lies behind the visual aspects of the sport itself. Like myself, many eschew such comments made in sport such as ""It's not a matter of life and death, it's more important than that"" as misguided exuberence, but herein you can see the overwhelming effects and importance placed on sport, particularly in the more insular smaller communities of this nation. The story concerns the aforementioned Permian Panthers and revolves around the coach and a key group of players, their lives, their emotional and physical struggles, and their passion to win. It also exposes the pressures of winning and losing placed upon such young shoulders by their familes, friends, and seemingly the whole town who revere the sport with almost religious fanatiscism. It is uplifting, dramatic, emotionally stirring and compelling to watch, regardless of your sporting allegiances or prior knowledge as we follow their story. Not being a huge football fan I was somewhat sceptical before watching, but found the film to be surprisingly well balanced and un cliched, with a solid if relatively unknown cast. I won't spoil how the movie turns out (although any internet search will provide answers for those who don't like surprises) but recommend it to anyone with a love of drama, as much as sport. This is a slice of real life hometown America (Texas in this instance), and although many outside of the USA especially, may miss the point, it is a sober reflection on the highs and lows of growing up within that environment.

630427,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JNEW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","The idea of the inspirational sports drama is not a new one.  It has been ravaging havoc in the cinemas since the dawn of time, and while they are truly a dime a dozen, there is rarely a film that actually captures the very meaning and essence of the sport it is championing.  All too often the films are littered with so much saccharine `goodness' that the whole point of the story is bogged down by clich&eacute;d Hollywood atmosphere.  They all wind up blurring together in a long line of disposable, familiar, sports movies.There is no oomph!That is why I absolutely love this movie.  `Friday Night Lights' is not your typical sports drama.  Stripped down and basically bare to the bone, this film is as rough and tough as they come.  With the grit needed to really pack a punch to the gut, and the emotional core to elevate this from the ashes that are every other sports film, `Friday Night Lights' is a shining beacon on the game that has become the lives of so many.This is one of the only sports films to actually make the sport the leading character.The film is based on the true story of a high school football team in West Texas.  The team consists of your `typical' members, from the star player (who happens to be black) to the quarterback struggling to leave his home-life off the field, to the careless rebel suffering at the hands of an abusive father.  INSTEAD of playing to each clich&eacute; like it was the saving grace of the film, and exploiting each storyline for each tear it can muster, this film allows the players lives to further embellish the power of the game itself, breathing life onto the field, where it belongs.  Instead of focusing our attention on how these young men are going to patch up their lives off the field, we are brought to the sobering realization that if they don't patch their lives up ON the field, their lives are basically worthless.This game is EVERYTHING to them, and you feel that in your soul.With an onslaught of powerful performances from Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund and Derek Luke, as well as an amazingly moving turn by country superstar Tim McGraw, `Friday Night Lights' has not a single wrong note.  As the film draws to its dramatic and heartbreaking climax there is a moment where everything seems lost and broken only to have it all come together in the most meaningful and appropriate of ways.

But, the viewer should realize that the movie is ""based"" on the book's story and takes liberties so as to have a climactic finish.I fully support another reviewer who was troubled by the shaky camera style of filming.  Unfortunately, this seems to be new method of filming football movies since Any Given Sunday.  It's meant to have the viewer ""feel"" the emotions of the frantic life of the football player, but it only leads to motion sickness for me, and it makes me doubt the strength of the script that shaking the camera is needed to draw the audience into the scene.The acting is generally good, but while the coach's character was central to the film, no attempt was ever made to better understand him.  How, for example, did he really feel about the racist comments made in his presence, and was he as ambivalent about his players outside of their playing abilities as he was portrayed in the film.  Because he is a real person and the film used the coach's real name, it is possible that they did this film without his cooperation and this would be why not more is given to us by the filmmakers.  That's a shame since he is made so important in the film.I also would have liked to have known more about the only Mexican-American character in the film since he was obviously a positive figure.  For those wanting more information on the character Boobie check out the Sports Illustrated magazine for October 4th.  In sum, I recommend the film, but not as strongly as I had hoped when anticipating its release.  For those who have not read the book, do so soon, the movie does not give you half of what's in the book.",3,Worth 2 fieldgoals and a player in motion penalty,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1727,"['First', 'all', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'best', 'football', 'book', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'viewer', 'should', 'realize', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'story', 'liberties', 'so', 'have', 'climactic', 'finish.I', 'fully', 'support', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'troubled', 'shaky', 'camera', 'style', 'filming', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'new', 'method', 'filming', 'football', 'movies', 'Any', 'Given', 'Sunday', 'meant', 'have', 'viewer', 'feel', 'emotions', 'frantic', 'life', 'football', 'player', 'only', 'motion', 'sickness', 'doubt', 'strength', 'script', 'shaking', 'camera', 'needed', 'draw', 'audience', 'scene.The', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'coach', 'character', 'was', 'central', 'film', 'attempt', 'was', 'ever', 'made', 'better', 'understand', 'How', 'example', 'did', 'really', 'feel', 'racist', 'comments', 'made', 'presence', 'was', 'ambivalent', 'players', 'playing', 'abilities', 'was', 'portrayed', 'film', 'real', 'person', 'film', 'used', 'coach', 'real', 'name', 'possible', 'did', 'film', 'cooperation', 'would', 'be', 'why', 'not', 'more', 'given', 'filmmakers', 'shame', 'made', 'so', 'important', 'film.I', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'more', 'only', 'Mexican-American', 'character', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'positive', 'figure', 'wanting', 'more', 'information', 'character', 'Boobie', 'check', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'magazine', 'October', '4th', 'sum', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'strongly', 'had', 'hoped', 'when', 'anticipating', 'release', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'do', 'so', 'soon', 'movie', 'not', 'give', 'what', 'book']",Friday Night Lights

I am not a Permian fan by no means...Odessa High School Bronchos fan here...but this movie made me think that I feel the same way about the Bronchos winning that these people felt about the Panthers. Although neither one of the teams have been involved in any sort of playoffs or state championships lately, the seats of Ratliff Stadium are still full every Friday night for the game. Businesses don't shut their doors just for the game anymore like they did in 1988...but that doesn't mean that Odessa football isn't celebrated by just about everyone...This movie is not your typical football movie like ""Varsity Blues"" or ""Remember the Titans"" where the players are playing for the fun of the game and every game is won...this movie highlights the reality of football taken to the extreme in a small town where hopes of the championship coming back to Odessa are real and they mean everything to these people...this movie portrays what the players actually go through to live up to the expectations of the whole town, their school, coaches, and their parents. The pressures for these young boys are real.I think Billy Bob did a really good job in this movie and the young guys were awesome. They brought Odessa and Ratliff Stadium to the big screen!

630432,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00005JNEW,a voice of reason,"[15, 18]","This is a well-made movie and true to life in every way. I'm not a fan of cursing and sex in movies, but I must admit that even the party scene in this movie is (unfortunately) an accurate reflection of life in such an environment. I've lived in a small Texas town and can vouch for the fact that star athletes (or entire teams in the case of a winning tradition like Odessa Permian's) are treated as heroes in such places. These towns live and die by their football team, and ex-players who remain in the town past high school love nothing more than to relive their 'glory days.' All of this has already been stated by previous reviewers, so let me add a different twist.This movie should be shown to all high school student athletes so that they can learn that, while athletics are fun and can be an important component in a person's life, academics are more important and will take you further (yes, I know, there are the ones who do make the big time, but they are few and far between). I am not talking about trying to discourage kids from participating in athletics or quashing their dreams, but I am talking about being realistic and having an education to fall back upon. Boobie Miles, the star running back in the film (and in real life), is a classic example of this. The biggest college football programs in the nation were pursuing him until he had a serious, season-ending knee injury. The most poignant scene in the film, in my opinion, occurs after Miles has cleaned out his locker and is sitting in the car with his uncle. He begins to cry and tell his uncle that he doesn't know how to do anything but play football (Miles was shown earlier in the film having difficulty reading one of the letters of interest he had received from a university). At the end of the film we find out that Miles lives with his twins in Monahans, TX (another small town in the desolate Permian Basin of Texas). Interestingly, although the end of the film tells us what other players - Mike Winchell, Brian Chavez, Don Billingsley - are doing now, no mention is made of what Miles does for living. I can't help but wonder if this is due to embarassment at what he does (though, personally, I believe that if a person is a contributing member of society, then his occupation - as long as it's legal - isn't important).At the opposite end of the spectrum, however, there is Brian Chavez. As a student athlete he had his priorities in order: he loved football, but he made sure that he also did well academically. We find out at the end of the film that he attended Harvard and now practices criminal law in Odessa. He obviously knew that football wasn't going to carry him forever.We have seen examples of what can happen to even those athletes who do make it to the professional leagues but don't have any plans for what to do once their careers end (whatever the reason may be for them ending: injury, substance abuse, or simply reaching the end of the line athletically). Former Washington Redskin Dexter Manley stands out as the most glaring example of such an athlete; years after substance abuse brought his career to an early end and poor business decisions left him bankrupt, Manley came forth and admitted that he was illiterate. That says a lot about how messed up our society's priorities sometimes are, and so does the film ""Friday Night Lights.""Enjoy the film - it's definitely a well-done movie - but don't be afraid to use it as an object lesson for those who prioritize athletics over all else (and if you're one of those people, then maybe the lesson will get through to you). My wife shares my love of sports movies (a rare thing in a wife), but she didn't like this movie because she thought it was ""depressing."" I didn't agree with her that the entire movie is depressing, but I do agree that the fact that there are so many cases like Boobie Miles and Dexter Manley in this country is depressing.",5,Should be shown to every high school athlete,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,3910,"['well-made', 'movie', 'true', 'life', 'way', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'cursing', 'sex', 'movies', 'must', 'admit', 'even', 'party', 'scene', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'life', 'such', 'environment', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'can', 'vouch', 'fact', 'star', 'athletes', 'entire', 'teams', 'case', 'winning', 'tradition', 'Odessa', 'Permian', 'are', 'treated', 'heroes', 'such', 'places', 'towns', 'live', 'die', 'football', 'team', 'ex-players', 'who', 'remain', 'town', 'past', 'high', 'school', 'nothing', 'more', 'relive', ""'glory"", 'days', 'already', 'been', 'stated', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'so', 'let', 'add', 'different', 'twist.This', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'athletes', 'can', 'learn', 'athletics', 'are', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'important', 'component', 'person', 'life', 'academics', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'will', 'take', 'further', 'yes', 'know', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'do', 'make', 'big', 'time', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'trying', 'discourage', 'kids', 'participating', 'athletics', 'quashing', 'dreams', 'am', 'talking', 'being', 'realistic', 'having', 'education', 'fall', 'back', 'upon', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'classic', 'example', 'biggest', 'college', 'football', 'programs', 'nation', 'were', 'pursuing', 'had', 'serious', 'season-ending', 'knee', 'injury', 'most', 'poignant', 'scene', 'film', 'opinion', 'Miles', 'cleaned', 'out', 'locker', 'sitting', 'car', 'uncle', 'cry', 'tell', 'uncle', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'anything', 'play', 'football', 'Miles', 'was', 'shown', 'earlier', 'film', 'having', 'difficulty', 'reading', 'one', 'letters', 'interest', 'had', 'received', 'university', 'end', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'Miles', 'twins', 'Monahans', 'TX', 'small', 'town', 'desolate', 'Permian', 'Basin', 'Texas', 'Interestingly', 'end', 'film', 'what', 'other', 'players', 'Mike', 'Winchell', 'Brian', 'Chavez', 'Don', 'Billingsley', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'mention', 'made', 'what', 'Miles', 'living', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'due', 'embarassment', 'what', 'personally', 'believe', 'person', 'contributing', 'member', 'society', 'then', 'occupation', 'as', 'long', 'legal', ""n't"", 'important', '.At', 'opposite', 'end', 'spectrum', 'however', 'Brian', 'Chavez', 'student', 'athlete', 'had', 'priorities', 'order', 'loved', 'football', 'made', 'sure', 'also', 'did', 'well', 'academically', 'find', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'attended', 'Harvard', 'now', 'practices', 'criminal', 'law', 'Odessa', 'obviously', 'knew', 'football', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'carry', 'forever.We', 'have', 'seen', 'examples', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'even', 'athletes', 'who', 'do', 'make', 'professional', 'leagues', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'plans', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'careers', 'end', 'reason', 'may', 'be', 'ending', 'injury', 'substance', 'abuse', 'simply', 'reaching', 'end', 'line', 'athletically', 'Former', 'Washington', 'Redskin', 'Dexter', 'Manley', 'out', 'most', 'glaring', 'example', 'such', 'athlete', 'years', 'substance', 'abuse', 'brought', 'career', 'early', 'end', 'poor', 'business', 'decisions', 'left', 'bankrupt', 'Manley', 'came', 'forth', 'admitted', 'was', 'illiterate', 'lot', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'society', 'priorities', 'sometimes', 'are', 'so', 'film', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Enjoy', 'film', 'definitely', 'well-done', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'use', 'object', 'lesson', 'who', 'prioritize', 'athletics', 'else', ""'re"", 'one', 'people', 'then', 'maybe', 'lesson', 'will', 'get', 'wife', 'shares', 'love', 'sports', 'movies', 'rare', 'thing', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'depressing', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'entire', 'movie', 'depressing', 'do', 'agree', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'cases', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'Dexter', 'Manley', 'country', 'depressing']",Friday Night Lights
630433,AVC65SGZ7CT5,B00005JNEW,"BasinBictory ""Mister Basin to You""","[1, 1]","While it doesn't have quite the impact the book has, the movie ""Friday Night Lights"" is definitely better than many other sports movies. This one is up there among Hoosiers and Remember the Titans.For those unfamiliar with the tale - this movie is about the Permian High School Panthers, of Odessa, Texas. It is the 1988 season, and expectations are high, with a star-studded roster, and many key returnees.The back story, however, is what makes the book, and thus the movie - compelling. This is not merely a season-long documentary of the team and their deeds on the field of competition. It is more about what makes them what they are off the field.Odessa is a declining oil town in the wasteland that is the Permian Basin, a desert-like landscape nearly oppressive in its endless sameness. The townspeople of Odessa draw virtually their whole sense of community pride, self-esteem and well-being from how well the Panthers perform on the football field. Unfortunately, these are not professional football players, but merely 17-year-old boys who, because of the intense pressure on them to perform, cannot possibly life the carefree life of the normal 17-year-old.The movie spends a lot of time on the choreographed football sequences, which are great, but also explores some of the issues surrounding the players and their lives off the field - some have abusive fathers, some feel inexorably tied down by family obligations, others feel like they're just marking time before they go on to bigger and better things.While some liberty was taken with the book, the essence of it was not lost, and the melancholy pacing of the film is appropriate to how one feels when reading the book.",4,Mostly true to the book - an elegiac classic,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,1688,"[""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'impact', 'book', 'movie', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'definitely', 'better', 'many', 'other', 'sports', 'movies', 'one', 'there', 'Hoosiers', 'Remember', 'Titans.For', 'unfamiliar', 'tale', 'movie', 'Permian', 'High', 'School', 'Panthers', 'Odessa', 'Texas', '1988', 'season', 'expectations', 'are', 'high', 'star-studded', 'roster', 'many', 'key', 'returnees.The', 'back', 'story', 'however', 'what', 'book', 'thus', 'movie', 'compelling', 'not', 'merely', 'season-long', 'documentary', 'team', 'deeds', 'field', 'competition', 'more', 'what', 'what', 'are', 'field.Odessa', 'declining', 'oil', 'town', 'wasteland', 'Permian', 'Basin', 'desert-like', 'landscape', 'nearly', 'oppressive', 'endless', 'sameness', 'townspeople', 'Odessa', 'draw', 'virtually', 'whole', 'sense', 'community', 'pride', 'self-esteem', 'well-being', 'how', 'well', 'Panthers', 'perform', 'football', 'field', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'professional', 'football', 'players', 'merely', '17-year-old', 'boys', 'who', 'intense', 'pressure', 'perform', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'life', 'carefree', 'life', 'normal', '17-year-old.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'time', 'choreographed', 'football', 'sequences', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'players', 'lives', 'field', 'have', 'abusive', 'fathers', 'feel', 'inexorably', 'tied', 'down', 'family', 'obligations', 'others', 'feel', ""'re"", 'just', 'marking', 'time', 'go', 'bigger', 'better', 'things.While', 'liberty', 'was', 'taken', 'book', 'essence', 'was', 'not', 'lost', 'melancholy', 'pacing', 'film', 'appropriate', 'how', 'one', 'when', 'reading', 'book']",Friday Night Lights

G. Bissinger's best-selling tale of the 1988 season of  the Odessa (Texas) 'Permian Panthers', the film unflinchingly paints a vivid canvas of a school and community obsessed with winning, as football provides the only release from poverty and desperation. While the concept is reminiscent of Tom Cruise's earlier ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, Berg doesn't glamorize the hero or tie things up, neatly, at the climax; in real life, while victories are savored, they are, at best, a temporary 'high'...while defeats can drive rational people into irrational frenzies. The Panthers' fortunes are such a crutch to Odessa's emotional well-being, that each game becomes a narcotic 'fix' for the entire community...a situation potentially dangerous for the players, and their coaches.While Billy Bob Thornton has received the bulk of media attention, as the stern but fair head coach (with glowing reviews for BAD SANTA, and THE ALAMO, Thornton is having a career-defining year!), the film is really an ensemble work, with stand-out performances by Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Garrett Hedlund, and, surprisingly, singer Tim McGraw (as Hedlund's 'reliving past glories' father). The entire cast is exceptional, avoiding the easy pitfalls of simply playing stereotypes.At times brutal and gritty, at times nearly surrealistic, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS refuses to fall into the clich&eacute;s that marred VARSITY BLUES and THE PROGRAM, eschewing the artsy but smug self-righteousness of Oliver Stone's ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, as well.This may well be the finest football film ever made...as well as one of the most honest portrayals of life in a small town.I will be surprised if it doesn't make most critics' 'Ten Best' lists, at year's end, and is a major Oscar contender.Peter Berg has gotten the formula right!",5,"Berg's Wise, Human Tale of Football and Small Towns...",1097280000,"10 9, 2004",2004,2242,"['Ever', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'provided', 'comic', 'view', 'small', 'town', 'total', 'involvement', 'fortunes', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'remember', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'locals', 'heaped', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'when', 'lost', ""'big"", 'game', 'Hollywood', 'attempted', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'make', ""'definitive"", 'small', 'town/football', 'film.Director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'finally', 'done', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'Based', 'H.', 'G.', 'Bissinger', 'best-selling', 'tale', '1988', 'season', 'Odessa', 'Texas', ""'Permian"", 'Panthers', 'film', 'unflinchingly', 'vivid', 'canvas', 'school', 'community', 'obsessed', 'winning', 'football', 'only', 'release', 'poverty', 'desperation', 'concept', 'reminiscent', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'earlier', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'MOVES', 'Berg', ""n't"", 'glamorize', 'hero', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'neatly', 'climax', 'real', 'life', 'victories', 'are', 'savored', 'are', 'best', 'temporary', ""'high"", 'defeats', 'can', 'drive', 'rational', 'people', 'irrational', 'frenzies', 'Panthers', 'fortunes', 'are', 'such', 'crutch', 'Odessa', 'emotional', 'well-being', 'game', 'narcotic', ""'fix"", 'entire', 'community', 'situation', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'players', 'coaches.While', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'received', 'bulk', 'media', 'attention', 'stern', 'fair', 'head', 'coach', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'BAD', 'SANTA', 'THE', 'ALAMO', 'Thornton', 'having', 'career-defining', 'year', 'film', 'really', 'ensemble', 'work', 'stand-out', 'performances', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'surprisingly', 'singer', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'Hedlund', ""'reliving"", 'past', 'glories', 'father', 'entire', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'avoiding', 'easy', 'pitfalls', 'simply', 'playing', 'stereotypes.At', 'times', 'brutal', 'gritty', 'times', 'nearly', 'surrealistic', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'fall', 'clich', 'eacute', 'marred', 'VARSITY', 'BLUES', 'THE', 'PROGRAM', 'eschewing', 'artsy', 'smug', 'self-righteousness', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'ANY', 'GIVEN', 'SUNDAY', 'well.This', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'finest', 'football', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'portrayals', 'life', 'small', 'town.I', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'make', 'most', 'critics', ""'Ten"", 'Best', 'lists', 'year', 'end', 'major', 'Oscar', 'contender.Peter', 'Berg', 'gotten', 'formula', 'right']",Friday Night Lights

He rules the playing field until fate strikes him down ...and then the team has to become a real team, relying on the whole and not the individual.But there were some problems with other aspects of this movie that soured its possible five star glory.Most notably was Tim McGraw's character, who played a washed up drunken father who'd won a Texas State Championship ring during his formative high school years. Initially, I didn't have a problem with Mr. McGraw's performance as he aggressively taunts his son, trying to make him become the ""perfect"" player. He's not a very nice character, and I think that's the way it should have stayed. But the ending tried to candy-coat him and his son's relationship, and that made the entire portion of Mr. McGraw's portrayal unbelievable. At least it did that for me.I also feel that the David and Goliath battles have been overdone in film noir (ad nauseum). Although some of them (see below) are adequate to the situation being filmed, I felt this movie went a bit over-the-top.I've mentioned other famous sports films that I feel are much better than this one, and will probably hold up better over time. #1 among them is Hoosiers, the infamous Indiana basketball movie staring Gene Hackman. #2 would be Raging Bull ('nough said). #3 would be Rocky (the original Rocky, not the sequels). #4 is the lesser known Mystery Alaska, which I found to be extremely funny and heart-warming.I'm sure some reviewers out there have different favorites, and when compared against this film, I'm sure they might see how this one was quite a bit weaker than their other coveted sports movies.That's how I see it anyway ...",3,"A Good Film, But Not the Best Sports Movie",1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,2366,"['When', 'comparing', 'sports', 'films', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'why', 'gave', 'movie', 'only', 'three', 'stars', ""'m"", 'also', 'basing', 'rating', 'more', 'just', 'previous', 'film', 'success', 'weighing', 'one', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'portions', 'production', 'stabilized', 'review', 'three', 'stars', 'too.Since', ""'m"", 'optomist', 'mostly', 'let', 'start', 'good', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'was', 'excellent', 'always', 'main', 'role', 'coach', 'Gaines', 'was', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'quarterback', 'Mike', 'Winchell', 'played', 'believable', 'characters', 'showed', 'stresses', 'put', 'shoulders', 'family', 'friends', 'obsessive', 'townsfolk.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'who', 'played', 'Boobie', 'Miles', '1', 'running', 'back', 'little', 'East', 'Texas', 'town', 'rules', 'playing', 'field', 'fate', 'strikes', 'down', 'then', 'team', 'become', 'real', 'team', 'relying', 'whole', 'not', 'individual.But', 'were', 'problems', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'soured', 'possible', 'five', 'star', 'glory.Most', 'notably', 'was', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'washed', 'up', 'drunken', 'father', 'who', ""'d"", 'won', 'Texas', 'State', 'Championship', 'ring', 'formative', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'Initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'Mr.', 'McGraw', 'performance', 'aggressively', 'son', 'trying', 'make', 'become', 'perfect', 'player', 'not', 'very', 'nice', 'character', 'think', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'ending', 'tried', 'candy-coat', 'son', 'relationship', 'made', 'entire', 'portion', 'Mr.', 'McGraw', 'portrayal', 'unbelievable', 'least', 'did', 'me.I', 'also', 'feel', 'David', 'Goliath', 'battles', 'have', 'been', 'overdone', 'film', 'noir', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'see', 'are', 'adequate', 'situation', 'being', 'filmed', 'felt', 'movie', 'went', 'bit', 'over-the-top.I', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'other', 'famous', 'sports', 'films', 'feel', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'one', 'will', 'probably', 'hold', 'up', 'better', 'time', '1', 'Hoosiers', 'infamous', 'Indiana', 'basketball', 'movie', 'staring', 'Gene', 'Hackman', '2', 'would', 'be', 'Raging', 'Bull', ""'nough"", 'said', '3', 'would', 'be', 'Rocky', 'original', 'Rocky', 'not', 'sequels', '4', 'lesser', 'known', 'Mystery', 'Alaska', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'funny', 'heart-warming.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'reviewers', 'out', 'there', 'have', 'different', 'favorites', 'when', 'compared', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'might', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'weaker', 'other', 'coveted', 'sports', 'movies.That', 'how', 'see', 'anyway']",Friday Night Lights

The underlying story does not seem to me to need any embellishment or changes for change sake.The acting is outstanding.  Billy Bob is highly nuanced and convincing without overplaying anything.  To me this is the way top coaches are, not the way they are usually portrayed.  These are people that know when to talk and when to hold their thoughts to themselves.  The coach's wife is convincing.  All of the players are excellent, although they seem a bit old.  Tim McGraw is great.

The movie takes place somewhere in west Texas in a small town who eat, drinks, and sleeps football with the lifestyle of a rock star. Odessa Permian High School is a school who prides themselves in winning state championships. The expectations are still there in the upcoming 1988 season with the all-star player Bobbie Miles who can do it all. He can be a quarterback, linebacker, runningback, etc. He is the jack of all trades and has all kinds of divison I schools looking at him. Other key stars on the team are Mike Wendell, a quarterback with no personality, Wide receiver Don Billingsley who's in the shadow of his father (Tim McGraw) who was a key star for one of their championship teams, has problems holding on to the football, Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) and a silent preacher who blocks for Bobbie Miles. Coach Gaines (Thornton) has the stress in his second season to go undefeated and win state and has the team to pull it off. The first game goes their way as they were cruising with a 42-6 lead. After an awesome showing by Booby, Gaines tries to put in Booby's backup in but couldn't find his helmet, so Booby goes in for the last play which ends up backfiring as Booby was tackled hard and ended up tearing up his knee and career is in jeporady. The team must now try to move on and hope that Booby will return soon. The team struggled but the team ended up in position for 1st place in the last game of the regular season. Booby despite his doctor telling him he can't play, decided to go ahead and put his knee at risk by playing. Booby after 2 plays in a close game, could not play up to his usual standards and ends up re-injuring his knee. The team loses their second game of the season and is in a 3 way tie for first place in their district. Since only 2 teams can go to state in that district, all three teams respective coaches had a coin toss to determine who advanced. Luckily, Gaines survived the toss and went on to the playoffs. Despite all odds, Odessa Permian High School would make it to the championship game against the hottest team in the State. Carter cowboys who has 9 players who signed letters of intent to play Division I football. Even though the team came up short they put up an all star effort being down a few touchdowns and come a yard short of winning the game. The team went on to pursuit big careers after football and Gaines reportly won a championship ayear later. Truly inspiring movie that teaches people that to be perfect doesn't mean having an undefeated season, winning a title, or having flawless performance on the field but be honest and give it all you have.

This is a film, not about football but about comrodery, about devotion and dreams and acheiving those dreams through devotion and yes, comrodery.  What's starts off somewhat like a documentary on 'making the team' or 'meeting the team' turns into a heart tugging event as you watch these young men go through quite a bit in order to realize their dreams.  The QB and his devotion, not only to the sport but to his ailing mother.  The running back who lives under the shadow of a former famous father (played BRILLIANTLY by Tim McGraw) who is now quite the drunk and abusive to boot.  And then there's Booby Miles...the star of the team, but with a hurt knee he because a loose link in the chain.  You can really see how these kids rely on each other to pull through.  The scene where they are all crying on each other in the locker room is especially touching.  What stood out to me was the end, the 'where they are now' type part and you see that only one member of the team is doing anything football related now...it shows that these kids are just normal kids, and now they are normal men, but it was the dream that was so real it made them almost superhuman.  This is a great film to watch over and over with brillant acting by most of the cast.  Billy Bob Thorton is fine, but outshined by Derek Luke (brilliant kid) and Tim McGraw (I was floored...but he STOLE every scene he was in) as well as Lucas Black, a relative newcomer who played the QB and real heart of the team.  Wonderful movie that will tug at the heartstrings and by the end will make you feel proud to be a Texan...err...well, you fill in the blank _______________.",5,One of the best football movies ever,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,1921,"['Living', 'Texas', 'almost', 'right', 'passage', 'watch', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'sure', 'touching', 'one', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'young', 'men', 'subject', 'trophy', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'watched', 'film', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'tears', 'film', 'not', 'football', 'comrodery', 'devotion', 'dreams', 'acheiving', 'dreams', 'devotion', 'yes', 'comrodery', 'What', 'starts', 'off', 'somewhat', 'documentary', ""'making"", 'team', ""'meeting"", 'team', 'turns', 'heart', 'tugging', 'event', 'watch', 'young', 'men', 'go', 'quite', 'bit', 'order', 'realize', 'dreams', 'QB', 'devotion', 'not', 'only', 'sport', 'ailing', 'mother', 'running', 'back', 'who', 'shadow', 'former', 'famous', 'father', 'played', 'BRILLIANTLY', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'who', 'now', 'quite', 'drunk', 'abusive', 'boot', 'then', 'Booby', 'Miles', 'star', 'team', 'hurt', 'knee', 'loose', 'link', 'chain', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'kids', 'rely', 'other', 'pull', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'crying', 'other', 'locker', 'room', 'especially', 'touching', 'What', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'end', ""'where"", 'are', 'now', 'type', 'part', 'see', 'only', 'one', 'member', 'team', 'doing', 'anything', 'football', 'related', 'now', 'kids', 'are', 'just', 'normal', 'kids', 'now', 'are', 'normal', 'men', 'was', 'dream', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'made', 'almost', 'superhuman', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'brillant', 'acting', 'most', 'cast', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'fine', 'outshined', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'brilliant', 'kid', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'was', 'floored', 'STOLE', 'scene', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'who', 'played', 'QB', 'real', 'heart', 'team', 'Wonderful', 'movie', 'will', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'end', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'proud', 'be', 'Texan', 'err', 'well', 'fill', 'blank', '_______________']",Friday Night Lights

As a teenager, I attended a school with a similiar love of football, so this movie really hit home for me.  ""Friday Night Lights"" manages to take the viewer into the action better than most football movies to date.The movie starts off a little fuzzy, adding the documentary type effect, but after a third of the movie has passed, it takes on a more professional Hollywood big film feel.The acting is good.  The storyline is not only true but works well on the big screen.  Billy Bob Thorton, besides having been married to the most beautiful woman in the world, is a also a great actor.  He does a great job not over-acting in this film.  Many actors would have not have been able to pull this role off.  But Billy Bob makes the true-life character Coach Gary Gaines come across quite well.The on-the-field scenes are very realistic, and the movie manages to throw in ""touching"" moments and a few ""funny"" parts.  All of the young actors did a great job of making the situations seem believable and also managed to not over-act their parts.I highly recommend this movie top any football fan.

630454,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JNEW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","There can be no doubt that Friday Night Lights is a remarkably good motion picture, but I have to admit that I have mixed emotions about the film.  Maybe that is a good thing because one thing this movie makes almost all of us do is think about ourselves.  The majority of us are in there somewhere - maybe you're the dad who puts too much pressure on your kid to be a star athlete, or the coach's wife whose very way of life becomes defined by a simple game made much too complicated by the community, or the rabid fan who lives and dies with your team and never hesitates to berate a coach or player who makes one mistake.  Maybe you're the star athlete who saw your dreams die in the form of a serious injury, or the little guy who had to prove your toughness, etc.  If you care enough about sports to watch this movie, you're in here somewhere.Back to my mixed feelings, though.  I love football; it's a great sport that lets you have some fun and learn important lessons, such as teamwork, you can put to good use throughout your life - but there is an ugly side to the sport, and Friday Night Lights shows you just about everything that is wrong with this great game.  There is nothing fun about being a Panther during the season chronicled in this film.  On day one of practice, every kid on every high school team should want a state championship, but none should expect it.  Desire brings out the best in you, while expectation sets you up for a fall.  In Odessa, Texas, though, the very spirit of the game is betrayed by the adults in the community; not only do they expect a championship, they demand it; these most rabid of fans might know every play in the playbook, but they know nothing about what football (in my opinion) should really be all about.  The stress these kids feel to not only win, but pulverize every opponent is much more than any 17-year-old should ever have to bear.The film basically takes us through the 1988 football season for the Panthers, from the first practice to the final game.  That first practice sets an ugly tone for what is to come, and things get even uglier when the team's star running back hurts his knee in the first game.  It will not be a perfect season in Odessa.  Losing, of course, brings out the worst in some people who were already pretty bad to begin with.  The parent of a chronic fumbler, already embarrassed that his son isn't following in his footsteps, pretty much goes off the deep end; the quarterback, living with an ailing mother and desperate for a scholarship that can take him away from this town, gets pushed pretty close to the breaking point, and the star player refuses to believe he is seriously injured because he can't imagine a life without football.  What of the coach, the enabler, the molder of young minds?  Billy Bob Thornton may be terrific in this film, but I never got inside the head of the coach he played.  In the end, I see him as perhaps the worst kind of coach you can have.  He's not honest with his team, he doesn't take care of his players, and he puts an obviously injured player back in action without even consulting either of the doctors who examined him.  He plays down expectations at times, but it's just an act; all too soon he is frothing at the mouth on the sidelines.  Some say he figures things out in the end, realizes that football is just a game, but I disagree.  That heartfelt talk with the quarterback: a cruel form of motivation; that half-time speech at the big game: more psychological motivation.  It's all about winning for him - that's my interpretation, at least.The film does have its moments, though.  When the injured superstar finally breaks down, it's more than a poignant moment - the film virtually stops right there; it's one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in a long time.  Other big moments, though, rubbed me the wrong way.  Having your father finally show something better than contempt for you is good, but the reason why it happens in this case sends a message I find quite wrong.This is definitely a film about high school football.  Academics, the very thing that high school is supposed to be all about, is nowhere to be found here - except in the reading problems of a certain star athlete and random comments about more money going to athletics than education.  As a full-fledged nerd, and as someone currently involved in education who has to hold his tongue when he sees luxurious athletics buildings erected on a campus desperately needing additional classrooms, I am going to have to stifle myself right here.  It does disappoint me a little bit to interpret this film the way I do - for, the way I see it, it ultimately says winning isn't everything - but it is pretty darn close.  Whatever its message, though, Friday Night Lights does make you think, and it is a gripping sports-related film, and that is more than enough to make it well worth watching.",5,A stellar yet somewhat troubling motion picture,1114041600,"04 21, 2005",2005,4909,"['can', 'be', 'doubt', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'remarkably', 'good', 'motion', 'picture', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'film', 'Maybe', 'good', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'almost', 'do', 'think', 'majority', 'are', 'somewhere', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'dad', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'pressure', 'kid', 'be', 'star', 'athlete', 'coach', 'wife', 'very', 'way', 'life', 'becomes', 'defined', 'simple', 'game', 'made', 'much', 'too', 'complicated', 'community', 'rabid', 'fan', 'who', 'team', 'never', 'hesitates', 'berate', 'coach', 'player', 'who', 'one', 'mistake', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'star', 'athlete', 'who', 'saw', 'dreams', 'die', 'form', 'serious', 'injury', 'little', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'prove', 'toughness', 'etc', 'care', 'enough', 'sports', 'watch', 'movie', ""'re"", 'here', 'somewhere.Back', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'love', 'football', 'great', 'sport', 'have', 'fun', 'learn', 'important', 'lessons', 'such', 'teamwork', 'can', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'life', 'ugly', 'side', 'sport', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'just', 'everything', 'wrong', 'great', 'game', 'nothing', 'fun', 'being', 'Panther', 'season', 'chronicled', 'film', 'day', 'one', 'practice', 'kid', 'high', 'school', 'team', 'should', 'want', 'state', 'championship', 'none', 'should', 'expect', 'Desire', 'out', 'best', 'expectation', 'sets', 'up', 'fall', 'Odessa', 'Texas', 'though', 'very', 'spirit', 'game', 'betrayed', 'adults', 'community', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'expect', 'championship', 'demand', 'most', 'rabid', 'fans', 'might', 'know', 'play', 'playbook', 'know', 'nothing', 'what', 'football', 'opinion', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'stress', 'kids', 'feel', 'not', 'only', 'win', 'pulverize', 'opponent', 'much', 'more', '17-year-old', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'bear.The', 'film', 'basically', '1988', 'football', 'season', 'Panthers', 'first', 'practice', 'final', 'game', 'first', 'practice', 'sets', 'ugly', 'tone', 'what', 'come', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'uglier', 'when', 'team', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'knee', 'first', 'game', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'season', 'Odessa', 'Losing', 'course', 'out', 'worst', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'already', 'pretty', 'bad', 'begin', 'parent', 'chronic', 'fumbler', 'already', 'embarrassed', 'son', ""n't"", 'following', 'footsteps', 'pretty', 'much', 'deep', 'end', 'quarterback', 'living', 'ailing', 'mother', 'desperate', 'scholarship', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'town', 'pushed', 'pretty', 'close', 'breaking', 'point', 'star', 'player', 'believe', 'seriously', 'injured', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'life', 'football', 'What', 'coach', 'enabler', 'molder', 'young', 'minds', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'may', 'be', 'terrific', 'film', 'never', 'got', 'head', 'coach', 'played', 'end', 'see', 'perhaps', 'worst', 'kind', 'coach', 'can', 'have', 'not', 'honest', 'team', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'players', 'obviously', 'injured', 'player', 'back', 'action', 'even', 'consulting', 'doctors', 'who', 'examined', 'down', 'expectations', 'times', 'just', 'act', 'too', 'soon', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'sidelines', 'say', 'things', 'out', 'end', 'football', 'just', 'game', 'disagree', 'heartfelt', 'talk', 'quarterback', 'cruel', 'form', 'motivation', 'half-time', 'speech', 'big', 'game', 'more', 'psychological', 'motivation', 'winning', 'interpretation', 'least.The', 'film', 'have', 'moments', 'though', 'When', 'injured', 'superstar', 'finally', 'down', 'more', 'poignant', 'moment', 'film', 'virtually', 'stops', 'right', 'there', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Other', 'big', 'moments', 'though', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'Having', 'father', 'finally', 'show', 'something', 'better', 'contempt', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'case', 'message', 'find', 'quite', 'wrong.This', 'definitely', 'film', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'Academics', 'very', 'thing', 'high', 'school', 'supposed', 'be', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'reading', 'problems', 'certain', 'star', 'athlete', 'random', 'comments', 'more', 'money', 'going', 'athletics', 'education', 'full-fledged', 'nerd', 'someone', 'currently', 'involved', 'education', 'who', 'hold', 'tongue', 'when', 'luxurious', 'athletics', 'buildings', 'erected', 'campus', 'desperately', 'needing', 'additional', 'classrooms', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'stifle', 'right', 'here', 'disappoint', 'little', 'bit', 'interpret', 'film', 'way', 'do', 'way', 'see', 'ultimately', 'winning', ""n't"", 'everything', 'pretty', 'darn', 'close', 'message', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'make', 'think', 'gripping', 'sports-related', 'film', 'more', 'enough', 'make', 'well', 'watching']",Friday Night Lights

630458,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B00005JNEW,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[0, 1]","""Friday Night Lights"" is a great movie. Not in terms of what happens, or how it happens, but in terms of acting and story line. The movie starts off promisingly enough, and it starts to live up to expectations. Not soon after that, though, the movie starts to drag in parts. Normally this is not problem. All movies do this. From great movies like ""Garden State"" (in the scene where they bury the hamster) and terrible movies like ""I, Robot"" (the entire first half). But with this movie it doesn't just drag for a minute or two. It drags...and drags...and drags for about ten minutes. There are aspects of the movie that are left unexplained, like that one kid's mother. All throughout the movie, people keep going up to him and asking ""How's yer mom doing?"" and he either says fine or she'll be dying soon. For a while in the second half, we are led to believe she has terrets syndrome when she starts shouting and cursing at her TV screen. But that wouldn't cause her to be sick, is the thing. We all have some form of terrets. When we get mad...when Carl's Jr. puts out more of those ""dumb guy"" commercials, or when they outlaw those Paris Hilton ones. There are other parts of the movie that are nauseating, in all senses. This could be a perfectly good adult sports drama, but, alas, the movie had to appeal to teenagers by adding constant references to ""getting laid"" and doing drugs. Another thing that made me want to vomit was the camera work. It's not that it wasn't good, it was great, it was just a little too pretensious. The handheld camera technique worked in ""Snatch"", but not here. The picture comes off herky jerky and a little ugly. But, there are many more great aspects about the movie than there are bad. The acting is great, and some of the football scenes are truly intense, especially the last one, even though we all know what will happen. The end is one thing that brings this movie down from five star level. As we all think the team will win and we get ourselves geared up for it, they end up losing. I guess it is my fault because I didn't know the end already, but it was still a major let down. Director Peter Berg is much better at staging the more subdued scenes, such as two character talking. He falters, however, in scenes of cringe inducing sports violence that just make the movie a little better, yet a little harder to watch. Berg does stage one hilarious scene in a parking lot of the local drug store involving star Billy Bob Thorton, his wife and his daughter. This is not a suprise, since Berg's past credits include ""The Rundown"", and action-comedy, and ""Very Bad Things"", a very dark comedy. ""Friday Night Lights"" is an interesting drama, but there are a few too many scenes that try to be serious but instead are funny. Names of characters, like my good friend Boobie Miles, will cause laughs between pre-teens 10-12, probably. This is not a great movie, or at times even a good one, but it gets the job done in an entertaining, efficient way. It will appeal mostly to sports jocks, and maybe to their unfortunate girlfriends, wives, or significant others that they drag to this movie. I usually like any kind of movie, and I also assumed that I would like this one. I saw the first ""Bridget Jones"" the same day as I saw ""Collateral"" and loved them both. I thought that I may as well give this a try, even if the previews didn't make it look to great. While this movie is better than something like ""Hoosiers"", it's not as good as, say, ""Million Dollar Baby"". The ending of this one will leave you in the same, dark place that ""M$B"" left you, and it isn't sugar coated and cutsey like ""Hoosiers"" was. At times, ""Friday Night Lights"" takes itself a little too seriously. Scenes where the team practices feel like comic relief from the serious and stressfull other points of the movie. When a character cries, the acting in that scene is so overdone that one can't help but laugh.Thortan plays coach Gary Gaines, who has recently moved to Odessa, Texas to escape his losing streak. He starts the season anew, and he is hopeful with his many new players. Some, like Boobie (Derek Luke), are overly pompus. Others, like Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), are abuses at home. Don is abused by his father, Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), who used to play for the same team as Don is now playing on. Charles wants Don to be what he could never be: great. Don resents him for that, and as a result, Charles gets drunk and yells at and hits him alot. Gaines teaches the kids how to respect their fellow teammates, and the movie follows that same old cliche ridden script. The team plays through the semi-finals, the finals, and finally makes it to the championship. This happens over a two hour five minute time span, and at times the movie feels overlong. It feels about 20 minutes too long. Usually, sports movies use their time wisely, there fore they are never that long. This particular film wastes some time (45 minutes or so) detailing how the players live, yet oddly, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped.The movie takes a true story and spins it into a slightly fictional tale, one that makes it not more interesting, but more eccentric, in a strange way. The characters are never fully developed, and as the movie progresses we keep thinking that they will be developed more, or at least in fuller detail. Unfortunately, that never happens, and we are left on our own to figure something out about these characters. Not every single one is not developed. Gaines, Boobie, Charles, Don, and Gaines' wife are all fully developed. That will have to do, though, since nothing else in the movie, or anyone else for that matter, is explained that well. This movie is a dissapointment because it could have been so much more. So much more dramtic, so much more funny, so much more game oriented. Oh. Sorry. The movie is game oriented, and fatally so. The film, after a while, begins to feel like a bunch of different games and practices strung together with placement titles on the bottom of the screen. It probably feels like this because the movie really is just a bunch of games and practices after a while. ""Friday Night Lights"" shows just how obsessed this town is with its games, and it does it well with montages of stores with signs that read ""Gone To The Game"", and how it shows the packed stadiums is truly breathtaking. ""Friday Night Lights"" is well done in so many ways. Too many to mention. But it is also fatally flawed in just as many ways. Sad, in a way, since this movie had real potential.

630459,A1FM0RRHESCMVS,B00005JNEW,"Deezy ""bacardiyorkiepoo""","[0, 7]","This movie is the worst!!!  First of all, the plot is almost the exact same as Varsity Blues (a GREAT movie about Texas football, and it's funny instead of all weird and depressing): There's the fallen hero, the kid who never played but then stepped up to glory, the depressed player, and the kid who's just good and helps the team a lot.  I could also compare it to Bring It On, with the whole black team vs. ""white"" (even though their team was incredibly diverse, it was still the white team, don't ask me why) team thing here.  I swear whoever wrote this movie memorized Varsity Blues, but I guess they couldn't have if this is a ""true"" story.  After reading other posts about the inaccuracies about the movie, it's even worse; they didn't even make it to the championship!  Why did they even make a movie about this crappy team anyway?  Only one of them ever did anything with his life; the rest still live in that town (or closeby to be by his mommy).  Also, Billy Bob Thorton is cruddy in the movie, as the most uninspiring knuckleheaded coach EVER.  His speech about perfection at the end of the movie almost made me want to spew chunks, but I won't ruin the ending for anyone.  The best thing I liked about the movie was its production, because it was creative and original.  But besides that, I yawned a lot and ended up being mad at the end and went off on some rant about it.  Ugh.  There are other football movies that KILL this one, i.e. Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans...so go get those instead.  Also, if it's so ""impacting"" to make a movie about a team like this, then they should probably make a movie about every team that ever lost in the semifinal or state championship with an injured star player.

630461,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JNEW,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 6]","For an appreciation of this excellent film see the beautifully written review by D. Mikels.  What I want to do here is present a counterpoint.  I played high school football too and might have sat on the bench a little less except that I was a slow-footed T-quarterback at a school that ran the single wing.  Yes, it was that long ago.The football presented in this film by director Peter Berg is a little different.  In fact it is a whole lot different.  Here high school football is the most important thing in the world, not just for the players and coaches, but for the entire town.  If you drive through a west Texas town or an Oklahoma or even an Indiana town on a Friday night in the fall, the town will be deserted (as in the movie) while the stadium at the high school will be lit up like a gigantic Christian revival meeting in which it might be fully expected that Christ will appear to perform the Second Coming.It is no exaggeration to say that in the heartland of America the rites and  rituals of football, joined into by almost the entire populous, take on all the trappings of a most zealous and evangelical religion.  What Peter Berg has done here is capture that maniacal devotion and idolatry--that oh, so American way of life in a quasi-realistic way.I say ""quasi"" because there is some license taken with reality by the film makers.  First of all, and most importantly, the players are too old.  Derek Luke, who plays star running back Boobie Miles (and does an outstanding job), was 29 when the movie was filmed.  Jay Hernandez who played Chavez was 25.  Anybody who really plays football or coaches it can tell you there is a world of difference between a young man of seventeen or eighteen and one of twenty-five or thirty.And the scenes filmed especially for the movie with the flying tackles and the rolling flips and the bone-crunching open field tackles--forget it.  Those are staged tackles, like kung fu fights in Chinese movies.  Everything looks fantastic only it's about as realistic as a barroom fight in an old cowboy movie from the forties.What is realistic?  When sexy, saucy blonde Melissa goes looking for her trophy seduction of the MoJo quarterback--that's real.  She knows that the highest status in town belongs to the star of the high school football team, and the highest status of any girl is to get that guy.  Also realistic is the pressure put on coaches and administrators to win football games.  Winning isn't a matter of life and death.  As some coaches will tell you, it's more important than that.  And they mean it.  Die and you're only dead.  But lose at football and you are disgraced for life.  Typifying this mentality is Don Billingsley, father of running back Charles, who wants to beat the life out of his son for fumbling the football.  Can't the kid see that you let down your teammates, your school, your town, your friends, your relatives and God Almighty if you fumble the f-ing football?Also real is Boobie Miles's answer to what subject he gets all A's in: ""There's only one subject.  That's football.""  Or this line from a disappointed fan calling in to the local radio jock show after the team loses a game: ""There's too much learning going on at that school.""  He's not kidding.  He means it.  Too much time in the classroom.  Too little on the field.So is this film--as its devoted fans believe and know to be true--an ode to the glory and beauty of football?  Think again, jockstrap.  It's a glorification.  It represents a mentality in which the greatest events of life occur when you're eighteen years old.  After that it's all over.  What you got left is beer, the wife, TV, and Bruce Springsteen's ""Glory Days.""  Or to choose another lyric, what you've got are ""Veterans of the fight/Fast asleep at the traffic light.""  (Jackson Browne)There are a number of goofs and anachronisms in the movie.  IMDb lists a dozen or so including cars in the parking lots that weren't even made in 1988, the year of the film, and football gear used that didn't exist then.  But that doesn't matter, and nobody who loves this film cares in the slightest about that because what really counts is the fantasy, the imagined and recalled glory of a time when everything was new and astonishingly vivid, when events made indelible marks on our hearts and souls. When we were all 17.  This then is mythology in the making and in the living.The question begs itself: is this good or is this bad?  Is football as a religion something to be treasured or condemned?  Personally I have mixed feelings.  Young men have aggressive tendencies that need to be channeled and middle-aged men need to play war games.  Football allows an acting out of these needs without undue harm to anyone.  Certainly football is better than gang-banging.When, some many years down the road, the history of cinema is brought up to date, this film will be remembered because it is a very good film, and Billy Bob Thornton's fine performance as Coach Gary Grimes will be appreciated.  But instead of the film being seen as a realistic portrayal of what it's like to play and be involved in high school football, it will be seen as a commentary on the sociology of middle America in the late 20th century, a time when the nation was very rich and football was not only king but something close to a way of life, something indistinguishable from a national religion.",4,High school

630463,AVCRD98TH48RN,B00005JNEW,D. Knouse,"[1, 1]","The most immediate comparison for this film has to be the sports classic ""Hoosiers.""  As with that film, ""Friday Night Lights"" pits the littles guys against the seemingly undefeatable juggernaut.  The players persevere through personal problems, fanatical community pressures, and come together with courage in their collective hearts.  While there are a few predictable moments most of the film somehow remains fresh throughout regardless of the fact that this type of film has all been done before.  By the end of the film I really didn't know if they were going to win the State Championship or not.  The result was up in the air, the suspense and tension in the film at its peak, which made for a much more satisfying experience.  If there is one glaring negative about the film it is all the hand-held cinematography.  I swear I saw the same type of shot about twenty times: a hand-held camera pans side-to-side, catches an image, then rapidly zooms in for a close-up.  It really didn't matter what was in the center of the picture, either.  At one point it is a large bus carrying the student atheletes, another is an exhausted player covered in sweat, etc.  It was done too often to remain kinetic.  I know the director wanted the audience to feel like they were there when it all transpired, but at some point hand-held photography becomes plain annoying.  However, this only takes a little away from the overall effect of this solid, often nostalgic sports film.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoyed playing High School Football.  For the rest of us, it is an otherwise entertaining romp into the world of Texas Football.  I lived in Texas for six years and the fans down there really do love their Football.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[53, 64]","My Gawd, I love football.'Tis a sport that offers the purest microcosm of life:  Play as a team--succeed; play as individuals--fail. Those of us who have strapped on the pads and grunted and groaned in the trenches know this incontrovertible truth all too well.  A single unit is much greater than the sum of all its individual parts, and this stellar truism is manifested magnificently in Peter Berg's sensational film FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.Again, I love football, and I particularly enjoy football movies that capture the grit and dark hubris of the sport, but this film stands alone in its overwhelming ability to portray a game, a west Texas town, its residents, its players, and its shameless addiction to the gridiron to a degree that transcends every single facet of human existence.  In a community intoxicated with football, in a culture intoxicated with football, in an infrastructure that lives, eats, breaths, and sleeps football, the 1988 Odessa Permian Panthers are about to embark on a spectacular odyssey that will catapult and devour them at the same time:  a magical, mystical season taking the coaches and players up and down the peaks and valleys of high school sports nirvana.This is a film that garners attention to itself for infinite reasons.  A great story, based on a bestselling book.  Cinematography second to none, thanks to Tobias A. Schliessler, that gives the movie its gritty, handheld, ""documentary"" feel.  A fast-paced, action-packed, totally believable series of scenes, augmented by an absolute killer soundtrack.  And acting--oh yes, some very convincing, authentic, been-there-done-that acting.As great as this film is, it is enhanced by the talents of the players who bring west Texas football to life before our very eyes:  Lucas Black as a scowling, brooding, ultimately insecure quarterback Mike Winchell; Derek Luke as the budding NFL superstar ""Boobie"" Miles, whose knee injury derails his career and summons one of the most poignant scenes in the film; Jay Hernandez as steady, reliable Brian Chavez; and Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines.  Thornton is a gifted actor, but this is perhaps his best role, as he portrays a man obsessed with getting his team to the pinnacle of success--yet disgusted with the one-dimensional, win-at-all-costs mentality of his current gig.  Thornton is flawless; he does exceptional work.Three other characters moved me, and moved me considerably.  Perhaps, because I can readily identify with all of them.  Garrett Hedlund plays Odessa tailback Don Billingsley--a troubled soul because his father, a former jock (Tim McGraw) refuses to accept his son's perceived inattentiveness and does nothing more than relive his own glory days two decades before.  I know so many men who suffer exactly from the same malady, and could readily identify with the character, despite his shortcomings.  Yet, at the end of the film, when troubled father and son reconcile problematically, I was very much affected.Finally, I identified with ""Preacher,"" the stoic, silent, solid defensive end from Permian, played by a somber-faced Lee Jackson.  He went through the hell of two-a-days, saying nothing.  He went through the trials and tribulations of the regular season, saying nothing.  He saw games won, games lost, players come, players go, but still his resolve was not shaken, and at last--during halftime of Permian's game against very formidable Dallas Carter for the state championship--he released his fury and anguish to his teammates to fight and scrap and persevere, the character rose above the din and ruckus to prove, very admirably, how sports is, once again, a splendid microcosm of life.FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a whirling Texas twister of entertainment.  The film is priceless; the DVD extras remarkable.  This product is quality entertainment, top to bottom.  Highly, highly, highly recommended.--D.

Deep in the heart of West Texas nothing else matters when high school football is on. City versus city put their bragging rights on the line when high school rivalries clash. If you do not bring home the championship you are considered a loser!The 1988 Odessa Permian High School football team is followed for the year. Their trial and tribulations are documented to see what it takes for the quest of a championship ring. Four seniors take to the field for their final football season. The quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), Wide receiver Don Billingsley (Garret Hedlund), Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) and running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) The state football championship is in their sights. And nothing less will suffice. Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thorton) is given advice from past players and boosters who actually won championships from previous years. And they will settle for nothing less than the championship ring.""Friday Night Lights"" is filmed with in your face football action. The realistic action sequences bring this film to life. This leads to one drawback.  The film starts to focus more on the action scenes then bringing out the quality dramas that exist between the characters. The stress to perform for a city, players and parents could have been more developed. But Tim McGraw (Charles Billingsley) as the drunken parent of wide receiver Don Billingsley puts in a quality performance.Being from a small town myself I can relate to high school sports being on the front page of everyone.

That these types of towns and schools have their priorities ass-backwards when they funnel all of their resources into their sports programs and exorbitant stadiums rather than education, which shortchanges the other 95% of the students who DON'T play sports.  That these teenage gladiators get put on a social pedestal but often end up getting the short end of the stick because they are given a free ride through school and therefore get very little real education, i.e. very little real-life job prospects if they fail (as 99% do) to make it into the NFL.  The clincher is the ending credits when there are little blurbs about what each player ended up doing later in life---the sensational star running back (aptly nicknamed ""Boobie"") is vaguely listed as ""now living in Somesuch Small Town in Texas with his two kids"" instead of describing what sort of menial job he likely ended up with whereas all his other teammates' blurbs do include their job descriptions.However, if you can detach yourself from those painfully obvious realities and evasions, this is still a very entertaining film, better than any other football film I can remember.This film could've been a scathing and courageous indictment of the cult of spectator sports; instead it settles on being just another validation of that toxic subculture.",4,"Very good, but could've been great...",1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,1917,"['had', ""n't"", 'pulled', 'punches', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'agree', 'review', 'Salon.com', 'can', 'find', 'rottentomatoes.com', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'acted', 'director', 'out', 'halfway', 'just', 'sports-as-character-formation', 'cliche.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'touches', 'uncomfortable', 'truths', 'high', 'school', 'collegiate', 'football', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'esp', 'tiny', 'backwater', 'towns', 'where', 'nothing', 'else', 'ever', 'live', 'vicariously', 'therefore', 'place', 'ungodly', 'uhealthy', 'amount', 'pressure', 'kids', 'playing', 'types', 'towns', 'schools', 'have', 'priorities', 'ass-backwards', 'when', 'funnel', 'resources', 'sports', 'programs', 'exorbitant', 'stadiums', 'rather', 'education', 'other', '95', '%', 'students', 'who', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'play', 'sports', 'teenage', 'gladiators', 'get', 'put', 'social', 'pedestal', 'often', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'are', 'given', 'free', 'ride', 'school', 'therefore', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'real', 'education', 'i.e', 'very', 'little', 'real-life', 'job', 'prospects', 'fail', '99', '%', 'do', 'make', 'NFL', 'clincher', 'ending', 'credits', 'when', 'are', 'little', 'blurbs', 'what', 'player', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'later', 'life', '-the', 'sensational', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'aptly', 'nicknamed', 'Boobie', 'vaguely', 'listed', 'now', 'living', 'Somesuch', 'Small', 'Town', 'Texas', 'two', 'kids', 'instead', 'describing', 'what', 'sort', 'menial', 'job', 'likely', 'ended', 'up', 'whereas', 'other', 'teammates', 'blurbs', 'do', 'include', 'job', 'descriptions.However', 'can', 'detach', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'realities', 'evasions', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'better', 'other', 'football', 'film', 'can', 'remember.This', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scathing', 'courageous', 'indictment', 'cult', 'spectator', 'sports', 'instead', 'being', 'just', 'validation', 'toxic', 'subculture']",Friday Night Lights

You can see the empathy in his eyes, you can see how much he cares about his players, his guys.  It gives the film a resonance not many sports films have.  The other part is the music courtesy of Austin-based Explosions in the Sky.  Their brand of instrumental rock fits perfectly, alternately evoking nostalgia, innocence, beauty, the fleeting youth, what you see on screen is just given extra poignancy when they play their music.

Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[1, 3]","To pontificate the statement, ""If you ain't playing football, you ain't sh@#!"" basically sums up this whole movie. What's more poignant is if you are playing football, you'd better be winning state championships; the key being WINNING state championships, because just getting there isn't good enough.The movie's setting takes place in a small Texas town named Odessa, whose only existence centers around high school football. Where the school's football coach earns more money than its principle, and the high school football stadium is the town's single most treasured possession. Where there is no room mediocrity and losing is not a choice. Where winning is everything, and the Texas state championship game the city's only gauge of a successful season.Billy Bob Thorton plays Coach Gary Gaines, Odessa's messiah. He is the man in which all of the city's hopes and dreams rest. The only person who will be held accountable, if the team does not reach its lofty goal. Only to be the person who is consistently second-guessed at any and every opportunity. The city's Golden Boy, when the team's winning; and the city's Sewer Boy, when they're not.At the beginning of the film, emotions are running high as the Permian High Panthers are expected to make a run at this year's state championship (again). All their expectation's are resting on the back (and legs) of their star running back, Boobie Miles.Everything is just peachy-keen, until Boobie tears his ACL, Anterior Cruciate Ligament (knee), in a freak tackling injury with 1:21 remaining in the inaugural game of the season in which Permian High was leading 42 - 7.What transpires next is a series of games, and the events which re-mold the team, players, and strengthen family relationships. There's no hope for the town however. Its still just as screwed up at the end of the film as it was at the beginning. I guess that was too much to ask for anyways.The film effectively communicates the football frenzy that envelops this small town; however, fails miserably in making us care about these individuals. There is nada, zero, zilch character development.For example, Coach Gaines, what do we know him? He's married, has a daughter, and coaches high school football period. Where did he come from? What's his career history? Why has he had to move so often, that his daughter questions will they be moving again?Mike Winchell, starting quarterback: What wrong with his mother? Is she physically or just mentally deranged? Where his father? Was that his brother that he was on the phone asking to come back? If so, where is his brother?Boobie Miles, star running back: Where are his parents?

When it comes from the mouth of Billy Bob Thornton playing the coach of a West Texas high school football team, it is eloquent.There is an honesty to this recreation of a true story as adapted by Peter Berg that rings true. Though the film is apparently about a football team's obsession with winning the Texas State Championship, it is more concerned with showing us the extremes such obsession drives small towns, parents, townsfolk, and even teammates into a variation of road rage.  Each of the teammates is examined and found to be the victim of too high expectations and distorted values.  It is the heart of the coach that ultimately puts winning and losing into perspective, and that moment in the locker room of the final game is superb.The cast is good, especially Billy Bob Thornton as the coach, but also his players Derek Luke, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson,  and Lee Thompson Young.  The direction is fine except for the ever-present level of noise from the sport and from the intrusive music, jerky editing, and jumbled views of the games in action.

Artistically, the highest achievement of the movie was the instrumental soundtrack by the Texas band Explosions in the Sky (even if it's not original music from them; it was recycled from existing albums).This movie could have been so much more.(1) Wasted acresses: In the TV show, we find out that Connie Britton (who plays the coach's wife in both the TV show and this movie) is an exceptionally talented actress, but we only get a peek at her talent in the movie during the scene where she talks about escaping to Alaska. Similarly, Amber Heard (who was in this movie for about 1 minute as the topless girl on the couch) is now a leading female actress with serious talent.(2) Not enough focus on high school social life: We play high school sports in large part for the girls. But other than the party scene near the beginning, we learn nothing about the challenges of high school relationships; the girlfriends have almost no impact on these guys' lives. The TV show turns the girlfriends, played by accomplished actresses Minka Kelly and Adrianne Palicki, into main characters and thoughtfully explores their impact on the game of football.There are other things missing, but I understand that you can only cover so much ground in 2-hours.

To say that the fans of Permian high school in Odessa, in west Texas, live for their team could be the understatement of the year.  It makes for a ton of pressure on 17 year old boys, but then, none of these ""boys"" look anywhere near 17, a standard Hollywood problem with teenage character movies.The movie runs around two hours; you don't notice the time, a very good indicator.  It has excellent cinematography, including some superb setting shots that wonderfully capture the vast emptiness of West Texas.  Billy Bob Thornton as the coach is as good as I've seen him and singer Tim McGraw as the bullying father of one player launches a second career.  The football action, particularly the close-up tackling, approaches NFL highlights for realism.On the other hand, there are problems besides the overaged ""boys.""  Some of the story lines get pretty short shrift.  For example, I never did figure out just exactly what the weirdness was with the quarterback's mother, failing health? kind of wacko?, who knows?

The movie inspires me to go on to read the nonfiction book of the same title.Great performance from Billy Bob Thornton, who turns out to be the perfect choice for this role. Great performance from everyone else too. The characters are so believable that it's hard to remember that it isn't a documentary. The side stories (the kid with the alcoholic father trying to live vicariously through his son's football career, the kid for whom an injury could change everything, etc.) are very well done. I'm having a hard time finding anything to fault.This movie goes with ""October Sky"" in helping to explain why some kids escape difficulties that other kids use to blame for delinquency and anti-social behavior. Both, incidentally, were based on true stories.In ""October Sky,"" kids who are followers find a positive influence to gravitate towards (Homer Hickam, who enthuses them about rockets). In ""Friday Night Lights,"" kids who are followers find a positive influence to gravitate towards (the high school football team).In both cases, the positive influences are enough to overcome otherwise negative influences (such as the physically abusive father) and provide a bridge through that precarious time when the late teen is, briefly, the most dangerous animal on the planet.I used to be one of those people who might have argued the town spends too much on football, what about academics, the jock clique sucks, etc., etc. Having written about drifting misfit kids drawn to the wrong kind of leader and violence, thus ending up in prison for the rest of their lives, I now feel very strongly that anything that provides a positive influence is good. Football is good. It offers these kids hope, a goal, discipline, moments of triumph, something they can master independently of anyone else, just for themselves. I'll bet that small towns like this that have strong football programs are less likely to have, say, a high school shooting, because of the program and the way it draws in virtually the whole town. Football isn't part of the problem--it's part of the solution.Much, much to like about this movie. I love the details like the signs on the stores that close when everyone's at the game. I loved the ending, which just capped the film for me by not ruining it with schmaltz. It must've been so tempting to go with a different, happier ending.I also thought Lucas Black's performance was just outstanding.

Wasn't long. I did find the actual site as well for the Permian Panthers. In 1988 Permian lost in the State Semi-Finals, not State according to the site. It says Dallas Carter beat them 14-9 in the semi-finals. Is this correct? ([...]) That really ruined it for me.

I guess the answer is yes because I'm both, and I blame it on this highstrung, overacted mess called Friday Night Lights. It's a sports movie so predictable it's almost funny, but it has a jitteriness and dark tone with makes it about as hilarious as a tension headache.The movie of course is about football in Texas, where it is taken every bit as serious as Baptist sunday school and honkytonk music, but Friday Night Lights lacks believability. Many of the actors aren't big enough to pose as high school football players, especially for a rural farm-boy town they're supposedly situated in. It shows a scene where the players are weightlifting in the school gym, and I'm thinking ""don't you kids eat?"" They look no taller than 5' 9"" and scrawny, with no weight to throw around. In a real Texas high school football team - especially one predicted to win the state finals as the team in Friday Night Lights is - the players are a foot bigger and a foot wider (slight exageration but you get my point). This inaccuracy threw me right off, and I had a hard time settling into the movie. No big deal anyway, because the first half suffered uneven pacing and was a little thick in the overdramatization. The second half was better, but still predictable and I had a hard time believing the game time situations or caring about the characters. And maybe that's it's most glaring flaw; the stereotypes and storylines of the main characters was too played out for me. It's like I've already seen the movie a dozen times. Blah.

Watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, based on the book of the same title by H.G. Bissinger about the 1988 season of the Odessa  (Texas) Permian Panthers high school team, we learn that the fixation is acquired early in life, especially if the town has nothing else going for it but prairie grass or, in the case of Odessa, stinky oil wells.Billy Bob Thornton, as the Panthers' head coach Gary Gaines, gives what may be the first Oscar-worthy performance of the 2004 film season. Odessa expects the Panthers to win the state championship, and no excuses for failure are acceptable. As Coach Gaines admonishes his players:""You have the responsibility of protecting this team and this school and this town.""Yes, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is about football (and contains some of the best gridiron action you'll ever see outside of the real thing), but, in a larger arena, it's a commentary on the almost crushing pressure on teenage athletes to win the Big One for town, school, friends, and family. It could just as well be about baseball, basketball, or ice hockey.At the outset, Gaines builds his offense around a single, star running back, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). But after Miles is seriously injured early on and lost to the team for the season, the burden falls on senior quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) and the fumble-prone running back, Don Billingsley (Garret Hedlund). Winchell's focus is hindered by the realization that going off to college will force him to leave behind his dependent mother. On the other hand, the hapless Billingsley is constantly browbeaten by his abusive father Charles (CW singer Tim McGraw), once himself a player on a champion Panther squad, who can't understand why Don is so inept and fears that his son may squander the only chance he'll ever have for the memory of a fleeting glory in an otherwise unremarkable life. However, Derek Luke provides the film's undeniably most powerful scene - worthy a Best Supporting nod by itself - when he emotionally breaks down under the realization that he can no longer do the only thing he's good at, i.e. play football.FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is undoubtedly a Guy Flick. While my wife wasn't exactly bored in the cinema seat, she can't understand why I'm rating the film so highly. It's partly because of Billy Bob's superb performance, but also because it's lean and hard-hitting film about boys being shoved into manhood by pressures beyond their control. In another era, the film would have been about young men forged in the hell of armed combat.

630492,A1LP6O85Z894GT,B00005JNEW,"J. Remington ""John Remington""","[2, 4]","First things first. Please read Bissinger's superb piece of personal journalism that inspired this film. It will help fill in the historical, political, racial and societal gaps that the film medium is not always able to communicate in a two hour running time.That said, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an honest and emotional journey throught the obsessiveness that permeates every pore of a small Texas town. The point of religious zealotry is of course, in this instance, High School football.Director Peter Berg (Bissinger's cousin in fact) wisely chooses to shoot the film in a documentary fashion in an effort to capture the original book's journalistic viewpoint. For viewers used to the straight ahead approach conventionally employed by the sports film genre, this might be somewhat off putting. Berg often employ's hand held shots that swish and pan through the scene, providing long takes that capture the immediacy of the characters' lives and environments. This film making choice allows the actors to inhabit their roles truthfully without feeling the need to grandize.On the note of acting, all the performers give naturalistic, low-key performances. There is nary a false note. Anchored by Billy Bob Thorton's understated work as head coach Gary Gaines, the ensemble cast avoids ""star"" performances and creates a meaningful ensemble. Again, Berg's cinema-verite' camera draws the viewer into the characters' lives and invites the actors to embrace the genuine truth of each organic moment. Like any good documentary, there are many scenes where the viewer feels uncomfortable and like an intruder on someone else's private moment. The heart rendering scenes between Tim McGraw (making a stunning debut here) and his son, being just one instance.The echoing, and haunting score by Explosions in the Sky evokes the painful loneliness that awaits each high school athlete after the cheering ends and the stadium empties and all that awaits is the vast, vacuous Texas prarie night.Berg avoids many of the tried and true cliche's that dominate so many sports films. There is no uplifting training sequence. There is no obligatory scene of team bonding (usuall the team lip syncing to a Motown classic in the shower). The big game is an ultimate let down (not a spoiler for anyone who has read the book).The action scenes of the football games themselves are brutal. Berg never lets the audience forget that these games are violent rituals, creating a communal substitution for nothing less than war.The film is not without its flaws. It's attention to period detail is negligible (come on, where are all the ""mullets""?)and it doesn't approach the scope of the book's superb social commentary (there are historic, economic and political reasons High School Football has such prominence). I also missed the portrayl of the special treatment the athletes received in school. This was (and still IS in many instances) an era where the definition of ""student/athlete"" was nebulous.The DVD's deleted scenes do provide some of the social commentary though and a behind the scenes documentary places real faces and voices to the characters' on screen life. To see what followed the events depicted in the film reminds the viewer that life does not end once the pads are put away.Like Bissinger's book, Berg's film resounds with a underlying sadness. These young boys may be warriors once, but they are always replacable and interchangeable. They are plaques and tiles always ready to be tossed into the trash in favor of next year's batch. These young men often face careers of ""what could have been"" and ""used to be's"".

The problem with sports films is that they - almost by necessity - follow the same arc; the tough coach who nobody supports comes in to a small-town team and leads them to the state finals.  Could be the plot of Hoosiers, right?What sets this film apart is that is based on true events.  Far from romanticizing the game, this movie makes the life of a high school football star seem like a nightmare.  It is too much of a responsibility to place on the shoulders of a 17-year-old to give meaning to an entire population's existence.  The director, Peter Berg, is an actor who is distinguishing himself with films like this and The Rundown.  He shows tremendous visual flare.  The movie has a documentary feel.  One of the great devices he uses is to have the constant talk radio chatter in the background; we know that the town's citizens feel that the problem with the local high school is that they ""care too much about learnin'"".I have never read the book, but I am told that the film is an accurate representation.  I am given to understand that they both capture what it is like for a small town sports star.  Even though it is hard to come up with new twists in sports movies, it does manage a few surprises.  It makes a fascinating and enjoyable movie.",4,Great sports movie...,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,1368,"['Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'being', 'billed', 'best', 'sports', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'hard', 'title', 'live', 'up', 'problem', 'sports', 'films', 'almost', 'necessity', 'follow', 'same', 'arc', 'tough', 'coach', 'who', 'nobody', 'small-town', 'team', 'state', 'finals', 'Could', 'be', 'plot', 'Hoosiers', 'right', 'What', 'film', 'apart', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Far', 'romanticizing', 'game', 'movie', 'life', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'star', 'seem', 'nightmare', 'too', 'much', 'responsibility', 'place', 'shoulders', '17-year-old', 'give', 'meaning', 'entire', 'population', 'existence', 'director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'actor', 'who', 'distinguishing', 'films', 'Rundown', 'tremendous', 'visual', 'flare', 'movie', 'documentary', 'feel', 'One', 'great', 'devices', 'have', 'constant', 'talk', 'radio', 'chatter', 'background', 'know', 'town', 'citizens', 'feel', 'problem', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'learnin', '.I', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'told', 'film', 'accurate', 'representation', 'am', 'given', 'understand', 'capture', 'what', 'small', 'town', 'sports', 'star', 'Even', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'twists', 'sports', 'movies', 'manage', 'few', 'surprises', 'fascinating', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",Friday Night Lights
630494,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B00005JNEW,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[1, 2]","One of my friends saw the film last night (she is a so-so BBT fan, having loved ""Sling Blade"", but thinks BB hasn't topped it yet).  She liked ""Friday Night Lights"" OK, but thought her overall disappointment in the film was due to it being much too hyped by the media.No surprise that my reaction was the opposite.  I though FNL was an even better film that I expected.This true story would have lost something if it had been written as fiction I think.  Script writers seem to be driven to make life even out.The idea that what the viewer is seeing is 'reality' lends grit and substance to this story of Odessa and the town's obsession with football in this highlighted year of what is a very long history.There are so many issues brought to light and the issues themselves offer so many varied sides to the facts, it leaves the viewer with much to ponder and certainly with mixed emotions and reactions.One thing I was definitely not conflicted about was Billy Bob's performance.  It was sterling.  To all the nay-sayers who I have heard say, ""he always just plays himself"", this year alone should point out the error of this belief.  He was: Davy Crockett, a frontiersman; Willie, a unique Santa Claus; and Gray Gaines, a true southern high-school coach.  Is Billy Bob actually all these people?  Perhaps now it will come clear to many new fans, he only 'seems' to be portraying himself because he is such a tremendous talent he totally makes the viewer believe he IS the character.This film was very well cast all around.  Tim McGraw (and I am not a TM fan, so I can appreciate talent other than because of my obvious bias when it comes to BB) was excellent.  I have to admit, I kept picturing Dwight Yoakam in the role, but that didn't distract me from recognizing the acting talent of Tim.  Who would have ever thought it?  Much the same way Dwight emerged as a fine actor in ""Sling Blade"", McGraw revealed a side of his creativity we have never before seen.Lucas Black (Mike Winchell) was a true find as a young actor ('Sling Blade' and 'Crazy in Alabama')  and he continues to grow in his craft.  In his easy acting ability, he reminds me of a young Billy Bob.  Garrett Hedlund (Don Billingsley) and Derek Luke (Boobie Miles) were extremely well-cast and did amazing work.  Grover Coulson, not a well established actor by any means, was very believable as Boobie's uncle L.V.I am so thrilled for Billy Bob's continued growth in his film career and that he is finally getting high-profile film roles and the respect of the film makers.  The down side is that I miss seeing Rick Dial, Brent Briscoe, and other familiar faces from Billy Bob's movies.""Friday Night Lights"", as BB has mentioned in interviews, was filmed in a more chaotic, kenetic style than most of his films, but it was perfectly suited to the subject.  The awesome vintage cars were great to look at and lent a real air of reality to the actual era of the film.  The music, while not my favorite genre and not true to the time of the story (at least by my recollections) did, much like the photographic style, definitely match the flavor of the film.I have heard FNL compared to 'Hoosiers' numerous times.  I liked 'Hoosiers' very much, but I thought 'Friday Night Lights' was a far superior film in all aspects from casting, photography, editing, and storyline, to performances.  This is a touching story that makes you care about the town, the game, the coach, and most of all the kids living these stress-filled lives as the heros of their misquided town carrying tremendous responsibility under the guise of young folks have fun.  My emotions were stimulated from the opening scenes to the ending updates about these real-live-characters.While much of FNL was bold and in-your-face football action, there were subtle moments as well.  Coach Gaines' look and 'kissed-fingers' relayed to his wife after the game definitely spoke volumes, but not near as much as the total relief expressed so loud and clear in the subtle, easy, sweet smile of Mike Winchell when he finally realized that the weight of eight years of playing the game of youth football was finally behind him and he could face the challenges of living his 'real life', which in comparison surely felt like it would be 'child's play'.I predict this classy film will a classic sport flick in much the same way ""Bad Santa"" will become a classic cult Christmas movie.  Of course Billy Bob is going to be in our minds and hearts for years to come as his body of work, as well as his fan base, continues to grow.",5,Destined to be a classic 'sports' film,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",2004,4546,"['One', 'friends', 'saw', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'so-so', 'BBT', 'fan', 'having', 'loved', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'BB', ""n't"", 'topped', 'yet', 'liked', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'OK', 'thought', 'overall', 'disappointment', 'film', 'was', 'due', 'being', 'much', 'too', 'hyped', 'media.No', 'surprise', 'reaction', 'was', 'opposite', 'FNL', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'film', 'expected.This', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'fiction', 'think', 'Script', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'driven', 'make', 'life', 'even', 'out.The', 'idea', 'what', 'viewer', 'seeing', ""'reality"", 'lends', 'grit', 'substance', 'story', 'Odessa', 'town', 'obsession', 'football', 'highlighted', 'year', 'what', 'very', 'long', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'brought', 'light', 'issues', 'offer', 'so', 'many', 'varied', 'sides', 'facts', 'viewer', 'much', 'ponder', 'certainly', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'reactions.One', 'thing', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'conflicted', 'was', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'performance', 'was', 'sterling', 'nay-sayers', 'who', 'have', 'heard', 'say', 'always', 'just', 'year', 'alone', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'error', 'belief', 'was', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'frontiersman', 'Willie', 'unique', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Gray', 'Gaines', 'true', 'southern', 'high-school', 'coach', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'actually', 'people', 'Perhaps', 'now', 'will', 'come', 'clear', 'many', 'new', 'fans', 'only', 'be', 'portraying', 'such', 'tremendous', 'talent', 'totally', 'viewer', 'believe', 'character.This', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'around', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'am', 'not', 'TM', 'fan', 'can', 'appreciate', 'talent', 'other', 'obvious', 'bias', 'when', 'BB', 'was', 'excellent', 'have', 'admit', 'kept', 'picturing', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'distract', 'recognizing', 'acting', 'talent', 'Tim', 'Who', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'Much', 'same', 'way', 'Dwight', 'emerged', 'fine', 'actor', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'McGraw', 'revealed', 'side', 'creativity', 'have', 'never', 'before', 'seen.Lucas', 'Black', 'Mike', 'Winchell', 'was', 'true', 'find', 'young', 'actor', ""'Sling"", 'Blade', ""'Crazy"", 'Alabama', 'grow', 'craft', 'easy', 'acting', 'ability', 'young', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Don', 'Billingsley', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'were', 'extremely', 'well-cast', 'did', 'amazing', 'work', 'Grover', 'Coulson', 'not', 'well', 'established', 'actor', 'means', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'Boobie', 'uncle', 'L.V.I', 'am', 'so', 'thrilled', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'continued', 'growth', 'film', 'career', 'finally', 'getting', 'high-profile', 'film', 'roles', 'respect', 'film', 'makers', 'down', 'side', 'miss', 'seeing', 'Rick', 'Dial', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', 'other', 'familiar', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'movies', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'BB', 'mentioned', 'interviews', 'was', 'filmed', 'more', 'chaotic', 'kenetic', 'style', 'most', 'films', 'was', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'subject', 'awesome', 'vintage', 'cars', 'were', 'great', 'look', 'lent', 'real', 'air', 'reality', 'actual', 'era', 'film', 'music', 'not', 'favorite', 'genre', 'not', 'true', 'time', 'story', 'least', 'recollections', 'did', 'much', 'photographic', 'style', 'definitely', 'match', 'flavor', 'film.I', 'have', 'heard', 'FNL', 'compared', ""'Hoosiers"", 'numerous', 'times', 'liked', ""'Hoosiers"", 'very', 'much', 'thought', ""'Friday"", 'Night', 'Lights', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'film', 'aspects', 'casting', 'photography', 'editing', 'storyline', 'performances', 'touching', 'story', 'care', 'town', 'game', 'coach', 'most', 'kids', 'living', 'stress-filled', 'lives', 'heros', 'misquided', 'town', 'carrying', 'tremendous', 'responsibility', 'guise', 'young', 'folks', 'have', 'fun', 'emotions', 'were', 'stimulated', 'opening', 'scenes', 'ending', 'updates', 'real-live-characters.While', 'much', 'FNL', 'was', 'bold', 'in-your-face', 'football', 'action', 'were', 'subtle', 'moments', 'well', 'Coach', 'Gaines', 'look', ""'kissed-fingers"", 'relayed', 'wife', 'game', 'definitely', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'total', 'relief', 'expressed', 'so', 'loud', 'clear', 'subtle', 'easy', 'sweet', 'smile', 'Mike', 'Winchell', 'when', 'finally', 'realized', 'weight', 'eight', 'years', 'playing', 'game', 'youth', 'football', 'was', 'finally', 'could', 'face', 'challenges', 'living', ""'real"", 'life', 'comparison', 'surely', 'felt', 'would', 'be', ""play'.I"", 'predict', 'classy', 'film', 'will', 'classic', 'sport', 'flick', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Bad', 'Santa', 'will', 'become', 'classic', 'cult', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'course', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'going', 'be', 'minds', 'hearts', 'years', 'come', 'body', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'fan', 'base', 'grow']",Friday Night Lights

630496,A2PUVEKTXWPAXC,B00005JNEW,Justin Wilkins,"[1, 1]","Taken from the nonfiction book of the same name, ""Friday Night Lights"" uses the real-life struggles of a Texas High School football team--with a few embellishments--skims over the tough subjects, and mixes the typical exhilarating/exaggerated Hollywood football with real footage to create film that is both realistic and intense.While most high school kids lack authority figures to guide them, the kids at Permian High have plenty of adults pushing them.  Pushing them to play football and play it well.  The star running back's future depends on it, the quarterback desires to play well so he can leave town, the fullback's father beats him for dropping the ball, and the rest of the team carries the weight of the town on its shoulders.  In one of the more poignant scenes, the kids discuss how they don't feel seventeen.  The film does an outstanding job of portraying football as life for the kids.  Unfortunately, it barely touches on the town's racism, grotesque amounts of money spent on football, grade inflation for players, and other negative elements surrounding the town's obsession. Instead it chooses to focus on the struggles of the team:  an injury to their star player, a loss to their rival, the coach's job security, etc.  Which isn't entirely bad, it makes for an uplifting story.Aesthetically, the film is above par compared to most football movies.  The camera work gives a true feel for what its like to be on the field, however, some of the tackles, and plays in general are overblown.  By the end it tends to look like a highlight reel.  But it is done for the audience and isn't unlike films such as ""Varsity Blues"" and ""Remember the Titans"".  The film's faults are forgivable and never outweigh its redeeming qualities.

630497,A1IOJE0W1NXOSE,B00005JNEW,Karen Potts,"[1, 2]","Friday Night Lights gives a good picture of small-town Texas where high school football is the most exciting thing around.  The whole town feels ownership in the team, and people don't hesitate to tell the coaches what to do, and the players, how to do it.  The end result, especially in a town like Odessa, where past successes fuel future aspirations, is a coach and players who are in a constant pressure-cooker.  The movie illustrates the different reactions which individuals have to these pressures.  Billy Bob Thorton, as the coach, is unfailingly polite to the townspeople, even when they track him down outside of Wal-Mart to give him advice.  He cares more about the boys' character than how many games they win, an attitude which is not always popular in Odessa.  His star player is a cocky young man who puts all of his hopes on obtaining a college scholarship and eventually playing in the pros.  When an injury ends this dream, he is shattered.  The quarterback is sincere and hard-working and loves football, but he hates the pressure of winning.  Another of the young players is constantly harrassed by his father who won a state championship and will stand for nothing less from his son.

And when you watch FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, you might feel a similar kind of emotional distance. By the final game, I wasn't really rooting for the Permian High Panthers to win; instead, I felt more like one of the spectators, objectively and dispassionately watching an event unfold. I admit, I was left a little cold by the movie at first.But, thinking about it since writing that review, I think I've come to appreciate its strengths much more strongly. FRIDAY NIGHTS LIGHTS is less about football, and maybe even less about its individual characters, than it is in portraying, with searing authenticity, how an economically-depressed small town like Odessa, Texas puts all their hopes and dreams on their high school football team. Thus, there are many scenes that have only the barest wisp of a connection to football, but instead show some of the individual players living their own lives. Don Billingsley, for instance, has to deal with an occasionally abusive drunkard father (played by Tim McGraw, in a surprisingly effective performance) who tells him straight out that if he and his team doesn't win the championship, there's not much left to look forward to in Odessa. And then there is the poor coach, Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), who has to deal with similar kinds of pressure from nearly a whole town. Scenes like the one in which Coach Gaines is stopped by some rude townspeople in front of a shopping mall all vividly show a town that has become so attached to their high school football team that their reasons for living---at least in Odessa---become tied to the team. That is what FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is about, and the way Peter Berg explores their subject---the sometimes-brutal character scenes, the vivid realism, the slightly washed-out quality to the film's colors that seem to comment on the town's loneliness---gives the movie a disturbing quality that goes far beyond the usual feel-good sports movie. (And the ending of this story is much more emotionally complex than is usual in these kinds of movies.)FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS may not be a great movie, but it is definitely about something much more than just football. It's about how desperate people can project their hopes and dreams on something even as trivial as high school football. Despite my misgivings about the way the moviemakers approached the characters in the film, I think overall FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is worth a look.

630499,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B00005JNEW,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Almost everything works in this portrait of the madness for and aroundhigh-school football in a small Texas town.One of the best sports movies I've seen, largely because it's not really aboutthe sport, or the big game, or winning and losing.  It's about growing up, lettinggo of dreams, the pressure adults put on kids to fulfill their own dreams, losingperspective and gaining it.  It seems to try and honestly look at both sides of highschool football; how it helps young men grow, challenge themselves and bond,but at the same time how it subjects them to physical harm, an unrealistic set ofexpectations about life after being a local star, and being forced to carry a wholetown on your shoulders when you're only 17.Some terrific visuals, both in the quick cutting ferocity of the games, and in thelong aerial views of the empty Texas plains.It does cheat in a few moments, trying to have it's cake and eat it too - a few plotlines are resolved a touch too easily or neatly, a few plot twists feel too familiarfrom other films.

630500,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JNEW,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 4]","On Friday night the only thing that happens in many small towns throughout America is high school football.  During the game the intense lights of parental desire for high achievement on the football field are pushed to a maximum through cheers and standing ovations on great plays by the athletes.  This pressure is a build up of parental and booster club demands on the coaches and the players with demands to win the Friday night game - every Friday night game.H. G. Bissinger decided to capture the atmosphere around the Friday night high school football games as he traveled to Odessa, Texas, in 1988.  This can be read in Bissinger's bestseller Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream, which is the foundation for the film.  In Odessa football is the most important issue of the town during the fall when the lights of Ratliff Stadium are lit.  All businesses close for the game as every single living soul congregates at the stadium to support the towns pride, the Permian Panther's.  However, the game is so much more than just a game, it becomes an outlet for parents and town folks.  The Permian High School athletes have to face these demands of parents, booster clubs, coaches, and the people of the town in what seems to be a struggle for life in a game of football.  The game seems to be the only way out of the town for the young high school students as football is encouraged above education.  The people of Odessa frantically try to achieve this opportunity for the players.  Thus, the goal is always to win the State Championship game.The journey to the State Championship becomes a long and hard trial of emotional and physical stamina on the young high school players as on and off field behavior is being scrutinized in regards to football.  The story focuses on a small number of players that become the mirror image of the whole team.  A couple of these players are James ""Boobie"" Miles (Derek Luke), Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund).  Boobie is a rare talent in football, but football is also the only thing that he knows, while the quarterback, Mike, has a sick mother that frequently requires his attention.  These boys on the football team are pushed into an environment where they are turned into men as it is their last year of high school.The director Peter Berg portrays Bissinger's written account through a cinematic experience that is depicted with grainy realism that does not hide the ugliness or the heroic effort by the high school athletes as they try to meet the demands of Odessa.  Berg brings the audience into the locker room where the viewer can visually smell the sweat, feel the emotions, and suffer the pain of each tackle. There is no mystique to what happens in the film and it is this visual frankness that punches the air out the gut of the audience.  Lastly, Berg does not display deep intricate character development, but focuses on the social dilemma of all the characters and the environment in which the story takes place.  In the end, Berg offers the audience a great cinematic experience that requires reflection as this coming of age sports film deals with several issues that are smacked into the viewers face.",4,Terrific Smashmouth Coming of Age Sports Film...,1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,3213,"['Friday', 'night', 'only', 'thing', 'many', 'small', 'towns', 'America', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'game', 'intense', 'lights', 'parental', 'desire', 'high', 'achievement', 'football', 'field', 'are', 'pushed', 'maximum', 'cheers', 'standing', 'ovations', 'great', 'plays', 'athletes', 'pressure', 'build', 'parental', 'booster', 'club', 'coaches', 'players', 'demands', 'win', 'Friday', 'night', 'game', 'Friday', 'night', 'game.H', 'G.', 'Bissinger', 'decided', 'capture', 'atmosphere', 'Friday', 'night', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'games', 'traveled', 'Odessa', 'Texas', '1988', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'Bissinger', 'bestseller', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Town', 'Team', 'Dream', 'foundation', 'film', 'Odessa', 'football', 'most', 'important', 'issue', 'town', 'fall', 'when', 'lights', 'Ratliff', 'Stadium', 'are', 'lit', 'businesses', 'close', 'game', 'single', 'living', 'soul', 'stadium', 'support', 'towns', 'pride', 'Permian', 'Panther', 'However', 'game', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'game', 'outlet', 'parents', 'town', 'folks', 'Permian', 'High', 'School', 'athletes', 'have', 'face', 'demands', 'parents', 'booster', 'clubs', 'coaches', 'people', 'town', 'what', 'be', 'struggle', 'life', 'game', 'football', 'game', 'be', 'only', 'way', 'town', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'football', 'encouraged', 'education', 'people', 'Odessa', 'frantically', 'try', 'achieve', 'opportunity', 'players', 'Thus', 'goal', 'always', 'win', 'State', 'Championship', 'game.The', 'journey', 'State', 'Championship', 'long', 'hard', 'trial', 'emotional', 'physical', 'stamina', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'players', 'field', 'behavior', 'being', 'scrutinized', 'regards', 'football', 'story', 'small', 'number', 'players', 'become', 'mirror', 'image', 'whole', 'team', 'couple', 'players', 'are', 'James', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Mike', 'Winchell', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Don', 'Billingsley', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Boobie', 'rare', 'talent', 'football', 'football', 'also', 'only', 'thing', 'quarterback', 'Mike', 'sick', 'mother', 'frequently', 'attention', 'boys', 'football', 'team', 'are', 'pushed', 'environment', 'where', 'are', 'turned', 'men', 'last', 'year', 'high', 'school.The', 'director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Bissinger', 'written', 'account', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'depicted', 'grainy', 'realism', 'not', 'hide', 'ugliness', 'heroic', 'effort', 'high', 'school', 'athletes', 'try', 'meet', 'demands', 'Odessa', 'Berg', 'audience', 'locker', 'room', 'where', 'viewer', 'can', 'visually', 'smell', 'sweat', 'feel', 'emotions', 'suffer', 'pain', 'tackle', 'mystique', 'what', 'film', 'visual', 'frankness', 'air', 'gut', 'audience', 'Lastly', 'Berg', 'not', 'display', 'deep', 'intricate', 'character', 'development', 'social', 'dilemma', 'characters', 'environment', 'story', 'place', 'end', 'Berg', 'audience', 'great', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'reflection', 'coming', 'age', 'sports', 'film', 'deals', 'several', 'issues', 'are', 'smacked', 'viewers', 'face']",Friday Night Lights

This movie is based on a true story about a high school football team in Odessa, Texas in 1988 that chronicles one important season in the lives of the players, their coach, and the rest of the people in the town. Billy Bob Thornton (who recently seen as Davy Crockett in ""The Alamo"" (2004) and also starred as Karl Childers in his directorial debut ""Sling Blade"" (1996) plays Coach Gary Gaines, the high school football team's coach. Derek Luke (who played Antwone Fisher in ""Antwone Fisher"" (2002) plays Jimmy ""Boobie"" Miles, the star player and tailback for the team. Jay Hernandez (who recently starred as Keith Perez in ""Ladder 49"" (2004) plays Brian Chavez, the fullback for the team. Lucas Black (who also starred with Billy Bob Thornton as Frank Wheatley in Thornton's directorial debut ""Sling Blade"" (1996), plays Mike Winchell, the team's quarterback.

Tim McGraw, making his film debut, as Charles Billingsley, gives an mind-blowing performance, and it also is one of the best performances of any actor this year, even if he is a country singer, it proves that he is an excellent actor. All of the actors give Oscar-worthy performances, especially, Thornton, McGraw, Luke, and Black. This is an excellent sports movie, that is one of the best sport movies of its kind and it is one of the year's best. The directing by Peter Burg (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is superb and excellent. This is his best movie he's directed, thus far. He also directed last year's hit ""The Rundown"" (2003), which starred The Rock. The screenplay by David Aaron Cohen (who also wrote the screenplay to ""The Devil's Own"" (1997) & Peter Burg, based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, who is, weirdly enough, Burg's 2nd cousin, is excellent. The music by Explosions In The Sky is excellent. The cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler (who also did the cinematography to Berg's hit ""The Rundown"" (2003) is excellent. The film editing by Colby Parker Jr. & David Rosenbloom (who recently film edited ""The Last Shot"" (2004).

630507,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JNEW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[38, 48]","I live in Minnesota, where high school hockey is the state religion and the right of passage for seniors is to go to the State Tournament, even if there school does not make it that far.  Parents (not just fathers) send their sons to live in other school districts so they can get more playing time or play with a better team.  Everyone who has seen ""Hoosiers"" know that in Indiana it is high school basketball that is the subject of such devotion, but if you needed to see ""Friday Night Lights"" to know that neither of those state religions holds a candle to high school football in Texas, then you are just not a true sports fan.  Even before H.G. Bissinger's Pulitzer Prize winning book, ""Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team and a Dream,"" I knew the people of West Texas took their high school football seriously (I lived in New Mexico when I went to high school, so it would have been hard not to notice).Director Peter Berg's film version of ""Friday Night Lights"" is based on the true story of the Odessa-Permian Panthers and their 1988 season.  What ""true"" means in this case is that the name of the coach and the key players are accurate, as are the number of losses the Panthers had that year (although the scores are different, as is one of the opponents).  Overall, the film avoids going Hollywood until the final game, which does manage to be true to the spirit of the film even if it requires a stupid play call to help things along (I am sorry, but if it is 4th down and half the length of a football to go, and your offensive line outweighs the defense by at least 50 pounds a person, you call a quarterback sneak and get a least a yard more than you need just by firing off the ball; at least, that is what my father has always told me and since he played college football for an undefeated team, Trinity in Connecticut, I tend to listen to him).This film affirms, for the upteenth time, that the main thing wrong with sports involving kids are the adults, either in the form of the parents, or the concerned citizens whose support of coach is based primarily on the score of the last game.  The prototypical parent in this story is Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), who has his state championship ring and makes it clear that his son, Don (Garrett Hedlund), will be a failure if he does not do the same.  Unfortunately, Don has a tendency to fumble, so Charles has no problem going down onto the field during practice to set the boy straight.  Is Don playing football for his dad or despite his dad?  There is no easy answer to that question, because life, family, and football are all wrapped up together in Odessa, Texas.  The town might be mired in an economic depression, but that does not stop them from having a football stadium bigger than what some colleges and universities enjoy.Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is supposed to go undefeated and win the state championship.  Perham has done this four times before, in 1965, 1976, 1980, and 1984.  Apparently they have a four year crop rotation program going and everybody in town can do the math to figure out 1988 is going to be the year.  When the Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) the star running back gets hurt the coach gets the blame even though it is clear, like in a classic Greek tragedy, that the Fates are punishing the sin of hubris.  Boobie is all ready to spend his money for playing in the NFL and he has not even picked a college yet.  Basking in his stardom, Boobie gladly admits to reporters that he gets straight A's because he is an athlete and as he leaves defenders in the wake of his sweet moves you can understand why he is the most important play for Permian.  But the goddess of mischief hides the helmet of his backup Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young), and everybody knows that when you are running the score up and keep your superstar in the game, somebody is going to go gunning for him.There are several key factors that make ""Friday Night Lights"" work.  The first is Thornton's performance, which is yet another reminder that he is one of the finest film actors around today.  His Coach Gaines goes between moments of screaming at his players in the grand tradition of football coaches going back to Knute Rockne and beyond and measured silences as he endures another rabid fan excoriating him on talk radio or the ""For Sale"" signs that have sprung up in his front yard after a loss.  But there are also moments when the speaks from the heart, whether it is to his quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) in the squalid home the kid shares with his mentally disturbed mother (Connie Cooper), or the final halftime speech to his team.  What distinguishes Gaines from every other man in the story is that he knows that in the end, football is just a game.  He just has to be careful about who he shares this particular bit of wisdom with during the season.Berg makes a brilliant decision to shoot this story as if it were a documentary.  This works well in the extended game sequences, but suits the rest of the film as well, which is important because the most important moments in ""Friday Night Lights"" come at other times.  Some of the best scenes take place away from the lighted field as Boobie and his uncle (Grover Coulson) deal with the disappearance of the dream during a visit to a doctor, when the garbage truck makes it rounds, and when the kid cleans out his locker.  This leads to the third key factor, which is that we care about the kids that the story focuses on, including the silent ""Preacher"" (Lee Jackson) and the kid who is going to Harvard to become a lawyer, Brain Chavez (Jay Hernandez).  We do not care about the fans or the families or the rest of the town, just the kids, and their performances match those of Thornton in providing a realism that we just do not get in most of the films in the sports genre.I really liked this movie until the end, where the action and the emotions smack too much of Hollywood, not to mention David versus Goliath, than what had been established up to that point.  Still, in the end Berg focuses exactly where he should, on the kids who have finished their high school football careers and the coach who has to immediately start planning for next year, when Odessa-Permian would again undertake the sacred quest for perfection.",4,A thoughtful meditation on the state religion of Texas,1097971200,"10 17, 2004",2004,6291,"['live', 'Minnesota', 'where',

It is about a town that is obsessed with high school football.  That sounds sick already, doesn't it.  The entire town lives vicariously through the high school football team.  What a foolish bunch of people.  Do we have people in our country who are that stupid?  Do we really have entire towns of insane morons?There is so little going on in these people's lives that the only worthwhile thing between the cradle and the grave is for each new crop of varsity high schoolers to win the state championship.  Hahahahahaha.  Damn.  Where is Kevorkian when we need him!  Let these morons kill themselves, do them a favor.Tim McGraw's character, a former HS football hero, explains to his son, a current player, that the only event in his life that has any meaning at all is the attainment of the state championship.  After that, you spend the rest of your life remembering your one event, as you sit in your coffin and wait for the next 60 years to pass.I hope there is a pizza shop that will deliver to the boy's coffin for the next 60 years, and bottles to pee in, since it is hardly worth getting up, now that the varsity football season is done.The football scenes are done well.  The coach is likeable.  The players, as people, are pathetic.  What was in their future?  One of them played for Auburn, or somewhere or other, for a year.  So at least his life wasn't a total waste.  The rest of the team sold life insurance and ordered pizza.  We need to nuke this town to do everyone in it a favor.  It would be a mercy killing.Come to think of it, Heaven does sound nice.  Wouldn't you like to visit Heaven this evening?  I sure would.  The only problem is I'm not sure how the tv reception is there, and I might miss the local channel broadcasting the effing high school football game.Does anyone really sit through those boring games?  High school players are pretty awful, if you are used to the pros.  I'd much rather watch a gifted athlete than the big klutz of a kid three blocks over.High school football is so bad that if I suited up and played for one of the teams I wouldn't necessarily lose the game for my team.  They really aren't that much better than me.  I would make a few decent plays in a high school game, tackle somebody, block somebody, get out of it in one piece more or less.The moral of this movie is that some people, in some towns, are just plain nuts.  A second moral is that our own lives, devoid of high school heroism, aren't worth living.  Just look at the poor guy who had so much athletic ability and then was injured.  Don't we feel sorry for him.  He almost lived a life worth living.  Well, maybe he enjoyed his kids as they grew up.  Pretty piss poor second prize, little consolation.Despite all my criticisms, which I believe are valid, this is a good movie.  I gave it three stars, and I opened my review by saying it is absorbing and interesting.  It's not my fault that some people think high school football is the most important thing in their lives.  That is a pretty moronic attitude if you really think about it.

Billy Bob Thornton is the coach and his acting, as usual, is excellent.  So is that of the cast of young men who play the football players.  It's easy to see why their whole lives are wrapped up in winning this championship.  There's nothing else in this town that will ever give them any glory.  This is their moment and they have to use it to the maximum.This point is brought out over and over again - that for these boys - there is no life other than football.  It is especially demonstrated in the relationship of one of the boys and his father.  The father is an abusive drunk who treats the boy badly because the boy fumbles the ball. It seems that years before, the father was on a winning team and won a state championship ring.  After that, his life had no meaning and he truly believed that if the boy didn't come out of this football season a winner, there would be no other way for the boy to be able to succeed.The script was good and did hold my interest but I felt I had seen it all before.  There's the best player on the team who sustains an injury.  There's the competition between the boys. There's a social life of sorts.  And, of course, there is the tough-love coach who encourages them throughout.The script is good too, maintaining the tension throughout.Sorry though.  I was bored.  Maybe it's because I'm not a football lover.  Maybe it's because even though I understood how much the game meant to the boys, I'm just too far away from the Odessa Texas lifestyle to really feel their passion in my gut. It was a good film too.

Its a very gritty look of the town, its people and how they played the game of football through their kids. It also a look of how these kids pursued their dreams of glory regardless of the cost. The movie centered around few characters from the team, to its coach, his quarterback, fumble inclined back up running back to a cocky superb running back who was injured.The movie have been watered down quite a bit from the book which must have angered the people of Odessa, Texas to no end when it was first published. I thought the feel was very authentic and it was successful in showing the rest of the world how seriously some people take high school football. (Probably no more then how many people in other parts of the world take soccer so seriously or in Japan where high school baseball take on mythical level.)Billy Bob Thornton did an excellent job portarying the head coach, Gary Grimes. In fact, he have been watered down from the book version pretty considerably. Lucus Black playes Boobie Miles very well. Of course, this is not exactly a very likable character in the beginning. Shallow, uneducated braggart who represent all that was wrong with star high school football player who only think football. Many in the audience reacted to his injury on the field with certain satisfaction. But ironically, Miles character developed into something truly worthy after he realized that his playing time was over and it was interesting to see this shallow braggart developed into a whole human being.I initially thought that this was another ""Hoosier"" type of movie but I was mistaken.

The film makes clear that Odessa is one of those West Texas towns where high school football is more than the community religion.  Nothing in Odessa matters other than winning the state football championship.  I wonder how the next Einstein or Condoleeza Rice or Colin Powell would react to being raised in such a community. All individual and community self-esteem is tied up in this single-minded goal.  Former Permian players parade around town proudly displaying THEIR state championship rings, and there seems to be no other source of community pride.  There is no sense of the Olympic ideal ""the essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well"".  The well-fought fight is not appreciated in Odessa and the film is filled with scenes where Head Coach Gaines (in a wonderful performance by Billy Bob Thornton) is reminded over and over by community leaders that anything less than a state championship is unacceptable.I always wonder about individuals and groups who tie so much of their own happiness to the outcome of sporting events.  Thornton gives us brief glimpses at the idea that Coach Gaines recognizes that even the State Championship Game is, after all, only a game.A group of barely-known actors make up the team.  We recognize the more grownup Lucas Black (the kid from ""Sling Blade"") once again paired with Billy Bob, this time as the quarterback filled with self-doubts, even as he leads the Panthers to the State play-offs.  Derek Luke brings his chiseled body to the part of Boobie Miles, the star running back who is on the fast track to the NFL - until he tears his knee up with a mixture of bad luck and bravado.  Grover Coulson is terrific as Boobie's Uncle L.V., who took over raising the young man after Boobie's parents were out of the picture.  L.V. clearly wants what's best for Boobie, but you can also see that he knows Boobie is so close to the NFL and it's riches that he can taste it. The most heartbreaking scene in the film comes after Boobie is evaluated by an out of town Orthopedist who tells Boobie that his ACL is torn and he won't be able to cut any more, then Boobie and L.V. get together to mislead Coach Gaines into thinking that Boobie will be able to play.Garrett Hedlund stars as the other running back with a tendency to drop the ball and with an abusive alcoholic father who flashes his own State Championship Ring between drunken fits of child abuse.  Tim McGraw continues the Billy Bob connection by having another well-known country singer playing a scumbag.  (Following Sling Blades' Dwight Yoakum.) The DVD includes a documentary about the ""real"" Panthers and suggests that the ""real"" Charles Billingsley was only intense rather than an abusive drunk.The film is shot like a documentary, and it was about 15 minutes into the movie before it started feeling like a movie at all.  This adds to the ""realism"", but also creates a little shakiness to the viewing experience as hand-held camera shots wiggle the main characters through the frame.I knew nothing about the ""real"" story before seeing the film, but it is clear that you are moving toward a State Championship Game - and early on you see that the opponents are going to be a team from Dallas made up of players that look like they outweight the Panthers by about 50 pounds per player.  The Panther's trip to the big game hits a few speed bumps while the team from Dallas looks like an unbeatable behemoth.By the end of the film I had the reassuring sense that as a result of this season the community of Odessa had a better appreciation for the ""well fought fight"".

630516,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JNEW,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","I've never been a big fan of sports but I have enjoyed far too many sports films. Some of them I came across quite by accident or due to friend's recommendations. Others I had to see because of where I lived (HOOSIERS was directed by local resident transplanted to LA David Anspaugh). The fact is that while I never enjoyed the sports so much, I always appreciated what it was that was going on. And the movies made about sports have for the most part always turned out well.But this movie takes things one step further than most. It gets to the heart of the game as well as the downside without using the usual contrivances of most films. Some may appear to be those, but upon closer examination you can find the differences. The big game, the problematic team member, the tough as nails coach. All are here but not quite like you may have seen them before.Billy Bob Thornton stars as coach Gary Gaines, the coach of the Permian High Panthers from Odessa, TX. The town of Odessa worships the ground that their players walk on. Why? Because there is nothing or little else to do or find in Odessa.This year the team has the chance to make it all the way, to be the state champs. And all hopes are residing on the shoulders of one player, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), a player who is not only filled with talent but with an ego to match. The team rallies behind Boobie and knows that they are going to win. That is until an injury sidelines Boobie...for good.Now if the team is to make it, they must work together and work hard to get there. The battle is not one won by an individual, but won by the team. And each and every one works in their own way to get there.The film offers us glimpses into the lives of the players, but none to the extent that the story becomes each individual's. Instead, it shows their trial and tribulation but keeps coming back to the team and the efforts they make to become winners. Rather than become absorbed in the off the field dramas of each, the film focuses on what goes on ON the field. It is perhaps the best shot look at football on the field that I have seen.  It draws you in and places you on the field with the team, rooting for them all the way.You feel it all in this film. The pressures to perform coming from coach and community, the need to win, the desire to be their best, the confusion of becoming a ""star"" in the local school and community that is passed on to these gridiron heroes. And right smack in the middle of it all is the heart that beats loud and clear, the heart that shows these youngsters were there not for the fame and glory but because they felt the need within themselves to be their best.The film is based on the best seller by author H.G.Bissinger and based on the true story. While I am certain an amount of liberties were taken with this book, the soul is very much seen on film. One great extra on the DVD is the inclusion of a look at the players as they are today. The question of what happened to Boobie Miles after his misfortune is answered as are what became of the other teammates involved. The movie is part touching, part sports like violence and part examination of what goes on in the lives of teen sports heroes. But above all else, it is a movie that draws you in and holds you tight until the clock ticks down the final seconds of the game.",4,ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,3328,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'sports', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'sports', 'films', 'came', 'quite', 'accident', 'due', 'friend', 'recommendations', 'Others', 'had', 'see', 'where', 'lived', 'HOOSIERS', 'was', 'directed', 'local', 'resident', 'transplanted', 'LA', 'David', 'Anspaugh', 'fact', 'never', 'enjoyed', 'sports', 'so', 'much', 'always', 'appreciated', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'going', 'movies', 'made', 'sports', 'have', 'most', 'part', 'always', 'turned', 'out', 'well.But', 'movie', 'things', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'most', 'heart', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'downside', 'using', 'usual', 'contrivances', 'most', 'films', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'closer', 'examination', 'can', 'find', 'differences', 'big', 'game', 'problematic', 'team', 'member', 'tough', 'nails', 'coach', 'are', 'here', 'not', 'quite', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'before.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'coach', 'Gary', 'Gaines', 'coach', 'Permian', 'High', 'Panthers', 'Odessa', 'TX', 'town', 'Odessa', 'ground', 'players', 'walk', 'Why', 'nothing', 'little', 'else', 'do', 'find', 'Odessa.This', 'year', 'team', 'chance', 'make', 'way', 'be', 'state', 'champs', 'hopes', 'are', 'residing', 'shoulders', 'one', 'player', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'player', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'filled', 'talent', 'ego', 'match', 'team', 'Boobie', 'are', 'going', 'win', 'injury', 'sidelines', 'Boobie', 'good.Now', 'team', 'make', 'must', 'work', 'together', 'work', 'hard', 'get', 'there', 'battle', 'not', 'one', 'won', 'individual', 'won', 'team', 'one', 'works', 'own', 'way', 'get', 'there.The', 'film', 'offers', 'lives', 'players', 'none', 'extent', 'story', 'individual', 'Instead', 'trial', 'tribulation', 'coming', 'back', 'team', 'efforts', 'make', 'become', 'winners', 'Rather', 'become', 'absorbed', 'off', 'field', 'dramas', 'film', 'ON', 'field', 'perhaps', 'best', 'shot', 'look', 'football', 'field', 'have', 'seen', 'places', 'field', 'team', 'rooting', 'way.You', 'feel', 'film', 'pressures', 'perform', 'coming', 'coach', 'community', 'need', 'win', 'desire', 'be', 'best', 'confusion', 'becoming', 'star', 'local', 'school', 'community', 'passed', 'gridiron', 'heroes', 'right', 'smack', 'middle', 'heart', 'loud', 'clear', 'heart', 'youngsters', 'were', 'there', 'not', 'fame', 'glory', 'felt', 'need', 'be', 'best.The', 'film', 'based', 'best', 'seller', 'author', 'H.G.Bissinger', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'am', 'certain', 'amount', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', 'book', 'soul', 'very', 'much', 'seen', 'film', 'One', 'great', 'extra', 'DVD', 'inclusion', 'look', 'players', 'are', 'today', 'question', 'what', 'happened', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'misfortune', 'answered', 'are', 'what', 'became', 'other', 'teammates', 'involved', 'movie', 'part', 'touching', 'part', 'sports', 'violence', 'part', 'examination', 'what', 'lives', 'teen', 'sports', 'heroes', 'else', 'movie', 'tight', 'clock', 'ticks', 'down', 'final', 'seconds', 'game']",Friday Night Lights

And I'm not ashamed to admit that I am totally taken in by the Disney-style, get hyped-up, go-for-it, ultimate release, feel-good movies exemplified by Hoosiers, Remember the Titans, the Rookie, and Miracle (for example), and I have quite a nice DVD sports collection.  So ""one of the best sports movies of all time"" was high on my list for viewing--- and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.  I have no argument with the actors; Thornton delivers a largely understated performance (except for the screaming), nor do I havea problem with the whole ""win the whole thing"" mentality.  I appreciate that the movie really focused more on the dangers of obsession rather than football, and perhaps that's what made it disappointing: instead of getting excited and rah-rah, I was depressed.  I don't care that they didn't adhere religiously to the facts (what movie does?  It's a movie and should be enjoyed [or not] based on its own merits).  Even the ""be perfect"" speech at the end, the redemption of just being as good a person as you can be, came too late.  Why tell the boys to be perfect all season (implying that they must win each game) and then define ""perfection"" with a half-hour of football left in the year?  The ultimate redemption just fell flat.  Rocky lost his match at the end of the (first, of course) movie, and you still jumped up and cheered.  I could care less about these guys.  And that made me sad.  This movie, I'm sorry to say, is not on my ""best sports movies of all time"" list.  Not even close.  For the record, my number 1 is Bull Durham.

630519,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005JNEW,M. Burns,"[1, 1]","Billy Bob Thorton is an actor that creates a rare psychological effect in the movies he makes. In his best roles (1998's A Simple Plan, 2001's Monster's Ball, this movie) he is so understated and so quietly graceful that the movie goes on around him and the awareness that a great actor is before us disappears. In Friday Night Lights, Thorton occupies such a low-key wavelength that I'm still wondering why he got that starring credit. It's a testament to the pitch-perfect casting of the film, and the wonderful young actors who play the roles, that any supporting player could have had his name in bold on the poster and it would have made sense.In Lights, Thorton is coach Gary Gaines, the mastermind behind the football juggernaut in Odessa Texas: the Permian Panthers. Gaines is at the head of a team with state championships under its belt, a gigantic reputation in its desolated surroundings, and a football stadium that dwarfs everything within miles of it. This is not Gaines' movie, though; Lights wisely focuses in on the young men who make up the team and the way their lives shape what goes into the game. The best performance of the movie belongs to quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), whose precise Texas drawl and shy personality make for a fascinating contrast with the louder guys on the team. Speaking of louder guys: there's Derek Luke of Antwone Fisher who plays Boobie Miles, the superstar of the team who gets a little life lesson of his own once the season begins.It's actual history, the fall of 1988, but David Aaron Cohen's adaptation of the book by H.G. Bissinger brings the inhabitants of the team and the town alive so that a real narrative progresses before your eyes. But the central idea behind Lights that you might have before seeing it is misleading: this is not a movie about a triumphant football team who starts a losing streak and has it all come down to a defining moment at state championships. Lights is a bittersweet tale of the disappointment, uncertainty, and occasional bleakness that accompanies a life totally consumed by a sport. The movie doesn't turn a head away from the fact that, yeah, some football players can't read really well (a particularly triumphant moment in my own mind :) ), they often go on to drive trucks and sell insurance instead of playing pro ball, and sometimes things are such a damn letdown you can't do anything but yank off your helmet and crash into a ball of heaving sobs.Friday Night Lights has moments of searing brilliance, propelled forward with an atmospheric musical score, but in the end it fails to make that final leap into greatness that it could have. I can't help but admire this film, though, for its bravery in the story that it has to tell. This is not the uplifting sports movie that will run over and over again on TBS a few years from now. This is a 'sports movie' that I thought about for quite a while after leaving the theater. With football, it seems it's all about winning; what Friday Night Lights makes us realize is that there's often more loss, in the very deepest sense of the word.

The most heartwrenching scene is when Derek Luke (who plays the self-confident and talented ""Boobie"" Miles) knows his season, and time playing football is over, and goes to clean out his locker. He's all smiles, and confidence, telling his teammates to be perfect and win. But as soon as he walks outside the school, and joins his uncle in his car, he breaks down. Football is all I have, he cries, it's all I can do, and his uncle holds him. I have rarely seen such a powerful scene. I don't cry at movies, but I fought to hold in tears. Derek Luke is a largely overrated actor and deserves to be a star. I've seen reviews that unforgivingly didn't even mention his name among the cast. The other sad, moving storyline is that of the second-string running back, whose abusive, alcoholic father is played by singer Tim McGraw. What this film doesn't have is a happy ending, and cliche-ridden sports formulas that sink most sports movies. It's all the more powerful for that. It's a bleak, almost depressing movie because you know for the vast majority of kids in this rural town (that lives precariously through high school kids who are expected to play to perfection) are going to go nowhere, to sink into working class lives. Weeks later after seeing it, I still can't shake the images and sounds of seeing Billingsley and Miles struggling under the weight of expectation and knowing they most likely live in a dead-end town.",3,Sad movie delving into heartbreaking reality behind game,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,1541,"['have', 'strong', 'taste', 'realistic', 'movies', 'must', 'say', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'almost', 'brought', 'tears', 'most', 'heartwrenching', 'scene', 'when', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'who', 'self-confident', 'talented', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'season', 'time', 'playing', 'football', 'clean', 'out', 'locker', 'smiles', 'confidence', 'telling', 'teammates', 'be', 'perfect', 'win', 'as', 'soon', 'school', 'uncle', 'car', 'down', 'Football', 'have', 'can', 'do', 'uncle', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'powerful', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'movies', 'fought', 'hold', 'tears', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'largely', 'overrated', 'actor', 'be', 'star', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'unforgivingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'name', 'cast', 'other', 'sad', 'moving', 'storyline', 'second-string', 'running', 'back', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'played', 'singer', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'What', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'cliche-ridden', 'sports', 'formulas', 'sink', 'most', 'sports', 'movies', 'more', 'powerful', 'bleak', 'almost', 'depressing', 'movie', 'know', 'vast', 'majority', 'kids', 'rural', 'town', 'precariously', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'expected', 'play', 'perfection', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'nowhere', 'sink', 'working', 'class', 'lives', 'Weeks', 'later', 'seeing', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'images', 'sounds', 'seeing', 'Billingsley', 'Miles', 'struggling', 'weight', 'expectation', 'knowing', 'most', 'likely', 'live', 'dead-end', 'town']",Friday Night Lights
630524,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005JNEW,Michael Butts,"[2, 4]","As Coach Billy Bob Thornton tells his players, being perfect is not about winning, it's about playing for the other players, and doing the best you can.  With that in mind, director Peter Berg's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a perfect sports movie.  If you're not a football fanatic (which I am not), it becomes mystical as to how a sport can be such a religious experience for small towns.  Stores close down for games; everyone tries to tell the coach how to coach; what should be a carefree bunch of 17 year old boys becomes a collection of sour-faced, fatalistic young men who fear that if they don't win the state championship, their lives have no meaning.  One of the most disturbing lines in the film comes from the voice of a radio sportscaster who is chiding the coach for playing an injured player, and he adds, ""There's too much learning in schools.""  How sad that students are judged not on their academic merits, but how well they catch or throw a pigskin.  While I certainly recognize the need for athletics in school, the fanaticism exhibited in movies like this can only reinforce how overemphasized it can be.  And how violent and mean.  Players intentionally try to hurt other players, and the adults become like children in their overzealous attempts to relive their lives through these spirited boys.As a movie, though, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS works because of the extremely talented cast Berg was fortunate enough to come up with.  Thornton is brilliant as the coach, who feels his whole coaching career rides on winning this big game; all of the boys are superb, but special notice should be given to Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund and Jay Hernandez.  Their heart and soul provides the true foundation of the movie's team.  Derek Luke as Boobie strikes a one note performance until his wonderful scene where he breaks down and says he doesn't know how to do anything but play football.  (Another sign of the academic system's failure to promote education as well as sports).  And of course, the surprisingly effective performance of country singer Tim McGraw as the brutal father whose own upbringing echoes in the sad treatment of his son who just can't seem to hold on to the ball.  It's a brave performance for this superstar:  he struts around shirtless, without the kind of physique one would expect; he doesn't mind playing a sleazeball to contradict his heroic status in the country music market.  He's very good and should try some more roles in the future.The movie has a lot of heart and it's ending only reinforces how unfair life can be sometimes.  If you are a football fanatic, this movie should be right up your alley, but if you're not one, you should still appreciate the immense amount of effort our young boys put into the sport, and how being perfect can make it better.",5,THE PERFECT TEAM,1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,2799,"['Coach', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'players', 'being', 'perfect', 'not', 'winning', 'playing', 'other', 'players', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'mind', 'director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'perfect', 'sports', 'movie', ""'re"", 'not', 'football', 'fanatic', 'am', 'not', 'mystical', 'how', 'sport', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'religious', 'experience', 'small', 'towns', 'Stores', 'close', 'down', 'games', 'everyone', 'tell', 'coach', 'how', 'coach', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'carefree', 'bunch', '17', 'year', 'old', 'collection', 'sour-faced', 'fatalistic', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'fear', 'do', ""n't"", 'win', 'state', 'championship', 'lives', 'have', 'meaning', 'One', 'most', 'disturbing', 'lines', 'film', 'voice', 'radio', 'sportscaster', 'who', 'chiding', 'coach', 'playing', 'injured', 'player', 'too', 'much', 'learning', 'schools', 'How', 'sad', 'students', 'are', 'judged', 'not', 'academic', 'merits', 'how', 'well', 'catch', 'throw', 'pigskin', 'certainly', 'recognize', 'need', 'athletics', 'school', 'fanaticism', 'exhibited', 'movies', 'can', 'only', 'reinforce', 'how', 'overemphasized', 'can', 'be', 'how', 'violent', 'mean', 'Players', 'intentionally', 'try', 'hurt', 'other', 'players', 'adults', 'become', 'children', 'overzealous', 'attempts', 'relive', 'lives', 'spirited', 'boys.As', 'movie', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'extremely', 'talented', 'cast', 'Berg', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'come', 'up', 'Thornton', 'brilliant', 'coach', 'who', 'whole', 'coaching', 'career', 'rides', 'winning', 'big', 'game', 'boys', 'are', 'superb', 'special', 'notice', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'heart', 'soul', 'true', 'foundation', 'movie', 'team', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Boobie', 'one', 'note', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'where', 'down', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'anything', 'play', 'football', 'sign', 'academic', 'system', 'failure', 'promote', 'education', 'as', 'well', 'sports', 'course', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'performance', 'country', 'singer', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'brutal', 'father', 'own', 'upbringing', 'echoes', 'sad', 'treatment', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hold', 'ball', 'brave', 'performance', 'superstar', 'shirtless', 'kind', 'physique', 'one', 'would', 'expect', ""n't"", 'mind', 'playing', 'sleazeball', 'contradict', 'heroic', 'status', 'country', 'music', 'market', 'very', 'good', 'should', 'try', 'more', 'roles', 'future.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'heart', 'ending', 'only', 'how', 'unfair', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'sometimes', 'are', 'football', 'fanatic', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', ""'re"", 'not', 'one', 'should', 'still', 'appreciate', 'immense', 'amount', 'effort', 'young', 'boys', 'put', 'sport', 'how', 'being', 'perfect', 'can', 'make', 'better']",Friday Night Lights

They are one of the best teams in West Texas, and Friday nights are for high school football.  Everything in town stops so that all can go to the game.  Tremendous pressure is put on the kids and the coaches to win.  The star of the team is James ""Boobie"" Miles (Luke), a cocky kid who definately believes all the hype about him until a early season knee injury turns his world on end.  Stepping up to fill the void are quarterback Mike Winchell (Black) and running backs Don Billingsley (Hedlund) and Chris Comer (Young).  But will they have what it takes to fill that void?  Coach Gary Gaines (Thornton) thinks so, and as the season moves on, he finds himself receiving both the love and the hatred of the town depending on whether they are winning or losing.There is a lot going on in this movie, both on and off the field, and the story flows smoothly back and forth.  After all, everything going on off the field is still football related, and plays into the story quite prominently.  Running through it all is the immense pressure to win.  This is not your typical sports movie, and the final game drives home the point of the whole movie.  This is a very good movie, with solid performances all around, expecially by the mostly unknow actors playing the kids.  This movie is for anyone who has ever been involved in the phenomenon of high school football.  For those people, it will strike a real chord.

Bissinger, who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin. In 1988, Bissinger followed the Permian Panthers, a high school football team and pride of the West Texas town of Odessa, through a tough season on and off the field. The citizens of Odessa hang their hopes and identity on their football team. Many men of the older generations wear State Championship rings that symbolize their lives' greatest accomplishment. The young Panthers are treated as celebrities. And they are expected to win. ""Friday Night Lights"" focuses on three young men: The reserved, anxious quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), who must lead the team through tough times and take care of his needy mother. Cocky ""Boobie"" Miles (Derek Luke), the team's star running back and NFL hopeful. And Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), a  running back with fumbling problems, whose alcoholic father (Tim McGraw), a former player himself, berates him for every small failure. The coach who is expected in no uncertain terms to lead the team to the State Championship was Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), a man who is reserved off the field, intense on it, and whose every decision is scrutinized by townspeople fixated on their team.""Friday Night Lights"" will be remembered as one of the great sports movies. For football fans, it's a joy to watch. The Permian Panther's remarkable 1988 season exemplifies the excitement, the commitment, the pain, the thrills, and the anguish that make sports a universal attraction, if not an obsession. Emotionally captivating portrayals of the players suck the audience in. Billy Bob Thornton does a fantastic job of communicating consistently complex emotions in a man who speaks very little. The film's final game is one of the most riveting I've seen in a movie. According to director Peter Berg, 95% of the film was shot handheld, but the camera does not shake inappropriately. The candid depiction of characters at a significant time in their lives, the relationship of the town to the team, and the nail-biting suspense brought on by possibility of great success or equally great failure makes ""Friday Night Lights"" a wonderfully entertaining story with near-universal appeal. A truly terrific sports movie -not only for sports fans.The DVD: Bonus features include 4 featurettes, an audio commentary, deleted scenes, text bios of the cast and filmmakers, and a DVD-ROM (Windows only). ""Peter Berg Discusses a Scene in the Movie"" is a short intro to the scene in the burger joint, which was filmed at the recommendation of the studio who wisely felt that Berg needed something to slow down the frenetic first half-hour of the film. The intro is followed by the scene. ""Player Cam"" (4 minutes) is a home movie of the actors goofing off. In ""Tim McGraw: Off the Stage"" (6 minutes), McGraw, director Peter Berg, and producer Brian Grazier talk about the country music star's role as Don's father, Charlie Billingsley. ""The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers"" (23 minutes) is a documentary  in which the real Boobie Miles, Don Billingsley, Mike Winchell, and Brian Chavez talk about their experiences as Panthers in 1988. Director Peter Berg and writer H.G. Bissinger also discuss the characters. The audio commentary by director Peter Berg and H.G.

The fact that this is an actual true story makes this movie even more powerful.The movie starts with a 7-10 minute collage of scenes.  It is very fast-paced and quickly gets you in gear for the story-line.  We are in Odessa, TX and high school football is king.  The season is about to start and expectations are extremly high, since ""Boobie"" Miles is the running back that is supposed to take the team to the state championship.As the beginning goes on, we are introduced to all of our players and see what an average day of practice is like for them.  They are hounded by the media, fans in the stands and then finally, by their parents and the rest of the town after practice.  Again, high school football is king in this town.Our main characters make up an interesting group.-Winchell, QB..he is the nervous leader, never taking a moment to relax.  Perhaps that is because his mother is mentlly ill and will not stop grlling him on the game.-Billingsley, RB..My favorite player. He lives in the shadow of his father's glory.  His father is also a drunk who prods and beats Billingsley because he is not as good as his father.-Christian, DE..Tough, mean and quiet.  Christian says about 7 lines throughout the movie, but the emotion shown in their last game is amazing.  He is also arguably their best player.-Chavez, CB..Hard-hitting and extremly smart.  He is actually mentioned as being the smartest kid in school.  He is also awesome on defense and has a lighter attitude when it comes to football.-""Boobie"" Miles, RB..Great running back, but very cocky.  ""Boobie"" is the story, but for reasons that I will not go into as to save you from a spoiler.-Mcmillan, RB...third-string RB. Another one of my favorites.  I love his childish attitude and professional determination.  He is also good for a few laughs along the way.-Coach...This is Billy Bob Thorton's character.  I thought this movie would revolve around him, but for once, a football movie does NOT depend on the coach for it's plot.All in all, this movie is really amazing and should not be missed by any fan of football or sports movies.

The film offers interchanging perspectives from key protagonists, which primarily consists of: Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) and James ""Boobie"" Miles (Derek Luke).The narrative stretches beyond the Permian Panthers and also examines the local community in Odessa, and their high school football culture. The team in many ways represents broader hopes and dreams, and serves as a sporting delegate to the district. Pride and tradition is deeply instilled in the team and the players carry not only their own goals and expectations, but also those from people with a deep connection to the team.Whilst the players are high performing athletes their lives present various challenges and the diversity of their circumstances provides the viewer with additional appreciation of the depth of the story.The quality of acting displays authentic and interesting characters and the movie takes the viewer on a journey stacked with glory, aspirations and the progression of youth to manhood.Nicholas R.W.

It is based on a true story although I am sure there is some creative license here and there. The plot is fairly predictable and the actors all seem to deliver their lines with the passion you would expect. Thornton seems miscast in this movie, the same way he did in The Alamo, but Tim McGraw does a good job of playing a balding alcoholic father. I guess now we know why he always wears that cowboy hat. I also don't understand why Hollywood has to keep making the world seem that all that matters in Texas is football and not education. We do learn how to read and write in our schools too and not everyone's town shuts down in time for kickoff on Friday night. Other than that, there isn't much more to talk about with this movie. It has some good hard hitting scenes during the football games, but never goes too much into any of the characters. Some of the players, who have speaking roles, leave you wondering who they are supposed to be in the movie instead of caring why they are saying what they said. Thornton needs a hit and seems to be taking any part that he thinks will get him that box office draw. Again, it isn't a bad movie, but it sure has been done time and time again. Thornton's coach seems like a weak version of Denzel Washington's coach in Remember the Titans. At times, he yells at the players just to turn around and seem like the only reason he yelled is because the script told him to do it. Oh well, it isn't as bad as Varsity Blues but it isn't North Dallas 40 or the Longest Yard.

630545,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNEW,Robert Moore,"[6, 6]","I have read so many spectacular reviews of the TV series FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHT that I decided that I needed to watch the series myself.  But I first wanted to see the film that the TV series was based upon.This is a carefully crafted film about the somewhat dubious role that football is allowed to play in the lives of small town Americans.  What many people seem to miss in seeing the film is the deeply critical aspects of the film.  While the struggles of Permian High School to overcome the loss of their star player Boobie Miles -- who is portrayed as a 1988 high school equivalent of today's Darren McFadden of Arkansas (like McFadden, Miles is portrayed as someone who is spectacularly fast, a great receiver, and even an accomplished passer) -- take center stage, there is also a quiet but pervasive criticism of the role that football is allowed to play in people's lives in this small town.  There is the sadness of several former players who have never been able to find meaning in their lives after hanging up their cleats.  There is also the poignancy of people utterly obsessed with the failure or success of the local high school team, as if there was some connection between the quality of their lives and the fate of the team.  From the beginning to the end of the movie there is a sense that these are people without lives, so that while on one level we celebrate the victories of the team on another we experience a deep sadness.  I kept thinking of something Kierkegaard wrote while watching the movie.  He distinguished between the comic and the tragic, characterizing the latter as regarding with finite interest that which ought to be of eternal interest, while identifying the comic as regarding something finite as of eternal interest.  In this sense, the movie is at its heart a tragicomedy.  The movie doesn't explore precisely why these people have such sad lives, but it leaves no question at the end that they do.This is a very slick movie, which is impressive given that it was essentially a low budget film (it was made for around $30 million) with a very large cast.  As a result the film has pretty much a no name cast, the only actor that most people would be familiar with being Billy Bob Thornton.  But the film never reveals its low budget.  From beginning to end every aspect is highly polished.I mentioned the way that the movie criticizes our obsession with football and how this obsession is contrasted with the fundamental emptiness in the lives of the characters in the film.  The two characters who most display these aspects of the film are the aforementioned Boobie Miles and former star Charles Billingsley, played by country music star Tim McGraw.  The only thing that Miles has going for him at the start of the film is his athletic ability and as we hear him struggling to read a recruiting letter we realize that he is borderline illiterate.  When he learns that his knee injury is far worse than anyone imagined he realizes how little life has to offer him.  He is a man with rapidly collapsing horizons.  Billingsley, on the other hand, has only his memories of having starred for Permian.  He relentlessly drives his son to achieve a similar kind of success so that he can relive some of it vicariously.This film in the end is not a celebration of football, but a paean on our excessive obsession with what is, in the end, only a game.  It does not mean that football is devoid of all redeeming values, but it does mean to point out that there is more to life than football.",4,Definitely an above average sports film,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,3527,"['have', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'spectacular', 'reviews', 'TV', 'series', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHT', 'decided', 'needed', 'watch', 'series', 'first', 'wanted', 'see', 'film', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'upon.This', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'film', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'role', 'football', 'allowed', 'play', 'lives', 'small', 'town', 'Americans', 'What', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'miss', 'seeing', 'film', 'deeply', 'critical', 'aspects', 'film', 'struggles', 'Permian', 'High', 'School', 'overcome', 'loss', 'star', 'player', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'who', 'portrayed', '1988', 'high', 'school', 'equivalent', 'today', 'Darren', 'McFadden', 'Arkansas', 'McFadden', 'Miles', 'portrayed', 'someone', 'who', 'spectacularly', 'fast', 'great', 'receiver', 'even', 'accomplished', 'passer', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'also', 'quiet', 'pervasive', 'criticism', 'role', 'football', 'allowed', 'play', 'people', 'lives', 'small', 'town', 'sadness', 'several', 'former', 'players', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'meaning', 'lives', 'hanging', 'up', 'cleats', 'also', 'poignancy', 'people', 'utterly', 'obsessed', 'failure', 'success', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'team', 'was', 'connection', 'quality', 'lives', 'fate', 'team', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'sense', 'are', 'people', 'lives', 'while', 'one', 'level', 'celebrate', 'victories', 'team', 'experience', 'deep', 'sadness', 'kept', 'thinking', 'something', 'Kierkegaard', 'wrote', 'watching', 'movie', 'distinguished', 'comic', 'tragic', 'characterizing', 'latter', 'regarding', 'finite', 'interest', 'ought', 'be', 'eternal', 'interest', 'identifying', 'comic', 'regarding', 'something', 'finite', 'eternal', 'interest', 'sense', 'movie', 'heart', 'tragicomedy', 'movie', ""n't"", 'explore', 'precisely', 'why', 'people', 'have', 'such', 'sad', 'lives', 'question', 'end', 'do.This', 'very', 'slick', 'movie', 'impressive', 'given', 'was', 'essentially', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'made', '30', 'million', 'very', 'large', 'cast', 'result', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'name', 'cast', 'only', 'actor', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'familiar', 'being', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'film', 'never', 'low', 'budget', 'beginning', 'end', 'aspect', 'highly', 'polished.I', 'mentioned', 'way', 'movie', 'obsession', 'football', 'how', 'obsession', 'contrasted', 'fundamental', 'emptiness', 'lives', 'characters', 'film', 'two', 'characters', 'who', 'most', 'display', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'aforementioned', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'former', 'star', 'Charles', 'Billingsley', 'played', 'country', 'music', 'star', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'only', 'thing', 'Miles', 'going', 'start', 'film', 'athletic', 'ability', 'hear', 'struggling', 'read', 'recruiting', 'letter', 'realize', 'borderline', 'illiterate', 'When', 'knee', 'injury', 'far', 'worse', 'anyone', 'imagined', 'how', 'little', 'life', 'offer', 'man', 'rapidly', 'collapsing', 'horizons', 'Billingsley', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'memories', 'having', 'starred', 'Permian', 'relentlessly', 'son', 'achieve', 'similar', 'kind', 'success', 'can', 'relive', 'film', 'end', 'not', 'celebration', 'football', 'paean', 'excessive', 'obsession', 'what', 'end', 'only', 'game', 'not', 'mean', 'football', 'devoid', 'redeeming', 'values', 'mean', 'point', 'out', 'more', 'life', 'football']",Friday Night Lights
630546,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,B00005JNEW,Robert Morris,"[1, 2]","Based on H.G. (""Buzz"") Bissinger's book with the same title and directed by Peter Berg, this film focuses on the Permian (Texas) High School Panthers' 1988 season which ended in the state championship game played in the Houston Astrodome against Dallas Carter High School. Frankly, although I have lived in Texas for almost 30 years and am well aware of the passion which football at all levels generates throughout the state, I still find it difficult to believe the nature and extent of pressure which otherwise sensible adults place on the importance of winning games. Permian coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is a case in point. If we are to believe Bissinger's account, Gaines was in real danger of losing his job if the Panthers lost the state championship game. (Interestingly, he and his team won it the next year.) The quality of acting throughout the cast is solid but several characters (e.g. Charles Billingsley played by Tim McGraw) seem stereotypical. For whatever reasons, Berg fails to develop any of the leading characters (notably Coach Gaines) beyond what would be revealed in a brief encounter at the local Dairy Queen. In fact, for me at least, the only sympathetic character (if there is one) is the team's star running back, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), and that's a bit of a stretch, given his peacock personality. The on-field action seems authentic, especially in the championship game. Among sports films, I rate Friday Night Lights comparable with Rudy (1993) and Remember the Titans (2000) but a notch or two below Hoosiers (1986), Varsity Blues (1999), and Miracle (2004). In terms of sustained suspense and dramatic impact, I rate it lower than, for example, The Last Picture Show (1991) with which it shares a few issues in common and Field of Dreams (1989) which, in contrast, celebrates innocence rather than denigrates it as Friday Night Lights does, albeit by implication.",4,"Actually, Three and One Half Stars",1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,1912,"['Based', 'H.G', 'Buzz', 'Bissinger', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'directed', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'film', 'Permian', 'Texas', 'High', 'School', 'Panthers', '1988', 'season', 'ended', 'state', 'championship', 'game', 'played', 'Houston', 'Astrodome', 'Dallas', 'Carter', 'High', 'School', 'Frankly', 'have', 'lived', 'Texas', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'passion', 'football', 'levels', 'generates', 'state', 'still', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'nature', 'extent', 'pressure', 'otherwise', 'sensible', 'adults', 'place', 'importance', 'winning', 'games', 'Permian', 'coach', 'Gary', 'Gaines', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'case', 'point', 'are', 'believe', 'Bissinger', 'account', 'Gaines', 'was', 'real', 'danger', 'losing', 'job', 'Panthers', 'lost', 'state', 'championship', 'game', 'Interestingly', 'team', 'won', 'next', 'year', 'quality', 'acting', 'cast', 'solid', 'several', 'characters', 'e.g', 'Charles', 'Billingsley', 'played', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'seem', 'stereotypical', 'reasons', 'Berg', 'develop', 'leading', 'characters', 'notably', 'Coach', 'Gaines', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'revealed', 'brief', 'encounter', 'local', 'Dairy', 'Queen', 'fact', 'least', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'one', 'team', 'star', 'running', 'back', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'bit', 'stretch', 'given', 'peacock', 'personality', 'on-field', 'action', 'authentic', 'especially', 'championship', 'game', 'sports', 'films', 'rate', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'comparable', 'Rudy', '1993', 'Remember', 'Titans', '2000', 'notch', 'two', 'Hoosiers', '1986', 'Varsity', 'Blues', '1999', 'Miracle', '2004', 'terms', 'sustained', 'suspense', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'rate', 'lower', 'example', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', '1991', 'shares', 'few', 'issues', 'common', 'Field', 'Dreams', '1989', 'contrast', 'innocence', 'rather', 'denigrates', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'albeit', 'implication']",Friday Night Lights
630547,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNEW,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","The best thing about ""Friday Night Lights"" is how it exposes the small town obsession with high school football.  In Odessa, Texas, where the story is set, businesses shut down and radio sports commentators opine with the pretentious air of political pundits when the Permian Panthers take to the field.  Now this is some serious football country, as the mood of the town fluctuates with the win/loss record of the team and family dynamics follow along with the ebb and flow of the season.  It may be that somebody down there in Odessa just seriously needs to get a life.Based on the book by H.G. Bissinger, the film recounts the 1988 season when Coach Gary Gaines, despite the loss of his best player, still managed to carry his team to the state championships.Unfortunately, the storyline and characters in the film are not always as interesting as the setting and milieu.  The drama is occasionally lacking and many of the characters rank as little more than hoary sports movie cliches: the supportive coach's wife; the abusive, alcoholic father trying to relive his high school glory days through his son; the cocky star player humbled by the exigencies of a cruel fate.  Yet, the film has assets that help it to overcome some of the weaknesses of the script.  Billy Bob Thornton plays Gaines as a thoughtful, even-tempered individual who knows what it takes to win but understands that life does not begin and end on the football field.  His inspirational locker room speech towards the close is restrained, pointed and well delivered.  In fact, the coach seems far less obsessed with winning than many of the ordinary folks he runs into - and has to take unsolicited advice from - on a daily basis.  It is that pressure to win at all costs - placed not only on the boys but on the coach as well - that the movie dramatizes so effectively.  The film also makes it clear that, for many of these boys, football is the only ticket they will ever have out of small town America.""Friday Night Lights"" isn't nearly as compelling and involving as ""Remember the Titans,"" but diehard football fans won't be complaining.",3,Friday Night Lite - but enjoyable anyway,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,2115,"['best', 'thing', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'how', 'small', 'town', 'obsession', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'Odessa', 'Texas', 'where', 'story', 'set', 'businesses', 'shut', 'down', 'radio', 'sports', 'commentators', 'opine', 'pretentious', 'air', 'political', 'pundits', 'when', 'Permian', 'Panthers', 'take', 'field', 'Now', 'serious', 'football', 'country', 'mood', 'town', 'win/loss', 'record', 'team', 'family', 'dynamics', 'follow', 'along', 'ebb', 'flow', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'somebody', 'there', 'Odessa', 'just', 'seriously', 'get', 'life.Based', 'book', 'H.G', 'Bissinger', 'film', '1988', 'season', 'when', 'Coach', 'Gary', 'Gaines', 'loss', 'best', 'player', 'still', 'managed', 'carry', 'team', 'state', 'championships.Unfortunately', 'storyline', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'as', 'interesting', 'setting', 'milieu', 'drama', 'occasionally', 'lacking', 'many', 'characters', 'rank', 'little', 'more', 'hoary', 'sports', 'movie', 'cliches', 'supportive', 'coach', 'wife', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'trying', 'relive', 'high', 'school', 'glory', 'days', 'son', 'cocky', 'star', 'player', 'humbled', 'exigencies', 'cruel', 'fate', 'film', 'assets', 'help', 'overcome', 'weaknesses', 'script', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Gaines', 'thoughtful', 'even-tempered', 'individual', 'who', 'what', 'win', 'life', 'not', 'begin', 'end', 'football', 'field', 'inspirational', 'locker', 'room', 'speech', 'close', 'restrained', 'pointed', 'well', 'delivered', 'fact', 'coach', 'far', 'less', 'obsessed', 'winning', 'many', 'ordinary', 'folks', 'take', 'unsolicited', 'advice', 'daily', 'basis', 'pressure', 'win', 'costs', 'placed', 'not', 'only', 'boys', 'coach', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'so', 'effectively', 'film', 'also', 'clear', 'many', 'boys', 'football', 'only', 'ticket', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'compelling', 'involving', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'diehard', 'football', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'complaining']",Friday Night Lights

""Friday Night Lights"" tears that cliche to shreds as it proves that to too many people - both the athletes and the fans who adore them -- sports are the primary focus of daily life.Simultaneously obeying and transcending the traditions of the football movie, Peter Berg's ""Friday Night Lights"" follows the Permian High School football team through its 1988 season. (""FNL"" is a slightly fictionalized version of the best-selling non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger -- and the deviations are relatively minor.)  Odessa, a busted oil town in the sun-blasted plains of west Texas, has nothing going for it except high school football.  Thanks to the complete absence of opportunity in Odessa, the town is full of dreamers -- the kids who dream of a better life outside of Odessa, and the adults who dream of the kids' winning a state championship.Indeed, the town is singularly focused on winning the 5-A Texas state title.  The high school football coach (played with excellent reserve by Billy Bob Thornton, the only ""star"" in the movie) is the highest-paid employee in the school district.  The football stadium is, by far, the most expensive building in town, holding 20,000 people (every business in town closes during games).  And the players are gods, with high school girls literally falling at their feet.Several sub-plots involving specific players captivate the audience during the march to the state title (which commences with brutal two-a-day practices in the 110-degree August sunshine).  Two of the most riveting sub-plots involve Boobie Miles and Don Billingsley.  Boobie, the star running back with dreams of the NFL, may be the best player in the state and the history of the high school, but thanks to a cruel twist of fate has to come to terms with the fact that his destiny is more likely entwined with riding the back of a garbage truck than playing on TV on Sundays.  Don Billingsley has to confront his own athletic limitations -- he's never going to get a Division I scholarship -- as well as his drunken, violent father (played surprisingly well by country singer Tim McGraw).  There are other excellent stories told by this movie, as well.The football action scenes are shot very well -- these are real collisions rather than CGI special effects -- and at all times we believe we're watching the actors play football rather than stuntmen, even for the most brutal tackles and blocks.""FNL"" does not limit itself to the perils of sports.  Look for some surprising moments of redemption as the squad moves closer and closer to its Holy Grail, the state championship -- I lost count of how many times the players and coaches were exhorted to ""win state"" by the townsfolk . . . and sometimes with more threat than encouragement.By casting a bunch of virtual no-name actors, ""FNL"" creates a sense of realism that makes the stories that much more powerful.

The characters were compelling and you really felt for them and their individual situations.I am not a Billy Bob Thorton fan, but I was pleasantly surprised by his controlled performance. Too often the coaches in football movies are completely over the top. Thorton had the strength to get on people - but he never over did it. It was a football coach.  And the movie ended on a strong note. The half-time speech Thorton gives during the final game is something that gives a former football player goose bumps. It really encapsulates what its truly like to be a part of a football TEAM...and how powerful that experience can be.I have seen movies like ""All the Right Moves"", ""The Program"", ""Varsity Blues"" and the laughable ""Any Given Sunday"".

630556,A10WEP0LPL7A6O,B00005JNEW,"S. Shelfer ""Old Coach""","[0, 0]","My perspective of this movie is probably different from the average viewer; I have played, coached, refereed, and watched a lot of high school football, almost all in Texas and most in West Texas. I've also spent a summer working broken oil rigs at Stanton, TX (not too far from Odessa), and have lived, coached, and taught in west Texas for more than half my life.First, let me pick at the few negatives I saw.Odessa is NOT a small town, but rather a medium-sized city of approximately 100,000, with two high schools, Permian and Odessa High, each with an enrollment of approximately 4000 students, which puts them both in 5A, the largest classification in Texas.2nd, Berg should have stuck with the schedule and scores of the games that Permian actually played that year. The district record was right, but the order of opponents and the scores were not. Also, Permian met Carter in the semi-finals at the University of Texas' Memorial Stadium, not in the state finals in the Astrodome. Too, the Permian - Carter game was a low-scoring affair won by Carter, 13-9.On the other hand, the movie gave a very accurate picture of the pressure Permian puts on its coaches to ""win state;"" almost anything else is considered a losing season.Also, Billy Bob Thornton caught Coach Gary Gaines' demeanor very well; Gaines is a soft-spoken, religious man, and I thought that came through.The frenzy that is Texas high school playoff football was demonstrated very well, as was the immense physical size and talent advantage that Carter had over Permian. Carter, after all, had NINE players who were offered Division I scholarship, whereas Permian had only 3 players play any college ball at all, and all were at D-2 or lower, and one of those was only in junior college.Probably the best points the movie made were the ""teamwork,"" ""hard work,"" and ""preparation""  aspects of the game. Permian, on paper, had absolutely no business being on the field with Carter and its collection of college-quality players. (Carter, in fact, was a near-30 point favorite) However, Permian gave an almost perfect demonstration of ""overachieving,"" and nearly pulled off the upset. The fact that most of these young men have achieved at least moderate success in life also reflects favorably  on `Mojo' football; they appear to have transferred the hard lessons of football to their lives. Contrary to popular opinion, Brian Chazez (lawyer) is not the only ""real life"" success from this team. Those young men became independent businessmen, teachers and coaches, oil-field supervisors (and oil company management), and one is a geologist specializing in oil exploration.On the other hand, the movie did NOT mention the facts that 5 of Carter's players (all of them from the 9 with scholarships) served time in jail for armed robbery and that Carter was stripped of the state championship (over San Antonio Converse-Judson) for academic irregularitites. These are in stark contrast to the post-Mojo success of most of the Permian players.I thought I was too jaded, having ""been there, done that,"" to get very excited at a mere movie of my game, but was completely caught up in the action, even as I was noticing the errors.Not quite a tour de force, but an excellent and accurate movie, showing Texas football, warts & all.Addendum: I've noticed several reviews that ask what happened to ""Boobie"" Miles. He lives in Monahans, TX (w of Odessa) with his kids, and runs his own yard service. Not a top-drawer job, but he IS self-employed and supporting his family!Addendum 2: BTW, folks, you don't HAVE to ""just watch"" the game after you graduate; every SW Football Officials' Assn chapter I'm aware of is SCREAMING for young guys who love the game to become referees. I did it for several years, and highly recommend it; you'll help the kids and the game itself and give yourself a different perspective on each game.

630559,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B00005JNEW,Steve Douglas,"[2, 2]","Everyone else has already discussed the storyline, its relevance to the comic book and comments on acting. I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray. ( However, did like seeing how young Connie Briton, with a small part as the coach's wife appeared and appreciated how her part in the TV series, which I watched all the time, had grown.I did not have this movie on a Standard Def DVD so it certainly will not be a comparison between the two.VIDEO...the transfer is very clean with no artifacting or aliasing of any kind.  There were no problems during playing the Blu Ray disc.  The colors are deliberately desaturated and created a softer look, however, the contrast was really quite good and grain is kept to a minimum.  I was surprised at how high the bit rate was, averaging in the mid 30's.  There is some controversy over bit rates on Blu Ray as many believe that the higher the bit rate, the less compression there is done to the film.  Others believe that Bit Rates are irrelevant and that  there is no  direct linear correspondence between bit rate and picture quality.  In truth, bit rate is just a measure of how much data there is in a picture stream and certainly not all films need the same amount of data.  I am on the fence and believe that the higher the bit rate, usually, the better the image since more data is reaching the screen.AUDIO.... The lossless DTS HD 5.1 audio provided an excellent spread of the soundtrack  across the front stage.  Dialogue is very clear and transparent and there will be no need to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control. All audio levels are the way they should be.  The rear channels provide much ambient crowd noise boosted by the LFE sub channel.  There is not a whole lot of discreet directionality sent to the rear channels nor need for the sub to do more than boost ambient noise.  Foley effects are mostly spread across the front stage but not much panning to the sides or rear.  Never the less, the audio is really quite good, just not to be used for a demo disc to show off your system.Extras...Plenty of deleted and extended scenes, none that would be better served in an extended edition.  Lots of other extras about the original team this movie was based upon, and making of documentaries.For the price, if you liked the movie, get the Blu Ray.

The film ambits the trials and tribulations of the 1988 Odessa-Permian high school football squad in search of a state championship, but with an in-depth look into the true reality and significance of football on the lives of all that it touches in a small Texas community, ""Friday Night Lights"" proves to be more than just a run-of-the-mill sports drama.Billy Bob Thornton appends a unique role to his impressive resume, playing head Permian coach Gary Gaines, a well-respected leader of his troops but always under intense pressure from the Odessa faithful to be the best.  While Thornton may be the well-known star of the film, the film spotlights the metamorphosis of the team's courageous season through the eyes of the players:  quiet team captain Mike Winchell (performed exceptionally well by Lucas Black) not only has to lead his team to victory, but has the sole responsibility of taking care of his unhealthy mother; back-up halfback Don Billingsly (Garrett Hedlund) must live in shadow of his former Permian star father (Tim McGraw) and survive the continuous harsh criticism from the man who wants him to succeed the most; and the eccentric Boobie Miles (Derek Luke, star of ""Antoine Fisher""), an incredibly tantalizing force on the football field, who must fight through injuries and life in the limelight.""Friday Night Lights"" is based on the bestselling novel written by H.G. Bissinger (who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin) and is adapted brilliantly by David Aaron Cohen and Berg.  ""Friday Night Lights"" is not the easiest film to stomach (not due to violence, but because of some abnormal jerkiness of the camera), but the film is driven by the splendid supporting performances of McGraw and Luke.  Thornton is very convincing as the demanding, hard-nosed coach who believes in perfection, but ultimately shows his depth as an actor as he exponentially augments Coach Gaines sincerity and heart as the film progresses.  Not quite ""The Field of Dreams"" of the football drama genre, but a great sport drama nonetheless that will certainly touch those who understand the meaning of high school sports to teenagers who play them.

630564,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,B00005JNEW,T O'Brien,"[3, 4]","Based on a true story, Friday Night Lights is a great sports movie about small town football.  In Odessa, Texas, the Permian Panthers, the high school football team, reign supreme over the town.  Players are treated like celebrities, and every Friday night is like the Super Bowl for the citizens of Odessa.  Because this is the only team they have, Odessa places incredible pressure on the Panthers to win the State Football Championship.  Things are no different in the 1988 season as Coach Gary Gaines hopes to lead the Panthers to victory.  When the team's star running back goes down with a serious knee injury, it looks like their season is in trouble.  This movie, directed by Peter Berg, shows very accurately just how important the football team is to Odessa.  Incredible amounts of pressure are placed on Coach Gaines and his players to win.  A season that does not end in a State Championship is a failure.  Highly recommended sports movie.Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Coach Gary Gaines, who must lead his Panthers to the State Championships or else.  This has been quite a year for Thornton who also gave great performances in The Alamo and Bad Santa.  The movie focuses on six players on the team who all give very good, believable performances; Lucas Black as quarterback Mike Winchell, who wants to get out of Odessa but at the same time must support his mother, Garret Hedlund as fullback Don Billingsley, who must live under the watchful eye of his alcoholic father, Derek Luke as tailback James ""Boobie"" Miles, the cocky, extremely gifted star of the team, Jay Hernandez as free safety Brian Chavez, the gifted student, Lee Jackson as the strong, silent defensive lineman Ivory Christian, and Lee Thompson Young as Chris Comer, the small third string running back.  Tim McGraw is almost unrecognizable in his excellent performance as Charles Billingsley, Don's alcoholic father.  The movie also stars Connie Britton, Grover Coulson, and Connie Cooper.

630567,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNEW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Five years after ""Varsity Blues,"" another film about West Texas high school football comes with Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines who must lead his team to the championship, no matter what it takes.  Based on the real games and the real people, who participated in the 1988 season, 'Friday Night Lights' is more authentic and often alarmingly realistic than 'Varsity Blues' (which I like), in describing the glory of being the star players, and revealing the reality surrounding them.Director Peter Berg (The Rock's successful 'The Rundown'), perhaps inevitably, spends most of the films on the life on and out of the field of the high school players -- THE star of the team 'Booobie' (Derek Luke), team leader Mike (Lucas Black), and Charles (Tim McGraw) whose abusive father keeps on telling how he is disappointed with his son.  So far, things are not new.  If you think one of them is too confident, you already know what will happen to him.To see the life of Coach Gaines, with good acting from Billy Bob Thornton, is more intersting to me, for his life in the city of Odessa, Texas, could be very intense, nearly life-or-death matter.  The townspeople come to the Coach, and then, quietly tell him that their team must win -- if not directly, with uninvited suggestions.  And as far as the football goes, when they wish something, that something must be realized.  Like winning the State.[CONVENTIONAL BUT SOLID] Despite the semi-documentray touch of the slightly shaky and grainy photography, the film is made with an orthodox approach.  At first the film has some moments showing the players' doubts about their way of life, or even the way of the football itself (and the community that suppport with enthusiasm), but gradually the heroism takes them over, with the exciting scenes of the bone-crunching games and dedicated football players.  The story is very conventional, but the presentation is solid and well-paced.Like his previous 'The Rundown,' Peter Berg conducts everything with confidence, and the results are very satisfactory even though you don't particularly like the world of American high school football.  Even if you don't come to like the sports itself, you come to understand the people in this small town where the Friday Night Lights mean everything to them, the glory, the life and all.",4,"High School Football, or American Way of Life",1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,2325,"['Five', 'years', 'Varsity', 'Blues', 'film', 'West', 'Texas', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Coach', 'Gary', 'Gaines', 'who', 'must', 'lead', 'team', 'championship', 'matter', 'what', 'Based', 'real', 'games', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'participated', '1988', 'season', 'Night', 'Lights', 'more', 'authentic', 'often', 'alarmingly', 'realistic', ""'Varsity"", 'Blues', 'like', 'describing', 'glory', 'being', 'star', 'players', 'revealing', 'reality', 'surrounding', 'them.Director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Rock', 'successful', ""'The"", 'Rundown', 'perhaps', 'inevitably', 'most', 'films', 'life', 'field', 'high', 'school', 'players', 'star', 'team', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'team', 'leader', 'Mike', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Charles', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'abusive', 'father', 'keeps', 'telling', 'how', 'disappointed', 'son', 'So', 'far', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'new', 'think', 'one', 'too', 'confident', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'him.To', 'see', 'life', 'Coach', 'Gaines', 'good', 'acting', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'more', 'intersting', 'life', 'city', 'Odessa', 'Texas', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'intense', 'nearly', 'life-or-death', 'matter', 'townspeople', 'come', 'Coach', 'then', 'quietly', 'tell', 'team', 'must', 'win', 'not', 'directly', 'uninvited', 'suggestions', 'as', 'far', 'football', 'when', 'wish', 'something', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'realized', 'winning', 'State', '[', 'CONVENTIONAL', 'BUT', 'SOLID', ']', 'semi-documentray', 'touch', 'slightly', 'shaky', 'grainy', 'photography', 'film', 'made', 'orthodox', 'approach', 'first', 'film', 'moments', 'showing', 'players', 'doubts', 'way', 'life', 'even', 'way', 'football', 'community', 'suppport', 'enthusiasm', 'gradually', 'heroism', 'over', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'bone-crunching', 'games', 'dedicated', 'football', 'players', 'story', 'very', 'conventional', 'presentation', 'solid', 'well-paced.Like', 'previous', 'Rundown', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'everything', 'confidence', 'results', 'are', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'world', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'sports', 'come', 'understand', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'mean', 'everything', 'glory', 'life']",Friday Night Lights

630569,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JNEW,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 3]","Based upon the best-selling nonfiction book of the same name, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is the story about Odessa, Texas's high school's bid for a state football championship in the fall of 1988.  The movie follows the lives of key members of the team as they begin their summer training through their season that comes to a dramatic conclusion at the Astrodome.  Odessa is a small town and doesn't offer many future prospects for the students who live there.  Most of them come from troubled backgrounds, for example quarterback Mike Winchell's (Lucas Black) mother is sick and dying and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) lives with an emotionally abusive alcoholic father.  Nevertheless, hopes and expectations are high for the Permian ""MOJO"" Panthers and Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton).  The town wants perfection, meaning a perfect season with a state title.  Coach Gaines wants perfection, too, but he defines it differently.  For him, perfection means giving it all; it is a way of life.  The Panthers start off the season strong, lead by Winchell and star tailback Boobie Miles (Derek Luke).  But then tragedy strikes, distilling the peace and threatening to destroy even Coach Gaines' definition of perfection.FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the better team football movies that I have seen.  The action on the field is very realistic.  That is in part due to some actual footage of Permian football games that were sliced in with filmed footage from the movie.  However, much of the realism comes from the attitude of the characters.  If you've never been to Texas or Oklahoma and have never played football or personally known someone who has, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an incredibly depressing movie to watch.  The film has been made that way because FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS isn't really supposed to be about football, but it's supposed to be about the characters in the movie.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is really a movie about the friendships between a group of close high school friends.Yet, it is a football movie.  I never played football myself, but I generally like watching football movies.  RUDY and INVICIBLE are great films to watch.  They aren't as uplifting, but I also enjoyed ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, THE PROGRAM, and VARSITY BLUES as well as comical dramas like THE LONGEST YARD.  However, as much as I enjoy watching these films, they are nothing like real football in a small town.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is.  It's a very realistic film that illustrates how much the game means to many people and if you are connected to the sport at all, it seems a little insane.  For example, in FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS more money is spent on the football team than the rest of a school district's budget combined, the game is followed as a religion, and the biggest moments expected to happen in a person's life are during the Friday night lights of the football season of their senior year.  I realize for many people all of that sounds incredible, but in many parts of the country those things are a way of life.  Priorities might be out of line, the people might be misguided, and living like that seems incredibly depressing, but it's all very real.In short, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the most realistic football movies ever made.  Highly recommended for football fans, citizens of Texas, anyone who read the book, and people who favor dramas scattered with a little sport action.A couple of trivia pieces:  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS features country singer Tim McGraw in his motion picture debut.  Also, Connie Britton who plays Coach Gaines' wife, Sharon, is also the same actress who plays Coach Eric Taylor's (Kyle Chandler) wife Tami on the television series FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.An extra on the DVD is the short documentary ""The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers."" This featurette is a look back at the 1988 season with some of the real life players from that 1988 team, including Boobie Miles, Mike Winchell, Brian Chavez and Don Billingsley.  Real footage from some of their games as well as television interviews and news pieces about the team are seen.  I really enjoyed this featurette. It's the best extra on the DVD.Other extras include the usual directors commentary, deleted scenes, a brief conversation with Tim McGraw about acting, a behind the scenes personal video entitled ""Player Cam"", and a comment from director Peter Berg about the reasoning why he added the scene at the burger joint.",4,Very Realistic Football Film,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,4401,"['Based', 'best-selling', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'story', 'Odessa', 'Texas', 'high', 'school', 'bid', 'state', 'football', 'championship', 'fall', '1988', 'movie', 'lives', 'key', 'members', 'team', 'begin', 'summer', 'training', 'season', 'dramatic', 'conclusion', 'Astrodome', 'Odessa', 'small', 'town', ""n't"", 'offer', 'many', 'future', 'prospects', 'students', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'Most', 'come', 'troubled', 'backgrounds', 'example', 'quarterback', 'Mike', 'Winchell', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'mother', 'sick', 'dying', 'Don', 'Billingsley', 'Garrett', 'Hedlund', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Nevertheless', 'expectations', 'are', 'high', 'Permian', 'MOJO', 'Panthers', 'Coach', 'Gary', 'Gaines', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'town', 'perfection', 'meaning', 'perfect', 'season', 'state', 'title', 'Coach', 'Gaines', 'perfection', 'too', 'differently', 'perfection', 'giving', 'way', 'life', 'Panthers', 'start', 'season', 'strong', 'lead', 'Winchell', 'star', 'tailback', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'then', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'distilling', 'peace', 'threatening', 'destroy', 'even', 'Coach', 'Gaines', 'definition', 'perfection.FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'one', 'better', 'team', 'football', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'action', 'field', 'very', 'realistic', 'part', 'due', 'actual', 'footage', 'Permian', 'football', 'games', 'were', 'sliced', 'filmed', 'footage', 'movie', 'However', 'much', 'realism', 'attitude', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Texas', 'Oklahoma', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'football', 'personally', 'known', 'someone', 'who', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'movie', 'watch', 'film', 'been', 'made', 'way', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', ""n't"", 'really', 'supposed', 'be', 'football', 'supposed', 'be', 'characters', 'movie', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'really', 'movie', 'friendships', 'group', 'close', 'high', 'school', 'friends.Yet', 'football', 'movie', 'never', 'played', 'football', 'generally', 'watching', 'football', 'movies', 'RUDY', 'INVICIBLE', 'are', 'great', 'films', 'watch', 'are', ""n't"", 'uplifting', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'ANY', 'GIVEN', 'SUNDAY', 'THE', 'PROGRAM', 'VARSITY', 'BLUES', 'as', 'well', 'comical', 'dramas', 'THE', 'LONGEST', 'YARD', 'However', 'as', 'much', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'films', 'are', 'nothing', 'real', 'football', 'small', 'town', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'very', 'realistic', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'game', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'connected', 'sport', 'little', 'insane', 'example', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'more', 'money', 'spent', 'football', 'team', 'rest', 'school', 'district', 'budget', 'combined', 'game', 'followed', 'religion', 'biggest', 'moments', 'expected', 'happen', 'person', 'life', 'are', 'Friday', 'night', 'lights', 'football', 'season', 'senior', 'year', 'realize', 'many', 'people', 'incredible', 'many', 'parts', 'country', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'life', 'Priorities', 'might', 'be', 'line', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'misguided', 'living', 'incredibly', 'depressing', 'very', 'real.In', 'short', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'football', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'football', 'fans', 'citizens', 'Texas', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'people', 'who', 'favor', 'dramas', 'scattered', 'little', 'sport', 'action.A', 'couple', 'trivia', 'pieces', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS', 'country', 'singer', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'motion', 'picture', 'debut', 'Also', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'who', 'Coach', 'Gaines', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'also', 'same', 'actress', 'who', 'Coach', 'Eric', 'Taylor', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'wife', 'Tami', 'television', 'series', 'FRIDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIGHTS.An', 'extra', 'DVD', 'short', 'documentary', 'Story', '1988', 'Permian', 'Panthers', 'featurette', 'look', 'back', '1988', 'season', 'real', 'life', 'players', '1988', 'team', 'including', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'Mike', 'Winchell', 'Brian', 'Chavez', 'Don', 'Billingsley', 'Real', 'footage', 'games', 'as', 'well', 'television', 'interviews', 'news', 'pieces', 'team', 'are', 'seen', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'featurette', 'best', 'extra', 'DVD.Other', 'extras', 'include', 'usual', 'directors', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'brief', 'conversation', 'Tim', 'McGraw', 'acting', 'scenes', 'personal', 'video', 'entitled', 'Player', 'Cam', 'comment', 'director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'reasoning', 'why', 'added', 'scene', 'burger', 'joint']",Friday Night Lights
630570,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JNEW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 3]",": Showcasing the thrill, harsh reality, hardness and redemption of high school football in a economically depressed Odessa, Texas, Friday Night Lights strikes me as the perfect sports movie. The film balances out the importance of football to a small town, how the players use their abilities as their ticket out to college, the harsh competitiveness that eats at the coach and players and how essential the game is to the residents of the town.The town passed one bond in the last twenty years and that one bond was to build a $5 million stadium for the high school where the Permian Panthers play. A team with an amazing winning streak, the Permian Panthers had a difficult year in 1988 the year when writer H. G. Bissinger came to Odessa to write his book. The players on the team were smaller than in previous years, they had one star player that drove the team with other talented individuals supporting him. When Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) loses one of his key players on the drive to the state championship, he and his talented group of players must rethink their approach to the game.The pressure on the players and the coach is enormous. Everybody in town thinks they are experts at the game and give the coach advice implying that if he doesn't win, he'll need to find a new job. The kids are pressured by their parents who recognize that this game is the economic ticket for a lot of them that will lead them to better things. Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw) an abusive alcoholic recognizes that this year will be the highlight of his son Don's (Garrett Hedlund) life. A mixture of jealousy, envy and pride drives him to alienated his son and push him to extremes (it should be noted that the character here in the film is not based on the real life Charles Billingsley). Filled with amazing performances from the young ensemble cast, Friday Night Lights will make you reconsider those boys who live for their moment on the field in high school. A rich glimpse into a part of America not often seen in films, Friday Night Lights  captures the importance these boys play to the town (they're treated like the Dallas Cowboys by locals) but also the uncertainty and pressure these BOYS feel as they turn out for the field every single day.A beautiful, transfer that captures the desolate landscape of Odessa, Texas very well. With rich, dark blacks as deep as the night sky Friday Night Lights looks beautiful. There are virtually no digital or analog imperfections to mar this nicely done transfer. The documentary cutting style of the film is nicely contrasted with the color and look of the film. The 5.1 mix makes effective use of all the channels placing the action all around the room. With remarkable clarity the 5.1 sounds terrific.The 30 minute documentary on the real team profiled in the film acts as a nice reality check for the film. Featuring interviews with Don Billingsley, Mike Winchell, Boobie Miles and Brian Chavez, this footage provides a sense of balance and gives perspective to Berg's film. The only person missing from the film (either in older footage or current interview footage) is Gary Gaines. We also get behind-the-scenes footage that shows the actors and crew mugging and messing with each other. Although it's a bit redundant Peter Berg discusses the scene at the burger joint and why it was added to the final film during reshoots.In ""Ryan's Player Cam"" a player for the cinema version of the Permian Panthers takes his video camera and documents the making of the film with some fun behind-the-scenes footage. ""Tim McGraw"" off the stage highlights country singer McGraw being interviewed as to how he became interested in making the film. Berg and Grazer (with his bizarre Edward Scissorhands hair) provide their initial reaction to hearing about McGraw's interest and how they changed their minds when they heard what his take on the character was.Director Berg and his cousin author Bissinger provide the play by play commentary for the film. Both discuss the reality vs. the fiction presented here and, while Berg has taken some liberties with the story, he has tried to keep it true to the roots of the story. Bissinger's comments provide interesting insights since he wrote the book and comments about how even the fictional scenes manage to capture what he felt was running under the surface of these characters and this town.Full of great action sequences and great drama, ""Friday Night Lights"" will make you take a different look at the kids that play football in high school.",4,Top notch movie

630571,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B00005JNEW,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[9, 10]","I read the book this film was based on several years ago and thought it was absolutely riveting.  This movie truly captures the spirit of the book in a way that few adaptations can.  True, in the book, and in real life, the Permian Panthers met the Dallas Carter Cowboys in the semi-final game of the state playoffs and not the championship game, but the end result was the same.The film follows a season of Odessa (Texas) Permian High School football and anyone from anywhere near the area has heard about West Texas football and how seriously it's taken by the inhabitants of the region.  Permian plays it's home games in a $20 million football stadium, an amazing thing for a high school to have.  High School football is almost always played on Friday evenings during the fall, hence the title ""Friday Night Lights"".But this is not your typical movie depiction of sports, it's based on a real story like most movies about sports, but it differs in that it's much more real.  In this movie are all the ugly things that as much make up life as all the good things.  Early in the season the star player, Boobie Miles, blows out his knee and has to come to grips with the fact that he'll never be the same player, never go to the big-time college football school, never go to the pros.  He's 17, almost an adult and the only thing he is prepared to do in life is play football, and now he is physically unable to do that.We also see the intense pressure leveled on the coach, Gary Gaines, to succeed; in Permian a good season isn't enough, a State Championship is always expected.  After the second early season loss, coach Gaines and his family arrive late at night back to their house, only to see about 30 ""For Sale"" signs planted by angry fans in his front yard.In the end, the Panthers triumph, not on the field, not as a team, but individually, each knowing in his heart that he did everything possible to win.  And three players a couple of days after the final game meet at the parking lot of the high school, and each go their seperate ways.  The QB tossing a ball off to a group of kids playing in a nearby field as he walks away.And in real life, for 95% of high school football players, and 95% of college football players for that matter, that is the reality of football.  The last game for your school is the last game that you will ever play.  Football is unique in that respect, you don't see adult football leagues like you do soccer, baseball, softaball, volleyball, etc. leagues.  Once your school career is over, the game is done with you.  All you will ever do from now on is watch.And the movie catches this poignancy perfectly, one of the most beautiful endings I've ever seen in a film.  The overall feel of the movie is more that of a documentary than of a dramatic presentation.  And it's wonderfully done.  Even if you hate sports movies in general, you should watch this one.  It's different, wonderful, and not to be missed.

It's about the role of football in the lives of young men who don't have the oppurtunity for other moments of greatness in their lives. These Friday nights in their highschool years really are the best days of their life in a manner of speaking. It's their shot at immortality within their community. Afterwards, they take off the uniform and step into life as normal guys, lawyers and blue collar workers, single dads and car salesmen. I found this to be a surprisingly deep aspect of the film, one that I hadn't expected. I also think Billy Bob Thornton is great. He's one of few lead actors that knows how to be in a movie without hogging the lens. He's just a wonderful actor who knows how to be understated, when to step up front and when to blend back so that he brings out the best in other actors.

630573,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B00005JNEW,Westley,"[7, 11]","""Friday Night Lights"" tells of the 1988 Odessa, Texas high school football team.  In Texas, football is king, and the hopes and dreams of entire towns can ride on their team.  Odessa won state championships before, but this team is perhaps a bit smaller than usual, and the coach is new and untested.  Fortunately, they have Boobie Miles, a star player who could possibly carry them to the state championship.  The movie follows these players over the season, as the town alternates between rallying around them and vilifying them.Based on the non-fiction book by Buzz Bissinger, ""Friday Night Lights"" doesn't rely on the ""big game"" ending typical of sports movies.  The movie focuses on football, but it relies more on the characters.  It's about a town that is economically depressed and needs something behind which to rally.  ""Friday Night Lights"" could be just another Cinderella sports story.  However, it's not about winning - it's about the pressure the town puts on the team and the coach.  Fortunately, the acting is superb, especially Lucas Black (""Sling Blade"") as the glowering quarterback and Derek Luke (""Antwone Fisher"") as the star, Boobie.  You feel for these boys; you want them to win; but most of all, you want them to have some kind of life after the season draws to a close.  That's what ""Friday Night Lights"" is all about, and it's a really terrific movie.",5,"""We're in the business of winning.""",1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1380,"['Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'tells', '1988', 'Odessa', 'Texas', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'Texas', 'football', 'king', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'entire', 'towns', 'can', 'ride', 'team', 'Odessa', 'won', 'state', 'championships', 'team', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'smaller', 'usual', 'coach', 'new', 'untested', 'Fortunately', 'have', 'Boobie', 'Miles', 'star', 'player', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'carry', 'state', 'championship', 'movie', 'players', 'season', 'town', 'rallying', 'vilifying', 'them.Based', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'Buzz', 'Bissinger', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', ""n't"", 'rely', 'big', 'game', 'ending', 'typical', 'sports', 'movies', 'movie', 'football', 'more', 'characters', 'town', 'economically', 'depressed', 'something', 'rally', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'Cinderella', 'sports', 'story', 'However', 'not', 'winning', 'pressure', 'town', 'team', 'coach', 'Fortunately', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'glowering', 'quarterback', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'star', 'Boobie', 'feel', 'boys', 'want', 'win', 'most', 'want', 'have', 'kind', 'life', 'season', 'close', 'what', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'really', 'terrific', 'movie']",Friday Night Lights
630574,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JNEW,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 6]","For those who lament the dearth of quality football movies, Friday Night Lights should make for some mighty happy pappies out there.  Watching Friday Night Lights isn't quite as enjoyable as watching the Patriots routinely trounce their opposition (for this writer, anyway), but it should keep you riveted to your screen all the same.  Based, as everyone knows by now, on H.G. Bissinger's best-selling book, this movie uses the story of one high school football team's turbulent season to provide sidelong views at a region and culture that may seem like a parallel universe to some: Texas and high-school football, in this case the 1988 Permian High Panthers (aka the Mojo) of Odessa.  Some movies try, with varying degrees of success, to use football as a metaphor for life, but in this one it's a bit different.  Here, football is life, and its meaning is perfectly conveyed in what is easily among the most well-written and brilliantly shot movies of last year.Adapting his cousin's book to the big screen, director Peter Berg has here created a triumph of unapologetic realism that examines the ups and downs of life along with the ups and downs of sports.  Some rather implausible moments in the climatic final game notwithstanding (as has been noted, the writers took some liberties with the facts), for the most part Friday Night Lights smacks of verisimilitude.  Unlike in numerous second-rate fooball movies (this means you, The Replacements and Remember the Titans), you won't find photogenic teams gathered around singing songs like I Will Survive, or Ain't No Mountain High Enough, or one of those faux-inspirational songs that I can't tell apart anymore because they've coalesced into one searing cacophany in my brain.  What you will find is everything associated with football at its highest level, from the cheering masses assembled at the games; to the violent paroxysms of on-field action; to the legions of idiots yammering away on talk radio; to the ludicrous and ever-changing expectations placed on players and coaches.  Of course, in most places you'd only find much of this time and emotion invested in the local NFL or major-college team; here all this hype and pressure surrounds a high-school team composed of players who are still little more than children.Coupled with the drama surrounding the on-field action itself is an unflinching examination of the decidedly blue-collar community in which it takes place, the kind of mid-sized city where a college football scholarship can make virtually a world of difference.  You don't have to watch this movie for long to realize just why football is literally and figuratively nearly the only game in town: In Odessa, there's not much else going on.  Many characters in the movie speak quite openly about the desire to get out; Tim McGraw's revelatory performance as a local-legend-turned-tortured-father is a portent of what can happen to those who don't.  That's why it's such a harrowing moment when the team's star running back suffers a catastrophic knee injury: you don't need to wait for the postscripts at the end of the movie to know this guy doesn't have med school to fall back on.Billy Bob Thornton's understated performance as the team's moody, put-upon coach Gary Gaines is doubtless the glue that holds the proceedings together, but the movie benefits all around from some sharply-drawn characters, down-to-Earth dialogue, and pitch-perfect acting.  In addition to Thornton and McGraw, Derek Luke is especially convincing as Boobie, the freakishly gifted back whose veneer of confidence quickly gives way to confusion and fear after his injury.  Ultimately, though, Friday Night Lights is an ensemble picture of the highest order, with every player, coach, and fan, and even the stark Texas scenery itself, assuming a role.  With Thornton in the lead the emoting is largely kept to a minimum, but at the same time the emotional stakes are always obvious.Perhaps just as importantly, Friday Night Lights is helped along by what is quite probably the single greatest soundtrack in sports movie history, and used in perfect fashion to boot.  The Refused classic New Noise makes a perfect psyche-up anthem for the big game, but nice as it is to see such a criminally neglected band get some exposure in a major-studio release, the real star here is Texas post-rock outfit Explosions in the Sky.  This instrumental group's grandiose, textured compositions only serve to add further nuance and emotional depth to a movie that's got plenty of both already.  And on one final note, whatever you do, I implore you to ignore both the pointless nitpicking and negative comparisons found on this site.  There are people out there negatively comparing this captivating movie to the cliched mediocrity fest that was Remember the Titans?  Please.  This is the real deal.
