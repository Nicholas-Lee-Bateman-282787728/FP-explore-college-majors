309170,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,6302375819,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[0, 1]","After casablanca and reuniting with Sydney greenstreet you'd think you are in for a great movie...enjoyable but with these stars you know it would be..the problem with the story is it seems far fetched. However the film also has alexis smith a prominent actress from the 40's,and bogart always had good female name stars to costar with him,something not all male leads did. Anyways like the later the two mrs carrolls(1947)this film was held up for release and its interesting that his casablanca image didnt mesh with these type of insane killers and the movies are memorable more for what they tell us of psychology than for the characters themselves. This is the real problem with these tales of insanity and here mixed with murderers...do the characters come alive or do the happennings seem far fetched. The acting is good, especially bogart's as he plays the part extremely well,a different role from his casablanca character though he said he was reluctant to play it. The plot begins with after 5 years of marriage,the couple celebrating their marriage,and the bogart character transferring his 'object' of love to his sister in law. Then at a marriage ceremony the psychologist played great by greenstreet tells of thinking disorders,which come on with sudden vigour causing behaviorial disorder,and then we see him killing his wife and pursue the love object. He pressures the police to arrest a poor dishevelled somewhat homeless and mentally ill probably person for the crime...but this gets him nowhere and eventually(like a shakespearean tale)the murderer is haunted by his conscienceinto revisiting the scene of the crime and the police nab him. The characters run through the paces not often believably,but an interesting look at early psychology and film noir in film,with great stars and good acting,but the material is stereotyped and jack warner on seeing it thought it didnt work and he shouldnt have cast bogart in the lead...although he would do it again a few years later in film with similar theme in the two mrs carrolls(1947)this time in london. This is the first time i saw this film...and like most of these old murder films its melodramatic and the police and psychologist seem all too good and clean...and the bogart character too evil and bad...if only life were like this and this takes away from the reality of this film!",4,Very good cast in average film,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,2355,"['casablanca', 'reuniting', 'Sydney', 'greenstreet', ""'d"", 'think', 'are', 'great', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'stars', 'know', 'would', 'be..the', 'problem', 'story', 'far', 'fetched', 'However', 'film', 'also', 'alexis', 'prominent', 'actress', '40', 'bogart', 'always', 'had', 'good', 'female', 'name', 'costar', 'something', 'not', 'male', 'leads', 'did', 'Anyways', 'later', 'two', 'mrs', 'carrolls', '1947', 'film', 'was', 'held', 'up', 'release', 'interesting', 'casablanca', 'image', 'didnt', 'mesh', 'type', 'insane', 'killers', 'movies', 'are', 'memorable', 'more', 'what', 'tell', 'psychology', 'characters', 'real', 'problem', 'tales', 'insanity', 'here', 'mixed', 'murderers', 'do', 'characters', 'come', 'alive', 'do', 'happennings', 'seem', 'far', 'fetched', 'acting', 'good', 'especially', 'bogart', 'part', 'extremely', 'well', 'different', 'role', 'casablanca', 'character', 'said', 'was', 'reluctant', 'play', 'plot', '5', 'years', 'marriage', 'couple', 'celebrating', 'marriage', 'bogart', 'character', 'transferring', ""'object"", 'love', 'sister', 'law', 'Then', 'marriage', 'ceremony', 'psychologist', 'played', 'great', 'greenstreet', 'tells', 'thinking', 'disorders', 'come', 'sudden', 'vigour', 'causing', 'behaviorial', 'disorder', 'then', 'see', 'killing', 'wife', 'pursue', 'love', 'object', 'police', 'arrest', 'poor', 'dishevelled', 'somewhat', 'homeless', 'mentally', 'ill', 'probably', 'person', 'crime', 'nowhere', 'eventually', 'shakespearean', 'tale', 'murderer', 'haunted', 'conscienceinto', 'revisiting', 'scene', 'crime', 'police', 'nab', 'characters', 'run', 'paces', 'not', 'often', 'believably', 'interesting', 'look', 'early', 'psychology', 'film', 'noir', 'film', 'great', 'stars', 'good', 'acting', 'material', 'stereotyped', 'jack', 'warner', 'seeing', 'thought', 'didnt', 'work', 'shouldnt', 'have', 'cast', 'bogart', 'lead', 'would', 'do', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'film', 'similar', 'theme', 'two', 'mrs', 'carrolls', '1947', 'time', 'london', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'film', 'most', 'old', 'murder', 'films', 'melodramatic', 'police', 'psychologist', 'seem', 'all', 'too', 'good', 'clean', 'bogart', 'character', 'too', 'evil', 'bad', 'only', 'life', 'were', 'away', 'reality', 'film']",N/A

309172,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302375819,calvinnme,"[4, 4]","...but it isn't really that unusual if you consider the films Bogart made after ""High Sierra"" and he began to get meatier film roles instead of the one-note gangster roles Warner Brothers often put him into from 1936 until 1941. Bogart was quite a versatile actor to put it mildly, and this film showcases yet another side of his talents.Bogart plays Richard Mason, an engineer who is celebrating his fifth wedding anniversary with his wife Kathryn (Rose Hobart). However, Richard and Kathryn have been snapping at each other for the last few weeks. In a bit of a showdown before attending their anniversary party, Richard admits that he is in love with Kathryn's sister Evelyn, and Kathryn admits her short temper has been because she realizes this. Kathryn also states that she would never agree to a divorce. Realize that Evelyn (Alexis Smith) is innocent in all of this as Richard has been worshiping her from afar.That night, on the way back from their anniversary party, Richard is gazing at Evelyn through the rear view mirror and has an automobile accident as a result of not paying attention to the road. Evelyn and Kathryn are unharmed, but Richard has broken his leg. Richard uses this injury, and the fact that no doctor can be sure at what point he'll regain the use of his leg, to come up with a rather clever scheme for killing his wife. After recovering his mobility, he continues to behave as though incapacitated. With everyone believing him immobilized by his injury, he intercepts his wife's car on a remote mountain road, blocking the road with his own car. He kills his wife and then sends the car off a cliff with Kathryn inside. A large group of logs go off the cliff with the car making a kind of eery formation on top of it and obscuring the wreck. The car does not catch fire.Now all Richard has to do is go back to town undetected, still playing the cripple, and now playing the worried husband as well when his wife does not reach her destination. With Evelyn at his side to provide moral support, his plan is to wait for the alerted state police to find his wife's car and thus her body. Then he'll be free to court Evelyn. However, there is one snag - the police never find Kathryn's body or her car. On top of that, Kathryn's things that were with her when she died are showing up one by one - in Richard's desk, in his bedroom, in his luggage when he goes on a trip. The scent of Kathryn's perfume fills their room one night. He even sees someone who is dressed just like his wife on the street one day and follows her - she disappears into thin air. Whatever is going on here? Was Kathryn unharmed in this second accident as well? Is she playing with him? Unlike most mysteries, this one is not something that needs to be explained to the audience at the end, although it is. If you watch the film closely enough you'll figure out exactly what happened before it starts happening - but you have to pay attention.

309182,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302375819,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 2]","Warner Brothers had problems with all their big male stars. Edward Robinson, Jimmy Cagney, and then Humphrey Bogart all outgrew their gangster roles and wanted to do more engaging work. So each was launched on their path, with varying degrees of success, away from the gangster genre and into more fully flushed out roles.By 1945 Bogart had already redefined himself with ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Casablanca"" (1942), and ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944), but ""Conflict"" (1945) was a step even further away from his re-defined persona. In this film he plans a married engineer, two elements that Bogart was rarely associated with. Moreover, he plays a murderer, and he hadn't played a villain since ""Virginia City"" (1940) and wouldn't play one again until 1948 (""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""). So we have several exceptions here - a married Bogart, who is an engineer and business owner, and a villain/murderer.In the first half of the film, Bogart gets to experience his new persona, and one can only imagine the theme is lifted from his personal life. On screen the married Bogart is attracted to the young girl and wants to leave his wife, just as the real 45 year old  Bogart had been attracted to the 19 year old Lauren Bacall and left his older wife. Bogie and Bacall started their affair in 1944 and this film is dated 1945.In the second half of the film, Bogart returns to character and his speech and mannerisms are more like Sam Spade than the educated Richard Mason whom he is supposed to be playing.The real treat is Sydney Greenstreet who plays a Psychoanalyst.  Psychoanalysis was all the rage in Hollywood in the mid 40s, and it intrudes heavily into this film. Other popular psychological dramatic films include Hitchcock's 1945 thriller ""Spellbound"", ""Home of the Brave"" (1948), and ""The Snake Pit"" (1949).Greenstreet had a distinguished film career. He debuted as Kasper Gutman in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and who ever had a better film debut. He went on to roles opposite Bogart in ""Casablanca"" (1942) and ""Passage to Marseille"" (1944). Greenstreet is wonderful in this film and apart from ""The Maltese Falcon"" this may be his best performance.Alexis Smith plays Bogart's young love interest. Smith was a popular co-star with such film giants as Errol Flynn (4 films, including ""Gentleman Jim""), Bogart (2 films), and Frederick March (""Mark Twain""), Cary Grant (""Night and Day""), Clark Gable (""Any Number""), and Paul Newman ""(Young Philadelphians""). Smith is perky yet conflicted and her scenes with Bogart are memorable.This was the second film for director Curtis Bernhardt. Bernhardt tries to shoot the film in a film noir tradition, but all things considered, it is a noble if failed effort. Bernhardt went on to make several unremarkable films, revisiting psychiatric treatment in ""Possessed"" (1947), and teaming with Bogart again in Sirocco (1951).The film is a reasonable thriller, marred by two plot flaws that I can't mention lest I spoil the film for you. Here's a hint - one revolves around a police action and the other is a function of the law.But don't be fooled by the people who describe this as ""film noir"". Yes, there are some noir touches, but many of the essential noir elements are missing. For example, there is no femme fatale and no real double (much less triple) crosses. True, there is murder, deception, and lots of night scenes, and the ending is hardly happy for some of the participants. Yet for some the film does have a happy ending, and there are none of the miscreant cast of shady characters that one expects from the traditional film noir.For Bogart fans the first half is a treat, and for fans of Greenstreet this is a real thrill.",3,Bogart as an engineer,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,3692,"['Warner', 'Brothers', 'had', 'problems', 'big', 'male', 'stars', 'Edward', 'Robinson', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'then', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'outgrew', 'gangster', 'roles', 'wanted', 'do', 'more', 'engaging', 'work', 'So', 'was', 'launched', 'path', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'away', 'gangster', 'genre', 'more', 'fully', 'flushed', 'out', 'roles.By', '1945', 'Bogart', 'had', 'already', 'redefined', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', '1941', 'Casablanca', '1942', 'Have', 'Have', 'Not', '1944', 'Conflict', '1945', 'was', 'step', 'even', 'further', 'away', 're-defined', 'persona', 'film', 'married', 'engineer', 'two', 'elements', 'Bogart', 'was', 'rarely', 'associated', 'Moreover', 'murderer', 'had', ""n't"", 'played', 'villain', 'Virginia', 'City', '1940', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'one', 'again', '1948', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'have', 'several', 'exceptions', 'here', 'married', 'Bogart', 'who', 'engineer', 'business', 'owner', 'villain/murderer.In', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Bogart', 'experience', 'new', 'persona', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'theme', 'lifted', 'personal', 'life', 'screen', 'married', 'Bogart', 'attracted', 'young', 'girl', 'leave', 'wife', 'just', 'real', '45', 'year', 'old', 'Bogart', 'had', 'been', 'attracted', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'left', 'older', 'wife', 'Bogie', 'Bacall', 'started', 'affair', '1944', 'film', 'dated', '1945.In', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'Bogart', 'character', 'speech', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'more', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'educated', 'Richard', 'Mason', 'whom', 'supposed', 'be', 'playing.The', 'real', 'treat', 'Sydney', 'Greenstreet', 'who', 'Psychoanalyst', 'Psychoanalysis', 'was', 'rage', 'Hollywood', 'mid', '40s', 'heavily', 'film', 'Other', 'popular', 'psychological', 'dramatic', 'films', 'include', 'Hitchcock', '1945', 'thriller', 'Spellbound', 'Home', 'Brave', '1948', 'Snake', 'Pit', '1949', '.Greenstreet', 'had', 'distinguished', 'film', 'career', 'debuted', 'Kasper', 'Gutman', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', '1941', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'better', 'film', 'debut', 'went', 'roles', 'opposite', 'Bogart', 'Casablanca', '1942', 'Passage', 'Marseille', '1944', 'Greenstreet', 'wonderful', 'film', 'apart', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'performance.Alexis', 'Smith', 'Bogart', 'young', 'love', 'interest', 'Smith', 'was', 'popular', 'co-star', 'such', 'film', 'giants', 'Errol', 'Flynn', '4', 'films', 'including', 'Gentleman', 'Jim', 'Bogart', '2', 'films', 'Frederick', 'March', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Night', 'Day', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Number', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Young', 'Philadelphians', 'Smith', 'perky', 'yet', 'conflicted', 'scenes', 'Bogart', 'are', 'memorable.This', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Bernhardt', 'Bernhardt', 'shoot', 'film', 'film', 'noir', 'tradition', 'things', 'considered', 'noble', 'failed', 'effort', 'Bernhardt', 'went', 'make', 'several', 'unremarkable', 'films', 'revisiting', 'psychiatric', 'treatment', 'Possessed', '1947', 'teaming', 'Bogart', 'again', 'Sirocco', '1951', '.The', 'film', 'reasonable', 'thriller', 'marred', 'two', 'plot', 'flaws', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mention', 'lest', 'spoil', 'film', 'Here', 'hint', 'one', 'police', 'action', 'other', 'function', 'law.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'people', 'who', 'describe', 'film', 'noir', 'Yes', 'are', 'noir', 'touches', 'many', 'essential', 'noir', 'elements', 'are', 'missing', 'example', 'femme', 'fatale', 'real', 'double', 'much', 'less', 'triple', 'crosses', 'True', 'murder', 'deception', 'lots', 'night', 'scenes', 'ending', 'hardly', 'happy', 'participants', 'film', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'are', 'none', 'miscreant', 'cast', 'shady', 'characters', 'one', 'traditional', 'film', 'noir.For', 'Bogart', 'first', 'half', 'treat', 'fans', 'Greenstreet', 'real', 'thrill']",N/A

The couple have a close friend, a psychology professor (Sydney Greenstreet) who gushes about how happy they are at an anniversary party, and this only makes things worse, especially as Evelyn is present. On the way home from the party, Richard crashes the car. The two women are safe but he injures his leg. While recuperating, he hatches a plot to do away with Kathryn so that he can have Evelyn - despite no evidence that she loves him. He manages to get her killed in another auto accident, but soon finds evidence that she may still be around.Mason's deteriorating state, and the odd occurrences -- in particular a great sequence in which he follows the apparent ghost or still-living Kathryn from a distance into an empty house -- are the best part of the film, and so I was disappointed that the ending was so abrupt and the spookiness brushed off as deliberate ploys on the part of Greenstreet and the cops, who know that he's guilty but just can't prove it.  Ultimately, this is neither hard-boiled enough to be really exciting and compelling, nor dreamlike enough to be unsettling and unnerving - it just doesn't quite hit the key noir qualities for me.  Still, Bogart and Greenstreet are solid, and I liked the rather artificial sets which gave it an ""anytown"" feel -- something that was lost with the location shooting that tends to dominate later noir from about 1947-48 on.Overall then fairly minor, but as with every film Bogart was in after 1938 or so, it ought to be on DVD.

309198,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302375819,Simon Davis,"[37, 39]","""Conflict"", starring the always excellent Humphrey Bogart is often dismissed as minor league noir and a fairly ordinary entry in Bogart's sterling collection of film performances. On the contrary I've always found it terrific entertainment that really keeps you guessing and asking questions right up to the final frame. It is a most handsome production with all of Warner Bros. expertise on show in the overall look and feel of the piece and in the excellent performances by the male and female cast members in this story of murder, deceit and mystery.The film begins with the fifth wedding anniversary for affluent married couple engineer Richard Mason and his wife Katherine (Humphrey Bogart and Rose Habart). To the outside world they appear to be the perfect married couple with everything in life, however in reality Richard is most unhappy with his critical demanding wife and is secretly in love with her alluring younger sister Evelyn (Alexis Smith),who also has strong feelings for Richard. Resulting from a car accident the night of the party where Richard breaks a leg but from which Katherine walks away without a scratch, Richard has time to consider his unsatisfying marital situation and hatches an elaborate plan to do away with his shrewish wife and replace her with her younger sister. Pretending to be confined to a wheelchair when in actual fact he is now able to walk with the aid of a cane, Richard executes a supposedly fool proof murder plan. He pretends to plan a trip away with Katherine to a remote mountain resort and at the last minute on the pretext of work has her go on ahead. He then drives via a shorter route to a mountain pass and there waits for and then murders Katherine, pushing her car over the side of the mountain. He then quickly returns home and resumes the role of the chair bound invalid. What was supposedly the perfect crime soon becomes a living nightmare as strange things begin to happen that seem to indicate that perhaps Katherine is not dead at all. Her perfume is smelt in the house, jewelry she wore the night of the murder begins to turn up, a pawn ticket signed by Katherine is mailed to him and Richard thinks he sees Katherine walking in the street and then disappearing without trace into a strange house. Richard begins to question his sanity and eventualy his uncertainity about whether his murder plan was successful drives him back to the scene of the crime where all is revealed and the truth comes out!Directed with suitable flair by veteran director Curtis  Bernhardt and based on a short story by Robert Siodmak and Alfred Neumann, ""Conflict"", is a riverting little murder mystery that benefits greatly from the writing and four lead performances. Bogart is excellent as Richard Mason in a rather unlikeable role and is particulary good in the scenes where he sets up the deception and where the strange return of his wife seemingly from the grave begins to unhinge his tortured guilt ridden mind. This film reunites him with his ""Maltese Falcon"" costar the superb Sydney Greenstreet in a great performance as family friend Dr. Mark Hamilton who is the one who discovers the clue as to what actually happened on the night of the murder. Rose Hobart in a rare 1940's role is excellent in the small but telling part of murder victim Katherine Mason who might or might not be dead. Her's is not a likeable character and her few scenes with Bogart reveal her as a grating and demanding person responsible for always belittling Richard  while of course still not deserving the fate she endures. Alexis Smith provides her usual glamourous presence to the role of Evelyn Turner, Katherine's younger sister who finds herself embroiled in the family complications. But as always in his films Bogart is the life and soul of the production. Menacing while showing a certain vulnerability and uneasiness with what he has done, he turns an unlikeable character into someone you do find yourself caring for. That is the sign of a truly great actor.""Conflict"", may not be in the top draw of Bogie classics but it is a very enjoyable little murder mystery that stays in the mind long after seeing it. Warners spared no expense in bringing it to the screen and what we have is 80 minutes of terrific entertainment with character work as could only be done with such finesse in Hollywood's golden age.
