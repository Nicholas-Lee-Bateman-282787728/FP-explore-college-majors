This film confirms the difference written words can make and how they can possibly open the door to further relationship...like when a parent doesn't get through for one reason or another, others can.  In this case a teenager and octogenerian connect, affect and enrich each other's lives creating positive change in other relationships.Though there were major differences in generational lifestyles between the teenage girl and the senior, his encouraging letter bridges the gap enough to have her want to find the writer.  Yes, this film is good for anyone yet a couple comments reveal he is a Christian. Isn't his willingness to step outside of his normal life to attend her singing performance an important aspect?  This demonstrates all the more that love is more than words, it's action, not a noun but a verb.After watching this film I realized I was a letter writer and one can possibly make a difference whether or not there is response. In this age of texting and e-mail, there is still a place for a snail mail note.
