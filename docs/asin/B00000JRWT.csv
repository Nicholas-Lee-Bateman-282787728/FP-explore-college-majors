Almost all the performances were excellent.  Especially Patrick Dempsey, as a man with Lou Gherig's disease confined to a wheelchair, who can only speak with the aid of a computer.  That must have been the most difficult role of his career and he did a superb job.  Robert Downey Jr. plays a freaky film director.  I was so tickled every time he was on screen, he was delightfully wacko!  I say almost all the performances were excellent, with the exception of Sean Penn, who seemed to have aobut as much enthusiasm as a bowl of soggy cornflakes.

Martin ""ffej26""","[6, 12]","It's a shame that you can get an all star cast like Sean Penn, Robert Downey Jr, Patrick Dempsey, and Malcolm Mcdowell, and many others and get such a slow paced, corny, movie. The movie is about a pool cleaner named Hugo, played by the charming Alyssa Milano, and her eccentric clients as well as her crazy parents(Mcdowell and Cathy Moriarty). The movie is cute and quirky but moves wat too slow. I never cared about any of the characters except Alyssa Milano's and Patrick Dempsey, who plays a parapalegic who falls in love with Hugo. Whenever there was a scene without Alyssa Milano the movie bore me too tears. Thank God she is in most of the movie. Sean Penn is terrible a guy who wears blue suede shoes and Robert Downey Jr is way over the top as a eccentric dutch alchoholic. Instead of caring about these characters I felt sorry for them. i highly recommend this film for Alyssa Milano fans. She is a revelation in this movie.

Robert Downey, Jr., Malcom McDowell, Richard Lewis, Cathy Moriarty, and Patrick Dempsey also star in the film.I found the film fresh, refreshing, and a mild surprise.  You'd expect a film where one of the principal characters is dying of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) to perhaps lapse into deep maudlin territory, but it doesn't.  Instead, the thread of other stories, all revolving around an effort to fill mobster Lewis' pool in the middle of a drought, balance each other out to lend a sense of lightness and humor to the enterprise.It's a fun film to watch.  Unlike other reviewers, I wasn't put off by Penn's or Downey's performances.  I thought they were fine.  In a movie such as this, you don't expect slavish adherence to some 'truth' as you might demand from a factual work.  The movie is more of a flight of fancy, and it's enjoyable as such.Another thing to comment on is the wonderful cinemaphotography.

507926,A21NNE4AW7R9K0,B00000JRWT,"S. Smith ""theseanman""","[11, 13]","I first saw this movie when it was on cable and since my eyes (among other things) perk up when I see the lovely and much underrated Alyssa Milano, I purchased the DVD recently.As a movie, it has its charms, although practically all the actors should be wearing &quot;contractual obligation&quot; t-shirts because their efforts and expressions fairly shout out &quot;I can't believe I'm doing this either&quot;.Where to begin? Well, Alyssa Milano shines in this movie, it is hers and her mere presence elevates every scene she is in. Cathy Moriarty does well as her mother and deserves more screen time.Malcolm Mc Dowell does a passable job in the cartoonishly irresponsible and drug addled role of the father. It's all downhill from there, except for Patrick Dempsey in what is essentially an non-speaking role. I've always liked his work.I would say that Sean Penn is woefully miscast and under used in his role, evoking memories of &quot;Rain Man&quot; as a character of no fixed purpose except to give Hugo's Father someone to talk to on the journey to get some water from the Colorado River. OH! and the blue shoes, mustn't forget them. Robert Downey Jr. Appears to have gone the method route as a completely insane and one must assume drug addicted Hollywood director. His performance might be easier to watch if it were not for his recent troubles making one think his performance is a &quot;little too good&quot;.Richard Lewis essentially plays himself, neuroses and all, except for being a feared mobster whose request for water to fill his 5,000 gallon pool during a drought drives the subplot containing Penn and McDowell. There are scattered colorful characters here and there that Hugo encounters on the course of her busy day that provide amusement. This DVD is hardly a classic and were it not for Ms. Milano it would be a coaster on my coffee table. She is beautiful, talented and funny and just needs a breakout role to put her over the top. Something that will make the world take notice.In summary, I feel this is an okay DVD to rent if you want 93 minutes to kill with mild amusement. Buy it only if you're a true Alyssa fan.
