1614126,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00AN5LCV8,C. Sawin,"[3, 3]","Ah Tao (Deanie Ip) has been attending to Roger's (Andy Lau) family for 60 years. As a movie producer who is always going to meetings out of town, Roger seems to take Ah Tao's maid services for granted; that all changes when Ah Tao has a stroke, retires, and willingly decides to live in a retirement home. Now with their roles reversed, Roger is unsure whether he'll be able to tend to Ah Tao the way she did to his family for generations while Ah Tao just wants to avoid being a burden. However their bond only grows stronger with the role reversal and their relationship seems to amplify because of it.Andy Lau has become fairly well-known in the states for his performances in the crime trilogy ""Infernal Affairs,"" action films such as ""Fulltime Killer,"" ""The Legend of Drunken Master,"" and ""Shaolin,"" the comedy ""God of Gamblers,"" and the mystery film ""Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame."" Like most stars from Hong Kong who are approaching middle age, Lau has practically made a permanent jump to the dramatic genre in recent years where his career is suddenly more performance driven rather than taking as much of a physical toll as the films from his past.The chemistry between Andy Lau and Deanie Ip along with the superb writing of ""A Simple Life"" is what makes the film worth seeing. The drama probably isn't exactly the type of film that would usually appeal to your interests, but it feels so genuine and is so structurally based in reality that you can't help but realize how strong the film really is. The relationship between Ah Tao and Roger is incredible. Their laughter, the endless amount of stories they have for one another, and that tearful look in their eyes whenever something even remotely sentimental comes up is just extraordinary. The two actors do an outstanding job of portraying two people who seem to have known each other forever. Meanwhile the writing illustrates the ups and downs anyone's everyday life could possibly have. Life throws you curveballs and it isn't always a cake walk, but you deal with it the best you can and try to enjoy the little things since you know they won't be around forever. ""A Simple Life"" adds weight to that aspect. Sometimes the simplest things in life are the most enjoyable.The film is mostly Roger traveling nonstop while Ah Tao tries to busy herself while he's away. They seem to gripe at each other constantly until Ah Tao has her stroke and then they're always laughing around each other while only growing closer in the process. Seeing the likes of Tsui Hark and Sammo Hung have special appearances in the film is a nice surprise, but the bits of humor the film threw at you when you least expected it are a nice surprise as well. Roger getting mistaken for the AC repair man and the search for a new maid were pretty humorous, but Ah Tao observing the other tenants at the retirement home is where the film's funniest moments reside. You see two old men get into an escalated argument, another use the wrong pair of false teeth to eat his dinner, and the rather eccentric Uncle Kin (Paul Chun) whose communicating antics and persistent desire to borrow HK$300 from everyone around him makes the supporting character extremely memorable.""A Simple Life"" has this incredible charm to it that not only has you admiring the relationship between Ah Tao and Roger but also the weight it puts into its heartfelt message. Driven by the fantastic performances of Andy Lau and Deanie Ip and its authentic writing, ""A Simple Life"" is the type of film you pop in to remind yourself that there is hope for the human race.",3,An authentically written and fairly satisfying drama,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,3598,"['Ah', 'Tao', 'Deanie', 'Ip', 'been', 'attending', 'Roger', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'family', '60', 'years', 'movie', 'producer', 'who', 'always', 'going', 'meetings', 'town', 'Roger', 'take', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'maid', 'services', 'granted', 'changes', 'when', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'stroke', 'willingly', 'decides', 'live', 'retirement', 'home', 'Now', 'roles', 'reversed', 'Roger', 'unsure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'tend', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'way', 'did', 'family', 'generations', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'just', 'avoid', 'being', 'burden', 'However', 'bond', 'only', 'stronger', 'role', 'reversal', 'relationship', 'amplify', 'it.Andy', 'Lau', 'become', 'fairly', 'well-known', 'states', 'performances', 'crime', 'trilogy', 'Infernal', 'Affairs', 'action', 'films', 'such', 'Fulltime', 'Killer', 'Legend', 'Drunken', 'Master', 'Shaolin', 'comedy', 'God', 'Gamblers', 'mystery', 'film', 'Detective', 'Dee', 'Mystery', 'Phantom', 'Flame', 'most', 'stars', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'who', 'are', 'approaching', 'middle', 'age', 'Lau', 'practically', 'made', 'permanent', 'jump', 'dramatic', 'genre', 'recent', 'years', 'where', 'career', 'suddenly', 'more', 'performance', 'driven', 'rather', 'taking', 'much', 'physical', 'toll', 'films', 'past.The', 'chemistry', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'Deanie', 'Ip', 'superb', 'writing', 'A', 'Simple', 'Life', 'what', 'film', 'seeing', 'drama', 'probably', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'type', 'film', 'would', 'usually', 'appeal', 'interests', 'so', 'genuine', 'so', 'structurally', 'based', 'reality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'realize', 'how', 'strong', 'film', 'really', 'relationship', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'Roger', 'incredible', 'laughter', 'endless', 'amount', 'stories', 'have', 'one', 'tearful', 'look', 'eyes', 'something', 'even', 'remotely', 'sentimental', 'up', 'just', 'extraordinary', 'two', 'actors', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'portraying', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'forever', 'Meanwhile', 'writing', 'ups', 'downs', 'anyone', 'everyday', 'life', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'Life', 'curveballs', ""n't"", 'always', 'cake', 'walk', 'deal', 'best', 'can', 'try', 'enjoy', 'little', 'things', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'around', 'forever', 'A', 'Simple', 'Life', 'weight', 'aspect', 'Sometimes', 'simplest', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'most', 'enjoyable.The', 'film', 'mostly', 'Roger', 'traveling', 'nonstop', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'busy', 'away', 'seem', 'gripe', 'other', 'constantly', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'stroke', 'then', ""'re"", 'always', 'laughing', 'other', 'only', 'growing', 'closer', 'process', 'Seeing', 'likes', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'have', 'special', 'appearances', 'film', 'nice', 'surprise', 'bits', 'humor', 'film', 'threw', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'are', 'nice', 'surprise', 'as', 'well', 'Roger', 'getting', 'mistaken', 'AC', 'repair', 'man', 'search', 'new', 'maid', 'were', 'pretty', 'humorous', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'observing', 'other', 'tenants', 'retirement', 'home', 'where', 'film', 'funniest', 'moments', 'reside', 'see', 'two', 'old', 'men', 'get', 'escalated', 'argument', 'use', 'wrong', 'pair', 'false', 'teeth', 'eat', 'dinner', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'Uncle', 'Kin', 'Paul', 'Chun', 'communicating', 'antics', 'persistent', 'desire', 'borrow', 'HK', '300', 'everyone', 'supporting', 'character', 'extremely', 'memorable', 'A', 'Simple', 'Life', 'incredible', 'charm', 'not', 'only', 'admiring', 'relationship', 'Ah', 'Tao', 'Roger', 'also', 'weight', 'heartfelt', 'message', 'Driven', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'Deanie', 'Ip', 'authentic', 'writing', 'Simple', 'Life', 'type', 'film', 'pop', 'remind', 'hope', 'human', 'race']",A Simple LIfe 2012

1614128,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00AN5LCV8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Filmmaker Ann Hui as had a number of films that have resonated strongly with viewers.Her films typically take on a subject that showcase a darker side of Hong Kong.  Films such as ""July Rhapsody"" (teacher/student relationship), ""Goddess of Mercy"" (justice), ""Night and Fog"" (murder) and ""All About Love"" (single mothers, same sex marriages).With the film ""A Simple Life"", which was written by Susan Chan and Yan-lam Lee, Ann Hui takes on life and taking care of an older loved one who is sick.One of the most recognizable things that Asian cinema fans will discover about Ann Hui's work is her ability to find the right talent to play the role of the main characters, in this case, Andy Lau (""Infernal Affairs"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""The Warlords"") and Deannie Yip (""Dragons Forever"", ""Crying Heart"").""A Simple Life"" would win the Volpi Cup for Best Actress Award for Deannie Yip and the La Navicella Award for Anna Hui at the 68th Venice International Film Festival; winner for Best Director, Best Leading Actor and Best Leading Actress at the 48th Golden Horse Awards and was included in Roger Ebert's top 10 list for 2012.VIDEO:""A Simple Life"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  Shot with a Red One camera, where one will see this film look incredible is through the closeups.  From the facial details to overall textures of the clothing, you can see amazing detail.  Colors are warm and  I detected no banding or aliasing. Cinematography from Nelso Yu Lik-wai (""Still Life"", ""Dream Home"") was great when either capturing human emotion or frailty, Hong Kong during Chinese New Year.  If anything, this one of the most beautiful films from HK that I have seen on Blu-ray.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""A Simple Life"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital 2.0.  As one would expect from a film such as ""A Simple Life"", there are times that not many words are said on screen.  It's about facial expressions during the quiet settings but the film is primarily dialogue driven with the exception of a brief fireworks scene that utilizes the surround and actually sounds fantastic.  But aside from that one scene, this is a dialogue driven film.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""A Simple Life"" come with the following special features:Trailer - (2:14) The theatrical trailer for ""A Simple Life"".JUDGMENT CALL:Growing up with traditional Asian values in America, it was always ingrained by my grandfather at an early age that our responsibility was to take care of the family when they get older.Watching ""A Simple Life"", the film was quite profound because it captured the essence of aging and frailty but also family.In this case, a servant that has been with the family since a young age, taking care of four generations and as family have scattered around the world, the aging servant, Ah Tao, now stays with film producer, Roger.Roger has been raised by Ah Tao and even at 70, she continues to cook, clean and shop for him, even take care of him and keep him healthy after having a heart attack.  But now, the roles are reversed and after Ah Tao suffers a stroke and wants to live in a nursing home, Roger makes sure that she knows family is nearby.  Even if it's just him, he wants to give back to the woman who had taken care of him.She may not be of the same blood, but he regards her as close family.And what I enjoy about this film is the contrast of how films about elderly are shown in America versus Hong Kong.  In America, we tend to see the banality of films of elderly abuse to a family disconnect and the loneliness that the elderly is facing.While we do see that loneliness of various elderly in this film, its more of seeing things through the eyes of Ah Tao and a wonderful performance by actress Deanie Ip who communicates through eye movement and facial expression.After suffering a stroke, Ah Tao is able to rehabilitate but while living at the senior home, it's that feeling that this is a place you are going to die, the people around you are also going to die very soon and it's all about time.But unlike other seniors who suffer from Alzheimer's or dementia, Ah Tao still has quite a bit of life.  She is able to make friends but she enjoys the time that she spends with Roger, because he can joke with her, eat lunch or dinner with her and he brings her along to places, including a film premiere.But it's the portrayal of Ah Tao that captivates the viewer.  She is a woman who has lived as a good servant.  Never the type to take gifts or even cash, she wants to pay things her own way and do it herself.  Granted, Roger takes care of the costs at the senior home because it's quite expensive but for Ah Tao, she is a woman who doesn't want to be a burden to Roger or the family.She's a strong woman who is calling the shots of how her life is to be lived, no matter how hard it is for Roger and family who treated this woman like family to accept.And we see that bond between Ah Tao and Roger as she spends time in the Senior home and seeing how she deals with loneliness or knowing that people around her will not be around that long.As Deanie Ip is remarkable in this role, Andy Lau looks like a man who has never aged.  At 51, he still looks like he's 30-something.  But aside from the gun or sword-toting characters or the suave playboy or businessman roles that he tends to play, Lau plays the role of a caring man, a film producer but one that doesn't live like fame has changed him.  Still wearing a backpack and coat, he is often mistaken as a taxi driver or air conditioning repair employee, suffice to say, this is the most subdued role that he plays amazingly well.For Asian cinema fans, also intriguing are the supporting actors and guest cameos in this film.  Anthony Wong, Angela Baby, Raymond Chow, Wing-Chiu Chan, Sammo Hung, Stanley Kwan, Chapman To, Hark Tsui, to name a few.While I loved the film, there were a few scenes that probably could have been edited out as they served no true purpose (but to show more cameos), but for the most part, this is a very good film that I have found nothing negative to say about it.The film reminds me a bit of my family who left behind servants because they moved to America but even to this day, my mother talked about the servants (the good ones) who took care of the family and how she visits or communicates with them today.As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality is fantastic and for Asian cinema from Well Go USA Entertainment, this is the best film I have seen on Blu-ray from the company in which detail was amazingly captured via Red One but also the cinematography is well-done and lossless audio is crisp and clear.  I wish there were more special features but considering many Asian cinema on Blu-ray (released in the U.S as of late.) rarely have them, at least a trailer was included.Overall, ""A Simple Life"" is a profound film from director Anna Hui that captures the story of the elderly, aging and frailty but also human nature.  Featuring a fantastic performance by actress Deanie Ip, ""A Simple Life"" is a fantastic film that is worth owning on Blu-ray!",4,"""A Simple Life"" is a profound film from director Anna Hui that

1614131,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00AN5LCV8,Richard B. Schwartz,"[0, 0]","This is perhaps the best of the films shown at Ebertfest, 2014.  A small, sweet film based on a true story, it concerns an aging servant of a Hong Kong family.  She works for a film producer and shares his tiny apartment.  In the past she functioned as a nanny to the young man and now, as she approaches death, he is taking care of her.  The world of the film is heavily circumscribed.  We learn little of the man's experience beyond the family circle, though we learn that he has undergone angioplasty for a heart condition and he must now watch his diet.  This is difficult for him, because his nanny is a superb cook and some of her specialties are cholesterol-laden.  The plot consists of a series of scenes that involve role-reversal, as he takes care of her as her health deteriorates.  The film is not sad, however, and it is certainly not melodramatic or sentimental.  It is sweet and loving and the direction (by Ann Hui) is superb.  This is a small masterpiece.  The camera work is very special, particularly in the different paces achieved when we see the man, Roger, relating to the servant, Ah Tao, and the scenes in which he is relating to his male colleagues in the film industry.  The individual performances are excellent.  Deannie Yip came out of retirement to play the role of Ah Tao and Andy Lau is, as David Bordwell pointed out, the George Clooney of Hong Kong (except that Lau can act far better).
