1150018,A2GM9DYHD8O7UK,B0015NQEMY,R. Hansen,"[5, 11]","I just found out that the Giants ""Road To Super Bowl XLII"" DVD's are being releasd and I just can't wait! I watched every game they played this season except the loss against Minnesota (not a bad game to miss) and they left a lasting mark on me that the rarest of teams do-(the 1986 & 1990 Giants, the 1993-94 Rangers, the 1992-93 & 93-94 Knicks, the 1986 Mets & the 1995-2001 Yankees). The 2007 Giants were one of the most enjoyable teams for me to watch & root passionately for and their ultimate victory was one of the sweetest and maybe the best ever. Remember, they were not supposed to be very good, Tiki had hung 'em up & bashed 'em from pillar to post whenever he could. Coughlin was under constant criticism from the fans, the media and his own players and was given a lame duck 1 year extension. Eli was being dragged through the mud amid omnipresent comparisons to his brother and we were reminded with every int. or fumble that trading Rivers and those picks to get him from San Diego was a monumental mistake. The corners and safeties were either too old or not very good and the heart of the team was questioned and scrutinized after a 6-2 start in '06 ended up 8-8 and one and done in the playoffs. All of this adversity pointed to a 5-11 season maybe 6-10, especially after the Week 2 blowout against Green Bay. Then the pieces slowly came together, there was that fantastic goal-line stop in Washington in the 4th when the Giants came all the way back to win. They won 6 in a row and people were starting to talk about the ""new"" Coughlin and the new defensive coordinator, and his attacking style of defense that reminded many of Parcell's ""Big Blue Wrecking Crew"" of Taylor, Banks, Carson, Reasons, Marshall & Pepper. This was a team that entertained you and thrilled you and also frustrated and annoyed you. The term ""inconsistant"" was tossed around alot in any Giants discussion but there was this underlying sense that this was a special team growing and quickly coming into it's own as something potentially great. The week 17 game was a classic from start to finish. The intense media crush was on Coughlin to rest his starters for the playoffs against a team that was playing for a perfect 16-0 season. The Giants had nothing to play for anyway, they were already in the playoffs. They came out and almost beat the Pats that night in the most exciting regular season game all year. They would use that as a springboard to finally dispatch of playoff nemesis Garcia (payback for '02 and '06) and the Bucs and then played two of the greatest playoff games in history by defeating division winners Dallas and Green Bay on the road. The Dallas game was oh so sweet (especially after the trash talking of Patrick Crayton)and the over-time championship game at Green Bay was a stone cold classic. The way they were playing looked like a team of destiny, as my co-worker told me: ""They're playing like they simply won't lose to anyone"" The Super Bowl was almost surreal. The Giants held the only 18-0 team in history to 14 points and overwhelmed the great Tom Brady and his record setting offense with a defensive performance for the ages. Without hyperbole, the Eli to Tyree play will go down as the greatest play in Super Bowl, if not NFL, history. The rainbow pass to Plax in the corner endzone was the most beautiful site of the season. 18-0 became 18-1 as the Giants, did indeed give the Pats one giant loss. I had to repeatedly watch the game and highlights on my dvr, NFL network and ESPN to convince myself it wan't a dream. This DVD set will allow me to relive all these incredible moments and i can't wait to watch Big Blue knock off the mighty Patriots and prove the naysayers wrong all over again!",5,I'm In Blue Heaven,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,3726,"['just', 'found', 'out', 'Giants', 'Road', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XLII', 'DVD', 'are', 'being', 'releasd', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watched', 'game', 'played', 'season', 'loss', 'Minnesota', 'not', 'bad', 'game', 'miss', 'left', 'lasting', 'mark', 'rarest', 'teams', 'do-', '1986', '1990', 'Giants', '1993-94', 'Rangers', '1992-93', '93-94', 'Knicks', '1986', 'Mets', '1995-2001', 'Yankees', '2007', 'Giants', 'were', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'teams', 'watch', 'root', 'passionately', 'ultimate', 'victory', 'was', 'one', 'sweetest', 'maybe', 'best', 'ever', 'Remember', 'were', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'Tiki', 'had', 'hung', ""'em"", 'up', 'bashed', 'pillar', 'post', 'whenever', 'could', 'Coughlin', 'was', 'constant', 'criticism', 'fans', 'media', 'own', 'players', 'was', 'given', 'lame', 'duck', '1', 'year', 'extension', 'Eli', 'was', 'being', 'dragged', 'mud', 'omnipresent', 'comparisons', 'brother', 'were', 'reminded', 'int', 'fumble', 'trading', 'Rivers', 'picks', 'get', 'San', 'Diego', 'was', 'monumental', 'mistake', 'corners', 'safeties', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'old', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'heart', 'team', 'was', 'questioned', 'scrutinized', '6-2', 'start', ""'06"", 'ended', 'up', '8-8', 'one', 'done', 'playoffs', 'adversity', 'pointed', '5-11', 'season', 'maybe', '6-10', 'especially', 'Week', '2', 'blowout', 'Green', 'Bay', 'Then', 'pieces', 'slowly', 'came', 'together', 'was', 'fantastic', 'goal-line', 'stop', 'Washington', '4th', 'when', 'Giants', 'came', 'way', 'back', 'win', 'won', '6', 'row', 'people', 'were', 'starting', 'talk', 'new', 'Coughlin', 'new', 'defensive', 'coordinator', 'attacking', 'style', 'defense', 'reminded', 'many', 'Parcell', 'Big', 'Blue', 'Wrecking', 'Crew', 'Taylor', 'Banks', 'Carson', 'Reasons', 'Marshall', 'Pepper', 'was', 'team', 'entertained', 'thrilled', 'also', 'frustrated', 'annoyed', 'term', 'inconsistant', 'was', 'tossed', 'alot', 'Giants', 'discussion', 'was', 'underlying', 'sense', 'was', 'special', 'team', 'growing', 'quickly', 'coming', 'own', 'something', 'potentially', 'great', 'week', '17', 'game', 'was', 'classic', 'start', 'finish', 'intense', 'media', 'crush', 'was', 'Coughlin', 'rest', 'starters', 'playoffs', 'team', 'was', 'playing', 'perfect', '16-0', 'season', 'Giants', 'had', 'nothing', 'play', 'anyway', 'were', 'already', 'playoffs', 'came', 'out', 'almost', 'beat', 'Pats', 'night', 'most', 'exciting', 'regular', 'season', 'game', 'year', 'would', 'use', 'springboard', 'finally', 'dispatch', 'playoff', 'nemesis', 'Garcia', 'payback', ""'02"", 'Bucs', 'then', 'played', 'two', 'greatest', 'playoff', 'games', 'history', 'defeating', 'division', 'winners', 'Dallas', 'Green', 'Bay', 'road', 'Dallas', 'game', 'was', 'oh', 'so', 'sweet', 'especially', 'trash', 'talking', 'Patrick', 'Crayton', 'over-time', 'championship', 'game', 'Green', 'Bay', 'was', 'stone', 'cold', 'classic', 'way', 'were', 'playing', 'looked', 'team', 'destiny', 'co-worker', 'told', ""'re"", 'playing', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'anyone', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'was', 'almost', 'surreal', 'Giants', 'held', 'only', '18-0', 'team', 'history', '14', 'points', 'overwhelmed', 'great', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'record', 'setting', 'offense', 'defensive', 'performance', 'ages', 'hyperbole', 'Eli', 'Tyree', 'play', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'greatest', 'play', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'not', 'NFL', 'history', 'rainbow', 'pass', 'Plax', 'corner', 'endzone', 'was', 'most', 'beautiful', 'site', 'season', '18-0', 'became', '18-1', 'Giants', 'did', 'indeed', 'give', 'Pats', 'one', 'giant', 'loss', 'had', 'repeatedly', 'watch', 'game', 'highlights', 'dvr', 'NFL', 'network', 'ESPN', 'convince', 'wa', ""n't"", 'dream', 'DVD', 'set', 'will', 'allow', 'relive', 'incredible', 'moments', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'Big', 'Blue', 'knock', 'off', 'mighty', 'Patriots', 'prove', 'naysayers', 'wrong', 'over', 'again']",NFL- New York Giants - The Road to Super Bowl XLII

It is so much the usual witticism and comedy that Michael brings to it, but his actual very reasoned and thought out discussion of how football players in general and the Giants in particular think about the development of the game.  Not that Michael doesn't sound witty, but you get the picture that he is too serious about football and his own playing with the team in this game to put entertainment above accuracy.It is so good that it is hard to get it out of the DVD player!GO GIANTS!Tony Thomas who has  been a Gints fan since around 1955!",5,so good that it is hard to get it out of the DVD player!,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,622,"['Michael', 'Strahan', 'narration', 'Superbowl', 'price', 'so', 'much', 'usual', 'witticism', 'comedy', 'Michael', 'actual', 'very', 'reasoned', 'thought', 'out', 'discussion', 'how', 'football', 'players', 'general', 'Giants', 'particular', 'think', 'development', 'game', 'Not', 'Michael', ""n't"", 'sound', 'witty', 'get', 'picture', 'too', 'serious', 'football', 'own', 'playing', 'team', 'game', 'put', 'entertainment', 'accuracy.It', 'so', 'good', 'hard', 'get', 'DVD', 'player', 'GO', 'GIANTS', 'Tony', 'Thomas', 'who', 'been', 'Gints', 'fan', '1955']",NFL- New York Giants - The Road to Super Bowl XLII

At least with standard def films, they up-res to look almost as good.  Not this one.  It looks terrible on my HD tv, like watching a tape.Reissue it in HD and Widescreen....PLEASE.  Now that the NFL has finally gotten in gear with releasing full game broadcasts, they HAVE to go the final step of releasing them in both standard and high-def formats, or it's really not worth doing it at all.
