Set at the turn of the 19th century, Selleck plays the title role as a true cowboy, slowly realising that he is rapidly becoming an anachronism, to the ever evolving world around him. Unhappy with what he sees more and more, he comes to take a stand against the faceless Eastern companies threatening the very fabric of his World, in heroic, but not typical fashion, and this essentially sets up our story. Hardly action packed, and more than a few dry screen moments mean however, that Selleck really has to work hard to maintain the flow of the story, but he does so with a depth of character and credibility that is accomplished to say the least. This is probably not a movie you will sit around and talk about for hours, and will ceratinly be more popular with dedictaed fans of the genre, rather than a more mainstream audience.

Witty and intelligent. Tough as nails.  Fast and accurate with a gun.  Loyal to his friends.Monte's goal in life was simple.  He wanted to drive cows from Texas to Canada and get paid for it, if at all possible.  Unfortunately for Monte and the other range riders, the modern era is fast upon them.  Eastern corporations have begun to buy up the range and jobs are scarce.  Bespectacled, bowler topped accountants assume they know how to manage the cow business, while the likes of Monte, Chet, and Shorty swallow dust day to day.There is an interesting story line here and its fairly easy to follow.  There is a little unnecessary language and some suggestive adult relationships to take away any opportunity to make this a good family film, but altogether tame compared to most.

755386,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,B00009N1WI,a voice of reason,"[4, 5]","This 2003 remake of ""Monte Walsh"" was Tom Selleck's third (but hopefully not last) Western for TNT, and it is probably the most stirring film tribute to the end of the Old West and the cowboy way of life. This is saying quite a bit as some fine Westerns like ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Shootist"", and (even more recently) ""Open Range"" as well as other movies have dealt with the changes resulting from progress as the U.S. was about to enter the twentieth century.Other reviewers have covered the plot line in great detail already, so I won't retread that ground. Suffice it to say that, while Selleck's Monte Walsh is the hero of the picture, he is portrayed with character flaws intact as well. Montelius Walsh loves three things in life: horses, women, and drinking (and the order of these things changes at different times in his life). He is stubborn, afraid to commit to Martine (his favorite prostitute whom he does seem to love), and refuses to change. He is also hard-working and loyal to his friends, especially his best buddy Chet (played by Keith Carradine), and these qualities are what make his character heroic and the storyline affecting.I'm convinced that if Selleck had starred primarily in Westerns throughout his film career, then his movie success would have dwarfed his ""Magnum P.I."" role. The TNT Westerns, along with his three previous Westerns dating back to 1979's ""The Sacketts"", establish him as a premier cowboy actor. ""Monte Walsh"" is the finest of those efforts to date, and it is to be hoped that Selleck will 'saddle up' again soon; perhaps he'll even reunite with Sam Elliott with whom he starred in his first two made-for-TV Westerns and who has also made some first-rate Westerns for TNT.Watch this one.

755398,AO5S5N7I2U3FS,B00009N1WI,"Franck L. Strongbow Red Cloud ""Serene Warrior""","[2, 3]","This movie takes place at the end of the 1880s and captures with a resonance of realism, how the American West in the time when horses were the means of transportation, and moving stock and cattle, as well as the Frontier...passed into history.  Monte Walsh (Tome Sellect)is a stubborn old ""cowboy"" used to driving herds up North and into Canada on a horseback.  The trouble is, the 20th Centurywas approaching, and there were fewer assignments to drive live cattle across vast reaches for pay.  Corporate America was making inroads into the Frontier, and all was changing rapidly for the worse. Monte Walsh is so stubborn, he can not see the Woman in front of him, portrayed by the lovely Issabella Rossellini-who makes like a  Lady of Pleasure, but comes across as a Dame waiting for the right Man to marry her- and Walsh wastes the relationship by having dinners and intimacy with this lovely Lady who wants to be his Wife, but he resists throughout the movie.  Walsh attends  his best friends' wedding, cognizant that he really should be having his own wedding with Rossellini.  Walsh misses and wastes that opportunity.  By the time, he rides of for another adventure, his best friend is murdered in a General Store hold up gone terrible- murdered by a one time friend who panicked at the trigger- and thereafter,Walsh rides out to his Lady, when alerted by an old friend that ""she's in a bad way..."".  Sadly...she has passed away ...from consumption, and Walsh arrives in time to see the Doctor confirm her death, and the scene where Monte Walsh mourns for her while she lays in her bed, is really moving... heart wrenching. This scene alone is so touching, it reminded me how we take so much for granted in life, and it will do the same to you.The movie does not glamorize violence, and that is quite prevalent in this film.  the violences shown is a product of the circumstances as they present themselves.  The movie reminds us of what we lost by 1980 and thereafter, when the Indians were decimated and excluded from this Land that was theirs, (although it never even shows an Indian on horse back),and the horse culture was pushed out of the way for cars.  We lost a vast, beautiful Frontier, a pristine prairie, we decimated the American Indians to our great detriment, lament, and we almost killed the Buffalo into extinction, and these days, we have lost everything, even our manners!I'm reminded by this movie, how great we were as a Frontier Nation, but how hollow and shallow we have become as the manner-less, rude, selfish , unfeeling, uncaring Americans that we are today!

I'm glad that I've since come across it.Tom Selleck, in the title role, is an aging cowboy at the turn of the 19th century. Arriving back in town after wintering on the range minding a cattle herd, Monte and his trail pardner, Chet Rollins (Keith Carradine), learn that the hard season has broken the backs of the local ranch owners and their spreads are being bought up by a consortium of Eastern dudes. Jobs are scarce, but Walsh and Rollins are hired by Cal Brennan (William Devane), a former owner now managing the consortium's local holding. Cowboys are a dying breed and, as Monte and Chet soon discover, times only get tougher as even the distant bosses can't show a profit.Ostensibly in Wyoming but actually filmed in the gorgeous Canadian Rockies, MONTE WALSH is a bittersweet tale of a man, supremely talented in a very narrow niche, finding himself outliving his best friend (Chet), his long-time lover, the aging saloon whore ""Countess"" Martine (Isabella Rossellini), and his own ability to earn a living in the only craft he's ever known.Except for Selleck, Carradine, and Devane, the film is populated by actors that you may not recognize, though it's good to see again Barry Corbin (Deputy Roscoe Brown in LONESOME DOVE) as Bob the Storekeeper and William Sanderson (Lippy in LONESOME DOVE, E.B Farnum in DEADWOOD, and Larry of NEWHART) as the odiferous ranch cook, Skimpy.Perhaps the most poignant and tragic scene involves a cowboy nicknamed ""Fightin' Joe Hooker"" (James Gammon), who, at the end of his career, is relegated to ""riding fence"", i.e. stringing barbed wire to a line of fence posts stretching endlessly across the landscape - the most hated of ranch jobs. Joe got his moniker from having ridden alongside the real General ""Fightin' Joe"" Hooker at the Battle of Missionary Ridge back in '64. Now, his spirit crushed by age and lack of prospects, Joe deliberately races his mount over a precipice to their deaths. Only after his demise do the other ranch hands, while going though his meager belongings, learn that his real name was simply Albert Miller.MONTE WALSH isn't a great film, but I enjoyed it immensely for its perspicacity regarding the end of an era in general, and the challenge confronting the individual at life's useful end in particular.

Reynolds,"[23, 34]","The cowboys portrayed in this Tom Selleck western performed a disservice for all of the people today who think government assistance is the only means of improving your life.  Why, they didn't appear to need the government at all!  This, in the thinking of many Americans, is highly unpatriotic.These cowboys simply endured terrible working conditions, being outdoors in all weathers, without whining; an episode during the early part of the film shows Walsh (Selleck) driving through a terrible winter storm, all on his own, giving no thought whatever to this hazardous workplace situation or complaining to a union representative.The movie opens with numerous cowboys unemployed due to modernization and corporate expansion into the cattle industry.  They foolishly continued traveling about, in search of work, rather than appealing to the government for welfare assistance -- the implication being they were rather independent sorts given to earning their subsistence rather than begging or demanding it from the state.These unfortunate men obviously had no labor union representation whatever, and could be fired/hired based on the judgment of employers.  This in UnAmerican, as about half of us today (per a survey conducted November 2000) believe that a worker's need for his paycheck has priority over his employer's ability to provide it, since all employers are evil and rich.These cowboys were subject to egregious workplace harassment, as when they drove a herd to a railhead only to see it spooked by an insensitive engineer who considered it ""fun"" to blow the whistle and spook the herd.  The cowboys, rather than squealing to Human Resources or filing charges with the National Labor Relations Board, then horribly vandalized the train.  Because the train was owned by a large greedy corporation, that really wasn't a problem -- but the action constituted reverse harassment against the train personnel who had participated in the hostile whistle prank, as they felt scared and threatened in this hostile working environment.There was no sort of Federal Lunch Program, and the cowboys were forced to eat food cooked in obviously unregulated circumstances, vulnerable to the cook's sabotage.  (The dinner incident constituted additional harassment, but the cowboys again did not file any sort of complaint.)The big evil greedy cattle companies provided no sort of retirement programs.  It was required, after your trade usefulness had expired, for you to ride your horse over a cliff.Finally, these American cowboys didn't appear to understand the need for lawyers, as they simply took the law into their own hands and did what they thought was correct (but their thinking obviously was flawed -- see the seven paragraphs above).  They probably would have just shot a lawyer, had any lawyer on Earth possessed sufficient merit to be in the presence of men like this.",5,These Cowboys Displayed Admirable Independence,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,2880,"['cowboys', 'portrayed', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'western', 'performed', 'disservice', 'people', 'today', 'who', 'think', 'government', 'assistance', 'only', 'improving', 'life', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'need', 'government', 'thinking', 'many', 'Americans', 'highly', 'unpatriotic.These', 'cowboys', 'simply', 'endured', 'terrible', 'working', 'conditions', 'being', 'outdoors', 'weathers', 'whining', 'episode', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'Walsh', 'Selleck', 'driving', 'terrible', 'winter', 'storm', 'own', 'giving', 'thought', 'whatever', 'hazardous', 'workplace', 'situation', 'complaining', 'union', 'representative.The', 'movie', 'numerous', 'cowboys', 'unemployed', 'due', 'modernization', 'corporate', 'expansion', 'cattle', 'industry', 'foolishly', 'continued', 'traveling', 'about', 'search', 'work', 'rather', 'appealing', 'government', 'welfare', 'assistance', 'implication', 'being', 'were', 'rather', 'independent', 'sorts', 'given', 'earning', 'subsistence', 'rather', 'begging', 'demanding', 'state.These', 'unfortunate', 'men', 'obviously', 'had', 'labor', 'union', 'representation', 'whatever', 'could', 'be', 'fired/hired', 'based', 'judgment', 'employers', 'UnAmerican', 'half', 'today', 'survey', 'conducted', 'November', '2000', 'believe', 'worker', 'need', 'paycheck', 'priority', 'employer', 'ability', 'provide', 'employers', 'are', 'evil', 'rich.These', 'cowboys', 'were', 'subject', 'egregious', 'workplace', 'harassment', 'when', 'drove', 'herd', 'railhead', 'only', 'see', 'spooked', 'insensitive', 'engineer', 'who', 'considered', 'fun', 'blow', 'whistle', 'spook', 'herd', 'cowboys', 'rather', 'squealing', 'Human', 'Resources', 'filing', 'charges', 'National', 'Labor', 'Relations', 'Board', 'then', 'horribly', 'vandalized', 'train', 'train', 'was', 'owned', 'large', 'greedy', 'corporation', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'problem', 'action', 'constituted', 'reverse', 'harassment', 'train', 'personnel', 'who', 'had', 'participated', 'hostile', 'whistle', 'prank', 'felt', 'scared', 'threatened', 'hostile', 'working', 'environment.There', 'was', 'sort', 'Federal', 'Lunch', 'Program', 'cowboys', 'were', 'forced', 'eat', 'food', 'cooked', 'obviously', 'unregulated', 'circumstances', 'vulnerable', 'cook', 'sabotage', 'dinner', 'incident', 'constituted', 'additional', 'harassment', 'cowboys', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'file', 'sort', 'complaint', 'big', 'evil', 'greedy', 'cattle', 'companies', 'provided', 'sort', 'retirement', 'programs', 'was', 'required', 'trade', 'usefulness', 'had', 'expired', 'ride', 'horse', 'cliff.Finally', 'American', 'cowboys', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'understand', 'need', 'lawyers', 'simply', 'took', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'did', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'correct', 'thinking', 'obviously', 'was', 'flawed', 'see', 'seven', 'paragraphs', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'shot', 'lawyer', 'had', 'lawyer', 'Earth', 'possessed', 'sufficient', 'merit', 'be', 'presence', 'men']",Monte Walsh

What this is, is a real heartfelt tribute to the cowboy. The genuine article cowboy. In particular, it charts a group of cowboys through the decline of the golden age of the cowboy, near the end of the 19th Century. Almost the whole of the first half of the movie, there is no plot to speak of, just character exposition building up the picture of the life and character that these men had. Nothing is rushed, and yet it is never dull, thanks to an intelligent script. There are humorous moments and great lines, but plenty of pathos and melancholy too, as the characters all deal with the end of an era in their own ways. We see the cowboy-turned-outlaw, the cowboy-turned-storekeeper, the cowboy-turned-floor sweeper... but most of all we see the cowboy turned into legend. As the plot kicks in, there is nothing contrived about it, but it all feeds into the central idea of examining what men do when their purpose is taken away from them.The movie benefits from some great performances from some classic character actors such as William Devane and Barry Corbin, as well as a brilliant star turn from Tom Selleck who has never been better. It also benefits from the stunning scenery - ironically not in Wyoming as the movie suggests, but shot in Canada. The sweeping vistas, free of any trace of civilization, set against a backdrop of the Rockies, are stunning and superbly photographed.What pulls this above it's TV-movie-of-the-week origins is the sincerity poured into it by all concerned, and not least by the prolific director Simon Wincer (Lonesome Dove, Quigley Down Under... and Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles! ) and executive producer Tom Selleck. This fills the movie with those little, almost subliminal moments which make it feel real.The result is no classic big screen film, but a perfectly judged and understated homage to a bygone era. It leaves us with the notion, that though the golden age is over, there will always be real cowboys.",4,Moving tribute to the real cowboys.,1172361600,"02 25, 2007",2007,2048,"['not', 'shoot-em-up', 'Western', 'what', 'are', 'stop', 'reading', 'right', 'here', 'What', 'real', 'heartfelt', 'tribute', 'cowboy', 'genuine', 'article', 'cowboy', 'particular', 'group', 'cowboys', 'decline', 'golden', 'age', 'cowboy', 'end', '19th', 'Century', 'Almost', 'whole', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'plot', 'speak', 'just', 'character', 'exposition', 'building', 'up', 'picture', 'life', 'character', 'men', 'had', 'Nothing', 'rushed', 'yet', 'never', 'dull', 'thanks', 'intelligent', 'script', 'are', 'humorous', 'moments', 'great', 'lines', 'plenty', 'pathos', 'melancholy', 'too', 'characters', 'deal', 'end', 'era', 'own', 'ways', 'see', 'cowboy-turned-outlaw', 'cowboy-turned-storekeeper', 'cowboy-turned-floor', 'sweeper', 'most', 'see', 'cowboy', 'turned', 'legend', 'plot', 'kicks', 'nothing', 'contrived', 'central', 'idea', 'examining', 'what', 'men', 'do', 'when', 'purpose', 'taken', 'away', 'them.The', 'movie', 'benefits', 'great', 'performances', 'classic', 'character', 'actors', 'such', 'William', 'Devane', 'Barry', 'Corbin', 'as', 'well', 'brilliant', 'star', 'turn', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'also', 'benefits', 'stunning', 'scenery', 'ironically', 'not', 'Wyoming', 'movie', 'shot', 'Canada', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'free', 'trace', 'civilization', 'set', 'backdrop', 'Rockies', 'are', 'stunning', 'superbly', 'photographed.What', 'TV-movie-of-the-week', 'origins', 'sincerity', 'poured', 'concerned', 'not', 'least', 'prolific', 'director', 'Simon', 'Wincer', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'Quigley', 'Down', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'executive', 'producer', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'movie', 'little', 'almost', 'subliminal', 'moments', 'make', 'feel', 'real.The', 'result', 'classic', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'perfectly', 'judged', 'understated', 'homage', 'bygone', 'era', 'notion', 'golden', 'age', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'real', 'cowboys']",Monte Walsh

This could've been a good story because it was true at the time, which was the late 1890s.  As ranchers fell on hard times, bad weather, etc. they ended up selling out to a corporate entity which promptly let go a lot of the cowhands who historically drove cattle to markets or better grazing areas.  Then came the railroad, later motorized vehicles, and the cowboy's job went away.  How they coped with this loss is what this film tried to get across.  Monte(Tom Selleck) is the one they kept.  The other cowboys in the movie 1. Got married and was in business with his wife 2. Committed suicide because he got tired of ""riding fence"" 3. Committed armed robbery in order to survive. As a result of all of these careers by default a lot of people got killed.  The movie lasted almost two hours, yet there were many scenes that were rushed.  An example:  they are camped during a snow storm and then presto! it's spring.  Also sometimes it was hard to hear the dialogue.  Isabella Rosellini's role was never clear.  Was she the mistress of Monte and a kept woman?  Or did she work in the saloon?  Or was she once a prostitute?  Her role seemed to be that she was always waiting for Monte.

McCARTHY,"[15, 20]","Three of my five favorite Western movies concern the extinction of Western Ideals and self-reliant principles in the face of ""progress."" I commend TOM SELLECK for his desire to explore this theme, unfortunately, however, this story had already been committed to film and more successfully. True, this version illustrates a larger slice of the book upon which it was based, but that does not necessarily translate to better cinema, and it may be responsible for the slightly forced pacing of this newer rendition.MONTE WALSH (2003) does contain inspired photography and an adequately bracing (although derivative) Western score, and Fightin' Joe Hooker's demise is much better handled this time around. Otherwise, 2003 is clearly overmatched by its 1970 predecessor.A major drawback lies in the fact that SELLECK and KEITH CARRADINE lack the likeability that LEE MARVIN and JACK PALANCE brought to the principal roles. The sense of camaraderie between these two old saddle pals just does not come across. The dialogue misses the nuance and leisurely pace of the original. Where have all the ""pregnant pauses"" gone? Placed beside the earlier version, this one seems almost like a high school production where inexperienced actors rush through their lines, failing to experience the moment. Even all of the minor players of the 1970 MONTE bested the 2003 actors when it came to endowing their characterizations with distinct personality and unique, memorable qualities. Only the little dog here managed to go toe to toe to toe to toe with his 1970 counterpart.But the biggest problem of all can be found in the love story subtext. ISABELLA ROSSELLINI who played Monte's ""Countess"" this time around is no JEANNE MOREAU in the acting department. She was fine, but the 1970 MONTE WALSH gave us one of the silver screen's most beautifully rendered, understated, and underrated movie romances EVER! It was filled with subtle grace and magic. The easy-going rapport and playful attraction expressed in the original, by comparison, nearly reduces to an almost cold sniping the scenes between SELLECK and ROSSELLINI. It came as no surprise when JEANNE MOREAU revealed in an interview many years after the fact that she felt LEE MARVIN was the most masculine actor she had ever worked with. Her scenes with him in which they showed us a tender, wistful, and doomed love affair made for absolutely dynamite viewing. Trust me, BOGART and BERGMAN had nothing on MARVIN and MOREAU!My lesser complaints have to do with being bludgeoned by the Cowboy Code. Don't tell it; show it! The Code came across loud and clear in 1970 without words. Less was indeed more. The bronc-busting scene was a mere child's ride on King Arthur's Carrousel compared with the wild, 1970 ""E-Ticket"" equine roller coaster! And finally, although it's such a minor issue: I just couldn't accept Shorty Austin as a Hollywood Hunk with a Colgate Smile. Cowboys spent time in saloons; not salons. Cowboys spent time at the faro table; not the dentist's office.Yes, the 1970 MONTE WALSH remains a relatively unknown Western masterpiece.

Selleck and Rossellini have nice chemistry on screen and Selleck is at his best as Monte, the cowboy whose life and world are slowly crumbling around him despite his best effort to hold the tide of change at bay.  Eads is great as Shorty and I must say he's never looked better on the saddle.  Only Selleck, handsome as ever, exceeds him.  The scenery was beautiful and the landscape reminded me of Brokeback Mountain.

Monte Walsh (Tom Selleck) is a lifelong cowboy who doesn't embrace the idea of investors buying up land and turning it into a business enterprise. Selleck once again performs well in his role, and carries most of the weight of the film. However, while there is old west nostalgia and traditional scenes that are the norm for westerns, the plot never seems to thicken, and at times the movie is predictable.
