The ""Neverending Story"" and the ""Neverending Story II-The Next Chapter"" has finally been released on DVD! So what if it isn't widescreen? It would be great to skip to any scene in the movie and see it. I have had these movies (on VHS) since I was a little kid, which was in the 1980's. Now, even though I still have them on VHS and they work perfectly, I may still purchase them again on DVD! If you like fantasy, you'll love this. Please, ignore those 1,2,or 3 star reviews. This deserves 4 stars at the minimum, and it would only lose a star with me if the bonus features weren't that good. However, considering that these movies were released in the 1980's, you must take that into consideration. My favorite movie, Disney's ""Flight of the Navigator,"" I have on DVD and it doesn't have any bonus features. Yet, I still gave it five stars (see my review for that movie). So, if it's bonus features you're after, don't buy this. You'll be disappointed. If it's a great fantasy film (films in this case) that you are after, go for it. Great price too.

947667,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000BPL2GK,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","Bastian Balthasar Bux (Barret Oliver) is a quiet, bookish boy just beginning middle school, where he is a favorite target of the bullies, and trying to cope with the recent death of his mother and the insistence of his father (Gerald McRaney) that he needs to get past it and give his attention to real life.  When he unexpectedly acquires a copy of an ornately bound book, he discovers that ""being immersed in your reading"" isn't just an expression.  The book details the perils of the land of Fantasia, threatened by a consuming nothingness; even the Childlike Empress (Tami Stronach) (whose title suggests that her physical appearance is a magical disguise), whose powers ordinarily protect it, is seriously ill and can't carry out her task.  Her chief minister, Cairon (Moses Gunn), summons the boy-warrior Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), one of ""the Plains people who hunt the purple buffalo,"" to seek out the origin of the threat, and as Bastian follows his adventures--helped by a dog-headed Luck Dragon named Falkor and a pair of gnomes--through the book, he discovers that he seems to be in some way connected to Fantasia.  In the end, when even Atreyu fails, it's up to Bastian to recreate the shattered land.  The special effects are a bit cheesy--mostly blue-screen and animatronics--but the link between Bastian and Fantasia makes the story both unique and interesting.In the second installment of the series, the cast changes completely, probably owing to the fact that five years elapsed between the movies and all the kids had grown out of their parts: Bastian is now played by Jonathan Brandis, his father by John Wesley Shipp, Atreyu by Kenny Morrison, and the Empress by Alexandra Johnes.  This time Bastian, summoned in a dream by the Empress, travels physically to Fantasia, where instead of an insidious devouring nothingness, the threat comes now from within--the very rocks of Fantasia are losing their inwardness.  Teaming up with Atreyu, he learns that the sorceress Xayide (Clarissa Burt), who plots to displace the Empress and remake Fantasia to her own image, is behind the trouble.  But if she succeeds, ""the children of my world will have no stories,"" so the boys must defeat her--and soon.  This time Bastian himself is threatened not only with physical danger but with the loss of his memories of his own past in the human world: the Ohrin, the Ourobouros-like magical medallion lent him by the Empress, has been overlooked by one of Xayide's enchantments, and every time he makes a wish he loses another memory.  Falkor returns as a loyal helper to the boys, and although, once again, the effects aren't really very good, there's a decent level of suspense (will Bastian realize he's being used?  Will Atreyu be able to save his friend?) to keep things going.  Many kids of the post-Star Wars generation may not think very much of these movies, but younger ones who aren't ready for the flash-bang violence of so much modern fantasy may find them just suitable.",4,Saving the land of stories,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,2987,"['Bastian', 'Balthasar', 'Bux', 'Barret', 'Oliver', 'quiet', 'bookish', 'boy', 'just', 'beginning', 'middle', 'school', 'where', 'favorite', 'target', 'bullies', 'trying', 'cope', 'recent', 'death', 'mother', 'insistence', 'father', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'get', 'give', 'attention', 'real', 'life', 'When', 'unexpectedly', 'copy', 'ornately', 'bound', 'book', 'being', 'immersed', 'reading', ""n't"", 'just', 'expression', 'book', 'details', 'perils', 'land', 'Fantasia', 'threatened', 'consuming', 'nothingness', 'even', 'Childlike', 'Empress', 'Tami', 'Stronach', 'title', 'physical', 'appearance', 'magical', 'disguise', 'powers', 'ordinarily', 'protect', 'seriously', 'ill', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'out', 'task', 'chief', 'minister', 'Cairon', 'Moses', 'Gunn', 'boy-warrior', 'Atreyu', 'Noah', 'Hathaway', 'one', 'Plains', 'people', 'who', 'hunt', 'purple', 'buffalo', 'seek', 'out', 'origin', 'threat', 'Bastian', 'adventures', 'helped', 'dog-headed', 'Luck', 'Dragon', 'named', 'Falkor', 'pair', 'gnomes', 'book', 'be', 'way', 'connected', 'Fantasia', 'end', 'when', 'even', 'Atreyu', 'up', 'Bastian', 'recreate', 'shattered', 'land', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'mostly', 'blue-screen', 'animatronics', 'link', 'Bastian', 'Fantasia', 'story', 'unique', 'second', 'installment', 'series', 'cast', 'changes', 'completely', 'probably', 'owing', 'fact', 'five', 'years', 'elapsed', 'movies', 'kids', 'had', 'grown', 'parts', 'Bastian', 'now', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Brandis', 'father', 'John', 'Wesley', 'Shipp', 'Atreyu', 'Kenny', 'Morrison', 'Empress', 'Alexandra', 'Johnes', 'time', 'Bastian', 'summoned', 'dream', 'Empress', 'physically', 'Fantasia', 'where', 'instead', 'insidious', 'devouring', 'nothingness', 'threat', 'now', 'very', 'rocks', 'Fantasia', 'are', 'losing', 'inwardness', 'Teaming', 'up', 'Atreyu', 'sorceress', 'Xayide', 'Clarissa', 'Burt', 'who', 'plots', 'displace', 'Empress', 'remake', 'Fantasia', 'own', 'image', 'trouble', 'children', 'world', 'will', 'have', 'stories', 'boys', 'must', 'defeat', 'soon', 'time', 'Bastian', 'threatened', 'not', 'only', 'physical', 'danger', 'loss', 'memories', 'own', 'past', 'human', 'world', 'Ohrin', 'Ourobouros-like', 'magical', 'medallion', 'lent', 'Empress', 'been', 'overlooked', 'one', 'Xayide', 'enchantments', 'time', 'wish', 'memory', 'Falkor', 'loyal', 'helper', 'boys', 'once', 'again', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'good', 'decent', 'level', 'suspense', 'will', 'Bastian', 'realize', 'being', 'used', 'Will', 'Atreyu', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'friend', 'keep', 'things', 'going', 'Many', 'kids', 'post-Star', 'Wars', 'generation', 'may', 'not', 'think', 'very', 'much', 'movies', 'younger', 'ones', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'ready', 'flash-bang', 'violence', 'so', 'much', 'modern', 'fantasy', 'may', 'find', 'just', 'suitable']",N/A

Bastian's mother is dead and both he and his father are still trying to cope with the loss.  However, Bastian's father is a realist and thinks that Bastian spends too much time drawing pictures, reading books, and daydreaming.  He wants his son to buckle down and get serious about school and life.  He means well, but his advice doesn't do much to improve Bastian's condition.  Eventually Bastian ends up meeting a strange bookstore owner that leaves a book, ""The Neverending Story"", where Bastian is able to borrow it. Bastian sneaks away to the attic of his school, locks himself in, and begins reading.  The story is a fascinating tale about a place called Fantasia, a seeming endless world filled with countless creatures of every shape and size.  Fantasia is under attack by an unknown force known as the Nothing that destroys everything in its path.  The Childlike Empress (Tami Stronach) selects the mighty warrior from the plains people, Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) to go on a journey and find the one person who can save Fantasia from total annihilation.  Atreyu sets forth on a long, difficult journey, traveling all over Fantasia, but no one seems capable of helping him.  As Atreyu journeys, Bastian secretly accompanies him and shares in all of his adventures.  The book reads like none other that Bastian has ever read and it seems that he is a part of the story.  As the Nothing grows stronger, Bastian has to decide if he will give into reality of what he sees around him or allow his imagination take control.In THE NEVERENDING STORY II Bastian (Jonathan Brandis) is once again transported to Fantasia.  Bastian is no longer threatened by bullies, but is instead taunted by his classmates when he joins the dive team.  His father (John Wesley Shipp) misguidedly prods Bastian into overcoming his fears.  Frustrated, Bastian returns to Mr. Koreander's bookstore and though he is warned that the story in ""The Neverending Story"" doesn't remain the same, Bastian borrows the book and ends up returning to Fantasia.  Upon entering Fantasia, Bastian finds that he has the symbol of the childlike Empress, Auryn, around his neck.  He is informed by the giant bird Nimbly (Martin Umbach) that anytime he makes a wish, the power in Auryn will make the wish come true.  However, there is a dark secret to Auryn.  To save Fantasia, Bastian must find out Auryn's secret, defeat the evil witch Xayide, and stop the Emptiness from consuming Fantasia.Of the two movies, THE NEVERENDING STORY is a far superior film that its sequel.The DVD doesn't offer many extras.  On THE NEVERENDING STORY side of the disc, there are some notes about the book and characters and a trailer for the film.
