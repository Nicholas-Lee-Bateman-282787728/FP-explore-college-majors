1406896,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B004GEH13A,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[5, 5]","Lifetime movies are hit-or-miss affairs, typically high on drama but lacking in the plot/acting department. This movie is an exception to that. The story involves a group of four teenage girls, one of which is the outsider in the group. The three other girls decide that they should play a prank on her, which predictably goes terribly wrong, as teenage pranks typically do.This prank, however, results in murder, and of course the three girls try to pin it on the other one. This sounds like a story that has been re-used over and over again. and it is, but the movie is fun and entertaining to watch. Cynthia Gibb gives a strong performance as a mother in a tight spot trying to prove that her daughter is not a murderer.This DVD will not play on standard US DVD players, as it is region 2. However, the movie typically runs on LMN and Lifetime frequently. Recommended if you are a fan of movies like ""Sorority Row"" and ""The Woods.""",4,Suspensful Teen Drama,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,934,"['Lifetime', 'movies', 'are', 'hit-or-miss', 'affairs', 'typically', 'high', 'drama', 'lacking', 'plot/acting', 'department', 'movie', 'exception', 'story', 'group', 'four', 'teenage', 'girls', 'one', 'outsider', 'group', 'three', 'other', 'girls', 'decide', 'should', 'play', 'prank', 'predictably', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'teenage', 'pranks', 'typically', 'do.This', 'prank', 'however', 'results', 'murder', 'course', 'three', 'girls', 'try', 'pin', 'other', 'one', 'story', 'been', 're-used', 'over', 'again', 'movie', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'Cynthia', 'Gibb', 'strong', 'performance', 'mother', 'tight', 'spot', 'trying', 'prove', 'daughter', 'not', 'murderer.This', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'standard', 'US', 'DVD', 'players', 'region', '2', 'However', 'movie', 'typically', 'LMN', 'Lifetime', 'frequently', 'Recommended', 'are', 'fan', 'movies', 'Sorority', 'Row', 'Woods']",N/A

1406900,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004GEH13A,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[0, 0]","Premiering as a Lifetime network original movie, ""Accused at 17"" has all the trappings that you would expect from such a distinction.  I can be critical of the Lifetime brand with movies that tend to veer between sensationalized instances based on real life and thrillers of fantastical proportions.  ""Accused at 17"" is a rare example of these genres being mashed (although, for the record, this isn't based on a true story).  Despite a welcome performance by Cynthia Gibb, this movie ends up not being particularly successful in either realm.  Too earnest to be an effective thriller and too silly to be a heartfelt examination of mother love, the movie straddles an uneasy balance.  Ultimately, it is watchable and reasonably entertaining without being particularly noteworthy or distinguished.The premise is intriguing enough and shows promise.  When a popular student messes with the boyfriend of a fellow classmate, the betrayed girl is none too happy.  Her friends concoct a scheme to exact revenge, but things go terribly awry when the victim turns up dead.  Gibb's daughter, the girl who was cheated on, doesn't know what is going on despite participating in the event.  And soon all signs and evidence start to implicate her in the death.  Will anyone believe in her innocence?  You bet!  Mother Gibb strikes to protect her cub and launches a one-woman investigation into the truth.  This exploration of the mother/daughter bond is reasonably successful and provides some of the film's most grounded moments.  Had the film focused on this element, we might have gotten a fairly believable and touching story of sacrifice and belief.However, the story paints certain performances as snarling and evil cartoon villains.  As Gibb single handedly pursues the truth, she discovers more than she bargained for and the movie ramps up into completely preposterous territory.  I won't go into specific details, but the final confrontation might be one of the silliest scenes that I've seen in quite some time filled with two dimensional characters, overwrought but ineffective dramatics, and painfully inauthentic dialogue.  Gibb gives it a valiant try (and it's good to see her again), but the movie needed to decide which route it wanted to take--and then fully commit to that path.  Easy to watch, easy to forget.  If you like Lifetime thrillers, this isn't the worst--but it had the potential to stand out.
