The electronic storybook called Dorothy's Spots and two episodes of Lights, Camera, Action, Wiggles!  It was so cute when The Wiggles called Santa Great Big Man in Red, and how fantastic Anthony looked in his elf costume within the song, ""Wags, Stop Your Barking, It's Almost Christmas Day"".  That's one my favorite new songs-so is ""Captain Feathersword's Christmas Dance.",5,The 3rd Sequel to Wiggly Christmas & Yule Be Wiggling,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,465,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Santa', 'Rockin', 'was', 'one', 'wiggly', 'got', 'engrossed', 'electronic', 'storybook', 'called', 'Dorothy', 'Spots', 'two', 'episodes', 'Lights', 'Camera', 'Action', 'was', 'so', 'cute', 'when', 'Wiggles', 'called', 'Santa', 'Great', 'Big', 'Man', 'Red', 'how', 'fantastic', 'Anthony', 'looked', 'elf', 'costume', 'song', 'Wags', 'Stop', 'Your', 'Barking', 'Almost', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'one', 'favorite', 'new', 'songs-so', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'Christmas', 'Dance']",N/A

I love the guy singing in the white suit - I can't figure out his name, but his voice, oh my golly!  He's just wonderful!  Classically trained too, you can definitely tell that and it's worth the cost of the dvd just for that song alone.  For those of you wishing to help your children realize the real meaning of Christmas, the many carols and original songs definitely promote the first Christmas.  That is certainly a great plus in our house and these songs were so well done.  The one done by Sam Moran, This Child is Born Again is just awesome.  We get to see Anthony's new baby girl and his beautiful wife in the montage of video clips of mothers and their babies in that song, which is so precious and actually, makes you cry to watch it.  Barry Williams is a funny suprise guest and those of us who watched the Brady Bunch will get a real kick out of seeing him.  In the end credits, they even do the Brady Bunch squares with all the Wiggles and friends.  Pretty funny!  The out takes are pretty funny as usual too.  Plus, they included a story involving Dorothy and her spots as an extra on the DVD version, along with two episodes of ""Lights, Camera Action"" which was a nice surprise.  This DVD is not like the two previous holiday ones - it's more along the lines of ""Top of the Tots.""  It's pretty neat though and really enjoyable by parents as well.Now for the toddler appeal.  I put this in and well, I had a couch potato instantly.  Glued to the screen throughout the entire presentation.  To say that he loved it is putting it mildly.  The only thing he wasn't thrilled about was the spanish section of Silent Night, which I didn't like too much either.  They keep using those guys and well, they're not very good in my opinion.  But that being the worst part of the video, and it's really not that bad, this is just a great find and a great gift for the Wiggles lover in your life but also, don't forget about those baby shower gifts.  These guys are doing a lot of teaching and we've learned a bunch from them in our house.  You can't always say that about other children's programs.  I'm very glad that they're preschool teachers by trade too - that certainly comes through.  Thanks a bunch Wiggles!",5,Great holiday video!,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",2004,2356,"['bought', 'video', 'little', 'one', 'first', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'season', 'something', 'do', 'Thanksgiving', 'just', 'great', 'love', 'guy', 'singing', 'white', 'suit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'name', 'voice', 'oh', 'golly', 'just', 'wonderful', 'Classically', 'trained', 'too', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'cost', 'dvd', 'just', 'song', 'alone', 'wishing', 'help', 'children', 'realize', 'real', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'many', 'carols', 'original', 'songs', 'definitely', 'promote', 'first', 'Christmas', 'certainly', 'great', 'plus', 'house', 'songs', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'done', 'Sam', 'Moran', 'Child', 'Born', 'Again', 'just', 'awesome', 'get', 'see', 'Anthony', 'new', 'baby', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'montage', 'video', 'clips', 'mothers', 'babies', 'song', 'so', 'precious', 'actually', 'cry', 'watch', 'Barry', 'Williams', 'funny', 'suprise', 'guest', 'who', 'watched', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'will', 'get', 'real', 'kick', 'seeing', 'end', 'credits', 'even', 'do', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Wiggles', 'friends', 'Pretty', 'funny', 'out', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'usual', 'too', 'included', 'story', 'involving', 'Dorothy', 'spots', 'extra', 'DVD', 'version', 'two', 'episodes', 'Lights', 'Camera', 'Action', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'DVD', 'not', 'two', 'previous', 'holiday', 'ones', 'more', 'lines', 'Top', 'Tots', 'pretty', 'neat', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'parents', 'well.Now', 'toddler', 'appeal', 'put', 'well', 'had', 'couch', 'potato', 'instantly', 'Glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'presentation', 'say', 'loved', 'putting', 'mildly', 'only', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'about', 'was', 'spanish', 'section', 'Silent', 'Night', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'keep', 'using', 'guys', 'well', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'good', 'opinion', 'being', 'worst', 'part', 'video', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'great', 'find', 'great', 'gift', 'Wiggles', 'lover', 'life', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'baby', 'shower', 'gifts', 'guys', 'are', 'doing', 'lot', 'teaching', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'bunch', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'say', 'about', 'other', 'children', 'programs', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', ""'re"", 'preschool', 'teachers', 'trade', 'too', 'certainly', 'Thanks', 'bunch', 'Wiggles']",N/A
