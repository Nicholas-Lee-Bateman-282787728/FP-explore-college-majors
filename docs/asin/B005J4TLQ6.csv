1463054,A3QSM5XHPL1T6Y,B005J4TLQ6,"Greg ""Saganite""","[6, 8]","Watching Salvation Boulevard, I realized that satire was never going to be the funniest form of comedy.  Ever since Swift pennedA Modest Proposal, whatever laughs there are in these dark artistic works have been nervous and mixed with horror and revulsion.So it is with ""Salvation Boulevard,"" not the darkest comedy I've ever seen, but plenty dark, disturbing, and sometimes violent.  But in the service of deflating piety, hypocrisy, and egomania, the atmosphere feels entirely appropriate.The movie starts with a debate between Pastor Dan Day (Pierce Brosnan) and atheist Peter Blaylock (Ed Harris).  Having watched similar debates between various clerics and religious apologists and the likes Richard Dawkins and the late, great Christopher Hitchens, the script and direction gets the tone mostly right and mines the hubris and false confidence (of both parties) for laughs.  The scene also serves to introduce us to most of the key characters, including Carl Vanderveer (Greg Kinnear), a former Deadhead who has had a radical conversion to an evangelical form of Christianity and married a seemingly holy woman, who has a saner-than-she-should be teen daughter.Not nearly as broad as ""Saved!""--a satire in a similar vein--""Boulevard"" deals with Pastor Dan accidentally shooting atheist Blaylock (which rather than killing him, puts him in a coma) and trying to pin the shooting on Carl.  Because all of this happens within the opening minutes of the movie, no spoiler alert was called for, but from that point on the surprises begin to stack up and to say more would be to rob the reader of those moments of shock and humor.  Suffice to say that contemporary Christianity as practiced by celebrity mega-church leadership and attendees comes in for some well-deserved parody.To any person of faith tempted to cry foul and offer ""Boulevard"" as just one more example of Christianity coming under unfair fire in America, I would say that not a week goes by that a new Christian movie doesn't show up in Red Box rental kiosks or the local megaplexes, so your privilege is still intact; and if you don't like being made fun of, start acting to drive the clowns and con artists from your midst.  Is making fun of Christian hypocrisy like shooting fish in a barrel?  Hell yes, and it's because sincere, honest people of faith don't do all they can to shut up people like Jack Van Impe, the idiots on Trinity Broadcasting, and the various charlatans and faith healers who ply their craft over the airwaves and in opulent cathedrals.  If you were to criticize these sickening, slick shysters as thoroughly as they deserve, there might be less ammunition left for those of us who don't share your faith.As it stands, there is a need for movies like ""Salvation Boulevard,"" to remind us--votaries and infidels alike--that the human condition is more complex and absurd than any single worldview can accommodate, and among the worst ideas for addressing that condition is religion.",5,Satirical broad strokes get at something important.,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,2972,"['Watching', 'Salvation', 'Boulevard', 'realized', 'satire', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'funniest', 'form', 'comedy', 'Ever', 'Swift', 'pennedA', 'Modest', 'Proposal', 'are', 'dark', 'artistic', 'works', 'have', 'been', 'nervous', 'mixed', 'horror', 'revulsion.So', 'Salvation', 'Boulevard', 'not', 'darkest', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'plenty', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'service', 'deflating', 'piety', 'hypocrisy', 'egomania', 'atmosphere', 'entirely', 'appropriate.The', 'movie', 'debate', 'Pastor', 'Dan', 'Day', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'atheist', 'Peter', 'Blaylock', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Having', 'watched', 'similar', 'debates', 'various', 'clerics', 'religious', 'apologists', 'likes', 'Richard', 'Dawkins', 'late', 'great', 'Christopher', 'Hitchens', 'script', 'direction', 'tone', 'mostly', 'right', 'hubris', 'false', 'confidence', 'parties', 'laughs', 'scene', 'also', 'introduce', 'most', 'key', 'characters', 'including', 'Carl', 'Vanderveer', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'former', 'Deadhead', 'who', 'had', 'radical', 'conversion', 'evangelical', 'form', 'Christianity', 'married', 'seemingly', 'holy', 'woman', 'who', 'saner-than-she-should', 'be', 'teen', 'daughter.Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'broad', 'Saved', 'satire', 'similar', 'vein', 'Boulevard', 'deals', 'Pastor', 'Dan', 'accidentally', 'shooting', 'atheist', 'Blaylock', 'rather', 'killing', 'coma', 'trying', 'pin', 'shooting', 'Carl', 'opening', 'minutes', 'movie', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'was', 'called', 'point', 'surprises', 'begin', 'stack', 'up', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'rob', 'reader', 'moments', 'shock', 'humor', 'Suffice', 'say', 'contemporary', 'Christianity', 'practiced', 'celebrity', 'mega-church', 'leadership', 'attendees', 'well-deserved', 'parody.To', 'person', 'faith', 'tempted', 'cry', 'foul', 'offer', 'Boulevard', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'example', 'Christianity', 'coming', 'unfair', 'fire', 'America', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'week', 'new', 'Christian', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'Red', 'Box', 'rental', 'kiosks', 'local', 'megaplexes', 'privilege', 'still', 'intact', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'made', 'fun', 'start', 'acting', 'drive', 'clowns', 'con', 'artists', 'midst', 'making', 'fun', 'Christian', 'hypocrisy', 'shooting', 'fish', 'barrel', 'Hell', 'yes', 'sincere', 'honest', 'people', 'faith', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'can', 'shut', 'up', 'people', 'Jack', 'Van', 'Impe', 'idiots', 'Trinity', 'Broadcasting', 'various', 'charlatans', 'faith', 'healers', 'who', 'ply', 'craft', 'airwaves', 'opulent', 'cathedrals', 'were', 'criticize', 'sickening', 'slick', 'shysters', 'as', 'thoroughly', 'deserve', 'might', 'be', 'less', 'ammunition', 'left', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'faith.As', 'need', 'movies', 'Salvation', 'Boulevard', 'remind', 'votaries', 'infidels', 'alike', 'human', 'condition', 'more', 'complex', 'absurd', 'single', 'worldview', 'can', 'accommodate', 'worst', 'ideas', 'addressing', 'condition', 'religion']",Salvation Boulevard

Swanson,"[3, 4]","4.5 starsI found this unexpectedly hilarious, but should have known Gaffigan wouldn't pick a dog; he's quietly funny here and no doubt headed for a hot pocket acting career. Brosnan is perfect, as are Harris and Connelly and pretty much everyone, and Kinnear brings it all together with a typically crisp nice-guy-done-wrong performance, playing straight man so everyone else can get the laughs.And there are plenty, due to a tight script that moves along briskly while dropping all sorts of uncomfortable truth bombs along the way. But what really sells this flick is the excellent cinematography. There are many scenes with unique and unexpected lighting, often keeping one side of a face in darkness, which works symbolically and graphically, giving the film a somewhat noir feel at times in contrast to the many brightly lit outdoor shots.This sort of duality is constant, and director Ratliff clearly knew precisely what he was going for, and got it. He assembled a wonderful cast and coaxed sharp performances from everybody---and how did he get Hinds, a truly great classical actor? The guy can sure be funny too, and I'd love to see more of him in these bit parts. His face has so much character. Ditto the unfairly forgotten Tomei, who needs to be in plenty more movies; she brings such a good feel to her roles, likable in the nicest way, like Kinnear. He can go from near-slapstick to real feeling in a blink, and that helps Salvation Boulevard work as well as it does.Ratliff really nailed this one, with so many details spot on. He even picked a couple of exceptional and apropos GD live jams for the soundtrack, instead of the usual studio fare. And the comparison of the holy life vs the Jerry life has some moments of real hilarity to boot; I smell a tourhead in here somewhere.All in all, one of the best cinematic surprises I've had in many a moon, and bound to be a cult classic as the years truck on by.",5,Very funny; Kinnear nails it,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,1923,"['4.5', 'starsI', 'found', 'unexpectedly', 'hilarious', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'Gaffigan', 'would', ""n't"", 'pick', 'dog', 'quietly', 'funny', 'here', 'doubt', 'headed', 'hot', 'pocket', 'acting', 'career', 'Brosnan', 'perfect', 'are', 'Harris', 'Connelly', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'Kinnear', 'together', 'typically', 'crisp', 'nice-guy-done-wrong', 'performance', 'playing', 'straight', 'man', 'everyone', 'else', 'can', 'get', 'laughs.And', 'are', 'plenty', 'due', 'tight', 'script', 'along', 'briskly', 'dropping', 'sorts', 'uncomfortable', 'truth', 'bombs', 'way', 'what', 'really', 'flick', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'unique', 'unexpected', 'lighting', 'often', 'keeping', 'one', 'side', 'face', 'darkness', 'symbolically', 'graphically', 'giving', 'film', 'somewhat', 'noir', 'feel', 'times', 'contrast', 'many', 'brightly', 'lit', 'shots.This', 'sort', 'duality', 'constant', 'director', 'Ratliff', 'clearly', 'knew', 'precisely', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'got', 'assembled', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'coaxed', 'sharp', 'performances', 'everybody', '-and', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'Hinds', 'truly', 'great', 'classical', 'actor', 'guy', 'can', 'sure', 'be', 'funny', 'too', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'more', 'bit', 'parts', 'face', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'Ditto', 'unfairly', 'forgotten', 'Tomei', 'who', 'be', 'plenty', 'more', 'movies', 'good', 'feel', 'roles', 'likable', 'nicest', 'way', 'Kinnear', 'can', 'go', 'near-slapstick', 'real', 'feeling', 'blink', 'Salvation', 'Boulevard', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'nailed', 'one', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'spot', 'even', 'picked', 'couple', 'exceptional', 'apropos', 'GD', 'live', 'jams', 'soundtrack', 'instead', 'usual', 'studio', 'fare', 'comparison', 'holy', 'life', 'Jerry', 'life', 'moments', 'real', 'hilarity', 'boot', 'smell', 'tourhead', 'here', 'somewhere.All', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'surprises', ""'ve"", 'had', 'many', 'moon', 'bound', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'years', 'truck']",Salvation Boulevard

The book was better, as usual, since there was much more to it, but the director succeeds in bringing its dark humor to the screen.The production quality is first-rate, with fine acting by a stellar cast, a devastatingly wry script full of nice twists & great lines, even a perfectly suited soundtrack.Salvation Boulevard is not your typical inane comedy. The humor is subtle & dry, with nuanced metaphors & lots of double-entendres. There are achingly funny scenes & laugh-out-loud moments, but it's not for the thin-skinned or easily-offended. Although it isn't really about religion, it is about hypocrisy, self-deception & the pitfalls of credulity. Ignore the bad reviews, some of which were no doubt by viewers who simply didn't understand it.Dark comedies are hard to pull off, which is why you don't see more of them.
