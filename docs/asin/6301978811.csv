The latest version of man(who was seen in teaser) is exceptionally well done and you'd think he really was a man from the future.  This is exactally what I thought they would look like and sound like.  However, in reality owr craniums will probably shrienk, not grow as to owr 3 point drop per generation in IQ.My favorite part was actually the first future man of 20,000 years beyond owr selves.  He looks somewhat like us and somewhat like the telekinetic dome heads of 1 million years and beyond.  He is the missing link, so to speak between us and the telekinetic beings.

It beautifully illustrates the enormous range and appeal of OL.  The makeup effects (by John Chambers, best known for &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;) are spectacular, both in technical execution and design artistry, while their presentation in lighting and photography does them total justice.  The story and characters are flawlessly conceived, and put the show on par dramatically with Shakespeare.  I especially enjoy the sisters, with their contrasting personalities, and the harassment of the one by a village lunk.  The performances are deadly accurate, the direction is taut, and the story builds like an unstoppable steamroller, leading to a gripping, delicately cathartic end. If you have only heard about the original Outer Limits, and wondered what the fuss was over, you could do worse than to check out this masterpiece of science fiction--it has few equals.

288515,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,6301978811,Bruce Rux,"[3, 3]","One of the best-remembered episodes, with some of the series' most shuddery moments.  The story is reminiscent of The Man With the Power (see OL #4), but better realized, and with the lead character not anxious to lose his terrifying power over others, but rather to expand it.David McCallum, who never turns in a poor performance, practically walks away with this one, though he is nicely matched by Edward Mulhare as the Professor Higgins (he played the role on Broadway, when Rex Harrison was on vacation) who transforms him into the Six Million Year Evolved Man.  Jill Haworth is touching as McCallum's ultimate savior, and Janos Prohaska even gets to do his famous man-in-a-monkey-suit routine to good effect.What stands out in this episode are the various makeups/masks of McCallum's transformations, first to a man evolved ten thousand years into the future, then a million, then six million.  His first appearances, out of the shadows (the cinematography in this episode is incomparably good), are especially chilling.  The ending will leave you with the shivers.This one is marked down a star for three reasons:  one, the episode has unnecessary scenes for padding (it actually doesn't suffer in syndicated cuts); two, the actors in the padded scenes have accents that ruin the illusion of being in Wales (especially against the three principals, who are English and Welsh); and three, the direction is often a little arch and melodramatic, telegraphing too much.But it is one of OL's best, without question, and highly recommended.",4,My Fair Laddy,1017100800,"03 26, 2002",2002,1541,"['One', 'best-remembered', 'episodes', 'series', 'most', 'shuddery', 'moments', 'story', 'reminiscent', 'Man', 'Power', 'see', 'OL', '4', 'better', 'realized', 'lead', 'character', 'not', 'anxious', 'lose', 'terrifying', 'power', 'others', 'rather', 'expand', 'it.David', 'McCallum', 'who', 'never', 'poor', 'performance', 'practically', 'away', 'one', 'nicely', 'matched', 'Edward', 'Mulhare', 'Professor', 'Higgins', 'played', 'role', 'Broadway', 'when', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'was', 'vacation', 'who', 'Six', 'Million', 'Year', 'Evolved', 'Man', 'Jill', 'Haworth', 'touching', 'McCallum', 'ultimate', 'savior', 'Janos', 'Prohaska', 'even', 'do', 'famous', 'man-in-a-monkey-suit', 'routine', 'good', 'effect.What', 'out', 'episode', 'are', 'various', 'makeups/masks', 'McCallum', 'transformations', 'first', 'man', 'evolved', 'ten', 'thousand', 'years', 'future', 'then', 'million', 'then', 'six', 'million', 'first', 'appearances', 'shadows', 'cinematography', 'episode', 'incomparably', 'good', 'are', 'especially', 'chilling', 'ending', 'will', 'leave', 'shivers.This', 'one', 'marked', 'down', 'star', 'three', 'reasons', 'one', 'episode', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'padding', 'actually', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'syndicated', 'cuts', 'two', 'actors', 'padded', 'scenes', 'have', 'accents', 'ruin', 'illusion', 'being', 'Wales', 'especially', 'three', 'principals', 'who', 'are', 'English', 'Welsh', 'three', 'direction', 'often', 'little', 'arch', 'melodramatic', 'telegraphing', 'too', 'much.But', 'one', 'OL', 'best', 'question', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

A brilliant scientist, fortunately not of the mad variety, has found a way to accelerate the path of evolution. By subjecting a specimen to certain wavelengths, he can change them into the form that they would have if they were born thousands or millions of years in the past or in the future.The professor lives in a small village in England where the primary industry is coal mining. A young woman of limited intelligence delivers fresh bread to him and notes how a primate that the professor has is capable of doing many things. She asks if she could be made more intelligent and after he samples her blood, tells her no. She has a male friend who mines coal but is disenchanted and wants more. He is very intelligent and understands that he could do much more. He volunteers and is turned into an advanced human with a larger brain, pointed ears and a sixth finger on each hand.He has many powers and as time goes on, he continues to gain in cranial capacity and capability. He learns quickly, but as he learns he grows to despise the rest of humanity. After deciding that the village must be destroyed, he sets out to do so. As he is engaged in a confrontation with two police officers, he realizes what he is doing and goes back to the lab. His goal is to be accelerated so far into the future that his existence will become pure thought. However, his lady friend sets the machine back so that he is returned to normal. They fall into each other's arms and it is over. The presumption is that he will go back to the mines and they live ""happily ever after.""David McCallum is appropriate as the brooding advanced man and Edward Mulhare is superb at the scientist who is carrying out the experiments and is genuinely concerned about the consequences. So many people are in the position of living in a dead end existence, they know that they could do better but have little hope of actually doing it. If the professor had been played as a fanatic, or if the villagers had destroyed the McCallum character a la Frankenstein, the episode would have been awful. Not the best episode, but by avoiding many of the obvious pitfalls, I give it four stars, giving it the benefit of my thinking back to the early sixties when it was made.",4,"Avoiding the mad part of the scientist, it is worth watching",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2364,"['plot', 'show', 'been', 'used', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'tedious', 'watch', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'original', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'fortunately', 'not', 'mad', 'variety', 'found', 'way', 'accelerate', 'path', 'evolution', 'subjecting', 'specimen', 'certain', 'wavelengths', 'can', 'change', 'form', 'would', 'have', 'were', 'born', 'thousands', 'millions', 'years', 'past', 'future.The', 'professor', 'small', 'village', 'England', 'where', 'primary', 'industry', 'coal', 'mining', 'young', 'woman', 'limited', 'intelligence', 'delivers', 'fresh', 'bread', 'how', 'primate', 'professor', 'capable', 'doing', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'intelligent', 'blood', 'no', 'male', 'friend', 'who', 'coal', 'disenchanted', 'more', 'very', 'intelligent', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'volunteers', 'turned', 'advanced', 'human', 'larger', 'brain', 'pointed', 'ears', 'sixth', 'finger', 'hand.He', 'many', 'powers', 'time', 'gain', 'cranial', 'capacity', 'capability', 'quickly', 'despise', 'rest', 'humanity', 'deciding', 'village', 'must', 'be', 'destroyed', 'out', 'do', 'so', 'engaged', 'confrontation', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'what', 'doing', 'back', 'lab', 'goal', 'be', 'accelerated', 'so', 'far', 'future', 'existence', 'will', 'become', 'pure', 'thought', 'However', 'lady', 'friend', 'machine', 'back', 'so', 'returned', 'normal', 'fall', 'other', 'arms', 'presumption', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'mines', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'David', 'McCallum', 'appropriate', 'brooding', 'advanced', 'man', 'Edward', 'Mulhare', 'superb', 'scientist', 'who', 'carrying', 'out', 'experiments', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'consequences', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'position', 'living', 'dead', 'end', 'existence', 'know', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'have', 'little', 'hope', 'actually', 'doing', 'professor', 'had', 'been', 'played', 'fanatic', 'villagers', 'had', 'destroyed', 'McCallum', 'character', 'la', 'Frankenstein', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'awful', 'Not', 'best', 'episode', 'avoiding', 'many', 'obvious', 'pitfalls', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'giving', 'benefit', 'thinking', 'back', 'early', 'sixties', 'when', 'was', 'made']",N/A

He has already tried it on an ape and the results have proved to be successful, since the ape shows advanced form of intelligence. Enter Cathy Evans (played by Jill Haworth), a simple girl who finds out about Mathers' invention and asks him to try it on her, so that she can become smarter. Unfortunately her blood type is not suitable for the experiment. However, she feels sorry for her friend Gwyllm Griffiths (played by David McCallum), since he is a low-paid uneducated coal mine worker, and asks the professor if he can try the experiments on him. Griffiths accepts the offer, and the Professor starts inducing him with advanced stages of evolution. Griffiths first shows some physical changes such as his head expanding, and wanting to acquire knowledge. But, the more he learns and evolves, the more irritated he becomes towards the current human species, which seem primitive to him. With his advanced powers and knowledge, will anyone be able to stop him?David McCallum stands out in this episode as the eerie advanced form of man. I got shivers when he started smirking at the professor, or when he secretly entered the professor's room at dawn, looking more creepy and advanced. The make up done for him was really good. This episode speaks in many levels, as people who are trying to discover anything in a new field, have to prepare for the consequences.To quote Vic Perrin (The Control Voice): ""An experiment too soon, too swift, and yet, may we not still hope to discover a method by which within one generation, the whole human race could be rendered intelligent, beyond hatred, or revenge or the desire for power?
