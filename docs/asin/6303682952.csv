384718,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303682952,Acute Observer,"[6, 6]","This film is set in 1775 Colonial Massachusetts. A peddler is stopped and searched, the British troops find a musket, powder, balls and confiscate them and the wagon (Gun Control!). The peddler stops at a local tavern to tell about this. The people have noticed an increase in British troop patrols. We then meet a family and see a portrayal of life in the 18th century as similar to today. There is a meeting among the men, they discuss the relative military strengths of the Colonial militia to the 5,000 British troops in Boston. [In fact the militia had a long military experience in colonial warfare, the British were less experienced.]A rider gives the alarm: the British are coming to seize the guns and ammunition stored at Concord where the Continental Congress is meeting. The local militia is summoned by the ringing of the church bell. They are drawn up peaceably on the village green as for their regular drill. They did not block the road or threaten the British. The British order them to disperse. A shot rings out, and the battle ends in a rout. Then the troops reform to march to Concord. [Later the British officers claimed they did not order an attack on the villagers, as if to deny any guilt or responsibility for attacking the militia.] This battle of Lexington was just a minor diversion, but gave time for the Minutemen to prepare at Concord for the shot heard around the world.The British reached Concord, but the guns and ammunition had been moved away. When they began their return to Boston the Minutemen from all the surrounding towns followed and kept up continual fire upon the British. The patriots used their well-tried tactics practiced for generations in forest fighting. After the British retreated to Boston the militia surrounded them and took the hills overlooking the town. The battle of Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill) did not dislodge them. When cannon were brought in the British fleet abandoned Boston. [Mike Wright's book tells how a supply wagon was captured in Lexington.]The end of the French and Indian War led to new and heavy taxes on the 13 colonies and a ban on some prior rights. The Boston Tea Party was followed by heavy sanctions on Boston (yet none betrayed those ""Indians"" who committed an illegal act). The taxation worsened. Committees of Correspondence were formed in the colonies to seek a common front. They prepared to defend themselves. The Congress at Concord became a target for the British. So they marched there to capture the leaders. This film presents a dramatic view of those times, as seen by the people. [I think it is better than Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"".] John Galvin's book explains this best. The Minutemen were those militia men who were best fitted to muster at a minute's notice, a part of the militia. In 1774 the Massachusetts militia were first to practice the democratic election of officers (a practice that lasted until WW I). The morale of the volunteers was part of their effectiveness.",4,Lexington in April 1775,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,2975,"['film', 'set', '1775', 'Colonial', 'Massachusetts', 'A', 'peddler', 'stopped', 'searched', 'British', 'troops', 'find', 'musket', 'powder', 'balls', 'confiscate', 'wagon', 'Gun', 'Control', 'peddler', 'local', 'tavern', 'tell', 'people', 'have', 'noticed', 'increase', 'British', 'troop', 'patrols', 'then', 'meet', 'family', 'see', 'portrayal', 'life', '18th', 'century', 'similar', 'today', 'meeting', 'men', 'discuss', 'relative', 'military', 'strengths', 'Colonial', 'militia', '5,000', 'British', 'troops', 'Boston', '[', 'fact', 'militia', 'had', 'long', 'military', 'experience', 'colonial', 'warfare', 'British', 'were', 'less', 'experienced', ']', 'rider', 'alarm', 'British', 'are', 'coming', 'seize', 'guns', 'ammunition', 'stored', 'Concord', 'where', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'meeting', 'local', 'militia', 'summoned', 'ringing', 'church', 'bell', 'are', 'drawn', 'up', 'peaceably', 'village', 'green', 'regular', 'drill', 'did', 'not', 'block', 'road', 'threaten', 'British', 'British', 'order', 'disperse', 'shot', 'rings', 'out', 'battle', 'rout', 'Then', 'troops', 'reform', 'march', 'Concord', '[', 'Later', 'British', 'officers', 'claimed', 'did', 'not', 'order', 'attack', 'villagers', 'deny', 'guilt', 'responsibility', 'attacking', 'militia', ']', 'battle', 'Lexington', 'was', 'just', 'minor', 'diversion', 'gave', 'time', 'Minutemen', 'prepare', 'Concord', 'shot', 'heard', 'world.The', 'British', 'reached', 'Concord', 'guns', 'ammunition', 'had', 'been', 'moved', 'away', 'When', 'began', 'return', 'Boston', 'Minutemen', 'surrounding', 'towns', 'followed', 'kept', 'up', 'continual', 'fire', 'British', 'patriots', 'used', 'well-tried', 'tactics', 'practiced', 'generations', 'forest', 'fighting', 'British', 'retreated', 'Boston', 'militia', 'surrounded', 'took', 'hills', 'overlooking', 'town', 'battle', 'Bunker', 'Hill', 'Breed', 'Hill', 'did', 'not', 'dislodge', 'When', 'cannon', 'were', 'brought', 'British', 'fleet', 'abandoned', 'Boston', '[', 'Mike', 'Wright', 'book', 'how', 'supply', 'wagon', 'was', 'captured', 'Lexington', ']', 'end', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'led', 'new', 'heavy', 'taxes', '13', 'colonies', 'ban', 'prior', 'rights', 'Boston', 'Tea', 'Party', 'was', 'followed', 'heavy', 'sanctions', 'Boston', 'yet', 'none', 'betrayed', 'Indians', 'who', 'committed', 'illegal', 'act', 'taxation', 'worsened', 'Committees', 'Correspondence', 'were', 'formed', 'colonies', 'seek', 'common', 'front', 'prepared', 'defend', 'Congress', 'Concord', 'became', 'target', 'British', 'marched', 'there', 'capture', 'leaders', 'film', 'dramatic', 'view', 'times', 'seen', 'people', '[', 'think', 'better', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Patriot', ']', 'John', 'Galvin', 'book', 'best', 'Minutemen', 'were', 'militia', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'best', 'fitted', 'muster', 'minute', 'notice', 'part', 'militia', '1774', 'Massachusetts', 'militia', 'were', 'first', 'practice', 'democratic', 'election', 'officers', 'practice', 'lasted', 'WW', 'morale', 'volunteers', 'was', 'part', 'effectiveness']",April Morning VHS

The handling of the story and the actors chosen to play the roles resulted in a powerful presentation that should be watched by every American who loves this country and values its heritage.It was one of those movies that left the viewer wanting more; I was ready to keep going and see what happened next in the lives of those Americans who had so quickly become important to me. The story focuses on the life of a young boy, Adam Cooper, played by Chad Lowe, who is teetering on the edge of manhood and the impact of his suddenly being thrust into the beginning of a war which would influence the rest of his life.The young woman in his life, a neighbor's daughter named Ruth Simmons, is beautifully played by Meredith Salenger with an innocence and purity that is very touching. Ruth's father, played by Robert Urich, brings authority and strength to the role of Joseph Simmons as does Tommy Lee Jones as Moses Cooper, Adam's father.The story illustrates how suddenly and irreversibly life can be changed by events beyond our control; the loving efforts of a devoted father who is trying to help his son develop into a strong, capable human being must all be set aside when events overtake them like a powerful tsunami.Chad Lowe is to be commended for his touching and effective portrayal of Adam Cooper; this is a performance that will not be soon forgotten!One can only hope Hallmark transfers this movie to DVD as soon as possible.",5,Remarkable Account of that Fateful April Morning,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,1536,"['movie', 'outstanding', 'was', 'totally', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'movie', 'time', 'just', 'flew', 'handling', 'story', 'actors', 'chosen', 'play', 'roles', 'resulted', 'powerful', 'presentation', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'American', 'who', 'country', 'heritage.It', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'left', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'was', 'ready', 'keep', 'going', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'lives', 'Americans', 'who', 'had', 'so', 'quickly', 'become', 'important', 'story', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'Adam', 'Cooper', 'played', 'Chad', 'Lowe', 'who', 'teetering', 'edge', 'manhood', 'impact', 'suddenly', 'being', 'thrust', 'beginning', 'war', 'would', 'influence', 'rest', 'life.The', 'young', 'woman', 'life', 'neighbor', 'daughter', 'named', 'Ruth', 'Simmons', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Meredith', 'Salenger', 'innocence', 'purity', 'very', 'touching', 'Ruth', 'father', 'played', 'Robert', 'Urich', 'authority', 'strength', 'role', 'Joseph', 'Simmons', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Moses', 'Cooper', 'Adam', 'father.The', 'story', 'how', 'suddenly', 'irreversibly', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'events', 'control', 'loving', 'efforts', 'devoted', 'father', 'who', 'trying', 'help', 'son', 'develop', 'strong', 'capable', 'human', 'being', 'must', 'be', 'set', 'aside', 'when', 'events', 'overtake', 'powerful', 'tsunami.Chad', 'Lowe', 'be', 'commended', 'touching', 'effective', 'portrayal', 'Adam', 'Cooper', 'performance', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'soon', 'forgotten', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Hallmark', 'transfers', 'movie', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",April Morning VHS

384722,A12P84EGJD4JVX,6303682952,Edith Biggar,"[1, 1]","I collect historical movies.  And, I collect Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.  This is a HHofF movie & yet NOWHERE is there even a hint of that!  Hallmark Hall of Fame movies have certain elements that remain year after year after year.  First, they start with a good story.  In this case, it is the story of the role of the town of Lexington in the beginning of the American Revolution.  Lexington was a small town back them.  When the men of the town gathered on the village green, there were less than 100 gathered.  I don't really know how far it is from Boston proper.  The second thing common to HHofF productions are the absence of violence, blood-shed, swering & sexuality.  If these are necessary for the story, the amount of time the viewer is exposed to these is very brief, or referred to in the dialog.  HHofF often chooses well-known talent for the leading roles, but not always & finally, the movies are made to air in a 2-hour time slot - always a Sunday evening, on CBS, with commercial breaks.  When you choose a HHofF movie, these things you can count on.  You will be told a good story & it will be told in a 2-hour time slot.  In the case of this movie Robert Urick & Tommy Lee Jones are cast as fathers of teenage children in Lexington & Chad Lowe is cast as a teenage boy who becomes a man.  He doesn't do this because he wants to, but because of circumstance.  He sees his father get shot.  He is torn between feelings of guilt over his actions as being those of a coward versus survival tactics, when he runs to shed & stays there.There was a time that Hallmark didn't secure the rights for distribution of their films.  That is not the case today.  I got my copy from a friend/correspondent at Hallmark headquarters in Kansas City.  You teachers out there - write to Hallmark.  You should be able to find the address.  Tell them you are needing a copy for school use.  I'll bet they would send it to you free of charge.  My copy has the words ""free copy, not for asle"" on the label.  There is no fancy artwork on the cover.  But, it's the movie that is important, after all.Bottom line - would I recommend this film to a friend?  Yes!  Definataly yes!  I disagree with the reviewer who wrote this is nothing but a ""soap opera"".  Sure there is a little chemistry/magnetism between the teenagers in this film.  Neither one did anything dishonorable.  They kissed - once & it was very short & sweet.  They were two young people starting the journey to love.",5,A wonderful film that tells the story of one community's part in the beginning of the American Revolution,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,2477,"['collect', 'historical', 'movies', 'collect', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'movies', 'HHofF', 'movie', 'yet', 'NOWHERE', 'there', 'even', 'hint', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'movies', 'have', 'certain', 'elements', 'remain', 'year', 'year', 'year', 'First', 'start', 'good', 'story', 'case', 'story', 'role', 'town', 'Lexington', 'beginning', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Lexington', 'was', 'small', 'town', 'back', 'When', 'men', 'town', 'gathered', 'village', 'green', 'were', 'less', '100', 'gathered', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'far', 'Boston', 'proper', 'second', 'thing', 'common', 'HHofF', 'productions', 'are', 'absence', 'violence', 'blood-shed', 'swering', 'sexuality', 'are', 'necessary', 'story', 'amount', 'time', 'viewer', 'exposed', 'very', 'brief', 'referred', 'dialog', 'HHofF', 'often', 'well-known', 'talent', 'leading', 'roles', 'not', 'always', 'finally', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'air', '2-hour', 'time', 'slot', 'always', 'Sunday', 'evening', 'CBS', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'When', 'choose', 'HHofF', 'movie', 'things', 'can', 'count', 'will', 'be', 'told', 'good', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'told', '2-hour', 'time', 'slot', 'case', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Urick', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'are', 'cast', 'fathers', 'teenage', 'children', 'Lexington', 'Chad', 'Lowe', 'cast', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'man', ""n't"", 'do', 'circumstance', 'father', 'get', 'shot', 'torn', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'actions', 'being', 'coward', 'versus', 'survival', 'tactics', 'when', 'shed', 'stays', 'there.There', 'was', 'time', 'Hallmark', 'did', ""n't"", 'secure', 'rights', 'distribution', 'films', 'not', 'case', 'today', 'got', 'copy', 'friend/correspondent', 'Hallmark', 'headquarters', 'Kansas', 'City', 'teachers', 'write', 'Hallmark', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'address', 'Tell', 'are', 'needing', 'copy', 'school', 'use', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'would', 'send', 'free', 'charge', 'copy', 'words', 'free', 'copy', 'not', 'asle', 'label', 'fancy', 'artwork', 'cover', 'movie', 'important', 'all.Bottom', 'line', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'friend', 'Yes', 'Definataly', 'yes', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'nothing', 'soap', 'opera', 'Sure', 'little', 'chemistry/magnetism', 'teenagers', 'film', 'one', 'did', 'anything', 'dishonorable', 'kissed', 'once', 'was', 'very', 'short', 'sweet', 'were', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'starting', 'journey', 'love']",April Morning VHS

384726,A1WI9BLVSUCLVZ,6303682952,John Elsegood,"[73, 74]","This is simply a gem of a movie based on Howard Fast's excellent 1962 novel,( which I still have), of the first day of hostilities between colonists and Britain.There may have been bigger blockbusters made about the American Revolution (The Patriot, Revolution etc) but to me this under- rated 1988 film is a true classic, capturing the quintessential decency of American colonial village life in Lexington and the developing tensions and conflict on that fateful day of 19th April 1775.I agree with the 2 previous reviewers that this film is a great teaching tool. It shows many things: the tensions and love in family life, particularly between  Moses Cooper ( Tommy Lee Jones) and his son Adam ( Chad Lowe),who is no longer a boy yet not quite a man; romance between Adam and Ruth Simmons ( played by the lovely Susan Blakely); different generations and how they relate to each other; the underlying strong Christian faith of the era,( which still prevails in American life today); the need to perform civic duties; and culture and costumes far removed from our own period etc.""April Morning"" is also effective because it does not glamourise war or demonise the redcoats. In fact both Adam and a young redcoat are both seen, at various stages, to be scared witless by the whiff of 'grapeshot' and of battle. Yet overall, in what is truly a momentous day for Adam personally, (as well as the villagers of Lexington and Concord), we see how the events mature him and this is brilliantly illustrated at the end of the film when he leads his family in prayer for their food and life. This very subtle approach makes it evident that the boy, like colonial America, has gone for ever and has been replaced by a decent man who would,with humility, be worthy of his emerging new leadership role-as would America.As a non-American I conclude by saying that any American who fails to appreciate this film simply lacks a soul and an understanding of the greatness of American history - a fact which was demonstrated on that dusty Lexington-Concord road 226 years ago- and by the makers of this film who have created another very special ""April Morning"".",5,A morning for greatness,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,2145,"['simply', 'gem', 'movie', 'based', 'Howard', 'Fast', 'excellent', '1962', 'novel', 'still', 'have', 'first', 'day', 'hostilities', 'colonists', 'Britain.There', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bigger', 'blockbusters', 'made', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Patriot', 'Revolution', 'etc', 'under-', 'rated', '1988', 'film', 'true', 'classic', 'capturing', 'quintessential', 'decency', 'American', 'colonial', 'village', 'life', 'Lexington', 'developing', 'tensions', 'conflict', 'fateful', 'day', '19th', 'April', '1775.I', 'agree', '2', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'film', 'great', 'teaching', 'tool', 'many', 'things', 'tensions', 'love', 'family', 'life', 'particularly', 'Moses', 'Cooper', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'son', 'Adam', 'Chad', 'Lowe', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'boy', 'yet', 'not', 'quite', 'man', 'romance', 'Adam', 'Ruth', 'Simmons', 'played', 'lovely', 'Susan', 'Blakely', 'different', 'generations', 'how', 'relate', 'other', 'underlying', 'strong', 'Christian', 'faith', 'era', 'still', 'American', 'life', 'today', 'need', 'perform', 'civic', 'duties', 'culture', 'costumes', 'far', 'removed', 'own', 'period', 'etc', 'April', 'Morning', 'also', 'effective', 'not', 'glamourise', 'war', 'demonise', 'redcoats', 'fact', 'Adam', 'young', 'redcoat', 'are', 'seen', 'various', 'stages', 'be', 'scared', 'witless', 'whiff', ""'grapeshot"", 'battle', 'overall', 'what', 'truly', 'momentous', 'day', 'Adam', 'personally', 'as', 'well', 'villagers', 'Lexington', 'Concord', 'see', 'how', 'events', 'mature', 'brilliantly', 'illustrated', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'family', 'prayer', 'food', 'life', 'very', 'subtle', 'approach', 'evident', 'boy', 'colonial', 'America', 'gone', 'ever', 'been', 'replaced', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'humility', 'be', 'worthy', 'emerging', 'new', 'leadership', 'role-as', 'would', 'America.As', 'non-American', 'conclude', 'saying', 'American', 'who', 'appreciate', 'film', 'simply', 'soul', 'understanding', 'greatness', 'American', 'history', 'fact', 'was', 'demonstrated', 'dusty', 'Lexington-Concord', 'road', '226', 'years', 'ago-', 'makers', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'created', 'very', 'special', 'April', 'Morning']",April Morning VHS

Some men in the Colonial Militia had literally fired more rounds in combat in the name of Britain than whole regiments serving under Gage.Also appears to have been done on the cheap.,3,Not very impressed,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,819,"['Saw', 'televison.Lovely', 'scenery', 'Weapons', 'costumes', 'appear', 'authentic', 'Buildings', 'need', 'little', 'work', 'Interior', 'shots', 'good', 'Acting', 'diolog', 'need', 'little', 'work.Overall', 'Soap', 'Opera.Really', 'not', 'very', 'impressed', 'what', 'more', 'work', 'revisionism', 'anything', 'authentic', 'Americans', 'appear', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'looking', 'trouble', 'appear', 'lack', 'semblence', 'militery', 'organization', 'fighting', 'doctrine', 'Historicly', 'are', 'proven', 'far', 'truth', 'third', 'New', 'England', 'male', 'population', 'were', 'veterans', 'previous', 'war', 'had', 'generations', 'combat', 'experience', 'fighting', 'French', 'indians', 'men', 'Colonial', 'Militia', 'had', 'literally', 'fired', 'more', 'rounds', 'combat', 'name', 'Britain', 'whole', 'regiments', 'serving', 'Gage.Also', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'cheap']",April Morning VHS

This is a nice movie.Tommy Lee Jones plays a critical, somewhat cynical father, and Ulrich, the neighbor.  The events of Lexington and Concord do come more alive with the microscope we use to see the high standards the father sets for his son, the frustration of the son, but ultimately how it all no longer matters when the decision of the British commander to march brings it all to a head.Farmers, blacksmiths, shop keepers- they really didn't want the fight.  Most were simply trying to get about their lives.  But events truly escalated, in some ways, beyond their control.  And they fought.  Some died.I'm an old man, an amateur military historian, and a book junkie.  But I have to say, this is a nice story story.

While not a big budget opus like infamous Mel Gibson's THE PATRIOT, this is a much higher quality film overall.  While a bit slow in the beginning with family relationships in Lexington, the film picks up when the British at last appear on the screen!  There is a nice shot of the British columm deploying impressively into line to face Captain Parker's company.  The only problem here is that the British force at this point consisited of six companies of Light Infantry who jogged into town at a fast clip before forming line opposite the militia.  This would have been less impressive to show, plus i guess the available re-enactors could not all be shown in Light Infantry garb.  So we get the usual mix of line companies, Grenadiers and Lights all in group together!  Colorful, but not accurate!The confrontation on Lexington Green is made out to be the fault of a renegade Irishman who fires the mysterious first shot of the Revolution.  This guy seems like an IRA Fenian several generations ahead of his time!  None the less it provides an excuse for how the war began.  The British are shown rather impersonally. The officers dry and slightly arrogant.  It would have been nice to have expounded more on their circumstances in the beginning of the film.  Major Pitcarrin of the Royal Marines for example was universally admired by rebels in Boston for his firm, but fair manner.The battle scenes are none the less exciting and well done.  While the Americans are shown doing their thing from behind cover popping away at the red-coats, the British Lights are also depicted as countering their moves with skirmesher tactics.  On the whole this is well done.  The fatigue the British column starts to suffer is well portrayed.  Again, we should have only Grenadiers and Light Infantry since these were the collected elite companies brought together for this mission.  The tri-corned hat men of the line should only be shown coming up with Lord Percy later on.  Still, this is a relatively minor detail which most not familier with the British army of the 18th century will not notice (or care about).The acting is well done overall, Tommy Lee Jones seems way out of place here in a period movie.  One keeps expecting him to reveal his under cover cop badge or something!  Still, the plot and acting work to create a decent film about the early days of the Revolution.  Deffinitely one of your better American Rev War flicks.  Should be re-issued on DVD someday.",4,Disperse Ye Rebels!
