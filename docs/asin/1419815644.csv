174334,AULVPU9J2YQJL,1419815644,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","My wife and I adore this show.  Bob Larby is a great writer and wrote every single episode in the As Time Goes By series (he also wrote for ""Good Neighbors"").  We started watching the Brit-coms on PBS and eventually fell in love with this show.  I watch an episode almost every night even though I've seen them all ""oodles"" of times.  We bought series 1 & 2 from Amazon and loved it so much that we sprung for the Complete Series and have never regretted a moment.  Charmed, soothed, and a good laugh is what you'll get from every episode.  It's a pity that they couldn't continue the series forever.  When the very last episode aired on TV in England, one news source stated:  ""Tonight, a little piece of England died.""  To some extent, it was actually a bigger hit in America than Britain.  It is a bit ""slower"" and less ""madcap"" than many British comedies but in my opinion more poiniant and endearing.  The Lionel Hardcastle character is written a little overly-grumpy (that British aristocracy syndrome) but that tension is what causes the show to have its dialogue jump back and forth between characters.  All of the actors are great - not to take anything away from their abilities - but the writing is what is key.  The excellence of the casting and acting is what rounds-out the whole thing and makes it ""magic"".  They strum a beautiful chord together.  Jean, played by Judi Dench, is a master of the ""double-takes"".  Like Lucille Ball in the ""I love Lucy"" show who winds up trying to ""white-lie"" her way out of sticky situations, Jean does some of the same - albeit not because she is ditsy the way that Lucy was, but mostly to save face and look the ""proper lady"".I really can't say enough about this show so I'll stop.

174341,AW3VZ5O895LRK,1419815644,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 2]","Many Americans don't realize that Judi Dench was a terrific comedic actress on British tv.  An earlier sitcom she did with her own real life husband was A FINE ROMANCE, which I also loved. This series begins when she discovers her own daughter going out with a much older man.  This man is her own lost love from days of the Korean War.  She was a nurse and he was a solider.  They were in love but lost touch.  He is divorced and returned from years in Kenya and she is widowed with one daughter and the owner of a successful secretarial staffing firm.The rest of the series rests on this romance, between Jean (Dench) and Lionel (Geoffrey Palmer).  It brings a lot of other lovable characters into the mix.  My favorites were Stephen, the dentist brother-in-law of Jean's; Rocky, Lionel's father and Alistair, Lionel's publisher (of his horrible MY LIFE IN KENYA) and future suitor to Jean's daughter Judy.I fell in love with these characters.  Judi Dench is the zany comedian who keeps the comedy centered whereas Lionel is more the straight man.  Jean pokes her nose into everyone's business (just like Lucy Ricardo did) and this is the set up for every other character's subsequent development.  For one example, she initially tells Penny and Stephen (her former in-laws) that Lionel is a psychiatrist in order to impress them (he is not).  So Lionel subsequently gets stuck analyzing Stephen the dentist, one of the high points in all of situation comedy.Jean and Lionel are a very believable couple along with being a humorous one.

I do not need this well priced collection (and it IS well priced).  However I should include a review, as this is one of my favorite britcoms, else I wouldn't be buying it on disc. You get 11 discs (2 of which will be released as 1 set on the same day as this collection). From what I see on the picture of the ""Series 8&9"" 2 bagger just displayed today, the Series 9 will also contain the retrospective ""You Must Remember This"" which previously released separately (between the releases of series 5 and 6) and included 3 other episodes (1 of which was the finale of series 6 which at the time was not on DVD).  Thus making the separate disc of ""You Must Remember This"" nothing but window dressing.  Of course, until the 8&9 set was announced, there was no way to know, so most of us (me included) bought the other disc. Once I got my copy of 8&9, I gave the ""12th disc"" away.  So if you have not gotten any of the series, buy this collection, and you will get it all at a great price.  If you are only missing a few installments, buy the ones you are missing, but skip the separate ""You Must Remember This"" disc, as the episode will be included on the last disc.  After you buy this set, if you haven't already done so, buy ""Reunion"" on the PBS label and OFFICIALLY complete the series.",5,A great buy on a great series for those who waited,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,1470,"['ordering', 'Series', '8', '9', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'day', 'have', 'previously', 'ordered', '6', '7', 'here', 'bought', '1', '5', 'first', 'trip', 'years', 'Ohio', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'well', 'priced', 'collection', 'IS', 'well', 'priced', 'However', 'should', 'include', 'review', 'one', 'favorite', 'britcoms', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'disc', 'get', '11', 'discs', '2', 'will', 'be', 'released', '1', 'set', 'same', 'day', 'collection', 'what', 'see', 'picture', 'Series', '8', '9', '2', 'bagger', 'just', 'displayed', 'today', 'Series', '9', 'will', 'also', 'contain', 'retrospective', 'Must', 'Remember', 'previously', 'released', 'separately', 'releases', 'series', '5', '6', 'included', '3', 'other', 'episodes', '1', 'was', 'finale', 'series', '6', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'DVD', 'Thus', 'making', 'separate', 'disc', 'Must', 'Remember', 'nothing', 'window', 'dressing', 'course', '8', '9', 'set', 'was', 'announced', 'was', 'way', 'know', 'most', 'included', 'bought', 'other', 'disc', 'Once', 'got', 'copy', '8', '9', 'gave', '12th', 'disc', 'away', 'So', 'have', 'not', 'gotten', 'series', 'buy', 'collection', 'will', 'get', 'great', 'price', 'are', 'only', 'missing', 'few', 'installments', 'buy', 'ones', 'are', 'missing', 'skip', 'separate', 'Must', 'Remember', 'disc', 'episode', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'last', 'disc', 'buy', 'set', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'done', 'so', 'buy', 'Reunion', 'PBS', 'label', 'OFFICIALLY', 'complete', 'series']",As Time Goes By: Complete Original Series

It's cozy and funny and silly and very well written, a show that warms your heart.Judi Dench is, as ever, marvelous in her portrayal of Jean, a woman who runs an agency that supplies a typist for Lionel Hardcastle (the also familiar Geoffrey Palmer you might recall from other BBC shows) when he is finishing up a book about his life in Kenya as a coffee-grower.  But, surprise surprise, it turns out that years ago they were an item and lost touch during the war due to a missing letter.  At first, they resist renewing their interest in each other, but that old spark is still there...Other characters include Jean's secretary and her daughter.  Lionel's father and his father's girlfriend are fun and quirky.  Still, the most interesting secondary character is Allister, Lionel's agent--a man who you end up finding fascinating and annoying, sometimes both at the same time.If you are looking for rip-roaring comedy or lots of slapstick, you won't find it here.  This is a gentle comedy, full of all of the normal problems and silliness of regular life.  This is a show about real people and how love can renew itself even after over 30 years apart and after two people have grown older in the meantime.The dialogue in this show is wonderful, but the best is reserved for the interplay between Jean and Lionel (of course) who are played marvelously by Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer.  They are very believable characters and you end up invested in their re-blossoming relationship.Probably not the best BBC comedy show ever (my vote would run towards The Good Life, Butterflies, and To the Manor Born), but very much worth watching.",5,A Very Gentle and Dear Show,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1781,"['Sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'series', 'curling', 'up', 'favorite', 'blanket', 'couch', 'beloved', 'book', 'one', ""'ve"", 'read', 'many', 'times', 'cozy', 'funny', 'silly', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'show', 'heart.Judi', 'Dench', 'ever', 'marvelous', 'portrayal', 'Jean', 'woman', 'who', 'agency', 'typist', 'Lionel', 'Hardcastle', 'also', 'familiar', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'might', 'recall', 'other', 'BBC', 'shows', 'when', 'finishing', 'up', 'book', 'life', 'Kenya', 'coffee-grower', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'out', 'years', 'were', 'item', 'lost', 'touch', 'war', 'due', 'missing', 'letter', 'first', 'resist', 'renewing', 'interest', 'other', 'old', 'spark', 'still', 'Other', 'characters', 'include', 'Jean', 'secretary', 'daughter', 'Lionel', 'father', 'father', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'fun', 'quirky', 'Still', 'most', 'interesting', 'secondary', 'character', 'Allister', 'Lionel', 'agent', 'man', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'fascinating', 'annoying', 'sometimes', 'same', 'time.If', 'are', 'looking', 'rip-roaring', 'comedy', 'lots', 'slapstick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'gentle', 'comedy', 'full', 'normal', 'problems', 'silliness', 'regular', 'life', 'show', 'real', 'people', 'how', 'love', 'can', 'renew', 'even', '30', 'years', 'apart', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'grown', 'older', 'meantime.The', 'dialogue', 'show', 'wonderful', 'best', 'reserved', 'interplay', 'Jean', 'Lionel', 'course', 'who', 'are', 'played', 'marvelously', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'invested', 're-blossoming', 'relationship.Probably', 'not', 'best', 'BBC', 'comedy', 'show', 'ever', 'vote', 'would', 'run', 'Good', 'Life', 'Butterflies', 'Manor', 'Born', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'watching']",As Time Goes By: Complete Original Series

This is a delightful series about a couple once in love, separated by a war, and then finding each other again after 38 years. A second chance risked and devoured.  It deals with the life of older citizens, but a pair who have not given over to the rocking chair. A lively couple. And the younger set they live, work, and love with.Sarcasm is the mode of endearment, and leave the viewer laughing out loud.One negative was discovered after 15 hours of watching, about half-way through the set. I knew both my wife and I had fallen for this series and the characters, and they become like family. They will be missed when the end comes, and they were. In that way, this series is not unlike, ""Monarch of the Glen,"" ""The Grand,"" ""The Darling Buds of May,"" ""The Duchess of Duke Street,"" & ""The Pallisers."" Check out my reviews on those sets as well. Good stuff. One masterful addition to this set is the DVD set's ending with ""You Must Remember This"". In that special episode Lionel is being encouraged to write a book about his life with Jean, at their older age.  The second chance love. Many happy replayed scenes occur as they remember. Viewers get a recap of the series. A nice touch.This is a must-own set for Judi Dench fans, perhaps her finest performance. Geoffrey Palmer as ""Li"" is also top notch, spot-on. A dozen more characters could be listed and praised.Another good comparison is ""Affairs of the Heart"".This is as honestly romantic (not sappy syrupy) as ""Nights of Rodanthe.""

174370,A3QEPSZ62L6BU5,1419815644,Julius Weber,"[0, 1]","This series was conceived by Geoffrey Palmer and Colin Bostock-Smith and written by Bob Larbey. Having Judi Dench as co-star was the clincher for the show to be a success. To steal a phrase, it's a show about nothing, and after the first series, the very minor plot is played out. After that we rely on the characters and these are really very well defined: Geoffrey Palmer as the older man set in his ways, Judi Dench (Jean) as the mother and a superb performance from Philip Bretherton as the wealthy dashing young book publisher. The show went on so long that Moira Brooker as Jean's daughter was aging too much to hold the character together. Jenny Funnell as Jean's secretary was a delight from start to finish. Wonderful walk-ons by Frank Middlemas, Joan Sims and Janet Henfrey with that Plantagenet face.For me, it all proves that the audience prefers not to have a real plot: just create characters and let them lead their everyday lives. I always ask the question when I prepare scripts: what character is totally integral to the show. In other words whom could I not kill off? In the case of 'As Time Goes By', it is the character created for Geoffrey Palmer although he is probably allowed to become much too domesticated with carpet slippers and striped pyjamas.But what counts is success and it is a success, playing almost continuously on PBS (mind you, there is little in the way of real competition).",4,Time has gone by,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1416,"['series', 'was', 'conceived', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'Colin', 'Bostock-Smith', 'written', 'Bob', 'Larbey', 'Having', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'co-star', 'was', 'clincher', 'show', 'be', 'success', 'steal', 'phrase', 'show', 'nothing', 'first', 'series', 'very', 'minor', 'plot', 'played', 'out', 'rely', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'very', 'well', 'defined', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'older', 'man', 'set', 'ways', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Jean', 'mother', 'superb', 'performance', 'Philip', 'Bretherton', 'wealthy', 'dashing', 'young', 'book', 'publisher', 'show', 'went', 'long', 'Moira', 'Brooker', 'Jean', 'daughter', 'was', 'aging', 'too', 'much', 'hold', 'character', 'together', 'Jenny', 'Funnell', 'Jean', 'secretary', 'was', 'delight', 'start', 'finish', 'Wonderful', 'walk-ons', 'Frank', 'Middlemas', 'Joan', 'Sims', 'Janet', 'Henfrey', 'Plantagenet', 'face.For', 'audience', 'prefers', 'not', 'have', 'real', 'plot', 'just', 'create', 'characters', 'let', 'lead', 'everyday', 'lives', 'always', 'ask', 'question', 'when', 'prepare', 'scripts', 'what', 'character', 'totally', 'integral', 'show', 'other', 'words', 'whom', 'could', 'not', 'kill', 'off', 'case', ""'As"", 'Time', 'Goes', 'character', 'created', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'probably', 'allowed', 'become', 'much', 'too', 'domesticated', 'carpet', 'slippers', 'striped', 'pyjamas.But', 'what', 'success', 'success', 'playing', 'almost', 'continuously', 'PBS', 'mind', 'little', 'way', 'real', 'competition']",As Time Goes By: Complete Original Series

Thinking he is no longer interested she moves on with her life. He having never received an answer from her thinks the same thing of her and so moves on with his life. They both marry other people, she has a daughter and becomes a widow.

174372,A27VMEB55OY9LS,1419815644,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","I will keep my comments brief since literally hundreds of people have already reviewed this series.This show is a great choice if you're tired of brash, loud guttermouths (no, I'm not talking about you, Chapelle) and overly-topical political satirists (no, I'm not talking about you, either, Colbert).The acting is superb (and it's very possibly the acting that keeps this now-dated show very funny and watchable). What needs saying about Judi Dench? If you haven't seen her in comedy before, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how well she can turn a funny phrase as the sharp-as-a-whip executive Jean. Geoffrey Palmer is giggle-worthy as the grumpy and clueless but gallant Lionel. The supporting cast provides a good balance between these two titans (in terms of both gender and intelligence).This is a gentle show for several reasons, but the most notable one is that the comedy is CLEAN most of the time. You could play most episodes of this show for your prudish elderly relatives without making them blush. Children might also find a few laughs since there is some physical comedy sprinkled around. This means, of course, that the writing has to be strong to make up for a lack of swearing or smutty plots...which it is in spades. There are actually some very level-headed observations in this show. It gives honest but wonderfully optimistic thoughts on aging and romance, and this alone makes it worth watching. Few topics are ignored, and the ones mentioned always put a dignified light on an issue. These characters aren't perfect, but they're willing to admit that as they deal with their problems. The solutions they come to are often funny and heartwarming at the same time, leaving you with that cliched but enormously appreciated ""warm, fuzzy feeling."" The plausible premise of the show (a relationship halted not by a breakup but instead by one lost letter in the mail) keeps it very down-to-earth: Jean and Lionel are a loving couple, but their ""second chance"" was itself a slim chance.I definitely recommend getting the entire series (though there are times when it may be cheaper to buy seasons separately instead of as a box set).",5,"Good writing, fun characters, and some graceful ideas about reunions and aging",1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,2150,"['will', 'keep', 'comments', 'brief', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'reviewed', 'series.This', 'show', 'great', 'choice', ""'re"", 'tired', 'brash', 'loud', 'guttermouths', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Chapelle', 'overly-topical', 'political', 'satirists', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'either', 'Colbert', '.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'very', 'possibly', 'acting', 'now-dated', 'show', 'very', 'funny', 'watchable', 'What', 'saying', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'turn', 'funny', 'phrase', 'sharp-as-a-whip', 'executive', 'Jean', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'giggle-worthy', 'grumpy', 'clueless', 'gallant', 'Lionel', 'supporting', 'cast', 'good', 'balance', 'two', 'titans', 'terms', 'gender', 'intelligence', '.This', 'gentle', 'show', 'several', 'reasons', 'most', 'notable', 'one', 'comedy', 'CLEAN', 'most', 'time', 'could', 'play', 'most', 'episodes', 'show', 'prudish', 'elderly', 'relatives', 'making', 'blush', 'Children', 'might', 'also', 'find', 'few', 'laughs', 'physical', 'comedy', 'sprinkled', 'around', 'course', 'writing', 'be', 'strong', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'swearing', 'smutty', 'plots', 'spades', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'level-headed', 'observations', 'show', 'honest', 'wonderfully', 'optimistic', 'thoughts', 'aging', 'romance', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching', 'Few', 'topics', 'are', 'ignored', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'always', 'put', 'dignified', 'light', 'issue', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', ""'re"", 'willing', 'admit', 'deal', 'problems', 'solutions', 'come', 'are', 'often', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'same', 'time', 'leaving', 'cliched', 'enormously', 'appreciated', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'plausible', 'premise', 'show', 'relationship', 'halted', 'not', 'breakup', 'instead', 'one', 'lost', 'letter', 'mail', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'Jean', 'Lionel', 'are', 'loving', 'couple', 'second', 'chance', 'was', 'slim', 'chance.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'getting', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'may', 'be', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'seasons', 'separately', 'instead', 'box', 'set']",As Time Goes By: Complete Original Series

Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer play a couple that originally met when they were in their late teens. She was a nurse, he, a soldier, during the time of the Korean War. They fell in love and had dreamed of living their lives together. That is until Lionel is stationed in Korea, leaving Jean behind in England. As so many separated young lovers they plan to write. And they do. But neither letter gets delivered. And both believe the other has moved on. Jean later marries and has a daughter. Lionel also marries and becomes a coffee farmer in Kenya. Thirty-eight years later, completely by accident, they meet again. Both blaming the other for never writing. By this time, Lionel is divorced and Jean is a widow. Thus begins the story of a love that never died between two people who no longer know each other... or do they? Their idiosyncrasies are the fun as they get to know each other again. And the supporting cast has their own unique problems! You will laugh and on rare occasions you might shed a tear or two.  Start at the beginning and you will come to love these people as much as I have. Yes, I did buy the series, only to find that there were two more seasons that our local PBS had never shown.

BBC production standards are among the world's best; BBC directors are exemplary; and BBC writers are enviable.  Put them all together and the series just cannot be anything other than a magical delight.  It is hilarity balanced by poignancy, light-heartedness balanced by some pretty heavy truths; good plain fun without a single put-down or disgusting word.  And guess what?  They pull off nine whole seasons without a single graphic sex scene, no more than a very rare mild expletive, and not a second of bare flesh...those things which seem to be presumed necessities in many of today's offerings.

We're generally fond of British comedy, but even by those standards this is amazingly well done. She bought me the whole set for Christmas and we've both been captured by the extra depth those early episodes bring to the characters. Who knew Lionel was an old dog who chased skirts -- least of all those of Judy and Sandy? I remember a vague reference, in the later episodes we had already seen, to Jean and Alistair having a brief thing, but this was also a pretty rich thread; when you actually see it happen, it's funnier than you thought the premise could be.I'd like to echo some of what others here have said: My significant other and I are younger than Jean and Lionel by ten years at least, but we met in our '40s and we identify with what Jean and Lionel project so well --the bittersweetness that comes with knowing you were extemely lucky to find the love of your life when many of your years are behind you, the sadness at having missed so much of the other's life. Also, the man who said this show spans many people's tastes in TV has it exactly right. My SO and I have very, very different tastes, in that I love Weeds and Californication, not to mention the books I read, and she's more into less-edgy, softer, ""family-oriented"" crap... (oops, did I say that aloud?)  With this show, we both adored it from the first. I asked her why she liked it and she said it seemed 'sweet' and 'real', which is exactly what I think. The jokes rarely seem forced and overwritten like American TV (think Three's Company and later Mork and Mindy); my SO said she hates laugh tracks and she was so glad this doesn't have one... until I pointed out that it does, in fact, have one...:-) I guess it's just not very obtrusive...Anyway, it's an awesome set.

A lost letter separated them during the Korean War and their lives took very different directions. When they get reacquainted the rich characters are flushed out with some deep laughter. The awkward courting of Jean by fumbling Lionel, the match making of born romantic Judith who wants to see her mother with Lionel, the vivascious book publisher Alistair driving Lionel crazy, the perky secratary Sandy, and Lionel's lively, eccentric father round out an excellent cast of characters. Each one adds a blend of qualities that are opposite the others yet compliment each other. EX: Lionel's dour caution and Alistair's positive can do spirit. Jean's worrying and Judith's follow your heart above all else made this show humorous and unpredictable.

I was a little put off at the price of the collection but didn't want to piece it together so just decided to bite the bullet, buy the collection and was very happy I did.  After spending quite a few hours recently watching all the episodes, I was glad I made the decision to buy the collection.  I was surprised that there were only a couple of episodes that I hadn't seen.  I would recommend this collection to anyone who loved the series and would like to be throughly entertained for about 30 minutes a pop.

174411,A303U1MOXG5R1F,1419815644,Sylviastel,"[4, 5]","As Time Goes By stars the incredible Dame Judi Dench OBE CH and Geoffrey Palmer OBE as former lovers who reunite after 38 years by accident. Judi plays Jean Pargeter, a widow who ran her own typing agency called Type for You which is like assigning secretaries for her clients. Her secretary, Sandy, is well-played by the actress and her daughter, Judith, is played by Moira Brooker who became an actress after watching Judi play Lady Macbeth. Despite Judi Dench's honors and awards, she can still do a sitcom. Unfortunately, she's very dry and British but does a great job in sometimes corny situations like when her sister-in-law of her late husband played brilliantly by Moyra Fraser bumps into her at a music store. Instead of telling Penny and her dentist husband, Stephen, that Lionel Hardcastle (played by Palmer) was a writer who just written his memoirs about his life in Kenya, she tells them that he's a psychiatrist who she met on the dodgems instead of 38 years ago before Korea and her marriage to Penny's brother. Penny and Stephen are childless couple who have been married for years and Penny runs the household and the marriage.Lionel's father, the late wonderful Frank Middlemass plays Rocky Hardcastle who decides to get married to the funny and charming, Madge, and honeymoon in Memphis. Rocky and Madge are big country music fans and are going to Graceland. They also love Johnny Cash and other country music without being over the top. Madge is played by the queen of the Carry On comedies, Joan Sims, who should have been made a Dame herself. Unfortunately, both the actors who played Rocky and Madge are gone in real life. Sims died in 2001 and Middlemass died a couple years ago but they are brilliant to watch. Also there is Mrs. Bale played by Janet Henfrey who reminds you of Allison Janney. She is a divorced woman who is a devoted housekeeper to senior Hardcastle and is like a member of the family.Rounding out the cast is Lionel's publisher, Alistair, played by Philip Bretherton who outdoes the role but makes him believable. Alistair falls in love with Jean but ends up with Judith. Sandy has somebody else. The series was never outrageous like other British comedies. There is almost 100 episodes of the series. According to Judi, the acting legend as she has been described, she prefers stage first, television second and film third. Because in television unlike films, she can revisit the character like Jean Pargeter Hardcastle and make her better each time. She does it naturally rather than over the top. The show is still shown wildly on American public television stations and is popular more than ever.I have written to Geoffrey Palmer once and Judi Dench twice and received responses. Believe it or not, they are down to earth and enjoy doing this series. Palmer could easily play Nixon, he has such a strong resemblance. With As Time Goes By, there are no losers but winners and hopeless romantics for a good romance story with all the problems intended.",4,An Almost Brilliant Series!,1249257600,"08 3, 2009",2009,3000,"['Time', 'Goes', 'incredible', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'OBE', 'CH', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'OBE', 'former', 'lovers', 'who', 'reunite', '38', 'years', 'accident', 'Judi', 'Jean', 'Pargeter', 'widow', 'who', 'ran', 'own', 'typing', 'agency', 'called', 'Type', 'assigning', 'secretaries', 'clients', 'Her', 'secretary', 'Sandy', 'well-played', 'actress', 'daughter', 'Judith', 'played', 'Moira', 'Brooker', 'who', 'became', 'actress', 'watching', 'Judi', 'play', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'honors', 'awards', 'can', 'still', 'do', 'sitcom', 'Unfortunately', 'very', 'dry', 'British', 'great', 'job', 'sometimes', 'corny', 'situations', 'when', 'sister-in-law', 'late', 'husband', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Moyra', 'Fraser', 'music', 'store', 'Instead', 'telling', 'Penny', 'dentist', 'husband', 'Stephen', 'Lionel', 'Hardcastle', 'played', 'Palmer', 'was', 'writer', 'who', 'just', 'written', 'memoirs', 'life', 'Kenya', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'met', 'dodgems', 'instead', '38', 'years', 'ago', 'Korea', 'marriage', 'Penny', 'brother', 'Penny', 'Stephen', 'are', 'childless', 'couple', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'years', 'Penny', 'household', 'marriage.Lionel', 'father', 'late', 'wonderful', 'Frank', 'Middlemass', 'Rocky', 'Hardcastle', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'funny', 'charming', 'Madge', 'honeymoon', 'Memphis', 'Rocky', 'Madge', 'are', 'big', 'country', 'music', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'Graceland', 'also', 'love', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'other', 'country', 'music', 'being', 'top', 'Madge', 'played', 'queen', 'Carry', 'comedies', 'Joan', 'Sims', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Dame', 'Unfortunately', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Rocky', 'Madge', 'are', 'gone', 'real', 'life', 'Sims', 'died', '2001', 'Middlemass', 'died', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'are', 'brilliant', 'watch', 'Also', 'Mrs.', 'Bale', 'played', 'Janet', 'Henfrey', 'who', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'divorced', 'woman', 'who', 'devoted', 'housekeeper', 'senior', 'Hardcastle', 'member', 'family.Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'Lionel', 'publisher', 'Alistair', 'played', 'Philip', 'Bretherton', 'who', 'role', 'believable', 'Alistair', 'love', 'Jean', 'up', 'Judith', 'Sandy', 'somebody', 'else', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'outrageous', 'other', 'British', 'comedies', 'almost', '100', 'episodes', 'series', 'According', 'Judi', 'acting', 'legend', 'been', 'described', 'stage', 'first', 'television', 'second', 'film', 'third', 'television', 'films', 'can', 'revisit', 'character', 'Jean', 'Pargeter', 'Hardcastle', 'make', 'better', 'time', 'naturally', 'rather', 'top', 'show', 'still', 'shown', 'wildly', 'American', 'public', 'television', 'stations', 'popular', 'more', 'ever.I', 'have', 'written', 'Geoffrey', 'Palmer', 'once', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'twice', 'received', 'responses', 'Believe', 'not', 'are', 'down', 'earth', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'series', 'Palmer', 'could', 'easily', 'play', 'Nixon', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Time', 'Goes', 'are', 'losers', 'winners', 'hopeless', 'romantics', 'good', 'romance', 'story', 'problems', 'intended']",As Time Goes By: Complete Original Series

This particular series is simply the finest body of television work it has been my pleasure to watch. The continued appeal of series such as ""Are You Being Served?"",""One Foot In The Grave"", ""Danger Man"" (seen in his country as ""Secret Agent Man"") attests to the extreme high-quality of British television productions. Dame Judi Dench, Geoffrey Palmer and the remainder of the cast of ""As Time Goes By"" smoke all American actors I've seen in their ability to actually pull you into the story line; effecting outbursts of spontaneous  laughter  from myself; alternating with actual tears from a man who normally does not allow any movie or television show to affect me such.
