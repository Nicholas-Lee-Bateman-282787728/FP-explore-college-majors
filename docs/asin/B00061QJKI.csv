855413,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00061QJKI,Artist & Author,"[1, 1]","When St. Paul was in Athens, he noted all the temples to the different gods; even one to 'The Unknown God.""  When he began to speak to the people, he noted how religious they were and then continued by saying that he came to proclaim the unknown God they worshiped without knowing Him.  [See Acts 17:23.]  The point is that he acknowledged the way the people were, and addressed them in terms they could understand.  While Sister Helen's manner might seem rough to many people, she also recognized the men as they were and spoke to them in terms with which they were familiar.  It is important to understand this concept because it is the key to Sister Helen's success in working with down and out men.When I was in college in New York, I had a friend who came from the South Bronx (who was in school on scholarship).  After I went with him to visit his family one weekend, I can say from firsthand experience that Sister Helen had to have been Divinely chosen to work with drunks and junkies like I saw all around my friend's house.  I stuck very close to my friend when we passed by vomit-stained junkies!  It would take a very special person to understand how to love men that would cause fear or apprehension in most middle-class people.  Therefore, I suggest that this movie be watched with this in mind, not by the standards of middle class, churchgoing America.  You don't need to be 'called' to work with such people, nor feel guilty because you emotionally couldn't work with them. We are taught that we shouldn't love people because they are Christian, but because we are!The best way for most people to watch this movie is to view it as a wonderful example of how God uses different kinds of people who are ideally suited for the different ministries to which they are called.  Sister Helen probably would be just as out of place in your pastor's place as he would be in hers!  Yet, one can appreciate the efforts of both in their calling to fulfil their Lord's ministry to people.",4,It Takes a Special Kind of Person,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1992,"['When', 'St.', 'Paul', 'was', 'Athens', 'noted', 'temples', 'different', 'gods', 'even', 'one', ""'The"", 'Unknown', 'God', 'When', 'began', 'speak', 'people', 'noted', 'how', 'religious', 'were', 'then', 'continued', 'saying', 'came', 'proclaim', 'unknown', 'God', 'worshiped', 'knowing', 'Him', '[', 'See', '17:23', ']', 'point', 'acknowledged', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'addressed', 'terms', 'could', 'understand', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'manner', 'might', 'seem', 'rough', 'many', 'people', 'also', 'recognized', 'men', 'were', 'spoke', 'terms', 'were', 'familiar', 'important', 'understand', 'concept', 'key', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'success', 'working', 'down', 'men.When', 'was', 'college', 'New', 'York', 'had', 'friend', 'who', 'came', 'South', 'Bronx', 'who', 'was', 'school', 'scholarship', 'went', 'visit', 'family', 'one', 'weekend', 'can', 'say', 'firsthand', 'experience', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'Divinely', 'chosen', 'work', 'drunks', 'junkies', 'saw', 'friend', 'house', 'stuck', 'very', 'close', 'friend', 'when', 'passed', 'vomit-stained', 'junkies', 'would', 'take', 'very', 'special', 'person', 'understand', 'how', 'love', 'men', 'would', 'cause', 'fear', 'apprehension', 'most', 'middle-class', 'people', 'Therefore', 'suggest', 'movie', 'be', 'watched', 'mind', 'not', 'standards', 'middle', 'class', 'churchgoing', 'America', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', ""'called"", 'work', 'such', 'people', 'feel', 'guilty', 'emotionally', 'could', ""n't"", 'work', 'are', 'taught', 'should', ""n't"", 'love', 'people', 'are', 'Christian', 'are', 'best', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'watch', 'movie', 'view', 'wonderful', 'example', 'how', 'God', 'different', 'kinds', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'ideally', 'suited', 'different', 'ministries', 'are', 'called', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'place', 'pastor', 'place', 'would', 'be', 'hers', 'Yet', 'one', 'can', 'appreciate', 'efforts', 'calling', 'fulfil', 'Lord', 'ministry', 'people']",Sister Helen

This film will shock some more traditional religious people but it is so honest.

855415,A111JO8Q4DSUZH,B00061QJKI,"D. Recio, SJ","[5, 5]","Sister Helen (2002) won critical attention at Sundance for its fiery title protagonist, Sister Helen Travis, a sixty-nine year old Benedictine nun, who runs a transitional home for men seeking to stay clean and sober. Rebecca Camissa and Rob Fruchtman's documentary manages to capture in considerable detail the difficulties of running a facility for men who battle their demons.What makes this documentary exceptional is that the founder, Sister Helen, has her own past with which she has to contend making her more than a `savior', but a fellow traveler who understands the trials the men face. Having lost her husband and two sons to the atrocities of drugs, alcohol, and in one case, murder, we can sympathize with Sister Helen's passion to assist others.Her no-nonsense style will provoke viewers who believe that members of religious orders should avoid profanity, speak prettily, and invoke God in a particular pious way. Sister Helen reflects the world from which she came: hard-bitten, tough, and demanding. Her tough-love approach guides the men who would have her believe the various lies they tell from time to time but she remains committed to them no matter how often they falter.Individuals who prefer their religious types similar to the folks in Sister Act and The Sound of Music would do well to avoid Sister Helen.",5,Well crafted documentary,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,1333,"['Sister', 'Helen', '2002', 'won', 'critical', 'attention', 'Sundance', 'fiery', 'title', 'protagonist', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'Travis', 'sixty-nine', 'year', 'old', 'Benedictine', 'nun', 'who', 'transitional', 'home', 'men', 'seeking', 'stay', 'clean', 'sober', 'Rebecca', 'Camissa', 'Rob', 'Fruchtman', 'documentary', 'manages', 'capture', 'considerable', 'detail', 'difficulties', 'running', 'facility', 'men', 'who', 'battle', 'documentary', 'exceptional', 'founder', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'own', 'past', 'contend', 'making', 'more', 'savior', 'fellow', 'traveler', 'who', 'trials', 'men', 'face', 'Having', 'lost', 'husband', 'two', 'sons', 'atrocities', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'one', 'case', 'murder', 'can', 'sympathize', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'passion', 'assist', 'others.Her', 'no-nonsense', 'style', 'will', 'provoke', 'viewers', 'who', 'believe', 'members', 'religious', 'orders', 'should', 'avoid', 'profanity', 'speak', 'prettily', 'invoke', 'God', 'particular', 'pious', 'way', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'world', 'came', 'hard-bitten', 'tough', 'demanding', 'tough-love', 'approach', 'men', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'various', 'tell', 'time', 'time', 'committed', 'matter', 'how', 'often', 'falter.Individuals', 'who', 'prefer', 'religious', 'types', 'similar', 'folks', 'Sister', 'Act', 'Sound', 'Music', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'avoid', 'Sister', 'Helen']",Sister Helen
855416,A2P0CHR2KVAY47,B00061QJKI,"Kayla P. ""The Magnificent""","[1, 10]","This is a disgusting ""documentary"". I was shocked and scandalized to see a woman consecrated to God using foul language and yelling obscentities.Also,I was amazed to see that the relationship between ""Sister Helen"" and the patients were almost a boyfriend/girlfriend type of relationship.They definitely did not have the normal relationship that sister has with those she is serving. I hated this documentary because it portrays religious sisters in such a poor light. I personally know Catholic sisters and I have NEVER EVER known one who would, or could(without being disciplined by superiors) behave in such a fould unmannerly way. There are many fine sisters who do amazing good work for society and the world at large. I think this film was designed to make them look bad, and I think it suceeded. While its true that not all religious are saints, it is also true that I have never met one that acted like she worked in a bar either. I only hope that anyone who watches this horrible film will also watch Malcolm Muggeridges ""Something Beautiful For God"". I think there is also a wonderful documentary called ""Mother Teresa"". I think the filmmakers definitely had an agenda in making this film, and I wonder that it was made since surely Sister's superiors would recognize how bad it would make them look.I do not recommend this trash to anyone.",1,Disgusting,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,1350,"['disgusting', 'documentary', 'was', 'shocked', 'scandalized', 'see', 'woman', 'consecrated', 'God', 'using', 'foul', 'language', 'yelling', 'obscentities.Also', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'relationship', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'patients', 'were', 'almost', 'boyfriend/girlfriend', 'type', 'relationship.They', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'normal', 'relationship', 'sister', 'serving', 'hated', 'documentary', 'religious', 'sisters', 'such', 'poor', 'light', 'personally', 'know', 'Catholic', 'sisters', 'have', 'NEVER', 'EVER', 'known', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'could', 'being', 'disciplined', 'superiors', 'behave', 'fould', 'unmannerly', 'way', 'are', 'many', 'fine', 'sisters', 'who', 'do', 'amazing', 'good', 'work', 'society', 'world', 'large', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'designed', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'think', 'suceeded', 'true', 'not', 'religious', 'are', 'saints', 'also', 'true', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'one', 'acted', 'worked', 'bar', 'either', 'only', 'hope', 'anyone', 'who', 'horrible', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'watch', 'Malcolm', 'Muggeridges', 'Something', 'Beautiful', 'God', 'think', 'also', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'called', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'definitely', 'had', 'agenda', 'making', 'film', 'wonder', 'was', 'made', 'surely', 'Sister', 'superiors', 'would', 'recognize', 'how', 'bad', 'would', 'make', 'look.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'trash', 'anyone']",Sister Helen

855419,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00061QJKI,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[18, 18]","Sister Helen is a superb, insightful documentary partly about Helen Travis, who at 56 became a nun. Two years later, Sister Helen opened a transitional home for men who were addicted to drugs or alcohol. Sister Helen has her personal reasons for trying to help these down and out men: her life had already been very rough. Indeed, Helen Travis had endured more than most of us could ever bear. She lost her husband to alcoholism; one of her sons died of a drug overdose and another son was stabbed seventeen times at the tender age of fifteen.In order to have empathy for Helen, you need to keep in mind that she came from a tough as nails, rough background. Sister Helen may have been wearing a nun's habit; but yes, she DID keep her own ways. She was very foul-mouthed; and she DID use her power to boss around the men who lived in her transitional home. This is going to cause great controversy because there are some of us who believe that nuns should not swear and refer to urine as some other four letter word which I will not repeat here.On the other hand, I saw Sister Helen doing a lot of good for the residents of her home. Let's face it: these were people whose lives had been destroyed by their overpowering addictions to drugs and alcohol. This is often precisely the type of person who needs a tough mentor to lead them away from drugs and alcohol and back toward a life of sobriety. I should know: as the son of an alcoholic, drug addicted mother, I will never forget how hard it was just to get my mother to go to a single A.A. meeting--just once. After many years my mother had to eventually hit rock bottom and only then she began a recovery that was never fully completed.In this film, look for Helen to essentially give tons of tough love to the men in her home in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City. These men have tried so many times and often failed to stay clean of drugs. What was Helen to do? As you will see in this film, Sister Helen possesses an uncanny ability to see through the lies they tell her when in fact they have abused drugs behind her back. She wisely calls for ""emergency meetings"" when one member may have to be kicked out--for the fifth time.Upon close examination, however, you'll see the love she does have for these men. She actually gives a fifth chance to the man who suffers from alcoholism; and she actually tells the men in another group meeting that she loves them dearly. She even goes completely off the deep end with her own grief and anger when a false positive drug report comes back that Major, one of her favorite residents, abused a drug. As it turns out, he was taking a prescription drug containing codeine which caused a false positive for opiate use. Sister Helen really should have publicly apologized to the man named Major; but she's human too and I guess she either couldn't muster it or she apologized privately when the cameras weren't rolling.There are extras that are equally interesting. Look for some extra interviews with several residents of the home; and there is some great commentary for you to choose if you wish.Overall, not everyone will like this documentary. If you are easily offended by four letter words, you should skip this one. If you can handle or even prefer to see tough love then you will enjoy this film. The last twenty minutes of the film are almost unexpectedly moving; and if you watch this documentary it will make a lasting impression on you.",5,fine documentary--even if it can be controversial,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,3455,"['Sister', 'Helen', 'superb', 'insightful', 'documentary', 'partly', 'Helen', 'Travis', 'who', '56', 'became', 'nun', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'opened', 'transitional', 'home', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'personal', 'reasons', 'trying', 'help', 'down', 'men', 'life', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'very', 'rough', 'Indeed', 'Helen', 'Travis', 'had', 'endured', 'more', 'most', 'could', 'ever', 'bear', 'lost', 'husband', 'alcoholism', 'one', 'sons', 'died', 'drug', 'overdose', 'son', 'was', 'stabbed', 'seventeen', 'times', 'tender', 'age', 'fifteen.In', 'order', 'have', 'empathy', 'Helen', 'need', 'keep', 'mind', 'came', 'tough', 'nails', 'rough', 'background', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wearing', 'nun', 'habit', 'yes', 'keep', 'own', 'ways', 'was', 'very', 'foul-mouthed', 'DID', 'use', 'power', 'boss', 'men', 'who', 'lived', 'transitional', 'home', 'going', 'cause', 'great', 'controversy', 'are', 'who', 'believe', 'nuns', 'should', 'not', 'swear', 'refer', 'urine', 'other', 'four', 'letter', 'word', 'will', 'not', 'repeat', 'here.On', 'other', 'hand', 'saw', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'doing', 'lot', 'good', 'residents', 'home', 'Let', 'face', 'were', 'people', 'lives', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'overpowering', 'addictions', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'often', 'precisely', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'tough', 'mentor', 'lead', 'away', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'back', 'life', 'sobriety', 'should', 'know', 'son', 'alcoholic', 'drug', 'addicted', 'mother', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'how', 'hard', 'was', 'just', 'get', 'mother', 'go', 'single', 'A.A.', 'meeting', 'just', 'once', 'many', 'years', 'mother', 'had', 'eventually', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'only', 'then', 'began', 'recovery', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'completed.In', 'film', 'look', 'Helen', 'essentially', 'give', 'tons', 'tough', 'love', 'men', 'home', 'South', 'Bronx', 'neighborhood', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'men', 'have', 'tried', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'often', 'failed', 'stay', 'clean', 'drugs', 'What', 'was', 'Helen', 'do', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'see', 'lies', 'tell', 'when', 'fact', 'have', 'abused', 'drugs', 'back', 'wisely', 'emergency', 'meetings', 'when', 'one', 'member', 'may', 'have', 'be', 'kicked', 'out', 'fifth', 'time.Upon', 'close', 'examination', 'however', ""'ll"", 'see', 'love', 'have', 'men', 'actually', 'fifth', 'chance', 'man', 'who', 'alcoholism', 'actually', 'men', 'group', 'meeting', 'dearly', 'even', 'completely', 'deep', 'end', 'own', 'grief', 'anger', 'when', 'false', 'positive', 'drug', 'report', 'back', 'Major', 'one', 'favorite', 'residents', 'abused', 'drug', 'out', 'was', 'taking', 'prescription', 'drug', 'containing', 'codeine', 'caused', 'false', 'positive', 'opiate', 'use', 'Sister', 'Helen', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'publicly', 'apologized', 'man', 'named', 'Major', 'human', 'too', 'guess', 'could', ""n't"", 'muster', 'apologized', 'privately', 'when', 'cameras', 'were', ""n't"", 'are', 'extras', 'are', 'equally', 'interesting', 'Look', 'extra', 'interviews', 'several', 'residents', 'home', 'great', 'commentary', 'choose', 'wish.Overall', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'like', 'documentary', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'should', 'skip', 'one', 'can', 'handle', 'even', 'prefer', 'see', 'tough', 'love', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'almost', 'unexpectedly', 'moving', 'watch', 'documentary', 'will', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression']",Sister Helen
