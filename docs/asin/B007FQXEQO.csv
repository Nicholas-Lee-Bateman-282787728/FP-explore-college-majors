Three deal with World War II, and one with crime and danger during the twenties and thirties.  In all the films, Bogart is at his best, providing a powerful way of expressing the thoughts and actions of the character he portrays.  The supporting cast in all of the films is outstanding with actors like Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, George Raft, Raymond Massey, Ida Lupino, Claude Raines, and Ann Sheridan, to mention just a few.  The story in each film is crisp and the storylines move quickly, aided by excellent directing.  Action scenes are done to underscore key elements of the plot, aided by music that dramatizes the events.  These are four, must have films for anyone who likes Bogart and is willing to be swept away by different stories and outcomes during the turbulent years before and during World War II.",5,Excellent compilation of films,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,893,"['are', 'four', 'films', 'impressive', 'perspectives', 'admirable', 'acting', 'Three', 'deal', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'one', 'crime', 'danger', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'films', 'Bogart', 'best', 'providing', 'powerful', 'way', 'expressing', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'character', 'supporting', 'cast', 'films', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Sydney', 'Greenstreet', 'George', 'Raft', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'Claude', 'Raines', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'mention', 'just', 'few', 'story', 'film', 'crisp', 'storylines', 'move', 'quickly', 'aided', 'excellent', 'directing', 'Action', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'underscore', 'key', 'elements', 'plot', 'aided', 'music', 'events', 'are', 'four', 'must', 'have', 'films', 'anyone', 'who', 'Bogart', 'willing', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'different', 'stories', 'outcomes', 'turbulent', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II']",TCM Greatest Classic Legends Film Collection: Humphrey Bogart (They Drive by Night / Across the Pacific / Passage to Marseille / Action in the North Atlantic)

Overall, I was pretty impressed by these four movies--and I've had my fair share of bad movie purchases based on reviews posted here.My favorite is ""Action in the North Atlantic,"" with the Allied supply ships being ""hunted"" by the U-boat wolf packs.  Even though some of the ""ships on the sea"" scenes were obviously models in a tub of water, they did not detract from the overall quality of the storyline and there were some outstanding real-life segments edited in which helped with the realism of the film which, incidently, was used for training Merchant Marines.  Bogart was very good in his first officer role of Joe Rossi and Raymond Massey, Alan Hale and Dane Clark provided good support.  There was a good amount of action and a satisfying conclusion pulled together quickly in the last 5 minutes.""Across the Pacific"" was also pretty good.  It actually surprised me.  The bantering between Bogart and Mary Astor was entertaining and Sydney Greenstreet played an obvious Japanese sympathizer, but you didn't quite know how sympathetic he was until the movie progressed.""Passage to Marseille"" really surprised me in being a good, solid adventure story about the cost of patriotism.  Peter Lorre was very good in a departure from the smarmy little man he played in The Maltese Falcon.  Besides Claude Rains, I wasn't familiar with the other actors' names but a few of them looked very familiar.  The story is told in flashback form and the ending is a tribute to the bravery and dedication of true patriots.  I don't think this was based on a true story, but it easily could have been.I thought ""They Drive by Night"" was the weakest of the four but certainly not a bad film,  It just seemed more ""dated"" than the others.  It throws a couple of curves in the storyline and goes from a trucker story to a kind of suspense drama.  Ida Lupino is very good as the unhappy wife (who eventually goes off the deep end in a great courtroom scene) of hapless Alan Hale.  She has an eye for George Raft but he only has eyes for stunning Ann Sheridan who's great as the wise-cracking waitress.Now, onto the packaging.  I can't quite figure out what people are whining about.  The ""stackable"" case is adequate with plenty of room for all 4 DVDs.  True, there is the chance for scratching if you're not super careful when handling the discs, but I solved that with the purchase of a Quad Disc DVD Case (5 pack) from CyberGuys for only $3.79.
