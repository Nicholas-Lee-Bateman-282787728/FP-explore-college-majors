I was pleasantly surprised how great the acting was; Ving Rhames is terrific as Sonny L. Probably my favorite performance, though, was from Nicholas Turturro, who could give Joe Pesci a run for his money! At times, I had to remember that I wasn't watching a documentary (although I'm sure director Robert Townsend took a few liberties!)With the language and occasional violence, obviously this is a film for adults.

I know it's difficult for Hollywood to make a realistic-type movie about celebrities, although they did an excellent job with Ray Charles.  Val Rhames was too old to play Liston, first off, especially in the 1950's and early 60's.  The people who really played a part in Liston's life wasn't there and they were inaccurate in many things.
