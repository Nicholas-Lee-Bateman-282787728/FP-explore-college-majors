Dalton,"[50, 52]","I first saw this TV adaptation of Bruce Jay Friedman's offbeat off- Broadway play on PBS Channel 28 in 1973 and was impressed not only by Valerie Perrine's nude shower scene but by the rest of the cast (Bill Bixby, Herb Edelman, Jose Perez, Shirley Kirkes, et al) and the bizarre story line -- an odd assortment of strangers find themselves in a Steambath, not knowing how they got there or why. The attendant seems to be the only one who has a purpose there.  A terrible purpose, we learn as the plot unfolds!  I saw this TV play twice back then and as far as I know it has never been shown since.  But at least it's available now on DVD.  I recommend it to all who enjoy a good comic fantasy with some serious overtones.  The image quality is good, though a little soft (perhaps because it's in a Steambath?) but there are no bonus features except for some trailers for other Broadway plays available.

A young guy named Tandy (Bill Bixby) wakes up in a steambath. He doesn't know how he got there, and neither do any of the people around him -- an old taxi driver, a gorgeous, somewhat dim-witted young woman (Valerie Perrine), a couple of aging gays, a slob, a gambler who is also a stock broker. The only person in the place who seems to know what's going on is the skinny, Puerto Rican bath attendent (Jose Perez). It slowly dawns on Tandy that he's dead and so is everyone else, except the attendent. Turns out the attendent is God, and the steambath is a holding room while God decides where to send them. He doesn't have a lot of time because there's always new people due to show up.God turns out to specialize in lame magic tricks and philosophical chatter. He likes the people to tell about their lives and explain why they shouldn't be dead. Perez is great as God who is skeptical of good intentions, has a load of disbelieving come-backs, and who has to keep things moving. Bixby does a first-rate job as a guy who has never done much with his life but who always intended to. And Valerie Perinne does an outstanding job as a sexy young lady sort of unaware of her effect on people. Other excellent actors are in the cast...some of them are Herb Edelman, Kenneth Mars, Stephen Elliot.Steambath is a dialogue-driven play, and the dialogue is very, very funy. This production was broadcast once by PBS and as far as I know was never repeated. I think it's highly unlikely that the PBS of today would ever take a chance on something like this. It has some nudity and some funny but strong situations. Mostly, it's food for thought while being irreverent...God as a Puerto Rican steambath attendent?If you're interested in American theater, the American Theater Archive is the place to look. They're saving a number of plays that appeared on television years ago. This is the only place to go if you're interested in seeing how gripping and sad Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Natwick were in Death of a Salesman (they recreate their stage roles), the incredible performances of Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst in A Moon for the Misbegotten, or why Robards was one of the great American actors as he stars in The Iceman Cometh.

721639,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00006RCMV,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 3]","Bruce Jay Friedman is probably best known as a screenwriter, but his writings encompass a wide field, including plays for the stage.  Among these is the 1970 STEAMBATH, which opened off-Broadway in 1970 with Anthony Perkins in the lead.  Audiences of the era were shocked by the play's profanity and occasional flashes of nudity, but it had a good run for an off-Broadway ""experimental"" show of the time, running about five months.  The play was adapted for television, with some revisions, by PBS in 1973.  It was considered as shocking as the original play, partly because of the way in which it depicted God, but more specifically because it included shots of Valerie Perrine's naked breasts.The PBS version tamed the language of the play, but both play and film are essentially the same.  Tandy (Bill Bixby) wanders into a steam room, where he meets an assortment of unexpected individuals--including Meredith (Valerie Perrine), who seems distinctly out of place in a men's steam room.  Over time, however, Tandy realizes he is dead and this steambath is a essentially a waystation in his journey to an unspecified final destination.  He is much annoyed to find that God is a heavily accented Pureto Rican bath attendant (Jose Perez); he is even more annoyed when the attendant attempts to prove his divinity by a series of carny-like tricks.  Ultimately, the attendant reveals himself as God--and then demands that each of the people in the bath tell their personal stories before being forced to travel to through a door that opens onto whistling wind and darkness.In some ways the play is derrivative.  In modern theatre he notion of a ""waystation"" in the afterlife goes bact at least as far as the 1923 play OUTWARD BOUND, and the notion of hell being a locked room similar to a steam bath was memorably imagined by Jean-Paul Sartre in the 1944 NO EXIT.  STEAMBATH wrings a few changes on the idea, most particularly by presenting the events in a bizarrely surrealistic way.  Two elderly men bicker; a pair of homosexuals speak in unison and suddenly break into song and dance; a failed stock broker is accompanied by an electronic ticker.  When God issues instructions, he informs a machine that presumably implements everything from death and destruction to mercy and kindness.  It many ways it is quite funny--but the end is slap in the face, when Tandy begs to be returned to life only to discover that, in spite of his protestations, he really has nothing for which to live after all.It's interesting stuff, but it is also very dated.  What shocked us in 1970 hardly makes us turn a hair today, and the play itself is visually static and the script is very, very talky.  The portrait of the gay men is also very dated, quite funny at times, touching at a particular point, but very, very close to being offensive by today's standards.  Even so, the performances are good--especially Perrine's wide-eyed innocent Meredith and Perez's take on God.  Certainly worth watching, but probably best seen by theatre fans.GFT, Amazon ReviewerThinking of Benny Surratt",4,Interesting 1970s Theatrical Artifact,1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,3070,"['Bruce', 'Jay', 'Friedman', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'screenwriter', 'writings', 'encompass', 'wide', 'field', 'including', 'plays', 'stage', '1970', 'STEAMBATH', 'opened', 'off-Broadway', '1970', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'lead', 'Audiences', 'era', 'were', 'shocked', 'play', 'profanity', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'nudity', 'had', 'good', 'run', 'off-Broadway', 'experimental', 'show', 'time', 'running', 'about', 'five', 'months', 'play', 'was', 'adapted', 'television', 'revisions', 'PBS', '1973', 'was', 'considered', 'as', 'shocking', 'original', 'play', 'partly', 'way', 'depicted', 'God', 'more', 'specifically', 'included', 'shots', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'naked', 'breasts.The', 'PBS', 'version', 'tamed', 'language', 'play', 'play', 'film', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'Tandy', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'steam', 'room', 'where', 'assortment', 'unexpected', 'individuals', 'including', 'Meredith', 'Valerie', 'Perrine', 'who', 'distinctly', 'place', 'men', 'steam', 'room', 'time', 'however', 'Tandy', 'dead', 'steambath', 'essentially', 'waystation', 'journey', 'unspecified', 'final', 'destination', 'much', 'annoyed', 'find', 'God', 'heavily', 'accented', 'Pureto', 'Rican', 'bath', 'attendant', 'Jose', 'Perez', 'even', 'more', 'annoyed', 'when', 'attendant', 'prove', 'divinity', 'series', 'carny-like', 'tricks', 'Ultimately', 'attendant', 'reveals', 'God', 'then', 'people', 'bath', 'tell', 'personal', 'stories', 'being', 'forced', 'travel', 'door', 'whistling', 'wind', 'darkness.In', 'ways', 'play', 'derrivative', 'modern', 'theatre', 'notion', 'waystation', 'afterlife', 'bact', 'least', 'as', 'far', '1923', 'play', 'OUTWARD', 'BOUND', 'notion', 'hell', 'being', 'locked', 'room', 'similar', 'steam', 'bath', 'was', 'memorably', 'imagined', 'Jean-Paul', 'Sartre', '1944', 'NO', 'EXIT', 'STEAMBATH', 'few', 'changes', 'idea', 'most', 'particularly', 'presenting', 'events', 'bizarrely', 'surrealistic', 'way', 'Two', 'elderly', 'men', 'bicker', 'pair', 'homosexuals', 'speak', 'unison', 'suddenly', 'break', 'song', 'dance', 'failed', 'stock', 'broker', 'accompanied', 'electronic', 'ticker', 'When', 'God', 'issues', 'instructions', 'machine', 'presumably', 'everything', 'death', 'destruction', 'mercy', 'kindness', 'many', 'ways', 'quite', 'funny', 'end', 'slap', 'face', 'when', 'Tandy', 'be', 'returned', 'life', 'only', 'discover', 'spite', 'protestations', 'really', 'nothing', 'live', 'all.It', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'also', 'very', 'dated', 'What', 'shocked', '1970', 'hardly', 'turn', 'hair', 'today', 'play', 'visually', 'static', 'script', 'very', 'very', 'talky', 'portrait', 'gay', 'men', 'also', 'very', 'dated', 'quite', 'funny', 'times', 'touching', 'particular', 'point', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'being', 'offensive', 'today', 'standards', 'Even', 'so', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'Perrine', 'wide-eyed', 'innocent', 'Meredith', 'Perez', 'take', 'God', 'Certainly', 'watching', 'probably', 'best', 'seen', 'theatre', 'fans.GFT', 'Amazon', 'ReviewerThinking', 'Benny', 'Surratt']",Steambath

I do not know whether it was in response to the requests here and elsewhere to re-release this fine film, but it is now available on sites such as this one, Amazon dot com, and for rental on netflix dot com.If ANYONE knows where I can obtain the 1973 UNCUT version shown outside the US, would you please contact me (see my review on imdb dot com, or just write to ww1965 at gmail dot com)?Maybe it's just because I'm a guy, but I think that the uncut version should be made available today because it adds to the impact of this insightful character study of the various personalities of the men (and one woman) who are ""trapped"" in the steam bath room. The uncut version is still very mild compared to what is available today, and it was all done very innocently. However, you knew that you were in for something unusual when Ms. Perrine suddenly appeared in what was apparently a men's shower/steam bath facility and dropped her towel! (You only see her from the waist up whenever she is turned toward you, of course. After all, this was 1973. Nevertheless, Ms. Perrine was facing the camera enough in the uncut version to make a lasting impression on this reviewer!)",5,Everyone Should Try to Find and Watch This Adaptation,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,2247,"['intriguing', 'imaginative', 'plot', 'excellent', 'acting', 'tragedy', 'TV', 'adaptation', 'Bruce', 'Jay', 'Friedman', 'play', 'not', 'being', 'available', 'today', 'audiences', 'have', 'been', 'repeated', 'several', 'reviewers', 'are', 'opinion', 'correct', 'views', 'wonderful', 'thought-provoking', 'black', 'comedy.I', 'know', 'least', 'one', 'reviewer', 'lamented', 'fact', 'many', 'reviewers', 'seemed', 'talk', 'more', 'nudity', 'merits', 'play/movie', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'be', 'so', 'course', 'version', 'shown', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'really', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'However', 'was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Perrine', 'not', 'only', 'when', 'was', 'performing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'uncut', 'version', 'Steambath', 'was', 'shown', 'UK', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'Television', 'European', 'continent', '1973.Quite', 'time', 'months', 'months', 'searching', 'finally', 'found', 'censored', 'American', 'version', 'Steambath', 'VHS', 'kultur', 'dot', 'com', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'site', 'mentioned', 'reviewer', 'Kultur', 'now', 'DVD', 'May', '2007', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'response', 'requests', 'here', 'elsewhere', 're-release', 'fine', 'film', 'now', 'available', 'sites', 'such', 'one', 'Amazon', 'dot', 'com', 'rental', 'netflix', 'dot', 'com.If', 'ANYONE', 'where', 'can', 'obtain', '1973', 'UNCUT', 'version', 'shown', 'US', 'would', 'please', 'contact', 'see', 'review', 'imdb', 'dot', 'com', 'just', 'write', 'ww1965', 'gmail', 'dot', 'com', 'Maybe', 'just', ""'m"", 'guy', 'think', 'uncut', 'version', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'today', 'impact', 'insightful', 'character', 'study', 'various', 'personalities', 'men', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', 'steam', 'bath', 'room', 'uncut', 'version', 'still', 'very', 'mild', 'compared', 'what', 'available', 'today', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'innocently', 'However', 'knew', 'were', 'something', 'unusual', 'when', 'Ms.', 'Perrine', 'suddenly', 'appeared', 'what', 'was', 'apparently', 'men', 'shower/steam', 'bath', 'facility', 'dropped', 'towel', 'only', 'see', 'waist', 'up', 'whenever', 'turned', 'course', 'was', '1973', 'Nevertheless', 'Ms.', 'Perrine', 'was', 'facing', 'camera', 'enough', 'uncut', 'version', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression', 'reviewer']",Steambath
