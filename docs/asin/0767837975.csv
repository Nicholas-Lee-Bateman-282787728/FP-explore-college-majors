Aidan Quinn is beautiful.  Such a beautifully written story and the setting in beautiful Ireland.  I could watch this movie over and over again.  The Quinn Brothers did an excellent job with this movie.  I have recommended this movie to many people.,5,This Is My Father,1349308800,"10 4, 2012",2012,380,"['love', 'movie', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'happen', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'such', 'James', 'Cann', 'course', 'wonderful', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'beautiful', 'beautifully', 'written', 'story', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'Ireland', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'Quinn', 'Brothers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'movie', 'have', 'recommended', 'movie', 'many', 'people']",N/A
21464,AYT4LRNRMCVT5,0767837975,"Chicago Dreamer ""chicagodreamer""","[17, 18]","This is an unforgettable film which deserves a huge audience.  It moves back and forth through past and present, weaving both together through a family and its history, and a lonely, burned out teacher's exploration of his roots.  Each view and each perspective in this family -- past and present -- is sensitively explored.  The most compelling, however, is the grandmother's love story with Kieran (Aidan Quinn) in County Galway in Ireland.  This film explores Irish life and the Irish perspective, and the blessings and curses of each.  The cast is superb, and Aidan Quinn gives a wonderfully moving performance as Kieran, the Father.There are other Fathers in this film.  Exploring these and musing about their meanings and their meddlings, past and present, is something best done by each individual viewer.  Beautifully photographed, superbly acted, and wonderfully conceived, this is a must-see film for everyone, but especially for anyone with an interest in Ireland.  This wonderful country and its history, its people, its music, its curses, its blessings, and its magic are all captured in loving detail onscreen.

Sadly, his mother Fiona is recovering from a stroke so she can't tell him the full story. Curiousity sends him back to Ireland to trace just what happened and what unfolds is a 1930's style forbidden affair between 17-year-old Fiona and a much older farmhand also named Kieran. Fiona has been expelled from school for her behavior but it doesn't calm her down much because the toan priest has to watch her moves at a community dance. Keiran Johnson's nephew Jack joins him on his ancestral quest and has a summer romance of his own.Forces beyond their control eventually doom the pair and Fiona escapes to Chicago with travelling gypsies. Most of Kieran Johnson's data comes from the landlord of the B&B; where he is staying and visits to his mother's abandoned childhood home. Between Irish fortune teller cards and interviews with the local villagers, Kieran pieces together the tragedy of his parents' relationship.The saddest thing is that Kieran's mother, once a fiery and adventurous teenager, is a semi-catatonic old woman nearing the end of her life and rendered speechless in contrast to her young self. In one scene Kieran calls his mother in Chicago from Ireland after finding a long lost love letter writter by his dead father in a secret hiding place for decades. When Kieran reads out loud in his voice from Ireland his mother hears his father's voice instead and breaks out in tears. Another example of the futility that the passage of time heals a tragic memory.

The majority of the film is set in Ireland - where James Caan goes to find out his ""background"". Colm Meany plays a part as well - funny character. This film managed to make me weep for the misunderstood and without giving away the plot - one scene just made be weep with the injustice of it all. Aidan Quinn is a gifted actor - who picks his movies with a sense of understanding - i.e. Benny and Joon, Practical Magic, Legends of the Fall. Tomas and the Rainbow - not all of them blockbusters - but with really meaningful stories. It's been a pleasure and a privilege to watch this movie (over and over I may say).

The how and why he goes is not as important as is what he learns, and how it transforms his life.  LET THIS STORY transform your heart - I know it did mine.The stories Caan's character learns should not be spoilt for the viewer here - but I will say that your heart goes out to the young and innocent Aidan Quinn as well as his sweet lass.  We already know that the young girl is Caan's (now) mother - but as she lays mute and dying, her amazing tale is revealed by people he meets in Ireland, who remember......As the viewer, be transported to the 30's in a country Irish town, where religion, social station, superstition and gossip is paramount.  The wicked ways innocent love is destroyed, will tear at your heart - and the tragedy that unfolds left me in tears.The equally ironic and sorrowful conclusion only adds to empowering humility Caan is left with in the end. The acting on all parts is superb, the accents, scenery, time and characters believable - and although the ""present"" scenes drag a tad, the film deserves to be watched to the finish.Please....watch this movie, and take away from it that same humility - to lose all sense of self and movtivation, and then in such a short time learn so much about your parent's lives....things you never knew - that are so beautifully and painfully tragic, that it seems only legends are made of these.You too would be able to stand taller in the end, introduce your story to others and say, ""This is my father....""",5,Only legends are made of these - a truly heart-breaking story,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1719,"['here', 'now', 'James', 'Caan', 'just', 'springboard', 'viewer', 'unmotivated', 'unhappy', 'teacher', 'given', 'opportunity', 'take', 'nephew', 'Ireland', 'where', 'more', 'family', 'past', 'bargained', 'how', 'why', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'what', 'how', 'life', 'LET', 'THIS', 'STORY', 'transform', 'heart', 'know', 'did', 'mine.The', 'stories', 'Caan', 'character', 'learns', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'spoilt', 'viewer', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'heart', 'out', 'young', 'innocent', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'as', 'well', 'sweet', 'lass', 'already', 'know', 'young', 'girl', 'Caan', 'now', 'mother', 'mute', 'dying', 'amazing', 'tale', 'revealed', 'people', 'Ireland', 'who', 'remember', 'viewer', 'be', 'transported', '30', 'country', 'Irish', 'town', 'where', 'religion', 'social', 'station', 'superstition', 'gossip', 'paramount', 'wicked', 'ways', 'innocent', 'love', 'destroyed', 'will', 'tear', 'heart', 'tragedy', 'left', 'tears.The', 'equally', 'ironic', 'sorrowful', 'conclusion', 'only', 'empowering', 'humility', 'Caan', 'left', 'end', 'acting', 'parts', 'superb', 'accents', 'scenery', 'time', 'characters', 'believable', 'present', 'scenes', 'drag', 'tad', 'film', 'be', 'watched', 'finish.Please', '.watch', 'movie', 'take', 'away', 'same', 'humility', 'lose', 'sense', 'self', 'movtivation', 'then', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'parent', 'lives', '.things', 'never', 'knew', 'are', 'so', 'beautifully', 'painfully', 'tragic', 'only', 'legends', 'are', 'made', 'these.You', 'too', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'taller', 'end', 'introduce', 'story', 'others', 'say', 'father']",N/A
