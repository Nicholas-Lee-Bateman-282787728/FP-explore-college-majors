This movie centers around Ferrell's ongoing competition with his dad which is mirrored to a lesser extent between their sons. They face off as soccer coaches and there are some predictable funny results. Many scenes I found disturbing and just sad instead of funny.

926396,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000ADWDE8,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell and so I was excited when this movie was released.  Although I never got a chance to see it in the theater I rushed to buy the DVD once it was released much to my wife's dismay, since she doesn't share the same love of Ferrell.  The greatest thing about this film is that, while Ferrell may have to reign in some of the outlandish remarks that make him so funny in order to keep a lower rating and appeal to children and parents alike, he still maintains the same enthusiasm for his work and delivers a performance that is over the top, hilarious and spontaneous, and one that even my wife found enjoyable.  That's probably one of the most commendable traits here.  It serves as a really great family sports comedy, appealing to children but also giving the parents something to laugh at.The film follows Phil Weston as he matches wits with his stubborn and overbearing father Buck.  Buck, played by Robert Duvall, has always been disappointed with Phil who never shared his father's love of sports and everything manly.  Instead Phil grew up to run a vitamin store, something Buck is somewhat ashamed of.  Throughout Phil's life his father always had to be the best, even if that meant trampling his own son down in the process, and now, years later when Phil's son Sammy gets the same treated from his dear old Grandpa, Phil has to take maters into his own hands.  He does that by offering to coach the loser team Buck traded Sammy to.  Buck is unsupportive but in the end it's the competition between the two Weston men that finally bonds them like they've never been before.Will Ferrell shines here, with all the quarks and loud mouthed antics that make his more adult oriented fare so entertaining.  As Phil ditches his vitamins for coffee he becomes loud, obnoxious and downright out of control and it all adds up to a great deal of fun.  Duvall is also effective as Buck.  He's rude, mean and at times a downright tyrant.  The first time I watched this movie his character actually made me angry.  Mike Ditka is actually really funny as himself here.  All the children are effective and funny in their own rights as well.The story is a sweet one at that, showing the importance of letting your children have fun and be themselves, of not adding undue pressure to their success and never allowing your own insecurities and self doubts to ruin your relationship with your child.  It shows the good and bad side of competition and the dangers of taking things too far.  But, in the end `Kicking and Screaming' is just good old fun and is one that the whole family can enjoy together time and time again.  I loved this movie (found it much more entertaining than the `Bad News Bears' remake released around the same time) and highly recommend it.  It may not be the best sports comedy out there, but what it lacks in originality it makes up in laughs.",4,Nonstop laughs the whole family can enjoy...,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,2885,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'so', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'theater', 'rushed', 'buy', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'much', 'wife', 'dismay', ""n't"", 'share', 'same', 'love', 'Ferrell', 'greatest', 'thing', 'film', 'Ferrell', 'may', 'have', 'reign', 'outlandish', 'remarks', 'make', 'so', 'funny', 'order', 'keep', 'lower', 'rating', 'appeal', 'children', 'parents', 'alike', 'still', 'same', 'enthusiasm', 'work', 'delivers', 'performance', 'top', 'hilarious', 'spontaneous', 'one', 'even', 'wife', 'found', 'enjoyable', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'commendable', 'traits', 'here', 'really', 'great', 'family', 'sports', 'comedy', 'appealing', 'children', 'also', 'giving', 'parents', 'something', 'laugh', 'at.The', 'film', 'Phil', 'Weston', 'wits', 'stubborn', 'overbearing', 'father', 'Buck', 'Buck', 'played', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'always', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Phil', 'who', 'never', 'shared', 'father', 'love', 'sports', 'everything', 'manly', 'Instead', 'Phil', 'grew', 'up', 'run', 'vitamin', 'store', 'something', 'Buck', 'somewhat', 'ashamed', 'Throughout', 'Phil', 'life', 'father', 'always', 'had', 'be', 'best', 'even', 'meant', 'trampling', 'own', 'son', 'down', 'process', 'now', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'Phil', 'son', 'Sammy', 'same', 'treated', 'dear', 'old', 'Grandpa', 'Phil', 'take', 'maters', 'own', 'hands', 'offering', 'coach', 'loser', 'team', 'Buck', 'traded', 'Sammy', 'Buck', 'unsupportive', 'end', 'competition', 'two', 'Weston', 'men', 'finally', 'bonds', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'before.Will', 'Ferrell', 'shines', 'here', 'quarks', 'loud', 'mouthed', 'antics', 'make', 'more', 'adult', 'oriented', 'fare', 'so', 'entertaining', 'Phil', 'vitamins', 'coffee', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'downright', 'control', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'Duvall', 'also', 'effective', 'Buck', 'rude', 'mean', 'times', 'downright', 'tyrant', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'movie', 'character', 'actually', 'made', 'angry', 'Mike', 'Ditka', 'actually', 'really', 'funny', 'here', 'children', 'are', 'effective', 'funny', 'own', 'rights', 'well.The', 'story', 'sweet', 'one', 'showing', 'importance', 'letting', 'children', 'have', 'fun', 'be', 'not', 'adding', 'undue', 'pressure', 'success', 'never', 'allowing', 'own', 'insecurities', 'doubts', 'ruin', 'relationship', 'child', 'good', 'bad', 'side', 'competition', 'dangers', 'taking', 'things', 'too', 'far', 'end', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'fun', 'one', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'together', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'loved', 'movie', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'remake', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'sports', 'comedy', 'there', 'what', 'originality', 'up', 'laughs']",N/A

926398,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B000ADWDE8,Bill Garrison,"[1, 2]","Kicking and Screaming stars Will Ferrell as Phil Weston.  Phil has constantly lived under the overbearing influence of his dad, Buck, played by Robert Duvall.  Buck competes at everything and humiliates is son when he isn't successful in sports.  Phil ends up coaching his own soccer team in a league against his dad, and Phil must decide if sports is more important than family like his dad taught him, or is family really what matters.This is a great movie to watch with the family because there is no swearing (except ""hell"" a few times) or sex or violence.  Although this movie is clean, it really isn't that good.  There are quite a few amusing moments, such as Mike Ditka as Phil's assistant coach, and the flashback to when Buck stole a soccer ball kicked into the stands from Phil.Overall, the movie appears to lack direction.  The kids on the soccer team are showcased a bit, but Phil's son and the lack of attention from Phil is ignored until the end.  Also, Phil, for no reason gets hooked on coffee.  This is kind of funny but also comes out of nowhere and feels like it doesn't belong.This movie is okay but also a great example of why movies are suffering at the box office.

The problem is that the adult parts were played by extremely talented and experienced actors and so the course of least resistance was taken: Feature the adults and leave the kids in the background. While I'm sure that it is difficult working with child actors, this movie seemed a little unbalanced in that the adults completely over-whelmed the story. For instance, while the relationship between Ferrell's character and Duvall's character got plenty of attention, the relationship between their sons was all but ignored. This was a rather unique situation. Although Ferrel's and Duvall's sons were the same age, one was the brother of Ferrell's character and the uncle of Ferrell's character's son! Again, it's understandable that the easy way out was taken given the immense talent of the adult actors, but it would have been nice if more attention had been paid to the child characters given this unique situation.Ditka was a lot of fun in this movie, although he basically just played himself. The bonus features that come with the movie are also worth viewing.

The coffee scenes started to become annoying after too many of them and the whole fighting with the father/son also got annoying as it tended to be the same scenes over again.  I felt the soccer parts of the movie are what kept this movie afloat.  Those kids had talent not only in soccer but in comedy.  I feel with a better script and less time taken up then this movie would have shined.  I also noticed it was quite a long movie.

926403,A2S02XWWNNHUIX,B000ADWDE8,C. E. Miles,"[1, 1]","Let's get a few things straight right off the bat, okay?1. Not every movie ever made has to be thought provoking and artistically satisfying.2. Will Ferrell will probably never be mentioned in the same breath as De Niro and Pacino.If you can get on board with these two statements, then you might just enjoy ""Kicking & Screaming"". Let's face it, the premise is almost absurd, but isn't absurdity the stuff of good comedy?Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is upset that his son Sam is nothing more than a bench warmer on the soccer team coached by his father Buck Weston (Robert Duvall). To appease Phil, Buck trades Sam to a rival soccer team so he can get more playing time, and through a series of events Phil becomes the coach of Sam's new team. The only problem is Phil knows nothing about soccer. What follows is a string of hilarious moments that culminate with a Father versus Son coached championship match.As a whole this is not a great movie, but there are many moments that are laugh out loud hilarious, and it seems the more you watch it, the more you like it. Ferrell is in rare form as he slowly transforms from the milquetoast, quiet, inept coach to the win at all cost clone of his father. His rants will leave you with a ton of quotable lines that will make you laugh just thinking about them.

926408,A2DK2OY6R3WICK,B000ADWDE8,C.W. Fitch,"[1, 2]","To say that ""Kicking And Screaming"" is a charming, feel-good comedy that will teach your kids the meaning of sportsmanship would be similar to calling ""Scarface"" an instructional video for starting one's own business.  (Wait a minute...)  A more accurate analogy would be closer to ""Bad News Bears"" on a soccer pitch; right down to the big kid with the AC/DC T-shirt.Here's the gist:  Saturday Night Live alum Will Ferrell stars as Phil Weston, a middle-aged vitamin salesman who reluctantly agrees to coach his son's soccer team when the original coach goes missing.  While at first merely a good deed for the day, the gesture soon presents an opportunity to finally one-up his disturbingly overcompetitive dad, Buck (Robert Duvall), who coaches a rival team.  With the help of Buck's neighbor Mike Ditka (yes, you read that right), a pair of Italian juvenile ringers, and several gallons of coffee (you'll just have to see for yourself how that makes sense), Watson's Tigers make it to the championship game, where they showdown with Buck's Gladiators.Like ""Bad News Bears"", soccer moms and dads looking for a moral to this story will be disappointed.  If anything, though, ""Screaming"" does okay as a jab to the whole youth soccer phenomenon.  Emotionally, the film's like Space Mountain; you'll chuckle, your eyes will widen in disbelief, you'll shake your head, and you'll be thankful the whole thing wasn't longer, all in a span of 90 or so minutes.  Phil's java-induced transformation from oversensitive parent to psychobabbling, child-scaring tyrant provides for most if not all of the aforementioned reactions; it's cute at first, but as the movie progresses, it just gets old.  It does have its share of funny, though; the tetherball game between Phil and his dad is particularly snort-worthy, as are Ditka's interactions with just about everyone in the cast.  The comedy is offset a little by a couple of out-of-place quirks; most notably the whole thing with Buck's other son.  That little attempted plot twist could've added more to the story, but only serves to add a pinch of unnecessary weird.The cast is supported rather nicely by a menagerie of sketch comedy veterans:  Dave Herman (Mad TV, Office Space) plays a folically-challenged, stressed-out referee; Laura Kightlinger and Rachel Harris (The Daily Show, I Love the 80s) complement each other as a lesbian couple whose adopted Asian son plays for Phil's team; and Alex Borstein (Mad TV's ""Ms. Swan"") turns in a cameo with her black Hummer (in a darned funny, fist-raising moment for SUV owners everywhere).All told, this comedy doesn't score a goal for the genre, but it does ring off  the figurative crossbar.  Will Ferrell indeed proves his genius once again; while not his best or most hilarious performance, it is still gold, and lifts the film above average in a few places.

926409,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000ADWDE8,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 2]","Okay, so sports movies are a dime-a-dozen, as are Will Ferrell movies.  The difference is that sports movies can get repetitive and boring, while Ferrell movies can get repetitive but, at least to me, are never boring.  I love Will, I just think he's absolutely hilarious, and his character in 'Kicking and Screaming' is no exception!Ferrell plays Phil Weston, a vitamin salesman who lives under a shell his over critical father Buck (Duvall who is brilliantly evil here) placed him in as a child.  Phil swore never to do that to his son who seemed to get the same sports handicaps that Phil grew up with.  When Buck trades his own grandson to the loser team this sends Phil into a vengeful state, to the point where he enlists the help of Mike Ditka (yes, the real Ditka) to help him coach the team of misfit children in order to play his fathers team of super athletes.Phil's transformation from shy and timid to uncontrollably competitive is absolutely hilarious!  This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it has enough in it to satisfy any fan of Ferrell and even some who just want a decent family comedy.  Unlike the similar 'Bad News Bears' 'Kicking and Screaming' has nothing offensive and is just plain clean fun.

926410,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000ADWDE8,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[4, 7]","I went to see this movie expecting a lot, maybe too much.  ""Kicking and Screaming"" is not a bad movie.  But I think it could have been a great movie with a little more thought put into the script.  As much as I like Will Ferrell, I think this is a movie that should have focused a little more attention on the kids in the film.  I don't mean that the film should have left anything out concerning the mental battle between Ferrell (Phil) and Robert Duvall (Buck, Phil's dad).  But the film could have used a boost from the young actors in the film; they all seemed very talented - it made the viewer want to see more involvement by their characters.I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I won't go into too much detail as I explain how this movie could have been a little better (and also point out what was right about the film):#1.  Anyone who has ever coached, has at one time or another felt like they were in over their heads.  Phil'sfirst day coaching (young kids) was a good example of the shock one gets.#2.  The soccer players were a little too tame in this movie.  The Tigers needed to show a little more street-savvy in my opinion.  The script had them acting like they were trying out for the ""Leave It to Beaver"" pilot.#3.  The Italian brothers (at least I think they were brothers) should have had more speaking roles.  Maybe having one of the other kids constantly trying to teach them English, but not having much luck.  It was missed opportunities like this that made the script appear weak and hurried.  The writers created these amazing characters and then didn't use them.#4.  Phil's addiction to coffee was hilarious and added a nice side-story to the movie.#5.  I would have shot for little more realism with this film.  The entire movie had a ""it's a movie - we don't have to make it seem like it could really happen"" feeling to it.  That always upsets me.  I believe movies can be funny without throwing out the realism.#6.  Phil's son needed to have a lot more screen time.  Ya barely saw the kid!#7.  And finally, I think the movie could have used a girl on the soccer team.  It just doesn't seem like a made for kids movie with no girl on the team.  Maybe she could have taught the Italians English?

926411,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000ADWDE8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[11, 16]","Will Ferrell is always funny, and the part of Phil Weston would seem to be tailor-made for his comedic antics. Phil's basically a little boy in a man's body, a little boy who wants to finally prove himself to his father and make up for never having met the old man's expectations. Robert Duvall lends the film an importance presence and additional laughs as the highly competitive Buck Weston, sporting goods king and highly successful coach of the Youth Soccer League Gladiators team. Phil (Ferrell) has never been able to get a leg up on his father - but certainly not from lack of effort. When he got married, his father got re-married; when he had a son, his father's wife gave birth to a son (slightly larger, of course) the same day. Young Sam and his equally young uncle Bucky play for the Gladiators, Buck's team, and they are all but unbeatable. Sam, though, is the proverbial benchwarmer, so Buck decides to trade his own grandson to the league's worst team. Yes, it's another team of misfits of all shapes and sizes that just need an incredible coach to take them to unsuspected glory. That coach is nowhere to be seen, and Phil ends up taking on the job.That's when the competitive juices start flowing. The first big move Phil makes is to take on an assistant coach, his dad's neighbor and long-time enemy Mike Ditka. Iron Mike is surprisingly good in this film and more than holds his own beside both Ferrell and Duvall. He only takes the job to try and make Buck's life more difficult, but he soon goes about whipping the little misfits into shape. The team still stinks, but their fortunes begin to change when Ditka and Phil bring in two new players, a pair of Italian kids who were apparently born with soccer balls balanced on their feet. The team begins winning, and with every win Phil goes a little more cuckoo for cocoa puffs; his new coffee addiction doesn't really help, either. Sure, it's funny to watch Ferrell go about inspiring his team in pretty unorthodox ways, but it eventually gets to the point that the whole thing stops being funny. Even Ditka can't get behind telling the kids to cheat (without getting caught, of course) or break a few clavicles. Ferrell's character just goes so over-the-top that you just want to slap him; he lets the desire to beat his dad corrupt him completely, and the lack of moderation in the second half of the film is a real negative.There are a lot of laughs to be had in Kicking and Screaming. It's exceedingly formulaic and predictable, but that doesn't matter all that much as long as the laughs keep coming. The script just takes Ferrell's character way too far over the line; watching a crazy guy coach soccer is funny, but watching a freak going bonkers on the sidelines is more annoying than anything else. The film could really have used more Ditka in the later stages. Don't go thinking this is some cameo by Iron Mike; he gets a lot of screen time, and he makes this movie better and funnier with all of his trademark habits.In the end, Kicking and Screaming is a very funny movie, but it's not a great comedy. Despite excellent performances all around (especially Ditka's), the film is just too over-the-top for its own good. You can't say the movie tries to be anything more than it is, though - it's all about generating laughs and nothing else.",4,Very funny until the comedy is allowed to get out of hand,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,3324,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'always', 'funny', 'part', 'Phil', 'Weston', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'tailor-made', 'comedic', 'antics', 'Phil', 'basically', 'little', 'boy', 'man', 'body', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'finally', 'prove', 'father', 'make', 'up', 'never', 'having', 'met', 'old', 'man', 'expectations', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'film', 'importance', 'presence', 'additional', 'laughs', 'highly', 'competitive', 'Buck', 'Weston', 'sporting', 'goods', 'king', 'highly', 'successful', 'coach', 'Youth', 'Soccer', 'League', 'Gladiators', 'team', 'Phil', 'Ferrell', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'leg', 'up', 'father', 'certainly', 'not', 'lack', 'effort', 'When', 'got', 'married', 'father', 'got', 're-married', 'when', 'had', 'son', 'father', 'wife', 'gave', 'birth', 'son', 'slightly', 'larger', 'course', 'same', 'day', 'Young', 'Sam', 'equally', 'young', 'uncle', 'Bucky', 'play', 'Gladiators', 'Buck', 'team', 'are', 'unbeatable', 'Sam', 'though', 'proverbial', 'benchwarmer', 'so', 'Buck', 'trade', 'own', 'grandson', 'league', 'worst', 'team', 'Yes', 'team', 'misfits', 'shapes', 'just', 'need', 'incredible', 'coach', 'take', 'unsuspected', 'glory', 'coach', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'Phil', 'up', 'taking', 'job.That', 'when', 'competitive', 'juices', 'start', 'flowing', 'first', 'big', 'move', 'Phil', 'take', 'assistant', 'coach', 'dad', 'neighbor', 'long-time', 'enemy', 'Mike', 'Ditka', 'Iron', 'Mike', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'more', 'own', 'beside', 'Ferrell', 'Duvall', 'only', 'job', 'try', 'make', 'Buck', 'life', 'more', 'difficult', 'soon', 'whipping', 'little', 'misfits', 'shape', 'team', 'still', 'fortunes', 'begin', 'change', 'when', 'Ditka', 'Phil', 'bring', 'two', 'new', 'players', 'pair', 'Italian', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'apparently', 'born', 'soccer', 'balls', 'balanced', 'feet', 'team', 'winning', 'win', 'Phil', 'little', 'more', 'cuckoo', 'cocoa', 'puffs', 'new', 'coffee', 'addiction', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'Sure', 'funny', 'watch', 'Ferrell', 'go', 'inspiring', 'team', 'pretty', 'unorthodox', 'ways', 'eventually', 'point', 'whole', 'thing', 'stops', 'being', 'funny', 'Even', 'Ditka', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'telling', 'kids', 'cheat', 'getting', 'caught', 'course', 'break', 'few', 'clavicles', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'just', 'want', 'slap', 'desire', 'beat', 'dad', 'corrupt', 'completely', 'lack', 'moderation', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'real', 'are', 'lot', 'laughs', 'be', 'had', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'exceedingly', 'formulaic', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'matter', 'that', 'much', 'as', 'long', 'laughs', 'keep', 'coming', 'script', 'just', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'line', 'watching', 'crazy', 'guy', 'coach', 'soccer', 'funny', 'watching', 'freak', 'going', 'bonkers', 'sidelines', 'more', 'annoying', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'Ditka', 'later', 'stages', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'thinking', 'cameo', 'Iron', 'Mike', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'better', 'funnier', 'trademark', 'habits.In', 'end', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'comedy', 'excellent', 'performances', 'especially', 'Ditka', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'own', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'generating', 'laughs', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A
926412,A12SHC9IT3VZQG,B000ADWDE8,Daniel Sweeney,"[4, 7]","Let me say up front that I think Will Farrell is one of the five funniest humans currently walking the the face of the earth.  That said, based on his involvement with ""Kicking and Screaming"", he is also one of the five worst judges of movie scripts!All right, maybe that's a little unfair to say, since he was in ""Old School"" and ""Anchorman"", which were both very funny movies. And I guess it's possible that at some point -- very, very early in its development period -- ""Kicking & Screaming"" might have shown enough promise to make him think it'd be a worthy successor to those bombastic comedies.So what happened?  I suspect that, at a key juncture, the filmmakers decided to approach it as BOTH a G-rated kids' sports movie and an adult comedy.  As has happened with most such films before it (many helmed my directors more adept than Jesse Dylan), the result is an empty movie orphan which satisfies neither audience.And it doesn't help that the film looks like it was directed by a 12-year-old -- with spare change, on a saturday afternoon -- who has never even WATCHED soccer before.It's tough to call this a truly awful movie, because there are a few laughs scattered here and there, mostly because Ferrell is able to mine one or two golden nuggets from the mostly barren script.  But they are few and far between.  He has little help from the rest of the cast (aside from Mike Ditka), and the kids especially are a disappointment.  I expect more from executive producer Judd Apatow, who scored a slam dunk with his cast for the TV show ""Freaks and Geeks.""  I guess he used up all of his casting inspiration on that show, because this is perhaps the least memorable kid cast ever.As you probably know by now, Ferrell plays Phil Weston, an over-his-head youth soccer coach saddled with a sad-sack team who feels inadequacy towards his father (Robert Duvall), also a coach, but more successful.  Hilarity is supposed to ensue from this premise, but doesn't.  Despite the use of every single tired sports-movie cliche in the book.The main problem is that we never care about any of characters.  We never get any feel for the relationship between Ferrell and his kid, which should be pivotal because that's what gets him into coaching. The kids are broad stroked and typecast (the short shy kid, the big slow kid, the jokester, etc.) and never really figure into the story in any meaningful way.  And Mike Ditka is supposed to be Duvall's nemesis...but why?  Motivations are never explained.  The result is a very empty movie.Director Jesse Dylan (son of Bob Dylan) brings nothing to the party and ineptly stages a series of pratfall-ridden music videos featuring the most used-to-death sports anthems -- Vangelis' theme from ""Chariots of Fire,"" Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" and Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger.""And I'm no soccer expert per se, but I played for 13 years and can tell good-movie soccer from bad-movie soccer...and this is as bad as it gets!  I was shocked to learn that they had ""soccer advisors"" on-set.  I hope that's not your day job, guys, because this is some very shoddy stuff!If you're looking for a good family sports movie, check out Dennis Quaid's ""The Rookie"" which came out a few years ago.

The opening title sequence chronicling Ferrell's sports follies is hilarious, and it sets a good pace for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, the movie does not create those kind of laughs for the rest of the movie. Truth be told, Will Ferrell makes this movie watchable. Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Ray Romano could not have done the same thing Ferrell has done here. His adlibs carry most of the movie, as the characters around him go by the script and are not nearly as funny. Most of the scenes with Ferrell and Mike Ditka work because they try so hard to make it funny that it actually works. In my opinion, even though this is a pretty good movie, Will Ferrell was much better in his more adult movies like ""Old School"", ""Zoolander"", ""Anchorman"", ""Starsky And Hutch"", ""Superstar, the first two ""Austin Powers"" movies, and the more somber ""Melinda And Melinda"". Even 2003's kid-aimed Christmas movie ""Elf"" was hilarious, and is one of my Christmas favorites.  ""Anchorman"" is very clever and so is ""Old School"", but those two movies show just how funny Ferrell can be when he want to be. He doesn't need to tame himself for movies like this when he would have been perfectly fine doing the remake of ""The Longest Yard"" (he would probably be funnier than Adam Sandler).  It seems almost as if he has tamed himself for this role, something he could have easily avoided. The movie is going to bore most kids ages 3-10, mostly because of the long stretches of just talking in the middle. So, if your adlibbing alot of your lines, and the director has only directed R rated movies in the past, why not bump the rating up to a PG-13 and throw in a few sex and drug references and maybe an f-word, or something. People in the general audience tend to discriminate against movies that are marketed for a long time as one of those ""Not Yet Rated"" movies, and then it turns out that its rated PG. Movies like ""National Treasure"", which had previews running in late July, was unrated until early November, the same month it was released. ""Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy"" began its long marketing career in December was finally rated in March. Both those movies were very good, and there were alot of people that didn't see them because of the PG rating. ""Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"" was first previewed to me (I don't know about the other people) when I went to see ""Troy"". I first found out the rating the week before it came out in September. It was supposed to be released in the summer, but it was delayed probably because of editing. That movie was only OK, but it goes to show what a PG movie can be. This is different. It was rated almost immediately, and it drew a large audience on opening weekend. But people, I can not stress enough that this is about as much a kids movie as ""Meet The Focker's"". It is geared more towards adults, like ""Finding Neverland"", but because of the rating people think that it's appropriate for kids. Will Ferrell is the only movies that this movie is watchable most of the time. Without him, the movie is as kiddie-fare as they come.Will Ferrell plays Phil Weston, owner of a vitamin store and father of ten year old Sam Weston (Dylan McLaughlin). His father, Buck Weston (Robert Duvall), has always been highly competitive. From sticking a soccer ball in Phil's cradle as a child to playing him in a tetherball tournament as an adult, he has always wanted to win. Sam plays on the Gladdiators, Buck's soccer team. Buck always keeps Sam on the bench throughout the entire game, and finally, when Phil confronts him about this, Buck informshim that he has traded Sam to the Tigers. Think of them as the ""special"" soccer team. When the coach drops out because the kids drove him crazy one game into the season, Phil must take over or dissapoint Sam and the entire rest of the team by forfitting the entire season. After several humiliating losses, mostly to Buck's team, Phil makes the executive decision and arranges some intense practices. These scenes are not that funny, but they really should be. One kid eats worms. Ha-ha! Another pretends to be pregnant by shoving a soccer ball up his shirt and yelling ""It's about to come out!"". That's the highlight of the entire sequence. Oh lord. Other moments in the movie just are not funny because they try too hard. The entire last act with ""The Italians""is just an excercise in seeing how far and how funny one joke can be.It's the equivalent of seeing how many tricks a one trick pony can do. Phil eventually gets obsessed, almost dangerously, in the game. Big suprise, the kids stop having fun. Sam quits the team, and Phil starts going a little Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction"" with the look of the team. He makes himself a costume, blue with black tiger stripes, and starts to coach the kids with that. For some reason I don't think they took him very seriously, or will ever take him very seriously. He looks like a pimp. Sans the cane and fuzzy purple hat. Phil enlists the help of Mike Ditka (playing himself here), who is his fathers arch enemy. Phil's team begins to get better, and soon they begin to win. This is when Phil gets too cocky for his. . .britches? No! Too cocky for his pimp costume.Soon, late into the third act, in the last 45 minutes, the movie picks up pace again and begins to get funnier. Of course, like there is with every kid movie, the coach teaches a valuable life lesson to all his kids. This happened in the terrible ""Hoosiers"", and most recently in the well done but mortally flawed ""Friday Night Lights"". Only this movie does it in a more stylized way, and when it is over we realize what has happened, It never comes to our mind that the coach is preaching when he is actually doing the act. Like all other sports movies, the kids come together to help one another. The outcasts, the shy kids, and the too-cool-for-school kids. Again, this happened in ""Hoosiers"" with everyone trying to get that Jimmy kid on the team, and so Gene Hackman. . .that was the ""French Connection"", sorry. In ""Friday Night Lights"", all the team mates tried to help Boobie Miles to get off his major ego trip (it doesn't help because they end up losing). Seriously, though. Who names there kid Boobie? They are just asking for trouble with that one. Why not Bobby? Billy. I could think of a million better names that Boobie (and it really did not help his character in that movie when in the middle he started blingin' it out). I'm sorry, but this movie, although very funny and clever in parts, is just another predictable kid movie that will appeal to several adults. Ferrell was much funnier as Frank The Tank in ""Old School"", and he was a riot as the chauvanistic Ron Burgandy in the guilty pleasure ""Anchorman"". This is the kind of movie that will provide many laughs on family pizza night, just make sure you have several glasses of soda first. If you really like Will Ferrell, like me, catch this in theaters and you probably will not be terribly dissapointed. I know I wasn't. If you don't really like him, skip this and take the kids to ""Madagascar"", and if you're geeky like that ""Star Wars"" for the fourty-eighth time. This is more the kind of movie Ferrell should have done during his SNL hiatus, not as a fully developed movie star. I secretly kept hoping he would strip down and streak across the soccer field. Will, here my plea: Go back to R and PG-13 movies, not these kind of kids movies. I hope there will be a directors cut when released on DVD.Rated PG for Language and Sexual Innuendo.",4,Yet Another Kiddie-Fare Flick Made Watchable By Ferrell,1117411200,"05 30,

926419,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B000ADWDE8,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[0, 0]","It's one of the oldest clich&eacute;s in the book:  The misfit team of losers who have to pull together to win; and not just win a single game, but the whole championship.  This is usually the stuff of gaggy sports dramas, but with Will Ferrell thrown into the mix, it's bound to be full of laughs.  And ""Kicking and Screaming"" is certainly funny, mostly thanks to the popular SNL alumnus.As Phil, a wimpy soccer dad, Ferrell excels at being the inept dork he is usually cast as.  Living for years under the thumb of his abrasive father, Buck (Robert Duvall), Phil has developed a quasi-hippie, peace-loving mentality, but is unexpectedly conscripted to be the coach of the last-place Tigers, while his dad coaches the champion Gladiators.Being a coach seems to go completely against his non-aggressive personality, and Phil is soon in over his head simply trying to get the kids to practice.In order to add some family tension to the whole mess in a completely nonsensical way, Phil has a younger brother who is the same age as his own son, and the two boys play on their respective father's team.  Without a doubt, this is one of the most confusing family setups I've ever seen in this kind of movie.To aid Phil in his almost impossible task of training his team of misfits, he gets the help of Mike Ditka, who just so happens to be Buck's next-door neighbor, and who jumps at the chance to best him.  Ditka is more of a personality than a real actor, but his toughness makes for a good contrast to Phil's wimpiness.The movie is classic Ferrell humor; it's only really funny when he's running about, acting like a lunatic, and  he's quite good at that.  Phil gradually loses his sense of fun for the sport, and becomes obsessed with winning (as well as addicted to coffee), and simply goes nuts.Always a good indicator for comedies:  this film managed to have a funny trailer without giving away every good joke it had, again primarily thanks to Will Ferrell's incredible improvisational abilities.  It seemed like he was always saying or doing something worthy of a laugh.""Kicking and Screaming"", though it may be a silly comedy, provides strong commentary on the disturbing trend for parents to become far too involved in their kid's sports teams, and Ferrell's performance, while entertaining and funny, should serve as testament to what can happen to these over-enthused parents.Despite its blandly predictable ""winning isn't everything"" moral, this film manages to remain fun and still get the message across without beating the audience over the head with it.",4,"Ferrell's game is on in ""Kicking""",1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,2567,"['one', 'oldest', 'clich', 'eacute', 'book', 'misfit', 'team', 'losers', 'who', 'have', 'pull', 'together', 'win', 'not', 'just', 'win', 'single', 'game', 'whole', 'championship', 'usually', 'stuff', 'gaggy', 'sports', 'dramas', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'thrown', 'mix', 'bound', 'be', 'full', 'laughs', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'certainly', 'funny', 'mostly', 'popular', 'SNL', 'alumnus.As', 'Phil', 'wimpy', 'soccer', 'dad', 'Ferrell', 'being', 'inept', 'dork', 'usually', 'cast', 'Living', 'years', 'thumb', 'abrasive', 'father', 'Buck', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Phil', 'developed', 'quasi-hippie', 'peace-loving', 'mentality', 'unexpectedly', 'conscripted', 'be', 'coach', 'last-place', 'Tigers', 'dad', 'champion', 'Gladiators.Being', 'coach', 'go', 'completely', 'non-aggressive', 'personality', 'Phil', 'soon', 'head', 'simply', 'trying', 'get', 'kids', 'practice.In', 'order', 'add', 'family', 'tension', 'whole', 'mess', 'completely', 'nonsensical', 'way', 'Phil', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'same', 'age', 'own', 'son', 'two', 'boys', 'play', 'respective', 'father', 'team', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'confusing', 'family', 'setups', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'kind', 'movie.To', 'aid', 'Phil', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'training', 'team', 'misfits', 'help', 'Mike', 'Ditka', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'Buck', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'who', 'jumps', 'chance', 'best', 'Ditka', 'more', 'personality', 'real', 'actor', 'toughness', 'good', 'contrast', 'Phil', 'wimpiness.The', 'movie', 'classic', 'Ferrell', 'humor', 'only', 'really', 'funny', 'when', 'running', 'about', 'acting', 'lunatic', 'quite', 'good', 'Phil', 'gradually', 'sense', 'fun', 'sport', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'winning', 'as', 'well', 'addicted', 'coffee', 'simply', 'good', 'indicator', 'comedies', 'film', 'managed', 'have', 'funny', 'trailer', 'giving', 'away', 'good', 'joke', 'had', 'again', 'primarily', 'thanks', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'incredible', 'improvisational', 'abilities', 'seemed', 'was', 'always', 'saying', 'doing', 'something', 'worthy', 'laugh', 'Kicking', 'Screaming', 'may', 'be', 'silly', 'comedy', 'strong', 'commentary', 'disturbing', 'trend', 'parents', 'become', 'far', 'too', 'involved', 'kid', 'sports', 'teams', 'Ferrell', 'performance', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'should', 'serve', 'testament', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'over-enthused', 'parents.Despite', 'blandly', 'predictable', 'winning', ""n't"", 'everything', 'moral', 'film', 'remain', 'fun', 'still', 'get', 'message', 'beating', 'audience', 'head']",N/A

I think at points it will appeal to the Will Farrell fans, which I consider myself to be. There's enough of Ferrell's zaniness in the film to entertain you, but, as usual, he goes a bit over-the-top and this might grate on your nerves. I think Ferrell can really carry a film with his antics, though, so I guess I'm a little partial to his films. The plot of the film, while passable, is very formulaic in its underdog overcomes bully and main character learns his lesson in a rushed, trite, predictable way.

Katsaros,"[0, 0]","Will Ferrell now one of the hottest stars in Hollywood is directed by Jesse Dylan who has experience in comedy after directing American Wedding.This is a nice family film to pass your time and laugh with your kids or even just all by yourself.And on a trivia note Jesse Dylan is the son of Bob Dylan.The film tells the story of Phil (Will Ferrell)and how his father has pressured him all his life since he was a infant to be athletically capable person while having no talent at all.While he gets a family on his own his relationship with his father has not been going well when his father trades his son to a another soccer team The Tigers instead of keeping him in the one he coaches The Gladiators.As Phil gets mad about it.Situation brings it for Phil to coach his sons team.Being the worst team in the league with the players being a bunch of misfits,Phil has to take as his assistant coach Mike Ditka the Superbowl coach himself.He and Phil embark on a journey to take down Phil's dad for good.With very funny results in the outcome.This film is made for kids and their families.This a funny film.Will Ferrell showing film after film that he is star to stay.A greatly talented comedian and SNL veteran is quite good in the film.He acts beside the great Robert Duvall in a very good manner and to the Football Hall A Famer Mike Ditka.Mike Ditka in his first acting part does a great job.He is serious and funny when he needs and great addition to the film.Film is well hearted with overall theme of father and father figures and trying win your fathers love and respect.Phil who never had a good relationship with his father is always trying to get his respect.Instead with Ditka he gives it automatically respect.Also besides being a comedy and a family film.Its a sports film.Its soccer movie.The soccer in the film is pretty good.Its realistic and fun.Its not sloppy.A lot of films make the sports sections pretty sloppy and ruins the mood of the film.Like in the film the two Italian kids playing soccer.They look really cool makimg some amazing soccer moves.I mean this is no great sports film.But it's a better and a more serious film than some other films that don't take themselves seriously and lose the purpose of the film in the end.This film knows what it is about and what to show the audience a good time.So when there done with the film they can turn off the DVD with a smile.The is a fun film and worth a look.Cool extras on the DVD like outtakes and behind the scenes makes this DVD a nice little package for the whole family.So watch

Sometimes a 'simple' movie can be colorful enough, and entertaining enough, without having to be great or artsy. 'Kicking and Screaming' was very formulaic. I actually found myself predicting each step and outcome as the plot unfolded--- the adult abused child, his dad, and his son, and the three generations colliding. The re-play of the overbearing father thing, the adult man vowing to never be like his father, but then getting accidentally caught up in the same dynamic himself. then the sports movie redemption, etc., etc.It sounds like a clich?, and it is--- but, oddly, I found myself more surprised than annoyed as each clich? denouement surfaced. I kept thinking, as the clich? loomed--- 'Nahhhh... they wouldn't do that. There must be some slick tricky twist coming up.' Nope. No twists, no tricks--- all the clich?s play through exactly like you expected them to. But there was a certain courage and honesty about that, which I greatly admired. They had a simple. straight-forward, no-nonsense formula story, which they played out exactly as that. It was very honest. Robert Duvall--- always great. Will Ferrell, always funny. Mike Ditka, as an actor--- he's a great football coach.Overall, Kicking & Screaming is a great family sports film that fulfills all comedic expectations.

926433,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B000ADWDE8,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 2]","Kicking and Screaming is about the son of a man who's obsessed with being the best. Will Ferrell plays the son and Robert Duvall plays the dad. When Ferrell gets the chance to be soccer coach he takes it because his son needs a new coach. He soon finds out that the team is awful. So he brings in his dad's arch enemy and nextdoor neighbor to help him out. He just happens to be Mike Ditka. He helps the team improve but they still aren't winning. Ditka then comes up with idea to bring in two italian kids who work at a  family deli and who happen to be great at soccer. Their dad says that meat comes first but after a lot of begging he gives in and lets them play.They're so good that Ferrell just lets them do all the work and together they start winning. Besides winning going to Ferrell's head, Ditka gets him into drinking coffee to relax him. Ferrell soon gets horribly addicted to coffee though and turns into a mad man. Just like his dad benched him when he was little, he finds himself benching his own son.The movie is nutty and often pretty funny.  Mike Ditka is surprisingly very funny too and him and Ferrell have chemestry. While Duvall is entertaining as well as a mean old man. Ferrell can be overly cruel here though. It's more sad than funny when a grown-man is calling kids names and pushing them hard to the ground. Just like when Adam Sandler beat the crap out of little kids with dodge balls in Billy Madison.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[3, 5]","I'm not sure if anybody noticed but Kicking And Screaming reminds me a lot of a great classic film called The Little Giants and yes that movie is from my generation, I was 6 and never stopped watching it. My point is that this film is really like the little giants for the new generation of kids. You see a lot of actors who are getting older like Eddie Murphy but in this case Will Ferrell that are realizing that they want to put out films that kids can enjoy. I really don't think Will was intending a bunch of couples and grown people coming to see this movie with no kids in hand. The film borrows the concept of little giants except it's Father's team competing against the underdog son's team and its soccer.Though this movie didn't reach the greatness of little giants it may be this generation's classic. It's a very enjoyable film even if you are a soccer coach or you enjoy soccer. I think all that really matters is if this movie is safe for your child to watch and will it make them laugh and keep them occupied, trust me it will. The soccer action is very powerful but most of the highlight plays are from the very talented children from Italy will recruited to make his bad team better. Will does a great job and so does Mike Ditka who added some heat to the mix. I wrote this review to let parents know that it's a great family film that will give a lot of laughs, drop a few jaws after seeing how amazing some of the kids are, and give the kids something to do other than bug you.

Hinton ""avid reader""","[4, 6]","Kicking and Screaming is another underdog sports story with the requisite funny guy who has to help the losing team become winners.  In this movie, the funny guy is played by Will Ferrell and the losing team hits close to home because his son is a member.All of his life Phil Weston (Ferrell) lived in the shadow of his father's sports aspirations.  He was clumsy, uncoordinated and never really succeeded at any of the sports he tried; Phil's father, Buck Weston ""King of Sporting Goods,"" has always been disappointed in his son's athletic prowess and the two have a running air of competition throughout their lives.  When Phil gets engaged, his father does too. When Phil's son is born, the same day he gets a little brother. All of this leads up to Buck coaching a little league soccer team that both boys participate in.  However, Phil's son, true to form, is benched most of the time and eventually traded to a rival team where Phil becomes the coach. With the help of a caffeine addiction, soccer DVDs, and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, Phil does everything in his power to try to beat his father's team in the championships.This movie is like so many other underdog sports stories like The Benchwarmers, Dodgeball, and Ladybugs, but fun nonetheless. The deleted scenes and outtakes are also not to be missed.

The apples don't fall far from the tree when both father and son have boys the same age: Phil's son Sam (Dylan McLaughlin) is a thoughtful unathletic child, while Buck's son Bucky (Josh Hutcherson) is driven to win like his father. When Phil ends up coaching Sam's last-place soccer team the Tigers in the same league as Buck and Bucky's team, the Gladiators, the father/son competition is on as never before. And who better to challenge Buck's team than his equally competitive neighbor, football Hall of Famer Coach Mike Ditka?According the its writers Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick, ""Kicking and Screaming"" was inspired by the ubiquity of children's soccer clubs in the United States these days and the parents who take the game too seriously. That's certainly fertile ground for comedy. Where I live, those parents are unaffectionately referred to as the ""soccer mafia"" for their relentless and sometimes underhanded crusades to turn every square inch of parkland into a soccer field. It's already satire; no writers required. But ""Kicking and Screaming"" does little to exploit that angle. This is a one-joke film, and that joke is a couple of grown men acting out a lifelong rivalry through a bunch of kids. The kids are cute and quirky. Young soccer phenoms Francesco Liotti and Alessandro Ruggiero are impressive as the film's Italian kids Gian Piero and Massimo. But the interminable father-son rivalry wears thin. I was left with the feeling that there is about an hour's worth of material in this hour-and-a-half film. It gets dull fast.The DVD (Universal 2005): Bonus features include 11 deleted scenes, outtakes (8  minutes), 3 alternate takes (5  minutes), and 3 featurettes.

""From Rome to Hollywood"" (9 minutes) is about finding the 2 young soccer players to play ""the Italians"" in the movie, their trip to Los Angeles, and their experiences making the movie. Includes interviews with the kids Francesco Liotti and Alessandro Ruggiero. ""Behind the Net: The Making of Kicking and Screaming"" (12  minutes) features interviews with  director Jesse Dylan, writers Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick, and the cast  in which they talk about each other and occasionally about making the movie.

It has a few funny moments, but not enough to justify spending 1 1/2 hours of your life on this film.First of all, Robert Duvall plays his role perfectly.  He should have been the focus of the film.  I can't think of better casting than him for this role.  He is one of the finest actors of our time and he shows his versatility in this film.The problem is the the writing and the character played by Will Farrell.  Instead of making him funny with a serious side, which would have drawn our interest, they make him absurd and ridiculous.  Although I like Will Ferrell, he has nothing to work with here.

926453,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000ADWDE8,RMurray847,"[0, 3]","This isn't exactly a great movie, but it pretty much delivers what the trailer's promise.  Will Ferrell plays a mild-mannered dad who volunteers to coach his son's soccer team (because no one else will) and he evolves from a milquetoast into a raving maniac, encouraging his young misfits to maim and mutilate the opponents.  He learns valuable lessons by the end, and everything works out more or less like all sports / kids movies.There are some good laughs to be had.  A trip to a butcher shop is quite memorable.  Some of the kids are fun.  There is a lesbian couple who have adopted a very small Oriental child.  They inform the coach that their son is ""shy"" and even give Ferrell a book called ""My Child is Shy"" to read over.  Turns out the kid is NOT shy...but his parents are oblivious...their kid MUST be shy!!  That's a pretty subtle joke for such an unsubtle film.Ferrell's motivations center around his strained relationship with his dad (Robert  Duval, coasting and cashing in a good paycheck), a super-driven alpha-male coach who revels in trashing the athletic (and non-athletic) accomplishments and efforts of his oldest son.  (Duvall has a young son from his second, young wife...the kid is the same age as Ferrell's boy, and that's kinda a funny premise...and an excuse for Duval to be a coach).Mike Ditka plays himself in the movie, and he's in a lot of it.  Ditka is not bad at all, but there's something about this real life person being a character in a farcical fiction that begins to become a bit silly.  He's too much of a good thing...although he's the person who introduces Ferrell to coffee...the ""drug"" that causes much of Ferrell's personality change.Is the movie worth seeing?  I say ""yes,"" because of Will Ferrell.  The man is adept at playing an ordinary, likeable, plain-looking guy who is right on the edge of totally losing his cool, his sanity and his dignity.  It's the kind of part that Eddie Murphy plays in stuff like DADDY DAY CARE or like Steve Martin in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN.  But whereas those two fine actors play nice people through and through...even when flustered they are nice, Ferrell plays a nice guy with the ability to become decidedly NOT NICE!  He has an edge, a glimmer of desperation that elevates the film a little above the ordinary.  I believe it's this edge that even makes him interesting in stuff like ELF.  There's something about him that's just not quite ""right.""  I believe that someday, if Ferrell cares to try, he would be quite capable of tackling a serious role and giving a convincing performance.  Not a romantic lead, maybe, but maybe a troubled man (a la Tim Robbins in MYSTIC RIVER) or even something like Adam Sandler tried in PUNCH DRUNK LOVE.Anyway, as far as KICKING AND SCREAMING goes, I would recommend checking it out, and I think it's okay for kids age 11 or older.

He survived the Saturday Night Live experience intact and has gone on to perfect a comic delivery in movies as odd and memorable as any in recent years. Unlike most other SNL success stories, Ferrell is a consistent master at improvising small nonsensical lines. Take a look at some of the extras on his dvds and you'll see what I mean.Even if Ferrell, like Bill Murray, moves on to movies that are only funny to adults, he will always be remembered as one of movies' greatest goofballs. Kicking and Screaming (2005) isn't a great movie, but it's another chance to see a master in his prime. Consider how short a run goofball giant Jim Carrey had.  He struck gold with Ace Ventura (1993), followed that nicely with Dumb & Dumber (1994), but by the time he appeared in Ace Ventura II (1995) and The Cable Guy (1996), it was clear his glory days were over and he'd better start picking projects more carefully. Ferrell struck gold in Old School (2003), followed that nicely with Elf (2003), continued the weird adventure by scripting and acting in the movie Anchorman (2004), and only lets us down in a minor way by hamming it up now in a movie made for children.He may not be Lenny Bruce, W.C.

He has some great co-stars, namely Robert Duvall and Mike Ditka, who carries a great presence on the screen.  The premise revolves around a meek guy (Ferrell) and his cartoonishly competitive relationship with his own father (Duvall), who coaches his son's soccer team.  Gramps decides to trade his untalented grandson to another team - the worst in the league.  Through a series of wacky events, Ferrell becomes the coach of the rag tag team, a Bad News Bears knock-off with less charm and humor.  Other than Ferrell's screen son, the only other kid with much charisma is a pint size Asian boy whose character is named Byon Sun.  As a gag that seems to be meant to save the movie from itself, Ditka(who in the film is Duvall's neighbor band rival) becomes Ferrell's assistant coach.  Hilarity ensues, and the movie plods to its predictable conclusion.Ditka's performance is actually the best thing to be seen here, with Ferrell trying hard but not getting many laughs.

In this awkward movie, Will Ferrell play a father who is stunngingly, amazingly clueless about the impact of this juvenile behavior on his wife and children.The whole caffeine schtick seems out of place and force, and a coach running out onto the field to push a child down dragged this movie to new lows. Ferrell's character is SO clueless that his 'transformation' back to nice guy at the end of the movie seems completely strategic--designed only to bring the movie to happy ending.The other talent in this movie was completely wasted, most notably Robert Duvall and Kate Walsh. They both worked hard to save it, but the movie conspires against them. Duvall seemed bored with his lines.
