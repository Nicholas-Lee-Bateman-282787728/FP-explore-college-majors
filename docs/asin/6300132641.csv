This is a true sad tragic story that will make you think and will leave it's mark on you. Rarely do movies portray the reality of life and even more rare is that it is in animated form. By all means see this movie, it's bad enough that it has been thrown into obscurity by the delusional ""everything is fine"" public and that disney can only make animated features.",5,How did this get made?

I give extreme props to the guy who made both these movies because he wasn't afraid to make dark animations. The story follows Rauph and Snitter who are dogs escaping from an animal research lab. In this lab they do some of the cruelist and most disturbing things to these animals. One of them I didn't pick up on until later was Scroudingers test (I think that's what it's called) which is done with monkeys. Google it. I don't want to give away too much, but this in my opinion is way, way darker than Watership down and the ending will pull at your heartstrings. The thing that disturbed me the most was Snitter. I don't know what they did to him in that lab but it really ****ed him up to the point of skitzo. I really felt sorry for him. The reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it suffers from a problem that wasn't too bad in Watership down...the audio. The audio was really strange. The sound and music was way louder than the character voices and I often strained to hear what they were saying.

196157,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,6300132641,Brian Markowski,"[29, 30]","It's easy to look at the cover of the movie ""Plague Dogs"" and then call the kids into the living room for an enjoyable Sunday matinee. There is a deceptive nature to the beautiful hand drawn animation of cute little animals that harkens back to the golden age of Disney animation. This would be a mistake however for it's that very deceptive quality to ""Plague Dogs"" that makes this film such a treat for adults and a rather disturbing nightmare for children.Like it's predecessor ""Watership Down"" (another Richard Adams book made into an animated feature by director Martin Rosen), ""Plague Dogs"" is a very adult tale about animals in jeopardy. In ""Watership..."" it was a small group of rabbits in search of a safe home. ""Plague Dogs"" is the story of two dogs who escape from a testing laboratory. Together they are desperate to find safety and a life free of abuse and pain. The smaller dog (Snitter) having just had brain surgery, is a smart but tortured animal. Rowf, is a dog mentally and physically beaten by repeated drownings.  Together they search for peace, but peace does not come easily on an empty stomach and the many pastures of sheep are too tempting for the two dogs to pass up. As sheep carcasses begin to pile up local farmers begin to make the connection that the testing laboratory may have had something to do with the two wild dogs that are roaming their land. When it's discovered that the laboratory was working with Bubonic plague, the dogs are marked for death.Ultimately ""Plague Dogs"" is an adventure tale; however, director Martin Rosen uses the bleak storyline to propel a theme of hopelessness. Snitter and Rowf and undesirables, cast out by bad luck and bad timing. The society that they find themselves in is unable to fully understanding their situation and their destruction is a simply seen as a more effective way of dealing with them.  The ending in particular has our two furry antagonists in questionable straights.Such a film would not play well today, nor did it play that well in this country  25 years ago. It asks too many questions, pushes too many cringe inducing buttons, and often doesn't wait for the passive viewer to catch up. I can't think of one reason why or how a movie like this got made, but it's our great fortune it did.

196159,A19JYLHD94K94D,6300132641,Itamar Katz,"[9, 9]","Richard Adams's novel 'The Plague Dogs' always stood in the shadow of his superior masterpiece - the classic 'Watership Down'. The same goes for the animated films, both of them directed by Martin Rosen. The animated version of The Plague Dogs, released four years after the acclaimed Watership Down, never quite achieved the kind of success its predecessor had; not because it wasn't as good, but because of pretty much the same reasons for the novel's limited success. While Watership Down hid violence and severe social-political criticism behind a disguise of a children's tale, The Plague Dogs is much more in-your-face, much less subtle, and makes no attempts to hide itself behind pretty words. The Plague Dogs is a tragic tale that is mercilessly critical toward modern society, taking a strict stand on the subject of cruelty to animals. The idea of an animated film strictly for adults was as difficult to swallow twenty years ago as the idea of a novel for adults told from an animal's point of view. Therefore, movie-goers didn't quite know what to make of the film; it didn't seem right for an adult to go watch an animated film about animals - and a parent who takes his little child to this film would face an even bigger problem of explaining to them why the bad people do such horrible things to the poor dogs.Fortunately, today we know that animation isn't just for kids, and we can fully appreciate this masterpiece. The story is that of two laboratory dogs, voiced brilliantly by John Hurt and Christopher Benjamin, who escape from their cages and from the lab seeking the freedom of the outside world, and finding out that surviving in the wilderness isn't as easy as that. The scientists have reason to believe that the dogs contacted a bubonic plague virus during their escape, and so the two must run for their lives and fight for survival. Most of the film is from the dogs' point of view (they are later joined by a fox, voiced by James Bolam, who helps them survive in the wild, not without his own reasons). On the other hand we also hear the humans' conversations, yet we never see a human being's face; Rosen doesn't allow us to sympathize or identify with any of the human characters. The animals are clearly the more humane here, and that's the basis of what Rosen and Adams say here.Be warned - don't let the animation fool you, this is not an easy watch. The violence in The Plague Dogs is more explicit than in most live action films, and the message it bears about human beings as a whole is difficult to swallow. John Hurt's performance as Snitter, alternately funny and sad, dominates the film, and it makes for one of the most beautiful and round animated characters ever seen on film. The story, especially that of Snitter's, is incredibly sad and touching, and is more powerful emotionally than any other animated feature I've seen. A highly recommended film, and not just for animation enthusiasts.",5,A tragic and moving tale,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,2940,"['Richard', 'Adams', 'novel', ""'The"", 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'always', 'stood', 'shadow', 'superior', 'masterpiece', 'classic', 'Down', 'same', 'animated', 'films', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Rosen', 'animated', 'version', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'released', 'four', 'years', 'acclaimed', 'Watership', 'Down', 'never', 'quite', 'achieved', 'kind', 'success', 'predecessor', 'had', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'reasons', 'novel', 'limited', 'success', 'Watership', 'Down', 'hid', 'violence', 'severe', 'social-political', 'criticism', 'disguise', 'children', 'tale', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'much', 'more', 'in-your-face', 'much', 'less', 'subtle', 'attempts', 'hide', 'pretty', 'words', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'tragic', 'tale', 'mercilessly', 'critical', 'modern', 'society', 'taking', 'strict', 'stand', 'subject', 'cruelty', 'animals', 'idea', 'animated', 'film', 'strictly', 'adults', 'was', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'idea', 'novel', 'adults', 'told', 'animal', 'point', 'view', 'Therefore', 'movie-goers', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'adult', 'go', 'watch', 'animated', 'film', 'animals', 'parent', 'who', 'little', 'child', 'film', 'would', 'face', 'even', 'bigger', 'problem', 'explaining', 'why', 'bad', 'people', 'do', 'such', 'horrible', 'things', 'poor', 'dogs.Fortunately', 'today', 'know', 'animation', ""n't"", 'just', 'kids', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'masterpiece', 'story', 'two', 'laboratory', 'dogs', 'voiced', 'brilliantly', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Christopher', 'Benjamin', 'who', 'escape', 'cages', 'lab', 'seeking', 'freedom', 'outside', 'world', 'finding', 'out', 'surviving', 'wilderness', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'scientists', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'dogs', 'contacted', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'virus', 'escape', 'so', 'two', 'must', 'run', 'lives', 'fight', 'survival', 'Most', 'film', 'dogs', 'point', 'view', 'are', 'later', 'joined', 'fox', 'voiced', 'James', 'Bolam', 'who', 'survive', 'wild', 'not', 'own', 'reasons', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'hear', 'humans', 'conversations', 'yet', 'never', 'see', 'human', 'being', 'face', 'Rosen', ""n't"", 'allow', 'sympathize', 'identify', 'human', 'characters', 'animals', 'are', 'clearly', 'more', 'humane', 'here', 'basis', 'what', 'Rosen', 'Adams', 'say', 'here.Be', 'warned', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'animation', 'fool', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'violence', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'more', 'explicit', 'most', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'message', 'human', 'beings', 'whole', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'John', 'Hurt', 'performance', 'Snitter', 'alternately', 'funny', 'sad', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'round', 'animated', 'characters', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'story', 'especially', 'Snitter', 'incredibly', 'sad', 'touching', 'more', 'powerful', 'emotionally', 'other', 'animated', 'feature', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'highly', 'recommended', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'animation', 'enthusiasts']",Plague Dogs VHS
196160,A3DU3WOGW4A9QH,6300132641,"jammer ""jammmer""","[12, 12]","""Plague Dogs"", based on Richard Adams' (Watership Down, Shardik) 1977 novel, is among the most substantive offerings in animation films.  Snitter (terrier), and Rowf (Black Lab) escape from an animal research lab conducting ""experiments"" on dogs, monkeys, rabbits and others, including: Bubonic Plague, experimental brain surgery, sensory deprivation, and (often-fatal) recovery-from-drowning.  Encountered on the run, a worldly-wise fox (The Tod) helps Snitter and Rowf evade re-capture and survive in the wild while seeking a vaguely understood, permanent safe haven.The animation is fine, similar to Watership Down's.  But it is the novel's substance and attendant characterizations that underlie the film: a brutal perspective, from that of two anthropomorphized dogs and a fox, about survival needs; animal researchers' clinical depravity; anthropocentricity; and a welter of CYA political and press mendacities.  At its core is a fascinating character study:  that of poor Snitter's brain surgery-induced delirious yet moving confusions and imaginings; Rowf's ever-fatalistic, aggressive, no-nonsense realism; and the Tod's sympathetic opportunism.At 150,000 words, the novel (Knopf, 1978, 1st American hardbound edition) also has a bonus: 20-plus pages of carefully-drawn Wainwright illustrations (13 full-page, eight being route maps), plus a two-page frontispiece.  While a quarter of the novel centers on various humans and their conversations, the film cleverly maintains interest by keeping the focus on Snitter, Rowf and the Tod, pertinent human conversations largely presented as voice-overs. But though the film carefully replicates Snitter's and Rowf's trek and manages to convey some personality subtleties, one needs the novel's far richer prose (Adams' prose rivaling Tolkien's) for a rewardingly deeper understanding of the characters and out-of-context scenes depicted.Though intriguingly four minutes short of the original's reported run-time, Australian (PAL region 4) sources offer a 99-minute ""extended release"" DVD viewable in the US with a PAL-enabled system and region-free player.  This version, reportedly made from an only-surviving copy, has non-re-mastered but adequate picture-sound quality.  Also included is an 82-minute amputated re-mastered version.  Struggling for film release, its producers obviously encountered lowest-common-denominator marketing mentalities, shunning of graphic depictions, script change demands appeasing the pro-fox-hunting lobby, and having to manufacture several thrills.  Two notable changes from the novel concern the fates of the Tod, and of Snitter/Rowf.  Even ignoring detrimental changes, this reviewer awards just four stars for this 80 percent of the original film.Several reviewers caution prospective buyers to deny young children seeing this film.  Would such folks also shield children from Oliver Twist, The Yearling, Race of the Swift, Cooper's Leather Stocking tales, or Felix Salten's Bambi?  When this reviewer was in grade-school over fifty years since, it was customary to have such books read by the teacher, generally a chapter after lunch; or on one's own at home!  Were that Plague Dogs had been available!  Presumably no permanent damage resulted to this reviewer from such dangerous childhood adventures, though some might disagree!  And do you suppose the film's missing four minutes were to accommodate the novel's ending, hinted in the closing scene?",4,Hummm.

196162,A2ZWTFZRNQW7D5,6300132641,Jeremy Storly,"[4, 4]","_The Plague Dogs_ by Richard Adams has long been one of my favorite books.  For this reason, I have avoided seeing Martin Rosen's adaptation until now; I was afraid I would be deeply disappointed, that the film would somehow tarnish my relationship with the book.  Although the film adaptation falls short in places, and there are slight variations in plot (notably, in the last five minutes of the film), overall it is an exceptional work that stays true to the heart of the book.Fortunately, I have not seen the entire movie in its original format.  If I had, I may be disappointed.  Having researched the changes that were made, I do see how Martin Rosen's original rendition would have been stronger.  However, those new to the film will not be disappointed.Also, there seems to be a debate about the ending of the film vs. that of the novel.  Although completely different, both endings are equally as strong and poignant.  Both the book and the film will elicit an emotional response from all except the coldest of hearts.The voice actors in the film are excellent.  John Hurt, who did the voice of Hazel in _Watership Down_, appropriately performs as Snitter.  Christopher Benjamin excels as Rowf.  We are even briefly treated to the voice of Patrick Stewart in a very small role.This film falls short in one area: length.  It is impossible in 87, or even 99 minutes to thoroughly develop the plot of the novel.  The absence of Digby Driver, for example, eliminates a fascinating and ironic subplot from the film.

The animation is sharper and more complex and the story translates well to the screen. It's a bittersweet and depressing tale, but significant for all. Just like ""Watership Down,"" ""Plague Dogs"" is not a kid's movie. Although it might not be as viscerally graphic as ""Watership Down"" it's probably the more disturbing film with some of its themes, imagery, and implications. It is a very mature cartoon. If you liked the book you will be happy.MY COMPLAINT is that the full British cut seems to be unavailable in the United States. While this American edit does not cut out enough to screw up the storyline, it does throw off some of the character development and the pacing.

196166,A2VF25F0XZHXMW,6300132641,London Fog,"[5, 5]","My first encounter with The Plague Dogs was probably a little too young... I was around ten or twelve, and some genius at Blockbuster Video (remember them?) had stuck this in with all the animated kids movies. I bought it on VHS and can still vividly recall watching it in a state of something akin to shock. Not because it graphically depicted the realities of a vivisection lab and the the consequences it had for Snitter, although I will say that the depictions of his deteriorating mental state is something that remained with me for many, many years. And not even because of the two dogs die - and of exhaustion, at that - but because I KNEW, young as I was, that while the story itself was fiction, animal testing was not.And so it was one of those movies that strikes such a chord, you don't know whether it is phenomenally brilliant or the most terrible thing you've ever laid eyes on. Just the thought of it certainly made me physically ill for a long time afterwards.Recently, I was going through some old boxes in the garage and came across my $5 VHS tape from Blockbuster. I popped it into my antiquated old VCR, and the moment the opening credits came up, I could not stop trembling. After having only seen this once, and a good twenty years ago at that, it appears I hadn't forgot a second of this movie. And that was worse than my first time viewing, because now I knew exactly how it would end. Hopeless. There were a few scenes where I had to either stop watching for a moment or fast forward a bit, and I honestly don't know how I made it through this as a kid. Maybe it was so much worse now since after having been breeding dogs for several years, and been involved in the politics of the dog world, I see this movie less as personification and more as a truth we sweep under the rug or worse, trivialize.To be perfectly honest, I was getting more than a little queasy about 3/4 of the way through and finally had to shut it off. The Plague Dogs transcends the politics of animal rights and approaches a terrible subject in a humane manner that forces you to confront these realities. After my second time watching, after having been furious for so many years that some moron stuck this in the family section, I've come to the conclusion that The Plague Dogs IS a children's movie, after all, and am grateful to whomever left it there (on purpose, I suspect) because I think it did go a fair way in turning my stomach to these sorts of practices and forcing me to think. I'd never subject a young child to such disturbing subject matter, but older, more mature children should be given the opportunity to watch this, and when I do have children, I think they will be better, more compassionate human beings for having seen it.",5,One Adult Movie Children Should Watch,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,2746,"['first', 'encounter', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'was', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'young', 'was', 'around', 'ten', 'twelve', 'genius', 'Blockbuster', 'Video', 'remember', 'had', 'stuck', 'animated', 'kids', 'movies', 'bought', 'VHS', 'can', 'still', 'vividly', 'recall', 'watching', 'state', 'something', 'akin', 'shock', 'Not', 'graphically', 'depicted', 'realities', 'vivisection', 'lab', 'consequences', 'had', 'Snitter', 'will', 'say', 'depictions', 'deteriorating', 'mental', 'state', 'something', 'remained', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'not', 'even', 'two', 'dogs', 'die', 'exhaustion', 'KNEW', 'young', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'fiction', 'animal', 'testing', 'was', 'not.And', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'strikes', 'chord', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'phenomenally', 'brilliant', 'most', 'terrible', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'laid', 'eyes', 'Just', 'thought', 'certainly', 'made', 'physically', 'ill', 'long', 'time', 'afterwards.Recently', 'was', 'going', 'old', 'boxes', 'garage', 'came', '5', 'VHS', 'tape', 'Blockbuster', 'popped', 'antiquated', 'old', 'VCR', 'moment', 'opening', 'credits', 'came', 'up', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'trembling', 'having', 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'good', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'had', ""n't"", 'forgot', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'worse', 'first', 'time', 'viewing', 'now', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'Hopeless', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'had', 'stop', 'watching', 'moment', 'fast', 'forward', 'bit', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'made', 'through', 'kid', 'Maybe', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'worse', 'now', 'having', 'been', 'breeding', 'dogs', 'several', 'years', 'been', 'involved', 'politics', 'dog', 'world', 'see', 'movie', 'personification', 'more', 'truth', 'sweep', 'rug', 'worse', 'trivialize.To', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'was', 'getting', 'more', 'little', 'queasy', '3/4', 'way', 'finally', 'had', 'shut', 'off', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'politics', 'animal', 'rights', 'terrible', 'subject', 'humane', 'manner', 'forces', 'confront', 'realities', 'second', 'time', 'watching', 'having', 'been', 'furious', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'moron', 'stuck', 'family', 'section', ""'ve"", 'come', 'conclusion', 'Plague', 'Dogs', 'children', 'movie', 'am', 'grateful', 'whomever', 'left', 'purpose', 'suspect', 'think', 'did', 'go', 'fair', 'way', 'turning', 'stomach', 'sorts', 'practices', 'forcing', 'think', ""'d"", 'never', 'subject', 'young', 'child', 'such', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'matter', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'when', 'do', 'have', 'children', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'compassionate', 'human', 'beings', 'having', 'seen']",Plague Dogs VHS

196168,A34XEANB17WDE3,6300132641,M. D. Smart,"[27, 27]","I don't really have a lot to add about the film itself that the other reviewers haven't already said; this is a dark, distressing, relentlessly grim and harrowing film about two dogs on the run from an animal research laboratory. It has a somewhat slow pace at times, and much of the animation is crude by today's standards, but it has tons of character. It's not exactly a pleasant experience but it has great power and a worthwhile message. Just to make it clear (if it isn't already), this is mature material only suitable for older teens and adults.I actually just wanted to address a couple of points in a previous review (possible spoilers coming). The original film, released in the UK in 1982, was 1 hour 42 minutes - this is the full, unedited version which can ONLY be found on the Australian DVD release (the quality isn't great, but at least you're getting to see the whole film). The difference in running time (99 mins on DVD as against 102 mins in theaters) is simply down to the fact that films run slightly faster on VHS and DVD than they do on the big screen; ALL films are approximately 3 - 4% shorter when transfered to home entertainment formats.When it came time to release the film in the USA, director Martin Rosen had great difficulty finding a distributor willing to take it on. That shouldn't come as too much of a surprise; the film is far too disturbing for kids or families, and adults are likely to dismiss an animated  feature with talking animals as kids' stuff - so who exactly would pay to see this movie? In an effort to placate the distributors, Rosen was forced to cut 17 minutes from the film's running time. Some of the cuts were simply made to speed up the pace, and others were made to remove some of the more unpleasant scenes (most notably the sight of a human corpse which the starving, desperate dogs have partially eaten). Needless to say, these cuts did little to lighten the film's grim tone, and it only ever received a brief and extremely limited run at a few US theaters. Unfortunately, it is this shorter version that has been used for most of the recent DVD releases; as I mentioned before, only the Australian edition has both versions included.There were some changes to the plot in the transfer from novel to screen. The somewhat forced but nevertheless welcome happy ending in the book was removed, to make the film a more powerful anti-vivisection statement. Also the fate of the fox, or The Tod as he is known, was changed; in the book he falls victim to a hunt, whereas in the film he sacrifices himself to a pack of army hounds as a distraction, allowing the two titular dogs to escape (temporarily) on a train. This was NOT changed due to any pressure from pro-hunting groups; neither Richard Admas or his admirers would have tolerated such a move. I imagine it was changed to allow the Tod's death to play a more important part in driving the plot forward, and to show us the wily fox was a noble fellow in the end.",5,Worth seeking out the Australian version,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2979,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'lot', 'add', 'film', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'said', 'dark', 'distressing', 'relentlessly', 'grim', 'harrowing', 'film', 'two', 'dogs', 'run', 'animal', 'research', 'laboratory', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'pace', 'times', 'much', 'animation', 'crude', 'today', 'standards', 'tons', 'character', 'not', 'exactly', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'great', 'power', 'worthwhile', 'message', 'Just', 'make', 'clear', ""n't"", 'already', 'mature', 'material', 'only', 'suitable', 'older', 'teens', 'adults.I', 'actually', 'just', 'wanted', 'address', 'couple', 'points', 'previous', 'review', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'coming', 'original', 'film', 'released', 'UK', '1982', 'was', '1', 'hour', '42', 'minutes', 'full', 'unedited', 'version', 'can', 'ONLY', 'be', 'found', 'Australian', 'DVD', 'release', 'quality', ""n't"", 'great', 'least', ""'re"", 'getting', 'see', 'whole', 'film', 'difference', 'running', 'time', '99', 'mins', 'DVD', '102', 'mins', 'theaters', 'simply', 'down', 'fact', 'films', 'run', 'slightly', 'faster', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'do', 'big', 'screen', 'ALL', 'films', 'are', 'approximately', '3', '4', '%', 'shorter', 'when', 'transfered', 'home', 'entertainment', 'formats.When', 'came', 'time', 'release', 'film', 'USA', 'director', 'Martin', 'Rosen', 'had', 'great', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'distributor', 'willing', 'take', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'too', 'much', 'surprise', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'disturbing', 'kids', 'families', 'adults', 'are', 'likely', 'dismiss', 'animated', 'feature', 'talking', 'animals', 'kids', 'stuff', 'so', 'who', 'exactly', 'would', 'pay', 'see', 'movie', 'effort', 'placate', 'distributors', 'Rosen', 'was', 'forced', 'cut', '17', 'minutes', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'cuts', 'were', 'simply', 'made', 'speed', 'up', 'pace', 'others', 'were', 'made', 'remove', 'more', 'unpleasant', 'scenes', 'most', 'notably', 'sight', 'human', 'corpse', 'starving', 'desperate', 'dogs', 'have', 'partially', 'eaten', 'Needless', 'say', 'cuts', 'did', 'little', 'lighten', 'film', 'grim', 'tone', 'only', 'ever', 'received', 'brief', 'extremely', 'limited', 'run', 'few', 'US', 'theaters', 'Unfortunately', 'shorter', 'version', 'been', 'used', 'most', 'recent', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'only', 'Australian', 'edition', 'versions', 'included.There', 'were', 'changes', 'plot', 'transfer', 'novel', 'screen', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'nevertheless', 'welcome', 'happy', 'ending', 'book', 'was', 'removed', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'powerful', 'anti-vivisection', 'statement', 'Also', 'fate', 'fox', 'Tod', 'known', 'was', 'changed', 'book', 'victim', 'hunt', 'whereas', 'film', 'pack', 'army', 'hounds', 'distraction', 'allowing', 'two', 'titular', 'dogs', 'escape', 'temporarily', 'train', 'was', 'NOT', 'changed', 'due', 'pressure', 'pro-hunting', 'groups', 'Richard', 'Admas', 'admirers', 'would', 'have', 'tolerated', 'move', 'imagine', 'was', 'changed', 'allow', 'Tod', 'death', 'play', 'more', 'important', 'part', 'driving', 'plot', 'forward', 'show', 'wily', 'fox', 'was', 'noble', 'fellow', 'end']",Plague Dogs VHS

196171,ATZKPCGDXQVB2,6300132641,Scott A. Schilz,"[55, 56]","This woefully underappreciated animated film was created by the team behind the wonderful Watership Down. The story concerns a pair of dogs, Rowf and Snitter, who escape from an animal-testing lab in the wilds of England and their attempts to survive in a cold and hostile world. Rowf and Snitter traverse the wilds and encounter both a fox named The Tod who trains them in the ways of being wild and humans who are either afraid of them or try to hunt them. The film is excellently animated and touches on themes of friendship, bravery, and animal rights. The ending is very moving and always makes me shed a tear or two.Many talented people lent their skills to this movie. Martin Rosen, also the creator of Watership Down, led a team which took almost two years to painstakingly craft this masterpiece. Among the actors who gave vocal performances for The Plague Dogs are John Hurt, Nigel Hawthorne, and Patrick Stewart as an army major. I was even surprised to see Brad Bird's (creator of The Iron Giant and The Incredibles) name in the credits as an animator!Unfortunately, while the film itself is great, this DVD leaves a little bit to be desired. The movie is presented in its North American edited length of 85 minutes. There is apparently a longer 99-minute cut available on DVD from Australia, but only in PAL video format. The film itself looks in pretty good condition for being almost 25 years old. Other than Scene Selection and Interactive Menus (as if those even count), the DVD is devoid of any special features. Another feature lacking on the DVD that I do miss from my old VHS copy is closed captions or subtitles. I have a little difficulty making out some of the difficult British Isles accents, especially from The Tod and the sheepherding dogs.I highly recommend that fans of adult, drama-oriented animation (and Watership Down fans in particular) check this one out. Despite its barebones DVD presentation, it's a great, powerful film that deserves to be seen.

196173,A2BMDY4WJIDGG7,6300132641,S Tuffnell,"[0, 2]","In my weird curious quest to see disturbing kids films I was draw to one of the most gruelling 'Plague Dogs'. This one begins in an animal lab where dogs are being experimented on and we are immediately greeted with a drowning dog meeting its maker, or does he? The film diverges into many compelling moments but it is very bizarre watching animated dogs talking in a cute way but with a bleak atmosphere. It all seems so unsettling and ominous with morbid music and gore throughout.The scenes are often nightmarish and at times far too strong for children. One of the strongest, and infamous scenes, shows a hunter going after an escaped dog and shooting himself in the face. The scene actually shows the blood pouring out of his face and subsequently dying. We cheer on the actions as the dogs are now free to escape, but the humans as usual are painted in a bad light as the real enemies. This has psychological ramifications that must impact a young child's mind.Not for kids? John Hurt voices one of the dogs, Snitter, and he seems to love these gory animations as he was also voicing a rabbit in Watership Down. Martin Rosen was the main mind behind the film as he was also with Watership Down so he also seems to revel in kids movies with tons of gore. Richard Adams was also responsible for the novle of both this and Watership Down so easily it can be seen that it is a specific type of film. An animation for teens or adults. It could be argued it is not a kids film but the animated talking animals would be a drawcard so how do you police this type of film? I wonder how many kids have been traumatised by these types of films.",3,A plague upon their hides!,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,1639,"['weird', 'curious', 'quest', 'see', 'disturbing', 'kids', 'films', 'was', 'draw', 'one', 'most', 'gruelling', ""'Plague"", 'Dogs', 'one', 'animal', 'lab', 'where', 'dogs', 'are', 'being', 'experimented', 'are', 'immediately', 'greeted', 'drowning', 'dog', 'meeting', 'maker', 'film', 'many', 'compelling', 'moments', 'very', 'bizarre', 'watching', 'animated', 'dogs', 'talking', 'cute', 'way', 'bleak', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'unsettling', 'ominous', 'morbid', 'music', 'gore', 'throughout.The', 'scenes', 'are', 'often', 'nightmarish', 'times', 'far', 'too', 'strong', 'children', 'One', 'strongest', 'infamous', 'scenes', 'hunter', 'going', 'escaped', 'dog', 'shooting', 'face', 'scene', 'actually', 'blood', 'pouring', 'face', 'subsequently', 'dying', 'cheer', 'actions', 'dogs', 'are', 'now', 'free', 'escape', 'humans', 'usual', 'are', 'painted', 'bad', 'light', 'real', 'enemies', 'psychological', 'ramifications', 'must', 'impact', 'young', 'child', 'mind.Not', 'kids', 'John', 'Hurt', 'one', 'dogs', 'Snitter', 'love', 'gory', 'animations', 'was', 'also', 'voicing', 'rabbit', 'Watership', 'Down', 'Martin', 'Rosen', 'was', 'main', 'mind', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'Watership', 'Down', 'so', 'also', 'revel', 'kids', 'movies', 'tons', 'gore', 'Richard', 'Adams', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'novle', 'Watership', 'Down', 'so', 'easily', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'specific', 'type', 'film', 'animation', 'teens', 'adults', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'not', 'kids', 'film', 'animated', 'talking', 'animals', 'would', 'be', 'drawcard', 'how', 'do', 'police', 'type', 'film', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'kids', 'have', 'been', 'traumatised', 'types', 'films']",Plague Dogs VHS

Though this is an animated film, it is not something you should allow a young child to watch since it is a real tear-jerker and has some graphic scenes of animal cruelty. The story is told very well, and you really become attached to the characters, especially if you are a dog owner.
