Man was I missing out!I've played guitar for a long time and have a strong appreciation for real musical talent and ability developed and executed on it. This fella delivers nothing but that! He and his music are both amazing. And what makes it all the more enjoyable to watch is how much fun he has doing it. He really loves playing, is full of energy and seems like a wonderful guy. Still, if you have no concern for that part of the picture, Tommy's music and playing skills are a wonder to hear and see. He makes it look so easy you sometimes think you should be able to do what he's doing. So you pick up your guitar and... land right back in the real world again.Anyway, the DVD picture and sound quality is great! 5.1 surround sound with a crisp, clear digital image. I hope they make more of these with Tommy before he retires (which hopefully won't be for many years!!).God bless you Tommy. You've blessed us with the miracle of your music and personality. I wish you the absolute best.",5,A new fan says- this will rock your socks off!,1233187200,"01 29, 2009",2009,1140,"['just', 'discovered', 'Tommy', 'Emmanuel', 'Tony', 'Enamel', 'people', 'mistakenly', 'call', 'YouTube', 'had', 'idea', 'guy', 'had', 'been', 'around', 'so', 'long', 'Man', 'was', 'missing', ""'ve"", 'played', 'guitar', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'strong', 'appreciation', 'real', 'musical', 'talent', 'ability', 'developed', 'executed', 'fella', 'nothing', 'music', 'are', 'amazing', 'what', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'doing', 'really', 'playing', 'full', 'energy', 'wonderful', 'guy', 'Still', 'have', 'concern', 'part', 'picture', 'Tommy', 'music', 'playing', 'skills', 'are', 'wonder', 'hear', 'see', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'sometimes', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'doing', 'pick', 'up', 'guitar', 'land', 'right', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'again.Anyway', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'crisp', 'clear', 'digital', 'image', 'hope', 'make', 'more', 'Tommy', 'hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'many', 'years', 'bless', 'Tommy', ""'ve"", 'blessed', 'miracle', 'music', 'personality', 'wish', 'absolute', 'best']",N/A

This video was a dissapointment.  He has someone else playing along with him on the harmonica for most songs and that was a big distraction from Tommy's guitar playing.  I get more enjoyment watching clips on YouTube than from this video.  Also, I was looking forward to hearing him play Amazing Grace as he does on YouTube.  Again, a huge disappointment!  I do not recommend wasting your money on this DVD.  Just watch him on YouTube instead.",2,This Video was a Huge Dissapointment,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,564,"['saw', 'Tommy', 'Emmanuel', 'first', 'time', 'Marty', 'Stuart', 'show', 'was', 'fantastic', 'so', 'wanted', 'get', 'one', 'videos', 'video', 'was', 'dissapointment', 'someone', 'else', 'playing', 'along', 'harmonica', 'most', 'songs', 'was', 'big', 'distraction', 'Tommy', 'guitar', 'playing', 'get', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'clips', 'YouTube', 'video', 'Also', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'hearing', 'play', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'YouTube', 'Again', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'wasting', 'money', 'DVD', 'Just', 'watch', 'YouTube', 'instead']",N/A
