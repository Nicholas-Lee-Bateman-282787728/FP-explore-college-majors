In the first ten minutes by these two navel-gazing thirty-somethings having such an existential freakout over the fact that adopting a cat that might live 5 whole years leads them both to such despair about not having become a great dancer or world leader that they both run out and quit their steady jobs.

They decide it's time to make some real changes in their life. You could call it pop existentialism for the youtube generation, but that undersells how hilarious and devastating and thoughtful is this latest creation from artist and filmmaker Miranda July.Held together with narration from ""PawPaw"" the cat, the film follows the efforts of Sophie and Jason to finally accomplish something, to live in the moment now they realize it's slipping them by. They resolve to seize opportunities as they come, to follow destiny wherever it calls them. She gets inspired by a series of youtube videos to create and upload a series of ill-conceived dance routines. He follows up on an ad and befriends an older man selling a used hairdryer. Where else do we find our callings, in an age where to be is to be online? Much of what she says comes across as a deadpan comic routine, acted out on screen, that's both laugh-out-loud funny and utterly depressing to see ourselves in the almost pathetic need to be looked at and liked. When you translate into everyday life the intensity of interest in how many views a video gets or how many ""likes"" a comment online receives, it makes painfully obvious that the existential ideal of living authentically has turned into an obsession with exposure. Seeing important life decisions made with the same casual carelessness with which I sometimes waste away my downtime clicking on this or that link, managed at once to make me smile and evoke a feeling similar to what existentialists called ""despair.""Don't go into it expecting something conventional.

Based on Miranda's other film, I thought this one would cheer her up. ""I heard it has a cat as the film's narrator!"" I pitched to her. You see, she loves cats and I knew she'd want to get out of bed and watch the movie with me if I mentioned it had a cat. I thought the film would be funny and sweet and and uplifting in a quirky, darkly comic way...big mistake. Big big big mistake. So the cat is terminally ill, and it is injured, and it has had a terrible life of loneliness, and it is in a cage the whole film. All that cat wants in the entire world is to be loved. Every time the cat appeared, and talked about how lonely it was, and how it wanted to be loved, my girlfriend started to cry. Well guess what folks? The annoying, unsympathetic hipster main characters never pick the cat up from the shelter and it is KILLED. My girlfriend practically went into hysterics, the tears pouring down her face. Sound like a good time? Are you depressed and want to get pushed over the edge? Want to see a suffering cat get betrayed and die? Then watch these miserable characters and a sad lonely cat who dies for the sins of vacuous hipsters. My girlfriend is still crying in the next room as I write this and the movie has been over for about fifteen minutes. Thanks for a terrible, depressing, lonely loveless cat killing evening.

It tells the story of Sophie and Jason, a morosely synchronized couple in their mid-30s who have decided to adopt a cat.  The waiting period for the animal is one month and they decide to use this time before the commitment as a rebirth of routine and philosophy.  It's an odd film.As I'm getting older, I'm finding that I prefer relaxing cinema.  This is what initially attracted me to The Future and I wasn't disappointed.  But it was also cunningly funny and often eerie.  If you're at all familiar with either actor, I'm sure imagining the level of melancholy their fusion would birth isn't too difficult, but there's something else happening here and it's worth your time.  I wish I had the sort of talent that would let me explain this to you without ruining anything, but the delicate twists offered here would be too easily spoiled.  The humor was unexpected and I'd often be startled also by the dark little corners of this project.And the cast did a great job.  This is my first time seeing Miranda July and I'm enamored with her style.  Blue-eyed and weird, she's a fluid form moving slowly through this film with these random little bursts of muffled energy that I found hypnotic.  (She's like a heavily sedated Zooey Deschanel to me; quirky, a bit strange.)  Hamish Linklater had a similar effect, if not more haggard and sadly worn.  The interaction between these two felt valid.  As for the rest of the cast, they also bowed to the strangeness and contributed beautifully.  Especially the old man.I think the only nagging problem I had with this movie was the cat.  The cat narrates the film here and there but does so with a haggish voice that grated on my nerves immediately.  I know they were going for something bizarre there but it didn't feel that way to me - it just seemed off.  But this was only slight problem for me as the cat didn't pop up that often.If you're looking for something different to do for a couple of hours this is a good start.  There's not much in the way of romance but there is something unsettling about the sort of love written for The Future and, although I'd put a ceiling on how much I'd pay for this disc, I thought it was worth the ride.Thank you for your time.- t",3,All original lyrics.,1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,2282,"['Future', '2011', 'film', 'directed', 'starring', 'Miranda', 'July', 'story', 'Sophie', 'Jason', 'morosely', 'synchronized', 'couple', 'mid-30s', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'adopt', 'cat', 'waiting', 'period', 'animal', 'one', 'month', 'decide', 'use', 'time', 'commitment', 'rebirth', 'routine', 'philosophy', 'odd', 'film.As', ""'m"", 'getting', 'older', ""'m"", 'finding', 'prefer', 'relaxing', 'cinema', 'what', 'initially', 'attracted', 'Future', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'also', 'cunningly', 'funny', 'often', 'eerie', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'actor', ""'m"", 'sure', 'imagining', 'level', 'fusion', 'would', 'birth', ""n't"", 'too', 'difficult', 'something', 'else', 'happening', 'here', 'time', 'wish', 'had', 'sort', 'talent', 'would', 'let', 'explain', 'ruining', 'anything', 'delicate', 'twists', 'offered', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easily', 'spoiled', 'humor', 'was', 'unexpected', ""'d"", 'often', 'be', 'startled', 'also', 'dark', 'little', 'corners', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'Miranda', 'July', ""'m"", 'enamored', 'style', 'Blue-eyed', 'weird', 'fluid', 'form', 'moving', 'slowly', 'film', 'random', 'little', 'bursts', 'muffled', 'energy', 'found', 'hypnotic', 'heavily', 'sedated', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'quirky', 'bit', 'strange', 'Hamish', 'Linklater', 'had', 'similar', 'effect', 'not', 'more', 'haggard', 'sadly', 'worn', 'interaction', 'two', 'felt', 'valid', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'bowed', 'strangeness', 'contributed', 'beautifully', 'Especially', 'old', 'man.I', 'think', 'only', 'nagging', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'cat', 'cat', 'film', 'here', 'there', 'so', 'haggish', 'voice', 'grated', 'nerves', 'immediately', 'know', 'were', 'going', 'something', 'bizarre', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'just', 'seemed', 'off', 'was', 'only', 'slight', 'problem', 'cat', 'did', ""n't"", 'pop', 'up', 'often.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'do', 'couple', 'hours', 'good', 'start', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'romance', 'something', 'unsettling', 'sort', 'love', 'written', 'Future', ""'d"", 'put', 'ceiling', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'pay', 'disc', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'ride.Thank', 'time.-', 't']",N/A
