I like how it didn't try to copy line by line the original, or repeat the scenarios or scenes.  It was a nice twist to add the ""street ball"" nitch too.  The young actors were enjoyable to wach, and the acting was not bad.All in all, very nice film.1 star lower than 4, since it went straight to DVD.  Poor marketing for this one.Recommded.MC White",3,Wow!
