My mom was asking me, doesn't this just encourage criminals/kidnappers to try this sort of thing?  A kidnap-ransom that happens in a completely planned out environment and only lasts exactly 24 hours.  No one gets hurt, the ransom is a reasonable ($50,000) amount (for a wealthy family).  The child is abducted and taken to a faraway location.  Joe (played by Kevin Bacon) stays with the mother and explains the house rules.  Cheryl (Courtney Love) babysits the husband, and Marvin (Pruitt Vince) watches the child.  The house rules are simple.  Every 30-minutes the kidnappers contact each other via cellphone to let each other know things are going according to plan.  The next morning, the wife is to make arrangements to transfer the money for the husband to pick up.  The husband picks up the money and hands it to Cheryl.  Marvin brings the child to a rendezvous point where Joe will leave the mother to reunite with her child.  Kidnappers disappear.  Crime over.But what if things don't go according to plan?  What if there's more to it than a simple kidnapping?  What if the mother attacks, the father gets feisty and the child has asthma?  Will the plan change?  You betcha.  That's what makes this film so suspenseful, and I will guarantee that it leaves you on the edge of your seats.  Wonderful performances by Charlize Theron, Kevin Bacon, and Dakota Fanning.This movie left me feeling as if everyone is vulnerable and never truly safe, especially with the amount of information available out there on any individual.  Fictional crimes such as the one described in this film become more and more plausible.  Watch it as an eye opener.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (Chilling performances.

725832,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00007AJE1,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","The problem with `Trapped' is that, like with most films in this genre, it struggles with believability.  Some of the plot works, but as the film continues on it becomes more and contrived and improbable and just plain ridiculous at times.  The `twists' feel like major clich&eacute;s in this genre, total `been there done that' moments that have been regurgitated time and time again.  Even the `my child needs her medicine' was done in another `trapped type movie' that very year, `Panic Room' (which is far better thanks to Fincher's magnetic direction).  The performances are mostly uniformly good, especially Theron who nails the tension and determination in her character.  Bacon is good at playing creepy, and his usual ticks that bother me to no end felt comfortable within this character, so I was okay with his performance.  Really, it is the dissolving of plot that makes this film a total mess (a hot mess if you will).  It is commanding and absorbing in parts, but you won't walk away from this feeling like you watched something great; which is sad considering that it could have been.  There was obviously some real thought put into the base plot (the kidnapping plan was kind of genius and really seemed inspired for a film in this genre), I just wish that they had maintained that originality as the film pressed forward.

However,in spite of this it's still quite tense and entertaining.Dr. Will Jennings (Stuart Townshend) and his wife Karen (Charlize Theron) are a couple whose idyllic lifestyle takes a turn for the worse when their cute little pixie of a daughter, Abby (Dakota Fanning) is kidnapped and held for ransom by Joe Hickey (Kevin Bacon in ANOTHER bad guy role) and his trashy wife Cheryl Tilly (Courtney Love- who else?). What makes this situation more complicated is the fact that there is a third party involved in the form of Marvin, a balding, pudgy dweeb to help take care of Abby while Joe holds Karen hostage and Cheryl deals to Will. But while for starters the couple play by the rules in order to save their daughter they soon, predictably (That's one word I seem to use a lot) have to in turn manipulate their captors to earn their freedom, save their little girl and return to their normal everyday lives. (In Theron's case that even includes threatening to do a Bobbitt on Bacon's Porksaw when he tries getting fresh with her.) What, you may ask, is the motive for the kidnapping? That would be considered a spoiler; but I will say that the motive is very predictable. In fact, so predictable it makes Tony Blair seem like one of the most interesting men on the planet. This picture is sort of a hybrid of RANSOM and THE TIE THAT BINDS, but strong performances all round and some suspenseful moments all help make TRAPPED a better movie than you'd expect.DVD extras include a Making Of doco, deleted scenes, commentary by the Director and Screenwriter, an alternate ending for the movie, the film's trailer and bios/filmographies for key cast and crew members.",3,The perfect crime?

Kidnap a child from wealthy parents, hold him or her for ransom, intimidate and control the wife while the husband is away, then force the husband to come up with the ransom money. Joe's plan has been flawless. Until he takes the wrong child. From the wrong parents.Charlize Theron plays mother to Dakota Fanning in the first film that made me sit up and take notice of this sensational child actress. Dakota's role as an asthmatic child is played to perfection, although her natural pallor I'm sure helped with her role. Charlize plays a mother who is first horrified to find her child missing, terrified of the strange intruder (Bacon) in her house, but then she comes through and begins to fight as we hope most mother's would. You can't help but cheer her on.Stuart Townsend plays the handsome, floatplane-jetting doctor who is stalked by Bacon's partner in crime, Courtney Love. And while he's fending off Courtney, Bacon's other partner has Dakota stashed away in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. This fragile looking sweetie shows her own smarts and strengths, and holds her own among her peers.It is the immediate non-stop action of this film that hooked me into watching it three times. And Dakota's stunning performance. That girl has acting in her blood! From the second the movie starts to the chase scene at the end, the tension doesn't let up. Charlize is believable in her mother role and the energy between her and Bacon sizzles just enough to make your skin crawl. Bacon is scarily in his element in this type of role.All in all, the performances were very good, the plot raced by and rarely slowed, the emotions were well acted and the ending, satisfying.

On more than one occasion I was tempted to turn it off but to give it a fair shot I reluctantly sat through its entirety.

The characters are also very annoying. This is one movie where you almost cheer for the bad guys to do something horrible.Kevin Bacon appears bored and uninvolved in his role and seems to indicate that the 'strange dude' typecast just isn't working for him anymore. He needs to move on. Charlize Theron gives a good performance but the horrible script weighs her down. A noble effort is also made by Courtney Love who also seems encumbered by the bad script.Unfortunately, the ludicrous script only gets worse as the plot thickens to a consistency of green pea soup that has been sitting on the kitchen table for weeks. Get the idea?

The casting is near perfect and the dialogue is riveting.  Kevin Bacon has mastered the art of portraying purely evil men that make your skin crawl.  The other actors including Charlize Theron admirably perform their assigned roles.  It captures your attention and you will care about the characters.  Any normal person, needless to add, should easily relate to the parents whose child has been kidnapped for ransom.  Trapped effectively begins as a psychological thriller---but regretfully ends with insane car chases and exhausting special effects.  The last half hour is difficult to endure and one may be tempted to simply walk out of the screening room.Why did Trapped leave much to be desired?  My adamant view is that the producers of these big budget movies prefer to play it safe.  They likely think that throwing in expensive action sequences, more appropriate to an Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone flick, lessen their economic risk.  They have yet to realize that sometimes less is more.

Iles, to me, is like the earlier John Grisham , the good Grisham, who could write thrillers like ""A time to kill"" and ""The firm"".""Trapped"" is a movie based on Iles' ""24 hours"". It deals with a group of kidnappers who have devised the ""perfect kidnapping plan"", as Joey, the head of the gang, puts it: by separating the father, the mother, and the child, and by placing phone calls every thirty minutes, the kidnappers have total control of the situation. But this time it's not going to be that easy.The book is gripping, thrilling and very well written in the sense that all characters' reactions are true to real life. When I knew that there was a movie based on ""24 hours"", featuring the beautiful Charlize Theron, the competent Kevin Bacon and with a screenplay written by the same author, I wanted to watch it right away. Unfortunately, the result is not the one I expected.""Trapped"" is one of those examples where the transition from print to screen is kind of traumatic. While the text makes the reader turn the pages faster, the movie scenes are rushed and make the viewers role their eyes. While the plot on text is believable, the plot on screen lacks elements so that the viewer fully understands what's going on. While reading the book, I could picture anyone I wanted as Joey, but watching the movie I had to put up with Bacon's worst acting in years. Once again, Charlize Theron is competent, and Pruett Taylor Vince is another good surprise.Even so, with all these problems, ""Trapped"" is mildly entertaining and fast-paced, even if somewhat predictable.

Pruitt Taylor Vince (in a role that could could have been written for Billy Bob Thornton) and Courtney Love as the accomplices each carried their respective roles well.  Charlize Theron was extremely effective as the mother of kidnapped daugher (Dakota Fanning).  Dakota was, as in Son Of Sam, so perfect you are just amazed.  If there was a weak link in the main cast is would have to be Stuart Townsend.  In general he just didn't seem to fit in with the other cast members' style.  Also, Colleen Camp, (Joan) as the neighbor appeared a little loopy, the actress not the role.The DVD with its alternate endings, deleted scenes, and featurette was full of entertainment in addition to the film. Individual commentaries by the writer and director offered a wealth of inside information from different perspectives.  Director Luis Mandoki (White Palace, Message in A Bottle, Angel Eyes, etc. etc) is an excellent director.  Not enough can be said about the phenomenal camera work and the matching of the styles with the content of the scene.  The film itself may have a few weaknesses in plot here and there, but between Mandoki's direction and the intensity of the cast, you were so drawn into the action that those little holes were really nothing more than a small nuisance.This film was apparently bedeviled by personal crises (deaths, illnesses, accidents, etc.) during the filming, but to their credit the cast and crew didn't seem to lose direction or focus.All in all this is a smart and taunt thriller with the feel of 'real' people being involved in very suspenseful situations  and has a very intimate, nearly claustrophobic feel to the locations.

It really is silly that when Kevin Bacon is threatened with castration, he's ready to call the kidnapping off.

Then of course there's the idiotic traffice accident, and what would a modern movie be without the ""dead man rising scene!""

There are times when you wander who is pulling off this kindapping anyway, which is just what the movie intends you to do.

It winds up reminding me of a line from a movie I saw years ago: ""If it weren't for bad taste, you wouldn't have any.""A couple [played by Kevin Bacon and Courtney Love] has successfully pulled off four kidnappings. Each time the child has been returned unharmed. Because of the way the crimes are structured, the parents pay the ransoms but never called the police. When the pair takes Will and Karen Jennings' [Stuart Townsend and Charlize Theron] little girl, everything goes wrong. The child suffers from acute asthma, and the Jennings turn out to be difficult and quite aggressive. What should have been another smooth caper turns into a deadly cat and mouse game.I can't say much more without spoiling the plot. I can say that the kidnappers turn out to be operating out of what they see as justifiable revenge, but each is so sadistic and mean-spirited that any empathy we might have for them quickly evaporates.There are some strong performances, especially by Bacon and Love. The movie moves at a brisk pace and ends in a spectacular chase scene. If its writers hadn't chosen such a sordid route [again, I can't say more without revealing too much], ""Trapped"" would have been one of the year's better thrillers.

It has a really great cast, with Kevin Bacon looking actually really good for his age, and Courtney Love being a surprisingly believeable actress, despite suffering a miscarriage during filming.Thankfully, Charlize Theron & Stuart Townsend, a couple in real life, don't appear on screen together enough, but just enough to show us they have zero chemistry together.What really surprised me about this movie, was Dakota Fanning's performance. In recent movies I've seen her in, I really didn't like her that much, as she always comes across as a little brat. But in this, she played the part really well, playing an asthmatic little girl, despite being only 8 - although she looks younger. The casting people also did really well choosing her as Charlize Theron's daughter in this, as they could be mother & daughter. And she acts traumatized perfectly.Kevin Bacon shoved away all my thoughts of Hollow Man (which previously scared the hell out of me), and although not your conventionally handsome actor, he's easy on the eye. Although he has a slightly dodgy looking tattoo of a spider's web on his stomach, there appears to be one on his back too, but I couldn't see it closely enough. Boo.The ending is fantastic, and definitely makes up for any doubts other viewers may have had during the rest of the movie. The ending is really sad, and I won't ruin anything for anyone who hasn't seen it, but what I do want to know is what happened to Marvin, played by Pruitt Taylor Vince? It's shown what happens to the family, and Courtney Love's character, but I loved Marvin in this, and I desperately wanted to know what happened to him. Maybe it shows in the alternate ending.The movie has slight feelings of the TV series '24' and also the Johnny Depp film, Nick Of Time. I've never seen '24', but Nick Of Time is also based over a 24-hour period, but is more fast paced than this. Disappointing that this isn't the same.See this movie if you're a fan of any of the stars (or Stuart Townsend & his gorgeous Irish accent), but don't see if you're a fan of fast paced thrillers.

725882,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00007AJE1,Michael Butts,"[1, 4]","TRAPPED is based on Greg Iles' incredibly suspenseful novel, 24 HOURS.  Iles himself did the screenplay, so at least the movie tries to stick the book as much as possible.  There are significant alterations Iles did in bringing this book to the screen, and there are significant absences such as the involvement of other kidnap victims, that would have made the film a lot more exciting, I think.  But overall, its a commendable translation to the big screen.Kevin Bacon as Joe starts out well in his role, but the time the movie comes to its exciting climax, he seems uninvolved, and uses a jittery nervous exterior that seemingly comes from nowhere.Charlize Theron who has wonderful expressive eyes also starts out very strong; there are moments though when she seems lost in direction; she underplays key scenes and overplays some, too.  It's a good performance overall; but I think more would have been better.Dakota Fanning as Abby is remarkable.  She really seems to be a frightened little girl, without all the posturing and cutesiness that could have sabotaged her character.When I read the book, I could just see someone like Courtney Love playing Cheryl.  Unfortunately, in the transition to screen, her character lost a great deal.  In the book, she's much more ""fleshed out"" (no pun intended), and she gets lost in the finale, whereas in the book she was a pivotal figure.  Love's performance is restrained and effective, however.Tyler Pruitt Vance's Marvin is well done, although he telegraphs his ""mental state"" too heavily.The film's biggest weakness is Stuart Townsend.  His performance is so wooden and staged, he seems like a high schooler in a senior class play.  A stronger actor here would have made the family's plight a little more emotional.The director has a strange attachment to mirrors, and although it is initially interesting, its overuse diminishes Bacon and Theron's intensity.But, TRAPPED is a well-paced and involving thriller, and the finale on the interstate is impressive and very close to the finale in the book.As for the extras, the deleted scenes are ephemeral; I can see why they took them out.

725884,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B00007AJE1,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[1, 2]","Trapped is an awful movie. It is by far the worst kidnapping film I've ever seen. What's so funny is that the acting is pretty good. The electrifying Kevin Bacon is wonderful as the charismatic bad guy. His role of Joe brings back memories of when he played Wade in The River Wild. He never disappoints even if the material is pathetic. Charlize Theron did a good job as the desperate wife. She plays the strong-willed victim very well. Courtney Love was decent if not sickening and Dakota Fanning was very impressive. The worst actor in the entire film was Stuart Townsend. Nothing about his acting seemed authentic. He was bland and boring and it was laughable to think of him as a doctor with all the stupid things he did.Now what makes this movie so mind-numbingly putrid? The plot is cliche. If you're gonna make a movie from a plot that's been done a million times you can at least make sure your version brings something new to the table. I could excuse the cliches if only the movie had been interesting. My main complaint was how BORING it was. This was one of the most boring and draggy films I've ever seen.Even though Kevin was the best in the film, his role as Joe was cliche and laughable. The character was one dimensional and this affected the story. If only we'd seen a glimpse that Joe had a conscience, his character would have seemed more believable. But having a bad guy who is 100% bad (especially after the family tragedy he'd endured) was off-putting. Joe wasn't scary at all to me. He was arrogant and cocky but not scary. He also was rather dim-witted for someone who has kidnapped kids before ""four times"" as he kept reminding us throughout the entire movie. Joe had this big kidnapping scheme to worry about yet he spent his time trying to get into Karen's pants. And for what? The scenes between Joe and Karen were boring and useless. They served no point but to lead up to some attempted rape scene that wasn't even necessary. It would've been much better if the scenes between Karen and Joe had been of her hiding and running from him throughout the house, yet she sits around and talks with him as if she's on a date. I mean this was her house and she acted like she didn't know where anything was. She had plenty of times to gather a weapon, anything. While Joe went on one of his many speeches in the kitchen and he had his back turned, Karen could've gone for a knife or ran out the house. It's pathetic, stupid stuff like this that makes this movie so silly. We all knew no one would kill the girl so Joe's threats were empty at best. Karen should've done more and it was ridiculous how she sat there all that time while Joe just acted a moron. The scenes were straight out of a soap opera.The most entertaining scenes were between Courtney Love and Townsend. You could feel the tension when they interacted and at least Townsend acted like he had some sense at times. He did do things to try to get away instead of just sitting around watching like Karen did. Love and Townsend had great chemistry and it was the only shining light in this film. We were forced to see more scenes of Joe and Karen who had zero chemistry no matter how well Bacon and Theron can act.The film was jumbled up and just bad beyond words. The script sucked and there was just no point to this movie.Skip this. It's crap. I only watched it because I'm a Kevin Bacon fan and I still regret giving it a chance. It is not worth it at all.

725889,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00007AJE1,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 23]","I sometimes wonder if the actors who agree to appear in movies featuring Kevin Bacon do so because they have a secret desire to become a primary link in that ever-popular parlor game known as Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, a move destined to assure them of at least some chance at screenland immortality.  The actors co-starring with him in ""Trapped"" - an aptly named film that is little more than a 99-minute wallow in pointless, unadulterated sadism -include Charlize Theron, Courtney Love and Stuart Townsend, not exactly no-name nobodies but not quite Hollywood A-list players either.  But selling your soul for eternal fame often comes with a hefty price tag, and I have the rather sneaking suspicion that these latter-day Mephistopheles' would be just as happy if we forgot that they were ever associated with this perfectly dreadful, would-be thriller - Kevin Bacon and all.  Even a chance at cinematic immortality can't be worth appearing in a movie this awful.Is there a more sensitive subject these days than child endangerment and kidnapping?  And can any filmmaker, daring or foolish enough to take it on, really do so without calling into question his own personal aims and motives?  Do we really want to see traumatized children torn away from their parents or threatened with strangulation all in the guise of ""popular entertainment""?  It has been done successfully in the past, of course.  One of the greatest thrillers of all time - the 1964 British film ""S&eacute;ance on a Wet Afternoon"" - used the subject of child abduction as the source for its drama, but that film was a work of art, a poignant, psychologically compelling study of a woman on the verge of insanity.  It takes a fine sensibility and a steady hand to keep a touchy issue like child endangerment from turning into an exercise in cheap exploitation, and, I'm sorry to say, neither of these qualities appears with much abundance in ""Trapped,"" the latest variation on the theme.  Indeed, ""Trapped"" is about as far from being a work of art as it is possible for a film to get.Bacon plays the leader of a trio of child kidnappers whose modus operandi is to target wealthy couples, hold their children for ransom, then release them when the parents have coughed up the demanded sums of money.  The threesome claims to have ""successfully"" pulled off this little trick four times already - in each case ending with the parents being reunited with their children, no questions asked.  The fifth and current abduction involves little Abby Jennings, the young daughter of Will and Karen Jennings, he a high-priced, seemingly world-renowned anesthesiologist, and she a doting mother with a few self-defense tricks up her sleeve (or in her panties to be more exact).  And as if being forced to watch this poor little girl being threatened by a bunch of third-rate bullies weren't bad enough, we also have to witness her gasping for breath in any number of asthma attacks brought on by the stress of the experience.  Well, what with ""Signs"" earlier and now this film, I guess asthma has become the childhood ailment of choice this movie season.The film is not only ugly on a moral level, but on a visual level as well.  The cinematography by Frederick Elmes and Piotr Sobocinski is drab, mundane and colorless, and director Luis Mandoki's ""style"" consists mainly of having the camera jump up and down wildly whenever a character gets excited or the story threatens to undermine the audience's attention span.  The finale involves a massive multi-vehicle pile up on an Oregon freeway that is as ludicrous as it is unconvincing.""Trapped"" pretty much says it all - for the actors, the filmmakers and, above all, the audience.",1,"""Trapped"" is the perfect word for it",1038700800,"12 1, 2002",2002,3692,"['sometimes', 'wonder', 'actors', 'who', 'agree', 'appear', 'movies', 'featuring', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'do', 'so', 'have', 'secret', 'desire', 'become', 'primary', 'link', 'ever-popular', 'parlor', 'game', 'known', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'move', 'destined', 'assure', 'least', 'chance', 'screenland', 'immortality', 'actors', 'co-starring', 'Trapped', 'aptly', 'named', 'film', 'little', 'more', '99-minute', 'wallow', 'pointless', 'unadulterated', 'sadism', '-include', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'not', 'exactly', 'no-name', 'nobodies', 'not', 'quite', 'Hollywood', 'A-list', 'players', 'either', 'selling', 'soul', 'eternal', 'fame', 'often', 'hefty', 'price', 'tag', 'have', 'rather', 'sneaking', 'suspicion', 'latter-day', 'Mephistopheles', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'happy', 'forgot', 'were', 'ever', 'associated', 'perfectly', 'dreadful', 'would-be', 'thriller', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Even', 'chance', 'cinematic', 'immortality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worth', 'appearing', 'movie', 'awful.Is', 'more', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'days', 'child', 'endangerment', 'kidnapping', 'can', 'filmmaker', 'daring', 'foolish', 'enough', 'take', 'really', 'do', 'so', 'calling', 'question', 'own', 'personal', 'aims', 'motives', 'Do', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'traumatized', 'children', 'torn', 'away', 'parents', 'threatened', 'strangulation', 'guise', 'popular', 'entertainment', 'been', 'done', 'successfully', 'past', 'course', 'One', 'greatest', 'thrillers', 'time', '1964', 'British', 'film', 'S', 'eacute', 'ance', 'Wet', 'Afternoon', 'used', 'subject', 'child', 'abduction', 'source', 'drama', 'film', 'was', 'work', 'art', 'poignant', 'psychologically', 'compelling', 'study', 'woman', 'verge', 'insanity', 'fine', 'sensibility', 'steady', 'hand', 'keep', 'touchy', 'issue', 'child', 'endangerment', 'turning', 'exercise', 'cheap', 'exploitation', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'qualities', 'much', 'abundance', 'Trapped', 'latest', 'variation', 'theme', 'Indeed', 'Trapped', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'work', 'art', 'possible', 'film', 'get.Bacon', 'plays', 'leader', 'trio', 'child', 'kidnappers', 'modus', 'operandi', 'target', 'wealthy', 'couples', 'hold', 'children', 'ransom', 'then', 'release', 'when', 'parents', 'have', 'coughed', 'up', 'demanded', 'sums', 'money', 'threesome', 'claims', 'have', 'successfully', 'pulled', 'off', 'little', 'trick', 'four', 'times', 'already', 'case', 'ending', 'parents', 'being', 'reunited', 'children', 'questions', 'asked', 'fifth', 'current', 'abduction', 'little', 'Abby', 'Jennings', 'young', 'daughter', 'Will', 'Karen', 'Jennings', 'high-priced', 'seemingly', 'world-renowned', 'anesthesiologist', 'doting', 'mother', 'few', 'self-defense', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'panties', 'be', 'more', 'exact', 'being', 'forced', 'watch', 'poor', 'little', 'girl', 'being', 'threatened', 'bunch', 'third-rate', 'bullies', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'also', 'have', 'witness', 'gasping', 'breath', 'number', 'asthma', 'attacks', 'brought', 'stress', 'experience', 'Well', 'what', 'Signs', 'earlier', 'now', 'film', 'guess', 'asthma', 'become', 'childhood', 'ailment', 'choice', 'movie', 'season.The', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'ugly', 'moral', 'level', 'visual', 'level', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'Frederick', 'Elmes', 'Piotr', 'Sobocinski', 'drab', 'mundane', 'colorless', 'director', 'Luis', 'Mandoki', 'style', 'mainly', 'having', 'camera', 'jump', 'up', 'down', 'wildly', 'whenever', 'character', 'excited', 'story', 'undermine', 'audience', 'attention', 'span', 'finale', 'massive', 'multi-vehicle', 'pile', 'up', 'Oregon', 'freeway', 'as', 'ludicrous', 'unconvincing', 'Trapped', 'pretty', 'much', 'actors', 'filmmakers', 'audience']",N/A

I read ""24 Hours"", the book by Greg Iles on which the movie is based, a couple of years ago and was satisfied with the experience. When the movie came out I did not even give it a second glance, but when Charlize Theron won the Oscar for best actress for her performance in ""Monster"", I decided that maybe I should give other of her performances a try.The script, written by Iles, is faithful to the book. A team of kidnappers has found a ""perfect"" modus operandi; they grab a rich kid and at the same time one of the members of the team stays with the mother and another with the father to keep them in check. In this way everything runs smoothly...or maybe not. Now they have chosen the wrong family to mess with, since they will not go down without a fight.Kevin Bacon plays Joe, the leader of the kidnappers' team, who is in charge of staying with the mother of the victim (Charlize Theron). The movie goes back and forth between this pair and the one formed by Stuart Townsend, who plays the role of the father, and Courtney Love, the female member of the gang. This separation makes the difference in the quality of the acting strikingly obvious, with Bacon and Theron shinning compared to Townsend and Love.The movie, as the book, presents a thriller with a non-stop pace, which keeps the audience on edge. The sexual tension between the kidnappers and the victims present in the book is well achieved in the movie too. The main weakness of the movie is the ending, which is rushed compared to the novel. Therefore, it does not achieve such a high climax and disappoints those who read the book a little bit towards the end.

So I turned on my TV and flipped through the channels, only to find this movie on, a movie I had never heard of before. So I decided to give it a chance. Trapped deals with two extremely smart kidnappers who target rich families and kidnap their children for a $250,000 ransom price. So they target the Jennings: a happy, rich couple with their 6-year-old daughter Abigail. The kidnappers kidnap Abigail and their foolproof plan--which they have executed four times in the past successfully and never been caught--suddenly goes awry as they find out Abigail is highly asthmatic and in addition, the Jennings find out more than the kidnappers want them to know. While one kidnapper forces the mother to act as a prostitute at their house, and the kidnapper's wife holds the father hostage in his hotel room away on a business trip, the Jennings hatch a plan to get Abigail back...but there is more than they perceive to this kidnapping. Trapped is ultimately an EXTREMELY exciting, suspenseful, classic nail-biter flick that is fun to watch on a big screen at night with surround sound. The acting is superb, as well, which is rarely seen these days in a non-popular movie like this one.

725897,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00007AJE1,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[10, 12]","Smart casting, fast paced direction, and a few surprising twists enhance this rather typical kidnapping film that you've seen before.Real-life couple Charlize Theron and Stuart Townsend have a sickly child, Dakota Fanning, that is kidnapped by a psychotic man, played with great relish by Kevin Bacon, and his wife, nicely played by Courtney Love.  Of course, like all good kidnapping films, the plan goes rather awry and the victims strike back.  The films soars in the acting, directing, and pacing departments, but falters in the script which has the actors behave in such a way at times that even our willingness to suspend our disbelief is impossible.  The same could be said for several ""coincidences"" that occur within the film that creak like the worn out cliches that they are.Nevertheless, the film is suspenseful and is an overall exciting experience as long as you can accept all they throw at you without question.Spoiler Alert:I have to note the specifics for the problems within this film, but, unfortunately, that also means giving away some plot twists to do so.  Read ahead if you don't mind that.Problem #1:  The kidnappers are supposed to be grief-stricken parents striking back after the loss of their own child's death. Why then the obsession with getting money?  How then do they enjoy torturing a little child?  How then does Bacon also become a rapist during the revenge kidnapping?  None of this really fits with grieving parents striking back at those they think are responsible for their child's death.Problem #2:  How in the world did they all happen to meet up on the highway in the end climax scene?  It is all just too impossible to believe or accept.  It's the worse contrivance I've seen in years.Problem #3:  Why the unnecessary action sequences in a film where it really doesn't fit?  It comes across as ""Hey, the producers found some extra money, so we thought we'd throw this in.""Again, the problems are serious in this flawed film, however, it is still an overall decent flick with a great cast.",3,"[3.5] Better than average ""been there, done that"" kind of film.",1191542400,"10 5, 2007",2007,2034,"['Smart', 'casting', 'fast', 'paced', 'direction', 'few', 'surprising', 'twists', 'enhance', 'rather', 'typical', 'kidnapping', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.Real-life', 'couple', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Stuart', 'Townsend', 'have', 'sickly', 'child', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'kidnapped', 'psychotic', 'man', 'played', 'great', 'relish', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'wife', 'nicely', 'played', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'course', 'good', 'kidnapping', 'films', 'plan', 'rather', 'awry', 'victims', 'strike', 'back', 'films', 'soars', 'acting', 'directing', 'pacing', 'departments', 'falters', 'script', 'actors', 'behave', 'way', 'times', 'even', 'willingness', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'impossible', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'several', 'coincidences', 'occur', 'film', 'creak', 'worn', 'out', 'cliches', 'are.Nevertheless', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'overall', 'exciting', 'experience', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'accept', 'throw', 'question.Spoiler', 'Alert', 'have', 'note', 'specifics', 'problems', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'also', 'giving', 'away', 'plot', 'twists', 'do', 'so', 'Read', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'that.Problem', '1', 'kidnappers', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'grief-stricken', 'parents', 'striking', 'back', 'loss', 'own', 'child', 'death', 'Why', 'then', 'obsession', 'getting', 'money', 'How', 'then', 'do', 'enjoy', 'torturing', 'little', 'child', 'How', 'then', 'Bacon', 'also', 'become', 'rapist', 'revenge', 'kidnapping', 'None', 'really', 'grieving', 'parents', 'striking', 'back', 'think', 'are', 'responsible', 'child', 'death.Problem', '2', 'How', 'world', 'did', 'happen', 'meet', 'up', 'highway', 'end', 'climax', 'scene', 'just', 'too', 'impossible', 'believe', 'accept', 'worse', 'contrivance', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years.Problem', '3', 'Why', 'unnecessary', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'where', 'really', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Hey', 'producers', 'found', 'extra', 'money', 'thought', ""'d"", 'throw', 'Again', 'problems', 'are', 'serious', 'flawed', 'film', 'however', 'still', 'overall', 'decent', 'flick', 'great', 'cast']",N/A

In the family home of Charlize Theron and Stuart Townsend's characters where Theron is held captive by Kevin Bacon.  The second is a in a hotel room where Townsend is being held by Courtney Love, and the third is a cabin in the woods where the daughter is held by a slightly slow man. All are separated for 24 Hours. (Which was the shooting title of the film and the title of the book by Greg Iles.)One of the weeker points in the film is how imformation travels between Theron and Townsends characters.  How Townsend ends up with some information is not explained to the fullest unless you already know the story from reading the book.The other is the experamentle if not highly erratic camera movements.  In the scene where Theron's daughter is taken and she is confronted by Bacon in her house.  The camera is everywhere and you are left with a feeling of motion sickness.  This is done I beleive to put you right in Theron's shoes and it works you feel at the end just as paniced and confussed as she does.  This camerawork continues throughout the film with out the same results and after a while it becomes very annoying.What Trapped does have going for it though is the acting of Theron, Bacon, and Townsend(who does his best to hold up his end of the film while Love pulls it under).  It also has a relatively good script which was penned by the books author Greg Iles.  It has some good action sequences and Dakota Fanning proves herself again as one of one of the top child actors. (Fanning was previously scene in I Am Sam.)  Thankfully the movie doesn't stray far from the novel, which is a common problem in Hollywood.  However I do not beleive it was wise of the director to leave out the part of Bacon killing the neighbour and to change the motive for his actions, they made his character to soft by doing this and the film would have been served better if it had been not tampered with at all.All in all the movie is okay.

725901,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00007AJE1,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Is there any perfect kidnapping plan?  Greg Iles's bestselling thriller starts with this intiriguing (and very unnerving) premise.  Our chief villain Joe Hickey (Kevin Bacon, again a bad guy, huh?) thinks so, and has succeeded four times so far, with his &quot;team&quot; including Pruitt Taylor Vince and Courtney Love.But when Joe kidnapped lovely little girl Abby Jennings (incredibly talented Dakota Fanning, &quot;I Am Sam&quot;), he forgot to check one thing, which leads him and Abby's mother (Charlize Theron) into the complications.  The would-be perfect crime (which effectively uses cell phones) spins out of control, and bring out more and more suspence.The story about kidnapping always worries people because it has a ring of truth.  What if that happens to my family?  The film starts with such kind of intense moments, so it will make some of you certainly uncomfortable.But soon you realize that the script (done by the original author himself) needs more polishing.  I don't know anything about the book, but the film has too many coincidences and situations too good to be true,  How many fathers in USA does happen to own an airplane?  Or how many of them happen to have a friend in phone company?  Somebody, guess it.The actors are not to be blamed, considering the sometimes corny dialogues and unbelievable finale.  Kevin Bacon, adding another film to his CV to make the game of 'six steps' easier than before, again throws away his shirt on bed (is this compulsory or something?).  Charlize Theron is credible as tormented mother ... at least so before she does THAT to Kevin Bacon's character, and Stuwart Townsend is passable as her husband, but they all pale away before Dakota Fanning.  Actually, in Japan, &quot;Trapped&quot; is advertized as the film starring Dakota Fanning.  The fact is a little different, but certainly the film distributor's decision can be justified.Better than the same director Luis Mandoki's &quot;Angel Eyes,&quot; &quot;Trapped&quot; still appears meandering at some points.  Ignore the plot holes and many contrived situations, and you might find it pretty thrilling ... at least, the opening 30 minutes.",3,Starts Promisingly But ...
