Running away from her abusive father (Paul Bettany) with her housekeeper (Jennifer Hudson) she finds her mother's old caretaker (Queen Latifah), a beekeeper whose family musters enough love for them while sorting out the wounds in their own pasts.Absorbing is an overused word, but it fits perfectly for this mesmerizing and touching drama so well acted with perfectionistic touches by director/screenwriter Gina Prince-Bythewood.  With a strong emotional core, and featuring a heart-felt performance by Fanning, the film strikes an admirable balance between scenes depicting mundane sweetness and the rawer developments of desperation.

I'm most definitely a fan of Queen Latifah...I think she's fantastic in everything I've seen her in,  whether the actual movie was good or not. As a person who is usually disappointed by movie adaptions, I really can't say, because I have yet to read the book. But just purely for the movie, it was wonderful.Sophie Okonedo, who plays May, captures your heart and stood out from the beginning. She's an engaging actress, and I hope to see her more in the coming years. Alicia Keys was also good -- I didn't remember that she was in this and when I saw her I felt a bit questioning as to if she would be good enough for this type of film. She has a talent for acting, it was easier then I expected to let go of her as a recognizable singer and have her become June. Queen Latifah has a soothing, stoic quality to her and is the perfect choice for such a matriarchal role. Dakota Fanning was as usual, quite good. I can't think of a time I haven't liked her and have been watching her films since I am Sam, one of my favorites. To be honest, I felt Jennifer Hudson was a little stiff, and I'd almost forgotten she was in this movie.While this is an amazing movie, it also made me feel both saddened and joyful about mankind. This movie shows how hateful and cruel people can be based on your ethnicity, and also how kind and loving with no conditions or notice taken of the color of one's skin.The only disappointment was that this DVD does not have any special features, which is something I look forward to on every DVD.

1220205,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001NLJ3N0,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","I'll admit that I really thought I was going to hate this movie.  It just looked like a cheap attempt at real sentiment and so I wrote the whole film off before my wife insisted that we sit down and watch it.  What I got was not what I expected.  True, the film has its sore spots, but overall it is far more impressive, connected and emotionally invested than I initially gave it credit for.  With a powerful performance by Dakota Fanning and a pure heart at its center, `The Secret Life of Bees' is far more than a cheap attempt and sentiment as I once labeled it.The film takes place in 1964 South Carolina, where a young girl named Lily struggles to forgive herself for her past mistakes.  When a young child she caused an accident that took her mother's life and left her with a disgruntled and ignorant father who sees her as nothing more than a reminder of what he used to have.  With her caregiver Rosaleen in toe, Lily runs away from home to find herself by finding the memory of her mother.  What she finds are the Boatwright sisters, three strong black women who make famous honey.  These sisters give Lily and Rosaleen a place to stay and a job to do and eventually shower them with the feelings of self-worth they so desire.I have never read the novel, but I have read that changes were made.  I am not apposed to this as long as it carries the same initial vision of the author, or at least makes good on creating an entirely new vision.  From what I hear, `The Secret Life of Bees' is done proud with this adaptation.The acting is where the film lives and dies, which is to be expected with such a strong character piece.  For the most part the acting is very good, which is why this film shocked me in such a good way.  When you have a cast that consists of three singers, a child star trying to find her path in the world of teen cinema, and an actress who has yet to really prove herself then you don't really have a cast that screams ""we are going to be amazing"".  So, let's just go down the list, starting with the most obvious.  Dakota Fanning is flawless here.  She really captures every emotion this young girl is experiencing and delivers every line, every movement with such rich chemistry and connection.  I was astounded by her depth because it wasn't an oddly misplaced maturity but a naturally progressive sense of understanding.  Queen Latifah has proven she can handle the big screen, and handle it she does; very well.  Alicia Keys is first and foremost a singer, and a great one at that; but she proves here that she can handle some acting as well.  She's certainly not as seasoned as some of the rest here, but she has potential to become very, very good.  Jennifer Hudson has an Oscar for singing very well.  Sadly, she isn't the most talented actress.  She delivers `Effi light' here, giving us practically the same character just without the singing; so she fades away fast.  I really liked Sophie Okonedo in `Hotel Rwanda', but one performance is not enough to make you great.  Here she is the weakest link with her amateurish portrayal of the mentally unstable sister.  She had moments that felt inspired, but overall she was rather uneven.With a film like this, and really any film, you have to take the bad with the good, and when you do that you are left with a very well done and moving film experience.  It's not perfect, but it is memorable and engrossing and definitely tear-jerker quality entertainment.  If you have children, especially daughters, than beware for this will make you shed many tears.",4,A surprisingly deep and moving movie experience...,1239580800,"04 13, 2009",2009,3547,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'movie', 'just', 'looked', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'real', 'sentiment', 'so', 'wrote', 'whole', 'film', 'wife', 'insisted', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'True', 'film', 'sore', 'spots', 'overall', 'far', 'more', 'impressive', 'connected', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'initially', 'gave', 'credit', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'pure', 'heart', 'center', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Bees', 'far', 'more', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'sentiment', 'once', 'labeled', 'it.The', 'film', 'place', '1964', 'South', 'Carolina', 'where', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Lily', 'forgive', 'past', 'mistakes', 'When', 'young', 'child', 'caused', 'accident', 'took', 'mother', 'life', 'left', 'disgruntled', 'ignorant', 'father', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'reminder', 'what', 'used', 'have', 'caregiver', 'Rosaleen', 'toe', 'Lily', 'away', 'home', 'find', 'finding', 'memory', 'mother', 'What', 'are', 'Boatwright', 'sisters', 'three', 'strong', 'black', 'women', 'who', 'make', 'famous', 'honey', 'sisters', 'give', 'Lily', 'Rosaleen', 'place', 'stay', 'job', 'do', 'eventually', 'shower', 'feelings', 'self-worth', 'so', 'desire.I', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'have', 'read', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'am', 'not', 'apposed', 'as', 'long', 'same', 'initial', 'vision', 'author', 'least', 'good', 'creating', 'entirely', 'new', 'vision', 'what', 'hear', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Bees', 'done', 'proud', 'adaptation.The', 'acting', 'where', 'film', 'lives', 'dies', 'be', 'expected', 'strong', 'character', 'piece', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'why', 'film', 'shocked', 'good', 'way', 'When', 'have', 'cast', 'three', 'singers', 'child', 'star', 'trying', 'find', 'path', 'world', 'teen', 'cinema', 'actress', 'who', 'yet', 'really', 'prove', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'cast', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'amazing', 'So', 'let', 'just', 'go', 'down', 'list', 'starting', 'most', 'obvious', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'flawless', 'here', 'really', 'emotion', 'young', 'girl', 'experiencing', 'delivers', 'line', 'movement', 'such', 'rich', 'chemistry', 'connection', 'was', 'astounded', 'depth', 'was', ""n't"", 'oddly', 'misplaced', 'maturity', 'naturally', 'progressive', 'sense', 'understanding', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'proven', 'can', 'handle', 'big', 'screen', 'handle', 'very', 'well', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'first', 'foremost', 'singer', 'great', 'one', 'here', 'can', 'handle', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'certainly', 'not', 'as', 'seasoned', 'rest', 'here', 'potential', 'become', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Oscar', 'singing', 'very', 'well', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'most', 'talented', 'actress', 'Effi', 'light', 'here', 'giving', 'practically', 'same', 'character', 'just', 'singing', 'away', 'fast', 'really', 'liked', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'one', 'performance', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'great', 'Here', 'weakest', 'link', 'amateurish', 'portrayal', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'sister', 'had', 'moments', 'felt', 'inspired', 'overall', 'was', 'rather', 'uneven.With', 'film', 'really', 'film', 'have', 'take', 'bad', 'good', 'when', 'do', 'are', 'left', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'moving', 'film', 'experience', 'not', 'perfect', 'memorable', 'engrossing', 'definitely', 'tear-jerker', 'quality', 'entertainment', 'have', 'children', 'especially', 'daughters', 'beware', 'will', 'make', 'shed', 'many', 'tears']",N/A

It did not disappoint her.  So, when friends ask us for movie recommendations and 'Bees' comes up, she essentially recuses herself and defers me to give a more unbiased opinion.My opinion is that the movie succeeds on its own.  I've not read the book.  You don't have to read it to enjoy and appreciate it.  Queen Latifah has evolved into a regal screen presence.  My wife says she nailed the essence of June Boatwright.  Dakota Fanning is on track to be one of the few child actors to make a successful transition to adult roles.  She's extraordinarily talented. Critics continue to slight Jennifer Hudson (she got savaged in Sex and the City - The Movie (Exclusive Extended Cut)).  I honestly don't see what the problem is.  She seems a perfectly capable and likable actress to me.  The gorgeous Alicia Keys is also good in a tough role.A signal to me that this was going to be a quality outing: the presence and oversight of director (and co-screenwriter along with Ms. Monk Kidd) Gina Prince-Bythewood.

Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, Queen Latifah... you should know these names pretty well by now.Anyway, the story is about four older women experiencing life during the cival rights period.  One afternoon they hear a knock on their door, and take in a little white girl.The girl brings along the woman who's been taking care of the white persons family. Both the girl and the woman are looking for a place to stay because the house they came from previously holds nothing but horrible nightmares and abusive and violent memories that are bettet left forgotten.Dakota Fanning shows how much talent she has at such a young age. The way she handles the situations with her troubled and abusive father are just award-winning and amazing.Throughout the film, you will feel compassion, sadness, joy, determination... all kinds of emotions involving the women living in a house somewhere in the south (I believe South Carolina) and trying their best to get through life and through all the troubles they are forced to encounter.This is one of those films that will probably touch you in a deep way.

She is a great actress. Now throw in the performances by Jennifer Hudson and Dakota Fanning and you have a successful movie you won't be able to walk away from and want much more after it ends.Every movie Queen Latifah has ever made has been excellent. Her acting ability is so real and life-like. Back when Jennifer Hudson was on American Idol I had always felt see was by far, the best singer on the stage and was really disappointed when she was voted off. It was at that time I started feeling the entire American Idol show was fixed.The Secret Life of Bees takes you through the life of a young pre-teen energetic white girl and her black (almost slave like) Black nanny and their relationship with a family of three successful black sisters that have created a well known honey producing business.Coming from a man that is seldom excited about a ""chick-flick"" movie, I will say that The Secret Life of Bees has reached the realm of one of my top rated movies of all time.

1220223,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001NLJ3N0,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","""The Secret Life of Bees"" would be tiresome were it only about racism and the Civil Rights movement. Those elements play a definite part in the story, but they don't define it; they work in harmony with a more intimate, more personal, and more meaningful story, which centers on the theme of loving and being loved in return, even under the worst of conditions. Granted, this is not an original theme, and some have argued that it's used in a plot about as sticky-sweet as honey is. They may have a point. But in all honesty, that doesn't change the way I feel about it. This adaptation of Sue Monk Kidd's novel not only tells a believable and focused story, but it also touched me at a deeper level than I expected. I personally never felt that the plot was melodramatic--it was just dramatic enough, and this is in spite of a couple of very tragic scenes. Best of all, I actually felt something for the characters. There's nothing worse than characters you can't invest in, especially if they take part in an otherwise compelling story.No character in this film is more wonderful than fourteen-year-old Lily Owens, a rural peach farmer who lives in South Carolina in 1964, the year President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. She's played by the immensely talented Dakota Fanning. What a reliable young actor, so articulate, so mature, blessed with an innate ability to convey relatable emotions to the audience. Time will definitely be kind to her, and that's because she's now old enough to plausibly play such a complex role. For this film, she develops Lily into a basically good girl, an aspiring writer with a lot of heavy emotional baggage. She blames herself for her mother's death, which happened some years earlier under circumstances I won't reveal. Lily's damaged but nonetheless abusive father, T. Ray (Paul Bettany), insists that her mother left them both, and that when she came back that tragic day, it was only because she wanted her things. Lily refuses to believe it. Or maybe she only thinks she doesn't believe it; we get the sense that, because she doesn't know all the facts, she may be clinging to unfounded hope.After Lily's housekeeper, Rosaleen Daise (Jennifer Hudson), is attacked by a group of white men for wanting to be a registered voter, Lily decides they both should run away. They make their way to the town of Tiburon and end up on a honey farm, one Lily believes may hold a secret from her mother's past. In a bright pink house live three sisters, all named after months of the year. The eldest, August Boatwright (Queen Latifah), is an accommodating, matter-of-fact woman who seems to know that Lily's cover story is a lie. She gives Lily and Rosaleen room and board, and she allows them to earn their keep by working around the house. One of her sisters, a cellist named June (Alicia Keys), is suspicious right from the start, but then again, she is the type that has a very hard time with forgiveness. She can't even commit to her boyfriend, Neil (Nate Parker), and this is despite the fact that she loves him very much. August's other sister, May (Sophie Okonedo), is a good-hearted but troubled soul, carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders for very personal reasons. She cries at the drop of a hat, and she often spends time in front of her own small version of the Wailing Wall. Stuffed between each rock is a piece of paper, each with a sorrowful problem written on it.As Lily learns the secrets to harvesting honey from the Boatwright bee farm, she begins to discover new things about herself, things she had never previously given a second thought about. For one thing, a mild but obvious romance blooms between her and Zach Taylor (Tristan Wilds), a young African American man who served in the military and dreams of being a lawyer. She admits that she had never envisioned a black man as a lawyer, which is not a sign of intolerance so much as it's a sign of ignorance; in her old life, blacks were uncultured, really nothing more than hired labor (Rosaleen, incidentally, is just as ignorant as Lily in this regard).I never once felt that what developed between Lily and Zach was a case of contrived puppy love; genuine sexuality is trying to emerge here, which is dangerous given the social stigma of interracial relationships in the mid twentieth century. It comes to a head when Zach is publicly arrested for taking Lily to the movies--even though she's inexperienced in matters of romance, she understands all too well that traumatic experiences will change a person, and sometimes not for the better.There's pivotal moment when Lily finally opens up to August, telling her the truth about what happened to her mother. ""I'm unlovable!"" she sobs, believing that she unfairly brought the cruel outside world into a place of kindness and growth. What could easily have been an overwrought outburst is instead a believable, heart-wrenching release of pain. It was a fine line for writer/director Gina Price-Bythewood to walk, and amazingly, she never once fell. She might have wobbled a time or two, especially at the ending, which is perhaps a little too traditional. But in all fairness, the ending is also appropriate given the context of the story. The convincing performances were what really made ""The Secret Life of Bees"" so moving, not just by Fanning, but by everyone. This is a wonderfully life-affirming film, and it can actually teach us something without getting syrupy along the way.",4,The Sweetness in Life,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,5470,"['Secret', 'Life',

1220225,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001NLJ3N0,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[7, 8]","What a wonderful film. The women in this film are amazing, strong, intelligent, loving, gorgeous. The men in this film, aside from two men, are exactly the opposite. And there is the conflict. It's a story told more or less in flashback from Lilly's (Dakota Fanning) perspective. There are two versions available on the DVD, the theatrical and the editor's version. For this review I chose the extended editor's version - nearly 2 hours.Technically, a very fine film. Dialog was recorded perfectly. This film is very much about dialog, so it had to be crystal clear and the director delivered. Use of surround sound was held to a minimum, there isn't the enveloping sound we've come to expect. Each shot was spot on in focus and perfectly exposed. There was only one moment where the camera moved in a random not deliberate fashion - a scene of Lilly laying on the ground viewed from a camera in a tree. Otherwise, the camera work was excellent.Pacing was a tiny bit slow, especially at the difficult half way point. The film didn't develop a lot of rise and fall rythmn in the editing, it kept a pretty consistent speed throughout. This could be an anomoly of the director's cut.This is one of the better transfers to DVD, no compression artifacts visible. The print was a spotless one used for the transfer. There are several special features, deleted scenes, making of, converting the book to film, and a few others. Sorry, after watching the director's cut, I just did not wish to ruin the taste of this film with the bonus features.The music soundtrack is just spectacular. This is music worth listening to outside of the film. Alicia Keys, need I say more?These really are incredible women. They are the story in essence, so the fact that the men are so awful really doesn't make this an anti-male film. On the contrary.Fine performances by all the actresses.

1220226,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B001NLJ3N0,David Bower,"[2, 2]","The story is set in the South during the civil rights era and concerns a young 14 year old girl, Lily Owens, who is plagued by a tragic memory concerning her mother. Circumstances conspire to cause her to run away with the woman who had been caring for her and by chance they stumble upon a location important in the background of her mother.The part of Lily is powerfully played by Dakota Fanning and left me with renewed respect for her remarkable ability as an actress. Lily's caregiver, Rosaleen Daise, capably performed by Jennifer Hudson, seems to be the only person that Lily knows that cares about her and when Rosaleen is brutally attacked the only sensible alternative for Lily seems to be to flee that hostile situation.The movie to this point has been rather brutal and graphic and we decided to stop watching it as it was just too much suffering and evil. I decided to read the reviews and discovered there must be some beauty in there somewhere according to most of the reviews so the following night we took up the film where we had stopped. We're both glad we did because the whole tone of the movie changes as they arrive at their new location; so be patient and give it a chance.Shortly after their arrival they meet three sisters who are locally known as beekeepers. The three sisters, August, played by Queen Latifa, June, played by Alicia Keys, and May, played by Sophie Okonedo take the two runaways into their home and offer them a place of refuge.Fortunately the movie provides an opportunity to get to know the three sisters and develop a loving concern for their well being too. All three parts are beautifully portrayed and draw the viewer into their lives and hopes.In the story, the Civil Rights Act had recently been passed and the nation was just beginning to try to adjust to the new reality. As might be expected some were having more trouble than others and began to act in extreme ways to protest the new law. This complicates the life of a young white girl whose closest friend is a black woman and who has found a home with three black sisters. The intensity of the film may make it difficult for sensitive individuals to watch.It is always tragic when sin and depravity take control of any situation regardless of who is involved. Unfortunately the world has seen every imaginable combination of perpetrator and victim, sin is sin and is deplorable.I recommend this movie with the above word of caution.",5,Dramatic and Intense,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,2441,"['story', 'set', 'South', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'young', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Lily', 'Owens', 'who', 'plagued', 'tragic', 'memory', 'concerning', 'mother', 'Circumstances', 'conspire', 'cause', 'run', 'away', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'caring', 'chance', 'stumble', 'location', 'important', 'background', 'mother.The', 'part', 'Lily', 'powerfully', 'played', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'left', 'renewed', 'respect', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'actress', 'Lily', 'caregiver', 'Rosaleen', 'Daise', 'capably', 'performed', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'Lily', 'cares', 'when', 'Rosaleen', 'brutally', 'attacked', 'only', 'sensible', 'alternative', 'Lily', 'be', 'flee', 'hostile', 'situation.The', 'movie', 'point', 'been', 'rather', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'decided', 'stop', 'watching', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'suffering', 'evil', 'decided', 'read', 'reviews', 'discovered', 'must', 'be', 'beauty', 'somewhere', 'according', 'most', 'reviews', 'following', 'night', 'took', 'up', 'film', 'where', 'had', 'stopped', ""'re"", 'glad', 'did', 'whole', 'tone', 'movie', 'changes', 'arrive', 'new', 'location', 'so', 'be', 'patient', 'give', 'chance.Shortly', 'arrival', 'meet', 'three', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'locally', 'known', 'beekeepers', 'three', 'sisters', 'August', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifa', 'June', 'played', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'May', 'played', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'take', 'two', 'runaways', 'home', 'offer', 'place', 'refuge.Fortunately', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'get', 'know', 'three', 'sisters', 'develop', 'loving', 'concern', 'well', 'being', 'too', 'three', 'parts', 'are', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'draw', 'viewer', 'lives', 'hopes.In', 'story', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Act', 'had', 'recently', 'been', 'passed', 'nation', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'try', 'adjust', 'new', 'reality', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'were', 'having', 'more', 'trouble', 'others', 'began', 'act', 'extreme', 'ways', 'protest', 'new', 'law', 'life', 'young', 'white', 'girl', 'closest', 'friend', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'found', 'home', 'three', 'black', 'sisters', 'intensity', 'film', 'may', 'make', 'difficult', 'sensitive', 'individuals', 'watch.It', 'always', 'tragic', 'when', 'sin', 'depravity', 'take', 'control', 'situation', 'regardless', 'who', 'involved', 'Unfortunately', 'world', 'seen', 'imaginable', 'combination', 'perpetrator', 'victim', 'sin', 'sin', 'deplorable.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'above', 'word', 'caution']",N/A

1220231,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001NLJ3N0,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[10, 17]","A few years ago, I had the pleasure of reading Sue Monk Kidd's bestselling 2002 novel, ""The Secret Life of Bees.""  Lily Owen, the first person narrator, tells the story of her adolescent awakening amidst the turbulent backdrop of the South during the Civil Rights movement in the early 60s.  Growing up during this stirring time myself, I found the novel to be particularly heartfelt and historically accurate especially in the details--Kidd understands the era remembering and reminiscing about the clothing trends, the music and the attitudes with the clear voice of her troubled protagonist.Unfortunately, director Gina Prince-Bythewood fails to achieve what Kidd deftly conveys in her book. Kidd has the liberty to allow her characters to develop on their own from the vantage point of a confused child who bears the burden of life in a loveless household haunted by horrendous flashbacks of her mother arguing vehemently with her father in the exact excruciatingly heart-wrenching moment of maternal and spousal abandonment.  Lily blames herself, but does not fully comprehend the emotional impact on her father until the episode is revisited from a more mature vantage point.  Add to this Hellman-esque Southern Gothic theme the brutal anger radiating from the racial issues of the time and it is no wonder that at 14 years old our white heroine requires the honey-sweet setting/respite provided by the three black bee-keeping sisters in conjunction with the reluctant TLC provided by the quirky, querulous and black Rosaleen, the Owens' determined-to-vote housekeeper.  What Kidd has the luxury to explore over the 300+ pages, Prince-Bythewood must present in less than two hours. Sadly, all the warmth and wonder of adolescence that renders ""The Secret Life of Bees"" a recommended coming-of-age novel is eliminated in this film version where most of the characters are reduced to little more than stereotypes with which all of us are more than a little &lt;yawn> familiar.The exception is Paul Bettany (WimbledonandA Beautiful Mind (Widescreen Awards Edition))who seems to get better with each and every role he plays.  In this he portrays T. Ray, Lily's father who interprets the old adage of sparing the rod and spoiling the child Southern style--punishment for his daughter's transgressions entails her kneeling on uncooked grits for an hour until her knees are bloody and raw.  The very British Bettany does a wonderful job of juxtaposing anger with pain without a hint of his natural origin; his emotions throb like a heart in need of a pacemaker while his eyes burn with the tortured flame of the truly tormented.  Nevertheless, he is the only character with which the audience is allowed to truly connect.The rest of the players are lost in a miasma of honey-glazed sentiment oozing with an extra helping of maple syrup sappiness that digests like a little too many buttermilk pancakes topped with three or four pats of extra-rich farm-churned butter.  The actual pain experienced by the resigned black women in this film seems almost like nothing compared to the overly sweet sensations forced upon the audience.  Instead of archetypal mother figures, these pillars of strength come off as a black offshoot of the Ya-Ya Sisters. No-no.Even little Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)) seems miscast.  With her wildly overly mature eyes and uncomfortable frailness she outlines the character rather than embodies her essence.  All elbows and knees, she has the beaten aspect of an old woman rather than the rebellious back-at-you tenacity of the Lily of the novel.  Her climatic understanding of her mother and father's story does not imbue her with any sense of relief; instead the rushed handling of the civil rights theme with Lily's coming of age comes across as hurried and frenetic wasting all those adolescent moments of jutting joints and awkward appendages that could have displayed to better advantage the idea of the character's dysfunction.Director Prince-Bythewood should have stretched out the material in a mini-series format for PBS where the strength of the girl's musings would have had the chance to enlighten the audience to all of her nuanced angst.  The Boatright sisters would have had more of a chance to be real women rather than the colorful bits of Americana we see but don't experience without that overly sweet aftertaste that sickeningly remains in our minds and mouths while viewing a film that could have been much more. Queen Latifah is a mellow, sun-diffused Queen Latifah whose voice drones quietly like the buzz of one of her bees. Jennifer Hudson as Rosaleen needed more edge and much less pretty softness while Alicia Keyes as the meticulous June character could have done with just the opposite.Bottom line?  ""The Secret Life of Bees"" failed on many levels. Director Prince-Bythewood's handling of Monk Kidd's material reduced the story for me to little more than stereotypical themes and characters that have been explored many times before and in much better ways--just think of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee.  In fact, after viewing this film, I actually found myself wondering just what I did find so endearing about the book and to my dismay I discovered that many of Monk Kidd's plot devices are reused in her other novels and not with the greatest effectiveness--the idea of motherhood, a coven of sisters, budding romance and coming-of-age are again looked at in ""The Mermaid's Chair"" even though this yarn features a middle-aged woman rather than a young teenager.  Uncomfortably cloying, this film is recommended only as filler to an otherwise boring afternoon.  Read the book instead . . . no, on second thought, read and watch the classic ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Buzz-less in Sixties South Carolina,1224374400,"10 19,

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[0, 0]","It is a truth universally acknowledge that a precocious teen coming of age in the Southern civil rights era, as Dakota Fanning is in ""The Secret Life of Bees"" with an alcoholic, abusive dad, is in need of a moral compass.  And you could do a lot worse than say, Queen Latifah, Alicia Keys and Sophie Okonedo, all of whom provide the life lessons here.  They do a decent job, but could have used a better script.  Though I've never read the bestseller it's based on, so I don't know how true to the book it stays.Fanning does a good job, as well.  She emotes.  She cries.  She learns life lessons.  When she gets really upset, she starts hurling honey jars and blunt accusations, but those moments are short lived and then the sun comes out again.  Like most young girls in movies who are poor, uneducated and abused, she is articulate and profound about her circumstances and the world around her.  What she doesn't know, she learns from her mentors, the African American Boatwright sisters, who take her and her housekeeper Rosaleen, (Jennifer Hudson), in, after they flee an abusive stepfather and a group of racists who attempt to keep Hudson from registering to vote.  How do they find the Boatwrights?  Well, Fanning's mom has some mysterious connection, and also they find a jar of honey with a black Madonna on it and wonder about the producers of it.  Also, they don't have many other options.Queen Latifah plays the head of the household, and makes bee-keeping, which she teaches to Fanning, look like a rather Zen job.  No one gets stung because the secret is respecting the bees and sending them love.  Unfortunately, things are a lot stickier, if not downright bitter, in the outside world.  More racism rears its head and more life lessons are learned, mostly by Fanning.  It's a sweet movie, but the pace lags and most of the Caucasian roles are stereotypes (though yes, there were plenty of racists back then).  As other reviewers have mentioned, it might have worked better as a TV movie or a mini-seriesThe director has obviously mastered Symbolism 101, and the bees are just the start.  The cornbread alone gets at least three close-ups.  In my opinion, the food stylists should have gotten their credits prominently displayed.  If nothing else, the movie will put you in the mood to raid the concession stand, but there's more to it than that.  It just could have been done a lot better.  And remember, next time you see a bee, don't swat it away.  Send it love instead.  All living things want to receive love.

1220242,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001NLJ3N0,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","THE SECRET LIFE OF BEESThis film is absolutely one of the best all [pretty much] female cast movies I have seen in a while. I remember seeing the trailers for this and thinking ""YEAH another flick with the great Queen Latifah"", and it didn't hurt that Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, and Sophie Okonedo were in since they have been great actors in every other film they appeared in. The only thing I was worried about was Dakota Fanning, since most child stars can't bring the same confidence and talent to the game like they once did when trying to make it into young adult roles. Still I did not doubt her and was kinda excited to see if she could pull it, I am happy to say that she was just as good as the great women who were cast in this film as well.The story is centered around a young 14 year old girl named Lily Owens [Fanning] along with her friend and family employee Rosaleen Daise [Hudson] on a journey to find a place her deceased mother once lived. They set out on this journey after Rosaleen is beat by a group of white men who still have it in their minds to kill her in her while even in the hospital. Lily is a determined yet broken girl who is internally dieing by the fact that her mother left her as young girl, although we find out later there is much more to the story. Her dad is an abusive man who seems to not care about his daughter at all, the grits thing is horrible. Upon finding this place she meets the residents who are three wonderful but very different sisters [Latifah, Keys, and Okonedo] who run and operate a honey business out of their home. They are welcomed by two of the three [although she comes around] and begin to not only live with them but work there as well. It is here that the films true beauty truly takes place as these women young and old all come together and form a bond that transcends age, social status, and race.Films such as this have always been favorites of mine, this, Fried Green Tomatoes and such, maybe it is the time period they are based in or maybe it is just the wonderful stories of the human spirit [good and bad], but I am a fan. Producers Will and Jada Pinkett Smith have chosen a wonderful book to adapt to film, the novel is by Sue Monk Kidd for those wanting to read the source material. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood did a marvelous job converting the book into a feature film, the dialogue was great and the characters were magnificent. Some may say the film is slow at times but I thought it moved at a great pace and the character development was superb.As far as performances go Queen Latifah as August Boatwright the matriarch of the family and household should have been up for an Oscar for this one, much like she should have in the past for many others. She played August as a strong proud woman unafraid of a cold world outside, but you could tell she was strong for her sisters since a fourth had passed. On the flip side is June Boatwright played excellently by Alicia Keys who is a woman who on the outside is strong but really it's only a front to keep the world outside at bay, this is evident by the way she treats her would be fianc&eacute;e. Keys is wonderful in this part a comes across as mean spirited in moments when she should but by the end makes a natural transition into an excepting kind hearted warm gentle person. The other sister May Boatwright played so extremely good by Sophie Okonedo has a little something wrong with her and is struggling to accept her sister being dead. If fact if anything goes wrong she begins to break down and can only find comfort in the form of writing, she puts these thoughts she jots down in and on a rock wall out in their yard. Sophie is amazing in this part that seemed she was destined to play, this is just one more to the many great female performances in this film.Jennifer Hudson much like the others is brilliant in this film as the down and out Rosaleen Daise who is recovering from a brutal beating and a long journey only to end up with people she does not know. Hudson once again proves why she really is one of the most talented actresses in the game and also proves to the nay sayers that the Oscar she won [Dream Girls] was not a fluke as some said. And then there is Dakota Fanning as the emotionally unstable Lily Owens, I must say that Fanning was excellent in this role and played it perfectly. I really think she is here to stay and is the next big female leading lady once she gets out of her teens. Until then though I am sure she will be the lead in all of next generation teen comedies and dramas for that age range. This movie is full of magnificent female characters and performers to help craft them.At first glance one might pass on this saying it is just a chick flick or whatever but I must say that would be a mistake. If you miss out on this one you are missing out on some of the greatest cinematic performances ever, not to mention it was shot beautifully and has a wonderful soundtrack. From interesting characters to a great story all can be found here, and on a side note everyone else who was in this film did great jobs as well. Especially Paul Bettany who played Lilly's dad T. Ray Owens, his character was not the nicest guy ever.",5,EXCELLENT FEMALE CAST,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,5213,"['SECRET', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'BEESThis', 'film', 'absolutely', 'one', 'best', '[',

Over time, you learn about why a teenage girl had to escape from her abusive father, why he was abusive in the first place, and the pains of the women who parented that teenager when she ran away.

There was a mystical element also, made visible in the strange ship's figurehead which became the focal point of worship services in the Pepto-Bismol-colored house in which sisters June, May and August Boatwright lived.It would take an extraordinary movie to fully capture the love and sense of safety that the Boatwright house represented during the choppy seas of the desegregation era. The movie version of the ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" alas, is not the extraordinary movie I was hoping for. But it was as close as any mass media movie will get. The secret to its success is its casting. Queen Latifah was pitch-perfect as the solid matriarch, August. Alicia Keys brought her musician's sensibility to skittishly reticent June. And Sophie Okonedo deserves awards for her portrayal of the hyper-sensitive May. This last sister could easily have become a caricature, but Okonedo played her with intelligence and charm -- as well as tragic fragility. Finally, Dakota Fanning shone as Lily Owens, the white girl running from a loveless and brutal home life.The major flaw of ""Bees"" was that it tried too faithfully to include nearly every element of the book. Readers will recognize many of the book's characters and situations. Unfortunately, some of these -- notably the town's sympathetic white lawyer and the kooky cluster of women who worshipped with the Boatwrights -- get short shrift in the film and might have been cut out. Worse, the soul of the movie -- the shipwrecked ""Mary"" to which the sisters pray -- is shunted to the side. Weirdly, the chains she wore in the book, a symbol of her oppression and her resistance to it, and metaphor for the struggles of many of the story's characters, were omitted.Not a perfect movie, but ""The Secret Life of Bees"" included enough of the heart of the book to bring tears to my eyes more than once.

The actual beekeeping details were brief, but the story enticed me in. It's a 3 or 4 hanky emotional roller coaster about race relations in the 50's-60's South, domestic violence, inadvertent matricide, suicide, racism, personal discovery, redemption & a Black Madonna. Yes, a Black Madonna! It's almost too much to squeeze into 90 minutes, but you sure get your money's worth.The Black Madonna is introduced first as a product logo on jars of honey produced by a positively radiant Queen Latifah (mixing Royal Jelly with her Cover Girl?) Then we are told the story behind the logo. A carved log was washed ashore & found to be the carving of a Black Virgin Mary--how Gnostic can you get? The statue has an exposed heart & a small band of African-American women hold impromptu services around it, concluding by each one touching the heart.NOTE: For people who don't know what I'm rambling on about, the image of the Black Madonna represents the Virgin Mary, yes--but from a Gnostic perspective it can also represent Mary Magdalene. Incidentally, the bee was the selected emblem of Napoleon, but I don't think that has any relevance in this story.All the actors are outstanding & Dakota Fanning is quite affective in the role of the conflicted white girl who finds her self & love in the company of fascinating (and gorgeous) black women. I also give a special nod to the actor who played the cruel father. It was sort of a thankless role, but he played it well.This movie is a MUST SEE.PS. Actually, I did get a pointer or two about beekeeping. There was one scene I really appreciated. The Bee Lady & the girl are standing next to the hives but there are no bees to be seen. When the girl asks where they are, the Bee Lady suggests she put her ear against the top of the wood enclosure. The girl hears a noise coming from the hive. The Bee Lady tells her it's the sound of thousands of wings ""air conditioning"" the hive from the warm summer weather.

1220260,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B001NLJ3N0,Jem,"[1, 1]","When I saw this film advertised, I wanted to see it because I like all the actresses.  However, I didn't think it was a ""theatre"" movie.  So I waited for DVD thinking the film would not be improved by seeing it on the big screen, which was the case.  In fact, I think I enjoyed it more for being able to curl up on my sofa with it like I would with a good book.  I will watch it again, so it's worth owning.  Another plus, despite it being only a single disc edition, it has pretty good extras on it!  There are featurettes on: behind the scenes, character studies, a tour of the set with the book author and more.  They are all worth watching, unlike so many extras that are thrown on so they can say there are extras (trailers!? please.)I have not read the book.  But, after seeing the movie I now want to read it - which says a lot about how good it was.  I love Queen Latifah, and she is known for good comedy roles, but I was struck by just how strong an actress she is.  This role required subtle acting and she delivered.  Often films set in this time period are mired in sadness and violence.  This film shows the ugly part of racism, but doesn't dwell on it.  The emphasis is more heartwarming.  That's not to say it won't have you in tears at certain moments, for tragic reasons and for happy.  Sometimes, the film goes over-the-top in pulling at heart strings and can be a bit over sentimental.  However, I can forgive that since this isn't a popcorn movie.  It's the story of one girl, and the women who come to shape her life.  I considered giving it five stars, but realized that even though I liked it, it just wasn't up to the standard of films likeThe Color Purple.  As an adaptation, TCP was stunning and the scale was nearly epic in the telling.It's almost ironic that all three of the main actresses are first and foremost known as singers, yet each delivered an excellent performance that made me believe they were the character.  Jennifer Hudson should consider dropping the music and concentrating on film - I'd certainly like to see more of her.

Totally frustrated with her abusive father and pushed over the edge by his beating of Rosaleen, their African-American housekeeper, fourteen-year-old Lily runs away with Rosaleen in tow.  Seeking some knowledge of her mother, whom Lily accidentally shot and killed when she was four, she heads toward the only place she knows may have some connection to her.  Lily and Rosaleen are taken in by the three African-American Boatwright sisters, August, June, and May, who have a prosperous honey business.  August teaches Lily to care for the bees and the women help Lily to heal.  I appreciate the honesty of the film that is exemplified when August tells Lily what she knows of her mother and of love.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[0, 0]","Note: The zeros were cast by a troll and her gang, not real and decent people, and are against me personally and not the book or the review!If you loved the novel,The Secret Life of Beesby Sue Monk Kidd, then you will love ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" the movie starring Queen Latifah, Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys, and Sophie Okoneda.It's all there--what you loved in the book, you will love in the movie. The casting is absolutely perfect. Dakota Fanning has grown literally and figuratively from a precocious child actor to a budding young woman, going beyond adorable to nuanced acting. Those eyes--she can say so much with her facial expressions. I am very much impressed.Queen Latifah has long been one of my favorite people. She carries herself with such dignity, a trait so necessary in playing August, the matriarchal sister of the Boatwright clan, makers of honey, and giver of the title of the book and movie. The scene in which August and Lily (Dakota) listen to the sound of bees cooling their hive shows August with such joy on her face, a joy, a delight, a secret sharing with God's creatures--another bit of nuanced acting, this time by Queen.The great aspect of the movie is that Director Gina Prince-Bythewood (also co-writer of the script with the author) did not change anything in the book. It's all there. However, the scene with the Black Madonna was not as intense in the movie as it was for me in the novel. Also, the racial ugliness in the novel was more intense (for me), but I think lessened in the movie to show the ugliness of racism without going to extremes.Isn't it wonderful to find a true adaptation from words on pages to visual images on screen? ""The Secret Life of Bees"" certainly made that transition with grace and dignity and compassion. This is an excellent story of people finding joy in simple things and love within the family circle, a circle large and strong enough to enfold a new member. Cheers all around!An interesting side note is that Jada Pinket-Smith and Will Smith, along with others, produced the film.",5,A close adaptation of the novel,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,2073,"['Note', 'zeros', 'were', 'cast', 'troll', 'gang', 'not', 'real', 'decent', 'people', 'are', 'personally', 'not', 'book', 'review', 'loved', 'novel', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Beesby', 'Sue', 'Monk', 'Kidd', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Bees', 'movie', 'starring', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'Alicia', 'Keys', 'Sophie', 'Okoneda.It', 'there', 'what', 'loved', 'book', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'casting', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'grown', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'precocious', 'child', 'actor', 'budding', 'young', 'woman', 'going', 'adorable', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'eyes', 'can', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'facial', 'expressions', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'impressed.Queen', 'Latifah', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'people', 'such', 'dignity', 'trait', 'so', 'necessary', 'playing', 'August', 'matriarchal', 'sister', 'Boatwright', 'clan', 'makers', 'honey', 'giver', 'title', 'book', 'movie', 'scene', 'August', 'Lily', 'Dakota', 'sound', 'bees', 'cooling', 'hive', 'shows', 'August', 'such', 'joy', 'face', 'joy', 'delight', 'secret', 'sharing', 'God', 'creatures', 'bit', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'time', 'Queen.The', 'great', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Director', 'Gina', 'Prince-Bythewood', 'also', 'co-writer', 'script', 'author', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'anything', 'book', 'there', 'However', 'scene', 'Black', 'Madonna', 'was', 'not', 'intense', 'movie', 'was', 'novel', 'Also', 'racial', 'ugliness', 'novel', 'was', 'more', 'intense', 'think', 'lessened', 'movie', 'show', 'ugliness', 'racism', 'going', 'extremes.Is', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'find', 'true', 'adaptation', 'words', 'pages', 'visual', 'images', 'screen', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Bees', 'certainly', 'made', 'transition', 'grace', 'dignity', 'compassion', 'excellent', 'story', 'people', 'finding', 'joy', 'simple', 'things', 'love', 'family', 'circle', 'circle', 'large', 'strong', 'enough', 'enfold', 'new', 'member', 'Cheers', 'around', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'Jada', 'Pinket-Smith', 'Will', 'Smith', 'others', 'produced', 'film']",N/A

Having just made the statement that I didn't love it, I'll try to share why I didn't. I haven't read the complete novel. I began it and was intrigued and caught up, but had borrowed it and needed to return it. Now that I own it, I just haven't gone back to pick up the story beyond page seventy. The seventy pages I read seemed to mirror what I experienced in the film, so I think the overall life of the story translated well to film.I found some of the characters to be stereotypical and broken down into clear categories...unflappable, strong, backbone of the family, confused and out-of-control teen, angry, bitter man, overtly helpful white guy, angry woman. May Boatwright (Sophie Okonedo) was the most complex character and added much to the story.And I think the movie  moved a little too fast not giving me a chance to really care about the characters. Not that the drama wasn't horrific...it was...a sad and senseless accidental death that left a huge hole in Lily's life (Dakota Fanning), a father who had grown so bitter there wasn't room in his shriveled heart for his daughter, ugly, brutal racism, lives that were shaped and devastated by the choices of others. The subject matter was hard and awful. This film should've sucker punched me. I'm a crier. I cry at happy, sad and poignant scenes in many movies. Even commercials have brought me to tears, yet I didn't cry during the Secret Life of Bees, and I only teared up once.In many ways the film is well done.

He mesmerizes, and this was not a starring role.  The simple line:  ""Because she didn't come after me.""  Takes my breath away.Of course, the period, 1964 immediately following LBJ's signing of the Civil Rights Act, an important time, brings this to the fore with it's still virulent racial hatred.

I'm not unfamiliar with the appellation chauvinist either, so I have few qualms admitting I would ogle Alicia Keys even if she couldn't sing and Sophie Okenedo is the only reason my copy of Aeon Flux hasn't become a coaster.  Jennifer Hudson isn't much of an actress yet but it's hard to deny she has the voice of a Homeric siren and Queen Latifah when she reverts to Dana Owens is a pure jazz songstress.I was curious to see how Tristan Wilds comported himself in a role so radically diverse from his inner city survivalist of The Wire, however I rail against what I interpret to be celluloid chick lit, particularly when it encompasses a whitewashed revision of 60's era civil rights, infused with the sentimentality of paternalistic traditionalism.Let's not allow the laminated veneer of strength of character applied to Queen Latifah's matriarchal role subvert the underlying message of residual ante-bellum conventionalism. In fact, it is not difficult to attribute the same assimilative characteristic each of the black females by the conclusion of the movie.  Jennifer Hudson is spirited, resistant to overt oppression yet she is obeisant to a 14 year old white child. Keys character is intended to convey the burgeoning concepts of black identity and outward expressiveness of self-worth, right up to the point she is won over by this sweet little urchin seeking only the pure love and affection of others. Okenedo is a virtual empath who absorbs the pain of all who come into her sphere.I am also expected to believe in  the post-Till era not one of these women, including his mother or for that matter, the stereotypical liberal white attorney, has any inclination to counsel a young black man of the perils of even the perception of infatuation with a young nubile blond-haired white girl in South Carolina. Mammy or mammies, if you will, is one thing but the historical record also indicates black women who were inadvertently relegated to that status also had the presence to warn their progeny of the dangers associated with rebellious reactions to white privilege, and assuredly would not turn a blind eye.If I find any merit in this film, it is the contrast to vaudevillian screenplays typified by the bulk of Tyler Perry's superficial big screen farces.

Tagliaferro,"[2, 3]","It was an all-star cast, featuring a dark, intense, and maturing Dakota Fanning, a book recommendation by Oprah Winfrey, and my own perceived expectations that gave so much promise to The Secret Life of Bees.  There is something irresistible about the classic story of a young girl looking for love, and Lily Owen's plight was wholeheartedly felt, especially since she was also looking for a connection to her deceased mother, whom she never knew.What she finds is an unconventional family, an escape from an abusive past, and a place of belonging.  But this story is not all sugar and spice - or honey.  The turmoil of her inner conflict was replaced by the turmoil of the civil rights era, scenes which are unbelievable in this day and age, but all too real for the south in the 1960's.This combination of innocence, emotional drama and violent history was destined to be a hit, but I felt it was lacking in impact, revelation, and comic relief.  While May was plagued with depression, June experienced relationship problems, and August wisely dominated her family nest -- and hives, a little more humor in their everyday interactions would have been more entertaining.  Perhaps it was there, and I missed it, since it was hard to understand some of the characters' lines, but humor in the backdrop of the darker events would have made the film more emotionally compelling and helped to move it along.But while it was missing in overall conviction, it was a sweet and comforting story about heartache, endurance, and love.  Young Lily came full-circle, yet there was no surprise to her past.  It is stated at the beginning, and in the intense concluding conversation with her father, there was no twist, only a very brief and not very convincing glimpse of compassion between father and daughter.  When Dad said ""Good riddance,"" they were perhaps the nicest two words Lily ever heard from him as they left her free in her mother's world.",3,High Expectations,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1939,"['was', 'all-star', 'cast', 'featuring', 'dark', 'intense', 'maturing', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'book', 'recommendation', 'Oprah', 'Winfrey', 'own', 'perceived', 'expectations', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'Secret', 'Life', 'Bees', 'something', 'irresistible', 'classic', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'looking', 'love', 'Lily', 'Owen', 'plight', 'was', 'wholeheartedly', 'felt', 'especially', 'was', 'also', 'looking', 'connection', 'deceased', 'mother', 'whom', 'never', 'knew.What', 'unconventional', 'family', 'escape', 'abusive', 'past', 'place', 'belonging', 'story', 'not', 'sugar', 'spice', 'honey', 'turmoil', 'inner', 'conflict', 'was', 'replaced', 'turmoil', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'scenes', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'day', 'age', 'too', 'real', 'south', ""1960's.This"", 'combination', 'innocence', 'emotional', 'drama', 'violent', 'history', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'hit', 'felt', 'was', 'lacking', 'impact', 'revelation', 'comic', 'relief', 'May', 'was', 'plagued', 'depression', 'June', 'experienced', 'relationship', 'problems', 'August', 'wisely', 'dominated', 'family', 'nest', 'hives', 'little', 'more', 'humor', 'everyday', 'interactions', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'there', 'missed', 'was', 'hard', 'understand', 'characters', 'lines', 'humor', 'backdrop', 'darker', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'helped', 'move', 'along.But', 'was', 'missing', 'overall', 'conviction', 'was', 'sweet', 'comforting', 'story', 'heartache', 'endurance', 'love', 'Young', 'Lily', 'came', 'full-circle', 'yet', 'was', 'surprise', 'past', 'stated', 'beginning', 'intense', 'concluding', 'conversation', 'father', 'was', 'twist', 'only', 'very', 'brief', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'glimpse', 'compassion', 'father', 'daughter', 'When', 'Dad', 'said', 'Good', 'riddance', 'were', 'perhaps', 'nicest', 'two', 'words', 'Lily', 'ever', 'heard', 'left', 'free', 'mother', 'world']",N/A

My DVD was defective--it kept freezing at a certain point in the movie. The beginning had some pixelation and skips. Fortunately Amazon has a very easy return policy, so I was able to get a fast refund.The movie is superb and the actresses portraying these women were excellent. I liked the fact that it followed the book pretty faithfully, so kudos to the scriptwriters. In spite of racial tension and violence, August Boatwright owned several acres of land and ran a successful honey business in Tiburon, SC. Not too many women, especially black women, ran their own business back in the 1960's, so August was a pioneer of sorts. Queen Latifah is so great at playing these strong, dignified, intelligent women, and she does not disappoint with her portrayal of August Boatwright. Dakota Fanning was wonderful as Lily Owens, along with Jennifer Hudson as her nanny Rosaleen Daise, Alicia Keyes as June Boatwright and Sophie Okonedo as May.There are some delightful extras, such as a commentary track by Queen Latifah, Dakota Fanning, and one of the screenwriters and producers. You learn a lot about how a movie is made listening to them, plus learn some of the backstory behind this wonderful film.While the Civil Rights Movement/racial tensions serves as a backdrop for the film, it is really a coming-of-age story for Lily.

1220301,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001NLJ3N0,RMurray847,"[18, 20]","I read THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES by Sue Monk Kidd about two years ago.  I enjoyed the book very much because it nicely evoked a sense of place (the rural south, with its humidity, ramshackle houses, lush flora and fauna) and it also created very vivid characters.  It also suffered from a couple of unlikely coincidences and sometimes a bit too much sentimentality.  It didn't trust the power it had built up to successfully tug at our heartstrings and evoke tears without just a little bit of extra obvious manipulation.  I found it brisk, involving reading but a little short of classic status.The film is almost exactly the same.  While I don't remember tiny details of the book, and thus no doubt there are some ""key"" scenes missing, the film is very faithful to the plot of the book and its characters.  It captures both the strengths and weaknesses of the book quite well.  Frankly, if you like (or love) the book, then you should be quite content with how it has been translated.  If you are unfamiliar with the book, you should have some of the same reactions to the film as I described about the book above.The story is set in 1964.  14-year-old Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning) is a mature beyond her years girl in South Carolina.  She carries a heavy burden.  Ten years previously, while watching a fight between her mother and her abusive father, she accidentally fired a gun.  The bullet killed her mother.  Her mother, who was in the process of leaving her father and also, she fears, leaving her.  This has left a hole in Lily, because she's torn between her fantasies of a loving mother that she has killed and a her fears that her mother was about to abandon her to her awful father.  Lily's housekeeper Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) is somewhat friendly with the smart, inquisitive Lily (a girl who loves to write in her journal) and one day the two are walking somewhat companionably to town.  Lily needs to stop by the store...Rosaleen is on her way to register to vote now that President Johnson has signed the Civil Rights Act.  The redneck bigots in town figure out Rosaleen's intentions, and a confrontation ensures in which Rosaleen insults the men and they, in turn, attack her.Lily seizes on the opportunity to rescue Rosaleen from the hospital, where she is recovering prior to her imprisonment.  Lily takes Rosaleen to the town of Tiburon, SC...the only clue she has to where her mother might have come from.  With little money and only a vague notion of her approach, the two runaways are taken in by a family of sisters who run a honey harvesting operation.  It is amongst these women that Lily (and Rosaleen) learn some important lessons about life, learn to feel a sense of belonging, and ultimately, perhaps for Lily, learn about the fate of loved ones.There are three Boatwright sisters:  August (Queen Latifah) the eldest, who runs the business and dispenses worldly advice and tough love in that way only Queen Latifah can.  There is June (Alicia Keys) the stern music-teacher who has put up a pretty heavy emotional armor.  She's clearly enamored of her boyfriend Neil, a fellow teacher, but refuses to fully release herself to him.  Finally, there is May (Sophie Okonedo), who is the most warm-hearted, kind person you'd care to meet, but she is also tormented by inner demons.  I don't want to give away too much about May, because discovering the truth behind her afflictions is one of the joys of the story.Suffice it to say that the film takes these characters and first shows how the civil rights movement affects them.  Lily learns firsthand some harsh lessons about hatred.  But it is far, far more interested in showing us how these women (and the men who buzz around them) grow and change...but also how strength takes on many different aspects, and how these different forms of strength can help others with their weaknesses and fears.It's a brightly lit movie.  It practically beams...much as Queen Latifah spends so much time beaming.  It's full of metaphors (many dealing with bees, of course)...and sometimes it is just a bit heavy-handed.  August Boatwright is sometimes just a little TOO wise and understanding.  Lily is sometimes just a smidge to precocious.  June is sometimes a little TOO hardened.  And unfortunately, the ending is just a little too pat and convenient.  In ""real life,"" this story would have played out with more mess and more collateral damage.Yet it's still so nice to see a movie that wants to embrace you with good feelings...realism be damned.  Come enjoy these lively women, it says.  Get swept up in their characters.  That's what the book wanted to do, and that's what the film does.This is accomplished mostly by virtue of some really, really nice performances.  Queen Latifah, in many ways, fares the worst, because this is a character that was almost written to be played by her.  We see her doing very little that is new for her...but she's so good at this character that we draw some comfort from the familiarity.  She does have one devastating scene involving another of her sisters that shows she is ready to take another step as an actress.  Alicia Keys looks lovely and gives a focused performance...more than anyone, her character seems to belong squarely in 1964...from her clothes to her attitude.  Jennifer Hudson is fine as Rosaleen...it's no longer a curiosity that this former American Idol can act...she can and should.  Her character somewhat falls by the wayside in the 2nd half of the film...but in our glimpses of her, we still see how she has grown and changed.  Sophie Okonedo, who was so good in HOTEL RWANDA, is fabulous here.  When she is on screen, she just bursts with life and energy and you simply can't take your eyes off of her.  Whether her eyes are sparkling with loving mischief, or glazing over in dismay...she fully invests herself in the work.Finally, I'm happy to say that Dakota Fanning is still reliably good.  I would say she's going to make the transition from child star to teen star with little effort.  She's the real deal as an actress.THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES may not win major awards or become a much-beloved classic...but it IS an outstandingly evocative film that is so well acted.  I'd recommend it for anyone willing to spend time with some really interesting women...AND I'd recommend it to audiences aged 13 and above.  I think that young teen girls, in particular, might take a special liking to the film.",4,"5 outstanding performances in this warm-hearted, life-affirming film.",1224374400,"10 19,

It's focus is 13-year-old Lily Owens (played with a deft emotional range, by Dakota Fanning). The film takes place in 1964 in the southern US, during the birth of the civil rights movement.Lily is haunted by the fact that she accidentally shot her mother, when playing with a pistol as a toddler. She also develops a strange affinity for bees, which is bewildering to her. Lily's violent father is abusive towards her. The Owen's black housekeeper Rosaleen, is a mother figure and confidante to Lily.One day, Lily goes to town with Rosaleen, when Rosaleen plans on registering to vote. Racist white men confront them, taunting Rosaleen. When Rosaleen refuses to tolerate their behavior, the men give her a vicious beating. The police soon intervene. Rosaleen is arrested, and held in custody at the medical ward of the local jail.Outraged at what happened to Rosaleen, Lily goes to the jail and frees Rosaleen, before the guards find out. Lily and Rosaleen then hit the road, leaving Lily's brutal father far behind. The two come upon a store in a small town, which stocks jars of honey. Intrigued with the unusual labeling on the honey jars, Lily asks the clerk where the honey comes from. She's told that the Boatwright sisters make the honey.Lily then asks the clerk, where they can find the Boatwright sisters. And she's told that they reside in a huge, 'bright pink' house, a 'ways up the road'. So, Lily feels strangely compelled to find the Boatwrights, for reasons that she doesn't quite understand.After traveling a long way, Lily and Rosaleen spot a bright pink house, in a remote area. Tired, hungry and needing shelter, they knock on the door of this house. The three women who answer introduce themselves as the Boatwright sisters, named May, June, and August.At first, the Boatwrights are reluctant to take in Lily and Rosaleen. They relent, when they realize that the two have no where else to turn. August, the eldest sister, lets Lily become their beekeeping apprentice. Rosaleen is allowed to stay on as the Boatwright's housekeeper. While living with the Boatwrights, Lily unravels the mysteries of her dead mother. Much to her astonishment, Lily discovers how the Boatwrights are deeply involved in her mother's past.Above all, this film celebrates love, and its power to transform human lives in amazing ways. The brilliant performances by the female leads, make this movie the gem that it truly is. Films with strong, positive women in leading roles, are still not as common as they should be.

The picture is headed by an all-star cast of women, directed and written for the screen by Gina Prince-Blythewood, based on a best-selling novel of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd.According to the studio that made it,  Fox Searchlight Pictures, as quoted in the Internet Movie Database, it is "" set in South Carolina in 1964, this is the tale of Lily Owens a 14 year-old girl who is haunted by the memory of her late mother. To escape her lonely life and troubled relationship with her father, Lily flees with Rosaleen, her caregiver and only friend, to a South Carolina town that holds the secret to her mother's past. Taken in by the intelligent and independent Boatwright sisters, Lily finds solace in their mesmerizing world of beekeeping.""A young Dakota Fanning, (I Am Sam), gives us a beautifully fleshed out and nuanced performance as Lily, who believes she is responsible for her mother's death,  and runs away from the farm of her father.  T. Ray Owens, as played by Paul Bettany, (Margin Call), a handsome young actor who was once tipped for a matinee idol future, but somehow became mainly a portrayer of villains instead.  Rosaleen Daise, is played by the Academy Award winning Jennifer Hudson, (Dreamgirls), who, despite the mistreatment she receives from onscreen racists, is never less than dignified.  The Boatwright sisters, August, Queen Latifah (Chicago,Hairspray), June, (Alicia Keys) (Smokin' Aces), and May, (Sophie Okonedo), (Hotel Rwanda) produce the area's locally famous Black Madonna honey and can find room in their home, oddly painted a Pepto-Bismol pink,  and their hearts, for two distraught runaways.Director/screenwriter Prince- Blythewood has done well.  Each of the actors delivers strong performances, with particular praise to Fanning and Okonedo.  The cinematography ably captures the sweet lush landscapes of Wilmington, North Carolina and its outlying towns of Lumberton and Watha, where it was made; the area where I am lucky enough now to live.  The picture, set in the extreme racial tension of the 1960s South, certainly to be found then in South Carolina, is touching, emotional, sentimental, and tender.  Nevertheless, it does not seem to want to give its viewers a history lesson, but only to tell a moving story from which viewers can draw their own conclusions.

It was the first show on the release day and there were only six others in the whole movie theater. However, that fact was not indicative of the movie's worth.It was a very moving, yet joyful movie, set in the backdrop of racial tensions and violence of 1964 in South Carolina. Fourteen year old Lily (Dakota Fanning) flees her abusive father along with her caregiver Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) who is battered for claiming her rights as a colored woman.  Lily is also fleeing from her fussy and haunting memories of accidentally shooting her mother to death, during an abusive tussle between the couple. Guided by a honey bottle label they reach the Boatwright sisters. August (Queen Latifah) the oldest among the Boatwrights welcomes the fugitives. They put them to work in the mesmerizing world of bee keeping. Lily grows in loving admiration for the maternal figure of August and learns more about her own mother and her deep love for Lily.Dakota Fanning does a superb job of portraying the abused, at the same time, assertive Lily of fourteen years. All the other cast members do justice to their roles, though Queen Latifah, as a caring maternal figure to Lily and queen of the Boatwright beehive, is less convincing.  Overall, the movie tastes sweet in the mouth, but leaves a lump in the throat.  It's sure to appeal more to female audiences.
