728726,A26KYDJOAGI05S,B00007GZPE,Audiaa,"[2, 2]","This workout DVD has three sections.  The first is 30 min. of ""fat blasting"" yoga, the second is 15 min. of strength yoga, and the third is 15 min. of core strengthening using a stability ball.The first yoga section is much too fast to be yoga, but doesn't move enough to be a cardio section.  There are several segments of different types of poses like tree pose and warrior pose, but you don't really get a chance to hold any of the poses.  Between each segment Denise quickly runs through a sun salutation.  By the end I was just thinking `oh no, not again.'  There is little chance to learn the poses or the routines that Denise goes through really quickly.  They're not really that hard, but in some of the positions it is hard to see what she is doing, and she doesn't give very good cues.  Some of the moves and positions are quite difficult or you have to be pretty flexible to do them, and there are no alternatives.  During one of the segments, I just sat there, but I couldn't think of an alternative way to do the exercise.  I wouldn't say that most of the moves are too difficult for beginners, but going through it the first time was harder than it is for other yoga programs such as the yoga zone series.The strength segment was a lot of fast lunges and fast balancing poses.  It was much like the previous section only faster.  The second and third segments could be put together for a shorter workout or the first segment done alone.I liked the stability ball segment and wished that it were longer.  There were a lot of unique exercises for abs and glutes, but again Denise goes through the moves very quickly and there is time only for a few repetitions of each move.  The workout ends abruptly without any real cool down.  Usually I feel relaxed after doing yoga, but not after this workout.  All in all, I found the entire workout too long.  There wasn't enough yoga for it to be yoga and there wasn't enough strength or cardio for it to be either of those either, and Denise talks constantly through the entire thing.  If you can get past that, the DVD does keep you moving for an hour and that can't be all bad.",3,Not Really Yoga,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,2134,"['workout', 'DVD', 'three', 'sections', 'first', '30', 'min', 'fat', 'blasting', 'yoga', 'second', '15', 'min', 'strength', 'yoga', 'third', '15', 'min', 'core', 'strengthening', 'using', 'stability', 'ball.The', 'first', 'yoga', 'section', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'be', 'yoga', ""n't"", 'move', 'enough', 'be', 'cardio', 'section', 'are', 'several', 'segments', 'different', 'types', 'poses', 'tree', 'pose', 'warrior', 'pose', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'hold', 'poses', 'Between', 'segment', 'Denise', 'quickly', 'sun', 'salutation', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'thinking', 'oh', 'not', 'again', 'little', 'chance', 'learn', 'poses', 'routines', 'Denise', 'really', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'hard', 'positions', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'doing', ""n't"", 'give', 'very', 'good', 'cues', 'moves', 'positions', 'are', 'quite', 'difficult', 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'flexible', 'do', 'are', 'alternatives', 'one', 'segments', 'just', 'sat', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'alternative', 'way', 'do', 'exercise', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'most', 'moves', 'are', 'too', 'difficult', 'beginners', 'going', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'harder', 'other', 'yoga', 'programs', 'such', 'yoga', 'zone', 'series.The', 'strength', 'segment', 'was', 'lot', 'fast', 'lunges', 'fast', 'balancing', 'poses', 'was', 'much', 'previous', 'section', 'only', 'faster', 'second', 'third', 'segments', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'together', 'shorter', 'workout', 'first', 'segment', 'done', 'alone.I', 'liked', 'stability', 'ball', 'segment', 'wished', 'were', 'longer', 'were', 'lot', 'unique', 'exercises', 'abs', 'glutes', 'again', 'Denise', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'time', 'only', 'few', 'repetitions', 'move', 'workout', 'abruptly', 'real', 'cool', 'down', 'Usually', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'doing', 'yoga', 'not', 'workout', 'found', 'entire', 'workout', 'too', 'long', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'yoga', 'be', 'yoga', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'strength', 'cardio', 'be', 'either', 'Denise', 'talks', 'constantly', 'entire', 'thing', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'DVD', 'keep', 'moving', 'hour', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad']",Denise Austin - Fat-Blasting Yoga: 21 Days to a Yoga Body VHS

The moves are fun, and yes, the cueing by Denise is not great, but like any other workout video you have to do it a couple of times before you feel into the groove with it.

I happen to think she is great and a real motivator and this is only the 2nd DVD I've bought from her.  This DVD is a great workout.  I have studied other forms of Yoga and while purists will scream this isn't yoga, it's Denise taking traditional forms of yoga and blasting it up.She begins the video with a good warm up before she goes into the Yoga Aerobic Conditioning section.  In this section, you do one traditional yoga pose then she modifies and speeds it up adding extra movements for a flat blasting routine.  Poses such as Warrior, Balancing Stick, and Tree are modified effectively here to give you a good workout (it will make you sweat!).The second section is Strength training with yoga postures.  This section can be tough as you hold a lot of postures with your weight for periods of time but is all around ok.Be forwarned, for the 3rd and final section, the &quot;core&quot; section you will need a Stability Ball.  I bought a ball but maybe mine is too big I'm not sure as this section always gives me problems.  I also haven't had much ball use and find this very tough, but not unenjoyable.Overall it's a good yoga based workout, decent music, and Austin is very motivational and informational through the work out.

I know, that's not what most people think when they hear ""Denise Austin"", but at the very least, give some credit to her choreographer, Lisa Wheeler of Method fame.  This is a great workout that can get up your heart rate using yoga/fusion movements, traditional yoga and functional fitness.The first section is 30 minutes.  Within that are sections that build vinyasas around Warriors, Balancing Stick/Warrior 3, and Tree.  After a warmup of sun breaths and sun salutations, Austin introduces a posture, then builds into it, using not only yoga postures but also more ""traditional"" movements like squats, lunges and side lunges.  After moving to each side, throughout the sections, she goes back to the Sun Salutations, for something like an extra 10 or 12 peppered in.  This section should raise your heartrate- definitely.The second section is about fifteen minutes long and has the most traditional yoga postures.  Though fast-moving, they are held for a longer amount of time than they are in the first section.  Tough movements such as Plank, Up Dog, more Warriors, Side Plank and a Levitation Hold are included.  These are tough, and should definitely help build up strength.The third section is less yoga and more functional fitness.  It utilizes a stability ball and focuses on the abs and back, but the rest of the body is getting involved as well.  A few crunches are included, but she mainly focuses on tough movements like Russian Twists, Planks on the ball and Cobra.  While not as difficult as Core Foundations, these are not easy and would be a great way to build up strength through the abs and back.Considering the number of solid workouts you get on one reasonably priced DVD, I say this a great inclusion into your collection.",5,"Unique, effective workout",1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1829,"['great', 'workout', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'being', 'cutting', 'edge', 'know', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'when', 'hear', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'very', 'least', 'give', 'credit', 'choreographer', 'Lisa', 'Wheeler', 'Method', 'fame', 'great', 'workout', 'can', 'get', 'up', 'heart', 'rate', 'using', 'yoga/fusion', 'movements', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'functional', 'fitness.The', 'first', 'section', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'sections', 'build', 'vinyasas', 'Warriors', 'Balancing', 'Stick/Warrior', '3', 'Tree', 'warmup', 'sun', 'breaths', 'sun', 'salutations', 'Austin', 'posture', 'then', 'using', 'not', 'only', 'yoga', 'postures', 'also', 'more', 'traditional', 'movements', 'squats', 'lunges', 'side', 'lunges', 'moving', 'side', 'sections', 'back', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'something', 'extra', '10', '12', 'peppered', 'section', 'should', 'raise', 'heartrate-', 'definitely.The', 'second', 'section', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'long', 'most', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'postures', 'fast-moving', 'are', 'held', 'longer', 'amount', 'time', 'are', 'first', 'section', 'Tough', 'movements', 'such', 'Plank', 'Up', 'Dog', 'more', 'Warriors', 'Side', 'Plank', 'Levitation', 'Hold', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'tough', 'should', 'definitely', 'help', 'build', 'up', 'strength.The', 'third', 'section', 'less', 'yoga', 'more', 'functional', 'fitness', 'stability', 'ball', 'abs', 'back', 'rest', 'body', 'getting', 'involved', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'crunches', 'are', 'included', 'mainly', 'tough', 'movements', 'Russian', 'Twists', 'Planks', 'ball', 'Cobra', 'not', 'as', 'difficult', 'Core', 'Foundations', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'way', 'build', 'up', 'strength', 'abs', 'back.Considering', 'number', 'solid', 'workouts', 'get', 'one', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'DVD', 'say', 'great', 'inclusion', 'collection']",Denise Austin - Fat-Blasting Yoga: 21 Days to a Yoga Body VHS
728733,A1YS5EZCF21PBS,B00007GZPE,F. Ali,"[4, 5]","I'm rather suprised at the less-than-stellar reviews for this dvd, as it's one of my favorites. I'm going to go ahead and jump straight into listing the pros and cons:CONs:-as a previous reviewer states, the back of the DVD states that there are three segments, but then on the tv menu, there are 10 chapters. The way the dvd is formatted, there's really two main segments: cardio-conditioning and strength training-esque segment. I guess the third segment would be working out the core muscles (the abs) with the stability ball, but it's kind of lumped in with the strength segment.-strength training segment seems a bit useless and redundant. I feel like I'm better off using weights to strengthen my muscles, so I always skip this section.-if you're looking for a purely yoga dvd, you'll be disappointed, because this isn't pure yoga, but a yoga-inspired workout. She takes certain poses from yoga and turns them into intervals of quasi-cardio workouts. It obviously won't have the same effects of kickboxing, but doing these poses and moves DOES generate heat and causes you to sweat a bit.PROs:-like I said above, you do sweat, and that's always a plus in my book.-improves your flexibility. I always feel so nice and stretched out when I've done this workout.-it's different and adds a little variety to the workout routine. I can't do intensive workouts every day, but I do like to stay active and do at least SOMETHING every day...so this is a nice break from my regular kickboxing/step/running days. It's not too intense, but it definitely does something for me.-Happily, Denise is a bit more mellowed out in this workout. Usually she's annoyingly perky in her workouts, but here she's relatively calm...I'm guessing b/c it's yoga and perkiness just doesn't go with the mood...-I usually never bother to do the end-of-the-workout stretching in most tapes/dvds I own, but I just love the one in here. It's so relaxing and very nice on the muscles, especially the back.So all in all, this is a pretty good dvd if you're looking for something different to try. In all honesty, you WON'T be going down to a size 0 even if you do this every day. You'll need to mix this up with more intense workouts to see any real weightloss, if that's what you're aiming for.

728734,A3NDMGUGNXSA09,B00007GZPE,J. Brooks,"[1, 2]","First of all, if you like Denise Austin I'm sure this dvd won't be as unappealing to you as it was for me.  I own only one other workout by her and I thought it was ok, but it was aerobics based- which she is good at instructing.I received this dvd as a gift.  I've been doing hatha yoga for years for flexibility, balance and stress management.  Lately, I've been wanting to ""step it up a notch"" to try and loose weight with yoga along with some other types of exercise.  The package on this dvd said everything I wanted to hear and even the introduction sounded like what I was looking for.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  Denise clearly states in the intro that the benefits of yoga are isometric holds and the vinyasa flow (moving from one pose to another seamlessly).  The first half of the DVD is like yoga-robics where she is clumsily jumping around and throwing in some yoga poses, but they aren't held long enough to do anything!  I found it very hard to keep up due to her lack of instruction and I would not recommend this for people who are out of shape looking for exercise.The only real yoga is on the second half (strengh conditioning).  But again, she butchers it via a lack of flow that is really the whole point of yoga.  Instead, you assume a pose, hold it, then switch to the other side.  Then she does another pose, etc.  Warrior is supposed to morph into triangle, not be stepped into it.In general, I would not recommend this for yoga beginners or even experienced yoga practitioners.  This dvd is so out there I have no idea who it's being marketed to.

It is not even real Yoga.  But as someone who is out of shape, do I really care?  What I want is some form of exercise - ANY form of exercise that I can do regularly, as in general, I am keen to find any excuse to run away from exercise.Denise appreciates that there are only so many minutes in a day, and after a lifetime of putdowns, her praise and encouragement is helpful - sometimes cheesy and worn out, but helpful.I am the sort of person who needs to be told 'You can do it!' and 'I'm proud of you', I believe Denise is sincere in her encouragement.  If you don't need this sort of praise, you will  probably find it irritating.I don't mind that there are no instructional guides to how to do the poses - since that would stretch the length of the workout beyond a length of convenience.  In one of her other DVDs, she says 'I recommend that you watch the entire workout before you try it for yourself, since you're not always going to be able to see your TV set', and this is what I do now as a habit with any of her DVDs.There are three workouts, and I can clearly distinguish where each workout begins and where it ends.The first is 30mins of 'Cardio Conditioning', but really this is more like aerobics based on Yoga poses - it is NOT yoga.The second workout is 15mins of 'Strength Conditioning', although it is more like resistance training using your own body weight as resistance instead of weights.  I find this difficult, being quite a heavy person, but I hope that the more I do the workout, the better I will get at it.The final workout is 'Core Conditioning', an abdominal workout using a stability ball.  I haven't been able to do this workout yet without falling off the ball, but I am getting better, and hope that the more I stay at it, the more I will get out of it.Like I said, I wasn't bothered about whether it was actually Yoga or not, I just wanted a form of exercise that I could stick to.

This is my first Denise Austin dvd, but I've been doing yoga for about 5 years.In this she was very perky, like most aerobics instructors & remind you how hard you ware working, how this is working your abs or legs which just made me feel like I was killing my energy for no reason other then to kill off calories. She would sigh & grunt a bit & only once in a while say that it's a good stretch. *roll eyes* There was no instruction whatsoever & the only modifying was maybe looking at the backup 4 women & 1 guy. The set was a small carpeted all around set ala 1990s.1st 30 min workout: Yoga cardio conditioning:The music's tempo was very fast & was the usual cheap electronic stuff most use.  It starts with sun salutations, then with chair pose, she would add squats & lifting of a leg. With warrior pose, she would have you go backwards for lunges back/forth, for 3 legged standing, she'd have you get out of it & lift a knee back/forth & the same for tree pose with ""tai chi ball"" arm pose that is a way to look more ""zen"" but does nothing but rape & insult the beautiful, mind/health thousands of year old artform. This is not for anyone new to yoga & those in yoga would find this too easy & boring. Those who have issues with flexibility & balance would find the pace & lack of modifications to fast to keep up.2nd 15 min workout: Yoga strength conditioningThe music is a tad slower & nicer, dealable. She assumes you're already warmed up & goes right into side angle pose, triangle pose, twisted triangle, standing wide legged bend, 3 legged downward dog, modified bow pose, 1 hand/1 knee balance pose, torso side stretches, twisted sage pose, sitting wide legged side stretches & fwd stretch, with hero's pose, child's pose & a lot of mountain poses in between for rests. This I liked better since there were more poses involved then most mainstream yoga dvds, she would hold some poses a decent amount of time & she didn't try to aerobicise it. She was still perky with ""this works the abs.. this is good for leg circulation"" comments *well, duh* I gave the 3 stars for this part.The 3rd 15 min workout is with a stability ball which I do not want to own since it takes up space.All in all, if you ALREADY have yoga dvds & have the flexibility & balance  to do the above poses, can do it confidently w/o added help, don't like the style of a dvd that teaches the mind/body connection with proper breathing,  and are more happy with a more cardio gym style workout, this is for you.Try your local library & for trailers of her 2 other yoga dvds go to collagevideo",3,Aerobicized yoga -not for beginners & for those who don't want to be aware of their bodies,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2644,"['wrote', 'longer', 'more', 'detailed', 'review', 'was', 'deleted', 'accidentally', 'first', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', '5', 'years.In', 'was', 'very', 'perky', 'most', 'aerobics', 'instructors', 'remind', 'how', 'hard', 'ware', 'working', 'how', 'working', 'abs', 'legs', 'just', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'killing', 'energy', 'reason', 'other', 'then', 'kill', 'off', 'calories', 'would', 'sigh', 'grunt', 'bit', 'only', 'once', 'while', 'say', 'good', 'stretch', 'eyes*', 'was', 'instruction', 'whatsoever', 'only', 'modifying', 'was', 'maybe', 'looking', 'backup', '4', 'women', '1', 'guy', 'set', 'was', 'small', 'carpeted', 'around', 'set', 'ala', '1990s.1st', '30', 'min', 'workout', 'Yoga', 'cardio', 'conditioning', 'music', 'tempo', 'was', 'very', 'fast', 'was', 'usual', 'cheap', 'electronic', 'stuff', 'most', 'use', 'sun', 'salutations', 'then', 'chair', 'pose', 'would', 'add', 'squats', 'lifting', 'leg', 'warrior', 'pose', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'backwards', 'lunges', 'back/forth', '3', 'legged', 'standing', ""'d"", 'have', 'get', 'lift', 'knee', 'back/forth', 'same', 'tree', 'pose', 'tai', 'chi', 'ball', 'arm', 'pose', 'way', 'look', 'more', 'zen', 'nothing', 'rape', 'insult', 'beautiful', 'mind/health', 'thousands', 'year', 'old', 'artform', 'not', 'anyone', 'new', 'yoga', 'yoga', 'would', 'find', 'too', 'easy', 'boring', 'who', 'have', 'issues', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'would', 'find', 'pace', 'lack', 'modifications', 'fast', 'keep', 'up.2nd', '15', 'min', 'workout', 'Yoga', 'strength', 'conditioningThe', 'music', 'tad', 'slower', 'nicer', 'dealable', ""'re"", 'already', 'warmed', 'up', 'right', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'triangle', 'pose', 'twisted', 'triangle', 'standing', 'wide', 'legged', 'bend', '3', 'legged', 'downward', 'dog', 'modified', 'bow', 'pose', '1', 'hand/1', 'knee', 'balance', 'pose', 'torso', 'side', 'stretches', 'twisted', 'sage', 'pose', 'sitting', 'wide', 'legged', 'side', 'stretches', 'fwd', 'stretch', 'hero', 'pose', 'child', 'pose', 'lot', 'mountain', 'poses', 'rests', 'liked', 'better', 'were', 'more', 'poses', 'involved', 'then', 'most', 'mainstream', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'would', 'hold', 'poses', 'decent', 'amount', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'aerobicise', 'was', 'still', 'perky', 'abs..', 'good', 'leg', 'circulation', 'comments', '*well', 'duh*', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'part.The', '3rd', '15', 'min', 'workout', 'stability', 'ball', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'own', 'up', 'space.All', 'ALREADY', 'have', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'have', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'do', 'above', 'poses', 'can', 'do', 'confidently', 'added', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'style', 'dvd', 'mind/body', 'connection', 'proper', 'breathing', 'are', 'more', 'happy', 'more', 'cardio', 'gym', 'style', 'workout', 'you.Try', 'local', 'library', 'trailers', '2', 'other', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'go', 'collagevideo']",Denise Austin - Fat-Blasting Yoga: 21 Days to a Yoga Body VHS

728747,A2FL8CZ7AASC98,B00007GZPE,"Valerie L. Almaraz ""Animal lover""","[1, 1]","I have to start out by saying that Denise Austin is in great shape.  That being said, ""Fat-Blasting Yoga"" is a bit of a let-down.  There isn't enough focus on the proper form of breathing and how it relates to each position.  The positions are not developed to their full potential and are done at a quick pace. She does so many sun salutations that I started rolling my eyes every time I did one! This program is good for beginners but soon gets boring and repetitious.  Denise's over-the-top cheerful voice, while toned down in this program, takes away from the soothing calm that yoga provides.  I did like the other people in the program, however, because they had normal bodies, not super-perfect like in some programs.  I am disappointed that Denise Austin has gone the way of most successful exercise professionals, in that she jumps on the latest fad and develops a video for it.  I often wonder if I am doing the positions correctly because no real instruction is given.  Definitely not for true yoga enthusiasts, but OK for beginners. I think anyone truely interested in learning yoga would be happier with a video from an instructor who practices only yoga.",3,"Okay, but disappointing",1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,1168,"['have', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'great', 'shape', 'being', 'said', 'Fat-Blasting', 'Yoga', 'bit', 'let-down', ""n't"", 'enough', 'focus', 'proper', 'form', 'breathing', 'how', 'position', 'positions', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'full', 'potential', 'are', 'done', 'quick', 'pace', 'so', 'many', 'sun', 'salutations', 'started', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'time', 'did', 'one', 'program', 'good', 'beginners', 'soon', 'boring', 'repetitious', 'Denise', 'over-the-top', 'cheerful', 'voice', 'toned', 'down', 'program', 'away', 'soothing', 'calm', 'did', 'other', 'people', 'program', 'however', 'had', 'normal', 'bodies', 'not', 'super-perfect', 'programs', 'am', 'disappointed', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'gone', 'way', 'most', 'successful', 'exercise', 'professionals', 'latest', 'fad', 'video', 'often', 'wonder', 'am', 'doing', 'positions', 'correctly', 'real', 'instruction', 'given', 'Definitely', 'not', 'true', 'yoga', 'enthusiasts', 'OK', 'beginners', 'think', 'anyone', 'truely', 'interested', 'learning', 'yoga', 'would', 'be', 'happier', 'video', 'instructor', 'who', 'practices', 'only', 'yoga']",Denise Austin - Fat-Blasting Yoga: 21 Days to a Yoga Body VHS
728748,AYTBAXJ2Q958V,B00007GZPE,YogaGurl,"[3, 3]","Some people love Denise Austin and some, as I've read hate her.  I am in the former camp...even being someone who loves traditional yoga.I have two of Denise's yoga tapes and I love them both.  Out of all my yoga tapes (about 20 or so) I consistently go back to hers again and again. Why?  Because I notice when I do hers I feel good immediately.  Time-wise her workouts are very effective because she doesn't have long pauses in between poses. When I need a break...I simply take it on my own and carry on.  I just feel wonderful after her work outs.Her talking doesn't bother me and to me, she just seems nice and very positive.  I think she really does enjoy helping others improve their lives with fitness.Denise, if you are reading this...it would be great if you made more yoga videos!
