What makes this film such a joy to watch is all the stunning actors, heart warming story and if your feeling down, put this Blu-ray on and it will lift your heart and make you feel life is worth living for. The other added bonus is the music, which is absolutely stunning and with the last song, it will make you want to get up and dance, as it is the most stunning gospel song ever.

1530765,AOAAX92CVVC1M,B007HHWJD0,Ashley Elizabeth Blair Tetzlaff,"[0, 1]","People rave about this being a feel good movie. They compare it to Sister Act. Such a difference! Talk about comparing a 0/.5 star movie to a 4.5/5 star movie!Ok, so both movies were comparing &#34;stiffness&#34; in the church regarding music. That is where the comparison ends.1) Sister Act has lots of exciting action. Joyful Noise... (crickets chirping)... the action is people yelling and cussing at each other. Soooo feel good. Yeah, right.2) Sister Act has hints of sexual things having happened or going to happen, but you never see anything. Very much a family friendly movie. Joyful noise... seems like everybody is groping everybody else's butt in the church. Yuck!3) Sister Act actually portrays Christians with character, doing good for other people, being involved in the community, making a difference... and most importantly, loving God. Joyful noise... these people claim to be christians, but seem more like a sexual-ified do-gooders singing club that never actually does any good. Oh, yes, some serve in the soup kitchen's once, but bring about no change to the community... other than somehow the community would feel soooooo much better if they won the competition - yeah, me too. (Stomach rumbling, kids crying, people screaming at each other) &#34;Yeah, we won!&#34; Hmmmmm..... doesn't cut it, I think.4) The singing in both was pretty good. Though I personally liked the Sister Act songs a lot better. They actually sounded Christian. I couldn't tell half the time if the Joyful noise people were singing and wiggling their hips at each other or God.Now don't get me wrong. Sister Act isn't my favorite movie or anything, I just watched it last month. But as the two have been compared in some reviews, I thought I'd compare them in more detail. Sister Act is sooooooooooo much more feel good than this movie.

Although a predictable script and over-lengthy over-dramatics, keeps it from really shining.""Joyful Noise"" is centered around a gospel choir that struggles to break through, as they fall short in the national Joyful Noise competition, year after year. When their choir leader suddenly dies, Vi Rose Hill (Latifah) and G.G. Sparrow (Parton) struggle over the reigns to the group. Meanwhile, Vi Rose tries to keep her family together and keep her daughter from falling head over heels for Sparrow's son. The choir struggles between sprucing up their act so that they can break through the ceiling and finally win, or keeping with the old basic gospel act that they have grown accustom.There are many side stories going on in ""Joyful Noise"" and while most of them are interesting, the movie mostly has an aimless feel to it. Of course the choir is working toward winning a national championship, but that seems to be a side note in the day in the life storylines that go on throughout. The script is not all that interesting and the acting is good in places and stiff in places.There is a lot of good humor placed throughout the movie, in fact, some hilarious moments, but for the most part the movie sort of falls flat. Yet, when the choir is performing, the movie is anything but flat. Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan are beautiful singers and their renditions of Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" and Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" are truly outstanding.In fact, every time that music is in the forefront during ""Joyful Noise"" the movie shines.

Naturally that means a lot of rehearsal filled with Whitney-style, gospel renditions of familiar Top 40 pop classics. On this level, it doesn't disappoint since the churchy arrangements bring out a roof-raising soulfulness that is otherwise missing from the flimsily plotted film. Energetic performances of Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" and Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" definitely deliver the goods at key moments, but director/screenwriter Todd Graff (Camp) relies on tired stereotypes and down-home hokum to fill out the framework of a story about a small Georgia town hard hit by the current economic downturn. Providing a beacon of light is the Sacred Divinity Choir anchored by two divas with opposing sensibilities, the conservative and financially struggling Vi Rose Hill and the saucy and wealthy G.G. Sparrow.The movie wastes no time in giving G.G.'s husband Bernard a fatal coronary even before the opening credits are complete. The uptight church pastor needs to find a successor and chooses Vi Rose over G.G. setting the stage for a stylistic war over the choir's musical direction. Naturally, Vi Rose prefers traditional gospel, while G.G. wants a more contemporary twist to the arrangements, which suits Vi Rose's 16-year-old daughter Olivia just fine since she is a budding soloist with those gymnastically limber, Mariah-inspired pipes you either love or hate. Complicating matters is G.G.'s juvenile delinquent grandson Randy, who of course, turns out to be a talented singer in his own right and falls head-over-heels for Olivia. Once you add Olivia's quirky younger brother Walter, who turns out to have Asperger's Syndrome, and Manny, a conveniently talented guitarist and Randy's rival for Olivia's affection, you have the makings of a suspense-free, by-the-numbers soap opera with the sophistication of a young adult novel.It wouldn't be giving much away to state that it all climaxes with a face-off between the choir and the prodigious Our Lady of Perpetual Tears youth choir, spotlighting lead singer Ivan Kelley Jr., who impresses with his knockout version of Billy Preston's ""That's the Way God Planned It"". The choir counters with a rousing medley of Sly and the Family Stone, Usher, Chris Brown and Stevie Wonder's ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours"". Outside of the singing, the performances are serviceable and little more. Queen Latifah and a cosmetically altered Dolly Parton play Vi Rose and G.G. to their accustomed, outsized personalities. As Olivia, Keke Palmer (grown up from her impressive turn inAkeelah and the Bee) has a strong set of pipes as does current Broadway sensation Jeremy Jordan (Newsies) as Randy, but neither makes much of an impression otherwise. Poor Kris Kristofferson has barely a moment as Bernard and then shows up later in a fantasy duet with Parton on her touching ""From Here to the Moon and Back"". Jesse L. Martin (Rent) is also wasted in a small role as Vi Rose's estranged husband who escaped to the Army when he couldn't find a job. This is a highly conventional, clich&eacute;-driven film that is probably best left as a soundtrack purchase.",2,Gospel Renditions of Catalog Pop Hits Can't Hide the Lack of True Uplift in This Musical M&eacute;lange,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,3345,"['love', 'exuberant', 'singing', 'onGlee', 'chances', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'will', 'like', 'predictable', '2012', 'musical', 'overlook', 'numerous', 'plot', 'deficiencies', 'bring', 'characters', 'climactic', 'singing', 'competition', 'Naturally', 'lot', 'rehearsal', 'filled', 'Whitney-style', 'gospel', 'renditions', 'familiar', 'Top', '40', 'pop', 'classics', 'level', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'churchy', 'arrangements', 'bring', 'out', 'roof-raising', 'soulfulness', 'otherwise', 'missing', 'flimsily', 'plotted', 'film', 'Energetic', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'Amazed', 'definitely', 'deliver', 'goods', 'key', 'moments', 'director/screenwriter', 'Todd', 'Graff', 'Camp', 'tired', 'stereotypes', 'down-home', 'hokum', 'fill', 'out', 'framework', 'story', 'small', 'Georgia', 'town', 'hard', 'hit', 'current', 'economic', 'downturn', 'Providing', 'beacon', 'light', 'Sacred', 'Divinity', 'Choir', 'anchored', 'two', 'divas', 'opposing', 'sensibilities', 'conservative', 'financially', 'struggling', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'saucy', 'wealthy', 'G.G', 'Sparrow.The', 'movie', 'time', 'giving', 'G.G', 'husband', 'Bernard', 'fatal', 'coronary', 'even', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'complete', 'uptight', 'church', 'pastor', 'find', 'successor', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'G.G', 'setting', 'stage', 'stylistic', 'war', 'choir', 'musical', 'direction', 'Naturally', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'prefers', 'traditional', 'gospel', 'G.G', 'more', 'contemporary', 'twist', 'arrangements', 'suits', 'Vi', 'Rose', '16-year-old', 'daughter', 'Olivia', 'just', 'fine', 'budding', 'soloist', 'gymnastically', 'limber', 'Mariah-inspired', 'pipes', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'G.G', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'grandson', 'Randy', 'who', 'course', 'out', 'be', 'talented', 'singer', 'own', 'right', 'head-over-heels', 'Olivia', 'add', 'Olivia', 'quirky', 'younger', 'brother', 'Walter', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'Manny', 'conveniently', 'talented', 'guitarist', 'Randy', 'rival', 'Olivia', 'affection', 'have', 'makings', 'suspense-free', 'by-the-numbers', 'soap', 'opera', 'sophistication', 'young', 'adult', 'novel.It', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'state', 'climaxes', 'face-off', 'choir', 'prodigious', 'Lady', 'Perpetual', 'Tears', 'youth', 'choir', 'spotlighting', 'lead', 'singer', 'Ivan', 'Kelley', 'Jr.', 'who', 'knockout', 'version', 'Billy', 'Preston', 'Way', 'God', 'Planned', 'choir', 'counters', 'rousing', 'medley', 'Sly', 'Family', 'Stone', 'Usher', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Signed', 'Sealed', 'Delivered', ""'m"", 'Yours', 'singing', 'performances', 'are', 'serviceable', 'little', 'more', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'cosmetically', 'altered', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'play', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'G.G', 'accustomed', 'outsized', 'personalities', 'Olivia', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'grown', 'up', 'impressive', 'turn', 'inAkeelah', 'Bee', 'strong', 'set', 'pipes', 'current', 'Broadway', 'sensation', 'Jeremy', 'Jordan', 'Newsies', 'Randy', 'much', 'impression', 'otherwise', 'Poor', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'barely', 'moment', 'Bernard', 'then', 'up', 'later', 'fantasy', 'duet', 'Parton', 'touching', 'Here', 'Moon', 'Back', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin', 'Rent', 'also', 'wasted', 'small', 'role', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'estranged', 'husband', 'who', 'escaped', 'Army', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'job', 'highly', 'conventional', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'left', 'soundtrack', 'purchase']",Joyful Noise
1530787,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B007HHWJD0,Einsatz,"[0, 1]","This movie begins with an ""untimely"" death (as in, blink and you'll miss the fact that Kris Kristofferson was even in this movie!).  There isn't much to uplift it after that, although they make a game attempt to try.  Unfortunately, their idea of a boost was to have a cold and impersonal Pastor (Courtney B. Vance) inform the grieving widow (Dolly Parton) that she will not be their replacement choir director.  In effect, your husband's dead and buried and we don't want you.  What follows is a laundry list of unchristian behavior: loads of sniping, backbiting, unseemly rants and rages, even blackmail!  Most of the incivility swirls around the executive producer/star Queen Latifah.  She plays a thoroughly unpleasant character, Vi Rose Hill, a woman destined for anger management classes somewhere.  When she isn't hogging center screen, Vi Rose verbally assaults just about everyone within earshot, at one point soundly slapping her daughter for good measure.  If their object was to portray this aimlessly pious woman as a mother from hell, they certainly succeeded.  If this was a ""feel-good"" movie, when were we supposed to feel good?  In those sterile moments when Vi Rose bothered to take a breath between screeches?  Music aside, just what was the purpose of this movie?  Clearly, it was all about one woman, Vi Rose, and oh yes, what's her puss, G.G. Sparrow, kept firmly at the edges of the screen, out of the way.  There wasn't much to tie it together except for animosity.However well meaning the filmmakers might have been, what they turned out was a contrived story, desperate with platitudes no one seemed to follow.  It was like watching a flipbook rapidly jumping from one scene to another, none of which seemed connected.  One minute there was spilt urine the next a roof top confession then an echo match in a quarry!  All bridged with a lot of nastiness from Vi Rose.  I kept waiting for something of import to happen but instead it just unraveled into a predictable ending that should have surprised no one.  I thought this movie was incredibly superficial and not a little cynical.  They might just as well have called it Sister Act 3.",2,Just Noise,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,2162,"['movie', 'untimely', 'death', 'blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'fact', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'was', 'even', 'movie', ""n't"", 'much', 'uplift', 'make', 'game', 'attempt', 'try', 'Unfortunately', 'idea', 'boost', 'was', 'have', 'cold', 'impersonal', 'Pastor', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'inform', 'grieving', 'widow', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'replacement', 'choir', 'director', 'effect', 'husband', 'dead', 'buried', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'What', 'laundry', 'list', 'unchristian', 'behavior', 'loads', 'sniping', 'backbiting', 'unseemly', 'rants', 'rages', 'even', 'blackmail', 'Most', 'incivility', 'swirls', 'executive', 'producer/star', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'thoroughly', 'unpleasant', 'character', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'woman', 'destined', 'anger', 'management', 'classes', 'somewhere', 'When', ""n't"", 'hogging', 'center', 'screen', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'verbally', 'just', 'everyone', 'earshot', 'one', 'point', 'soundly', 'slapping', 'daughter', 'good', 'measure', 'object', 'was', 'portray', 'aimlessly', 'pious', 'woman', 'mother', 'hell', 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'was', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'when', 'were', 'supposed', 'feel', 'good', 'sterile', 'moments', 'when', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'bothered', 'take', 'breath', 'screeches', 'Music', 'aside', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'purpose', 'movie', 'Clearly', 'was', 'one', 'woman', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'oh', 'yes', 'what', 'puss', 'G.G', 'Sparrow', 'kept', 'firmly', 'edges', 'screen', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'tie', 'together', 'animosity.However', 'well', 'meaning', 'filmmakers', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'was', 'contrived', 'story', 'desperate', 'platitudes', 'one', 'seemed', 'follow', 'was', 'watching', 'flipbook', 'rapidly', 'jumping', 'one', 'scene', 'none', 'seemed', 'connected', 'One', 'minute', 'was', 'spilt', 'next', 'roof', 'top', 'confession', 'then', 'echo', 'match', 'quarry', 'bridged', 'lot', 'nastiness', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'import', 'happen', 'instead', 'just', 'unraveled', 'predictable', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'surprised', 'one', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'incredibly', 'superficial', 'not', 'little', 'cynical', 'might', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'called', 'Sister', 'Act', '3']",Joyful Noise

I must say that the two women really have a good chemistry, and I would love to see them in more movies together.The film itself has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard before. I knew of Queen Latifah as a rapper, but did not know that she had a beautiful singing voice. She really shines here as does Dolly, who wrote some of the songs for the film.As I said in my review of the soundtrack, the true stars are Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan. I absolutely love their duet on Paul McCartney's ""Maybe I'm Amazed"". And Ms. Palmer totally sings her heart out on ""Man In The Mirror"".Joyful Noise is a movie that will make you feel good.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 1]","&#34;This town is so small you can be married three times and still have all the same in-laws!&#34; This is a teeny sample of the kind of corn-pone, good- natured humor you will enjoy.Full disclosure: I have never been a fan of Gospel music...but this movie could change my mind. We are with a small-town choir that competes in regional and national contests, so we see thrilling choreography and hear terrific music. Each time a number ends we think, &#34;How can they beat THAT?&#34;Here is the top tier of talent:* Dolly Parton (&#34;Nine to Five&#34;), whose character is widowed during the opening credits. She fully expects to take the place of her choir director husband after his fatal heart attack. Her solo is so sweet..... Remember she has earned multiple Grammy Awards.* Queen Latifah (&#34;The Secret Life of Bees&#34;) gets that coveted position of choir director instead. This only increases the bad blood between Parton's wealthy widow and Latifah's single mom. Her solo is poignant..... Remember, she too, has been honored by the Grammys.* Keke Palmer (&#34;Akeelah and the Bee&#34;) is the talented daughter of that new choir director. Her mother can't accept her daughter's burgeoning maturity, while SHE can't accept her parents' sepa- ration. I LOVE her Face in the Mirror solo!* Jeremy Jordon, primarily a stage actor (&#34;Newsies&#34; and &#34;West Side Story&#34;) plays the widow's grandson. He lands back in this little burg after his mother kicks him out. He spent his childhood here, so he already knows that talented daughter! BTW, this actor is a FIND! He sings, he dances, he acts and he's good-looking!* Courtney B. Vance (&#34;Final Destination 5&#34;) is the minister of the local church. He wants what is best for the church, the town, and his parishioners, but he has to balance the budget, too.* Kris Kristofferson (&#34;Dolphin Tale&#34;) makes a couple of cameos as the soon-dead choir director.There are so many other outstanding actors, it's a shame I don't have more room. Suffice it to say, you will come to know everyone in the choir and you will delight in each person's moment to shine. And the cat-fights between Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah are a pure joy. Both are so likable and the dialogue is so good, you want them to go on and on.This PG-13 movie has a little more (mild) profanity than I expected, but it's done in such a good-spirited way, I can't be too upset. There is a throw-away subplot or two, but we are so busy enjoying ourselves, we overlook them. We see no sweaty bodies, vehicular mayhem (watch Grandma Dolly drive!), gunshots or blowie uppie stuff. We see lots of decent people trying to bring some pride to a little town that has had its share of hard knocks.When I go to a movie, I always want someone to root for.

Sparrow (Dolly Parton) feels she's better qualified, but the church council gives the position to Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah). The church has entered The National Joyful Noise Competition four years in a row, always getting to the regional semi-finals but never making it to the finals. Because of the bad economy, people in the small town of Pacashau are really counting on the choir to win this time.I laughed quite a bit watching this movie. I don't think Vi Rose and G.G. got along even before the church council's decision. The bickering between the two of them was funny.  And the scene by the hotel elevator: I know Vi Rose was serious, and I was glad she got around to telling Olivia what she needed to hear, but some of the things she said to her daughter made me laugh. But the funniest part of the movie was the pep talk Vi Rose gave the choir after Our Lady of Perpetual Tears performed. Queen Latifah does very well in comedic roles.There were touching scenes: The talk Vi Rose had with her son, when G.G. sang `From Here to the Moon and Back' and when Vi Rose sang `Fix Me'.There were lots of good lines - or some I could probably call folk sayings or words of wisdom. My favorites: When folks get too wrapped up in themselves, they make very small packages/People who ain't around make very few mistakes/God gives you girls so your mama can say, ""I told you so.""I didn't expect Asperger's to be addressed. What a person with this syndrome goes through, what may be felt about the condition and the struggles - it was all very well done. Dexter Darden played Vi's son, Walter, and he gave a fine performance.I didn't really care for G.G.'s grandson, Randy (Jeremy Jordan), and that's mostly because of the way he disrespected Vi and he was not a good influence on Olivia (Keke Palmer). I did not like his `church girl' remark; it was not a good message to send to teenage girls who care about living for Jesus. I guess Randy had his good moments, but the boy was a rebel. So, the young love thing - Randy's relationship with Olivia - would have been sweet, but it wasn't.I liked the character Devonne (DeQuina Moore), because that habit she had was kinda cute and funny. It was nice to see Jesse L. Martin (Law & Order's Detective Ed Green) as Marcus Hill, Vi's husband. I liked the way his character was used to show the pressure a loving father and husband can feel during hard economic times. And I enjoyed seeing Kirk Franklin on stage.Jeremy Jordan, Keke Palmer, Queen Latifah, Dolly Parton - there are good singing voices in this movie. The music is what I loved most, especially Vi Rose (Queen Latifah) singing ""Fix Me' and Our Lady of Perpetual Tears singing `That's The Way God Planned It' - the soloist, Ivan Kelley, Jr. is awesome!!!!  I had purchased those two songs before watching the Amazon Instant Video. After the movie I immediately purchased the soundtrack.I didn't expect the profanity, but it didn't really bother me; however, the sex out of wedlock could have been handled differently.

(Dolly Parton) expects to take over, but the job is given to his assistant, Vi Rose (Queen Latifah).  They two become snarky enemies and things get worse when G.G.'s wild grandson moves to town and starts chasing Vi Rose's demure young daughter.The plot is completely predictable, so how much you'll like it depends on your fondness for the stars and the R&B; church music.  I like Latifah and thought she was excellent as the hardworking, lonely mother, but Parton has disfigured her mouth with too many procedures and it spoiled her performance for me.  Also, she isn't convincing at all; she just plays Dolly Parton with a smart mouth.  (By the way, everyone starts cussing by the end and there is some hanky-panky which makes this not suitable for children, in my opinion.)  Keke Palmer shines as Vi Rose's daughter; she's a charismatic actress and singer and quite beautiful. Kris Kristofferson phones in a brief appearance and sings (badly) a bit.The story has the group preparing for a big choir competition which made it seem like a ""Glee"" episode.

For a movie centered around music, most of it was only mediocre.  With two vocal powerhouses starring in this film, I expected more.  The exceptions were the final numbers performed at the choir contest by Dolly and Queen Latifah's choir, and the youth choir they were competing against.  However, for a competition showcasing church/gospel choirs, the pop music presented by both was not spiritually uplifting, which is what I believe church choirs are supposed to be there for.It was so hard for me to look at Dolly in this film.  She used to be such a beautiful woman.  Unfortunately she has had so much plastic surgery, her face is stiff and wooden now.  She has the stereotypical PS nose and stretched mouth that we've seen on Michael Jackson, Joan Rivers, Bruce Jenner, and others.  Her once big, radiant smile is gone and she seemed to have had only one expression on her face they entire time, an odd, stretched, lips slightly parted smile, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"".

""Joyful Noise"" isn't necessarily a musical film, but it provides sometimes exhilarating, sometimes insufferable musical numbers, none of which have to do with the story.Queen Latifah plays Vi Rose Hill, a woman who is selected choir director for her rural-Georgia church, a decision that infuriates her wealthy nemesis, GG (Dolly Parton), who was also in the seemingly prestigious running for that position. GG's grandson (Jeremy Jordan) and Vi Rose's daughter (Keke Palmer) form an unlikely romance, but both of them happen to have pristine singing voices (surprise!), and they might (surprise!) have a shot at winning the big prize at the national ""Joyful Noise Competition"" this year.Dolly Parton hasn't had a starring role in 20 years, and despite her questionable plastic surgery choices (which are no doubt milked to death in the film), she is fresh as ever. She is rowdy and hell-raising, but also sweet and sympathetic. She sings too! She has unusually great chemistry with Queen Latifah, who also does a very nice job. A movie solely about these two characters would likely receive an ""A"" rating from me, however, their chemistry isn't enough to make up for the film's multiple flaws.The film tries to give its supporting characters something to do, and you can tell that it wants to make its characters multi-layered and well-developed, but with such bland and boring supporting characters (Palmer's Olivia and Jordan's Randy) it's hard to do that. You get the idea that they're just supposed to sit there and look pretty while the rest of the story happens around them. The 25+ minutes of story devoted to their romance easily could have been cut down. The problem is, it does not feel authentic at all.In a day where religion is taboo, I give ""Joyful Noise"" a lot of credit for being sure of its faith. It's a decidedly Christian film, with more than just momentary mentions of the fact that it IS about a church. While I applaud the film for not dancing around its religious background, that's kind of what killed it for me. It treats religion in a potently preachy and pushy way, which I foresee turning off a lot of audience members. It turned me off.But worse than the films preachy religious aspect is the ""Glee"" aspect. Like I said, a movie musical has to work hard nowadays to not be compared to ""Glee"". This film features the sketchy acting by younger cast members, which simply screams ""Glee"". This film also features self-confident and unnecessary songs which must have seemed better on paper. The film even has the narration of singers vocalizing, which is constantly heard in ""Glee"". I hate that! If this film had a better screenwriter, maybe it could have avoided some of these mistakes? Who knows.As I said, Latifah and Parton are in top form and are delightful to watch together. A film centered on the two characters, without all of the background drama would probably be more engaging. A big gripe I had was that it didn't have nearly enough Dolly Parton. I feel like she's there just to have jokes directed towards her about her nips and tucks. All of the plastic-surgery jokes aimed at her get old very fast. In short, it is a watchable January release and a decent way to spend a couple hours, but it could have (and should have) been miles better.Grade: C+",3,"Joyful Noise: A flawed, yet enjoyable film.",1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,3808,"['January', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'months', 'film', 'Movie', 'studios', 'put', 'out', 'least', 'desirable', 'films', 'January', 'February', 'smart', 'audiences', 'are', 'still', 'seeing', 'Oscar', 'season', 'movies', 'Having', 'said', 'Todd', 'Graff', 'Joyful', 'Noise', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'keep', 'being', 'good', 'movie.In', 'day', 'age', 'where', 'musical', 'film', 'television', 'program', 'linked', 'back', 'still-popular-for-some-reason', 'Glee', 'musical', 'film', 'work', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'contrived', 'cliched', 'Joyful', 'Noise', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'musical', 'film', 'sometimes', 'exhilarating', 'sometimes', 'insufferable', 'musical', 'numbers', 'none', 'have', 'do', 'story.Queen', 'Latifah', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'woman', 'who', 'selected', 'choir', 'director', 'rural-Georgia', 'church', 'decision', 'wealthy', 'nemesis', 'GG', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'seemingly', 'prestigious', 'running', 'position', 'GG', 'grandson', 'Jeremy', 'Jordan', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'daughter', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'form', 'unlikely', 'romance', 'happen', 'have', 'pristine', 'singing', 'voices', 'surprise', 'might', 'surprise', 'have', 'shot', 'winning', 'big', 'prize', 'national', 'Joyful', 'Noise', 'Competition', 'year.Dolly', 'Parton', ""n't"", 'had', 'starring', 'role', '20', 'years', 'questionable', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'choices', 'are', 'doubt', 'milked', 'death', 'film', 'fresh', 'ever', 'rowdy', 'hell-raising', 'also', 'sweet', 'sympathetic', 'too', 'unusually', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'movie', 'solely', 'two', 'characters', 'would', 'likely', 'receive', 'A', 'rating', 'however', 'chemistry', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'film', 'multiple', 'flaws.The', 'film', 'tries', 'give', 'supporting', 'characters', 'something', 'do', 'can', 'tell', 'make', 'characters', 'multi-layered', 'well-developed', 'such', 'bland', 'boring', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Palmer', 'Olivia', 'Jordan', 'Randy', 'hard', 'do', 'get', 'idea', ""'re"", 'just', 'supposed', 'sit', 'look', 'pretty', 'rest', 'story', '25+', 'minutes', 'story', 'devoted', 'romance', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'problem', 'not', 'feel', 'authentic', 'day', 'where', 'religion', 'taboo', 'give', 'Joyful', 'Noise', 'lot', 'credit', 'being', 'sure', 'faith', 'decidedly', 'Christian', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'momentary', 'mentions', 'fact', 'church', 'applaud', 'film', 'not', 'dancing', 'religious', 'background', 'kind', 'what', 'killed', 'religion', 'potently', 'preachy', 'pushy', 'way', 'foresee', 'turning', 'off', 'lot', 'audience', 'members', 'turned', 'worse', 'films', 'preachy', 'religious', 'aspect', 'Glee', 'aspect', 'said', 'movie', 'musical', 'work', 'hard', 'nowadays', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'Glee', 'film', 'sketchy', 'acting', 'younger', 'cast', 'members', 'simply', 'Glee', 'film', 'also', 'self-confident', 'unnecessary', 'songs', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'better', 'paper', 'film', 'even', 'narration', 'singers', 'vocalizing', 'constantly', 'heard', 'Glee', 'hate', 'film', 'had', 'better', 'screenwriter', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'avoided', 'mistakes', 'Who', 'knows.As', 'said', 'Latifah', 'Parton', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'are', 'delightful', 'watch', 'together', 'A', 'film', 'centered', 'two', 'characters', 'background', 'drama', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'engaging', 'big', 'gripe', 'had', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'nearly', 'enough', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'feel', 'there', 'just', 'have', 'jokes', 'directed', 'nips', 'tucks', 'plastic-surgery', 'jokes', 'aimed', 'get', 'old', 'very', 'fast', 'short', 'watchable', 'January', 'release', 'decent', 'way', 'spend', 'couple', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'miles', 'better.Grade', 'C+']",Joyful Noise

The fueding between Dolly & Queen's characters, are believable. Both want their church choir to succeed in the nationals but Latifah's character feels they should stick to the classic choir music they've been doing for years & Dolly think the Ideas of her Grandson, Randy, to make secular songs into religeous hymns is more modern and moving with the times.

And a lot could have been done to make this movie come up to par with the competition song hi-lite! The restaurant scene, with Dolly throwing biscuits at Queen Latifah, was a comedy scene that never flourished into what it should have. There is no way either character would have been that contained considering the feud. Of course, the feud was pretty dumb ... a poor woman's prejudice over a rich woman's money is basically rediculous, especially when the rich woman is basically a good christian that spreads her wealth within the church with no strings attached.Dolly Parton, a legend ... no doubt ... is about to become another Mae West. Honestly, she is beginning to look a lot like Barbara Eden & Suzanne Somers looked in the early 2000s ... puffy comical. There are scenes where Dolly looks fanastic ... but there are also scenes where her face looks like it just may POP at any second. And that spiked hair-look is a total turn-off! Her fans still prefer her softer looks. Still ... she is worthy of her legend-status, and I never get tired of seeing her prance across the screen within our hearts.The Romeo & Juliet parts of the movie ... with Keke Palmer and Jeremy Jordan ... were quite good. The interplay was often magical, and both are extra-ordinarily talented ... especially Jeremy Jordan.Angela Grovey was a huge plus to the film ... though I kept praying she would not have a heart attack during her very heavy work during the competiton song routine, of which I think she was a little over the top with. Take some pounds off, girl, the world needs to keep you around for a whole lot longer than what is in your present future. Something that should have been said to John Candy too.I was disappointed when it came to the scene time for two great actors that were not used to their full potential ... Kris Kristofferson & Jesse L. Martin.But ... the best part of the movie is the competition production. I find myself rewinding a lot to see that production over and over again. It flowed like honey through most of it. The only real disappointment being Dolly's spiked hair-do, and puffy face.All in all ... doesn't come close to being as good as Sister Act ... with the exception of the compettion section ... but ... still good entertainment.LadyShalene",4,Mixed Feelings,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2335,"['will', 'admit', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'boring', 'side', 'lot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'make', 'movie', 'come', 'up', 'par', 'competition', 'song', 'hi-lite', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'Dolly', 'throwing', 'biscuits', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'was', 'comedy', 'scene', 'never', 'flourished', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'way', 'either', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'contained', 'considering', 'feud', 'course', 'feud', 'was', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'poor', 'woman', 'prejudice', 'rich', 'woman', 'money', 'basically', 'rediculous', 'especially', 'when', 'rich', 'woman', 'basically', 'good', 'christian', 'wealth', 'church', 'strings', 'attached.Dolly', 'Parton', 'legend', 'doubt', 'become', 'Mae', 'West', 'Honestly', 'beginning', 'look', 'lot', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Suzanne', 'Somers', 'looked', 'early', '2000s', 'puffy', 'comical', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Dolly', 'fanastic', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'where', 'face', 'just', 'may', 'POP', 'second', 'spiked', 'hair-look', 'total', 'turn-off', 'fans', 'still', 'prefer', 'softer', 'looks', 'Still', 'worthy', 'legend-status', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'seeing', 'prance', 'screen', 'hearts.The', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'parts', 'movie', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'Jeremy', 'Jordan', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'interplay', 'was', 'often', 'magical', 'are', 'extra-ordinarily', 'talented', 'especially', 'Jeremy', 'Jordan.Angela', 'Grovey', 'was', 'huge', 'plus', 'film', 'kept', 'praying', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'very', 'heavy', 'work', 'competiton', 'song', 'routine', 'think', 'was', 'little', 'top', 'Take', 'pounds', 'off', 'girl', 'world', 'keep', 'around', 'whole', 'lot', 'longer', 'what', 'present', 'future', 'Something', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'John', 'Candy', 'too.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'came', 'scene', 'time', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'full', 'potential', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'Jesse', 'L.', 'Martin.But', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'competition', 'production', 'find', 'rewinding', 'lot', 'see', 'production', 'over', 'again', 'flowed', 'honey', 'most', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'being', 'Dolly', 'spiked', 'hair-do', 'puffy', 'face.All', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'Sister', 'Act', 'exception', 'compettion', 'section', 'still', 'good', 'entertainment.LadyShalene']",Joyful Noise

1530896,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B007HHWJD0,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[28, 31]","After 20 years of being away from the silver screen (her last feature film was 1992's ""Straight Talk"") legend Dolly Parton teams up with the great Queen Latifah for ""Joyful Noise"", a movie hitting theatres on January 13th, 2012. The plot deals with Dolly's character (Gi Gi) who is married to the choir director. Her husband (played by Kris Kristofferson) suddenly dies and she believes that upon her husband's death she will lead the Church choir. However, the Church decides to allow the character played by Queen Latifah (Vi Rose Hill) to head the choir and this leads to all kinds of rivalry between the two. The choir, once organized properly competes in various competitions around the country.The music is fantastic and features some wonderful remakes as well as new material written by Dolly Parton, three new songs including her self-penned haaunting ""From Here To The Moon And Back"" that she wrote for her real-life husband. Both Dolly and Latifah sing in the movie. There are also some wonderful remakes of both classic and pop songs including Michael Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" and Chris Brown's ""Forever"".The subplot deals with the love affair between two young people played to perfection by Jeremy Jordon (a Broadway actor) and Keke Palmer, Dolly and the Queen's grandson and daughter, who ultimately brings everything together.The movie is heart warming, funny, sad, and uplifting and should be a certified box office champ when it's released nation wide.Dolly's part was written with her specifically in mind by Todd Graff, the film's writer and director.Mervynn Warren who worked on the music on ""Sister Act 2"" and ""The Preacher's Wife"" has produced the soundtrack so look for that in stores. I for one cannot wait!""Joyful Noise"" cost $25,000,000 to make and was a certified hit in its opening weekend grossing an impressive $13.8 million which is exactly what Warner Brothers was aiming for! This has led to very strong sales of the movie's soundtrack which is quite good. As of March 5, 2012 the film has grossed over $30,000,000. The movie will be released in Singapore on March 15, 2012, the U.K. on April 27th and Australian and New Zealand the day before on April 26th.On May 1, 2012 ""Joyful Noise"" will see both a DVD and BluRay release. You will even be able to purchase both together in one complete set. Special features on the BluRay will include ""Spotlight on a Song: Dolly Parton's 'From Here to the Moon and Back'"", ""Inspiration of Joyful Noise"", ""Make Some Noise"", ""Leading Ladies"", extended songs and a digital version of the film available for download. The DVD/BluRay combo will retail for $35.99 and the DVD will be $22.97.",5,"""Welcome Back Dolly""",1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,2663,"['20', 'years', 'being', 'away', 'silver', 'screen', 'last', 'feature', 'film', 'was', '1992', 'Straight', 'Talk', 'legend', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'up', 'great', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Joyful', 'Noise', 'movie', 'hitting', 'theatres', 'January', '13th', '2012', 'plot', 'deals', 'Dolly', 'character', 'Gi', 'Gi', 'who', 'married', 'choir', 'director', 'husband', 'played', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'suddenly', 'husband', 'death', 'will', 'lead', 'Church', 'choir', 'However', 'Church', 'allow', 'character', 'played', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'head', 'choir', 'kinds', 'rivalry', 'two', 'choir', 'once', 'organized', 'properly', 'competes', 'various', 'competitions', 'country.The', 'music', 'fantastic', 'wonderful', 'remakes', 'as', 'well', 'new', 'material', 'written', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'three', 'new', 'songs', 'including', 'self-penned', 'haaunting', 'Here', 'Moon', 'Back', 'wrote', 'real-life', 'husband', 'Dolly', 'Latifah', 'sing', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'wonderful', 'remakes', 'classic', 'pop', 'songs', 'including', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'Forever', '.The', 'subplot', 'deals', 'love', 'affair', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'played', 'perfection', 'Jeremy', 'Jordon', 'Broadway', 'actor', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'Dolly', 'Queen', 'grandson', 'daughter', 'who', 'ultimately', 'everything', 'together.The', 'movie', 'heart', 'warming', 'funny', 'sad', 'uplifting', 'should', 'be', 'certified', 'box', 'office', 'champ', 'when', 'released', 'nation', 'wide.Dolly', 'part', 'was', 'written', 'specifically', 'mind', 'Todd', 'Graff', 'film', 'writer', 'director.Mervynn', 'Warren', 'who', 'worked', 'music', 'Sister', 'Act', '2', 'Preacher', 'Wife', 'produced', 'soundtrack', 'so', 'look', 'stores', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'Joyful', 'Noise', 'cost', '25,000,000', 'make', 'was', 'certified', 'hit', 'opening', 'weekend', 'grossing', 'impressive', '13.8', 'million', 'exactly', 'what', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'was', 'aiming', 'led', 'very', 'strong', 'sales', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'quite', 'good', 'March', '5', '2012', 'film', 'grossed', '30,000,000', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'Singapore', 'March', '15', '2012', 'U.K.', 'April', '27th', 'Australian', 'New', 'Zealand', 'day', 'April', '26th.On', 'May', '1', '2012', 'Joyful', 'Noise', 'will', 'see', 'DVD', 'BluRay', 'release', 'will', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'purchase', 'together', 'one', 'complete', 'set', 'Special', 'features', 'BluRay', 'will', 'include', 'Spotlight', 'Song', 'Dolly', 'Parton', ""'From"", 'Here', 'Moon', 'Back', 'Inspiration', 'Joyful', 'Noise', 'Make', 'Noise', 'Leading', 'Ladies', 'extended', 'songs', 'digital', 'version', 'film', 'available', 'download', 'DVD/BluRay', 'combo', 'will', 'retail', '35.99', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', '22.97']",Joyful Noise

In the first scene Bernard Sparrow (Kris Kristofferson) dies, which I found amusing because I thought K.K. was already dead. Queen Latifah, who was the assistant choir director takes over the top position. G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton), who was married to Bernard believes she should have the role because of all the pillow talk they shared and the fact her face does a pretty good Joan Rivers impersonation.Dolly's long lost bad boy grandson (Jeremy Jordan) shows up out of nowhere and wants Olivia (Keke Palmer) to be his Juliet. Dexter Darden stars as Walter Hill, Olivia's brother who has Asperger's Syndrome. He is mono-focused on ""one hit wonders.""The film has a number of wonderful scenes that work. Unfortunately it uses some dumb lines such as Dolly Parton at her husband's funeral, ""man had five kids, he must have loved something."" or ""[He is] so country he has married three times and has the same in-laws."" Dolly Parton has a distinctive voice. You know when she is singing and you know when she isn't i.e. just lip syncing as part of the chorus.The movie had a few good dramatic scenes, but the film worked best when it is attempting to be a comedy. The only different between this a sitcom, is that in the sitcom they have to win to pay the mortgage or mom's operation. (Oh what are TV writers going to do once everyone has insurance?) Okay rental if you love TV sitcoms. Don't expect any come to Jesus moments. 4 stars maybe a little overrated, but I laughed at every close up they did of Dolly's face (she did this to herself.)Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

1530899,A1GOJSM3XB62VB,B007HHWJD0,Thomas G. Farrar,"[1, 1]","Joyful Noise is basically a musical film based around a Gospel church choir that wishes to travel to California and compete (and win) a Gospel music tournament.  Along the way, characters fight and squabble, fall in and out of love, have family issues, and sing often.Some of the musicians and actors in the film are great -- Queen Latifah and Keke Palmer stand out.  Dolly Parton performs well also.  Some of the other characters seem a stretch and are not quite as strong.The music is particularly good in this film -- standout tracks include a piano song, ""Fix Me Jesus,"" performed by Queen Latifah, and a duet ""To the Moon and Back"" by Dolly Parton and Kris Kristofferson.The simple basis of the story and some of the contrived scenarios were, to me, the largest disappointment of the film.  It seemed a little too easy to fix and overcome these difficulties to make it to the contest.  Often the scenes were predictable in my opinion, particularly the romance between Keke Palmer's character and Dolly's ""grandson.""  This area seemed much weaker in comparison to some of the strong stage and film musicals of the past.Overall the movie was positive to watch, but I would probably spend more time listening to the soundtrack of the excellent songs.",3,"Great music, but some of the movie was disappointing",1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,1252,"['Joyful', 'Noise', 'basically', 'musical', 'film', 'based', 'Gospel', 'church', 'choir', 'travel', 'California', 'compete', 'win', 'Gospel', 'music', 'tournament', 'way', 'characters', 'fight', 'squabble', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'family', 'issues', 'sing', 'often.Some', 'musicians', 'actors', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'stand', 'out', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'performs', 'well', 'also', 'other', 'characters', 'seem', 'stretch', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'strong.The', 'music', 'particularly', 'good', 'film', 'standout', 'tracks', 'include', 'piano', 'song', 'Me', 'Jesus', 'performed', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'duet', 'Moon', 'Back', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson.The', 'simple', 'basis', 'story', 'contrived', 'scenarios', 'were', 'largest', 'disappointment', 'film', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'fix', 'overcome', 'difficulties', 'make', 'contest', 'scenes', 'were', 'predictable', 'opinion', 'particularly', 'romance', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'character', 'Dolly', 'grandson', 'area', 'seemed', 'much', 'weaker', 'comparison', 'strong', 'stage', 'film', 'musicals', 'past.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'positive', 'watch', 'would', 'probably', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'listening', 'soundtrack', 'excellent', 'songs']",Joyful Noise

G.G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton) is the chief benefactor of her church and when her husband, the choir director (Kris Kristofferson) suddenly passes away, she believes she will be made the new director. Instead the church board gives the position to Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah), Gi Gi's nemesis. There's some infighting that becomes more interesting when Gi Gi's grandson Randy (Jeremy Jordon) comes to live with her and falls in love with Vi Rose's daughter, Olivia (Keke Palmer).JOYFUL NOISE features Dolly Parton's return to the big screen in a major role after a long absence (beyond a few cameos and a vocal cameo in GNOMEO AND JULIET, Parton hasn't been on the big screen since 1992). Welcome back, Dolly! Don't stay away so long next time.Parton and Queen Latifah have a great onscreen chemistry. I'd love to see another movie that features these two women as co-stars.Some of the supporting actors give so solid performances too, particularly Dexter Darden as Vi Rose's son, Walter. Walter has Asperger's Syndrome and Darden's portrayal of the character is particularly moving.There's a lot of music in JOYFUL NOISE. That's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because it provides the audience with an opportunity to hear some of the wonderful voices of the cast. It's a bad thing because many of the songs in the film are unnecessary and don't do anything to drive the plot or develop the characters. Dolly sings the song ""From Here to the Moon"" and Queen Latifah sings ""Fix Me Jesus"". These songs are beautiful and it gives these unbelievably talented performers an opportunity to sing a solo. Unfortunately, they aren't necessary to the film. There are several other songs like this in the movie. In this aspect, JOYFUL NOISE attempts to copy the formula from the tv show ""Glee"". I know that ""Glee"" has been a successful tv show. However, the ""Glee"" formula really doesn't work in Christian-setting with mostly gospel music (heck, the ""Glee"" formula doesn't really even work on tv anymore).I didn't think I was going to like JOYFUL NOISE very much. I've never been much a fan of gospel music. When I saw the movie with family, the main thing I was looking forward to was seeing Dolly (I've been a fan of hers since I was a kid). Despite the ""Glee""-vibe during certain moments and some unnecessary musical numbers, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed JOYFUL NOISE. There are some really touching moments that are grounded in reality: the death of a close love one, the economic downturn, and the struggle against loneliness, and the existence of God are issues that most everyone can relate. JOYFUL NOISE deals with these issues and though it does so in an optimistic and joyful way, it's doesn't feel false. The movie does have some foul language and there are some sexual references, so there will be some who will be turned off by that. However, if you don't mind a Christian-themed movie and can deal with some ""Glee""-inspired motifs, JOYFUL NOISE is a movie that might leave you with a joyful heart.",4,Dolly and Queen Latifah Need to Act Together in More Movies,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,3200,"['Set', 'small', 'town', 'Pacashau', 'Georgia', 'JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'members', 'church', 'choir', 'attempt', 'win', 'national', 'Joyful', 'Noise', 'gospel', 'choir', 'competition', 'G.G', 'Sparrow', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'chief', 'benefactor', 'church', 'when', 'husband', 'choir', 'director', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'suddenly', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'new', 'director', 'Instead', 'church', 'board', 'position', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'Hill', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Gi', 'Gi', 'nemesis', 'infighting', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'Gi', 'Gi', 'grandson', 'Randy', 'Jeremy', 'Jordon', 'live', 'love', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'daughter', 'Olivia', 'Keke', 'Palmer', '.JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'features', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'return', 'big', 'screen', 'major', 'role', 'long', 'absence', 'few', 'cameos', 'vocal', 'cameo', 'GNOMEO', 'AND', 'JULIET', 'Parton', ""n't"", 'been', 'big', 'screen', '1992', 'Welcome', 'back', 'Dolly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'stay', 'away', 'so', 'long', 'next', 'time.Parton', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'have', 'great', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'movie', 'two', 'women', 'co-stars.Some', 'supporting', 'actors', 'give', 'so', 'solid', 'performances', 'too', 'particularly', 'Dexter', 'Darden', 'Vi', 'Rose', 'son', 'Walter', 'Walter', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'Darden', 'portrayal', 'character', 'particularly', 'lot', 'music', 'JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'thing', 'good', 'thing', 'audience', 'opportunity', 'hear', 'wonderful', 'voices', 'cast', 'bad', 'thing', 'many', 'songs', 'film', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'drive', 'plot', 'develop', 'characters', 'Dolly', 'song', 'Here', 'Moon', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Fix', 'Me', 'Jesus', 'songs', 'are', 'beautiful', 'unbelievably', 'talented', 'performers', 'opportunity', 'sing', 'solo', 'Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'songs', 'movie', 'aspect', 'JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'copy', 'formula', 'tv', 'show', 'Glee', 'know', 'Glee', 'been', 'successful', 'tv', 'show', 'However', 'Glee', 'formula', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'Christian-setting', 'mostly', 'gospel', 'music', 'heck', 'Glee', 'formula', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'work', 'tv', 'anymore', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'very', 'much', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'much', 'fan', 'gospel', 'music', 'When', 'saw', 'movie', 'family', 'main', 'thing', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'was', 'seeing', 'Dolly', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'hers', 'was', 'kid', 'Glee', '-vibe', 'certain', 'moments', 'unnecessary', 'musical', 'numbers', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'are', 'really', 'touching', 'moments', 'are', 'grounded', 'reality', 'death', 'close', 'love', 'one', 'economic', 'downturn', 'struggle', 'loneliness', 'existence', 'God', 'are', 'issues', 'most', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'deals', 'issues', 'so', 'optimistic', 'joyful', 'way', ""n't"", 'feel', 'false', 'movie', 'have', 'foul', 'language', 'are', 'sexual', 'references', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Christian-themed', 'movie', 'can', 'deal', 'Glee', '-inspired', 'motifs', 'JOYFUL', 'NOISE', 'movie', 'might', 'leave', 'joyful', 'heart']",Joyful Noise
