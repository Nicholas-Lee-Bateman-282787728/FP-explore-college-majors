1051640,A3AWRTFWNEK7FV,B000MX7V5C,Denise,"[5, 7]","I cannot complain or at least I should not.  Having the forth season released on DVD and on my BIRTHDAY is a great gift for a fan who's alltime favorite show is Wings.  The show itself is sooooo good.  Season 4 is not my favorite season but even then my family spent the entire weekend watching and laughing and rewatching.  My 15 and 11 year boys think this show is one of the funniest they've ever seen. And it's not crude, no nudity, no real locker room humor.  Just good clean fun...The DVD itself is ridiculously amateur.  There is no option to play the entire DVD (as has previously been mentioned) no extras such as interviews or bloopers. No tweaking of the video or sound quality.Nothing that a real Wings fan would love to see just because the series itself is soooo dearly missed and the DVD releases are too few and far between.During it's run this show NEVER got the accolades it deserved other than from it's die hard and dedicated fans.  Now, in DVD it's being shorted again.  Again, I don't want to sound like I'm complaining as ANY Wings is better than none and certainly better than the DOZENS of videotapes I have of this show that sit in my basement unwatched.  But one would think that the tenth year anniversary of the end of the show might warrant a better video release than simply a cd in a box.Lastly, I cannot wait to see Tim Daly on his new show.  He's had three he's worked hard on and have not succeeded.  It's a shame that so many of this talented ensemble have had such a hard time finding big hits after this show.  Kudos to Tony and Thomas for their major successes.  Hopefully third time is a charm for Tim.",5,"Wings, the series is 5 stars, the dvd itself is not...",1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,1642,"['can', 'not', 'complain', 'least', 'should', 'not', 'Having', 'forth', 'season', 'released', 'DVD', 'BIRTHDAY', 'great', 'gift', 'fan', 'who', 'alltime', 'favorite', 'show', 'Wings', 'show', 'sooooo', 'good', 'Season', '4', 'not', 'favorite', 'season', 'even', 'then', 'family', 'spent', 'entire', 'weekend', 'watching', 'laughing', 'rewatching', '15', '11', 'year', 'boys', 'think', 'show', 'one', 'funniest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'crude', 'nudity', 'real', 'locker', 'room', 'humor', 'Just', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'DVD', 'ridiculously', 'amateur', 'option', 'play', 'entire', 'DVD', 'previously', 'been', 'mentioned', 'extras', 'such', 'interviews', 'bloopers', 'tweaking', 'video', 'sound', 'quality.Nothing', 'real', 'Wings', 'fan', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'just', 'series', 'soooo', 'dearly', 'missed', 'DVD', 'releases', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'far', 'between.During', 'run', 'show', 'NEVER', 'got', 'accolades', 'deserved', 'other', 'die', 'hard', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'Now', 'DVD', 'being', 'shorted', 'again', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'ANY', 'Wings', 'better', 'none', 'certainly', 'better', 'DOZENS', 'videotapes', 'have', 'show', 'sit', 'basement', 'unwatched', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'tenth', 'year', 'anniversary', 'end', 'show', 'might', 'warrant', 'better', 'video', 'release', 'simply', 'cd', 'box.Lastly', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'new', 'show', 'had', 'three', 'worked', 'hard', 'have', 'not', 'succeeded', 'shame', 'so', 'many', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'have', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'big', 'hits', 'show', 'Kudos', 'Tony', 'Thomas', 'major', 'successes', 'Hopefully', 'third', 'time', 'charm', 'Tim']",Wings: Season 4

Ribel ""Die Hard Steeler""","[0, 0]",The first 5 seasons of Wings are classic and the final 3 are still pretty good.Season 4 is without a doubt the best season of the entire series.It's the season where the cast was really peaking with their characters and the writing was in it's prime.There are more classic episodes from this season than any other.Most shows usually peak around seasons 4 and 5 in my opinion.,5,Best Season of them all,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,375,"['first', '5', 'seasons', 'Wings', 'are', 'classic', 'final', '3', 'are', 'still', 'pretty', 'good.Season', '4', 'doubt', 'best', 'season', 'entire', 'series.It', 'season', 'where', 'cast', 'was', 'really', 'peaking', 'characters', 'writing', 'was', 'are', 'more', 'classic', 'episodes', 'season', 'other.Most', 'shows', 'usually', 'peak', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'opinion']",Wings: Season 4

1051645,A1P6SUN6CTQ84L,B000MX7V5C,Jason Cook,"[0, 0]","More funny episodes in season 4.  My only complaint in season 4 is the introduction of a woman named Alex into the cast.  She plays the part of a helicopter pilot and is not funny at all.  Both of the Hackett brothers fall for her and I'm not sure why.  All she does is tout her intelligence and independence and complain when guys look at her or pay her a compliment.  Girls like this are no fun on TV or real life.  Thankfully, she only lasts for two seasons and is mercifully written off.  Very funny season nonetheless.  Season 4 highlights: ""Mathers of the Heart"", Lowell asks Helen out and Helen accepts out of pity.  The tables turn when Helen enjoys herself and Lowell is bored to tears.  ""The Gift: Parts 1 and 2"", Joe and Brian put a 2nd mortgage on their house to buy Helen a new Cello.  Helen is then forced to join a string quartet with creepy members.  The part where Brian pretends to trip and fall on the new Cello has to be among the funniest TV moments EVER!  ""I Love Brian"", a not-so-subtle nod to ""I Love Lucy"".

The comedy was always top notch, and the writing excelled.  This season brought the show together than better before.  The writers had characters down, and used that to make the most of the hilarious situations.  The introduction of Alex was a hit or miss affair.  While giving Brian a permanent love interest, her humor never properly gelled with everyone else.  However, what Brian goes through to get her attention and affection more than makes up for her.

The alex character was around as a love interest for brian and the cast was doing a fine job. the ratings remained strong too. Wings is still on tv in reruns and it's on reelz channel these days. (2012) 22 years after it debuted! If you need a good laugh then this is a good one to grab. The dvd's look decent and the set is bare bones. But this show has the chops to get  you laughing and will be fondly remembered for decades to come.
