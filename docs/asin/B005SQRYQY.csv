Pete Malloy and Jim Reed have always been my favorite characters,but even then I understood what they were supposed to represent, the man on the beat,the person behind the badge. While some of what they encountered was sometimes either funny or downright serious,it was a day in the life of the police officer. It is also a bit of historical review as in some of the commentaries they explain what has changed procedurally since the time the series was made and it is interesting to hear what has changed since Adam-12 took to the road.Still, it is a great series, and one I'm glad to be seeing time and again, at least, on DVD.",5,A blast from the past....,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,707,"['loved', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'finally', 'have', 'entire', 'collection', 'Pete', 'Malloy', 'Jim', 'Reed', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'characters', 'even', 'then', 'understood', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'represent', 'man', 'beat', 'person', 'badge', 'what', 'encountered', 'was', 'sometimes', 'either', 'funny', 'downright', 'serious', 'was', 'day', 'life', 'police', 'officer', 'also', 'bit', 'historical', 'review', 'commentaries', 'explain', 'what', 'changed', 'procedurally', 'time', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'interesting', 'hear', 'what', 'changed', 'Adam-12', 'took', 'road.Still', 'great', 'series', 'one', ""'m"", 'glad', 'be', 'seeing', 'time', 'again', 'least', 'DVD']",Adam 12: Season 6
