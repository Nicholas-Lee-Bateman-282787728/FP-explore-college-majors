The fact that it is (partially) narrated by one of greatest minds of all times, Mr. Hawking is a pure bonus! When I say partially, (SPOILER!) I mean that Mr. Hawking starts talking and then another narrator takes over, usually mid-sentence. I guess producers thought that his somewhat robotic voice will annoy people. I myself don't care, I wouldn't mind listening to him but either way works.This disc is full of interesting things and is very well presented. Material is fairly new, with some newer theories understandably absent but still since most of them are still being developed I don't mind that either.

1380204,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,B0041IJIIW,H. Snyder,"[2, 2]","The narrator of this series is Stephen Hawking, one of the leading scientific minds of the day, whose voice morphs back and forth between his familiar computer-generated sound and the voice of an actor speaking the lines.  For me, perhaps the most memorable highlight was the introduction to each of the three episodes on the disc. As he sits crumpled in his wheelchair, Hawking's computer voice says ""Hello. My name is Stephen Hawking, physicist, cosmologist and something of a dreamer. Although I cannot move, and have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free...""  When any member of my family wandered innocently through the living room, I had them listen to the introduction.Produced by Discovery Channel, the video quality of the Blu-ray is wonderful, with computer graphics that look like photographs from the Hubble telescope except that they are in motion. The three episodes are: ""Aliens"" and ""Time Travel"" which are about 50 minutes each; and ""The Story of Everything"" which runs almost 90 minutes. Aliens consists of conjecture about the likely existence of extraterrestrial life and what possible forms such life might take. Time Travel discusses ""worm holes"" and orbiting a large mass such as a black hole as possible ways to travel in time. Ultimately these are dismissed as unlikely, and Einstein's theory of time slowing down as one approaches the speed of light is deemed to be the best hope for time travel.The Story of Everything is the real mother lode of information, and perhaps was saved for last in order to prepare the audience by starting with the shorter episodes and the trendier topics. It is the story of the universe, how it began, how it developed into what we see today, and what fate is thought to lie in store for it.  The narration is remarkable, threading a fine line between cutting-edge physics and cosmology on the one hand, and providing information in a manner that is palatable and understandable to the intelligent layman on the other.Watch and listen, and have unimaginable vistas open up before you.

Fuchs ""&#34;The Meta-Reviewer&#34;""","[8, 39]","I finally got to see some of this series on the tube while channel-surfing, after hearing about it for soooo long. That is, hearing about it ad nauseum from reactionaries who tsk-tsk about it in the most over-the-top fashion. Strangely, though the part that I caught seemed strangely cut from the same cloth as a reactionary series as Padre Baron's catholicism series. And here's why. For starters there is the very strange videographic trope of trying to make the viewer feel insignificant in every way. This is a surpassingly odd prima facie and de facto goal in a series that is premised on the notion of a the human mind's great ability to grasp cosmic matters with one of the great achievements of the modern age, science. But there the trope is, in the most blatant fashion, with human life portrayed relentlessly like ants scurrying around. Pray tell, if we are trying to discern what life is really about on the planet realistically in relation to the vastness of the universe, when do we ever see locomotion sped up like a cartoon of the Road Runner, but with masses of people doing the running? Not very subtle intent, cinemato-psychologically, I aver. Then there is really very odd way they portrayed Hawking. Apparently the man is a respected teacher or physics sage. So why not portray him interacting in some way. No, they have him in a big old room witting alone, very preposterously. Where are those around that make his life meaningful, and help him physically. No, instead they portray him there sitting like a Cartesian cogito all alone, and it is hilarious, Now I do NOT want to be thought of as mean, and laughing at the physically challenged, but it seems to me the way they did portray him is doing that in the most egregious form already. The lighting and odd angles on the guy seems entirely concocted to make him look like the utter evocation of the Ghost in the Machine. One is almost not surprised to find in the next scene the utter confirmation of this, in an historical digression on Descartes,  (And a rather handsome Descartes too, which he was not by his pictures.)But it gets worse. Then Hawking opines that ""philosophy is dead"" Oy vey, how many times have we heard that?! Again?? But the reason why is really sooo outre that it is one for the record books. Look, I barely could handle Algebra II in  Archbishop Curley-Notre Dame Catholic High School with Miss Acevedo, so I read carefully here, and with deference to the man's extraordinarily brilliant mind. But being alive and not a slouch in my own field -- which touches on philosophy -- I have room to comment. Switching again from exploding galaxies to Hawking sitting alone in a Cambridge classroom like his nurse forgot to come pick him up after class (does this bizarre chose  portrayal  of him by the producers of this DVD not reek of a certain cruelty, truly?!) his computerized voice gives the money shot. Before the Big Bang there was not time. Thus there no time for God to have been in prior to the creation of time, and so no God at all possible generally. Is this very well educated man not aware that the entire history of Buddhist thought is bound up with notions of void. And that this did not preclude elements of conceiving God in some historical parts of Buddhist thought? Maybe he doesn't agree with it. But it is not as if the science has destroyed the possibilities of such meanings. Further, even in the West, amongst those thinkers or mystics of more ""apophatic"" tendency there is a way of conceiving God that is not at all precluded by the science presented by Hawking. Poor Meister Eckhart, great thinker that he was. After dealing with the Inquisition even, his memory is not respectged in Western Culture, even at Cambridge apparently, to have his notion of ""Nichts"" somehow factored in.Somehow the extremes seem to meet here, with an effort like Robert Barron's Catholicism series, which also makes people look small.

1380217,A1TFDMY4YNTV97,B0041IJIIW,"Serg ""Serg""","[10, 60]","So much for fantasy speculations. ""Aliens"" and ""Time traveling"" is a poor and pure fantasies without any mathematical or facts support made of computer graphic. I laughed very much watching modified elephant with trunk size of half its body sucking some slug from stones of obliviously dead desert. You don't have to be a scientist to tell that this kind of life won't last a week. And again why is scientists so sure that without hydrogen won't be no life? It won't be life like ours but self-reproduction could be in a different environment and thus life forms. Mr Hawking does not give any calculations or solid evidence of time traveling. Instead he says: ""I do not say it could be done (making a wormhole) but if it would... what a wonderful opportunity we have"" then pure fantasy speculations take a place. There is theory (and it in this movie) that mass object were created by dislocation in some kind of perfect matrix of equal particles on equal distance. They (theorists) ""take"" away 5 particles and then say that all structure will be shifted away from this empty spot by gravity forming dense matter. What an imagination!!! They imagined absolute ideal conditions excluding other forces of interaction ""somehow"" making disappear those particles. Wow! The gravity is a weak force in small scales thus if electrical field existed then that what would took an initiative in such a model. Otherwise if they imagine gas then it would be spreaded  equally (nothing would be changed). But most funny conclusion was made after this theory that: ""...we all exist because of Universe imperfection..."". NO dear Stephen, imperfection did not let you live your life in full (no offenses). Imperfection is a key to destruction. It breaks a program - not create. A symmetry and order can't be born out of chaos without selective forces applied in programmed sequences to any sort of  matter.As for Doppler effect. It shows that galaxies move away from some center BUT it is absolutely not necessary that some blast happened milliards years ago. (Blast would not create and keep creating new galaxies - try to build aircraft by blasting aircraft plant and see what will happen). Using Doppler effect could also mean that galaxies filling up layers like electrons around an atom but on spiral trajectory directed away from Center. As for theory of relativity, people take it on fate not understanding a part of it. To understand this you need understand what time is. What you thinking first of all when you say time? - The watch. What is the watch - mechanism iterating cycles. For what purpose? - To organize your life. Why? - Because it ends one day and you may want to achieve something. How do you know how long do you have? - By watching day-nights changing, by seasons changing. But we needed more accurate scale to measure day making plans. So a watch was invented. To do what (from human body aspect)? - To scale processes duration. And What is any process? - Is a MOTION. Try to imagine that there are no motions of anything at all... What would you measure and even how? So the Time is a scoop of movements in different directions of all things what have a mass (in any form) with a constant reference system taken for basis so you could measure its quantity. It does not matter what speed you fly with if you take the same constant reference system to calculate from. 4 years for astronaut will be same as four years on Earth. He'll just cover a great distance for very short time unless if you gonna suggest that his biological process somehow will slow down. Speed of light will disintegrate particles and this what you will end up with. If we assume that you could to disintegrate particles and ""somehow"" put them back in absolutely same structure then for this structure time did not exist ('cause matter would not exist) during photons traveling (which would hold the information of that structure) from time of disintegrating to recreating it back. Then yes all processes of disintegrated matter would stop but you won't be able to count time for stopped process (only time of light traveling) and thus this matter won't become any older if you ""freeze"" it. Then no matter how much time will pass on Earth for ""matter"" traveling with light speed disintegrated in photons time not gonna change a bit. But this is another story and theory of relativity has nothing to do with that. There is absolutely stupid example referring to theory of relativity like speeding car passing you by at the very high speed and for its driver you are not moving at all even if you did. How and why is that human eye imperfections fit in theory of relativity? Take a fast camera with high resolution and you'll see all subject movements in the speed (after editing) suitable for your eyes. Another example in this movie like circling train around Earth with light speed and then comes Narrator's question: will speed of passenger inside the train be added to a speed of light if he'll start moving forward the train direction? - He answers: No. Well in that case passenger's speed will be equal zero and it won't be able to move. Where is a mistake? Same as I described above. Nothing but photons travels faster with light speed, so you'd have to disintegrate matter in photons and in that case no stream of photons (passenger) will go faster another of photons' stream (train). This example in the movie is absurd. You can't simply project one physics laws in different conditions.In two words. Theories in this movie is outdated and there is a lot of guesses and fantasies.I'd recommend to buy ""Universe"" season 3 instead. There are lots of more opinions and observations there.As for Stephen, he achieved a lot but for me, if I'd have a choice among of opinions in physics, it would be just not enough.",2,"Buy
