It's his early years with commentating from various family members about Steve and how he is and how it all started. Then it has a section on his most dangerous encounters and the third is Steve being Steve and doing what made him famous.

All the crocodile captures, adventures, etc. that this man has done is just nothing short of amazing.  I couldn't wait to get this - little ones just love him and all his amazing antics. It's like watching the most amazing movie ever.  You just get sucked in and you can't get up off the couch for fear of missing anything.  The things you learn is just unbelievable.  This DVD should be on hand in all classrooms, it's that informative.  Just wish there were more available of these Discovery Channel shows.  The rescue of Charlie the crocodile is absolutely my favorite and the reason I bought this dvd.  We had seen it on the Discovery Channel and just couldn't believe that poor crocodile had been abused so much that his feet were torn from living on cement.  Watching Steve rescue Charlie was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  Hope someone out there captures all of his adventures on DVD - we sure need them!

I thought this must be staged..It can't be true...But it was true, and I was hooked from then on.You can describe Steve Irwin as a nutcase..anyone who looks at a dangerous rattlesnake right in the eye, and tells it: You are gorgeous sweetheart,can only be described so..but it is all very entertaining stuff that will keep you at the edge of your seat. There is a lot of humour too, and a good message for all, about the importance of animals in preserving the delicate balance of nature.Wildlife and nature experts regularily grace the screens nowadays,each no doubt very learned and experienced about his/her area of expertise, be it sharks, snakes, or crocodiles, but still Steve Irwin is the best of them all, because there is a kind of contagious enthusiasm, a childish excitment, and a genuine love for the animals he is presenting, that does not fail to rub on the viewer, which makes this DVD a must buy.",5,The Real Crocodile Dundee,1024617600,"06 21, 2002",2002,1088,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'was', 'boat', 'middle', 'night', 'murky', 'river', 'when', 'suddenly', 'jumped', 'water', 'wild', 'corcodile', 'wrestled', 'thought', 'must', 'be', 'staged..It', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'true', 'was', 'true', 'was', 'hooked', 'then', 'on.You', 'can', 'describe', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'nutcase..anyone', 'who', 'dangerous', 'rattlesnake', 'right', 'eye', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'sweetheart', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'so..but', 'very', 'entertaining', 'stuff', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'lot', 'humour', 'too', 'good', 'message', 'importance', 'animals', 'preserving', 'delicate', 'balance', 'nature.Wildlife', 'nature', 'experts', 'regularily', 'grace', 'screens', 'nowadays', 'doubt', 'very', 'learned', 'experienced', 'his/her', 'area', 'expertise', 'be', 'snakes', 'crocodiles', 'still', 'Steve', 'Irwin', 'best', 'kind', 'contagious', 'enthusiasm', 'childish', 'excitment', 'genuine', 'love', 'animals', 'presenting', 'not', 'fail', 'rub', 'viewer', 'DVD', 'must', 'buy']",N/A

All of a sudden I'm watching 'Crocodile Hunter' or as I like to call it, 'The  Adventures of the Aussie who loves nature a whole lot more than his  personal safety'. Steve Irwin's actually getting right in the thick of  things, and bringing the missus along to assist! Capturing venomous snakes  with his bare hands and proper timing, wrestling crocs to the ground,  carefully capturing timid, injured creatures so he can hospitalize them  &amp; help them recuperate, and other unbelievable adventures. And all the  while he's telling you, a bit too gleefully perhaps, how deadly the  particular species of beast that he's facing down is, or that you should  &quot;never attempt this kinda thing&quot;. Steve Irwin's gotta be close to  clinically insane! It's the greatest!There are those who say that it's  mostly tricky camera angles that give the show the illusion of danger. All  I know is, there's that moment when Irwin's actually subduing that spooked  wallaby, or grabbing that anaconda at the precise moment, or getting run up  a tree after being chased by monitor lizards. He does actually put himself  at risk for the show. Now is that dedication to your craft or what? You  never saw Marlon Perkins go that extra mile for 'Mutual of Omaha's Wild  Kingdom', that's for sure!
