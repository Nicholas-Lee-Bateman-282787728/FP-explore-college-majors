One has to go back to August, 1941 when he met Churchill at Placentia Bay. Churchill risked crossing the Atlantic since he was bent on bringing the US into the war. Stalin was in full retreat before Hitler's invasion and it was almost certain that Hitler would be in Moscow by Christmas. If Russia were taken out of the war it would be curtains for the UK. Hence Churchill convinced FDR he had to bring the US into the war. The only way this could be done, given the anti-war sentiment in the US, was to provoke an attack that would cause a 180 degree change in US opinion. So FDR went back to Washington and told the navy to create a plan to provoke Japan into an attack. This was centered on the US shutting off US oil that Japan needed for its war effort. By December this was successful and Japan had determined that it was going to have to invade the Dutch East Indies (lots of oil there) and to do this it needed to neutralize the US fleet that could cut its communications with the East Indies. Roosevelt knew this was in the works and made sure that the the military in Pearl Harbor were kept in the dark about what was about to happen. So when the attack took place it was no surprise to FDR and a great relief to Churchill. This is all spelled out in various books by excellent historians that are ignored by this misleading program. One presumes one still can't tell Americans the truth about Pearl Harbor. PS FDR was completely justified in his scheme since otherwise the UK would have had to surrender to Hitler. FDR's provoking Japan into the attack was the right thing to do. But to try to claim that it took FDR by surprise is silly nonsense, reflected in this deceptive program.",1,nonsense,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1839,"['program', 'sadly', 'misleading', 'facts', 'quite', 'clear', 'now', 'informed', 'people', 'are', 'FDR', 'worked', 'provoke', 'Japanese', 'declaring', 'war', 'One', 'go', 'back', 'August', '1941', 'when', 'met', 'Churchill', 'Placentia', 'Bay', 'Churchill', 'risked', 'crossing', 'Atlantic', 'was', 'bent', 'bringing', 'US', 'war', 'Stalin', 'was', 'full', 'retreat', 'Hitler', 'invasion', 'was', 'almost', 'certain', 'Hitler', 'would', 'be', 'Moscow', 'Christmas', 'Russia', 'were', 'taken', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'curtains', 'UK', 'Hence', 'Churchill', 'convinced', 'FDR', 'had', 'bring', 'US', 'war', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'given', 'anti-war', 'sentiment', 'US', 'was', 'provoke', 'attack', 'would', 'cause', '180', 'degree', 'change', 'US', 'opinion', 'So', 'FDR', 'went', 'back', 'Washington', 'told', 'navy', 'create', 'plan', 'provoke', 'Japan', 'attack', 'was', 'centered', 'US', 'shutting', 'off', 'US', 'oil', 'Japan', 'needed', 'war', 'effort', 'December', 'was', 'successful', 'Japan', 'had', 'determined', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'invade', 'Dutch', 'East', 'Indies', 'lots', 'oil', 'do', 'needed', 'neutralize', 'US', 'fleet', 'could', 'cut', 'communications', 'East', 'Indies', 'Roosevelt', 'knew', 'was', 'works', 'made', 'sure', 'military', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'were', 'kept', 'dark', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'So', 'when', 'attack', 'took', 'place', 'was', 'surprise', 'FDR', 'great', 'relief', 'Churchill', 'spelled', 'out', 'various', 'books', 'excellent', 'historians', 'are', 'ignored', 'misleading', 'program', 'One', 'one', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Americans', 'truth', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'PS', 'FDR', 'was', 'completely', 'justified', 'scheme', 'otherwise', 'UK', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'surrender', 'Hitler', 'FDR', 'provoking', 'Japan', 'attack', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'try', 'claim', 'took', 'FDR', 'surprise', 'silly', 'nonsense', 'reflected', 'deceptive', 'program']",Pearl Harbor: 24 Hours After

1509177,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B0063KYESU,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 3]","On December 7th, the Japanese attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.  In this well-done program, the events of December 7-8 1941 are examined.First of all, as noted in the program, information traveled much slower 70 years ago than it does now, so it was hours later before FDR began to fully understand how damaging the attack really was.  Panic gripped the White House.  FDR believed that the Pearl Harbor attack was the precursor to a Japanese invasion of the Hawaiian islands.  Our military, grossly underfunded and undermanned for years, was now thrust directly into war.  Interestingly, there was an America First rally going on in Pennsylvania while the attack was going on, but the speaker refused to believe that it was real.Several interesting facts about FDR are brought up in the film.  For instance, FDR was suffering from nasal congestion while preparing his speech to be delivered to Congress on December 8th.  Since no antibiotics were available, FDR was given cocaine to shrink the swelling of his sinuses.  FDR also had to wear leg braces due to Polio.  The documentary shows how FDR's assistant had to put the braces on his legs; a process which took 30 minutes.  Then, FDR had to walk into the Senate chamber to deliver his now famous ""Date Which Will Live in Infamy"" speech.  He had great fear of falling while walking to the podium.The attention paid to FDR's speech was very interesting to me.  Many of FDR's cabinet, especially Cordell Hull, wanted FDR to give a long speech, explaining in great detail the losses incurred at Pearl Harbor.  FDR wanted to deliver a shorter speech which would galvanize the nation.  FDR delivered the shorter speech, and it has become one of the most recognizable speeches in American history.I've read books on Pearl Harbor for over twenty years, and I've seen numerous documentaries as well, and this documentary is one of the best I've seen.  Relying on input from history professors and other scholars, this program delves into that first 24 hours of war for the Americans.  Not to be forgotten are Churchill's impact on events and Douglas MacArthur's fateful blunders in the Philippines.I highly recommend this fine program.
