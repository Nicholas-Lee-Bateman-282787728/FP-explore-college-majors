I really believed every moment of this movie.This film marks the only teaming of Greer Garson and Clark Gable.  It was so good that I'm sad they didn't do more movies together.This movie is all about a sailor named Harry Patterson (Gable) who finally decides to take leave in San Francisco. There, he meets the beautiful Emily Sears (Garson), a librarian, who seems very content with her life: single and miserable. After awhile, the two realize they love each other, and get married in Reno. But Harry can't fight his love of the sea, and he leaves his wife, not knowing when he will return.I cry every time I see this movie. It's so heart-warming and real, despite the fact that it was made during WWII and times have definatly changed.Don't forget to look for the part where Harry and Emily steal the chickens! It's funny to watch Greer Garson make chicken sounds!This movie has a magnificent cast including Joan Blondell and Thomas Mitchell.

You think, how in the world is Greer Garson going to fit into this mess?  There's about 25 minutes into the picture to wonder about that.  It's one of Gable's footloose roles.  If they wanted to pair the two, even his fast talking reporter persona would better fit than this knockabout character. Just nuts. Can see Garson in the Kerr role in ""The Hucksters"" or something where he's at least housebroken.  Rough and tumble doesn't suit her. Things don't ring true until Joan Blondell shows up.  Now, that makes sense, but it turns out a brief interlude. She's the only normalcy available in this crazy quilt. With Emily and Harry, it's uphill for a while, then back downhill again. He thinks she's the one that's off the beam and doesn't mind saying so. What a roughneck.  Handsome is as handsome does, and he does the crass lummox all too well in this.

Leonard Maltin is right as usual! I only wished I'd checked his guide before wasting two hours out of my life. This one sinks under it's own weight! A running time of just over 2 hours doesn't help. Gable is such an unsympathetic jerk in this role that it's hard to relate to him, hard to understand why any sane and intelligent woman like the Garson character would want to put up with him over ten minutes. The ending is simplistic, silly and unbelievable and why the film is called ""Adventure"" is beyond me. There is about as much ""adventure"" here as in a Three Stooges short...which by the way would be much more entertaining! A major misfire from MGM!

But while in a San Francisco library, looking up a book on the human soul for his sidekick Mudgin (Thomas Mitchell), Harry meets librarian Emily Sears (Greer Garson), whom he woos, marries, and leaves to sail off on another freighter. When he returns, Emily has retreated to an old farm to await the birth of their child. Harry continues to resent staying in one place, but he ultimately changes his tune when his baby's life hangs in the balance.Greer Garson and Joan Blondell, playing her outspoken best friend, are both terrific, and Gable gives a less heroic performance that's a thoughtful change for him.This film was Clark Gable's first after he returned to Hollywood following his service in the Army Air Corps in World War II. He had joined in August 1942, following the death of his wife Carole Lombard. MGM hyped this film as Gable's big comeback, using the line, ""Gable's Back and Garson's Got Him!"" in the advertising. Audiences at first lined up to see the King back in action, but the novelty wore off and the film flopped.The film was a critical and commercial disaster upon release, effectively ending its star Clark Gable's reign as ""The King of Hollywood"" and his viability as a box office champion. He was so disappointed by the finished film that he did not agree to act again until more than a year had passed.BIOS:1.

Sure it plays on the good girl attracted to bad boy formula, but Gable's character is written to be so miserable that his eventual ""excuse"" scene for being such a jerk doesn't cut it.  Garson is as usual very sincere in her portrayal but comes off as a dumb character for seeing anything in Gable's lowlife personality.  Thomas Mitchell does some solid supporting work but Joan Blondell is over the top in her part most of the film.

That line is in the trailer, on the posters, and it runs through my mind every time I think of this film. This is Clark Gable's first film after coming home from WWII, and the studio made a big to-do about the king's return.This movie toggles between his transition from romantic leading man to a more serious, older actor. He's still wonderful when he woos the ladies, but there is something hidden behind the smile, something that would become more pronounced later in his career.Here Gable is a sailor who comes ashore and begins flirting with beautiful women, as he always does. The saying, ""a girl in every port"" applies to him, and he's got the tattoos to prove it. But when he stumbles into a library with a friend (Thomas Mitchell), he spies an elegant lady (Greer Garson) and her brassy friend (Joan Blondell). His collector's brain makes him follow them, but he comes much more deeply entangled than he ever intended.The pairing with Garson is a bit strange, but it works. Gable could be a leading man to any woman because he refused to adapt to them. His masculinity shines so brightly, it is no wonder that every woman is attracted to him, which is why Gable is such a legend. And it is his personality which carries the film and makes it so enjoyable. The other cast members are wonderful in their own rights, but he is the reason to watch.
