814986,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0001WTUJO,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 2]","This is the Masterpiece Theater version of a story short story by Henry James. It is relatively well done, but it certainly does leave a lot of open questions. Among them is the governess's name: she is just referred to as ""Miss"" throughout the movie. She is hired by a wealthy bachelor to look after his young niece and nephew who have been orphaned and left in his care. He hires her on the condition that he is not to be bothered about the children for any reason. He is seldom at home on his country estate where the children live, and he does not want her to write to him or communicate about the children in any way. So she takes the job knowing that she is completely responsible for all decisions regarding the children.The golden-haired children seem to be little angels at first, but there's something dark and mysterious about them. Unfortunately, all discussions with the housekeeper on the subject of what is wrong are done in typically Victorian euphemism and innuendo. We get the distinct impression it has something to do with sex, and the appearance of two ghosts, the master's former valet and the former governess (who opened the movie with a scene of her drowning herself) is clearly involved. In exactly what way is mostly left to the audience's imagination.The situation grows spookier and spookier, and the question arises: is the governess losing her marbles, or is all this really happening? Is she reading too much into certain events, such as the letter from the boy's school which informs them that the boy has been expelled, but does not say why. A dark undertone appears in the children's personalities, and they are often whispering together in ways that the audience can almost, but not quite, overhear. But the governess' behavior is pretty inexplicable, too.It is, after all, a ghost story, but one that is unique to the genre. I enjoyed it, for all my frustrations in interpretation. Or perhaps because of it, since the ambiguity was clearly part of the author's intention.",3,How to Be Very Disturbing With Inuendo and Euphamism,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2008,"['Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'version', 'story', 'short', 'story', 'Henry', 'James', 'relatively', 'well', 'done', 'certainly', 'leave', 'lot', 'open', 'questions', 'governess', 'name', 'just', 'referred', 'Miss', 'movie', 'hired', 'wealthy', 'bachelor', 'look', 'young', 'niece', 'nephew', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'orphaned', 'left', 'care', 'condition', 'not', 'be', 'bothered', 'children', 'reason', 'seldom', 'home', 'country', 'estate', 'where', 'children', 'live', 'not', 'want', 'write', 'communicate', 'children', 'way', 'job', 'knowing', 'completely', 'responsible', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'children.The', 'golden-haired', 'children', 'seem', 'be', 'little', 'angels', 'first', 'something', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'Unfortunately', 'discussions', 'housekeeper', 'subject', 'what', 'wrong', 'are', 'done', 'typically', 'Victorian', 'euphemism', 'innuendo', 'get', 'distinct', 'impression', 'something', 'do', 'sex', 'appearance', 'two', 'ghosts', 'master', 'former', 'valet', 'former', 'governess', 'who', 'opened', 'movie', 'scene', 'drowning', 'clearly', 'involved', 'exactly', 'what', 'way', 'mostly', 'left', 'audience', 'imagination.The', 'situation', 'spookier', 'spookier', 'question', 'arises', 'governess', 'losing', 'marbles', 'really', 'happening', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'certain', 'events', 'such', 'letter', 'boy', 'school', 'boy', 'been', 'expelled', 'not', 'say', 'why', 'dark', 'undertone', 'children', 'personalities', 'are', 'often', 'whispering', 'together', 'ways', 'audience', 'can', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'overhear', 'governess', 'behavior', 'pretty', 'inexplicable', 'ghost', 'story', 'one', 'unique', 'genre', 'enjoyed', 'frustrations', 'interpretation', 'perhaps', 'ambiguity', 'was', 'clearly', 'part', 'author', 'intention']",N/A

The music is wonderful, just enough to make your spine tingle. The problem here is Jodhi May. She turns in a endlessly one-note performance. She seems to be focussing so hard on not ever blinking, while her mouth is perpetually agape. Mr Bolt must be to blame for this, because she certainly seems a decent actor. Nonetheless, her performance drags this interesting production down into the realm of a cartoon. Unfortunate, for the children and housekeeper - and ghosts - are solid supporting cast.

I read a few reviews before seeing it, and the reviewers were definitely onto something. Mainly, that this is not ""just"" a ghost story. Watch it, and you will see! Plus, I discovered, as was hinted about in some of the reviews, that this story is source material for two other filmmakings with which I'm familiar, and love: the movie ""The Others"" and, who would believe it, the Quentin Collins story of ""Dark Shadows."" And I don't imagine the homage to ""The Turn of the Screw"" stops with just those either! Oh, and about Quentin Collins, Quint? Really, I doubt that's a coincidence. Oh, and if you haven't seen it, you must watch ""The Others."" And I suppose we, those of us who are interested in this storyline, must just break down and read the original novella.

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[5, 5]",This version of Henry James's famous ghost story is well rendered and keeps the storyline while adding some subtle (or not so subtle) insight in to the  mind of the unnamed governess.  Knowing the plot quite well I did not find the movie particularly scary but for someone unfamiliar or who hasn't read the book in awhile there could be some real chills.  And as is so often true in ghost stories the more the movie shows of the spirits the less frightening they become and the viewer gets some real good looks at both Peter Quint and Miss Jessel.

814994,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0001WTUJO,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Henry James' The Turn of the Screw (Penguin Classics) is one of my all-time favorite psychological suspense novels (or supernatural, whichever way you choose to interpret it), and I have watched several adaptations. One of my personal favorites is The Innocents starring Deborah Kerr, which I felt was most faithful to the ambiguous nature of James' text. I have also watched the disturbing The Nightcomers which is not strictly an adaptation of the source, but more of a prequel to the story, based on a novel written by Michael Hastings, The Nightcomers. It stars Marlon Brando as the corrupter Peter Quint and Stephanie Beacham as the doomed Ms. Jessel. Then there's the updated 2009 adaptation starring Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery and Dan Stevens. Finally, I have managed to watch this 1999 Masterpiece Theatre presentation starring Jodhi May. There are some issues with this adaptation (no one adaptation seems to quite live up to James' text), but overall I thought it had some merits that makes this a recommended watch for fans of the story.Jodhi May (who has been in many period dramas, such as &#34;The Woodlanders&#34;, &#34;Daniel Deronda&#34;, &#34;The Aristocrats&#34;, &#34;The House of Mirth&#34;, &#34;The Other Boleyn Girl&#34;, and &#34;The Mayor of Casterbridge&#34;) portrays newly-appointed governess &#34;Miss&#34; who is instructed by her employer &#34;Master&#34; (Colin Firth) to look after his two young charges, Miles (Joe Sowerbutts) and Flora (Grace Robinson) at his English country estate. The one stipulation is that &#34;Miss&#34; is not to trouble him with anything and that she is to oversee all matters and problems herself.Upon her arrival, Miss is warmly welcomed by the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (Pam Ferris) and when she inquires about the previous governess, very little information is forthcoming. Flora (Miles is away at boarding school) is charming and pleasant and Miss finds herself at ease. This ends when she spies a strange man standing atop the stone structure of the house, watching her. Then Miles is sent home for the summer with a letter from his principal explaining Miles has been expelled with no concrete reason given as to why. Things gradually begin to escalate when Miss begins to see not only the man but also the ghostly figure of a woman - it turns out these are Peter Quint and Ms. Jessel, former employees at the house, and they are both dead. To her horror, the governess realizes that her charges' very souls are at stake as they have been corrupted by Quint and Jessel.The film is very atmospheric with the imposing manor house serving as the backdrop to the strange occurrences. The cinematography and score aptly convey the pervasive sense of gloom and mystery. Jodhi May is credible as the hapless governess who tries so very desperately to keep her charges safe from what she perceives to be supernatural evil. I thought the actor who portrayed Miles was credible in his portrayal of the corrupted child and similarly the little girl Flora. The menace quotient here in terms of genuine scares is not very high but on the whole, this is a well-made production that I rank as one of the better made adaptations of &#34;The Turn of the Screw.&#34;",4,"Not of the same caliber as ""The Innocents"" but worth watching nonetheless",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,3220,"['Henry', 'James', 'Turn', 'Screw', 'Penguin', 'Classics', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'novels', 'supernatural', 'whichever', 'way', 'choose', 'interpret', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'adaptations', 'One', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Innocents', 'starring', 'Deborah', 'Kerr', 'felt', 'was', 'most', 'faithful', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'James', 'text', 'have', 'also', 'watched', 'disturbing', 'Nightcomers', 'not', 'strictly', 'adaptation', 'source', 'more', 'prequel', 'story', 'based', 'novel', 'written', 'Michael', 'Hastings', 'Nightcomers', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'corrupter', 'Peter', 'Quint', 'Stephanie', 'Beacham', 'doomed', 'Ms.', 'Jessel', 'Then', 'updated', '2009', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Dan', 'Stevens', 'Finally', 'have', 'managed', 'watch', '1999', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'presentation', 'starring', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'are', 'issues', 'adaptation', 'one', 'adaptation', 'quite', 'live', 'James', 'text', 'overall', 'thought', 'had', 'merits', 'recommended', 'watch', 'fans', 'story.Jodhi', 'May', 'who', 'been', 'many', 'period', 'dramas', 'such', '34', 'Woodlanders', '34', '34', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', '34', '34', 'Aristocrats', '34', '34', 'House', 'Mirth', '34', '34', 'Other', 'Boleyn', 'Girl', '34', '34', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', '34', 'newly-appointed', 'governess', '34', 'Miss', '34', 'who', 'instructed', 'employer', '34', 'Master', '34', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'look', 'two', 'young', 'charges', 'Miles', 'Joe', 'Sowerbutts', 'Flora', 'Grace', 'Robinson', 'English', 'country', 'estate', 'one', 'stipulation', '34', 'Miss', '34', 'not', 'trouble', 'anything', 'oversee', 'matters', 'problems', 'herself.Upon', 'arrival', 'Miss', 'warmly', 'welcomed', 'housekeeper', 'Mrs.', 'Grose', 'Pam', 'Ferris', 'when', 'previous', 'governess', 'very', 'little', 'information', 'forthcoming', 'Flora', 'Miles', 'away', 'boarding', 'school', 'charming', 'pleasant', 'Miss', 'ease', 'when', 'strange', 'man', 'standing', 'stone', 'structure', 'house', 'watching', 'Then', 'Miles', 'sent', 'home', 'summer', 'letter', 'principal', 'explaining', 'Miles', 'been', 'expelled', 'concrete', 'reason', 'given', 'why', 'Things', 'gradually', 'begin', 'escalate', 'when', 'Miss', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'man', 'also', 'ghostly', 'figure', 'woman', 'out', 'are', 'Peter', 'Quint', 'Ms.', 'Jessel', 'former', 'employees', 'house', 'are', 'dead', 'horror', 'governess', 'charges', 'very', 'souls', 'are', 'stake', 'have', 'been', 'corrupted', 'Quint', 'Jessel.The', 'film', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'imposing', 'manor', 'house', 'serving', 'backdrop', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'cinematography', 'score', 'aptly', 'pervasive', 'sense', 'gloom', 'mystery', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'credible', 'hapless', 'governess', 'who', 'so', 'very', 'desperately', 'keep', 'charges', 'safe', 'what', 'be', 'supernatural', 'evil', 'thought', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Miles', 'was', 'credible', 'portrayal', 'corrupted', 'child', 'similarly', 'little', 'girl', 'Flora', 'menace', 'quotient', 'here', 'terms', 'genuine', 'scares', 'not', 'very', 'high', 'whole', 'well-made', 'production', 'rank', 'one', 'better', 'made', 'adaptations', '34', 'Turn', 'Screw.', '34']",N/A
