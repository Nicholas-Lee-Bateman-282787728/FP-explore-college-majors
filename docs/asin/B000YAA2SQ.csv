The main character has the ability to wake the dead if he touch them, however there is a downside to this, if he touch them again they will die again and if he do not touch them again then something else nearby of the same sort will die, to deal with his unusual ability the main character run a pie store where he buy dead and rotten fruit, touch it and he have the freshest fruit in town, oh yeah and he also work with a PI to solve murders, touching the bodies and getting them to tell him who killed them. All is good and dandy until his childhood sweetheart get killed, he touch her, keep her awake and then fall in love with her, problem being if he ever touch her again she will die.The show is part romantic comedy with these two pepole who love one another but who can never touch one another, part mystery as each episode have a new crime to solve and part...well it is hard to explain it. The show is just good, buy it and watch it. The only think which keep this show from five stars from me is that it is a bit short and at times it feels like it is missing something.

He finds this out when his mom dies, and he touches her to bring her back, and his best friend's dad dies in return, then his mom gives him a kiss and she dies too...Sounds totally grim and awful, no? But it's one of the most fantastic shows I've ever, ever seen. It's witty and funny and light and beautiful, full of clever writing and sweet characters but kept from becoming too saccharine by the unrelenting theme of death. Death and love and pie.The show invariably gets wonderful reviews, but while the people who do watch it are utterly enchanted - you don't see many bad comments on the show, it's just so very well made - not quite enough people watched it. So due to the not-quite-high-enough ratings and our current economy, the show gets canceled partway through the second season, but the writer has said he would like to finish the plot-threads in a comic book form or perhaps a TV movie.

The visuals are stunning, the dialogue is fast-paced and smart, and the story is just fantastic enough to be delightful, but not so over-the-top as to be absurd.Okay, I love the show. I love the colors, the score, the characters - everything. However, if I'm going to be honest, I do have one criticism. Here it is:SPOILER ALERTMy one criticism was the character of Chuck. The writers didn't have to, but they basically made her into the Manic Pixie Dream Girl (look up the term on Wikipedia if you don't already know what it means.) Chuck's main purpose is to brighten Ned's dreary life - in fact, that's her ONLY purpose, because she's not even supposed to be alive! So, that's what the writers did. Instead of creating a three-dimensional female character, they inserted a trope. I suppose that was easier, and in a way, it fits the over-the-top style of the show. Kristen Chenoweth's character (Olive) is much more developed and unique than Chuck's, yet she is cast as a Supporting Actress - hell, her character was so well-rounded and so liked that she won an Emmy Award for it! So, that's my one criticism of Pushing Daisies.

These are the characters that keep me coming back for more.  They are in my Dream Emmy Ballot for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.Plot: Every episode we are given a mystery that is to be solved by Ned, Emerson, Chuck, and sometimes Olive.  The mysteries are predictable, but they're fun to watch.  There we're severel songoing storylines throughout the season, including the realtionship between Chuck and Ned, Chuck's two aunts not knowing about her being alive, and Olive's unrequited love with Ned.Score: The score for this show is extravagant.

Yes, I am a Pushing Daisies fan, a lover of a wonderfully bizarre show that while not necessarily appealing to the mass crowd will delight the right audience. In all honesty I cannot critique it with negativity other than to warn that it is a bit different than the usual tv show.A palette of pastel and brightness makes up a modern fairy tale that should be all sorts of macabre considering the subject matter but instead manages to be bright and cute, a flashy setting and story balanced with many instances of brilliantly understated acting.  The storyline and concept are whimsical in nature.  The casting and acting are superb.  Some may be shocked at the pragmatic approach to the power over life and death and exceedingly creative murders, but to me it's all part of the charm.I realize that ""Pushing Daisies"" is something of a cult favorite.

1116633,A1B7RYAGQ7PC7L,B000YAA2SQ,epb,"[8, 9]","I completely agree with the raves this show has gotten, but none of the reviews mentioned directly the element of the show I like most - it progresses. I've abandoned numerous hit tv shows after a season or two because once it was apparent the show WAS a hit, the original plotline is derailed, delayed, often dismissed completely. The Lost cast can't get off the island until the ratings drop, Earl's list suddenly falls by the wayside for wacky adventures, even Mulder and Scully don't give a damn about the aliens anymore, it goes on and on. It's an infuriating betrayal on the part of the storytellers, one I lost my taste for years ago. Imagine the outcry if JK Rowlings had, in the Deathly Hallows, had Voldemort announce a 4-year scheme that would last Harry and Co thru college!Not so PD. The show is episodic, but within it's framework are some ongoing threads, potential time-bombs laid out in the original plot and subsequent episodes, easily recognizable to the experienced tv viewer; these are either exploded or defused, in their own time rather than being artificially delayed for sweeps, the season finale, the series finale, or maybe the heat death of the Universe. All those moments when, watching other shows, you find yourself thinking  - maybe even saying aloud - ""Just SAY it already!"" are followed by the characters doing just that! It's incredible - it's like the writers are actually confident in their ability to come up with new stories and so don't feel the need to drag out one or two plotlines until advertising revenues wane.There's a great feeling of satisfaction to watching (and re-watching) Pushing Daisies as life's doors open and close for the characters, leading them to NEW doors rather than everyone going back and forth through the same doors over and over (yep, Ross and Rachel, I'm talking to YOU).Pushing Daisies is so tightly plotted it could end at a moment's notice with no loose ends.

A man with an unusual gift brings his true love back to life, but can never touch her, else she pushes daisies once more. If you don't see the irony in this, then you might never get the show, because it's one of the most witty, brilliant, and certainly the most ironic on TV today. If nothing else, it gives a much needed weirdly original twist to cascade of murder-solving detective shows on today.Ned has the gift of changing people's cold fortunes, bringing them back to life. Unfortunately, if they're alive for more than 60 seconds, then someone else must take their place in the underworld. Since Ned doesn't want to inadvertently take another's life, he has to touch them again before the clock expires. This is both a blessing and a curse. It's a curse in that his childhood was hell because of it, and he can't touch his girlfriend now. The blessing is he can solve crimes by bringing back the disfigured murder victims to extract the information he needs to solve crimes, which adds income to his pie business, and makes his partner, Emerson Cod rather happy.These facts must be known to get any of the series. But even if you still don't get it, you'll appreciate the characters at least. This show has more quirky character that are so brilliantly developed, you would think this show was on USA. But it's not just the character. Brilliantly designed by all involved, this almost-fanciful world takes cues from people like Tim Burton and other such out-there stylists. The world lives and breaths effortlessly, and amazes you with the irony and quirk of it all.And even though this show is supposed has all the detective/murder-mystery elements that we know and watch endlessly, this show not only adds Ned's unique twist, but also much humor and wit in it's murder stories. Case in point, when Ned brings back the dead for his 60 seconds, they come back with all the scars that killed them. Whether this is a half-rolled face, knives or glass shards sticking out or whatever, it may seem gory, but once you get over the shock factor of the first time, these scenes play for all comedic value, causing you to laugh, no matter how wrong it may be.The cases have also so far turned up must quirk, whether it's the killer who uses real test-crash dummies, or the guy who says his wife killed him, but he has 3 wives, they all take quirky and ironic twists that keep with the show's feel. Never do the cases feel over-done, in fact, they might feel a bit underdone. Because the murder isn't the focus here, it's just a side-story. The show is all about the characters, and there story plays out centerstage, instead of the other way around.And how could I go on without also giving props to the narrator, Jim Dale. Yes, I'd say it's pretty unique for a TV series to have a narrator, and no he does not bore you, but rather, he enchants you with this forensic fairy tale, giving you all the details without it sounding like an explanation.So overall, certainly a show I'll keep watching well into this season to see how things all pie-pan out. It restores faith in the originality of shows on ABC and network TV. Certainly ABC's best show, and certainly must-see TV, Pushing Daisies is the quirkiest and most ironic show on TV today.

This one, like so many others, lacks theme and a super objective for each character, that is, there is no set goal for this series. (Which makes character development uncontrolled, seemingly fake, climax's watered-down, and an uncertainty which can lead to loss of atmosphere and immersion)- For a platonic relationship, there are sexual innuendos and rivalries that makes the targeted audience a bit hazy and the final effect of the reception diluted.- The relationship is hard to believe on the merits to which it was formed. Given this is a Farce, I'll excuse this, if; they add more good, natural substance later on.Bottom Line:Not my cup of tea but this series is not without some artistic perks. It is ultimately meant for those right brain dreamers who are afraid of death and who are also fascinated by it.Personal Opinion:I dislike this environment, dismissing it as fake and cultivating false hope and ideas, avoiding the truth, which I believe is why the show is so popular.

This isn't the first show that's been pulled off air when no one really knew it was on air in the first place and unfortunately it probably won't be the last.  Like with Dead Like Me though, maybe when the DVD gathers a legion of fans we'll see a movie down the track.  Hopefully they do a better job than the movie version of Dead Like Me though.Pushing Daisies is a light set in a surreal world comedy.  It ponders the question if you could bring the dead back to life, firstly would you?  Add in the if you do so and don't touch them again (which permanently leaves them dead) then an innocent nearby will immediately die.  So would you still do it?  For a pie maker named Ned this is his dilemma.  He's decided to use his gift/curse for good and teamed up with a private detective to make a bit of money on the side as well.  As long as he obeys the one minute only rule he can touch and bring back a murder victim, and ask them who killed them.  Easy money, usually, well it wouldn't be much of show if there wasn't twists and challenges to each murder. Throw in the fact that one day a victim is his childhood crush whose father died when Ned didn't understand the rules and you add a whole other element to this great show as Ned and Chuck (the woman) try to have a relationship when they can't touch each other, ever or she'll die. Set in a Dr Seuss looking version of the real world with giant props, bright colours and actors talking a bit unnaturally most of the time, I can understand why some people don't like it. A more realistic version might have worked too but so does this.I also like how you see a lot of stars from TV shows which were made after this such as Glee, Community and others either as regular characters such as pie shop worker Olive or as the murder victims.  The, hey that's whoever from that show, is a nice bonus each time you watch a new episode of this fun show.",5,"Had Never Heard of This Before Buying It, But Glad I Did!",1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,2038,"['Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'when', 'put', 'effort', 'money', 'making', 'show', 'do', 'spend', 'fraction', 'time', 'money', 'marketing', ""n't"", 'first', 'show', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'air', 'when', 'one', 'really', 'knew', 'was', 'air', 'first', 'place', 'unfortunately', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'Dead', 'Me', 'maybe', 'when', 'DVD', 'gathers', 'legion', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'see', 'movie', 'down', 'track', 'Hopefully', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'movie', 'version', 'Dead', 'Me', 'though.Pushing', 'Daisies', 'light', 'set', 'surreal', 'world', 'comedy', 'question', 'could', 'bring', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'firstly', 'would', 'Add', 'do', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'touch', 'again', 'permanently', 'dead', 'then', 'innocent', 'nearby', 'will', 'immediately', 'die', 'So', 'would', 'still', 'do', 'pie', 'maker', 'named', 'Ned', 'dilemma', 'decided', 'use', 'gift/curse', 'good', 'teamed', 'up', 'private', 'detective', 'make', 'bit', 'money', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'long', 'one', 'minute', 'only', 'can', 'touch', 'bring', 'back', 'murder', 'victim', 'ask', 'who', 'killed', 'Easy', 'money', 'usually', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'twists', 'challenges', 'murder', 'Throw', 'fact', 'one', 'day', 'victim', 'childhood', 'crush', 'father', 'died', 'when', 'Ned', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'rules', 'add', 'whole', 'other', 'element', 'great', 'show', 'Ned', 'Chuck', 'woman', 'try', 'have', 'relationship', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'other', 'ever', ""'ll"", 'die', 'Set', 'Dr', 'Seuss', 'looking', 'version', 'real', 'world', 'giant', 'props', 'bright', 'colours', 'actors', 'talking', 'bit', 'unnaturally', 'most', 'time', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'more', 'realistic', 'version', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'too', 'so', 'this.I', 'also', 'how', 'see', 'lot', 'stars', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'made', 'such', 'Glee', 'Community', 'others', 'regular', 'characters', 'such', 'pie', 'shop', 'worker', 'Olive', 'murder', 'victims', 'whoever', 'show', 'nice', 'bonus', 'time', 'watch', 'new', 'episode', 'fun', 'show']",Pushing Daisies:S1 (DVD)

I've seen an episode or two of Friends, which I found tedious and glib, and Seinfeld, which never really grabbed me. I enjoyed the brief-lived Andy Richter series, but that is probably the last one I saw with regularity. I had never heard of Pushing Daisies before my daughter gave it to me as a gift, and I was not expecting much when I looked at the packaging. But I (and my wife) have been repeatedly surprised and pleased. Season 1 offers 9 episodes of clever writing and gorgeous photography, and mostly lovely acting. I am grateful we got the HDTV; the colors just explode out of the screen. And with the multiple cameras and extensive birds-eye shots it is, as someone else here says, like watching 40 minute feature films.With 140+ sterling reviews already published, there's not much I need to add. I would say, though, that with the above mentioned Friends and Seinfeld, the acting was always acting. I could never lose sight of the fact that these were highly paid people mouthing (or mugging) lines written for them. In Pushing Daisies though, the acting is so smooth and so pleasant, that even though the plots are outlandish and the magic very magical, the skillful performances of nearly everyone make it a joy to watch. Special kudos to Kristin Chenoweth, who takes a role that was probably conceived of as a one-joke cardboard stiff and makes it alive and caring and charming.

It's a very quirky, sometimes dark, but always beautiful series.

Without you, I wouldn't know the joy of the series.Pushing Daisies is about a boy/man named Ned who discovers his power to bring dead things back to life by touching them when his canine companion runs into traffic and is hit by a semi. As the poor boy is hunched over his dog trying to come to terms with its death, he touches it and the dog walks off like nothing happened. Ned continues to explore his new powers when his mother suddenly drops dead as a result of a blood clot. He touches her and she immediately comes back to life. Unbeknownst to Ned or his mother, there are a couple catches (as always!). First, if the revived person lives for more than a minute, something else must go. Think of the alchemy principal, an equal exchange must be made. Second, he can only touch the revived person once. If he touches them a second time, they are dead and cannot be revived again.As you probably guessed, this sets up a devastating tragedy where Ned revives his childhood sweetheart and decides to keep her alive. Trouble is, now he cannot touch her as much as he desperately wants to because doing so would end things between them forever.The sets are visually amazing, something out of a dark Tim Burton movie. The constant theme of death is toyed with so much that almost all of the emotion associated with it is lost, which is difficult to do in most cases. In &#34;Pushing Daisies&#34; it is simply another part of the plot line, bringing people back to life to discover who killed them. Think of CSI with more quirks and less science.

It was clever, well written, well acted, and all around a captivating story.  I really liked the juxtaposition of the dark and light, the grim and the funny, the nightmare and the dream.  I waited eagerly every week to see what new twists and turns the story would take, and how long they could keep it going.Unfortunately, about two thirds through the first season, the series started running out of steam.  The same jokes kept getting rehashed over and over, and the story began to take on the almost desperate tone of a TV series that had been on the air for too many seasons.  Except, in this case, it was only one season.  I found myself bored and disappointed before the end of season one, and thought it needed to be wrapped up gracefully as possible.The plot had been brilliant, but did not provide enough soil to grow a whole crop of ""Daisies""!  I am honestly sorry that this idea was expressed in a long, laborious TV series, instead of a feature length film or made for TV movie.  The subject matter could have been adequately explored in a 2 hour time slot, and at least there would have been an end to the story that had a limited amount to say.  This could have been a quirky masterpiece, but it was compromised by an attempt to make it more than it really was.  I am not surprised it was cancelled after season two - they ran out of things to say LONG before the first season ended.  I didn't bother watching season 2 when if was first aired, but I am a member of Netflix, and when it showed up on instant streaming I gave the second season a chance.  I was so bored that I couldn't make it all the way through the first episode of season 2.  After the first few minutes, I remembered why I had lost interest before.A lot of people liked this show and were loyal to the end.  Those people don't need a review to tell them whether or not to buy this series.  However, if you have not seen it, you might benefit from watching clips on YouTube before purchasing.  Or another idea for those who subscribe to NetFlix - both seasons are avaliable to members through DVD or instant streaming. ALSO:  MY PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS BOTH SEASONS FOR FREE - you should check with your library.  Why spend the money buying it unless you know for sure you will like it?  Just watch it at one of the free venues and see if you like it before you buy it.Just my humble opinion, but after the initial rush of interest, I ran out of gas on this one.",2,"It Was Interesting at First, but the Premise Wore Thin Very Fast",1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,2510,"['liked', 'show', 'first', 'was', 'fascinated', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'clever', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'captivating', 'story', 'really', 'liked', 'juxtaposition', 'dark', 'light', 'grim', 'funny', 'nightmare', 'dream', 'waited', 'eagerly', 'week', 'see', 'what', 'new', 'twists', 'story', 'would', 'take', 'how', 'long', 'could', 'keep', 'going.Unfortunately', 'about', 'two', 'thirds', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'started', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'same', 'jokes', 'kept', 'getting', 'rehashed', 'story', 'began', 'take', 'almost', 'desperate', 'tone', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'air', 'too', 'many', 'seasons', 'case', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'found', 'bored', 'disappointed', 'end', 'season', 'one', 'thought', 'needed', 'be', 'wrapped', 'up', 'gracefully', 'possible.The', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'brilliant', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'enough', 'soil', 'grow', 'whole', 'crop', 'Daisies', 'am', 'honestly', 'sorry', 'idea', 'was', 'expressed', 'long', 'laborious', 'TV', 'series', 'instead', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'adequately', 'explored', '2', 'hour', 'time', 'slot', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'story', 'had', 'limited', 'amount', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quirky', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'compromised', 'attempt', 'make', 'more', 'really', 'was', 'am', 'not', 'surprised', 'was', 'cancelled', 'season', 'two', 'ran', 'things', 'say', 'LONG', 'first', 'season', 'ended', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'season', '2', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'am', 'member', 'Netflix', 'when', 'showed', 'up', 'instant', 'streaming', 'gave', 'second', 'season', 'chance', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'way', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'remembered', 'why', 'had', 'lost', 'interest', 'before.A', 'lot', 'people', 'liked', 'show', 'were', 'loyal', 'end', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'review', 'tell', 'not', 'buy', 'series', 'However', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'might', 'benefit', 'watching', 'clips', 'YouTube', 'purchasing', 'idea', 'who', 'subscribe', 'NetFlix', 'seasons', 'are', 'avaliable', 'members', 'DVD', 'instant', 'streaming', 'ALSO', 'MY', 'PUBLIC', 'LIBRARY', 'HAS', 'BOTH', 'SEASONS', 'FOR', 'FREE', 'should', 'check', 'library', 'Why', 'spend', 'money', 'buying', 'know', 'sure', 'will', 'like', 'Just', 'watch', 'one', 'free', 'venues', 'see', 'like', 'buy', 'it.Just', 'humble', 'opinion', 'initial', 'rush', 'interest', 'ran', 'gas', 'one']",Pushing Daisies:S1 (DVD)

1116693,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000YAA2SQ,Mark Baker,"[4, 4]","This show is like nothing you have ever seen before.  And that is a good thing.It is the story of the Pie Maker aka Ned (Lee Pace).  To the world, he is best known as the owner of The Pie Hole, where he serves delicious pies with his assistant/waitress, Olive (Kristen Chenoweth).But Ned has a secret.  With his touch, he can bring the dead back to life.  Of course, there are some conditions.  If he touches them again, they are dead for ever and ever.  And if he doesn't touch them again in one minute, someone else nearby dies instead.Since The Pie Hole doesn't pay all the bills, Ned works with private investigator Emerson Cod (Chi McBride).  He brings murder victims back to life to find out who killed them, then the two split the reward.Everything is going along fine until the next murder victim is the girl he calls Chuck, aka Charlotte Charles (Anna Friel).  Chuck was Ned's childhood sweetheart, and he just can't bear to let her die, so he keeps her alive.  While the two build a non-touch romance, Chuck's two aunts, Vivian and Lily (Ellen Greene and Swoosie Kurtz) mourn her death.But Chuck's death is just the beginning of the weird cases.  There are the human crash test dummies, the dog breeder with four wives, the bodies in the snowmen, and the exploding scratch and sniff book.  And that doesn't even mention my favorite case, the headless horseman who is after Olive.So by now I'm sure you've figured out just how weird this show really is.  But it is so much fun, too.  While it is a mystery, the mysteries are only a background to explore the relationships of the characters in the show.  Each week, those relationships advance, grow, and change.  You never know just where they will wind up.And that's not to mention the look of the show.  Every set and costume uses bright colors and vivid light.  The show was made for HD, and I can't wait to watch it on my new HD-TV.  Plus the make up on the dead bodies is outstanding.  If they don't win some Emmys for make up, something is seriously wrong.And I must admit, I love the show's humor.  The lines come fast and furious with plenty of banter, especially between Ned and Chuck.  Jim Dale is also in the cast as the omniscient narrator, and he adds his own touch to the show.Yes, this show is quirky and odd.  But please don't let that stop you.  Get this set and give it a try.  You'll be hook on the quirky before you know what hit you.",5,"And Now, for Something Completely Different",1221523200,"09 16, 2008",2008,2413,"['show', 'nothing', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'good', 'thing.It', 'story', 'Pie', 'Maker', 'aka', 'Ned', 'Lee', 'Pace', 'world', 'best', 'known', 'owner', 'Pie', 'Hole', 'where', 'delicious', 'pies', 'assistant/waitress', 'Olive', 'Kristen', 'Chenoweth', '.But', 'Ned', 'secret', 'touch', 'can', 'bring', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'course', 'are', 'conditions', 'again', 'are', 'dead', 'ever', 'ever', ""n't"", 'touch', 'again', 'one', 'minute', 'someone', 'else', 'nearby', 'dies', 'instead.Since', 'Pie', 'Hole', ""n't"", 'pay', 'bills', 'Ned', 'private', 'investigator', 'Emerson', 'Cod', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'murder', 'victims', 'back', 'life', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'then', 'two', 'split', 'reward.Everything', 'going', 'along', 'fine', 'next', 'murder', 'victim', 'girl', 'Chuck', 'aka', 'Charlotte', 'Charles', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Chuck', 'was', 'Ned', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'let', 'die', 'alive', 'two', 'build', 'non-touch', 'romance', 'Chuck', 'two', 'aunts', 'Vivian', 'Lily', 'Ellen', 'Greene', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'mourn', 'death.But', 'Chuck', 'death', 'just', 'beginning', 'weird', 'cases', 'are', 'human', 'crash', 'test', 'dummies', 'dog', 'breeder', 'four', 'wives', 'bodies', 'snowmen', 'exploding', 'scratch', 'sniff', 'book', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'favorite', 'case', 'headless', 'horseman', 'who', 'Olive.So', 'now', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'weird', 'show', 'really', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'too', 'mystery', 'mysteries', 'are', 'only', 'background', 'explore', 'relationships', 'characters', 'show', 'week', 'relationships', 'advance', 'grow', 'change', 'never', 'know', 'just', 'where', 'will', 'wind', 'up.And', 'not', 'mention', 'look', 'show', 'set', 'costume', 'uses', 'bright', 'colors', 'vivid', 'light', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'HD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'new', 'HD-TV', 'make', 'up', 'dead', 'bodies', 'outstanding', 'do', ""n't"", 'win', 'Emmys', 'make', 'up', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong.And', 'must', 'admit', 'love', 'show', 'humor', 'lines', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'plenty', 'banter', 'especially', 'Ned', 'Chuck', 'Jim', 'Dale', 'also', 'cast', 'omniscient', 'narrator', 'own', 'touch', 'show.Yes', 'show', 'quirky', 'odd', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'Get', 'set', 'give', 'try', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hook', 'quirky', 'know', 'what', 'hit']",Pushing Daisies:S1 (DVD)

The creator, Bryan Fuller, is a mad, creative genius (Wondetfalls!), and I think he simply flurished in this crazy, quirky world of Ned The Pie Maker, played by Lee Pace.We meet Ned when he's 9 years old and he discovers he's got a unique gift. If he touches anything dead, he can bring it back to life. BUT, if he touches it again, it's dead for good. And he also learns that in order to give something life, something else has to die. He later learns that he has a time limit of 60 seconds before something/someone dies for the thing/one that he ressurects. Crazy, huh?But it's not just the situation of our principal character, it's the world in which he lives and works in. He brings back his childhood sweetheart Chuck, who was murdered, but she can't tell her beloved aunts she's not dead because they buried her. And the maddening consequence of their newfound relationship is they can't touch, or else she dies for good.Our other characters, Emerson Cod, the PI that finds out about Ned's ability and uses it to awaken murdered people to find out who killed them and collect the rewards.

The only problem is that if they ever touch, she will die for good.The support cast include a reward seeking, former detective, a pie shop assistant, the pie maker's dog (brought back to life at the expense of a squirrel), a deadpan, morgue worker (pun intended) and two aunts of Charlotte (Chuck) ,who use to be mermaid swimmers in a circus.What if you could be raised from the dead for one minute and then put back to being dead?  What if you survived that one minute but someone else or some other living being had to die in your place?

It's different, it's creative, it's intelligent, it's zany, and it's written byBryanFuller.  And, surprisingly, enough people watch it for it NOT to get cancelled!  If we're in the renaissance of television--which judging on how many great shows are either in production or on their way, we definitely are--this show is a marker to show that audiences are ready and willing for something different.There are so many different tastes baked into the pie that is ""Pushing Daisies"" that, at first, it seems like there is too much.  The characters first appear to be caricatures, which makes it all the more relevant when they are fleshed out.  Their little acts of kindness to each other in this non-saccharine show seem so tiny but mean so much.  Each episode is driven by detective work, romance, exploration of death, fantasy, pie making, and fairy tale intrigue that some say is reminiscent of Burton, but I'd say that Bryan Fuller's end product here is more like what Burton aims for but just misses.It's not as instantly spectacular as Fuller'sDead Like Me, nor can I say I love it as unconditionally as his last show,Wonderfalls.

1116719,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000YAA2SQ,Robert Moore,"[36, 42]","Now that the format wars are over and Blu Ray has won out over HD TV, I have taken the high def plunge.  And the first thing that I have purchased in Blu Ray is PUSHING DAISIES.  It won't be out until September, but for symbolic reasons I made this my first purchase in the format.  The series is so visually stunning that it is perfect for high def presentation.Season One of PUSHING DAISIES ended prematurely. Sadly, the show, which was supposed to run through 22 episodes, has ended at 9. Many shows have been adversely affected by the WGA strike, but except for FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (which not only is going to be cancelled, but did not even get to wrap up its final season, so that it will end with the narrative dangling, an unfitting end to one of the most brilliant shows on TV) none as much for my money as PUSHING DAISIES. This is simply one of the most original, extraordinary shows in the history of television. I awaited the arrival of each of the nine episodes comprising Season One like many await the release of highly anticipated films. That we got only the fraction of a season is heartbreaking.In case anyone questions whether the season is indeed over, creator and producer Bryan Fuller has stated bluntly that the show will not resume production until next summer, when they will start work on Season Two. And to make it all even more definite, this past week it was announced that Anna Friel, who plays Chuck on the show, will very shortly start filming LAND OF THE LOST with Will Ferrell. You can't shoot new episodes if your female lead is unavailable.What makes this so heartbreaking is how incredibly fresh and original this show was from the very first episode. I was enthralled from the very first seconds. As the camera moves up from underneath the earth, through the roots of the plants and grass just under the surface, and then up to reveal a vividly yellow field of flowers through which young Ned is running, I was completely entranced. Everything about the show affected me in similar fashion from the music, to the extraordinary use of color (the color is what causes many people to compare it to AMELIE), to the relentless number of wonderful sets. I've never seen a show that I have found so visually exciting.And luckily the writing and the acting is every bit as good as the art design. It is almost impossible to over praise the writing on the show for two reasons. First, when you watch the first episode, it is so stunningly good that your immediate reaction is: they can't possibly keep this level of excellence up. Yet, they do. In fact, the show doesn't merely stay as good as the pilot (or ""Pie-lette,"" as it is titled), it gets better. The show doesn't merely have a brilliant premise, but has a plan. Although we've had only 9 episodes, any viewer will definitely get the sense that this show is going someplace very specific. Second, the show features some of the wittiest dialogue ever found on television. Many compare the dialogue to that on THE GILMORE GIRLS, both for its immense cleverness and wonderful wordplay, but for its sheer quantity. Without doubt those two shows probably have more words per minute than any shows ever previously seen. (Interestingly, some of PUSHING DAISIES is filmed on the part of the back lot upon which THE GILMORE GIRLS was filmed.) Part of the reason for this is that any spots that on other shows would result in silence on PUSHING DAISIES provides an opportunity for the Narrator, who embellishes the story in marvelous fashion. Other shows have featured narrators, but in my opinion only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT does so quite so well.PUSHING DAISIES features a wonderful if somewhat compact ensemble cast. Lee Pace, whom many may know from an earlier Bryan Fuller series WONDERFALLS (on which he played the main character's brother), plays Ned aka The Pie Maker, who ""isn't like the other boys,"" in that whenever he touches a dead thing he brings it back to life, with two caveats. First, if he touches that dead thing (or person) a second time, they will be dead forever. Second, if he doesn't touch it or them again within 60 seconds, something else must die in its place. Anna Friel plays Ned's great childhood love Chuck aka Dead Girl, who is brought back to life by Ned after she was murdered. Of course, this means that Ned and Chuck can never touch directly, which is, as Olive Snook points out, tragic (""notwithstanding big ticket items like genocide and death""). The outrageously talented Kristin Chenoweth plays Olive. Although one of the great Broadway musical talents of her time, neither TV nor the movies have found a way to take advantage of her. Until now. At first I was perplexed why they would cast such a huge talent in what was clearly the second female lead, but as the series goes along Olive quickly became one of my favorite characters. And Kristin even sang a song, performing ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" in one of the season's highlights. Ned's partner in solving crime, the delightfully named Emerson Cod, is played by Chi McBride. Emerson is hands down the funniest, most delightful character on the show and perhaps a majority of the funniest lines on the show are uttered by McBride. Chuck's aunts are played by two more Broadway stars, Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene. The Narrator is performed by Jim Dale, who is perhaps best known as the reader of the Harry Potter books on CD. For me he is one of the most wonderful things about the show, providing precisely the right texture and background to every scene. But one other performer has to be mentioned, or rather a pair of performers. I can't tell them apart and I don't know the name of the second ""actor,"" but Orbit and another Golden Retriever play Ned's dog Digby. Orbit played JD (short for Just Dog) on an earlier Bryan Fuller series, DEAD LIKE ME. I have no idea how they get the reactions on film that ""Digby"" makes to things that happen around him, but to watch him you'd swear he really is acting. My favorite Digby scene might be his interaction with Olive during her singing of ""Hopelessly Devoted.""As much as I love this show I have to add that I've been amazed and perplexed that not everyone I know who has seen it has liked it. Some don't like the Narrator. Some don't like the fast-paced dialogue. I simply can't account for this. PUSHING DAISIES does have a very definite style. I suppose that if the style rubs you the wrong way, you might not like it. But for me and several of my closest friends, this is one of the most magical shows I've ever seen. My two all time favorite shows are BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. How much do I love PUSHING DAISIES? Although there have been only 9 episodes, right now I am inclined to say that I love it as much as those two, making it one of my three all time favorite shows. Which is just another reason why I have been so upset by its truncated debut season. But with the writers strike finally about to end (as I write this it has been indicated that the union will vote two days from now on the new contract), I am eagerly looking forward to Season Two. What accidentally turned out to be the final episode of Season One did end on a bit of a cliffhanger and works fairly well as a transition to Season Two.

You end up enjoying every single episode, as outlandish as they are, and liking every single character on the show. Its premise, though far-fetched, is enjoyable and fresh.A man who can revive the dead with the touch of his finger might be in better shape than Ned the Piemaker. He seems sad in his life. Yes, he can bring back dead things to life, but if they remain alive longer than a minute, then something else in the world has to die. He is alone in his life, or at least, he feels that way. That's why he's decided to drown his sorrow in his pie shop, where his quirky waitress, a perfect and adorable Kristin Chenoweth, is secretly in love with him. In all honesty, Chenoweth is the reason to watch this show. I can't seem to get enough of her!Ned's life takes a sharp turn when, while investigating the death of a young woman, he ends up reviving his childhood crush, Chuck. Once she's back to life, he can't seem to kill her again and, soon enough, love is in the air between the dead girl and the piemaker.Every episode is written as a small mystery in which Ned and his gang of colorful characters investigate a death. He revives the dead for a minute in order to receive clues that could help them solve the myseteries behind their death. These moments are always funny and fresh.But what amazes in the show, besides the incredible performances, is the cinematography. The show is incredibly beautiful to look at. The colors are vibrant, the sets original, the costumes always over the top. Its always a pleasure to watch this show.Sure, being a fresh series, it has its share of small problems. Lee Pace (Ned) often tries too hard to be cute and Chuck is just too good for her own good. And yet, these small flaws take nothing away from this show.

1116736,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B000YAA2SQ,the masked reviewer,"[168, 173]","Alternately funny and whimsical, PUSHING DAISIES is a visually distinctive romantic comedy that encompasses a truly winning mix of ingredients. With its modern fairy tale settings and exploding color schemes - along with perfect but unobtrusive narration by Broadway veteran Jim Dale - comparisons to the work of Tim Burton are all but unavoidable. (In a good way.)As in his previous outing (DEAD LIKE ME), series creator Bryan Fuller explores the great beyond but this time the results are much more impressive. The entire series centers around Ned (an utterly charming Lee Pace), who - at an early age - discovers that he possesses the power to bring the dead back to life with just a touch of his finger. The tradeoff? If he touches that person again, they will remain dead forever. And leaving the dead resurrected for longer than a minute causes someone else in the immediate vicinity to die. Cruel? Perhaps. But the universe demands a cosmic balance - and this is its solution.Ned - the owner of a fairly successful pie shop known as `The Pie Hole' - uses his unique gift to earn a living in two ways: His astonishing pies, where his special touch invigorates the fruit with incredible flavor; and helping a detective (Chi McBride), who accidentally witnessed Ned's gift first-hand, solve murder cases. How? He revives the victims long enough to find out who killed them and then the two of them split the reward money. This can, and usually does, lead to near dangerous adventures for the two of them. Sounds exciting - but as Ned's co-worker Olive (the adorable Kristin Chenoweth of Broadway's WICKED) points out, it's a detached, emotionally frigid existence.That is, until Charlotte enters his life again.Charlotte or ""Chuck"" as she is called (played by Brit actress Anna Friel), is the girl Ned loved as a child before she moved away. When Ned and the detective discover the murdered Chuck on one of their cases, Ned brings her back to life for a sizable reward but can't bring himself to kill her, creating this dilemma: Although Ned and Chuck are strongly drawn to each other, they can never, EVER touch.PUSHING DAISIES is loaded with stars from film, TV and the stage (Paul Ruebens, Raul Esparza, Molly Shannon, Swoosie Kurtz, Ellen Greene, Christopher Seiber, Barbara Barrie, Grant Shaud - to name but a few), and it's clear that everyone is having a marvelous time. The series is filled with tons of clever touches and Lee Pace, full of childlike vulnerability, is an immensely likable lead. His palpable longing for Anna Friel's Chuck is both sweet and touching. Seldom, however, has a series predicated on keeping two characters romantically apart established such a seemingly insurmountable barrier to insure that they remain that way.As long as the creators can sustain the high level of entertainment that the first (as of this writing) nine episodes have provided, one can only pray that this highly original and gorgeous looking television experiment keeps going for years to come.",5,A Delight!!
