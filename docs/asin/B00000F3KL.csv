497510,A2YK2MBP8KH1FD,B00000F3KL,"A. Carey ""adamarket""","[1, 3]","Black Hawk Down is a terrific, bullet-by-bullet account of the events in Somalia in 1993. To that extent, it is faithful to the original source material by Mark Bowden. Reading the book and watching the movie, I was reminded of reading 'The Iliad' when I was a teenager. Like Black Hawk Down, The Iliad is  basically a chronicle of the deaths of the men fighting in a war.Where the film departs the book is in providing  any kind of context, meaning or understanding of the two-day firefight in Mogadishu. We are treated to realistic set pieces depicting the nature of modern war, but denied any hope of appreciating the motivations behind the mob who set upon the U.S. soldiers that day. This attitude of ignorance towards the enemy is in tune with the times. After September 11th, the Bush Administration also rejected any attempt to understand the terrorists responsible, as if knowing your enemy was somehow tantamount to sympathizing with them. I guess none of these men have ever read Sun Tzu, whose 'Art of War,' makes the point that understanding your enemy is the key to defeating him.The ""Skinnies"" in Bowden's book had brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters. Many of them had been killed by in-fighting between the warring clans or sometimes, by American ordinance. Bowden's book does not moralize about who's right and who's wrong. These questions have no place in the real world of war. The book merely tells the story of two opposing sides forced into a violent encounter heated by years of war and months of U.S. meddling in the region. The Somalis were tired of being roughed up and pushed around and the U.S. Rangers and D-Boys flown into Mogadishu that day caught the rough end of their frustrations as they attempted to defend their homes and country, not a warlord called Aidid.The U.S. soldiers themselves were not bad men; they were merely symbols of a larger power in the wrong place that day. The futility of the battle and its ultimate meaningless came across loud and clear in the book. In the end, the soldiers' only justification for fighting was to protect and back up the man next to him. In that alone, there is a kind of nobility. The film touches upon this recurring theme in Bowden's book near the end of the movie as one D-Boy explains why he continues to do the job.Ultimately, with the movie version, I couldn't work out whether war was meant to disgust me (a la 'Private Ryan') or turn me on and get me to a recruiting office. Unfortunately, Jerry Bruckheimer's involvement in the project (Top Gun - a slick recruitment movie for the Airforce), makes me think it may be the latter.",4,"What's War Good For?

Almost every book/film can be boiled down to a protagonist thrown into a situation where he has to overcome adversity. This is the key element of this film as well.Practically everything in this film was taken from real life accounts with some Hollywood thrown in (of course) to try to portray a picture of what it might have been like, but also about the people involved.Having served in the Navy from 92-02, I was not in the area when this happened, but by the time I arrived at COMSIXTHFLT from 96-99 the entire attitude of the African continent was ""Man..that is one big cluster down there"". I have to admit I was of that mentality as well. Too confusing, too many people wanting to kill each other, etc.. and of course we had all heard the stories about Somalia and what went on there. I never really had an appreciation of what the U.N. forces had to go through as well as the mindset of the Somalians. It was especially interesting to see some scenes of the Somalians when they had speaking roles (vice the mob mentality) and their motivations.There are many pros throughout that make it a good film. The directing is topnotch, the cinematography and action as well, so even if you don't really care about what actually happened you will get a pretty good ""war"" film. If you care and are interested about this particular spot in history the DVD is a good buy. The special features on it will give you more background of exactly what went on with interviews of the folks on the ground.Having never been there I cannot say how accurate the recreation of the enviroment they were thrown into was, but it seemed pretty real to me. I thought he captured a good feel of what it was like to be under duress. The scenes with the Convoy moving through the city were probably the best in the film and I can comment from personal expierience on the relationship between Intelligence and Operator can be a bit...well...frustrating at times.There were a few scenes i could count as forced. In one scene where the convoy was getting ready to suit up and head back into the city there is a conversation between a senior enlisted soldier and a private, which actually happened, but in the film it seemed very forced and unreal. I think this could have been done a bit better with more introduction to the Private who did not want to return to the city.Whether you are looking for a good action movie or a film that tries (and mostly does) recreate a fragment of U.S. history then this is definately worth your money to buy.",4,Movie about soldiers..,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,2590,"['political', 'considerations', 'aside', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'soldiers', 'book/film', 'can', 'be', 'boiled', 'down', 'protagonist', 'thrown', 'situation', 'where', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'key', 'element', 'film', 'well.Practically', 'everything', 'film', 'was', 'taken', 'real', 'life', 'accounts', 'Hollywood', 'thrown', 'course', 'try', 'portray', 'picture', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'also', 'people', 'involved.Having', 'served', 'Navy', '92-02', 'was', 'not', 'area', 'when', 'happened', 'time', 'arrived', 'COMSIXTHFLT', '96-99', 'entire', 'attitude', 'African', 'continent', 'was', 'Man..that', 'one', 'big', 'cluster', 'there', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'mentality', 'as', 'well', 'Too', 'confusing', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'wanting', 'kill', 'other', 'etc..', 'course', 'had', 'heard', 'stories', 'Somalia', 'went', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'appreciation', 'what', 'U.N.', 'forces', 'had', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'mindset', 'Somalians', 'was', 'especially', 'interesting', 'see', 'scenes', 'Somalians', 'when', 'had', 'speaking', 'roles', 'vice', 'mob', 'mentality', 'motivations.There', 'are', 'many', 'pros', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'directing', 'topnotch', 'cinematography', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'will', 'get', 'pretty', 'good', 'war', 'film', 'care', 'are', 'interested', 'particular', 'spot', 'history', 'DVD', 'good', 'buy', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'background', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'interviews', 'folks', 'ground.Having', 'never', 'been', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'how', 'accurate', 'recreation', 'enviroment', 'were', 'thrown', 'was', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'real', 'thought', 'captured', 'good', 'feel', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'duress', 'scenes', 'Convoy', 'moving', 'city', 'were', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'can', 'comment', 'personal', 'expierience', 'relationship', 'Intelligence', 'Operator', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'well', 'frustrating', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'i', 'could', 'count', 'as', 'forced', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'convoy', 'was', 'getting', 'ready', 'suit', 'up', 'head', 'back', 'city', 'conversation', 'senior', 'enlisted', 'soldier', 'private', 'actually', 'happened', 'film', 'seemed', 'very', 'forced', 'unreal', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'more', 'introduction', 'Private', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'return', 'city.Whether', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'mostly', 'recreate', 'fragment', 'U.S.', 'history', 'then', 'definately', 'worth', 'money', 'buy']",N/A

497513,AT2J7H5TRZM8Z,B00000F3KL,A Customer,"[1, 7]","Wow, it seems that most of the movies that are debuting on the scene throughout North America carry the same theme. That idea being one of war; and by golly it isn't pretty. Out of the past 5 movies I have viewed in theatres, 3 of those involved hardcore gun battles. Pearl Harbour, Enemy of the Gates and now today's debut release of Black Hawk Down.So Tell Me Where We AreThe movie begins in the year 1993, located in the capital of Somalia, Mogadishu. The film is based on a true event that occurred back in that year.The story revolves around a detailing description of a US Military adventure in Somalia. War is definitely hell as the film visually describes it. The leader of Somalia Mohamed Farah Aidid have been accused of harming innocent civilians and stealing the food that the United Nations has conveniently provided for the starving Somali citizens. Over 300,000 Somalians died of starvation as noted in the movie prologues credits.Two military teams from the US :Delta ForceTask Force Rangers.... have teamed up to rid the Taliban like militia groups surrounding the capital.The Americans in this film extremely underestimated the will power of the Somalians to fight back. After losing a man, the whole 11 hour mission turns into a half day of rescuing.Throughout the film, choppers go down, and the American Military motto ""Nobody Gets Left Behind"" seems like a bad decision as the movie progresses. The first injury leads to a huge string of bad luck that forces the Americans in and out of the town for 11 hours.The amount of bloody scenes throughout the movie are incredible. I almost turned my stomach on 5 separate occasions. If you have kids, now is not the time to use the power of adult accompaniment!The images of Somali lifestyle are extremely exaggerated as pictures of one of my friends vacation shows that it is not some sort of wasteland. Most people will agree with what they see in the film and build up that ""hellhole"" impression of Somalia, but not me.The first 40 minutes is preparation for the war; the remainder is a constant battle, gunshots every 4 seconds and that is a fact. We don't really get to learn about how the characters got into the army; who they interact well with; etc. Come to think of it, after all the complaints of Pearl Harbour and its run-on plot, this seemed like the most sufficient way to narrate the film.Final Thoughts on Black Hawk DownJosh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepherd and Ewen Bremner and some characters we can remember from Pearl Harbour fill the movies cast. The movie directed by Ridley Scott is a somewhat accurate picture of the events that occured back 8 years ago and rates a 7 with me. The action scenes I believed were pretty good, yet at some times were very repetitive and trailed too much.The acting was pretty good considering each actor was portraying themselves as an action figure. Dialogue seemed to not matter in this one.I finally saw a new release on the first day and would recommend this film to anyone who has a good stomach.

497514,A2RQYLOWN92CCK,B00000F3KL,A Customer,"[3, 5]","By focusing without distraction on the mission at hand, Black Hawk Down breaks out of the pack in Hollywood's long history of combat movies. It does so, in ironic screen timing, by reminding us of a battle that turned many against American troop commitment.Ridley Scott's likely Oscar nominee, adapted from Mark Bowden's same-name book, extols the sheer professionalism of America's elite Delta Force - even in the unforeseen disaster that was 1993's Battle of Mogadishu.In relating the conflict, in which 18 Americans died and 70-plus were injured, the standard getting-to-know-you war-film characterizations are downplayed. While some may regard this as a shortcoming, it is, in fact, a virtue, given the nuts-and-bolts movie Gladiator/Hannibal director Scott and company have elected to make.If ever there were a story in which logistics should dominate, this is it - and besides, smart casting fills in the personality gaps. It's clear the movie is going to have all the human element it needs when we see that commanding Gen. William F. Garrison is played by Sam Shepard, who could have been a superstar in Hollywood's golden age of screen heroes.The midtown U.N. peacekeeping mission, intended to capture two lieutenants of Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, was billed as maybe an hour's assignment. Following debacles that afflicted both air and ground forces, the ensuing firefights escalated that time frame 15-fold. The movie runs an uncommonly intense and fast-moving 144 minutes, with the final 100 devoted exclusively to what happened when bad luck, confusion and technological limitations converged.No war movie I have ever seen so vividly shows battle from differing perspectives: combatants on the ground and on rooftops; others hundreds of feet above them under whirling blades; and officers in protected areas watching the debacle on video monitors, trying to figure out what to do. Plunked in the middle of all this are donkeys, cats and even children's swing sets, as if what is happening isn't surreal enough.Black Hawk's knockout photography, editing and sound are all state of the art, while the ensemble performers (Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner), in contrast, are effectively subordinate to the material.",5,An Awesome Package,1029801600,"08 20, 2002",2002,2263,"['focusing', 'distraction', 'mission', 'hand', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'pack', 'Hollywood', 'long', 'history', 'combat', 'movies', 'so', 'ironic', 'screen', 'timing', 'reminding', 'battle', 'turned', 'many', 'American', 'troop', 'commitment.Ridley', 'Scott', 'likely', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'adapted', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'same-name', 'book', 'sheer', 'professionalism', 'America', 'elite', 'Delta', 'Force', 'even', 'unforeseen', 'disaster', 'was', '1993', 'Battle', 'Mogadishu.In', 'relating', 'conflict', '18', 'Americans', 'died', '70-plus', 'were', 'injured', 'standard', 'getting-to-know-you', 'war-film', 'characterizations', 'are', 'downplayed', 'may', 'regard', 'shortcoming', 'fact', 'virtue', 'given', 'nuts-and-bolts', 'movie', 'Gladiator/Hannibal', 'director', 'Scott', 'company', 'have', 'elected', 'make.If', 'ever', 'were', 'story', 'logistics', 'should', 'dominate', 'besides', 'smart', 'casting', 'fills', 'personality', 'gaps', 'clear', 'movie', 'going', 'have', 'human', 'element', 'when', 'see', 'commanding', 'Gen.', 'William', 'F.', 'Garrison', 'played', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'superstar', 'Hollywood', 'golden', 'age', 'screen', 'heroes.The', 'midtown', 'U.N.', 'peacekeeping', 'mission', 'intended', 'capture', 'two', 'lieutenants', 'Somali', 'warlord', 'Mohamed', 'Farrah', 'Aidid', 'was', 'billed', 'maybe', 'hour', 'assignment', 'Following', 'debacles', 'afflicted', 'air', 'ground', 'forces', 'ensuing', 'firefights', 'escalated', 'time', 'frame', '15-fold', 'movie', 'uncommonly', 'intense', 'fast-moving', '144', 'minutes', 'final', '100', 'devoted', 'exclusively', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'bad', 'luck', 'confusion', 'technological', 'limitations', 'converged.No', 'war', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'so', 'vividly', 'battle', 'differing', 'perspectives', 'combatants', 'ground', 'rooftops', 'others', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'whirling', 'blades', 'officers', 'protected', 'areas', 'watching', 'debacle', 'video', 'monitors', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'Plunked', 'middle', 'are', 'donkeys', 'cats', 'even', 'children', 'swing', 'sets', 'what', 'happening', ""n't"", 'surreal', 'enough.Black', 'Hawk', 'knockout', 'photography', 'editing', 'sound', 'are', 'state', 'art', 'ensemble', 'performers', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'contrast', 'are', 'effectively', 'subordinate', 'material']",N/A

Years of warfare among the people created a famine. A powerful warlord ruled the capital of Mogadishu, he seized food shipments to use as a weapon. The US sent 20,000 Marines to restore order and deliver food. In April 1993 Aidid declared war on the UN peacekeepers, then targeted American personnel. The US sent soldiers to Mogadishu to remove Aidid in just three weeks. But six weeks passed without accomplishing this mission. This is the story of that operation.We see food trucks being attacked by desperate people (like some Holiday sales in December 2011). Machine guns fire into the crowd. The US helicopters cannot intervene. A journalist reports on the presence of a person of interest. Outside the city helicopters attack his car to arrest him. he is a businessman who knows General Aidid and sells weapons. He lectures the American general on local politics. ""This isn't Iraq."" A new soldier arrives in camp. We hear a comment about a Delta Force soldier with a ""hot"" weapon. The soldiers talk about their lives. One soldier is suddenly sick.In `Mog' there is a meeting among top leaders. Can they be kidnapped by a helicopter attack? Black Hawk helicopters will provide air cover when they enter this hostile territory. One soldier worries about the troops on the ground. The soldiers prepare for their mission; it is expected to be short. A spy on the ground drives a marked car to direct the helicopters to the right building. Soldiers board their helicopters. A radio warns the Somalians of approaching helicopters; the element of surprise is lost. The convoy of trucks approaches beneath the helicopters. The Somalians prepare barricades in the street.Burning tires provides thick dense smoke to start the operation. Soldiers deploy from their helicopters to start the operation. Others slide down ropes. The Rangers shoot back at the Somali militia. The men captured in the building are extracted. The trucks speed out while exchanging gunfire. A 50-caliber machine gun defends each truck. A rocket-propelled grenade hits a helicopter and brings it down in a town square. ""We just lost the initiative."" Soldiers are sent to view the crash site. The enemy is driven off, but others begin a new attack. Civilians approach the downed Black Hawk. [Notice the difference in sounds between an M-16 and an AK-47?] the trucks run a gauntlet of gunfire in the streets.Soldiers arrive at the crash site to rescue the crew. There are more wounded. Another Black Hawk is shot down. RPG's do the most damage. The soldiers approach the crash site. Can they secure the perimeter? The enemy militia seems to be without limits. The soldiers are ordered to return to base. Can the others hold out? One soldier is captured alive. A rescue attempt attracts more attacks and casualties. A Somali officer explains their aims: ""there can be no peace without victory"". A field operation stops the bleeding from a severed artery. In the dark the militia attack again, and are attacked in return. Can the UN troops arrive to rescue them? Not for one soldier. A helicopter attacks the enemy. The soldiers are rescued by UN armed vehicles, alive or dead. But some have to run under fire to reach the safety of the stadium. The wounded get medical attention. Would the civilians back home understand why they do it?The ending lists the 19 American soldiers killed in this raid. Over a thousand Somalis died too. Two weeks later Delta Force and the Rangers were withdrawn from Somalia. This is based on the book by Mark Bowden. This deserved more awards than it got.

It is action-packed, but it's emotional to me because of how realistic it is.  It is raw with real language, real injuries, and real death.Several people have reviewed the movie content already, and I wanted to review the quality of the blu-ray version.  I've seen this movie several times, with the most recent before tonight being on DVD this past weekend.  I almost didn't buy the blu-ray because of recent reviews here about how the blu-ray isn't much if any better than the DVD.  I disagree.  I am impressed with the video quality of the blu-ray.  I have a Panasonic TC-P50G10 television and DMP-BD60 blu-ray player, and I believe that they do a pretty decent job of upscaling DVDs.  While this movie may not be the best showcase for blu-ray, the blu-ray version is certainly a step up in terms of video detail.  It is unquestionably high definition.  The details on text (names on helmets, subtitles, etc.) makes it easier to read, facial details show off the characters emotions better, and the image quality of the M-16s made some scenes more realistic to me because I've shot similar weapons.One thing that I did notice is that the blu-ray has one less track marker than the DVD - there isn't a new chapter near the beginning when they get the code to start the mission.  I mention this because that is one of my favorite chapter markers.  I find that scene to be pretty exciting with the helicopters taking off.If you enjoy this movie a lot and have a high definition TV, then I'd say that the blu-ray version is at least worth a rental.

Hoot is the quintescential warrior, a Delta Forces sargeant that has seen it all, he convines experience with talent and a strong intellect.  Eversman is a young man thrown before his time to the burdens of command as his team leader suffers a seizure and cannot continue leading his chalk.  The exchanges between these two characters for me are the main part of the movie. Hoot counsels the younger warrior, he demands focus and getting the mission done before letting anguish and guilt take over, his men need him in all his capacity.  Eversman grows as a leader and a man as the combat progresses, at the begining he is willing to endager his team and mission to save a young member of his chalk but at the end he thinks and reacts more in the interest and welfare of the entire platoon.  Hoots's charge through the middle of the city to reach (although late) the crash site of the second Black Hawk and then getting in time to save Eversman's team from a recoiless rifle team at the scene of the main crash site is probably the strongest part of the movie in the action/heroics department.The movie is about a small group of dedicated and highly trained US Special Forces and Rangers took on thousands of fanatical militias (who are also high on drugs and bloodlust) to uphold the creed that no body should be left behind after accomplishing a presumably worthwhile mission that in the end was poorly planned.  It was the cammaraderie, training and ethos of these soldiers that ultimately saved the day.The battle of Mogadishu should be remenber by the sheer technical capacity and heroic selflesness that the US soldier is capable to bring to battle, I think this movie portrays and gives a fitting homage to these brave men.About the movie in itself the battle action puts you literally in the middle of the events, you can appreciate also the flaws on technology and chain of command decisions when the land convoy is shot to pieces while trying to reach the crash site due to lags in the relay of orders.The music was also very enjoyable.

497523,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00000F3KL,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[16, 19]","Black Hawk DownBased on Mark Bowden's 1999 best selling nonfiction book, Black Hawk Down is a gritty, sometimes harrowing account of the bloody firefight between 150 Army Rangers and Delta Force commandos against literally thousands of Somali militia members in the streets of Mogadishu.Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (The Rock, Top Gun) and director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator), working from an adapted screenplay Ken Nolan, vividly recreate the confusion and violence of modern urban warfare in stark, often very graphic detail rivaled perhaps only by Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. It is, after all, a depiction of what was, until the current conflict in Iraq, the most sustained and bloody firefight in U.S. Army history since the Vietnam War.Like Bowden's book of the same name, Black Hawk Down focuses on the events of October 3, 1993, when a combined force of Army Rangers and Delta Force operatives were sent into a hostile section of Mogadishu, Somalia. Their mission, to capture two of warlord Mohammad Farah Aidid's top lieutenants in an attempt to weaken Aidid's grip on the war-torn capital.Whereas the book gives a great deal of information about Somalia's post-1991 civil war, the famine that resulted from the strife between rival clans (of which Aidid's was the most dominant), and the (first) Bush Administration's intervention in the form of Operation Restore Hope, the film does this in graphic shorthand with a series of ""cards"" summarizing what led to the events of October 3, 1993 and with several fictionalized events which serve to introduce some of the main characters which the movie will follow throughout its 144 minutes of running time.Obviously, a movie that is based on the experiences of 150 or so soldiers on one side and thousands of Somalis on the other can't tell the entire story in two hours and 24 minutes. Scott and Nolan were forced to use composite characters (Ewan McGregor's ""Staff Sergeant Grimes"" is one such composite, based in part on Johnny Stebbins, described in Bowden's book as ""the [Ranger] company's chief coffee maker."") and several fictional incidents (a horrible depiction of Aidid's militia stealing food from a Red Cross distribution center and the arrest of a ""Mr. Atto,"" whose cinematic purpose is to explain Aidid's motivations to viewers, most of whom have no idea why we were in Somalia in the first place: ""This is civil war. This is our war,"" says Atto to Major General William Garrison, played by Sam Shepard).The heart of the movie, though, depicts the combined air-ground ""take down"" of Aidid's two lieutenants and the chain of mishaps that led to the loss of two Black Hawk transport helicopters, the capture of pilot Mike Durant (Ron Eldard of ER fame) and the grueling, often gruesome firefight that killed 1,000 Somalis and 18 U.S. soldiers.The scope of the movie precludes any real character development. Unlike Spielberg's fictional but intimate war drama, Black Hawk Down basically lays out its characters in broad strokes: Josh Harnett (Pearl Harbor, 40 Days and 40 Nights) is the idealistic Sgt. Eversmann; McGregor (Moulin Rouge, the Star Wars prequels) is the Ranger who has missed combat throughout most of his service and wants to fight; Orlando Bloom's (The Lord of the Rings) eager newcomer who, as in the real fight, becomes the first casualty (he falls from the UH-60 Black Hawk while fast-roping to the street); these are all staples of men-at-war films, even if they are based on real soldiers.Nevertheless, whether the characters are thinly drawn or not, this film is extremely well done and very respectful of the soldiers who fought, suffered and died during those horrific 18 hours in Mogadishu. Not only does Scott capture the heart of Bowden's excellent book, but - and this is a plus - by getting the assistance and active participation of the actual units involved (those ARE real Army Rangers doing the fast-ropes in the assault sequence, and with the exception of CGI choppers in the two shoot-down scenes, those ARE real Army Black Hawks and Little Birds)the authenticity is therefore assured.Though the movie (and book) never made this clear, there is circumstantial evidence that Aidid (never seen in the movie, not even in archival footage) was supported by Al-Qaeda advisers. If so, Black Hawk Down documents America's first showdown with Osama Bin-Laden and his followers.",4,Black Hawk Down....Brilliant but a Down-er,1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,4386,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'DownBased', 'Mark', 'Bowden', '1999', 'best', 'selling', 'nonfiction', 'book', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'gritty', 'sometimes', 'harrowing', 'account', 'bloody', 'firefight', '150', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'commandos', 'literally', 'thousands', 'Somali', 'militia', 'members', 'streets', 'Mogadishu.Producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'Rock', 'Top', 'Gun', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Alien', 'Gladiator', 'working', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'Ken', 'Nolan', 'vividly', 'recreate', 'confusion', 'violence', 'modern', 'urban', 'warfare', 'stark', 'often', 'very', 'graphic', 'detail', 'rivaled', 'perhaps', 'only', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'depiction', 'what', 'was', 'current', 'conflict', 'Iraq', 'most', 'sustained', 'bloody', 'firefight', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'history', 'Vietnam', 'War.Like', 'Bowden', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'events', 'October', '3', '1993', 'when', 'combined', 'force', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'operatives', 'were', 'sent', 'hostile', 'section', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia', 'mission', 'capture', 'two', 'warlord', 'Mohammad', 'Farah', 'Aidid', 'top', 'lieutenants', 'attempt', 'weaken', 'Aidid', 'grip', 'war-torn', 'capital.Whereas', 'book', 'great', 'deal', 'information', 'Somalia', 'post-1991', 'civil', 'war', 'famine', 'resulted', 'strife', 'rival', 'clans', 'Aidid', 'was', 'most', 'dominant', 'first', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'intervention', 'form', 'Operation', 'Restore', 'Hope', 'film', 'graphic', 'shorthand', 'series', 'cards', 'summarizing', 'what', 'led', 'events', 'October', '3', '1993', 'several', 'fictionalized', 'events', 'serve', 'introduce', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'will', 'follow', '144', 'minutes', 'running', 'time.Obviously', 'movie', 'based', 'experiences', '150', 'so', 'soldiers', 'one', 'side', 'thousands', 'Somalis', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'two', 'hours', '24', 'minutes', 'Scott', 'Nolan', 'were', 'forced', 'use', 'composite', 'characters', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Grimes', 'one', 'such', 'composite', 'based', 'part', 'Johnny', 'Stebbins', 'described', 'Bowden', 'book', '[', 'Ranger', ']', 'company', 'chief', 'coffee', 'maker', 'several', 'fictional', 'incidents', 'horrible', 'depiction', 'Aidid', 'militia', 'stealing', 'food', 'Red', 'Cross', 'distribution', 'center', 'arrest', 'Mr.', 'Atto', 'cinematic', 'purpose', 'explain', 'Aidid', 'motivations', 'viewers', 'most', 'whom', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'were', 'Somalia', 'first', 'place', 'civil', 'war', 'war', 'Atto', 'Major', 'General', 'William', 'Garrison', 'played', 'Sam', 'Shepard', '.The', 'heart', 'movie', 'though', 'combined', 'air-ground', 'take', 'down', 'Aidid', 'two', 'lieutenants', 'chain', 'mishaps', 'led', 'loss', 'two', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'transport', 'helicopters', 'capture', 'pilot', 'Mike', 'Durant', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'ER', 'fame', 'grueling', 'often', 'gruesome', 'firefight', 'killed', '1,000', 'Somalis', '18', 'U.S.', 'soldiers.The', 'scope', 'movie', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'Spielberg', 'fictional', 'intimate', 'war', 'drama', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'basically', 'out', 'characters', 'broad', 'strokes', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', '40', 'Days', '40', 'Nights', 'idealistic', 'Sgt', 'Eversmann', 'McGregor', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Ranger', 'who', 'missed', 'combat', 'most', 'service', 'fight', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'eager', 'newcomer', 'who', 'real', 'fight', 'first', 'casualty', 'UH-60', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'fast-roping', 'street', 'are', 'staples', 'men-at-war', 'films', 'even', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'soldiers.Nevertheless', 'characters', 'are', 'thinly', 'drawn', 'not', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'respectful', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'suffered', 'died', 'horrific', '18', 'hours', 'Mogadishu', 'Not', 'only', 'Scott', 'capture', 'heart', 'Bowden', 'excellent', 'book', 'plus', 'getting', 'assistance', 'active', 'participation', 'actual', 'units', 'involved', 'ARE', 'real', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'doing', 'fast-ropes', 'assault', 'sequence', 'exception', 'CGI', 'choppers', 'two', 'shoot-down', 'scenes', 'ARE', 'real', 'Army', 'Black', 'Hawks', 'Little', 'Birds', 'authenticity', 'therefore', 'movie', 'book', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'Aidid', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'archival', 'footage', 'was', 'supported', 'Al-Qaeda', 'advisers', 'so', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'documents', 'America', 'first', 'showdown', 'Osama', 'Bin-Laden', 'followers']",N/A
497524,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00000F3KL,Alex Udvary,"[1, 5]","I've never seen a war movie that has been more about emotion than ""Black Hawk Down"". When thinking back to some of the great war movies of our time, I think of ""Patton"", a truly great film, but, it doesn't seem to have the heart this one has. ""Platoon"", another top notch war film, one of my all time favorite war movies, but, it doesn't seem to tug at the heart the way this one does. ""Apocalypse Now"", one of Coppola's masterpieces, just doesn't seem to have the same effect on us. One of the main reasons I feel all of this is, is because, ""Black Hawk Down"" lacks in story-line, lets all be honest. But, because 2 hours of this film is nothing but battle scenes, the viewer goes on an emotional roller coster. I'm not saying this film is preachy, it isn't! It doesn't take sides either. It merely trys to state the facts. But, there are moments that appear on screen that are so strong and effective, we (the audience) are just completely drawn in.I saw ""Black Hawk Down"" about two weeks ago, and within all that time there are moments even now, when I still think about the film now and then. I couldn't figure out what I honestly and truly thought of the film. I can see certain faults with the film, but, I can also see the film's strong points as well. First I'll start off with the faults.""Black Hawk Down"" lacks a plot, it's as clear and simple as that. The film is 30 minutes of set-up and two hours of pay-off. Secondly, the film has no character development whatsoever. We know little if anything about these people. Which mind me think. Isn't that the way it is in real life? Many of us don't even know those brave men and women who defend our country. At one point in time, I felt the film had no narrative POV to it. As I thought about I was wrong. It is told from someone's POV, the solider's! Ridley Scott, as tried to make us become part of the experince. I'm not saying the film completely does this, after all it is only a movie and NOTHING can compare to the real thing.Now the strong points. Ridley Scott does an amazing job directing this film. He deserves every bit of attention he's getting for this film. He should get an Oscar nomination for best director. The cinematography by Slavomir Idziak is remarkable as well. And, even though we don't get the know any of the characters in the film, the ensemble is impressive; Sam Shepard, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor & Josh Hartnett, none of them stand out, and I think it was suppose to be that way, because the very message of this film is ""never leave a man behind"" well, as with the cast, they work as a team! And last but not least those battle scenes. Most viwers have stated we feel many emotions while watching this film and we do, because of those battle scenes.In the end ""Black Hawk Down"" is a film that all Americans will enjoy. As you walk out of the theatre a feeling of pround will flow throughout you. You'll be happy to be an American. You may even find a whole new respect for the brave men and women who defend this country. Now, are these things a bad film can do? I think not. The end result for ""Black Hawk Down"" is, it's a powerful, effective war film that entertains and informs it's audience, and ONLY the truly great ones do that! *** 1\2 out of *****",3,"The Hawk May Be Down, But, The Spirit Soars!",1012953600,"02 6, 2002",2002,3248,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'war', 'movie', 'been', 'more', 'emotion', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'When', 'thinking', 'back', 'great', 'war', 'movies', 'time', 'think', 'Patton', 'truly', 'great', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'heart', 'one', 'Platoon', 'top', 'notch', 'war', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'war', 'movies', ""n't"", 'seem', 'tug', 'heart', 'way', 'one', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'one', 'Coppola', 'masterpieces', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'effect', 'One', 'main', 'reasons', 'feel', 'because', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'story-line', 'all', 'be', 'honest', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'nothing', 'battle', 'scenes', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coster', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'preachy', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'take', 'sides', 'either', 'merely', 'trys', 'state', 'facts', 'are', 'moments', 'appear', 'screen', 'are', 'so', 'strong', 'effective', 'audience', 'are', 'just', 'completely', 'drawn', 'in.I', 'saw', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'time', 'are', 'moments', 'even', 'now', 'when', 'still', 'think', 'film', 'now', 'then', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'honestly', 'truly', 'thought', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'certain', 'faults', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'film', 'strong', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'First', ""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'faults', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'plot', 'clear', 'simple', 'film', '30', 'minutes', 'set-up', 'two', 'hours', 'pay-off', 'Secondly', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'whatsoever', 'know', 'little', 'anything', 'people', 'Which', 'think', ""n't"", 'way', 'real', 'life', 'Many', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'defend', 'country', 'one', 'point', 'time', 'felt', 'film', 'had', 'narrative', 'POV', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'told', 'someone', 'POV', 'solider', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'tried', 'make', 'become', 'part', 'experince', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'completely', 'only', 'movie', 'NOTHING', 'can', 'compare', 'real', 'thing.Now', 'strong', 'points', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'amazing', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'bit', 'attention', 'getting', 'film', 'should', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'best', 'director', 'cinematography', 'Slavomir', 'Idziak', 'remarkable', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'film', 'ensemble', 'impressive', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'none', 'stand', 'out', 'think', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'way', 'very', 'message', 'film', 'never', 'leave', 'man', 'well', 'cast', 'work', 'team', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Most', 'viwers', 'have', 'stated', 'feel', 'many', 'emotions', 'watching', 'film', 'do', 'battle', 'scenes.In', 'end', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'film', 'Americans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'walk', 'theatre', 'feeling', 'pround', 'will', 'flow', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'be', 'American', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'whole', 'new', 'respect', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'defend', 'country', 'Now', 'are', 'things', 'bad', 'film', 'can', 'do', 'think', 'not', 'end', 'result', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'powerful', 'effective', 'war', 'film', 'audience', 'ONLY', 'truly', 'great', 'ones', 'do', '***', '1\\2', '*****']",N/A

To think that an operation gone wrong could end up costing so many lives and so much pain is unbelievable...  Futile.  Wasteful.* It's a depressing yet uplifting film.  It's depressing in the sense that we had to fight a battle that didn't concern us to begin with, and it cost us dearly.  Yet it was uplifting to see the camaraderie our military has amongst themselves (regardless of their division, squad, rank, etc.).  I sleep better at night knowing we have such selfless and dedicated people watching over us.* Concerning the film, I think Ridley Scott did a superb job in making this film realistic and serious.

They didn't focus on character detail that much which to me is a good thing. There are just too many people involved to go into detail with them all. Going into too much detail on certain characters and not others would take away what some did and would lessen their sacrifice. So, they stuck to just the story. Good move.They compressed the story some, changed a few names, and merged some characters into one character This was done to get the story down to a movie time frame and to protect certain characters identities as they are still serving.No movie based on a book is as detailed as the book. Don't expect it to be. You should read the book as well.Some critics have said that it is way too violent of a film. Did they know they were going to see a movie about combat? Hello!!?!! It's about time that film makers have started making movies to show the American public what really happens in combat. Combat is not one guy running around killing people by the hundreds with a head band on. They made it a real as you could get it on the screen. Saving Private Ryan started it off and now Black Hawk Down. To Jerry Bruckheimer and Ridley Scott, Bravo! Well Done!It's very accurate as far as weapons, equipment, uniforms, etc. They used the exact helicopters that were used in the original mission in 1993 with the 160th SOAR.The whole movie I was searching for inaccuracies. Want to know what I came up with? They had their names written in marker on their Kevlar helmets (this was done so the audience could quickly tell who's who) we wrote our names on the helmet band. The chin straps on the Kevlar helmets were not taped up (As soon as I got to Ranger Battalion we had to taped up and tie down certain pieces of equipment and this was one of them), they wore dog tag silencers (in Ranger Battalion I was told to get them off and tape em up with 100 MPH tape as soon as I got there), and sometimes they said each others names on the radios instead of call signs (once again this was done for the audience). So as you can see I was really reaching there.Certain shots were just incredible for me. For example, there was a point of view shot from the side of a MH-6 Little Bird (we used to ride out on the sides of those things all the time). The camera was positioned as to be a person sitting on the left side of the chopper looking to the front. In front of the chopper is another Little Bird fully loaded with guys.

A great translation of the book Black Hawk Down, done by Ridley Scott.  This movie shows the sweat, blood, dust, clinging to a group of Rangers as they fight to survive in urban combat.  A regular group of grunts would have suffered much higher casualties on this Special Ops mission.  Early in the film, Ewan McGregor tells a young ranger (Orlando Bloom) reporting in, ""Welcome to the Mog"", short forMogadishu.This is a visual trip into Mogadishu, Somalia.  You are surrounded by the eerie city with its' sights and sounds warning of trouble ahead for American forces.

The courage and creed of the Rangers keeps them alive.  Your heart goes out to a medic who is working to save a rangers' life.  Blocking out the noise of gunfire, he works frantically to prevent shock and blood loss, trying to prevent death.  Different scenes portray the canvas of combat, showing how a prisoner snatch operation turns into chaos, planning goes out the window, and survival looks dim, tied up in politics and uncertainty.The original book is read at West Point and studied by the next group of officers.

497534,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000F3KL,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 6]","But then again, that's what these reviews are all about (and for those of you who keep trying to tell me otherwise, why don't you post a review before badmouthing others).  War films in general don't sit extremely well with me.  They tend to become chaotic, and not in a controlled manor, and they wane on being redundant and unaffecting.  There are certain war films that have transcended that barrier with me.  `Apocalypse Now' for one; which is more a film about the effect war has on the mind.  `Full Metal Jacket' is also outstanding, for it penetrates the infantry remarkably.  `Platoon' was an intriguing character study that remains with me; and in recent years war related cinema like `Tigerland' and `Jarhead' made a real impression on me.But for every detractor lambasting films like `Jarhead' for not containing enough action, I'm criticizing `Black Hawk Down' for allowing the action to clutter the film's central themes.But, this is just my opinion, and I understand thoroughly that I am in the minority.Here is my thing; the story here is a riveting one.  I have not read the book (and apparently, judging from the reviews, if I do read the book then I will dislike this film even more than I already do so maybe I should stay away) but from what is presented to us from Ridley Scott, this story is powerful in its own right.  This `true account' takes place in 1993 when members from the American Rangers and Delta Force were sent into Mogadishu.  Their mission was to capture the lieutenants of warlord Muhammad Farrah Aidid.  Things get severely complicated for the team when two Black Hawk choppers are grounded.The film itself is a mixed bag for me.  To be honest, the first time I saw the film I actually caught the last hour only and was completely engulfed in it.  The way that the film was shot, that sharp (Oscar winning) editing really races the pulse.  Intrigued as I was, I went out and rented the film and watched it from beginning to end.  The first half of the film is so scarce in character development that you feel no connection to the men involved, and the warfare is such a cluttered chaotic mess that I felt confused and disconnected from the whole thing.I actually turned it off.A few months back they aired this on cable television and I committed myself to actually watching it all the way through.  When all was said and done I found myself underwhelmed.  The film just didn't impact me.  It was still messy in structure and underdeveloped in depth.  There are some thrilling sequences, but it also feels very generic in moments.  War films tend to carry that feel for me, for there seem to be less and less inventive ways of telling the same story (hide, shoot, kill) over and over.  I don't mean this as any disrespect to the men in arms or what they do for our country, so please don't take it that way.  This is only with regard to cinema's fascination with depicting warfare on screen.I prefer my films to maintain a strong human core.Like I said; this is a personal thing so if you truly enjoy war films of this nature then by all means, dig in.

I was astounded (upon seeing it in the theatre) at how many of the scenes looked exactly as I had imagined them after reading the book.  The aerial cinematorgraphy is breathtaking, and the scene where they first take off and head into the city--set to ""Voodoo Chile"" by Stevie Ray Vaughan (his version), is just AWESOME.b) Having said that, it plays out like the book.  Non-stop, gut-wrenching carnage.  This is not a relaxing film to watch; you end up getting more and more wound up as it continues because you want it to stop.  But that's the point.c) And the point is: never has a movie portrayed so realistically the horror of modern, urban warfare--this is no ""Desert Storm,"" where we just roll over hapless foes with our technology; this is street-to-street, brutal conflict.  After seeing the movie, you're amazed that we only lost 19.d) Downsides?  The opening scenes (to ""introduce"" us to characters) and the closing (unnecessarily maudlin) smack of Jerry Bruckheimer Top-Gun-itis.  They're silly and Hollywood.  But they're not enough to not recommend this movie (yes I own it).e) Finally, the standout performance is by the Australian (!!) actor playing the Delta Force guy.  Awesome.  He's a southerner in the movie, but if you watch the ""Making of"" section, he sounds like Crocodile Dundee.

Unfortunately the enemy is depicted as -- as a previous reviewer had pointed out -- cardboard cut outs.In an almost documentary style... the movie recalls the 24 hour period in which the US military tries to capture the Somali warlord Aidoo.Naturally, there will be comparisons to previous war movies.  This movie stays clear of the politics and the mythos behind war.There appears to be 2 main purpose of this movie:that 1. War is hell and 2. soldiers fight first primarily to protect and save eachother.In my opinion it is NOT enough for a movie to be simply 'realistic' to illustrate point 1. (War is Hell).  Many movies made today can achieve this (Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Thin Red Line) through on screen gore.Which brings us to point 2. --- this point is explicitly made by a 15 second conversation between two soliders.  I suppose Ridley Scott felt that the average viewer needed to be hit over the head with this message through this dialogue in case the 2 hours of depiction of soliders helping eachother didnt get the message through.The trailers which preceeded this movie shows a scene involving a warlord (an Aidoo confidant) -- in a style reminicent of Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (played by Marlon Brando) -- suggesting a larger role and involvement of this character.

The exacting detail of the execution of the mission and the horrific hour after hour conflict of America's Elite versus a veritable mob of forces with superior firepower does nothing but inspire respect for the men who wear our uniform.  The pace of the movie is frenetic and unlike most hyberbolic reviews, you will be on the edge of your seat the entire movie.Given our politically correct atmosphere, it may be hard for some to watch.  Somali followers of Adid are depicted as they truly were:  grasping killers, who would use food as means to obtain power.  It also makes you realize that as much as we would like, the US military is not there to help Third World nations who do not wish our help.  There are some conflicts, as much as it may hurt our sensibilities, that we must let run their course.If you are a fan of Bill Clinton, this film does not do much to instill confidence in his leadership or international/military decision making.  In fact, it shows why we probably should not have elected a man who 'loathed' the military.

It brings modern combat to us in ways we have never seen, heard and felt before.  It tells its tale pretty honestly and  with fidelity to the facts (within a dramatic presentation).I read the book, and I frankly thought it would be unfilmable, or a botched job at best.  While there were heroics there was no one hero, while there was courage, there were screwups and failures of will and the whole battle was a chaotic mess.Well Ridley Scott & company have managed to convey all that while managing the incredible task of keeping the film comprehensible.  Although the battle is shown in all its fear & confusion-inducing chaos, the viewer can follow the action and not get lost in it.  A major accomplishment.  No fan of Gladiator, I thought Ridley deserved the Oscar for this incredible piece of work.An ensemble piece, befitting the book's view of the combatants as parts of the group, sometimes isolated and fighting alone, but part of a whole team, we note that although personality must be submerged to the group they are still individuals, with often contradictory mixtures of fear & courage.We also see the extraordinary Delta Force guys that we know so little about.  These men and their disdain for the routine military rites, ranks & disciplines are discussed at length in the book, and they are something else!I won't address anyone's complaints about the treatment of the Somalis.  Read the book.  The film, by necessity, does many things in thumbnail sketches...but it does them extremely well.  We see the marketplace at the outset of the film, stalls of hanging clothing beside belts of automatic weapons ammo, and it tells us what a dangerous place Mogadishu was in an instant.That our boys were cocky and arrogant and absolutely uninstructed in who and what they were dealing with before they literally got ""dropped into it"" is made abundantly clear.  It's how they handled themselves and how they fought their way out of it after that this story is about.  And it is told damn well in book & movieP>What the movie is about is what the Delta guy says at the end.  It isn't about the excitement of warfare, it's about the guy next to you.  It's about the sacrifice and courage and bond of men under extreme fear and stress, fighting for their lives against overwhelming odds. And, its a true story.

The failure to roll tanks and armored personnel carriers as their part of the UN ""Peacekeeping force"" left n US troops only with unarmored Humvees and helicopters.  In addition, the US Defense Dept. under Clinton refused to allow fixed wing aircraft to engage in the battle.

Based on true events of the conflict in Somalia, the movie is about a group of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force personel trying to make it out of the city of Mogadishu alive after a planned militarty operation suddenly takes a turn for the worse.Many war movies mix in other plot devices in an attempt to enhance to overall theme and story. In some cases this works extremely well as in Saving Private Ryan. In other cases it ruins a potentially great movie as in Pearl Harbor. In Black Hawk Down, the story focuses on the conflict itself. In fact, the story is so focused on the conflict that there isn't really even a main character.One of the great aspects of Ridley Scott's films is his attention to trivial detail. Many film makers use studio shots and close ups to get around having to go to remote locations and building expensive sets all for the purpose of creating some background eye-candy. This causes the audience to have to stretch their imagination a bit further then they should have to. Ridley Scott however treats the screen as a canvas; not only beatiful to see but intregal to his message. His attention to detail bridges the gap between watching a movie and being immersed in it. These skills were used to great effect in his most famous works such as Alien, Bladerunner, Gladiator, and now Black Hawk Down.When you see Black Hawk Down, you will experience what a war film should be like. What's more you will experience a great film from one of the industry's best. You will witness a realistic portrayal of the savage horror that is war, and you will also see the heroic level that men are capable of rising to.When you leave the theater you will feel like you've been to Mogadishu and know something of what it was like to be with these U.S. soldiers who lived and died in the horrible conflict in Somalia.",4,A war movie that gets it right,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,2172,"['girlfriend', 'said', 'best', 'when', 'credits', 'started', 'roll', 'up', 'stated', 'quot', 'Now', 'what', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', '[', 'movie', ']', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'quot', 'find', 'ironic', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'event', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'ever', 'happened.Ridley', 'Scott', 'amazing', 'movie', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Based', 'true', 'events', 'conflict', 'Somalia', 'movie', 'group', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'personel', 'trying', 'make', 'city', 'Mogadishu', 'alive', 'planned', 'militarty', 'operation', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'worse.Many', 'war', 'movies', 'mix', 'other', 'plot', 'devices', 'attempt', 'enhance', 'overall', 'theme', 'story', 'cases', 'extremely', 'well', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'other', 'cases', 'potentially', 'great', 'movie', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'story', 'conflict', 'fact', 'story', 'so', 'focused', 'conflict', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'main', 'character.One', 'great', 'aspects', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'films', 'attention', 'trivial', 'detail', 'Many', 'film', 'makers', 'use', 'studio', 'shots', 'close', 'ups', 'get', 'around', 'having', 'go', 'remote', 'locations', 'building', 'expensive', 'sets', 'purpose', 'creating', 'background', 'eye-candy', 'audience', 'have', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'bit', 'further', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'however', 'screen', 'canvas', 'not', 'only', 'beatiful', 'see', 'intregal', 'message', 'attention', 'detail', 'bridges', 'gap', 'watching', 'movie', 'being', 'immersed', 'skills', 'were', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'most', 'famous', 'works', 'such', 'Alien', 'Bladerunner', 'Gladiator', 'now', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down.When', 'see', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'will', 'experience', 'what', 'war', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'What', 'more', 'will', 'experience', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'industry', 'best', 'will', 'witness', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'savage', 'horror', 'war', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'heroic', 'level', 'men', 'are', 'capable', 'rising', 'to.When', 'leave', 'theater', 'will', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Mogadishu', 'know', 'something', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'who', 'lived', 'died', 'horrible', 'conflict', 'Somalia']",N/A

It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.For whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After ""stirring up the hornet's nest"", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, ""Leave No Man Behind"".Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence.Black Hawk Down is without peer. It tells the story of 24 hours in the life of US soldiers in a clear, focused, and honorable manner. What other true-events film has come close? Apollo 13 dramatized and created people and events for a terrific film. Glory and Schindler's List did the same, successfully and honorably taking liberties with actual occurences for the sake of movie-dom.

Now, with my new DVD in hand, I am pleased to be able to see this film whenever I like.  This is, most simply put, the most grittily realistic and overpoweringly authentic and accurate depiction of modern combat imaginable. This is the closest we ordinary citizens can come to the actual experience, as we are sucked involuntarily into the terrifying vortex of the world of modern combat. We careen into combat with the young volunteers, our hearts pounding, the sweat pouring off us as we go, feeling our blood pressure rise as we rappel breathlessly down with them to the hard dusty ground!  Of course, with Ridley Scott involved, one comes to expect such amazingly spellbinding theatrics, yet this movie threads quickly along the well-greased storyline provided in the best selling book, adding the sharp, quicksilver dimensions of reality only such a stunningly visual depiction can offer in addition. And, from the anxious hand tremors of a young trooper about to descend into the madness of a flurry of hostile gunfire to the knowing worried glances a special forces combatant exchanges with one of his men, this is a superbly acted, casted, and choreographed set of battle scenes. And the scenes go relentlessly on and on.Precious little time is wasted here providing the outlines of what turns out to be a mission from Hell; policy makers in Washington (read Secretary Albright here, trying to show she could out-testosterone the guys) decide this bunch of cravenly aggressive mercenary tribes can be corralled and democratized, that Somalia can become an instant shining example of our new-found powers of nation-making, and the American peace-keeping forces are suddenly tasked with missions for which they are ill-equipped. Without sufficient armor or enough reaction troop strength, the command orders a kidnap mission to eliminate one of the warlords who is most actively opposing the new ""pie-in-the=sky"" political objectives, and a small force of young troopers are dispatched in several helicopters to make a quick-strike raid into the heart of Mogadishu. Just as they have reached the point of accomplishing their mission, a helicopter is shot down, and all at once, hell breaks loose.Yet this is truly just the beginning. The story of how these men stood their ground, how exceedingly well they fought, and how savagely they staved off the vastly superior numbers of local opponents who were well armed and supplied is only now becoming the stuff of legend. The real question one is left with after seeing the movie (or after reading the wonderful book, as well) is how such a valiant and well-executed action could have ever been described by both our government and the press as a defeat. It is more a lesson in the extraordinary and shameful timidity of everyone in the chain of command, from Madeline Albright to Colin Powell to the Secretary of Defense on down, who refused the Battle Scene Commander the resources he requested, that literally doomed the mission once things began to go awry.Therefore, while we did unfortunately lose eighteen men, we also inflicted hundreds of casualties on the opposing forces, and finally were able to successfully evacuate the balance of the American forces after having engaged the street fighters for an incredibly extended period of time. This engagement and the kind of men who fought in it should be sung of in battle hymns, not decried as evidence of American softness or lack of a will to fight. As always, the fault in the action lies not in the ferocious young men who fought and died so courageously and so well, but in the despicable and all too-human failures of their leaders and their government to use them wisely, to take greater care in placing them so carelessly in harm's way.  Simply put, this is a great film, easily one of the best war films ever produced, and one I can heartily recommend!

497561,A3MPEDYM4DGS5O,B00000F3KL,BigSPEEGS,"[17, 19]","I was skeptical going into ""Black Hawk Down"". After all, just look at the credits. Ridley Scott is the director, and he hasn't had a good film for ages (no, not even ""Gladiator"".) Jerry Bruckheimer has bad enough judgment to produce cash cows like ""Pearl Harbor"" (and that's a train wreck big enough to destroy anyone's career.) The cast, while featuring some good actors, is not exactly stellar. I was convinced I wouldn't see the film after seeing the trailer (the dialogue struck me as incredibly poor). But somehow I found myself seeing it, and boy was I surprised when I discovered the most riveting, unsettling war film since ""Saving Private Ryan"".The time is October 3, 1993; the place is Somalia. 120 American soldiers were on a mission to capture lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a portrait of how what was supposed to be a half-hour mission turned into a grueling, 18 hour ordeal that led hundreds of Somalis and 18 Americans to their deaths. ""Black Hawk Down"" is amazing in how it puts you right in a soldiers shoes. It doesn't speechify or go heavy on irony. The event is depicted through actions, not words, and the result is stunning. We see each little decision that was made, each step that went wrong, and how it all lead to tragedy. Watching ""Black Hawk Down"", I felt like I was actually a soldier in combat, and it was terrifying.It is important to remember that this film isn't about the politics and the reasoning behind the mission, but about the experience. There is no trying to justify the reasons why things happened like they did. At times, it seems the screenplay (written by Ken Nolan and Steven Zaillian) wants to go that route, but Ridley Scott won't let it. We don't get to know the characters, but the idea of the film is that you are one of them. ""Black Hawk Down"" differs from films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" in that it isn't so much about the soldiers lives and their legacies, but more the terror of being shoved into circumstances beyond your control.Scott has regained his title of one of the most visually brilliant directors around, after losing it with films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Hannibal"". Anyone can make a film gory, few people are clear-headed enough to make it realistic. ""Enemy at the Gates"", for example, gives us a good look at Russian soldiers being mowed down by German machine guns, but the film is such a blur that it's impossible to care for them. In ""Black Hawk Down"", a sense of urgency is constantly pushing the film forward. Every time Scott cuts to a wide-angle shot to show the incoming enemy, it will get the entire audience tense. But as soon as he brings you back down into the action, the tenseness turns into horror. At times it feels almost impossible to watch, but it is just as hard to turn away.There is the issue of the treatment of the Somalis in ""Black Hawk Down"". It's a sticky subject. I won't pretend that most of the Somalis aren't being treated as the enemy. But I will say that the film is not overly unfair. This is a film about battle, told from one side's point of view. If this were a story about the Somalis, then the Americans would be just as much the ""bad guys"". But this is battle, plain and simple, and no matter which way one looks at it, its barbaric. What would be unfair is if the film assumed it knew the other side's every thought and tried to simplify their story. This was done to the Japanese in ""Pearl Harbor"" with disastrous results.""Black Hawk Down"" is a visceral film that shook me down to the core. It doesn't try to tell the political and moral complications behind all the chaos, which are far too vast and incomprehensible for any film to grasp. Film is a visual medium, and so Ridley Scott keeps the speechifying to a minimum and with his camera puts us in the middle of one of the biggest travesties since the Vietnam War.",4,Woah.,1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,3865,"['was', 'skeptical', 'going', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'just', 'look', 'credits', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'director', ""n't"", 'had', 'good', 'film', 'ages', 'not', 'even', 'Gladiator', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'bad', 'enough', 'judgment', 'produce', 'cash', 'cows', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'train', 'wreck', 'big', 'enough', 'destroy', 'anyone', 'career', 'cast', 'featuring', 'good', 'actors', 'not', 'exactly', 'stellar', 'was', 'convinced', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'dialogue', 'struck', 'incredibly', 'poor', 'somehow', 'found', 'seeing', 'boy', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'discovered', 'most', 'riveting', 'unsettling', 'war', 'film', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', '.The', 'time', 'October', '3', '1993', 'place', 'Somalia', '120', 'American', 'soldiers', 'were', 'mission', 'capture', 'lieutenants', 'warlord', 'Mohamed', 'Farrah', 'Aidid', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'portrait', 'how', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'half-hour', 'mission', 'turned', 'grueling', '18', 'hour', 'ordeal', 'led', 'hundreds', 'Somalis', '18', 'Americans', 'deaths', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'amazing', 'how', 'right', 'soldiers', 'shoes', ""n't"", 'speechify', 'go', 'heavy', 'irony', 'event', 'depicted', 'actions', 'not', 'words', 'result', 'stunning', 'see', 'little', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'step', 'went', 'wrong', 'how', 'lead', 'tragedy', 'Watching', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'felt', 'was', 'actually', 'soldier', 'combat', 'was', 'terrifying.It', 'important', 'remember', 'film', ""n't"", 'politics', 'reasoning', 'mission', 'experience', 'trying', 'justify', 'reasons', 'why', 'things', 'happened', 'did', 'times', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Ken', 'Nolan', 'Steven', 'Zaillian', 'go', 'route', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'idea', 'film', 'are', 'one', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'differs', 'films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'soldiers', 'lives', 'legacies', 'more', 'terror', 'being', 'shoved', 'circumstances', 'control.Scott', 'regained', 'title', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'brilliant', 'directors', 'losing', 'films', 'Gladiator', 'Hannibal', 'Anyone', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'gory', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'clear-headed', 'enough', 'make', 'realistic', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'example', 'good', 'look', 'Russian', 'soldiers', 'being', 'mowed', 'down', 'German', 'machine', 'guns', 'film', 'blur', 'impossible', 'care', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'sense', 'urgency', 'constantly', 'pushing', 'film', 'forward', 'Every', 'time', 'Scott', 'cuts', 'wide-angle', 'shot', 'show', 'incoming', 'enemy', 'will', 'get', 'entire', 'audience', 'tense', 'as', 'soon', 'back', 'down', 'action', 'tenseness', 'horror', 'times', 'almost', 'impossible', 'watch', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'turn', 'away.There', 'issue', 'treatment', 'Somalis', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'sticky', 'subject', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'most', 'Somalis', 'are', ""n't"", 'being', 'treated', 'enemy', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'overly', 'unfair', 'film', 'battle', 'told', 'one', 'side', 'point', 'view', 'were', 'story', 'Somalis', 'then', 'Americans', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'bad', 'guys', 'battle', 'plain', 'simple', 'matter', 'way', 'one', 'barbaric', 'What', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', 'film', 'assumed', 'knew', 'other', 'side', 'thought', 'tried', 'simplify', 'story', 'was', 'done', 'Japanese', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'disastrous', 'results', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'visceral', 'film', 'shook', 'down', 'core', ""n't"", 'try', 'tell', 'political', 'moral', 'complications', 'chaos', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'vast', 'incomprehensible', 'film', 'grasp', 'Film', 'visual', 'medium', 'so', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'speechifying', 'minimum', 'camera', 'middle', 'one', 'biggest', 'travesties', 'Vietnam', 'War']",N/A

Aided by poetic cinematography and excellent editing by Pietro Scalia, Scott ably tells the tale of one terrible October day in 1992 when American troops under the United Nations enter Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and attempt a probe into the city to capture the country's corrupt leader. The result is a bloodbath that begins when one a Black Hawk (an American helicopter model) is shot down and a rescue of the possible surviving passengers becomes the primary mission of the day. The result is the best war movie of the year, and the very best made since Terence Malick's The Thin Red Line, with a giant ensemble cast that features standout performances by Josh Hartnett (who, interestingly enough, also appeared in the worst war movie of the decade, Pearl Harbour) and William Fichtner",4,Nobody gets left behind--just like Lilo and Stitch!,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,1187,"['unapologetically', 'violent', 'war', 'movie', 'something', 'almost', 'impossible', 'genre', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'latest', 'work', 'genius', 'one', 'totally', 'up', 'year', 'absymal', 'Hannibal', 'unflinching', 'brutal', 'battleground', 'where', 'anything', 'feels', 'completely', 'realistic', 'sure', 'not', 'leave', 'fans', 'frequent', 'glimpses', 'Scott', 'elegant', 'directorial', 'flourishes', 'Aided', 'poetic', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'editing', 'Pietro', 'Scalia', 'Scott', 'ably', 'tale', 'one', 'terrible', 'October', 'day', '1992', 'when', 'American', 'troops', 'United', 'Nations', 'enter', 'Mogadishu', 'capital', 'Somalia', 'attempt', 'probe', 'city', 'capture', 'country', 'corrupt', 'leader', 'result', 'bloodbath', 'when', 'one', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'American', 'helicopter', 'model', 'shot', 'down', 'rescue', 'possible', 'surviving', 'passengers', 'primary', 'mission', 'day', 'result', 'best', 'war', 'movie', 'year', 'very', 'best', 'made', 'Terence', 'Malick', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'giant', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'standout', 'performances', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'who', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'also', 'appeared', 'worst', 'war', 'movie', 'decade', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'William', 'Fichtner']",N/A

497564,A2POYXTGSPSW7O,B00000F3KL,Bill Hensler,"[4, 5]","5 Stars.Now, how important is this movie in a historical sense?  I consider Blackhawk Down to be as good as:1.  Glory2.  Band of Brothers (a mini-series but more like a movie)3.  All Quiet on the Western Front4.  Tora, Tora, Tora5.  Apocalypse NowYes, Blackhawk Down belongs on this list.  It's not perfectly historically accurate, what movie is?  You only have 120 - 180 minutes and a movie director does not have the time to trace every step in a book.What makes Blackhawk Down a perfect movie is it shows the new American military perfectly.  In a way Blackhawk Down is like an old Indian War movie.  Basically, the Americans sort of lose.  Conversely, the way the Somali lose should break a viewer's heart.The movie has a gritty feel, perfect.  The only thing you will not get is smoke drifting through your living room.  You will not smell the urine running down the street in the open sewers.  Other than that Blackhawk down is perfect in its third world feel.  Indeed, some of the advisors on the set of the movie said it was a perfect reenactment of ""the 'mog'"".Basically this movie's facts are well known.  An American Ranger and Special forces unit trys to get a Somali warloard.  The operation turns into a disaster.  If you don't know more than that then watch the movie.  If you read the book then it's pretty much on tract.I liked everything about the movie.  I liked how the Army Rangers looked perfect.  The hair cuts were perfect.  The uniforms were perfect.  Ridley Scott even had the patches put on the uniforms correctly.  All of the actors look like they came out of a year of being at Fort Benning.  I challenge anybody who has seen a war movie to ever point out more realistic looking soldiers.  Want to know another little fact?  Even the chow line is correct.  The movie felt less like a movie than you're watching events, like an invisible ghost.  You are a ghost watching a combat operation.  That's how this movie feels.I would go as far as having this movie as required viewing for high school and college government classes.  Why?  The men (!) shown on this movie try to fight for what is right.  The Bush/Clinton administration mission was just to make sure that the poor average Somali could have water and food.  Is that wrong to feed your fellow man?  The bottom line is the Somali's were using famine as a weapon and our government wanted to stop it.This movie is a historical watermark.  It shows American military forces in limited engagements.  That's a nice way of saying a few guys are sent in to get a dirty job done.  The trouble with that basic thesis is they can get killed on the job.Apocalypse Now, for all its problems, did kind of correctly show the typical American what Vietnam was like.  All Quiet on the Western Front shows the horrors of World War One's trench fighting.  Tora, Tora, Tora gives a gripping story of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Glory shows an African-American unit in the Civil War.  Last, Band-of-Brothers shows a great para-trooper unit fighting Nazi-German.  All of those movies are more than five stars.  They are the greats.Blackhawk Down is a great movie.  Fifty years from now historians will be using this movie as an example of the limited wars America fought in the early 21st century.5 Stars (deserves 10 )Yes, I own a copy and am proud of it.

After seeing this movie, and a documentary on the subject, my respect for the men of the special forces has quadrupled.  The ability, training and raw courage of these soldiers was awe inspiring.  The fact that only 18 men were killed is a tribute to the skill of these soldiers.As far at the particulars of the movie goes, it was very well directed and acted.  The casting was great.  Incredibly violent.  Believe it or not, it was actually toned down from what really happened.  Josh Hartnett was actually good in this movie.  He should stick with serious movies and get away from those teenie-bobber movies.  The sets and scenerey were perfect and really set the mood.This is a serious movie folks.  There's no political message nor is there a sappy love story to pass the time.  If you know the story behind the movie it will actually make you angry.  The main reason this tragedy occured was Bill Clinton and his crony, Les Aspen.  The special forces were not allowed to have proper suppport (Bradley fighting vehicles and C140 Gunships) for the simple reason of not looking ""too provocative"" in a foreign country.  If you have any doubts about that, just ask the parents of some of the dead soldiers.  One of the fathers refused to shake hands with Mr. Clinton, at a ceremony honoring his dead son.  Another father refused to accept a hand writen letter of condolence from Mr. Clinton.  He sent it back with a letter of his own.",5,This is a must see!!!!

It is certainly exciting and action-packed, but also depressing, as other reviewers have pointed out. Anyone who thinks twice about the manner in which the incidents unfold can only shake his/her head. The mission was successful, but accomplished nothing. A botched, half-baked plan resulted in 16 hours of killing and confusion, after which 18 brave but naive young American soldiers were dead, along with 1000 Somalis. In ""The Fog of War"" Robert McNamara said one of the lessons he had learned was to ""know your enemy"". When will America learn this lesson?  One of the things I learned as an officer in the Army (the British Army, of course) is that time spent on reconnaissance is never, never wasted. If the American Army really tackles its missions in the way they are presented on film, then I am extremely unimpressed. We are constantly being shown a group of young men being chucked gung-ho into situations for which they are very poorly prepared, with the senior command simply relying on guts and superior fire-power.

The Rangers and Delta Force operators were sent in without the proper backing - no armor and insufficient air support - in what turned into one gigantic goat molestation. It shows what happens what happens when mission parameters are controlled by a collection of REMFs who do not have the character to lead from the front. Our magnificent young men died trying to make a difference in a country controlled by thugs and brigands, but they were sent into harm's way by a president who was a photo-op leader at best and a complete sell-out to politics and expediency.The second story is about the triumph of soldiers fighting for their buddies and esprit-de corp.

They were criminal thugs who were trying to protect their turf, their control of the food distribution and their criminal enterprise. They were trying to protect their homeland in the same way that drug-dealing, merchant-extorting, murderous street gangs in LA are protecting their homeland.

A lot of people say that we (U.S.) gets involved in issues that aren't any of our business, but I differ in this regard.  If we (Americans) sat silent while a country is obliterated so violently then we would not be the America that our soul foundation is based upon.I view this movie from two fronts (1) its a movie about the U.S involvement in Mogadishu and (2) the tale of the heroic soldiers of Delta Force and the Rangers.  These men go into the most dangerous conflicts in the world without question, they defend our (U.S.) interets and do it with honor.This movie delivers in both regards, it justifies our involvement at a high level and then depicts the heroisim of Delta and the Rangers in ""arguably"" the most intense fire fight since the vietnam war.&lt;spoiler coming up, don't read if you don't want to>This movie provides a very emotional roller coaster.

We see: USA soldiers are well trained and armed professionals.But the Somali chief, in smoking his Havana cigar, predicts that was to follow: he smokes with delectation as those who know they don't attain to live largely and he speaks right: in Somalia they have yet killed about 300000 of his own people, and health or life have almost any worth in Mogadiscio. Killing and terror is simply his consuetudinary way of living his short life, and being light weapons cheaper in international black markets than food or medicines, the Delta Force and Rangers have to confront with an enemy formed by a chaotic crowd poor or nothing trained but which knows well the ground, fully armed, and over all, desperate and possessed by a dement aggressiveness. Sure there are the helicopters Blackhawks and the Hummers, but after all these are only a few light American vehicles and a few American men. The battle begins and a patrolling action theoretically of only some minutes of duration ends into a furious battle of many hours with several hundred Somalis and nineteen Americans killed. This movie aims almost exclusively in the objective action and owing to the realism in showing the efficacy of weapons of today, even the lighter, the film I think acquires a quality of coldness and despersonalization  that can or cannot taste to each viewer, but I think that is something deliberately chosen, and surely more near to the feelings of the real fighters than seen in older war films as war isn't a garden party.

497582,A2YXMN40D7WTGP,B00000F3KL,casualsuede,"[10, 13]","This movie begins with a bit of a history lesson. Somalia's warlords have been warring among each other and have torn the country apart. There is mass starvation but the powerless UN are losing all the food shipments to the warlords, effectively prolonging this conflict. Two lieutenants of warlord Aidid, who controls a large portion of Mogudishu (the capital of Somalia) had been spotted and the US, having been forced on the sidelines by the United Nations, decides to get into the game by nabbing them with the use of Army Rangers, Delta Force, Air Calvary and the Army Humvee convoy. Their goal was simple on paper. The Delta Force (an anti-terrorist squad) would sweep in and storm the hotel Aidid's men were in, The Army Rangers would secure the perimeter, the Air Calvary would provide air cover and the convoy would crash in, take the captured prisioners and haul butt back to the safe zone. The mission was kept hush-hush from the UN and the whole operation was destined to take 30 minutes from start to finish.Of course it went horribly wrong. The US underestimated Aidid's intelligence web and within minutes of their landing, Aidid's militia force had amassed nearly 5,000 soldiers and they descended on the Americans, catching them off guard. A black hawk helicoptor goes down, then another. Following the army motto..""leave no man behind"" the 100 or so ground troops struggled to keep the perimeter secure for the humvee convoy, while setting up another perimeter for the downed blackhawks, whose pilots may or may not be alive. This leads to street to street fighting that lasts over 15 hours as the US Army struggles to send in reinforcement as well as seeking the help of the UN, who are infuriated that they were not informed of the operation.The main point of this movie is to show the plot as explained above to the tee. The director is not interested in most of the characters, which is reasonable since the movie is set in Macro terms. If Ridley Scott had to deal with every minute detail, we would of had a 10 hour movie. This movie does have a few characters that are memorable, including main character Master Sargent Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) who is more of an idealist than a blind soldier, John Grimes (Ewan McGregor) the Desk Clerks who makes good coffee, types fast and yearns to be on the battlefield. There is Specialist Shawn Nelson (Ewan Bremner), the Ranger who gets his hearing shot out and provides comic relief and pilot Mike Durant (Tom Eldard) who gropes for the picture of his daughter as hundreds of Somalis surround his blackhawk and begin beating him to death.My two favorite characters were Colonal Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), playing a no-nonsense convoy commander, who pushes his men and has no time for things like bad directions or bullet wounds to the neck. He is the most ""hollywood"" of characters and if his toughness which is portrayed on screen has any truth to it, John Wayne would have been proud. The other is Master Sargent Paul Howe (William Fichter) who thinks his leader has poor judgement is willing to risk his life for the larger cause.I do have to admit that there was a little confusion in all the uniforms, dirt and blood, but it was not that hard to follow. The main pluses of the story is way that nothing is hidden and nothing ""Hollywood"" added to make it more than what is was, which is bizarre coming from Ridley Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. It is a straightfoward story that takes the viewer into a hellish rollercoaster ride with a group of mostly 19~21 year old kids in a part of the world which we would not dare step foot in as tourists, let along risk our life for. With this movie, I do have much more respect for the men and women who serve in our armed forces, they have tasks that regular non-military folk like me could never comprehend.

I was truly amazed by this compelling story of recent military history. It's a horror story all on it's own.Now, if you have seen the movie, you'll know that people in Somalia, or Africa, were being starved by warlords controlling them. Seeing the people suffer is horrible! In 1993, the U.S. military, including Delta Force and the Army Rangers, were sent in to help with the situation and restore order to the crumbled society. Quite a compelling story at first glance, especially when it is actually true! Seeing the blood and violence is not for the light-hearted or very young children. Mature enough teens can see this.The movie is incredible. I've been waiting a long time for a movie to be pure action from start to finish. This one is. The characters are also good in the movie, and it's easy to feel a real sense of compassion for the victims of the tragedy. Master of action, Ridley Scott, directs the film, while Hans Zimmer provides a powerful score. Acting veterans are scattered everywhere in the film, such as Josh Hartnett and Orlando Bloom. The visuals are too hard to describe-you have to see it to believe it! The whole time I felt as if I was really watching the event take place! From start to finish, all action.

That being said, the movie, without comparison to the book, is a solid, if not spectacular, piece of filmmaking.  The hostile anarchy of Bakara Market is masterfully recreated by Ridley Scott.  The cast, from watching the special feature segment on the DVD, actually went through real Ranger and Delta training.  That makes for a surprisingly realistic and well-made war movie - not some Hollywood glitzy anti-war ....The cast, as stated in interviews, felt it their duty to accurately represent the members of Task Force Ranger and Delta Force as well as to honor those who so valiantly gave their lives in Mogadishu.  Black Hawk Down tells the story of normal people put in conditions that are anything but normal.

The book actually brought me to tears, with the recounting of the battle. It was a terrible tragedy.I heard that a movie version was going into production, and I eagerly anticipated it, the trailers for the film sent tingles up my spine, if the film version could move me 1/4 as much as the book did, I would not be disappointed.I saw it opening weekend, and believe me, I was not disappointed in the least bit. I almost cried in the theatre too, but that kind of stuff becomes more difficult for me in front of audiences. Go figure.I'll admit, it started off sort of lame, with many shots of the Army Rangers camradrie. I feel that Scott could have done a better job of introducing the characters here, but to do so would have added about an hour to the movies length, as there is a huge, and superb, cast of characters in this movie. I feel that the term ""characters"" isnt really appropriate, as the actors in ths movie portray real people, unlike many ""war"" movies who typically portray the generic anonymous GI.After the first portion of the movie, which basically informs the audience of the happenings in Somalia, the Army Rangers and the Delta Force (shh, they don't exist, remember?) go about completing their mission. All hell breaks loose. The action is frightingly realistic appearing. I'm sure film could never portray the true horror of a battle field, but Black Hawk Down is hands down the closest attempt at doing so yet.Every man in this movie is a hero, as were the real soldiers. I highly suggest you go to see it, unless you have a weak stomach. If you didn't enjoy Normandy landing in ""Saving Private Ryan"", stay away.

Ridley Scott's gloss on a sorry chapter in American military history may have had the good luck to cash in on America's new found patriotism, but it does so with a pointless jingoistic story, far too many characters to keep track of, no real message at all and an awfully racist sensibility that truly disgusted me.As has been said on this site before, 18 americans died. While certainly I don't want to minimize the sufferings of the real men and there families here, it is important to remember that many more Somalis were killed: 10,000 in the entire war, and roughtly 1,000 in the conflict described. While it's debatable that the 10,000 Somalis died as a direct result of US intervention, the smaller number definately did. This greater proportion of Somali suffering is all but ignored in the movie. Somalis are portrayed mostly as bloodthirsty and savage. And they are contrasted to the noble, self-sacrificing and ALL-WHITE American soldiers. (I find it hard to believe that, in today's army, there could possibly be an all-white division. In fact, I know for a fact that there wasn't in this war.) The scene where the mob of Somalis, including women and children savagly beat the disabled Americans to death was more than I could take and I walked out.Leaving politics aside, this is also poor moviemaking. The documentary style of the movie has been hailed as the most realistic portrayal of war on film. That may be, but this is exactly what makes this a poor film artistically. The bouncing of the camera makes watching this on a large screen painful. The plotting and dialogue (what little there is) is poorly drawn and the characters are at best two dimensional. I doubt that anyone who has only seen the film once can remember most of the names of the characters or differentiate one from another. As a result, the movie is pretty empty of any real emotional content.If you like war movies, there are many more that, while perhaps not as realistic, tell their stories much better than this tripe. Rent Bridge Over the River Kwai again, perhaps one of the most intelligent and thoughtful war movies of all time. Or Saving Private Ryan, Glory, Catch 22, MASH, or Full Metal Jacket. All of these movies in varying degrees capture more of the full contradictions of war and all have a defined point of moral point of view. You may not agree with that point of view, but at least they attack the subject intelligently.

I must declare right up front that I am a military veteran. What I see in these movies relates to an oft told description of bravery: It is ordinary people acting in extraordinary ways while under extreme stress, usually involving the overwhelming odds that they will lose their life.The movie sound and fury are absolutely marvelous. I have a widescreen (53"") tv and the sound is hooked up to my stereo system driving two very healthy speaker systems. When the heavy .50 caliber machine guns start firing it's almost like being back on the firing range again. The heavies kind of Thud when they fire and the sound track picks that and all the other sounds up superbly. The visuals are just great too. I spent twelve years overseas, alot of it in the third world. This is what it looks like.Some scenes in the movie were pure ""Hollywood,"" such as having to throw an infrared marker up on the roof to mark the bad guys. What a joke - anything on the roof was a bad guy! Oh well, you gotta allow Hollywood a few here and there. Otherwise there were so many 'good' scenes I could fill up another page or two. One of my favorites was the door gunner raining hot brass down on the Ranger from his electric gun. My wife didn't get it when the Ranger started hopping around trying to dig out the ones that went down his shirt. But I'll bet just about every Veteran did. Been there, done that - on the firing range with automatic weapons &lt;G>.I greatly enjoyed the portrayals by such a wide group of 'main actors' of the usual chaos of war and how men in combat deal with it. I developed an immediate love for Tom Sizemore's colonel. I would readily follow the man he portrayed into any place he cared to lead. His crack about ""... well let's get it over then."" Makes me chuckle every time the scene plays. I feel that the heart and soul of the American miltary man is displayed many times in the movie, but not any better than the scene of the two Deltas that dropped into the crash site to try and protect any of the crew that survived. That's based on the true story as told by the pilot who survived. I give this movie full marks for portraying the American miltary men as the brave and honorable people I knew while I served, and in years since.For those who stated that the movie should have developed why we were there, what was the state of the world politics, etc., etc. I can only surmise that they were either asleep that year or only old enough to watch Big Bird on Sesame Street. I can't imagine any literate American adult that doesn't remember at least the general facts of the debacle in Somalia brought to you by the Clintonistas and their female Quasimodo - Madeleine Half-bright.Oorah !",5,Best darn docu-drama !,1044316800,"02 4, 2003",2003,2806,"['wife', 'watch', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'again', 'month', 'so', 'right', 'Gladiator', 'U-571', 'must', 'declare', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'am', 'military', 'veteran', 'What', 'see', 'movies', 'oft', 'told', 'description', 'bravery', 'ordinary', 'people', 'acting', 'extraordinary', 'ways', 'extreme', 'stress', 'usually', 'involving', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'will', 'lose', 'life.The', 'movie', 'sound', 'fury', 'are', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'have', 'widescreen', '53', 'tv', 'sound', 'hooked', 'stereo', 'system', 'driving', 'two', 'very', 'healthy', 'speaker', 'systems', 'When', 'heavy', '.50', 'caliber', 'machine', 'guns', 'start', 'firing', 'almost', 'being', 'back', 'firing', 'range', 'again', 'heavies', 'kind', 'Thud', 'when', 'fire', 'sound', 'track', 'other', 'up', 'superbly', 'visuals', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'too', 'spent', 'twelve', 'years', 'overseas', 'alot', 'third', 'world', 'what', 'like.Some', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'such', 'having', 'throw', 'infrared', 'marker', 'up', 'roof', 'mark', 'bad', 'guys', 'What', 'joke', 'anything', 'roof', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'Oh', 'well', 'got', 'ta', 'allow', 'Hollywood', 'few', 'here', 'there', 'were', 'so', 'many', ""'good"", 'scenes', 'could', 'fill', 'up', 'page', 'two', 'One', 'favorites', 'was', 'door', 'gunner', 'raining', 'hot', 'brass', 'down', 'Ranger', 'electric', 'gun', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'Ranger', 'started', 'hopping', 'around', 'trying', 'dig', 'out', 'ones', 'went', 'shirt', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'just', 'Veteran', 'did', 'Been', 'there', 'done', 'firing', 'range', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'lt', 'G', '>', '.I', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'portrayals', 'wide', 'group', ""'main"", 'actors', 'usual', 'chaos', 'war', 'how', 'men', 'combat', 'deal', 'developed', 'immediate', 'love', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'colonel', 'would', 'readily', 'follow', 'man', 'portrayed', 'place', 'cared', 'lead', 'crack', 'well', 'let', 'get', 'over', 'then', 'Makes', 'chuckle', 'time', 'scene', 'feel', 'heart', 'soul', 'American', 'miltary', 'man', 'displayed', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'not', 'better', 'scene', 'two', 'Deltas', 'dropped', 'crash', 'site', 'try', 'protect', 'crew', 'survived', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'pilot', 'who', 'survived', 'give', 'movie', 'full', 'marks', 'portraying', 'American', 'miltary', 'men', 'brave', 'honorable', 'people', 'knew', 'served', 'years', 'since.For', 'who', 'stated', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'developed', 'why', 'were', 'there', 'what', 'was', 'state', 'world', 'politics', 'etc.', 'etc', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'were', 'either', 'asleep', 'year', 'only', 'old', 'enough', 'watch', 'Big', 'Bird', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'literate', 'American', 'adult', ""n't"", 'remember', 'least', 'general', 'facts', 'debacle', 'Somalia', 'brought', 'Clintonistas', 'female', 'Quasimodo', 'Madeleine', 'Half-bright.Oorah']",N/A
497597,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00000F3KL,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 4]","Sometimes I have this view that war movies are a ticket to an easy Oscar. While it's not a bad thing to make such a movie, there's almost a feeling that if you want to be taken seriously, do a war movie or a biopic or an epic. Michael Bay, known for cinematic fluff like Bad Boys and Armageddon puts out Pearl Harbor, graphically great but emotionally (and everything else) empty. I can't, however, accuse Ridley Scott of doing that since he's always one to make it real as possible, just too bad this film isn't a war classic.It was meant to be a simple mission, roughly 30-45 minutes in the streets of Mogadishu in Africa. A simple capture mission of a leader's associates and leave. But when 2 black hawk down helicopters are shot down with increasing resistance from all over the city, US soldiers have to fight their way out of the city and try to survive.The film won Oscars for Editing and Sound and although it's not as immersive and perfect as other war films, it does give you a realistic experience of going through a mission, especially one as high stakes as this one. It's confusing at times though since it's hard to tell who's who and the names on the helmets aren't much help since they move around too much. They are being shot at, yes, but maybe closer camera angles would differentiate who's who from a big list of crew cut soldiers. Gary Rydstrom's work was better on Saving Private Ryan but it's good here as well.Like that Spielberg film, this one is unflinching at the horrors of war. People are continously shot throughout the film, along with bodies being blown in half, fingers getting half blown off(or all the way, hard to tell) and soldiers digging into a wounded leg, the film is gritty as war can get. However what made the Spielberg film worked as that before a soldier was killed, we got details about the character and room for exploring which made it harder to see someone shot down. Here it's just ""soldier #1"" sometimes, or, in my case, it's naming the actual actor's name like ""there goes Eric Bana, there's Orlando Bloom"". Speaking of the last one, I'm glad he's not in the film much, never liked him as an actor much so it's perfect.This is a MASSIVE set with a documentary longing than the actual film and more details into the actual mission. Oddly enough, I understood the mission a lot better through the extras since geographically I didn't know where I was in the film. Some double dips are irritating but here it's excusable since this goes beyond simple making-ofs. Instead of solely including fluffly EPK's(those are the ""that director rules, this film's great, he's awesome to work with features), they give you lots of background information which helps better understand everything. If only Saving Private Ryan had a big documentary like this.It's not up there with that Spielberg classic or Coppola's Apocalypse Now but at least it's a great war film period like Full Metal Jacket or Platoon.",4,Unflinching and realistic but not perfect,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,2945,"['Sometimes', 'have', 'view', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'ticket', 'easy', 'Oscar', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'make', 'such', 'movie', 'almost', 'feeling', 'want', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'do', 'war', 'movie', 'biopic', 'epic', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'known', 'cinematic', 'fluff', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Armageddon', 'out', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'graphically', 'great', 'emotionally', 'everything', 'else', 'empty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'however', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'doing', 'always', 'one', 'make', 'real', 'possible', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'film', ""n't"", 'war', 'classic.It', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'simple', 'mission', 'roughly', '30-45', 'minutes', 'streets', 'Mogadishu', 'Africa', 'A', 'simple', 'capture', 'mission', 'leader', 'associates', 'leave', 'when', '2', 'black', 'hawk', 'helicopters', 'are', 'shot', 'down', 'increasing', 'resistance', 'city', 'US', 'soldiers', 'have', 'fight', 'way', 'city', 'try', 'survive.The', 'film', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Editing', 'Sound', 'not', 'immersive', 'perfect', 'other', 'war', 'films', 'give', 'realistic', 'experience', 'going', 'mission', 'especially', 'one', 'high', 'stakes', 'one', 'confusing', 'times', 'hard', 'tell', 'who', 'who', 'names', 'helmets', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'help', 'move', 'around', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'being', 'shot', 'yes', 'maybe', 'closer', 'camera', 'angles', 'would', 'differentiate', 'who', 'who', 'big', 'list', 'crew', 'cut', 'soldiers', 'Gary', 'Rydstrom', 'work', 'was', 'better', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'good', 'here', 'well.Like', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'one', 'unflinching', 'horrors', 'war', 'People', 'are', 'continously', 'shot', 'film', 'bodies', 'being', 'blown', 'half', 'fingers', 'getting', 'half', 'blown', 'off', 'way', 'hard', 'tell', 'soldiers', 'digging', 'wounded', 'leg', 'film', 'gritty', 'war', 'can', 'get', 'However', 'what', 'made', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'worked', 'soldier', 'was', 'killed', 'got', 'details', 'character', 'room', 'exploring', 'made', 'harder', 'see', 'someone', 'shot', 'down', 'Here', 'just', 'soldier', '1', 'sometimes', 'case', 'naming', 'actual', 'actor', 'name', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Speaking', 'last', 'one', ""'m"", 'glad', 'not', 'film', 'much', 'never', 'liked', 'actor', 'much', 'perfect.This', 'MASSIVE', 'set', 'documentary', 'longing', 'actual', 'film', 'more', 'details', 'actual', 'mission', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'understood', 'mission', 'lot', 'better', 'extras', 'geographically', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'was', 'film', 'double', 'dips', 'are', 'irritating', 'here', 'excusable', 'simple', 'making-ofs', 'Instead', 'solely', 'including', 'fluffly', 'EPK', 'are', 'director', 'rules', 'film', 'great', 'awesome', 'work', 'features', 'give', 'lots', 'background', 'information', 'better', 'understand', 'everything', 'only', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'had', 'big', 'documentary', 'this.It', 'not', 'there', 'Spielberg', 'classic', 'Coppola', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'least', 'great', 'war', 'film', 'period', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Platoon']",N/A

The future dystopian world of 'Blade Runner'; the ancient Roman world in 'Gladiator'; middle America in 'Thelma and Louise'; the terror of deep space in 'Alien' - the list continues as this director ranks as one of the best in the business. Scott did not disappoint with ~Black Hawk Down~ because the realism of this film was at times extremely painful to watch. There were moments in the viewing where I actually felt part of the action - an intense fear in the guts and dizziness that a soldier could well experience before plunging into battle. There is no wonder that this film won an academy award for best editing because the action flowed seamlessly to the point of saturation then, suddenly, when you think you've had enough, it pours on a little more just to make sure you get the point. The editing is a work of art. I came away from the film emotionally and physically drained as if I had fought along side these courage's men.There was an oddity in this film that is difficult to overlook: Somalia's lack of food (this was the reason U.N. forces were there in the first place) but an obvious over abundance of weapons. The country's population are starving, food is a scarcity, but automatic weapons and rocket launchers abound. There is a specific image in the film of a little Somalian boy, thin as a rake, obviously starving, walking down the road with rockets strapped to his back and a machine gun in his hands. I can't get this strange image out of my mind...~Black Hawk Down~ is a soldier's story, fighting to keep themselves and their comrades alive - a well-used and popular theme in war films. This is also the romantic aspect of war we continue to dwell upon to somehow justify or at least divert our attention away from the fact that war is simply mass murder. This film communicated to me that we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that courage may be a virtue but war is essentially death and destruction.This important film, despite its focus on the soldier's courage, which is a highly commendable virtue, still sends the message convincingly that war is about suffering and death, and does so in a highly realistic fashion.This is superb filmmaking.",5,Realism at its diabolical best...,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,2278,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'master', 'capturing', 'essence', 'particular', 'story', 'time', 'place', 'atmosphere', 'future', 'dystopian', 'world', ""'Blade"", 'Runner', 'ancient', 'Roman', 'world', ""'Gladiator"", 'middle', 'America', ""'Thelma"", 'Louise', 'terror', 'deep', 'space', ""'Alien"", 'list', 'director', 'one', 'best', 'business', 'Scott', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', '~Black', 'Hawk', 'Down~', 'realism', 'film', 'was', 'times', 'extremely', 'painful', 'watch', 'were', 'moments', 'viewing', 'where', 'actually', 'felt', 'part', 'action', 'intense', 'fear', 'guts', 'dizziness', 'soldier', 'could', 'well', 'experience', 'plunging', 'battle', 'wonder', 'film', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'best', 'editing', 'action', 'flowed', 'seamlessly', 'point', 'saturation', 'then', 'suddenly', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'point', 'editing', 'work', 'art', 'came', 'away', 'film', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'drained', 'had', 'fought', 'side', 'courage', 'men.There', 'was', 'oddity', 'film', 'difficult', 'overlook', 'Somalia', 'lack', 'food', 'was', 'reason', 'U.N.', 'forces', 'were', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'obvious', 'abundance', 'weapons', 'country', 'population', 'are', 'starving', 'food', 'scarcity', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'rocket', 'launchers', 'abound', 'specific', 'image', 'film', 'little', 'Somalian', 'boy', 'thin', 'rake', 'obviously', 'starving', 'walking', 'down', 'road', 'rockets', 'strapped', 'back', 'machine', 'gun', 'hands', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'strange', 'image', 'mind', '~Black', 'Hawk', 'Down~', 'soldier', 'story', 'fighting', 'keep', 'comrades', 'alive', 'well-used', 'popular', 'theme', 'war', 'films', 'also', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'war', 'continue', 'dwell', 'somehow', 'justify', 'least', 'divert', 'attention', 'away', 'fact', 'war', 'simply', 'mass', 'murder', 'film', 'communicated', 'should', ""n't"", 'lose', 'sight', 'fact', 'courage', 'may', 'be', 'virtue', 'war', 'essentially', 'death', 'destruction.This', 'important', 'film', 'focus', 'soldier', 'courage', 'highly', 'commendable', 'virtue', 'still', 'message', 'convincingly', 'war', 'suffering', 'death', 'so', 'highly', 'realistic', 'fashion.This', 'superb', 'filmmaking']",N/A

To a layman, it is very realistic, portraying the chaos, fear, and courage of U.S. troops under fire in a situation wherein they do not control the initiative.  Black Hawk Down tells the story of one incident in the U.N.-sponsered intervention in Somalia in the early 1990's.  At that time, U.S. Rangers and Delta Force, along with regulars from a Pakistani mountain division, were attempting to keep the peace in war-torn Mogadishu.  To that end, the U.S. special forces attempted to arrest members of one warlord's inner circle with a daylight raid into the heart of Mogadishu.  Insertion by helicopter, along with a Hummer column in support, was the method of choice.  When two of the Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by rockets, the U.S. forces lost control of the situation, with too few assets in the hostile zone to control the perimeter of both crash sites and the prisoner extraction.  A firefight lasting the rest of the day and all the following night.This film is very well organised.  It deservedly won an Oscar for Pietro Scalia's editting.  Ridley Scott shares much of the credit, as well, as he sets up the characters we accompany into battle, then clearly arranges the action such that we can follow exactly what is going on.  While the many of the soldiers are indistinguishable in the midst of the firefights, the setup is arranged such that we know which groups are involved (i.e. crash site 1, crash site 2, or the extraction team).  Authenticity is added by the use of actual U.S. Army chopper pilots and equipment, as well as actual Rangers trained in the insertion techniques (sliding down ropes from an airborn Black Hawk) used in the real battle.  The film is relentless in its action - it is so authentic and sustained that the viewer is actually exhausted at the end (much like the Normandy landings in Saving Private Ryan).  Unfortunately, I feel these sequences go on a bit long, such that the viewer becomes numbed to the action.  Finally, the soundtrack by the able Hans Zimmer, interspersed with pop music, is quite good, and captures the moods accurately.Unfortunately, this DVD edition is very dissappointing.  There is only one extra - that of an extended trailer featurette.  This one is just as annoying as usual, basically hyping the movie while giving little inside information.  The only parts of interest are the short sections dealing with the actors in boot camp (those playing Rangers and Deltas attended a week of training at their respective real-life training facilities).  The theatrical trailer isn't even included!

497602,ALNRJZMNHMJD7,B00000F3KL,Curt Remmel,"[1, 1]","Every review of this movie that has given it any less than an 8 has been filled with one of two things--a) exaggerating the sometimes poor quality, or b) talking about how great this could have been if it had instead given more thought to the politics involved. To both I must say a grain of salt and a pattern of objectivism is needed to appreciate just how good this movie is. I saw it expecting a decent action film, because Ridley is a great action director, but came out feeling utterly overwhelmed because this movie is the epitome of recounting a battle in its horrifying, realistic sense.  The dialogue is somewhat poor. At the end of the film in Hartnett (I think it was him)'s last monologue, especially, people have complained of the lame simplicity and gung-ho-ishness. But, I must say, having read the book for English (and everyone shoud both see this and read the book, for historical/appreciatory purposes involving the soldiers who make such valiant sacrifices) that the dialogue, while admittedly simplistic in intent and uncomfortably gung-ho; is true to the dialogue and feelings expressed by the soldiers who Bowden interviewed. Therefore, cut the bias, and recognize the realism present throughout the movie, even in dialogue.  On the matter of the lack of political motivation the most obvious argument, of course, is that there is no time in the movie, and that is a good reason. Even better, and far more obvious, is that this movie is not at all about those events, as made clear in the sweet dialogue in which a Delta forcer tells Hartnett he'll be able to think about that plenty when he gets back from the battle. Even still, some symbolic stuff has been woven, things that did not happen in the battle, that works in the movie to express some of these motivations fairly well. Also, even further, the book did not occupy itself with these motivations much, either, and fittingly so. For, this movie is about the battle, and does a damn good job of presenting it, but that is so obvious I need not talk of it.  On the biggest qualm people have had with this movie--lack of character development--I, too, felt a certain amount of lack in this. While I have yet to see Saving Private Ryan, I understand how getting to know the characters even further in this film might have served to its advantage. To that problem, the answer lies in a couple of sources. On the matter of editing, this film does a great job, I think, of focusing on the battle at just a long enought time for the events in it (this is after reading the book, mind you, so mock me if you want for that bias). They are especially hard to express because of the totally chaotic nature of the battle, but the movie did as well as the book (which was perfect) within its own timeframe. Which comes to the answer, which is, that having more character development would either a) make the movie too long or b) have to take away some of the events from the battle. A few of the important parts of the battle are not included in the movie, even, so removing any more would take away from the battle even farther. Also, the other thing, is that by not including as much the soldiers become more of a unit helping eachother, sometimes as individuals, creating even further the feeling of responsibility to this unit. IMHO.  Now that I am done rambling about people having biases, all I have left is to say that this movie is perfectly directed and cinemated (not a word) and acted for what it is--a recounting of modern warfare. It is as intense and realistic as movies can go for that objective. The biggest problem is in the sometimes weak dialogue, and it is not only easily forgiven, but somewhat fitting for the people who speak the words.

497603,A72S4SWJWIBCV,B00000F3KL,Cutre,"[0, 2]","You know the story. On october 3rd, 1993, a group of Delta Force and Ranger soldiers got trapped behind enemy lines in the hostile territory of Mogadishu, Somalia, while they were trying to bring down a cruel warlord. With angry somalies shooting at these soldiers from every direction, they only could protect themselves by shooting back and running through the sandy streets. The rescue, that was suppoused to take less than 30 minutes, actually took over 15 hours, leaving several dead american soldiers and hundreds of slaughtered somalies.True, you may not get a lot of character development, but I don't think that was the point of the movie. I've always thought you got to watch a movie in its own context and if you see this one as in interesting experiment of almost a documentary it's quite terrific. Cinematography couldn't be better and I think Hans Zimmer's score is quite simply marvelous: it really makes you feel tense and in certain moments, certain vocalizations by Lisa Gerrard are quite macabre, just like the movie. It is not a gross movie, it's just creepy, scary, macabre in its own way, because you definately can feel what's going on. And you get to see how things get even more complicated as the hours go by and the team begins to dissolve.Ewan McGregor does a funny job as the desk-boy Johnny Grimes, and I'd have liked to see more of him, preparing coffee and running around screaming. Josh Hartnett is practically himself (don't get me wrong, I like him, but he always acts the same way). Sam Shepard has a very interesting role and probably the best developed one, as the leader of the whole situation. Tom Sizemore is great, as one soldier leading the wounded out of the hostile territory, but you can actually see he's terrified, the way he sweats, the way he's cursing all the time but that look in his eyes that says he just wants to get out as soon as possible. Eric Bana, Jason Isaacs and William Fichtner are the brave soldiers, they are not scared of anything and they just keep fighting and trying to protect their men. Orlando Bloom, Richard Tyson, Jeremy Piven, Ron Eldard, Kim Coates and Ewen Bremner also star in this non-stop battle, beautifully directed by Ridley Scott, in a way that you can actually forget about the world and you are allowed to get into the movie.I give it 4 stars and not 5 because of the lack of screentime for Ewan McGregor and especially, the lack of special features. It only features a behind-the-scenes and two trailers from Spider-Man and The One, but no trailer for this movie. Kinda silly, ain't it? Fortunately, somewhere in early 2003 Clumbia TriStar is going to release a 2-disc set for this one, hopefully including the chilling trailer featuring the Dave Matthews Band song, The Space Between.If you're really interested in this movie, I'd recommend waiting for the special edition, hoo-ah?",4,The space between... hoo-ah?,1028332800,"08 3, 2002",2002,2871,"['know', 'story', 'october', '3rd', '1993', 'group', 'Delta', 'Force', 'Ranger', 'soldiers', 'got', 'trapped', 'enemy', 'lines', 'hostile', 'territory', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia', 'were', 'trying', 'bring', 'down', 'cruel', 'warlord', 'angry', 'somalies', 'shooting', 'soldiers', 'direction', 'only', 'could', 'protect', 'shooting', 'back', 'running', 'sandy', 'streets', 'rescue', 'was', 'suppoused', 'take', 'less', '30', 'minutes', 'actually', 'took', '15', 'hours', 'leaving', 'several', 'dead', 'american', 'soldiers', 'hundreds', 'slaughtered', 'somalies.True', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'point', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'got', 'watch', 'movie', 'own', 'context', 'see', 'one', 'interesting', 'experiment', 'almost', 'documentary', 'quite', 'terrific', 'Cinematography', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'think', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'quite', 'simply', 'marvelous', 'really', 'feel', 'tense', 'certain', 'moments', 'certain', 'vocalizations', 'Lisa', 'Gerrard', 'are', 'quite', 'macabre', 'just', 'movie', 'not', 'gross', 'movie', 'just', 'creepy', 'scary', 'macabre', 'own', 'way', 'definately', 'can', 'feel', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'hours', 'go', 'team', 'dissolve.Ewan', 'McGregor', 'funny', 'job', 'desk-boy', 'Johnny', 'Grimes', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'preparing', 'coffee', 'running', 'around', 'screaming', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'practically', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'always', 'same', 'way', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'very', 'interesting', 'role', 'probably', 'best', 'developed', 'one', 'leader', 'whole', 'situation', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'great', 'one', 'soldier', 'leading', 'wounded', 'hostile', 'territory', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'terrified', 'way', 'way', 'cursing', 'time', 'look', 'eyes', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'are', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'are', 'not', 'scared', 'anything', 'just', 'keep', 'fighting', 'trying', 'protect', 'men', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Richard', 'Tyson', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Kim', 'Coates', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'also', 'non-stop', 'battle', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'way', 'can', 'actually', 'forget', 'world', 'are', 'allowed', 'get', 'movie.I', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'not', '5', 'lack', 'screentime', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'especially', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'behind-the-scenes', 'two', 'trailers', 'Spider-Man', 'One', 'trailer', 'movie', 'Kinda', 'silly', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Fortunately', 'somewhere', 'early', '2003', 'Clumbia', 'TriStar', 'going', 'release', '2-disc', 'set', 'one', 'hopefully', 'including', 'chilling', 'trailer', 'featuring', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'Band', 'song', 'Space', 'Between.If', ""'re"", 'really', 'interested', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'waiting', 'special', 'edition', 'hoo-ah']",N/A

Recounting the 1993 daylight raid by US forces into a section of Mogadishu, Somalia controlled by agents of guerilla strong man Muhammad Aidid, and the eighteen-hour nightmare many of the American peacekeepers endured when that mission went horribly wrong, Black Hawk Down is a violent, frequently sad, realistically-depicted re-creation of events from that fateful time. In my experience Black Hawk Down is also the sort of film that needs more than one viewing, not only because the density and scope of the on-screen action can overwhelm almost anyone, but also because it is easy to lose track of who is who among the identically-dressed, similarly-featured young (shockingly young, to be honest) men who are caught up in the firefights that compose so much of the movie, and both the story and the actual human beings about whom it is concerned deserve to be recognized and distinguished as to what role they played in the battles, and what the ultimate outcome was for each of them.

The acting is second to none, all the actors do a great job (I go from what I see, not what I know of the actual situation).  All these features come together to make a truly awesome representation of what happened that dark day in Somalia.  This movie shows why Soldiers everywhere deserve respect.  These guys are out there in foreign lands protecting people they don't know, helping people they never met, trying to do what's right.What the movie lacks is information.  It doesn't tell us why US troops are in that area, it doesn't tell us what are causing the problems in that area.  It shows us lots scenes of starving people and lots of natives killing each other but it doesn't tell us why.  It's a typical Hollywood action/drama in that respect, American's like to see there troops on the big screen winning battles, it doesn't seem to matter what reasons for the battle are.The actual soldiers portrayed in the movie are done so with respect and accuracy.  People expect soldiers to be infallible, that they are programmed to fight and when conflict erupts around them it doesn't effect how they do there job.  This isn't the case with war, the explosions, the bullets ricocheting close to your head, this effects everyone, and how much is down to professionalism.

It is my sincere hope that this movie will serve to remind my generation that the military is not a means to a political end, but real people that serve their country out of respect and honor for it, and that they should be allowed to do their jobs as best they can.  The fact that our troops were pulled from Somalia after this embarrasment instead of being allowed to stay and remove Aidid (who's own people welcomed our troops and the aid they brought to the people of Somalia, and then turned against us after United Nations meddling caused havoc in the region) only promotes the agenda of tinhorn dictators around the world.

497621,A2LUJINJYU5G9E,B00000F3KL,Dextra L. Suggs,"[7, 9]","Having served, I appreciated the reality with which Black Hawk Down was presented. For example, the Ranger falling to his death because he missed the repelling rope as the helicopter maneuvers to avoid enemy fire demonstrates an unavoidable mishap. For me this movie reveals some of the subtle and rarely talked about realities soldiers face. It also showcases some of the overlooked political realities.  For instance, conflict is conflict; but real combat is a major advantage for real life guerilla fighters. Yes, our soldiers are well trained, but nothing prepares a soldier for combat like combat. Our soldiers do not have the opportunity to fight as much as militia fighters from other countries, yet we are always fighting battles in our enemy's backyard. This creates a disadvantage for our soldiers and usually hurts our militaries reputation. And we ALWAYS underestimate the tenacity of third world guerilla fighters until, of course, they kill one of our soldiers. This arrogant American mentality puts our soldiers at a distinct disadvantage. In one of the scenes the Ranger commander disagrees with the Delta Forces  Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC) and subsequently reprimands him by telling him, ""you are combat ineffective soldier!,"" for disobeying his directive in front of his subordinates. This may have been the most realistic depiction in the entire movie. Anyone who's been in the Army knows that Delta Force soldiers are on an elite level rarely seen in any military setting and if you want to live you should put your ego aside and listen to them. It's not that I recommend or condone disobeying orders, because I don't. But if it means saving our guys lives, I think egos should be set aside during stressful situations. The narcissistic infighting of arrogant leadership may be the military's most lethal killer....of American troops! And don't get me started on the misplaced arrogance of 90% of the E-9's in the Army. Ironically, one of the most pronounced differences between the experienced and not so experienced combat soldier, is the level of compassion with which they approach life. Those soldiers that have experienced combat shy away from bravado, while those that haven't seen war seek the glory of the stereotypical brave man. This overlooked aspect of military life is rarely exposed. The U.S. will always be called upon to help other nations with their political mishaps. And don't discount the difficulties NATO Forces have communicating with each other. But at some point we're going to have to learn to be painfully selective.  Don't we owe it to the parents of the young men and women who are, were and will be killed or maimed, to produce tangible results from these skeptical overseas missions? It's condescending to downplay the patriotism of the families of our nation's fallen soldiers by casually selecting insignificant international political targets. Black Hawk Down not only successfully salutes the soldiers involved in the Somalia experience with its authenticity, it succeeds in showing the audience the always ugly and chaotic circumstances our soldiers face while in the exercise of heated international conflict.",4,Keeping it real,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,3183,"['Having', 'served', 'appreciated', 'reality', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'was', 'presented', 'example', 'Ranger', 'falling', 'death', 'missed', 'repelling', 'rope', 'helicopter', 'maneuvers', 'avoid', 'enemy', 'fire', 'unavoidable', 'mishap', 'movie', 'subtle', 'rarely', 'talked', 'realities', 'soldiers', 'face', 'also', 'overlooked', 'political', 'realities', 'instance', 'conflict', 'conflict', 'real', 'combat', 'major', 'advantage', 'real', 'life', 'guerilla', 'fighters', 'Yes', 'soldiers', 'are', 'well', 'trained', 'nothing', 'soldier', 'combat', 'combat', 'soldiers', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'opportunity', 'fight', 'as', 'much', 'militia', 'fighters', 'other', 'countries', 'yet', 'are', 'always', 'fighting', 'battles', 'enemy', 'backyard', 'disadvantage', 'soldiers', 'usually', 'militaries', 'reputation', 'ALWAYS', 'underestimate', 'tenacity', 'third', 'world', 'guerilla', 'fighters', 'course', 'kill', 'one', 'soldiers', 'arrogant', 'American', 'mentality', 'soldiers', 'distinct', 'disadvantage', 'one', 'scenes', 'Ranger', 'commander', 'Delta', 'Forces', 'Non-Commissioned', 'Officer', 'Charge', 'NCOIC', 'subsequently', 'telling', 'are', 'combat', 'ineffective', 'soldier', 'disobeying', 'directive', 'front', 'subordinates', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'entire', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'Army', 'Delta', 'Force', 'soldiers', 'are', 'elite', 'level', 'rarely', 'seen', 'military', 'setting', 'want', 'live', 'should', 'put', 'ego', 'aside', 'listen', 'not', 'recommend', 'condone', 'disobeying', 'orders', 'do', ""n't"", 'saving', 'guys', 'think', 'egos', 'should', 'be', 'set', 'aside', 'stressful', 'situations', 'narcissistic', 'infighting', 'arrogant', 'leadership', 'may', 'be', 'military', 'most', 'lethal', 'killer', '.of', 'American', 'troops', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', 'misplaced', 'arrogance', '90', '%', 'E-9', 'Army', 'Ironically', 'one', 'most', 'pronounced', 'differences', 'experienced', 'not', 'so', 'experienced', 'combat', 'soldier', 'level', 'compassion', 'approach', 'life', 'soldiers', 'have', 'experienced', 'combat', 'shy', 'away', 'bravado', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'war', 'seek', 'glory', 'stereotypical', 'brave', 'man', 'overlooked', 'aspect', 'military', 'life', 'rarely', 'exposed', 'U.S.', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'called', 'help', 'other', 'nations', 'political', 'mishaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'discount', 'difficulties', 'NATO', 'Forces', 'have', 'communicating', 'other', 'point', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'learn', 'be', 'painfully', 'selective', 'Do', ""n't"", 'owe', 'parents', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'were', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'maimed', 'produce', 'tangible', 'results', 'skeptical', 'overseas', 'missions', 'condescending', 'downplay', 'patriotism', 'families', 'nation', 'fallen', 'soldiers', 'casually', 'selecting', 'insignificant', 'international', 'political', 'targets', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'not', 'only', 'successfully', 'soldiers', 'involved', 'Somalia', 'experience', 'authenticity', 'showing', 'audience', 'always', 'ugly', 'chaotic', 'circumstances', 'soldiers', 'face', 'exercise', 'heated', 'international', 'conflict']",N/A

The movie takes place where the soldiers are assigned onto a mission to capture or killed the two generals of a vicious warlord who was ordering militiamen to seize food supplies that were meant to feed the starving and the U.N. and American forces intervened in a vain attempt to overthrow the militiamen and help the poor. The whole intervention plans were poorly planned out though and it would ultimately make the invasion of Somalia a doomed failure to begin with and what was supposed to last up to an hour at the most would become a bloody battle that lasted for over a day in the `hostile territory' of Mogadishu. This ill-fated military intervention in Mogadishu was a hard and cold lesson for America and the Western governments that military superiority and the most advanced gizmos don't always bring victory and America suffered its biggest military loss since The Vietnam War in 1973. This movie perfectly documents the extremely horrific situations that the soldiers had to endure and the extremely hostile atmosphere that they faced off against. The melee went downhill into failure especially when two helicopters crashed after taking enemy fire and the soldiers who were on them were now stranded in the streets of Mogadishu in an area that was patrolled by enemy militiamen and they eventually attacked by the thousands and ultimate 18 American soldiers died in the fiasco. The failure of October 1993 seems to have been forgotten by a vast majority of the American public. This movie, like almost any other war movie, is not for the squeamish. I don't recommend this movie to the squeamish nor the light-stomached either because of some extremely graphic bloody scenes but those who can handle such heavy content, this is one of the best war movies that I've seen. The only flaw to this movie is that not enough time is given to introducing us to the soldiers and lieutenants who took part in the battle.

Having read the book before seeing the movie, overall I am pleased with the results.The movie does a solid job of telling the tragic and heroic story of what happened to US soldiers in Somalia during this infamous raid.  The filming is very well done, and I think the director really captures the look and feel of the chaos that unfolded that day.  Be warned, some of the scenes are pretty graphic, and there is a lot of blood since the fighting was non-stop and both sides relentless during this battle.  If the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan make you squirm, this film may also make you a bit uncomfortable.The story itself is tragic, for both sides.  Casualties are heavy for the Somalies, and American lost some of its finest soldiers.  The movie does a pretty balanced job of showing how no one really won this battle.But, on the other hand, the story is also inspirational, in that it shows what a group of well trained, close knit, US soldiers can accompish, despite the enormous odds they face.  This battle could have turned into a modern day Little Big Horn, if it were not for the actions of these fine soldiers, NCOs, and officers during this crisis.  When all is said and done, I am thankful that the US has soldiers who are willing to pay the ultimate price for freedom.One warning that I will pass along is that the movie may be hard to follow if you have not read the book, or are unfamiliar with US military operations.  Also, no real character develop takes place, the events of the day are the main focus of the film.

497627,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00000F3KL,D. Litton,"[17, 24]","From its heartwrenching beginning to its heartbreaking end, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a thing of sheer beauty, a wondrous spectacle of the physical brutalities of combat and, by extension, the emotional stress and trauma that each individual in battle must confront when placed in the most hostile of situations. Based on the actual events that took place in Somalia at a time of unrest and fighting, the movie so brilliantly captures history in equal parts style and substance, all the while tugging at the heartstrings with overwhelming emotion and an authentic sense of American patriotism long absent from much of today's modern war films.Somalia, 1993. The country is a desolate wasteland, ravished by widespread famine as a result of power-hungry leader Muhammad Farrah Aidid, who uses poverty as his weapon. Determined to put an end to Aidid's reign of terror, American forces devise a plan to capture his key conspirators in a mission they conclude will take little more than an hour. Everything goes off without a hitch, but as the American troops search for a way out of Mogadishu, the threat of the enemy begins to grow, and soon, they are surrounded by gunfire, bombs, grenades, and bloodshed that carry on into the next morning, 16 hours after their mission was under way.The movie is the latest in a resurfacing genre of war epics and thrillers, which began with Steven Speilberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and has continued through to the new millennium's brand of flat blockbusters like the melodramatic ""Enemy at the Gates"" and the jingoistic ""Behind Enemy Lines."" It's a bit of a surprise that a movie such as this should come from the makers of last year's two most disappointing films, ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Hannibal."" At the hands of producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Ridley Scott, ""Black Hawk Down"" could have easily been just another war film; thankfully, it's much more than that.This teaming of pyromaniac Bruckheimer and the visionary Scott results in an impeccable depiction of combat and a war-torn Mogadishu. The wind-blown terrain of Somalia is filmed in dull hues, with a gradual descent into darkness that elevates the tension. Sequences of battle are filmed in a manner that places us right in the middle of the action, revealing the gritty, unflinching reality of war only a soldier knows.Never once does this stylistic approach overstep its boundaries: whereas a movie like ""Pearl Harbor"" blatantly showcases its special effects while shying away from the brutal reality of battle, this film doesn't concern itself with a PG-13 rating by keeping mum about the harsh conditions of death and bloodshed in times of hostility. Instead, it settles for an uncompromisingly blunt approach that not only keeps the action at a fever pitch, but also conveys the brutality of such a situation.The movie also chooses to portray its characters not as mere pawns in a game of chess, but as humans who feel love, humor, and above all else, fear. In their fear they press on, returning to the base after hours of ongoing battle only to willingly return to save those trapped within the city limits, evoking a grand feeling of patriotism that, for the first time in a long time, feels real. The all-star cast, perhaps the best ensemble cast of the year, conveys this combination of emotional stress and sense of duty with solid performances.There are images in ""Black Hawk Down"" that will haunt me for years to come, those of mangled bodies, innocent civilians caught in the middle of crossfire, people that we come to care about instantly losing their lives. But what elevates it from a mere physical exercise is its human approach to its characters, instilling them with emotions that quickly become our own as we begin to comprehend the trauma such an event as this unleashes.

497629,A3U20DIY3TCSNI,B00000F3KL,drew m,"[4, 10]","Since Saving Private Ryan's opening D-Day scene hammered audiences five years ago, Hollywood has taken that movie's brutality a couple steps further with war films and miniseries (""Band of Brothers"") that are, essentially, 2 hour battle sequences.  Certainly, it's important to show modern audiences just how horrific war can be.  But to do it to such numbing effect ends up having the reverse effect upon viewers.  We become desensitized to even the most shocking violence, and films that are meant to be anti-war are morphed into intensely graphic action films.Nothing illustrates this point better than Black Hawk Down.  While Ridley Scott's film is masterful in its technical details, and its ability to illustrate the tactics of modern warfare and how they can fall apart, it fails to establish any real sense of character or story.  We concentrate on a cast of maybe 20 or 30 soldiers as they participate in the disastrous 1993 raid in Somalia.  But because there are so many characters, and because their introductions are so brief and indistinct, it's impossible to involve yourself in the personal stakes of the raid itself.Of course, we knew nothing about the characters in Ryan before they went into battle, but we learned about them during the battle and had the added context of just what was at stake (namely, the free world itself).  Here, the purpose is somewhat questionable, and that works against the audience relating to the characters.So, without any real attachment to any of the men involved, we watch for 90 minutes as they endure hell on Earth.  But keeping track of it all is so difficult that eventually you give up, and the resulting barrage of blank warfare feels like piling on.  There's really no point in watching it, unless you really enjoy watching warfare.  In that sense, you could call it Warnography, because it's war without context.  And that's too bad, because the story behind Black Hawk Down is extraordinarily compelling.  But that's lost here in a haze of gunfire.  Then again, that might be your thing.(Note: When the film is over, we see a screen telling us that 19 Americans died and that over 1,000 Somalis died.  How did the Somalis die?  Were they all killed by Americans?  Did warring factions kill each other?  It's critical information that's left out, and makes Black Hawk Down more frustrating as a result.)",2,Warnography?,1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,2363,"['Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'opening', 'D-Day', 'scene', 'hammered', 'audiences', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Hollywood', 'taken', 'movie', 'brutality', 'couple', 'steps', 'further', 'war', 'films', 'miniseries', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'are', 'essentially', '2', 'hour', 'battle', 'sequences', 'Certainly', 'important', 'show', 'modern', 'audiences', 'just', 'how', 'horrific', 'war', 'can', 'be', 'do', 'such', 'numbing', 'effect', 'up', 'having', 'reverse', 'effect', 'viewers', 'become', 'desensitized', 'even', 'most', 'shocking', 'violence', 'films', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'anti-war', 'are', 'morphed', 'intensely', 'graphic', 'action', 'films.Nothing', 'illustrates', 'point', 'better', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'film', 'masterful', 'technical', 'details', 'ability', 'illustrate', 'tactics', 'modern', 'warfare', 'how', 'can', 'fall', 'apart', 'establish', 'real', 'sense', 'character', 'story', 'concentrate', 'cast', 'maybe', '20', '30', 'soldiers', 'participate', 'disastrous', '1993', 'raid', 'Somalia', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'introductions', 'are', 'so', 'brief', 'indistinct', 'impossible', 'involve', 'personal', 'stakes', 'raid', 'itself.Of', 'course', 'knew', 'nothing', 'characters', 'Ryan', 'went', 'battle', 'learned', 'battle', 'had', 'added', 'context', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'stake', 'namely', 'free', 'world', 'Here', 'purpose', 'somewhat', 'questionable', 'audience', 'relating', 'characters.So', 'real', 'attachment', 'men', 'involved', 'watch', '90', 'minutes', 'endure', 'hell', 'Earth', 'keeping', 'track', 'so', 'difficult', 'eventually', 'give', 'up', 'resulting', 'barrage', 'blank', 'warfare', 'feels', 'piling', 'really', 'point', 'watching', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'warfare', 'sense', 'could', 'call', 'Warnography', 'war', 'context', 'too', 'bad', 'story', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'extraordinarily', 'compelling', 'lost', 'here', 'haze', 'gunfire', 'Then', 'again', 'might', 'be', 'thing', 'Note', 'When', 'film', 'see', 'screen', 'telling', '19', 'Americans', 'died', '1,000', 'Somalis', 'died', 'How', 'did', 'Somalis', 'die', 'Were', 'killed', 'Americans', 'Did', 'warring', 'factions', 'kill', 'other', 'critical', 'information', 'left', 'out', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'more', 'frustrating', 'result']",N/A

One of the reasons for inequality of rewards for effort is that it is almost impossible to know who is doing what with whose help.The flavor comes through in the film. Impressive is the fact that it conveys, knowingly, I assume, the confusion, the lack of accurate information, the unpredictability, the disjuncture between the orders of the highest level and the needs for behavior at the lowest levels where death, maiming and psychic distress are the natural outcomes of infantry combat.If one steps back to look at the larger perspective within which this mission took place, you may form your own opinion about the event, the film, to a remarkable extent does not. Whatever ones broader view of the place this sort of action plays in the life of nations, one should remember that no period of human history has been free of such social behavior while the century just past may have set the record for sheer brutality and certainly did set the record for the number who fell as combatants in war, magnified partly because in modern warfare there is no longer a distinction between military and civilian when it comes to being killed and injured, only a distinction, increasingly blurred, between those who are killed and also kill, and those who are killed but do not kill others directly.",5,Among the Best Infantry Combat Films Ever Made,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,1653,"['actor', 'out', 'here', 'variation', 'character', 'performance', 'masked', 'uniforms', 'nature', 'action', 'consequences', 'men', 'Pretty', 'much', 'what', 'infantry', 'combat', 'differences', 'merged', 'uniform', 'terror', 'heroism', 'instinct', 'self', 'preservation', 'incredible', 'feats', 'bravery', 'submerged', 'din', 'smoke', 'combat', 'One', 'reasons', 'inequality', 'rewards', 'effort', 'almost', 'impossible', 'know', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'help.The', 'flavor', 'film', 'Impressive', 'fact', 'knowingly', 'assume', 'confusion', 'lack', 'accurate', 'information', 'unpredictability', 'disjuncture', 'orders', 'highest', 'level', 'needs', 'behavior', 'lowest', 'levels', 'where', 'death', 'maiming', 'psychic', 'distress', 'are', 'natural', 'outcomes', 'infantry', 'combat.If', 'one', 'steps', 'back', 'look', 'larger', 'perspective', 'mission', 'took', 'place', 'may', 'form', 'own', 'opinion', 'event', 'film', 'remarkable', 'extent', 'not', 'ones', 'broader', 'view', 'place', 'sort', 'action', 'plays', 'life', 'nations', 'one', 'should', 'remember', 'period', 'human', 'history', 'been', 'free', 'such', 'social', 'behavior', 'century', 'just', 'past', 'may', 'have', 'set', 'record', 'sheer', 'brutality', 'certainly', 'did', 'set', 'record', 'number', 'who', 'fell', 'combatants', 'war', 'magnified', 'partly', 'modern', 'warfare', 'longer', 'distinction', 'military', 'civilian', 'when', 'being', 'killed', 'injured', 'only', 'distinction', 'increasingly', 'blurred', 'who', 'are', 'killed', 'also', 'kill', 'who', 'are', 'killed', 'do', 'not', 'kill', 'others', 'directly']",N/A

497634,A3GI22GLBVBGC2,B00000F3KL,Dusty,"[1, 2]","This film came as quite a surprise to me. I had expected another quickly thrown together Hollywood exploitation film that capitalizes on a recent tragedy. But instead, this is a magnificently produced war film that features the most grueling and visceral battle scenes since the original All Quiet on the Western Front brought the reality of World War I home to the general public (Saving Private Ryan came close, though). More important, thanks to our lousy American news media, I had always thought that the entire event depicted here consisted of nothing more than a ""peacekeeping"" helicopter being shot down, and Somalians disrespecting a dead American soldier's body. Instead, it turned out to be and 18+ hour ordeal in which a hundred or so American special forces were pinned down in an urban setting by perhaps ten thousand or more armed Somali militia.What this film does well is to portray the sheer ordeal that these soldiers went through, and to evoke a lot of respect for the way they conducted themselves in a truly desperate situation. The exposition contains a fair amount of foreshadowing of what's to come, yet when the mission finally does turn sour there is no way to miss the contrast between what these soldiers expected, and what they got. They expected a quick in-and-out mission that would take 30 minutes. They ended up with the longest and most desperate fire fight that American soldiers had experienced since the Vietnam War. If you're thinking about things while watching this film, Garrison explained the entire situation succinctly: ""We've lost the initiative.""The battle scenes themselves must be seen to be believed. I was so immersed in them that when I had to interrupt the film for a tornado warning at home, it took me a moment to bring myself ""back"" from Mogadishu. That's effective storytelling.Someone in the ""making of"" documentary summarized what this film is about perfectly, when they said in the thick of battle the two things that keep you alive is your training, and your comrades. One of the greatest paradoxes of humanity is that war is a manifestation of our very worst nature as a species, yet individual soldier's responses to war often exhibit our very best qualities and virtues. You really get a sense of that in this film as men who appear to be somewhat arrogant and irresponsible in their daily lives, suddenly band together and focus as an effective team to ensure their mutual survival.The best example of their commitment to each other came when two Delta Force snipers (who won the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously) asked to be inserted into a hopeless situation just to protect their wounded comrades until reinforcements could arrive. It's a shame that our politicians couldn't conjure up that kind of a focused response to Hurricane Katrina, and that our corporate executives couldn't exhibit that kind of selfless behavior as a devastating economic crisis loomed. How can a congressman or corporate CEO possibly ""earn"" more money than these soldiers do? These soldiers were soaked in their comrades blood, and guns were pointed at them from every direction, constantly. Yet Hillary Clinton cries a river whenever someone smokes a cigarette near her, Donald Trump becomes furious when his interns make a mistake with his corporate lemonade stand, and people actually continue to listen to people like Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck when they suffer meltdowns just because someone else SAID something they don't want to hear. Meanwhile, critics complain about the violence in this film, as if we'll somehow be more productive if we wear rose-colored blinders when viewing the reality of warfare.If you don't like realistic depictions of violence in film, don't be a coward who tries to stop films from depicting it. Be courageous, and stop the violence, instead. Trying to stop filmmakers from depicting what life is really like, is reprehensible. Kudos to Ridley Scott for keeping it real.My God, if nothing else, Black Hawk Down shows us how our lack of sensible priorities are going to destroy America, rather than us being conquered by another nation. I trust these soldiers to defend us against invasion from a foreign army. But who will defend us against the sniveling weasels that run our government, our media, and our corporations? Unfortunately, Black Hawk Down only makes vague allusions to the political intrigue that resulted in this catastrophe that killed 19 men (not to mention the Clinton Administration's response). And like a good soldier, Major General William F. Garrison accepted full responsibility, to take the heat off of his utterly irresponsible Commander in Chief.The film begins much like a typical Irwin Allen disaster film from the 1970's, with a lot of rapid exposition to establish the characters and the setting. This is necessary with so many speaking characters--especially when they all look alike in uniform! My greatest concern is that we have no way to know for certain how accurate these portrayals really are. I would like to have seen an interview with at least one participant in the actual battle in the special features, who could explain which parts of the film were realistic, and which parts were created by artistic license. After all, this film is ""based on an actual event"", which in Hollywoodspeak means that nearly the entire story presented here might be fiction.However, the filmmakers did consult many of the men who took part in the actual battle, so it is probably accurate overall. Those real soldiers made it clear that they wanted this film to honor those who had fallen. I can say, for me at least, that they succeeded. I am always against any kind of war, except for defense against invasion, and I have little respect for the military as an institution that wastes as much as half of our national budget while millions of Americans continue to live in poverty. Yet there is no denying that if we are going to send these men and women into battle, regardless of the reason, they deserve our respect and our support, and we should learn from the example of how they conduct themselves under duress. Black Hawk Down certainly promotes that idea well.But above all else, remember everything that these men endured, when their ultimate goal was simply to see that starving people got fed, especially in a nation where cities like Las Vegas make it illegal to feed the homeless in public places. If you're courageous enough to THINK beyond the particular story being told here, this film has many important things to say to us.",5,Think Beyond The Film,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,6558,"['film',

497635,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00000F3KL,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[54, 66]","Black Hawk Down is war with a capitol W. This film has been blasted by film critics for being racist, biased, and slanted in favor of the Americans. Too bad. This is how it happened. If you want a date movie or a happily-ever-after movie, do not watch this film. If you want to see a war movie that will get your adrenaline pumping and a tear in your eye, watch this film.The story opens with a mild historical lesson to fill viewers in on the background, and some heartbreaking images of the Somali people in the desert. We then cut to American soldiers - some are fresh-faced teens, some are gritty veterans, some are disgruntled clerks. We are introduced to two in particular - Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Harnett), an idealist who pities the Somalis and gets gently teased for it; and Danny Grimes (Ewan McGregor), a soldier who ""made coffee through Desert Storm"" and is somewhat bitter about it, then looking forward to his first mission. We also have ""Lord of the Rings""'s Orlando Bloom as an eager-puppy new soldier, for fans of that actor.The solders are sent on a seemingly-ordinary raid to capture the underlings of a local crime lord. But the place they're in rapidly degenerates into a war zone, with almost every Somali in sight firing at them. The men are trapped in decaying buildings and open alleyways, while two Black Hawk choppers are shot down out of the sky. They have to find a way out and get back to U.N.-controlled territory before they're all killed.One thing to warn you about: There is no happy ending. Some characters you come to care about are going to die, and the ones left over are injured or traumatized. Unlike ""Lord of the Rings,"" nobody applauded when this movie ended because every person was in a state of shock.Acting? Only problem with acting is that Josh Harnett does not have the same skills as the other actors; at times he SOUNDS like he's reading from little fortune cookie papers. He is the Fortune Cookie soldier. It's that trite. Ewan McGregor adds a gritty, quirky side to his disgruntled secretary, while Orlando Bloom manages to fervently pull off ""Well I'm here to kick some ass!"" Charlie Hofheimer is also memorable as Corporal Jamie Smith, in a heartrending scene later in the movie.THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN. Even some teens may not be able to take it. There is continuous graphic violence, including but not limited to: brief full view of a still-living soldier blown in half, part of a soldier's hand blown off, field surgery on someone's leg with no anesthetic, a boy shooting his father when he misses a soldier, a man falling out of a Black Hawk - six stories, and several soldiers dying when their Black Hawks go into death spirals. Even when it isn't violent, it is disturbing - the director never shows us what the Somalis do with the bodies they took from the downed chopper, but a main character's expression shows us what to think.There's a little grim humor: one of the soldiers goes deaf due to the constant gunfire, a standup-comedy act at the beginning of the movie, and Grimes' ironic coffee joke. And the Somalis are not portrayed as faceless; certainly no more so than the soldiers themselves, who eventually start blending together. But if the story can be told, I admit that there should not be too much emotional delving. Though if you dislike profanity... um, the F-word is used about an average of one every three sentences.I agree with the previous reviewers who think that the critics should READ THE BOOK; enough with calling the movie ""propaganda"". The violence was even worse and more disturbing in real life. The soldiers really DID call the Somalis ""skinnies"". The Somali leaders really were corrupt, suave men. The Somalis really were acting savagely. And for heaven's sake, don't whine that they didn't rewrite history to make it a cute tie-up-the-loose-ends movie! No politically-correct frothing will change that -- or should change that! Nor should the nobility of ""leave no man behind"" be sacrificed to the emotionless ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"". These men were willing to sacrifice everything out of loyalty and courage, both for each other and for their country.This movie is full of dramatic, touching moments: the voiceover at the end. The American soldier stumbling into a Somali schoolroom, and silently waving goodbye to one of the solemn-eyed children. A soldier with a broken leg sadly watching his friends' bodies being stripped and dragged away. The soldiers slowing the Humvees for a father holding his child's body. The death scene (you'll know it when you see it). The aforementioned soldier with a broken leg, being beaten by Somalis as he gropes for a photo of his wife and daughter. Eversmann, whose face betrays every little shred of idealism he once had being buried under the blood and dust. The soldiers running to U.N.-occupied territory, with laughing children waving them on.If you loathed Pearl Harbor, watch this. It's probably coincidence that this movie was released post Sept. 11th, but its timing is perfect. Why? Because there are soldiers out there in the Middle-East right now, and this movie can show you what they experience. My extreme sympathies to those 19 families, if they are reading this now.",5,The ugly side of war,1014681600,"02 26, 2002",2002,5268,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'war', 'capitol', 'W.', 'film', 'been',

Instead, as one of the characters says at the end, this is a view of soldiers fighting a war not out of some misguided brainwashed-ideology but for each other---""for the guys next to you.""  Nice contrast to the current Iraq war propaganda of beating up on Third World countries as a ""war on terror"" and ""fighting for freedom and our way of life"" BS.Ridley Scott has always been a visually superb director, and he brings all the style and vividness of his camera to the action scenes, which are excellent and engrossing.  Actually some of the film is reminiscent of his sci-fi classic, ""Blade Runner.""  Overall there's not much character development, zero big-picture historical or political explication.  In short, it's a pretty simple buddy-flick, so don't expect any high art here.The film does beg the question, though: WHY ""leave no man behind?""  Why do we Americans value single individual lives so darn much?  This whole fiasco in Mogadishu would never have occurred if they had simply left the soldier who fell out of the helicopter at the beginning---costing the lives of 17 Americans and at least 1000 Somalis (not to mention all the wounded on both sides).  Wouldn't it be more intelligent to train soldiers going into combat to simply accept death/capture as an inescapable fact of war?  That's how the Japanese soldiers in WW2 were trained, in the samuri tradition: you view yourself as a dead body already, so you fear nothing and can do anything, without fear or doubt or hesitation.  It starts getting ridiculous when some of the Rangers in the film put themselves and others at risk just to retrieve the corpses of a few of their fallen comrades...3 and 1/2 stars.",3,Not anywhere as bad as the commercials...,1049328000,"04 3, 2003",2003,1804,"['make', 'look', 'one', 'Gee', 'whiz', 'are', ""n't"", 'brave', 'noble', 'Americans', 'GREAT', 'propaganda', 'jobs', 'Instead', 'one', 'characters', 'end', 'view', 'soldiers', 'fighting', 'war', 'not', 'misguided', 'brainwashed-ideology', 'other', 'guys', 'Nice', 'contrast', 'current', 'Iraq', 'war', 'propaganda', 'beating', 'up', 'Third', 'World', 'countries', 'war', 'terror', 'fighting', 'freedom', 'way', 'life', 'BS.Ridley', 'Scott', 'always', 'been', 'visually', 'superb', 'director', 'style', 'vividness', 'camera', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'engrossing', 'Actually', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'zero', 'big-picture', 'historical', 'political', 'explication', 'short', 'pretty', 'simple', 'buddy-flick', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'high', 'art', 'here.The', 'film', 'beg', 'question', 'WHY', 'leave', 'man', 'Why', 'do', 'Americans', 'value', 'single', 'individual', 'lives', 'so', 'darn', 'much', 'whole', 'fiasco', 'Mogadishu', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'occurred', 'had', 'simply', 'left', 'soldier', 'who', 'fell', 'helicopter', 'beginning', '-costing', 'lives', '17', 'Americans', 'least', '1000', 'Somalis', 'not', 'mention', 'wounded', 'sides', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'intelligent', 'train', 'soldiers', 'going', 'combat', 'simply', 'accept', 'death/capture', 'inescapable', 'fact', 'war', 'how', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'WW2', 'were', 'trained', 'samuri', 'tradition', 'view', 'dead', 'body', 'already', 'fear', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'fear', 'doubt', 'hesitation', 'getting', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'Rangers', 'film', 'put', 'others', 'risk', 'just', 'retrieve', 'corpses', 'few', 'fallen', 'comrades', '3', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

I for one do not support it, but I deeply respect all men and women who have defended our nation.  Films offer us a gift.  Films can not only entertain us, but most importantly can educate us, as a group of viewers.  When films show images of war, it can either be a masterpiece or an awful waste of film.  When choosing to make a film of war, it is important to express all emotions, feelings, and truthfulness of those who were involved.  I have watched great, moving war films.  And sadly, I have also watched war films that fail to capture the honor, pride, bravery, and truthfulness.  When I saw Black Hawk Down, I knew I had saw images which were true.  I felt many emotions after viewing it.  The greatest emotion I felt was pride.  Especially now, during our current war against terrorism, I honor all those who fight to protect our country.  I definatley, with out a doubt, suggest you should see this film as soon as you can.

I was amazed at how Scott was able to give the audience a clear (most of the time, anyway) idea as to what is going on throughout the film, which is about an insanely chaotic attack and ultimately rescue mission.  The film also avoids any flag-waving patriotism.  I've read a few people complaining about its pro-America stance, but it doesn't really have one, it's rightfully ambiguous.  And Scott (a Brit) also avoids any cheap sentimentality.  I was surprised again, when thinking about the film afterwards, that I didn't get bored seeing as how the film is basically non-stop machine gun fire and explosions.  There's always a little story going on.  One character is deafened by a friend's gun firing too close to him, making for some comic relief.  There are vehicles carrying bodies around, there's a mini-operation, there's always a little something to keep the viewer interested.  I really liked the look and sound of the film.  The color tones are kind of dusty and at night has a blueish tinge; the sounds make an impact and Hanz Zimmer's soundtrack (The Thin Red Line) is also very good.  The film focuses on the incident, rather than the characters, but we get a good sense of each of them.  It's a very linear film however, but it doesn't rely on a three act screenplay.  It's not like The Thin Red Line or Apocalypse Now, it's more like Saving Private Ryan, without the schmaltziness.  I saw this film with a friend of mine, who is an average movie goer, and he liked it just as much as this moviegoer who prefers offbeat, cerebral, foreign, independant films.

While we would love to be heros and rescue the world, we find that without massive resources committing time, money, and lives, there isn't much we can do about it. The frustration of the soldiers is well shown, but as the residents of that country put it, ""It's our Civil War, and you don't belong here"".

497645,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B00000F3KL,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[0, 0]","Before talking about the movie, and while talking about it, it's important for me to mention the book. My boyfriend (a former Ranger) has long spoken of ""Black Hawk Down - A Story of Modern War"" by Mark Bowden as being an excellent account of the conflict in Mogadishu, Somalia. It was a book that was on my long list of Books To Read Soon, but I hadn't ever gotten around to it. When the trailers for the movie started showing, I made an attempt to read the book before we went and saw the film, but I found the author's writing somewhat bland and I had no image of what some of the settings he talked about looked like, and thus I abandoned it after a few chapters in favor of other books.Then we saw the movie, and it renewed my interest in the book, as the book gives much more of the internal dialogue of the soldiers, and more detail. Having seen the film gave me a much better feel for what I was reading about; what the streets and buildings looked like, et cetera. I finished the book, and while I still have the same complaints about the author's writing style, it was a good book. The movie and the book are excellent companion pieces to each other.The movie...it's difficult in some ways to describe. It's not an ""entertaining"" movie, but it is an important film to see, simply to bear witness to the event itself.Some of the commercial reviews I've read are complaining about the gore in the movie; this strikes me as completely asinine. The movie doesn't make a huge deal of the blood and gore, and in fact, doesn't have the level of gore the book contains. The gore is simply a part of the story, and would be unavoidable if one wanted to portray the conflict with any degree of accuracy. If Ridley had lingered upon it unnecessarily, that would be one thing, but he does not. He conveyed the violent injuries and conditions that both sides of the fight had to endure, without crossing into gratuitousness. People who have a low threshold for violence will probably cringe at many points during this movie - there are horrific injuries sustained on both sides of the fight. But it is not blood for blood's sake.There are elements that were changed from the book, most of which seem reasonable due to time constraints and other restrictions. I think Ridley's depiction of the conditions in Mog (to my inexperienced eye) were probably fairly accurate; dirty, gritty, desperate, and cluttered. He didn't spend much time on the Somali side of the story, which was very noticable to me during the movie, and was something the book included quite a bit of. Again, issues of time constraints.On the whole, I enjoy war movies. While I didn't ""enjoy"" this movie per se, I will see it again to soak up more details. It's an epic story about a handful of extraordinary men, heroes, and it deserves all of the attention it's been getting. There's no superfluous love story, and there's not much humor to lighten the mood; this is a tale about the realities of war. Ridley (and Bowden as well) has done the men involved a great honor by sticking to the facts as much as possible.",4,"An important film to see, very well done.",1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,3081,"['talking', 'movie', 'talking', 'important', 'mention', 'book', 'boyfriend', 'former', 'Ranger', 'long', 'spoken', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Story', 'Modern', 'War', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'being', 'excellent', 'account', 'conflict', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia', 'was', 'book', 'was', 'long', 'list', 'Books', 'Read', 'Soon', 'had', ""n't"", 'ever', 'gotten', 'When', 'trailers', 'movie', 'started', 'showing', 'made', 'attempt', 'read', 'book', 'went', 'saw', 'film', 'found', 'author', 'writing', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'had', 'image', 'what', 'settings', 'talked', 'about', 'looked', 'thus', 'abandoned', 'few', 'chapters', 'favor', 'other', 'books.Then', 'saw', 'movie', 'renewed', 'interest', 'book', 'book', 'much', 'more', 'internal', 'dialogue', 'soldiers', 'more', 'detail', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'gave', 'much', 'better', 'feel', 'what', 'was', 'reading', 'about', 'what', 'streets', 'buildings', 'looked', 'et', 'cetera', 'finished', 'book', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'complaints', 'author', 'writing', 'style', 'was', 'good', 'book', 'movie', 'book', 'are', 'excellent', 'companion', 'pieces', 'other.The', 'movie', 'difficult', 'ways', 'describe', 'not', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'important', 'film', 'see', 'simply', 'bear', 'witness', 'event', 'itself.Some', 'commercial', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'are', 'complaining', 'gore', 'movie', 'completely', 'asinine', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'huge', 'deal', 'blood', 'gore', 'fact', ""n't"", 'have', 'level', 'gore', 'book', 'gore', 'simply', 'part', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'unavoidable', 'one', 'wanted', 'portray', 'conflict', 'degree', 'accuracy', 'Ridley', 'had', 'lingered', 'unnecessarily', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'conveyed', 'violent', 'injuries', 'conditions', 'sides', 'fight', 'had', 'endure', 'crossing', 'gratuitousness', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'low', 'threshold', 'violence', 'will', 'probably', 'cringe', 'many', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'horrific', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'sides', 'fight', 'not', 'blood', 'blood', 'are', 'elements', 'were', 'changed', 'book', 'most', 'seem', 'reasonable', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'other', 'restrictions', 'think', 'Ridley', 'depiction', 'conditions', 'Mog', 'inexperienced', 'eye', 'were', 'probably', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'dirty', 'gritty', 'desperate', 'cluttered', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'Somali', 'side', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'noticable', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'book', 'included', 'quite', 'bit', 'Again', 'issues', 'time', 'constraints.On', 'whole', 'enjoy', 'war', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'se', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'soak', 'up', 'more', 'details', 'epic', 'story', 'handful', 'extraordinary', 'men', 'heroes', 'attention', 'been', 'getting', 'superfluous', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'humor', 'lighten', 'mood', 'tale', 'realities', 'war', 'Ridley', 'Bowden', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'men', 'involved', 'great', 'honor', 'sticking', 'facts', 'as', 'much', 'possible']",N/A

497648,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00000F3KL,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 4]","For producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Flashdance"", ""Top Gun"", ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", ""Remember the Titans"", ""Pearl Harbor""), this is a departure from the crowd pleasers he usually produces.  Bruckheimer is one of the most successful producers in Hollywood because he knows that crowd pleasers make a buck.  Even ""Pearl Harbor"" wasn't really about Pearl Harbor, but about a love story with Pearl Harbor as the backdrop.  Here, Bruckheimer produces a straight, no nonsense action film with controversial subject matter and none of his standard crowd pleasing elements.  Oh, and by the way, he still made money.This is not a film for the squeamish.  War is hell and this film turns up the fire.  It is a frank and realistic representation of war, much the same as the beach scene of ""Saving Private Ryan"", only once the action starts, it never lets up.  Ridley Scott gives us a raw depiction of modern warfare, based on actual events from the US military action in Somalia.  Despite a lot of criticism of Scott for not delving deeper into the political issues, I believe he made the right decision in staying focused on this as a combat film.What is so unlike a Bruckheimer film is that there is no workup of any single character.  There is no attempt to get us to love someone and have us pulling for him.  He just gives us a bunch of ordinary grunts that get thrown into a fire fight and try desperately to fight their way out to survive.  No one is a hero, and everyone is.Scott's direction of the action scenes is superb.  This film maintains a dizzying pace and Scott never lets us catch our breath with stunt work and pyrotechnics that defy description.  There is no safety net in this film where we know that certain characters won't die.  Everyone in the cast is a potential casualty.  While this is extremely realistic, it is also one of the shortcomings of the film.  By the end, the viewer suffers from battle fatigue and there is no emotional consolation that at least one character we liked came out okay.The ensemble cast does a fine job of creating realistic battle scenes, though there isn't a lot of meaningful dialogue.  The actors had to go through real military basic training in preparation for the film and it hardened them for the exhausting rigors of their roles.  Josh Hartnett and Tom Sizemore stood out slightly from the rest, but only because they each had slightly meatier roles.This is an intense and credible war film that doesn't so much engage viewers as it does overwhelm us.  From an action perspective it is a 12/10, but in the area of storytelling and character development it falls short.  I rated it an 8/10.

497657,A234L7R41ZLI3H,B00000F3KL,"ginmar ""book/digital addict""","[11, 15]","This is the story of the disastrous raid in Mogadishu on October 3rd, 1993. (The battle lasted over to the next morning, meaning the soldiers were trapped with dwindling ammo, no food, and little if any water in that climate overnight.)  Several of the men who participated in that battle served as advisors or extras on the film, which resulted in one Ranger getting his SAG card! There were a few teensy errors----a couple pieces of music on the soundtrack weren't released at the time, the Grisham book seen in one scene wasn't released in paperback at the time----but it did a very good job in displaying what real combat is like, without going too far in one direction or another, as civilians are wont to do when depicting soldiers.  We either wind up getting shown as emotionless robots or overly emotional wrecks.The raid was doomed from the beginning, as Colonel Bobby McKnight dryly points out. ""Daytime, in the afternoon, when they're all (non-Amazon-approved expletive) up on khat, in the one part of the city where they can muster resistance at the drop of a hat? What's not to like?"" (Paraphrased.)  Soldiers pride themselves on their bearing, their self control, their strength, so there were a few scenes that were a little 'actorish' but not nearly as often as one finds them in other, less serious, movies. (It's easier, I suspect, to portray emotions than to first attain self control and portray controlled-emotions spilling out due to extreme conditions.)The Army wanted to go in to get a bunch of Aidid henchmen,  but their own lax security meant that the population was ready for them. One guy in the book mused on the various flaws in their security: the aircraft hanger they were in faced the city so anybody with binoculars could see when the troops started running around getting ready, plus it was protected only by Hescos by the chow hall, so all it would take was one suicide bomber at chow time and you'd take out a whole squad at least.  There's one extremely low-key but chilling scene where the Blackhawks are flying into the city and a kid with an early-era cell phone holds it up to catch the sound of the rotars---and the soldiers think the kid is waving. By the time the choppers get to the target area,  the tire fires are burning, funeral pyres for victims that still have a short while to live.Two choppers down meant the mission lost the 'initiative', a term that has a lot of meaning for soldiers, some of it nearly superstitious. The personnel from the choppers had to be rescued,  even if they were dead, but the fighting was so incredible that the bodies of Shughart and Gordon wound up getting left behind to be dragged through the streets. The bravery of Gary Gordon and Randy Shughart was given a matter-of-fact treatment that might have reduced the impact on civilians, but Sam Sheppard's dry, pained questioning of the two made it clear that they knew they were going to almost certain death.  The film also captured what looked like realistic shooting; the Americans tended to pick their shots carefully, while the Somalians sprayed,  which is what so many directors have so many characters do in far too many movies. In real life, sometimes one finds civilians get bribed to do this for fifty bucks and the emptying of a certain number of magazines.The movie has an amazing cast of headliners in every role,  from Sam Sheppard as General Garrison, to Jason Isaacs as Captain Steele. A couple of the REAL pilots from the battle flew the choppers, and some of the extras were portrayed by participants as well. (I noted with some amusement that the actors were put through a truncated version of one of the courses I took during my first enlistment!) When one thinks of what this movie would have been like in other hands, it's enough to make one cringe.The high-powered cast makes the characters memorable, because battles don't leave a lot of room for lengthy speeches, and the only glitches---as I noted---are minor and mostly necessary to compress Mark Bowden's excellent book down into three hours. The score was instantly recognizable as one of Hans Zimmer's, and it's interesting to spot faces that Scott went on to use again, as he often does.This review comes from one of the few times I've been able to watch the movie. Its accuracy can make it hard viewing for anybody who's gone through anything of the sort, while Hollywood tripe tends to be comfortingly entertaining thank to its very unreality.

That was one of the questions I asked myself from a military perspective when I recently watched this film again. The missions seem ill-defined in both cases. The military opposition is overwhelming to the point where conventional weaponry and tactics seem outmoded and ineffective to accomplish what thumbnail sketch of a mission there actually is.It often seems that moments of courage are a result of military expedience characterized simultaneously with a predilection of military ineptness. How a general could ever let his men enter a maze-like city surrounded by thousands of hostile inhabitants is beyond comprehension. Sam Shepard as that general exceeded the scope of his mission and his command putting his men in harm's way in broad daylight. Ridley Scott seems uniquely capable of ferreting out the military decisions that led to this debacle but places no blame. However, all the blame is up there on the screen if you choose to take note similar to the way Sam Shepard watches it on his TV monitor. Scott instead places the viewer into a 180-degree maelstrom of bullets, bombs, shrapnel, blood, sweat and tears. In 160 years of technology it is amazing how some of the images are reminiscent of the last stand at the Alamo. What has been learned in all those years? Every good war film needs a hero and Tom Sizemore gives the best performance as one hardened and dedicated officer. The most interesting shot in this film is where a tired and weary group of Americans finally emerge from the city covered in dirt, gunpowder, blood and grease and they are greeted by foreign United Nations troops wearing turbans. These UN fellows offer the Americans glasses of water served from silver trays with white linen napkins draped over their arms. So much for modern technology it would seem.One thing that is certain is the strength of the cast assembled for director Ridley Scott's film. The cast includes Ewan McGregor, Josh Hartnett, William Fichtner, Eric Bana, Jason Isaacs not to mention Sam Shepard and Tom Sizemore again.

In my opinion, you don't need the new edition if you aren't terribly interested in an in-depth study on the raid itself.The film is something of a mixed bag, and although I find it to be harrowing and good, I can easily imagine my negative review for the film.The character developement is cliched and cursory. It doesn't, however, develop over-sentimentality like WE WERE SOLDIERS. Once the guys get in their army gear and all dirty and bloody, it can be difficult to identify them. When the film is nearing the end, we look at some of the characters and say, &quot;Oh, that guy lived.&quot;Complaints have been made about the film's portrayal of the expendability of the Mogadishu civialians.

497663,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,B00000F3KL,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[0, 0]","The subtitle of Mark Bowden's best selling book is"" ""A Story of Modern War.""  The movie version, though limited in scope when compared to the book, does Bowden's account justice. For the most part, the film is historically accurate. Black Hawk Down is arguably the best war movie depicting a modern engagement, but are the themes of the film new? Let's take a look.The film's timeless theme is the loss of innocence. Before the mission, the Delta Force men were the hardened combat veterans, while the Ranger Force, though well trained, had yet to experience their baptism of fire. By the closing scenes, however, the Rangers had earned the respect of their more covert elite comrades, and all involved realised their lives would be forever changed by their ordeal.Like the protagonist of Steven Crane ( The Red Badge of Courage) and Erich Maria Remarque (All Quiet of the Western Front), soldiers have always agonized over how they will perform in battle. More precisely, how they will overcome their fear. For the young Rangers about to jump into utter chaos in Mogadishu in October 1993, these trepidations were all too real.The theme of camaraderie resonates throughout the film. This theme is neither new to the genre of war films, nor to the experience of military service. What makes a soldier advance under a hail of weathering enemy bullets? What makes a soldier continue to face death or possible mutilation to save  wounded comrades? As the Delta sergeant relates: ""It's all about the guy next to you...no one else can understand that."" After the two Black Hawks went down, the surgical insertion had changed to a rescue mission; ""no one gets left behind.""  There are always casualties in battle. Some of those who go out do not return. But no training can prepare those who survive to accept the loss of those who did not. The film conveys this emotion marvelously, in spite of the hardened Delta sergeant who grabs a quick bite and ventures out again, alone.The film is about responsibility more than duty. No soldier best illustrates this virtue better than a sergeant. The timeless NCO who provides the bridge between those who issue orders and those expected to carry them out. Sgt. Matt Eversmann undergoes a transformation from idealist to combat veteran. Not only does he have a job to perform, he also strives to get his men back alive. How he performs his job and deals with its consequences is a true testament to this young man's spirit. Note the list of men killed before the closing credits, most of those who died were sergeants. Out there in the thick of the action, caring for the welfare of their men, we always lose so many fine sergeants!The concerns other reviewers had with character development are warranted. I had the same criticism when I saw the movie in the theater. When experiencing their transformation from ordinary fun loving kids to battle hardened veterans, it is difficult to recall the ""before"" juxtaposed with the ""after."" This  can be easily overcome with a second or third viewing of the DVD. It is for these timeless themes and historical accuracy that Black Hawk Down gets 5 stars and a well deserved thumbs up!",5,"Recent vent, Timeless Themes.",1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,3164,"['subtitle', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'A', 'Story', 'Modern', 'War', 'movie', 'version', 'though', 'limited', 'scope', 'when', 'compared', 'book', 'Bowden', 'account', 'justice', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'arguably', 'best', 'war', 'movie', 'depicting', 'modern', 'engagement', 'are', 'themes', 'film', 'new', 'Let', 'take', 'look.The', 'film', 'timeless', 'theme', 'loss', 'innocence', 'mission', 'Delta', 'Force', 'men', 'were', 'hardened', 'combat', 'veterans', 'Ranger', 'Force', 'though', 'well', 'trained', 'had', 'yet', 'experience', 'baptism', 'fire', 'closing', 'scenes', 'however', 'Rangers', 'had', 'earned', 'respect', 'more', 'covert', 'elite', 'comrades', 'involved', 'realised', 'lives', 'would', 'be', 'forever', 'changed', 'protagonist', 'Steven', 'Crane', 'Red', 'Badge', 'Courage', 'Erich', 'Maria', 'Remarque', 'All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'soldiers', 'have', 'always', 'agonized', 'over', 'how', 'will', 'perform', 'battle', 'More', 'precisely', 'how', 'will', 'overcome', 'fear', 'young', 'Rangers', 'jump', 'utter', 'chaos', 'Mogadishu', 'October', '1993', 'trepidations', 'were', 'too', 'real.The', 'theme', 'camaraderie', 'resonates', 'film', 'theme', 'new', 'genre', 'war', 'films', 'experience', 'military', 'service', 'What', 'soldier', 'advance', 'hail', 'weathering', 'enemy', 'bullets', 'What', 'soldier', 'continue', 'face', 'death', 'possible', 'mutilation', 'save', 'wounded', 'comrades', 'Delta', 'sergeant', 'guy', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'understand', 'two', 'Black', 'Hawks', 'went', 'down', 'surgical', 'insertion', 'had', 'changed', 'rescue', 'mission', 'one', 'left', 'behind', 'are', 'always', 'casualties', 'battle', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'return', 'training', 'can', 'prepare', 'who', 'survive', 'accept', 'loss', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'film', 'conveys', 'emotion', 'marvelously', 'spite', 'hardened', 'Delta', 'sergeant', 'who', 'quick', 'bite', 'ventures', 'out', 'again', 'alone.The', 'film', 'responsibility', 'more', 'duty', 'soldier', 'best', 'virtue', 'better', 'sergeant', 'timeless', 'NCO', 'who', 'bridge', 'who', 'issue', 'orders', 'expected', 'carry', 'out', 'Sgt', 'Matt', 'Eversmann', 'transformation', 'idealist', 'combat', 'veteran', 'Not', 'only', 'have', 'job', 'perform', 'also', 'get', 'men', 'back', 'alive', 'How', 'job', 'deals', 'consequences', 'true', 'testament', 'young', 'man', 'spirit', 'Note', 'list', 'men', 'killed', 'closing', 'credits', 'most', 'who', 'died', 'were', 'sergeants', 'there', 'thick', 'action', 'caring', 'welfare', 'men', 'always', 'lose', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'sergeants', 'concerns', 'other', 'reviewers', 'had', 'character', 'development', 'are', 'warranted', 'had', 'same', 'criticism', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'When', 'experiencing', 'transformation', 'ordinary', 'fun', 'loving', 'kids', 'battle', 'hardened', 'veterans', 'difficult', 'recall', 'juxtaposed', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'overcome', 'second', 'third', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'timeless', 'themes', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', '5', 'stars', 'well', 'deserved', 'up']",N/A

I personally think it's sad that people have come to think that movies like &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; are great war movies.  I don't think &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is bad by any means, but it certainly isn't a good war movie, I mean, out of three hours, 45-60 minutes of it is war.  Not good.Anyway, &quot;BLACK HAWK DOWN&quot; is an emotional, engulfing, and realistic war film.  If you've seen the trailer, which I'm banking on, you know that this was based on an actual event that had taken place in 1993.  If your like me, you didn't have much previous knowledge of the events that took place, but after the movie, your very informed, which is good.&quot;BLACK HAWK DOWN&quot; doesn't have any sub-plots, it's all about the &quot;attack&quot; and extracting the soldiers inside the city.  We know all of the characters, and accept them from the get-go, but we're not impartial to anybody.  If your looking for a war movie all about what it's like inside, then this it.  I really like how fictional characters don't populate the story, and it's not all about love.  But that doesn't mean that it's not emotional, there were moments where I did want to cry.As for realism, well, this is about as real as we can get.  I assume anyway.  I've never been to war, and hope I never have to go.  But this is pretty damn realistic, and there were also moments where I was cringing from the violence and bloodshed.Overall, this is a great film that fails on absolutely no front.  It has the direction, cinematography, story, acting, realism, and emotion.  Things all good war movies require these days.  &quot;BLACK HAWK DOWN&quot; is definitely on my top 5 favorite war movies, right alongside &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Tigerland&quot; and &quot;Glory&quot;.

The film is partly propagandic in painting a simple crude picture of the enemy seizing all food-care shipments from whom they perceive as their enemy.

One reason for doing so was the fact that I wanted to read the book but you know how much effort and time books can take when you're working six days a week. Anyways, so BHD is about a situation in 1993 in a country called Somalia somewhere in Africa. Once again Americans play peacekeepers, there are many characters, many familiar faces, a lot of dialogue that goes over the head but then that is what the film is supposed to be about. Many rounds are fired, many words are spoken and many lives are lost and then in the end, a high rank soldier ends the film by saying only a soldier can understand why they fought the war, why they indluged in this fascist madness. Overall, I must admit I was not intrigued, war films often fail to move me, BLACK HAWK DOWN was sheepish too in this particular respect.

Somalia was and is truely a tragic place and this film clearly puts a fine point on that. Ridley Scott presents a true, gritty account that makes us feel as if we are on the battlefield, and it does not feel good. It took incredibly valiant efforts by the Rangers and the Delta Force to get the job done and see that no man was left behind. Whereas things went wrong for the American troops, they turned right principally due to their mettle and the support they all gave and received from the ""man next to them"".WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:Imagine ""A Bridge Too Far"" + ""The Longest Day"" in 1 film & give that film Ridley Scott to direct and 21st century special effects to make it all too real! That film would be ""Black Hawk Down""! Of course a wonderful and accurate script augmented by fine acting doesn't hurt.Hundreds of thousands of Somalias are unwillingly participants of their own starvation. Food from the United States, the U.N. and the world are getting to the Somalia, but food has turned into a political power issue, and more important than guns to a desperate and despicable warloard and his army. Caught in the marketplace with 2 Black Hawk helicopters down, a 30 minute operation turns into a long afternoon and an even longer night where the entire city seemed to be attacking the American forces.ABOUT THE DVD:The edition I have has an excellent transfer, and great sound in a widescreen format.

He pretty much required all of us to read the book to get us ready for our inevitable confrontation with the realities of war.The reason he made us read the book was not to glorify his actions but to show what the consequences of arrogance in battle can be.  The book does not portray Rangers in a favorable light.  The Rangers saw themselves as elite but Delta was not at all impressed.The real man behing the Grimesy character was SPC John Stebbins.  His name was changed in the movie because he is serving 20 years for being a child molester.  What he told us at the time was that the only thing most Rangers are elite at is their arrogance.The movie misses out on this portion of the book.  Ridley Scott should have done a more thorough job of communicating what was one of the major themes of the book.  This is why I rate this movie as 4 stars instead of 5.The movie does a great job in portraying the battle scenes described in Mark Bowden's book.  It captures all of the intensity of the 18 hour ordeal that my drill sergeant spoke of.Do not look to this movie for a detailed explanation of what all happened in Somalia or why we were there in the first place.  All it portends to do is bring to light the story of a military mission that few would have otherwise known.  That is it.I have seen several reviews of people complaining about the absence of a plot.  If you want a plot look for Rain Man.  This is history there are no plots only facts.  The facts are very accurate according to the reports of the soldiers involved.It is essentially a very gory shoot em up movie because that is what happened in real life.  If he really wanted to gross you out he could have shown the Rangers bodies being dragged through the streets.Sorry if the warlords and their forces are not portrayed in a positive light.

favourite directors Ridley Scott and I have to say this film is beautifully shot.The action sequences are truly amazing-the best he's done  yet.You feel like you're right in the middle of this horrific gun fight,with bullets sounds ricocheting all around you.The sound is truly awesome and almost frightening at times.Some of the scenes are really gruesome and though it must be impossible to truly empathise with the real partcipants-the film makes it seem as realistic as any movie could possibly do.The acting is fine and the dialogue isn't quite as anal as you get in many war movies.There are so many characters however in this film that no truly strong ones emerge from the movie.I suppose the most unusual  and probably most memorable one would be Ewan McGregor's and that's only because he farcically grinds and makes his own coffee in the middle of this savage battle for survival.The film is based around a raid that went horribly wrong for the U.S. rangers in Mogadishu in the mid-90's.Set in a country that had been ravaged by civil war and then famine,the rangers go in to seize a warlord and bring him to justice.They seeem to underestimate the ferocity of the opposition and to make matters worse one simple accident plunges the rangers into a catalogue of nightmare proportions.At this stage we're are all well aware of Hollywood distorting history so it comes as no surprise that this movie should be no different.But sentiment behind this movie I find really shocking and pretty disturbing.Basically it's just the black and white portrayal of the two protagonists that I find amazing.One side is perceived as totally heroic,gallant,etc.Where the Somali's are protrayed as evil monsters.You get great feelings of  grief suffered at the loss of life when it's a ranger and rightly so.But the deaths on the other side make it all feel like you're behind the controls on a video game shoot em' up.The last time I saw Africans portrayed in such a callous and brutal matter was in the movie ""Zulu""-and that movie was made over 30 years ago!I thought at this stage that films have grown beyond the attitude of 1 western life equals 100 third world lives.Only once is their a brief glimpse into the misery all this violence has on a Somali-when a man carries the body of a child.You also never see the killing of many unarmed women and children(inflicted by both sides as the innocent got caught up in the terrible struugle for survival) that was well-documented and was surely inevitable in this particular nightmare.When you spend millions of dollars on a movie maybe it would be worth their while to take time into actually protraying people accurately.Anybody whose spent even the shortest of times in a muslim city will know that the whole place doesn't come to a complete standstill when the evening muezzin call is heard from the mosque.In this movie we have a raging battle and then the streets suddenly become deserted-I mean it's a farce!I love action movies and if this movie had maybe not been based on actual events it may have been more enjoyable.But I just spent my time getting more and more exasperated by the two-sided portayal of each side....",2,A

The sheer style and energy of the film is undeniable and the acting isn't all that bad (highest praise must go to australian Eric Bana).  Unfortunately the one thing it lacks is the slightest hint of why the citizens of Mogadishu hated the U.S. Rangers so much.The tribe which the Mogadishans belived the U.S. were trying to install to power were the same tribe which for years had commited genocide against other indiginous trides of Somalia.  The factor that really tipped the scales was that Blackhawk gunships, only the week before, were responsible for the strafing of unarmed civilians in the centre of Mogadishu.If these thoughts had not been scratching away at the back of my mind whilst watching then this could have been a wonderful story of heroism against impossible odds (and in many ways it, and the event itself, really was).

The vanity of going out for three weeks and launching an offensive at the end of the sixth week to prove things are progressing and improving. Indeed. But vanity it is when one forgets Somalia is not a baseball court, or is it field we should say? And it was in 1992-1993 a civil war and nothing else and Americans were not welcome in that mess. Vanity to the point of instructing the soldiers going out in that Sunday afternoon offensive that it was going to last about thirty minutes, so that they did not even take their night equipment. And of course the targeted people knew the Americans were arriving and they were ready to welcome them in the bullfight arena of Mogadishu's streets. And one helicopter came down and a second one after that. And dozens of American GIs found themselves trapped in the streets and some buildings with hundreds if not thousands of snipers on the roofs everywhere with rocket launchers and that level of weapons. And then instead of retreating as fast as possible, and the defeat was clear within twenty minutes, or let's say an hour, they insisted on going on and attacking on and on and getting deeper and deeper into the trap. More stubborn than I you die. And nineteen GIs died, but of course what was it when compared with one thousand, at least one thousand, dead Somalis, including children and women. And two weeks later finally Bill Clinton got his feet back on earth and got the GIs out. We can always say those nineteen GIs died in vain and are or were heroes, but frankly what about the one thousand Somalis who were killed on their own soil, and what good did these deaths bring to Somalia or to the world? Nothing, absolutely nothing, except the absolute conviction in the heads of these Somalis fighting for power that they were right since troops were coming from so far away to fight against them and be defeated. As one of them could say, there can't be peace without victory, and I would add there can't be peace as long as foreign soldiers are getting mixed in such problems that are none of our concerns, even if we must condemn these autocratic, feudal war lords and governments in the name of universal human and civil rights, but once again peace and democracy cannot be exported like a bag of rice with weapons and grenades to wrap them in.

Its audio does not have the imaging of HBO's Band of Brothers, but its still a good use of a wider sound stage with sound quality FAR above DVD.The BD transfer still has the grain and high contrast that was how the movie was shot.  However, the details are far sharper and clearer, so many of the background elements have more detail given the higher quality of BD.The greater details make snafus much clearer: in the final scene of  Durant's downed chopper, the same assaulting Somali rebels are seen attacking and are killed twice in 2 separate attacks; in the end where Hartnett is reviewing fallen comrades in the morgue, one of the bodies starts moving his eyeballs; in many scenes direct lines of site are made with weapons pointing at targets and despite a hail of gunfire, nothing is hit nor bullets impact the area.  Considering the marksmanship caliber of these troops, it was distracting.  By contrast, in Saving Private Ryan, or Band of Brothers, a view through weapons was succeeded soon by the effect of fire hitting the area viewed.Disk extras are identical to the DVD version but there is a commentary track with some living veterans of the event.  The veterans suggest events on almost every other scene is less true, but they do say that the spirit and most key events are true.  For example, the Durant rescue is close to true, but the depiction of what the Somali's do to the rescuers bodies are not.  The General was never hands on the radio during the entire battle, and the actions on ground depicted by Hartnett's character was actually done by another officer.

This is an intellegent war film; one that has great focus and attention to detail in portraying an event that was not widely known or published.The immediate thing that grabbed me was the competance of the cast. Josh Harnett was fabulous and perfectly cast. As for the international stars the film boasts, the line up was perfect. The audience is presented with a very out of character Ewan McGregor playing the film's psuedo comic relief through his character 'Grimey' Orlando Bloom was great for his brief stint in the film as 'Private Blackburn' and Australian blockbuster newcomer Eric Bana's performance was incendiary.I think part of the film success lies within Scott being British and thus having the ability to not be caught up in the propaganda of the time, which enabled him to give somewhat of an 'outsiders view' on the film. His work in particular in the post production phase had no doubtably influenced the way Hollywood looks at the war film, and how the public looks at cinematography within the war film genre as a whole.The only problem is when making a film in the genre that also conatins the likes of Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Patton, Apocalypse now to name a few. It is difficult to make a film that will undoubtably be compared to these titles in the future. This is what spawns my only major critism of the film. That is I feel the film almost moved too quick for even the most modern/ postmodern 'Moulin Rouge' audience and I was left wanting more. This to could easily be attributed to the rushed style in which Ridley Scott was forced to work after the principal photography.Overall 'Black Hawk Down' is a triumph, one of this year's best fims and if you've seen it... see it again and if not... don't miss it.",4,Ridley's Believe it or not!,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,1840,"['Box', 'office', 'smash', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'achieved', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'intellegent', 'war', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'focus', 'attention', 'detail', 'portraying', 'event', 'was', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'published.The', 'immediate', 'thing', 'grabbed', 'was', 'competance', 'cast', 'Josh', 'Harnett', 'was', 'fabulous', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'international', 'film', 'boasts', 'line', 'up', 'was', 'perfect', 'audience', 'presented', 'very', 'character', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'playing', 'film', 'psuedo', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'was', 'great', 'brief', 'stint', 'film', ""'Private"", 'Blackburn', 'Australian', 'blockbuster', 'newcomer', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'performance', 'was', 'incendiary.I', 'think', 'part', 'film', 'success', 'Scott', 'being', 'British', 'thus', 'having', 'ability', 'not', 'be', 'caught', 'up', 'propaganda', 'time', 'enabled', 'give', 'somewhat', ""'outsiders"", 'view', 'film', 'work', 'particular', 'post', 'production', 'phase', 'had', 'doubtably', 'influenced', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'film', 'how', 'public', 'cinematography', 'war', 'film', 'genre', 'whole.The', 'only', 'problem', 'when', 'making', 'film', 'genre', 'also', 'likes', 'Platoon', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Patton', 'Apocalypse', 'now', 'name', 'few', 'difficult', 'make', 'film', 'will', 'undoubtably', 'be', 'compared', 'titles', 'future', 'what', 'spawns', 'only', 'major', 'critism', 'film', 'feel', 'film', 'almost', 'moved', 'too', 'quick', 'even', 'most', 'modern/', 'postmodern', 'Rouge', 'audience', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'attributed', 'rushed', 'style', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'was', 'forced', 'work', 'principal', 'photography.Overall', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'triumph', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'fims', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'see', 'again', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss']",N/A

Wilkerson,"[2, 2]","In October of 1993, in an effort to secure the Somali town of Mogadishu, Task Force Ranger, comprised of Delta Force soldiers and Rangers, are sent in for a mission that is supposed to last no more than half an hour. But when two Black Hawk helicopters are downed by insurgents with rocket launchers many of the members of Task Force Ranger are left stranded in the city. The ensuing battle lasts for 18 hours.The Battle of Magadishu (also known as The Battle of the Black Sea, Black Hawk Down, and for the Somali's The Day of the Rangers) was both a disaster and a success depending on who you talk to. It was a success in that when all was said and done Task Force Ranger accomplished their main objectives. At the same time, it was a disaster because originally the mission was only supposed to take 30 minutes, but in the end lasted 18 hours and cost the lives of 19 American soldiers and somewhere in the range of 500-2000 Somali's. How do you adapt an 18 hour battle into a two and a half hour movie?Very carefully, and had the movie been placed in a less capable director's hands than Ridley Scott's (Alien, Gladiator) this movie could very well have been a disaster. Ridley Scott, though, along with first time screenwriter Ken Nolan, do their best to capture the battle in a truly authentic light, and they do an amazing job. From what I hear (I have a lot more to learn about the battle) this is possibly the most accurate depiction of a battle ever put to film. I would also argue that it's the best example of modern urban warfare put to film as well.The performances in this film are amazing as, despite a hugely recognizable cast (something I might just be saying because many of the actors in this movie have become huge since, and weren't as big at the time) there is no vanity amongst the actors. Their lack of vanity only adds to the realism, and also builds up the feeling of brotherhood as they act out the battle in the field.All in all, if there was going to be an argument against this film it would really only be the fact that there's not much character development. In the end, though, it's not as much about the characters as it is about the units. It's not as much about the battle as it is a reminder that there are still soldiers that carry the DNA of bravery and brotherhood that we saw in the World War II elite. And it's not so much about Somalia as it is about the war fronts we fight on throughout the world whether in Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc. If you haven't seen this movie yet, definitely give it a shot.4.5/5",4,Black Hawk Down,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,2554,"['October', '1993', 'effort', 'secure', 'Somali', 'town', 'Mogadishu', 'Task', 'Force', 'Ranger', 'comprised', 'Delta', 'Force', 'soldiers', 'Rangers', 'are', 'sent', 'mission', 'supposed', 'last', 'more', 'hour', 'when', 'two', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopters', 'are', 'downed', 'insurgents', 'rocket', 'launchers', 'many', 'members', 'Task', 'Force', 'Ranger', 'are', 'left', 'stranded', 'city', 'ensuing', 'battle', 'lasts', '18', 'hours.The', 'Battle', 'Magadishu', 'also', 'known', 'Battle', 'Black', 'Sea', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Somali', 'Day', 'Rangers', 'was', 'disaster', 'success', 'depending', 'who', 'talk', 'was', 'success', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'Task', 'Force', 'Ranger', 'accomplished', 'main', 'objectives', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'disaster', 'originally', 'mission', 'was', 'only', 'supposed', 'take', '30', 'minutes', 'end', 'lasted', '18', 'hours', 'cost', 'lives', '19', 'American', 'soldiers', 'somewhere', 'range', '500-2000', 'Somali', 'How', 'do', 'adapt', '18', 'hour', 'battle', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'Very', 'carefully', 'had', 'movie', 'been', 'placed', 'less', 'capable', 'director', 'hands', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Alien', 'Gladiator', 'movie', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'disaster', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'though', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter', 'Ken', 'Nolan', 'do', 'best', 'capture', 'battle', 'truly', 'authentic', 'light', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'what', 'hear', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'learn', 'battle', 'possibly', 'most', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'battle', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'would', 'also', 'argue', 'best', 'example', 'modern', 'urban', 'warfare', 'put', 'film', 'well.The', 'performances', 'film', 'are', 'amazing', 'hugely', 'recognizable', 'cast', 'something', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'saying', 'many', 'actors', 'movie', 'have', 'become', 'huge', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'time', 'vanity', 'actors', 'lack', 'vanity', 'only', 'realism', 'also', 'up', 'feeling', 'brotherhood', 'act', 'out', 'battle', 'field.All', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'argument', 'film', 'would', 'really', 'only', 'be', 'fact', 'not', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'end', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'units', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'battle', 'reminder', 'are', 'still', 'soldiers', 'carry', 'DNA', 'bravery', 'brotherhood', 'saw', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'elite', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Somalia', 'war', 'fight', 'world', 'Somalia', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'etc', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'definitely', 'give', 'shot.4.5/5']",N/A

It does indeed have Oscar worthy directing at some points, but at others I think Ridley Scott over did it. The acting is about average (nothing to talk about I guess). The visual effects are about up to par with Saving Private Ryan, they are that good. But at some points your just begging for it to go ahead and end. The story telling is horrible, which leaves a gap in whether or not you would care about the characters. (Which you don't, or I did'nt).

It's the penultimate action film.  And, it's been raking in enormous amounts of money at the box office.Black Hawk Down, a big-budget thrill-ride from director Ridley Scott (Gladiator), went into wide release after it barely squeaked into the 2001 year in New York and L.A.  The action follows a handful of characters, none of whom are developed beyond the basics (they're soldiers doing their job), who are all on the UN Peacekeeping mission in Somalia.  Some are Army Rangers, the others are Delta Force troops.  On a simple operation to capture some of warlord Mohammed Aidid's henchmen, things start to go badly for the troops and for the next two hours, the audience is treated to Scott's signature brand of non-stop action as the soldiers attempt to fight their way back to the UN base.Black Hawk Down has been getting massive critical acclaim from viewers, whom I am willing to bet are more than happy to see American soldiers tear into people who blindly follow some whacko named Mohammed with miniguns attached to helicopters, pureeing the hapless bastards.  Of course, those hapless bastards want to kill the Americans because someone got it in their heads that all the humanitarian aid (read: food) that the world was sending to Somalia should actually make its way to the people and not into Aidid's hands.So these are the two conflicting camps: the self-righteous ""America should help the helpless"" camp, and the even more self-righteous ""America should keep its hands to itself"" camp.  The third camp, who wouldn't mind watching the wholesale slaughter of hundreds of dark-skinned people named Mohammed, are apparently the ones going to see this movie.  As the historical placard announces at the end of the film, Americans lost 19 men in this mission, and there were over 1000 Somalis who died at our soldiers' hands.  Yes, they wished our soldiers harm.  Yes, they were shooting at our soldiers.  But, somehow, I don't think killing on such a massive scale is war - although I'm sure General Patton would disagree.Regardless of the ethical implications, Black Hawk Down is still a darn good war movie.  It's easily on par with Saving Private Ryan, although I would hesitate to rank it with other recent-conflict fare such as Three Kings.  It suffers from lack of character development, as you really don't feel for the Americans who die other than that they are Americans, and it's action sequences aren't nearly as violent or thrilling as advertised.  In short, it's not the original, be-all-end-all war film folks made it out to be.  In the post-September-11th world, expect more of this kind of American Sunshine, but please don't just roll over and take it in suppository form just because it's patriotic - at least demand that it be good, if we're going to call it good.",4,"Very Good, but Not Great",1011571200,"01 21, 2002",2002,2912,"['war', 'movie', 'historically', 'correct', 'poetic', 'license', 'gritty', 'real', 'fantasy', 'film', 'penultimate', 'action', 'film', 'been', 'raking', 'enormous', 'amounts', 'money', 'box', 'office.Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'big-budget', 'thrill-ride', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Gladiator', 'went', 'wide', 'release', 'barely', 'squeaked', '2001', 'year', 'New', 'York', 'L.A', 'action', 'handful', 'characters', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'developed', 'basics', ""'re"", 'soldiers', 'doing', 'job', 'who', 'are', 'UN', 'Peacekeeping', 'mission', 'Somalia', 'are', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'others', 'are', 'Delta', 'Force', 'troops', 'simple', 'operation', 'capture', 'warlord', 'Mohammed', 'Aidid', 'henchmen', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'badly', 'troops', 'next', 'two', 'hours', 'audience', 'treated', 'Scott', 'signature', 'brand', 'non-stop', 'action', 'soldiers', 'attempt', 'fight', 'way', 'back', 'UN', 'base.Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'been', 'getting', 'massive', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'viewers', 'whom', 'am', 'willing', 'bet', 'are', 'more', 'happy', 'see', 'American', 'soldiers', 'tear', 'people', 'who', 'blindly', 'follow', 'whacko', 'named', 'Mohammed', 'miniguns', 'attached', 'helicopters', 'pureeing', 'hapless', 'bastards', 'course', 'hapless', 'bastards', 'want', 'kill', 'Americans', 'someone', 'got', 'heads', 'humanitarian', 'aid', 'read', 'food', 'world', 'was', 'sending', 'Somalia', 'should', 'actually', 'make', 'way', 'people', 'not', 'Aidid', 'hands.So', 'are', 'two', 'conflicting', 'camps', 'self-righteous', 'America', 'should', 'help', 'helpless', 'camp', 'even', 'more', 'self-righteous', 'America', 'should', 'keep', 'hands', 'camp', 'third', 'camp', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'wholesale', 'slaughter', 'hundreds', 'dark-skinned', 'people', 'named', 'Mohammed', 'are', 'apparently', 'ones', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'historical', 'placard', 'announces', 'end', 'film', 'Americans', 'lost', '19', 'men', 'mission', 'were', '1000', 'Somalis', 'who', 'died', 'soldiers', 'hands', 'Yes', 'wished', 'soldiers', 'harm', 'Yes', 'were', 'shooting', 'soldiers', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'killing', 'massive', 'scale', 'war', ""'m"", 'sure', 'General', 'Patton', 'would', 'disagree.Regardless', 'ethical', 'implications', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'still', 'darn', 'good', 'war', 'movie', 'easily', 'par', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'would', 'hesitate', 'rank', 'other', 'recent-conflict', 'fare', 'such', 'Three', 'Kings', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Americans', 'who', 'die', 'other', 'are', 'Americans', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'violent', 'thrilling', 'advertised', 'short', 'not', 'original', 'be-all-end-all', 'war', 'film', 'folks', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'post-September-11th', 'world', 'expect', 'more', 'kind', 'American', 'Sunshine', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'roll', 'over', 'take', 'suppository', 'form', 'just', 'patriotic', 'least', 'demand', 'be', 'good', ""'re"", 'going', 'call', 'good']",N/A

Its length makes it overlong for what it is, lacking clear focus on plot, overall message, or taut action. I hoped to see clear indication of morale or lack thereof on the part of the soldiers. I hoped to see a sense of mission or lack thereof in the Somali war. I hoped to see a clear sense of whether these soldiers knew what they were fighting for, or whether the war for them was an exercise in confusion and/or futility. But none of those things came out clearly. Instead it just seemed like a disjointed sequence of often vivid clips with no clear whole emerging. The result would better befit a documentary of maximum length around 90 minutes. Some more successful war movies, like PLATOON, are clearly focused on an unrelenting sense of the horror of it all. Others, like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, are equally unrelenting in maintaining a sense of mission amidst the carnage. But this movie is caught in a no-person's land between those two poles.

It does develop a few characters and let you get to know them so you care what happens to them, but then it jumps right into the action and just keeps building to the end.  The battle scenes are intense and you find yourself almost wanting to duck and cover throughout the movie.  It is fairly graphic and hard to watch at times, but it does a great job of showing the bravery of the soldiers who did the best they could in a horrific situation while showing how a lot of little decisions can add up to a big problem later (i.e. don't take enough water, ammo or night vision because they are heavy and you don't think you will need them).The recreation of the actions of MSgt Gordon and SFC Shughart who selflessly volunteered to go into a desperate situation to protect a downed helicopter pilot knowing that the chances for survival were extremely poor was especially striking and a little hard to watch knowing that they were awarded posthumous Congressional Medals of Honor for their bravery.  Bottom line is that while the movie most certainly is somewhat sensationalized to fit into a 2 hour Hollywood movie format with big budget stars etc, it also does a great job conveying the futility, fog and confusion of modern urban combat.",5,Intense War Movie,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1303,"['movie', 'little', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'actual', 'battle', 'develop', 'few', 'characters', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'so', 'care', 'what', 'then', 'right', 'action', 'just', 'keeps', 'building', 'end', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'intense', 'find', 'almost', 'wanting', 'duck', 'cover', 'movie', 'fairly', 'graphic', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'bravery', 'soldiers', 'who', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'horrific', 'situation', 'showing', 'how', 'lot', 'little', 'decisions', 'can', 'add', 'up', 'big', 'problem', 'later', 'i.e', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'enough', 'water', 'ammo', 'night', 'vision', 'are', 'heavy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'need', 'recreation', 'actions', 'MSgt', 'Gordon', 'SFC', 'Shughart', 'who', 'selflessly', 'volunteered', 'go', 'desperate', 'situation', 'protect', 'downed', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'knowing', 'chances', 'survival', 'were', 'extremely', 'poor', 'was', 'especially', 'striking', 'little', 'hard', 'watch', 'knowing', 'were', 'awarded', 'posthumous', 'Congressional', 'Medals', 'Honor', 'bravery', 'Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'most', 'certainly', 'somewhat', 'sensationalized', 'fit', '2', 'hour', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'format', 'big', 'budget', 'stars', 'etc', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'conveying', 'futility', 'fog', 'confusion', 'modern', 'urban', 'combat']",N/A

Jones,"[1, 1]","I orignally watched &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; at the theaters after reading the book and watching the documentary on CNN, but &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; is even better on DVD and I'll tell you why:  (1.  Subtitles.  Many things occur in &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; and Director Ridley Scott has the complex task of breaking down an almost one day old fire fight involving hundreds of lives into a two hour film.  One complaint about this film is the fact that it is hard to keep track of who the main characters are.  The subtitles help.  (2.  The story behind the making of &quot;Blackhawk Down.&quot;  The story on the DVD about the making of &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; was about as good as watching the movie itself because it explained the whole story plus the main characters in great detail including all the work that went into the making of the film which for me, anyway, enriched the whole film much more.  For example, I did not know that the Defense Dept. not only provided the blackhawk helicoptors for the movie, but also the personnel to actually do the stunts.  I also did not know that the actors involved actually went to a shortened bootcamp at Fort Benning, Ga. to recreate the training of the Rangers, and that the Delta operators went to Fort Bragg, North Carolina and learned how to make bombs and such like the Delta Team Operators do.  That was very interesting.  I also did not know that the actor who played Mike Durant, the captured helicoptor pilot, got to meet the real Mike Durant and that he was very touched by that experience.  That richened my appreciation of the film.  The sound on the DVD was excellent as well and having the ability to replay certain scenes over and over allowed me to comprehend what was going on in the film.  All in all, &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; was and is a great film and by watching it on DVD and taking advantage of the subtitles option as well as watching how &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; was made, a viewer can get to really understand and appreciate the movie even more.",5,Even Better on DVD than it was in the Theater,1024185600,"06 16, 2002",2002,2035,"['orignally', 'watched', 'quot', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'theaters', 'reading', 'book', 'watching', 'documentary', 'CNN', 'quot', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'even', 'better', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', '1', 'Subtitles', 'Many', 'things', 'occur', 'quot', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'complex', 'task', 'breaking', 'down', 'almost', 'one', 'day', 'old', 'fire', 'fight', 'involving', 'hundreds', 'lives', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'One', 'complaint', 'film', 'fact', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'subtitles', 'help', '2', 'story', 'making', 'quot', 'Blackhawk', 'Down.', 'quot', 'story', 'DVD', 'making', 'quot', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'watching', 'movie', 'explained', 'whole', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'great', 'detail', 'including', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'anyway', 'enriched', 'whole', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'example', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Defense', 'Dept', 'not', 'only', 'provided', 'blackhawk', 'helicoptors', 'movie', 'also', 'personnel', 'actually', 'do', 'stunts', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'actors', 'involved', 'actually', 'went', 'shortened', 'bootcamp', 'Fort', 'Benning', 'Ga.', 'recreate', 'training', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'operators', 'went', 'Fort', 'Bragg', 'North', 'Carolina', 'learned', 'how', 'make', 'bombs', 'such', 'Delta', 'Team', 'Operators', 'do', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Mike', 'Durant', 'captured', 'helicoptor', 'pilot', 'got', 'meet', 'real', 'Mike', 'Durant', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'experience', 'richened', 'appreciation', 'film', 'sound', 'DVD', 'was', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'ability', 'replay', 'certain', 'scenes', 'allowed', 'comprehend', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'quot', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'watching', 'DVD', 'taking', 'advantage', 'subtitles', 'option', 'as', 'well', 'watching', 'how', 'quot', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'viewer', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'even', 'more']",N/A

Although we recognize some actors whenever they appear, like Tom Sizemore or Josh Hartnett, the focus is on the situation.  That situation, here, is the battle in Mogadishu rather than the entire police action, or war in general.Within the streets, small accidents happen and some communications are clear.  Regardless, the American troops continue to move through the battle with one, personal, directive: Leave no one behind.  As a result, more soldiers are injured or die, and more assets are expended.  For what cause?  The main objective was accomplished, so why all the waste?This is where the movie, to me, parallels Tennyson's tale of the Light Brigade.  Even though the troops were being gunned down, they maintained the principle of obeying orders.  With the events of this movie, the same idea is here.

It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993.Ahh emotions, a subject of much debate where this movie is concerned, at least among some critics. While the reviews for ""Black Hawk Down"" have on average ranged from ""Good to Excellent,"" there has been persistent and growing criticism over the lack of clearly drawn out characters that the audience could connect with, the lack of historical context, and the fact that movie is all action, with no heart, with no point-of-view. Well I think those who criticize the movie on these grounds, have completely missed the point of the movie, and are flat-out wrong. It is a movie told from the soldier's point-of-view, pure and simple. This is not a political movie; this is not a movie that needs cheap sentimentality or conventional emotional ""hooks"" for the characters. As much as I liked Saving Private Ryan, the overly sentimental framing device used by Spielberg, really annoyed me. It felt like he was pandering to the audience just a little bit, and it wasn't necessary. Well, there's no pandering here, no cheap sentimentality in ""Black Hawk Down,"" just the horrible, gruesome, disorienting reality of modern combat. I didn't know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center, but I was moved to tears by what happened to them on Sept. 11 and that's the way I felt today in the movie.As far as I am concerned there was plenty of emotion in ""Black Hawk Down,"" plenty of ""choke-up"" moments, or moments when I was moved by the unbelievable courage shown by the soldiers as they faced an almost hopeless situation. I'm not sure how anyone could not be moved by seeing these 18-25 year-old men trapped in the horror of a Civil War that had no bearing on U.S. National Security. As portrayed by the amazing ensemble cast, these men (really boys in many cases) showed the full range of emotions that our soldiers must have gone through, not to mention the fear and confusion of their situation. To me the cast standouts were Josh Hartnett, as Staff Sgt Eversmann, and Eric Bana as Sgt 1st Class ""Hoot.""""Black Hawk Down"" is a great movie, and it is an important movie. It is the story of courage and heroism against nearly insurmountable odds. What happened in Somalia was a foreign policy failure for the U.S., but the actions of the soldiers sent into battle that October day were anything but failure.

This movie isn't a huge, compelling epic. It is a well directed dramatization of a little known event. The action is great in this movie, and the acting is Okay (Josh Hartnett?) In fact, probably because of Jerry Bruckheimer, about half the cast of Pearl HArbor are in this movie playing very similair roles. I found this pretty funny.

It's moving, tense, very graphic, the performances are strong and it has some of the best war action ever put on film. Speaking of the strong performances, I'm not sure why none of the actors were at least nominated for best supporting actor. There's so many that should of been considered, like Eric Bana (The Hulk), who's gonna be a huge actor. His little speech at the end is fantastic. Also Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepard give osacr worthy performances as well. Sizemore should probably be in every war movie as he's great in all of them, was in Born on the 4th of July, Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor. At his best in this though, probably his best performance yet.

After reading the book and seeing this film I was astounded by how little I knew about this particular event.I recall the CNN tape of Corporal Michael Durant held captive by the Somalis and saw the hideous footage of the two American servicemen's bodies being dragged through the streets, but I had little idea that this was the result of a 25-hour battle. I didn't know that we lost 19 of our troops with fifty-seven others wounded.The film starts off with a little backdrop - Somali warlords commandeering the food deliveries being made by the international relief effort. The U.S. stepped in with 20,000 Marines to restore order and order was restored, at least until the Marines were evacuated. As soon as the Marines left Mohammed Aidid an Al Qaeda associate declared war on the U.N. and began to attack the food shipments again.By October of 1993 there was only a few Battalions of Army Rangers and some Delta Force commandos based in Somalia. Washington wanted ""something done about Aidid,"" but when the base commander (played by Sam Sheppard) asks for more firepower he's denied. So on October 3rd, 1993 the U.S. forces set out on a mission to capture Aidid at a meeting in Mogadishu. The plan is to cover the four corners with Black Hawk helicopters, while a Ranger Battalion goes in with armored vehicles to take the prisoners. It's supposed to be a no muss, no fuss mission...over and done in a couple of hours.Of course, it didn't happen that way. The Somali militias are well armed with surface to air missiles (RPGs) and automatic weapons. What follows is a twenty-five hour pitched gun battle and that is the focus of this film.The battle scenes are graphically vivid and almost unending...some 80% of the film is compromised of this single engagement. The film is often disturbing, often repulsive - a makeshift ""operation"" on a soldier dying from a bullet wound that severed an artery is particularly gruesome.Still, critics who bash this movie for ""lack of character development"" and a weak story-line, referring to it as a ""dressed up documentary,"" miss the point that THE UNIT IS THE CHARACTER. The battle and the troops response to this unexpected bit of war was the STORY-LINE. The battle itself is the protagonist and the human reaction to massive carnage is the story.It's hard to compare this film to other war movies. It has the terrible reality of the D-Day scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but it's focused entirely on a single horrific event. The battle scenes are grisly, realistic and the acting is first rate.

Mohlman,"[15, 17]","On October 3, 1993 American Rangers, Delta Force members and aviators engaged in a running gun battle with Somali militiamen over the period of 16 hours.  When all was said and done, 19 Americans and at least 1000 Somali's were dead.  It was the bloodiest day for American infantry since Vietnam, a period that encompassed Grenada, Panama, and the Gulf War.""Black Hawk Down"" is director Ridley Scott's adaptation of Mark Bowden's incredible chronicle of that day's events.  In my opinion, he has created a remarkable film, and a powerful tribute to those who lost their lives.  In fact, in terms of the shear power of his portrayal of combat, I would have to argue that this might be the greatest war film ever made.There are those who say that this film is lacking in character development, that it doesn't tell a story or offer a big picture view of what happened.  They miss the point.  Scott's purpose was to portray the brutality and terror of combat in the most realistic way possible, and he succeeded.  The only character development that matters is that which appears under fire, and the big picture story is irrelevant to the viewer because it was irrelevant to the American soldiers who were fighting for their lives against an entire city.  Likewise, some accuracy was sacrificed in order to facilitate the telling of the story within the confines of a two-hour movie.  Some events and people are merged; others are eliminated entirely.  If you are interested in the ""big picture"" I would strongly recommend reading the book prior to the movie, as it will offer insight and depth into what is happening on the screen.And there is quite a bit happening; Scott filmed ""Black Hawk Down"" with the fill support and backing of the Army, and it shows.  No matter how good CGI has become, it can't compare to an actual Blackhawk (my one pet peeve about the book and the movie is that ""Black Hawk"" should be one word) helicopter.  Likewise, the representation of the soldiers' gear is largely dead-on, with the discrepancies largely due to an effort to minimize confusion among viewers unfamiliar with military operations.  Also, the cinematography is spectacular.  Scott used a host of different angles, as well as dismounted cameras to as closely as possible replicate the chaos of combat.  At the same time, the cameras seem to have been left unfiltered and the result is a bright, gritty, incredibly realistic look.The acting was likewise superb; while there was no ""lead actor"" per se, there wasn't a single bad performance out of a group that included at least 20 people with significant lines.  In particular, Tom Sizemore proved himself to be one of the best character actors around today.  He'll never be a great leading man, but he is an incredible presence on screen nonetheless.Unfortunately, this remarkable performance and the men it honors have been let down by a terrible DVD.  While the sound and picture are fine, the extras are a joke.  There's a making of documentary that is all right in and of itself, but that's it.  The original theatrical trailers weren't even included, and there was an excellent History Channel documentary that should have been added.  No director's commentary, no actor interviews; I'm sure there'll be a ""Special Edition"" in a few months, I would recommend renting this movie until that comes out because this edition left me feeling distinctly ripped off.Still, that shouldn't detract from this fantastic movie.  It is a raw, graphic, disturbing, and profoundly moving portrait of the heroes who defend our country every day.

497731,A1EKA9XSI641C9,B00000F3KL,John S. Milas,"[3, 5]","This is my favorite war movie of all time.  Ridley Scott has done an excellent job telling the story of the Mogadishu battle in 1993.  Yes, some of the events have been changed and characters combined from the book, but the movie is so good that none of it matters.  This war movie tells the story of what happens, it doesn't delve into thoughts of people or their odd poetic fantasies (Thin Red Line) and it doesn't go into slow motion to show one person sitting in the middle of a warzone watching his comrades die in horror (Saving Private Ryan).  This movie is a real time account of the battle and shows what happens.  It's a non-stop battle in the middle of a city.  The action never lets up one moment thoughout the whole movie, so it might be too much for some, but it's excellent.  This 3 disc set is awsome.

It's terrible. It's just like what's going on now with the Afgans. They don't want to be like us...they don't want to have democracy, so they kill.

As many people have said, it attempts to state the facts and not make judgements or take sides, etc. That's terrific, but I think this film should have been a documentary in that case, which I would have enjoyed much more (and I sincerely mean that, by the way). Even those who liked the movie admit that the audience never gets a chance to ""know"" the characters, and once the fighting starts, it never stops. Again, realism is great, but I don't enjoy feeling lie I am being shot at for 2 hours (I know how much that sounds like a crabby old person). Because there is no attempt at moralizing, taking any side, or giving us anything (emotional, philosophical, ANYTHING) for us to chew on, this movie just succeeded in making me nauseous, just as Hannibal had done. However boring people think ""The Thin Red Line"" is, at least there was an attempt on the filmakers' part to let the audience become emotionally and/or mentally involved. Through ""Black Hawk Down"" I was just cringing to avoid enemy gunfire, with no relief for 2 hours.

497744,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00000F3KL,JRP,"[1, 3]","Well it's been a little over a month since I reviewed a movie this will be my 1st movie review of 2012 & this is a new set of reviews called 20 Years Ago & 2002 in film. But I'm going to start off with The 2002 classic if you want to call it that Black Hawk Down this movie what can I say it has stuck with me since I 1st saw it on TV in 2003. Directed by Ridley Scott who directed Blade Runner, Alien Thelma & Louise, GI Jane & Hannibal. I know he's directing Promethous which I have no hope for. I have gave up on both Alien & Predator franchises. But I am here to review & give my thoughts on Black Hawk Down starring Josh Hartnett as Matt Eversmann, Ewan McGregor as John Grimes, Orlando Bloom as Todd Blackburn, Tom Sizemore Danny McKnight, Ewen Bremmner as Shawn Nelson, Eric Bana as Norm Hooten &  Jason Isaacs as Captain Mike Steele the movie has a huge cast some of them were up & comers in acting, The story is back in the early 90's a crisis broke out in The Eastern African Contury of Somali a a cival started lots of men with families died they either starved to death or by the hand of The Warlord Aidid. I remember hearing about Somali on the news & there was Soldiers dragged through the streets of Mogadishu the capital of Somali. In 1992 The UN sent Peacekeepers that tried to help aid the war torn country. Aidid declared war on them. So in The Summer of 1993 The US Government sent in The Army Rangers The Delta Force & The 106th Special Operations Avation Regiment to capture Mohammed Farrah Aidid.  This is where your introduced to the group of characters Matt Eversmann an Idealist Blackburn, Luietenant McKnight & Hooten. I would say Hooten was my favorite character I like the scene where he tells Eversmann "" It doesn't matter what I think cause when the 1st bullet flies by all that bulls  h  i  t about politics goes out the window .""  I know I didn't do anywhere as good as Eric Bana did with that quote. John Grimes he was funny "" You know when Desert Storm happend I wasn't there with my brothers. I was making the coffee. When that s  h  it went down in Panama I was making the coffee. You have Blackburn he is a  bad  a  s  s he tells this guy like it is cause this new recruit thinks he's going to kick some a  s  s in The Mog as The Troops call it. Blackburn just tells him like it is. When they go out in battle Eversman is in charge. They fly into the city by a Blackhawk Helicopter The Soldiers deploy out of Blackburn accidently falls to his death. Then all h  e  l  l breaks loose & give credit to Ridley Scott he did a great job it was well shot how he filmed all these battles these scenes are very violent. There's this guy Durant who is hurt he was in a Helicopter Crash he can't walk the scene where he is taken by these Milita Men & he keeps trying to grap the picture of his wife & son is very sad.Eversmann feels responsible for everything that happend cause he wanted everything to go smoothly. There are some brutal scenes like a Soldier blown in half I know it's a movie but I feel for this guy. The back of the box says Ridley Scotts vision is awesome & I agree with the critics for once. These guys act like American Soldiers unlike The Hurt Locker I didn't feel anything for those guys I didn't care about them like the guys in this movie or Saving Privet Ryan or even We Were Soldiers. Josh Hartnett's ending monolouge was great. He definitly does a better job here than he did in Peral Harbor which was Michael Bay's fan fiction. The part with Eric Bana's line where he talks about when he goes back home is great Im not repeating it if you've never watched this movie I want you to hear that quote. This cast cliclks well together. I know I didn't go over the plot well but what can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said.

After a few minutes of obligitory character setup which seems to exist just so you know the pecking order of the characters, the film rapidly moves on to setting up the mission and getting to the action.From this point it's typical Hollywood fare, using the special effects first seen in Saving Private Ryan to wow the audience with visual effects.  While it certainly includes the salient issues of the story and does a wonderful job depicting them in the high standards of Hollywood special effects, it doesn't touch on any of the issues surrounding this battle.Who is Aidid?  Why is the UN there?  Why is the US there?  The Army's Ranger units are elite units unto themselves, yet this film makes them look like nervous adolescents who forgot their training and don't know what to do and are saved only by the presence of Delta force members.While the movie is a great action film and does a good job depicting the events of this particular engagement, it's placed in a void that most viewers probably can't fill in themselves. If you just want a film to sit and watch some action while eating popcorn, this is a good film.  But if you want to understand anything about the situation these men were in, you'll need to look elsewhere. I'd suggest A&amp;E's excellent documentary entitled The True Story Of Black Hawk Down.

As an active duty service member, it doesn't take long before someone you know, someone you trained with, gets killed. In some ways it doesn't matter if it was in the line of duty, or some random off duty accident, it hurts just the same. And there's always some jerk who feels compelled to point out that that person knew what they were signing up for. I'm sorry, I didn't sign up with the intention of dying; but if that's what it takes to save a buddy, or people you may never meet, what would you do?It's a sorry state of affairs when it takes a movie to get Americans to realize that there are people out there dying all the time to make sure that those same Americans can sit comfortably in a theatre, eating popcorn, and carrying on as if there aren't really parts of the world where acts of unimaginable horror are common place. So oblivious have we become, that Hollywood is now our source of history lessons, and even our conscience. I read some of these negative reviews, and they make me laugh. What a fitting legacy to those who sacrificed their own lives, that there are people who will complain about the minutiae of a movie. Grow up. More importantly, I would like you to think long and hard about the fact that even though the movie ended, and you went on with your easy lives, those people who died, they're still dead. They still left widows, and they still left children behind that will never know them. Do you think they wanted to die? Do you think they wanted to die for a country of people who forgot about them as easily as last weeks lotto numbers? Americans scoff at the idea that freedom isn't free; well at least those who have never had to sacrifice a single thing for either, which is most Americans these days.So here it is, the movie a lot of us have been waiting for, a movie no less important, or significant than Saving Private Ryan. At least in that movie there was the bitter sweet satisfaction of one small victory in all the sea of misery. Not so in Black Hawk Down. There is no sugary ending for the vapid self absorbed movie-goer. I am grateful that just about all of you will never have to live through something like this, and can only hope that I won't ever have to either. I am grateful that there are those out there who put their lives on the line for people the rest of the world would just as soon let die. I am grateful to live in a country that helps countries like Somalia, until they spit in our face. Don't forget, the reason we were there was to feed the starving people of that country, and bring some kind of stability to it. But there are people out there with so little respect for human life, that they allow people to starve to death just to be able to control them. Think about that next time you're complaining about OUR gov. while you're on your way to [insert fast food restaurant here] to buy food that's probably going to give you heart disease anyways. You've got an easy life built upon the graves of others, so cherish the freedom they have purchased with their very blood. That was always the best way to honor them anyways.Oh, and if you've never been in combat, it's probably best not to comment on how realistic this movie is, because you insult those who have.

It is for this reason alone I cannot take Black Hawk Down seriously. Just as I couldn't take Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"" seriously, along with that excruciating film ""U-571"".What continually amazes me is that whenever a movie based on a historical event is filmed most Directors (all nationalities) swiftly scream ""POETIC LICENCE! POETIC LICENCE!"" when criticized. ""Black Hawk Down"" has ""poetic licence"" stamped all over it even though it has been claimed that this movie portrays the 1993 events with considerable accuracy. Well I'm really sorry here chaps but I can't buy the considerable accuracy tag and I think that a lot people in the UK (I can't speak for the US) are taking ""Black Hawk Down"" with a bucket of salt and will go and see it for one reason alone.

BLACK HAWK DOWN is about the 1993 battle in which two U.S. Army helicopters were downed and nearly 100 U.S. Special Forces troops were trapped overnight in a hostile section of Mogadishu, Somalia. These Special Forces were awarded with two Congressional Medals of Honor for conspicuous heroism. Tragically, 18 Americans were killed in this battle.Very few movies portray combat realistically. The vast majority of war movies show us a phony heroism in a fabricated combat. This movie realistically depicts what actually happened in that unfortunate battle. It very definitely is not for the squeamish. It tells us about the true heroism, patriotism, dedication, skill, and sacrifice that the Special Forces made in this conflict. Their devotion is well expressed in the closing verse of the anonymously written, memorial poem Black Hawk Down:They gave without askingA reward never knownThey sacrificed freelyAnd our brother came home.After seeing this movie, you will better understand why the U.S. Special Forces troops were so brilliantly successful in Afghanistan.Why did the Mogadishu mission fail?

497762,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00000F3KL,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[5, 7]","BLACK HAWK DOWN is Ridley Scott's and Jerry Bruckheimer's cinematization of author Mark Bowden's phenomenally dynamic retelling of the Battle of Mogadishu (October 1993) in which 100 U.S. peacekeeping troops tasked to neutralize Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid were attacked by thousands of armed Somalis. I have never seen a book translated to film so faithfully.The film, like the book, is riveting and disturbing. From its opening scenes of malnourished Somali corpses to its closing moments as we discover the fate of the soldiers involved in the operation, BLACK HAWK DOWN never falters in its depiction of warfare as the collective fate of individuals: ""You fight for the guy beside you.""What the Somalis fought for is less clear, and why they fought the Americans at all seems at first glance to be a puzzle; that is, until the American incursion is seen through Somali eyes, not as a peacekeeping mission but as an incursion against the Somali social bulwarks of clan and faith. Their rage is palpable, and if only a very few Somali voices are heard  castigating the U.S. for its role in BLACK HAWK DOWN, the scenes of mob violence speak their own language. The ongoing battle scene that makes up most of this film is so relentless that it is disorienting, but such is the true nature of war.Aidid and his minions were able to inflame such a vast proportion of the population that it appears that the entire city of one million is gunning for the pinned down Rangers. And as with any mob, mindlessness is the rule. As the Americans battle their way out of Mogadishu none of the Somalis decides to engage them in an intellectual discussion.But in showing us the battle BLACK HAWK DOWN asks why, and the answers are not comforting for Americans, used, as we are to a global perspective. The lessons of Somalia seem self-defeating. Better a bloody violence than a peace with one's enemies. Better a tinhorn tribal warlord than a paternalistic U.N. delivering food and medicine. Better the clan and tribe than the nation and the world. Better to die than to tolerate one's enemies.Somalia today is a failed state, broken into innumerable tribal territories. It is a fate which even the best-intentioned action could not have avoided.

497766,A3GYVMUS7SSDFW,B00000F3KL,Kyle Tolle,"[5, 6]","To start off with, before or after seeing the movie, reading the book would be a huge plus because the book is incredibly good.  It may well fill in any gaps or questions that were not addressed in the movie.  Seeing the movie after reading the book, It was very apparent that the movie followed the book very closely and was excellently done.The movie does not delve into the politics of the U.S. in Somalia but it does give an introductory, although short, explanation why we were there and what we were trying to accomplish.  Some reviewers have stated that we shouldn't have been there in the first place.  Let's take a look - it was reported that 300,000 Somalian citizens had starved to death because their emergency food supplies (flown in by the U.S.) were taken away by Somalian warlords.  The Somalian militias then attacked U.N. peacekeeping forces and rendered them just about useless.  The United States was about the only nation left to go and render aid and assistance because no one else was going to do it.  We had honest and just reasons to try to shut down the warlords and help a country that was harboring genocidal killers that were perpetrating vicious crimes against humanity.Being in the military myself for 14 years now, I can relate to what goes through a soldiers mind and why we in the military are asked to do certain things that the average citizens of our country cannot always relate to.  It's not easy to explain, but we in the military are very proud and rely on honor, integrity, teamwork, and pride.  We work very hard to protect our country, other countries, and those in the world who cannot protect themselves and who need our help.  This is just one of the reasons that makes America great.In October of 1993, some 100 or so U.S. Military Forces comprised of the Army Rangers, Delta Force, and the Special Operations Aviation Regiment (S.O.A.R.) were tasked to extricate two key individuals in the warlord clan led by Mohammed Aidid to help stop the crimes against the Somalian people.  This extrication was to take place in an extremely hostile area in the middle of the city of Mogadishu in broad daylight.  According to initial planning, it was to be a 30 to 35 minute operation which ended up playing out to be a horrifying 16 to 18 hour ordeal.  The reality at the onset was looking to be successful until two Blackhawk type helicopters were shot down using rocket propelled grenades (RPG's).The U.S. soldiers were immediately thrown into an environment of total chaos being that the Somalian militias were very heavily armed and attacked from every section of the city.  Adding to the misery was that hundreds, if not thousands of Somalian citizens had weapons also and relentlessly attacked our soldiers for hours on end without hesitation.  The U.S. soldiers, taking many disastrous casualties and injuries of their own, secured both helicopter crash scenes, fought all the way through with almost unheard of courage and determination, brought all of their wounded and dead out that they could, and showed more bravery and resolve than could ever be asked of anyone.Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer have long been involved in movies of non-stop action and heart pounding excitement.  I don't see this movie as so much an action movie but compare it more to a documentary and an entirely realistic vision of what actually happened on that fateful day.  I believe that the movie was exceptionally well made and showed exactly what needed to be showed.  This was not a movie to be a forum for the politics of why we were there.  The movie states why we were there and how the military was intimately involved.  If there is anyone who questions our military or how good they really are or what sacrifices we have made in history for our country and other countries, this movie is indicative of why our country is the greatest with the greatest military.  This is probably one of the 10 best war films ever made and I think it is important for U.S. citizens to really know what happened that day in Somalia to get a clear picture.I couldn't give this review 5 stars because of the poor content of the DVD release.  There are trailers for 2 movies but neither are for Black Hawk Down.  Not good.  There is no directors commentary and no worthwhile featurettes.  Why?  In the age of digital sound and video, we are seeing much more of DTS sound on large amounts of DVD releases.  The 5.1 Dolby surround on this movie was excellent but DTS would have been sensational and they should have considered this when making the DVD.  I have a reasonably good suspicion that they will re-release this DVD with a load of extra's in the future and possibly DTS sound.  It may be worth the wait.If you like war movies, especially those that are based on true events and very accurate, you will probably find Black Hawk Down to your liking.  A small word of warning though.  This movie depicts very graphic scenes of injuries and carnage and death.  But, that is precisely how it should have been done so that the viewer can relate to what actually happened.  I hope most of you will be able to appreciate this movie as much as I did.",4,A riveting look at present day warfare,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,5165,"['start', 'off', 'seeing', 'movie', 'reading',

A horrified international United Nation force led by the US went in to distribute food and aid, but instead found themselves in the midst of a rabid, hate-fueled conflict between rival warlords.In an attempt to squelch the fiercest and bloodiest of them, US special forces staged a bold daylight raid on the warlord's headquarters. The goal was to capture two of the warlord's lieutenants in an effort to tighten the noose around him.However, what was to have been a 40-minute surgical strike into the heart of the warlord's stronghold in Mogadishu went tragically wrong, almost from the start.Botched communications, mishandled situations, untrustworthly local intelligence, and lukewarm support from alleged allies all contribute to the horrific result:Two Black Hawk Helicopters crash in the middle of hostile Mogadishu, and the few dozen ground troops left there find themselves surrounded by armed citizens who are storming down the streets by the hundreds, eager to kill US troops.The resulting firefight saw Americans in the bloodiest combat since the Vietnam war. Instead of 40 minutes, the fighting lasted a harrowing 22 hours.We are spared nothing.There is no unqualified happy ending here, no phony romance as inPearl Harbor to blunt the simple horror of bullet hitting bone.This movie is NOT for children.The violence is incredibly graphic, yet appears quite realistic, not over-blown.We see how the best and the worst of people emerges in times of crisis, and how heros are sometimes people who just hand in there and keep doing their jobs. Although some of the events will bring tears to your eyes and ball up your fists, it isn't a depressing movie at all.If you don't already know the ending, (This IS a true story) I won't spoil it for you, but I kindly offer this advice: Get your beverages, snacks, walk the dog, turn on the phone message machine, and take a bathroom break before you pop in this DVD.After it starts, you aren't going to want to stop watching until the end.",4,"Good intentions land soldiers in hell in ""Black Hawk Down""",1031097600,"09 4, 2002",2002,2582,"['best', 'equipped', 'military', 'world', 'not', 'supposed', 'end', 'up', 'soldiers', 'being', 'attacked', 'angry', 'mob', 'broad', 'daylight.Yet', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'October', '1993', 'United', 'States', 'military', 'special', 'forces', 'stationed', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia.That', 'day', 'hell', 'erupted', 'suddenness', 'machine', 'guns', 'fired', 'crowd', 'starving', 'Somalians', 'who', 'had', 'lined', 'up', 'bags', 'food.The', 'road', 'particular', 'hell', 'had', 'been', 'paved', 'best', 'intentions.Hundreds', 'thousands', 'Somalis', 'had', 'been', 'starving', 'death', 'systematic', 'strategy', 'warlords', 'determined', 'take', 'over', 'horrified', 'international', 'United', 'Nation', 'force', 'led', 'US', 'went', 'distribute', 'food', 'aid', 'instead', 'found', 'midst', 'rabid', 'hate-fueled', 'conflict', 'rival', 'warlords.In', 'attempt', 'squelch', 'fiercest', 'bloodiest', 'special', 'forces', 'staged', 'bold', 'daylight', 'raid', 'warlord', 'headquarters', 'goal', 'was', 'capture', 'two', 'warlord', 'lieutenants', 'effort', 'tighten', 'noose', 'him.However', 'what', 'was', 'have', 'been', '40-minute', 'surgical', 'strike', 'heart', 'warlord', 'stronghold', 'Mogadishu', 'went', 'tragically', 'wrong', 'almost', 'start.Botched', 'communications', 'mishandled', 'situations', 'untrustworthly', 'local', 'intelligence', 'lukewarm', 'support', 'alleged', 'allies', 'contribute', 'horrific', 'result', 'Two', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Helicopters', 'crash', 'middle', 'hostile', 'Mogadishu', 'few', 'dozen', 'ground', 'left', 'find', 'surrounded', 'armed', 'citizens', 'who', 'are', 'storming', 'down', 'streets', 'hundreds', 'eager', 'kill', 'US', 'resulting', 'firefight', 'saw', 'Americans', 'bloodiest', 'combat', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Instead', '40', 'minutes', 'fighting', 'lasted', 'harrowing', '22', 'hours.We', 'are', 'spared', 'nothing.There', 'unqualified', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'phony', 'romance', 'inPearl', 'Harbor', 'blunt', 'simple', 'horror', 'bullet', 'hitting', 'bone.This', 'movie', 'NOT', 'children.The', 'violence', 'incredibly', 'graphic', 'yet', 'quite', 'realistic', 'not', 'over-blown.We', 'see', 'how', 'best', 'worst', 'people', 'emerges', 'times', 'crisis', 'how', 'heros', 'are', 'sometimes', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'hand', 'keep', 'doing', 'jobs', 'events', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'ball', 'up', 'fists', ""n't"", 'depressing', 'movie', 'all.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'ending', 'true', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'kindly', 'offer', 'advice', 'Get', 'beverages', 'snacks', 'walk', 'dog', 'turn', 'phone', 'message', 'machine', 'take', 'bathroom', 'break', 'pop', 'DVD.After', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'end']",N/A

Der,"[6, 8]","I rate BLACK HAWK DOWN only below BAND OF BROTHERS as the best war dvd available (I don't include SAVING PRIVATE RYAN because of the Hollywoodized, heavy-handed ending) for its accurate and graphic portrayal of combat.I have the 3-disc Deluxe edition, which I recommend over the 1-disc because it includes the History Channel's THE TRUE STORY OF ""BLACK HAWK DOWN"" and PBS' FRONTLINE: AMBUSH IN MOGADISHU. The tv versions give more information on the political situation which led to the battle (which are only briefly mentioned in the movie) and provide more accurate accounts of the battle (the movie had to change some details in order to fit the entire battle into the given time, make it easier for the movie audience to understand and dramatize certain events). The 3-disc set also includes features showing the enormous amounts of computer-generated special effects which are so realistic that I was unaware they were CGI (the first Black Hawk helicopter crashing is entirely CGI, the dust clouds during the helicopter landings are CGI, many of the explosions, etc. are also CGI).In response to some earlier reviews, here's some clarifications:1. In the movie, Pvt. Blackburn is shown falling from the helicopter rope after the helicopter suddenly swerves to avoid a rocket-propelled grenade. This is a dramatized version--the dvd commentary by the real Sgt. Eversmann said there's no real explanation for why Blackburn fell from the rope as Blackburn doesn't remember although everyone remembers the helicopter did suddenly jerk, but not to avoid a RPG.2. Col. McKnight (Tom Sizemore) actually did walk upright during combat despite the constant Somali gunfire. This is mentioned in the book and the dvd commentary.For the very best in movie portrayal of combat and war, I highly recommend this dvd set.",5,Review: Deluxe Edition 3-disc set,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,1810,"['rate', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'only', 'BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'best', 'war', 'dvd', 'available', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'Hollywoodized', 'heavy-handed', 'ending', 'accurate', 'graphic', 'portrayal', 'combat.I', 'have', '3-disc', 'Deluxe', 'edition', 'recommend', '1-disc', 'History', 'Channel', 'THE', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'PBS', 'FRONTLINE', 'AMBUSH', 'IN', 'MOGADISHU', 'tv', 'versions', 'give', 'more', 'information', 'political', 'situation', 'led', 'battle', 'are', 'only', 'briefly', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'provide', 'more', 'accurate', 'accounts', 'battle', 'movie', 'had', 'change', 'details', 'order', 'fit', 'entire', 'battle', 'given', 'time', 'make', 'easier', 'movie', 'audience', 'understand', 'dramatize', 'certain', 'events', '3-disc', 'set', 'also', 'features', 'showing', 'enormous', 'amounts', 'computer-generated', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'was', 'unaware', 'were', 'CGI', 'first', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopter', 'crashing', 'entirely', 'CGI', 'dust', 'clouds', 'helicopter', 'landings', 'are', 'CGI', 'many', 'explosions', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'CGI', '.In', 'response', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'here', 'clarifications:1', 'movie', 'Pvt', 'Blackburn', 'shown', 'falling', 'helicopter', 'rope', 'helicopter', 'suddenly', 'avoid', 'rocket-propelled', 'grenade', 'dramatized', 'version', 'dvd', 'commentary', 'real', 'Sgt', 'Eversmann', 'said', 'real', 'explanation', 'why', 'Blackburn', 'fell', 'rope', 'Blackburn', ""n't"", 'remember', 'everyone', 'helicopter', 'did', 'suddenly', 'jerk', 'not', 'avoid', 'RPG.2', 'Col.', 'McKnight', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'actually', 'did', 'walk', 'upright', 'combat', 'constant', 'Somali', 'gunfire', 'mentioned', 'book', 'dvd', 'very', 'best', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'combat', 'war', 'highly', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'set']",N/A

Imagine the beginning of Saving Private Ryan, where they land on Omaha Beach, now imagine it lasting for two hours.  This is the best way to describe Black Hawk Down.The events of the story, which are sketchy in the film, are based on actual events that occured in Somalia when a sting opperation by U.S. Rangers went extremely wrong.  To be honest, the events are not important.  Apparently the filmmakers agreed, there is very little development of the sory or the characters leading up to the action.  This can be confusing at times, but I think it also serves the film.  The question could be raised in general, what were we doing there?  The film opens with some shocking images of the face of war, innocent victims, but this gets sort of lost.  Despite it's weaknesses Black Hawk Down is a powerful film. It is a film about battle.  And man is it amazing.  I could try to describe it, but no words can do Ridley Scott's team justice.  It must be seen....  There are a lot of characters in this film and often it is difficult to tell who's who, but that is the point.  There is another scene in the film in which Tom Sizemore's character radios in a message to Sam Shepard, the general, that a dead pilot is wedged in the wreckage of his chopper.  ""No one gets left behind,"" says Shepard despite the fact the men are still taking fire from gorilla gunmen. In war it doesn't matter which guy is which, they are all the same guy.

497773,A2O91YORQH16L5,B00000F3KL,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[2, 4]","Last week, including the weekend, I watched three great war action movies on television, namely:1) 'Black Hawk Down', starring Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana;2) 'Behind Enemy Lines', starring Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman;3) 'Tears of the Sun', starring Bruce Willis, Monica Bellucci, Tom Skerritt;The first movie was based on an actual event that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia on the African continent in October 1993 during the Clinton presidency.The second movie was apparently a fictional adaptation of an actual event that supposedly took place during the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.The third movie was more of a fictional account that had the starvation-ravaged Nigeria caught in an ethnic civil war as a background setting.In the war action movie, 'Black Hawk Down', directed by Ridley Scott (behind 'Gladiator', 'Blake Runner'), an elite team of some hundred US Army Rangers & Delta Force operatives were dropped deep into the capital city of Somalia, Mogadishu one day in October 1993.It was the stronghold of the powerful warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid, who had been hijacking International Red Cross food shipments at the ports with the intention to used them as bargaining chips with the United Nations.The mission was to capture two top lieutenants of the warlord.It was perceived as a quick straight-forward extraction, 30 minutes the most, but it turned out to be a 18-hour nightmarish ordeal for the US soldiers on the ground.Probably due to poor intelligence, they soon found themselves separated on the ground - & outnumbered - in a desperate street corner battle with a large group of heavily-armed Somali gunmen, following the early unexpected destruction of two of their Black Hawk rescue helicopters.For the next 90 minutes or so, the entire movie then traced the heroic efforts by other fellow army rangers to rescue their comrades (Well, they certainly lived up to their military creed 'Leave No Man Behind'), starting with Sgt. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), commanding one unit named Chalk IV & leading his men to the first Black Hawk crash site...to Warrant Officer Durant (Ron Eldard), who was the only survivor of the second Black Hawk crash site & who was captured by Somali gunmen...to the gung-ho Lt. Col. McKnight (Tom Sizemore) who led a rescue convoy only to get lost in an unforgiving city...to Sgt. Sanderson (William Fichner) who was desperately trying to reach the first Black Hawk crash site...to Staff Sgt. Yurek (Tom Guiry) who led two fellow Rangers, Nelson (Ewen Bremmer) & Twanbly (Tom Hardy) to meet up with their squad, Chalk IV, at the first Black Hawk crash site.With all the bullets whizzing past & explosive sounds of gunfire, & of course, empty shells with blood splattering all over the bodies as well as places, the movie was quite confusing at first, as it was difficult to track who was who, although the soldiers' names were tagged to their individual helmets.The gritty realism of the movie really put me into the middle of hellish horror faced by all the young US solders.There were chilling moments, for example:[When Warrant Officer Durant was captured & brought for interrogation]Durrant: ""My government will never negotiate for me.""Interrogator: ""Then perhaps you & I can negotiate, huh? Soldier to soldier.""Durant: ""I am not in charge.""Interrogator: ""Course not, you have the power to kill, but not negotiate. In Somalia, killing is negotiation.""The following further comment by the interrogator really exposed the harsh reality of the situation:""Do you think if you get General Aidid, we will simply put down our weapons & adopt American democracy? That the killing will stop? We know this, without victory, there will be no peace. There will always be killing, see? This is how things are in our world.""There were also some comic moments. For example:[During a cross fire near the Black Hawk crash site.]Grimes: ""Why aren't you shooting?""Waddell: ""We're not being shot at yet.""Grimes: ""How can you tell?""Waddell: ""A hiss means it's close. A snap means...""[A bullet whizzed past, pretty close.]Waddell: ""Now, they're shooting at us!""[They began returning fire.]For me, this intense movie certainly captured the emotional fears, raw courage & selfless heroism of the US soldiers against nearly insurmountable odds.At the end, nineteen of them perished, not counting probably the thousands of Somali people who also died in the cross fire.I enjoyed watching the movie, for the reasonably good acting, despite the fact that the movie did not centre on any single character, the pulsating action sequences, the comic as well as tearful moments, & the beautiful cinematography.I particularly like the dialogue towards the ending, when Sgt. Norm Hooten (Eric Bana) said to Sgt. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett):""When I go home, people will ask me, ""Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man? What, you some kind of a war junkie?"" You know what I'll say? I won't say a goddamn word. Why? They won't understand why we do it. They won't understand that it's about the men next to you, & that's all it is.""What a profound response from a true soldier as well as a good human being.The final scene through the film credits was also very poignant, as I watched nineteen coffins slowly being loaded on to a 130-Hercules transport, with the loading ramp slowly closing.I believe the opening quote from Plato at the movie's beginning, ""Only the dead have seen an end to war,"" truly reflects my emotional sentiments about the movie.According to history, it was the Malaysian and Pakistani contingents based in Somalia under the United Nations command that actually made the final rescue & eventually escorted the surviving US Army rangers & Delta Force operatives out of harm's way.[In that final scene, it was quite funny, & scary at the same time too, to watch the surviving US soldiers, seemingly exhausted, having to run on foot, & obviously unprotected, behind the escort convoy, with a ragtag group of Somali gunmen on pick-up trucks chasing them.]This vital part of history was apparently downplayed in the movie. I guess that's Hollywood's prerogative.My end analysis: this is one hell of a good war action movie to watch!To sum up all the three war action movies in the foregoing posts, I want to take this opportunity to share with readers a dedication statement I had learned - & remembered - since my secondary school days. It came from Sir Winston Churchill, the wartime British Prime Minister:""Never in the field of human conflict, have so many owed so much to so few.""So, dear readers, please go & watch the three foregoing war action movies. You will be delighted.",5,One hell of a good war action movie!,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,6612,"['Last', 'week', 'including', 'weekend', 'watched', 'three', 'great', 'war', 'action', 'movies',

497776,ASSKHS3FV3J0H,B00000F3KL,"Lillian Patterson ""Post-Postmodern Angster""","[5, 5]","Black Hawk Down is a difficult movie to watch. That's my profound statement of the century.From the first few minutes, you see that the director is trying to get us to focus on the atrocities that are being committed--the 300,000 people who have died--that's the reason for this mission. It helps to give some perspective.I've heard a lot of criticism for the fact that every soldier looks the same in this movie. They really do seem to blend together, it's hard to distinguish one from the other. I noticed that, but it didn't bother me...actually, it made me think. We, the moviegoers on the outside, can't really tell them apart...but they can. The men who are fighting together knew everyone's name--we're the ones on the outside, peeking into their world, trying to understand what they're doing. It was refreshing to me that this movie didn't feature face shots of the ""heroes"" with dramatic music playing in the background. I suspect that if we were able to watch the actual battle while it was going on, it would be hard to tell the men apart. This wasn't a weakness of the movie, it was a strength. It made things seem real.Another problem that people see with the movie is that there is so little character development. I've been watching war movies all my life,and so I know what they're talking about. Gone are the long, dramatic dialogues between the characters where they tell each other their life stories. I got a sense that these men knew each other--and their interaction together in the first thirty minutes of this movie doesn't seem like it's contrived to make me feel connected to the characters...and for that very reason, I DID feel connected to them. They didn't seem like movie characters. They seemed real. What you see in the first thirty minutes or so is men eating together, talking about the little things people talk about, preparing to go out and do what they came here to do--capture some men on a mission that's supposed to take an hour. That's why the events that follow hit so hard--there's a real sense of seeing real people thrown into the middle of chaos and insanity, because you've already convinced yourself that these people are real.I've heard that the explosions are too big, that they're unrealistic. Ok. They might be. I suspect the director had a desire to make this movie visually stunning. But what I noticed was that during every explosion, you can see people RIGHT THERE--and so you never lose sight of the fact that the explosions aren't the central focus here--it's the men fighting for their lives.Some have said that this movie wasn't historically accurate. The events didn't occur as portrayed in the movie. Well, as I said before, I'm a movie geek. And so I'm used to this. No movie can be really accurate, because you're trying to recreate events. There were no cameras there in real life--so the very medium of film fictionalizes events. Even if the men who originally went on this mission were to reinact it, it wouldn't be accurate to the way it was back when it first happened. You can't recapture events that way. The best you can do is get some actors together, work until you've got little details down (and I've heard that it's very accurate in that way, right down to the hand signals used) and then try to do the best you can to make it seem real. And they've done this. I've seen forty-year-old men sitting next to me bawling during this movie. It hits, and it hits hard. If it's not what actually happened at that time, then it sure looks like something that could really happen--because it looks real.There's a line in the film where one of the soldiers says, ""People don't understand...it's all about the man next to you. that'sit."" Yeah, you're right. I don't understand. I suspect that I'm not alone. But I've heard that Jesus said, ""Greater love has no man than this: that he lay down his life for his friends"" and it was powerful to see people putting that into practice.Finally, there's a line where a soldier is dying, and he says ""tell my parents"" and here I'm going, ""Tell my mom I love her!"" I've heard it a million times before. Even if it's something that people actually say, it's so contrived that I feel unmoved by it now. But he said, ""Tell my parents that I fought hard today. Tell them I fought well."" There are things I will never understand. I don't know what I feel so strongly about that I would be willing to die for it, but this guy believed in this mission. the most important thing to him was for his parents to know that he fought well. I know that it'sa just something a character in a movie said, but it really made me think...regardless of how I feel, I have to respect that someone could feel so strongly aboiut their country that they are willing to die fighting...that's powerful. And the fact that even when the soldiers were dead, they still sent others in to rescue them. They really meant it when they said, ""Leave no man behind.""No joke, no kidding, no exaggeration: This movie changed my life. There are some things that I will never see the same way again. And for that, I have to respect this movie. After all, it's not often that you can say such a thing, is it?",5,"""Black Hawk Down"" is a very difficult movie to watch",1023580800,"06 9, 2002",2002,5177,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'difficult',

497778,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00000F3KL,Linda Linguvic,"[13, 13]","It happened in 1993, just a few short years ago. The United States sent troops to Somalia on a humanitarian mission because the people were starving. But something went wrong.  There was bloodshed.  American troops were killed.  What happened?  What went wrong?  It was all very confusing.This film, based on the book by journalist Mark Bowden is an account of the operation in which American soldiers were sent to the heart of the city of Mogadishu to capture two top officials of the ruling renegade warlord who were preventing fair food distribution.  It was supposed to take a mere half hour.  Instead it turned into a nightmare as one of their special helicopters, referred to as a ""Black Hawk"" was shot down.Within minutes the audience is plunged into that nightmare and the tension keeps up for almost the entire film.  Director Ridley Scott does a masterful job; I felt I was right there with the men, dodging bullets and caring for the wounded as a hostile mob of fully armed Somalians kept attacking.  There were no name stars among the actors and, with one exception, they were all white young men in uniforms, and so it was easy to get them confused, especially since there was little, if any, back story.  It was the battle itself that was the star of this film.  The violence was strong and unrelenting, and there was no time for either the men or the audience to catch a breath before the next horrible thing happened.  Special effects were awesome as the moment-by-moment action just kept going on and on.There might have been no one central character to identify with, but that was not this film's intent.  It forced me instead, to identify with it all. And it certainly made me think about how a battle like this can take place in a distant part of the world without more than a few news blips here at home about what was really going on.One of the strengths of the film is that it doesn't preach.

As previosuly written in a review of Band of Brothers, Black Hawk Down is so much more honest and therefore, better than Saving Private Ryan because it is the truth.  There are no throwaway characters reflecting the moral quivering of should I fire my weapon that you had in the character Oppen in Saving Private Ryan. You have young men and older men being their human best in a situation totally unexpected.  You do not need some Oppen character and his cowardice to understand the terror that many of the men felt during the firefight that the movie conveys. The movie shows their fear and their dedication to their oath and fellow soldier.  Unlike the review in Slate.com, the book and the movie are not social commentaries on whether a war is just or not or how many blacks should constitute a unit, etc.  Do not view this movie for that, just as one would not watch (original or remake) Stalingrad for some social commentary on the [Jewish people].

It tells the tragic, true story of how a simple extraction mission became a mission to simply survive. In 1992, the U.S. and the United Nations wanted to stop the slaughter and starvation of the Somali population caught in the middle of a civil war.  The warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid, was stealing international food shipments intended to help the civilians.  An elite force of U.S. Rangers and Delta units were ordered to Somalia to capture two of Aidid's top men.  Black Hawk helicopters and ground forces were dispatched.But one well-aimed missile changed the nature of the operation, as a Black Hawk was downed in the middle of a hostile zone.  Josh Hartnett turns in an exceptional performance as Sgt. Matt Eversmann trying to hold his men together when all hope seems lost.Right from the somber DVD intro, you are helplessly drawn into another world.  The soundtrack, as lonely and exotic as the Somali desert and sea, helps to pull you in.  Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) has done a masterful job; at all times you are in the midst of the action with these soldiers.  Ken Nolan has written a tight screenplay.All the actors are tremendous.  Sam Shepard is the tough General Garrison, who has one of the most prophetic lines in the film: ""This isn't Iraq, it's much more complicated than that.""  This line has come back to bite us in the a**; I winced when I heard it.  Another timely line is delivered by a captured top man of Aidid: ""Do you really think if you get General Aidid, we will smply put down our weapons and adopt American democracy?  That the killing will stop?""Black Hawk is very long, almost three hours.  It seems longer, and is unbearable to watch in parts.  Extremely graphic gore had me screaming out loud.  It is very realistic, with military lingo from start to finish, adding to the authenticity.  For example, the Somali's are called ""Skinnies.""  There is a little humor in the beginning.One gets the feeling from hints during the film that these brave soldiers were screwed by eggheads in Washington who did not understand the situation in Somalia.  We can only hope and pray the situation in Iraq will not end the same way, in withdrawal and humiliation.",5,Riveting,1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,2256,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'tragic', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'simple', 'extraction', 'mission', 'became', 'mission', 'simply', 'survive', '1992', 'U.S.', 'United', 'Nations', 'wanted', 'stop', 'slaughter', 'starvation', 'Somali', 'population', 'caught', 'middle', 'civil', 'war', 'warlord', 'Mohammed', 'Farrah', 'Aidid', 'was', 'stealing', 'international', 'food', 'shipments', 'intended', 'help', 'civilians', 'elite', 'force', 'U.S.', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'units', 'were', 'ordered', 'Somalia', 'capture', 'two', 'Aidid', 'top', 'men', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopters', 'ground', 'forces', 'were', 'dispatched.But', 'one', 'well-aimed', 'missile', 'changed', 'nature', 'operation', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'was', 'downed', 'middle', 'hostile', 'zone', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'Sgt', 'Matt', 'Eversmann', 'trying', 'hold', 'men', 'together', 'when', 'hope', 'lost.Right', 'somber', 'DVD', 'intro', 'are', 'helplessly', 'drawn', 'world', 'soundtrack', 'lonely', 'exotic', 'Somali', 'desert', 'sea', 'pull', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Alien', 'Gladiator', 'done', 'masterful', 'job', 'times', 'are', 'midst', 'action', 'soldiers', 'Ken', 'Nolan', 'written', 'tight', 'screenplay.All', 'actors', 'are', 'tremendous', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'tough', 'General', 'Garrison', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'prophetic', 'lines', 'film', ""n't"", 'Iraq', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'line', 'come', 'back', 'bite', 'a**', 'winced', 'when', 'heard', 'timely', 'line', 'delivered', 'captured', 'top', 'man', 'Aidid', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'get', 'General', 'Aidid', 'will', 'smply', 'put', 'down', 'weapons', 'adopt', 'American', 'democracy', 'killing', 'will', 'stop', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'very', 'long', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'longer', 'unbearable', 'watch', 'parts', 'Extremely', 'graphic', 'gore', 'had', 'screaming', 'out', 'loud', 'very', 'realistic', 'military', 'lingo', 'start', 'finish', 'adding', 'authenticity', 'example', 'Somali', 'are', 'called', 'Skinnies', 'little', 'humor', 'beginning.One', 'feeling', 'hints', 'film', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'were', 'screwed', 'eggheads', 'Washington', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'situation', 'Somalia', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'pray', 'situation', 'Iraq', 'will', 'not', 'end', 'same', 'way', 'withdrawal', 'humiliation']",N/A

497785,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00000F3KL,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[9, 9]","after seeing ""Black Hawk Down"" to review it.  The film is too different, too out of step with most feature films, to deal with it on a reactionary basis.  You have to spend a lot of time thinking about what it was that made this movie stand out in your mind.  And so, the review of BHD becomes the 100th review I've written for Amazon, and it is welcome for this honor because it is such a stand out in all the movies and DVD's I've seen and reviewed in past months.Ridley Scott does something in this film that probably no other director has succeeded in (although ""Schindler's List"" came close).  He has written a documentary about the horrors of war, in feature length, and succeeded in bringing it to the big screen as a ""feature film"".  I guess this is because he cast some well known performers for some of the ensemble, although everyone is really a bit player in this movie, except the battle itself. If you accept author Mark Bowden's tale as a true to life account of what transpired, then Scott has taken very few liberties with his portrayal, preserving the documentary nature of Bowden's stirring yet horrifying work. Thus, Scott showcases his extraordinary talent in a way that is different from many of his past successes, and because he does not fall prey to the inclusion of the meaningless love story or the heart-rending tale of a central hero's perspective, he succeeds brilliantly.Scott deserves the Academy Award for Best Director.  None of the others even come close.There are many reviewers that criticize the film for its lack of characterization, the violence, and the loss of the Somali perspective.  The tale is told much as it was lived, and the disappearance of individual character as the comradeship and teamwork (and troubleshooting of mistakes) that occurs in such a dangerous situation is more important than the individual perspective.  The violence is real - believe that war is hell, as much now as in the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan, also criticized for its violence.  You go to a real war movie not to inspire your patriotism, although that may be a byproduct, but to remember what our armed forces can face nearly everywhere in the world - senseless, brutal killing.The Somali perspective was puzzling, and I believe it was more thoroughly explained in the book, but was a necessary give-up for Scott to tell his tale in a reasonable length of time.  I read few books about war, because, never having been exposed to battle, and needing that visualization to understand the battle sequences, I often get bogged down in war tales.  I made up my mind to read Bowden's book, now that the visuals are so real in my mind; Bowden wrote an extraordinary account.  Scott's version still does not pale by comparison, one of the few times when a great work has been transferred to film in a non-judgmental,  way, without the politics of advertising, spending and casting getting in the way.I'm puzzled by the reaction to this movie; so many reviewers gave the film a low rating.  For me, this was exactly what I expect from the theater - you pay your money to see a movie whose theme you know and are interested in before you go to the theater; you don't just see films because others say they are great.  I think if you go into Black Hawk Down with the expectation that you will come away unsettled, shocked, saddened at the waste of human life brought on by world misunderstanding, that you will not be disappointed.",5,I waited a month....,1015372800,"03 6, 2002",2002,3459,"['seeing', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'review', 'film', 'too', 'different', 'too', 'step', 'most', 'feature', 'films', 'deal', 'reactionary', 'basis', 'have', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'thinking', 'what', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'so', 'review', 'BHD', '100th', 'review', ""'ve"", 'written', 'Amazon', 'welcome', 'honor', 'such', 'stand', 'out', 'movies', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviewed', 'past', 'months.Ridley', 'Scott', 'something', 'film', 'probably', 'other', 'director', 'succeeded', 'Schindler', 'List', 'came', 'close', 'written', 'documentary', 'horrors', 'war', 'feature', 'length', 'succeeded', 'bringing', 'big', 'screen', 'feature', 'film', 'guess', 'cast', 'well', 'known', 'performers', 'ensemble', 'everyone', 'really', 'bit', 'player', 'movie', 'battle', 'accept', 'author', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'tale', 'true', 'life', 'account', 'what', 'transpired', 'then', 'Scott', 'taken', 'very', 'few', 'liberties', 'portrayal', 'preserving', 'documentary', 'nature', 'Bowden', 'stirring', 'yet', 'horrifying', 'work', 'Thus', 'Scott', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'way', 'different', 'many', 'past', 'successes', 'not', 'fall', 'prey', 'inclusion', 'meaningless', 'love', 'story', 'heart-rending', 'tale', 'central', 'hero', 'perspective', 'brilliantly.Scott', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Director', 'None', 'others', 'even', 'come', 'close.There', 'are', 'many', 'reviewers', 'criticize', 'film', 'lack', 'characterization', 'violence', 'loss', 'Somali', 'perspective', 'tale', 'told', 'much', 'was', 'lived', 'disappearance', 'individual', 'character', 'comradeship', 'teamwork', 'troubleshooting', 'mistakes', 'such', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'more', 'important', 'individual', 'perspective', 'violence', 'real', 'believe', 'war', 'hell', 'much', 'now', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'also', 'criticized', 'violence', 'go', 'real', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'inspire', 'patriotism', 'may', 'be', 'byproduct', 'remember', 'what', 'armed', 'forces', 'can', 'face', 'nearly', 'everywhere', 'world', 'senseless', 'brutal', 'killing.The', 'Somali', 'perspective', 'was', 'puzzling', 'believe', 'was', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'explained', 'book', 'was', 'necessary', 'give-up', 'Scott', 'tell', 'tale', 'reasonable', 'length', 'time', 'read', 'few', 'books', 'war', 'never', 'having', 'been', 'exposed', 'battle', 'needing', 'visualization', 'understand', 'battle', 'sequences', 'often', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'war', 'tales', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'read', 'Bowden', 'book', 'now', 'visuals', 'are', 'so', 'real', 'mind', 'Bowden', 'wrote', 'extraordinary', 'account', 'Scott', 'version', 'still', 'not', 'pale', 'comparison', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'great', 'work', 'been', 'transferred', 'film', 'non-judgmental', 'way', 'politics', 'advertising', 'spending', 'casting', 'getting', 'way.I', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'reaction', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'film', 'low', 'rating', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'theater', 'pay', 'money', 'see', 'movie', 'theme', 'know', 'are', 'interested', 'go', 'theater', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'see', 'films', 'others', 'say', 'are', 'great', 'think', 'go', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'expectation', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'unsettled', 'shocked', 'saddened', 'waste', 'human', 'life', 'brought', 'world', 'misunderstanding', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

A word of Warning the violence in this movie is extremely graphic and prolonged and is not for the faint at heart.

497789,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00000F3KL,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[11, 12]","Black Hawk Down is the film adaptation of Mark Bowden's mesmerizing chronicle by the same name. It recounts a 1993 incident involving U.S. Special Forces in Somalia, a routine half-hour mission that turned into the longest sustained firefight involving U.S. forces since the Vietnam War. A mixed group of helicopter-borne Rangers, Delta Force, and a few SEALs, supported by air cover and a convoy of ground vehicles, converged on a busy marketplace in downtown Mogadishu in a lightning raid to capture two top lieutenants of renegade warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. The raiders were blindsided when literally thousands of Somali fighters emerged from the surrounding neighborhoods with machine guns, rockets, and other sophisticated weapons. Two blackhawk helicopters were quickly downed by rocket-propelled grenades, the ground convoy got battered and lost its way repeatedly trying to rescue the downed crews, and the entire force on foot found itself under seige until it was finally rescued the following morning. The casualties included 73 U.S. fighters wounded and 19 killed, as well as 500-1000 Somalis dead.Black Hawk Down has by and large received excellent reviews, and it deserves them. For one thing, the film balances a lot of difficult things well. It memorializes the heroism of the American fighters without glamorizing their struggle; it captures the savagery and squalor of the fight in paradoxically beautiful cinematography; and it conveys the confusion and complexity of the battle while making it (mostly) apprehensible. A note about that last point: it's still a good idea to read the book before seeing the movie if you have the luxury of doing so. Before it was over, the battle sprawled over much of central Mogadishu - a large city - and encompassed several different groups of men in different sites. Director Ridley Scott does an admirable job of making sense of it all, but it will still be clearer if you read about it in stupendous (but fascinating) detail in Bowden's account.Having said the foregoing, let me warn you that this is not a movie for everyone - far from it. Black Hawk Down is an exceptionally violent film. Not grauitously so: the violence is entirely in keeping with the truth of the event, and supports the themes of the film. But it's not easy to watch, all the same. One scene involving battlefield surgery, especially, is probably a good opportunity for the squeamish to hit the concession stand for a while.With material like this, the ideal of character development and strong individual performances goes somewhat by the wayside. There are necessarily too many faces, and too many events going on, for the film to linger for any length of time on one individual. (If you want character development, check out A Beautiful Mind.) Still, the performances here are quite good given their limited parameters. Josh Hartnett comes fully into his own as the leader of a Ranger squad (a ""chalk"") who fights to keep his team focused on survival. Among the other performances, I liked William Fichtner as a Delta Force sergeant who takes initiative at a critical moment in the fight. You may know Fichtner from ensemble parts in other movies, such as The Perfect Storm, where he played the edgy outsider Sully.As a film and as a historical document, Black Hawk Down definitely deserves your attention.",4,A Cautionary Tale,1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,3344,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'mesmerizing', 'chronicle', 'same', 'name', '1993', 'incident', 'involving', 'U.S.', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Somalia', 'routine', 'half-hour', 'mission', 'turned', 'longest', 'sustained', 'firefight', 'involving', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'A', 'mixed', 'group', 'helicopter-borne', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'few', 'SEALs', 'supported', 'air', 'cover', 'convoy', 'ground', 'vehicles', 'converged', 'busy', 'marketplace', 'downtown', 'Mogadishu', 'lightning', 'raid', 'capture', 'two', 'top', 'lieutenants', 'renegade', 'warlord', 'Mohammed', 'Farah', 'Aidid', 'raiders', 'were', 'blindsided', 'when', 'literally', 'thousands', 'Somali', 'fighters', 'emerged', 'surrounding', 'neighborhoods', 'machine', 'guns', 'rockets', 'other', 'sophisticated', 'weapons', 'Two', 'blackhawk', 'helicopters', 'were', 'quickly', 'downed', 'rocket-propelled', 'grenades', 'ground', 'convoy', 'got', 'battered', 'lost', 'way', 'repeatedly', 'trying', 'rescue', 'downed', 'crews', 'entire', 'force', 'foot', 'found', 'seige', 'was', 'finally', 'rescued', 'following', 'morning', 'casualties', 'included', '73', 'U.S.', 'fighters', 'wounded', '19', 'killed', 'as', 'well', '500-1000', 'Somalis', 'dead.Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'large', 'received', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'lot', 'difficult', 'things', 'well', 'heroism', 'American', 'fighters', 'glamorizing', 'struggle', 'savagery', 'squalor', 'fight', 'paradoxically', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'confusion', 'complexity', 'battle', 'making', 'mostly', 'apprehensible', 'note', 'last', 'point', 'still', 'good', 'idea', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'luxury', 'doing', 'so', 'was', 'over', 'battle', 'sprawled', 'over', 'much', 'central', 'Mogadishu', 'large', 'city', 'encompassed', 'several', 'different', 'groups', 'men', 'different', 'sites', 'Director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'admirable', 'job', 'making', 'sense', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'clearer', 'read', 'stupendous', 'fascinating', 'detail', 'Bowden', 'account.Having', 'said', 'foregoing', 'let', 'warn', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'far', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'exceptionally', 'violent', 'film', 'Not', 'grauitously', 'so', 'violence', 'entirely', 'keeping', 'truth', 'event', 'themes', 'film', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'same', 'One', 'scene', 'involving', 'battlefield', 'surgery', 'especially', 'probably', 'good', 'opportunity', 'squeamish', 'hit', 'concession', 'stand', 'while.With', 'material', 'ideal', 'character', 'development', 'strong', 'individual', 'performances', 'somewhat', 'wayside', 'are', 'necessarily', 'too', 'many', 'too', 'many', 'events', 'going', 'film', 'linger', 'length', 'time', 'one', 'individual', 'want', 'character', 'development', 'check', 'out', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Still', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'given', 'limited', 'parameters', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'fully', 'own', 'leader', 'Ranger', 'squad', 'chalk', 'who', 'fights', 'keep', 'team', 'focused', 'survival', 'other', 'performances', 'liked', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Delta', 'Force', 'sergeant', 'who', 'initiative', 'critical', 'moment', 'fight', 'may', 'know', 'Fichtner', 'ensemble', 'parts', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'where', 'played', 'edgy', 'outsider', 'Sully.As', 'film', 'historical', 'document', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'definitely', 'attention']",N/A

Needless to say, this speaks volumes over how much I love this film.  I'm not a particularly big fan of war films but this movie really hit an emotional chord with me and I consider it one of my favorite films ever.  It is a truly powerful film.However, this review isn't about the film itself.  Hundreds of people before me have already done that.  I am reviewing the DELUXE DVD version, which I must say was well worth the wait.If you are a fan of any of actors of this film, then the special features will be a major treat.  The main members of the cast (approx. 20 actors) - from Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Sam Shepard, Eric Bana and Jason Isaacs to up-and-comers Hugh Dancy, Matthew Marsden and Orlando Bloom get a major boost in this DVD.  The 2 1/2 hour ""Essence of Combat"" documentary alone is worth the price of the dvd.  It is packed with fabulous behind-the-scenes features, candid interviews and footage featuring the screenwriter (Ken Nolan), book author (Mark Bowden), director (Ridley Scott), special effects guys, composer (Hans Zimmer), military/technical consultants, cast members and even the actual soldiers who were involved in the mission.  There are approx. 9 deleted scenes, most of which were a shame to not have been included in the final film.  There are also photo galleries, loads of commentaries and many more!!!If you are a fan of the film itself or want to know more about the events surrounding the Somalian conflict, there are two excellent TV documentaries from PBS and the History channel that would do just that.I highly recommend this DELUXE DVD to fans of the film as well as fans of the actors involved.  It is a major treat to see your favorite actor go through the week long military training (orientation) at the Ranger/Delta/Pilot facilities, get their haircuts or just talk about their overall experience in the film.  Add to that an high quality transfer of this top-notch film and many other special features and you've got one of the best DVDs ever released.  Simply superb!",5,The DELUXE DVD version is SUPERB!!!

I kept thinking as I watched this movie how all our good intentions and high technology could not prevent this disaster from happening.  This film shook me in that regard; Ridley Scott depicts a fast, hopeless battle against a foe armed less with high-tech weapons than hate and courage.Mark Bowden's excellent book makes a good transition, but the necessary filmic needs of recognizable characters leaves us with little to hang on to; too many faces look alike, talk alike. Die alike. Some reviewers have called this war pornography, but there is too much pain, at least for me, to enjoy the violence.  This is not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  If this were War Porn, Ridley Scott would have shown the massive numbers of Somali dead and hideously wounded our forces caused.  The kill ratio was at least 10 to 1 or higher.This film also made me ask questions so I ended up reading the book, thus learning more than I intended. For me, at least, this makes Blackhawk Down worth seeing.By the way, this is a landmark historical film: For the first time actual videotapes of a battle in progress were availible for the filmmakers to use, creating a record of words and wounds, unlike say Saving Private Ryan, which is an unlikely concoction of wishful thinking and cgi.",4,Postmodern War Still Sucks,1027209600,"07 21, 2002",2002,1404,"['Blackhawk', 'Down', 'truly', 'jarring', 'film', 'more', 'jarring', 'other', 'contenders', 'field', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Enemy', 'Gates', 'kept', 'thinking', 'watched', 'movie', 'how', 'good', 'intentions', 'high', 'technology', 'could', 'not', 'prevent', 'disaster', 'happening', 'film', 'shook', 'regard', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'fast', 'hopeless', 'battle', 'foe', 'armed', 'less', 'high-tech', 'weapons', 'hate', 'courage.Mark', 'Bowden', 'excellent', 'book', 'good', 'transition', 'necessary', 'filmic', 'needs', 'recognizable', 'characters', 'little', 'hang', 'too', 'many', 'look', 'alike', 'talk', 'alike', 'Die', 'alike', 'reviewers', 'have', 'called', 'war', 'pornography', 'too', 'much', 'pain', 'least', 'enjoy', 'violence', 'not', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'were', 'War', 'Porn', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'would', 'have', 'shown', 'massive', 'numbers', 'Somali', 'dead', 'hideously', 'wounded', 'forces', 'caused', 'kill', 'ratio', 'was', 'least', '10', '1', 'higher.This', 'film', 'also', 'made', 'ask', 'questions', 'ended', 'up', 'reading', 'book', 'thus', 'learning', 'more', 'intended', 'least', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'worth', 'seeing.By', 'way', 'landmark', 'historical', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'actual', 'videotapes', 'battle', 'progress', 'were', 'availible', 'filmmakers', 'use', 'creating', 'record', 'words', 'wounds', 'say', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'unlikely', 'concoction', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'cgi']",N/A

497797,A1PFT63CY1EF3M,B00000F3KL,Mark Walters,"[7, 38]","First off, let me say that I have the highest respect for the men and women of the U.S. armed services.  What they do is sheer bravery and courage, so it disappoints me to see a film like Black Hawk Down.  From 2 of Hollywood's most overrated filmmakers (director Ridley Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer) comes this true life story of a botched operation in Mogadishu.  Over 1,000 Somalis (or ""skinnies"" as they are so affectionately referred to in the film) and 18 U.S. soldiers lost their lives after 2 black hawk helicopters were shot down in the midst of thousands of angry Somali militia members.About the only good thing this movie does is show in a not that graphic manner that war is indeed hell.  It makes you sympathize with the characters, not because you get to know them, but because it places you right in the middle of the fighting with them.  Indeed, there is ZERO character delevopment in this film.  I've seen better character development in 20 minute episodes of Justice League.  The only characters you care about are the actors you know and like.  Eric Bana (soon to be playing Dr. Bruce Banner) was pretty cool as an uncaring super soldier, and it was refreshing to see Richard Tyson (Cullen Crisp in Kindergarten Cop) in another role...even if he hardly said anything.Now I'm not gonna argue about the historical accuracy of the film.  One because from all I've read, the film pretty accurately portrays what actually happened.  And two, because I'm a film student, so I don't argue about what's accurate or not.  Films are made to be dramatic and should help the audience engage in a willing suspension of disbelief.  What Black Hawk Down did was leave the audience out of the whole process.  The film stumbles from the start with odd bits of expostion and loopy and cliche dialogue.  All you're meant to know is that all Somalis are bad.  Plain and simple.  Once the action kicks in (following the shots of the helicopters flying over the beach which was oddly familiar to the same scene in Predator), it's air ramps and blood packs for all!  In all seriousness, this film is not that graphic.  Sure, one guy's hand gets mangled, another man gets blown in half, and another soldier gets an RPG lodged in his abdomen, but because of Ridley Scott's flinching eye and cautious manner, hardly any of it is shown.  The rest of the violence (i.e. the machine gun and helicopter mini gun hits) look like your average Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sly Stallone violence.  It really detracts from the seriousness and overall dramatic impact of the film.  And because much of it is shot in slow motion (not for effect as in Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, or Three Kings, but simply because it looks cool), it makes it that much more unbelievable.In my opinion, this film is no better than Pearl Harbor.  You've got lots of pretty boy actors (none of whom you can tell apart, but not like you care who's who anyhow) running around acting like this is the greatest project they'll ever work on while serving up one campy line of dialogue after another.  But like Pearl Harbor, this film does inform those who did not know about the incident.  So at least it does some good.  I'm sure all of you in the armed services who read this will curse me, but like I said, I respect you.  I'm not arguing about the historical aspects of the film.  I'm arguing about the ""film"" aspects of the film.  Many reviews I've read complain about how all those who hate any war movie has never seen combat, and thus can't render an opinion.  To those people, I say read my review.  I offered up a disclaimer.  I'm all for making films based on actual incidents, like Black Hawk Down.  But while Black Hawk Down accurately portrayed a real tragedy, it ultimately failed as a film...Like Pearl Harbor (also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and also starring Josh Hartnett...strange).

497798,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00000F3KL,Martin Asiner,"[1, 3]","The presentation of war movies has over the decades changed from the early thirties and forties movies that focused on ethnic soldiers with clear personalities to more recent films which emphasize homogeneous soldiers who react collectively to a chaotic cauldron of gore.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN began the trend of dramatizing American GIs in mortal and graphic combat with an enemy that differed from them mostly in the color of uniform. BLACK HAWK DOWN continues the evolution of filming up-close combat against an enemy that is far less civilized than the Germans in 1944.Most critics of BLACK HAWK DOWN describe the situation that led to the storming of the hotel that was supposed to contain Somali warlord Aidid.  Director Jerry Bruckheimer faithfully records the tragic collapse of the mission that was to last no more than 30 minutes.  Instead, the hundred or so Rangers and Delta Force soldiers found themselves fighting thousands of heavily armed Somali supporters of Aidid.  The movie is replete with countless technical images of cinematic virtuosity that place the audience right there on the screen.  Yet, as I watched BLACK HAWK DOWN for the second time, I tried to look beyond the experiences and viewpoints of the American soldiers, no mean feat there, since their actions against the Somalis and interactions with each other carried the viewer in lockstep with them.  Instead, I paid attention to the native Somalis, most of whom formed a collective and faceless foe who reminded me of the way that the Japanese in World War II movies and the Vietnamese in the Vietnam conflict were portrayed.  The Somalis were divided into two distinct groups: those street level thug types who did the fighting and dying and the upper echelon leaders who are etched as corrupt and evil betrayers of their own.  Consider the parallel scenes of the American capture of a lower ranking Somali warlord at the beginning of the movie and the later capture of an American helicoptor pilot by hordes of crazed Somali militia.  The captured Somali warlord was treated with respect and accorded unusual good care by his American captors.  His response is to show his petty arrogance by blowing cigar smoke into the face of his interrogators.  The captured American pilot is right away clubbed and mistreated before being released eleven days later.  These twin scenes capture the film's subtext that the American concept of war and warmaking is not shared by the rest of the world.  Our world of war is the Geneva convention.  The rest of the world, as symbolized by the Somalis, is based on killing as negotiation.  Massive losses do not deter them from killing us.  Nineteen American deaths were quite sufficient for President Clinton to pull American forces out of Somalia.  BLACK HAWK DOWN, then, serves to remind us that traditional American concepts such as the value of the life of one individual are not shared by many other cultures, and that in our haste and anger to lash out we must not forget that the film's oft repeated motto 'Leave no one behind' is all that keeps our sanity when confronted by such nonstop atrocities as our boys found that one day in Mogadishu.",5,War is Chaotic: Our Reaction to It Must Not Be,1030752000,"08 31, 2002",2002,3170,"['presentation', 'war', 'movies', 'decades', 'changed', 'early', 'thirties', 'forties', 'movies', 'focused', 'ethnic', 'soldiers', 'clear', 'personalities', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'emphasize', 'homogeneous', 'soldiers', 'who', 'react', 'collectively', 'chaotic', 'cauldron', 'gore', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'began', 'trend', 'dramatizing', 'American', 'GIs', 'mortal', 'graphic', 'combat', 'enemy', 'differed', 'mostly', 'color', 'uniform', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'evolution', 'filming', 'up-close', 'combat', 'enemy', 'far', 'less', 'civilized', 'Germans', '1944.Most', 'critics', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'describe', 'situation', 'led', 'storming', 'hotel', 'was', 'supposed', 'contain', 'Somali', 'warlord', 'Aidid', 'Director', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'faithfully', 'tragic', 'collapse', 'mission', 'was', 'last', 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'Instead', 'hundred', 'so', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'soldiers', 'found', 'fighting', 'thousands', 'heavily', 'armed', 'Somali', 'supporters', 'Aidid', 'movie', 'replete', 'countless', 'technical', 'images', 'cinematic', 'virtuosity', 'place', 'audience', 'right', 'there', 'screen', 'Yet', 'watched', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'second', 'time', 'tried', 'look', 'experiences', 'viewpoints', 'American', 'soldiers', 'mean', 'feat', 'there', 'actions', 'Somalis', 'interactions', 'other', 'carried', 'viewer', 'lockstep', 'Instead', 'paid', 'attention', 'native', 'Somalis', 'most', 'whom', 'formed', 'collective', 'faceless', 'foe', 'who', 'reminded', 'way', 'Japanese', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movies', 'Vietnamese', 'Vietnam', 'conflict', 'were', 'portrayed', 'Somalis', 'were', 'divided', 'two', 'distinct', 'groups', 'street', 'level', 'thug', 'types', 'who', 'did', 'fighting', 'dying', 'upper', 'echelon', 'leaders', 'who', 'are', 'etched', 'corrupt', 'evil', 'betrayers', 'own', 'Consider', 'parallel', 'scenes', 'American', 'capture', 'lower', 'ranking', 'Somali', 'warlord', 'beginning', 'movie', 'later', 'capture', 'American', 'helicoptor', 'pilot', 'hordes', 'crazed', 'Somali', 'militia', 'captured', 'Somali', 'warlord', 'was', 'treated', 'respect', 'accorded', 'unusual', 'good', 'care', 'American', 'captors', 'response', 'show', 'petty', 'arrogance', 'blowing', 'cigar', 'smoke', 'face', 'interrogators', 'captured', 'American', 'pilot', 'right', 'away', 'clubbed', 'mistreated', 'being', 'released', 'eleven', 'days', 'later', 'twin', 'scenes', 'capture', 'film', 'subtext', 'American', 'concept', 'war', 'warmaking', 'not', 'shared', 'rest', 'world', 'world', 'war', 'Geneva', 'convention', 'rest', 'world', 'symbolized', 'Somalis', 'based', 'killing', 'negotiation', 'Massive', 'losses', 'do', 'not', 'deter', 'killing', 'Nineteen', 'American', 'deaths', 'were', 'quite', 'sufficient', 'President', 'Clinton', 'pull', 'American', 'forces', 'Somalia', 'BLACK', 'HAWK', 'DOWN', 'then', 'serves', 'remind', 'traditional', 'American', 'concepts', 'such', 'value', 'life', 'one', 'individual', 'are', 'not', 'shared', 'many', 'other', 'cultures', 'haste', 'anger', 'lash', 'out', 'must', 'not', 'forget', 'film', 'oft', 'repeated', 'motto', ""'Leave"", 'one', 'behind', 'sanity', 'when', 'confronted', 'such', 'nonstop', 'atrocities', 'boys', 'found', 'one', 'day', 'Mogadishu']",N/A

Mohamed Farah Aidid, the most powerful of the warlords, rules the capital of Mogadishu. He seizes international food shipments at the ports. Hunger is his weapon.The world responds. Behind a force of 20,000 U.S. Marines, food is delivered and order is restored.April 1993.Aidid waits until the Marines withdraw, and then declares war on the remaining U.N. peacekeepers. In June Aidid's militia ambush and slaughter 24 Pakistani soldiers, and begin targeting American personnel. In late August, America's elite soldiers, Delta Force, Army Rangers, and the 160th SOAR are sent to Mogadishu to remove Aidid and restore order. The mission was to take 3 weeks, but 6 weeks later Washington was growing impatient.Sunday, October 3rd 1993.After the American military receive an anonymous intell that some of Aidid's top officials and likely Aidid himself, are to have a meeting in a specific building in Mogadishu, the Delta Force and the Rangers are immediately ordered to prepare for a mission to take over the location and arrest the individuals. Several UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters are sent out to drop-off the soldiers with Delta Force executing the take-over of the building and the Rangers covering the perimeter. The Black Hawks are then to provide a cover from above while on-the-ground Humvee convoy is to pick-up the prisoners and extract the unit. The whole mission is to take no longer than 30 minutes. Everything goes according to plans until 2 of the Black Hawks are shot down and the Rangers and Delta head out to rescue the downed pilots. Surrounded by armed civilians, including women and children, and thousands of heavily-armed Somali militia, the soldiers quickly find themselves outnumbered and outgunned in a city gone mad.The mission that was to last no longer than 30 minutes, turned into a 16 hour life and death battle. The biggest and bloodiest battle since Vietnam. 19 American soldiers and over 1000 Somalis lost their lives.A true story re-created by an outstanding director, producer, and cast, Black Hawk Down is an extremely accurate and dramatic masterpiece, portraying the unbelievable courage and determination of the American soldiers and the sad but true inhumanity that takes place during times of war.

497802,A3EYQU2KQAPPYW,B00000F3KL,Matt Denison,"[1, 1]","Black Hawk DownThe sacrifices made in war are immeasurable. There are heroes that die fighting for the sake of our nation. ""Black Hawk Down"" is the latest Hollywood movie to re create a tragic event in the history of America. Based on the book by Mark Bowden, it tells a story so tragic that one cannot forget the consequences of war or it's aftermath. ""Black Hawk Down"" is a moving tribute to a day in which lives were lost in a mission that was to have been simply a routine capture of a known criminal. However the terror that awaited the soldiers sent on this mission was something that they would never forget. Directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien"") ""Black Hawk Down"" is the chilling look at war that a much bigger film like ""Pearl Harbor"" should have been. You won't find much sappiness in this picture. A star driven picture, ""Black Hawk Down"" is an extremely well made movie. The war scenes are spectacular and riveting. You really are glued to the screen. Taken from a true event that happened in 1993 the film dramatizes what happens when a military raid goes disastrously wrong and lives are lost. 18 Americans lost their lives with 70 or more wounded and within days, president Bill Clinton Pulled out the troops. At that time is said that at least 300,000 Somalis had died of starvation. The Somali warlords were interested in protecting their turf and not feeding their people. The film's main purpose is to accurately as possible tell the story as it happened and to whom it happened. The plan seemed simple. The American's would stage a surprise raid by helicopter-borne troops, joined on the ground by forces, meeting a warlord's top lieutenants.  Intelligence claimed that they discovered the time and location of a meeting of lieutenants of the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. They hired a taxi with a black cross on the roof and the driver to park next to the building where the meeting will take place. That way they can guide the airborne troops, who will come down on ropes and with the joint effort of ground forces surround the building and take prisoners. Trouble is that the enemy is much better equipped weapons wise and can call on reinforcements quickly also because they are better positioned. The mission was thought to be so straightforward that some troops left behind their canteens and night vision gear. They though they would return to base in mere hours. As we now know it didn't go as they planed. Enemy rockets took down two of the helicopters while the warlord's troops gathered quickly and surrounded the U.S. strongholds. Because of poor conditions and roadblocks a support convoy was prevented from approaching. No matter how much the American's gave the mission was still by all accounts a catastrophe. I wonder did the American's really think they were invincible?  To enjoy this movie we have to understand the people and their mission. The crew consists of Eversmann (Josh Hartnett, ""Pearl Harbor"") a staff sergeant in charge of one of the raids. He does a much better job here than he did in ""Pearl Harbor"". Grimes Ewan McGregor (""Moulin Rouge"") is a ranger specialist who possesses great coffee making skills. Sanderson (William Fichtner, ""Switch Back"") is the rebellious soldier who is trying to do what he thinks is right. Garrison (Sam Shepard, ""Country"") is the General running the ill-fated mission. The movie is not interested in who the big stars are but rather showcasing the people as the soldiers fighting for a cause that some understand or think is justified. Some say that thanks to the training they went through the soldiers were able to defend themselves when they were left hi and dry. It is been said that this episode showed the American's weakened resolve towards terrorism, which was a precursor to the tragic events of September 11. Whether or not that is true I cannot say, but I can say that this movie is a riveting reminder of a day that no one will forget.

497803,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00000F3KL,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","I have some questions about ""Black Hawk Down"", Ridley Scott's technical brilliant but oddly soulless movie. Would it have received as many glowing reviews if it had been released prior to the events of September 11 and our subsequent invasion of Afghanistan? Was the movie re-edited after these events in order to put the mission it depicts into a more favorable light? Does a war movie that skips over most of an event's historical context really teach us anything or have anything meaningful to say?In 1993, US troops were sent to the African nation of Somalia on a UN peacekeeping mission. The country was torn by civil war. The UN was also engaged in a massive food distribution mission, which was being disrupted by Somalia warlords. It was decided to arrest some of them. Intelligence sources pinpointed the targets in the city of Mogadishu. Leaders of our forces concluded that we could easily to send in Black Hawk helicopters with a few dozen troops aboard, grab the wanted men, and bring them back to our base at the local airport. The mission was expected to take about and hour. Many soldiers even left behind basic supplies like canteens and night vision goggles. We may never know if misinformation, bad leadership and/or bad luck caused the disaster that followed. What is known is that Somalis shot down two of the helicopters and that the ensuing battle raged for eighteen hours. Eighteen Americans and hundreds of Somalis were killed.""Black Hawk Down"" concentrates on the battle itself. There are nearly two hours of nonstop carnage. Not even ""Saving Private Ryan"" was as intense and graphic. As things go from confusing to utterly chaotic, Scott does a good job of arranging scenes so that the audience still knows what is going on. This is one of the movie's strongest points, since viewers are often confused as to what's going on in a war movie.Though based on real people, the characters are written as stock Hollywood types. Consequently, we feel for their dreadful predicament, but we don't feel for them as individuals. An hour after I saw the movie, I remembered few memorable details about any of them.It's understandable that many people think ""Black Hawk Down"" is a cinematic masterpiece. A lot of intelligent, gifted people worked very hard to make it succeed. Their craftsmanship is to be admired. The movie doesn't work for me, mainly due to that lack of historical perspective. The Somalis come off as a swirling, seething, murderous mob. Indeed, they may have been. But the movie misses greatness by completely ignoring one important of question: Why? The implication is that these people were essentially subhuman and incapable of appreciating the great saviors from the West. Trust me, there is a lot more to the story than that.",3,"""Full of sound and fury...""",1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,2766,"['have', 'questions', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'technical', 'brilliant', 'oddly', 'soulless', 'movie', 'Would', 'have', 'received', 'many', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'prior', 'events', 'September', '11', 'subsequent', 'invasion', 'Afghanistan', 'Was', 'movie', 're-edited', 'events', 'order', 'put', 'mission', 'more', 'favorable', 'light', 'war', 'movie', 'most', 'event', 'historical', 'context', 'really', 'teach', 'anything', 'have', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'say', '1993', 'US', 'troops', 'were', 'sent', 'African', 'nation', 'Somalia', 'UN', 'peacekeeping', 'mission', 'country', 'was', 'torn', 'civil', 'war', 'UN', 'was', 'also', 'engaged', 'massive', 'food', 'distribution', 'mission', 'was', 'being', 'disrupted', 'Somalia', 'warlords', 'was', 'decided', 'arrest', 'Intelligence', 'sources', 'pinpointed', 'targets', 'city', 'Mogadishu', 'Leaders', 'forces', 'concluded', 'could', 'easily', 'send', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopters', 'few', 'dozen', 'troops', 'aboard', 'grab', 'wanted', 'men', 'bring', 'back', 'base', 'local', 'airport', 'mission', 'was', 'expected', 'take', 'hour', 'Many', 'soldiers', 'even', 'left', 'behind', 'basic', 'supplies', 'canteens', 'night', 'vision', 'goggles', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'misinformation', 'bad', 'leadership', 'bad', 'luck', 'caused', 'disaster', 'followed', 'What', 'known', 'Somalis', 'shot', 'down', 'two', 'helicopters', 'ensuing', 'battle', 'raged', 'eighteen', 'hours', 'Eighteen', 'Americans', 'hundreds', 'Somalis', 'were', 'killed', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'battle', 'are', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'nonstop', 'carnage', 'Not', 'even', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'was', 'intense', 'graphic', 'things', 'go', 'confusing', 'utterly', 'chaotic', 'Scott', 'good', 'job', 'arranging', 'scenes', 'so', 'audience', 'still', 'what', 'going', 'one', 'movie', 'strongest', 'points', 'viewers', 'are', 'often', 'confused', 'what', 'going', 'war', 'movie.Though', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'stock', 'Hollywood', 'types', 'Consequently', 'feel', 'dreadful', 'predicament', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'individuals', 'hour', 'saw', 'movie', 'remembered', 'few', 'memorable', 'details', 'them.It', 'understandable', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'lot', 'intelligent', 'gifted', 'people', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'make', 'succeed', 'craftsmanship', 'be', 'admired', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'mainly', 'due', 'lack', 'historical', 'perspective', 'Somalis', 'come', 'off', 'swirling', 'seething', 'murderous', 'mob', 'Indeed', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'greatness', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'one', 'important', 'question', 'Why', 'implication', 'people', 'were', 'essentially', 'subhuman', 'incapable', 'appreciating', 'great', 'saviors', 'West', 'Trust', 'lot', 'more', 'story']",N/A

The scariest thing that goes through my mind when I watch this movie is that these events really happened in all their gruesome, vivid imagery, and the director does not try to spare you from the horrors of the events in Somalia.  Much like Saving Private Ryan, you are along for the ride into the Hell which those Army Rangers found themselves engulfed in.The acting is for the most part pretty good. The action is brutal and there is one scene in particular that can really gross you out.  But the movie needs scenes like that to really help you understand what the fighting in Somalia was all about.  The movie is tragic and uplifting at the same time.

The US are woefully under-weaponed and under-staffed as the Somalians proceed to fell 2 Black Hawk Heliocopters... hence the name of the film. The US troops underestimated the ferocity with which the rag-tag Somalians would defend their city and after approx 19 of our men are killed...we pulled out, retreated really from Somalia.This is the first of what I will call the &quot;Modern&quot; War films, in that Heliocopter video cameras catch all of the action while General William Garrison (Sam Shepard) calls the shots from a base outside of Mogadishu, based on these video pictures. He's a God-like figure manipulating fate from a place up high and removed from the action. It's like a real-life, real consequence PlayStation2 game. Heretofore, and think of any war film before this one, whether it be the Civil War, WWI,WWII, or Vietnam...war communication was conducted by hand messages, telephone, telegraph on maybe still pictures. &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; begins the era of the new film war...the first real war film of the new Millenium.Even though Josh Hartnett is given top billing and he does a fine job, he is only part of a superb ensemble of which Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, William Fichter and Enrico Murciano are standouts.As with all Ridley Scott films the physical production is first rate: camerawork, use of color, sound and music are extrememly effective.

Mazza,"[9, 12]","I'll leave it to more educated persons to comment on the historical accuracy of ""Black Hawk Down,"" the war film directed by Ridley Scott. BHD tells the story of a U.S. Army mission to apprehend and transport certain individuals during a mission in the war-torn nation of Somalia. The bulk of the film is an intense recreation of the devestating urban combat that this mission entailed.BHD is very much an ensemble piece, and is filled with many familiar names and faces: Sam Shepard (as the general in charge of the mission), Ewan McGregor (as a paper-pushing, coffee-making desk soldier who is thrust into combat), Orlando Bloom (as a gung-ho young soldier), Tom Sizemore, Jason Isaacs, and more. A particularly strong performance is delivered by Josh Hartnett as a thoughtful, idealistic young sergeant who must assume greater command responsibilities. The cast as a whole delivers solid performances; they portray their characters not as bigger-than-life heroes, but as real people struggling to deal with extreme circumstances.The combat sequences are absolutely stunning. The film looks at times more like a documentary of war than like a recreation. There is much graphic gore and horrific violence, but the film is not, in my opinion, exploitative; rather, Scott's vision strikes me as honest and tragic.""Black Hawk Down"" does not feel like a ""rah-rah"" propaganda film. But it seems clear to me that Scott and his colleagues have a genuine compassion and respect for soldiers, and are trying to portray with integrity the horrible burdens shouldered by soldiers in conflict.

497819,A3IB1W0SVED0Z3,B00000F3KL,"Mike Powers ""mkp51""","[17, 29]","""Black Hawk Down"" is excellent in almost every way.  It's tough.  It's gritty.  It's realistic.  And it shows the supreme patriotism and dedication to duty shown by the young men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, when they're confronted by an armed foe..For those unfamiliar with the story of ""Black Hawk Down,"" this film is based on actual events, specifically the Battle of Mogadishu, Somalia, in October, 1993.  U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force operators were among American forces stationed there, with their mission being to bring various warring Somali factions to heel, so that United Nations humanitarian workers could distribute food to Somalia's starving population.On October 3, 1993, a small force of Rangers and Deltas were sent into Mogadishu via Black Hawk helicopter and Humvee vehicles, in order to apprehend two of Somali war lord Mohamed Farrah Aidid's top lieutenants.  The city was already in a near state of anarchy, with several factions fighting each other.  When Aidid's followers received a tip-off that American troops were on the way, they responded with alacrity.  Armed to the teeth with automatic weapons, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs), and other light and medium weapons, they manned roadblocks, rooftops, and any other advantageous location they could find, in anticipation of giving the Americans the fight of their lives.Almost from the minute the Army Rangers began rappelling down ropes from the Black Hawks, they came under intense enemy fire.  The Rangers and Deltas were successful in capturing Aidid's lieutenants... but at a heavy cost.  Within an hour of the mission's start, Somali rebels managed to shoot down two Black Hawks and kill several American troopers.  What began as a routine mission that should have taken no more than an hour became a protracted 22-hour long battle that resulted in 19 American and as many as 1,000 Somali casualties.""Black Hawk Down"" is a very good depiction of what happened on that day.  I had read Mark Bowden's book of the same name (upon which the movie is based) before watching the film.  While many events have been, of necessity, condensed, and others have been chronologically altered in order to adapt a 400 page book into a two and one-half hour film, director Ridley Scott and his crew did an admirable job of conveying what actually happened on that fateful October day.Although the acting is by no means Oscar-worthy, it's actually pretty good throughout the film.  There are no real standouts in the cast, but that's because the film seems more focused on the events of the day, rather than the people who carried out those events.Many scenes in ""Black Hawk Down"" are pretty tough to take, especially if you're a viewer who feels uncomfortable with a lot of blood and gore.  I don't consider any of the bloody scenes to be gratuitous, but rather an accurate reflection of what war is really like.  In that regard, ""Black Hawk Down"" is very similar to ""Saving Private Ryan.""If there's anything to criticise in ""Black Hawk Down,"" it's the lack of character development.  The screen writers made a half-hearted attempt to introduce us to some of the main characters, especially Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), Captain Mike Steele (Jason Isaacs), and Specialist Grimes (Ewan MacGregor), but we never really get to know these men.  Because of the lack of effective character development, I was never able to really empathize with the men who found themselves thrown into this terrible situation; rather, I watched the entire movie with a cool, analytical detachment.MY VERDICT:  Despite a few flaws, ""Black Hawk Down"" is an overall superb film... certainly one of the better war films of recent years.",5,"""Only the dead have seen the end of war.""",1026000000,"07 7, 2002",2002,3714,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'excellent', 'almost', 'way', 'tough', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'supreme', 'patriotism', 'dedication', 'duty', 'shown', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'serve', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'when', ""'re"", 'confronted', 'armed', 'foe..For', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'film', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'specifically', 'Battle', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia', 'October', '1993', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'operators', 'were', 'American', 'forces', 'stationed', 'there', 'mission', 'being', 'bring', 'various', 'warring', 'Somali', 'factions', 'heel', 'United', 'Nations', 'humanitarian', 'workers', 'could', 'distribute', 'food', 'Somalia', 'starving', 'population.On', 'October', '3', '1993', 'small', 'force', 'Rangers', 'Deltas', 'were', 'sent', 'Mogadishu', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopter', 'Humvee', 'vehicles', 'order', 'apprehend', 'two', 'Somali', 'war', 'lord', 'Mohamed', 'Farrah', 'Aidid', 'top', 'lieutenants', 'city', 'was', 'already', 'near', 'state', 'anarchy', 'several', 'factions', 'fighting', 'other', 'When', 'Aidid', 'followers', 'received', 'tip-off', 'American', 'troops', 'were', 'way', 'responded', 'alacrity', 'Armed', 'teeth', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'rocket', 'propelled', 'grenades', 'RPGs', 'other', 'light', 'medium', 'weapons', 'manned', 'roadblocks', 'rooftops', 'other', 'advantageous', 'location', 'could', 'find', 'anticipation', 'giving', 'Americans', 'fight', 'lives.Almost', 'minute', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'began', 'rappelling', 'down', 'ropes', 'Black', 'Hawks', 'came', 'intense', 'enemy', 'fire', 'Rangers', 'Deltas', 'were', 'successful', 'capturing', 'Aidid', 'lieutenants', 'heavy', 'cost', 'hour', 'mission', 'start', 'Somali', 'rebels', 'managed', 'shoot', 'down', 'two', 'Black', 'Hawks', 'kill', 'several', 'American', 'troopers', 'What', 'began', 'routine', 'mission', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'hour', 'became', 'protracted', '22-hour', 'long', 'battle', 'resulted', '19', 'American', 'as', 'many', '1,000', 'Somali', 'casualties', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'very', 'good', 'depiction', 'what', 'happened', 'day', 'had', 'read', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'movie', 'based', 'watching', 'film', 'many', 'events', 'have', 'been', 'necessity', 'condensed', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'chronologically', 'altered', 'order', 'adapt', '400', 'page', 'book', 'two', 'one-half', 'hour', 'film', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'crew', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'conveying', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'fateful', 'October', 'acting', 'means', 'Oscar-worthy', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'standouts', 'cast', 'film', 'more', 'focused', 'events', 'day', 'rather', 'people', 'who', 'carried', 'out', 'events.Many', 'scenes', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'are', 'pretty', 'tough', 'take', 'especially', ""'re"", 'viewer', 'who', 'uncomfortable', 'lot', 'blood', 'gore', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'bloody', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'rather', 'accurate', 'reflection', 'what', 'war', 'really', 'like', 'regard', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'very', 'similar', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'anything', 'criticise', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'screen', 'writers', 'made', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'introduce', 'main', 'characters', 'especially', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Matt', 'Eversmann', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Captain', 'Mike', 'Steele', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Specialist', 'Grimes', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'men', 'lack', 'effective', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'really', 'empathize', 'men', 'who', 'found', 'thrown', 'terrible', 'situation', 'rather', 'watched', 'entire', 'movie', 'cool', 'analytical', 'detachment.MY', 'VERDICT', 'few', 'flaws', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'overall', 'superb', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'war', 'films', 'recent', 'years']",N/A
497820,A1WYENJ1QI2S7I,B00000F3KL,"mitch ""mitch4406""","[4, 6]","This is a fantastic movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The action sequences are some of the best ever put onto the big screen. The Army Rangers and Delta Force are brave and dedicated in their efforts to capture a violent warlord. The movie focuses entirely on a mission to capture the lieutenants of a violent warlord. It was hoped that their capture would provide new intelligence on the wherabouts of the warlord, which was the ultimate goal. When this incident occurred the President and the country had already lost interest in Somalia. This is reinforced in the movie from what we don't see- there are no cutaways to politicans and generals in some Pentagon command center debating the proper course of action. Instead General Garrison(Sam Shepherd) is reminded by a subordinate to Washington apprised. The movie takes place on the day leading up to the mission and the day itself. Shortly after the Rangers commence their well orchestrated operation things go badly awry. The commanders, coordinating events from blackhawk helicopters, rush to adapt as casualities mount. The sequences of soldiers confronting the Warlord's militia and an overwhelming number of hostile citizens are gripping.The actors give fine performances and no doubt received much technical training from military advisers. Eric Bana is superb as a seen it all Delta Force soldier who gives comfort to a less experienced Army Ranger Sgt. One oddity though is Tom Sizemore who plays Colonel McKnight. All of the soldiers (save for Sizemore)accurately follow proper Army technical training by using all available cover and crouching to give the smallest possible profile to the enemy. Tom Sizemore's character defies this obvious logic and instead stands fully erect and out in the open with his big frame as bullets are whizzing by? Perhaps he thought this movie was a remake of the Green Berets.This movie is apolitical. It entirely focuses on the actions of the soldiers as they attempt to make it back to the safety of their base despite being surrounded by overwhelming numbers. As for the polictical events which go unmentioned- many people have characterised the events in Somalia as a failure of U.S foreign policy and of the Clinton administration. But what is little known perhaps because of our limited collective memory is that the decision to send U.S. forces to this country was made by President George Bush Sr. not President Clinton. When President Clinton took office U.S. forces were already in this war torn East African country. As history goes both of these Presidents should receive critisism for our failed effort in this country. They should both receive critisism for taking their eye off the ball. One takeaway from this film - we, as a nation, are much better at initiating military campaigns successfully then we are at ending them in the same manner.Just as the movie Apollo 13 showed NASA personnel at there best when facing the crisis of Astronauts in peril this movie shows our armed forces at there best as they work to avoid an even greater tragedy.

The helicopter scenes offer great stunts, and the fighting is in your face and very raw.Some of the street fighting scenes/sets reminded me a bit of Full Metal Jacket,while the shadowy and mostly distant 'baddies' (the somali militias) reminded me of the murderous creoles in Southern Comfort or even the gangs of Warriors, chasing the good guys in the claustrophobic hell of a city. And because it is based on true events, the fighting was more poignant.In a cinematic sense, and although it is a tragic story because it really did happen,it was fresh to see a hard edged war film that is not set in World War II or Vitenam.BUT, the film left a bitter after taste..and for the following reasons, and I am not going into the real story behind the film and the US involvement etc, since it was well reviewed.1-The whole killing and fighting had a computer game feel to them..if you played Delta Force you will know what i mean.2-It was very violent, and while I suspect Scott wanted to show how brutal that short but very deadly war was, some of the scenes were very graphic..(triggiring in my mind the eternal debate of how studios and censors accept such gore yet flash their scissors and cry 'Murder'at intimacies and sex in movies)So,do we really need to see so much gore?3-As some reviewers have mentioned, there are no visual background to the US involvement or the somalis condition..What we see of the somalis mostly are the gun totting, trigger happy evil militias who are starving their own people..The scene towards the end of an eldery somali carrying a dead child, is too sentimental, without giving the viewer the background to sympathize with his predicament.4-it was 144 minutes.. a bit too long I thought, as some scenes, especially in the US base camp dragged on a bit, probably intending to develop some of the soldier's characters, but did not fully work.So if you expect the excellent Saving Private Ryan or the poetic masterpiece of Thin Red Line, you will be disappointed.

The mission goes disastrously wrong when the local militia decide to hit back. The militia shoot down a helicopter and the mission goes downhill from there.The action scenes, of which the movie is full, are gritty, realistic and close up. The violence is reasonably graphic, but not overly so. I thinkWe Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)is more graphic in this sense. ""Black Hawk Down"" makes the action frenetic and dirty, and that makes it one exciting movie to watch.The movie does something to introduce the complexities of operating in Somalia, and the obstacles that faced the US forces there. The fact that Hoot could wander about the arms markets in Mogadishu goes some way to increase the confusing relations between the locals and the US forces.For a movie heavy on action, lots of battles and tension, but relatively light on the intellectual loading, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a great one.

Director Ridley Scott rarely has disappointed me; he is in top form here.The film documents the events that took place on October 3-4, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia. U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force were assigned to arrest two lieutenants of warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid. The raids were supposed to take 45 minutes, but two Black Hawk helicopters ended up being shot down, and it turned into a 16 hour bloodbath. In the end, 19 Americans and over 1,000 Somalis were killed. The film focuses on the American soldiers, played by such actors as Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, and William Fichtner. Sam Shepard and Orlando Bloom play smaller parts.The acting? It was decent enough, but then it didn't have to be that great. Scott's direction was superb. The cinematography was outstanding, as well as the other technical aspects (the film received Oscars for Film Editing and Sound).I can't tell you just how good ""Black Hawk Down"" is.

497824,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00000F3KL,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[8, 10]","As everybody now knows, Black Hawk Down is the true story of the Battle of Mogadishu, which took place in October 1993, when an American elite force carried out their mission (to abduct two lieutenants of the notorious Somalian warlord Mohammad Aidid) and ended up in the longest post Vietnam land battle involving American soldiers. During this ferocious gun battle 18 American soldiers were killed and 73 injured, whilst over 500 Somali gunmen also lost their lives.Ridley Scott, hot off the heels of Gladiator, pulls no punches in his direction of this tragic fiasco, as he provides us with 135 minutes of ear shattering, stomach-churning, war is hell, all out action. There to the story is that American troops are on a peace-keeping mission trying to support the supply of food to the people of Somalia, who are being starved as a result of the local warlords commandeering all the Red Cross relief efforts. However, as is usually the case, their efforts are compromised by politics and they have to watch on helplessly as the Somalian guerrillas turn their guns own their own starving people. As a result, a plan is formulated by the army to enter the hostile capital of Mogidishu in broad daylight to abduct two of Mohammad Aidid's most senior aides. However, even before the mission can begin, the plan is hamstrung by Washington politicians who limit the mission's aerial support and firepower. And so the mission begins with the Delta Force and Rangers but everything starts to unravel when one of the helicopters involved in the mission, the said Black Hawk of the title, gets shot down in the middle of the city and the whole mission begins to tragically unravel.Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer have provided a 135 minute deafening assault on the senses. The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is impeccable and in a strange way aesthetically pleasing and the cast, led by Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana (The Hulk) and Ewan McGregor, is perhaps implausibly good looking and McGregor's first attempt at an American accent is not altogether consistent or convincing. However, the aesthetic appeal of three of Hollywood's hottest young stars is balanced by the chunky Tom Sizemore and the so ugly (only a mother could love that face) Ewen Bremner of Trainspotting fame, who actually provides a stand out supporting performance and an American accent which impressively belies his Scottish roots. Also particularly impressive in another supporting performance is Jason Isaacs (Event Horizon, The Patriot) as Captain Mike Steele.One of the most refreshing but also most frustrating things about Black Hawk Down is its lack of political context. There is no explanation as to whose decision it was to limit the mission and no finger pointing at those that inevitably made the decision to pull out of Somalia. There is also very little background character development about any of the soldiers with perhaps the exception of Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), who is presented as being somewhat pragmatic and anti-war. The movie does not follow the traditional formula of war movies that focuses upon ordinary men overcoming great odds through glorious sacrifice to triumph with flag-waving patriotism. Instead it focuses upon professional soldiers drawn together by a common aim to stay alive, free of the usual moral justifications of being a soldier in the first instance. It is neither anti-war, nor anti-army. It is about comradeship through necessity, kill or be killed and in Black Hawk Down there is plenty of both. Or as Eric Bana's character puts it ""It's about the man next to you; that's all there is."" Ultimately, whether you enjoy Black Hawk Down or not will depend on whether you like war movies and whether or not you like them to be gritty and realistic.

This was all on purpose, focusing on the young troopers not the overview that Pearl Harbor and Gladiator attempted.  The battles are intense, loud, and gory.  Much like real war.  Many complain about the lack of focus on the Somalis, but this film, like Mark Bowden's book focused primarily on our troops, their mission, and the sometimes horrible deaths they faced.  Good performances are done by Eric Bana (the Hulk), William Fichtner (every Jerry Bruckheimer movie known to man), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Sam Shepherd (Swordfish), and the dozens of young starts portraying our troops.  This film is great film.

As far as Ridley Scott's (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"") direction goes, it was just as thrilling and exciting as ever! And now, on to producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pearl Harbor"", ""Armageddon""). Bruckheimer did a superb job in bringing this real-life story to the big screen! ""Black Hawk Down"" focuses on the Battle of Mogadishu in October, 1993. An elite force of Delta and Ranger units attempt what should be a short mission (in other words, a quick in-and-out), but when their helicopters are unexpectedly shot down, they are forced into the longest sustaining ground battle since the Vietnam War. ""Black Hawk Down"", indeed, has a top-notch cast including Josh Hartnett (""Pearl Harbor""), Ewan McGregor (""Moulin Rouge""), Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan""), Eric Bana (upcoming ""Incredible Hulk"" movie), William Fichtner (""Armageddon""), and Sam Shepard (""Swordfish""). In conclusion, ""Black Hawk Down"" is among one of the greatest war epics ever filmed since Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". Also, to me, ""Black Hawk Down"" is way, way better than that boring ""Thin Red Line""!

It's hard to watch because it provides such a realistic look into a very difficult episode in American military history.  You may recall that this is the mission that opened with news teams meeting the Navy Seals with glaring camera lights as they swam in to the beach in the wee hours of the morning.  It's also the mission that saw a ragtag force of ill-trained but heavily armed thugs under the command of Mohammad Farah Aidid ambush American troops whose job it was to bring desperately needed humanitarian aid to the starving people of Mogadishu.  Aidid had a vested interest in making sure that the American mission failed and the country remained unstable -- he controlled the meager food supplies in the area, and so wielded immense political influence which he was not about to relinquish without a fight.So it was that one day an American ground convoy under surveillance of several UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters wound its way into the heart of the sprawling slums of Mogadishu.  Its mission was to seize two prominent leaders in Aidid's faction.  The mission began well enough, with the &quot;targets&quot; being captured as planned.  However, Aidid's forces had been alerted to the American mission, and laid ambush positions throughout the city.  The escaping American convoy as well as their Blackhawk escorts quickly came under heavy small arms and RPG fire.  Soon two helicopters were crashed in the streets, with their surviving crew members fighting for survival against hopeless odds.  Troops were rushed to the crash sites to try to effect a rescue, but both the Rangers and special ops troopers, as well as some members of the 10th Mountain Division, found themselves battling for their lives against a seemingly limitless enemy force with vast local numerical superiority.The results of the encounter were devastating.  None of us will ever forget the news images of dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets.  The news of heavy casualties took complacent, overconfident Americans by surprise.  I was serving in the 10th Mountain Division at the time, although not personally deployed to Somalia, and I remember my own shock and horror at the images of what had befallen my fellow soldiers.&quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; captures this entire tale in a gritty, action-packed, suspenseful way, from the perspective of the soldiers on the ground.  It highlights the ugly side of human nature, along with ample depictions of courage and sacrifice.  Admittedly it is very sympathetic in its portrayal of the Americans, but I don't see this as detracting from the film at all given the historical realities of the situation.  Aidid and his followers were decidedly unworthy of sympathy, and are portrayed accordingly.  Watch it and decide for yourself.

497836,A363QRXP83K8ZE,B00000F3KL,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[5, 7]","[This review speaks mainly to the film, not the 3-disc special edition release]Black Hawk Down is a tough movie to qualify.  It's visually amazing--this is some of the best combat I've seen in a movie.  It's thrilling, it's realistic, it's exciting.  I wouldn't exactly call this an anti-war film because it depicts war as the ultimate thrill, a real game of real bullets and blood.  Yes, it's hell, but with Ridley Scott directing it looks like a very, very good video game.I don't know why this movie was made.  There is no political leaning, there is very little context.  It's a blow by blow account of what happened when over 100 Army Ranger and Delta Force soldiers were stuck in a hostile part of Mogadishu, Somalia in late 1993.  The enemy, as to be expected from a Jerry Bruckheimer film, is given no identity.  They are throngs of Africans, many of them kids, firing round after round and coming like swarms of bees even as they get cut down by the superior US firepower.The problem is that the movie goes to very impressive lengths to play out this story.  The production is huge--the battle scenes, the city scenes (filmed in some bombed-out-looking part of Morocco apparently), the gunplay, etc.  This is an expensive film, and I have to wonder why the money and resources go into something like this if there is nothing to say.  Then it becomes pure entertainment, which is all the film turns out to be.  That's fine, but again, once in a while it would be nice to inject some intelligence into a project that obviously commanded so many other resources and considerations.Why was America in Somalia?  Granted, that is not the concern of the film, but some kind of context for the war, the rebels, the aims of the mission, the pov of Somalis who were killing to negotiate, as one Somali says in the only behind-the-scenes bit in the film, would have put the film over the edge and actually made the audience ::gasp:: think about why America fights where it does.There's also the obligatory war film clich&eacute;s that are just hard to stomach when we know that these are real soldiers being trivialized for the popcorn crowd.  Tom Sizemore, as a veteran and tough-as-nails McKnight, goes back into the fray to rescue more men and walks calmly through the street as bullets ricochet around him, like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now.  Modern movie special effects can simulate rockets blowing people apart, literally, and leg wounds being operated on with someone's bare hands, muscle and sinew and all.  It is typical of Hollywood today: they have limitless resources, but those resources (being able to shoot a film as visually and technically impressive as this) serve a story that could use a bit more tweaking and humanization.  But the filmmakers arenot interested in that angle.It would be nice to know why Mogadishu is hell on earth, with hordes of enemies tearing people out of helicopters and raining rockets on American soldiers.  Yes, the soldiers were brave, they were highly trained, but the mission was a disaster, and it does the real story a disservice to portray it as just another chapter in American gung ho-ism.  Also, the single most memorable bit of that real story was the body of an Army Ranger being dragged through the streets by an angry mob that spit on him, and much worse.  That was a disturbing bit of footage for Americans to watch.  Would that have been more tasteless than showing an RPG rocket stuck in someone's side?  Massive, gaping wounds?  Missing legs?  Why clean up real events and their aftermath for the sake of a night out at the movies?  Maybe they should put their mouths where the money is.Make no mistake--I couldn't turn this film off.  It's exciting; it made me want to play Ghost Recon or one of those games.  It also made me want to find out more about this grim chapter in President Clinton's tenure as Commander in Chief, even though it was his predecessor who landed troops there when he was a lame duck.  Somalia was an embarrassment, an event that told America we were no longer willing to sacrifice men--18 as compared to over 1,000 Somalis killed in battle--in some foreign wasteland.

Lip service is paid to the political motivations behind the military operations. Scant attention is paid to how US military officials could have so grossly underestimated enemy resources.

The film is perhaps less successful in presenting the political complexities involved in the conflict and the motivations of the parties involved. I felt that the political message of this movie was rather vague if not naive, thus my reason for four stars.The film is brilliant for its reenactment of the events and its detailed depiction of commando operations in an urban setting. The film properly shows how the commanding officers failed to include the chaotic volatility of Mogadishu as a factor in their plans: General Montgomery made very similar logistical errors in preparing the plans for Operation Market-Garden in 1944. As a result, many of the soldiers were ill-prepared for the mission. An example of this was when the transports were leaving the target area and trying to find their way through the town. The topographical surveillance was made by satellite and relayed by officers either in helicopters or in headquarters: their instructions to turn left, go right, go straight were useless if not harmful because none of their GPDs or sattelites could show the armed mobs and road blocks spontaneously forming all over the city: more often than not, the COs led the soldiers straight into roadblocks and ambushes. Montgomery made similar errors in underestimating enemy resistance and thinking that reinforcements would come to Arnheim in 2 days as opposed to a week.The film remains rather apolitical but should have done more in showing how the politics were self-serving and Machiavellian on all sides. The film should have done more to elaborate on how US intelligence/counter-terrorism operations and influence over navigation in/out of the Red Sea were the primary US political interests in East Africa as opposed to the official propaganda of saving human lives from imminent starvation (Muhammad Adid was sought more for his terrorist/arms trade links than his starving of political undesirables.) Interestingly enough, the US didn't seem to care too much about the millions killed in the Rwandan genocide at just about the same time. Aside from that, there wasn't too much jingoism in the film. The central theme of the film is more of the commeraderie between soldiers in a time of conflict and how that keeps them functioning as a fighting unit.",4,A Good Look At 21st Century Warfare,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,2382,"['Riddley', 'Scott', 'sure', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'covering', 'tactical', 'detail', 'botched', '1993', 'extraction', 'mission', 'film', 'perhaps', 'less', 'successful', 'presenting', 'political', 'complexities', 'involved', 'conflict', 'motivations', 'parties', 'involved', 'felt', 'political', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'vague', 'not', 'naive', 'thus', 'reason', 'four', 'stars.The', 'film', 'brilliant', 'reenactment', 'events', 'detailed', 'depiction', 'commando', 'operations', 'urban', 'setting', 'film', 'properly', 'how', 'commanding', 'officers', 'failed', 'include', 'chaotic', 'volatility', 'Mogadishu', 'factor', 'plans', 'General', 'Montgomery', 'made', 'very', 'similar', 'logistical', 'errors', 'preparing', 'plans', 'Operation', 'Market-Garden', '1944', 'result', 'many', 'soldiers', 'were', 'ill-prepared', 'mission', 'example', 'was', 'when', 'transports', 'were', 'leaving', 'target', 'area', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'town', 'topographical', 'surveillance', 'was', 'made', 'satellite', 'relayed', 'officers', 'helicopters', 'headquarters', 'instructions', 'turn', 'left', 'go', 'right', 'go', 'straight', 'were', 'useless', 'not', 'harmful', 'none', 'GPDs', 'sattelites', 'could', 'show', 'armed', 'mobs', 'road', 'blocks', 'spontaneously', 'forming', 'city', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'COs', 'led', 'soldiers', 'straight', 'roadblocks', 'ambushes', 'Montgomery', 'made', 'similar', 'errors', 'underestimating', 'enemy', 'resistance', 'thinking', 'reinforcements', 'would', 'come', 'Arnheim', '2', 'days', 'opposed', 'week.The', 'film', 'rather', 'apolitical', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'showing', 'how', 'politics', 'were', 'self-serving', 'Machiavellian', 'sides', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'elaborate', 'how', 'US', 'intelligence/counter-terrorism', 'operations', 'influence', 'navigation', 'in/out', 'Red', 'Sea', 'were', 'primary', 'US', 'political', 'interests', 'East', 'Africa', 'opposed', 'official', 'propaganda', 'saving', 'human', 'lives', 'imminent', 'starvation', 'Muhammad', 'Adid', 'was', 'sought', 'more', 'terrorist/arms', 'trade', 'links', 'starving', 'political', 'undesirables', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'US', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care', 'too', 'much', 'millions', 'killed', 'Rwandan', 'genocide', 'just', 'same', 'time', 'Aside', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'jingoism', 'film', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'more', 'commeraderie', 'soldiers', 'time', 'conflict', 'how', 'functioning', 'fighting', 'unit']",N/A

It's definitely a reminder as to what our military does, and does well.The movie start off by naming some statistics of dead Somalians who have starved and some information about Muhhamad Farrah Aidid, a warlord, that seizes international food shipments.  The U.S. Rangers are called in to capture Aidid and restore order. They are instructed to capture prisoners in the heart of the hostile city: Mogadishu. The big problem that lead to the disaster would be that the Rangers were not allowed any Corporate Gunships or tanks  (thanks goes to the politicians)----just hummers and Black Hawks.  If they were allowed these vehicles, victory would have happened.The whole operation goes bad after multiple helicopters and hummers are taken out by RPG's (Rocket Propeled Grenades)and thousands of militia attack from everywhere.  The rest of the movie is about the rescue of soldiers from the helicopters and an attempt to retreat out of the danger zone.Very realistic fighting blends with just-as-realistic weaponry.  The helicopters are great (real ones were actually used) as are the vehicles.Black Hawk Down is a fantastic movie that shows how great our military is.

Similar to Gladiator, but with more senseless gore and appetite-deducing imagery, I'd have to say Scott's penchant for excessive violence has finally crossed the line of decency and style.The film starts off extremely sluggish with very little character development or exposition. There are a slew of noteworthy actors here (Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett to name a few), but there's little room for them to be enlightening and only superficial insight into their personas is given. (SPOILER ALERT:) The main premise of the film is basically about two chopters that go down in the middle of Mogadishu's marketplace, home of about 10,000 Somalia militias who are evidently very trigger-happy. A team of U.S. Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are stranded and wander the streets just to stay alive, waiting for their rescue team. A lot of U.S. troops get killed, but in the end, the ""Never Leave a Man Behind"" adage stays true to life. Yep, that's about the whole plot.If you enjoy watching hundreds of third world militias getting gunned down in senseless gunplay, then give this a rental. Otherwise, there's a lot of flying shrapnel but little evidence of a coherent story. Unlike the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan (one of the best battle moments in cinematic history), Black Hawk Down dragged on and on, and I couldn't wait to get it over with. There are some tragic moments in this film (like when the militia boy shoots his own father by accident) that try to enlighten us to a greater theme, but most of the time I just felt the film tried too hard to make any sense of the violence. One might argue that was the whole lesson behind our involvement in Somalia, but I don't think that's the intention we see here (not to mention all the inappropriate imagery that was shoved in my face). Viewers who didn't appreciate the gore in Gladiator should definitely stay away from this one.I'll have to admit this film did have amazing sound effects editing, hence the Oscar award. The montage of explosions, heartbeats, and empty shells really compounded the feeling of the sheer intensity of being in the middle of a warzone. I appreciated the effects for contributing to the overall mood, but even the best bells and whistles can't make up for a mindless storyline.

Matt Eversmann' (Josh Hartnett - Lucky Number Slevin, Sin City, The Black Dahlia) do ""bang-up"" jobs in this story of the bloody battle in ""The Mog.""Great contributions from William Fitchner (HEAT, Invasion, Prison Break, The Dark Knight) as Delta Sgt 1st Class Jeff Sanderson, Jason Isaacs (Resident Evil, Harry Potter, The State Within) as the by-the-book Ranger Capt. Mike Steele, and Tom Sizemore (HEAT, Saving Private Ryan, Bringing Out The Dead) as the rough and tough Ranger Lt. Col. Danny McKnight.It never ceases to amaze me how so many foreign actors can easily imitate American accents in movies. Whereas, American actors hardly ever come through with convincing foreign accents. Case(s) in point: Ewan McGregor as Specialist Grimes, Jason Isaacs as Capt. Steele, Ewen Bremner as Spec. Sgt. Nelson, Orlando Bloom as Pvt. Todd Blackburn and Bana as Hoot. All handling their American accents with excellence during the entire movie.

With the excepting of one screen shot from above the ""Little Bird"" gunships, showing a Huey instead.

497848,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00000F3KL,Patrick L. Randall,"[3, 5]","I just saw a phenomenal movie last night: Black Hawk Down. For those of you unfamiliar with the story behind the movie, it tells the story of an event that occurred during the 1992-93 United Nations/United States police action in Somalia to protect the innocent people of that country from the terror and famine wrought by tribal Warlord Mohammed Aidid. During one specific action on October 3rd, 1993, a squad of Delta Force and Army Rangers swooped in on a meeting of top Aidid aides held in the middle of hostile, Aidid-controlled territory. While the actual capture of Aidid's men went off with out a hitch, the escape was something far less than successful. Two of the Black Hawk helicopters that were used to transport the Rangers and Delta Force into the middle of the market place where the meeting was held were shot down by Aidid's militiamen. During the rescue attempt of the helicopter survivors, the Army's ground forces (inserted to provided the means to transport the prisoners from Aidid's territory to U.S. Base Camp) came under heavy fire as well. In the end, an operation that was to take no more than 30 minutes was not completed until well into the next day. 19 American soldiers lost their lives in this action and it was widely considered to be a huge fiasco by the general public and Clinton Administration (Clinton pulled U.S. Military forces out of Somalia 11 days later).The movie ""Black Hawk Down"" takes a different approach the events of that day. While initially dealing with the political events and motivations behind actions in Somalia, this movie subsequently focuses on the actions and decisions of the soldiers who fought (and died) that day. Faced with a situation that had terribly wrong when nearly every Somali in that market place seemed to be a member of Aidid's forces and pinned the Americans down, the Army training and discipline came to the forefront. The stellar actions by these men kept the death toll at 'only' 19 when it could have ended up with more than 100. The bravery of two men to preserve the lives of the crew of one of the downed helicopters at the expense of their own lives earned them posthumous Medals of Honor (Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart).The criticisms that this movie merely skimmed over the politics of these event the character development of the soldiers are hardly relevant. One must look at the intent and message the movie's director, Ridley Scott. The ferocious intensity of the fighting and the rapid-fire actions and decisions required of the soldiers are what Scott is trying trying to convey. He does so in a way that puts the viewer at the same ground-level view as the soldiers. The emotions and fears of the soldiers (some no more than 18-19 years old) trapped by the Somali attackers are felt by the audience. One empathizes with the plight and determination of the soldiers.For me personally, watching a movie like this makes me even more committed to serving my country. Not because I enjoy fighting or have any desire to shoot or be shot at, but because of the determination and dedication these men demonstrate every moment of their lives doing their duty and serving their country in the finest manner possible.",5,Gripping depiction of heroism amid disaster,1022889600,"06 1, 2002",2002,3242,"['just', 'saw', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'movie', 'story', 'event', 'occurred', '1992-93', 'United', 'Nations/United', 'States', 'police', 'action', 'Somalia', 'protect', 'innocent', 'people', 'country', 'terror', 'famine', 'wrought', 'tribal', 'Warlord', 'Mohammed', 'Aidid', 'one', 'specific', 'action', 'October', '3rd', '1993', 'squad', 'Delta', 'Force', 'Army', 'Rangers', 'swooped', 'meeting', 'top', 'Aidid', 'aides', 'held', 'middle', 'hostile', 'Aidid-controlled', 'territory', 'actual', 'capture', 'Aidid', 'men', 'went', 'off', 'out', 'hitch', 'escape', 'was', 'something', 'far', 'less', 'successful', 'Two', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopters', 'were', 'used', 'transport', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'middle', 'market', 'place', 'where', 'meeting', 'was', 'held', 'were', 'shot', 'down', 'Aidid', 'militiamen', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'helicopter', 'survivors', 'Army', 'ground', 'forces', 'inserted', 'provided', 'means', 'transport', 'prisoners', 'Aidid', 'territory', 'U.S.', 'Base', 'Camp', 'came', 'heavy', 'fire', 'well', 'end', 'operation', 'was', 'take', 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'was', 'not', 'completed', 'well', 'next', 'day', '19', 'American', 'soldiers', 'lost', 'lives', 'action', 'was', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'huge', 'fiasco', 'general', 'public', 'Clinton', 'Administration', 'Clinton', 'pulled', 'U.S.', 'Military', 'forces', 'Somalia', '11', 'days', 'later', '.The', 'movie', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'different', 'approach', 'events', 'day', 'initially', 'dealing', 'political', 'events', 'motivations', 'actions', 'Somalia', 'movie', 'subsequently', 'actions', 'decisions', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'died', 'day', 'Faced', 'situation', 'had', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'nearly', 'Somali', 'market', 'place', 'seemed', 'be', 'member', 'Aidid', 'forces', 'pinned', 'Americans', 'down', 'Army', 'training', 'discipline', 'came', 'forefront', 'stellar', 'actions', 'men', 'kept', 'death', 'toll', ""'only"", '19', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'more', '100', 'bravery', 'two', 'men', 'preserve', 'lives', 'crew', 'one', 'downed', 'helicopters', 'expense', 'own', 'lives', 'earned', 'posthumous', 'Medals', 'Honor', 'Master', 'Sergeant', 'Gary', 'Gordon', 'Sergeant', 'First', 'Class', 'Randall', 'Shughart', '.The', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'merely', 'skimmed', 'politics', 'event', 'character', 'development', 'soldiers', 'are', 'hardly', 'relevant', 'One', 'must', 'look', 'intent', 'message', 'movie', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'ferocious', 'intensity', 'fighting', 'rapid-fire', 'actions', 'decisions', 'required', 'soldiers', 'are', 'what', 'Scott', 'trying', 'trying', 'convey', 'so', 'way', 'viewer', 'same', 'ground-level', 'view', 'soldiers', 'emotions', 'fears', 'soldiers', 'more', '18-19', 'years', 'old', 'trapped', 'Somali', 'attackers', 'are', 'felt', 'audience', 'One', 'plight', 'determination', 'soldiers.For', 'personally', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'committed', 'serving', 'country', 'Not', 'enjoy', 'fighting', 'have', 'desire', 'shoot', 'be', 'shot', 'determination', 'dedication', 'men', 'demonstrate', 'moment', 'lives', 'doing', 'duty', 'serving', 'country', 'finest', 'manner', 'possible']",N/A

This is not a film that attempts to buoy itself in dubious storylines (such as the otherwise amazing ""Saving Private Ryan"") or political statements about the causes that wars are fought for and the inherent goods or evils therein.  ""Black Hawk Down"" is an utterly ferocious depiction of urban warfare; a to-the-details accurate recreation of the fiercest firefight that American soldiers had (at the time) been involved in since Vietnam.  This is an absolutely riveting account of the undescribable professionalism and heroism of a relatively small number of American troops pinned on the ground in the middle of an entire city full of armed people who are trying to kill them.  Those who have criticized ""Black Hawk Down"" have neglected to appreciate the film's overriding purpose, which is to place the audience right there in the streets with these soldiers as they come under unending enemy fire from every imaginable direction for 18 straight hours.  I have never seen a war film that has done a better job of depicting the utterly hellacious ferociousness of military combat, and therefore created such a deep and lasting appreciation and respect for our country's fighting men and women, what they go through, the sacrifices they endure, the hard-fought victories they win, and the causes they are called on to fight for all over the world.  The movie avoids all the sloganeering that would beat these values over your head, but if you come away from the film without having absorbed them for yourself, then the purpose of the movie has been utterly lost on you.

He had starved hundreds of thousands of his own people to death and the US government decided to intervene and capture him. The raid was a fiasco as they had underestimated the Somalis strength.What I loved most about this movie was its realistic portrayal of the soldiers, as is shows them wanting to help the Somalis but doesn't show them as overconfident and cocky. This movie has a big cast so there isn't a lot of character depth, but it gives enough time to show who the men are and manages to show their humanity.The action scenes in this movie are very intense and realistic, and the camera work and cinematography was beautiful and crisp.

497858,A104QTD4GDT2OQ,B00000F3KL,Philip S. Walker,"[10, 77]","Talk about the virtues of being a ""hero"" in practically any civilised nation today, and you are sure to become the laughing stock of whatever social environment you find yourself within. Only in the good ole U.S. of A. does this anachronistic term still carry some value, as showcased abundantly in films like ""Private Ryan"" or this high-tech drivel about a disasterous American operation in 1990s Somalia.So what exactly can describe today's all-American hero as we see him in this movie? Well, recruitment office statistics may show that about a third of applicants are practically illiterate, yet the all-American FILM hero is as well-spoken as anyone who ever graduated from acting school. Mentally and morally, he is pretty much just like any other guy. The fact that for years he has been trained to kill people in various ""professional"" ways, as well as to avoid being killed himself, has not stunted him emotionally in any way. Oh no. He is a warm guy, conscientious and responsible, a good father and husband, and though he may retort to some mild swearing in combat situations, he is never really foul-mouthed. His relationship with his superiors is relaxed and comradely, more so than in a normal civilian job. In fact, that is all the American hero of today does: he carries out ""a job"".And what kind of a job is that then? Well, often he is sent out on missions in far-off countries. This is a good thing, because it means he will only be killing non-Americans. (Whether that includes for instance British soldiers, of which more were killed by American ""friendly fire"" in the First Gulf War than by the Iraqis, is an issue these movies rarely delve into.) Whilst in a foreign land populated by foreign people, the all-American hero is sent out on a Special Mission! Wow! This mission is basically inspired by someone ""upstairs"" watching too many James Bond movies with soldiers sliding down ropes from helicopters and fast cars racing in and out. It always works for Bond, but unfortunately things don't go quite as well in the real word. To everyone's surprise the enemy not only fires back, he also hits his target. Black Hawk Down.The moment that happens, the brain of our all-American hero short-circuits completely. He develops what might be diagnosed as the Black Hawk Down's Syndrome. He is a full-time professional, meaning that the army is his home and his comrades are his REAL family. This new and completely unexpected situation, for which he is entirely unprepared, now comes before anything else, including the ""job"" he is sent out to perform. Suddenly, our hero as well as his superiors have only one thing on their mind: to save their comrades who have been hit. It doesn't matter that in doing so they will inevitably sustain more casualties who are, of course, also their comrades that must be rescued at any price, causing more casualties again in what soon develops into a rapidly accelerating chain reaction of gushing blood and splintered bones. And, of course, it doesn't matter that during this process a thousand locals are wiped out by the American troops.Really, I hear you saying, a thousand? Yes, a thousand locals were killed during this operation, not only militia but also many innocent civilians. The American losses were nineteen dead. Having watched the movie to the end this low number comes as a very surprising bit of concluding statistics. According to the film makers the Americans were constantly under very intense fire from automatic weapons, mainly fired from rooftops whilst they themselves moved though the streets below either on foot or in unarmoured vehicles. You have to ask yourself if this really is a true rendition of what happened on that day, or if the truth is that someone went on a killing spree, thinking they were members of the cast in ""The Wild Bunch""? Oh well, never mind.The thing I find most idiotic about this movie is that though it does not refrain from depicting this blatant display of American incompetence, it still strives to come across as a recruitment promotion film, as if adding a bit of warmongering background music and a few John Wayne sound bites can hide the fact this was a disaster from beginning to end, and the only reason that the Americans weren't massacred completely was that a nearby Pakistani UN unit came to their rescue. Just imagine that. The American Delta Force and Rangers saved at the eleventh hour by Pakistani cavalry! I suppose every cloud has a silver lining after all.The immense popularity of this utter piece of rubbish is hard to understand until you remember it was made in the aftermath of the World Trade Center tragedy. Surely, the sight of US soldiers mowing down a thousand Muslims right in the centre of their own city must have brought a sweet feeling of revenge to a number of viewers.Don't get me wrong. I certainly don't disagree with the overall political purpose of this mission. But it is not the only one of its kind to fail miserably and cause heavy civilian casualties, and the conclusion must be for the UN to never ever leave such ""jobs"" for the US army. Let the British SAS do it, or the Foreign Legion, or the Danish Jaegers, or some German or Finnish special units (surely their quarantine for what they did in WWII must now have run out) - let someone do it who knows their job and let John Wayne stay behind telling stories about heroes by the campfire.Incidentally, if you really want to see a fantastic film about professional army personnel pitted against militias and innocent civilians, watch ""Bloody Sunday"", an intelligent and thought-provoking movie.",1,Cowboys on the Rampage,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,5605,"['Talk', 'virtues', 'being',

Although it has some cheesy lines and some unoriginal and predicatble scenes, it is yet an extremly good movie. It has action non-stop and the fire fights are very well made. But the most important thing is that the action is a minute-by-minute action as in Mark Bowdens book, which is very good.The beginning is very good, and the music is top-notch. The sense of starvation of the Somali people is excellent, by the music and the pace in the beginning. The graphics are fantastic and clear, which makes this movie deserve one more star from my view.The battle of Mogadishu in Somalia was the bloodiest American battle since their time in Vietnam, and indeed it was gruesome. In the movie it shows things strictly from an American prespective, which is ok, but initially there should have been some, if not more from the Somali side, as in the book.What I personally did not like about the movie is that it had some, as stated, cheesy lines and that the American soldiers were almost untouchable in a firefight (in some cases). As many have stated is that the Americans were portrayed as heros and the Somalis bad guys. Of course both sides had their reasons to fight, whether who was bad and who was good. Through out the movie we follow the Rangers and Delta units as they fight Somali militias who engage them in a fierce-fight through day and into the night, which caused the Americans some 18 dead and over a 1000 dead Somalis. There are some extremly bloody scenes and one gruesome ""operation"" on a leg.Black Hawk Down is one of the few military movies to win an oscar, which I think deserves. Forget all about the politics and the cheesy stuff in the film and just enjoy it. The film crew consists of veterans: director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, oscar-winning) Jerry Bruckheimer (Pearl Harbor, The Rock, etc.), and Hans Zimmer (The Rock, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator) with more.

In Black Hawk Down, he moves from the battlefields and coliseums of ancient Rome, to the modern day battlefield of Mogadishu, Somalia.  Black Hawk Down is based on a series of articles and subsequent book by Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Mark Bowden who recounts the story of an elite unit of Delta Force soldiers and Army Rangers who are part of a U.N. peacekeeping force who are trying to capture two lieutenants of local Mogadishu crime lord Mohamed Farah Aidid in October of 1993.  Most of the men are getting their first taste of real combat and although the mission is considered dangerous, it is supposed to be fairly routine.  But upon their decent into the city, two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down by enemy fire and all hell breaks lose.  The Americans are committed to get every man, either dead or alive, out of the city and in the process become surrounded.  The firefight between the Americans and Somalis is a harrowing and gruesome affair that lasts for fifteen hours.  It is the longest  ground battle involving American troops since the Vietnam War.  When the fighting ends, eighteen Americans are dead and seventy others wounded.  Mr. Scott uses an almost documentary like approach to the film and the camera work is stunning.  The battle scenes are eerily realistic and brutal.  The film is painstakingly detailed in the visual end but it does sacrifice character development.  We never really get to know the men involved in the battle.  That is small price to pay for the overall visual greatness of the film.  The cast is filled with fresh and familiar faces.  Josh Hartnett is the central character and is surrounded by other young stars as Ewan MacGregor, Orlando Bloom (Legolas from The Lord of the Rings), Eric Bana (star of the upcoming Hulk film) as well as veterans like Tom Sizemore and Sam Shepard.

The great director of classics like Alien and Gladiator has just made two shallow bloody movies that don't suit their plots.  Yes, I'm refering to Hannibal and this--a Bruckheimer action-fest that bastardizes its personal politics in a hail of gunfire--Blackhawk Down.Don't get me wrong, the movie had its good points.  For instance, cinematography.  The shots were beautiful and well-done, especially in the first half of the film.  Also, the sound editing was great, and certain bits of silence went a long way.  But other than that--well...Ewan McGregor was spoiled in this movie.  He didn't talk much, didn't shoot much, didn't matter.  I'm not sure I'd say the same about Harnett, whose previous work (Pearl Harbor) deserved no stars at all.  About all the actors in this movie played an equal role, which is probably a subconcious symbolism for one of its main themes...""No one gets left behind.""  While brotherhood and teamwork played a big part in this movie, the development of any character was nill.Now to the real chunk of the picture--violence.  An hour and a half of violence.  Wow, everything you could wish for, gunned down Somalis that die in an instant, thumbs reattached, artery spray.  A little boy's dream come true.  Excuse me, I'm drifting into sarcasm.This movie's been described by some as ""war porn"".  I quite agree.  Like pornography, there's no emotional attachment, people and situations are exploited for profit, and there's no point except to climax, which is, of course, an RPG aimed at your back.I know very little about the actual situation in Somalia, and it seemed like Ridley Scott did either.  This anti-war film almost glorifies the action, until 30 seconds of text in before the credits.  Yes, that's right, text.  The text at the end does what the movie itself fails to do, and that's to state something grand.  The movie itself has no politics, just running, shooting, and bloodshed.  Should we have been in Somalia?  I don't know.  Should the movie have voiced some opinion on the matter?  Yes.  Did it?  Well...no.

The Deltas, along with a select few Rangers, kept the operation from being an entire loss and held that group together.

497874,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00000F3KL,Reviewer,"[7, 22]","That millions of people around the world suffer from hunger, tyranny, suppression, discrimination and worse is apparent to anyone who even only occasionally turns on the 6:00 news.  Heinous crimes and atrocities are committed daily in third world countries, and even in the most highly developed and civilized countries, as we all know only too well in the wake of September 11.  And the frustration, guilt and despair evoked by the accounts of such things can induce a sense of helplessness that is immeasurable.  Filmmakers here have chosen one especially significant incident from among the many on which to elaborate, and which puts the plight of those less fortunate into succinct perspective.  Probably because this was the largest land battle since Vietnam, the battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993 was selected to bring the turmoil in Somalia to light, and in so doing bring attention to the ongoing distress of our global community, as well.  A dramatization of the events of that day are depicted in ""Black Hawk Down,"" directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Ken Nolan, adapted from the book by Mark Bowden.Civil War in raging in Somalia, and thousands upon thousands are starving to death under the relentless rule of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  U.N. food drops have been ineffective in relieving the situation, as Aidid's troops confiscate the food in his name.  Hunger and fear are Aidid's weapons of choice.  When information comes their way that two of Aidid's most influential advisors will be in conference in the city, the commanders of the American troops stationed nearby determine to launch a raid to capture them, which they feel will greatly undermine Aidid's hold on Mogadishu.  As planned, the operation will take less than an hour; but as with all sure things, the mission quickly goes bad, American troops become trapped in the city and are summarily engaged in hostilities by the enemy.  During the melee, one of the aircraft, an American Black Hawk, is shot down.  From his command post, General William Garrison (Sam Shepard) assesses the situation, and determines that no matter what, ""No man will be left behind.""  Afterward, the whole affair briefly became a blip on the evening news and a headline in the papers; but to those who lived it, it became a day they would never forget.  And this is their story.With his 1998 film, ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Steven Spielberg set the bench mark for depicting combat on the screen in decidedly realistic terms.  That film gave the viewer a sense of being in combat that was unprecedented, and with it, Spielberg raised the bar for all who followed.  Now, it's expected that any major motion picture dealing with such subject matter will deliver that same kind of realism.  And this film certainly does.  But Spielberg did something else, too, that was very effective:  He presented all of his major players on a very personal level, which gave ""Ryan"" a significant impact emotionally as well as viscerally.  Ridley Scott did not do that with this film, and it makes all the difference in the world.  Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Hoot (Eric Bana), makes the comment that in battle, it's all about ""The guy next to you.""  And that's very true; the problem here is, we don't really know who that guy is.  Beyond enabling the audience to feel the sting of combat, to be entirely effective and really make that necessary connection with the viewer, Scott should have made sure we knew enough about these men out there fighting for their lives to really feel something when one of them went down.  With few exceptions, it is difficult to put a name to a face during it all.  Quite frankly, for the most part you can't tell the players without a scorecard.  What he basically gives you is glimpses into a number of lives, and leaves it up to you to fill in the blanks.  And it's just not enough to make this the gut wrenching drama that it should have been.As far as performances, only a couple actually stand out:  Sam Shepard as General Garrison, and Tom Sizemore as Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight.  Shepard is outstanding, turning in a fairly understated portrayal that is entirely believable, while Sizemore shows much more reserve than usual, and gives one of the more affecting performances of the film.  Also worth noting is the work of Ron Eldard as Mike Durant, one of the pilots of the Black Hawks.  But Josh Hartnett, as Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann, while creating a character that is believable, and definitely endowed with a `90s sensitivity, is less than a commanding presence, and for the most part is nothing more than just another face in the crowd.  The same fate befalls Ewan McGregor as John Grimes, a company clerk/typist who finally gets his chance for duty in the field on this ill-fated mission.The supporting cast includes William Fichtner (Master Sergeant Howe), Ewen Bremner (Nelson), Jason Isaacs (Captain Steele), Jeremy Piven (Wolcott), Orlando Bloom (Blackburn) Danny Hoch (Pilla) and Gregory Sporleder (Galentine).  Without question, the highlight of this film is the patriotism it inspires; in that regard, it's through the roof.  But as a cinematic endeavor, ""Black Hawk Down,"" is average at best.  It could have-- and should have-- been a film as emotionally gripping as they come, but Scott and Nolan dropped the ball by concentrating too much on the technical aspects of the project and apparently assuming that the human element would emerge of it's own accord.  The result is an intensely patriotic action film-- albeit a darn good one-- which accurately (by all accounts) depicts an incident that, while extremely disconcerting, is presented in a less than satisfying manner.  Scott and his team put together a good package with this film, but they just didn't fill it up-- or deliver the goods as well as they could have.",3,Patriotic Action Film,1012953600,"02 6,

The clinton administration sent in Marines to secure convoys of food for the strarving locals, then one day they were fired upon. With the withdrawal of marines, Clinton sent in Rangers, Deltas, and SEALs. This movie is about what happened on a day where a mission was supposed to be reautine, lasting lest than an hour or so. Instead it lasted a day... or so.The best quality of this movie, is that it plays at its non-fiction role in history, and it plays it well. So well, I don't know why many People ive asked, have not seen this film, and some, even more disturbingly, don't remeber what happened.With stunning visuals, heroic acting that will leave you speachless [as Josh hartnet, and even edwin mcgregor give a superb performance. Orlando bloom even did a good job, since he quit while he was ahead]. With such actors, under the strict guidence of their director and screen writer, gave us one of the more memorable movies of our day. Here in the year 2006, modern urban combat movies havnt made it to the drawing boards, though they should, since they remind us just how much our boys do for us every day... even if it's 3000 miles away.With unflinching realism, yes I know of a few bloopers here and there, but the storyline is so accurate, I almost cried at the heroism protrayed by the actors, knowing in the back of my mind, someone actually did this. This movie portrays heroism itself. no one asks to be a hero, it's just what you do when you're scared to death.Bravery is emphasized in this film, much like honor, courage, valor, and the power of the American special forces of the periode [God help our enemies today post 9/11]. From two Snipers going down on a basic suicide mission [and being awarded the medal of honor a few days later], to the shere reality that war is not a game at all, as 19 soldier's are left dead at the end of the day, and many more wounded.Great storyline, thrown with great actors, with a bunch of realistic shots of Morroco, plus realistic sounds and explosions, add in some military training for the actors, and you get Black Hakw down. The best portrayal of urban modern combat movie to date.

Plato serves as Mr. Scott's intellectual anchor with a quote as to the inevitability of war, and we get to see that &quot;war is hell,&quot; but idea wise it's down-hill from there.

It's essentially two hours of action in a two and a half hour film, and it is unrelenting, thrilling, and as good a depictation of combat as you will ever see.

In 1993, a group of peace-keeping American soldiers are sent to the hostile Somalian capital of Mogadishu to capture a ruthless warlord. When the mission goes terribly wrong, the men find themselves outnumbered by thousands of Somalian militia and fighting for their lives. Based on the best-selling true story, ""Black Hawk Down"" is a powerful action-packed masterpiece of American filmmaking. Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator & Alien) has captured the fury and carnage of war with such stunning suspense, emotional drama and realistic detail. This amazing movie contains a compelling story and spectacular action sequences. Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGreggor, Eric Bana and Tom Sizemore deliver some good performances. The talented cast also includes William Fichtner, Orlando Bloom, Jason Isaacs, Jeremy Piven and Sam Shepard. ""Black Hawk Down"" had its share of controversy but recieved some largely positive reviews and two Academy Awards.Get ready to experience director Ridley Scott's exceptional war spectacle with ""Black Hawk Down"" 3-Disc Deluxe Edition. Like its previous release, this powerful action-packed film is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains an extraordinarily flawless picture quality with stunning detail and great sharpness. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is definitely engaging with dynamic surround effects, but a DTS audio track should have been included in this edition. This stunning 3-Disc edition features audio commentaries by filmmakers and Task Force Ranger veterans, behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, in-depth historical look in the events in Mogadishu and theatrical trailers.

Sometimes we seem to be in one of the helicopters, suspended above the action; other times, we feel as if we are tagging along from street to street, never knowing if or when....The production values are outstanding. The faces as well as the thoughts and feelings of those involved are almost always concealed. The plot does not so much develop as it evolves. The lucky ones escape and we accompany them, relieved and weary. The film ends, the credits roll, and then the house lights come up. We have &quot;been there&quot; but remain uncertain where the &quot;there&quot; is. This is a unique and compelling human experience.

Very moving with plenty of action with curves thrown in that you want to help but can't, the impact of emotion is there, the actors are fantastic doing there bit to keep us entertained so when you can't move from the chair because too wrapped up in the story.

The exploits of Task Force Ranger were detailed very well in the book ; the film , although very ""heroic"" really didn't own up to the fact that the whole operation was screwed up. Over 60% of the Rangers and Delta Force boys were either killed or wounded. That critical diatribe aside , I thought that the portrayal of the young Americans who fought the battle of Mogodishu was very good. Tom Sizemore always brings his character to life--this time LTC Danny McKnight. In fact Colonel McKnight was perhaps the most realistic senior officer involved in the battle ; he realized what a terrible risk was being taken by the senior brass to capture the warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid.The combat scenes that follow the landing of the Ranger chalks are pretty realistic ; the axiom that ""no plan survives contact with the enemy"" , the one the brass forgot , plays out before the viewer's eyes. Those who have never served in the military cannot understand that full auto fire can really do a number on the hearing as portrayed in the movie. This film shows the enormously destructive power of modern helicopters as well as their vulnerability to small arms ground fire...I guess I didn't really ""enjoy"" this film ; I found myself time-warped back 35 years to my time in the army , and found myself cursing the politicians who got us into this situation and the generals who did the planning(?!) for the operation.As a general comment on the film , it really is a must see. However the book is a must read if you watch the film. I rated the film only 3 stars because it didn't reveal to the audience the real magnitude of the tragedy to both sides.

497888,A3TOQAMJURAYFC,B00000F3KL,Roland Dark,"[4, 5]","""Black Hawk Down"" is an ultra-realistic, fact-based account of the incident which took place October 3 and 4, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia. An elite group of U.S. Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are assigned to infiltrate a Somalia town and capture two lieutenants and other tier one associates of Mohamed Farrah Aiddid, the despotic warlord responsible for the starvation of hundreds of thousands of Somalis. When one of the U.S. Black Hawk choppers is shot down by a RPG, the by-the-book, 30-minute mission turns into a 15-hour struggle for survival as Aiddid's militia closes in.No-nonsense and to the point, ""Black Hawk Down"" is replete with stark images that evoke the frenzied horror of war, giving you the sense of being right in the middle of the fray. Director Ridley Scott weaves his craft masterfully, juxtaposing intense, graphic battles with visually stunning, cinematic scenes. His keen sense of detail is evident in little things like animals running across streets and soldiers brushing hot spent shell casings off their bodies. Scott did not do it alone, however. He is aided by convincing performances from a fine cast. Comparisons to another recent war film are inevitable. It features the same desaturated color and distinct shutter speed used for battle sequences seen in ""Saving Private Ryan"". However, this film is even more effective. After all, it is a true story. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that it flushes political correctness down the toilet, depicting events as they actually happened. The only flaw is Hans Zimmer's annoying rock soundtrack, which diminishes the documentary quality of the film and makes a few scenes bare to close a resemblance to a music video or military recruitment commercial. The film would have had an even more realistic feel with minimal scoring or no scoring at all.""Black Hawk Down"" is a tribute to the courage exhibited by the U.S. fighting forces and the 19 American soldiers who were killed that day in 1993. It also brings to the public's attention a little-known but important event.

497889,A13Y8XNB8YC92D,B00000F3KL,Roland P. Petalver,"[0, 1]","I did not explore any of the DVD aside from the feature, so my review is limited to only the film itself.The film was entertaining in that it kept me interested in the flow of action. It was neat to see an interpretation of modern battle strategies and the soldiers that carried them out. The film also gave me a good feeling of place: where the soldiers were fighting and the conditions they found themselves in. What keeps me from viewing the film as a great one rests in two major criticisms. First, I objected to how the filmmakers inserted ""humanist"" scenes into the work. These bits of conversation and exchanges between various soldiers were meant to show a personal side to the combatants, that they all had families and histories and desires, etc. Moreover, these scenes were meant to get me emotionally involved in the film. But by using these episodes in sporadic and what seemed off-handed moments, and by being very shallow interchanges then, I felt as if the filmmakers were trying to illicit a response from me that they had not sufficiently paid for. My second major criticism is that the filmmakers did not supply an adequate context for the story. I can sympathize with trying to show a story from beginning to end, a finite piece of reality, and this can and is done regularly in story-telling. But in the case of the events shown in ""Black Hawk Down"", anyone with even a minor sense of international politics can realize that an entire angle was absent from the film. There was some off-handed remarks about the US mission in Somalia, but the pressures that found the US there, the impossibility of their overall mission and the resultant shift in US foreign policy in the aftermath of the what happend in Mogadishu, were completly left out of the film. Given, the story is one of warfare; however and of course, war does not exist in a vacuum. If the goal of the filmmakers was to entertain, then they did a satisfactory job, but if they were trying to create a testimonial to the soldiers who fought that day, then they do them an injustice by not further explaining the political and historical context in which they fought.",3,The Feature was Rich but Flawed,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,2147,"['did', 'not', 'explore', 'DVD', 'aside', 'feature', 'review', 'limited', 'only', 'film', 'itself.The', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'kept', 'interested', 'flow', 'action', 'was', 'neat', 'see', 'interpretation', 'modern', 'battle', 'strategies', 'soldiers', 'carried', 'out', 'film', 'also', 'gave', 'good', 'feeling', 'place', 'where', 'soldiers', 'were', 'fighting', 'conditions', 'found', 'What', 'viewing', 'film', 'great', 'one', 'two', 'major', 'criticisms', 'First', 'objected', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'inserted', 'humanist', 'scenes', 'work', 'bits', 'conversation', 'exchanges', 'various', 'soldiers', 'were', 'meant', 'show', 'personal', 'side', 'combatants', 'had', 'families', 'histories', 'desires', 'etc', 'Moreover', 'scenes', 'were', 'meant', 'get', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'film', 'using', 'episodes', 'sporadic', 'what', 'seemed', 'off-handed', 'moments', 'being', 'very', 'shallow', 'interchanges', 'then', 'felt', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'illicit', 'response', 'had', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'paid', 'second', 'major', 'criticism', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'not', 'supply', 'adequate', 'context', 'story', 'can', 'sympathize', 'trying', 'show', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'finite', 'piece', 'reality', 'can', 'done', 'regularly', 'story-telling', 'case', 'events', 'shown', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'anyone', 'even', 'minor', 'sense', 'international', 'politics', 'can', 'realize', 'entire', 'angle', 'was', 'absent', 'film', 'was', 'off-handed', 'remarks', 'US', 'mission', 'Somalia', 'pressures', 'found', 'US', 'impossibility', 'overall', 'mission', 'resultant', 'shift', 'US', 'foreign', 'policy', 'aftermath', 'what', 'happend', 'Mogadishu', 'were', 'completly', 'left', 'out', 'film', 'Given', 'story', 'one', 'warfare', 'however', 'course', 'war', 'not', 'exist', 'vacuum', 'goal', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'entertain', 'then', 'did', 'satisfactory', 'job', 'were', 'trying', 'create', 'testimonial', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'day', 'then', 'do', 'injustice', 'not', 'further', 'explaining', 'political', 'historical', 'context', 'fought']",N/A

497894,A37IH65E7CTXRS,B00000F3KL,R. Setliff,"[3, 4]","~Black Hawk Down~ was Director Ridley Scott's masterful cinematic remake of the little known 1993 American Special Forces intervention in Somalia, under the auspices of that corrupt, ineffective organization we affectionately know as the United Nations. On June 5, 1993, 24 Pakistani UN peacekeepers were ambushed and killed in an area of Mogadishu, controlled by Aidid. On June 6, the United Nations Security Council issued a toothless Resolution 837 calling for the arrest and trial of those responsible for the ambush. The U.S. Government answered the call. Operation Gothic Serpent, was authorized with the purpose of hunting down and capturing the Islamic leader and warlord of Somalia, Muhammad Farrah Aidid. With an economy in shambles, the warlords reigned supreme, using the relief given from international humanitarian relief programs as a spoils system to buy influence and power. The conversation between one of the warlord's henchman and an American officer was particularly foreboding: ""Do you think if you get General Aidid,"" queried Abdullah Hassan, ""we will simply put down our weapons and adopt American democracy? That the killing will stop? We know this. Without victory, there will be no peace. There will always be killing, see? This is how things are in our world."" Like the book, by Mark Bowden mentioned, you realize why that Mogadishu was nicknamed ""the Black Sea"" by the American G.I.'s that were dispatched there. Those beleaguered outnumbered American soldiers learned how fleet-footed they could be when chased down the streets by Somali mobs welding AK-47s and machetes.Whether it was intended to, or not, (which I doubt it was,) this is a powerful anti-war film against American interventionism abroad. I for one have empathy for the American G.I. and the sacrifices they make, but also would like to see them alive and well in the U.S. And as one soldier said in the film, ""Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics just goes right out the window."" Intervention beget more intervention in this sad tale. Americans were trapped and pinned down. Then Blackhawks and more troops were called in for support. Then those Blackhawks were shot down. Then more troops were sent into rescue the rest. 'Leave no man behind,' was an honorable U.S. Army tradition, as well it should be, but I am apt to reflect on the futility of sending so many men into a futile battle in the first place. People can boast about the Army's superior kill ratios, but the 'Mog' as it was nicknamed, is but a microcosm of our government's present costly, futile war in Iraq which commenced in 2003. America's history of twentieth-century military victories are often Pyrrhic victories, or those battles won at too great a cost. In the case of Aidid, he was never captured, and there was no strategic victory. He died a few years later.In 1983, after the tragic bombing of the Marine barracks, then President Ronald Reagan rightly condemned it as a ""despicable attack,"" but ultimately came to affirm the futility of American intervention in the Middle East: ""Perhaps we didn't appreciate fully enough the depth of the hatred and the complexity of the problems that made the Middle East such a jungle. Perhaps the idea of a suicide car bomber committing mass murder to gain instant entry to Paradise was so foreign to our own values and consciousness that it did not create in us the concern for the Marines' safety that it should have. In the weeks immediately after the bombing, I believed the last thing that we should do was turn tail and leave. Yet the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics forced us to rethink our policy there. If there would be some rethinking of policy before our men die, we would be a lot better off. If that policy had changed towards more of a neutral position and neutrality, those 241 Marines would be alive today."" Analogous thinking could be applied to Mogadishu or Baghdad.The most mesmerizing part of the entire film is when the idealist Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (played by Josh Harnett) talks to his fallen comrade on a morgue table: ""A friend of mine asked me before I got here, 'Why are y'all going to fight someone else's war.

497900,A2FA18B50XGXJX,B00000F3KL,Sam Damon Jr.,"[4, 14]","First a warning; a movie director has a tight schedule to shoot all the scenes in the movie and he usually reuses a small supply of vehicles to replicate many vehicles. He cannot actually destroy vehicles in one scene and have them available for the next scene acting as different vehicles. What this means is that a dangerous inaccuracy exists throughout this movie less so in the book. THE RUBBER TIRES ON THE HMMWV, 5-TON AND MALAYSIAN ARMORED CARS WERE SHOT, SHREDDED AND BURNED OFF BY EXPLOSIONS IMMOBILIZING THESE VEHICLES. Because Scott had a film to finish with limited resources, the entire weakness of the air-filled rubber tired vehicle is glossed over resulting in potentially the viewer thinking combat vehicles that roll on such weak means are tactically sound when they are clearly not. Actually this is the most important lesson from the October 3, 1993 Somalia firefight, not that our men are courageous----------as the U.S. Army is currently on a delusional suicidal love embrace with the rubber-tired armored car when it should be fielding/upgrading light tracked, parachute and helicopter deliverable M113A3-type tracked tanks that can rumble right through the weak barricades endemic to third world country hellholes that stymied and blocked LTC McKnight's rubber-tired vehicle column from reaching the trapped men.Because Scott didn't show this important truth from that battle this film must be downgraded to 4 stars; the stakes are too high to continue to draw the wrong lessons.The film however does show at the end Pakistani tracked M113s and medium tanks leading the way to rescue the trapped Rangers/Delta operators and the smug, ungrateful arrogance of a few of the Rangers to admit that they needed help in a cityfight from armored vehicles and other troops they think are their ""lessers"". A lack of technotactical humility to admit that cloth BDU uniforms and Ranger tabs don't stop bullets resulted in the call-for-help not being immediately sent after the ""snatch & grab"" timetable was untenable nor having a what-if plan that realized the weakness of rubber tired wheeled vehicles to overcome obstacles and enemy fire to incorporate tracked armored vehicles available from U.N. allies in the short-term and for the long-term, permanently into Army Ranger/SOF force structure. The world is urbanizing so Somalia-type environments are the RULE not the exception---high value targets that are heavily defended need SHOCK ACTION and this means tracked tanks not just infiltrating but unarmored commandos that can be pinned down by enemy fire once surprise is lost. As of this writing the Ranger/SOF community has still not incorporated any light tracked armored vehicles into their force mix, so 9 years after Somalia they are without excuse.Courageous men deserve courageous thinking that faces unpleasant realities and solves problems; if you the viewer watch this film and conclude correctly that if the snatch & grab had the ground link-up force composed of tracked armored vehicles-------that by trial & error had to be sent in anyway---------that there would have been no ""Black Hawks down!"" at all you have benefited greatly from this movie.",4,"Its the wheels, stupid!",1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,3178,"['First', 'warning', 'movie', 'director', 'tight', 'schedule', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'movie', 'usually', 'small', 'supply', 'vehicles', 'replicate', 'many', 'vehicles', 'can', 'not', 'actually', 'destroy', 'vehicles', 'one', 'scene', 'have', 'available', 'next', 'scene', 'acting', 'different', 'vehicles', 'What', 'dangerous', 'inaccuracy', 'movie', 'less', 'so', 'book', 'RUBBER', 'TIRES', 'ON', 'THE', 'HMMWV', '5-TON', 'AND', 'MALAYSIAN', 'ARMORED', 'CARS', 'WERE', 'SHOT', 'SHREDDED', 'AND', 'BURNED', 'OFF', 'BY', 'EXPLOSIONS', 'IMMOBILIZING', 'THESE', 'VEHICLES', 'Scott', 'had', 'film', 'finish', 'limited', 'resources', 'entire', 'weakness', 'air-filled', 'rubber', 'tired', 'vehicle', 'glossed', 'resulting', 'potentially', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'combat', 'vehicles', 'roll', 'such', 'weak', 'means', 'are', 'tactically', 'sound', 'when', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'Actually', 'most', 'important', 'lesson', 'October', '3', '1993', 'Somalia', 'firefight', 'not', 'men', 'are', 'courageous', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'currently', 'delusional', 'suicidal', 'love', 'embrace', 'rubber-tired', 'armored', 'car', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'fielding/upgrading', 'light', 'tracked', 'parachute', 'helicopter', 'deliverable', 'M113A3-type', 'tracked', 'tanks', 'can', 'rumble', 'right', 'weak', 'barricades', 'endemic', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'stymied', 'blocked', 'LTC', 'McKnight', 'rubber-tired', 'vehicle', 'column', 'reaching', 'trapped', 'men.Because', 'Scott', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'important', 'truth', 'battle', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'downgraded', '4', 'stars', 'stakes', 'are', 'too', 'high', 'continue', 'draw', 'wrong', 'lessons.The', 'film', 'however', 'show', 'end', 'Pakistani', 'tracked', 'M113s', 'medium', 'tanks', 'leading', 'way', 'rescue', 'trapped', 'Rangers/Delta', 'operators', 'smug', 'ungrateful', 'arrogance', 'few', 'Rangers', 'admit', 'needed', 'help', 'cityfight', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'other', 'troops', 'think', 'are', 'lessers', 'lack', 'technotactical', 'humility', 'admit', 'BDU', 'uniforms', 'Ranger', 'tabs', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'bullets', 'resulted', 'call-for-help', 'not', 'being', 'immediately', 'sent', 'snatch', 'grab', 'timetable', 'was', 'untenable', 'having', 'what-if', 'plan', 'realized', 'weakness', 'rubber', 'tired', 'wheeled', 'vehicles', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'enemy', 'fire', 'incorporate', 'tracked', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'available', 'U.N.', 'allies', 'short-term', 'long-term', 'permanently', 'Army', 'Ranger/SOF', 'force', 'structure', 'world', 'urbanizing', 'so', 'Somalia-type', 'environments', 'are', 'RULE', 'not', 'exception', '-high', 'value', 'targets', 'are', 'heavily', 'defended', 'need', 'SHOCK', 'ACTION', 'tracked', 'tanks', 'not', 'just', 'infiltrating', 'unarmored', 'commandos', 'can', 'be', 'pinned', 'down', 'enemy', 'fire', 'once', 'surprise', 'lost', 'writing', 'Ranger/SOF', 'community', 'still', 'not', 'incorporated', 'light', 'tracked', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'force', 'mix', 'so', '9', 'years', 'Somalia', 'are', 'excuse.Courageous', 'men', 'deserve', 'courageous', 'thinking', 'unpleasant', 'realities', 'solves', 'problems', 'viewer', 'watch', 'film', 'conclude', 'correctly', 'snatch', 'grab', 'had', 'ground', 'link-up', 'force', 'composed', 'tracked', 'armored', 'vehicles', 'trial', 'error', 'had', 'be', 'sent', 'anyway', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Black', 'Hawks', 'down', 'have', 'benefited', 'greatly', 'movie']",N/A

497903,A2GGKOW82LTDC5,B00000F3KL,Scott Andrew Hutchins,"[2, 15]","So this film is better than Scott's _Gladiator_, which isn't saying much, _Gladiator_ being up there with _Rocky_ and _The Greatest Show on Earth_ as films least deserving of Best Picture, and it has a good cast including Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Orlando Bloom, Sam Shepard, and Tom Sizemore, but if I had been one of those rangers, I'd feel insulted by this movie, despite the tribute to the fallen officers at the end, which seem more to give the picture clout.  Note only the Americans who died are listed, and none of the over 1000 Somalis.  Just who was this war about, anyway?This is one of the worst war movies ever made. It's 2 hours of video game action and 5 minutes of character development, and 10 minutes of credits. All the best war movies let you get to know the characters, and this does it less than the most stereotypical films, do, and only then in the worst way possible, in the form of what Stanley Kubrick called the ""mandatory"" scenes he and his source novel avoided in _Full Metal Jacket_. That created a film with much richer characters and much more believable fights in just under 2 hours. _Black Hawk Down_ has none of what made _Full Metal Jacket_, or _Platoon_, or _Catch-22_, or _MASH_, or _Three Kings_, or _No Man's Land_, or even Armando Crispino's _Commandos_ so good. In _Full Metal Jacket_, the Viet Cong were an unseen enemy. Here, the Somalis are the evil hordes of _Dawn of the Dead_, a mass of savages, or ""skinnies"" as they're called, who are there to be slaughtered in a war that was supposed to help the people. The few Somali we see as more than cannon fodder are melodramatic villains ill-befitting a realistic film about war.None of the necessary irony that a failed mission needs to have comes through, nor any of the tragedy. Since we don't get to know these people at all, Scott goes the Paul Verhoeven route by having them die the most gruesome ways possible--getting halved, a severed finger, an exploding body that looks straight out of _Dawn of the Dead_ (why is Scott getting good work when Romero is getting DTV?).When someone is severely abused by the system, such as Alex Murphy in Verhoeven's _RoboCop_, a gruesome death can work effectively as a means for gaining sympathy, but routine horrific war violence has minimal impact without giving good definition to the characters who are being harmed. _Saving Private Ryan_ gave us graphic war violence, even if some of it was a little over the top (the guy picking up his own arm in a lame reference to Kurosawa's _Ran_, which probably should have been snipped), but it gave us characters to focus on who were viewing on this, and we learned more about them as the film progressed, and even while it relied on the tired one-of-each style, they were fleshed-out characters. These are ciphers.On the technical point, the CGI is far less noticeable than it is in _Gladiator_. The artificiality of all the scenes made that film feel like a video game because of the look, even though the bad writing was pure Hollywood. This film is a live-action video game with ""cinema scenes"" to advance the story. All of this exemplifies why Jerry Bruckheimer productions [stink] and why he ought to be involved in video game development. His style is inherently distancing since it fits in so well with interactive media, and watching video games without playing them is rarely exciting for me anymore, and this film was unrelenting tedium. Maybe I grew up and Bruckheimer didn't. Scott should have known better, but he was never that great a director, and it's all been downhill for him since _Blade Runner_, despite the honors he has undeservedly received. Maybe Bruckheimer picked him because he shares his first name with a space pirate in the _Metroid_ video games, since video games are all he seems to understand.Almost everyone I know had a similar reaction to this film, but it kept coming up in my Amazon ratings, and got largely good reviews, so I gave the film a look. Critics have to watch hundreds of films a year, and so perhaps they'd be best equipped to compare due to having that broader knowledge base. Why this picture struck so many so strongly when so many war films in recent memory are so much better I don't understand. Perhaps the convergence of cinema and video games has become so strong that what I regard as tastelessness and simple-mindedness is now regarded as classy.

Tice ""imstice""","[1, 1]","What others don't understand about this movie who are ripping it for not having character development is that it was based off of a book by Mark Bowden that was completely fact based.  Black Hawk Down is not another one of those Titanic or Pearl Harbor chick flicks that claims to be based on facts but uses up 1 1/2 hours of a 2 hour movie to tell a love story, it comes right out with the cold hard facts and tells it like it is.  I would clasify Black Hawk Down as more of a documentary because it stays so true to history.  That is what I love about it, it's not trying to add in love stories and cheesy humor for the People and Entertainment Weekly readers out there.  This movie is more for the historians out there and not so much for the E Entertainment Television viewers.It tells the story of a raid in 1993 to try to capture Mohamed Farrah Aided in the Bakara market place in Mogadishu, Somalia.  When this raid goes wrong US soldiers are trapped with a whole city of angry Somali's armed and ready to kill.  It is one of the most intense movies I think I've ever seen, two hours of non-stop intensity that only ends with a dozen or so soldiers having to run their way out of the city and back to a UN controlled safe point.  This is the battle that we saw the aftermath of when we woke up the next day to Somali's dragging half naked dead US soldiers through the streets of Mogadishu.  To pay respect to the men who served in this conflict and to those who paid the ultimate price I think Ridley Scott et al did the right thing by staying true to the facts and making this movie historically acurate.  For all those that want to see a war movie that does it right, that puts you in the middle of the action and doesn't stray from the facts, then Black Hawk Down is a must see.  For all those that want to see Josh Hartnett in another Pearl Harbor role, go see something else because this movie will disappoint.",5,One of the best true to life movies ever!!!!!!!,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,1922,"['What', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'movie', 'who', 'are', 'ripping', 'not', 'having', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'was', 'completely', 'fact', 'based', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'not', 'one', 'Titanic', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'chick', 'flicks', 'be', 'based', 'facts', 'up', '1', '1/2', 'hours', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'tell', 'love', 'story', 'right', 'cold', 'hard', 'facts', 'would', 'clasify', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'more', 'documentary', 'so', 'true', 'history', 'what', 'love', 'not', 'trying', 'add', 'love', 'stories', 'cheesy', 'humor', 'People', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'out', 'there', 'movie', 'more', 'historians', 'there', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'E', 'Entertainment', 'Television', 'viewers.It', 'story', 'raid', '1993', 'try', 'capture', 'Mohamed', 'Farrah', 'Aided', 'Bakara', 'market', 'place', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia', 'When', 'raid', 'wrong', 'US', 'soldiers', 'are', 'trapped', 'whole', 'city', 'angry', 'Somali', 'armed', 'ready', 'kill', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'movies', 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'two', 'hours', 'non-stop', 'intensity', 'only', 'dozen', 'so', 'soldiers', 'having', 'run', 'way', 'city', 'back', 'UN', 'controlled', 'safe', 'point', 'battle', 'saw', 'aftermath', 'when', 'woke', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'Somali', 'dragging', 'half', 'naked', 'dead', 'US', 'soldiers', 'streets', 'Mogadishu', 'pay', 'respect', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'conflict', 'who', 'paid', 'ultimate', 'price', 'think', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'al', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'staying', 'true', 'facts', 'making', 'movie', 'historically', 'acurate', 'want', 'see', 'war', 'movie', 'right', 'middle', 'action', ""n't"", 'stray', 'facts', 'then', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'must', 'see', 'want', 'see', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'role', 'go', 'see', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'will', 'disappoint']",N/A
497905,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00000F3KL,Sesho,"[0, 0]","Like Ridley Scott's last film, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down is also about the way of the warrior. Unlike the former, the bloodshed and motive for it has a much more complicated motive in Hawk. IN 1993 members of the American Rangers and Delta Force are sent into a hostile somalian neighborhood to capture the top lieutenants of a local warlord. This local warlord is holding a stranglehold on the city's food supply, funneling it to his armies. Anytime you take sides in a civil war, you're going to get bloody. The worst place to get involved in a firefight has to be in the middle of a city. There's so many places for snipers to pick you off from. Every window and corner becomes a hiding place of death.They capture who they were looking for but soon after that a copter is downed by a missle laucher and the carefully laid plan to get out of the area falls to pieces. The Americans find themselves stuck in the middle of thousands of hostile Somalis.This was a great movie. All the performances and special effects were right on. No one actor really stands out to me. It was more of an ensemble piece. Eric Bana, who happens to be filming The Incredible Hulk right now does a good job as a hardened veteran who seems to have a sixth sense about war. Also, William Fichtner is attention grabbing as the Delta Force leader. Josh Hartnett, the clone of Chris Klein and Keanu Reeves, is better than usual, which isn't saying a lot. Tom Sizemore does his best impression of Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now as a general who never flinches and walks through bullets as if they were rain.Actually, this movie reminded me a lot of Apocalypse just in terms of showing the utter chaos of war. The big ad campaign and the slogan said over and over again in the movie is ""Leave no Man behind"". It's almost religious doctrine. The problem is that should you go back to get a man even though you lose even more men in the process who you in turn have to save and then more men get killed and you have to rescue them and so on.......Ridley Scott through his tone and the dialogue of the characters seems to ask the question ""What were we doing there?"", meaning that we should not have got involved. In that way, this film seems very anti-war. Violence was glorified in Gladiator in the name of revenge but here it's not. It's kinda disturbing because we got involved over there for humanitarian reasons and I just seemed to get this suggestion from the film that it was just another Vietnam. Somalia was not about ideology. It was about saving starving people.The DVD says it has ""special features"" but really the only bonus is a short featurette about the making of the movie. It's kinda funny that ""animated menus"" and ""scene selections"" are listed too. Something really humorous was the ""theatrical trailers"" which you would think would be those of Black Hawk Down. They're not. They're trailers for Jet Li's The One and Spider-Man. Also, you have the option of turning on Chinese or Thai subtitles.  The picture and sound are excellent. You only have the choice of 5.1. I have a sneaking suspicion that another deluxe version of the DVD will come out one day. This is the bare essentials DVD. Why am I complaining? In the end it's the film that matters.In the end I am very proud of our armed forces. I was in college when the actual incident took place and I didn't remember a lot about it so I was glad I could really be educated and see the sacrifices that were made and the heroism those guys and girls in our armed forces have to exhibit. Of course, I need to read the book now and get the unHollywoodish version of the story.",3,ANYONE REMEMBER THE ALAMO?,1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,3623,"['Ridley', 'Scott', 'last', 'film', 'Gladiator', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'also', 'way', 'warrior', 'former', 'bloodshed', 'motive', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'motive', 'Hawk', 'IN', '1993', 'members', 'American', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'are', 'sent', 'hostile', 'somalian', 'neighborhood', 'capture', 'top', 'lieutenants', 'local', 'warlord', 'local', 'warlord', 'holding', 'stranglehold', 'city', 'food', 'supply', 'funneling', 'armies', 'Anytime', 'take', 'sides', 'civil', 'war', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'bloody', 'worst', 'place', 'get', 'involved', 'firefight', 'be', 'middle', 'city', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'snipers', 'pick', 'off', 'Every', 'window', 'corner', 'hiding', 'place', 'death.They', 'capture', 'who', 'were', 'looking', 'soon', 'copter', 'downed', 'missle', 'laucher', 'carefully', 'laid', 'plan', 'get', 'area', 'pieces', 'Americans', 'find', 'stuck', 'middle', 'thousands', 'hostile', 'Somalis.This', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'performances', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'right', 'one', 'actor', 'really', 'out', 'was', 'more', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'who', 'be', 'filming', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'right', 'now', 'good', 'job', 'hardened', 'veteran', 'who', 'have', 'sixth', 'sense', 'war', 'Also', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'Delta', 'Force', 'leader', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'clone', 'Chris', 'Klein', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'better', 'usual', ""n't"", 'saying', 'lot', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'best', 'impression', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'general', 'who', 'never', 'flinches', 'walks', 'through', 'bullets', 'were', 'rain.Actually', 'movie', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Apocalypse', 'just', 'terms', 'showing', 'utter', 'chaos', 'war', 'big', 'ad', 'campaign', 'slogan', 'said', 'over', 'again', 'movie', 'Leave', 'Man', 'almost', 'religious', 'doctrine', 'problem', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'get', 'man', 'even', 'lose', 'even', 'more', 'men', 'process', 'who', 'turn', 'have', 'save', 'then', 'more', 'men', 'get', 'killed', 'have', 'rescue', 'so', '.Ridley', 'Scott', 'tone', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'ask', 'question', 'What', 'were', 'doing', 'there', 'meaning', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'got', 'involved', 'way', 'film', 'very', 'anti-war', 'Violence', 'was', 'glorified', 'Gladiator', 'name', 'revenge', 'here', 'not', 'kinda', 'disturbing', 'got', 'involved', 'there', 'humanitarian', 'reasons', 'just', 'seemed', 'get', 'suggestion', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'Vietnam', 'Somalia', 'was', 'not', 'ideology', 'was', 'saving', 'starving', 'people.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'really', 'only', 'bonus', 'short', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'kinda', 'funny', 'animated', 'menus', 'scene', 'selections', 'are', 'listed', 'too', 'Something', 'really', 'humorous', 'was', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', ""'re"", 'not', ""'re"", 'trailers', 'Jet', 'Li', 'One', 'Spider-Man', 'Also', 'have', 'option', 'turning', 'Chinese', 'Thai', 'subtitles', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'excellent', 'only', 'have', 'choice', '5.1', 'have', 'sneaking', 'suspicion', 'deluxe', 'version', 'DVD', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'one', 'day', 'bare', 'DVD', 'Why', 'am', 'complaining', 'end', 'film', 'end', 'am', 'very', 'proud', 'armed', 'forces', 'was', 'college', 'when', 'actual', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'lot', 'so', 'was', 'glad', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'educated', 'see', 'sacrifices', 'were', 'made', 'heroism', 'guys', 'girls', 'armed', 'forces', 'have', 'exhibit', 'course', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'now', 'get', 'unHollywoodish', 'version', 'story']",N/A

497907,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00000F3KL,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[219, 248]","This is a phenominal film. I'm sad to say that I was fairly oblivious to the conflict in Somalia... I was working 3rd shift and sleeping during the day in 1993 when this incedent took place.  This film could not have been more timely in its release... when long dormant patriotism has been brought to the forefront of every American's thoughts.Now that we've been attacked on our own soil, conflicts overseas seem that much more real to us.In 1993, the Islamic leader and warlord of Somalia, Muhammad Farrah Aidid, led with fear and tyranny. His henchmen were equipped with what appeared to be limitless weapons -- large machine guns, shoulder rockets, pistols, and many automatic and semi-automatic weapons. They enlist even the youngest and most innocent of their populace to help them spy and keep in constant contact via cell phone. Aidid stopped international aid from reaching his own people, killing 300,000 by starvation and the onslaught of civil war.Washington sent in their military forces to remove Aidid from power and to prevent the Somali people from having to endure more suffering under Aidid's iron grasp. Sadly, Washington didn't want to ""look too dramatic"" and denied military requests for C130 gun ships and other heavy artillery that certainly would have made a big difference on the outcome of this event.Army Rangers, pilots, medics, the famous Delta Force, the pride of America was there, fighting for the freedom of a people they did not know.This film is the realistic portrayal of the events that led to the deaths of 19 U.S. servicemen... but it's not just a shoot 'em up movie. You feel like you're there, with them. What should have been a mission that was to last only 30 minutes, lasted longer than anyone imagined when a single Somali soldier downs a Black Hawk rotor with a shoulder-launched rocket... and the Ranger motto, ""no one gets left behind,"" is tested to the limits.There are some humorous moments to break the tension, but the majority of the film is a stressful experience where you are literally at the edge of your seat to see what happens next.The 19 servicemen that are killed range the gamut from 18 year old enlistees to First Sergeants with years of service... and none of them dies in a pretty way. If you are made queasy by blood, beware... this is a bloody film... and there are a number of scenes that will make you gasp in horror. Some of these guys were hit by rockets... burned and blown apart... it's just awful, but sadly... it's reality.  We usually just hear some sterile figures on CNN how a particular number of soldiers were shot, stepped on land mines, etc... but we don't see what really happened and that's when we become very detached from reality and end up sympathizing with the people (often our enemies) we see in easier-to-stomach scenes of children living in squalor as a result of conflict, maligning Americans against their own military. Please note the rating of this film and consider it thoughtfully before considering bringing a child. The gore is horrific and the scenes are really too intense for young ones.For those who like shoot-em-ups and explosions, you won't be disappointed. The special effects are fantastic... there are a few scenes in the movie in which you feel like ducking as it appears a missile is ready to whiz right over your shoulder.  The sound is fantastic... you can hear and feel the bullets whizzing by and you can hear the klinking of shells falling at your feet. The foley artists on this film are to be commended.Hans Zimmer delivers a wonderful and complimentary score to the movie... along with the sounds of African children singing and some rock-n-roll to boot... it's a nice soundtrack.Ridley Scott reminds us once again his flair for delivering crisp, vivid scenes that are riveting, exciting and moving all at the same time.Watching this film is an emotional and intense experience that will leave you tired when it's over... but images from the screen will replay in your head several times.  These soldiers trained hard to become Rangers and to be part of the Delta Force... these are young men that know what dangers await them and they go in with their eyes wide open... and they are prepared to defend their buddies with their lives. In many ways, this film is a monument to their strength, their courage and their loyalty.  Those 19 men should not be forgotten.  This film is also a testament to the necessity of properly arming and equipping our soldiers so that they have the best protection needed when engaged in conflict and worrying less about appearances and more about protecting American lives, both military and civilian.I highly recommend this film.",5,"""No one gets left behind...""",1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,4685,"['phenominal', 'film',

And that sums up the subject matter of BLACK HAWK DOWN perfectly.These are not soldiers, not as so recently portrayed in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS. For the most part they stand around as targets, awaiting rescue (refreshingly; this sort of inaction is usually reserved for women's roles) or instructions from on-high before taking a step, preferring having body parts pure&eacute;d to thinking or taking responsibility for their own survival. Foul-up compounds foul-up. And for what?Sympathy for most of the characters is hard to come by. Maybe they're doing time in lieu of paying for college or simply have no clue of their life's direction. That's not uncommon and no condemnation, truly. But it's surely a disclaimer anyone considering the armed forces should heed: We reserve the right to fold, spindle, and mutilate your very flesh; no glorious or noble sacrifice assured.Again, this is a sparkling production, lovely to behold were it more fictitious.

497914,A3CYS74ICMQGF7,B00000F3KL,S. Smith,"[10, 12]","Black Hawk Down is a movie that has provoked a curiously mixed response from people.  While most of the credible critics (e.g. Roger Ebert, Peter Travers) rightly gave it high marks, a few well known critics tore into it.  Almost all the negative reviews are characterized by an ignorance of the movie's historical source material, or some kind of extreme political/ideological ax to grind on their part.  This is unfortunate, because Ridley Scott (an Englishman, incidentally) has crafted what may be the definitive war film.Black Hawk Down is one thing, and one thing only: a realistic depiction of the Battle of Mogadishu, principally from the point of view of Task Force Ranger.  It is not an overtly political film, and I think this bothered some critics of a certain leftist  or anti-military bent.  By depicting bloodthirsty warlords as... bloodthirsty warlords... it will probably offend those who want to blame every possible bad thing that ever happened to anybody anywhere on American malice.  Likewise, the fact that it treats the people who fought in the battle with a certain respect will offend people accustomed to thinking of American soldiers as baby-killers, or whatever.However, a critic would have to be literally deranged to consider this a jingoistic film glorifying war.  This is by far the most awful, horrifying and real depiction of war I've ever seen on film.  That includes Saving Private Ryan and We Were Soldiers.  I like fun action movies with senseless violence and destruction, and this movie is one of the least fun things I've ever seen.  Combat is depicted, rightly, as a chaotic nightmare.  I don't see how someone can be a decent human being and enjoy the violence in this film, or interpret it as something that was meant to be enjoyed.  To think that Ridley Scott meant this to be cheesey fun along the lines of other Jerry Bruckheimer-produced flicks would require you to be friggin' insane.  This film is deliberately, unflinchingly brutal.  It is almost saying, ""Look, you fat lazy bastards, THIS is what it means to send your soldiers to war.  THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS.""  And it has no happy ending, because the real battle didn't, either.Incidentally, it doesn't let anybody ""off the hook"" for how the operation went bad and wound up costing so many lives.  Although not a treatise on military planning and tactics, it is clear from the film that there were fatal delays associated with U.S. forces depending on U.N. contingents for heavy ground support, and the proper contingency planning for the sort of thing that happened really hadn't taken place.To sum up, this film is quite simply the most honest attempt to depict the actual conditions of combat that I have ever seen.  I think ""honest"" really is the operative word.  The lack of Hollywood-imposed cheese on the reality of the story is something I found very refreshing.  It spoke of a certain respect for the people involved, something I appreciate as someone who was in the military myself.The 3-disk set is packed with extras, all very good ones.  You get 3 commentary tracks (Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer, Mark Bowden and the screenwriter, and several veterans of the battle), all of which are excellent.  You get a documentary about making the movie almost as long as the movie itself, which is very good.  And you get several historical documentaries about the Battle of Mogadishu by PBS and The History Channel.  Aside from being good quality, what impressed me about the bonus materials was the impression I got that the cast and crew were determined to NOT be cheesey Hollywood scumbags about the movie, or inject thier own personal halfwit politics into the picture.  They really seemed sincere about just wanting to do justice to the real-life people and events they were depicting.I think they did right.",5,The definitive war film,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,3825,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'movie', 'provoked', 'curiously', 'mixed', 'response', 'people', 'most', 'credible', 'critics', 'e.g', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'rightly', 'gave', 'high', 'marks', 'few', 'well', 'known', 'critics', 'tore', 'Almost', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'characterized', 'ignorance', 'movie', 'historical', 'source', 'material', 'kind', 'extreme', 'political/ideological', 'ax', 'grind', 'part', 'unfortunate', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Englishman', 'incidentally', 'crafted', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'definitive', 'war', 'film.Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'thing', 'only', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'Battle', 'Mogadishu', 'principally', 'point', 'view', 'Task', 'Force', 'Ranger', 'not', 'overtly', 'political', 'film', 'think', 'bothered', 'critics', 'certain', 'leftist', 'anti-military', 'bent', 'depicting', 'bloodthirsty', 'warlords', 'bloodthirsty', 'warlords', 'will', 'probably', 'offend', 'who', 'want', 'blame', 'possible', 'bad', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'anybody', 'anywhere', 'American', 'malice', 'Likewise', 'fact', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'battle', 'certain', 'respect', 'will', 'offend', 'people', 'accustomed', 'thinking', 'American', 'soldiers', 'baby-killers', 'whatever.However', 'critic', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'literally', 'deranged', 'consider', 'jingoistic', 'film', 'glorifying', 'war', 'far', 'most', 'awful', 'horrifying', 'real', 'depiction', 'war', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Were', 'Soldiers', 'like', 'fun', 'action', 'movies', 'senseless', 'violence', 'destruction', 'movie', 'one', 'least', 'fun', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Combat', 'depicted', 'rightly', 'chaotic', 'nightmare', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'can', 'be', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'enjoy', 'violence', 'film', 'interpret', 'something', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'meant', 'be', 'cheesey', 'fun', 'lines', 'other', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer-produced', 'flicks', 'would', 'require', 'be', 'friggin', 'insane', 'film', 'deliberately', 'unflinchingly', 'brutal', 'almost', 'saying', 'Look', 'fat', 'lazy', 'bastards', 'THIS', 'what', 'send', 'soldiers', 'war', 'THIS', 'WHAT', 'IT', 'MEANS', 'happy', 'ending', 'real', 'battle', 'did', ""n't"", 'either.Incidentally', ""n't"", 'let', 'anybody', 'hook', 'how', 'operation', 'went', 'bad', 'wound', 'up', 'costing', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'not', 'treatise', 'military', 'planning', 'tactics', 'clear', 'film', 'were', 'fatal', 'delays', 'associated', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'depending', 'U.N.', 'contingents', 'heavy', 'ground', 'support', 'proper', 'contingency', 'planning', 'sort', 'thing', 'happened', 'really', 'had', ""n't"", 'taken', 'place.To', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'quite', 'simply', 'most', 'honest', 'attempt', 'depict', 'actual', 'conditions', 'combat', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'think', 'honest', 'really', 'operative', 'word', 'lack', 'Hollywood-imposed', 'cheese', 'reality', 'story', 'something', 'found', 'very', 'refreshing', 'spoke', 'certain', 'respect', 'people', 'involved', 'something', 'appreciate', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'military', 'myself.The', '3-disk', 'set', 'packed', 'extras', 'very', 'good', 'ones', 'get', '3', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'screenwriter', 'several', 'veterans', 'battle', 'are', 'excellent', 'get', 'documentary', 'making', 'movie', 'almost', 'as', 'long', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'get', 'several', 'historical', 'documentaries', 'Battle', 'Mogadishu', 'PBS', 'History', 'Channel', 'Aside', 'being', 'good', 'quality', 'what', 'impressed', 'bonus', 'materials', 'was', 'impression', 'got', 'cast', 'crew', 'were', 'determined', 'NOT', 'be', 'cheesey', 'Hollywood', 'scumbags', 'movie', 'inject', 'thier', 'own', 'personal', 'halfwit', 'politics', 'picture', 'really', 'seemed', 'sincere', 'about', 'just', 'wanting', 'do', 'justice', 'real-life', 'people', 'events', 'were', 'depicting.I', 'think', 'did', 'right']",N/A

Based on the sadly true story of a 1993 U.S. military operation gone sour in Somalia, the film nonetheless feels devoid of much plot or character:  it's mostly a lot of combat in the cavalry-surrounded-by-Indians vein, some of it gripping, some not.  In terms of execution, it's reminiscent of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (and the last 20 minutes of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;).  However, things worked better in the D-Day film (which also featured Tom Sizemore and was filmed in a similar high-contrast style) because Spielberg worked harder to establish his characters, stock as they were, so we'd care about their ultimate fates.  But other than some macho ""styling and profiling"" scenes early in this film, there's not much effort to differentiate the soldiers here, who for the most also look irritatingly the same with their gear and shaved heads.  Because the characters feel more or less like extensions of the military equipment, like toy soldiers on the kitchen table, many of the film's ""emotional"" scenes lack punch.  Oscar-caliber acting, therefore, is neither required nor expected, and the cast of mostly young faces--Ewan MacGregor, Josh Hartnett, William Fichtner, and others--delivers what is necessary and not much more, with wrinkly Sam Shepherd his usual cowboy self.  What keeps &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; alive is how the soldiers' predicament goes from bad to worse; what keeps your attention is the verisimilitude of the fighting scenes, particularly in the last half of the film, though, again, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; scores higher in most regards.  That leaves a collage of scenes that are too stylized to be documentary and too ""realistic"" to be a standard Hollywood outing.  Based as it is on real events, the film still reduces conflicts to their most simplistic level--the technological might of the U.S. soldiers versus the wily determination of the enemy mobs; the streetsmart blue-collar grunts versus the incompetent egghead analysts in charge; the nearly all-white soldiers versus the all-black hordes of Somalis, etc.  Though composer Hans Zimmer repeats a lot from The Thin Red Line, much of the music fits, even the requisite pop songs.  The mixed result is a passable war film that, at least, tries to honor the memory of those who died, even if we never really get to know most of these men in meaningful ways.",3,"Lots of Fighting, Not Much Story or Character",1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,2472,"['many', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'films', 'quot', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'functions', 'best', 'style', 'substance', 'Based', 'sadly', 'true', 'story', '1993', 'U.S.', 'military', 'operation', 'gone', 'sour', 'Somalia', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'feels', 'devoid', 'much', 'plot', 'character', 'mostly', 'lot', 'combat', 'cavalry-surrounded-by-Indians', 'vein', 'gripping', 'not', 'terms', 'execution', 'reminiscent', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'quot', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'quot', 'However', 'things', 'worked', 'better', 'D-Day', 'film', 'also', 'featured', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'was', 'filmed', 'similar', 'high-contrast', 'style', 'Spielberg', 'worked', 'harder', 'establish', 'characters', 'stock', 'were', ""'d"", 'care', 'ultimate', 'fates', 'other', 'macho', 'styling', 'profiling', 'scenes', 'early', 'film', 'not', 'much', 'effort', 'differentiate', 'soldiers', 'here', 'who', 'most', 'also', 'look', 'irritatingly', 'same', 'gear', 'shaved', 'heads', 'characters', 'feel', 'more', 'less', 'extensions', 'military', 'equipment', 'toy', 'soldiers', 'kitchen', 'table', 'many', 'film', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'lack', 'punch', 'Oscar-caliber', 'acting', 'therefore', 'neither', 'required', 'expected', 'cast', 'mostly', 'young', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'others', 'delivers', 'what', 'necessary', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'wrinkly', 'Sam', 'Shepherd', 'usual', 'cowboy', 'self', 'What', 'quot', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'quot', 'alive', 'how', 'soldiers', 'predicament', 'bad', 'worse', 'what', 'attention', 'verisimilitude', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'though', 'again', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'higher', 'most', 'regards', 'collage', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'stylized', 'be', 'documentary', 'too', 'realistic', 'be', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'outing', 'Based', 'real', 'events', 'film', 'still', 'conflicts', 'most', 'simplistic', 'level', 'technological', 'might', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'versus', 'wily', 'determination', 'enemy', 'mobs', 'streetsmart', 'blue-collar', 'grunts', 'incompetent', 'egghead', 'analysts', 'charge', 'nearly', 'all-white', 'soldiers', 'all-black', 'hordes', 'Somalis', 'etc', 'composer', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'lot', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'much', 'music', 'even', 'requisite', 'pop', 'songs', 'mixed', 'result', 'passable', 'war', 'film', 'least', 'tries', 'honor', 'memory', 'who', 'died', 'even', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'most', 'men', 'meaningful', 'ways']",N/A
497917,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00000F3KL,Stephen M. Lerch,"[10, 17]","Since the other review currently on-line here at Amazon hits nicely on the movie itself, I'm not going to say much on that. The movie has the right amount of action and tension and tells a great (mostly) true story.As far as the Blu-Ray disc itself, Sony seems to have an aversion to the VC-1 codec and has instead opted to use MPEG-2 for this release (and House of Flying Daggers and also Talledega Nights). The inferiority shows in that the video contains some detail smearing grain which doesn't appear to be film grain (to me at least; I don't pretend to be an expert in this field). I compared this release to the House of Flying Dagger release which also suffers from the grain and lack of detail. Not the same movie, but it is an MPEG-2 Sony release. Comparing these both to Talledega Nights, you can see that Sony has been working to improve their video encoding as the problems are less obvious. Comparing these 3 releases to Corpse Bride, the only VC-1 title I own, and the difference is night and day.How bad is it? Well, my brother, who isn't an enthusiast by any means, walked in while I was watching Black Hawk Down and made the comment ""is this Blu Ray?"" When I replied in the affirmative, his response was ""doesn't look much better than the DVD."" Unfortunately I feel the same way.The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and also uncompressed LPCM multichannel. The LPCM sounds fantastic to say the least.So if you have the DVD and good upscaling DVD player, you might be able to avoid this release unless you want the EXCELLENT LPCM multichannel audio. The video is superior to the DVD, but probably not enough to justify purchasing the movie again on Blu-Ray unless you are a major fan.EDIT-- Since posting this review I've learned that the ""grain"" I mention in the review has to do with the film used for the movie, not with anything wrong in the authoring process. So what we are seeing is actually the movie as Ridley Scott would like us to see it.After doing ""side by side"" comparisons of the Blu-Ray disc and the DVD upscaled to 1080p, the Blu-Ray disc has a much clearer picture and better colors.If you don't have this one on DVD and want a great movie presented in a good HD package, pick this one up. If you already have the DVD though, assuming you aren't a huge fan of the movie, you probably still don't need to make the upgrade unless you are dissatisfied with the DVD's video/audio quality.",3,"Great movie, sub-par authoring",1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,2426,"['other', 'review', 'currently', 'on-line', 'here', 'Amazon', 'hits', 'nicely', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'much', 'movie', 'right', 'amount', 'action', 'tension', 'great', 'mostly', 'true', 'story.As', 'far', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'Sony', 'have', 'aversion', 'VC-1', 'codec', 'instead', 'opted', 'use', 'MPEG-2', 'release', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'also', 'Talledega', 'Nights', 'inferiority', 'video', 'detail', 'smearing', 'grain', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'film', 'grain', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'expert', 'field', 'compared', 'release', 'House', 'Flying', 'Dagger', 'release', 'also', 'grain', 'lack', 'detail', 'Not', 'same', 'movie', 'MPEG-2', 'Sony', 'release', 'Comparing', 'Talledega', 'Nights', 'can', 'see', 'Sony', 'been', 'working', 'improve', 'video', 'encoding', 'problems', 'are', 'less', 'obvious', 'Comparing', '3', 'releases', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'only', 'VC-1', 'title', 'own', 'difference', 'night', 'day.How', 'bad', 'Well', 'brother', 'who', ""n't"", 'enthusiast', 'means', 'walked', 'was', 'watching', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'made', 'comment', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'When', 'replied', 'affirmative', 'response', 'was', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'feel', 'same', 'way.The', 'audio', 'presented', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'also', 'uncompressed', 'LPCM', 'multichannel', 'LPCM', 'fantastic', 'say', 'least.So', 'have', 'DVD', 'good', 'upscaling', 'DVD', 'player', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'avoid', 'release', 'want', 'EXCELLENT', 'LPCM', 'multichannel', 'audio', 'video', 'superior', 'DVD', 'probably', 'not', 'enough', 'justify', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'again', 'Blu-Ray', 'are', 'major', 'fan.EDIT', 'posting', 'review', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'grain', 'mention', 'review', 'do', 'film', 'used', 'movie', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'authoring', 'process', 'So', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'actually', 'movie', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'it.After', 'doing', 'side', 'side', 'comparisons', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'DVD', 'upscaled', '1080p', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'much', 'clearer', 'picture', 'better', 'colors.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'DVD', 'want', 'great', 'movie', 'presented', 'good', 'HD', 'package', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'assuming', 'are', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'movie', 'probably', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'upgrade', 'are', 'dissatisfied', 'DVD', 'video/audio', 'quality']",N/A

This will certainly irk viewers who would have preferred a more balanced rendering.  But what can we really expect?  This isn't an evening with Noam Chomsky, it's a Jerry Bruckheimer production.  And in the end, the resolute focus on ""our boys"" kind of works.

If you put yourself in the shoes of these soldiers, how could you not feel their fear and pain?  You find yourself wondering what it would be like if YOU were another one of these grunts doing Washington's dirty work without receiving adequate armored cover.  How would YOU, after coming out of the hellhole where the fighting was raging and making it safely back to the Army camp, feel about risking injury or death by plunging back into the war zone in order to try to save other Rangers -- would you have the courage to do it?  Could YOU jump into the unprotected gunner's seat on the tank after your fellow soldier had been shot there by snipers on the rooftops and in the buildings?  How would YOU face an angry crowd coming to kill you if you were alone, weaponless, had a broken leg, and were propped sitting against a wall?  This movie is one gut-check after another.  To not be absorbed by these questions is to fail to imaginatively project oneself into the action.""Blackhawk Down"" is about courage and extreme sacrifice.  These terms too often are abstract notions mouthed in platitudes.  We civilians need films such as this one to remind us in frank and brutal terms what it is to put our soldiers in harm's way.  Perhaps this film will remind us to show our soldiers more respect and either send them in to do a job with all of the tools and support they need or not send them in at all.This is a director's film, and Ridley deserves to get a run at the best director Oscar.  You won't remember the acting, but you will remember the extraordinary battle sequences and Ridley's skill in making the theater operations clear despite the fog of war.  In some ways this movie is like an extended version of the storming of the beaches of Normandy in ""Saving Private Ryan"": intense, violent, ""you are there"" war cinema.Perhaps what surprised me the most was just how involved, widespread, and long the fighting was.  From the news reports of 1993 I got the impression that all of the fighting had happened in one square and for a much shorter period of time.  After seeing this movie, I finally saw how wrong I was and understood that these soldiers had gone through an experience as intense as in any war the USA fought.  That a thousand Somalis died in this battle shows how large it was.One poignant aspect of this movie is that the USA never went back to punish Aidid's men, who killed 19 of our soldiers.  In fact, we pulled out of Somalia shortly after the battle ended.  Ben Laden has said that our turning-tail and running encouraged him to believe that the USA was a paper tiger unwilling to bear casualties.  This emboldened him to attack us on September 11, our new day of infamy.",5,IS WAR HELL?

The presentation of the bald facts--American soldiers, trying to ram humanitarian aid through the barriers thrown up by a genocidal warlord, shooting it out with said warlord's gunmen--stuck in the lefties' craw in the worst way.  ""Jingoism!"" ""Flag-waving!"" ""Ethnocentrism!"" ""Lack of historical context!"" And on and on, as they recoiled from the filmic depiction of the American martial virtues, like vampires fleeing the sunrise.  Going through old reviews, I saw that they much preferred things like the ambiguities of the anachronistic hippy-dips in The Thin Red Line.  The notion of a big-budget major studio film made in the 21st century that, without so much as a hiccup of nuance, takes the American military's side against a Third World enemy, left them completely flabbergasted with outrage.Black Hawk Down is about duty, honor, fighting for the buddy next to you, and not much more.  Its documentary value aside, it is primarily an actioner, though one which never veers into cartoonish Stallone territory.  The film advances no judgment on the merits of the American presence in Somalia, but neither does it cater to liberals, anxiously waiting for the reassuring moral equivalence to kick in.There is a surprising amount of humor here, even in the battle scenes, such as when a Ranger and two Delta operators decoy and ambush a Somali bazooka shooter.The sets are letter-perfect, and the special effects are always in the service of the story, never taking center stage for their gee-whiz value.  Only once or twice do the filmmakers switch to slo-mo, to highlight some appalling disaster or other.  And this film is LOUD!  At two hours plus, your ringing ears can only marvel that the actual battle lasted 16 hours.One quibble I have is with the casting of the Somalis.  The gunmen are all sub-Saharan Africans in appearance, not at all resembling the aquiline, gracile faces of the ethnicities from the Horn of Africa.  It's as if Japanese extras were playing the Cambodians in The Killing Fields.The only other false note comes at the end, when a couple of the Rangers discuss the nature of patriotism and valor under fire.  I have no first hand knowledge, but I've always imagined combat soldiers leaving such things strictly unsaid.Before Mark Bowden wrote the book Black Hawk Down, the Army supposedly had never even written an after-action report of the battle.

497930,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00000F3KL,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[3, 4]","Director:  Ridley ScottCast:  Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard, Ewen Bremer, Tom Hardy, Ron Eldard, Charlie Hofheimer.Running Time:  144 minutesRated R for extreme war violence, gore, and language.When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 1970's, four of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"", Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"", and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". These few movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that ""Gladiator"" director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, ""Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War"", filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.  The film is set in Somalia during the country's civil war and valiantly depicts the Battle of Mogadishu on which ""Black Hawk Down"" is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely awry as two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down. Things go from bad to worse as the rangers find themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal is to shoot any American soldier that invades their space. After ""stirring up the hornet's nest"", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the rangers motto, ""Leave no man behind"".As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.  Ridley Scott organizes a fantastic cast in discreet fashion, not diving into the personalities of each of the characters, explaining their family situation, or boring the viewer with petty dialogue.  The director sets the stage for the mission, thrusts the cast into the eye of the storm, and allows the horrors of that October afternoon unfold.  The performances form the ensemble cast are very solid, with Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett as the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best scenes in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant as a coffee intern turned soldier, but his ""Trainspotting"" compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.As expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out. As is typical in Scott's recent movies, there is lots of flying dust, rubble and debris mixed with slow motion shots of falling bullet casings and splattered blood.  ""Black Hawk Down"" is quite an achievement in creating a realistic representation of an event in recent history. Most of this movie leaves the viewer aghast and incredulous of what they're watching, and it's hard to believe that something like this could possibly happen. Technically, this movie is an amazing feat that gives the viewer one of the most realistic impressions of what it would feel like to be in the middle of a war, which makes the atrocities of the event seem all the more real.  Although ""Black Hawk"" may not have the superb screenplay of a ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the irreplaceable performances of ""Apocalypse Now"", but if there is anything that the film has over all of them, it is its near perfect, truthful rendition of the horrible events that took place on that fateful, horrific day.",4,Black Hawk Down  (2001),1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,4023,"['Director', 'Ridley', 'ScottCast', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Ewen', 'Bremer', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Charlie', 'Hofheimer.Running', 'Time', '144', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'extreme', 'war', 'violence', 'gore', 'language.When', 'talking', 'war', 'movies', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'ones', 'immediately', 'spring', 'mind', '1970', 'four', 'have', 'formed', 'bit', 'holy', 'trinity', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Platoon', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'set', 'bar', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'then', 'When', 'was', 'announced', 'Gladiator', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'would', 'be', 'adapting', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'book', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'Story', 'Modern', 'War', 'filmgoers', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'treat', 'film', 'set', 'Somalia', 'country', 'civil', 'war', 'valiantly', 'Battle', 'Mogadishu', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'based', 'plan', 'seemed', 'simple', 'enough', 'Army', 'sent', 'Somalia', 'government', 'try', 'put', 'end', 'Civil', 'War', 'October', '3', '1993', 'group', 'were', 'sent', 'quick', 'mission', 'capture', 'Somali', 'warlord', 'had', 'been', 'running', 'country', 'iron', 'fist', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'operation', 'go', 'completely', 'awry', 'two', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopters', 'are', 'shot', 'down', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'rangers', 'find', 'surrounded', 'thousands', 'armed', 'Somalis', 'only', 'goal', 'shoot', 'American', 'soldier', 'space', 'stirring', 'up', 'hornet', 'nest', 'mission', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'maintain', 'rangers', 'motto', 'Leave', 'man', 'movie', 'tension', 'build', 'grim', 'unrelenting', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'soldiers', 'viewer', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'discreet', 'fashion', 'not', 'diving', 'personalities', 'characters', 'explaining', 'family', 'situation', 'boring', 'viewer', 'petty', 'dialogue', 'director', 'stage', 'mission', 'cast', 'eye', 'storm', 'horrors', 'October', 'afternoon', 'unfold', 'performances', 'form', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'very', 'solid', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'gung-ho', 'Lt.', 'McKnight', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'sergeant', 'who', 'mission', 'feels', 'personal', 'guilt', 'time', 'man', 'lost', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'also', 'excellent', 'Major', 'General', 'William', 'Garrison', 'who', 'back', 'safe', 'zone', 'watching', 'doomed', 'men', 'be', 'overpowered', 'enemy', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'part', 'small', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'really', 'driving', 'home', 'point', 'why', 'soldiers', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'role', 'even', 'more', 'minor', 'insignificant', 'coffee', 'intern', 'turned', 'soldier', 'Trainspotting', 'compatriot', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief.As', 'expected', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'film', 'visuals', 'camerawork', 'are', 'stunning', 'movie', 'having', 'gray', 'almost', 'monochromatic', 'look', 'orange', 'flames', 'red', 'blood', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'typical', 'Scott', 'recent', 'movies', 'lots', 'flying', 'dust', 'rubble', 'debris', 'mixed', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'falling', 'bullet', 'casings', 'splattered', 'blood', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'quite', 'achievement', 'creating', 'realistic', 'representation', 'event', 'recent', 'history', 'Most', 'movie', 'viewer', 'aghast', 'incredulous', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', 'hard', 'believe', 'something', 'could', 'possibly', 'happen', 'Technically', 'movie', 'amazing', 'feat', 'viewer', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'impressions', 'what', 'would', 'feel', 'be', 'middle', 'war', 'atrocities', 'event', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'superb', 'screenplay', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'irreplaceable', 'performances', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'anything', 'film', 'near', 'perfect', 'truthful', 'rendition', 'horrible', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'fateful', 'horrific', 'day']",N/A

497933,A1BN9LZB9575P3,B00000F3KL,Thomas Kearney,"[8, 8]","""Black Hawk Down"" is a gritty, uncompromising depiction of the events that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia when elements of Task Force Ranger and the Delta Force attempted to seize two members of Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid's cabinet in a raid meant to least no more than 30 minutes.  The operation came close to being pulled off successfully, until the downing of one of the Black Hawk helicopters throws the entire mission into disarray.The movie is based on Mark Bowden's book of the same name, though whereas Bowden does give some of the Somali point of view in his book, the film focuses squarely on the American Rangers and Deltas fighting for their very lives.  Some of the characters in the film are composites of two or more people.  For instance, Sgt. Eversmann, portrayed by Josh Hartnett, did not make it with his ""chalk"" to the Wolcott crash site, but instead rode with McKnight's ill fated Humvee convoy as it drove in vain throughout the streets of the ""Mog"" trying to get to the crash site.This movie is not for the squeamish or the faint of heart, with its frequent depictions of battlefield gore.  Once the raid itself begins about 40 minutes into the film, BHD basically becomes one nonstop battle scene that some viewers may find exhausting.  The performances from the ensemble cast are mostly good, including Josh Hartnett as the aforementioned Sgt. Eversmann, Eric Bana as Delta sniper Hoot (except for one brief slip, you would never know he's Australian), Tom Sizemore as Col. McKnight, William Fichtner (who is one of the greatest character actors around) as the Delta Sanderson, and Sam Shepard as the beleaguered General Garrison struggling to save his men from being massacred.  The only performance that I found less than convincing was the actor who played the Ranger Capt. Steele.  I think the actor who plays him is also Australian, and he didn't sound authentically American to me.Visually, the movie is stunning, which is a hallmark of Ridley Scott's films, and there are many images that will stay with the viewer after watching the film.  The scene where the choppers are flying over the beach of Mogadishu to drop off the Deltas and the Rangers may remind some of the helicopter attack scene in Apocalypse Now, the scrolling shot of the mosque at dawn as the call to the Muslims to pray is sung out, the strafing run by the choppers in the dark, the Somali man walking across the street with a dead child in his arms, and countless others.  The soundtrack is eclectic, switching from rock music to Middle Eastern sounds and vocals.The theme of the movie itself can best be summed up by two lines uttered by Hoot, ""Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all of that s--- goes out the window"" and ""It's all about the men next to you.""  BHD is not about whether our action in Somalia was right or wrong, it's about the men who fought there who find themselves forced to rely on their training and each other in order to survive in a desperate situation.As for the DVD itself, it is sadly lacking in special features, though I understand a special edition is coming out next year.  But the movie itself is definitely worth seeing to understand what our soldiers went through on that day, and for its unglamorous depiction of the ugliness that is war.",5,It's All About The Men Next To You,1032134400,"09 16, 2002",2002,3310,"['Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'gritty', 'uncompromising', 'depiction', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia', 'when', 'elements', 'Task', 'Force', 'Ranger', 'Delta', 'Force', 'attempted', 'seize', 'two', 'members', 'Somali', 'warlord', 'Mohammed', 'Farah', 'Aidid', 'cabinet', 'raid', 'meant', 'least', 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'operation', 'came', 'close', 'being', 'pulled', 'off', 'successfully', 'downing', 'one', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopters', 'entire', 'mission', 'disarray.The', 'movie', 'based', 'Mark', 'Bowden', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'whereas', 'Bowden', 'give', 'Somali', 'point', 'view', 'book', 'film', 'squarely', 'American', 'Rangers', 'Deltas', 'fighting', 'very', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'composites', 'two', 'more', 'people', 'instance', 'Sgt', 'Eversmann', 'portrayed', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'chalk', 'Wolcott', 'crash', 'site', 'instead', 'rode', 'McKnight', 'ill', 'fated', 'Humvee', 'convoy', 'drove', 'vain', 'streets', 'Mog', 'trying', 'get', 'crash', 'site.This', 'movie', 'not', 'squeamish', 'faint', 'heart', 'frequent', 'depictions', 'battlefield', 'gore', 'raid', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'BHD', 'basically', 'one', 'nonstop', 'battle', 'scene', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'exhausting', 'performances', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'mostly', 'good', 'including', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'aforementioned', 'Sgt', 'Eversmann', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'Delta', 'sniper', 'Hoot', 'one', 'brief', 'slip', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'Australian', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Col.', 'McKnight', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'who', 'one', 'greatest', 'character', 'actors', 'around', 'Delta', 'Sanderson', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'beleaguered', 'General', 'Garrison', 'struggling', 'save', 'men', 'being', 'massacred', 'only', 'performance', 'found', 'less', 'convincing', 'was', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Ranger', 'Capt', 'Steele', 'think', 'actor', 'who', 'also', 'Australian', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'authentically', 'American', 'me.Visually', 'movie', 'stunning', 'hallmark', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'films', 'are', 'many', 'images', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'watching', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'choppers', 'are', 'flying', 'beach', 'Mogadishu', 'drop', 'off', 'Deltas', 'Rangers', 'may', 'remind', 'helicopter', 'attack', 'scene', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'scrolling', 'shot', 'mosque', 'dawn', 'call', 'Muslims', 'pray', 'sung', 'out', 'strafing', 'run', 'choppers', 'dark', 'Somali', 'man', 'walking', 'street', 'dead', 'child', 'arms', 'countless', 'others', 'soundtrack', 'eclectic', 'switching', 'rock', 'music', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'vocals.The', 'theme', 'movie', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'two', 'lines', 'uttered', 'Hoot', 'Once', 'first', 'bullet', 'head', 'politics', 's', 'out', 'window', 'men', 'BHD', 'not', 'action', 'Somalia', 'was', 'right', 'wrong', 'men', 'who', 'fought', 'who', 'find', 'forced', 'rely', 'training', 'other', 'order', 'survive', 'desperate', 'situation.As', 'DVD', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'special', 'features', 'understand', 'special', 'edition', 'coming', 'out', 'next', 'year', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'understand', 'what', 'soldiers', 'went', 'day', 'unglamorous', 'depiction', 'ugliness', 'war']",N/A

One can find that the events portrayed and the way that they are portrayed can become more important than the actual impact of the film as an entertainment.The reality of the operation portrayed by the film was that the United States sent some peace keeping troops to Somalia, a country which had broken down to endemic civil war and had virtually ceased to function. The United States forces formed the view that this problem would be solved if some of the more major war lords were taken out of the equation. This film is about an attempt to kidnap the most important war lord in Somalia General Adid. The plan of the operation was to drop some highly trained troops by helicopter around a building. They were to arrest the war lord and then a convoy of vehicles was to remove him to the United States base. The operation went horribly wrong with two helicopters being shot down and the road convey getting lost. As a result a number of American soliders were killed and their bodies mutilated and dragged through the streets by the Somalis. Other troops held out and were rescued by a force of Malaysians the next morning. The operation like any real life situation contained confused elements. On one hand there was the bravery of the soldiers on the ground, both the United States soldiers who went through hell and also that of the Somalis. Whilst the individual soldiers and pilots acted generally in a way that was beyond what could reasonably be expected of them the planning of the operation and the concept behind it was deeply flawed.The film caters mainly to an American audience and for that reason it works to show the bravery of the American's involved. There can be no argument with this as they surely were. However the film tends to oversimplify the conflict by demonising the Somalis and by not looking at the sheer stupidity of what those soldiers had to go through. The reality is that the various deaths were for nothing as the United States forces were quickly pulled out. There are some minor reconstructions of history to downplay the role of the Malaysians and to suggest that the Americans had a greater role in the rescue than they in fact had.If we leave aside these minor historical quibbles the film is surprisingly effective. It conveys a complex series of battles in a way that is clear and lets the viewer understand what is happening. The portrayal of the actual fighting is also reasonably accurate. (Apart from what is said above some scences featuring Eric Banna are also made up)The film is also quite long, yet it passes quickly and one does not really have a sense of the time one is viewing it.

497946,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B00000F3KL,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[1, 1]","Movie - 4.5When I first saw this movie some years ago, I admit I didn't like it.  I was against the general concept of military establishments because of the violence and brutality that incurred within the endless cycle of human existence and didn't see the point in continuing it via the implementation and intervention by the U.S., U.N., and other nations.  Since then, I've come to realize that the world is so f'ed up and misconstrued politically, religiously, and socially that the military is just one of those by-products that has now become a necessity to the way the world works.  Prior to this subsequent viewing, a few other films have helped in changing my impression about the military: Tears of the Sun, Rambo (2009), and Body of Lies.  In viewing these movies, I've discovered two major themes that have ultimately given me a new perspective on the military and a third that enables me to empathize for those who serve.  First is the power to make a difference, as in the power for the strong or able to potentially change things in the course of life, be them for better or worse.  Seeing this has helped me understand some of the motivations that drive the ideology of military force and the sort of mindset one could be taking into such a scenario.  The second theme is the comradery shared between soldiers.  They've obviously sacrificed a great deal to put their duty before all else already, but in doing so gain this kind of trust and friendship with their fellow comrades-in-arms, essentially becoming the one absolute they can depend on.  It's almost bittersweet in a way, but just goes to show that despite how ingrained they may become within the machinations of the military, they are in fact, still real people with real feelings.  And finally, the last theme concerns the inconsistent, jaded, and near-incompetent ability of power hierarchies to effectively run the military.  The intentions from higher up may be helpful, but there often turns out being lapses in judgment accompanied by bad decision-making that ultimately end up unfolding into events like the one shown in Black Hawk Down.  This movie itself is a testament to many variations of these issues and I have a new respect for such depictions which, given space constraints, I will just leave at that.  Kudos to Sir Ridley Scott for a fine adaptation, expression, and enlightenment of these aspects.Video - 4.0Sony presents Black Hawk Down in an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 via the now-outdated MPEG-2 codec.  Surprisingly enough it doesn't look too bad at all.  The muted color palette of the movie carries over very well, as do the deep blacks and varying levels of contrast.  Skin tones are immaculately realistic, even with all the dirt and grime on the soldiers' faces.  The fine layer of grain does the film's gritty and harsh atmosphere justice and never appears intrusive.  Overall detail is also pretty sharp, though probably could've been much better or near-perfect had it utilized today's MPEG-4 codec.  But with that being said, the only other minor hiccup is the presence of artifacts here and there, so minus another half point for that.  As popular and successful as the movie has been, one can only hope Sony might consider a double-dip to possibly improve an already great video presentation and make it guaranteed reference-quality someday.  The excellent cinematography would definitely benefit from such a boost.Audio - 5.0While the video could use re-encoding and just a tad more restoration for artifact removal, the LPCM 5.1 track at 4.6Mbps is definitely fine the way it is (save for maybe a re-encode to DTS-HD to save disc space for video and extras, perhaps).  As expected, war movies will obviously come with a lot of sound effects including gunshots, explosions, vehicles, citizen, by-stander, and background noise, Black Hawk helicopters (duh), and a good deal of radio static, dialogue, and other discrete sounds.  All are represented perfectly, further showcasing the benefits of a lossless audio track and practically putting you right in the middle of all the action.  Dynamics have great variation between the kinds of objects on screen ranging from the size of bullets fired to the kinds of grenades used.  Separation of the sound effects and yet another commendable Hans Zimmer score is spot-on as well.  Directionality is also flawless with placement of sound effects being put where you'd see them on or off camera.  LFEs vary from subtle to booming, with the Black Hawk choppers being the most dominant element in presenting these.  But most notable is that even amongst all the action, dialogue levels remain clear and coherent all the time.  Black Hawk Down won an Oscar for sound, and rightfully so.  Consider this another piece of reference material.Extras - 4.5I've not experienced the 3-disc DVD edition, but for what's on here, I found the extras to be quite poignant and very detailed in their explanations.  In addition to commentaries from Sir Scott and the veterans of this event, there are about two and a half hours of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with cast, crew, and all the people involved in both the making of this movie and the true story behind it.  With my newly-found respect for the military and its deserving personnel, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the work and research that went into this film.  Culturally speaking, history has normally been passed down the generations using more typical methods like books and education.  But if there was ever one of the many movies to choose from to chronicle something as controversial, yet thought-provoking as war, I think the overall presentation of Black Hawk Down itself with these great special features should be one of them.  There's a lot of information here that will definitely provide for some interesting perspective.Overall - 4.5With this sudden interest and intrigue I'm now starting to develop for war movies, I can't wait to delve into the library of other greats like Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and Saving Private Ryan.  In addition to what I've seen most recently and to this followup viewing of Black Hawk Down, I've learned to appreciate the efforts and sacrifice put forth by the men and women in the military establishments all around the world.  It's a sad fact that we, as a people, have indeed resorted to using war as a means of operation, but it's a fact, nonetheless.  And Sir Ridley Scott with his great director's prowess continues to create captivating tales and interpretations that manage, not only to entertain, but to often get a message across that there is more to something than we may think.  Black Hawk Down is another one of his movies that effectively shows us the sheer brutality, and yet melancholy necessity of what war is.  While just short of an up-to-date video presentation, the Blu-ray version of Black Hawk Down still possesses reference audio and a good amount of extras that make this film highly recommended until a possible double-dip.",5,Black Hawk Down (Blu-ray),1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,7016,"['Movie', '4.5When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'general',

They captured multiple _innocent_ civilians alongside the chief of the UN's police force!  When members of the Aideed clan gathered in a building to talk about a peace agreement with the UN the US forces blew them up killing 54 people.  In response the Somalis went nuts with rage and attacked US forces  as our troops began firing missiles into residential areas.The events that occurred are clear. It perhaps be argued that US intentions were good. But the fact remains that the result was bad - for all sides.The soldiers walked into this hellfire of chaos with competing warlords adding fuel to the fire on all sides. Yes, they were brave. They were doing the job they were ordered to do.  And they were placed there by others (Clinton & the Pentagon) who were clueless.  The Somalis reacted with (understandable) rage and contempt. US soldiers were caught in the middle.Not only does ""Blackhawk Down"" ignore these facts, it also depicts the Somalis in a specific way. Is there one rioter who is depicted as having human qualities? Isn't it obvious that the movie makers were not interested in any other perspective other than the soldiers?Many reviewers compared ""Blackhawk"" to the racism of the 1964 flick ""Zulu"" in which thousands of Africans, depicted as mere ants, advanced on a small (and humanized) out numbered British force.None of this has anything to do with being anti-war, pacifism or being ""anti-American.""

Let me add a few things.First, many people would complain (rightly) that many characters are not distinguishable from others; so, if you are a fan of, say, Josh Hartnett, and expect to watch his acting, you're to be disappointed with the film.  Indeed, many characters seem buried under the long series of street combat, but the result is understandable, considering the fact that the orignal book by Mark Bowden contains more than 100 people, which had to be reduced to less than 20 in number.  The characters of the script, therefore, had to be made with amalgam of several counterparts in the real-life soldiers.  The fact is that the screenwriter did a good job under this condition.And some may say (rightly again) that they are reminded of another film treating war as a subject matter, probably of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Pearl Harbor,"" and claim the resemblance between them and ""Black Hawk Down.""  But, listen.  I have seen many war films, but never saw a one like this, in that how the modern war technology is defeated is depicted with fearful reality.  Look how US military helicopters are shot down by RPG (a manual missile device) by Somalian militia.  Or  see how the mob on the hot street are rushing, with fearlessness and hatred, to the shot-down pilots.  Those sights you never witnessed in neither of ""Pearl harbor"" or ""Saving Private Ryan.""From the artistic viewpoint, the strongest part of the film is the dry touch of the photograhy by Slawomir Idziak, responsible those masterpieces of French cinema (""Blue"" for instance).  Fast-paced editing of Pietro Scalia (""The Gladiator"") should not be missed, either.And finally, some people might see the patriotic tone in the film, and, to be sure, some scenes will justify these impressions.  But, as far as I can judge from the film, these soldiers deserve to be called heroic.

Even medicore war movies and a few bad ones that have been made since 1998 tend to have a more realistic portrayal of combat life. Having never served in the military I do not make this claim myself, but do so only after listening to veterans speak of their experiences and comparing them to what they now see on the screen.With that said, BLACK HAWK DOWN is an exciting and riveting film that neither downplays the U.S. involvement in foreign fields of conflict nor disrespects the men who serve. The movie moved me in much the same way that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did. I left the theatre feeling even more grateful to all those in uniform who risk their lives so that we, and so many others around the world, can enjoy the blessings of freedom.Ridley Scott's direction is genius and in BLACK HAWK DOWN he has made a worthwhile film that makes up for the fiasco that was HANNIBAL. There aren't very many stand-out performances in the film because it is an ensemble piece, but there are two exceptions. One is the pretty-boy Josh Hartnett who does a remarkable job as the character who is the moral center for most of the film. The other outstanding performance is that of Ewan McGregor.

497955,A352W7VHU57GYP,B00000F3KL,"""vinces""","[9, 9]","In this film's 2 and 1/2 hours we were glued to our seats.  It is a truly exciting action film taken almost exactly from the best selling non fiction book by the same name.  It's not a great film but a very good one.  It is extremely violent but only to the extent that the actual events were.  At first I'd intended to skip it because of negative rumors I'd heard.  Finally I went to see the film, read the book, then saw the film again.  I'm writing to address some of the criticisms and add some of my own ideas.The film is true to the book but includes only those parts of the book that deal with the experience of the American soldiers.  To have told the whole story would have been a formidable task and would have probably required a five hour film.  To have made this a film more pleasing to film aficionados would have required working with a story conceived from the beginning as a film project.  Not even the politicians much less the soldiers from whom this story comes had that in mind.  For an example of how a true story can be obliterated compare the film and book versions of A Beautiful Mind.  Some people have suggested that if the film makers were so concerned with accuracy they should have just done a documentary.  What they made instead is a compromise, neither a documentary nor a truly great film drama.  Never the less it will probably reach a much wider audience than either.  Ideally it will lead people to read the book.The Somalis are not portrayed as faceless except to the extent that they were perceived that way by soldiers in the midst of battle.  The one question in my mind was what was motivating the Somalis to fight so fiercely.  The film does not explain how the Americans in one previous raid accidentally killed and wounded a large number of non combatants.  In so doing they inadvertently turned many formerly friendly or at worst neutral Somalis against them.  It aided the anti American propaganda campaign whose posters announced that the Americans were there to force Somali conversion from Islam and turn them into Christian slaves.  The Somali fighters were a mix of warlord militia and a larger number of armed but unorganized citizens.  If some of the Somali fighters seemed maniacal it so happens they were jacked up on a powerful stimulant obtained by chewing a local plant.A film critic for a major New York newspaper was bothered by the fact there was only one black American soldier.  One would hope a professional critic would check the book first but hey that's just me.  There were in fact two, but one a sergeant, was killed early in the action before the first helicopter went down.Some people were offended by the fact that the Americans referred to the Somalis as ""skinnies.""  Well that's what they called them.  It was a war zone not a tea party.And to further address charges of dehumanization, the Somali warlord leadership were portrayed as the suave, educated men they were.  There were only a few moments when the audience attention was sharply focused on the suffering of innocents.  If that seemed insufficient it was only from the perspective of young men fighting desperately for their lives.  As for those who characterize the helicopter gunship attacks as Ramboesque, killing large numbers of Somalis at once, well that's how it was.One reviewer thought the violence was pornographic.  I disagree but I will offer what I consider to have been obscene about the actual events: there was no sufficient reaction force on immediate standby; there was inadequate threat assessment; despite the enormous fortune this country has invested in analyzing and developing Command Control and Communications networks, when forced to improvise we could not guide a convoy through city streets in broad daylight and in full view of three airborne camera equipped platforms.  Many of our men were maimed or killed while the convoy was lost only three miles from base looking for the downed choppers.For a similar true story read, The Last Battle, by Ralph Wetterhahn.",4,A Gripping War Film,1014163200,"02 20, 2002",2002,4028,"['film', '2', '1/2', 'hours', 'were', 'glued', 'seats', 'truly', 'exciting', 'action', 'film', 'taken', 'almost', 'exactly', 'best', 'selling', 'non', 'fiction', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'extremely', 'violent', 'only', 'extent', 'actual', 'events', 'were', 'first', ""'d"", 'intended', 'skip', 'negative', 'rumors', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Finally', 'went', 'see', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'saw', 'film', 'again', ""'m"", 'writing', 'address', 'criticisms', 'add', 'own', 'ideas.The', 'film', 'true', 'book', 'only', 'parts', 'book', 'deal', 'experience', 'American', 'soldiers', 'have', 'told', 'whole', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'formidable', 'task', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'required', 'five', 'hour', 'film', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'pleasing', 'film', 'aficionados', 'would', 'have', 'required', 'working', 'story', 'conceived', 'beginning', 'film', 'project', 'Not', 'even', 'politicians', 'much', 'soldiers', 'whom', 'story', 'had', 'mind', 'example', 'how', 'true', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'obliterated', 'compare', 'film', 'book', 'versions', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'people', 'have', 'suggested', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'so', 'concerned', 'accuracy', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'done', 'documentary', 'What', 'made', 'instead', 'compromise', 'documentary', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'drama', 'less', 'will', 'probably', 'reach', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'Ideally', 'will', 'lead', 'people', 'read', 'book.The', 'Somalis', 'are', 'not', 'portrayed', 'faceless', 'extent', 'were', 'perceived', 'way', 'soldiers', 'midst', 'battle', 'one', 'question', 'mind', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'motivating', 'Somalis', 'fight', 'so', 'fiercely', 'film', 'not', 'explain', 'how', 'Americans', 'one', 'previous', 'raid', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'wounded', 'large', 'number', 'non', 'combatants', 'so', 'doing', 'inadvertently', 'turned', 'many', 'formerly', 'friendly', 'worst', 'neutral', 'Somalis', 'aided', 'anti', 'American', 'propaganda', 'campaign', 'posters', 'announced', 'Americans', 'were', 'there', 'force', 'Somali', 'conversion', 'Islam', 'turn', 'Christian', 'slaves', 'Somali', 'fighters', 'were', 'mix', 'warlord', 'militia', 'larger', 'number', 'armed', 'unorganized', 'citizens', 'Somali', 'fighters', 'seemed', 'maniacal', 'so', 'were', 'jacked', 'up', 'powerful', 'stimulant', 'obtained', 'chewing', 'local', 'plant.A', 'film', 'critic', 'major', 'New', 'York', 'newspaper', 'was', 'bothered', 'fact', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'black', 'American', 'soldier', 'One', 'would', 'hope', 'professional', 'critic', 'would', 'check', 'book', 'first', 'hey', 'just', 'were', 'fact', 'two', 'one', 'sergeant', 'was', 'killed', 'early', 'action', 'first', 'helicopter', 'went', 'down.Some', 'people', 'were', 'offended', 'fact', 'Americans', 'referred', 'Somalis', 'skinnies', 'Well', 'what', 'called', 'was', 'war', 'zone', 'not', 'tea', 'party.And', 'further', 'address', 'charges', 'dehumanization', 'Somali', 'warlord', 'leadership', 'were', 'portrayed', 'suave', 'educated', 'men', 'were', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'audience', 'attention', 'was', 'sharply', 'focused', 'suffering', 'innocents', 'seemed', 'insufficient', 'was', 'only', 'perspective', 'young', 'men', 'fighting', 'desperately', 'lives', 'who', 'characterize', 'helicopter', 'gunship', 'attacks', 'Ramboesque', 'killing', 'large', 'numbers', 'Somalis', 'once', 'well', 'how', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'violence', 'was', 'pornographic', 'disagree', 'will', 'offer', 'what', 'consider', 'have', 'been', 'obscene', 'actual', 'events', 'was', 'sufficient', 'reaction', 'force', 'immediate', 'standby', 'was', 'inadequate', 'threat', 'assessment', 'enormous', 'fortune', 'country', 'invested', 'analyzing', 'developing', 'Command', 'Control', 'Communications', 'networks', 'when', 'forced', 'improvise', 'could', 'not', 'guide', 'convoy', 'city', 'streets', 'broad', 'daylight', 'full', 'view', 'three', 'airborne', 'camera', 'equipped', 'platforms', 'Many', 'men', 'were', 'maimed', 'killed', 'convoy', 'was', 'lost', 'only', 'three', 'miles', 'base', 'looking', 'downed', 'choppers.For', 'similar', 'true', 'story', 'read', 'Last', 'Battle', 'Ralph', 'Wetterhahn']",N/A

497957,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B00000F3KL,V. Marshall,"[3, 4]","This movie is probably the most realistic film to date on war. Amazingly descriptive and hauntingly tragic it stays with you for days.Ridley Scott has made a phenomenal film depicting the true events of the American involvement in Somalia which lead to the downing of a Black Hawk helicopter. The opening images of Mogadishu give the impression of hell on earth. Emaciated Somalis walk about the desert with no hope, the dead are piled up and forgotten, nothing exists to base a life upon. Scott develops two ideas from these tragic opening scenes, one the heart-wrenching sorrow of the Somalian people and two of the necessity for American troop involvement. Scott has recreated Mogadishu as perfectly as Hollywood is capable of doing. You feel the heat and dirt clinging to your skin; you smell the burning weapons and dying flesh. He has accomplished an amazing feat without sacrificing the humanness of the situation.The Somalian people are portrayed as wild representations of human beings. They are bold and brave while at the same time being people of tremendous calculation and cooperation. Their markets are aisles of weapons and entire towns are prepared to fight and kill without question. The warlords are heartless choosing to control the population by starvation, drugs and death. Families are ripped apart, children become murdering soldiers, and thousands of people become living skeletons before they die. The soldiers are prepped with Quat, a cocaine like substance, and they soon become absolute killing machines with no mercy. Everyone is armed with AK47's and the decimated streets become killing fields. Nothing is sacred except the call to prayer, the Mosques being the only buildings that remain intact. It is unfathomable to imagine how someone survives under such circumstances.The American soldiers are portrayed by convincing actors like, Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Sam Shepard and most especially Eric Bana. They bond as a unit thrown into a war and used as pawns by Washington. They are noble, brave and proudly willing to fight a mission they soon lose control of. The people in charge of the mission misguide and misdirect one too many times losing touch with the violence that the soldiers face while on the ground in Mogadishu. The scenes depict the absolute chaos that takes over the well planned and sophisticated mission to capture the Somalian warlord, Aidid. It shows how war on paper and on video games is much different from reality. This film violently brings to life the horror of war. Bodies are blown apart, torsos severed in half, soldiers left behind to die and no answers in sight. Scott does a fantastic job of showing the pride of American patriotism while also convincing us of the suffering that the Somalian people have lived with.Unfortunately this film would have to be several hours longer to include all the background for the violence exhibited against the American soldiers. Watch documentaries and read books to get the full story behind ""Black Hawk Down"". Although it is horribly tragic to lose the lives of American soldiers, especially to have their bodies dragged and mutilated, it is also tragic to lose thousands of lives on the other side. This film will hit you with such force and open your eyes to the horrors of war. It takes hatred, rage and revenge to another level. It brings to the forefront how our world has changed; no longer can powerful sophisticated armies override poor countries as a granted privilege. Although you will scream with patriotism while watching this film you will also realize that humans are humans and blood flows the same regardless of who it comes from.  I will be forever convinced that there must be a better way.",5,A Walk Into Hell,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,3733,"['movie', 'probably', 'most', 'realistic', 'film', 'date', 'war', 'Amazingly', 'descriptive', 'hauntingly', 'tragic', 'days.Ridley', 'Scott', 'made', 'phenomenal', 'film', 'depicting', 'true', 'events', 'American', 'involvement', 'Somalia', 'lead', 'downing', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'helicopter', 'opening', 'images', 'Mogadishu', 'give', 'impression', 'hell', 'earth', 'Emaciated', 'Somalis', 'walk', 'desert', 'hope', 'dead', 'are', 'piled', 'up', 'forgotten', 'nothing', 'exists', 'base', 'life', 'upon', 'Scott', 'two', 'ideas', 'tragic', 'opening', 'scenes', 'one', 'heart-wrenching', 'sorrow', 'Somalian', 'people', 'two', 'necessity', 'American', 'troop', 'involvement', 'Scott', 'recreated', 'Mogadishu', 'as', 'perfectly', 'Hollywood', 'capable', 'doing', 'feel', 'heat', 'dirt', 'clinging', 'skin', 'smell', 'burning', 'weapons', 'dying', 'flesh', 'accomplished', 'amazing', 'feat', 'sacrificing', 'humanness', 'situation.The', 'Somalian', 'people', 'are', 'portrayed', 'wild', 'representations', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'bold', 'brave', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'people', 'tremendous', 'calculation', 'cooperation', 'markets', 'are', 'aisles', 'weapons', 'entire', 'towns', 'are', 'prepared', 'fight', 'kill', 'question', 'warlords', 'are', 'heartless', 'choosing', 'control', 'population', 'starvation', 'drugs', 'death', 'Families', 'are', 'ripped', 'apart', 'children', 'become', 'murdering', 'soldiers', 'thousands', 'people', 'become', 'living', 'skeletons', 'die', 'soldiers', 'are', 'prepped', 'Quat', 'cocaine', 'substance', 'soon', 'become', 'absolute', 'killing', 'machines', 'mercy', 'Everyone', 'armed', 'AK47', 'decimated', 'streets', 'become', 'killing', 'fields', 'Nothing', 'sacred', 'call', 'prayer', 'Mosques', 'being', 'only', 'buildings', 'remain', 'intact', 'unfathomable', 'imagine', 'how', 'someone', 'such', 'circumstances.The', 'American', 'soldiers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'convincing', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'most', 'especially', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'bond', 'unit', 'thrown', 'war', 'used', 'pawns', 'Washington', 'are', 'noble', 'brave', 'proudly', 'willing', 'fight', 'mission', 'soon', 'lose', 'control', 'people', 'charge', 'mission', 'misguide', 'misdirect', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'losing', 'touch', 'violence', 'soldiers', 'face', 'ground', 'Mogadishu', 'scenes', 'depict', 'absolute', 'chaos', 'well', 'planned', 'sophisticated', 'mission', 'capture', 'Somalian', 'warlord', 'Aidid', 'how', 'war', 'paper', 'video', 'games', 'much', 'different', 'reality', 'film', 'violently', 'life', 'horror', 'war', 'Bodies', 'are', 'blown', 'apart', 'torsos', 'severed', 'half', 'soldiers', 'left', 'die', 'answers', 'sight', 'Scott', 'fantastic', 'job', 'showing', 'pride', 'American', 'patriotism', 'also', 'convincing', 'suffering', 'Somalian', 'people', 'have', 'lived', 'with.Unfortunately', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'several', 'hours', 'longer', 'include', 'background', 'violence', 'exhibited', 'American', 'soldiers', 'Watch', 'documentaries', 'read', 'books', 'get', 'full', 'story', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'horribly', 'tragic', 'lose', 'lives', 'American', 'soldiers', 'especially', 'have', 'bodies', 'dragged', 'mutilated', 'also', 'tragic', 'lose', 'thousands', 'lives', 'other', 'side', 'film', 'will', 'hit', 'such', 'force', 'open', 'eyes', 'horrors', 'war', 'hatred', 'rage', 'revenge', 'level', 'forefront', 'how', 'world', 'changed', 'longer', 'can', 'powerful', 'sophisticated', 'armies', 'poor', 'countries', 'granted', 'privilege', 'will', 'scream', 'patriotism', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'realize', 'humans', 'are', 'humans', 'blood', 'same', 'regardless', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'convinced', 'must', 'be', 'better', 'way']",N/A

497961,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,B00000F3KL,"""weirdo_87""","[0, 1]","There is somewhat of a debate over who is to blame for the October 1993 incident in Mogadishu. I will try to present a viewpoint of it.In late 1992, with his term as President coming to an end, George Bush senior sent American troops to Somalia, after some pressure from groups such as the United Nations, to act as humanitarians by aiding the people there. Thus, you can blame Bush for committing us (And, if you want to go further, blame the U.N for pressuring involvement). However, when Clinton took office, he had the humanitarians removed and Rangers and Delta Forces put in their place. The situation was also escalated: The Battle of Mogadishu (Which is also the event shown in ""Black Hawk Down"") occurred as a result of the hunt for one of the Somalia Warlords and for some of his top men. Much different from the intentions of Bush senior. So, you can blame Clinton as well.I come from a family that is pro-republican, so I can't help but pick up on some of their beliefs. I do admit that Bush has some of the blame, but I also think he had the best of intentions for doing so. Some of my relatives talk of Clinton like he was Hitler. Fault can be put on him solely for the fact he was our leader at the time. But he too had good intentions by having a mission planned to go after those responsible for the violence. To end the harm being done to the civilians, is there any better solution then going after the roots of the evil?The real blame for the battle's outcome was in the planning of the raid. The U.S underestimated the strength and skill of the Somalia troops whiles overestimating itself. We thought it would be a straight hit and run mission, taking no more than half an hour to an hour. Our men also weren't supplied with proper air and ground support (The pentagon said it was to prevent escalating the conflict, forgetting that sending in armed troops was defeating that purpose). In the end, we had about 18 dead and many more wounded, two helicopters shot down (With one pilot held hostage) and embarrassment on our faces. The defeat in Somalia still echoes in our military: Nowadays, the policy is that we have the will to get involved in fights we have no part of, yet won't go all the way in terms of suffering casualties. The U.N, Bush, Clinton, our army generals, troops and everyone else could not have foreseen what would happen and shouldn't have their whole careers judged solely by this. Still, they all should have anticipated that something bad might occur: As stated in ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", `Expect the unexpected'.Now as to what I thought of ""Black Hawk Down"". I thought it was a compelling war picture with some gut-wrenching battle scenes. I also liked how it avoided being patriotic cornball or a sadistic accusation (Though understandable, considering it came out after 9/11). However, it was often hard to tell who was who during the battle scenes. And many people are upset by the lack of human involvement with the characters (Not me though: I've heard some good theories about the men being developed as a unit rather than as individuals. And what did you want instead: The cliched stock characters as used in past war movies?). Still, four stars and a recommendation from me.",4,Who is at fault for Mogadishu?,1035244800,"10 22, 2002",2002,3233,"['somewhat', 'debate', 'who', 'blame', 'October', '1993', 'incident', 'Mogadishu', 'will', 'try', 'present', 'viewpoint', 'it.In', 'late', '1992', 'term', 'President', 'coming', 'end', 'George', 'Bush', 'senior', 'sent', 'American', 'troops', 'Somalia', 'pressure', 'groups', 'such', 'United', 'Nations', 'act', 'humanitarians', 'aiding', 'people', 'there', 'Thus', 'can', 'blame', 'Bush', 'committing', 'want', 'go', 'further', 'blame', 'U.N', 'pressuring', 'involvement', 'However', 'when', 'Clinton', 'took', 'office', 'had', 'humanitarians', 'removed', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Forces', 'put', 'place', 'situation', 'was', 'also', 'escalated', 'Battle', 'Mogadishu', 'Which', 'also', 'event', 'shown', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'occurred', 'result', 'hunt', 'one', 'Somalia', 'Warlords', 'top', 'men', 'Much', 'different', 'intentions', 'Bush', 'senior', 'So', 'can', 'blame', 'Clinton', 'well.I', 'come', 'family', 'pro-republican', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'pick', 'up', 'beliefs', 'do', 'admit', 'Bush', 'blame', 'also', 'think', 'had', 'best', 'intentions', 'doing', 'so', 'relatives', 'talk', 'Clinton', 'was', 'Hitler', 'Fault', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'solely', 'fact', 'was', 'leader', 'time', 'too', 'had', 'good', 'intentions', 'having', 'mission', 'planned', 'go', 'responsible', 'violence', 'end', 'harm', 'being', 'done', 'civilians', 'there', 'better', 'solution', 'then', 'going', 'roots', 'evil', 'real', 'blame', 'battle', 'outcome', 'was', 'planning', 'raid', 'U.S', 'underestimated', 'strength', 'skill', 'Somalia', 'troops', 'overestimating', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'straight', 'hit', 'run', 'mission', 'taking', 'more', 'hour', 'hour', 'men', 'also', 'were', ""n't"", 'supplied', 'proper', 'air', 'ground', 'support', 'pentagon', 'said', 'was', 'prevent', 'escalating', 'conflict', 'forgetting', 'sending', 'armed', 'troops', 'was', 'defeating', 'purpose', 'end', 'had', '18', 'dead', 'many', 'more', 'wounded', 'two', 'helicopters', 'shot', 'down', 'one', 'pilot', 'held', 'hostage', 'embarrassment', 'defeat', 'Somalia', 'still', 'military', 'Nowadays', 'policy', 'have', 'will', 'get', 'involved', 'fights', 'have', 'part', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'terms', 'suffering', 'casualties', 'U.N', 'Bush', 'Clinton', 'army', 'generals', 'troops', 'everyone', 'else', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'foreseen', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'careers', 'judged', 'solely', 'Still', 'should', 'have', 'anticipated', 'something', 'bad', 'might', 'occur', 'stated', 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Expect', ""unexpected'.Now"", 'what', 'thought', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'thought', 'was', 'compelling', 'war', 'picture', 'gut-wrenching', 'battle', 'scenes', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'avoided', 'being', 'patriotic', 'cornball', 'sadistic', 'accusation', 'Though', 'understandable', 'considering', 'came', 'out', '9/11', 'However', 'was', 'often', 'hard', 'tell', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'battle', 'scenes', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'upset', 'lack', 'human', 'involvement', 'characters', 'Not', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'theories', 'men', 'being', 'developed', 'unit', 'rather', 'individuals', 'what', 'did', 'want', 'instead', 'cliched', 'stock', 'characters', 'used', 'past', 'war', 'movies', 'Still', 'four', 'stars', 'recommendation']",N/A

497963,A64ED6L379KGY,B00000F3KL,"""wherethedeerare""","[0, 0]","Black Hawk Down is a film based on Mark Bowden's account of the events that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3rd 1993, when a number of Delta Force Soldiers and Army Rangers were on a mission to capture two of Warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid's top lieutenants. The initiative of the mission was lost when two Black Hawk Helicopters were shot down. As a result, what was only to be an hour's routine mission turned into a harrowing 15+ hour catastrophic fight for life, as the soldiers fought against thousands of Somali Militia to get to the crash sight, load the dead and wounded and get back to base. In the end, 19 US soldiers and hundreds of Somalis lost their lives.Supported by a strong script, talented cast and a good director, Black Hawk Down is a successful protrayal of the events that took place that fateful day in October. Though a little biased in spots, the movie manages to steer clear of crediting the American soldiers as heros for all the wrong reasons, and largely acknowledges what happened that day as a major SNAFU. Ridley Scott is good at avoiding the terms ""right"" and ""wrong"" and instead maintains the movie's focus on the middle ground of the horror and sadness of war, and the comaraderie of the men fighting in it. Because the movie is filmed in Real Time, and once the battle starts it rarely stops, the characters might come across as poorly defined to some, but to me they were very rich. The sense of brotherhood amongst the actors in their roles is very apparent, and aides in comprehending the severity of the situation, and truly enforces the feeling behind the soldier's motto and the movie's tagline: Leave No Man Behind.I would recommend this film for anyone interested in the True Story it's based on. I would however, advise that you read the excellent book by Mark Bowden first, as it makes the experience a little more three dimensional, and would surely answer any questions you might have concerning the situation. Be warned though, it's a relentlessly violent film that doesn't gloss anything over. People with an aversion to blood might find themselves a little uncomfortable.

The sound on this blu-ray (like most of Ridley Scotts other work) is nothing short of spectacular! Explosions and bullets whizzing throughout to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is really best enoyed on a solid 7.1 system. The picture quality was not the best i've ever seen but certainly nothing wrong with it. My only problem with the movie is that is does drag and after the 1000th straight explosion it gets a little old. The character development is also a little weak. War movies like Saving Private Ryan do much better in this regard. I would say it is worth seeing although it took me three separate viewings to finish it. I'm also not sure about the re-watchability of it as well. This seemed like a barrage of action with no real purpose or plot to hold it together.

497965,A1SZ2F37ATACUL,B00000F3KL,"Whose Line? ""Kevin""","[3, 3]","There are very few war movies that have it all - the look and feel of combat, the realism, the colors and sounds of battle, the camera work necessary to do justice to the event -  but Black Hawk Down is one of those movies.This film has one concern, and that is to depict the events of Somalia as realistically as possible.  Of course Ridley Scott is involved, and this is a movie with big name actors, so there are some hollywood moments, but overall, BHD may be the closest the average american every comes to witnessing modern urban warfare.It is not necessary to discuss the authenticity of the movie.  Simply watching the special features divulges the efforts of the crew to get everything right down to the last detail.  I personally think it's not the authenticity of the movie that is central so much as the manner in which the film is shot.  Never have I seen such a claustrophobic movie.  You cringe just watching the American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers creep down narrow alleyways.  It is not hard at all to feel their apprehension, as windows pop open and Ak-47 rounds rain down from the rooftops.  I almost cover my face when Ewan McGregor's character takes on a mounted machine gun by himself, barely getting his grenade off before the Somalians finish reloading.  The scenes with the humvees are just gut wrenching, as one roadblock after another prevent them from getting to safety, and casualties quickly mount.One thing I love about this movie is that we don't see our American soldiers as invincible.  We watch them shoot at windows and sprinting Somalians, but more often that not, they don't hit their target (with the notable exceptions of the two Delta Force snipers).  This is real.  Our American boys are damn good, but they shouldn't be able to hit somebody on the run at three hundred yards every time, and BHD does a wonderful job of not forcing you to suspend your disbelief.If you allow yourself to become engrossed in the film, BHD can be slightly nauseating at times.  I am not bothered by gore at all in movies, and absolutely love good war films, but the confining nature of this movie and its realism is well...a little too real sometimes.  Not that I'm complaining.  BHD is everything a war movie should be.  It demonstrates the disgusting nature of modern armed conflict and lets you make your own conclusions.",5,Engrossing...and slightly nauseating.,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,2353,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'war', 'movies', 'have', 'look', 'feel', 'combat', 'realism', 'colors', 'sounds', 'battle', 'camera', 'work', 'necessary', 'do', 'justice', 'event', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'one', 'movies.This', 'film', 'one', 'concern', 'depict', 'events', 'Somalia', 'as', 'realistically', 'possible', 'course', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'involved', 'movie', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'are', 'hollywood', 'moments', 'overall', 'BHD', 'may', 'be', 'closest', 'average', 'american', 'witnessing', 'modern', 'urban', 'warfare.It', 'not', 'necessary', 'discuss', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'Simply', 'watching', 'special', 'features', 'efforts', 'crew', 'get', 'everything', 'right', 'down', 'last', 'detail', 'personally', 'think', 'not', 'authenticity', 'movie', 'central', 'so', 'much', 'manner', 'film', 'shot', 'Never', 'have', 'seen', 'claustrophobic', 'movie', 'cringe', 'just', 'watching', 'American', 'Rangers', 'Delta', 'Force', 'soldiers', 'creep', 'down', 'narrow', 'alleyways', 'not', 'hard', 'feel', 'apprehension', 'windows', 'pop', 'open', 'Ak-47', 'rounds', 'rain', 'rooftops', 'almost', 'cover', 'face', 'when', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'character', 'mounted', 'machine', 'gun', 'barely', 'getting', 'grenade', 'Somalians', 'finish', 'reloading', 'scenes', 'humvees', 'are', 'just', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'one', 'roadblock', 'prevent', 'getting', 'safety', 'casualties', 'quickly', 'mount.One', 'thing', 'love', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'American', 'soldiers', 'invincible', 'watch', 'shoot', 'windows', 'sprinting', 'Somalians', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'target', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'two', 'Delta', 'Force', 'snipers', 'real', 'American', 'boys', 'are', 'damn', 'good', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'hit', 'somebody', 'run', 'three', 'hundred', 'yards', 'time', 'BHD', 'wonderful', 'job', 'not', 'forcing', 'suspend', 'disbelief.If', 'allow', 'become', 'engrossed', 'film', 'BHD', 'can', 'be', 'slightly', 'nauseating', 'times', 'am', 'not', 'bothered', 'gore', 'movies', 'absolutely', 'love', 'good', 'war', 'films', 'confining', 'nature', 'movie', 'realism', 'well', 'little', 'too', 'real', 'sometimes', 'Not', ""'m"", 'complaining', 'BHD', 'everything', 'war', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'disgusting', 'nature', 'modern', 'armed', 'conflict', 'make', 'own', 'conclusions']",N/A
497966,A377RQRKT18P2H,B00000F3KL,William C. Beatty MD,"[4, 4]","This movie is about the Soul of Combat Soldiers.  In contrast to most Hollywood war movies, Blackhawk Down is highly respectful of the series of moral decisions that human beings make in allowing themselves to be placed into a Battle such as this.  Early in the movie Ranger Sgt. Eversman is talking to his fellow Rangers about their presence in Somalia,  'It seems to me that we can either watch the country destroy itself (the famine and coexisting anarchy having resulted in 300,000 deaths) or we can try to help.'After the battle Delta Sgt. Hooten, talking withEversman, simply and honestly describes the morality of the professional warrior. Hooten recalls he was asked by his civilian friends, ""'Hoot, why do you do it?  Are you some kind of war junkie?'  I don't say a damn thing because they wouldn't get it.  It's about the men next to you. That's all.""  This moral position may be mentioned in other movies but the makers of Blackhawk Down have eloquently captured it in the behavior of the soldiers in the film.  There is even an empathic portrayal of the rage of the Somali militia at the American implication that their culture was so simple and so defective that foreigners would believe they were entitled intrude as they saw fit.  There is also an ironic reference to the moral judgement of the Clinton administration. General Garrison is speaking with his officers about the tactical plans for the American action,  ""I requested gunships and armor to provide additional back-up, but Washington, in its infinite wisdom, declined, saying it would be 'Too High Profile.'""This is a very stirring and powerful movie.",5,The best war movie ever made.,1028419200,"08 4, 2002",2002,1628,"['movie', 'Soul', 'Combat', 'Soldiers', 'contrast', 'most', 'Hollywood', 'war', 'movies', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'highly', 'respectful', 'series', 'moral', 'decisions', 'human', 'beings', 'make', 'allowing', 'be', 'placed', 'Battle', 'such', 'Early', 'movie', 'Ranger', 'Sgt', 'Eversman', 'talking', 'fellow', 'Rangers', 'presence', 'Somalia', 'can', 'watch', 'country', 'destroy', 'famine', 'coexisting', 'anarchy', 'having', 'resulted', '300,000', 'deaths', 'can', 'try', 'help', ""'After"", 'battle', 'Delta', 'Sgt', 'Hooten', 'talking', 'withEversman', 'simply', 'honestly', 'morality', 'professional', 'warrior', 'Hooten', 'was', 'asked', 'civilian', 'friends', ""'Hoot"", 'why', 'do', 'do', 'Are', 'kind', 'war', 'junkie', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'damn', 'thing', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'men', 'moral', 'position', 'may', 'be', 'mentioned', 'other', 'movies', 'makers', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'have', 'eloquently', 'captured', 'behavior', 'soldiers', 'film', 'even', 'empathic', 'portrayal', 'rage', 'Somali', 'militia', 'American', 'implication', 'culture', 'was', 'so', 'simple', 'so', 'defective', 'foreigners', 'would', 'believe', 'were', 'entitled', 'intrude', 'saw', 'fit', 'also', 'ironic', 'reference', 'moral', 'judgement', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'General', 'Garrison', 'speaking', 'officers', 'tactical', 'plans', 'American', 'action', 'requested', 'gunships', 'armor', 'provide', 'additional', 'back-up', 'Washington', 'infinite', 'wisdom', 'declined', 'saying', 'would', 'be', ""'Too"", 'High', 'Profile', 'very', 'stirring', 'powerful', 'movie']",N/A

Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor,  Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana,are just a few of the cast to do their lions' share of great acting. There was a sort of light-heartedness, when 3 of the group are cut off from the main force, and Scott plays them to the hilt. You are rooting for them to make it back to their buddies and the safety of the larger group.All, in all people this is a Great movie and I advise you to see it, esp. if like me, you are in the dark about Mogadishu, Somalia.ciao yaaah69",5,SPLENDID-TIGHT-KNIT-EDITING-CAST OF HERO'S!!,1011398400,"01 19, 2002",2002,1403,"['was', 'not', 'slacker', 'movie', 'try', 'compare', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'useless', 'own', 'merit', 'unforgiving', 'closeness', 'excellence.Ridley', 'Scott', 'who', 'master', 'Direction', 'Gladiator', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Hannibal', 'Somalia', 'conflict', 'center', 'front', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'end', 'even', 'then', 'linger', 'watching', 'credits', 'not', 'knowing', 'why', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'anything', 'part', 'knowledge', 'regarding', 'Somalia', 'conflict', 'missing', '.I', 'was', 'mesmerised', 'found', 'clenching', 'teeth', 'hands', 'point', 'saying', ""hurt's'.I"", 'do', 'remember', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'Somalias', 'dragging', 'guys', 'streets', 'remember', 'knot', 'stomach', 'day', 'have', 'remembered', 'was', 'end', 'knowledge', 'conflict', 'Now', 'Scott', 'home', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'Eric', 'Bana', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'cast', 'do', 'lions', 'share', 'great', 'acting', 'was', 'sort', 'light-heartedness', 'when', '3', 'group', 'are', 'cut', 'off', 'main', 'force', 'Scott', 'hilt', 'are', 'rooting', 'make', 'back', 'buddies', 'safety', 'larger', 'group.All', 'people', 'Great', 'movie', 'advise', 'see', 'esp', 'are', 'dark', 'Mogadishu', 'Somalia.ciao', 'yaaah69']",N/A

But it acheives this depth without attempting airy dialogue. It lets the actions of the men depicted speak for themselves. Hartnett's performance was outstanding. Some of the scenes in which his character, Sgt. Eversman, contemplates his own idealism are among the most quietly profound I have ever seen in a war film. The characters in this film are not archetypal, and that is the beauty of this film - its believability. Ridley Scott recognized that heroism was diplayed on such a scale that it needed no dramatization.As a side note, this is the first film I have ever seen in the theater which received a standing ovation from the audience.",5,When idealism meets reality,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,920,"['film', 'absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'so', 'deep', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'nature', 'U.S.', 'interventionism', 'tremendous', 'heroism', 'deisplayed', 'men', 'battle', 'nature', 'warrior', 'brotherhood', 'emotion', 'other', 'human', 'experience', 'depth', 'attempting', 'airy', 'dialogue', 'actions', 'men', 'depicted', 'speak', 'Hartnett', 'performance', 'was', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'character', 'Sgt', 'Eversman', 'own', 'idealism', 'are', 'most', 'quietly', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'war', 'film', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'archetypal', 'beauty', 'film', 'believability', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'recognized', 'heroism', 'was', 'diplayed', 'scale', 'needed', 'dramatization.As', 'side', 'note', 'first', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'theater', 'received', 'standing', 'ovation', 'audience']",N/A

497977,AP3B615GM191G,B00000F3KL,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","While watching ""Black Hawk Down"", I began comparing it to other war movies/series I have previously watched, such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Band of Brothers"", and ""Flags of Our Fathers"".  Though the film impressed me with its gritty realism and intensity, there was just something missing that never really [...] me into the plot...a lack of the overly dramatic.Basically, the movie takes place during the United States Army's attempt to liberate the country of Somolia from dictator Mohamed Farrah Aidid.  When the mission begins to stray from its objectives and a Black Hawk military chopper crashes en route, a group of soldiers on the ground are put in extreme harms way in order to rescue their fellow brothers and fully complete the mission objectives.The film succeeds in its ability to portray the type of warfare not uncommon to the Middle Eastern region.  Instead of the beach assaults or air raids common of World War II fighting, the ""modern"" warfare method (at least in the Middle East) includes much more house-to-house, intense personal combat.  The intensity of that fighting is aptly portrayed by director Ridley Scott and shows that all fighting in war is brutal...no matter where it takes place.Yet, despite that realistic take on war violence, I actually thought that the movie suffered a bit from the fact that it didn't really try to embellish the story at all with any added drama.  Usually this objective approach in a film would be a good thing, but in the case of ""Black Hawk"" it only adds to make things a bit long and tedious.  Scott sticks to the basic details of the military assault, and really never delves into the personal lives of any of the characters or adds any auxiliary drama.Thus, although ""Black Hawk Down"" is a very gritty, realistic portrayal of modern-day war efforts, to me at least it fell a bit flat dramatically.  A little bit of character development or 24-esque drama would have gone a long way towards making it a memorable film experience.",3,"Very Intense, But Not Altogether Engaging",1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,1993,"['watching', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'began', 'comparing', 'other', 'war', 'movies/series', 'have', 'previously', 'watched', 'such', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'film', 'impressed', 'gritty', 'realism', 'intensity', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'missing', 'never', 'really', '[', ']', 'plot', 'lack', 'overly', 'dramatic.Basically', 'movie', 'place', 'United', 'States', 'Army', 'attempt', 'liberate', 'country', 'Somolia', 'dictator', 'Mohamed', 'Farrah', 'Aidid', 'When', 'mission', 'stray', 'objectives', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'military', 'chopper', 'crashes', 'route', 'group', 'soldiers', 'ground', 'are', 'put', 'extreme', 'harms', 'way', 'order', 'rescue', 'fellow', 'brothers', 'fully', 'complete', 'mission', 'objectives.The', 'film', 'ability', 'portray', 'type', 'warfare', 'not', 'uncommon', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'region', 'Instead', 'beach', 'assaults', 'air', 'raids', 'common', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fighting', 'modern', 'warfare', 'method', 'least', 'Middle', 'East', 'much', 'more', 'house-to-house', 'intense', 'personal', 'combat', 'intensity', 'fighting', 'aptly', 'portrayed', 'director', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'fighting', 'war', 'brutal', 'matter', 'where', 'place.Yet', 'realistic', 'take', 'war', 'violence', 'actually', 'thought', 'movie', 'suffered', 'bit', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'embellish', 'story', 'added', 'drama', 'Usually', 'objective', 'approach', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'case', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'only', 'make', 'things', 'bit', 'long', 'tedious', 'Scott', 'sticks', 'basic', 'details', 'military', 'assault', 'really', 'never', 'personal', 'lives', 'characters', 'auxiliary', 'drama.Thus', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'very', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'modern-day', 'war', 'efforts', 'least', 'fell', 'bit', 'flat', 'dramatically', 'little', 'bit', 'character', 'development', '24-esque', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'memorable', 'film', 'experience']",N/A
