1575751,ACJVGDN8G386P,B008SOS7MS,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 2]","This film re-affirms Sturgeon's Law, which says 90% of music, books and films are c.r.a.p. Only about 2 scenes and 7 lines in this film had any shred of originality. Most of the film relies on silly Jerry Lewis-type comedy targeted at an audience who'll laugh at anything which goes splat, most of which has been used over and over again in forgettable films since the 1930's. Tyler Perry has had success with possibly the most over-the-top, ridiculous, pompous and irritating character in recent memory, named simply Madea. And the bad part she been and probably will return in many films. In previous offerings, she was Grandma Madea. In this film she is Auntie Madea.Madea is a cross between Aunt Esther (the over-the-top bible-thumping matriarch from the 1970's television show &#34;Sanford and Son&#34;) and Mama of &#34;Mama's Family&#34; of the 1980's, all encompassed within a body which would give football line backer Lawrence Taylor a run for his money. She has a behind which fits into dresses like a medicine ball being forced into jockey shorts and breasts which probably need multiple area codes. She overtakes the rest of the cast not just in height and build but in her endless need to spew out relentless clich&eacute; dribble, speaking every single thought in her head no matter how offensive or ridiculous. The only aspects of Madea I found I could tolerate was when she left her scenes. It was like &#34;thank God&#34;. Her vocabulary is limited, with the words &#34;sugar&#34;, &#34;honey&#34;, and &#34;ass&#34; being repeated over and over again.But Madea is not the only problem with the whole experience. The CFO's wife looks like she just graduated from High School, looking a lot like the older sister of his daughter. Was this supposed to be funny? It was just stupid and verging on offensive. His mother who lives with them is not playing with a full deck. As Madea puts it, &#34;the store's open but nobody's shopping.&#34; The other children seem like characters who didn't make the final cut of the Brady Bunch.The plot, obviously contrived to enable some means to put Madea into the &#34;story&#34;, involves a middle-aged CFO of the charity/foundation part of a mob-backed corporation which has been running a ponzi scheme. He arrives at the office where everybody is shredding everything in site. If they were trying to force computer screens into shredding machines, it wouldn't have been any more crazy. He finds out he was hired as the fall guy for the corporation which will be the center-piece of an upcoming PBS Frontline. He puts himself at the mercy of government investigators who decide to put him and his family into a safe-house while the trial is underway, fearing that this will be the best protection.Of course, the investigator has his aunt put up the white family in, you guessed it, the home of the Mad Black Woman: Madea. The main thrust of the comedy involves the white family possibly from Upstate New York or New England being in the same sphere of the Mad Black Woman from the South. Every scene and every confrontation was predictable and totally contrived from the first. She spews out line after line of clich&eacute; tripe, most of which is so predictable and vulgar that it wasn't even remotely entertaining. It's just unbearable. And the problem is, we know what she's going to say. For example, she doesn't like the white folks sleeping late: &#34;You better get the hell up or when I come back up in here you know what's gonna happen? You're gonna taste the rainbow.&#34; or &#34;If I come back up these stairs and you still in this bed I'm gonna get completely naked and get up in there with you and spoon.&#34; Now that has to be the most horrible threat of the entire movie. I would prefer being accosted by Charles Manson than seeing Madea without any clothes. The only sequence I found remotely entertaining involved Medea's brother Joe and the implication that he and the white CFO might be related. He asks questions and finds they have more in common than they might realize.This movie is essentially a series of bad Saturday Night Live sketches all involving the character Madea. Inside the film, was a better one which could have been much more interesting. One character is the son of a preacher who has lost their church's money which he invested into the ponzi scheme. That had great potential and still could have been funny to see how he could get back the money. But unfortunately, the movie is all about Made, and the whole idea never takes itself seriously. Madea's bad clothes, her bad lines, her bad demeanor. And if you don't find Madea funny, it's gonna be your-know-what. I think Tyler Perry has a modicum of talent, but he isn't going to win any acclaim with this drivel.",1,"Oh No!

The acting was atrocious especially by Denise Richards who can't act her way out of a wet paper bag, so makes me wonder how she got the part because she isn't pretty. Eugene Levy is a competent actor but he was trying too hard in this one, it was too obvious, like he was trying to act outside his comfort zone.The movie was just all over the place and would have been slightly better if Madea wasn't even involved in the film cause Madea and her antics work when dealing with her family drama not something where it involves a plot like this movie had. Tyler had a chance to do a serious film mixed with a small amount of comedy thrown in.

As Tyler Perry's ego grew and grew, Madea's satire slowly died off.  If you go back to Madea's old VHS off-off-way off broadway stage  plays, you'll see why Tyler Perry as Madea became an instant hit.  Madea was someone every African American could relate to; we all had a ""Big Mama"" that took care of everybody, went to church and cursed up a storm if you teed her off, kept a loaded weapon in her purse and you suspected might be smoking weed when the kids went to bed.  This matriarch of the family always had your back.  When it got bad, your family's version of Madea is what pulled everyone through.  That was why Madea was so beloved.  It was a spot on routine of a regular family.I got the impression that Madea was suddenly taking on a family placed in witness protection, because it was too difficult to think of a better story line in which Madea and Eugene Levy could interact.  Here we have Tyler Perry and Eugene Levy.  Two great comedians, naturally funny and incredibly talent human beings... instead I felt I was watching a very poor rendition of Scooby Doo.Where is Mr. Brown and Cora Simmons and the rest of the early 90's crew to bring back the funny?  In any case, would I recommend this movie to a friend... only if they didn't have to pay to see it - and you have to have absolutely nothing else better to do with your time.I actually love Tyler Perry and have a been a loyal fan, but give me something for my loyalty... at least make me laugh when I pay to watch your ""comedic"" movies.",1,Huh?

In my opinion the guy's a sloppy writer, sloppy director, and DOES - as many people say - play to stereotype.  Also, I don't understand why he has to literally brand every single thing ... what's next, Tyler Perry presents Condoms?  Tyler Perry's Extra-Absorbent Tampons?That said, I do (sometimes) like Madea, Perry's most popular alter ego.  Or at least, I USED to like Madea, to some degree ... that is, until TYLER PERRY'S MADEA'S WITNESS PROTECTION (one of the most awkardly-titled films, thanks to the Perry moniker, in existence), which has its share of laughs but in the end is little more than more stereotypes, more weak direction - and, sadly, less Madea.Eugene Levy, whose talent is fairly wasted here, plays George Needleman, an NYC investment banker with no backbone, who has been set up as the fall guy in a Ponzi scheme-type scam financed by the mob.  When George agrees to help the feds gather evidence, to protect him and his family from harm they all have to be put into a witness protection program ... but with fears that the mob may trail the Needlemans to any place the feds can find, the agent working with George, named Brian (and also played by - yep - Tyler Perry), instead talks his Aunt Madea and Uncle Joe into taking the Needlemans into their big home in Atlanta for safety.From here it's just one supposedly funny incident after another, as Madea and Joe try to get used to a white family (complete with a stereotypically senile grandma played by Doris Roberts; more talent wasted) staying in their home.  Problem is, these scenes are only sometimes funny, and Madea is such a watered-down version of her usual self (supposedly on purpose; Perry has reportedly toned Madea down for today's young audiences), anyone who has seen Madea at her best, in the past, will wonder what the hell happened.  Even sillier, the entire mob angle (Madea up against some gangsters - THAT I was dying to see!) is thrown out entirely; when the Needlemans are put witness production, enough is made of the need to keep them safe from the mob, you spend the rest of the film half-anticipating when they are found.  But guess what?  It never happens.The film is not godawful, but is very weak and also a waste of some talented comic actors.
