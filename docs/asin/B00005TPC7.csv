At the time, I didn't realize the Russion intimidation factor nor did I realize what an upset the American victory represented to the Russians.  The American were an amateur hockey team and the Russians were a professional hockey team with some of the worlds best players.I remember being impressed by the American Hockey team as they passed puck with fluidiness and team coordination and the creative of the patterns.  The American seems very good and did not seek like an under dog team even though the average age was 21.

682161,A27RFBMPCWGZSZ,B00005TPC7,Jason Waldman,"[24, 25]","This is simply the most moving sports documentary I've ever seen.  Produced by HBO, this chronicles the journey of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team from unknowns to national heroes.&quot;Do You Believe in Miracles?&quot; follows the team from the tryouts in 1979 through the exhibitions they played, including the one against the Russians in Madison Square Garden, and finally, the triumph over the Russians and the Finns to win the gold medal.  It includes interviews with head coach Herb Brooks and several players, including team captain Mike Eruzione, goalie Jim Craig, and defenseman Mike Ramsey.But the documentary also does an excellent job chronicling the feeling of America before and after the U.S. won the gold, including the low feelings after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and during the Iranian hostage crisis.  One of the most fascinating interviews in the whole thing is with Barry Rosen, one of the hostages, who didn't find out about the Olympics until returning home months later.Of course the highlight of &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles?&quot; is the victory over the Soviets.  The documentary uses footage from the network telecast for the highlights, including the calls from Al Michaels (who is also interviewed here).  If you don't tear up when Eruzione scores or when Michaels shouts &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles?&quot;, something's wrong.  The players reactions afterwards, even though this was done twenty years after the fact, are still very touching to watch.Overall, I think this is one of those sports documentaries that transcends time.  Years from now, people will still watch this documentary and still cry when they hear Al Michaels utter &quot;Do You Believe in Miracles?&quot;.",5,One of the Best Documentaries Around,1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,1723,"['simply', 'most', 'moving', 'sports', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Produced', 'HBO', 'journey', '1980', 'U.S.', 'Olympic', 'Hockey', 'Team', 'unknowns', 'national', 'heroes.', 'quot', 'Do', 'Believe', 'Miracles', 'quot', 'team', 'tryouts', '1979', 'exhibitions', 'played', 'including', 'one', 'Russians', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'finally', 'triumph', 'Russians', 'Finns', 'win', 'gold', 'medal', 'interviews', 'head', 'coach', 'Herb', 'Brooks', 'several', 'players', 'including', 'team', 'captain', 'Mike', 'Eruzione', 'goalie', 'Jim', 'Craig', 'defenseman', 'Mike', 'Ramsey.But', 'documentary', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'chronicling', 'feeling', 'America', 'U.S.', 'won', 'gold', 'including', 'low', 'feelings', 'Soviets', 'invaded', 'Afghanistan', 'Iranian', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'One', 'most', 'fascinating', 'interviews', 'whole', 'thing', 'Barry', 'Rosen', 'one', 'hostages', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'Olympics', 'returning', 'home', 'months', 'later.Of', 'course', 'highlight', 'quot', 'Do', 'Believe', 'Miracles', 'quot', 'victory', 'Soviets', 'documentary', 'uses', 'footage', 'network', 'telecast', 'highlights', 'including', 'calls', 'Al', 'Michaels', 'who', 'also', 'interviewed', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'tear', 'up', 'when', 'Eruzione', 'when', 'Michaels', 'quot', 'Do', 'Believe', 'Miracles', 'quot', 'something', 'wrong', 'players', 'reactions', 'afterwards', 'even', 'was', 'done', 'twenty', 'years', 'fact', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'touching', 'watch.Overall', 'think', 'one', 'sports', 'documentaries', 'transcends', 'time', 'Years', 'now', 'people', 'will', 'still', 'watch', 'documentary', 'still', 'cry', 'when', 'hear', 'Al', 'Michaels', 'utter', 'quot', 'Do', 'Believe', 'Miracles', 'quot']",Do You Believe in Miracles?

682162,APRU373UYVK2Y,B00005TPC7,J. N. Mohlman,"[83, 84]","I was only five when the U.S. beat the vaunted hockey juggernaut from the U.S.S.R., but the memory is one of the most distinct that I have from my early childhood.  Of course at the time I couldn't appreciate the full significance of the victory, but as I've grown older I've become more and more impressed by what occurred.  This just wasn't a hockey game, it was great power politics played out on ice, and if you think otherwise, just watch this disc.That's what makes this such an intriguing documentary, in addition to the expected player background and game highlights, and of course Al Michael's famous call, the state of the world in 1979-80 is examined.  What is revealed in the process is that literally nothing had gone right for the U.S. in the year leading up to the Olympics.  The Iran hostages, the invasion of Afghanistan, oil shortages, etc., etc.  Then, along came a group of college kids playing a sport that most Americans knew nothing about, and they started something amazing: people started getting excited about being Americans again.For at least a little while, they were America's team, and the whole country's hopes and fears were placed squarely on their backs.  And lo and behold, they delivered in a situation where no rational observer would have expected anything but defeat.Perhaps I'm being overly sentimental, but even if you're only interested in the hockey, this is a great disc.  The background material on the players, coach and the team as a whole is superb.  Moreover, the build-up to the Olympics is deftly handled; such that by the time the viewer reaches Lake Placid the tension is unbearable.My only complaint, which I've seen in other reviews, is that the entire game is not included on the disc.  This is not a particularly long documentary, and there aren't any DVD bonus features, so there would have been more than enough room.  Ultimately, though, that's a small complaint about an otherwise superb documentary.

682163,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,B00005TPC7,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[4, 5]","I was 12 when all of this went down...and a pretty naive 12 at that.  I wasn't a follower of politics and I hadn't even been to a hockey game (and the Flames were still in my hometown of Atlanta at the time) and had no point-of-reference for the sport...until the 1980 Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid.With time I've come to appreciate what the late master coach Herb Brooks and his unheralded team of amateurs were able to accomplish...and it gets more impressive every year.  With hindsight I also appreciate the boost they were able to give the American collective psyche at a time when our leadership was in doubt (to put it kindly) at the international level and our domestic economy was floundering.  We had a focal point over which we could rally...and it didn't hurt that they happened to be a helluva team of hockey players that were able to hit the old Soviet Union where it really hurt.But this video really tugs at the heartstrings of anyone who even remotely considers themselves a sports fan...the players from the team even today seem incredulous with the results of their efforts...and by the time Al Michaels utters his immortal line as the epic game with the Soviets concludes, the tears will be flowing freely.  Would it have been nice to have the US-USSR game included in its entirety as well?  Yes, most definitely...but the amount of action that is included is more than sufficient to convey the sense of accomplishment gained from the efforts of Eruzione, Craig, O'Callahan, Baker, Christian, and the rest of &quot;America's Team&quot;.Nowadays NHL players dominate Olympic hockey rosters, making the ice hockey gold medal Canada's to lose every four years; we'll likely never see a story like this one again (Salt Lake City 2002 drove this point home vividly) until the NHL gets over itself and allows the spirit of the game rather than its own need for self-promotion and sense of financial desperation to shine through.

But the actually game was set for 2 hours earlier, and it aired on a taped delay basis both in the United States, and in the Soviet Union, and I can understand it airing taped in Soiviet Union since there is a time difference, between the 2 counturies. So really nobody the outcome of the game of the game until the next morning, which was Saturday. Expect for anybody that went to the game, this is the story of the 1980 Olympic Team, that wasn't even expected to be in the medal round, but the Soviet Union, whop won it every year since 1960 was, and at the topic this game took place, bad events was happening in this country.
