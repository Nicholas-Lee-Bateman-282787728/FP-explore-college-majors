As everyone knows this is the season Darren has been replaced which sparked endless debates on which Darren was best the first or the second. For me neither of them made much of a difference.

Endora's endless spells on Darren started getting old and boring. Another new charactor was Esmeralda a bumbling witch now that Clara was gone (the actress who played her passed away).

Dick York was too neuroticly played which annoyed me at times to no end.  It was hard for me to sympathize with him when Endora cast her spells on him.  Who could blame her??Not so with Sargeant.  Sargeant is not only better looking and sexier than York, but it is a well-known fact that Elizabeth Montgomery herself preferred him to York.  Not to mention they had excellent chemistry.  Sargeant also brings a dry wit to Darrin which York did not do.  Its much easier for me to identify with him.Now that that is overwith, let's get to Season Six.  This is a step up from Season Five, which because of York's illness, Darrin was missing in many episodes.  The season has some refreshingly fun episodes such as Serena singing ""I'll Blow You a Kiss in the Wind"" with Boyce and Hart, Darrin acting out cliche's, Samantha going on eating binges and the introduction of ""Yoo-Hoo Esmerelda"" and a very funny episode about the ""Mona Lisa"".The series had plenty of life left in it and it is a season which will disappoint no real Bewitched aficionados.

1147026,A3PPSZB0W5DZH6,B0014FAIYS,"DEWEY M. ""MOVIE & MUSICAL THEATRE MAN""","[6, 7]","After a  shaky Season Five, the magic is back on track for a delightful  and enchanting Season Six of ""Bewitched."" Dick York was in terrible physical pain throughout his five year run; and he just couldn't continue on the show anymore. It is sad, but it is a fact, people. I wish ""fans"" would show Dick Sargent more respect. Dick Sargent did a wonderful job as well; and the show DID NOT ""jump the broomstick"" when Sargent took over the role of Darrin.  Does anyone else notice how ATTRACTIVE Dick Sargent is? He and Elizabeth Montgomery developed their own special chemistry and formed a wonderful friendship that lasted until Sargent's death in 1994. Sadly, Elizabeth Montgomery died in 1995.I'm not going  to get into the ""Dick York Vs. Dick Sargent"" debate; which  I've always regarded as pointless and stupid. I'll just say that Dick York as Darrin always seemed to me to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown because of Samantha's witchcraft, while Dick Sargent was exasperated by it. The transition between the two actors was handeled so subtly and smoothly as to be almost inperceptible.  The series picks up exactly where it was. Towards the end of Season 5, Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)  tells an absent Darrin over the phone that she is pregnant in ""Samantha's Good News."" At the beginning of the Season Six Opener, ""Samantha & The Beanstalk,"" Samantha is painting a crib, asking Darrin what they should name the new baby. Feeling unwanted, Tabitha (Erin Murphy) switches places with fairy tale's Jack (""Family Affair's Johnny Whittaker) and Samantha climbs up the beanstalk after her.Although a few plots are ""recycled"" ideas, that is actually a common practice on any long-running Series, and few shows remain as endearing or enduring as ""Bewitched."" (the 30 episodes of Season Six are Episodes #171-#200 in the Series). The excellent ""Bewitched"" writers deserve kudos and praise for keeping the basic premise so fresh and fun throughout numerous and varied production changes. The  Series quality and creativity remained high throughout Season Seven.  As another reviewer so astutely pointed out, boredom  DID NOT set in until Season Eight, the final season. But there is  no need to jump ahead or despair here.Season Six is especially busy and fun. Alice Ghostley (who guest-starred as maid Naomi in ""Maid To Order"" in Season Two) joins the cast as maid Esmeralda, a shy, slightly neurotic witch who keeps fading in and out. Marion Lorne, who portrayed the beloved Aunt Clara, died at the end of Season Four. Producers wanted a new character who would also ""mess up the magic"" as Clara had done-- hence, Esmeralda was created. In ""Samantha's Curious Cravings"", a very pregnant Samantha magically receives any food she thinks about. When Dr. Bombay (Bernard Fox) attempts to remedy the situation, Samantha disappears whenever she thinks about food, and ""pops over"" to wherever the food is. In a related episode, the outstanding and hilarious ""Samantha's Lost Weekend,"" Samantha accidentally drinks a glass of ""magic"" milk, and can't stop eating! I always wondered if Elizabeth Montgomery had fun filming this particular episode-- because it certainly is great fun to watch! Baby Adam is born, leading to more feelings of rejection by Tabitha; which is the plot of another memorable episode titled ""Tabitha's Very Own Samantha.""Besides Jack & The Beanstalk, other ""house guests"" in Season Six include Julius Ceasar, The Artful Dodger, Mother Goose, and Santa Claus! After two previous visits to the North Pole, Santa (Ronald Long) and all of his Elves are stranded at Samantha and Darrin's house! Henry Gibson makes a memorable guest appearance as a mischievous leprechaun sent by Endora (Agnes Moorehead) to wreck havoc in the episode ""If The Shoe Pinches."" Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde), Daddy Maurice (Maurice Evans) and wild Cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery's other delicious Series role) also add to the fun and merriment of Season Six. After all these decades, from child to adult, ""Bewitched"" ALWAYS brings a smile to my face.",4,"THE MAGIC IS BACK ON TRACK FOR  A DELIGHTFUL AND ENCHANTING ""BEWITCHED: SEASON SIX""",1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,4049,"['shaky', 'Season', 'Five', 'magic', 'back', 'track', 'delightful', 'enchanting', 'Season', 'Six', 'Bewitched', 'Dick', 'York', 'was', 'terrible', 'physical', 'pain', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'continue', 'show', 'anymore', 'sad', 'fact', 'people', 'wish', 'fans', 'would', 'show', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'more', 'respect', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'DID', 'NOT', 'jump', 'broomstick', 'when', 'Sargent', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'Darrin', 'Does', 'anyone', 'else', 'how', 'ATTRACTIVE', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'developed', 'own', 'special', 'chemistry', 'formed', 'wonderful', 'friendship', 'lasted', 'Sargent', 'death', '1994', 'Sadly', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'died', '1995.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'Dick', 'York', 'Vs.', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'debate', ""'ve"", 'always', 'regarded', 'pointless', 'stupid', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'Dick', 'York', 'Darrin', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'verge', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Samantha', 'witchcraft', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'was', 'exasperated', 'transition', 'two', 'actors', 'was', 'handeled', 'so', 'subtly', 'smoothly', 'be', 'almost', 'inperceptible', 'series', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'was', 'end', 'Season', '5', 'Samantha', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'absent', 'Darrin', 'phone', 'pregnant', 'Samantha', 'Good', 'News', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Six', 'Opener', 'Samantha', 'Beanstalk', 'Samantha', 'painting', 'crib', 'asking', 'Darrin', 'what', 'should', 'name', 'new', 'baby', 'Feeling', 'unwanted', 'Tabitha', 'Erin', 'Murphy', 'places', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Jack', 'Family', 'Affair', 'Johnny', 'Whittaker', 'Samantha', 'climbs', 'up', 'beanstalk', 'her.Although', 'few', 'plots', 'are', 'recycled', 'ideas', 'actually', 'common', 'practice', 'long-running', 'Series', 'few', 'shows', 'remain', 'endearing', 'enduring', 'Bewitched', '30', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Six', 'are', 'Episodes', '171-', '200', 'Series', 'excellent', 'Bewitched', 'writers', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'praise', 'keeping', 'basic', 'premise', 'so', 'fresh', 'fun', 'numerous', 'varied', 'production', 'changes', 'Series', 'quality', 'creativity', 'remained', 'high', 'Season', 'Seven', 'reviewer', 'so', 'astutely', 'pointed', 'out', 'boredom', 'DID', 'NOT', 'set', 'Season', 'Eight', 'final', 'season', 'need', 'jump', 'ahead', 'despair', 'here.Season', 'Six', 'especially', 'busy', 'fun', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'who', 'guest-starred', 'maid', 'Naomi', 'Maid', 'Order', 'Season', 'Two', 'cast', 'maid', 'Esmeralda', 'shy', 'slightly', 'neurotic', 'witch', 'who', 'fading', 'Marion', 'Lorne', 'who', 'portrayed', 'beloved', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'died', 'end', 'Season', 'Four', 'Producers', 'wanted', 'new', 'character', 'who', 'would', 'also', 'mess', 'up', 'magic', 'Clara', 'had', 'done', 'hence', 'Esmeralda', 'was', 'created', 'Samantha', 'Curious', 'Cravings', 'very', 'pregnant', 'Samantha', 'magically', 'food', 'about', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Bombay', 'Bernard', 'Fox', 'remedy', 'situation', 'Samantha', 'whenever', 'food', 'pops', 'wherever', 'food', 'related', 'episode', 'outstanding', 'hilarious', 'Samantha', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'Samantha', 'accidentally', 'glass', 'magic', 'milk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'eating', 'always', 'wondered', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'had', 'fun', 'filming', 'particular', 'episode', 'certainly', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'Baby', 'Adam', 'born', 'leading', 'more', 'feelings', 'rejection', 'Tabitha', 'plot', 'memorable', 'episode', 'titled', 'Tabitha', 'Very', 'Own', 'Samantha', 'Besides', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'other', 'house', 'guests', 'Season', 'Six', 'include', 'Julius', 'Ceasar', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'Mother', 'Goose', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'two', 'previous', 'visits', 'North', 'Pole', 'Santa', 'Ronald', 'Long', 'Elves', 'are', 'stranded', 'Samantha', 'Darrin', 'house', 'Henry', 'Gibson', 'memorable', 'guest', 'appearance', 'mischievous', 'leprechaun', 'sent', 'Endora', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'episode', 'Shoe', 'Pinches', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'Daddy', 'Maurice', 'Maurice', 'Evans', 'wild', 'Cousin', 'Serena', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'other', 'delicious', 'Series', 'role', 'also', 'add', 'fun', 'merriment', 'Season', 'Six', 'decades', 'child', 'adult', 'Bewitched', 'ALWAYS', 'smile', 'face']",Bewitched: Season 6

1147028,A105D0UKK3356E,B0014FAIYS,Dunestar,"[10, 10]","The Sixth Season was always the 'infamous' one for Bewitched, whereas in England, they refer it to the 'Doctor Who' Season.  Basically because Darrin secretly 'regenerates' from Dick York to Dick Sargent. I always thought it was odd the actor replacing York had the same first name.  Which tells you about how strange things happen on Bewitched.Ironically, the TLR (Time Lord Regeneration) Effect hit Bewitched with Louise Tate and Gladys Kravitz and apparently no one really seemed to care. The truth was as Lucille Ball originally wanted Gale Gordon as Fred Mertz, Sargent was first picked for Darrin due to his subtle wild expressions.  But regrettably, due to contractual obligations neither were available at the time.The problem I believe was with the Sixth Season was not as so much the Darrin Regeneration Effect bugging audience members, but it seemed the writers loved added new characters and such through each episode.  Though there were some new stories written, others were simply modernized rehashes of classic York episodes but with a twist.For instance whereas Endora splits Darrin's work side and fun side in the original York season of the show, it's because she wants Samantha to have fun.  But in the Sargent version, Endora pulls the same stunt again (ironically) to help 'Durwood' be with her daughter while still attending an important business meeting in Japan.Meanwhile, Alice Ghostley returned to the fold, but this time as Esmeralda, the housemaid with botched up magic.  As with Paul Lynde, Ghostley played a mortal character.  Except in a mysteriously ironic form, Ghostley played a bumbling housekeeper who Sam helps out when Louise needs a housekeeper for her party.But I digress, as we know Esmeralda was essentially the replacement for Aunt Clara, except out of respect to Marion Lorre, she was written as a witch with dwindling powers, who's magic was set off by sneezing, or mishandled spells.Then there came Adam, which of course, was to coincide with Elizabeth Montgomery's real pregnancy, and also helped bring charm to the show as Erin Murphy took over the role as Tabitha.But the real gem of this Season was Serena getting Boyce and Hart for her Cotillion.  In 1969, apparently rock stars guesting on shows was a new staple for sitcoms, and Bewitched was no exception.  Of course, Montgomery shows off her talent as Serena when singing 'Blow You a Kiss in the Wind.'  An actual song this time composed for the episode, rather than the 'If'n Song,' Serena sang in the Fourth Season.But strangely enough, the Sixth Season mysteriously held onto its viewers.  Though the new Darrin was taken with a grain of salt, the new characters and situations focusing also on Tabitha as well as Samantha kept them watching.Even if you're not a fan of Sargent, the other characters keep the series going and prepared the ground work for the wild global-trotting Seventh Season. Definitely give this DVD Set worth a look, because even when The Doctor was forced to change, never really hurt his series none.

The only down side for me is there is no English subtitles but there is closed captioning so it works out.  The first season was originally in black and white, the entire season I believe, so having it colorized is somewhat of a disappointment.  Beyond those complaints I LOVE it!  This is the year that Dick Sargent replaced Dick York who's physical ailments often kept his from working on the series and why in many episodes Darrin simply was out of town or they would reflect back to some earlier episode in memory airing it in place of a new one.

Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[47, 50]","Opening the 6th Season (1969-1970) with Dick Sergeant, replacing Dick York, was going to be both challenging and somwhat of a gamble to see if fans of the show would continue to be entralled and in love with America's (and the world's!) favorite housewife witch!  With some of the most creative and memorable episodes, showcasing all of the actors talents, the season remained a favorite with fans! Here is a list of the 30 episodes in the Season 6 dvd set!1 Samantha and the Beanstalk - As the 1969-1970 season begins, we are greeted by an all-new Darrin Stephens (Dick Sergeant).

Dr. Bombay helps her out with her condition, but it doesn't work because now she goes to the food!5 ...And Something Makes Four - Samantha gives birth to her second child, Adam!

When A.J. and the bunny have lunch together, A.J.'s ex-girlfriend comes up, sees him and leaves in anger. Samantha invites A.J. and Bunny to dinner and A.J. announces that they are to be engaged. But that doesn't last long when Bunny's rabbit qualities finally come to light.9 Samantha's Secret Spell - Darrin is doomed to become a mouse by midnight, and Samantha tries to get him to do some Jackass-style methods to stop this magic happening from occurring.10 Daddy Comes for a Visit (1) - Maurice gives Darrin a magic watch, giving him magical powers, much to the dismay of Samantha.11 Darrin the Warlock (2) - Darrin has a ball with his newfound magical powers.

Because of all this, Phyllis commits herself to a nursing home, convinced that she is a lunatic.19 Tabitha's Very Own Samantha - Tabitha wants to go to the park, but Samantha tells her that she has a lot of chores to do around the house.

Gladys sees them there and asks about Adam and gets no response. Gladys calls Darrin, who calls Samantha who doesn't know what is going on.

1147034,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B0014FAIYS,Green Manalishi,"[0, 0]","And there are more than a few reasons for this.  Perhaps first and foremost is that Tabitha stars in a good number of epsides with both cute and hilarious results.  I always loved the Tabitha episodes even as a child.  Second reason this season is so great is the writing - the episodes are even more clever than I remember them and are  in many cases, better than those of earlier seasons.  Third reason this season is indispensible is that the year is now 1969 and it is so fun to watch ""the times"" going on in the background.. the hippies, the clothing styles, the attitudes.. you watch Bewitched season 6 and you get a small time window of 1969.  Can anybody say 'psychedelic'?  Many of these episodes could have been borrowed from an acid trip, and you can't help getting the feeling that maybe the writers had been doing a little dabbling themselves, it being 1969 and all.  Fourth reason this season rocks is Dick Sargent.  Dick York was the original Darrin and I really liked him too, though I couldn't help liking the energy that Dick Sargent seemed to bring out in Samantha.  Which brings us to the fifth reason this season rocks and that is Sam herself.  She's almost sexier than she's been in previous seasons.  Again, could've just been the times or maybe it was who she was playing off of as well.  There just seemed to be a little more chemistry between her and Dick Sargent, much as I hate to imply any disrespect to the original Darrin, Dick York.  York was a little more frenetic, overly worrisome at times, and hate to admit it but I find Sargent's less overly wrought countenance to bring a smoother energy to the show.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the first 5 seasons as well, although truth be told, I found things getting a little stale by the end of season 3 and half into season 4.  I personally put this Season 6 among my other two favorite seasons - the first and second.Before watching it I actually didn't think this season would be that great - boy, was I wrong.  Perhaps men will have more to enjoy this season than women.  Elizibeth Montgomery as Samantha is not only ravishingly beautiful, but amazingly talented as well.  It's a gas watching her do far out Serena right beside herself as the ever wholesome Samantha.  I think I've found this season's Serena more interesting and entertaining than in previous seasons as well.  Don't think of this as season 6 - think of it as season 1969 and you're on the right track.  I'm looking forward to the next two seasons as this one was a wealth of treasures for a Bewitched fan who thought he'd seen the best of it seasons ago.",5,Don't listen to the critics - Season 6 is excellent,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,2610,"['are', 'more', 'few', 'reasons', 'Perhaps', 'first', 'foremost', 'Tabitha', 'stars', 'good', 'number', 'epsides', 'cute', 'hilarious', 'results', 'always', 'loved', 'Tabitha', 'episodes', 'even', 'child', 'Second', 'reason', 'season', 'so', 'great', 'writing', 'episodes', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'clever', 'remember', 'are', 'many', 'cases', 'better', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Third', 'reason', 'season', 'indispensible', 'year', 'now', '1969', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'times', 'going', 'background..', 'hippies', 'clothing', 'styles', 'attitudes..', 'watch', 'Bewitched', 'season', '6', 'get', 'small', 'time', 'window', '1969', 'Can', 'anybody', 'say', ""'psychedelic"", 'Many', 'episodes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'borrowed', 'acid', 'trip', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'getting', 'feeling', 'maybe', 'writers', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'little', 'dabbling', 'being', '1969', 'Fourth', 'reason', 'season', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'Dick', 'York', 'was', 'original', 'Darrin', 'really', 'liked', 'too', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'energy', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'seemed', 'bring', 'out', 'Samantha', 'Which', 'fifth', 'reason', 'season', 'rocks', 'Sam', 'almost', 'sexier', 'been', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Again', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'times', 'maybe', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'playing', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'chemistry', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'much', 'hate', 'imply', 'disrespect', 'original', 'Darrin', 'Dick', 'York', 'York', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'frenetic', 'overly', 'worrisome', 'times', 'hate', 'admit', 'find', 'Sargent', 'less', 'overly', 'wrought', 'countenance', 'bring', 'smoother', 'energy', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'fan', 'first', '5', 'seasons', 'as', 'well', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'found', 'things', 'getting', 'little', 'stale', 'end', 'season', '3', 'half', 'season', '4', 'personally', 'put', 'Season', '6', 'other', 'two', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'first', 'second.Before', 'watching', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'Perhaps', 'men', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'enjoy', 'season', 'women', 'Elizibeth', 'Montgomery', 'Samantha', 'not', 'only', 'ravishingly', 'beautiful', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'as', 'well', 'gas', 'watching', 'do', 'far', 'out', 'Serena', 'right', 'beside', 'ever', 'wholesome', 'Samantha', 'think', ""'ve"", 'found', 'season', 'Serena', 'more', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'previous', 'seasons', 'well', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', '6', 'think', 'season', '1969', ""'re"", 'right', 'track', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'one', 'was', 'wealth', 'treasures', 'Bewitched', 'fan', 'who', 'thought', ""'d"", 'seen', 'best', 'ago']",Bewitched: Season 6

He soured the milk (and our stomachs) every time he was on the screen. His raving seemed a bit too natural for him than just acting. We couldn't have been more happy to be rid of him.We felt bad about York's back injury and sorry he had to go through that suffering which cost him his acting career... but it still doesn't change the fact that a lot of us were glad to see Dick Sargent in his place.This was the season which set the character Samantha free of the raving and brought in a softer, more gentle, kinder Darrin #2 played by Dick Sargent. It was also the season when we stopped getting sour stomachs from York's raving and ranting.Once you have lived around or been subjected to a raving, abusive control freak like Darrin #1 in real life... you would understand how horrible it is to be around someone like that 365 days a year. So there was no pleasure in watching a TV show featuring a creep like that. If not for the characters of Samantha and Endora plus the entertaining magical nature of the series... the offensive nature of his condescending, overbearing, chauvinistic, controlling, raving, abuse as portrayed by York would have driven off many of the viewers.

But here we are with Dick Sargent as the new ""Derwood."" I'll say right off the bat, that I don't hate Sargent. I don't hate anyone, not even Joe Besser as a stooge, but that's a different subject entirely.Let's just say that while watching the Season 6 episodes, I have a hard time forgetting Dick York & how great he was in the role. It's even evident in the episodes where ""Darwin"" and Endora are going at it, that I just can't help think how fun it was to watch York & Agnes Moorehead go back and forth, whereas with Sargent & Agnes it just seems like petty sniping.And the writers for the show definitely seem to start repeating themes more often than usual. That's usually the first sign of a sitcom in trouble, i.e. the first episode that Sargent actually filmed as the new Darrin, ""Samantha's Better Halves"" which was a remake of a classic Dick York episode from Season 2.Also repeated from a past season is the idea of Sam's father Maurice giving Darrin a charm which will grant him magic powers. Of course, this idea was brought up in what was Dick York's final episode as Darrin in Season 5 and gets stretched out into a 2-part episode in year 6, where once again we see the familiar idea of Darrin getting intoxicated with magical powers.Season 6 also gave us the new character of Esmeralda, a bumbling but well meaning witch whose powers are past their prime (sound familiar). Basically, Esmeralda was seemingly created with the idea of filling the void left by the late, great Marion Lorne who delighted viewers of the show as Aunt Clara for the first 4 years of Bewitched.At least the producers of the show were smart enough not to try and call Alice Ghostley the new ""Aunt Clara."" Of course, I can't help but compare Esmeralda to Clara and Clara was irreplaceable. But, there are many who would say the same for the character of Darrin Stephens.I don't mean to sound like I'm totally slamming this year of Bewitched. I'm a longtime fan of the show and loved (for the most part) the first 5 years of the show. Maybe by the time I get to Season 7 I'll have totally warmed up to the new ""Derwood.""

The most obvious change was the replacement of Dick York by Dick Sargent as Darren. York had a serious back problem that kept him from working, and facing pressure from ABC, both Liz Montgomery and Bill Asher had no choice but to replace him. This was also the year the Ashers made Ashmont Productions. This compnay would go on to produce the remaining years of ""Bewitched"". At the end of the 5th season Elizabeth and William Asher wanted to close production, but ABC, not wanting to lose a hit show, gave them part ownership of the series and huge salary increases.Another change was the show's opening. There is new animation featuring Samantha on her broom, along with the new ""Darren"", and we now have an announcer saying, ""Elizabeth Montgomery in...""Bewitched"""".30 episodes are included with this boxset and they look clean and crisp as if they were made yesterday. However, the scripts this season started to wane, as they are not as innovative and original as the five previous seasons. Still, if you are an ardent ""Bewitched"" fan, like me, pick up this season to help complete your collection.On a final note, since Marion Lorne had died it was important to have a ""dumb"" witch on the show. Alice Ghostley appears this season as Esmeralda, a witch with weak powers who fades whenever she gets nervous. Her performance is both funny and outrageous.On a sad note, this was also the year ""Bewitched"" lost a substantial portion of their audience. This was due to the recast of a major player in the series. The show finished at #25, after being at #12 the previous year: a loss of many million viewers. The final Nielsen ratings for the 1969-1970 season was a 20.6.",5,"A New ""Bewitched"" Debuts""",1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,1734,"['Bewitched', 'changed', 'many', 'fronts', '6th', 'season', '1969-1970', 'most', 'obvious', 'change', 'was', 'replacement', 'Dick', 'York', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'Darren', 'York', 'had', 'serious', 'back', 'problem', 'kept', 'working', 'facing', 'pressure', 'ABC', 'Liz', 'Montgomery', 'Bill', 'Asher', 'had', 'choice', 'replace', 'was', 'also', 'year', 'Ashers', 'made', 'Ashmont', 'Productions', 'compnay', 'would', 'go', 'produce', 'remaining', 'years', 'Bewitched', 'end', '5th', 'season', 'Elizabeth', 'William', 'Asher', 'wanted', 'close', 'production', 'ABC', 'not', 'wanting', 'lose', 'hit', 'show', 'gave', 'part', 'ownership', 'series', 'huge', 'salary', 'increases.Another', 'change', 'was', 'show', 'opening', 'new', 'animation', 'featuring', 'Samantha', 'broom', 'new', 'Darren', 'now', 'have', 'announcer', 'saying', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'Bewitched', '.30', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'boxset', 'look', 'clean', 'crisp', 'were', 'made', 'yesterday', 'However', 'scripts', 'season', 'started', 'wane', 'are', 'not', 'innovative', 'original', 'five', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Still', 'are', 'ardent', 'Bewitched', 'fan', 'pick', 'up', 'season', 'help', 'complete', 'collection.On', 'final', 'note', 'Marion', 'Lorne', 'had', 'died', 'was', 'important', 'have', 'dumb', 'witch', 'show', 'Alice', 'Ghostley', 'season', 'Esmeralda', 'witch', 'weak', 'powers', 'who', 'fades', 'whenever', 'nervous', 'performance', 'funny', 'sad', 'note', 'was', 'also', 'year', 'Bewitched', 'lost', 'substantial', 'portion', 'audience', 'was', 'due', 'recast', 'major', 'player', 'series', 'show', 'finished', '25', 'being', '12', 'previous', 'year', 'loss', 'many', 'million', 'viewers', 'final', 'Nielsen', 'ratings', '1969-1970', 'season', 'was', '20.6']",Bewitched: Season 6

The classic cars of that era were the best part of watching these episodes because of the fact that I grew up with those cars and I am a auto buff.Glad that these classic shows are offered on DVD without commercials since I am not a fan of what is on TV today.I also liked that these DVDs were one sided as opposed to many two sided DVDs that are easy to fingerprint or scratch since both sides are used to view.
