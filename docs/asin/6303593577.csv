381074,A3IHBZ11SOGZQ8,6303593577,lexo1941,"[1, 2]","Knut Hamsun's 1890 novel 'Hunger' is not, on the face of it, a promising candidate to be made into a masterpiece of world cinema film.  For a start, it's a really good book, and books this good tend to become bad movies.  The narrator, a down-at-heel intellectual and would-be genius, is scuffling around Christiania (now known as Oslo) in search of a lot of things, but mostly greatness, food, money and company, in descending order of importance.  However, his pride is so enormous that he can't bear to accept charity from anyone, and so his acute physical hunger soon becomes his main sensation.  It's the kind of novel that sensitive literary young men with no money always reckon they have in them somewhere, but which when written usually turns out to be a self-indulgent mess.  Hamsun, practically alone among the species, got it right.  The book is written with an extraordinary mixture of deep sympathy for its infuriating narrator, but also ironic objectivity about his capacity to be his own worst enemy.So how do you make a movie out of a story that just follows this weird, obsessive, self-absorbed egotist around a nineteenth century city?  One thing you do at the start is cast Per Oscarsson.  The Norwegian actor gives the performance of a lifetime as the film's main character, who unlike in the novel is given a name - Pontus.  Oscarsson, painfully thin, unshaven, bespectacled, dressed in a tight, shabby suit and perpetually carrying around a bundle of his unpublished manuscripts, is riveting.  He moves in quick, sharp, hesitant motions like some kind of neurotic seabird, and he keeps up a constant little mumble to himself, a running commentary on how well his day is going and what he wants to do next and what he thinks of the people around him and the city and anything else that comes into his head.  Pontus is visibly going mad with hunger.It probably sounds like a deeply depressing film, but it's not.  The black comedy of Pontus' encounters with people, his absurd attempt to present himself as a more successful and satisfied person than he really is, are what make this film so watchable.  The only character in film that I could compare him to is David Thewlis' bitter lumpen-intellectual drifter Johnny in Mike Leigh's 'Naked', but Thewlis' character is more paranoid, bitter and selfish, sponging off everyone around him, while Pontus not only refuses to accept the slightest gesture of charity from anyone, he also refuses to feel sorry for himself.  Ultimately, there's something weirdly noble about him.It's a great performance in a great, haunting film, warmer than Bresson or Bergman and funnier than either.",5,Stunning,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,2651,"['Knut', 'Hamsun', '1890', 'novel', 'not', 'face', 'promising', 'candidate', 'be', 'made', 'masterpiece', 'world', 'cinema', 'film', 'start', 'really', 'good', 'book', 'books', 'good', 'tend', 'become', 'bad', 'movies', 'narrator', 'down-at-heel', 'intellectual', 'would-be', 'genius', 'scuffling', 'around', 'Christiania', 'now', 'known', 'Oslo', 'search', 'lot', 'things', 'mostly', 'greatness', 'food', 'money', 'company', 'descending', 'order', 'importance', 'However', 'pride', 'so', 'enormous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'accept', 'charity', 'anyone', 'so', 'acute', 'physical', 'hunger', 'soon', 'main', 'sensation', 'kind', 'novel', 'sensitive', 'literary', 'young', 'men', 'money', 'always', 'reckon', 'have', 'somewhere', 'when', 'written', 'usually', 'out', 'be', 'self-indulgent', 'mess', 'Hamsun', 'practically', 'alone', 'species', 'got', 'right', 'book', 'written', 'extraordinary', 'mixture', 'deep', 'sympathy', 'infuriating', 'narrator', 'also', 'ironic', 'objectivity', 'capacity', 'be', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy.So', 'how', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'story', 'just', 'weird', 'obsessive', 'self-absorbed', 'egotist', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'city', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'start', 'cast', 'Per', 'Oscarsson', 'Norwegian', 'actor', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'novel', 'given', 'name', 'Pontus', 'Oscarsson', 'painfully', 'thin', 'unshaven', 'bespectacled', 'dressed', 'tight', 'shabby', 'suit', 'perpetually', 'carrying', 'around', 'bundle', 'unpublished', 'manuscripts', 'riveting', 'quick', 'sharp', 'hesitant', 'motions', 'kind', 'neurotic', 'seabird', 'up', 'constant', 'little', 'mumble', 'running', 'commentary', 'how', 'well', 'day', 'going', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'what', 'people', 'city', 'anything', 'else', 'head', 'Pontus', 'visibly', 'going', 'mad', 'hunger.It', 'probably', 'deeply', 'depressing', 'film', 'not', 'black', 'comedy', 'Pontus', 'encounters', 'people', 'absurd', 'attempt', 'present', 'more', 'successful', 'satisfied', 'person', 'really', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'watchable', 'only', 'character', 'film', 'could', 'compare', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'bitter', 'lumpen-intellectual', 'drifter', 'Johnny', 'Mike', 'Leigh', ""'Naked"", 'Thewlis', 'character', 'more', 'paranoid', 'bitter', 'selfish', 'sponging', 'off', 'everyone', 'Pontus', 'not', 'only', 'accept', 'slightest', 'gesture', 'charity', 'anyone', 'also', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Ultimately', 'something', 'weirdly', 'noble', 'him.It', 'great', 'performance', 'great', 'haunting', 'film', 'warmer', 'Bresson', 'Bergman', 'funnier']",Hunger VHS

381076,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6303593577,Reviewer,"[11, 23]","An intriguing character study that focuses on a few days in the life of a writer in 1890 Christiania, ""Hunger,"" directed by Henning Carlsen, stars Per Oscarsson as Pontus, a starving artist seeking more than just the sustenance of food.  Though living in the middle of town, he is emotionally isolated, cut off from the real world because of a perpetual state of disorientation that makes connecting with any reality beyond that which exists in his own mind impossible.  Psychological, as well as physical hunger induces the erratic, irrational behavior he exhibits, often at the most inopportune times.  Working sporadically on an article throughout the day, the bulk of his time is spent dreaming-- at times hallucinating-- and simply struggling for survival.  Yet his suffering is seemingly by choice; there are indications throughout the film that leaving the city to go back to the country, and apparently his home, is an option that is open to him.  One he rejects, however, out-of-hand.  And while he longs for nourishment of soul and body, because of his mental state and his inability to negotiate even the simplest social amenities, his needs remain elusive, just out of reach.  Pontus fails to recognize that the pride and ego that may have at one time sparked the flint of his artistry have now become detrimental, not only to his work, but to his very existence.Carlsen's presentation is fairly academic, and the clinical approach he takes to the material has a way of keeping the audience somewhat at arms length; it doesn't afford the emotional involvement that would've made this a memorable film.  As it is, it's compelling to a point, but never manages to deliver what it seems to promise, especially early on.  Though Carlsen does a good job overall-- his characters are believable, and the pace he sets, aided by the stark black &amp; white photography, exacts that sense of realism necessary for a film like this to work-- it would've been interesting to see this story developed by someone like Ingmar Bergman, who always had his finger on the pulse of his material and had an affinity for being able to convey the innate humanity of his characters to the screen.  Carlsen simply doesn't take the story far-- or deep--enough.  And the brief interlude Pontus has with a young woman he calls Ylajali (Gunnel Lindblom) stretches credibility a bit, while the ambiguity of the Rimbaudesque ending is less than satisfying.Oscarsson gives a solid performance as Pontus, his manner and appearance evoking a cross between Tom Courtenay and Guy Pearce; but there's nothing in the character or the way he's played to elicit much sympathy.  In the end you're left with the feeling that all of what has happened is rather self-indulgent and unnecessary, while raising some question as to the prudence of suffering for one's art.  For how can one deprived of physical and mental faculties hope to create?  And that is the very issue it appeared Carlsen was attempting to address until the very end of the film, which compromises any statement he had intended to make.The supporting cast includes Birgitte Federspiel (Ylajali's Sister), Knud Rex (Landlord), Hans W. Petersen (Grocer) and Henki Kolstad (Editor).  An interesting, but less than engrossing character study, ""Hunger"" in the end, is a slice-of-life examination of the human condition that comes up a bit short and leaves you with a feeling every bit as ambiguous as the ending.  Had Carlsen been able to maintain the strength of the early part of the film and carry it through to the end, it could've been exceptional; as it is, for those interested in all aspects of filmmaking and who invite comparison, it's worth a look.  But anyone seeking an in-depth, riveting character study, or especially those just looking for an evening's entertainment, would be better served looking elsewhere.",3,To Suffer for One's Art,1027641600,"07 26, 2002",2002,3859,"['intriguing', 'character', 'study', 'few', 'days', 'life', 'writer', '1890', 'Christiania', 'Hunger', 'directed', 'Henning', 'Carlsen', 'Per', 'Oscarsson', 'Pontus', 'starving', 'artist', 'seeking', 'more', 'just', 'sustenance', 'food', 'living', 'middle', 'town', 'emotionally', 'isolated', 'cut', 'off', 'real', 'world', 'perpetual', 'state', 'disorientation', 'connecting', 'reality', 'own', 'mind', 'impossible', 'Psychological', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'hunger', 'erratic', 'irrational', 'behavior', 'often', 'most', 'inopportune', 'times', 'Working', 'sporadically', 'article', 'day', 'bulk', 'time', 'spent', 'dreaming', 'times', 'hallucinating', 'simply', 'struggling', 'survival', 'suffering', 'seemingly', 'choice', 'are', 'indications', 'film', 'leaving', 'city', 'go', 'back', 'country', 'apparently', 'home', 'option', 'open', 'One', 'however', 'out-of-hand', 'nourishment', 'soul', 'body', 'mental', 'state', 'inability', 'negotiate', 'even', 'simplest', 'social', 'amenities', 'needs', 'remain', 'elusive', 'just', 'reach', 'Pontus', 'recognize', 'pride', 'ego', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'sparked', 'flint', 'artistry', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'detrimental', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'very', 'existence.Carlsen', 'presentation', 'fairly', 'academic', 'clinical', 'approach', 'material', 'way', 'keeping', 'audience', 'somewhat', 'arms', 'length', ""n't"", 'afford', 'emotional', 'involvement', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'memorable', 'film', 'compelling', 'point', 'never', 'deliver', 'what', 'promise', 'especially', 'early', 'Carlsen', 'good', 'job', 'overall', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'pace', 'aided', 'stark', 'black', 'amp', 'white', 'photography', 'sense', 'realism', 'necessary', 'film', 'work', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'story', 'developed', 'someone', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'finger', 'pulse', 'material', 'had', 'affinity', 'being', 'able', 'convey', 'innate', 'humanity', 'characters', 'screen', 'Carlsen', 'simply', ""n't"", 'take', 'story', 'far', 'deep', 'enough', 'brief', 'interlude', 'Pontus', 'young', 'woman', 'Ylajali', 'Gunnel', 'Lindblom', 'credibility', 'bit', 'ambiguity', 'Rimbaudesque', 'ending', 'less', 'satisfying.Oscarsson', 'solid', 'performance', 'Pontus', 'manner', 'appearance', 'evoking', 'cross', 'Tom', 'Courtenay', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'nothing', 'character', 'way', 'played', 'elicit', 'much', 'sympathy', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'feeling', 'what', 'happened', 'rather', 'self-indulgent', 'unnecessary', 'raising', 'question', 'prudence', 'suffering', 'one', 'art', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'deprived', 'physical', 'mental', 'faculties', 'hope', 'create', 'very', 'issue', 'appeared', 'Carlsen', 'was', 'attempting', 'address', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'statement', 'had', 'intended', 'make.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Birgitte', 'Federspiel', 'Ylajali', 'Sister', 'Knud', 'Rex', 'Landlord', 'Hans', 'W.', 'Petersen', 'Grocer', 'Henki', 'Kolstad', 'Editor', 'interesting', 'less', 'engrossing', 'character', 'study', 'Hunger', 'end', 'slice-of-life', 'examination', 'human', 'condition', 'up', 'bit', 'short', 'feeling', 'bit', 'as', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'Had', 'Carlsen', 'been', 'able', 'maintain', 'strength', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'carry', 'end', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exceptional', 'interested', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'who', 'invite', 'comparison', 'look', 'anyone', 'seeking', 'in-depth', 'riveting', 'character', 'study', 'especially', 'just', 'looking', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'looking', 'elsewhere']",Hunger VHS
