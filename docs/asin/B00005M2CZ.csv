Granted the second episode is a lot better than the first but still relative to the other episodes in TOS-dom, it is still forgettable.  The other reviewers have done a good job of explaining why the first episode is brainless but the scriptwriting of the second episode is also subpar and while the plot is a little more interesting and believable, the overall episode still falls short of what we are used to from prior episodes.

665109,AEV640MKB3I9J,B00005M2CZ,Hank Drake,"[10, 10]","Two very different episodes, which underscore the uneven quality of Star Trek's third season, are contained in Volume 31 of Paramount's complete Trek reissue.Spock's Brain is generally acknowledged as the worst episode of Classic Trek ever.  Viewing it again confirms this.  The concept is inane, the plot medically and scientifically ridiculous, and the dialogue laughably bad.  About the only positive aspect of this episode was the installation of a rear projection screen on the bridge set, which allowed for new camera angles.  Parts of this episode were brilliantly lampooned on TV's The Wonder Years.  As with the episode And The Children Shall Lead, this story is best ignored or saved for gag viewing during a party.Is There in Truth No Beauty? is the antithesis of Spock's Brain.  The story is intellectually engaging, and the dialogue at times borders on the poetic.  The plot deals with several interesting themes: how non-corporeal and corporeal life would &quot;relate&quot; to each other; love and rejection; beauty/ugliness; and the role of the handicapped in 23rd Century society.  The acting is some of the best ever seen on Trek.  Leonard Nimoy, in particular, shines during his mind-meld scene with the Medusan Kollos.  Diana Muldaur, who has a radiant yet wounded quality, is perfectly cast as Miranda Jones.  Some new visuals were created for this episode, and a rarely seen shot of the Enterprise from Trek's 1964 pilot The Cage is used briefly.The sound restoration is excellent. The picture is mostly fine, except for a few instances of wear visible in Is There in Truth No Beauty.  This episode also contains a &quot;flipped&quot; shot of William Shatner, which has never been corrected.",3,Brain and Brain!

665110,A1G9IV3IBW8WMP,B00005M2CZ,Jared Insell,"[3, 4]","Volume 31 of The Star Trek DVD Series includes two decent episodes from the haphazard third and final season of the show.Indeed SPOCK'S BRAIN has become a punching bag for Star Trek critics over the years since it's airing in 1968.  I'll agree that it isn't one of the best Star Trek episodes out there but it receives way too much criticism.  Yes the episode is too out of this world to comprehend completely however it's still not a terrible epiosode.  The plot is entertaining as a race of Imorg humanoids steal Spock's brain.  You gotta give the cast credit for this one especially Leonard Nimoy who not only had to play a unemotional Vulcan for three years but also had to play an unemotional Vulcan without a brain!  This episode is actually quite nice despite it's constant criticism.  There is a delightful helping of eye candy as well with the women humanoids who steal Spock's brain.  They will bring ""delight"" to male viewers indeed!IS THERE NO TRUTH IN BEAUTY is another average episode from Star Trek's third season.  Another episode that focuses on Spock.  A strangely dark yet compelling episode with a few thrilling twists and turns.  As the crew tries to transport the Medusan Ambassador (whose apparently so hideous that one look at him will drive a human insane) but end up being lost in space!  A nice guest star appearance by Diana Muldaur (who appeared perviously in RETURN TO TOMORROW in season 2)  Despite her appearance (as a different character then she was in season 2) IS THERE NO TRUTH IN BEAUTY remains an average episode at best.Overall a nice DVD collection of decent episodes but there is notihng too special about this one.

The search is on for Spock, the search for his brain anyway, as McCoy keeps his body alive with electronics.Locating the alien's planet the crew beam down to investigate. The crew are quickly captured, and imprisoned by 'pain-belts'. All the men on the planet are imprisoned by 'pain-belts'. Women who rule this society, need these belts to keep men in line. Why didn't they think to bring along Uhuru... In fact, I think Uhuru does lead a team down for the rescue.His brain's alive. They find and communicate with Spock - realizing his brain's been taken by these aliens in order that it can run their society. For example, Spock senses he's breathing, but he's only activating environmental controls. These women aren't very technologically advanced themselves. They're only using technology left over from olden times and the crew manage to escape and free Spock. McCoy uses their advanced technology to set things right, and this society is returned to it's 'normal' course.This episode is known for being bad, however, this episode has many great Star Trek themes: showing disembodied consciousness, technology that can vastly speed up learning, and primitives who have access to advanced technology (either technology from their own past or alien technology {in one Trek episode, Errand of Mercy, they come across the 'Organians' who appear to be very primitive, only to find out at the end, they are extremely advanced. Their leader saying, ""While it's true, in time, you and the Klingons will become fast-friends..."" Spock observes, ""I should think the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale - as we are above the Amoeba""}). Of course, the pain-belts, being needed to control the men is unique to this episode...'Spocks Brain' is known as being the worst Star Trek episode, it's like the kid in class everyone picks on. Like the kid in class everyone picks on, is this one really that much different from the others?It's no big deal to poke fun at this episode, I suppose it's fun. Even the biggest fans sometimes enjoy making fun of this or that about Star Trek. Is it a good thing to make fun of oneself? Sometimes I wonder whether it is or not...Perhaps the criticism of this episode reveals more about the critic than it reveals about the episode. Perhaps, in the way bullying takes place in 'The Mysterious Stranger' by Mark Twain; kids pick on other kids because ultimately they are afraid of being picked on themselves.Lets laugh at ourselves and not be afraid of being made fun of? Or, lets protect ourselves and others, and show real sympathy towards someone who is being made fun of? We all love to laugh.
