1191987,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B001FQHQ7S,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[12, 12]","Both jazz fans and country fans will love the recent collaboration between trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and country music icon Willie Nelson. When their two performances at Jazz From Lincoln Center in January 2007 were recorded and released by Blue Note this summer, the album jumped to the top of the jazz, pop and country charts. Thanks to Eagle Eye Media, the ""match made in heaven"" is available to see, as well as to hear, on Willie and Wynton"" Live From Lincoln Center. The 85-minute film (not video) contains extended solos and, on hot numbers like Louis Jordan's ""Caldonia"", Nelson plays his acoustic guitar as though he was always playing jazz. The camera moves very quickly and rarely spends more than five seconds on an image, which is the only defect I could find. This is an historic moment and the performances of old pop and jazz standards create a DVD  I'll certainly watch again.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""/In The Groove",4,"If You've only HEARD the CD, you are missing half the experience!",1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,939,"['jazz', 'fans', 'country', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'recent', 'collaboration', 'trumpeter', 'Wynton', 'Marsalis', 'country', 'music', 'icon', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'When', 'two', 'performances', 'Jazz', 'From', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'January', '2007', 'were', 'recorded', 'released', 'Blue', 'Note', 'summer', 'album', 'jumped', 'top', 'jazz', 'pop', 'country', 'charts', 'Thanks', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'Media', 'match', 'made', 'heaven', 'available', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'hear', 'Willie', 'Wynton', 'Live', 'From', 'Lincoln', 'Center', '85-minute', 'film', 'not', 'video', 'extended', 'solos', 'hot', 'numbers', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'Caldonia', 'Nelson', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'was', 'always', 'playing', 'jazz', 'camera', 'very', 'quickly', 'rarely', 'more', 'five', 'seconds', 'image', 'only', 'defect', 'could', 'find', 'historic', 'moment', 'performances', 'old', 'pop', 'jazz', 'standards', 'create', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'watch', 'again.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', 'Groove']","Willie Nelson/Wynton Marsalis: Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center, NYC"
1191988,A24SCQDYI50MWR,B001FQHQ7S,"William E Donoghue ""Fessor Mojo""","[9, 9]","I'm a long time fan of both Willie and Wynton and I can tell you that this intimate and spectacular concert is played at a much higher artistic level than I have ever seen or expected from both.Wynton does not try to upstage but to complement Willie like a true second line musician. He uses a wide variety of mutes, colors and even singing and humble, involved and charming commentary to make his points.Willie's guitar playing is amazing. He takes his usual Django Reinhart-inspired acoustic guitar style to reach deep into his soul to draw a high-level jazz performance out of his heart He swings like never before.Sharing the front-line with Willie and Wynton is the surprising leadership of Mickey Rafael, Willies harmonica players. Insteadof choosing to use a Little Walter ""Mississippi saxophone"" style or a straight harp country harp style, Rafael draws deep in his sould to pull out a Sonny Boy Williamson II style ""St. Louis"" trumpet sound which like Clark Terry and Miles Davis emphasized economy of notes and maximizes sound colors and feeling. His performance is so striking that the documentarian has to insert a short discussion of Mickey Rafaelto answer ""Who was that guy on harp?"" questons.I spent two hours a couple of years in Wynton's NY condo sipping on a glass of Armanac as we discussed Sonny Boy Williamson II's story and the institutionalized racism of the Mississippi delta. He called his children and ex-wife, listened to a couple of students who stopped by, and taught a few more some advice on the phone all the timewriting a book and some music with his trademark trumpet on the table. He's the real deal and exactly like the Wynton you see in the documentary.Enjoy.",5,Willie and Wynton working at a high level of feeling and swing,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,1696,"[""'m"", 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Willie', 'Wynton', 'can', 'tell', 'intimate', 'spectacular', 'concert', 'played', 'much', 'higher', 'artistic', 'level', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'expected', 'both.Wynton', 'not', 'try', 'upstage', 'complement', 'Willie', 'true', 'second', 'line', 'musician', 'wide', 'variety', 'mutes', 'colors', 'even', 'singing', 'humble', 'involved', 'charming', 'commentary', 'make', 'points.Willie', 'guitar', 'playing', 'amazing', 'usual', 'Django', 'Reinhart-inspired', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'style', 'reach', 'deep', 'soul', 'draw', 'high-level', 'jazz', 'performance', 'heart', 'swings', 'never', 'before.Sharing', 'front-line', 'Willie', 'Wynton', 'surprising', 'leadership', 'Mickey', 'Rafael', 'Willies', 'players', 'Insteadof', 'choosing', 'use', 'Little', 'Walter', 'Mississippi', 'saxophone', 'style', 'straight', 'harp', 'country', 'harp', 'style', 'Rafael', 'deep', 'sould', 'pull', 'out', 'Sonny', 'Boy', 'Williamson', 'II', 'style', 'St.', 'Louis', 'trumpet', 'sound', 'Clark', 'Terry', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'emphasized', 'economy', 'notes', 'sound', 'colors', 'feeling', 'performance', 'so', 'striking', 'documentarian', 'insert', 'short', 'discussion', 'Mickey', 'Rafaelto', 'Who', 'was', 'guy', 'harp', 'questons.I', 'spent', 'two', 'hours', 'couple', 'years', 'Wynton', 'NY', 'condo', 'sipping', 'glass', 'Armanac', 'discussed', 'Sonny', 'Boy', 'Williamson', 'II', 'story', 'institutionalized', 'racism', 'Mississippi', 'delta', 'called', 'children', 'ex-wife', 'listened', 'couple', 'students', 'who', 'stopped', 'taught', 'few', 'more', 'advice', 'phone', 'timewriting', 'book', 'music', 'trademark', 'trumpet', 'table', 'real', 'deal', 'exactly', 'Wynton', 'see', 'documentary.Enjoy']","Willie Nelson/Wynton Marsalis: Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center, NYC"
