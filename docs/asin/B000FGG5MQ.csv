989759,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B000FGG5MQ,Dai-keag-ity,"[6, 10]","""Howdee, Pardner!"" I always wanted to say that.Texas Ranch House isn't trash TV by a longshot with a Colt .45 (yes, I know, not invented in 1867) but there was a noticeable shift here from the other entries in the field of PBS living history shows (1900 House, etc.) and it took me a moment to put my finger on the fact that this one seemed far more like some commercial network game show than the experiment in makeshift time travel I'd grown more accustomed to expecting. In my unsolicited and inexpert, opinion, Texas Ranch House suffered as a result of its hybrid nature, and is easily the weakest among the PBS reality projects I've seen. (Which is just about all of them.)All that aside, if you invest a quarter of one day of your life in watching Texas Ranch House, here's what you'll see...You'll see the expected gathering of men and women--- mostly men this time---drawn from a variety of walks of life here in the first decade of the twenty-first century (and this decade is called the ""tens"" folks) cast backward into a recreation of the Texas frontier circa 1867. There is the Cooke family, the ranchers of the series, a singularly irritating bunch dominated by a dauntingly control-freakish woman, and you'll see the cowboys who ostensibly work for the Cooke's. There are also the standard visitors, who shake things up and add color to the monochrome of frontier life. And then there was the one and only bright speck on this washed-out, miscast, mostly mishandled project: the neighboring Comanche band. Sure it was fun to see Comanches make an appearance, but I kept thinking how anachronistic it was that the Comanches were so placid in their dealings with Mr. Cooke and the others. (""You have many cows."") Sure, I know, a stack of examples could probably be found of Comanches not scalping, flaying, and ant-hilling (ya don't wanna know) whites, but would it have been too much for the producers to have let, well, SOMETHING happen in this show? Like an Indian attack?Ugh. Actually the more I think about it the bigger disappointment this show seems in retrospect. They could at least have let a snide Brokeback Mountain reference sneak in for humor's sake, right?

Texas Ranch House has that too. Yes, there are criticisms of how people were handled and that's exactly the point. You see things that work and things that don't. How do you motivate people?

Thomason ""Movie Family""","[2, 3]","I'll be honest - I finished watching the Cooke Family Ranch and all the hi-jinks which comprised Texas Ranch House about an hour ago and the disdain I feel towards this 'family' and for the producers of this House series is monumental.  I would love to go over everything which was wrong with this program (from the total lack of accountability during production (thank you PBS for turning the Cooke family loose with no oversight) - the horrific attitudes of this corrupt 'Ranch Owner' and his disgusting wife (repugnant doesn't even cover this woman)- the complete disregard for the time period or anything even approaching history (the only thing historical in this account was the fact that the ground was literally there during the time period)) but good golly its been written about over and over.  This was one of the worst programs I have ever had the misfortune of watching.  The plastic plate in Cousin Eddie's head (narration by Randy Quaid) must have shifted to have considered being part of this program.  This is the only platform to really affect the show and I implore anyone with eyes and ears - DON'T BUY THIS PROGRAM.  My only hope is YOU don't waste your time or money on this program aaaand the two saving graces of this show, foreman Robby Cabezuela and cowboy Jared Ficklin know that my family is so grateful for your demonstration of ethics despite the, in my opinion, criminal behavior and neglect of human decency.

Thank the library, now I can watch them!I watched through this series in a matter of days while sick, my husband seeing a few episodes and asking how things were going.  He asked some questions that I couldn't answer, and I was confused by too.Why did people not try to work together?What was the purpose of the show?  Even the ""players"" didn't seem to know.Why was there no movement toward stocking food and prepping the ranch for after the cattle drive?What's up with the buying horses instead of wages thing?My husband's take - that some people were actors to stir things up because, why else would they act that way?I didn't think along his lines, but I think that people lost focus quickly on what was the purpose.  Granted, we only saw bits of their lives and a lot was edited out.  After poking around at some interviews, one of the issues that bugged me was clarified.  I was bothered that the cowboys didn't help the Cook girls out when they needed it and the narrator saying that real cowboys would help women in need.  When in reality, the cowboys on the show had been told not to help because the girls needed to do it themselves.  So that made me look at this a little differently.I also tried to figure out what the ground rules of the show were, but there was nothing I could find on the PBS site.  Were the people actually getting real wages?  If so, then the buying- the- horse- thing would make sense.  But why negotiate and get so upset if it really won't matter in a few weeks?  Each time I thought over the events of the show, I just got more confused.  Even talking it out loud with my husband, we'd bring up more things that didn't make sense.There didn't seem to be much accountability for the people to get anything done but earn money on the round up.  Not much was explained about the goals for the women, for example.  They had a well built home and an already growing garden but they didn't do much with it according to the videos.  I would have liked to have seen something on how their day's work was, and not so much the infighting.So, my review is kind of meandering around, sort of like my thoughts and confusion on this show.  There's lots more I could mention but all in all, I was very disappointed.  I wanted to see what it was maybe like for people in that era, to learn something about it and see people struggle and adjust to their roles and all that.  Instead, I feel it turned into a soap opera or a Survivor realty show.I'm really glad I watched this 2nd (after Prairie House) so that I wouldn't be put off them all together - and that there are much better ones to watch in the future.",2,Left Confused,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,2766,"[""'m"", 'making', 'way', 'house', 'videos', 'late', 'game', 'PBS', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'very', 'well', 'house', 'when', 'things', 'aired', 'Thank', 'library', 'now', 'can', 'watch', 'watched', 'series', 'matter', 'days', 'sick', 'husband', 'seeing', 'few', 'episodes', 'asking', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'asked', 'questions', 'could', ""n't"", 'answer', 'was', 'confused', 'too.Why', 'did', 'people', 'not', 'try', 'work', 'together', 'What', 'was', 'purpose', 'show', 'Even', 'players', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know.Why', 'was', 'movement', 'stocking', 'food', 'prepping', 'ranch', 'cattle', 'drive', 'What', 'up', 'buying', 'horses', 'instead', 'wages', 'thing', 'husband', 'take', 'people', 'were', 'actors', 'stir', 'things', 'up', 'why', 'else', 'would', 'act', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'lines', 'think', 'people', 'lost', 'focus', 'quickly', 'was', 'purpose', 'Granted', 'only', 'saw', 'bits', 'lives', 'lot', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'poking', 'around', 'interviews', 'one', 'issues', 'bugged', 'was', 'clarified', 'was', 'bothered', 'cowboys', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Cook', 'girls', 'out', 'when', 'needed', 'narrator', 'saying', 'real', 'cowboys', 'would', 'help', 'women', 'need', 'When', 'reality', 'cowboys', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'not', 'help', 'girls', 'needed', 'do', 'made', 'look', 'little', 'differently.I', 'also', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'ground', 'rules', 'show', 'were', 'was', 'nothing', 'could', 'find', 'PBS', 'site', 'Were', 'people', 'actually', 'getting', 'real', 'wages', 'so', 'then', 'buying-', 'the-', 'horse-', 'thing', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'negotiate', 'get', 'so', 'upset', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'few', 'weeks', 'time', 'thought', 'events', 'show', 'just', 'got', 'more', 'confused', 'Even', 'talking', 'out', 'loud', 'husband', ""'d"", 'bring', 'up', 'more', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.There', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'accountability', 'people', 'get', 'anything', 'done', 'earn', 'money', 'round', 'up', 'Not', 'much', 'was', 'explained', 'goals', 'women', 'example', 'had', 'well', 'built', 'home', 'already', 'growing', 'garden', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'according', 'videos', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'how', 'day', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'infighting.So', 'review', 'kind', 'meandering', 'around', 'sort', 'thoughts', 'confusion', 'show', 'lots', 'more', 'could', 'mention', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'maybe', 'people', 'era', 'learn', 'something', 'see', 'people', 'struggle', 'adjust', 'roles', 'Instead', 'feel', 'turned', 'soap', 'opera', 'Survivor', 'realty', 'show.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'watched', '2nd', 'Prairie', 'House', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'together', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'ones', 'watch', 'future']",N/A
989766,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B000FGG5MQ,kacunnin,"[3, 3]","TEXAS RANCH HOUSE is an 8-episode television program in which 21st century people are challenged to live for 2  months on a Texas ranch in 1867.  Bill Cooke, a hospital administrator from California, becomes the ranch owner, along with his wife Lisa (a homemaker and amateur genealogist) and their three teenage daughters.  Nine men, ranging in age from 20-year-old Sean to 57-year-old Stan, become the cowboys, who live in the bunkhouse and do the physical labor of running the ranch.  Maura (26), a Stanford PhD student, becomes the ""girl of all work,"" who will be expected to pitch in wherever needed as the family's only servant.Many reviewers here on Amazon have criticized TEXAS RANCH HOUSE for sensationalizing the ""House"" franchise, and complain that the participants (especially the Cooke family members) never really get into their 19th century characters.  Admittedly, some of the participants (Lisa Cooke is the most obvious example) have trouble putting aside their 21st century sensibilities to truly experience living in the past.  But having watched all of the previous ""House"" programs, I can say that this is a common problem with the series.  It's not easy to spend an extended time living in a way that goes against your personal views (whether about religion in COLONIAL HOUSE or class structure in MANOR HOUSE or lifestyle in FRONTIER HOUSE).  In TEXAS RANCH HOUSE the conflicts are about women's roles.  How much influence should a wife have on her husband's decisions?  How much freedom should women have to express opinions and do a ""man's job""?I found TEXAS RANCH HOUSE fascinating.  Bill Cooke comes into the project as a businessman expecting to have no problem at all managing the ranch and turning a profit.  What he discovers is that it's not as easy as he thinks to keep his cowboys in line while also satisfying his wife's need to be an active part of the leadership.  Lisa Cooke wants to be present at all meetings between her husband and the cowboys - this causes no end of problems for everyone involved.  When she insists that Maura (the ""girl of all work"") be given a chance to join the cowboys and ride on the cattle drive, the problems intensify.  Whether this particular conflict was set up by the producers is unclear - Maura wants to do more than housework, and Lisa supports her in this.The cowboys, too, have trouble making the transition to the 19th century.  Stan comes in as Foreman expecting things to be like his 32 years in the military - he wants to run his men like a military unit, but they are resistant.  Nacho (Ignacio Quiles), a student at the Culinary Institute in NYC, is the cook for the cowboys, but he has a very hard time adjusting to the living and cooking conditions.  The other ranch hands are initially resistant to the hard work, the oppressive heat, and the lack of food and entertainment they face on a daily basis.  None of them have an easy time.Ultimately, the cowboys rise to the occasion and conduct a very successful cattle drive.  Bill Cooke never quite manages to stand up to either his ranch hands or his wife, and he comes across as a weak and ineffectual manager.  Lisa Cooke wants so much to prove that women can be valuable players that she ignores her true 1867 role and comes across in a very negative light.  The same can be said for Maura, whose dream of being a cowboy rather than a maid gets in the way of a true experience for her.But I can't condemn TEXAS RANCH HOUSE.  Part of the fascination of these programs is seeing how difficult it can be for 21st century people to transition back to an earlier era. Lisa Cooke believed she could bring something important to her role as the wife of an 1867 rancher - but in trying to do that, she negatively impacted the entire experience for all of the participants.  That doesn't mean the project was a failure.  It highlighted the differences between 1867 and 2005 very successfully.I do recommend this program as an interesting and revealing study in human behavior.",4,Better than expected -- an interesting study in human behavior,1325030400,"12 28, 2011",2011,4004,"['TEXAS', 'RANCH', 'HOUSE', '8-episode', 'television', 'program', '21st', 'century', 'people', 'are', 'challenged', 'live', '2', 'months', 'Texas', 'ranch', '1867', 'Bill', 'Cooke', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'California', 'ranch', 'owner', 'wife', 'Lisa', 'homemaker', 'amateur', 'genealogist', 'three', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'Nine', 'men', 'ranging', 'age', '20-year-old', 'Sean', '57-year-old', 'Stan', 'become', 'cowboys', 'who', 'live', 'bunkhouse', 'do', 'physical', 'labor', 'running', 'ranch', 'Maura', '26', 'Stanford', 'PhD', 'student', 'girl', 'work', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'expected', 'pitch', 'wherever', 'needed', 'family', 'only', 'servant.Many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Amazon', 'have', 'criticized', 'TEXAS', 'RANCH', 'HOUSE', 'sensationalizing', 'House', 'franchise', 'complain', 'participants', 'especially', 'Cooke', 'family', 'members', 'never', 'really', 'get', '19th', 'century', 'characters', 'Admittedly', 'participants', 'Lisa', 'Cooke', 'most', 'obvious', 'example', 'have', 'trouble', 'putting', 'aside', '21st', 'century', 'sensibilities', 'truly', 'experience', 'living', 'past', 'having', 'watched', 'previous', 'House', 'programs', 'can', 'say', 'common', 'problem', 'series', 'not', 'easy', 'spend', 'extended', 'time', 'living', 'way', 'personal', 'views', 'religion', 'COLONIAL', 'HOUSE', 'class', 'structure', 'MANOR', 'HOUSE', 'lifestyle', 'FRONTIER', 'HOUSE', 'TEXAS', 'RANCH', 'HOUSE', 'conflicts', 'are', 'women', 'roles', 'How', 'much', 'influence', 'should', 'wife', 'have', 'husband', 'decisions', 'How', 'much', 'freedom', 'should', 'women', 'have', 'express', 'opinions', 'do', 'man', 'job', 'found', 'TEXAS', 'RANCH', 'HOUSE', 'fascinating', 'Bill', 'Cooke', 'project', 'businessman', 'expecting', 'have', 'problem', 'managing', 'ranch', 'turning', 'profit', 'What', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'keep', 'cowboys', 'line', 'also', 'satisfying', 'wife', 'need', 'be', 'active', 'part', 'leadership', 'Lisa', 'Cooke', 'be', 'present', 'meetings', 'husband', 'cowboys', 'end', 'problems', 'everyone', 'involved', 'When', 'Maura', 'girl', 'work', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'join', 'cowboys', 'ride', 'cattle', 'drive', 'problems', 'intensify', 'particular', 'conflict', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'producers', 'unclear', 'Maura', 'do', 'more', 'housework', 'Lisa', 'this.The', 'cowboys', 'too', 'have', 'trouble', 'making', 'transition', '19th', 'century', 'Stan', 'Foreman', 'expecting', 'things', 'be', '32', 'years', 'military', 'run', 'men', 'military', 'unit', 'are', 'resistant', 'Nacho', 'Ignacio', 'Quiles', 'student', 'Culinary', 'Institute', 'NYC', 'cook', 'cowboys', 'very', 'hard', 'time', 'adjusting', 'living', 'cooking', 'conditions', 'other', 'ranch', 'hands', 'are', 'initially', 'resistant', 'hard', 'work', 'oppressive', 'heat', 'lack', 'food', 'entertainment', 'face', 'daily', 'basis', 'None', 'have', 'easy', 'time.Ultimately', 'cowboys', 'rise', 'occasion', 'conduct', 'very', 'successful', 'cattle', 'drive', 'Bill', 'Cooke', 'never', 'quite', 'stand', 'up', 'either', 'ranch', 'hands', 'wife', 'across', 'weak', 'ineffectual', 'manager', 'Lisa', 'Cooke', 'so', 'much', 'prove', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'valuable', 'players', 'true', '1867', 'role', 'across', 'very', 'negative', 'light', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Maura', 'dream', 'being', 'cowboy', 'rather', 'maid', 'way', 'true', 'experience', 'her.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'condemn', 'TEXAS', 'RANCH', 'HOUSE', 'Part', 'fascination', 'programs', 'seeing', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', '21st', 'century', 'people', 'transition', 'back', 'earlier', 'era', 'Lisa', 'Cooke', 'believed', 'could', 'bring', 'something', 'important', 'role', 'wife', '1867', 'rancher', 'trying', 'do', 'negatively', 'impacted', 'entire', 'experience', 'participants', ""n't"", 'mean', 'project', 'was', 'failure', 'highlighted', 'differences', '1867', '2005', 'very', 'successfully.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'program', 'interesting', 'revealing', 'study', 'human', 'behavior']",N/A

989768,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B000FGG5MQ,Michael Valdivielso,"[5, 5]","Boy, this was almost painful to watch.  But before I start my review let me point out that we see only 8 hours of 2.5 months of Ranch life and that means that we don't get the whole picture.  For example, when the family sits down to have their first meal on the ranch it is said they asked the cowboys to leave.  But a source on the internet says that the cowboys were invited to eat with the family and declined.  So take everything with a pinch of salt.  After saying that let me start:The Good.  The best of the Texas Ranch House is the cowboys.  Out of them I could not help but like Jared Ficklin, also known as Slim, and Robby Cabezuela, who went from top hand to foreman.  Jared, because of his family's history in the west, was truly focused on being the best cowboy he could - serious, but with a touch of humor, willing to work hard and yet with a strong sense of honor that would have made any Westerner proud.Robby, while sometimes seeming a tad protective of his position as foremen, gained the respect of the men under him because of his knowledge of ranching and because of his protective feelings towards them.  He thought of them as his men and even continued to sleep in the crew house after being made foreman.I also found Rob Wright, a late comer to the ranch, interesting as I wanted to see how he would react to the problems and the divide between the family and the ranch hands.The cowboys, by the way, were said to be ill mannered forwards the daughters of the family.  This comes up again and again.  But they only have one clip, about 2 minutes long, to show whenever this comes up.  I am sorry, but if after 2.5 months you can only find one scene which shows two cowboys acting like jerks towards the daughters then you need to drop that charge.The Bad.  Stan Johnston, the first foreman, a retired military, seemed to do a OK job but kept missing chances to bring everybody together.  He was fired, but I will not say why, and in the end wasn't on the show very long.  I think, frankly, his ideas about how to run  a ranch were one of the problems.  He saw it as a military unit with a chain of command and it only worked up to a certain point.The Cooke Family were just not ready for living on a ranch house.  Bill Cooke being a businessman thought of it as a business.  Yes, it is, but instead of the cows being the most valuable items on the ranch it was the cowboys.  THAT major point was missed by him who thought of them as his employees.  Also, he had no idea how to run a ranch, he messed up his book keeping, failed to get his sums correct, so on, so forth.  IT is sad when I find myself seeming to know more about running a ranch.The daughters did OK at first.  They worked hard, tried to make friends with the cowboys and handled being ruled by their mother with few complaints.  By the end of the show they were living in a dirty ranch house, with clouds of flies, wearing nothing but undergarments.  Was it too hot?  Was there nothing clean to wear?  Or did they just give up when the cattle drive started?  And why is it, whenever things start to get rough or the women don't like something, they start using the word sexism?  Sexism, racism, socialism always seem to start popping up in the House series whenever somebody feels they are doing too much work or are being treated badly by 21st Century standards.The Ugly.  Two people are on this list.  First, Ignacio Quiles, who was the cook nicknamed Nacho.  He was a chef from New York City who failed, in the end, to be a good cook.  Sometimes he made a great meal but most of the time he made them beans and flatbread and real cowboy food.  So real they got sick on it.  Now, in his defense running a restaurant, with helpers and dishwashers and modern equipment, is not the same as being a cook for a bunch of ranch hands.  Been even so, as most of the other reviews will point out, he was disgusting.Lisa Cooke, the wife of Bill Cooke and mistress of the ranch.  I don't care how the show got edited, there are some scenes with her that make me hate her.  When her husband broke a promise with Jared in the last episode she praised him!  She called the cowboys employees, she was paranoid about Robby, and while complaining about Nacho and his cooking she rarely shared the food that the family grew in the garden.And at last there is Maura Finkestein, who was the Girl of All Work, the maid, and who also got to go on the cattle drive.  Half the time she seemed happy or totally upset.  I don't think she knew what she was doing or why she was there.  I am not saying she was a bad maid or a bad ranch hand.  She did both jobs well.  I just don't think she really understood why she joined up.  At one point she even compared herself to Calamity Jane.  Not the only woman in the House series to do so - but I don't think people understand the history and background of Calamity Jane, otherwise they wouldn't compare themselves to her.There is more I could say - a ton of things really.  If you are interested in cattle drives and ranch life I suggest going someplace else.  If you are interested in how people can come to hate each other because of egos, paranoia, bad food, harsh living conditions and, in some cases, no ethical backbone this is the DVD set for you!",3,If

Because other than the ranch house itself, which you see very little of beyond the front porch, there is nothing historical about this series.You will not see a glimpse of life in the 1800's.  You will see an ungrateful, lazy, whining, group of people who not only ruined a wonderful opportunity to experience a life lost to us a long time ago, but they also spoiled it for the rest of us who looked forward to watching them live it.This was suppose to be a PBS educational show not something I would expect to see on FOX, like watching Paris Hilton working on a farm--insipidly entertaining, but certainly not educational. However, unlike the Paris Hilton, the Cooke family weren't entertaining, just annoying.  They whined and complained about everything!If the Cooke's didn't want to give up the comforts of modern living or live according to the societal/cultural standards of the 1800's, they shouldn't have signed up for the show.  In fact, they would have done all of us a favor if they had just stayed home.  That way PBS could have possibly gotten a different family who would have embraced the 1800's ranch lifestyle instead of the Cooke who constantly reminded the viewing audience how life back then sucked.  How the Cooke family got selected for the show is beyond me.Standards of PBS must be slipping if they put their stamp of approval on mess like this.

989770,A37S3ACL57LN62,B000FGG5MQ,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[4, 4]","The PBS House series is notorious for quality programming, a historical spin on modern reality shows. This is not a good example of the series.The idea is not a bad one. A family is transported back to the mid-1800s to experience life on a Texas Ranch House after the Civil War. Strangers are put in place as cowboys, the foreman, the maid, and the cook. The goal is to capture enough cattle to pay the debtors at the end of the season and still be productive enough to carry on for another.Unfortunately, the cast is awful; they cannot seem to get along long enough to experience what life would have been like during this time period, and when they do get along, they refuse to adhere to the rules. Mr. Cooke changes his mind at the drop of a hat because Mrs. Cooke wants to have her foot into every conversation and decision. She feels the need to wave the flag for women's rights when she is supposed to be living in a time when women did not even have the right to vote. Her insistence that Maura, the maid, be given a chance to become a cowboy is preposterous and a thinly veiled attempt at exerting her power over the ranch. PBS misfired when they gave Nacho, an ex-homeless man, the duties of cook. He allows the food to rot and several of the cowboys get sick. Many of the cast members are dismissed from the show, and the constant fighting makes it hard to like anyone for very long.The biggest redeeming factor of this show is the grand finale where a fight erupts and threatens to take the entire show with it. The big evaluation is a riot to watch and almost makes this season worth watching, but only if you don't have to pay an arm and a leg to see it.In spite of the quality of this installment of PBS House, I hope another one is made.

989771,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B000FGG5MQ,Serene Night,"[29, 30]","I really loved Manor house and the other TV shows in this series. But this one was pretty awful. While it starts promisingly enough, it soon becomes evident to me that the Cooke family were a bad fit. The Cooke 'girls' (and to me they are adults not 'girls') just weren't into it. They didn't want to be there, weren't interested in the period or re-creating it...Why go? I really did not want to see them cavorting around in their undergarments towards the end. I was embarrassed for them. Ms. Cooke wanted to clearly run the ranch and did not apparently trust her husband enough to allow him to make decisions without her weighing in all the time. Mr. Cooke lacked a spine and let the hands, his wife, and the servants tell him what to do in a way I think no 19th century man would. (I must've missed the historical accuracy in allowing a maid to 1. dress like a man. 2. go on a cattle drive with a bunch of unmarried men. 3. still be accepted in polite society by the neighbors and said employer. Please.The hands acted up a lot of time and lacked strong leadership. Nacho was just disgusting. I empathized the most with Jared (the cowboy who lost his horse and was kidnapped by Indians), as I felt Mr. Cooke was a jerk to him. It seemed unfair for Cooke to claim ownership of the horse when it was Jared's. Jared did not agree to sell it afterall. Mr. Cooke threatening to beat up Jared was just stooping to his level. Cooke should struck a deal or docked his pay, but not claimed ownership.On the flipside I disliked the disrespect shown to the Cooke girls by the men. They acted like unruly teenagers rather than adults. Robbie as chief hand did not do anything to bridge the gap between the Cooke's and his men, but instead seemed to revel in the chaos. Bad leadership on both sides. The girls, however were not much better. I didn't see them do anything except complain and neglect their chores. Moria was an anachronism I could've done without. I don't watch the show to see a heroine for modern feminists (and the idea that she acted anachronistic to be a hero for *ME* is ridiculous, she did it for herself, plain and simple!) I watch the film to see what life was like in the 19th century.My favorite participants were Shaun and Jared. Shaun because he volunteered to cook, and did a good job, and Jared, because I think he was funny and did well as a cowboy. My least favorite participants were Mr. & Ms. Cooke and Nacho.I think the show would be better off if there were more social guidelines observed. Such as the manners men should display towards women, attending church, and women dressing properly. Likewise women should act more period and not try to be Xena warrior princess. Overall, this film embarrassed me. It was like being over at a friend's place when a squabble breaks out between your friend and her spouse. You'd rather be anywhere but there witnessing the tacky bickering and backbiting. 2 stars.",2,Actually sort of embarrassing,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,2929,"['really', 'loved', 'Manor', 'house', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'series', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'awful', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'soon', 'evident', 'Cooke', 'family', 'were', 'bad', 'fit', 'Cooke', ""'girls"", 'are', 'adults', 'not', ""'girls"", 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'were', ""n't"", 'interested', 'period', 're-creating', 'Why', 'go', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'cavorting', 'around', 'undergarments', 'end', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'Ms.', 'Cooke', 'wanted', 'clearly', 'run', 'ranch', 'did', 'not', 'apparently', 'husband', 'enough', 'allow', 'make', 'decisions', 'weighing', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Cooke', 'lacked', 'spine', 'let', 'hands', 'wife', 'servants', 'tell', 'what', 'do', 'way', 'think', '19th', 'century', 'man', 'would', 'must', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'allowing', 'maid', '1.', 'dress', 'man', '2.', 'go', 'cattle', 'drive', 'bunch', 'unmarried', 'men', '3.', 'still', 'be', 'accepted', 'polite', 'society', 'neighbors', 'said', 'employer', 'Please.The', 'hands', 'acted', 'up', 'lot', 'time', 'lacked', 'strong', 'leadership', 'Nacho', 'was', 'just', 'disgusting', 'empathized', 'most', 'Jared', 'cowboy', 'who', 'lost', 'horse', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'Indians', 'felt', 'Mr.', 'Cooke', 'was', 'jerk', 'seemed', 'unfair', 'Cooke', 'claim', 'ownership', 'horse', 'when', 'was', 'Jared', 'Jared', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'sell', 'afterall', 'Mr.', 'Cooke', 'threatening', 'beat', 'up', 'Jared', 'was', 'just', 'stooping', 'level', 'Cooke', 'should', 'struck', 'deal', 'docked', 'pay', 'not', 'claimed', 'flipside', 'disliked', 'disrespect', 'shown', 'Cooke', 'girls', 'men', 'acted', 'unruly', 'teenagers', 'rather', 'adults', 'Robbie', 'chief', 'hand', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'bridge', 'gap', 'Cooke', 'men', 'instead', 'seemed', 'revel', 'chaos', 'Bad', 'leadership', 'sides', 'girls', 'however', 'were', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'do', 'anything', 'complain', 'neglect', 'chores', 'Moria', 'was', 'anachronism', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'see', 'heroine', 'modern', 'feminists', 'idea', 'acted', 'anachronistic', 'be', 'hero', '*ME*', 'ridiculous', 'did', 'plain', 'simple', 'watch', 'film', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'was', '19th', 'century.My', 'favorite', 'participants', 'were', 'Shaun', 'Jared', 'Shaun', 'volunteered', 'cook', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Jared', 'think', 'was', 'funny', 'did', 'well', 'cowboy', 'least', 'favorite', 'participants', 'were', 'Mr.', 'Ms.', 'Cooke', 'Nacho.I', 'think', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'were', 'more', 'social', 'guidelines', 'observed', 'Such', 'manners', 'men', 'should', 'display', 'towards', 'women', 'attending', 'church', 'women', 'dressing', 'properly', 'Likewise', 'women', 'should', 'act', 'more', 'period', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'Xena', 'warrior', 'princess', 'Overall', 'film', 'embarrassed', 'was', 'being', 'over', 'friend', 'place', 'when', 'squabble', 'breaks', 'out', 'friend', 'spouse', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'anywhere', 'there', 'witnessing', 'tacky', 'bickering', 'backbiting', '2', 'stars']",N/A

The worst was Mrs. Cooke, who constantly bitched and moaned about how little women are respected.
