569969,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000056N93,calvinnme,"[5, 5]","The Railrodder is an interesting and funny silent short Keaton made in 1964 in which he travels - rather accidentally - via a tiny motorized rail car from the East coast to the West coast of Canada as part of a Canadian travelogue. Meant to be just one of the various industrial films Keaton starred in late in his career, it turned out to be much more than that. This is because filmmaker John Spotton decided to ""film the filming of"" the Railrodder and thus make a documentary - ""Buster Keaton Rides Again"". As a result, we get rare - maybe the only - footage of Keaton at work as he comes up with gags, fights for his ideas when the director thinks a particular stunt is too dangerous, and as he basically co-directs by placing a group of workmen where he thinks they should be in a particular shot. We also get to see Keaton at rest and at play - his passion for bridge and baseball, his shyness around large crowds when he is honored by a town he is passing through, and the adorable relationship he had with his third wife Eleanor as she insists that he lie down and rest after a busy day and his response is ""I should sell her"".The short and documentary were shot in the autumn of 1964, just some 16 or so months before Keaton's death in February 1966 from lung cancer. A few of Keaton's coughing fits captured on the documentary are thus somewhat sadly  prophetic of what is soon to come. Thus this travelogue/documentary combo is essential viewing for any Keaton fan because we get to see him as he was at the end of his life - a happy man who still insisted on putting out the best work he could after 65 years in show business.",5,Essential candid footage of Keaton at work and at play,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,1638,"['Railrodder', 'interesting', 'funny', 'silent', 'short', 'Keaton', 'made', '1964', 'rather', 'accidentally', 'tiny', 'motorized', 'rail', 'car', 'East', 'coast', 'West', 'coast', 'Canada', 'part', 'Canadian', 'travelogue', 'Meant', 'be', 'just', 'one', 'various', 'industrial', 'films', 'Keaton', 'starred', 'late', 'career', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'filmmaker', 'John', 'Spotton', 'decided', 'film', 'filming', 'Railrodder', 'thus', 'make', 'documentary', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Rides', 'Again', 'result', 'get', 'rare', 'maybe', 'only', 'footage', 'Keaton', 'work', 'up', 'gags', 'fights', 'ideas', 'when', 'director', 'particular', 'stunt', 'too', 'dangerous', 'basically', 'co-directs', 'placing', 'group', 'workmen', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'particular', 'shot', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Keaton', 'rest', 'play', 'passion', 'bridge', 'baseball', 'shyness', 'large', 'crowds', 'when', 'honored', 'town', 'passing', 'adorable', 'relationship', 'had', 'third', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'lie', 'down', 'rest', 'busy', 'day', 'response', 'should', 'sell', '.The', 'short', 'documentary', 'were', 'shot', 'autumn', '1964', 'just', '16', 'so', 'months', 'Keaton', 'death', 'February', '1966', 'lung', 'cancer', 'few', 'Keaton', 'coughing', 'fits', 'captured', 'documentary', 'are', 'thus', 'somewhat', 'sadly', 'prophetic', 'what', 'soon', 'come', 'Thus', 'travelogue/documentary', 'combo', 'essential', 'viewing', 'Keaton', 'fan', 'get', 'see', 'was', 'end', 'life', 'happy', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'insisted', 'putting', 'out', 'best', 'work', 'could', '65', 'years', 'show', 'business']",N/A
569970,A16FQMU1M3TWX8,B000056N93,J.D. Guinness,"[1, 1]","A sad-faced little man vacationing in Great Britain reads a newspaper containing the three-word exhortation ""See Canada Now!"" and with a grim, determined look at the camera flings himself off a bridge into the ocean, where he just happens to float to Canada's east coast where he sees a motorized railroad car conveniently located on a railroad track.  With this absurd conceit begins one of comedy legend Buster Keaton's last films and what I consider the single greatest short film of all time.For all the praise that has been (rightfully) heaped here on the elderly Keaton for his whimsical performance and typically original and beautifully timed sight gags, an equal heap of praise must be allotted director Gerald Potterton for his gorgeous colour photography (digitally remastered for DVD, so now looking sharper, brighter and better than ever) as well as an unforgettable soundtrack; a sort of jazz/ragtime/bluegrass fusion that fits Buster's comedy so perfectly you cannot imagine one without the other.Canadian viewers will of course get a nice prideful sort of kick out of identifying the various landmarks Keaton admires from East to West between his bits of tomfoolery, while Keaton fans will marvel yet again at the creative vigour this peerless comic actor had to offer, right up to the very end.An added bonus is a ""making of"" documentary, Buster Keaton Rides Again, a most succinct, satisfyingly up-close-and-personal profile of Keaton's life and work.

Personally, I recommend watching the documentary first and then the short film.  You get to see that to Keaton the whole world was a stage. He would do great comedy for just one or two people between shots.  Stopping and starting the train is one of my favorite segments. It is truly amazing to me that Keaton and Chaplin were both making cinematic history without any overlap is comedic perspective.  One doesn't top the other but are totally different. I would also like to recommend the documentaries ""A Hard Act to Follow"" (about Keaton) and ""The Unknown Chaplin"".  No filmmaker or person who loves film should miss these two.  Sadly, ""A Hard Act..."" is only on VHS.  It is available on DVD using the PAL format but that WILL NOT play on U.S. DVD players.
