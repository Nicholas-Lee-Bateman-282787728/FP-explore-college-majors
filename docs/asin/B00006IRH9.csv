Yes, the programming exec that decided the fate of ""Sports Night"" should be taken out back and shot.  But what makes this ""good show"" so great is how all the great pieces come together to make such a moving piece of television history.  The show was not without flaws, but it worked through them.  The changes between the pilot and the next episode were incredible!  The whole ""dramady"" thing obviously created a lot of anxiety about how to use a laugh track or whether to use one at all.  After overuse in the pilot, the laugh track was slowly disolved more and more into the background.  Thankfully.  I know I didn't need to hear any fake laughter to rattle my funnybone!  And the almost maniacal Jeremy and Natalie (and a few others) were toned down appropriately from the pilot for the rest of the series.  I love movies and TV shows with great characters, and this show made me care about its characters remarkably quickly.  I heard that Aaron Sorkin had a deal to recreate the show on Showtime but ABC stepped in to prevent it.  So, the network not only knocked out the show, it pulled the plug on its life support.  Outrageous!  Yes, this is the same network that gave life to Bonnie and Jim and Hope and Faith.  Funny, I'm losing mine.",5,"The Best ...

716807,A33L7G4E8CID3,B00006IRH9,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[23, 28]","I actually did it--I watched every episode of The West Wing in sequence, several episodes per day, after which I watched every episode of Sports Night (which took much less time). To those of you who are familiar with both, you probably have an opinion on which is better. So did I, but I flip-flopped after re-watching all of these. I'll let you know what it was.Originally, I preferred West Wing, although I have, as I indicated, turned around. I enjoyed Sports Night after discovering it two years ago, however I had a number of problems with it. I felt that it veered too often toward soap opera, that it was somewhat repetitious, and that the plotting was a little loose. Although I enjoyed all the performances (especially Peter Krause as Casey and Josh Charles as Dan), I felt that the female characters never quite felt right--I chalked it up to Sorkin having trouble writing for women, just like the characters of Mandy and the First Lady in the West Wing, a little over-dramatic and aren't-I-cute-ness that frankly irritated me. The West Wing, on the other hand, was fueled with political passion, with well-constructed story arcs; it was more mature and polished. This was my unequivocal view upon original viewings of both. However, having watched them both, I realize that I was wrong.I don't know what it is, but Sports Night just holds up better than West Wing, in spite of the greater amount of pop-culture trivia Sports Night uses. Sorkin ended Sports Night because he felt that West Wing had more potential, and he might have been right (who knows what a third season of Sports Night might have included?). However, some of my complaints about Sports Night have gone by the wayside. Take the soap opera comment--West Wing is as guilty an infractor as Sports Night on this, especially in the final two seasons of WW. It just didn't bother me as much. I found that it wasn't so much repetition as iteration in regard to the humor and plotting, the latter of which was my biggest turnaround. There's something to be said for character-driven stories which de-emphasize plotting and increase interaction among the performers. In general, Sports Night is more romantic than its successor: not in terms of love (although that too), but  in the sense of breaking the rules--and it does that in many ways. It's a dramedy, mostly without a laugh track, which manages to center itself on characters instead of plot--there is actually plotting, but we are almost convinced that there isn't one, that it's all spontaneous. It's a slight-of-hand that The West Wing never managed to pull off. The woman comment, also, was wrong. The offending scene I found was the scene where Dana, the executive producer, confronts her archnemesis Sally about her amorous relations. Upon first seeing it, I thought it way over the top and melodramatic, but now, I think that it would be how someone in that situation would react. Finally, with The West Wing, the writing and performances were polished and excellent, but in such a way that it was impossible not to notice that both were excellent. It was a show built, intentionally or not, to win awards. With Sports Night, it's not the same. The acting is so good that there is no need to show off. Josh Charles never cries or yells or displays the sort of intense emotion that wins Emmys, but his performance in the role of Dan Rydell is about as complex and pathos-ridden as any I've seen. All in all, the things that make The West Wing better the first time it's seen are the same things that make it somewhat less interesting the fourth or fifth time. With Sports Night, though, one is free to notice new things: a glance, a frown, a reference, etc. that add to one's appreciation of the show. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of moments that are positively spine-tingling in West Wing that still retain a great deal of power after repeat viewings. Bartlet's limo ride to the MS press conference, for one. Yet there is something more that Sports Night has to offer, even if it's difficult to define.I could talk to you about the performers, or the dialogue, or the camerawork and direction, but, honestly, both shows share the same general parameters. I hope that this convinces some of you to at least give this show a chance. It is well worth it.",5,The Ultimate Contest,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,4297,"['actually', 'did', 'watched', 'episode', 'West', 'Wing', 'sequence', 'several', 'episodes', 'day', 'watched', 'episode', 'Sports', 'Night', 'took', 'much', 'less', 'time', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'probably', 'have', 'opinion', 'better', 'So', 'did', 'flip-flopped', 're-watching', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'what', 'was.Originally', 'preferred', 'West', 'Wing', 'have', 'indicated', 'turned', 'enjoyed', 'Sports', 'Night', 'discovering', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'however', 'had', 'number', 'problems', 'felt', 'veered', 'too', 'often', 'soap', 'opera', 'was', 'somewhat', 'repetitious', 'plotting', 'was', 'little', 'loose', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'especially', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Casey', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'Dan', 'felt', 'female', 'characters', 'never', 'quite', 'felt', 'right', 'chalked', 'up', 'Sorkin', 'having', 'trouble', 'writing', 'women', 'just', 'characters', 'Mandy', 'First', 'Lady', 'West', 'Wing', 'little', 'over-dramatic', ""aren't-I-cute-ness"", 'frankly', 'irritated', 'West', 'Wing', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'fueled', 'political', 'passion', 'well-constructed', 'story', 'arcs', 'was', 'more', 'mature', 'polished', 'was', 'unequivocal', 'view', 'original', 'viewings', 'However', 'having', 'watched', 'realize', 'was', 'wrong.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Sports', 'Night', 'just', 'up', 'better', 'West', 'Wing', 'spite', 'greater', 'amount', 'pop-culture', 'trivia', 'Sports', 'Night', 'Sorkin', 'ended', 'Sports', 'Night', 'felt', 'West', 'Wing', 'had', 'more', 'potential', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'who', 'what', 'third', 'season', 'Sports', 'Night', 'might', 'have', 'included', 'However', 'complaints', 'Sports', 'Night', 'have', 'gone', 'wayside', 'Take', 'soap', 'opera', 'comment', 'West', 'Wing', 'guilty', 'infractor', 'Sports', 'Night', 'especially', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'WW', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'repetition', 'iteration', 'regard', 'humor', 'plotting', 'latter', 'was', 'biggest', 'turnaround', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'character-driven', 'stories', 'de-emphasize', 'plotting', 'increase', 'interaction', 'performers', 'general', 'Sports', 'Night', 'more', 'romantic', 'successor', 'not', 'terms', 'love', 'too', 'sense', 'breaking', 'rules', 'many', 'ways', 'dramedy', 'mostly', 'laugh', 'track', 'center', 'characters', 'instead', 'plot', 'actually', 'plotting', 'are', 'almost', 'convinced', ""n't"", 'one', 'spontaneous', 'slight-of-hand', 'West', 'Wing', 'never', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'woman', 'comment', 'also', 'was', 'wrong', 'offending', 'scene', 'found', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Dana', 'executive', 'producer', 'archnemesis', 'Sally', 'amorous', 'relations', 'first', 'seeing', 'thought', 'way', 'top', 'melodramatic', 'now', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'someone', 'situation', 'would', 'react', 'Finally', 'West', 'Wing', 'writing', 'performances', 'were', 'polished', 'excellent', 'such', 'way', 'was', 'impossible', 'not', 'notice', 'were', 'excellent', 'was', 'show', 'built', 'intentionally', 'not', 'win', 'awards', 'Sports', 'Night', 'not', 'same', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'need', 'show', 'off', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'never', 'yells', 'sort', 'intense', 'emotion', 'Emmys', 'performance', 'role', 'Dan', 'Rydell', 'complex', 'pathos-ridden', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'things', 'make', 'West', 'Wing', 'better', 'first', 'time', 'seen', 'are', 'same', 'things', 'make', 'somewhat', 'less', 'interesting', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'time', 'Sports', 'Night', 'though', 'one', 'free', 'notice', 'new', 'things', 'glance', 'frown', 'reference', 'etc', 'add', 'one', 'appreciation', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'plenty', 'moments', 'are', 'positively', 'spine-tingling', 'West', 'Wing', 'still', 'retain', 'great', 'deal', 'power', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Bartlet', 'limo', 'ride', 'MS', 'press', 'conference', 'one', 'something', 'more', 'Sports', 'Night', 'offer', 'even', 'difficult', 'define.I', 'could', 'talk', 'performers', 'dialogue', 'camerawork', 'direction', 'honestly', 'shows', 'share', 'same', 'general', 'parameters', 'hope', 'least', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'well', 'worth']",Sports Night - The Complete Series

Sports Night is about the on-screen/off-screen storylines at an ESPN SportsCenter-like show.  The show is very similar to The Larry Sanders Show in how it provides insightful details on how a television show is created from the on-screen talent to all the people who make the show go.  Sports Night also features Sorkin's trademark liberal leanings, which can sometimes be thought-provoking and other times, just some guy standing on his soap box.The cast is pretty good, including a pre-Six Feet Under Peter Krause.  Best in the cast, however, is Josh Charles, who starts as a casual, funny anchor and then evolves into a deep, heartbreaking character.  The show is pretty funny with great dialogue. However, Sorkin has a very unique style (lots of smart, maybe too smart, people who can't quite get their lives together, overlapping dialogue) that may put some viewers off.

716810,A2AGT644C2CAZL,B00006IRH9,Asaidi,"[2, 3]","The upside is that one of my favorite TV series ever is now available for DVD.  Even if you aren't a fan of Aaron Sorkin or &quot;West Wing&quot;, this is one of the series that initiated the kind of comedy that you see a lot of TV sitcoms doing now.  Even the serious episodes have the quick wit and funny banter that the series is famous for.The downside is that this DVD set has ONLY the shows.  No extra footage at all.  They had no room after cramming up to 8 episodes per disc.  I would love it if the disc had outtakes, or interviews with the cast, or some commentary from the cast or the crew, like a lot of the other TV series DVDs have, but there's nothing like that on this one.Plus they made these DVDs kind of funny.  If you select one episode to watch it will show you that episode, and then continue to show you the rest of the episodes.  Apparently the DVD makers thought that most people would want to see all of the episodes on the DVD because they have a &quot;play all&quot; option on every one of them.  As much as I love the show, I don't usually have time to sit there and watch 8 episodes in a row.I still gave it 4 stars though.  I only took away one for the downside.

When ""Sports Night"" first aired, I assumed it was a show about sports and didn't watch it.I knew of Josh Charles from ""Threesome,"" which didn't endear me to him, and I'd not really heard of Peter Krause. I thought Felicity Huffman probably wasn't as talented as William H. Macy, her husband. And I thought that Robert Guillaume was a has-been, rather than a still-viable talent.

I thought that the show was an ESPN-fused ""Murphy Brown"" wannabe, and I didn't watch it.I was wrong. I was really, really wrong. I was so massively wrong about ""Sports Night"" that, should they invent and introduce a time machine, I would go back to Fall 1998, sit my then-self down in front of a TV and force me to indulge in this quick-paced, witty masterpiece of a show.

716813,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B00006IRH9,Brian Markowski,"[1, 1]","Before ""The West Wing"", before ""Studio 60"", there was ""Sports Night"". Aaron Sorkin's first foray into weekly television. ""Sports Night"" was a tip of the hat to ESPN's Sports Center. The premises followed the cast and crew of Continental Sports Channel (CSC) as they worked through office romances, gossip, and egos to put together a nightly sports show entitled, appropriately enough, Sports Night. Originally meant to be a feature film, ""Spots Night"" ended up working better as a serial and lasted for two years on ABC from 1998 to 2000. The cast included such well-known names as Felicity Huffman (Desperate Housewives), Peter Krause (Six Feet Under), and  Robert Guillaume (Soap/Benson)The show never took off as well as Sorkin's ""West Wing"" would a year later. Though the intelligent fast paced banter between characters walking through and around their work environment was nearly identical to that of ""Wing"".  Even the topics of this half hour comedy, again like ""West Wing"", served as a sounding board for Sorkin as he spoke out against the celebrity system, the press, and racism. He would even write in Robert Guillaume's 1999 stroke into the series, which would prove to be a touching and very  sincere look at that debilitating condition.  The show would hit it's stride however when it addressed office politics. As a third placed sports show, the production team of Sports Night was always fighting against upper management, an out of touch owner, and a cranky ratings expert, played by William H. Macy. The charm of the show was derived from the relationship between Sport Night's two anchors, Dan (Josh Charles) and Casey (Peter Krause). Though both characters were straight as an arrow, their relation was the best love story on TV. Through fights, egos, and a heavy work schedule I came to understand and love their relationship of trust and commitment.""Sports Night"" took it's time with it's audience, which was probably why it fell off the ABC schedule in 2000.

716814,A2N9OENVXDF643,B00006IRH9,Brian M. Benway,"[10, 11]","Sports Night was a show that, despite its quality, never seemed to find its audience.  Though it aired on a major network with decent publicity, the public largely ignored this superb show, writing it off as a show about sports.  I am embarrassed to say that I was part of that ignoring public.Visiting the show later in reruns on Comedy Central, I came to understand why this show was almost universally praised by critics: Sports Night is, through and through, one of the most tightly crafted shows to ever hit the airwaves.Sports Night focuses on a fictional sports show with the same name, broadcast nightly on a third-place cable sports station, and hosted by two intelligent, witty men who put up good appearances on the air, but who are each struggling with their own demons behind the scenes.  Added to the mix are a domineering executive producer (brilliantly portrayed by Felcity Huffman), as well as a cast of neurotic characters, all anchored by the sanity of Isaac, played by Robert Guillaume.What makes Sports Night so incredibly watchable is the accessability of the show to any type of viewer, sports fan or not.  In fact, the sports references are kept to a minimum, as the show--like The Larry Sanders Show--focuses more on what happens behind the scenes.The dialogue is extraordinarily snappy, and moves along at a rhythmic clip that is almost melodic in nature.  It's a banter whose music rivals that of the best David Mamet scripts.Perhaps the only mistep Sports Night made was the inclusion of a laugh track early on in the show.  Not only was this extremely obvious as canned laughter, it also seemed out of place, as this is not a comedy with dramatic elements, but rather a drama with a hint of comedy every now and then.Sports night is a true gem.",5,A masterpiece in 45 acts.

Crockett ""Domino713""","[3, 3]","Aaron Sorkin, best known for his intelligent and witty hit shows such as ""The West Wing"", and (most recently) ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"", started out with this small and beautiful diamond in the rough. ""Sports Night"" was Sorkin's first big project, and it shows in the sharp, fast-paced, satirical wit present in every line of dialogue.The show follows a team of newscasters, producers, and writers who work on a late night sports news show called ""Sports Night"", a mock up of ESPN's SportsCenter. The interpersonal relationships this small group of people have are always fascinating and fun to watch, and one of the best things about this show is that even if you have no real knowledge about sports, you can *still* watch this show and not get lost at all! As a woman with very little knowledge of most sports, I *still* fell in love with this show, and I imagine it's even more awesome for a man who actually *knows* what they're talking about when it comes to all the sports lingo and statistics they ocassionally throw out there.This show even has a little star power, and some very recognizable faces among the cast. The most obvious of which is Felicity Huffman, who is now starring on the hit show ""Desperate Housewives"" as the strong-willed soccer mom, Lynette Scavo. Felicity's husband, William H. Macy, also guest stars in a few episodes of ""Sports Night"".This half-hour dramedy only lasted 2 seasons before it's cancellation (which was a very sad day in television), but it lives on through this incredible DVD box set. Since each episode is actually a little less than a half-hour (since there are obviously no commercials on dvd), it's really easy to start watching them and get so drawn in that you don't realize you've gone through half a season in no time at all!Bottom line, I highly recommend this show, and I still cling to the tiny hope that network execs might someday realize their mistake in cancelling it, and bring it back on the air....but alas, that will probably never happen.",5,An Incredible Show that should never have been cancelled!,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,2011,"['Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'best', 'known', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'hit', 'shows', 'such', 'West', 'Wing', 'most', 'recently', '60', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'started', 'out', 'small', 'beautiful', 'diamond', 'rough', 'Sports', 'Night', 'was', 'Sorkin', 'first', 'big', 'project', 'sharp', 'fast-paced', 'satirical', 'wit', 'present', 'line', 'dialogue.The', 'show', 'team', 'newscasters', 'producers', 'writers', 'who', 'work', 'late', 'night', 'sports', 'news', 'show', 'called', 'Sports', 'Night', 'mock', 'ESPN', 'SportsCenter', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'small', 'group', 'people', 'have', 'are', 'always', 'fascinating', 'fun', 'watch', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'show', 'even', 'have', 'real', 'knowledge', 'sports', 'can', '*still*', 'watch', 'show', 'not', 'get', 'lost', 'woman', 'very', 'little', 'knowledge', 'most', 'sports', '*still*', 'fell', 'love', 'show', 'imagine', 'even', 'more', 'awesome', 'man', 'who', 'actually', '*knows*', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'when', 'sports', 'lingo', 'statistics', 'ocassionally', 'throw', 'out', 'there.This', 'show', 'even', 'little', 'star', 'power', 'very', 'recognizable', 'cast', 'most', 'obvious', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'who', 'now', 'starring', 'hit', 'show', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'strong-willed', 'soccer', 'mom', 'Lynette', 'Scavo', 'Felicity', 'husband', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'also', 'guest', 'stars', 'few', 'episodes', 'Sports', 'Night', '.This', 'half-hour', 'dramedy', 'only', 'lasted', '2', 'seasons', 'cancellation', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'day', 'television', 'incredible', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'episode', 'actually', 'little', 'less', 'half-hour', 'are', 'obviously', 'commercials', 'dvd', 'really', 'easy', 'start', 'watching', 'get', 'so', 'drawn', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'season', 'time', 'Bottom', 'line', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'still', 'cling', 'tiny', 'hope', 'network', 'execs', 'might', 'someday', 'realize', 'mistake', 'cancelling', 'bring', 'back', 'air', '.but', 'alas', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'happen']",Sports Night - The Complete Series

I just got this as a Christmas present after repressing commentary for nearly two years on its magnificence. So much of network television is assembly-line formula (with just the right amount of pretty ingenues, wacky goofballs, and villains-that-you-love-to-hate), that when an exceptional series comes along, I suspect it throws many viewers and critics off guard. ""Sports Night"" (courtesy of Aaron Sorkin) always trusted the smarts of its audience. It could show a staccato sequence of verbal insanity between ten people in a control room one moment, then a bitter backstage fight with the show's anchors the next. There have been complaints about the laugh track, but mercifully it was kept to a minumum; at least there weren't any excessive audience howls, as is usually the case with sitcom track, and the track was severely reduced by the second year. One critic complained that it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or drama; that's because it was a ""dramdey-"" though I never really liked that hybrid either. But I did enjoy the series' stories and especially these actors (where did Felicity Huffman and Josh Charles come from anyway?).

But all the things that made West Wing great, and all the things we would now expect of a Sorkin/Schlamme project are evident in this, their first collaboration.  The witty and intellectual dialogue, the rallying cry of the characters (""Quality will win over flash""), and the real emotion are all hallmarks of Sorkin's writing.  Add in the kinetic visual style of Schlamme's direction and you have an engrossing and fun half-hour of television - both in the watching and in the listening.This set has the complete series of shows and includes some commentaries from a variety of cast members and from Sorkin and Schlamme as well.  For my money, the two Joshuas' commentary is the most fun, and the S&S; commentaries the most informative.  There are also many extras featurettes that are interesting (if sometimes repetative with the commentaries), including some reflections on the shows and how their favoured actors have moved on (Felicity Huffman remains the biggest star with her Desperate Housewives fame).But it's the shows themselves that is the reason to buy these DVDs.  The cast's convincing delivery of rapid-fire dialogue in long shots that include physical action could not have been easy to do.  It's hard to pick out a key performance within the ensemble - this cast is truly the definition of an ensemble, with all characters needing to interact with all other characters (including the ""extras"" whose names are not in the opening credits).  What's almost as interesting is watching the development of the Sorkin-Schlamme style: in this show it is clearly not as polished as in their later collaborations, and the painful laugh track in Season 1 is ample proof that they didn't have all the creative control they needed.  Similarly, in Season 2 there are some plot developments that would be more at home on Three's Company, being artificial/arbitrary developments that don't seem to fit the characters as developed in Season 1 (Dana's plan for Casey to date other women, Dan's pychoses, and Jeremy's ""relationship"" with a porn actress).  It's not the way the characters deal with the problems: these are universally funny and moving.  No, the problem is that these plot developments feel arbitrary to the point that it's like someone went to the ""random sitcom plot generator"" and had it spit out some ideas.But overall, this is a better series than just about anything else.  I give it 4 stars because it will be compared (rightly or wrongly) with later, better Sorkin fare such as the first 4 seasons West Wing and most of Studio 60.",4,"Quite funny, good heart, some growing pains for the cast and the writers",1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2657,"['light', 'ultra-slick', 'West', 'Wing', 'even', 'slicker', 'Studio', '60', 'Sports', 'Night', 'almost', 'quaint', 'things', 'made', 'West', 'Wing', 'great', 'things', 'would', 'now', 'expect', 'Sorkin/Schlamme', 'project', 'are', 'evident', 'first', 'collaboration', 'witty', 'intellectual', 'dialogue', 'rallying', 'cry', 'characters', 'Quality', 'will', 'win', 'over', 'flash', 'real', 'emotion', 'are', 'hallmarks', 'Sorkin', 'writing', 'Add', 'kinetic', 'visual', 'style', 'Schlamme', 'direction', 'have', 'engrossing', 'fun', 'half-hour', 'television', 'watching', 'listening.This', 'set', 'complete', 'series', 'shows', 'commentaries', 'variety', 'cast', 'members', 'Sorkin', 'Schlamme', 'as', 'well', 'money', 'two', 'Joshuas', 'commentary', 'most', 'fun', 'S', 'S', 'most', 'informative', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'extras', 'featurettes', 'are', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'repetative', 'commentaries', 'including', 'reflections', 'shows', 'how', 'favoured', 'actors', 'have', 'moved', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'biggest', 'star', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'fame', 'shows', 'reason', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'cast', 'convincing', 'delivery', 'rapid-fire', 'dialogue', 'long', 'shots', 'include', 'physical', 'action', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'do', 'hard', 'pick', 'out', 'key', 'performance', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'truly', 'definition', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'needing', 'interact', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'extras', 'names', 'are', 'not', 'opening', 'credits', 'What', 'almost', 'interesting', 'watching', 'development', 'Sorkin-Schlamme', 'style', 'show', 'clearly', 'not', 'as', 'polished', 'later', 'collaborations', 'painful', 'laugh', 'track', 'Season', '1', 'ample', 'proof', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'creative', 'control', 'needed', 'Similarly', 'Season', '2', 'are', 'plot', 'developments', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'home', 'Three', 'Company', 'being', 'artificial/arbitrary', 'developments', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'characters', 'developed', 'Season', '1', 'Dana', 'plan', 'Casey', 'date', 'other', 'women', 'Dan', 'pychoses', 'Jeremy', 'relationship', 'porn', 'actress', 'not', 'way', 'characters', 'deal', 'problems', 'are', 'universally', 'funny', 'moving', 'No', 'problem', 'plot', 'developments', 'feel', 'arbitrary', 'point', 'someone', 'went', 'random', 'sitcom', 'plot', 'generator', 'had', 'out', 'ideas.But', 'overall', 'better', 'series', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'will', 'be', 'compared', 'rightly', 'wrongly', 'later', 'better', 'Sorkin', 'fare', 'such', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'West', 'Wing', 'most', 'Studio', '60']",Sports Night - The Complete Series

716821,A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B00006IRH9,Darren O'Neill,"[0, 0]","The show's tagline was true, it's a show about sports that's not about sports at all.  Sports Night takes the viewer behind the scenes at a fictional national cable sports station and follows the characters that make that show.I can count the number of television series that I've seen in their entirety more than once on one hand, one finger really.  That series is Sports Night from Aaron Sorkin.  I think I've seen it a good 4 or 5 times and it never gets old.  It's been 12 years since it's been on the air and I still get mad from time to time that such a well written and acted series didn't make it longer than two amazing seasons.Sports Night was ahead of its time, there's no doubt about that.  You get a good look at the birth of Sorkin's television writing style as the dialog here is witty and non-stop.  The comedic timing of everyone on the show I don't think has been equaled since.  The series was one of the first, if not the first, to use a moving camera to follow the action during a sitcom.  The characters are often on the move going from one room to another interacting with other characters as they do.  It really is a joy to watch it all unfold so naturally.For me, there has never been a better Dramedy before or since.  Sports Night had an uncanny knack at making you laugh one moment and making you cry in the next.  For such a short series and such a short format in half-hour shows (about 22 minutes minus commercials) the fact that the characters grab you and make you care as much as they do is a testament to the writers.If you look at the cast of this show and where they are now you'll understand what a springboard this show was and just how good the show could have been had it been allowed to continue on for a few more years.  The two main characters which co-anchor the nightly show on this fictional network are Casey McCall and Dan Rydell played by Peter Krause and Josh Charles respectively.  The show's producer is Dana Whitaker, played by Felicity Huffman and the network's general manager Isaac Jaffe was played by the legendary Robert Guillaume.  And, although he appeared in only 6 episodes in the 2nd season, William H. Macy stole the show when he was on screen playing Sam Donovan, the consultant called in to fix the problems at the network.It really is a shame this show didn't get picked up after ABC cancelled it, these characters just begged for more time to let the story unfold.

It's shorter than Is...","[2, 2]","I waited until I had the DVD collection to write this, because there's nothing I can say about this show that hasn't been repeated here 50 or more times. This is, without question, one of the true highlights of network television.The disc set is simple: 45 episodes spread across six discs, with the division between seasons one and two falling neatly at the end of the third disc. With so much programming packed onto the discs, there's really no room for anything else, so there are no special features.Thankfully, ""Sports Night"" requires no special features to be special.Tops on my ""it would have been nice"" list, though, is the removal of the laugh track.  It didn't do anything for the show and, thankfully, it's reduced to almost non-existent by the end of the series. If only Buena Vista had gone back and excised it altogether before putting out the collection.It's fullscreen, as expected--not many shows were filmed widescreen at the time (""Babylon 5"" being a notable exception), so that's only a complaint because I have a widescreen TV.I can't say enough good things about this show--this might well be the most positive, uplifting show ever produced...the thinking person's ""Touched by an Angel."" It's populated with good people who are struggling to become better people, with tight friendships of the variety most of us wish we had. As much as Isaac would like to claim otherwise, the line between job and family blurs into obscurity on this show, resulting in closeness, warmth, and inevitable infighting. I care about Dan, Casey, Dana, Isaac, Natalie, Jeremy and all the rest mostly because they care about each other.The only real complaint I have about this collection is it takes 18 hours to watch the whole thing, which is what I want to do every single time I pick up the box.  I guess I'll have to settle for watching 3-4 episodes a night, taking a couple of weeks to get through what I once waited a couple of years to see.Thanks to everyone involved in producing this wonderful show and DVD package.

716828,A3IVIS1OPYUU0X,B00006IRH9,Henry Perkins,"[144, 157]","[I rate it 4.5 stars.]&quot;Sports Night&quot; is about an eponymous fictitious hour sports news show on the fictitious Continental Sports Channel.  It's a sit-com targeted at an audience who knows what &quot;eponymous&quot; means without consulting a dictionary.  But this comedy isn't really about sports at all.  It's about intelligent, articulate people who use humor to relieve the pressures that their demanding jobs entail.Aaron Sorkin is the creator of &quot;Sports Night&quot;.  He also created &quot;The West Wing&quot; a year later, and when he realized that it was a lot easier selling viewers a fictitious White House administration than a fictitious sports news crew, he dropped &quot;Sports Night&quot; like a hot potato.  Most everyone knows that &quot;The West Wing&quot; isn't really about Washington politics; instead it's about intelligent, articulate people who use humor to relieve the pressures that their demanding jobs entail.  But few people have even heard of &quot;Sports Night&quot;.  It's a shame, though, because &quot;Sports Night&quot; may be the funniest show you never watched.There are plenty of valid criticisms of &quot;Sports Night&quot;.  For supposedly intelligent people the characters adopt a large number of unreasonable prejudices.  These are all politically correct prejudices, of course.  In the world of &quot;Sports Night&quot; when a homeless man flicks open a switchblade he's only cutting a sandwich to share.  Aaron Sorkin certainly has trouble writing multiple character voices.  Without seeing which characters recite which lines you'd be hard pressed to match characters with dialog from a script; the phrasing and delivery are largely interchangeable.  And fully half of the humor of &quot;Sports Night&quot; comes from a predictable formula of repetition.  Here's my pastiche of a &quot;Sports Night&quot; dialog:A: &quot;We need to talk.&quot;B: &quot;Is it about X?  Because I'm tired of talking about X.  We can talk about anything you want, as long as it's not about X.&quot;A: &quot;OK, then.&quot;B: &quot;It's not about X?&quot;A: &quot;It's not about X.&quot;B: &quot;OK, then.&quot;A: &quot;It's about X.&quot;B: &quot;I've got to tell you, if I could make your head explode using only the power of my mind, they'd never get the stain out of the carpet.&quot;&quot;Sports Night&quot; in its 2-year run won quite a lot of awards, but none of them were from the writing.  It's good that there's still a lot of comic meat left after you strip away the repetition schtick, and much of that comes from the talented cast: Josh Charles (who got his start in John Waters's &quot;Hairspray), Peter Krause (now in &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;), Felicity Huffman (&quot;Out of Order&quot;), Joshua Malina (who followed Sorkin to &quot;The West Wing&quot;), Sabrina Lloyd (&quot;Sliders&quot;), and Robert Guillaume (&quot;Benson&quot;).  But the most significant people on &quot;Sports Night&quot; weren't the writers or actors, but rather the impressive crew behind the cameras.  Here are just the award &quot;Sports Night&quot; won (skipping the 22 other nominations):1999 DGA Award, Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy Series: Thomas Schlamme1999 Emmy Award, Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series: Janet Ashikaga1999 Emmy Award, Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series: Thomas Schlamme1999 Humanitas Prize, 30 Minute Category1999 Television Critics Association Awards, Outstanding Achievement in Comedy2000 DGA Award, Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy Series: Thomas Schlamme2000 Emmy Award, Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series: Peter Smokler2000 Genesis Award, Television - New Series2000 PGA Golden Laurel Nova Award, Most Promising Producer in Television: Aaron Sorkin2000 TV Guide Award, Best Show You're Not WatchingDo you remember the first episode of &quot;ER&quot;?  This was ground-breaking television; it pulled you into the story by its technique of using moving cameras to record an action-packed scene in a single continuous piece rather than assemble lots of short cuts together.  It's not surprising that Thomas Schlamme directed several episodes of &quot;ER&quot; before bringing this technique to &quot;Sports Night&quot;.  Continuous action is very expensive to shoot as it requires the sets to be contiguous, the lighting to be in place for all the places the camera will move to, and most importantly all the actors and camera and sound people have to avoid mistakes for the duration of the scene.  But the payoff is a superior viewing experience.  This show really delivered.I could go on about the great recurring guest cast, with people like Teri Polo, Brenda Strong, William H. Macy, and Jayne Brook.  Or the great music that ends most every episode.  I could tell you that you'll be disappointed by the extras on the DVD collection (none at all).  Or that Sorkin bowed to network pressure and added a laugh track for about half the first season before it became clear that the viewers were people who didn't need a laugh track to get the jokes.  But the most important thing I can tell you is that you really should check out &quot;Sports Night&quot;.  Despite its several flaws it got many things right.  &quot;Sports Night&quot; is good entertainment.",5,Maybe the funniest show you never watched,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,5292,"['[', 'rate',

716829,A2XWBYHQY5MG9,B00006IRH9,Ian D. Smith,"[5, 5]","'Sports Night' is a show which will always polarize the viewers who watch it.  It is a dramedy is some ways not unlike 'Ally McBeal' (when it was at its best) with clever and witty (yet oftentimes precious) dialogue and a very distinctive style which refuses to compromise itself.  Its characters are complicated and realistically frustrating in their hectic and wishy-washy personal lives and romantic realtionships. It may have been pushed as a comedy from the start, but (as the rather awkward and hesitant laugh track for much of the first season highlights) 'Sports Night' makes it very clear each episode that the main objective of every script is not to be laugh out loud funny, but to develop characters and relationships in a unique setting and with a unique perspective.  This isn't to say the show is not humorous, with its often endearingly quirky characters and situations and rapid-fire Aaron Sorkin brand(TM) of dialogue which may occasionally be too circular (and thus trying), but more often than not produces some wonderful punch lines and triumphant speeches whose poetic energy most viewers cannot help but be swept up in.  Knowledge of sports is not a prerequisite, as the symbolism of sport related stories the show mentions but does not dwell on and the passion these people have for both athletics and their work reporting the news offers character development and surprising poignancy.  As for the oft-talked about dialogue, repeated back-to-back viewings do highlight the fact that Sorkin tends to have his characters talk an awful lot while saying rather less  - his trademark fast-paced and repetitive dialogue is alternatively invigorating and aggravating.  It's very stylized, distinctive and often realistic writing, but it can get redundant at times.This show's casting was sublime, headed by Josh Charles and Peter Krause portraying two highly likeable, complicated and passionate sports anchors.  The rest of the main cast, rounded out by the excellent Felicity Huffman and Robert Guillaume as well as Sabrina Lloyd and Joshua Malina inhabit characters who are eminently watchable, even as they struggle to conquer their own faults and everything from poor ratings to network pressure, personal tragedy and women named Sally.  Effortless performances and unique, intelligent writing powered this series, and elevate it above mere cult status or a footnote in the careers of people who have and will go on to bigger things.  Though a couple storylines in the last half of season 2 are not entirely up to par, the show thankfully has an agreeable finale which provides enough closure to dampen the sting of a premature cancellation by ABC.The DVD is bare-bones, with 7 or 8 episodes per disc and chapter stops at the beginning of each episode.  The picture and sound quality is very good, and highlight the award-winning technical prowess with which every episode was crafted.Indeed, this show has received an enormous amount of critical praise, for rarely is television's writing so focused, so smartly realized onscreen and so refreshingly different.  It deserves to be sought out and enjoyed by the curious and those weary of conventional and generic television.",4,"Smart, quirky and unique television",1056758400,"06 28, 2003",2003,3197,"[""'Sports"", 'Night', 'show', 'will', 'always', 'polarize', 'viewers', 'who', 'watch', 'dramedy', 'ways', 'not', ""'Ally"", 'McBeal', 'when', 'was', 'best', 'clever', 'witty', 'yet', 'oftentimes', 'precious', 'dialogue', 'very', 'distinctive', 'style', 'compromise', 'characters', 'are', 'complicated', 'realistically', 'frustrating', 'hectic', 'wishy-washy', 'personal', 'lives', 'romantic', 'realtionships', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'pushed', 'comedy', 'start', 'rather', 'awkward', 'hesitant', 'laugh', 'track', 'much', 'first', 'season', 'highlights', ""'Sports"", 'Night', 'very', 'clear', 'episode', 'main', 'objective', 'script', 'not', 'be', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'develop', 'characters', 'relationships', 'unique', 'setting', 'unique', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'say', 'show', 'not', 'humorous', 'often', 'endearingly', 'quirky', 'characters', 'situations', 'rapid-fire', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'brand', 'TM', 'dialogue', 'may', 'occasionally', 'be', 'too', 'circular', 'thus', 'trying', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'wonderful', 'punch', 'lines', 'triumphant', 'speeches', 'poetic', 'energy', 'most', 'viewers', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'swept', 'up', 'Knowledge', 'sports', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'symbolism', 'sport', 'related', 'show', 'mentions', 'not', 'dwell', 'passion', 'people', 'have', 'athletics', 'work', 'reporting', 'news', 'offers', 'character', 'development', 'surprising', 'poignancy', 'oft-talked', 'dialogue', 'repeated', 'back-to-back', 'viewings', 'do', 'highlight', 'fact', 'Sorkin', 'have', 'characters', 'talk', 'awful', 'lot', 'saying', 'rather', 'less', 'trademark', 'fast-paced', 'repetitive', 'dialogue', 'alternatively', 'invigorating', 'aggravating', 'very', 'stylized', 'distinctive', 'often', 'realistic', 'writing', 'can', 'get', 'redundant', 'times.This', 'show', 'casting', 'was', 'sublime', 'headed', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'portraying', 'two', 'highly', 'likeable', 'complicated', 'passionate', 'sports', 'anchors', 'rest', 'main', 'cast', 'rounded', 'out', 'excellent', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'as', 'well', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'Joshua', 'Malina', 'inhabit', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'eminently', 'watchable', 'even', 'struggle', 'conquer', 'own', 'faults', 'everything', 'poor', 'ratings', 'network', 'pressure', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'women', 'named', 'Sally', 'Effortless', 'performances', 'unique', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'powered', 'series', 'elevate', 'mere', 'cult', 'status', 'footnote', 'careers', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'will', 'go', 'bigger', 'things', 'couple', 'storylines', 'last', 'half', 'season', '2', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'par', 'show', 'thankfully', 'agreeable', 'finale', 'enough', 'closure', 'dampen', 'sting', 'premature', 'cancellation', 'ABC.The', 'DVD', 'bare-bones', '7', '8', 'episodes', 'disc', 'chapter', 'stops', 'beginning', 'episode', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'highlight', 'award-winning', 'technical', 'prowess', 'episode', 'was', 'crafted.Indeed', 'show', 'received', 'enormous', 'amount', 'critical', 'praise', 'rarely', 'television', 'writing', 'so', 'focused', 'so', 'smartly', 'realized', 'onscreen', 'so', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'be', 'sought', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'curious', 'weary', 'conventional', 'generic', 'television']",Sports Night - The Complete Series

I'm an avid TV watcher, but it somehow slipped beneath my radar, such that I'd barely heard of the show until a couple of months ago.  And this despite the fact that the show won three Emmys!That's when I learned that one of my favorite TV writers (Aaron Sorkin, The West Wing) had also written this half-hour &quot;dramedy.&quot;  (I hate that word, but it's better than &quot;sit-com,&quot; which doesn't do Sports Night justice.)  I'm such a huge Sorkin fan than when I saw that the (unfortunately short) series run of Sports Night was available on DVD, I bought it without having ever seen a single episode.And I wasn't disappointed.  While it's clear that with The West Wing Sorkin has polished his dialogue style, it's still unmistakable here: sharp, smart, staccato exchanges between characters, so quick and lively that it makes the characters seem even more intelligent than they are.  It's not exactly realistic, but it's what I WISH reality was.Like The West Wing, there's a great ensemble cast, too many to list individually.  Most have gone on to other projects.  And like The West Wing, Sports Night has its heart in the right place, as characters struggle with love, friendship, and work.A great show.

The characters of SPORTS NIGHT tackle religion, politics and much, much more on this great and eternally underrated TV show (marketed as a standard comedy sitcom but is much more complex, probably had the wrong original audience).With a mix of characters ranging from the elderly and very (albeit grudgingly) fatherly managing editor played by Robert Guillume, to the neurotic executive producer played by Felicity Huffman, the shy and tightly wound pair of associate producers (Josh Molina and Sabrina Lloyd) to the two byumbling but not superficial anchors of Peter Krause and Josh Charles. You can't get a better conglamoration of characters or better actors to play them with the right amount of comedy and splendor this side of &quot;The West Wing&quot;.From a slow news day to personal feelings about ethics in sports as well as the role sports play in society this show covers them all in conjunction with the everyday office gossip, problems with management and interpersonal relationships. That this show is still funny and smart at the same time is a true testament to the writing skills of Aaron Sorkin.Notable guest appearences include Peter Reigert, John de Lancie (for all you Star Trek fans) and William H.

716838,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00006IRH9,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[40, 44]","The proof of the pudding for the value of ""Sports Night"" is probably the fact that my wife, who usually refrains from attending sporting events with me and invariably walks out of the room if I turn on Sports Center, loved ""Sports Night.""  This Aaron Sorkin creation aired for roughly two seasons worth of episodes between 1998-2000, and it provides the same sort of witty repartee and verbal sparring that we get on ""The West Wing,"" albeit without the political overtones that make it a hit or miss with the ideological sensibilities of the viewer.  On this show the outrage comes out of the casual dismissal of Babe Ruth as the athlete of the century, if you are really concerned about such things, but mostly this show is about the glories of frustration.On one level the frustration comes from the wonderful and wacky world of being the 3rd rated 11 p.m.cable  sports news show, where live prize fights do not go as long as planned and a newly signed baseball free agent disses the Big Apple in an interview.  This is a world where how to stretch a story 15 seconds to the next commercial break raises the distinct possibility of destroying lives or at least careers, but not as much as the grim possibility that the network will be bought by somebody who will immediately kill off the show.  Unlike ""Murphy Brown,"" the most obvious fictional show to bring up for comparison, such crises might be a source of biting humor but they are not comic situations.But more importantly there are the love lives of the main characters, which produce considerably more frustration on the part of the viewers.  Casey McCall (Peter Krause), the anchor on the right is recently divorced and has strong feelings for producer Dana Whitaker (Felicity Huffman), who reciprocates them.  However, these feelings do nothing to preclude the couple from putting every obstacle possible in their way.  Dan Rydell (Josh Charles), the anchor on the left, falls for Rebecca Wells (Terri Polo), who he learns is not only married to a jerk, but interesting trying to work things out with him (the jerk, not Dan).  Then there is Natalie Hurley (Sabrina Lloyd), the associate producer, who waits with pretty much no patience for Jeremy Goodwin (Joshua Malina), the walking encyclopedia of sports and other trivial matters, to notice that he is smitten by her.Overlooking both areas of frustration is Isaac Jaffe (Robert Guillaume), the font of all wisdom and chief buffer with the CSC network, even if he does not always understand what his young charges are complaining about at any given moment.  But when Isaac says something, like when he tells Dan that he loves him, but that he is never going to be impressed by a young white man comparing himself to Jackie Robinson.  ""Sports Night"" is one of those works were you need to remember that God is in the details.  Example: When Isaac gives Dana tickets to see ""The Lion King"" on Broadway, she returns all excited and quotes the lines of the character who summons all the animals; Robert Guillaume did the voice of Rafiki in the 1994 movie.  So be open to deep and hidden meanings when you work your way through these six DVDs.If you actually have a true appreciation for sports and if breaking a world's record or remembering the career of a forgotten sports figure have deep personal meaning for you, then ""Sports Night"" is an even richer tapestry.  But the chief charm here is the verbiage flying back and forth at high speed (it does for the half-hour sit-com what ""Moonlighting"" did for the hour long sit-com in that regard).

The only time I have ever watched a sports news show was when my cable went out for several days, yet I adore Aaron Sorkin's show about a show. Unlike West Wing, Sports Night does not often delve into political issues.  It is a comedy about people and the situations they get into. If you are turned off by West Wing, don't automatically dismiss this show: I don't like West Wing but love Sports Night.A thinking person's TV comedy is a rarity to find.  Most comedies dumb down to the audience. Sports Night does not yet is able to make me laugh at every turn. Think the mental level of Wilson Wilson (Home Improvement) under a deadline, and you have an episode of a show known as Sports Night.The cast of fresh faces have since shown that they had what it took to make a good show. The constantly stressed out Dana was played by Desperate Housewives Felicity Huffman.  Peter Krause's Casey McCall has gone on to win a SAG for his work in Six Feet Under.  Joshua Malina of West Wing also stars.From excellent pacing to a wonderful cast this is one series I watched on first run, rerun and now DVD.  The cast was tight, and well developed.  You feel like you know them as they slowly show the people behind the personalities without having to take the viewer to 'serious dramatic scenes in a restaurant/bar'.  When they needed to spice up the show and William Macy joined the cast, the producers managed to avoid jumping the shark and instead used the opportunity to enrich the show. Sorkin was also able to incorporate Robert Guillaume's stroke without turning the show into a pity party.I like this show so much that when I saw it on sale at the local store, I bought it before I even checked the price.(On a student budget I don't make a habit of doing this).  Looking at other DVD boxed sets, how many can you buy for under 50 dollars and get over 2 seasons worth of episodes?Unlike many boxed sets, with Sports Night you won't burn out watching the same episodes over and over simply because you get so many for your price (45).  For this reason alone I would recommend it.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[6, 10]","I missed ""Sports Night"" during it's 2 year run, but I bought this Boxed Set just to see what Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme were doing before ""West Wing"".  I see all kinds of reviews here fawning all over Sports Night, most of them awarding the title ""Best Show You Didn't Watch"" to the show.The show is good, even worth dropping 30 or 40 bucks on a show ""you didn't watch"".  On it's best episodes Sports Night is INCREDIBLY good - but the ""best"" episodes are mixed in with many that are little more than prime-time soap operas.Almost every character gets a romantic interest - or two - over the course of the two seasons, and I was frankly bored by a lot of it.  The epitome was the ""will they or won't they"" atmosphere that surrounded the characters of producer Dana (played by Dangerous Housewive's Felicity Huffman) and anchor Casey (Six Feet Under's Peter Krause).The famous Sorkin dialogue is often in evidence as the characters swagger through their make-believe world bolstered by language witty beyond reality.  The show is best when the characters get to show off their passion.  Joshua Malina (later on Sorkin's West Wing) gets many of these passionate speeches, beginning with one of the best speeches I've ever heard about why hunting is not very ""sporting"".These characters have principles, but they're also flawed and funny.  Out of 45 episodes only about a dozen are superlative.  In fairness, the ""worst"" episodes are as good as anything I've seen on most prime-time programming, but I wouldn't say it is at all accurate to claim  Sports Night is ""as good as West Wing"".The West Wing consistently transcends both television and politics.

I thought about adding this to my collection (I never watch the new stuff, I'm stuck on the old: Northern Exposure, The Avengers (Mrs. Peel only!), Taxi, Bob Newhart, Frasier, etc (and still desperately waiting for Thirtysomething, but that's another story).  But then I thought, well, maybe my memory is flawed.  So I did, in fact, rent the 6 discs and re-watched.  After a slightly slow start, by mid-first season, I was hooked.  And by the last episode, I was furious: why, how could this gem of a show just end?  While I liked West Wing, the lighter atmosphere of a sports studio (as opposed to the White House) was perfect for the foibles of this outstanding ensemble cast.  Typical Sorkin style (its origins, in fact), with humor, pathos, romance, sweetness, tartness, and just plain humanity.  If your tastes run to some of the old shows I mentioned, you cannot help but think this show brilliant.  A keeper indeed.  I'm ordering this set for my collection now.

716847,AHE0DZVN59W56,B00006IRH9,"Oezekoye ""oezekoye""","[4, 4]","Sports Night is one of my top 5 favorite TV shows of all time. It is probably the second best-true 'dramedy' ever (&quot;The Wonder Years&quot; being the first in my opinion.)Three things make this show one of television's best ever. The first and foremost is the dialogue writing. Throughout the whole DVD boxed set, one can count the physical jokes on one hand. In this show, the humor is in the dialogue, and it is very fast paced and very witty. Because of this, the writers of &quot;Sports Night&quot; are not limited to typical sitcom rhythm.The second great thing about 'Sports Night' is that, for the most part, the plot is driven by the characters rather than by the situation. In the strictest sense of the word, I wouldn't call 'Sports Night' a sitcom. This is a show about people dealing with their problems such as intra-office romance, competition, loneliness, illness, uncertainties, and various other neuroses.Third, I was really impressed with the acting on the show especially that of Josh Charles (Dan) and Peter Krause (Casey). The series has many emotional scenes where I felt that a lesser actor would have not shown the restraint required for the show to remain believable.Another good thing about this boxed set is that they didn't include a title and theme song with each of the 40+ episodes in the set. The show wasn't meant to have a laugh track, and unfortunately some of the first season episodes have one included.

What an unbelievably bittersweet feeling I was left with (which can only compare to the short-lived FIREFLY series)...as cornball & mushy as it sounds, over the course of the series you grow to love these people as if they were best friends you'd known all your life. When I think of how truly class acts like this get cancelled after only 2 stellar seasons, and other LESS classy shows take their place and remain on the air.....well, to put it bluntly, it's sickening.There are about 236 reviews ahead of mine, so I don't know what else I could add but to say this show reached a level of perfection very few ""dramedies"" ever could. Hear what I'm saying, you doubters: This show, IMHO, can easily stand alongside M*A*S*H, Hill Street Blues, All In the Family, The Practice, Seinfeld...you get my point. This is not an exaggeration. I remember watching the last episode on network TV and noticing a renegade tear running down my face, and whattayaknow, the same thing happened again tonight. And I'm the farthest thing from a sports fan you could even imagine. Casey, Dan, Isaac (&lt;==the best role Robert Guillaume has EVER played), Jeremy, Dana & Natalie, in the course of the show's life, left indelible impressions that ANYONE who appreciates quality TV could relate to.You hear this phrase far too often (and used loosely far too often, I might add), but IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. If you haven't seen the show yet, go to your wallet now and pick up the box set. If you have doubts, search out your nearest DVD rental place and watch it.

You actually finding yourself relating to all of the characters.  The series lasted for 2 seasons and all loose ends are tied up nicely in the finale episode.  This is the ideal packaging with individual cases with descriptions on the back.  The laugh track started as the show writers tried to market it as a comedy.

Unfortunately, this show was about ten years before it's time and it only lasted for a few short years. The dvd's bring back all the memories of this amazing series. I only have one gripe and a few other's have mentioned it. This show was not filmed before a studio audience and the one thing I hate about dvd's, especially a series like this, is that a laugh track was not required. The series was pure genius and the laugh track detracts, ever so slightly, from the brilliance that is sports night. I can recall another really great series from Ireland called Father Ted. It was a brilliant series but that dang laugh track drives me nuts!Now that I've got that off my chest let me say this about the laugh track. It's not overdone. The added laugh tracks selectively so as to detract slightly to the final product. So, you won't be bombarded with laughter coming from the dvd's. The majority of laughter you hear will be your family sitting around you watching a brilliant show that didn't get a chance to realise it's full potential. Aaron Sorkin did though. He created the West Wing a year later and the rest is history. All of the principal actors have gone on to other successes. Peter Krause has been in a number of tv movies and was in Dirty Sexy Money and most recently Parenthood. Josh Charles has been starring in the Good Wife for the past few years. Felicity Huffman turned in an Oscar-nominated performance in TransAmerica and has been starring in Desperate Housewives for years. Joseph Molina starred in The West Wing for most of it's run. Sabrina Lloyd played in Sliders and has done a few other things. Robert Guillaume still pops up from time to time on television but I think he may have retired at this point in his life.So, after all this do I recommend this series?

716863,A2EGXV8S6URQ8U,B00006IRH9,Visor,"[9, 64]","I tuned into this show by accident one time when it was on the air, and what caught my attention was Sabrina Lloyd (""Hey!  That's the chick from Sliders!"")  I couldn't remember the time or channel it was on, so I never caught the show again.Later the DVD set came out, and as you can see Amazon's site has been flooded with countless rave reviews with scores of 5/5.  This rekindled my interest, but since I wasn't willing to buy a box set based on user reviews alone, I hoped to be able to rent it.  Unfortunately, no local Blockbuster rented out this relatively-unknown series, and none of my friends had even heard of it.  Recently, I joined Zip.ca (similar to Netflix in the U.S.) and I was finally able to rent out the first disc in the series.I must say that this series is psycho-crazy & busy!  I've never seen a TV show that tried to cram in so many sub-plots into a 22 minute-per-episode series.  The worst of it is in the first 3 episodes, which quite literally gave me a headache to watch.  It was incredibly difficult to follow what was going on, as the pace was incredibly fast - too fast for my poor brain to process.  The craziness reminded me of when I tried to watch the very first episode of The West Wing, which after 20 minutes I changed the channel and have never watched the show again.Anyway, the second episode of Sports Night is the most difficult to follow... Dan is accused of taking a pro-drug view (I think?), but the origins of this view are cloudy.  Did he say it in the magazine?  Did he say it while on the air the day before?  They practically skipped over this entire prologue and went straight to talk about the consequences.  Then there's Sabrina Lloyd's character (Natalie) who starts whoozing over another character named ""Jeremy"" (I hadn't realized that she was talking about the nerdy guy at that point - was I supposed to have memorized his name after the first episode?)  This craziness in the first few episodes is not the right thing to do so early in the series as it doesn't help in grabbing new viewers.Fortunately, things start to settle down by the middle of the 3rd episode and begin to form a much more cohesive storyline from the 4th episode and onward.  The episodes start to stitch together beginning with Natalie's brush with sexual harrasment from a football ""star"" (was he real or fiction?  I don't watch sports so I have no idea...)Despite the fact that the episodes were getting better (and I'm sure discs 2-6 also reflect this improvement), I can understand why the show was cancelled.  You can't name a show ""Sports Night"" and expect to have many different demographics tuning in.  As I mentioned, the only reason the show caught my attention was because Sabrina Lloyd was on the screen at the same time I flipped to the channel.  However, my infatuation with her has worn off considerably since Sliders first aired almost 10 years ago (where is she now?)I suppose if you love the West Wing, you'll love this show as it has that same crazy/busy style.  If you can't stand the West Wing, avoid this DVD set (which is getting to be hard to find anyway as it's not exactly a best seller).  I'm sure I'll get flamed for ""tainting"" this review list filled with 5/5 ratings, but hey I gave it a fair 3/5 as the series was starting to show potential in the middle of the first disc.  I may even rent the rest of the discs sooner or later, but it will most likely be later as I've got many other TV series to check out from Zip.ca.",3,Rent before you buy - for West Wing fans only,1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,3485,"['tuned', 'show', 'accident', 'one', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'what', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'Hey', 'chick', 'Sliders', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'time', 'channel', 'was', 'never', 'caught', 'show', 'DVD', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'Amazon', 'site', 'been', 'flooded', 'countless', 'rave', 'reviews', 'scores', '5/5', 'rekindled', 'interest', 'was', ""n't"", 'willing', 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'based', 'user', 'reviews', 'alone', 'hoped', 'be', 'able', 'rent', 'Unfortunately', 'local', 'Blockbuster', 'rented', 'out', 'relatively-unknown', 'series', 'none', 'friends', 'had', 'even', 'heard', 'Recently', 'joined', 'Zip.ca', 'similar', 'Netflix', 'U.S.', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'rent', 'out', 'first', 'disc', 'series.I', 'must', 'say', 'series', 'psycho-crazy', 'busy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'tried', 'cram', 'so', 'many', 'sub-plots', '22', 'minute-per-episode', 'series', 'worst', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'quite', 'literally', 'gave', 'headache', 'watch', 'was', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'follow', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'pace', 'was', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'too', 'fast', 'poor', 'brain', 'process', 'craziness', 'reminded', 'when', 'tried', 'watch', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'West', 'Wing', '20', 'minutes', 'changed', 'channel', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'again.Anyway', 'second', 'episode', 'Sports', 'Night', 'most', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Dan', 'accused', 'taking', 'pro-drug', 'view', 'think', 'origins', 'view', 'are', 'cloudy', 'say', 'magazine', 'Did', 'say', 'air', 'day', 'practically', 'skipped', 'entire', 'prologue', 'went', 'straight', 'talk', 'consequences', 'Then', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'character', 'Natalie', 'who', 'whoozing', 'over', 'character', 'named', 'Jeremy', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'was', 'talking', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'point', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'memorized', 'name', 'first', 'episode', 'craziness', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'not', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'so', 'early', 'series', ""n't"", 'help', 'grabbing', 'new', 'viewers.Fortunately', 'things', 'start', 'settle', 'down', 'middle', '3rd', 'episode', 'begin', 'form', 'much', 'more', 'cohesive', 'storyline', '4th', 'episode', 'onward', 'episodes', 'start', 'stitch', 'together', 'beginning', 'Natalie', 'brush', 'sexual', 'harrasment', 'football', 'star', 'was', 'real', 'fiction', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'sports', 'so', 'have', 'idea', 'fact', 'episodes', 'were', 'getting', 'better', ""'m"", 'sure', 'discs', '2-6', 'also', 'reflect', 'improvement', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'name', 'show', 'Sports', 'Night', 'expect', 'have', 'many', 'different', 'demographics', 'tuning', 'mentioned', 'only', 'reason', 'show', 'caught', 'attention', 'was', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'was', 'screen', 'same', 'time', 'flipped', 'channel', 'However', 'infatuation', 'worn', 'off', 'considerably', 'Sliders', 'first', 'aired', 'almost', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'where', 'now', 'suppose', 'love', 'West', 'Wing', ""'ll"", 'love', 'show', 'same', 'crazy/busy', 'style', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'West', 'Wing', 'avoid', 'DVD', 'set', 'getting', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'anyway', 'not', 'exactly', 'best', 'seller', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'flamed', 'tainting', 'review', 'list', 'filled', '5/5', 'ratings', 'hey', 'gave', 'fair', '3/5', 'series', 'was', 'starting', 'show', 'potential', 'middle', 'first', 'disc', 'may', 'even', 'rent', 'rest', 'discs', 'sooner', 'later', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'later', ""'ve"", 'got', 'many', 'other', 'TV', 'series', 'check', 'out', 'Zip.ca']",Sports Night - The Complete Series
