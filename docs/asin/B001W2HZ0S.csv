Majority of instructional videos neglect that.-  Her instructions are more thoughtful than in any other bellydance program I've seen so far (except Ansuya's).- Unlike some instructors who don't realize that you need to practice the moves individually before you can put them together and up to speed, Amira makes sure you absorb each movement by repeating it many times.- The camera is always where it belongs (which is rare in the world of bellydance videos).-  Amira's style is very soothing and helps focus on movement execution. There are bellydancers that are more picturesque, but their intense Mideastern charm might overwhelm or distract a beginner. Their bodies also may intimidate an overweight novice, whereas Amira shows that you don't have to be slender to be able to move with admirable grace. And Amira is certainly pretty as well.- Amira's appearance and the choice of background and music are very tasteful.This video is probably the gentlest, non-intimidating introduction to bellydance I've seen so far. But the drawback of this approach is that you might outgrow it rather quickly.

She teaches many foundation movements from hip drops to basic shimmies, pays special attention to proper dance posture, and includes a warm-up/cool-down.The overall production of the DVD is very professional, good lighting and sound. There are no annoying, abrupt camera angles or zoom effects. Amira's outfits are tasteful and appropriate, and do not distract from, or hide her movements.Though I enjoyed the ""combinations"" section, a short repetitive drill of the moves learned, I have to say I was disappointed that it did not show how to layer the moves together to create a simple dance routine.Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a beginner to bellydance. It is a good ""starter"" instructional DVD for the person who does not have access to a bellydance class and great for ""at home practice"" for those that do. Another great beginner bellydance DVD to try is Bellydance Basics and Beyond with Jenna.

That's how I felt about bellydance.  I thought it was a beautiful art form and a great workout, but no matter how many DVDs I tried, something was still wrong when I watched myself performing the moves in the mirror.  I couldn't figure out what I wasn't doing right.  And I've been working at it.  I've got over twenty bellydance DVDs.  The Goddess Workout (which was my favorite up till now), Veena and Neena, Suhaila, Rania, Blanca, Neon...I swear I have everybody represented.My point is that Amira explains the moves in a way that I was able to understand and grasp.  i can finally do the Camel and it looks right!  I get it now.  This new understanding affects my ability to do all my other bellydance workouts and videos, and I think Amira has been instrumental in that change.

First, the production values are high. The setting is lovely and restful, with beautifully sensuous pillows and gauzy drapes hanging in the background. The music is exotic and hypnotic, and Amira's voice and pleasant accent make you feel you're on a nice vacation, far from your own stressful world. The exercises are explained carefully and done slowly, so that you can pick them up. They are filmed in such a way that you can see the movement (no cutting away to a face while you are trying to figure out what the hips are doing.) There is a warm-up at the beginning and a gentle stretch at the end. If you skip the combination, which you might want to do at first, while you're learning the movements, you can do the whole dvd in an hour. The sections are short enough so as not to tire you out or frustrate your beginner's attention span.

I learned I had not been tucking my tailbone in, which had been leading me to some lower back discomfort after belly dance workouts.

The filming is very clear and the shots and angles are in the right places so you can see what is going on.Amira outlines the basic, fun moves of belly dance in a very clear manner. Though I would not use this DVD repeatedly for long workouts, it is:1.) a great place to start to learn how to belly dance by developing a strong foundation and putting these movements into your muscle memory strongly and correctly so that they are there when you need them, and so that you do not injure yourself by incorrect posture.2.) helpful even if you already have some belly dance experience, like me.

Dorris ""eternally learning""","[14, 14]","I've often thought that if having a belly is a criterion for belly dancing, I was certainly well-qualified; further, if I'm going to cart this belly around, I might as well tone and slim it down.  Since I am a woman ""of a certain age"", there are muscle groups I haven't used since grade school, so I was anxious that I not rupture anything.  Amira's Belly Dance 101 provides simple, straight-forward, easy to understand directions (including what NOT to do) for each movement.  At first, my brain sent signals to large muscle groups that were ignored, as though the muscles were on a coffee break and couldn't be bothered to respond, but by persistently sending the signals over time I could see things like lateral chest movement, alternating shoulder thrusts, and smooth hip slides.  I used Amira's warm up, isolating exercises, and cool down like a regular exercise tape and disregarded combinations until I had every one of the individual isolating movements down pat.  Then I moved on to Ansuya's Lavish Layers in much the same way I approached Amira's 101, and now I do both tapes. Ansuya's tape is also excellent, but for jumping into belly dancing as a rank beginner, Amira's Belly 101 is far and away the clearest route.  In addition to toning up my mid-section, I've increased my spine and neck flexibility, and mobility of movement overall.  Want to know the best part?

1244206,A1BVKUA32LKR2W,B001W2HZ0S,Phantom Bookworm,"[2, 2]","I've just recently started to learn how to belly dance. I thought this video was very informative on the basics of posture and the most common moves that are utilized in the art of belly dance. I would definitely recommend this video for beginners. It wasn't too long and it wasn't too short. She gives enough instruction to give you a pretty clear idea of what you should be doing, and often reminds you to check your posture so you don't hurt your lower back. I didn't think this video would be much of a workout, but I did muster up a light sweat and I felt very good, very relaxed afterward.EDIT: I've ordered and tried out some other belly dance DVDs, which has given me a deeper perspective on the effectiveness of this one. While learning to this DVD, my middle back muscles started killing me, to the point where I couldn't sit or walk for extended periods of time. I figured I must be doing something wrong with my posture, but I didn't know what I was doing wrong. I thought I would benefit from other instructional DVDs, so I purchased Sadie's Complete Belly Dance Guide and Leila of Cairo's Belly Dance for Beginners. The instructors in these other DVDs go into a lot more detail about what you should and shouldn't be doing. I think Amira is a great instructor and I still use her video for the Combinations and stretch segments -- not to mention that her DVD has a very peaceful ambiance -- but her explanations for the movements are rather bare. I STILL recommend her instructional video, but I wanted to update my review after experiencing other beginner-friendly DVDs for belly dance.",5,Fun and Informative,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,1601,"[""'ve"", 'just', 'recently', 'started', 'learn', 'how', 'belly', 'dance', 'thought', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'informative', 'basics', 'posture', 'most', 'common', 'moves', 'are', 'utilized', 'art', 'belly', 'dance', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'video', 'beginners', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'short', 'enough', 'instruction', 'give', 'pretty', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'often', 'check', 'posture', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'lower', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'workout', 'did', 'muster', 'up', 'light', 'sweat', 'felt', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'relaxed', 'afterward.EDIT', ""'ve"", 'ordered', 'tried', 'out', 'other', 'belly', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'given', 'deeper', 'perspective', 'effectiveness', 'one', 'learning', 'DVD', 'middle', 'back', 'muscles', 'started', 'killing', 'point', 'where', 'could', ""n't"", 'sit', 'walk', 'extended', 'periods', 'time', 'figured', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'wrong', 'posture', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'wrong', 'thought', 'would', 'benefit', 'other', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'purchased', 'Sadie', 'Complete', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Guide', 'Leila', 'Cairo', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'Beginners', 'instructors', 'other', 'DVDs', 'go', 'lot', 'more', 'detail', 'what', 'should', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', 'think', 'Amira', 'great', 'instructor', 'still', 'use', 'video', 'Combinations', 'stretch', 'segments', 'not', 'mention', 'DVD', 'very', 'peaceful', 'ambiance', 'explanations', 'movements', 'are', 'rather', 'bare', 'STILL', 'recommend', 'instructional', 'video', 'wanted', 'update', 'review', 'experiencing', 'other', 'beginner-friendly', 'DVDs', 'belly', 'dance']",Amira's Bellydance 101 Belly Dancing Basics For Beginners
