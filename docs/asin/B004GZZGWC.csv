1407571,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B004GZZGWC,RavenRing,"[5, 6]","Yusuke Urameshi is a 14 year old punk. He skips school, gets into fights, and has a problem with authority. He is the last person anyone would have expected to die saving the life of a little boy. Certainly Spirit World didn't expect it and now they aren't sure what to do with him! So Yusuke is given a chance to prove that he deserves another shot at life. He returns to life with a new appreciation for living. But Koenma, ruler of the Spirit World, isn't quite finished with Yusuke. He makes him Spirit Detective and sets him straight to work!I first caught a glimpse of this show many, many years ago while it was airing on TV. I watched about 2 minutes of it before my sisters made me change the channel. It was enough to get me intrigued - a dead guy attending his own funeral? But it would be years later before I finally found the series and got to watch it. It is one of the first few anime series I ever watched and it will forever hold a special place in my anime lovers heart. But even clouded with the misty eyes of nostalgia, I wouldn't have watched it 5 times unless it was really good. I've watched it 4 times in English and once in Japanese and it is easy to see that the English is what makes this series. It is good in Japanese; it is a masterpiece in English. Not only are the voice actors phenomenal, but the script adaption is probably the best I have ever seen in anime (and I've seen lots of anime). I normally prefer to watch series in Japanese (its like studying!), but this series is just so much more awesome in English!Oh yeah, if you thought Spirit Detective = mystery story, you were a little off. Spirit Detective really equals guy who catches/beats up demons. Criminal demons of course. YuYu Hakusho is a fighting anime with lots of comedy and great characters. Yusuke is a very likable character, despite his bad attitude. His friends, enemies, and even the random supporting characters are all well done as well. The series starts off a little slow as the author works to find his footing, but by the end of the first season things are on a roll.I admit that there are some small, tiny problems with this series. The author clearly changes his mind about important things several times throughout the series, and some of the characters are rather inconsistent. You can tell that the author was improving his writing as he worked on this series. Despite the inconsistencies, I appreciated that the author made changes to improve the story rather than letting himself be constrained by his earlier material. His second major series, Hunter x Hunter, is much more thought out than YuYu Hakusho.YuYu Hakusho is one of my favorite anime of all time. Its not perfect, but it is great. I never dreamed that it would be released in Blu-ray and I was ecstatic when I found out. I've bought the entire series twice now, and it looks like I will be buying it a third time! I have high hopes for the quality - the quality of the regular sets isn't that great. It is mostly because the original production wasn't very good quality, but I am hoping that the Blu-ray edition can clean it up a bit. Or a lot, I'm not picky :)",5,Our Hero....

Some differences from original dub but nothing major at all save a few names here or there pronunciation wise (none of the MC thank God!).
