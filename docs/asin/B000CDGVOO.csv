957211,A37AABH6ZIONM4,B000CDGVOO,A,"[4, 4]","A lot of people gave low rating to this movie because they thought it was going to be more like Kiki's Delivery Service or Princess Mononoke. This just happens to be one of many Studio Ghibli classics with non-fantasy stories (like Grave of the Fireflies, I can Hear the Sea and only Yesterday). I really love this charming and endearing movie because of the message of finding oneself and believing in oneself. It is the only Ghibli movie so far to have a spin-off movie made from it: The Cat Returns (also love that movie!)I prefer the Japanese language version to the English dub, but that's just how I like to watch anime. The American voice cast did a really good job, too. I really love that there are two different set of subtitles in English. One that matches the Japanese language version, and one that matches the English dub version.The Blu-Ray is clear and crisp and the sound is perfect. So many details in the old man's shop are now visible. Did you see the words ""Porco Rosso"" on the clock?",5,"Sweet, endearing Ghibli movie.

The characters are touchingly realistic and poignant as they navigate a difficult period of growth and development with a mix of intense creativity and unfocussed existential uncertainty. In particular, the character of Suzuku tugs deeply at the heart-strings of the viewer, as she fluctuates between the ennui of young adulthood and a fevered dream of creativity as she attempts to ""prove"" herself to her family, her loved ones, and even to herself.Stricken with low self-esteem, she mistakenly believes that everyone around her - including her love interest - is confidently following their dreams, without a single second thought or self-doubt. Suzuku believes that she alone is `not good enough', that she is wasting her life and her talent by failing to produce - immediately! - a material example of her dedication, hard-work, and raw talent. After she pours her heart and soul into a youthful novel, she is able to find peace with the understanding that she is ""good enough"" with or without a successful novel, if only because she genuinely tried. The movie ends on a note that I wish more `creative genius' features would focus on - Suzuku plans to hone her craft, because it needs polishing, but she has found a quiet peace and acceptance with herself and those around her.A long and introspective movie, ""Whisper of the Heart"" is a lovely movie for anyone who has ever struggled with low self-esteem or with general self-acceptance.~ Ana Mardoll",4,You don't have to prove yourself...,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,1610,"['Whisper', 'Heart', '/', 'B000CDGVOOAlthough', 'usually', 'avoid', 'movies', 'youthful', 'angst', 'uncertainty', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'touched', 'deep', 'nerve', 'characters', 'are', 'touchingly', 'realistic', 'poignant', 'navigate', 'difficult', 'period', 'growth', 'development', 'mix', 'intense', 'creativity', 'unfocussed', 'existential', 'uncertainty', 'particular', 'character', 'Suzuku', 'tugs', 'deeply', 'heart-strings', 'viewer', 'ennui', 'young', 'adulthood', 'fevered', 'dream', 'creativity', 'prove', 'family', 'loved', 'ones', 'even', 'herself.Stricken', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'mistakenly', 'everyone', 'including', 'love', 'interest', 'confidently', 'following', 'dreams', 'single', 'second', 'thought', 'self-doubt', 'Suzuku', 'alone', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'wasting', 'life', 'talent', 'failing', 'produce', 'immediately', 'material', 'example', 'dedication', 'hard-work', 'raw', 'talent', 'heart', 'soul', 'youthful', 'novel', 'able', 'find', 'peace', 'understanding', 'good', 'enough', 'successful', 'novel', 'only', 'genuinely', 'tried', 'movie', 'note', 'wish', 'more', 'creative', 'genius', 'features', 'would', 'focus', 'Suzuku', 'plans', 'hone', 'craft', 'polishing', 'found', 'quiet', 'peace', 'acceptance', 'herself', 'her.A', 'long', 'introspective', 'movie', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'lovely', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'struggled', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'general', 'self-acceptance.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Whisper of the Heart
957213,A1PY6SJT8UHL92,B000CDGVOO,Amazon Customer,"[108, 112]","This movie, produced by Studio Ghibli (the same company that produces Miyazaki's movies) is a gem. Unlike all of Miyazaki's movies, this one tells in a very poetic way a story about credible young people, their coming of age, and their growing awareness on their dreams and aspirations. It is also a beatiful love story between two children who are discovering that they seem to be made for each other.This is also one of those movies that will remind you of your school years, and I find amazing the accuracy with which children's emotions are depicted. Indeed, this is something I really appreciate about most of these Japanese directors: the ability of depicting children for what they are, rather than as cute mature and witty ""little"" adults, as much of Hollywood instead does.As in virtually all of Studio Ghibli's movies, the drawings are beautiful, some of them breathtaking, and the characters are lovable and well constructed. One of the major ""characters"" is a cat that will certainly end up loving!If you liked this movie, I would also strongly suggest you to look for another two Studio Ghibli movies that share the same genre. One is ""Ocean waves"" (which centers around the complicated love-hate relation between two high school student), and the other one, which is absolutely wonderful, is ""Only yesterday"", the story of a young Tokio woman who rediscovers herself during a vacation in the countryside.

But no, the song is a very present element to this wonderful animated movie. It's a distinct film in Studio Ghibli's repertoire, given that it's not a tangent fantasy and the setting of Tokyo is never really abandoned. It instead explores the subject of magic in other forms; just what is magic, and where can one find it? The first and only film directed by the late Yoshifumi Kondo, it is a heart-warming movie that explores the magic of life, and what it means to find yourself. It's something many can relate to, including yours truly.Shizuku is a well-meaning but insecure junior high school student in Japan. Pressure is high on her year as they need good grades if they are to get into a good education. Shizuku, however, is restless and spends most of her time helping out other people, particularly with adopting English language songs into Japanese for her friends. Still, she longs for a direction. Her kind-meaning but demanding family don't help her there.A series of events, however, lead Shizuku to meet Seiji, a boy from her year who wants to be a violin-maker. The two set up a warm, believable friendship. Inspired by Seiji's belief in his dream, Shizuku realises that to find herself, she has to follow her heart. Seiji's uncle, who runs an antique store (one of the items there is the Baron Cat featured in The Cat Returns), helps her in looking inside herself. Shizuku realises she wants to be a writer. But should she stay in school, or quit like Seiji and follow her dream? Can she find the courage?John Denver's ""Country Road"" is a solid backbone to Whisper of the Heart, which is a beautiful piece of filmwork - written and storyboarded by Hayao Myazaki, it's a deep film with a profound, human insight. It's possibly even more distinct for the visual style of Shizuku's fantasy world, visualised by established artist Naohisa Inoue, whom Myazaki approached for the film. Though copyright issues may have led to its late US-release, Whisper of the Heart is a different kind of gem from Ghibli - a thoughtful revelation on what it means to not only look inside yourself and find out who you are, but what it means to act on it. It is an animated movie to be cherished, beautiful both visually and philosophically.",5,Guaranteed to Leave a Smile on your Face,1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,2356,"['was', 'sure', 'when', 'heard', 'Country', 'Road', 'beginning', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'somebody', 'had', 'turned', 'radio', 'song', 'very', 'present', 'element', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'movie', 'distinct', 'film', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'repertoire', 'given', 'not', 'tangent', 'fantasy', 'setting', 'Tokyo', 'never', 'really', 'abandoned', 'instead', 'subject', 'magic', 'other', 'forms', 'just', 'what', 'magic', 'where', 'can', 'one', 'find', 'first', 'only', 'film', 'directed', 'late', 'Yoshifumi', 'Kondo', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'magic', 'life', 'what', 'find', 'something', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'including', 'yours', 'truly.Shizuku', 'well-meaning', 'insecure', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Japan', 'Pressure', 'high', 'year', 'need', 'good', 'grades', 'are', 'get', 'good', 'education', 'Shizuku', 'however', 'restless', 'most', 'time', 'helping', 'out', 'other', 'people', 'particularly', 'adopting', 'English', 'language', 'songs', 'Japanese', 'friends', 'Still', 'direction', 'kind-meaning', 'demanding', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'there.A', 'series', 'events', 'however', 'lead', 'Shizuku', 'meet', 'Seiji', 'boy', 'year', 'who', 'be', 'violin-maker', 'two', 'set', 'up', 'warm', 'believable', 'friendship', 'Inspired', 'Seiji', 'belief', 'dream', 'Shizuku', 'find', 'follow', 'heart', 'Seiji', 'uncle', 'who', 'antique', 'store', 'one', 'items', 'Baron', 'Cat', 'featured', 'Cat', 'Returns', 'looking', 'Shizuku', 'be', 'writer', 'should', 'stay', 'school', 'quit', 'Seiji', 'follow', 'dream', 'Can', 'find', 'courage', 'John', 'Denver', 'Country', 'Road', 'solid', 'backbone', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'filmwork', 'written', 'storyboarded', 'Hayao', 'Myazaki', 'deep', 'film', 'profound', 'human', 'insight', 'possibly', 'even', 'more', 'distinct', 'visual', 'style', 'Shizuku', 'fantasy', 'world', 'visualised', 'established', 'artist', 'Naohisa', 'Inoue', 'whom', 'Myazaki', 'approached', 'film', 'copyright', 'issues', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'late', 'US-release', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'different', 'kind', 'gem', 'Ghibli', 'thoughtful', 'revelation', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'act', 'animated', 'movie', 'be', 'cherished', 'beautiful', 'visually', 'philosophically']",Whisper of the Heart

As I have fallen in love with numerous films from this studio, I have no qualms purchasing films they offer without previously viewing them. Such was the case with Whisper of the Heart and I was not disappointed. This film is perhaps one of my favorite offerings from Studio Ghibli. It is down to earth and presents relatable characters in a beautifully written storyline.Synopsis:Our story starts out with Shizuku who is determined to read 20 books during the summer. Her father works in the local library and she can be constantly found there as well. She reads loads upon loads of books, particularly fairy tales. In fact, she reads so much that she cares for little else, friends and writing lyrics excepted, and her grades are suffering as a result. Apparently in Japan (or just in this movie) your entrance tests to high school are a huge deal. The High School you go do partly determines your success in life and the oppertunities available to you (something like that). Instead of being caring particularly about the exams Shizuku is instead facinated at solving a mystery revolving around her library books. It seems that every book she has checked out a ""Seiji Amasawa"" has checked out before her. She can't help but wonder who this boy is like.Meanwhile, Shizuku figures out that her best friend, Yuko, likes a fellow classmate of theirs, Sugimura. After her friend leaves her this valuble piece of knowledge, Shizuku figures out she left her library book somewhere and races off to retrieve it. In the process she bumps into a boy who proceeds to insult the lyrics she had been working on (and incidentally had left in the library book that he found). Calling him a jerk all the way home, Shizuku ends up revising said lyrics, and showing them to her friends at school who are deeply impressed. Later, Shizuku is on the subway to the library to drop off a lunch for her Dad when she spots a cat on said subway. Intrigued, she follows the cat to an antique shop, leaves the lunch in the shop and once again runs into the rude boy.Later, at school, Sugimara tries to convince Yuko to go out with a friend of his. Yuko blows up and him and leaves crying. Sugimara is crestfallen at what he could have possibly have done wrong and Yuko decides not to go to school the next day, telling the whole story to Shizuko. At school, with pleading from Sugimara, Shizuku tells the boy that her best friend has a crush on him. Sugimara then admits he's been in love with Shizuku for years. This is bad. Shizuku realizes that this is a horrible situation to be in, turns Sugimara down because she doesn't return his feelings and also would never ""steal"" her best friend's crush, and rushes over to the antique store for some solice. Who should she run into but the rude boy? The rude boy lets her into the antique shop and Shizuku finds out that the boy's dream is to be a violin maker. She also finds out that he is none other than Seigi Amasawa! But the time they spend together, between talking about a cat, an antique, and violins proves to smooth over any past rudeness and they become friends.However, everything can't stay peaches and cream. The next day at school Seigi tells Shizuku his dream is coming true! His parents have allowed him to apprentice himself to a violin maker in Italy for 2 months. If he shows promise he will be allowed to stay, after his Jr. High graduation, but if he doesn't show promise he must go to High School. In the same conversation, Seigi admits to checking out so many books in hope that Shizuku would notice him as she always seems to have her nose stuck in a book. (Make no mistake though, Seiji still has read the books he has checked out!). Shizuku realizes that she has developed a crush on Seigi but it is all for naught as he is going away for two months. Despondant, Shizuku has tea with her best friend, Yuko, and tells her how inadaquate she feels compared to Seigi, who not only has read a lot of books, but puts his talents to use and knows what he wants to do with his life. Shizuku, determined to proove herself worthy of him, decides to use the two months to write a book, as she has been told she's a gifted writer. Inspired by one of the antiques in the store, Shizuku starts writing constantly, staying up at least once until 4 am., to the detriment of her grades. Her parents, however, say that she must follow her heart. The two months rolls along and she finishes her book. She still feels so inadaquate to Seigi and believes that she can never catch up with his ""greatness.""This is when Seigi's grandfather, owner of the antique shop, tells her this valuable lesson. Artists are like geodes; there are valuable gems inside an ordinary rock. Now these gems can be overshadowed by the showy crystals inside, and you can waste your time polishing those. But the real gems are uncut and rough, needing not only to be unearthed but polished. You can't tell just by looking, what valuable stone a geode may contain, but that doesn't mean there isn't one inside of the rock. He also tells her that we have to keep polishing, and yes, her initial story is good, but she needs to polish it.

The filmmakers have captured the moments in every child's life when they first feel the inklings of adult love.

While most just simply say ""don't buy this, buy teh creed!!!111"", others go into heavy detail about why it wasn't one of their favorites. Whisper of the Heart of course has a charm about it and there's obviously nothing offensive about it such as bad acting, dialogue and such but there wasn't that kind of wonder and magic I got from Totoro, Spirited Away or even Nausicaa.Shizuki is a high school student who impresses many with her poetry, does her chores and reads a lot of books but she's quite unhappy. She meets Seiji, a violin maker which at first she gets off on the wrong foot with but then starts to like him. Eventually she gets inspired to write a story based on the Baron, a strange cat statue found in a shop.Many people say Spirited Away is the best Studio Ghibli film while it does have its detractors with usually a common complaint: its length. The film clocked in at a sliver over 2 hours. The Cat Returns, Whisper's ""sequel"", was at a small 1 hour and 10 or so. Whisper is at around an hour 50 and it does feel like it at times. So much stuff happened but it ultimately doesn't propel the story forward it's just a lot of stuff. The Baron in his chatty form shows up past the hour mark and his appearance is cameo at best.Will kids love it though? I don't know, it has none of the magic that previous Ghibli films had.

957233,A39LRLKACX89IP,B000CDGVOO,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[20, 21]","I collect anime, and have recently had the opportunity to see the dub of this great work on TCM before it's released on DVD.  I've owned the subtitled version for a few years now, and was impressed that no newer anime movies can even touch the quality of animation displayed in this film.  Yes, the story is good although I'd call it less a coming of age film and more a exploring our youthful options type of story.  This is a slice of life type of movie, not an action or an adventure. It's interest is in how well it can capture the audience.Capture you it does.  I recently showed a friend of mine three animations.  The first was a nicely done anime episode of a series called Bleach.  The second to show the higher level of detail was Mulan, a Disney animation, with at least some footing into their cel movies.  Finally, I showed Whisper of the Heart.  The first was fine for most watching as are most decent anime series, the art and characters don't get in the way of the viewing.  The second was a Disney theatrical release which is as good as can normally be expected.  Decent detail and some nice visual effects to help drive the movie plot.Then there was Whisper...  Here's a little test if you don't believe me straight up.  Watch the sequence where the girl follows the cat up to the antique shop.  I've never seen such an attention to detail as this before.  That an artist could render drawings of a city scape with this much detail and realism, is flat out amazing.  I've seen animators blog on their extra's disc about the challenge to accomplish some special effect in an animated movie or series.  Looking at it from their perspective, I could see the difficulties.  Then looking at it from what was accomplished in this film, I think they are just whining over minor details.Here are some more good examples in this film, check out the color changes with the lighting at night and in the morning at the student desk in the bedroom.  Check out the many transparencies and translucencies from glass doors and windows.  Check out the subtle motions of background items, and the detail and functionality.  Nothing seems like an after thought, or out of place.  The items the characters use and react too, always seem to have function.  Even the special grandfather clock in the antique store, while imaginative somewhat, still looked and operated like it could have been real.The style of Miyasaki characters are is on display here as well.  He must have provided some of the drawings, if only in conceptual mode for this film.  What is amazing for him is that he can create characters that are obvious animations. This is in contrast to the growing trend to create photorealistic characters, in mostly rendered animation.  Instead Miyasaki characters are simple in their appearance, and features. Yet, they react to the incredibly detailed backgrounds, and all blend together to form a smooth animation without seeming busy or cluttered.  This is one of those films that sneaks up on you.  You find you can remember the story long after its over with.  It's a pity most animated films don't have craftsmen of this level of talent.  Other studios, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on other film projects that were so ill conceived, a focus group of children could have told them they were bad!If you read the plot summary of this film you will not want to watch it, so don't.  Just view the film when you are relaxed, and you'll have an unforgettable experience.  Studio Ghibli films tend to be like that.  This one doesn't do any environmental or political preaching like a few of them are known to do.  It simply entertains, and shows off animes to be a true art form, a fact that is often overlooked in the commercial world of crank them out, and get them to market, cookie cutter animations.",5,"Best Cel Animation I've Ever Seen, A Master Work!!",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,3823,"['collect', 'anime', 'have', 'recently', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'dub', 'great', 'work', 'TCM', 'released', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'subtitled', 'version', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'was', 'impressed', 'newer', 'anime', 'movies', 'can', 'even', 'touch', 'quality', 'animation', 'displayed', 'film', 'Yes', 'story', 'good', ""'d"", 'call', 'less', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'more', 'exploring', 'youthful', 'options', 'type', 'story', 'slice', 'life', 'type', 'movie', 'not', 'action', 'adventure', 'interest', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'capture', 'audience.Capture', 'recently', 'showed', 'friend', 'mine', 'three', 'animations', 'first', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'anime', 'episode', 'series', 'called', 'Bleach', 'second', 'show', 'higher', 'level', 'detail', 'was', 'Mulan', 'Disney', 'animation', 'least', 'footing', 'cel', 'movies', 'Finally', 'showed', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'first', 'was', 'fine', 'most', 'watching', 'are', 'most', 'decent', 'anime', 'series', 'art', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'viewing', 'second', 'was', 'Disney', 'theatrical', 'release', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'normally', 'be', 'expected', 'Decent', 'detail', 'nice', 'visual', 'effects', 'help', 'drive', 'movie', 'plot.Then', 'was', 'Whisper', 'Here', 'little', 'test', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'straight', 'up', 'Watch', 'sequence', 'where', 'girl', 'cat', 'up', 'antique', 'shop', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'attention', 'detail', 'before', 'artist', 'could', 'render', 'drawings', 'city', 'scape', 'much', 'detail', 'realism', 'flat', 'amazing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'animators', 'blog', 'extra', 'disc', 'challenge', 'accomplish', 'special', 'effect', 'animated', 'movie', 'series', 'Looking', 'perspective', 'could', 'see', 'difficulties', 'Then', 'looking', 'what', 'was', 'accomplished', 'film', 'think', 'are', 'just', 'whining', 'over', 'minor', 'details.Here', 'are', 'more', 'good', 'examples', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'color', 'changes', 'lighting', 'night', 'morning', 'student', 'desk', 'bedroom', 'Check', 'many', 'transparencies', 'translucencies', 'glass', 'doors', 'windows', 'Check', 'subtle', 'motions', 'background', 'items', 'detail', 'functionality', 'Nothing', 'thought', 'place', 'items', 'characters', 'use', 'react', 'too', 'always', 'seem', 'have', 'function', 'Even', 'special', 'grandfather', 'clock', 'antique', 'store', 'imaginative', 'somewhat', 'still', 'looked', 'operated', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real.The', 'style', 'Miyasaki', 'characters', 'are', 'display', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'must', 'have', 'provided', 'drawings', 'only', 'conceptual', 'mode', 'film', 'What', 'amazing', 'can', 'create', 'characters', 'are', 'obvious', 'animations', 'contrast', 'growing', 'trend', 'create', 'photorealistic', 'characters', 'mostly', 'rendered', 'animation', 'Instead', 'Miyasaki', 'characters', 'are', 'simple', 'appearance', 'features', 'react', 'incredibly', 'detailed', 'backgrounds', 'blend', 'together', 'form', 'smooth', 'animation', 'seeming', 'busy', 'cluttered', 'one', 'films', 'sneaks', 'up', 'find', 'can', 'remember', 'story', 'long', 'pity', 'most', 'animated', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'craftsmen', 'level', 'talent', 'Other', 'studios', 'have', 'spent', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'other', 'film', 'projects', 'were', 'so', 'ill', 'conceived', 'focus', 'group', 'children', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'were', 'bad', 'read', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'Just', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'relaxed', ""'ll"", 'have', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'one', ""n't"", 'do', 'environmental', 'political', 'preaching', 'few', 'are', 'known', 'do', 'simply', 'off', 'animes', 'be', 'true', 'art', 'form', 'fact', 'often', 'overlooked', 'commercial', 'world', 'crank', 'out', 'get', 'market', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'animations']",Whisper of the Heart

957240,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B000CDGVOO,"ewomack ""ewomack""","[15, 16]","Like chocolate milk and pancake batter, utter realism and animation rarely mix. Cartoons, completely unrestrained by the laws of physics, usually depict fanciful, imaginary, or surreal worlds and creatures that real fleshy human beings can relate to only indirectly or analogously. Talking lions, anthropomorphic toasters, ants with eyebrows, singing lawn furniture. That's the stuff of animation. ""Kid's stuff,"" at least for many living in the United States. But, across the Pacific, one of Japan's greatest animation houses, Studio Ghibli, has continually broken this tradition by incorporating human characters so believable and lifelike they could already exist two doors down. ""Whisper of the Heart"" contains realism so tangible it could work as a live action movie.Apart from a few scenes, the entire plot of this animated film takes place within the human realm. The heroine, Shizuku Tsukishima, a junior high school student in a middle class Japanese family, faces the perennial coming of age question: ""what should I do with my life?"" Her easily distracted squirrelish mind often wanders through fairy tales and imaginary stories. She follows tangents and roads less traveled, a habit that induces her to follow a stray cat, Muta, from a public train to an antique store. Once there she discovers an enigmatic sculpture of a well dressed cat. Its eyes radiate like fiery nebulas. The store's proprietor, Shirou Nishi, refers to it as ""The Baron."" Something about this statuesque cat catches Shizuku's attention and she decides to write a fairy tale narrated by The Baron. For a few minutes the movie shifts out of reality to depict pieces of this story. But reality quickly, and harshly, returns.Along the way Shizuku gets haunted by a name: Seiji Amasawa. This person has already checked out nearly every book she has from the library. Examining the old style checkout cards - now extinct from computerized libraries - reveals this startling pattern. She begins to fantasize about the mysteriously reoccurring name. By this point her friends have taken an interest in boys, which also piques her own interest. One friend has a stultifying crush on a somewhat brutish baseball player who wouldn't notice a flaming brick thrown at his face. Shizuku tries to set them up but falls flat into a humiliating ""whoops!"" moment. The evasive name of Seiji wafts in the background.When Shizuku discovers the identity of Seiji Amasawa, she's disappointed and a fight ensues. Nonetheless, the two build a relationship based on the ineffable stuff that all relationships are built on. Then Seiji, in pursuit of his life's ambition, decides to move to Cremona, Italy. This throws Shizuku into an emotional abyss. She seeks the solace of her friends. The same ones that previously sought relationship advice from her. Shizuku's own flowering fairy tale confronts reality. Will this relationship work? How can it?Allegories of lost love permeate the story. An old clock, restored by Nishi, depicts a Prince staring longingly at his true love who only appears at twelve o'clock. Nishi himself dreams about the return of his long lost love, Louise. Even in his old age he still hopes. The lonely figure of the Baron parallels this tragedy. A companion piece, a well-dressed female cat also named Louise, disappeared along with Nishi's Louise of the flesh. Life interferes with love. And, despite the ending, life appears ready to deliver a blow to Seiji and Shizuku. Arguably, the ending remains open to interpretation. The constant refrain of ""Country Roads,"" made famous by John Denver but sung here by Olivia Newton-John, hearkens those who have gone astray or wandered off to return home ""where they belong"" (at least in the minds of the amorously abandoned). Eerily, Shizuku and Seiji's story could end up mirroring Nishi's and Louise's.""Whisper of the Heart"" is one of Studio Ghibli's most poignant and beautiful films. Adults will probably identify with its themes more than children or teenagers. It searches for magic in reality rather than in fantasy, but it challenges these dreams with the vicissitudes of workaday life.

I was prepared from reading previous reviews that ""whisper of the Heart"" would not be a fantasy laden tale.  That being said, I must still say that I did enjoy it.  I must also say that it is a bit slow.  I think they could've cut out about 1 hour's worth of filler (numerous scenes of the girl just walking or the entire first portion of the movie that's nothing but her running errands) and still conveyed their message.  Compared to other Studio Ghibli films this was just somewhat boring (most of their films are slow, but this was really slow).  Also, I felt the choice of ""Country Roads"" as a theme song was very out of place in this film. As soon as you hear the words ""Virginia and Mountain Mama"" you start to wonder why they ever chose the song.  I laughed everytime I heard it because it sounded so out of place in Tokyo.  Other than that, the movie is a very touching coming of age story, although the ending was a bit unbelievable. Overall, it was worth watching at least once to see the origin of ""The Cat Returns"" and I'm glad I did.

957243,A1NZ3OBRUF13FA,B000CDGVOO,"Fred Burroughs ""Ladies and gentlemen, Fred Bu...","[4, 5]","Most action movies are pure fluff, relying on clich&eacute;s, special effects, and bravado to win over the mostly male audiences that keep them in the pipeline. They are junk food. They provide the illusion of satisfying us but they are not nutritious or filling at all. But then there are those action movies which are so solid, well-written, well-acted, well-paced, and well-done that we don't even think of them as action movies. They are the action movie gourmet meals. Think of Lawrence of Arabia or even Full Metal Jacket. Movies like that are outside the traditional action realm, and tend to have much wider appeal. They are entertaining and smart.Likewise, the action movie's female counterpart, the romance movie, tends to be fluff, relying on overwrought acting and writing, schmaltzy music, and clich&eacute;s. Even rarer than the ""good"" action movie is the good romance movie. A movie that realistically depicts love and interpersonal relationships without relying on any clich&eacute;s or overwrought acting or writing. City Lights is one example of this, the works of Ernst Lubitsch are another. Think of his movie The Shop Around the Corner. It's a love story that works by depicting real ""moments"" (as critics like to call them). Instead of being a hammy soap opera, these movies work by touching us on a real level. You don't cringe watching these, you don't say to yourself ""Who talks like that?"" and you don't hear schmaltzy music all of the time to let you know what emotion you are supposed to be feeling.I'm bringing all this up to make the point to any guy who is reading this that ""Yes, there are good romance movies you will like."" Whisper of the Heart is a movie like that, and BOY is it a good one. You've heard of the rare romance movie that both men and women like equally, this is one of them. Guys will like it because it isn't junk food. Comparing this movie to typical romance garbage like Up Close and Personal is like comparing a piece of filet mignon to a Slim Jim. People talk like real people, they have real problems that 14-year-olds have, and they relate to their family like real 14-year-olds do.This movie should be easy to find on DVD and for once I do not hesitate to say ""watch it dubbed."" Miyazaki himself says that his movies should be seen in the language of the viewer, and not subtitled, so that you can devote your full attention to the image on the screen and not to reading subtitles (I make the exception for Princess Mononoke which IMO has a inferior dub). It was written by Miyazaki but directed by another very talented man who unfortunately died not long after making this, his only film. The influence of Miyazaki shows in this film, although the animation style is a little different, and the style of the backgrounds is *very* different. I do not know what process was used, but I'd say they based all of the backgrounds on real photographs. The lighting in them is so well that some of them could easily pass for photographs on an NTSC display unless you look at them long and closely. The pacing in this film is also very well-done. Too many directors hurry through pacing, they don't want there to be any silences because they don't know how to use silence.

957244,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000CDGVOO,Galina,"[8, 9]","""Whisper of the Heart"" (1995), animated coming-of-age story was scripted and storyboarded by Hayao Miyazaki and directed by the Yoshifumi Kondo. Hayao Miyazaki (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke) saw in Kondo his successor as Studio Ghibli's film director. Unfortunately, Kondo was only able to direct a single Ghibli film, ""Whisper of the Heart"", before his untimely death in 1998. As magical and beautiful as the rest of Studio Ghibli feature films I've seen, gentle ""Whisper of the Heart"" focuses on the dreams, feelings, insecurities, and search for life's meaning of two teenagers - middle school students Shizuku Tsukishima and Seiji Amasawa in modern Tokyo. We also meet Shizuku's and Seiji's friends and families. We will follow a  smart and curious  cat that likes to ride the subway  train by himself and one day would lead Shizuku to a magical shop run by Mr. Nishi, a kind, wise old man whose teenaged grandson Seiji Amasawa checks out from the local library the same books Shizuku does. The boy dreams of becoming a violin master. There are untold stories behind the beautiful objects in Mr. Nishi's store that wait to be told, but it would take a talent to capture and to write them down. In the shop, Shizuku meets her first love and starts the long road on becoming the writer.The beauty of the film lies not in the mythical worlds or the fantastic creatures from the fairy tales. It is in the little film's  universal appeal, in the way all viewers, the children and their parents,  can relate to one girl's  search for place in life, for her determination to follow the dream , and for support, guidance, and approval she so desperately needs and receives from her busy but loving and understanding parents. My favorite scene in the film is the conversation 15-year-old Shizuku has with her mother and father at the kitchen table about her future.

Like Li' Abner, Dick Tracy, Peanuts, Doonesbury, Calvin and Hobbes, Get Fuzzy...? That's just the American tradition, of course, and it's quite distinct from the European -- Tintin, for instance, or Asterix and Obelix -- and from political cartooning. The daily strips are addictive; even though 4 out of 5 installments are utterly boring in and of themselves, the ongoing development takes on a ""life"" inside your own Life. Perhaps the key is that Life itself is a steady panel of trivial moments that accumulate interest as memories.But I'm not an ""anime"" addict. I watched ""Whisper of the Heart"" as an outsider, much as a Turk or an Icelander might pick up an American newspaper and find himself thoroughly non-plussed by a panel of Rex Morgan MD. I rented Whisper simply because a musical colleague told me that I'd be ""blown away"" by one scene in which three elderly Japanese men pull out instruments and join in a jam session with the two teenage lovers-to-be who are the principal characters. Well, I rented, I watched, I waited. Beautifully drawn animation! Marvelously evocative of Japan, where I have lived. Sweet, humane, and stunningly boring for the first 45 minutes ...... and then, the jam session! Hard to believe my eyes! Is this an in-group joke perpetrated by some Japanese animationist who happens to be a Baroque music dilettante? The song they play is the goldy-moldy ""Country Road, Take me Home"", but the instruments the oldsters play are a viola da gamba, a six-course lute, and a Renaissance cornetto, while the boy hero plays Bassano-like ""diminutions"" on his violin. Huh? and again, huh?The jam session is, happily, the turning point of the film. Thereafter the story-line develops some gentle momentum; one starts to engage with the cute little cartoon kids, to have a pocket of warmth in one's heart for them, like for the children of a distant cousin... or for the grandchildren of Dagwood and Blondie. Without any justification, I had always supposed that Japanese anime films were invariably dark, violent, edgy... but Whisper of the Heart is pure syrup, a mushy love story without the truly Japanese denouement of a 'double-suicide'.Net evaluation: watch it for the gorgeous graphics, and don't expect much from the story.",4,"Notes of a ""Comic Strip"" Junky ...",1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,2337,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'comic', 'strip', 'junky', 'life', 'know', 'panels', 'newspaper', 'Li', 'Abner', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'Peanuts', 'Doonesbury', 'Calvin', 'Hobbes', 'Get', 'Fuzzy', 'just', 'American', 'tradition', 'course', 'quite', 'distinct', 'European', 'Tintin', 'instance', 'Asterix', 'Obelix', 'political', 'cartooning', 'daily', 'strips', 'are', 'addictive', 'even', '4', '5', 'installments', 'are', 'utterly', 'boring', 'ongoing', 'development', 'life', 'own', 'Life', 'Perhaps', 'key', 'Life', 'steady', 'panel', 'trivial', 'moments', 'accumulate', 'interest', 'memories.But', ""'m"", 'not', 'anime', 'addict', 'watched', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'outsider', 'much', 'Turk', 'Icelander', 'might', 'pick', 'up', 'American', 'newspaper', 'find', 'thoroughly', 'non-plussed', 'panel', 'Rex', 'Morgan', 'MD', 'rented', 'Whisper', 'simply', 'musical', 'colleague', 'told', ""'d"", 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'one', 'scene', 'three', 'elderly', 'Japanese', 'men', 'pull', 'out', 'instruments', 'join', 'jam', 'session', 'two', 'teenage', 'lovers-to-be', 'who', 'are', 'principal', 'characters', 'Well', 'rented', 'watched', 'waited', 'Beautifully', 'drawn', 'animation', 'Marvelously', 'evocative', 'Japan', 'where', 'have', 'lived', 'Sweet', 'humane', 'stunningly', 'boring', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'then', 'jam', 'session', 'Hard', 'believe', 'eyes', 'in-group', 'joke', 'perpetrated', 'Japanese', 'animationist', 'who', 'be', 'Baroque', 'music', 'dilettante', 'song', 'play', 'goldy-moldy', 'Country', 'Road', 'Take', 'Home', 'instruments', 'oldsters', 'play', 'are', 'viola', 'da', 'gamba', 'six-course', 'lute', 'Renaissance', 'cornetto', 'boy', 'hero', 'Bassano-like', 'diminutions', 'violin', 'Huh', 'again', 'huh', 'jam', 'session', 'happily', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'Thereafter', 'story-line', 'gentle', 'momentum', 'one', 'engage', 'cute', 'little', 'cartoon', 'kids', 'have', 'pocket', 'warmth', 'one', 'heart', 'children', 'distant', 'cousin', 'grandchildren', 'Dagwood', 'Blondie', 'justification', 'had', 'always', 'supposed', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'films', 'were', 'invariably', 'dark', 'violent', 'edgy', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'pure', 'syrup', 'mushy', 'love', 'story', 'truly', 'Japanese', 'denouement', ""'double-suicide'.Net"", 'evaluation', 'watch', 'gorgeous', 'graphics', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'story']",Whisper of the Heart
957246,A2JAAUES5NXG4Z,B000CDGVOO,Glen Boisseau Becker,"[6, 6]","Many a long year has passed since a movie impressed, charmed, and touched me like _Whisper of the Heart_. Those with preconceptions about anime might be surprised to discover that this is not primarily a comedy or an action-filled melodrama but a finely detailed, believable portrait of modern junior high school students in Japan, with all the ambitions and insecurities, the longings for adventure and for love, that young teens almost anywhere might feel. In fact, it brings to mind a coming-of-age television series called _The Wonder Years_.In _Whisper of the Heart_ the protagonist is a winsome, vaguely self-effacing girl named Shizuku--a bookworm whose encounters with a mysterious cat, an old man, and a boy with hidden talents prompt her to discover her own undeveloped gift for writing. The occasional insertion of a brief dream sequence lends an extra element of fantasy and visual variety to a strikingly beautiful movie.Such were my initial reactions to _Whisper of the Heart_ as dubbed into English by the Disney studio. The DVD edition, however, provides other choices: watching the film as it was first released in Japanese (with or without English subtitles) or even viewing the original storyboards--more than a thousand pencil sketches by Hayao Miyazaki, which flash by in synch with the soundtrack of your choice.The Disney dubbing emerges as a characteristically slick feel-good movie. The infusion of American slang is reasonably effective, the voiceover acting even more so (with a few exceptions), and the surround-sound audio mix more elaborate than in the Japanese version. In some scenes, the dubbed version actually has more dialog than the original, as characters keep talking when their faces are turned away from us. The moralizing is perhaps more explicit than in the original--the message that students need to study hard, just as artists need to labor at their craft--yet it is inspirationally presented. Though many visible details reflect Japanese culture, young viewers could easily forget that they were watching a foreign picture.There is one distasteful moment in English where Shizuku calls the cat a rather vulgar name that has no equivalent in the Japanese script (most parents will not object to the word, but it would not pass muster in my classroom). Even more cringeworthy is the line where Cary Elwes--who is supposed to play a supernaturally wise, urbane, gentlemanly character--unintelligently mispronounces ""lapis lazuli."" The gaffe is all the more obvious since at the end of the previous scene, a few seconds earlier, Harold Gould pronounced the term correctly. Speaking of gaffes: David Gallagher mispronounces his own character's name; at best, he Americanizes ""Seiji Amasawa"" in a way that no other cast member does.Early in the film, a significant plot point involves Shizuku writing new lyrics to the John Denver song ""Country Roads."" Watching in English, we can't help wondering why the student is rewriting the song for her middle school graduation (but months ahead of time). Her version--to the extent that we can make out the words--has nothing to do with graduation, nor does it sound like remotely capable writing. In the original film, it makes sense that Shizuku is adapting the American song into Japanese and, in the process, making a poetic statement about life as a lonely and uncertain road.What no one seems to have noticed is that the Japanese and American editions have startlingly different plot resolutions. By modifying and adding just a couple lines of dialog, the Disney team have given us a satisfyingly predictable Hollywood happy ending (details under ""Spoiler Alert"" below). The Japanese ending is more bittersweet and potentially more haunting. Which one best fits the story becomes practically a litmus test of viewer preference and personality.And just when I would like to say ""Skip the Disney dub and watch the film with subtitles,"" it turns out that the DVD spoils the Japanese version (and not the dubbed one) by cropping off the top of the image during the entire epilogue, which is wordlessly played out during the closing credits. The viewer is simply unable to see the final interaction between the young heroine's friends Yuko and Sugimura.A sufficiently dedicated viewer might watch the film in Japanese and then watch the closing credits of the dubbed version. Unfortunately, finding the credits requires using both a chapter stop and a fast-forward button. The film is indeed a heartwarming and visually impressive masterpiece, but unless the recent Blu-Ray release has corrected the problem with the Japanese credits, an ideal DVD edition has yet to appear.SPOILER ALERT: In the Disney adaptation, handsome young Seiji ultimately returns from Cremona, Italy, eager to explain that his mentor has pronounced him a potentially gifted violinmaker who will still need years of practice. Being sensible as well as sentimental, Seiji has realized that he really wants to attend high school at home in Japan with Shizuku. After finishing high school, he will be able to pursue his dreams in Cremona; once he is a famous violinmaker and Shizuku is a professional author, they can get married. Shizuku teases him for sounding a little corny, but as the sun rises, they have their whole lives optimistically planned out.In the original script, however, the Japanese dialogue makes clear that Seiji has returned to Tokyo a day ahead of schedule to attend his junior high school (middle school) graduation ceremony. Within a few days, he will be leaving for Cremona to resume his long-term apprenticeship. As they cling to each other under a single jacket, he and Shizuku both cling to the touchingly juvenile hope that someday, in the far-off future, they will marry each other. Of course, the implication may be that just as Seiji's grandfather lost touch with the young woman he loved as a student in Germany, Seiji's youthful crush will not withstand the test of time and distance. This reflection gains significance as he shouts the final line of dialogue--""Shizuku, I love you!"" Perhaps the reaction we see momentarily on Shizuku's face goes beyond startled or astonished embarrassment. Is she not concerned, alarmed, even pained at the same time?",4,Two flawed versions of a masterpiece,1340496000,"06 24, 2012",2012,6242,"['Many', 'long', 'year', 'passed', 'movie', 'impressed',

Also she is Japanese and her parents and her society put pressure on her to excel.  This movie is a window into what it is like to grow up in Japan.  I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to learn more about life and life in Japan, especially young people.  This movie is also about young romance.

957260,A3F9VH8916IA40,B000CDGVOO,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[12, 30]","I hate to give anything by Ghibli a negative review, trust me it has NEVER happened before, but Whisper of the Heart is hardly as good as any of Ghibli's great films, such asSpirited Away,Grave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition), andMy Neighbor Totoro. The technical aspects of the film are on par with anything Ghibli has done up to this time, and a lot of the same plot devices are present in this film, but Whispers lacks the magic and wonder which made other Ghibli films, including its sequelThe Cat Returns, great.Although Hayao Miyazaki (Howl's Moving Castle,Princess Mononoke) wrote the script and storyboarded for this film, he didn't direct it. It has a lot of the same elements of any Miyazaki film, female lead, a coming of age story, romance, etc. but whereas Miyazaki's films almost always held a universal appeal in that almost anyone could enjoy them Whispers is directed and will appeal to only one group of people, young girls, of which I personally am not. This is a coming of age story about a young middle school girl who, at the start of the film, spends most of her time in a book or fooling around doing absolutely nothing. Her life is turned upside down, however, when she meets a young man named Seiji. She sees that he knows what he wants to do with his life and that he has a purpose for livening, which forces her to examine herself. She realizes that her life, for the most part, is meaningless and sets out on a journey to find herself.Parts of this story are extremely easy to relate with, the overbearing overachieving sister (she was EXACTLY like my own sister), the self doubt, the insecurity, the hopeless search for happiness and meaning in ones life are all emotions which are easy to see in oneself. Unfortunately the movie doesn't focus on these elements as much as they should; instead it decides to turn the story into yet another generic and clich&eacute; tween romance. The story starts out so heartwarming, so beautiful and light, but then takes a nose dive straight into mediocrity. Maybe romance just isn't my thing, but whenever I see middle scholars talk about romance, love, and (cough) getting married when they grow older, I can't help but role my eyes. There is nothing more annoying then tween romances.The animation, like all Ghibli's works, is good for the most part and great in all the right places. The character designs are relatively simple, the motion fluid, and the backgrounds detailed and diverse. One of the closing scenes, when Shizuku and Seiji are together looking at a sunrise, was one of the most beautifully animated scenes for any Ghibli movie ever made. I'm a sucker for a good sunrise scene, and although it didn't match the brilliance of similar scenes from movies likeThe Place Promised in Our Early Days, for the time it was made (1995) its fantastic.Overall if you like tween romances, then go ahead and see this film. Just because I didn't like it (and I'm in the minority here) doesn't mean that you won't, but I warn you do not expect the same wonder and excitement of Miyazaki's films, this is a romance and nothing but.Replay value; moderate.",2,Just Another Tween Romance.,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,3137,"['hate', 'give', 'anything', 'Ghibli', 'negative', 'review', 'NEVER', 'happened', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'hardly', 'as', 'good', 'Ghibli', 'great', 'films', 'such', 'asSpirited', 'Away', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', '2-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'andMy', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'par', 'anything', 'Ghibli', 'done', 'up', 'time', 'lot', 'same', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'present', 'film', 'Whispers', 'magic', 'wonder', 'made', 'other', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'including', 'sequelThe', 'Cat', 'Returns', 'great.Although', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'wrote', 'script', 'storyboarded', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'direct', 'lot', 'same', 'elements', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'female', 'lead', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'romance', 'etc', 'whereas', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'almost', 'always', 'held', 'universal', 'appeal', 'almost', 'anyone', 'could', 'enjoy', 'Whispers', 'directed', 'will', 'appeal', 'only', 'one', 'group', 'people', 'young', 'girls', 'personally', 'am', 'not', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'young', 'middle', 'school', 'girl', 'who', 'start', 'film', 'most', 'time', 'book', 'fooling', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'however', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Seiji', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'purpose', 'livening', 'examine', 'life', 'most', 'part', 'meaningless', 'out', 'journey', 'find', 'herself.Parts', 'story', 'are', 'extremely', 'easy', 'relate', 'overbearing', 'overachieving', 'sister', 'was', 'EXACTLY', 'own', 'sister', 'self', 'doubt', 'insecurity', 'hopeless', 'search', 'happiness', 'meaning', 'ones', 'life', 'are', 'emotions', 'are', 'easy', 'see', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'focus', 'elements', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'instead', 'turn', 'story', 'yet', 'generic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'tween', 'romance', 'story', 'out', 'so', 'heartwarming', 'so', 'beautiful', 'light', 'then', 'nose', 'dive', 'straight', 'mediocrity', 'Maybe', 'romance', 'just', ""n't"", 'thing', 'whenever', 'see', 'middle', 'scholars', 'talk', 'romance', 'love', 'cough', 'getting', 'married', 'when', 'grow', 'older', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'role', 'eyes', 'nothing', 'more', 'annoying', 'then', 'romances.The', 'animation', 'Ghibli', 'works', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'great', 'right', 'places', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'relatively', 'simple', 'motion', 'fluid', 'backgrounds', 'detailed', 'diverse', 'One', 'closing', 'scenes', 'when', 'Shizuku', 'Seiji', 'are', 'together', 'looking', 'sunrise', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'animated', 'scenes', 'Ghibli', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'good', 'sunrise', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'match', 'brilliance', 'similar', 'scenes', 'movies', 'likeThe', 'Place', 'Promised', 'Early', 'Days', 'time', 'was', 'made', '1995', 'fantastic.Overall', 'like', 'tween', 'romances', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'see', 'film', 'Just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', ""'m"", 'minority', 'here', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'warn', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'same', 'wonder', 'excitement', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'romance', 'nothing', 'but.Replay', 'value', 'moderate']",Whisper of the Heart
957261,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B000CDGVOO,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[9, 10]","Yoshifumi Kondo's first and only film for Studio Ghibli (he died a few years after it was completed), WHISPER OF THE HEART, is an absolute delight.  Gentle but not syrupy, this modern-day story about a girl and boy discovering that they have a lot in common is beautifully animated, compellingly characterized, and full of heart (pun intended).Based on a graphic-novel by Aoi Hiragi with a script by Hayao Miyazaki, the movie centers on Shizuku Tsukishima, a spacey yet sympathetic young High School student who would rather read books from the library rather than study for her school tests.  Shizuku discovers that a certain Seiji Amasawa checks out the same books that she does, as detailed on the library checkout cards.  When Shizuku first meets Seiji in person, she thinks he's a ""stupid jerk"" (he makes a somewhat snide remark about her supposedly ""corny"" writing abilities), but she soon discovers that he is a strangely gentle fellow who longs to become a violinist yet feels that his playing isn't as good as others say it is.  Shizuku can relate to this, given that she doubts her talents as a writer.  The story takes a dramatic turn when Shizuku discovers that Seiji will be temporarily leaving for Italy to train as a violinist.  This inspires Shizuku to pursue her own talent, and she proceeds to write her first story.At the surface, this would sound like a rather simple love story, but that's not all WHISPER OF THE HEART has going for it.  Miyazaki's screenplay ingeniously allows the viewers to identify with Shizuku as she expresses the following emotions:  frustration, disappointment, fear, joy, and vulnerability.  This is displayed not only in her growing relationship with Seiji, but with her daily interactions with her friends, family, and her inner thoughts.  We even see Shizuku deal with humiliation (and even guilt) when a boy reveals he had a crush on her all along, yet she only considered him a friend.  Sometimes certain movies can delve a little too much on these angst-ridden elements, but in WHISPER OF THE HEART, this is handled in a way that is not so overbearing (or frustrating even) to the viewer.The film also works in a subplot involving a captivating antique shop containing all kinds of sparkling treasures, including a charming statuette of a cat known as ""Baron"".  The kindly owner, Mr. Nishi, is warm and supportive of Shizuku, especially when she decides to write her story based on the aforementioned ""Baron"" statue. He reminded me of Uncle Pom from CASTLE IN THE SKY, a similarly gentle old man who sadly only showed up for one scene; having this kind of character play an even bigger role in WHISPER is a delight.Speaking of which, the scenes where Shizuku imagines her story are among the movie's most imaginatively animated moments.  The film's artwork, typical of Ghibli, is top notch, but this sequence (one of the studio's first experiments with computer animation) is especially stunning.  Here we see the Baron come alive and escort a fair young maiden (who strangely resembles Shizuku) across a graceful sky of floating islets.  The character of the Baron is quite charismatic and one of the more memorable characters in the film; the only other notable feline we see is a pudgy furball known as Moon (aka Muta), who appears quite grumpy whenever Shizuku tries to talk to him.Incidentally, both of these felines appeared in another Studio Ghibli production, THE CAT RETURNS, a pleasant but merely forgettable family flick considered by many (myself included) as an inferior spin-off.  Not that Hiroyuki Morita's film doesn't have any charm, but WHISPER has something that THE CAT RETURNS didn't have, hence why it holds up better.Interestingly, John Denver's immortal ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" plays a crucial part in the story:  the first half of the movie deals with Shizuku trying to translate the song into Japanese.  This part of the story obviously gave Disney a lot of problems in terms of translation, hence why it was delayed from its English release for quite some time.  Fortunately, their dub handles it in a way that remains true to the original intent, yet at the same time makes it easier for American audiences to connect with.  Here Shizuku tries to write her own lyrics for the song, with each attempt improving as she learns to write from the heart.  This approach works rather well, as I could sense little, if any, lost in the translation.As much as I've heard people criticize Disney for the actors they've chosen to voice the characters in their dubs for Ghibli's works, I have practically enjoyed every one of their voice casts--and, in the case of WHISPER OF THE HEART, I think cynics are going to be very hard-pressed to find any real fault with the performers assembled here.  As the insecure Shizuku, Brittany Snow speaks in a very expressive, believable way without being saccharine, and has an equally lovely singing voice.  David Gallagher--no stranger to voice acting, given his work in KINGDOM HEARTS--provides an excellent contrast to Snow through his understated yet effective turn as Seiji.  Cary Elwes reprises his role as the debonair Baron from THE CAT RETURNS.  The person who takes the prize for best acting in the dub, though, is Harold Gould, who brings just the right amount of warmth, poignancy, and compassion to the kindly Mr. Nishi.I had heard so many wonderful things about WHISPER OF THE HEART, but I never expected to like it as much as I did.  And now that it is available as yet another top-notch dub from Disney (although their DVD extras are a little bit sparse here; good thing the movie looks fantastic though), it pleases me that this film will hopefully discover an even wider audience.  All in all, WHISPER OF THE HEART is a real winner as both a Studio Ghibli film and a Disney revamp, and I highly recommend it.",5,"Absolutely wonderful, ""heart""-felt story, brought to life

It's truly the way true love stories are created and that's at an early age when it is considered as friendship first. Originally made in 95 but the animation is perfect for this type of movie and the voice actors hit the target.

Make no mistake about it, this is a teenage love story, there's very little fantasy and no real action to speak of. It is still a very well told and heartfelt film though, and definitely has Ghibli's impressive storytelling written all over it.The film tends to be pretty slow paced, but actually feels more realistic as a result. It is this sense of realism that is the movies greatest strength I've found. The characters and their behavior, their lives and how they live, and just about everything else has a sense of realism that you don't often get from this genre. So many movies/shows in this genre seem to have some kind of hook, but this film doesn't rely on one. Yeah, you have the minor fantasy sequences, but those aren't really a hook so much as a result of Shizuku's imagination. You'll know what I mean when you view it if you haven't.It's great to see the relationship form, and then to witness how it effects Shizuku's life and how they deal with the hurdles placed before them. This relationship is really the focus of the story, and it only benefits from the sense of realism I mentioned previously.The dub is pretty well done, though Seiji's performances was hit or miss. Overall he did a good job, but there were a few scenes where the delivery was a bit lacking. Cary Elwes pulls off a perfect sounding Baron yet again, even though his role in this film is significantly less than in ""The Cat Returns"". Brittany Snow played a great Shizuku and pulls off the scenes with singing wonderfully; she has a great singing voice. The use of ""Country Roads"" was actually pretty well done I thought, and it didn't feel strange at all; I mean, after watching this film I actually have the song stuck in my head now.Despite the films age I did not feel that it suffered from it. The animation was terrific and the imagery didn't really make it feel dated. The artwork was great and is a testament to Ghibli that they can animate a plain modern city and still manage to impress the audience with the visuals. Their eye for detail is also strongly presented in this film, as you see the characters act or move in a manner that is more realistic, but many other studios wouldn't bother animating. Ghiblis attention to subtle details is one of the things that sets them apart. Seeing these subtleties and movements in a more familiar setting only makes their appearance that much more noticeable.In the end this is yet another Ghibli great. For fans of their more unique films, this might be a bit of a disappointment though. This isn't a fantasy film, or sci-fi, nor does it have any action or a vital life or death plot to it. It's a love story through and through, but it's also a very well told love story with impressive storytelling to back it up.",5,Not your typical Ghibli film,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,2822,"['great', 'somewhat', 'different', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'film', 'Make', 'mistake', 'teenage', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'little', 'fantasy', 'real', 'action', 'speak', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'definitely', 'Ghibli', 'impressive', 'storytelling', 'written', 'it.The', 'film', 'tends', 'be', 'pretty', 'slow', 'paced', 'actually', 'more', 'realistic', 'result', 'sense', 'realism', 'movies', 'greatest', 'strength', ""'ve"", 'found', 'characters', 'behavior', 'lives', 'how', 'live', 'just', 'everything', 'else', 'sense', 'realism', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'genre', 'So', 'many', 'movies/shows', 'genre', 'seem', 'have', 'kind', 'hook', 'film', ""n't"", 'rely', 'one', 'Yeah', 'have', 'minor', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'hook', 'so', 'much', 'result', 'Shizuku', 'imagination', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'view', ""haven't.It"", 'great', 'see', 'relationship', 'form', 'then', 'witness', 'how', 'effects', 'Shizuku', 'life', 'how', 'deal', 'hurdles', 'placed', 'relationship', 'really', 'focus', 'story', 'only', 'benefits', 'sense', 'realism', 'mentioned', 'previously.The', 'dub', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'Seiji', 'performances', 'was', 'hit', 'miss', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'delivery', 'was', 'bit', 'lacking', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'perfect', 'sounding', 'Baron', 'yet', 'again', 'even', 'role', 'film', 'significantly', 'less', 'Cat', 'Returns', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'played', 'great', 'Shizuku', 'off', 'scenes', 'singing', 'wonderfully', 'great', 'singing', 'voice', 'use', 'Country', 'Roads', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'strange', 'mean', 'watching', 'film', 'actually', 'have', 'song', 'stuck', 'head', 'films', 'age', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'suffered', 'animation', 'was', 'terrific', 'imagery', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'feel', 'dated', 'artwork', 'was', 'great', 'testament', 'Ghibli', 'can', 'animate', 'plain', 'modern', 'city', 'still', 'manage', 'impress', 'audience', 'visuals', 'eye', 'detail', 'also', 'strongly', 'presented', 'film', 'see', 'characters', 'act', 'move', 'manner', 'more', 'realistic', 'many', 'other', 'studios', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'animating', 'Ghiblis', 'attention', 'subtle', 'details', 'one', 'things', 'apart', 'Seeing', 'subtleties', 'movements', 'more', 'familiar', 'setting', 'only', 'appearance', 'much', 'more', 'end', 'yet', 'Ghibli', 'great', 'fans', 'more', 'unique', 'films', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointment', ""n't"", 'fantasy', 'film', 'sci-fi', 'have', 'action', 'vital', 'life', 'death', 'plot', 'love', 'story', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'told', 'love', 'story', 'impressive', 'storytelling', 'back', 'up']",Whisper of the Heart
957267,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000CDGVOO,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[14, 15]","Whisper of the Heart is based on a screenplay by Hayao Miyazaki, which he adapted from a comic by Aoi Hragi.  The story focuses on a teenage girl who is to find out about life's difficult journey, as she discovers a mysterious name in a library book.  Nonetheless, it is not a conventional teenage coming of age story that have already been made so many times.The teenage years are the bridge from childhood to adulthood in which the child discovers itself in a process people call coming of age.  Whisper of the Heart is such a story about the young teenage girl Shizuku who does what every good girl is supposes to do -- obey her parents.  Parents often try to steer their children in a well-trodden path where mistakes are minimized and choice are limited as the future is important.  Thus, it is essential that children obey the parent's wishes and desires as they usually have more knowledge and wisdom.One of the demands that the parents put on their children is to study.  In Japan the school system puts a lot of pressure on the teens, as they have to take hard entrance exams right before they enter high school, which means the students who get into high school usually spend the majority of their summer studying for exams.  Shizuku, who is a good girl, does a lot of studying when she does not read books, which is one of her favorite pastimes.Shizuku makes many visits to the library where her father works and she borrows large numbers of books.  Through the old way of keeping the records of who borrowed what book Shizuku discovers the name Amasawa Seiji on more than one of the books that she has borrowed.  This begins an innocent and secretive romance for Shizuku who uses her imagination to create an image for Amasawa.  Despite this beginning, Whisper of the Heart is not a teenage love story, yet love is an important part of the film as it illustrates the complexity of being a teen.When Shizuku does not read she translates and writes her own poetry, carries food to her father at work, and helps out with the house chores.  In the summer heat she even finds time for a little friendship, which is huge element of being a teen.  The ability to socialize with friends is affected by what they do most of the time, which is studying for the entrance exams.  In one of these moments she provides a translation of John Denver's Take Me Home, Country Road of which she has also created in her own Japanese version.  This is an interesting scene as it displays how hard these teens work even when they are relaxing.On one of Shizuku's short ventures with food to her father who is working a stray cat leads her astray.  The cat leads her unintentionally into a small antique shop owned by an old man.  In this store she gets to hear the story of Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, a cat statue, which becomes the foundation for the film Cat Returns (2002).  Shizuku also meets a young teenage boy who dreams of becoming a violinmaker and who dreams of going to Italy to study violinmaking.  Through this teenage boy she learns to look into herself in order to discover what she desires to do with her life.Shizuku sets out on a quest to discover if she has what it takes to become a writer and she drops her studies and focuses solely on writing.  Her older sister becomes irritated over her lack of respect for her parents and her parents are bewildered to see how she is changing.  The film does not simply imply that one should follow ones dreams.  Rather, it takes the notion one step further by applying hard work, dedication, and desire to the idea of following ones dreams.  Thus, it does not become a pretentious teenage film, which often teaches the superficial value of ""follow thy dreams"".  Instead, it provides a realistic perspective on success, as most of it is due to hard work and rarely only dreams and hopes.In this process Shizuku comes of age as she discovers what she wants to do while applying dedication and zealous work ethic to what she loves the most.  Yet, the film is not only about ""follow thy dreams"", it is about so much more.  As mentioned beforehand she falls in love with this mysterious Amasawa, has friendships that go through difficult times, experiences hurt feelings, has looming exams, goes through failure, and deals with whatever else life presents. In essence, Whisper of the Heart is about coming of age while dealing with the ups and downs of life. The film does not focus on one of the moments in life, but rather on the journey through life as Shizuku is acquiring wisdom.Whisper of the Heart is a brilliant animated film by Yoshifumi Kondo who unfortunately passed away in 1998, which makes Whisper of the Heart the only film that he directed.  Kondo worked as an animator on wonderful animated films such as Grave of Fireflies (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992), and Princess Mononoke (1997).  It is sad to know that his visual talent and skill never got to make more flawless cinematic experiences such as Whisper of the Heart, which still has not been released in the United States.  Hopefully, this film will also reach this nation as it has so much to offer in the sense of entertainment, enlightenment, and contemplative bemusement.",5,Animated Masterpiece Finally Comes to the

957269,AIRCASSWQRZDT,B000CDGVOO,Kolwynia,"[1, 1]","Whisper of the Heart is a sweet coming-of-age story about young love and having the courage to follow your heart.  It is a gentle film, at turns sweet, sad, and funny.  I was really charmed by the main character, a dreamer who lives in fairy tales she reads in the library.  Shizuku is just a terrific character, easy to relate to and very likeable.  I love how she's a bit of a slacker, whether at school or at home, but the people in her life are important to her, and she really tries hard to be a good friend.The story is beautiful and romantic, but very down to earth.  There's plenty of slice-of-life stuff here, which I tend to enjoy.  I liked how the Shizuku grew as the story progressed, but didn't lose those qualities that made me love her from the start.  The other characters in the film are enjoyable to watch, especially the boy who Shizuku is starting to like.  But the cast of characters are really only important as they relate to the main character, and her journey in the film.  This is okay, because the story is really only about Shizuku and all their scenes serve to further her story rather than theirs.  (For instance, her best friend is having romantic problems, but all her scenes in the film are only to highlight Shizuku's life and relationships, and there is no real resolution to her friend's story.)  Even so, you never get the feeling that these are not real people, with their own dreams to follow, jobs to do, lives being lived when Shizuku is not around.  The story just doesn't deal with them too much.  But it doesn't need to, because in the end, this is the story of one girl starting to grow up and maybe starting to fall in love.The animation is wonderful, and there is great attention to detail.  Little things stand out, like the way Shizuku tries to turn off her lamp and fumbles around without reaching it until she sits up in bed.  It's the little details that bring the film, and its characters, to life.I really liked the film.  It's a movie for dreamers and romantics.  Shizuku is a great addition to Ghibli's cast of great film heroines.  For those who liked Shizuku's fantasy story scenes, there is a sequel to this movie called The Cat Returns, which follows the Baron (the cat statue in this movie) and a new cast of characters.  It does not have much of a connection to this film, but it is a fun movie in its own right, with more fantastic elements (kind of a girl-in-another-world story).  I recommend both films, but I think that Whisper of the Heart is the more emotionally powerful and inspirational of the two.

957272,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000CDGVOO,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 0]","Whisper of the Heart is a film produced by Studio Ghibli and directed by Yoshifumi Kondo.  It is based on a manga by Aoi Hiiragi.  Whisper of the Heart is a very well-told and well-animated coming of age story.  You really feel for the characters, and you can identify with them and the situations they go through if you've been through adolescence yourself.  Whisper of the Heart is also a good family viewing experience; there's really nothing in the film that is inappropriate for younger viewers.When Whisper of the Heart was released on DVD in the United States, it was released as a two-disc set.  The first disc contains the film and two special features.  For the film, you can select what scenes you want to see.  You can also choose between English and Japanese audio, and you can also choose to have English captions for the Hearing Impaired or to have English subtitles, or to not have subtitles at all.  The main menu also has a ""Sneak Peeks"" option, which allows you to choose which of the trailers you want to see that are included at the beginning of the disc.The first bonus feature on the disc is a roughly eight minute long documentary titled, ""Behind the Microphone.""  During the documentary, you see some of the English voice actors recording the English dialogue for the dub version of the film.  There are also interviews with some of the English dub actors and staff (Brittany Snow, Ashley Tisdale, Ned Lott, Rick Dempsey, David Gallagher, Martin Spanjers, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Jean Smart, Harold Gould, and Cary Elwes).  It's not a bad documentary for what it is.The only other special feature on the disc are the Japanese trailers and TV spots for Whisper of the Heart, which run for about eleven minutes.  There are six in all, and they have Japanese audio and English subtitles.  The spots are in one continuous piece, and there is no way to select which ones you want to see.All that is on the second disc of Whisper of the Heart is a storyboard version of the film.  This is basically the same as the movie, except it utilizes storyboards and none of the actual animation.  I really don't understand the point or appeal of seeing the complete film in storyboard form.  This release would have been stronger if it was just one disc instead of two, and only had brief storyboard-to-animation comparisons of some of the scenes on the first disc.  I believe that including the second disc is a waste.If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli's films, then you should see Whisper of the Heart.  Even with the unnecessary second disc, and the few minor complaints about the bonus features on disc one, this is a DVD that should be in the collection of any anime fan.In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",4,A well-told coming of age story,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,2787,"['Whisper', 'Heart', 'film', 'produced', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'directed', 'Yoshifumi', 'Kondo', 'based', 'manga', 'Aoi', 'Hiiragi', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'very', 'well-told', 'well-animated', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'can', 'identify', 'situations', 'go', ""'ve"", 'been', 'adolescence', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'also', 'good', 'family', 'viewing', 'experience', 'really', 'nothing', 'film', 'inappropriate', 'younger', 'viewers.When', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'released', 'two-disc', 'set', 'first', 'disc', 'film', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'film', 'can', 'select', 'what', 'scenes', 'want', 'see', 'can', 'also', 'choose', 'English', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'can', 'also', 'choose', 'have', 'English', 'captions', 'Hearing', 'Impaired', 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'not', 'have', 'subtitles', 'main', 'menu', 'also', 'Sneak', 'Peeks', 'option', 'choose', 'trailers', 'want', 'see', 'are', 'included', 'beginning', 'disc.The', 'first', 'bonus', 'feature', 'disc', 'roughly', 'eight', 'minute', 'long', 'documentary', 'titled', 'Microphone', 'documentary', 'see', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'recording', 'English', 'dialogue', 'dub', 'version', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'English', 'dub', 'actors', 'staff', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'Ashley', 'Tisdale', 'Ned', 'Lott', 'Rick', 'Dempsey', 'David', 'Gallagher', 'Martin', 'Spanjers', 'Courtney', 'Thorne-Smith', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'Harold', 'Gould', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'not', 'bad', 'documentary', 'what', 'only', 'other', 'special', 'feature', 'disc', 'are', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'run', 'about', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'are', 'six', 'have', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'English', 'subtitles', 'spots', 'are', 'one', 'continuous', 'piece', 'way', 'select', 'ones', 'want', 'see.All', 'second', 'disc', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'storyboard', 'version', 'film', 'basically', 'same', 'movie', 'storyboards', 'none', 'actual', 'animation', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'point', 'appeal', 'seeing', 'complete', 'film', 'storyboard', 'form', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'disc', 'instead', 'two', 'only', 'had', 'brief', 'storyboard-to-animation', 'comparisons', 'scenes', 'first', 'disc', 'believe', 'including', 'second', 'disc', 'waste.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films', 'then', 'should', 'see', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'Even', 'unnecessary', 'second', 'disc', 'few', 'minor', 'complaints', 'bonus', 'disc', 'one', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'anime', 'fan.In', 'order', 'write', 'review', 'checked', 'out', 'copy', 'DVD', 'King', 'County', 'Library', 'System']",Whisper of the Heart

The setting of Whisper Of The Heart (original title: Mimi wo Sumaseba) is a typical Tokyo suburb, and the main protagonists are Suzuka and Seiji, a girl and a boy in junior high school. Suzuka is not quite sure yet what she wants to do with her life, but Seiji on the other hand has already found his lifes work. The themes this movie cover are universal, such as:What does it mean to have, and pursue a dream? What is the use of  education? What does it mean to love someone? And so on.This is a perfect family movie also, for kids over age 10 or so and up. The pace may be a bit too leisurely for younger kids and they may not quite get the themes of ambition, etc as well as older kids might,  though there is plenty of other elements to hold their attention, such as the gorgeous animation and the cheekiest cat imaginable. (There is absolutely nothing in this movie that's 'inappropriate' for young children in any way - just that the themes may be a bit difficult for them.) Adults who remember their teenage years would love this movie also. It made me remember what it was like to be 13 and unsure of myself and what I wanted to 'do with my life', and of hanging out with my friends, and the crushes I had on boys, etc. This movie is particularly great for young girls, since Suzuka, the main character, is one of the most realistically portrayed low-teen girls I've ever seen on screen. Ironic, since she's animated. (I wonder why so many Ghibli movies feature a girl as the main character?)I do hope that Disney doesn't dub this with hyperactive voice actors - the original voices are quite calm and 'normal'.Incidentally, this is a prequel of sorts to The Cat Returns (Neko no Ongaeshi), since a cat statue that appears in Whisper... comes to life so to speak in the more fantasy-oriented The Cat Returns.

957280,A5VI800QMKE8,B000CDGVOO,Mohd Jafar,"[244, 248]","Whisper of the heart is one of the most sensitive, heartwarming and beautiful films ever made. Based on a shojo manga by Aoi Hiiragi, Written and produced by Hayao Miyazaki and directed by Yoshifumi Kondo, whisper of the heart is a tale of self discovery and coming of age of a high school girl Shizuku who is not sure what she wants in life. A series of dramatic events bring her closer to a guy Seiji from her own school. Together they embark on a journey which will help them find their inner potentials, realize their dreams and also love for each other. Also featured in the movie is an old man who runs an antique shop stocked with amazing treasures, including a magnificient porcelain figurine ""the baron"" (also featured in ""The cat returns). Both of these characters play an important role in the film. Though ""The cat returns"" is kind of follow up to ""whisper"" yet for some reason it was released on dvd before ""whisper"".Rarely is a film as honest and realistic as whisper of the heart and that's what makes it amazingly special, charming and successful. Within its thin plot and realistic settings, whisper has its magic moments which are downright uplifting and strike a chord somewhere deep inside. The film itself is a breath of fresh air.Whisper of the heart, though slow in pace, draws you in from the very beginning and refuses to let you go. Its a heartwarming tale which makes you feel nostalgic and helps you relive the adolescence. Except for the Shizuku's dreamy fantasy sequence, the film relies heavily on dialogues and simple and real situations. The locales and the backgrounds shown in the film are as beautiful and breathtaking as in any other ghibli film. Open spaces, beautiful countryside, deep blue sky with summer clouds, a bicycle ride atop the hill, there are numerous things and moments in the film that set the mood just right, leaving the viewer spellbound and satisfied. After a while you forget completely that you are watching an animated film. Music plays an important role in the film and is soft and relaxing though we do get lots of those silent moments too for which ghibli films are famous. Also featured in the film is John Denver's song ""country roads"" which makes the perfect backdrop for the film. Not to mention here, the royalty disputes which arised later, making it difficult for the movie to see an American release.Be it character development, animation or background art of the film, attention to details is simply stunning.The incredibly detailed backgrounds of the fantasy sequences were done by Naohisa Inoue who was an established artist and a long time Miyazaki fan. Impressed by his fantasy work, Miyazaki himself invited him to work on the film. Whisper of the heart dvd released by Buena Vista in Japan includes a special documentary showcasing the dreamy artwork of the film.Director Yoshifumi Kondo had worked on many ghibli films such as Kiki's delivery service, Grave of the fireflies and Pom poko etc, as an animator. Hayao Miyazaki, who was looking for new breed of directors for ghibli, recognised Kondo's talent in no time and gave him a chance to direct this movie. Unfortunately, whisper of the heart remains to be the first and the only film directed by Yoshifumi Kondo. Just after the release of whisper, Kondo succumbed to aneurysm. It is evident from whisper of the heart how immensely talented and sensitive director Kondo was.Films like whisper of the heart are very rare and come once in a lifetime. Watching a film like this is an experience to behold and cherish forever.----Blu-ray RELEASE UPDATE----Whisper of the Heart finally makes it to North America on the stellar format. The film is reported to have received a shiny new digital 1080P remaster for this Blu-ray release which will also feature English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 2.0 Dolby Digital Language Track, Japanese 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Original Production, English and French Subtitles.

957287,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B000CDGVOO,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[7, 8]","Most (if not all) animation fans love anything that comes from Studio Ghibli, that said, this is one of the more obscure titles from the studio. It was story boarded/scripted by Miyazaki himself but actually directed by another talent, Yoshifumi Kondo (who likely would've become Miyazaki's successor had he not passed unexpectedly in 1998 at the age of 47). The animation is gorgeous, though the effort has been put into capturing the reality of a young girl's life in modern day Japan more than in creating an epic world of fantasy one might expect from a Ghibli film. Still, there are a few scenes of imagination that allow for that broader style of animation. Beautiful animation aside this film is a real gem, it's something that is hard to find not just in animated films but in live action or film in general. I anticipate it will shine even brighter on Blu-ray.The charm of this story, like the charm of the animation, is in the realism. This film harkens back to that time in life between childhood and adulthood, the time when you are too old to be a kid but are too young to even be a young adult.The main heroine, Shizuki, is trapped in a world of childhood fantasy, she loves to spend each day reading book after book. The rest of the world is telling her it's time to grow up but all she wants to think about are her stories. When an oddly ordinary looking cat leads her into a real life story of her own she meets a young boy, Seiji, not entirely unlike herself. He is dreaming too, but he is working to make his dreams a reality. His talent creating violins inspires her to become active and put her efforts into becoming a talented writer. As she tries to write her first story she drifts further from schoolwork and other obligations. Conflict comes realistically from her wanting to do what she is passionate about while having school and familial obligations. When she finishes the first draft she isn't sure it's good enough, will she be able to pursue her passion? Has she been wasting her time? Does she have any talent at all?These are doubts every youth can relate to and that's what makes this film so great. No spoilers, but in the end she learns a wonderful lesson about finding your inner talents and developing them into something more. Then there is the forming relationship between her and her new friend, Seiji, which adds a sweet touch to the film overall. It's also nice to see her parents portrayed realistically as concerned but caring. As a matter of fact all the relationships are excellently crafted, including Shizuku's relationship with her older sister and her relationship with her best friend. Each rings incredibly true.This film has an excellent lesson for children and preteens, school doesn't have to get in the way of your passions or interests, it should be used to enhance and strengthen your passions. As difficult as that may seem, especially at the time, it is all about attitude. In a world where every youth oriented show finds the main characters being rich, being pop stars, being television stars, being wizards, going to expensive boarding schools, and generally having unbelievable lives of fun with little adult supervision, it is nice to have this film. A film that depicts realism and does it all with beautiful animation and a wonderfully crafted, but simple, story. This is the kind of story we haven't seen since before preteens were tapped as a profitable market. As such, it may be too simple for the preteens of today (I still suggest they view it) but it will certainly be adored by young children and will provide nostalgia for adults who remember simpler times, before preteens were thought of as major consumers. This film is especially recommended for Ghibli fans or animation enthusiasts.The sound design is terrific in this film and as with all Disney/Ghibli dubs this is top of the line. You have the Japanese track if you prefer it but the English dub here is superb and perfectly casted, Brittany Snow, David Gallagher, Ashley Tisdale, Cary Elwes, Jean Smart, all do excellent work.I'm very pleased more Ghibli films are finally coming to Blu-ray in the U.S. I've been waiting for a long while for news on Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, but never did I expect this would be one of the first titles to make the jump to HD. Since it's listed with Castle in the Sky and Arietty, I can only assume Disney is putting it out as a more obscure title hoping fans of those more prominent titles will pick it up at the same time, and I suggest they do. It makes sense if this comes out right alongside Arrietty as both are simpler stories about a young girl coming to terms with the world, and many parents took their children to see Arrietty. That seems to be the marketing decision behind it. Either way I'm not complaining, quite the opposite. I'm so glad this film is coming to blu-ray and hope many more Ghibli titles follow closely behind.Pick this 5 star film up with Castle in the Sky and Arrietty.",5,A special gem of an animated

Whisper of the Heart takes place after the development is completed and the area populated.Since most Ghibli films take place in beautiful countryside, the studio wanted to make a film that urban and suburban  children could relate to directly. So, they applied their luscious style to the Tama area. One thing I've always found appealing about Ghibli films is the gorgeous backgrounds.

957298,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000CDGVOO,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[8, 10]","One of the lesser-known Studio Ghibli productions, ""Whisper Of The Heart"" is also one of the most brilliant gems in a Ghibli crown that seems to be studded with nothing but brilliant gems.  It begins with two simple premises - 1) during summer vacation a book-loving girl named Shizuki discovers that the same person - a reader named Seiji - is also listed on the library cards of most of the fable-books she checks out as having checked them out also, and 2) during the simple act of taking a train to deliver her father the lunch he's forgotten to take to work, Shizuki is uncannily intrigued by a distinct cat riding the bus and decides on a whim to follow the cat off the train and see where he goes.  From these two beginnings the movie and its phenomenal cast of characters branch off in a myriad of directions.  Both hilarious in a way few live-action comedies can match and incredibly moving on a level few live-action dramas can ascend to, ""Whisper Of The Heart"" is also, undoubtedly, one of the most gorgeously romantic tales ever told.  The closest comparison, in non-animated terms, might be to imagine ""The Notebook"" crossed with ""Serendipity"" but with certain elements toned down to open the movie up for younger viewers as well as older ones.  In the transition it loses not one whit of its power, enchantment, or depth.It's also about a lot of other things.  It's about insecurity vs. taking the plunge.  It's about a quaint old antique shop and its owner and patrons.  It's about a striking statue of a bipedal, nattily-attired cat whose gem eyes catch and refact the sunlight in a mesmerizing way, in that shop.  It's about the value of story, it's about impromptu musical singalongs, it's about dreams vs. societal expectations, and more further tangents than can be listed here, all coming together in one extraordinary package.

957299,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B000CDGVOO,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 3]","Who is Whisper of the Heart aimed at? It's animated, so it must be for children? The lead characters are young teens and there's a strong romantic element, so is it aimed at teens? I'm a 51-year-old man who doesn't have any children, but I love every minute of this film.If you are a fan of Studio Ghibli, you'll know that Hayao Miyazaki has directed most of the studio's work. Yoshifumi Kondo directed this time, but Miyazaki wrote the screenplay, and his influence can be felt rather than seen. Whisper of the Heart is set in the real world and only contains the tiniest of fantasy references. It's a coming-of-age tale that just about everyone can identify with. Even if you are not a child, a teen, or a parent, you will remember living through similar moments to those depicted in this story.Shizuku is a 14-year-old girl who focuses most of her attention on school, reading, and studying. One day, she notices that almost every book she borrows from the library has previously been checked out by Seiji Amasawa. She becomes curious about him, and wonders how someone could have such similar tastes to her own. At school, she's a good student, and goes through the typical things that most young girls experience. She talks to her girlfriends about boys, but writing is her real passion. She impresses her friends by writing song lyrics.Her life changes when she encounters a cat on the train, and she follows it after it gets off at her stop. It leads her to an antiques store, owned by an old man. The man turns out to be the grandfather of the mysterious Seiji, and the two finally meet.Although Shizuki studies hard, she has little idea of what she wants to do with her life. Seiji and his grandfather provide the inspiration she has been lacking, and she soon realizes that her true passion in life is writing. Seiji's passion is making violins, and the old man spends his time restoring antiques. This new focus means that her studies start to suffer, and she has to decide whether her writing is more important to her.That sounds like a boring story, but it's nothing of the sort. There are no villains, no explosions, and not a lot of humor, but it's a sweet story with real characters that are easy to like and care about. You might find yourself remembering key moments in your own childhood, or perhaps wondering how different your life would have been if you had chosen a different path.The film includes well-developed relationships with friends, parents, and siblings. Shizuku's parents are supportive, but realistic about their daughter's choices. There's a lot of respect present in her relationships with family, and the other people in her life. In typical Studio Ghibli fashion, Miyazaki's script includes many instances where characters stop and reflect on their actions. The animation includes little touches which add to the realism. For example, how many animated movies take the time to show someone using a vacuum cleaner?The story is so realistic that I could imagine it having a positive influence on young teens or even parents. The messages are all positive, and they fit well with the story. My favorite Studio Ghibli films do include strong fantasy elements, but Whisper of the Heart is close to perfect while remaining firmly in the real world. These events could actually happen. It reminds me that Miyazaki must be a keen observer of human nature.I've seen the film several times, and it always reaches me emotionally. The themes are simple and universal. I urge you to give it a try, even if you think that the genre isn't something you would normally enjoy. It's one for the whole family. If you do end up loving Whisper of the Heart, one of the characters also appears in The Cat Returns, and that's well worth your time as well.The Blu-ray presentation is pleasing, but don't expect the film to look like something from Pixar.

They give me the memory of my high school days when I sang the song in English.Shizuku Tsukishima of this story does the amazing. She makes the Japanese language version of the song at the age of 14! (Miyazaki-san is also involved in the Japanese lyrics). Other than that she is ordinary but bit like Anne Shirley of the Anne of the Green Gables. She is a bookworm just like my elder sister. She likes borrowing books on fantasy novels. With Miyazaki/Kondo combination ordinary suburban Tokyo life was made much vivid and real. Characters' conversation is often interrupted by the rushing autos. Sounds so real. Violin featured Country Road is really nice. I just hope I want to explore the inside story written by Shizuku Tsukishima much further. Maybe you can enjoy the sequel? of that Shizuku's story at THE CAT RETURNS movie. Cat figurine BARON and drifting cat MOON(MUTA)also make the movie special. Miyazaki's brilliant scene cuts shines even at suburban Tokyo and the last sunrise scene is excellently described. Yeah Miyazaki and Kondo tell us we can find a little bit of fantasy in urban life.

Of course, going by the fact that it was Studio Ghibli that did both films and its high ratings, I picked up Whisper of the Heart. I wasn't expecting a fantasy adventure, but I was expecting something... more. As others have said on here, there seemed to be a lot of filler and the movie felt long. I kept wondering to myself, 'when is this movie finally going to be over?' It's not the subject matter. I've watched The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and it has a similar theme of a schoolgirl who is confused about her feelings and has to sort them out, and I love that movie. Something about this one just didn't grab me. I didn't care too much about the characters.

957303,A4NXA2IJNE10H,B000CDGVOO,"Tetsu Uma ""The 'Iron Horse'""","[1, 2]","Set in the suburbs of Tokyo, ""Whisper of the Heart"" is a story of finding ones place in the real world and of finding one's first true love.  The teenage main character, Shizuku, wants to be a writer and is seeking her place in the world.  While she is a voracious reader, she reads only fantasy which tends to skew her world view.  After meeting a hansome boy, Seiji, who both infuriates and intrigues her, Shizuku sets a personal goal.  Because Seiji knows he wants to study violin making in Italy and is going there for a short apprenticeship to see if he has the skills, Shizuku sets a goal of writing a story by the time he returns in order to know conclusively if she should be a writer.  During the course of Whisper of the Heart, she learns that life and love is not as easy as in a storybook but that with hard work, one may find true love and happiness in real life as well as in stories.  A subplot is Shizuku's relationship with Seiji's Grandfather who serves as the voice of wisdom and experience.  He teaches her that many beautiful things are hidden and may only be exposed with hard work.  He also teaches that life does not always give a happy ending.Other than the scene showing Shizuku's writing, the story has none of the strange characters, magic, or fantastic settings of other Studio Ghibli U.S. releases.  (In my opinion, some of their best real-life style stories such as ""Omoide Poro Poro"" do not translate well into American culture or the American market.)  The animation is fantastic, which I attribute to the detail Studio Ghibli includes.  This is the film which gave rise to ""The Cat's Return"" and several of the characters are found in both (the Baron, Muuta).Regardless of the subject matter, I was easily caught up in the story and found it quite compelling.  My wife and I often set the language to Japanese with subtitles (my Japanese is abysmal) and as we found with ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" the translation of the Japanese dialog is better than what was written for the English version.  Those with some knowledge of Japanese culture will notice some other facets of that culture which underlie the story.  These include studying for the High School admission tests and the ""Goodbyes"" of long-time classmates following junior high school.

957304,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B000CDGVOO,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[3, 4]","Ok first off if you are after a faced paced action packed white knuckles thrill ride viewing experience this is NOT your kind of movie.  For the most part this movie offers its viewers what is for the most part an amazingly accurate picture of what it is like to be a family in Japan.  The movie treats you as if you are a silent onlooker as this young ladies life unfolds before you.  There are few if any fast cuts and action sequences designed to fast forward you into a basic understanding of what motivates the characters.  Great time and effort was taken to allow the complexities of each character to unfold before you.  As the movie played on I actually had the sense that I was being allowed to get to know each character.  Another thing that makes this movie special is each character was crafted with amazing subtelty and attention to detail making feel real.  The attention to detail and slow pace of character development in Whisper of the Heart made me want to invest myself in loving each character for the unique perspectives, joys and pains and insights they brought to the overall work. This is not the movie for someone who needs an action sequence every 4 minutes to stay interested and connected to the movie.  This movie is for someone who enjoys people, love and the most awesome cultural aspects of Japan.I was impressed also with the quality of the animation.  The sheens on the wood surfaces as light shines on them in rooms was awesome.  The attention to detail in the look and feel of the fathers library workplace was astounding.  As the young lady decended the stairs I could almost the crisp air heavy with the unique smell books have when collected together.  The train stations and appropriate signage were also well detailed. True attention to detail during animation can be seen by looking out of the windows as the train goes from place to place.  The scenery changes, the support poles for the trains electric power lines pass by as expected.  It is not the same three to seven buildings passing by in cheap animation seen on the Flintstones and Jetsons for example.This is a love story between a adulescent young man and woman both on track to enter high school in Japan.  I will say nothing more about the plot because; I do not want to spoil it for others.  This is an awesome movie.  It is slow in pace but if you care about cultural details and want to get a sense of what life in Japan is like this is a great beginning on your journey toward understanding and human enlightenment.  There is One VERY unrealistic plot point in this movie I feel compelled to point out.  At one point the high school aged young lady flirts with the idea of not entering or completing high school.  Her grades drop off to a point that is totally worrisome and her parents eventually become very mellow and supportive of her plans.  Unfortunately most typical parents in Japan do not reach with passive love when their childs grades fall and they express a desire not to continue school.  In Japan the entire culture is geared to seek perfection in all things.

957307,AAGLJJ0OUBO8V,B000CDGVOO,Tim,"[0, 0]","Yes, this is by far my favorite Studio Ghibli title. ""Better than the works of Miyazaki? Blasphemy!"" I hear you cry, but in this story I find more to emotionally connect to than any other Ghibli film.The plot follows a girl named Shizuku. She's an avid reader and often picks up books from the library. One day she begins to notice a trend in her books though, they've all been previously checked out by the same person: 'Seiji Amasawa'. Later she meets a young man who annoys her to no end... and well, you can probably see where the plot's going from here. What makes it interesting though is the storytelling device of... well, stories. To put it simply Shizuku is a girl who doesn't know where she's going in her life, what she wants to do when she grows up. Through the process of meeting the young man and his grandfather, she ends up thinking about stories and one she would like to tell based off a cat figurine in Seiji's grandfather's house.(The figurine, called the Barron would become so popular in Japan that he would get his own spinoff movie called The Cat Returns. It's much more in line with Ghibli's usual magical world type films).Unlike Ghibli's other titles, Whisper of the Heart is a pure, unadulterated coming-of-age story. No gimmicks, very little embellishment, and very little in terms of flights of fancy. There is no magic creatures in this one that will change the lives of the characters. Any magic that comes about is made by the character's own thoughts and imagination. If I was to compare it to another of their movies I would have to say Grave of Fireflies... though nowhere near as depressing.Despite its G rating, I don't honestly think this is a kid's movie. There's nothing really objectionable in it, I just doubt it would hold their interest. It's a slow paced and thoughtful movie. This seems to be a film made for young adults, people who are almost finished with Highschool or going off to college. It's a movie about deciding what you want to do with your life, and where you will go. That's not to say that you won't enjoy it if that's not where you are in your life, far from it. It just seems like it would have more emotional resonance with that group.Sadly, this was the only film directed by Yoshifumi Kondo who died only a few years after the film was completed. After watching this, I can only wonder what he would have gone on to do if he would have had more time.From a technical standpoint this blu-ray is beautiful. While it is not the most colorful animated film, containing very few flashy scenes and a rather minimal color palate, it comes off looking something like a spring day.

Master Hayao Miyazaki with Yoshifumi Kondo direction, you see how real this animation is about the life of a girl name Shizuku. I won't go into too much detail as others here have already provided more than enough information on this outstanding gem like all of Miyazaki's animated production films. I just like to point out that the ending could of been more heartfelt than it was in my opinion. For those who haven't seen this movie yet...stop here and go rent this for the whole family to enjoy.** spoiler **The scene where Shizuku's dad tuck the blanket over her in bed than showing the night sky as it fade to the credits would of been a sad but worthy ending. It's more realistic and acceptable then to have Seiji show up at her place early in the cold morning on his bicycle from out of nowhere and ask her to come ride with him to somewhere is a bit odd when he should be in Italy learning to become a master violin builder. Now here is where it got a little wierd...the ending where he basically propose to her to marry him after taking her on top of this hill to see the sun rise. I mean how many guys would ask a girl to marry him when they haven't even gone out yet?!? Then again, maybe that happens more than not in Japan but not really here.

Films that don't play to the lowest common denominator of esthetics and attention span, without shallow sentimentality or arrogant brutality, without the requisite nihilism of postmodern sophistry. This movie is the antidote to all that, and it came from one cluster of brave people who live in Japan: the Ghibli studio.  Be forewarned, once you taste the real thing - and Whisper of the Heart is a prime example - you may not be able to go back to the schlock that Hollywood dishes out.  Which will pretty much keep you out of the cinema in the U.S.  Sadly, the total output of Miyazaki and Ghibli is maybe a dozen films, not all yet translated to English  - but at least they HAVE made the magnificent films they have.I put this film in the top 10 of any cinema I've ever seen. Story, music, design, every aspect is just right, an absolute work of Art. As with all Ghibli productions, in the first 5 minutes you'll forget it's animated.

After the first half an hour, we seriously considered turning this movie off.  Only the hope that it might get better, given time, kept us watching.  I rather wish we hadn't bothered.  This movie did not get better.  We remained bored throughout, and I actually laughed when the end credits rolled because it all just seemed so meaningless and I couldn't believe that I'd wasted my time with this film.  It was like watching paint dry, really.  Very pretty to look at, but totally lacking in any real substance or depth at all.I can't help thinking that the principal problem with this movie is that it was targeted at a very specific audience:  namely, young girls.  Neither my husband, or I, were at all drawn into the conflicts of Shizuku as she struggles to deal with such yawn-inducing (for us) ""conflicts"" as love (more like puppy-love, actually) and the uncertainty of what she wants to do with her life.I was bitterly disappointed by this movie because I thought that the description of it was extremely misleading.  I was expecting a fairy-tale like journey, much akin to the likes of Spirited Away, but ""a chance meeting with a mysterious cat"" turned out to be anything but.  In fact, it really is just some chance meeting with a stray cat, which Shizuku follows. It's all really boring, once you realize it really is just a stray cat that she's randomly decided to follow.  I got even more annoyed when Shizuku started trying to talk to the cat (and later, certain inanimate objects) because it seemed really boring and silly once I realized they weren't going to answer her back.  And it wasn't like anything she had to say to them was all that interesting(well, I certainly wasn't very interested.)There were also a lot of sub-plots that seemed to just go nowhere.  Like the one where the main character is working on some song for the upcoming graduation---we never see the graduation event itself, (because it doesn't even occur during the timeline of the story) or find out whether the song was a success or how it worked out.  Furthermore, the main storyline itself wasn't particularly interesting.  I really struggled to sympathize with Shizuku's attempts to write a story, because we're not actually told what the story is about.All in all, Whisper of the Heart felt like a ""slice of life"".  We got to watch Shizuku as she begins to try to find a direction in life, but in the end, I was left feeling like I'd just not been shown enough to feel like the movie had a worthwhile or meaningful ending.  Unfortunately, I was so bored by the end, I was rather pleased that it was over.As I've said earlier in the review, this movie is definitely aimed at a very specific audience.  It didn't appeal to my husband and I, and I do wonder whether it would appeal to the very young, either.  Not really very much happens in it, and I think younger viewers would be bored.  We get to watch Shizuku eat dinner, do chores, walk to school and attend class... hardly gripping viewing!  I also felt that the ""love interest"" was handled very badly and the characters didn't seem very consistent.In conclusion:  Watch Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away or The Secret World of Arietty.  Don't watch this.  It is boring and I think many viewers (not of the intended age group) will be very let down by it.",1,Yawn of the Heart,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,3527,"['husband', 'are', 'fans', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'were', 'looking', 'forwards', 'watching', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'expecting', 'be', 'equally', 'enjoyable.Sadly', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'hour', 'seriously', 'considered', 'turning', 'movie', 'off', 'Only', 'hope', 'might', 'get', 'better', 'given', 'time', 'kept', 'watching', 'rather', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'better', 'remained', 'bored', 'actually', 'laughed', 'when', 'end', 'credits', 'rolled', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'meaningless', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'d"", 'wasted', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'really', 'Very', 'pretty', 'look', 'totally', 'lacking', 'real', 'substance', 'depth', 'all.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'principal', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'targeted', 'very', 'specific', 'audience', 'namely', 'young', 'girls', 'husband', 'were', 'drawn', 'conflicts', 'Shizuku', 'deal', 'such', 'yawn-inducing', 'conflicts', 'love', 'more', 'puppy-love', 'actually', 'uncertainty', 'what', 'do', 'life.I', 'was', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'thought', 'description', 'was', 'extremely', 'misleading', 'was', 'expecting', 'fairy-tale', 'journey', 'much', 'akin', 'likes', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'chance', 'meeting', 'mysterious', 'cat', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'anything', 'fact', 'really', 'just', 'chance', 'meeting', 'stray', 'cat', 'Shizuku', 'really', 'boring', 'once', 'realize', 'really', 'just', 'stray', 'cat', 'randomly', 'decided', 'follow', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'annoyed', 'when', 'Shizuku', 'started', 'trying', 'talk', 'cat', 'later', 'certain', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'seemed', 'really', 'boring', 'silly', 'once', 'realized', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'answer', 'back', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'had', 'say', 'was', 'interesting', 'well', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'interested', 'were', 'also', 'lot', 'sub-plots', 'seemed', 'just', 'go', 'nowhere', 'one', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'working', 'song', 'upcoming', 'graduation', '-we', 'never', 'see', 'graduation', 'event', ""n't"", 'even', 'occur', 'timeline', 'story', 'find', 'out', 'song', 'was', 'success', 'how', 'worked', 'out', 'Furthermore', 'main', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'interesting', 'really', 'struggled', 'sympathize', 'Shizuku', 'attempts', 'write', 'story', ""'re"", 'not', 'actually', 'told', 'what', 'story', 'about.All', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'felt', 'slice', 'life', 'got', 'watch', 'Shizuku', 'try', 'find', 'direction', 'life', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'just', 'not', 'been', 'shown', 'enough', 'feel', 'movie', 'had', 'worthwhile', 'meaningful', 'ending', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'end', 'was', 'rather', 'pleased', 'was', 'over.As', ""'ve"", 'said', 'earlier', 'review', 'movie', 'definitely', 'aimed', 'very', 'specific', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'husband', 'do', 'wonder', 'would', 'appeal', 'very', 'young', 'either', 'Not', 'really', 'very', 'much', 'happens', 'think', 'younger', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'bored', 'get', 'watch', 'Shizuku', 'eat', 'dinner', 'do', 'chores', 'walk', 'school', 'attend', 'class', 'hardly', 'gripping', 'viewing', 'also', 'felt', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'badly', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'consistent.In', 'conclusion', 'Watch', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arietty', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'boring', 'think', 'many', 'viewers', 'not', 'intended', 'age', 'group', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'let', 'down']",Whisper of the Heart
957315,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000CDGVOO,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Directed by the late Yoshifumi Kondo (screenplay and storyboards by the acclaimed filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki), ""Whisper of the Heart"" is one of those films that capture so many things - the pangs of growing up, adolescent angst, finding one's place in the world, and following that inner voice within one's own heart.The setting is Tokyo - teenager Shizuku Tsukishima is a bookish girl who'd rather while away the hours buried in a book than study her school books. Shizuku feels there's something missing in her life and a chance encounter with an indifferent yet strangely captivating cat on a train one day changes the course of her life. Shizuku follows the cat to an old antique store, where she is captivated by the statue of a mysterious cat (the Baron, who made a lasting impression on fans inThe Cat Returns). Later, Shizuku discovers that the store is owned by an old man who happens to be the grandfather of Seiji Amasawa, the very young man whose name had been on the library cards of many of the books Shijuku's been checking out.A gentle friendship develops between the two teenagers, one that baffles and delights Shizuku. Her lack of confidence in herself makes her question the balance in this friendship as she thinks very highly of Seiji's talents as a budding violin maker, whereas she thinks she has nothing much to offer in return. She just writes song lyrics and wastes time reading fairy tales, pursuits she deems worthless. It takes a while, but Shizuku does finally find her true calling, and the statue of the Baron serves as an inspiration towards this end.I loved the way the story took its time to unfold. Nothing felt rushed or plodding - this is one of those movies that I would watch again on a leisurely weekend afternoon, and reflect upon my younger days. It is such a sweet, if a tad melodramatic, coming of age story that is sure to warm anyone's heart. Note: The picture quality is crisp and clear. There are scenes of Shizuku's father smoking, and minor language (in some earlier scenes, Shizuku calls Seiji ""stupid jerk"" several times, and also uses the term ""idiot"", but that's it).",5,"A gentle and sweet coming of age story, the animation is gorgeous!",1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,2121,"['Directed', 'late', 'Yoshifumi', 'Kondo', 'screenplay', 'storyboards', 'acclaimed', 'filmmaker', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Whisper', 'Heart', 'one', 'films', 'capture', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'pangs', 'growing', 'up', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'finding', 'one', 'place', 'world', 'following', 'inner', 'voice', 'one', 'own', 'heart.The', 'setting', 'Tokyo', 'teenager', 'Shizuku', 'Tsukishima', 'bookish', 'girl', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'away', 'hours', 'buried', 'book', 'study', 'school', 'books', 'Shizuku', 'something', 'missing', 'life', 'chance', 'encounter', 'indifferent', 'yet', 'strangely', 'captivating', 'cat', 'train', 'one', 'day', 'course', 'life', 'Shizuku', 'cat', 'old', 'antique', 'store', 'where', 'captivated', 'statue', 'mysterious', 'cat', 'Baron', 'who', 'made', 'lasting', 'impression', 'fans', 'inThe', 'Cat', 'Returns', 'Later', 'Shizuku', 'store', 'owned', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'grandfather', 'Seiji', 'Amasawa', 'very', 'young', 'man', 'name', 'had', 'been', 'library', 'cards', 'many', 'books', 'Shijuku', 'been', 'checking', 'out.A', 'gentle', 'friendship', 'two', 'teenagers', 'one', 'delights', 'Shizuku', 'lack', 'confidence', 'herself', 'question', 'balance', 'friendship', 'very', 'highly', 'Seiji', 'talents', 'budding', 'violin', 'maker', 'nothing', 'much', 'offer', 'return', 'just', 'song', 'lyrics', 'wastes', 'time', 'reading', 'fairy', 'tales', 'worthless', 'while', 'Shizuku', 'finally', 'find', 'true', 'calling', 'statue', 'Baron', 'inspiration', 'end.I', 'loved', 'way', 'story', 'took', 'time', 'unfold', 'Nothing', 'felt', 'rushed', 'plodding', 'one', 'movies', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'leisurely', 'weekend', 'afternoon', 'reflect', 'younger', 'days', 'such', 'sweet', 'tad', 'melodramatic', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'sure', 'warm', 'anyone', 'heart', 'Note', 'picture', 'quality', 'crisp', 'clear', 'are', 'scenes', 'Shizuku', 'father', 'smoking', 'minor', 'language', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'Shizuku', 'Seiji', 'stupid', 'jerk', 'several', 'times', 'also', 'term', 'idiot']",Whisper of the Heart
