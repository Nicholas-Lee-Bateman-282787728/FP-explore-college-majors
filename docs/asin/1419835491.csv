I think this series is a television classic that ranks alongside Hill Street Blues. This series has one of America's finest writers - Aaron Sorkin. It also has one of the finest ensemble casts that I have ever seen in any broadcast medium. And a sense of humor, optimism, hope and whimsy that I find deeply moving.One of the morals is that doing the right thing and having the courage of your convictions is far harder than taking the easier politically convenient route. A lesson that we should all learn. What's also amazing is how the show preempts so many of the issues we're grappling now - Privacy and Terrorism being two examples.Seasons 1-4 are absolutely fantastic. Seasons 5-7 is a definite drop-in quality, mostly due to Aaron Sorkin's absence. Many characters actions aren't consistent with how they'd been previously established. Will Bailey was a great speechwriter, not a political operative. Toby betraying the President? CJ as Chief of Staff? And why wasn't Leo promoted to VP? Nevertheless these seasons are still watchable - providing you accept it's John Wells ""ER-in-the-West-Wing"".Seasons 1-4 at least, are classic television. and if you love intelligent, literate television which respects the intelligence of the viewer - then please buy this Collection.

I get frustrated trying to describe it, because I really can't.  But I'll try.  In a most literal sense, you do have to see it to believe it.First off, I can't think of a single casting mistake in this series.  Everyone personifies their characters and they portray the life in the West Wing with precision that can be best described as genius.  I won't even try to list all of them, but I MUST mention the beloved, late John Spencer's last performance as the no-nonsense Chief of Staff Leo McGarry.  Once again, you must see him to believe him, but if this show was eligable for Oscars, he would win a Best Supporting Actor every year the show was running.The script is brilliant.  Original writer Aaron Sorkin left after Season 4, but the great writing continued.  Each episode makes me: 1) Think about the current state of the government and what we could do to improve it, 2)Laugh out loud more than once, and 3) Move me and inspire me to a point that no other show/movie can.  While I watch these episodes they invoke every feeling in me, from laughter to sadness.For all Republicans that won't watch the show because of the liberal position of Bartlett and his staff, I say this: I'm a Republican and I adore this show.  This whole matter can be summed up in a quote from director/producer Thomas Schelamme: ""Democrats come up to me and say 'we love your politics and your show'.  Republicans come up to me and say 'we hate your politics, but we love your show anyway'.""The score by Snuffy Walden is beautiful and memorable.  The supporting characters are well-drawn out and well-acted.  The show has many good messages as well; all of the characters love and care for each other, they are all patriots who sacrifice for the well-being of the country, and when they screw up, they apologize.Some of the best episodes are:Debate CampGalileoShibbolethPilotBatlet's Third State of UnionInauguration: Over ThereIn Excelsis DeoNoelBartlet for AmericaTwo CathederalsPosse ComitatousThe SupremesFull DisclosureI'll stop writing now, as you've probably read enough.

176022,A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M,1419835491,"Ax20 ""Ax20""","[0, 0]","I've made a long list of shows that I want to watch from beginning to end (some that I have seen before, some that I have heard are excellent but have missed for some reason) and the first on this long list is The West Wing. Somehow, I completely missed this show while it was on. To be fair, I wasn't even in high school when it started. but now that I've finally gotten the chance, I know what I was missing out on.The West Wing follows President Jed Bartlet and his staff as they navigate the politics, drama, and disasters that happen when you run a country. Though the politics plays an enormous part of the show, the characters are what truly makes it great.Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen)- The principled, ever hopeful and all but unstoppable president. Most of the time the president is astounding us by his unshakeable faith in mankind and America, but meanwhile, he was keeping an enormous secret from the American people: he had remitting relapsing multiple sclerosis. His illness adds another layer to an already inspiring and complex person. His wife, Abigail, who helped him cover up his illness thanks to her doctor credentials, is an essential part of his character. She is strong and opinionated (played by Stockard Channing).Leo McGarry (Josh Spencer)- the chief of staff (and later democratic nominee for vice president) and the moral center of the show when the president could not be. One of McGarry's struggles throughout the show was his alcoholism and later, his health issues. [Spoiler: Spencer died in the middle of the final season and the show did an excellent job of handling his death tastefully and emotionally.]CJ Cregg (Allison Janney)- originally press secretary and later chief of staff, Cregg was easily one of my favorite characters on the show. Maybe it was her quick wit or her unshakability despite everything she had to deal with (being kept in the dark before briefing the press, the president's illness, multiple security leaks, etc). Her biggest personal trials included her father's alzheimer's and her romantic life.Toby Ziegler (Richard Schiff)- Communications director and perhaps one of my least favorite characters on the show. I think I disliked him for the same reason his ex-wife did: he was too sad all the time. He was very sweet with his twins and seeing him coached by Kristin Chenowith to be the new press secretary when Cregg becomes chief of staff was pretty funny, but that's about it.Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford)- Deputy Chief of Staff for Bartlet and later Campaign Manager and Chief of staff for the next president, Josh was the cocky sort of ladies man. I say sort of because he didn't really seem to quite know what to do with the women who were attracted to him. (One particularly fun relationship was between him and Mary Louise Parker's character, Amy Gardner, though we always knew he would end up with longtime secretary Donna Moss.) despite his arrogance, he's a fighter and does not easily give up. He fought an uphill battle to secure Matthew Santos the next presidency.Donna Moss (Janel Maloney)- originally senior assistant to Josh, she later becomes a spokesperson and then chief of staff to the first lady. Donna is another enjoyable character on the show. Donna's main story lines revolve around her interactions with Josh but she's always been able to hold her own against his craziness.Charlie Young (Dule Hill)- he starts off as the personal aide to the president but ultimately becomes deputy special assistant to CJ when she is chief of staff. Charlie's mother was a police officer killed in the line of duty and gets a job to help care for his sister. One of his biggest plots revolves around his relationship with the president's youngest daughter Zoe which leads to hate mail and an assassination attempt. he is another one of my favorites.Some other excellent actors, who were not in the show for the full duration, include Rob Lowe, Joshua Malina, Mary McCormack, Kristin Chenoweth, Jimmy Smits, Alan Alda, Emily Procter, Janeanne Garofolo, Matthew Perry, Lisa Edelstein, Marlee Maitlin, and Mark Fuerstein. The list is long and the amount of people we must deal with and remember is even longer. Where this normally bothers me in any other show, I didn't mind the large cast here. It made it more believable because these were real positions that would be filled in a real White House, rather than combining people for simplicity's sake. Plus, anyone who has every become anyone seems to have been on the show at one point or another.As the show tried to transition out of the Bartlet presidency and into the next president, the show seemed to lose some steam. It was split between the current president and the presidential campaign, which meant dividing our attention between the cast we had come to love and all the candidates for president plus their campaign staffs. But though at first this was annoying, the new characters grew on me and eventually I found myself really liking Matt Santos and his wife Helen and truly caring about the outcome of the election that had originally felt like a distraction.The West Wing ended up being one of my favorite shows that I have seen in a long time. I can only hope they make another show like this sometime soon.",5,I Never Thought I Could Enjoy Politics So Much,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,5247,"[""'ve"", 'made', 'long', 'list', 'shows', 'want',

176023,A25SCMROF2X6HQ,1419835491,"Barrie Bracken ""scholar""","[1, 1]","All reviews are subjective, and this is no exception.  You will be told my impressions of this item as I am qualified.  There will be no discussion of cinematography, direction or acting.  The reviewer is unqualified.What is the value of this series of shows?  They present the American presidency in the following aspects:1) We see the everyday burdens of the president and his staff in dealing with Congress, the cabinet, varied constituents, donors, lobbyists and enemies.2) We gain an appreciation of the media reporting from the White House and how for security reasons and political reasons some information must be withheld from the public.3) We feel the terror when the president&#8217;s entourage is attacked by a group of gunmen who are fanatically opposed to the president&#8217;s daughter dating a black aide.4) When this daughter is abducted by radicals the pressures to protect his own family from political foes is exemplified.5) When the president must make public his multiple sclerosis to the voters before his nomination for a second term, we can appreciate the frustrations of a life dedicated to a cause which may be cut short by illness.The acting is good as is the plot.  Some costars are added toward the end of the series, Alan Alda and Jimmy Smitts, and these perform wonderfully.  I admit a certain prejudice about this series.  The president is a liberal Democrat and this suits me very well.  However the Republicans in this show are treated fairly and with a great tolerance.The sets of disks covering seven seasons are very attractively presented in a container that will not detract from the most stylish furnishings.

176025,A20IIR0422G3A5,1419835491,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 3]","This review is primarily about the series, but I can make a few comments about this packaging. It is better than what I found in some other ""Complete Seasons"" packaging. All seasons are in a uniform format, even if the disks are simply lifted from yearly issues. The file folder styie is decent, relatively easy to remove and re-insert disks, unlike most jewel box containers. But, there are some errors in the labelling of the contents of the disks on the back of the folder, and in season 1 and season 2, the scene selection seems to malfunction. In order to select the beginning, the second scene needs to be highlighted. But on to the story.I really like to see this series, even with its huge cast and many, many different issues, as the story primarily of Josh Lyman and Donna Moss. The pilot opens with a controversy centered on Josh's disrespecting a member of the conservative right Christian fundamentalists. Two of the emotional high points, one at the end of season 1 and one at the end of season 5 involves serious injuries to Josh and Donna respectively. Josh has his ups and downs throughout the series. His low point comes in episode 5 of season 5, when it seems no one wants to be seen with him in the Democratic party, after a Democratic senator switches party due to Josh's intimidation. Josh's star starts rising when the First Lady asks why Josh isn't part of the negotiations over the budget, and Josh orchestrates a stunt which allows Bartlett to pull a big victory out of the hat over the budget. Virtually all of Season 6 and 7 are devoted to Josh's managing the presidental campaign of Matt Santos, and the parallel fortunes of Donna, in the campaign of Santos' democratic rival. Donna and Josh have the two best scenes in the last episode, where Josh (with Sam Seaborn) takes his position as Santos chief of staff, and Donna is shown her office as chief of staff to the new first lady, in an Old Executive Offfice Building office which seems bigger and grander than the Oval Office, a far, far cry from her cubicle in the bullpen of The West Wing. The last few episodes finally resolve the romantic tension between Josh and Donna.What makes The West Wing so impressive is when one watches other shows which deal with similar circumstances. The Sigourney Weaver headlined show, ""Political Animals"" seems detached from reality in comparison. The characters are not smart, fast talking, and not diverted by relatively trivial matters such as sex. In The West Wing, power and responsiblity seem to trump mere sex at practically every turn. Josh skirts sexual laisons with various characters (three at least), and they all pale and are undermined by political position and power.I can't think of any series which has such a rich mixture of great characters and great dialogue and innovative direction as this. Even relatively minor characters, such as John Larroquette as the White House council in one episode is memorable, as is David Huddleston's brief appearance as a Republican senator. The king of The West Wing guest appearances is John Goodman's playing the Speaker of the House, Glen Allen Walken, who takes over as president for three days.It is also worth mentioning that with the cost of this set, each episode is half the cost of downloading it from Amazon, 1 dollar versus about 2 dollars.",5,"Truly Great Series, small glitches in packaging.",1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,3325,"['review', 'primarily', 'series', 'can', 'make', 'few', 'comments', 'packaging', 'better', 'what', 'found', 'other', 'Complete', 'Seasons', 'packaging', 'seasons', 'are', 'uniform', 'format', 'even', 'disks', 'are', 'simply', 'lifted', 'yearly', 'issues', 'file', 'folder', 'styie', 'decent', 'relatively', 'easy', 'remove', 're-insert', 'disks', 'most', 'jewel', 'box', 'containers', 'are', 'errors', 'labelling', 'contents', 'disks', 'back', 'folder', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'scene', 'selection', 'malfunction', 'order', 'select', 'beginning', 'second', 'scene', 'needs', 'be', 'highlighted', 'story.I', 'really', 'see', 'series', 'even', 'huge', 'cast', 'many', 'many', 'different', 'issues', 'story', 'primarily', 'Josh', 'Lyman', 'Donna', 'Moss', 'pilot', 'controversy', 'centered', 'Josh', 'disrespecting', 'member', 'conservative', 'right', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'Two', 'emotional', 'high', 'points', 'one', 'end', 'season', '1', 'one', 'end', 'season', '5', 'serious', 'injuries', 'Josh', 'Donna', 'respectively', 'Josh', 'ups', 'downs', 'series', 'low', 'point', 'episode', '5', 'season', '5', 'when', 'one', 'be', 'seen', 'Democratic', 'party', 'Democratic', 'senator', 'switches', 'party', 'due', 'Josh', 'intimidation', 'Josh', 'star', 'rising', 'when', 'First', 'Lady', 'why', 'Josh', ""n't"", 'part', 'negotiations', 'budget', 'Josh', 'stunt', 'Bartlett', 'pull', 'big', 'victory', 'hat', 'budget', 'Virtually', 'Season', '6', '7', 'are', 'devoted', 'Josh', 'managing', 'presidental', 'campaign', 'Matt', 'Santos', 'parallel', 'fortunes', 'Donna', 'campaign', 'Santos', 'democratic', 'rival', 'Donna', 'Josh', 'have', 'two', 'best', 'scenes', 'last', 'episode', 'where', 'Josh', 'Sam', 'Seaborn', 'position', 'Santos', 'chief', 'staff', 'Donna', 'shown', 'office', 'chief', 'staff', 'new', 'first', 'lady', 'Old', 'Executive', 'Offfice', 'Building', 'office', 'bigger', 'grander', 'Oval', 'Office', 'far', 'far', 'cry', 'cubicle', 'bullpen', 'West', 'Wing', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'finally', 'resolve', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Josh', 'Donna.What', 'West', 'Wing', 'so', 'impressive', 'when', 'one', 'other', 'shows', 'deal', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'headlined', 'show', 'Political', 'Animals', 'detached', 'reality', 'comparison', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'smart', 'fast', 'talking', 'not', 'diverted', 'relatively', 'trivial', 'matters', 'such', 'sex', 'West', 'Wing', 'power', 'responsiblity', 'seem', 'trump', 'mere', 'sex', 'practically', 'turn', 'Josh', 'sexual', 'laisons', 'various', 'characters', 'three', 'least', 'pale', 'are', 'undermined', 'political', 'position', 'power.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'series', 'rich', 'mixture', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'dialogue', 'innovative', 'direction', 'Even', 'relatively', 'minor', 'characters', 'such', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'White', 'House', 'council', 'one', 'episode', 'memorable', 'David', 'Huddleston', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Republican', 'senator', 'king', 'West', 'Wing', 'guest', 'appearances', 'John', 'Goodman', 'playing', 'Speaker', 'House', 'Glen', 'Allen', 'Walken', 'who', 'over', 'president', 'three', 'days.It', 'also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'cost', 'set', 'episode', 'cost', 'downloading', 'Amazon', '1', 'dollar', 'versus', '2', 'dollars']",N/A
176026,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,1419835491,Brandon J. Smith,"[0, 0]","The West Wing is one of the few shows I can think of that won a ton of Emmys - and deserved them. It all starts with brilliant writing (informed, interesting, dramatic, and humorous, often at the same time), but throw in an incredible cast, set design, directing, and on and on. It all adds up to one of the greatest television series of all time.The boxed set contains the complete series as well as numerous bonus features. The box is nice, but I don't like the way the dvd discs are arranged within it. Though the folders look cool and allow all the dvds to be contained in a relatively small amount of space, the discs have to be slid in and out of their holders, which puts them at risk of being scratched. (Much preferable would have been an arrangement like you'd see in the season sets of Homicide: Life on the Street and Battlestar Galactica, in which each disc has its own thin case that it can click into.)Despite that quibble, everything else about this set is all you can hope for in a series. Every season was excellent, even if the post-Sorkin years weren't quite on the level of the earlier seasons (though I do think the show finished with a strong final season).

Well don't take my word for it take the numerous emmy nominations and wins it won. Lets break down why this show worked so well.- Aaron Sorkin brilliantly interwove banter in a usually boring political setting.- The cast was brilliantly picked and worked very well together. Each cast member had their own story lines which gave us a taste of what these very public figures were dealing with in their personal lives.- The show had amazing guest stars and always brought back key guest stars through out the seasons with out casting different actors to portray said parts.- The story lines were actually believable and gripping as well!- There was no bad season (Of course there were episodes that were better than others but each season stands on its own)- The show has a powerful and fulfilling series finale.- The show was just written well.I enjoy this show so much and never tire from watching it over and over again. It's rare when a show like this comes along and we are lucky to have seven full seasons.The show focuses on the presidential term of democratic president ""Josiah (Jed) Bartlett"" and his senior staff as they run the white house and the United States Of America. The show begins in the second year of his term and follows his term through campaign re-election, an assassination  attempt, the kidnapping of his daughter, the assassination  of a foreign leader suspected of being a terrorist, numerous scandals involving his senior staff and the rocky relationship with his wife the first lady all the way through the swearing in of the next president. And these are only a few of the events that take place throughout the series. Now you may think, ""How unbelievable!"" but you will be amazed at how well these story lines play and believable they are. You will laugh, you will cry, you will get angry and you will cheer but more than anything you will not forget the impact this show made in television history.

But I never watched West Wing when it was on TV.  Several friends who know of my preference for the other series, said I had to get it, so I'd been watching this on Amazon for a while, and was delighted when it was in the double digit price range on a gold box deal.  I snagged it right away.First of all, the physical presentation is outstanding.  Very nice box, with magnets inside to help it snap shut without anything cluttering the smooth look of it.Folders for each season are well done, folding out several times to encompass all the discs for each season.So far I've gone through about 20 of the discs, and have had no issues.

I didn't actually see it during the years that it was broadcast; I bought it for a discount price on DVD, and got hooked. It's like a book that one can't put down, leaving the viewer wanting to know what might happen next. The author, Aaron Sorkin is a most gifted playwright, who among other things is able to take intangible things like intuitive judgments about people or situations, and make them visible through his drama, filled with real and heart-warming characters. In my view Sorkin deserves to get an ""honorary"" award from the Queen's honours list.This is a wonderful series, to which I hope that the author will create a sequel some day, no doubt with Sam Seaborn as President (for reasons which will be clear to anyone who has followed it thus far).

However this set, although nice to look at, has too many flaws for me to recommend it very highly. 3 stars for this set.My main gripe is that there are no English subtitles. Why not? There is plenty of space on the disks and subtitles don't take up that much. The gain would be far greater than the cost!I often have to rewind episodes three or four times to catch a phrase that I can't quite make out hearing the first or second time. There is often so much background noise (sirens, crouds, music, etc) that one can't make out all the brilliant dialogue by only listening to the audio.The UK editions have English subtitles, so why can't the American versions?Another gripe is the packaging. While it is very nice to look at on the shelf, cleverly designed with file folders holding each season, it is impractical and scratches the disks! The folders are hard cardboard and the slits (not even lined with felt or soft material) are so narrow you have to really press the disks in, damaging and scratching them up!The UK boxed set uses 22 slimline DVD cases, holding two discs each, all packaged within season-by-season slip cases.If your DVD player can play European DVD's, I recommend paying a little extra and ordering the UK version instead: ASIN B000I8OC08 on Amazon.co.uk. It has the same 21+ hours of extras this set has so you won't be missing anything except the booklet and script, which frankly doesn't add much value.EDIT: As somebody kindly pointed out in the comments, seasons 1-5 have subtitles. Only seasons 6 & 7 are without English subs. Also, if you do consider buying the UK edition, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A REGION FREE DVD PLAYER, or that your player can play European DVD's.

Indeed I am!!  I am also a hopeless West Wing addict.  A fine Vodka or fine Scotch along with an episode of the West Wing and I'm in Heaven.  I can recite the lines before they are spoken.  If I could rate 6 Stars I would!!The writing throughout is excellent.  Even when Sorkin leaves, the quality is maintained.  The acting is beyond reproach.  Each casting member is ideal to their respective scenarios.  In all, we will learn how our government operates.  Even if you are a Republican you can identify with your Party and be proud.  This is indeed a slant of a Liberal President, however it is written to see both sides of the political spectrum.The Series lasted for 154 episodes and Seven Seasons.

Not one.I got this complete collection following the termination of the series.  And its role was to entertain us for the 42 minutes (a commercial-free ""hour"") we were on the treadmill running or walking.West Wing was truly responsible for hundreds of miles on that machine!This was a great series.  I truly appreciated the acting and actors, the writing and directing, and the plot.  The characters became alive over the seasons, and the magic of the show was that you empathized with these fictional characters (or the opposite... you were apathetic or antipathetic).But there were two aspects of this particular collection that hit a home run for me.  First, the detailed depiction of how government jockeying, negotiation, and law and policy making works.  Some of this is not pretty, and the current (2010) politics of health care reform (for example, the efforts of the senator from Nebraska to put up resistance and demand extra benefits for his state) made me continually reflect on this show.The second is... the lack of commercials.  I believe the intensity of many, many scenes would be negatively affected by the pause associated with yet another car or fast food commercial.So this collection of seasons is great entertainment, educational, and a super motivator to put the miles on the treadmill.

176107,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,1419835491,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[2, 2]","First off, while one can't judge a series, either on broadcast of DVD, by its packaging, Warner Home Video pulled out all the stops for the complete series edition.  A dispatch box is a great way of presenting one of the seminal political TV shows ever, and putting the early seasons on single-side DVD, although a small thing, was a wise choice.But packaging isn't what makes me buy a series collection.  It's the series itself, and here's where ""The West Wing"" was strongest - writing.  Aaron Sorkin is the KING of brilliant plotting and dialogue, and this series puts it all on display.  The first three seasons - where Sorkin was most involved - were strong on character, plot, and snappy, witty dialogue, even when the overall story faltered or the plotlines were too gimmicky.  Nobody has this much on their plate when they don't seek out conflict - an assasination, war scares, assorted horrors - and if they do, there's bound to be a flummox along the way.The strange thing is that ""The West Wing,"" like Sorkin's ""The American President,"" is smart but a little too idealistic with the main characters.  Sure, President Jed Bartlet is a caring, cautious, even, dare I say it, dignified, president, but he's been around the maypole long enough to know that deals have to be done.  Martin Sheen delivers a nuanced performance - easy I guess because the politics of his character mimic his real-life ones.  The pragmatic voice-on-his-shoulder, Leo McGarry, done by the ever brilliant John Spencer (we had him for only a short time on the ""must have"" list for character actors before he died), was the only voice of pragmatism in Bartlet's White House.I agree with other assessments that the series really suffered when Sorkin left.  His creative hand made the ""Wing"" the hit it was early on, and they struggled mightily after he left.  However, the show was bigger than it's creator, much as it was bigger than its ensemble cast (Moira Kelley and Rob Lowe must kick themselves every day when they think of how willingly they bailed on a hit show).  The series struggled to recapture its lustre in the later seasons, but they did hit stride again when, in a burst of daring reality, decided to end the show after Bartlet's two terms were up.  We've seen before how producers and networks, unwilling to let a hit go, despite knowing the best years are behind them, thus force a good show to die a death of mediocrity.  However, John Wells and Tommy Schlamme (the second creative genius on this project) brought their best work into showing a realistic election campaign while allowing us to see a bittersweet ending of a career that would be equally missed in the real world, including the disintegration of a personal/professional relationship over a leak scandal, and the challenge of doing the right thing for the person when it comes to handing out a pardon (surely one of the hardest things a real president must do).  Thus, even without Sorkin, we see a good series save its best truly for last.Wrapped up in all this, as expected, are some great behind-the-scenes goodness and additional materials exclusive for this edition (a reprint of the ""Pilot"" shooting script and essential episode guide) which add to both the series and the real world behind it.  Truly, this is well worth the price, which while considerable is much better in this set than buying all the boxes seperately.",5,One Of The Best Broadcast Drama Series - Even When It Wasn't,1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,3391,"['First', 'off', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'judge', 'series', 'broadcast', 'DVD', 'packaging', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'complete', 'series', 'edition', 'dispatch', 'box', 'great', 'way', 'presenting', 'one', 'seminal', 'political', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'putting', 'early', 'seasons', 'single-side', 'DVD', 'small', 'thing', 'was', 'wise', 'choice.But', 'packaging', ""n't"", 'what', 'buy', 'series', 'collection', 'series', 'here', 'where', 'West', 'Wing', 'was', 'strongest', 'writing', 'Aaron', 'Sorkin', 'KING', 'brilliant', 'plotting', 'dialogue', 'series', 'display', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'where', 'Sorkin', 'was', 'most', 'involved', 'were', 'strong', 'character', 'plot', 'snappy', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'even', 'when', 'overall', 'story', 'faltered', 'plotlines', 'were', 'too', 'gimmicky', 'Nobody', 'much', 'plate', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'seek', 'out', 'conflict', 'assasination', 'war', 'scares', 'assorted', 'horrors', 'do', 'bound', 'be', 'flummox', 'way.The', 'strange', 'thing', 'West', 'Wing', 'Sorkin', 'American', 'President', 'smart', 'little', 'too', 'idealistic', 'main', 'characters', 'Sure', 'President', 'Jed', 'Bartlet', 'caring', 'cautious', 'even', 'dare', 'say', 'dignified', 'president', 'been', 'maypole', 'long', 'enough', 'know', 'deals', 'have', 'be', 'done', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'easy', 'guess', 'politics', 'character', 'mimic', 'real-life', 'ones', 'pragmatic', 'voice-on-his-shoulder', 'Leo', 'McGarry', 'done', 'ever', 'brilliant', 'John', 'Spencer', 'had', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'list', 'character', 'actors', 'died', 'was', 'only', 'voice', 'pragmatism', 'Bartlet', 'White', 'House.I', 'agree', 'other', 'assessments', 'series', 'really', 'suffered', 'when', 'Sorkin', 'left', 'creative', 'hand', 'made', 'Wing', 'hit', 'was', 'early', 'struggled', 'mightily', 'left', 'However', 'show', 'was', 'bigger', 'creator', 'much', 'was', 'bigger', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Moira', 'Kelley', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'must', 'kick', 'day', 'when', 'think', 'how', 'willingly', 'bailed', 'hit', 'show', 'series', 'struggled', 'recapture', 'lustre', 'later', 'seasons', 'did', 'hit', 'stride', 'again', 'when', 'burst', 'daring', 'reality', 'decided', 'end', 'show', 'Bartlet', 'two', 'terms', 'were', 'up', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'how', 'producers', 'networks', 'unwilling', 'let', 'hit', 'go', 'knowing', 'best', 'years', 'are', 'thus', 'force', 'good', 'show', 'die', 'death', 'mediocrity', 'However', 'John', 'Wells', 'Tommy', 'Schlamme', 'second', 'creative', 'genius', 'project', 'brought', 'best', 'work', 'showing', 'realistic', 'election', 'campaign', 'allowing', 'see', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'career', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'missed', 'real', 'world', 'including', 'disintegration', 'personal/professional', 'relationship', 'leak', 'scandal', 'challenge', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'person', 'when', 'handing', 'out', 'pardon', 'surely', 'one', 'hardest', 'things', 'real', 'president', 'must', 'do', 'Thus', 'even', 'Sorkin', 'see', 'good', 'series', 'save', 'best', 'truly', 'last.Wrapped', 'up', 'expected', 'are', 'great', 'behind-the-scenes', 'goodness', 'additional', 'materials', 'exclusive', 'edition', 'reprint', 'Pilot', 'shooting', 'script', 'essential', 'episode', 'guide', 'add', 'series', 'real', 'world', 'Truly', 'well', 'price', 'considerable', 'much', 'better', 'set', 'buying', 'boxes', 'seperately']",N/A
