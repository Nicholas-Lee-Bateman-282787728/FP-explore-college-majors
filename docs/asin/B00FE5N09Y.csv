It's asking a lot from Fox to suddenly author eight additional seasons worth of material for a box set, potentially making it more expensive than it would need to be.  Allegedly, the show's singular Blu-Ray release (Season 4) sold less than the studio hoped, which partly explains why Fox opted not to make Blu-Ray editions of later seasons as time went on, as well as not revisiting the first three in high-definition.  But what's done is done.  Hopefully, Fox will revisit their (admittedly, premature) decision to not put the rest of the series on Blu-Ray.In the meantime, if there's one thing they can do for fans, it's present the first season in widescreen.  When Fox first released the DVD eight years ago (has it really been that long?), they unwisely used the 1.33:1 broadcast masters made for SD televisions, essentially a pan and scan of the filmed 1.78:1 widescreen (which was used for HD broadcasts).  Presentation-wise, this makes the first season inconsistent with the rest of the series.  Going from 1.33:1 in the first season (and a pan and scan, at that) to 1.78:1 for subsequent seasons has always been a minor bother for me, especially when I upgraded to an HDTV that made the pan & scan all the more apparent.  I'll settle for a &#34;Whole Story&#34; on DVD, but only if it finally allows for the first season to be seen as it was meant to be seen.",3,"Give us Season 1 in Widescreen, I'll forgive the absence of a Blu-Ray version",1405728000,"07 19, 2014",2014,1499,"[""'d"", 'prefer', '34', 'Whole', 'Story', '34', 'be', 'presented', 'high-definition', 'obviously', 'something', 'not', 'control', 'asking', 'lot', 'Fox', 'suddenly', 'author', 'eight', 'additional', 'seasons', 'material', 'box', 'set', 'potentially', 'making', 'more', 'expensive', 'would', 'need', 'be', 'Allegedly', 'show', 'singular', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'Season', '4', 'sold', 'less', 'studio', 'hoped', 'partly', 'why', 'Fox', 'opted', 'not', 'make', 'Blu-Ray', 'editions', 'later', 'seasons', 'time', 'went', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'revisiting', 'first', 'three', 'high-definition', 'what', 'done', 'done', 'Hopefully', 'Fox', 'will', 'revisit', 'admittedly', 'premature', 'decision', 'not', 'put', 'rest', 'series', 'Blu-Ray.In', 'meantime', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'fans', 'present', 'first', 'season', 'widescreen', 'When', 'Fox', 'first', 'released', 'DVD', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'been', 'long', 'unwisely', 'used', '1.33:1', 'broadcast', 'masters', 'made', 'SD', 'televisions', 'essentially', 'pan', 'scan', 'filmed', '1.78:1', 'widescreen', 'was', 'used', 'HD', 'broadcasts', 'Presentation-wise', 'first', 'season', 'inconsistent', 'rest', 'series', 'Going', '1.33:1', 'first', 'season', 'pan', 'scan', '1.78:1', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'always', 'been', 'minor', 'bother', 'especially', 'when', 'upgraded', 'HDTV', 'made', 'pan', 'scan', 'more', 'apparent', ""'ll"", 'settle', '34', 'Whole', 'Story', '34', 'DVD', 'only', 'finally', 'first', 'season', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen']",How I Met Your Mother: The Complete Series
