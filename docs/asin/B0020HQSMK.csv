1245964,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B0020HQSMK,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[9, 15]","Carlos Reygadas has made 3 features, Japon, Battle in Heaven, and this film.  I disliked Japon for the reasons I disliked Silent Light (I didn't see Battle in Heaven).  Reygadas's films seem like they're artistic on the surface, but they're shallow exercises in style and don't have that deep feeling and sincerity of the masters he's trying to emulate (Tarkovsky and Dreyer are the main ones he's attempting to emulate).  This film is essentially a remake/update of Carl Th. Dreyer's greatest work Ordet.  Reygadas changed the location and topography, but anyone who has seen Ordet will recognise the story arc here.The film has some excellent cinematography, some good performances (especially by the main character's father, who looks like Johannes from Ordet, which was probably not lost on Reygadas), but overall, the film is a fraud with an ""arbitrary"" miracle thrown in at the end.  The miracle in Dreyer's Ordet was truly stunning, and it made sense in the context of that film.  Dreyer's Ordet also flowed very well.  It was slow and stylized (it wouldn't be a Dreyer film if it wasn't), but Dreyer was such a magnificent artist and filmmaker that the slow style of his fits his work perfectly.  Silent Light, by contrast, is plodding and uneven, and the miracle scene (which uses some of the same framing as Ordet does) feels like it was thrown in just to juice things up.  While it is interesting when you watch it, and you feel somewhat moved by it, you feel cheated after the film is over, like you're just being manipulated by Reygadas into believing you've seen a deeply spiritual film.  You haven't.  Reygadas is just preying on the viewer's sense of spirituality, and that's why you think you've seen something profound.  It's a shallow attempt at an art film, much like Reygadas's first film, Japon.The film is not a complete disaster.  You get to see the Mennonite culture in Mexico (they speak a dialect of German in this film, and there is some Spanish spoken later), the opening and closing shots are really beautiful, the hymns they sing at the funeral are very moving, but the film is ultimately a shallow manipulation, not an art film.",3,A fraud....slight spoilers....,1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,2160,"['Carlos', 'Reygadas', 'made', '3', 'features', 'Japon', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'film', 'disliked', 'Japon', 'reasons', 'disliked', 'Silent', 'Light', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'Reygadas', 'films', 'seem', ""'re"", 'artistic', 'surface', ""'re"", 'shallow', 'exercises', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'deep', 'feeling', 'sincerity', 'masters', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Tarkovsky', 'Dreyer', 'are', 'main', 'ones', 'attempting', 'emulate', 'film', 'essentially', 'remake/update', 'Carl', 'Th', 'Dreyer', 'greatest', 'work', 'Ordet', 'Reygadas', 'changed', 'location', 'topography', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Ordet', 'will', 'recognise', 'story', 'here.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'good', 'performances', 'especially', 'main', 'character', 'father', 'who', 'Johannes', 'Ordet', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'lost', 'Reygadas', 'overall', 'film', 'fraud', 'arbitrary', 'miracle', 'thrown', 'end', 'miracle', 'Dreyer', 'Ordet', 'was', 'truly', 'stunning', 'made', 'sense', 'context', 'film', 'Dreyer', 'Ordet', 'also', 'flowed', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'slow', 'stylized', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Dreyer', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'Dreyer', 'was', 'such', 'magnificent', 'artist', 'filmmaker', 'slow', 'style', 'fits', 'work', 'perfectly', 'Silent', 'Light', 'contrast', 'plodding', 'uneven', 'miracle', 'scene', 'same', 'framing', 'Ordet', 'feels', 'was', 'thrown', 'just', 'juice', 'things', 'up', 'interesting', 'when', 'watch', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'moved', 'feel', 'cheated', 'film', ""'re"", 'just', 'being', 'manipulated', 'Reygadas', 'believing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'Reygadas', 'just', 'preying', 'viewer', 'sense', 'spirituality', 'why', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'something', 'profound', 'shallow', 'attempt', 'art', 'film', 'much', 'Reygadas', 'first', 'film', 'Japon.The', 'film', 'not', 'complete', 'disaster', 'get', 'see', 'Mennonite', 'culture', 'Mexico', 'speak', 'dialect', 'German', 'film', 'Spanish', 'spoken', 'later', 'opening', 'closing', 'shots', 'are', 'really', 'beautiful', 'hymns', 'sing', 'funeral', 'are', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'ultimately', 'shallow', 'manipulation', 'not', 'art', 'film']",Silent Light (Lumiere Silencieuse)

1245968,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B0020HQSMK,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[30, 33]","Johann has a problem.  He has a wife and children who he loves, and another woman who loves him and who he can't stop thinking about.  The Mennonite community in Mexico that is the backdrop for this story has a culture built on attempts to escape from the urgency of the clock, and pattern life according to a rhythm that respects nature and the sacred.  But there are other urgencies that are hard to avoid.Film critic Gilberto Perez (The Material Ghost), wrote that the best filmmakers are not satisfied with veneer or plausibility, but seek from reality ""something richer and stranger, of more potency and consequence, but also, in that measure, harder to deal with coherently, more resistant to articulate arrangement.""  Reygadas is in my opinion one of those filmmakers whose work doesn't feel like it is trying to teach you something or to entertain you or to make you feel something specific, but who seeks with each film to discover something real.  Not so much to tell a story as to let a story tell itself, to let human being and nature show itself in all its strangeness and wonder.The opening scene of this film is among the most powerful I've seen.  On the one hand it is unsettling and disorienting to be cast into the darkness of the open sky and twirled slowly with no sense of where we stand in space or time.  On the other hand, this incredible opening shot serves to orient us as viewers.  Before it is clear what is going on, that it is early morning and we are witnessing the emergence of light from the darkness, the sounds of crickets and a breeze and the groaning of the cattle begin to ground the film, to place what is to take place in and among the natural rhythms of the Earth.The next image, however, serves to remind us that here on Earth we people tend to govern our lives according to a different scale than that which operates in nature, the rhythm of the sun and moon and stars, of day and night, of the seasons, of birth and growth and death.  We pattern our lives after the artificial scales measured by the clock, by the calendar that tells us when to celebrate and the laws that tell us when to pay taxes, by the ordinances and regulations and habits and customs and prejudices that tell us when to get up when to go to work, how and when to follow our desires, how and with whom we can share our lives and feelings.What impresses me about this film is that nothing seems contrived.  Nothing seems to be there simply to be looked at, the camera does not feel like either a voyeur or a judge.  A scene of intimacy is not there to arouse the viewer, or to create a sense of vicarious satisfaction -- like all real sex (not the fake sex that sells products or pornography), it is awkward and estranging to watch, the scene reminds us that sex is a strange thing, like all real sex it means something only for the participant.  Once again, Gilberto Perez writes that the difficulty of engaging with the real in film is that ""the closer the engagement with reality, the more difficult the task of giving it form and meaning ... [but] the risk of incoherence must be run, unruly reality met on a ground close enough to its own for its energies and its resistance to come into play. Only by contending with its resistance can a filmmaker derive from its energies, and arrange into expressive structures, a vividness and force that tell on the screen."".By setting a familiar story into this unfamiliar world, that seems so different than the urban and suburban settings that at least in the movies tend to generate the boredom that results in infidelity, by setting this familiar story against such a rich natural backdrop, director Carlos Reygadas (Japon,Battle In Heaven) gives us insight into what strange and remarkable creatures we are, how we are at once very much animals with passions we cannot understand and how we work so hard to hide this from ourselves, that we must eat and drink and sleep and that our desires are not always compatible with our attempts to regulate desire and that we live and die according to forces we do not control and cannot predict.The dvd includes a short feature on the making of the film, and some deleted scenes.",5,Rhythms of nature and desire - a stunningly beautiful and austere new film by Carlos Reygadas,1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,4184,"['Johann', 'problem', 'wife', 'children', 'who', 'woman', 'who', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'Mennonite', 'community', 'Mexico', 'backdrop', 'story', 'culture', 'built', 'attempts', 'escape', 'urgency', 'clock', 'pattern', 'life', 'according', 'rhythm', 'nature', 'sacred', 'are', 'other', 'urgencies', 'are', 'hard', 'avoid.Film', 'critic', 'Gilberto', 'Perez', 'Material', 'Ghost', 'wrote', 'best', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'not', 'satisfied', 'veneer', 'plausibility', 'seek', 'reality', 'something', 'richer', 'stranger', 'more', 'potency', 'consequence', 'also', 'measure', 'harder', 'deal', 'coherently', 'more', 'resistant', 'articulate', 'arrangement', 'Reygadas', 'opinion', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'work', ""n't"", 'feel', 'trying', 'teach', 'something', 'entertain', 'make', 'feel', 'something', 'specific', 'who', 'film', 'discover', 'something', 'real', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'tell', 'story', 'let', 'story', 'tell', 'let', 'human', 'being', 'nature', 'show', 'strangeness', 'wonder.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'hand', 'unsettling', 'disorienting', 'be', 'cast', 'darkness', 'open', 'sky', 'twirled', 'slowly', 'sense', 'where', 'stand', 'space', 'time', 'other', 'hand', 'incredible', 'opening', 'shot', 'orient', 'viewers', 'clear', 'what', 'going', 'early', 'morning', 'are', 'witnessing', 'emergence', 'light', 'darkness', 'sounds', 'crickets', 'breeze', 'groaning', 'cattle', 'begin', 'ground', 'film', 'place', 'what', 'take', 'place', 'natural', 'rhythms', 'Earth.The', 'next', 'image', 'however', 'remind', 'here', 'Earth', 'people', 'tend', 'govern', 'lives', 'according', 'different', 'scale', 'nature', 'rhythm', 'sun', 'moon', 'stars', 'day', 'night', 'seasons', 'birth', 'growth', 'death', 'pattern', 'lives', 'artificial', 'scales', 'measured', 'clock', 'calendar', 'when', 'celebrate', 'laws', 'tell', 'when', 'pay', 'taxes', 'ordinances', 'regulations', 'habits', 'customs', 'prejudices', 'tell', 'when', 'get', 'up', 'when', 'go', 'work', 'how', 'when', 'follow', 'desires', 'how', 'whom', 'can', 'share', 'lives', 'feelings.What', 'film', 'nothing', 'contrived', 'Nothing', 'be', 'there', 'simply', 'be', 'looked', 'camera', 'not', 'feel', 'voyeur', 'judge', 'scene', 'intimacy', 'not', 'there', 'arouse', 'viewer', 'create', 'sense', 'vicarious', 'satisfaction', 'real', 'sex', 'not', 'fake', 'sex', 'products', 'pornography', 'awkward', 'estranging', 'watch', 'scene', 'sex', 'strange', 'thing', 'real', 'sex', 'something', 'only', 'participant', 'Once', 'again', 'Gilberto', 'Perez', 'difficulty', 'engaging', 'real', 'film', 'closer', 'engagement', 'reality', 'more', 'difficult', 'task', 'giving', 'form', 'meaning', '[', 'risk', 'incoherence', 'must', 'be', 'run', 'unruly', 'reality', 'met', 'ground', 'close', 'enough', 'own', 'energies', 'resistance', 'come', 'play', 'Only', 'contending', 'resistance', 'can', 'filmmaker', 'derive', 'energies', 'arrange', 'expressive', 'structures', 'vividness', 'force', 'tell', 'screen', '.By', 'setting', 'familiar', 'story', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'so', 'different', 'urban', 'suburban', 'settings', 'least', 'movies', 'tend', 'generate', 'boredom', 'results', 'infidelity', 'setting', 'familiar', 'story', 'rich', 'natural', 'backdrop', 'director', 'Carlos', 'Reygadas', 'Japon', 'Battle', 'Heaven', 'insight', 'what', 'strange', 'remarkable', 'creatures', 'are', 'how', 'are', 'once', 'very', 'much', 'animals', 'passions', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'hide', 'must', 'eat', 'drink', 'sleep', 'desires', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'compatible', 'attempts', 'regulate', 'desire', 'live', 'die', 'according', 'forces', 'do', 'not', 'control', 'can', 'not', 'predict.The', 'dvd', 'short', 'feature', 'making', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes']",Silent Light (Lumiere Silencieuse)

There is a movement in world cinema, to utilise non-professional actors and natural light together.The opening (and closing) shots open us up to a slow action shot almost in real time from constellations in a black sky to dawn shots of the rising sun,with all the attendant sounds of crickets,cicadas and cattle lowing.This is a filtered and idealised human nature set in a Mennonite community of Plautdiesh -speaking people who are attuned to the season's cycles, through cattle farming and crop harvesting.The film is composed of beautiful tableaus of widescreen natural vistas,earth and sky meeting on wide horizons, well captured on the many driving sequences,backed up with a soundscape of waving grass and trees,crickets,birds and running water. Johan is sitting with his wife and six children giving silent grace with a ticking clock. Beneath the harmonious surface there is tension between the couple.His wife Esther takes the children out and he breaks down in tears when alone. He has been having a two year affair with Marianne,another Mennonite (single)female.The imagery in this film induces a kind of trance-like contemplation. His infatuated mood expresses itself through him driving round his friend Zackaria to some raunchy music.He goes on to meet Marianne in a long kissing scene which ends in them making love.He is well supported by his friend and father,who thinks it is fate or the devil's work but does not condemn him.Johan thinks every man makes his own fate. We cut to a beautiful scene of the family bathing together. In such scenes the inner peace in the community is brought out.But his wife who he has told of his infidelity is close to tears as she loves him just as he does her,but he feels God intended Marianne for him.We see the family at a cornharvest in some stunning scenes and the machine moving through the fields of corn.Johan,Esther and the kids say silent grace by their pick-up.Johan feels torn and tells his wife he has to see Marianne,so she tells him to take the children to the dentists too.He engineers it so that a man looks after the kids in his camper van with it's own TV set they can watch.He steals away and makes passionate love with Marianne for the last time.Marianne saying she is at her happiest and saddest since `Peace is stronger than love' and expresses pity for Esther.In a bleak driving scene in the pouring rain Esther asks to get out to vomit.She runs from the car to a tree and breaks down holding it.She has a sense of loss:she used to be a part of everything,fully alive next to Johan.Now heartbroken,she dies of heart attack.She is next laid up in a coffin after being washed by her mother while her family say their last good-byes.The community sing mournful hymns.He talks to Marianne saying he'd do anything to turn back time.Marianne asks to see Esther and tears drop onto Esther's cheek as Marianne kisses her.What follows is a kind of resurrection episode,but is probably metaphorical,a wish fulfilment happy ending.You can either reject or accept this ending but remember this has a religious setting.",5,The best in world cinema,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,3330,"['film', 'purgation', 'junk-fest', 'sensation', 'clich', 'eacute', 'language', 'plots', 'normal', 'cinema.It', 'real', 'world', 'senses', 'sieve', 'habit', 'perfection', 'distilling', 'uncreated', 'light', 'movement', 'world', 'cinema', 'utilise', 'non-professional', 'actors', 'natural', 'light', 'together.The', 'opening', 'closing', 'shots', 'open', 'up', 'slow', 'action', 'shot', 'almost', 'real', 'time', 'constellations', 'black', 'sky', 'dawn', 'shots', 'rising', 'sun', 'attendant', 'sounds', 'crickets', 'cicadas', 'cattle', 'lowing.This', 'filtered', 'idealised', 'human', 'nature', 'set', 'Mennonite', 'community', 'Plautdiesh', '-speaking', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'attuned', 'season', 'cycles', 'cattle', 'farming', 'crop', 'harvesting.The', 'film', 'composed', 'beautiful', 'tableaus', 'widescreen', 'natural', 'vistas', 'earth', 'sky', 'meeting', 'wide', 'horizons', 'well', 'captured', 'many', 'driving', 'sequences', 'backed', 'up', 'soundscape', 'waving', 'grass', 'trees', 'crickets', 'birds', 'running', 'water', 'Johan', 'sitting', 'wife', 'six', 'children', 'giving', 'silent', 'grace', 'ticking', 'clock', 'harmonious', 'surface', 'tension', 'couple.His', 'wife', 'Esther', 'children', 'out', 'down', 'tears', 'when', 'alone', 'been', 'having', 'two', 'year', 'affair', 'Marianne', 'Mennonite', 'single', 'female.The', 'imagery', 'film', 'kind', 'trance-like', 'contemplation', 'infatuated', 'mood', 'expresses', 'driving', 'round', 'friend', 'Zackaria', 'raunchy', 'music.He', 'meet', 'Marianne', 'long', 'kissing', 'scene', 'making', 'love.He', 'well', 'supported', 'friend', 'father', 'who', 'fate', 'devil', 'work', 'not', 'condemn', 'him.Johan', 'thinks', 'man', 'own', 'fate', 'cut', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'family', 'bathing', 'together', 'such', 'scenes', 'inner', 'peace', 'community', 'brought', 'out.But', 'wife', 'who', 'told', 'infidelity', 'close', 'tears', 'just', 'God', 'intended', 'Marianne', 'him.We', 'see', 'family', 'cornharvest', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'machine', 'moving', 'fields', 'corn.Johan', 'Esther', 'kids', 'say', 'silent', 'grace', 'pick-up.Johan', 'feels', 'torn', 'wife', 'see', 'Marianne', 'take', 'children', 'dentists', 'too.He', 'engineers', 'so', 'man', 'kids', 'camper', 'van', 'own', 'TV', 'set', 'can', 'watch.He', 'steals', 'away', 'passionate', 'love', 'Marianne', 'last', 'time.Marianne', 'saying', 'happiest', 'saddest', 'Peace', 'stronger', 'love', 'pity', 'Esther.In', 'bleak', 'driving', 'scene', 'pouring', 'rain', 'Esther', 'get', 'out', 'vomit.She', 'runs', 'car', 'tree', 'breaks', 'down', 'holding', 'it.She', 'sense', 'loss', 'used', 'be', 'part', 'everything', 'fully', 'alive', 'next', 'Johan.Now', 'heartbroken', 'heart', 'attack.She', 'next', 'laid', 'up', 'coffin', 'being', 'washed', 'mother', 'family', 'say', 'last', 'good-byes.The', 'community', 'sing', 'mournful', 'hymns.He', 'talks', 'Marianne', 'saying', ""'d"", 'do', 'anything', 'turn', 'back', 'time.Marianne', 'see', 'Esther', 'tears', 'drop', 'Esther', 'cheek', 'Marianne', 'kind', 'resurrection', 'episode', 'probably', 'metaphorical', 'wish', 'fulfilment', 'happy', 'ending.You', 'can', 'either', 'reject', 'accept', 'ending', 'remember', 'religious', 'setting']",Silent Light (Lumiere Silencieuse)
