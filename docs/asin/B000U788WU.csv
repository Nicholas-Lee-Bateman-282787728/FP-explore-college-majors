1093721,AAMKGC17ZLGZL,B000U788WU,Bad Rad,"[18, 21]","Okay, so I'm a sucker for human interest stories.  But this movie blew me away.  I remember the Vietnam War because I was almost old enough to be drafted by the end of our involvement in the war.  And I remember when some of the boat people moved into our small western Pennsylvania town.  Everything else I got from the television news - unfortunately.  I had no inkling what those people went through on their various journeys to get to America.  All I knew is what I was told by my teachers and what I read in the newspapers.Recall the 2004 national elections when some left wing politicians said that some of those left behind in South Vietnam - later sent to the Viet Cong re-education camps - fared pretty well.  It was like saying the Nazi concentration camps were picnic grounds.  And while this movie makes no political statements, it does show how wrong the major media outlets were and have been for a very long time.  If you remember that time - 1975 - then you remember what we were led to believe - we were duped by the Walter Cronkites and Jane Fondas of the world.I don't expect this movie to ever be mentioned at the Academy Awards this coming February.

The story begins with the fall of Vietnam to the communists on April 30, 1975, and ends in Orange County, California in 1981. Tran follows the harrowing fate and fortunes of one family (and in various sub-plots their friends). The father, Long, is imprisoned in successive re-education camps. He insists that his wife, mother, and son flee on the overcrowded, rickety boats. And so a deeply loving family is rent asunder. The communists in their brutality, observes the grandmother, ""have lost their humanity.""

1093725,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000U788WU,Ernest Jagger,"[22, 24]","Directed and written by Ham Tran, ""Journey from the Fall,"" is a very emotional film. The films narrative is based on fictional characters, but in a sense these characters are representative of the millions of South Vietnamese who were displaced, forced to leave their country, or sent to re-education camps after the fall of Saigon. The film reminded me in many ways of ""The Killing Fields"" starring the late Haing S. Ngor. And while ""The Killing Fields"" dealt with Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, it has much in common with the film ""Journey from the Fall,"" in that it deals with the aftermath of Americas absence from Southeast Asia, and what befell those who were left behind. In this particular film, the director weaves three main narratives into the film.One of these narratives revolves around the father Long (Long Nguyen). It is April 1975, and the North Vietnamese have nearly conquered the South. However, Long believes it is his duty to continue fighting for Saigon until the very end. He tells his wife Mai (Diem Lien) that he must remain behind to carry on the fight, while imploring her to leave for America with their young son Lai (Nguyen Thai Nguyen) and the grandmother Ba Noi (Keiu Chinh). I found the fathers narrative to be the most fascinating in the film. As the film moves forward, the viewer is witness to the infamous RE-EDUCATION camps that were so prominent with communist regimes. Those who fought in the former government are considered traitors, and as such, they MUST be re-educated along communist dogma---before they are allowed to fit into the new social order of the now reunified country.The viewer sees the plight of the father as he endures years of imprisonment in the re-education camps, while at the same time, we see the emotional strain this is causing on the rest of the family. Grandmother is excellently cast in her role, as she recounts legendary tales to the young grandchild Lai. Amidst all of the emotional pain the family is going through now that the father is separated from them, is the ever present thought of escape to America. When the family decides the time is right for escape, they encounter a very perilous journey. The director did a very good job with the set designs in the open seas, as you can sense the claustrophobic feeling of the families who are attempting to escape Vietnam in a small fishing boat. Moreover, there is the ever present danger of pirates who prey on the open seas: And this is vividly portrayed in the film.When the family eventually arrives in America, they encounter the usual hostility newcomers often face. Further, the director shows in both subtle, and not so subtle ways the discrimination that befalls the newcomers in their new home--especially those of the young boy Lai. However, there is more to the film than the families escape to America. We see the constant perils of those who are in the re-education camps and their hopes of finally gaining freedom. For while the director shows those who have finally found freedom, he also gives us a glimpse of many others who are still in the re-education camps who firmly believe and hope that they will one day be released, or will release themselves through bribery or escape from the camps. Will the father finally find freedom? I don't wish to divulge too much in this review, as there are some very important parts of the film I did not explore, which will only ruin the film for you. I recommend the film highly. For a more in-depth review, I recommend viewers take a look at the reviewer Woopak's review. He has given an outstanding review of the film.

1093726,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,B000U788WU,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[6, 17]","A grim reminder of what happens when the US betrays its allies and leaves them to face the inhuman, whether it be Communism or ... something else ... and why the Vietnamese hope there is a special level of hell for Walter Cronkite and the rest of his ilk who finally broke the spirit of America by their misreporting of the Vietnam War, portraying the Tet Offensive as a victory for the Viet Cong instead of the disaster that it was for them.It's many portraits of man's inhumanity to man ... starting with the protagonist Long's insistence on staying behind while sending off his family to the ""New Economic Zone"". It's a cruel and unexplained choice. It's further confused when, witnessing the terror in the streets because of the Communist victory, he says, ""Do you think it would be any different if America had won?"" Not sure what he means by this crazy statement, but it seems inexplicably foolish, especially since he's sending his family there ... and it's not clear why he wants to stay, or what he hopes to accomplish, apart from being imprisoned and tortured. (That's where the atheistic regime's inhumanity to man is on display, with their re-education camps and using prisoners to stumble upon mines.) Perhaps this equating an American victory with the Communist one - thanks again, Cronkite - is the writer's bit of inhumanity to us and to the Vietnamese people, a little, cruel joke at the expense of the millions who suffered under the atheistic empire.Then there's the ordeals of his family, who become ""boat people"" to reach the promised land. Seasickness, claustrophobic quarters, and pirates, scum of the earth who ironically mirror the entire Communist government.But there's more ... his family also commits little inhumanities to each other by keeping secrets, silly though they may be. The grandma, apparently not understanding the fundamental tenets of Buddhism, prays to Buddha and credits him for their deliverances (quite against Buddha's exhortations to extinguish all desire, and quite against the dispositions of one who has been successful in doing so (Buddha) to lift a finger to help, if indeed he could, having attained nothingness). She tells the kid to write his dad, in order to keep hope alive, even though they've nowhere to send them. The kid is ungrateful to the mom, who works in a sweatshop. And so on.The film feels overlong, but I suppose not much could have been done apart from mostly needless ""home movie""-style flashbacks. But, apart from the confusion mentioned above, it's a timely message to a generation who are blithely unaware of the Darwinist Communist horror, which killed orders of magnitude more people in ""modern"" times than all the religious wars of past centuries combined. (Hitler, also following Darwinism, ""only"" killed 11 million, whereas the Communists killed over 100 million.)",4,Why the Vietnamese pray for a special hell for Cronkite,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2846,"['grim', 'reminder', 'what', 'when', 'US', 'allies', 'face', 'inhuman', 'be', 'Communism', 'something', 'else', 'why', 'Vietnamese', 'hope', 'special', 'level', 'hell', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'rest', 'ilk', 'who', 'finally', 'broke', 'spirit', 'America', 'misreporting', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'portraying', 'Tet', 'Offensive', 'victory', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'instead', 'disaster', 'was', 'them.It', 'many', 'portraits', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'starting', 'protagonist', 'Long', 'insistence', 'staying', 'sending', 'off', 'family', 'New', 'Economic', 'Zone', 'cruel', 'unexplained', 'choice', 'further', 'confused', 'when', 'witnessing', 'terror', 'streets', 'Communist', 'victory', 'Do', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'America', 'had', 'won', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'crazy', 'statement', 'inexplicably', 'foolish', 'especially', 'sending', 'family', 'there', 'not', 'clear', 'why', 'stay', 'what', 'accomplish', 'apart', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'tortured', 'where', 'atheistic', 'regime', 'inhumanity', 'man', 'display', 're-education', 'camps', 'using', 'prisoners', 'stumble', 'upon', 'mines', 'Perhaps', 'equating', 'American', 'victory', 'Communist', 'one', 'thanks', 'again', 'Cronkite', 'writer', 'bit', 'inhumanity', 'Vietnamese', 'people', 'little', 'cruel', 'joke', 'expense', 'millions', 'who', 'suffered', 'atheistic', 'empire.Then', 'ordeals', 'family', 'who', 'become', 'boat', 'people', 'reach', 'promised', 'land', 'Seasickness', 'claustrophobic', 'quarters', 'pirates', 'scum', 'earth', 'who', 'ironically', 'mirror', 'entire', 'Communist', 'government.But', 'more', 'family', 'also', 'little', 'inhumanities', 'other', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'silly', 'may', 'be', 'grandma', 'apparently', 'not', 'understanding', 'fundamental', 'tenets', 'Buddhism', 'Buddha', 'credits', 'deliverances', 'quite', 'Buddha', 'exhortations', 'extinguish', 'desire', 'quite', 'dispositions', 'one', 'who', 'been', 'successful', 'doing', 'so', 'Buddha', 'lift', 'finger', 'help', 'indeed', 'could', 'having', 'attained', 'nothingness', 'kid', 'write', 'dad', 'order', 'keep', 'hope', 'alive', 'even', ""'ve"", 'nowhere', 'send', 'kid', 'ungrateful', 'mom', 'who', 'sweatshop', 'so', 'on.The', 'film', 'feels', 'overlong', 'suppose', 'not', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'apart', 'mostly', 'needless', 'home', 'movie', '-style', 'flashbacks', 'apart', 'confusion', 'mentioned', 'timely', 'message', 'generation', 'who', 'are', 'blithely', 'unaware', 'Darwinist', 'Communist', 'horror', 'killed', 'orders', 'magnitude', 'more', 'people', 'modern', 'times', 'religious', 'wars', 'past', 'centuries', 'combined', 'Hitler', 'also', 'following', 'Darwinism', 'only', 'killed', '11', 'million', 'Communists', 'killed', 'over', '100', 'million']",Journey From the Fall

Reviewers Ernest and Woopak has already said it best by giving in an extraordinary in-depth review which left me to fem for myself. After watching this tonight I thought Ham Tran's ""Journey From the Fall"" ought to stand on its own two feet despite offhanded comparisons to Schindler's List . It is by turns a tough and tender survival story of Vietnamese boat people that's more intimate, less remorseful, and not in slightest bit self-righteous. It concerns the plight of the Nguyen family post-Vietnam war: husband Long is imprisoned in a series of grueling re-education camps, forced into hard labour and the regularly fatal practice of clearing landmines; meanwhile his wife, mother and son defect via an overcrowded vessel headed anywhere but `Nam. Initially harrowing and without hope, the film relocates at its mid-point to California in the 80's, where the family have immigrated successfully, albeit uneasily, with the undertow of those left behind a heavy burden to bear.Crucially, Tran narrows the focus from the outset, allaying the broad chaos and resentment of a war-ravaged country in favour of the closeness of his four affected family members - the universality of their flight bound to resonate with most Vietnamese (9 out of 10 in the US, for instance, either were or knew boat people), as well as anyone who's sought refuge from their tarnished homeland. With a generous budget, this is impressively fielded in scale, yet maintains a modesty that's humbling.Come to fine out this was  financed by producers Stateside, but the American influence is otherwise non-existent: there are no marines or platoons; no embittered war veterans in wheelchairs; nor is there the overbearing presence of an Oliver Stone. He may not admit to it, but ""Journey From the Fall"" is also Tran's backlash against imperialism: just as Americans are compelled to impose themselves on conflicts overseas, so to are they insistent on making them into movies from their own perspective. A film about Vietnamese, by Vietnamese, this is an imprint of war that's 30 years overdue, yet fresh off the scenic boat.",5,"Great story of the ""Re-Education Camp"" and ""Boat People"".",1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,2163,"['one', 'beautiful', 'film', 'more', 'tear-jerker', 'say', 'Reviewers', 'Ernest', 'Woopak', 'already', 'said', 'best', 'giving', 'extraordinary', 'in-depth', 'review', 'left', 'fem', 'watching', 'tonight', 'thought', 'Ham', 'Tran', 'Journey', 'Fall', 'ought', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'offhanded', 'comparisons', 'Schindler', 'List', 'turns', 'tough', 'tender', 'survival', 'story', 'Vietnamese', 'boat', 'people', 'more', 'intimate', 'less', 'remorseful', 'not', 'slightest', 'bit', 'self-righteous', 'plight', 'Nguyen', 'family', 'post-Vietnam', 'war', 'husband', 'Long', 'imprisoned', 'series', 'grueling', 're-education', 'camps', 'forced', 'hard', 'labour', 'regularly', 'fatal', 'practice', 'clearing', 'landmines', 'meanwhile', 'wife', 'mother', 'son', 'defect', 'overcrowded', 'vessel', 'headed', 'anywhere', 'Nam', 'Initially', 'harrowing', 'hope', 'film', 'mid-point', 'California', '80', 'where', 'family', 'have', 'immigrated', 'successfully', 'uneasily', 'undertow', 'left', 'heavy', 'burden', 'bear.Crucially', 'Tran', 'focus', 'outset', 'allaying', 'broad', 'chaos', 'resentment', 'war-ravaged', 'country', 'favour', 'closeness', 'four', 'affected', 'family', 'members', 'universality', 'flight', 'bound', 'resonate', 'most', 'Vietnamese', '9', '10', 'US', 'instance', 'were', 'knew', 'boat', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'who', 'sought', 'refuge', 'tarnished', 'homeland', 'generous', 'budget', 'impressively', 'fielded', 'scale', 'yet', 'modesty', 'humbling.Come', 'fine', 'out', 'was', 'financed', 'producers', 'Stateside', 'American', 'influence', 'otherwise', 'non-existent', 'are', 'marines', 'platoons', 'embittered', 'war', 'veterans', 'wheelchairs', 'overbearing', 'presence', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'may', 'not', 'admit', 'Journey', 'Fall', 'also', 'Tran', 'backlash', 'imperialism', 'just', 'Americans', 'are', 'compelled', 'impose', 'conflicts', 'overseas', 'are', 'insistent', 'making', 'movies', 'own', 'perspective', 'film', 'Vietnamese', 'Vietnamese', 'imprint', 'war', '30', 'years', 'overdue', 'yet', 'fresh', 'scenic', 'boat']",Journey From the Fall

My wife (from Can Tho) pointed out many instances where the story closely resembled the way her family members had left Vietnam or their experiences in the ""re-education"" camps. There was even a part where the North Vietnamese camp commander complains that he was mislead about his relatives poverty living in South Vietnam only to find during his first visit that they actually were better off than he was. The same story was related to me exactly years ago by a co-worker (also from Can Tho) who had spent time in a re-education camp.

1093732,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000U788WU,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","After South Vietnam fell to the Communists in 1975, many of those who were seen as having ""collaborated"" with the Americans during the war were sent to ""re-education camps,"" where they were brutalized and tortured until such time as they were deemed fit to return to society fully on-board with the repressive regime's mantra of collectivist solidarity.  Others, more ""fortunate"" perhaps, were able to escape the coming onslaught, becoming known internationally as ""boat people"" - though many of these refugees tragically never made it to their destinations.  ""Journey From the Fall"" movingly recounts the story of one family that gets caught up in both of these predicaments.Despite a flashback-filled structure that becomes a bit confusing and even disorienting at times, ""Journey From the Fall"" is a wrenching and compelling tribute to the ability of the human spirit to survive under even the most hellish of circumstances.  The movie chronicles not only Long Nguyen and his fellow prisoners' experiences in the camp but the attempt by his wife, mother and young son to flee the country by boat (in fact, the last forty-five minutes or so of the movie detail their struggle to adjust to their new life in Southern California).  The movie is sometimes hard to watch - for writer/director Ham Tran never flinches from showing us the harsh reality of the subject he is portraying -  but there's always the possibility of better things in the future to mitigate the suffering.At a running-time of well over two hours, the movie could have used some trimming to accelerate the pace, but the quality of the acting and the universality of the theme keep us absorbed throughout.",4,powerful drama of survival and hope,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,1674,"['South', 'Vietnam', 'fell', 'Communists', '1975', 'many', 'who', 'were', 'seen', 'having', 'collaborated', 'Americans', 'war', 'were', 'sent', 're-education', 'camps', 'where', 'were', 'brutalized', 'tortured', 'such', 'time', 'were', 'deemed', 'fit', 'return', 'society', 'fully', 'on-board', 'repressive', 'regime', 'mantra', 'collectivist', 'solidarity', 'Others', 'more', 'fortunate', 'perhaps', 'were', 'able', 'escape', 'coming', 'onslaught', 'becoming', 'known', 'internationally', 'boat', 'people', 'many', 'refugees', 'tragically', 'never', 'made', 'destinations', 'Journey', 'Fall', 'movingly', 'story', 'one', 'family', 'caught', 'up', 'predicaments.Despite', 'flashback-filled', 'structure', 'bit', 'confusing', 'even', 'disorienting', 'times', 'Journey', 'Fall', 'wrenching', 'compelling', 'tribute', 'ability', 'human', 'spirit', 'survive', 'even', 'most', 'hellish', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Long', 'Nguyen', 'fellow', 'prisoners', 'experiences', 'camp', 'attempt', 'wife', 'mother', 'young', 'son', 'flee', 'country', 'boat', 'fact', 'last', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'detail', 'struggle', 'adjust', 'new', 'life', 'Southern', 'California', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'watch', 'writer/director', 'Ham', 'Tran', 'never', 'showing', 'harsh', 'reality', 'subject', 'portraying', 'always', 'possibility', 'better', 'things', 'future', 'mitigate', 'suffering.At', 'running-time', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'trimming', 'accelerate', 'pace', 'quality', 'acting', 'universality', 'theme', 'keep', 'absorbed']",Journey From the Fall

1093734,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000U788WU,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[8, 9]","Seldom have I seen a film that almost brought me to tears. This film by writer/director Ham Tran did, and believe me when I say it is no easy task for me to be so moved and touched by a film. ""Journey from the Fall"" is a tale about the ""boat people"" from Vietnam, I've never seen a film that absolutely, accurately portrayed the harrowing experiences of these people. I was extremely lucky to have seen this film in a limited engagement in theaters early this year. (My friend Ken Lee has been relentless in convincing me to see this film, I'm very happy he did!)The story revolves around a fictional family (based on real people) who because of the father's decisiveness to stay and defend Saigon from its invaders during the Vietnam war results in his family's hardships and eminent inner heroism. After the communist side won the war, Long, a husband and a father to a son, was captured and sent to the so-called re-education camps. He urges his wife; Mai, their son Lai and the grandmother to ""hop"" on the first chance they get to leave for America. Mai, Lai, and the grandmother; Ba Noi manages to reach America with the aid of the boat's captain who has developed a fondness for Mai. Upon, learning that his family has reached safety, Long becomes determined to escape and join his family in America...The director's hard work and talent is awe-inspiring. I've read that Tran actually interviewed numerous Vietnamese refugees and survivors of the re-education camps, even examined photos to visualize/recreate the brutal re-education camps. His efforts are well worth the wait. The father's character Long's experiences are just the tip of the iceberg. The harrowing set designs of the said camps is very realistic; ironically, the camps have a sign that says; ""Nothing is more precious than Freedom"". Within these camps, prisoners are brutally abused by the soldiers who guards them, beaten to near-death and locked up in small windowless boxes; heated by the searing heat of the sun during the day and cold in the evening. They are told that they will be released after they've been re-educated but Long fears that he will die within these walls.Tran doesn't hold back with the graphic nature of this film. Next up, he shows the experiences of Mai, Lai and Ba Noi in a small fishing boat headed for America. The director effectively took me to the dark, cramped space, full of seasick women and kids, so accurately that I almost felt that I was also in the selfsame cramped boat. It was very difficult to watch every painful moan of a sick kid, ailing women, the sequences had that very claustrophobic feel. The folks in the boat are in the mercy of the elements; shifting waves and the weather make their journey very perilous, and to make matters worst, the boat is attacked by pirates who indiscriminately kill, kidnap and rape the women. They tear their children from their mother's arms, all this brutality is very hard to stomach.After Mai, Lai and Ba Noi finally do make it to America, settling in Orange County, you may think everything will be fine. Now, they will have to adjust to their new life in a new community where some welcome their presence while others disdain and gives a hint of discrimination towards them. Ba Noi takes care of Lai while Mai works her butt off in a sweatshop. Young Lai also has his own problems when he becomes a target of school bullies. I suppose one may say these hardships are nothing compared to their previous experiences. Once Long hears word of his family's arrival in America, he becomes obsessed and determined in escape.Does he succeed? Watch the film...The film's main strengths come from its excellent cast headed by Long Nguyen and Kieu Chinh (Joy Luck Club). Diem Lien is a Vietnamese pop star but in her role as Mai, she proves that she is more than a great voice; she portrays her character convincingly. The entire cast is outstanding; they all give the performances of their lives including the young kid who plays Lai. (In my opinion)""JOURNEY FROM THE FALL"" is a true masterpiece. It takes us from the jungles of Vietnam, to the harrowing experience of the re-education camps and the horrific boat ride to the land of opportunity. Tran's talent shines through with his attention to detail, it shows that he made this film direct from his heart and with loving care. Tran's film is a fitting homage to the real-life tales of those survived this ordeal and gives honor to the survivors after the fall of Saigon; paying tribute to those who lived and those who did not.As depressing the film's premise may be, I found one strong, very moving message; it is not glamorous and is one of the dogged against all odds lesson of human survival:"" No one is going to help you, you may not be capable and your efforts may end up in failure. But if you may struggle hard enough to survive, then MAYBE your next meal is ALL the reward you will need"".This message may not be pretty, but there is a lot of HONESTY that lasts beyond its end credits.Nothing...I mean nothing can touch the human spirit....HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!

I was assigned a girl my own age, to help teach her English, play with her and generally make her life a little easier while transitioning to her new country.  We were friends for about a year, until my family moved away and I never saw or heard from her again.  I remember my mother telling me to be very nice to her and treat her well because she was a boat person, and that her boat had been attacked by pirates and she had been raped, but I was far too young to really understand what any of that meant.  It wasn't until I saw ""Journey from the Fall"" that I really gained any sort of insight as to what she must have gone through.Opening a window into someone else's experiences is one of the great gifts of film, and director Ham Tran has proven himself to be a virtuoso.  The structure of ""Journey from the Fall"", including multiple time shifts and scene changes, leaves one appropriately disorientated as the characters themselves are.  If people are still living or dead, if they have escaped or been captured...this information is put forth in a non-linear order so the confusion and ""ah-ha"" moments are well balanced.  He demands concentration and investigation on the part of the viewer, rather than just feeding the story to a passive audience.  One must think about this film, in order to get its full intent.There is nothing of the beauty ofHeaven & Earth, which made full use of the lush Vietnamese landscape.  The camera is tight and controlled, and the pictures are realistic and dirty.  This is a very human picture.  The actors deliver stellar performances, including Long Nguyen, who was also in Heaven and Earth, playing the detained father, and Diem Lien, professionally a singer rather than an actress, as his suffering wife.  The storytelling grandmother, Kieu Chinh (The Joy Luck Club),  is also amazing, being the heart of a family that has had its soul torn out.I really feel like I cannot praise this film enough, and I am only sorry that it took me so long to see it.  It should almost be required viewing, especially for those of us who had some experience with this during the end of the Vietnam War.  While watching, I couldn't help but wonder about what will happen to the people of Iraq when the US finally leaves, and if we will see another version of ""Journey from the Fall"" 30 years from now.  I also wonder about my friend from 2nd grade.
