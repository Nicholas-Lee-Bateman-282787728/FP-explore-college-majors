And when you consider the shoestring budget it was made on, it is even more remarkable.

That is, if you are a Christian, God will overcome all your earthly obstacles for you and make you an outstanding, victorious success right here on earth.

I love it because of what God did in my life as a result of it. I think to view this film as simply a God gives you what you want piece is short sighted. Yes, in the end the conflicts all tie up positively and nicely but most movies do so I don't know why so many people had a problem with that. I also think this movie is not saying name it and claim it. I think it is a challenge for us to remember that God makes things happen when we believe. God taught me the power to praise him when I win and when I lose. I am a Pastor and this movie encouraged me to remain in that truth and I have seen God use it in my life many times since first seeing this film. I gave it four instead of five stars because I have to admit as Sherwood's second outing, the acting and script and not yet polished. On the budget they had they did an incredible job.

We can truly let our children watch ""Facing the Giants"" and not be concerned. At the same time it offers several opportunities to open up conversations with your children.  There is: *no sex *no swearing *no immorality *no innuendo *no unnecessary violence *no immodesty.  There are people you can believe with real, everyday problems.  They show life the way it is - you have to work through your problems and face them head on.There is one situation where one of the players is overtly disrespectful to his father.  The scene is necessary to the movie and is handled very well.  It is not just thrown in there because it's ""how kids are"".  The resolution comes later in the movie and is to be commended.For a cast and crew of volunteers this movie can't be beat!  Buy one for yourself and several to give away and look forward to a wonderful evening with your preteen and teenaged children.Not sure why it's rated PG.

Honestly, I thought this was a weak movie during the first 15 minutes, the first time I viewed it.  It did start slow, and I felt that the acting was a little weak!  But the movie picked up pace as it went along, and had me on the edge of my seat by the end, each time I watched it.  Toward the end, I was even impressed with the acting.  For second rate and unknown actors, these guys are great!!  The one scene, the ""Death Crawl"" scene during training, was an awe-inspiring, tear jerking, academy award performance scene that had me in tears!!  That scene alone is a must see, and out-does, out-performes any scene in any other football movie I've seen to date, including Invincible, Friday Night Lights, and Remember the Titans (yes, even the Titans does not stand up to the Death Crawl!).  The Football game scenes are perfect: very action pact, short enough, and to the point.  They dont overwhelm you, and the scenes are great football!  The movie centers around the coach, but you do start to feel for the team as a whole, and some of the key players do have their shining moments that support the movie.  You cant help cheering for them, and you cant help loving the team!  Yes, it is a Christian-Faith, Believe-in-God, Believe in the Bible movie.  For those that believe, this supports your faith 100%.  You couldnt ask for a better movie.  It's what the bible is all about.  For those that dont believe, still get a taste of what the Christian faith is all about, and still get to see how a coach and team pull themselves up from dust, and soar like eagles in the end!  For those that dont believe, then this is just another way a team turned a losing season into a winning season.  Who's to judge one method over another.  In this movie, they chose to believe that God could make it possible, and for them, it worked!  I rate this 5 stars.  Any movie that can make me cry after the fifth viewing in 2 days, deserves nothing less.  It is a clean movie, with no foul language, supporting good morals and good principles.

On this level the viewer will be disappointed.  While the production quality is high, the acting is down home and transparent although there are some scenes where you really feel the actors and these scenes would not be out of place in any film anywhere.However, about halfway through the film it becomes predictable and the dialogue often running into high cheese factor.  The flow, the set-up and the ending are predictable.  Had I not understood what the film was about I would have turned it off about halfway through. Hollywood this isn't.  I'd give it about two and a half stars if that were it.2) As a Church film with a Message.  This film was done entirely by a Church and ended up being distributed by a major movie distributor.  Understanding this, the film is an impressive work.I give it a solid four stars on this level (one star short of five as I am a movie buff).  It is a preaching film, a film about a life devoted to Christ and what can be accomplished when God is central in one's life.  Episodes and scenes in the film become directly relevant to the lives of those seeking to follow Christ and in this the film is successful.  It is a modern day parable.Either way, it is a feel good movie and will make you, even if just for a moment, really believe in what is possible in this life.I highly recommend watching the extras as to the making of the film.

However, I am reminded of a country preacher who came to his church one Sunday after a terrible blizzard, and only one old rancher showed up for the service.  The preacher asked if he should go on with the service.  The rancher drawled, 'When I go out to feed my cattle, and only one shows up, I feed it.'  So, after going through a compete Sunday service, the pastor asked how it was.  The rancher replied, ""When only one steer shows up, I don't give him the whole load of alfalfa!'  Unfortunately, almost all so-called Christian movies try to give viewers the 'whole load.'  I felt that they were trying to cram in everything from a revival to a miracle pregnancy as positive examples of what happenes when people get right with God.My second concern with this movie is the notion that when one becomes right with God, everything goes for the better.  If that were true, St. Peter and St. Paul must surely have done something wrong.  They both spent months and years in prisons, and were eventually killed for their faith.  Instead, in this movie it seemed that everyone who was committed to God had the wonderful things they desired happen to them because of their belief.  Could it be that Peter and Paul's belief was not merely strong enough to get God to dispense good things to them, but that it was so strong they could 'read' the mind of God and by that know for which person to pray that they be healed, or even to face their own death with full faith in God?I commend the producers for trying to make a Christian movie for the general population.  But, it leaves many theological questions that families might wish to discuss with their children.  These questions will probably never be answered in human terms, but they should be deeply thought about by all people of faith.",3,Another Typical 'Christian' Movie,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,1920,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'approach', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'general', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'favor', 'movies', 'depict', 'Christians', 'positively', 'However', 'am', 'reminded', 'country', 'preacher', 'who', 'came', 'church', 'one', 'Sunday', 'terrible', 'blizzard', 'only', 'one', 'old', 'rancher', 'showed', 'up', 'service', 'preacher', 'asked', 'should', 'go', 'service', 'rancher', 'drawled', 'go', 'out', 'feed', 'cattle', 'only', 'one', 'up', 'feed', 'So', 'going', 'compete', 'Sunday', 'service', 'pastor', 'asked', 'how', 'was', 'rancher', 'replied', 'When', 'only', 'one', 'steer', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'whole', 'load', 'alfalfa', 'Unfortunately', 'almost', 'so-called', 'Christian', 'movies', 'try', 'give', 'viewers', ""'whole"", 'load', 'felt', 'were', 'trying', 'cram', 'everything', 'revival', 'miracle', 'pregnancy', 'positive', 'examples', 'what', 'happenes', 'when', 'people', 'get', 'right', 'God.My', 'second', 'concern', 'movie', 'notion', 'when', 'one', 'right', 'God', 'everything', 'better', 'were', 'true', 'St.', 'Peter', 'St.', 'Paul', 'must', 'surely', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'wrong', 'spent', 'months', 'years', 'prisons', 'were', 'eventually', 'killed', 'faith', 'Instead', 'movie', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'committed', 'God', 'had', 'wonderful', 'things', 'desired', 'happen', 'belief', 'Could', 'be', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'belief', 'was', 'not', 'merely', 'strong', 'enough', 'get', 'God', 'dispense', 'good', 'things', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'could', ""'read"", 'mind', 'God', 'know', 'person', 'pray', 'be', 'healed', 'even', 'face', 'own', 'death', 'full', 'faith', 'God', 'commend', 'producers', 'trying', 'make', 'Christian', 'movie', 'general', 'population', 'many', 'theological', 'questions', 'families', 'might', 'wish', 'discuss', 'children', 'questions', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'answered', 'human', 'terms', 'should', 'be', 'deeply', 'thought', 'people', 'faith']",N/A

176907,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,1424810248,a voice of reason,"[5, 6]","First and foremost, I want to applaud Alex Kendrick and Sherwood Baptist Church for not only making such a wholesome movie but also for depicting what a difference faith in Jesus Christ makes in a believer's life. When Coach Taylor shows his wife what he has written down about his new approach to coaching his football team, she says that all of the items on his list are applicable to the rest of life as well; thus, football becomes a metaphor for life in this movie. And the relevance of God and His word to our lives is, I believe, one of the two central messages of this movie. The second primary message is that we are to praise Him when we `win' (that is, when things go our way) and praise Him when we don't `win' (when things are not going our way).God turns lives around through the way He can work in them once people have come not only to faith but also to trust in Jesus, and the movie gives many excellent examples of this: the coach who refuses to give up in the face of personal and professional adversity, his wife who endures repeated disappointments, his team that gets on board with his new philosophy, the teenager who decides to respect his father, etc. The changes in attitude that we see in so many of the characters in this movie cannot help but result in more positive outcomes in life and make us realize, as is stated throughout the film, that nothing is impossible with God; to quote the late Rich Mullins, ""What trouble are giants?/What's wrong with being small?/The bigger they come/You know the harder they fall./When you're fighting for Zion/And you're on the Lord's side,/I think you're gonna find/It ain't no trouble at all.""If there is a flaw in this movie - and I am reluctant to nitpick at such a wonderful film - it is that every believer in the movie `wins'. (Before anyone accuses me of having too little faith, let me say that I am walking evidence of what God can accomplish in a believer's life, but I am not perfect and not everything in life goes my way [and this is true of every believer I know]). There is danger in the idea that everyone will have `health and wealth' if only they trust in Jesus. Coach Taylor receiving a new truck (from an anonymous parent) and a pay-raise in the middle of the school year are nice touches, but they are examples of such thinking. That being said, I am by no means accusing filmmaker Alex Kendrick of presenting a `health and wealth gospel' message; he has clearly made an uplifting film about people who live out their faith (and I feel certain about Kendrick's intentions because I also have the DVD of his previous film, ""Flywheel"", which contains a fantastic evangelistic message - if you liked this movie, you should check out ""Flywheel"" as well).Some reviewers have had negative comments about the acting in the film, but I thought the characters were simply real and believable - they are just like people I know (and like me), and that makes this story far more effective than it would be with slick performances from Hollywood stars. As far as the football plot is concerned, the story is - of course -  about an underdog team that overcomes all odds on its way to the championship. The ending is predictable, but we viewers would not want it any other way. The nice difference between this movie and others in the sports genre, however, is that it is faith-based and can be watched without fear of profanity or vulgarity.

I very much enjoyed this movie and I thought it was touching and beautiful. While at the same time it seemed a bit unrealistic. I agree with those who say it seems like it depicts God as a Santa Claus. God does do great things in people's lives don't get me wrong. I myself have seen him work in great ways in my own life. However, I have also had moments where I felt at the end of my rope and felt like life was crumby since following God. I feel like this film shows that once you give your life to God everything is perfect instantly.I think it would have been more impressive to see the coach and everyone starting to change their attitudes and stick it through with their faith before things got poured on them so it would show that God was really working in them and they weren't just changing because of what God does and not who he is. I mean the coach was all down and out and then when he starts getting all these blessings his faith soars. I understand that he turned to God before he started receiving the blessings. However, like I said it would have been better to see like his wife changing her attitude about not having a baby and him changing his attitude and trusting God to do HIS plan instead of seeing them blossom when things went according to THEIR plans. I think that would have shown the audience christian and non-christians that God is worthy of praise even in hard times and that when you have him in your life, you can not only smile when he's pouring out the blessings, but you can smile and rejoice even in a storm.God is not just our genie he is also the source of our comfort and he sustains us in hard times. Many people can change and praise God when he starts giving us our way. But, what about having joy and trusting him and praising him through trials? In real life, he doesn't always work when and how we want him. In fact, sometimes he shows us he has something better or something different for us in his plans and changes our hearts to see our situations how he does. In this film everyone got what they wanted, when they wanted, and how they wanted. God even says in his word that following him is not easyI just feel like this movie sent a message that if you give your life to God and life doesn't automatically do a 180 you might as well give up. The fact of the matter is God gives and he takes. There's good days and bad days.Also I feel that the gospel message seemed very spoon-fed. I mean I don't think they should have left it out, but they could have done something that leaves the audience (particularly non-saved people) asking questions and thinking leading them to want to seek God more.

Long,"[1, 1]","People that review this movie negatively (which do also include some Christians), usually are based on the belief that this movie is all about showcasing that once you become a Christian and trust Christ, everything in your life becomes perfect.I do understand those thoughts and I had similar thoughts/concerns when watching, but I decided the issue came down to the question of what message the filmmakers were trying to convey. If they were trying to convey a message that everything goes smoothly in life here when you follow Christ, then I would agree that there's a problem.But in giving it consideration, I have mostly concluded that really wasn't the message they were trying to convey: the message was that when you follow Christ, nothing is impossible - that there is nothing impossible with God - and that with faith in God (and living an ""excellent"" life - i.e. the ""works"" part of the ""faith without works is dead"" thing) and when you desire for God to get the glory, that God is able to do beyond what we could even imagine.That message was the clear message of the movie. But in order to show that message in a movie-format, they pretty much had to show a bunch of hard/impossible-looking situations that became better when Christ was put at the center. A side-effect of doing that is it could give the impression that everything always goes A-OK in this life for believers that are really following Christ and want Him to get all the glory, which many of us know is not reality. But the movie never really says that - in fact, by the simple fact that the team in the movie continually makes a decision to praise God *whether* they win or lose, shows that they realize they might not win the games even with ""doing everything the best they could for God"" etc.To to sum up: I would say that if you watch this movie and think the message is that all goes okay in this life for Christians who have enough faith, then I would tell you that message is not an accurate one.  But I would also say that that message as far as I can tell really wasn't the intended message of the movie, but rather a byproduct (perhaps somewhat unfortunate) of the intended message which I believe to be a solid, worthwhile one of having Christ at the center of your life in all you do, and that He can do *anything*. If you take this movie at face-value for those messages and avoid reading in any other supposedly ""implied"" messages (i.e. avoid applying messages that the movie really wasn't actively promoting), I believe you will find it to be an excellent film. Given the fact that the movie does perhaps raise some of these questions though - and can actually unintentionally hit nerves with some people on subjects like infertility - this is an EXCELLENT conversation piece among family/friends/church groups after watching this movie!As far as the quality of the film itself: This movie was made on a shoestring budget with a lot of volunteer actors, and while you can definitely tell that, it does NOT really take away from the movie too much.  You will certainly not confuse the production quality of this movie with some Hollywood-produced film, but it is sufficient.

Among the thousands of mainline films I have watched over many years, this is the first I've seen with a modern-day story that was unapologetically Christian. It actually used Jesus and God's name as you would hear in a sermon in church. Of course, the fact that ""Hollywood"" didn't make this film is understandable; it was produced, directed, written, etc., by a Baptist church in Georgia.But - surprise -  it has the production values of a big-budget Hollywood film. In other words, this looks nice and, for the most part, is adequately acted even though amateurs do the acting. The only one I thought sounded wooden, unfortunately, was Alex Kendrick playing the main character: coach Grant Taylor, the Shiloh Christian High School football coach. Kendrik directed and wrote this film, so kudos to him for all that wonderful work....but an actor, he ain't.Yes, the story is hokey, especially at the end at the last football game, but what Hollywood movie isn't?  To see a movie with this many inspirational and profound Biblical statements was a ""revelation"" and really nice to see (hear). Hokey or not, there are several moments in this film that should drive most viewers to tears. The main message of the movie: ""All things are possible with God,"" is a good one and one everyone, including Christians, need to be reminded of periodically.Secular people who don't want to hear anything positive about God or the Bible, or who are just plain biased against Christians, will hate this film and wouldn't last 30 minutes watching it.

I viewed this film more as entertainment than a sermon or gospel message. I read some reviews that said that God doesn't bless people in this way. How can one person determine how God is going to bless other individuals? Just because God doesn't choose to work in your life in this way doesn't mean He won't bless someone else. God is clear that He will bless whom He chooses. But, enough about doctrine. I like this movie because our entire family can watch it together. There is no foul language or sex scenes that cause us to need to escort my very young children out the room. If you are looking for a film that will preach, this is probably not for you. If you have a specific theology and you can not bear to hear anyone believe something different from you - again this is not the movie for you. If you enjoy watching movies with your family and would like a fun movie with good humor and an inspiring message - this is the movie for you. My husband even got past seeing the Bulldogs coach (we are a GT family) and still wanted to buy this movie (we had rented it through Netflix).Why 4 and not 5 stars? Because it does move a little slow in the beginning and there are a couple predictable parts. It is still better than 90% of the films produced in the past 10 years. So, I highly recommend this neat movie.

This is a movie about overcoming great obstacles, something every family faces.#2.  This is a movie that does not rely on sex, violence, or profanity to carry a weak or boring plot.#3.  This is a movie that examines the relationships between family members, and offers sound Biblical advice on how to make those relationships more successful.#4.  This is a movie void of famous actors with large egos to build upon, which means cast was able to focus on the overall production and not worry about the performance of one actor or actress.#5.  This is a film that stirs all kinds of emotions and can definitely clean out clogged up tearducts.#6.  This is a movie with some great football action scenes that rival any larger, Hollywood, big-budget film.#7.  This is a movie written and produced by Christians dedicated to their work of reaching out to a lost world with the message of hope and love.#8.  This is a movie that celebrates the power of the human spirit to rise above what we think is possible.#9.

There were some surprises, but I found myself drawn in by the combination of tensions that climax in a 'typical' football movie.  The Christian theme is simple, powerful and refreshing.  I've watched this movie twice this week, bought a copy for my family to watch with me, and will probably show it to our church sometime this year.The reasons I like this movie are:There are no famous hollywood actors!  Yet it is still fun to watch.Hundreds of people volunteered to help make this movie.It has no profanity.  No sex scenes.The production is really pretty good.There are a number of one liners that are actually worth writng down.The don't give up theme could help people who are facing discouragement of almost any kind.  This is a good movie to show cancer patients or people trying to have children, or people who are struggling with a rough financial or marriage situation, or just about any kind of situation that seems hopeless.  It teaches you to cry out to God and to praise Him no matter what happens in life, win or lose.  It's a great coaches training tool for any sports coach.My favorite theme in this movie is: Give God your best and praise Him whether you win or lose.The little credit scenes after the movie are some of the best ones because you feel like these guys who made this movie are just a bunch of regular Americans who love God.Go for it on this movie.  You will love it.  I actually cried towards the end, as cheesy as it sounds, but I was deeply touched.  I rarely cry in movies (once every fifteen years or so).I think God inspired this movie.  I hope you get touched by Him as you watch it.",5,A really good movie for all ages or any family to watch,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,1750,"[""'m"", '46', 'yr', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'rarely', 'movies', 'most', 'plot', 'movie', 'figured', 'out', 'start', 'sort', 'were', 'surprises', 'found', 'drawn', 'combination', 'tensions', 'climax', ""'typical"", 'football', 'movie', 'Christian', 'theme', 'simple', 'powerful', 'refreshing', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'week', 'bought', 'copy', 'family', 'watch', 'will', 'probably', 'show', 'church', 'sometime', 'year.The', 'reasons', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'are', 'famous', 'hollywood', 'actors', 'still', 'fun', 'watch.Hundreds', 'people', 'volunteered', 'help', 'make', 'movie.It', 'profanity', 'sex', 'scenes.The', 'production', 'really', 'pretty', 'are', 'number', 'one', 'liners', 'are', 'actually', 'worth', 'writng', 'down.The', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'theme', 'could', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'facing', 'discouragement', 'almost', 'kind', 'good', 'movie', 'show', 'cancer', 'patients', 'people', 'trying', 'have', 'children', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'rough', 'financial', 'marriage', 'situation', 'just', 'kind', 'situation', 'hopeless', 'cry', 'out', 'God', 'praise', 'Him', 'matter', 'what', 'life', 'win', 'lose', 'great', 'coaches', 'training', 'tool', 'sports', 'coach.My', 'favorite', 'theme', 'movie', 'Give', 'God', 'best', 'praise', 'Him', 'win', 'lose.The', 'little', 'credit', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'best', 'ones', 'feel', 'guys', 'who', 'made', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'bunch', 'regular', 'Americans', 'who', 'love', 'God.Go', 'movie', 'will', 'love', 'actually', 'cried', 'end', 'as', 'cheesy', 'was', 'deeply', 'touched', 'rarely', 'cry', 'movies', 'once', 'fifteen', 'years', 'so', '.I', 'think', 'God', 'inspired', 'movie', 'hope', 'get', 'touched', 'Him', 'watch']",N/A

I have never heard clapping by the audience in a movie theater before, but when this movie ended the almost full theater was filled with clapping.  I personally thought this was a great movie, eventhough other reviews I read thought it was corny.  It would have been better if it were really based on a true story.  The story is plausible eventhough there are incredible odds to be overcome both at home and on the field. I was a little disappointed to find out it was not based on a true story.I'm not a big sports fan.  I can enjoy a football game if I'm watching it with someone who enjoys football, unless it is the LSU Tigers or the New Orleans Saints whom I don't mind watching by my lonesome.  I doubt the Saints will ever have a championship team, unless the majority of the players and the coach become real saints each with their own personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.  Do You Believe in Miracles? I do!  And, remember ""The Story of the 1980 U.S. Hockey Team.""Would I watch Facing the Giants again?

This is a story of a down on his luck coach,Grant Taylor, and his football team the Shiloh Eagles. It seems as if this team is convinced it is mediocre at best coupled with a coaching staff that flat out does not believe in it's leader, Coach Grant. There are far more important things going on in Grant's life. One is his and his wifes inability to have children. Put together with a lemon of a car, a community with an utter lack of faith, and a group of students fathers and staff that doesn't believe he has what it takes to win...or be a leader. He is looked at as a loser. One of the turning points of the movie is when god fearing man comes to him at his school office and reads a very powerful scripture from the book of REVELATIONS to him and tells him God wants him here to coach this team. Thru faith Grant opens his Bible and reads the word and asks for God's guidence and blessings. As always god hears all prayers and shows Grant the way to motivate his team. He reaches out to Brock(a Lineman who is more interested in being the class clown) and challenges him to reach deep inside his heart to channel his obvious abilty to be the teams leader. In the true turning point of the movie Brock is asked to do a crawl with a teammate on back for 30 yards then 50 yards and he gives everything he has in his heart and soul and with Coach Grant every bit of the way with him, challenging him to continue, Brock brings the whole team to their feet when he finally collapses and Takes off the blindfold put on by his coach not to hinder him by a visual of where he was at on the field he realizes that he has went the length of the entire field ...100 yards! Seeing this the team responds by coming together and turning to their faith in God to lead them through sport and life. This is a movie with a far greater message then winning football games. It says that with God, anything is possible! With faith nothing is unobtainable. This movement of faith vibrates through the entire school and eventually the community. It causes sons and fathers to come together, families to give all faith to God and just believe, and most of all shows that nothing is impossible through faith in God. I will not give away the ending because i encourage everyone who reads this to PLEASE watch this movie and recomend it to a friend and all who you love.

I sat down to watch the DVD not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by this winsome little gem.Yes, some of the supporting performances are pretty wooden (although the lead actors do a great job), and yes, the overall plot is standard sports-underdog fare, but somehow it all works.  Alex Kendrick and Shannen Fields (who play the coach and his wife, respectively) and the two assistant coaches (played by Chris Willis & Tracy Goode) make their characters so likeable and sympathetic that you can't help but root for them.The story itself is indeed fairly predictable, but the dialogue sounds natural, and there is enough humor to keep things from getting maudlin.  I found several scenes very stirring, especially the one where the coach shows the team what ""giving your best"" actually means by taking one player aside and pushing him to achieve more than he ever thought possible.  The football action is also good, and doesn't look over-produced.Some may criticize the story for implying that if you surrender to God's will all your problems will be fixed in a jiffy.  The obstacles and trials faced by the main characters do seem to be resolved a bit too neatly, but the filmakers also point out (in another moving scene, BTW), that we should thank God, love Him, and surrender to His will even when things DON'T seem to be going our way.I think 2 Chronicles 16:9 sums up the message of this film: ""For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.""  ""Facing the Giants"" is an excellent illustration of how God has to sometimes bring us through trials to strip away the things we clutch so tightly.  He's not trying to deprive us; He just wants us to trust Him above all else.  Too often, though, our disobedience and lack of faith get in the way of His blessing.  Coach Taylor's circumstances only begin to turn around after he humbles himself and turns to the Lord in complete trust.  ""Facing the Giants""  teaches a valuable lesson for all believers, even if it does lay it on a bit thick.A film with its heart in the right place, ""Facing the Giants"" overcomes its shoestring budget and rates as a solid four out of five stars.",4,Uplifting & encouraging film,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,2365,"['Most', 'reviews', 'read', 'seeing', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'focused', 'film', 'amateur', 'actors', 'predictable', 'plot', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'DVD', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'winsome', 'little', 'gem.Yes', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'wooden', 'lead', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'yes', 'overall', 'plot', 'standard', 'sports-underdog', 'fare', 'somehow', 'works', 'Alex', 'Kendrick', 'Shannen', 'Fields', 'who', 'play', 'coach', 'wife', 'respectively', 'two', 'assistant', 'coaches', 'played', 'Chris', 'Willis', 'Tracy', 'Goode', 'make', 'characters', 'so', 'likeable', 'sympathetic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'them.The', 'story', 'indeed', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'dialogue', 'natural', 'enough', 'humor', 'keep', 'things', 'getting', 'maudlin', 'found', 'several', 'scenes', 'very', 'stirring', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'coach', 'team', 'what', 'giving', 'best', 'actually', 'taking', 'one', 'player', 'aside', 'pushing', 'achieve', 'more', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible', 'football', 'action', 'also', 'good', ""n't"", 'look', 'over-produced.Some', 'may', 'criticize', 'story', 'implying', 'surrender', 'God', 'will', 'all', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'fixed', 'jiffy', 'obstacles', 'trials', 'faced', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'seem', 'be', 'resolved', 'bit', 'too', 'neatly', 'filmakers', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'moving', 'scene', 'BTW', 'should', 'thank', 'God', 'love', 'Him', 'surrender', 'will', 'even', 'when', 'things', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'way.I', 'think', '2', 'Chronicles', '16:9', 'sums', 'message', 'film', 'eyes', 'LORD', 'run', 'fro', 'whole', 'earth', 'shew', 'strong', 'behalf', 'heart', 'perfect', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'excellent', 'illustration', 'how', 'God', 'sometimes', 'bring', 'trials', 'strip', 'away', 'things', 'clutch', 'so', 'tightly', 'not', 'trying', 'deprive', 'just', 'trust', 'Him', 'else', 'Too', 'often', 'though', 'disobedience', 'lack', 'faith', 'get', 'way', 'blessing', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'circumstances', 'only', 'begin', 'turn', 'around', 'Lord', 'complete', 'trust', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'believers', 'even', 'lay', 'bit', 'thick.A', 'film', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'rates', 'solid', 'four', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

This is a case in point.This movie is basically a Christian movie, in that it is taken from a Christian point of view.  The writers, directors, and producers were Christian, and so were the characters.  If this offends you or turns you off, this movie is probably not your movie, though I would encourage you to be more open-minded and tolerant (which is what Christians hear a lot, but is no less true with some non-Christians).One unique thing about this movie:  It was made by a local church, which is one reason you don't see any familiar faces.  So what are the negatives as a result of a church doing this instead of a big Hollywood studio?  Well, the story is predictable . . . but then, that is also true of a lot of Hollywood movies.  Well, there's no graphic sex and violence . . . but then, I consider that a plus, which I wish Hollywood would imitate.  Well, there are no car-chases or explosions . . . but then, the purpose of this movie is to inspire your hearts and minds, not to dazzle your eyes with special effects.Having said that, the test of whether this movie succeeds in its goal is the impact it makes on you.  Its goal is to increase your faith in God to do His job, and to encourage you to do your part, which is to seek Him and obey Him.  It also is clear that God won't always do things our way.  I cannot speak for you . . . you need to watch the movie and see if it affects you.  It did affect me, giving me hope and motivation in my life.One last comment.

""Giants"" is a sweet football movie proclaiming the message that with God, everything is possible. High school football coach Grant Taylor (played with heart and emotion by Alex Kendrick) is a man whose life is falling apart. Professionally, he can't get his team to win. He and his wife Brooke are having no luck conceiving a child. And with every loss, the parents of his team are getting more and more mutinous. Also, his car is a dud and he is hardly making ends meet financially. Seemingly at the end of his rope, he decides to re-examine his (and his team's) goals and to align himself with God's plans. Win or lose, he will give God the glory.Set in a Christian school, the film keeps religion in the background for the first 40 minutes. But then, like a biblical deluge, industrial-strength faith talk makes a sudden appearance and never leaves. Religious people may think this is as it should be. But I felt like I had been involved in a bait-and-switch operation, one that interfered with what was a fairly interesting (if predictable) story with sympathetic characters.

HANSSEN,"[3, 5]","I think that it is a marvelous idea to have a film that inspires you to face your personal giants in your life, and we need more films coming out that deal with these positive, uplifting themes.  However, I felt that this film was a bit too ""preachy"" and actually contained too many wrong messages about faith.  When Jesus was here on Earth, he spoke about the benefits that God's Kingdom would bring, yet he never got ""preachy"" with anyone and, quite frankly, everyone felt comfortable around him.  In fact, the least likely people one would think actually became Christians.  Jesus even told the corrupt religious leaders of the day that the harlots were going ahead of them to the Kingdom.  This film, I felt, contained way too much preachy propaganda and also one must realize also that God could care less about whether a sports team wins or not.  Such things are rather quite trivial in comparison to what REALLY needs to be taken care of here on Earth, like starving children under a cruel dictator.  It's quite obvious that God cares about answering prayers of those children rather than helping a football team win.That being said, I did feel that there was a good message to the film about not giving up and persevering.  Nothing wrong with those themes.However, I felt ""We Are Marshall"" was so much better in dealing with sprirituality and the triumph of the human spirit.

177029,A3F9VH8916IA40,1424810248,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[5, 18]","I have the feeling that most people reviewing this film are reviewing it on the fact that it's a ""Christian"" film and that it was done by some church with mostly local actors instead of on the films actual quality. I also have the feeling that once i post this review I will get a stream of not helpful votes and comments from well meaning people telling me how wrong I am and how much I need god to change my heart of stone. Well, I'll just have to take that risk because I cannot take anymore of this moronic babble. This movie IS NOT THAT GOOD!!!!! its noRemember the Titans (Director's Cut), it's noRudy (Special Edition), and it's noRadio.Since this movie came out, I've heard nothing but praise for it from my church. ""Oh, it's great,"" or ""it's an inspiration"" and when I said I had no desire to see it, I get called heartless. HEARTLESS! For not wanting to see this movie and it turns out I had reason to.Almost every Christian movie that comes out is cheesy, and this is no exception. the actors are bad, I don't care if they are local actors they suck and that's all that matters, the script was horrible, and the message was just the same old same old you get from a million movies like this. Everyone, even people I love and respect, keeps telling me how amazing it is, but it IS NOT. So let me break it down a bit.---THE GOOD---I'll start with some good stuff before ripping into this movie, and yes there IS some good stuff here. First off, although the acting for the most part was subpar, it did have its moments. One part I remember is when the coach tells one of his players to pick up another and carry him across the field on his knees while blindfolded. This scene is amazing, plain and simple, and has some of the best acting in a sports movie I've ever seen.The second thing I likes was that there was a fare amount of hummer in this film. Not a whole lot mind you, but it did have its moments. These two things were enough for me to give this movie three stars, maybe i was being too lenient but three stars sounds fair to me.---THE BAD---ACTING. To put it simply, it's bad. I KNOW that they were using local actors, I KNOW that it was a low budget movie, and I KNOW that it was all done by some church in Georgia, but really people, I've seen lots of low budget movies that have better acting than this. These aren't real actors, their hacks.SUB PLOTS. The worst offence this movie has is its sub plot of David and his crippled dad. My goodness, you could not ask for a cheesier plot. this David character (just like King David in the Bible, duh. some dim witted person decided we weren't smart enough to figure that out) just moves to this new school and wants to play soccer just like any prick would but can't because they don't have a team. So, naturally, he wants to be the field goal kicker, only he's not any good. so his dad, his ever perfect loving caring flawless crippled dad who never speaks out of a monotone voice, looks like the bald guy from Who's Line is it Anyway, and never does anything wrong just like a real person (yeah right), tells him god loves him and that he can do anything if he just prays hard enough and believes in himself. Yeah... right... So in the end what do you think happens? Well, I'll tell you. The kicker gets hurt, so now David needs to kick the winning field goal to win the state championship. He goes ""I can't do it"" and the coach gives him a speech. Than his ""crippled"" dad stands up. Wow, I guess he was faking it the whole time. He kicks the winning field goal and they win the game. Hurray, David beat the evil giants, could this movie get any less subtle?""GOOD MESSIGE."" this is really the only thing people like about this movie. Its ""good message."" And what is the message people? God loves you, god will protect and care for you, god is good, yeah god, blah blah blah. look, I'm a Christian myself, but this its kids stuff that we all have to learn in Sunday school so we can get some candy as a reward. As adults we should expect more than this, but sadly this movie only spoon feeds us more baby food. Listen people, listen closely, cripples can't stand up, i've never seen it, and niether have you, they can't, thats why they never do, duh. People don't randomly come up to you and read you a bible verse, they don't. Students don't randomly get together and have a revival. They don't, especially in Christian schools that are often times worse than public schools.I haven't even talked about the cheesy ""evil"" opposing teams coach, the idiotic speeches, and the horrible game scenes they tried.

177059,A1DWBHREWE65TS,1424810248,"MacGyver ""With God, ALL things are possible!""","[25, 28]","Matthew 19:26 is a theme for this incredible movie in more ways than one.  ""Facing the Giants"" is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen- period.  True, it's not based on a true story- but it is based on the truth of God's Word!  This movie is great for everyone who loves to see the underdog win (and who doesn't?).  But the important thing here is not just that the underdog wins- but how they win.Coach Grant Taylor has the unenviable job of turning around a losing football team at a Christian high school.  He also has a car that's about to fall apart, a house that smells for some reason, and he and his wife both have been longing to have a baby for a long while to no avail.  He also finds out that one of his star players has transferred to another school, as many seniors have been doing so they can have a better shot at college scholarships.And while he's dealing with all this going into the new football season, he overhears a secret board meeting where it's been decided that if he doesn't start winning, he's out of his position.Faced with all this, Coach Taylor is driven to the only place he can go- to his knees in prayer.  And he soon finds that the way to win is playing by God's standards.  When he commits himself and his team to play all for the glory of God- he finds out the truth that God honors those who honor Him!Outside of the ""Jesus"" movie and ""The Passion of the Christ"" and others that are specifically portraying Biblical events, this is one of the few movies I've seen that actually portrays a Christian who is NOT a hypocrite and actually lives what he says he believes.  And one of the few movies I've seen where the Coach reads from The Bible- Psalms 18:1-2 ""The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.""  (AWESOME!)And yes, straight up- this movie talks about Jesus Christ and the importance of having a personal relationship with Him.  It tells you how simple it is to do that by doing what Romans 10:13 says- ""If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.""AND it doesn't come on like a heavy metal band screaming it in your face.  It comes on tempered with love and care in a more gentle manner.It is SO refreshing to see a movie about Christians who live out their faith and aren't hypocrites and who aren't bigots.  It's so awesome to see a movie where people can talk about how much they love Jesus and are actually inspiring and encouraging- not some weirdo freak.And it's incredible to think of how a Christian church in Georgia put together this movie with a budget of $100,000 and used volunteer actors from the church and area- with a nice cameo by the University of Georgia head football coach.  I know some people are going to argue it's not heavy-laden with the special effects and top actors- but it is heavy-laden with real heart and a real deep meaning- and that's what's most important to me.The theme of the movie and how the underdog football team started triumphing is also the theme of how the movie was made.  As I said at the start, it's all about Matthew 19:26 and an attitude of praising God in all circumstances.  ""When we win- we praise Him. When we lose- we praise Him.""  Give it your best and trust God with the rest.  That's not only true for football, but for life in general.  Don't be a wimp in the game of life- live life to the fullest as Jesus promised us in John 10:10.Don't be afraid- Face your giants!""With God, ALL things are possible""!

177064,A1PYHWUZ5SRBTI,1424810248,Matthew P. Cochrane,"[1, 2]","I first heard about the film Facing the Giants from a good friend at church. My friend said he thoroughly enjoyed the movie about the lessons a high school football coach and his team learn during the struggles and triumphs of a season. Ever the optimist, I tucked the information away in the back of my head but thought the movie would be nothing more than a washed down presentation of the gospel and another lesson in mediocrity. I was wrong.When I finally got around to watching Facing the Giants I was pleasantly surprised by its open and explicit Christian message but was shocked by the quality of the acting, script and production. The story revolves around Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick), a football coach at a small Christian school in Georgia. The movie opens on the last game of the season with Taylor's Shiloh Eagles losing a close game, closing out another disappointing season. The story quickly fast forwards to beginning of the next fall's practice when Taylor learns that his star player has left the team to play for Shiloh's archrival.Things quickly go from bad to worse. Taylor's team opens the new season with three straight losses. A group of parents start lobbying for Taylor's replacement by one of his assistant coaches, Brady Owens (Tracy Goode). At home, Taylor faces another set of problems. Grant and his wife, Brooke (Shannen Fields), have been trying to have a child for years. A trip to the doctor reveals that Grant might be physiologically unable to fulfill this wish. Financial struggles for the Taylors are also present (something I'm sure a lot of families in ministry can relate to). Their one car is constantly breaking down and, in an especially poignant scene, Grant Taylor must ask for help to jumpstart his car after another close loss from one of the parents lobbying for his dismissal!Finally, amidst these trials, Grant realizes that he has turned his focus away from God. He renews his focus on God and replaces his ""winning is everything"" mantra with an emphasis on Biblical and character lessons (remember he coaches at a private school).As he begins to preach these lessons he begins winning the trust of his team back. With the renewed support of his team, Grant leads the Shiloh Eagles on a winning streak that earns the team a berth in the playoffs. Once there, they continue to win until they face the Richland Giants for the state championship. Through victory and defeat, Coach Taylor continues to emphasize to his players that they must praise God in all circumstances.Despite the film's surprising quality there are still several elements that could have used improving. First and foremost, the championship game was scripted as if the writers of the movie had absolutely no knowledge of the game of football. The opposing coach's strategy was so inexplicably bad it would have warranted an immediate job dismissal if it had taken place in real life. Nothing about the Giants' strategy in the championship game made any sense. Most frustrating of all, this could have been fixed with a few minor tweaks to the film's script.There were other minor problems with the movie, too, but none that I wouldn't have also easily forgiven in a big Hollywood release. Even Remember the Titans, the major Disney high school football release starring Denzel Washington a few years back, featured similar flaws in its scripted version of the championship game.Alex Kendrick did a great job writing, directing and starring in this feature-length film. Produced on an amazingly low budget, the film featured almost an entire cast and crew of volunteers. Kendrick, an associate pastor at Sherwood Baptist Church in Georgia, mentioned to his senior pastor one day that he would like to make movies in the future but quickly confessed that he knew that would not be possible at his current position. His senior pastor asked him, ""Why not?"" Sherwood Baptist Church quickly formed Sherwood Pictures and the rest is history. The congregation rallied around the cause by volunteering countless hours helping to film the picture and providing virtually all the acting roles -major and minor alike.",3,"Decent Movie, Better Message",1244073600,"06 4, 2009",2009,4129,"['first', 'heard', 'film', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'good', 'friend', 'church', 'friend', 'said', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lessons', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'coach', 'team', 'learn', 'struggles', 'triumphs', 'season', 'Ever', 'optimist', 'tucked', 'information', 'away', 'back', 'head', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'washed', 'down', 'presentation', 'gospel', 'lesson', 'mediocrity', 'was', 'wrong.When', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'open', 'explicit', 'Christian', 'message', 'was', 'shocked', 'quality', 'acting', 'script', 'production', 'story', 'around', 'Grant', 'Taylor', 'Alex', 'Kendrick', 'football', 'coach', 'small', 'Christian', 'school', 'Georgia', 'movie', 'last', 'game', 'season', 'Taylor', 'Shiloh', 'Eagles', 'losing', 'close', 'game', 'closing', 'out', 'disappointing', 'season', 'story', 'quickly', 'fast', 'forwards', 'beginning', 'next', 'fall', 'practice', 'when', 'Taylor', 'star', 'player', 'left', 'team', 'play', 'Shiloh', 'archrival.Things', 'quickly', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Taylor', 'team', 'new', 'season', 'three', 'straight', 'losses', 'group', 'parents', 'start', 'lobbying', 'Taylor', 'replacement', 'one', 'assistant', 'coaches', 'Brady', 'Owens', 'Tracy', 'Goode', 'home', 'Taylor', 'set', 'problems', 'Grant', 'wife', 'Brooke', 'Shannen', 'Fields', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'have', 'child', 'years', 'trip', 'doctor', 'Grant', 'might', 'be', 'physiologically', 'unable', 'fulfill', 'wish', 'Financial', 'struggles', 'Taylors', 'are', 'also', 'present', 'something', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'families', 'ministry', 'can', 'relate', 'one', 'car', 'constantly', 'breaking', 'down', 'especially', 'poignant', 'scene', 'Grant', 'Taylor', 'must', 'ask', 'help', 'jumpstart', 'car', 'close', 'loss', 'one', 'parents', 'lobbying', 'dismissal', 'Finally', 'trials', 'Grant', 'turned', 'focus', 'away', 'God', 'focus', 'God', 'winning', 'everything', 'mantra', 'emphasis', 'Biblical', 'character', 'lessons', 'remember', 'private', 'school', '.As', 'preach', 'lessons', 'winning', 'trust', 'team', 'back', 'renewed', 'support', 'team', 'Grant', 'Shiloh', 'Eagles', 'winning', 'streak', 'team', 'berth', 'playoffs', 'Once', 'there', 'continue', 'win', 'face', 'Richland', 'Giants', 'state', 'championship', 'victory', 'defeat', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'emphasize', 'players', 'must', 'praise', 'God', 'circumstances.Despite', 'film', 'surprising', 'quality', 'are', 'still', 'several', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'improving', 'First', 'foremost', 'championship', 'game', 'was', 'scripted', 'writers', 'movie', 'had', 'absolutely', 'knowledge', 'game', 'football', 'opposing', 'coach', 'strategy', 'was', 'so', 'inexplicably', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'warranted', 'immediate', 'job', 'dismissal', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'real', 'life', 'Nothing', 'Giants', 'strategy', 'championship', 'game', 'made', 'sense', 'Most', 'frustrating', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'few', 'minor', 'tweaks', 'film', 'script.There', 'were', 'other', 'minor', 'problems', 'movie', 'too', 'none', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'also', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'release', 'Even', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'major', 'Disney', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'release', 'starring', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'featured', 'similar', 'flaws', 'scripted', 'version', 'championship', 'game.Alex', 'Kendrick', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'writing', 'directing', 'starring', 'feature-length', 'film', 'Produced', 'amazingly', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'featured', 'almost', 'entire', 'cast', 'crew', 'volunteers', 'Kendrick', 'associate', 'pastor', 'Sherwood', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'Georgia', 'mentioned', 'senior', 'pastor', 'one', 'day', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'movies', 'future', 'quickly', 'confessed', 'knew', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'current', 'position', 'senior', 'pastor', 'asked', 'Why', 'not', 'Sherwood', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'quickly', 'formed', 'Sherwood', 'Pictures', 'rest', 'history', 'congregation', 'rallied', 'cause', 'volunteering', 'countless', 'hours', 'helping', 'film', 'picture', 'providing', 'virtually', 'acting', 'roles', '-major', 'minor', 'alike']",N/A

Let me begin with the horrible acting job that these 'actors' did. The opposing coach was meant to be some aversive character, yet he was just a fat guy yelling obvious stuff and had a sucker in his mouth the whole time.The head coach of the team lacked a football personality, there was no big half-time speech ,there was just stupid rambling on the side. The guy in a wheel chair just seemed like he was overacting.The football scenes were awful, it was like these kids had never played before in the lives. Most of it was done so poorly and it wasn't even about football.This is nothing like Remember the Titans or Friday Night Lights.

177071,A98HYSJHLWGF5,1424810248,MICHAEL OBRIEN,"[1, 1]","The many positive reviews have eloquently explained the strengths of this extraordinary film.  I thought I would respond to some of the negative reviewers who suggest that this film was not reflective of life, and that a film, to be realistic, must show prayers failing, things going wrong, etc., with faith persisting through the calamity.  However, that view has components which could be considered to be just as defeatist as the failure-prone mindset which the coach in this film confronted in his football players.  Matthew 17:20 states, ""If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible unto you.""  If this verse be true, then the only variable affecting whether or not miracles happen is whether or not one actually does have confidence that they will come to pass.  This film depicted a determined individual with a profound and pure faith deciding that he and his team could move a mountain, and, surprise, surprise, they moved it.  While it is true that our faith may prove to be insufficient far more often than we prefer, it is also true that there are moments of true inspiration in which a confident determination does move mountains.  This is a movie about one of those times.  There is nothing unreal about it at all.  Exceptional, yes, unreal, not at all.  Further no one who considers that the above verse is true can dismiss this film as unreal.  This film depicts the way that it is supposed to be, the way that we are supposed to be, all the time.  Because it can be shown that many of us, maybe even most of us, are not that way anywhere near all the time is no reason at all to chide the makers of this film for asking us to reach out for that goal.  While it can be inspirational to see the human spirit persisting and remaining unchanged in the face of adversity, it is equally important if not more important to see people making it all the way, people reaching for the highest standard and attaining it.  Films like this help to make the world a better place by showing us that if our minds and hearts are in the right place, we can attain our greatest goals no matter how daunting they might seem.",5,A pure determination can accomplish anything,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,2237,"['many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'have', 'eloquently', 'explained', 'strengths', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'thought', 'would', 'respond', 'negative', 'reviewers', 'who', 'suggest', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'reflective', 'life', 'film', 'be', 'realistic', 'must', 'show', 'prayers', 'failing', 'things', 'going', 'wrong', 'etc.', 'faith', 'persisting', 'calamity', 'However', 'view', 'components', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'defeatist', 'failure-prone', 'mindset', 'coach', 'film', 'confronted', 'football', 'players', 'Matthew', '17:20', 'states', 'ye', 'have', 'faith', 'grain', 'mustard', 'seed', 'ye', 'shall', 'say', 'mountain', 'remove', 'hence', 'yonder', 'place', 'shall', 'remove', 'nothing', 'shall', 'be', 'impossible', 'verse', 'be', 'true', 'then', 'only', 'variable', 'affecting', 'not', 'miracles', 'happen', 'not', 'one', 'actually', 'have', 'confidence', 'will', 'come', 'pass', 'film', 'depicted', 'determined', 'individual', 'profound', 'pure', 'faith', 'deciding', 'team', 'could', 'move', 'mountain', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'moved', 'true', 'faith', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'insufficient', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'prefer', 'also', 'true', 'are', 'moments', 'true', 'inspiration', 'confident', 'determination', 'move', 'mountains', 'movie', 'one', 'times', 'nothing', 'unreal', 'Exceptional', 'yes', 'unreal', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'above', 'verse', 'true', 'can', 'dismiss', 'film', 'unreal', 'film', 'way', 'supposed', 'be', 'way', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'shown', 'many', 'maybe', 'even', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'way', 'anywhere', 'time', 'reason', 'chide', 'makers', 'film', 'asking', 'reach', 'out', 'goal', 'can', 'be', 'inspirational', 'see', 'human', 'spirit', 'persisting', 'remaining', 'unchanged', 'face', 'adversity', 'equally', 'important', 'not', 'more', 'important', 'see', 'people', 'making', 'way', 'people', 'reaching', 'highest', 'standard', 'attaining', 'Films', 'help', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'showing', 'minds', 'hearts', 'are', 'right', 'place', 'can', 'attain', 'greatest', 'goals', 'matter', 'how', 'daunting', 'might', 'seem']",N/A

177085,A1129LM24YWSZV,1424810248,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[1, 1]","Facing the Giants is a movie about a high school football coach who inspires his players through his faith in God. While it would be easy to categorize this movie as just a religious flick, I think it's more than that.In the film, Coach Grant Taylor is having a rough time of it. His football team hasn't had a winning season in 6 years. There's a bad smell in his house. His car keeps breaking down. And he and his wife, Brooke, have been trying to conceive for 4 years, with no luck. Then, he discovers that parents of his own football players are trying to get him fired. And that HE'S the reason that he and Brooke can't conceive.Grant starts praying. And God answers, telling him to start with his football team and ""bloom where he's planted."" So Grant does. And things start happening. A new truck makes its way into Grant's life. He and his wife remove a dead animal under their house that's causing the smell. The team starts winning. Etcetera, etcetera.OK, now I know this sounds a little too pat. But it works. Why? Because the movie shows just how dramatic faith can be.Some caveats - While the actors playing Brooke and Grant Taylor are good, most of the rest of the cast clearly has little performing experience. The film could have benefitted ALOT from a more seasoned cast. Also, you can tell that the director is new to feature film. Some of the shots didn't work, particularly the scenes where Grant reads the Bible aloud (to himself) and prays aloud. I think that perhaps showing the words, having him praying to himself without hearing every word, etc., would have worked better here. Prayer is something very personal, and I realized while watching the movie that we rarely see depictions of people praying on film (other than the, ""Please God don't let him die,"" variety).Of course, there were some stilted moments as well. Another faculty member at the school comes to get him to show him what is happening on the football field. The faculty member launches into some rather lengthy explanations to bring both Grant and the audience ""up to speed."" I remember thinking, ""This is a movie. Don't keep trying to TELL us stuff. SHOW us. We're smart enough to figure it out.""All of that said, though, this is a very moving film. I really enjoyed it, and I think it demonstrates the power of faith in film. You CAN make a compelling, entertaining, dramatic, artistic movie about faith.

Not disappointed in the quality; it is adequate, even if the actors are all volunteers. Actually, I think they did a terrific job considering their lack of experience. It is certainly watchable. I have seen far, far away worse acting in huge budget movies. The plot is interesting, if not over worn. Even the fact that is was painfully predictable did not put me off- it is, after all, an 'underdog comes from behind' movie.To be fair, I would like to share what I liked about it.The photography is excellent, and the setting is believable for a small town in the south. Too, there's none of the teeth-gritting fake Southern accents film makers love to use just to make sure we know we're in the south. (Even my sons, who've lived outside the US as AF brats and visit family is SC every so often, commented that the accents sounded real)The characters are interesting. No one is very 'bad,' however the rival coach seems a bit cartoonish. There's no foul language and no sex. There is humor and kindness, and excellent role models for kids.The message is a good one: All things are possible with God.The less emphasized message is even better: Give God the praise, no matter the outcome of your prayers.This brings me to what bothered me about the film. This second, more important message was not illustrated. Prayers were answered beyond the characters' wildest dreams (in the most cliched manner possible, at that.)I know God works miracles, and Christ changes lives, however accepting His decisions, even when they are disappointing to us, is a situation we all face. Had the film shown this in at least about one situation, I believe it would have been a much stronger message and witness.And...more trivial, I know....I just can't get very worked up about winning a football game. Had the team lost, but left proud and confident because they did their very best and were thankful for the changes made in themselves and their lives, I would have felt much better about the message being given to my sons.Bottom line: A missed opportunity to show what is truly important.",3,"A good message, but ultimately troubling.",1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,2166,"['family', 'sons', '18', '15', 'watched', 'together', 'be', 'truthful', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Not', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'adequate', 'even', 'actors', 'are', 'volunteers', 'Actually', 'think', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'considering', 'lack', 'experience', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'have', 'seen', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'worse', 'acting', 'huge', 'budget', 'movies', 'plot', 'interesting', 'not', 'worn', 'Even', 'fact', 'was', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'off-', ""'underdog"", 'movie.To', 'be', 'fair', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'what', 'liked', 'it.The', 'photography', 'excellent', 'setting', 'believable', 'small', 'town', 'south', 'Too', 'none', 'teeth-gritting', 'fake', 'Southern', 'accents', 'film', 'makers', 'love', 'use', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'know', ""'re"", 'south', 'Even', 'sons', 'who', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'US', 'AF', 'brats', 'visit', 'family', 'SC', 'so', 'often', 'commented', 'accents', 'sounded', 'real', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'one', 'very', ""'bad"", 'however', 'rival', 'coach', 'bit', 'cartoonish', 'foul', 'language', 'sex', 'humor', 'kindness', 'excellent', 'role', 'models', 'kids.The', 'message', 'good', 'one', 'things', 'are', 'possible', 'God.The', 'emphasized', 'message', 'even', 'better', 'Give', 'God', 'praise', 'matter', 'outcome', 'prayers.This', 'what', 'bothered', 'film', 'second', 'more', 'important', 'message', 'was', 'not', 'illustrated', 'Prayers', 'were', 'answered', 'characters', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'most', 'cliched', 'manner', 'possible', 'know', 'God', 'miracles', 'Christ', 'changes', 'however', 'accepting', 'decisions', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'disappointing', 'situation', 'face', 'Had', 'film', 'shown', 'least', 'one', 'situation', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'stronger', 'message', 'witness.And', 'more', 'trivial', 'know', '.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'worked', 'up', 'winning', 'football', 'game', 'Had', 'team', 'lost', 'left', 'proud', 'confident', 'did', 'very', 'best', 'were', 'thankful', 'changes', 'made', 'lives', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'much', 'better', 'message', 'being', 'given', 'sons.Bottom', 'line', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'show', 'what', 'truly', 'important']",N/A

It has a little something for everyone - football for the sports fan in your family, touching drama,  humor, and most importantly, a strong message. It shows dependence on God and the importance of standing together in marriage, even when the world around you is falling apart.Coach Grant Taylor is going through some trials in his life. The school for which he is a coach wants to let him go because his football team fails to chalk up any wins.  His car barely runs and there are some maintenance problems in his home.  There's the possible betrayal of a close friend. Even more heartbreaking is the fact that he and his wife are facing infertility problems.  It's during this difficult time in his life that Grant realizes how much he depends on the Lord.  Grant spends time in prayer and in the Word, and gives the entire situation to God.  God, in turn, uses the situation to change more than just Grant's life.Several minor characters in this film deliver a strong impact. One is a school employee who walks by each locker daily and prays each student. Another character, a football player's father, is a Godly role model for his son and for those watching the film. A couple of football players have a change of heart in the movie and one makes a decision that impacts his life for eternity.On the cover of the DVD, the words at the bottom state: ""Never Give Up; Never Back Down; Never Lose Faith."" This movie delivers a touching and realistic look into the lives of a man struggling with the difficulties in life.  It's a winner in more ways than one and I highly recommend it for your next family night. I have added it to my mom-approved movie listings on my wordpress blog.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of 77 Ways Your Family Can Make a Difference.",5,Highly recommended for family night,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,1925,"['watched', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watched', 'again', 'just', 'past', 'weekend', 'Family', 'Night', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'football', 'sports', 'fan', 'family', 'touching', 'drama', 'humor', 'most', 'importantly', 'strong', 'message', 'dependence', 'God', 'importance', 'standing', 'together', 'marriage', 'even', 'when', 'world', 'falling', 'apart.Coach', 'Grant', 'Taylor', 'going', 'trials', 'life', 'school', 'coach', 'let', 'go', 'football', 'team', 'chalk', 'up', 'wins', 'car', 'barely', 'are', 'maintenance', 'problems', 'home', 'possible', 'betrayal', 'close', 'friend', 'Even', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'fact', 'wife', 'are', 'facing', 'infertility', 'problems', 'difficult', 'time', 'life', 'Grant', 'how', 'much', 'Lord', 'Grant', 'time', 'prayer', 'Word', 'entire', 'situation', 'God', 'God', 'turn', 'situation', 'change', 'more', 'just', 'Grant', 'life.Several', 'minor', 'characters', 'film', 'deliver', 'strong', 'impact', 'One', 'school', 'employee', 'who', 'locker', 'daily', 'student', 'character', 'football', 'player', 'father', 'Godly', 'role', 'model', 'son', 'watching', 'film', 'couple', 'football', 'players', 'have', 'change', 'heart', 'movie', 'one', 'decision', 'life', 'eternity.On', 'cover', 'DVD', 'words', 'bottom', 'state', 'Never', 'Give', 'Up', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', 'Never', 'Lose', 'Faith', 'movie', 'touching', 'realistic', 'look', 'lives', 'man', 'struggling', 'difficulties', 'life', 'winner', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'next', 'family', 'night', 'have', 'added', 'mom-approved', 'movie', 'listings', 'wordpress', 'blog.Reviewed', 'Penny', 'Zeller', 'Author', '77', 'Ways', 'Family', 'Can', 'Make', 'Difference']",N/A

The messages that all things are possible with God and no matter what the outcome, give God the praise and glory are great messages.  However, the ending seems neat and tidy.  I would've liked to have seen the team still have a losing season (as far as scoring goes), but a winning season in attitude and God and self-confidence.  To me, that would have been a stronger message.  Life can be harsh both for those who follow God/a higher power and those who don't.  So, it would have been nice to see a team who ""lost"" the season but kept their heads held high.

177147,A335YAUB8CMNUF,1424810248,The Actor,"[1, 2]","Overall, I was very impressed with this movie. I am glad to see that the ""Christian film"" genre is finally breaking out of the stereotype of being low budget and low quality.The story is generally very good (underdog stories and sports tend to go well together and tend to be favorites) that seems rather inspired by ""Remember the Titans."" It is definitely inspiring. The story and script were pretty impressive overall in spite of some flaws. It is fairly predictable in many places, especially towards the end, so don't expect too many surprises in the story. The story also tends to lack subtlety and complexity; it primarily sticks to the main plot without subplots or too many complicating factors, and some of the metaphors were rather transparent (such as the one at the very end of the movie, but I won't give it away). There were a lot of impressive things too though: for example, unlike many other Christian movies, their references to God, the Bible, etc. didn't seem forced or contrived. Often Christian films will try to impose the Christian message on a script that does not lend itself to that (""let's pause for the Gospel presentation"" type films), but this film avoids that pretty well. The story also remained engaging the whole time.I was generally impressed by the acting as well. In spite of many of them being inexperienced I thought they generally did a good job. There were a few places where their lack of experience showed, but overall I thought everyone did a good job, including many of the minor characters. I would definitely like to see a lot of them in stuff in the future.The cinematography was very impressive as well.

After a few years of losing seasons, Coach Taylor is informed that his job is on the line.  Concerned citizens don't think the school administration is moving quickly enough and begin implementing their own agenda to get rid of Taylor even sooner.  Taylor is also facing marital tensions with his wife, Brooke (Shannen Fields) because after several years of marriage they have yet to conceive a child.  Taylor is a strong man of faith, but he finds it difficult to remain firm when his entire world seems to be crushing down around him.  At the pit of despair he seeks guidance from God and is filled with peace.  Later he receives a message from an unexpected visitor that provides him with the encouragement he needs to rebuild the football program around a strong purpose.  What follows is a moving and dynamic story about facing one's fears and boldly living a life of faith.FACING THE GIANTS will probably be pigeonholed into two distinct sub-genres of movies:  a football movie and Christian movies.  In being a football movie, FACING THE GIANTS isn't all that different from other successful football films, such as REMEMBER THE TITANS or even THE LONGEST YARD.  Most successful football films revolve around a team that overcomes huge obstacles and diversity by merging together to form a unite fighting force and then go on to either win or at least make it to the big game and play well.  REMEMBER THE TITANS and THE LONGEST YARD are two examples of football films that work well.  FACING THE GIANTS might not be as good of a football flick as those two films, but it's not too bad either.  The game scenes seem much better, grounded, and realistic than many other football movies, such as ANY GIVEN SUNDAY for example.But like most football movies, FACING THE GIANTS also fits into another sub-genre, that being a Christian movie.  I have seen many, many Christian movies that were well intended and which seemed to have been created with deep passion and commitment, but almost all of them have been horrible.  Usually what happens in a Christian movie is that the movie's protagonist reaches a turning point in their life and decides to become a follower of Jesus.  Once that decision is made their lives dramatically change usually for the better, even if the world is in an apocalyptic state, e.g. LEFT BEHIND or THE OMEGA CODE.  FACING THE GIANTS is able to avoid the conversion scene because Coach Taylor is already a Christian.  However, though the conversion is avoided, the life-changing events that follow the conversion are not.  Coach Taylor's life dramatically changes in many, many positive ways.  This isn't to say all of the positive things that happen shouldn't happen.  However, even though the events are possible and are filmed realistically, so many good things happen all at one time that it makes some of the events seemed contrived.  I believe I understand why the filmmakers did this; they wanted to show how God rewards faithful people and helps us in our time of greatest need.  It's a great message, but the fact of the matter is that there are many, many faithful people in situations similar to Coach Taylor's that never have everything turn around.  That's not to say that it doesn't happen, because sometimes it does.FACING THE GIANTS is better than the majority of movies released each year.  It has a great positive and uplifting message.  It's also a well-produced film.  After having seen the film for the first time, I was surprised to learn that the film was almost entirely made by amateurs, mostly of members of Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.  It's incredibly difficult to produce a film with a mostly amateur cast and crew and most attempts aren't very good.  However, for an amateur cast and crew to create the quality of film that is FACING THE GIANTS is a major achievement.Overall, a well made football and faith movie that is completely family friendly.",4,Well Made Faith-Based Football Film.,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,4078,"['relatively', 'small', 'southern', 'U.S.', 'town', 'young', 'football', 'coach', 'Grant', 'Taylor', 'Alex', 'Kendrick', 'trying', 'build', 'winning', 'football', 'program', 'few', 'years', 'losing', 'seasons', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'informed', 'job', 'line', 'Concerned', 'citizens', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'school', 'administration', 'moving', 'quickly', 'enough', 'begin', 'implementing', 'own', 'agenda', 'get', 'rid', 'Taylor', 'even', 'sooner', 'Taylor', 'also', 'facing', 'marital', 'tensions', 'wife', 'Brooke', 'Shannen', 'Fields', 'several', 'years', 'marriage', 'have', 'yet', 'conceive', 'child', 'Taylor', 'strong', 'man', 'faith', 'difficult', 'remain', 'firm', 'when', 'entire', 'world', 'be', 'crushing', 'down', 'around', 'pit', 'despair', 'guidance', 'God', 'filled', 'peace', 'Later', 'message', 'unexpected', 'visitor', 'encouragement', 'rebuild', 'football', 'program', 'strong', 'purpose', 'What', 'moving', 'dynamic', 'story', 'facing', 'one', 'fears', 'boldly', 'living', 'life', 'faith.FACING', 'THE', 'GIANTS', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'two', 'distinct', 'sub-genres', 'movies', 'football', 'movie', 'Christian', 'movies', 'being', 'football', 'movie', 'FACING', 'THE', 'GIANTS', ""n't"", 'different', 'other', 'successful', 'football', 'films', 'such', 'REMEMBER', 'THE', 'TITANS', 'even', 'LONGEST', 'YARD', 'Most', 'successful', 'football', 'films', 'revolve', 'team', 'huge', 'obstacles', 'diversity', 'merging', 'together', 'form', 'unite', 'fighting', 'force', 'then', 'go', 'win', 'least', 'make', 'big', 'game', 'play', 'well', 'REMEMBER', 'TITANS', 'THE', 'LONGEST', 'YARD', 'are', 'two', 'examples', 'football', 'films', 'work', 'well', 'FACING', 'GIANTS', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'football', 'flick', 'two', 'films', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'either', 'game', 'seem', 'much', 'better', 'grounded', 'realistic', 'many', 'other', 'football', 'movies', 'such', 'ANY', 'GIVEN', 'SUNDAY', 'example.But', 'most', 'football', 'movies', 'FACING', 'THE', 'GIANTS', 'also', 'sub-genre', 'being', 'Christian', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'many', 'Christian', 'movies', 'were', 'well', 'intended', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'deep', 'passion', 'commitment', 'almost', 'have', 'been', 'horrible', 'Usually', 'what', 'Christian', 'movie', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'turning', 'point', 'life', 'become', 'follower', 'Jesus', 'Once', 'decision', 'made', 'lives', 'dramatically', 'change', 'usually', 'better', 'even', 'world', 'apocalyptic', 'state', 'e.g', 'LEFT', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'OMEGA', 'CODE', 'THE', 'GIANTS', 'able', 'avoid', 'conversion', 'scene', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'already', 'Christian', 'However', 'conversion', 'avoided', 'life-changing', 'events', 'follow', 'conversion', 'are', 'not', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'life', 'dramatically', 'changes', 'many', 'many', 'positive', 'ways', ""n't"", 'say', 'positive', 'things', 'happen', 'should', ""n't"", 'happen', 'However', 'even', 'events', 'are', 'possible', 'are', 'filmed', 'realistically', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'happen', 'one', 'time', 'events', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'believe', 'understand', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'wanted', 'show', 'how', 'God', 'faithful', 'people', 'time', 'greatest', 'need', 'great', 'message', 'fact', 'matter', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'faithful', 'people', 'situations', 'similar', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'never', 'have', 'everything', 'turn', 'around', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'happen', 'THE', 'GIANTS', 'better', 'majority', 'movies', 'released', 'year', 'great', 'positive', 'uplifting', 'message', 'also', 'well-produced', 'film', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'entirely', 'made', 'amateurs', 'mostly', 'members', 'Sherwood', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'Albany', 'Georgia', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'produce', 'film', 'mostly', 'amateur', 'cast', 'crew', 'most', 'attempts', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'However', 'amateur', 'cast', 'crew', 'create', 'quality', 'film', 'FACING', 'THE', 'GIANTS', 'major', 'achievement.Overall', 'well', 'made', 'football', 'faith', 'movie', 'completely', 'family', 'friendly']",N/A

177164,A1C80B497LCYKA,1424810248,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[5, 11]","Alex Kendrick wrote, directed and starred in this story of a high school coach and his losing football team, the Shiloh Eagles, overcoming adversity to become state champions of Virginia - with God's help. A very strong script and a non-preachy tone overcome the deficits of a small budget, such as low production values and amateur actors. It's hard to believe that a Baptist church in Georgia produced this film, or that its associate pastor of media conceived, wrote, directed and starred in it, but they did - which goes to show that faith and a strong vision, as well as a good story, can overcome anything. Even though weak cinematography and music, as well as a cast of all volunteer actors, threaten to pull the film down, it not only manages to stay afloat, but bursts through all barriers to leave the audience emotionally satisfied in the end. Like the characters in Facing The Giants, the cast and crew end up believing that ""With God, all things are possible.""Two themes are intertwined: Coach Grant Taylor's inability to produce a winning football team, and his inability to produce a family. These two failures, as well as the everyday disappointments of life, devastate him and his wife. The scene when the couple break down in tears over the results they've been getting is one of the strongest in the film. But they don't get angry or bitter. Instead, Grant goes to God and lays his problems before Him. And God hears and answers. Grant teaches his football team that we honor God, not just when we win, but when we lose as well. He also works with the boys to honor their parents, as well as obey all of God's commands. He teaches them to always do their best, and leave the results to God. This change in attitude carries the boys to a new level of living, and the state championship.There is an interesting scene, right before the state playoffs, in which Mark Richt, head coach for the University of Georgia, makes a cameo appearance to wish Coach Taylor well, having apparently been his former coach. Visually, Richt contrasts sharply with the rest of the film because he is poised, polished and professional, as well as very charismatic and photogenic. He causes one to wonder what the rest of the film would have been like had the producers had the budget and knowledge to hire a more professional cast and crew - say along the lines of Remember The Titans. Perhaps instead of Facing The Giants being a phenomenal little film, it could have been a great film. One can only wonder. But maybe it is all that it was supposed to be: inspiration for now, and inspiration for greater things to come.Waitsel Smith",4,LOW PRODUCTION VALUES DON'T HURT STRONG SCRIPT - TOO MUCH,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2631,"['Alex', 'Kendrick', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'coach', 'losing', 'football', 'team', 'Shiloh', 'Eagles', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'become', 'state', 'champions', 'Virginia', 'God', 'help', 'very', 'strong', 'script', 'non-preachy', 'tone', 'overcome', 'deficits', 'small', 'budget', 'such', 'low', 'production', 'values', 'amateur', 'actors', 'hard', 'believe', 'Baptist', 'church', 'Georgia', 'produced', 'film', 'associate', 'pastor', 'media', 'conceived', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred', 'did', 'show', 'faith', 'strong', 'vision', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'overcome', 'anything', 'Even', 'weak', 'cinematography', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'cast', 'volunteer', 'actors', 'threaten', 'pull', 'film', 'down', 'not', 'only', 'stay', 'afloat', 'bursts', 'barriers', 'leave', 'audience', 'emotionally', 'satisfied', 'end', 'characters', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'cast', 'crew', 'end', 'up', 'believing', 'God', 'things', 'are', 'possible', 'Two', 'themes', 'are', 'intertwined', 'Coach', 'Grant', 'Taylor', 'inability', 'produce', 'winning', 'football', 'team', 'inability', 'produce', 'family', 'two', 'failures', 'as', 'well', 'everyday', 'disappointments', 'life', 'devastate', 'wife', 'scene', 'when', 'couple', 'break', 'down', 'tears', 'results', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'one', 'strongest', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'angry', 'bitter', 'Instead', 'Grant', 'God', 'problems', 'Him', 'God', 'hears', 'answers', 'Grant', 'football', 'team', 'honor', 'God', 'not', 'just', 'when', 'win', 'when', 'lose', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'boys', 'honor', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'obey', 'God', 'commands', 'always', 'do', 'best', 'leave', 'results', 'God', 'change', 'attitude', 'boys', 'new', 'level', 'living', 'state', 'championship.There', 'interesting', 'scene', 'right', 'state', 'playoffs', 'Mark', 'Richt', 'head', 'coach', 'University', 'Georgia', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'wish', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'well', 'having', 'apparently', 'been', 'former', 'coach', 'Visually', 'Richt', 'sharply', 'rest', 'film', 'poised', 'polished', 'professional', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'charismatic', 'photogenic', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'rest', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'producers', 'had', 'budget', 'knowledge', 'hire', 'more', 'professional', 'cast', 'crew', 'say', 'lines', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Perhaps', 'instead', 'Facing', 'Giants', 'being', 'phenomenal', 'little', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'maybe', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspiration', 'now', 'inspiration', 'greater', 'things', 'come.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
