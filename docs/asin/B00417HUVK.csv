Mathieu ""waldenpond88""","[1, 12]","When I immigrated from Hamburg, Germany, to the US in 2002, Andr&eacute; Rieu was already famous and touring Germany for years. However, I never went to one of his concerts and as I hardly ever watch TV, I didn't see his orchestra on TV either.So last week we finally got his CD from the public library totally unbiased and listened to it.We are both Strauss fans and love the Strauss waltzes from the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.Well, we listened to the first waltz on the Rieu CD (On the beautiful blue Danube) and shook our heads. What happened to this once so lovely and energetic waltz? This sounded as if a 3 man band played it. Waltzes HAVE to be played by a huge orchestra in order to sound right!!! This is not what Strauss had on his mind when he composed his waltzes.Then we listened to a few more waltzes (Voices of Spring is usually my favorite waltz), but with every new song we got the feeling, we heard the previous waltz. Totally uninspired music. There was absolutely no difference between each waltz. Very repetitive.A small chamber orchestra really shouldn't play waltzes.If I could give zero stars, I would have done it.This kind of music is an affront/insult to every waltz lover!",1,Totally uninspired,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,1204,"['When', 'immigrated', 'Hamburg', 'Germany', 'US', '2002', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Rieu', 'was', 'already', 'famous', 'touring', 'Germany', 'years', 'However', 'never', 'went', 'one', 'concerts', 'hardly', 'ever', 'watch', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'orchestra', 'TV', 'either.So', 'last', 'week', 'finally', 'got', 'CD', 'public', 'library', 'totally', 'unbiased', 'listened', 'it.We', 'are', 'Strauss', 'fans', 'love', 'Strauss', 'waltzes', 'Vienna', 'Philharmonic', 'Orchestra.Well', 'listened', 'first', 'waltz', 'Rieu', 'CD', 'beautiful', 'blue', 'Danube', 'shook', 'heads', 'What', 'happened', 'once', 'so', 'lovely', 'energetic', 'waltz', 'sounded', '3', 'man', 'band', 'played', 'HAVE', 'be', 'played', 'huge', 'orchestra', 'order', 'sound', 'right', 'not', 'what', 'Strauss', 'had', 'mind', 'when', 'composed', 'waltzes.Then', 'listened', 'few', 'more', 'waltzes', 'Voices', 'Spring', 'usually', 'favorite', 'waltz', 'new', 'song', 'got', 'feeling', 'heard', 'previous', 'waltz', 'Totally', 'uninspired', 'music', 'was', 'absolutely', 'difference', 'waltz', 'Very', 'repetitive.A', 'small', 'chamber', 'orchestra', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'play', 'waltzes.If', 'could', 'give', 'zero', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'it.This', 'kind', 'music', 'affront/insult', 'waltz', 'lover']",N/A

Personally, I have in the past so often enjoyed performances at London's Royal Albert Hall, and the excellent quality of this disc made me almost feel that I was there again.  Unfortunately, although not on this occasion a fact, I was able to go to Holland with the next disc which, to my mind, is one of Andre Rieu's best.  &#34;The Homecoming&#34; gives the maestro the opportunity to impress his own &#34;neighbours&#34; with the great talents of his now world-famous musicians, and I'm sure that my high opinion of this will be parallel to yours when youwatch and listen to it.  Our final treat in this &#34;Celebration Of Music&#34;  is a trip to France where &#34;La Vie En Belle&#34; is again a wonderful display of the talents of this unique orchestra.
