477393,AY12DBB0U420B,6305773122,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's movie was ""The Magic of Flight"" DVD. It was part of an ""Experience the World"" collection of five IMAX films I found on the bargain rack at a local Ross Store. ""The Magic of Flight"" DVD comes in two parts: first is the film itself, adapted from an IMAX film for wide-screen TVs, and second was ""The Making of The Magic of Flight."" I think that an interested viewer would want to watch both. The film is actually shorter than the explanation of the making.""The Magic of Flight"" is amazing to watch. The photography is overwhelming. Of course, this film is made with special cameras and for showing in IMAX theaters so the television version is but a small sampling. If you ever go to see it in an IMAX theater, be sure to bring your motion sickness pills! The film tells the story of flight from the birds to early human attempts, including the Wright Brothers, and onto such acrobatic flyers as the Navy Blue Angels. An emphasis is placed on jet flight and the Angels. The movie is interesting and well done. When you watch the film, you will probably be wondering how in the world did they ever manage to record that? Well, that's why you ought to also view the following explanation of how they made the film. In a lot of ways, I thought the explanation was more interesting than the film itself. And, of course, excellent though it might be, the film is but a preview of what you might experience in an IMAX Theater. If you ever get the chance, Go!Gary Peterson",5,"Wonderful.

The production, narrated by the mellifluous Tom Selleck, is a visual feast, and traces the evolution of powered flight from the Wright brothers to the Blue Angels. The tidbits of history are interesting, but it is clear from the outset that the stars of the show are the Blue Angels.The film is short (about 39 minutes), as are most IMAX releases, but is generally well-paced and captivating. I found a few of the trails the director went down to be a distraction from the central theme of the film (e.g. showing some of the members of the Blue Angels lifting weights and running to stay in shape, etc.), especially with this short of a running time. The interviews with pilots were generally good, but they frequently devolved into platitudes about ""being born to fly"" and ""being at one with the aircraft"", etc. Perhaps, though, I am bit hypercritical of this aspect as a longtime airline (and former Air Force) pilot: it's not that the interview segments are bad, they're just very bland and homogenous.Overall, I thought this was a very strong effort and well worth the money if you are interested in high performance flying.",4,A Brief Yet Captivating Magic Act,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,1266,"['Magic', 'Flight', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'IMAX', 'theatres', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'been', 'impressive', 'see', 'very', 'big', 'screen', 'production', 'narrated', 'mellifluous', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'visual', 'feast', 'evolution', 'powered', 'flight', 'Wright', 'brothers', 'Blue', 'Angels', 'tidbits', 'history', 'are', 'interesting', 'clear', 'outset', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'Blue', 'Angels.The', 'film', 'short', '39', 'minutes', 'are', 'most', 'IMAX', 'releases', 'generally', 'well-paced', 'captivating', 'found', 'few', 'trails', 'director', 'went', 'down', 'be', 'distraction', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'e.g', 'showing', 'members', 'Blue', 'Angels', 'lifting', 'weights', 'running', 'stay', 'shape', 'etc', 'especially', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'interviews', 'pilots', 'were', 'generally', 'good', 'frequently', 'devolved', 'platitudes', 'being', 'born', 'fly', 'being', 'one', 'aircraft', 'etc', 'Perhaps', 'am', 'bit', 'hypercritical', 'aspect', 'longtime', 'airline', 'former', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilot', 'not', 'interview', 'segments', 'are', 'bad', ""'re"", 'just', 'very', 'bland', 'homogenous.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'effort', 'well', 'money', 'are', 'interested', 'high', 'performance', 'flying']",N/A
