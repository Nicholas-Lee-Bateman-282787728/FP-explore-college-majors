1068584,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000P5FH30,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","If you just can't get enough of people walking around in the forest, Haunted Forest is your movie.  If you're looking for a good horror movie, though, you might want to just pass this one by.  Sometimes I just watch a movie online based on a whim, and this is one of those cases.  The title made me think of Japan's Suicide Forest, and so I decided purely on impulse to just watch the film without even taking a look at the plot summary.  Many times I've been pleased by these whim-based choices of mine - but not this time.  This is just a weird and, unfortunately, pretty boring little film.  The spirit haunting the forest is Native American, yet she has the appearance of your typical long-haired Asian ghost.  It appears to me that the filmmakers attempted to make an Asian horror movie out of a distinctly American story.  Naturally, since it lacks all of the cultural substance of Asian horror, the movie just doesn't work.As the legend goes, a young Indian maiden named Satinka was given protection by the spirit of a large tree when white settlers killed the man she loved and attempted to burn down the forest a century or so ago.  Woe to anyone who ventures forth into those woods ever since, as each visitor is inevitably marked by Satinka with a thorn and done away with in some fashion.  Enter Sean, whose Native American grandfather wrote and illustrated a journal all about Satinka and the Haunted Forest, his friend Josh, an annoying foreigner who somehow sees the whole thing as a business opportunity, and some loser who spends most of his time smoking pot.  They have come in search of a hidden graveyard said to lie beneath Satinka's tree.  Such a find would help Sean get his grandfather's manuscript published, but I don't for the life of me see how this whole business is going to translate into much of a profit for anyone.  And then there's this: Sean, a man of Native American descent, is trying to honor his Native American grandfather by finding and disturbing an old burial site.  That's something you don't see every day.  Apparently, this guy has never learned that disturbing any burial site associated with Native Americans is really not a good idea.  And if Sean believes his grandfather's story - which he seems to do except for those times when he doesn't - shouldn't he know that he's walking directly into danger?  I must say I really have a few problems with this particular character.The writers did throw in an attractive female scientist exploring the woods' plant life, and there's a little more going on in these woods than I'm telling you about here, but the story proceeds in a fairly mundane fashion.  In the film's favor, the story is rather unusual, but what little believability it has in the beginning is pretty much lost by the time the final drama plays out.  Personally, I was never drawn into the movie enough to even engage my suspension of disbelief engine.  Much like Satinka's tree itself, Haunted Forest is pretty much hollow inside.",2,"An interesting idea, perhaps, but the whole thing just never comes together",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,2994,"['just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'people', 'walking', 'around', 'forest', 'Haunted', 'Forest', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'though', 'might', 'want', 'just', 'pass', 'one', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'online', 'based', 'whim', 'one', 'cases', 'title', 'made', 'think', 'Japan', 'Suicide', 'Forest', 'so', 'decided', 'purely', 'impulse', 'just', 'watch', 'film', 'even', 'taking', 'look', 'plot', 'summary', 'Many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pleased', 'whim-based', 'choices', 'mine', 'not', 'time', 'just', 'weird', 'unfortunately', 'pretty', 'boring', 'little', 'film', 'spirit', 'haunting', 'forest', 'Native', 'American', 'yet', 'appearance', 'typical', 'long-haired', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'filmmakers', 'attempted', 'make', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movie', 'distinctly', 'American', 'story', 'Naturally', 'cultural', 'substance', 'Asian', 'horror', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.As', 'legend', 'young', 'Indian', 'maiden', 'named', 'Satinka', 'was', 'given', 'protection', 'spirit', 'large', 'tree', 'when', 'white', 'settlers', 'killed', 'man', 'loved', 'attempted', 'burn', 'down', 'forest', 'century', 'so', 'ago', 'Woe', 'anyone', 'who', 'ventures', 'forth', 'woods', 'ever', 'visitor', 'inevitably', 'marked', 'Satinka', 'thorn', 'done', 'away', 'fashion', 'Enter', 'Sean', 'Native', 'American', 'grandfather', 'wrote', 'illustrated', 'journal', 'Satinka', 'Haunted', 'Forest', 'friend', 'Josh', 'annoying', 'foreigner', 'who', 'somehow', 'whole', 'thing', 'business', 'opportunity', 'loser', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'smoking', 'pot', 'have', 'come', 'search', 'hidden', 'graveyard', 'said', 'lie', 'beneath', 'Satinka', 'tree', 'find', 'would', 'help', 'Sean', 'get', 'grandfather', 'manuscript', 'published', 'do', ""n't"", 'life', 'see', 'how', 'whole', 'business', 'going', 'translate', 'much', 'profit', 'anyone', 'then', 'Sean', 'man', 'Native', 'American', 'descent', 'trying', 'honor', 'Native', 'American', 'grandfather', 'finding', 'disturbing', 'old', 'burial', 'site', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'day', 'Apparently', 'guy', 'never', 'learned', 'disturbing', 'burial', 'site', 'associated', 'Native', 'Americans', 'really', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'Sean', 'grandfather', 'story', 'do', 'times', 'when', ""n't"", 'should', ""n't"", 'know', 'walking', 'directly', 'danger', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'have', 'few', 'problems', 'particular', 'character.The', 'writers', 'did', 'throw', 'attractive', 'female', 'scientist', 'exploring', 'woods', 'plant', 'life', 'little', 'more', 'going', 'woods', ""'m"", 'telling', 'here', 'story', 'proceeds', 'fairly', 'mundane', 'fashion', 'film', 'favor', 'story', 'rather', 'unusual', 'what', 'little', 'believability', 'beginning', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'time', 'final', 'drama', 'out', 'Personally', 'was', 'never', 'drawn', 'movie', 'enough', 'even', 'engage', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'engine', 'Much', 'Satinka', 'tree', 'Haunted', 'Forest', 'pretty', 'much', 'hollow', 'inside']",Haunted Forest

1068591,A38RF06HMSYVLO,B000P5FH30,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[10, 11]","The Haunted Forest was a low-budgeted film which used Japanese Horror techniques to scare the viewer.  I have to say it was better than I was expecting, but I consider it only as a rental film.The film begins with a photograper being mysteriously taken by an unseen force in the forest.  Later, three male friends go into the forest to find a particular tree which was recovered from the photographers camera.  It shows a human like shape reaching out of a tree.  They and two female characters become hunted by the forest spirit Santika and a crazy hunter who is being controlled by the spirit.  Santika begins her attacks by marking the victims with a twig enbedded into their skin.  THis causes the victim to become ill.  Then the hunter tracks and traps them so Santika can drag them off to her underground layer where they become live soil for the forest.  As some of the characters disappear, we discover that one of them was a native american who was Santika's lover in a past life.  We also discover that the tree spirit has been collecting victims to use as soil for a new set of trees for the forest which was burned down by three humans in the past.  Santika origianlly went into the spirit tree to get cover from the fire.  But the tree decided to use her to capture victims for it's new forest.  I'll  leave the rest of the film for you to see for yourself.The Haunted Forest was a little confusing at times, but the J-Horror stlye really helped to make it creepy.  By J-Horror I mean their were definately horror filming elements that can be seen in The Grudge movies and other more popular Japanese horror films.  The film did jump me a few times, and the acting was above average for a low budgeted film.There are really no special features with this film, and it will most likely be all fizzled out as far as scare factor after a couple of viewings.  My suggestion is to rent it if you like J-Horror style films.  Buying it will probally just lead to you re-selling it at some point to a used DVD store. I gave the film 3 stars due to the fact that it actually had an original idea, and it actually jumps the viewer like it was meant to.
