It's a simple family tale, with the usual long meaningful looks and lengthy stretches of no dialogue, so like most European cinema. I was taken with the look of modern China, so different than here, yet familiar somehow. The acting is all high level, and the cinematography is what really shines.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[4, 4]","A most unexpected pleasure, the complex ""Luxury Car"" manages to gracefully link crime drama to a tale of familial obligations. Quiet when needed, brutal at times--the film's most stunning success is in establishing a truly realistic portrait of a man and his adult daughter. A schoolteacher, filled with regret and sadness, arrives in the city to locate his estranged son. Instead, he reconnects with his daughter who is working for an escort service. These two give lovely performances highlighted as much by what is left unsaid as by unnecessary dramatics.Covering life's compromises and sacrifices, this is a gentle, but tough, picture. As more and more truths are revealed, it will either tear the family apart or bring them closer. The daughter is involved with some unsavory characters and the answers she finds aren't always easy ones. Heartfelt and moving, I really liked the multi-layered successes in this picture.

1276119,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B002LC3M2S,KinoChelovek,"[3, 3]","I sat down to watch this movie, thinking that all I was going to see was communist propaganda or just be difficult to follow.  Was I wrong...A aging schoolteacher goes to the city of Wuhan to search for his son - his wife is dying of cancer and it is her last wish to have her son visit her before death.  He stays with his daughter, who is (and I'm sort of unsure) either a call-girl, escort, or a prostitute at a nightclub.  While he searches for his son with a local policeman, the daughter is (secretly) doing her ""job.""  She is also the mistress of the club's boss (who owns the item of the movie's title), who is nothing but a thug.  I will stop there, because it becomes better and more complex.  The conclusions to the narrative and sub-stories make the movie excellent!How these stories intertwine, characters develop, and narratives unfold is really, really good.  I have seen many Chinese-made movies; this one has a truly Western feel to it.  Of course, it is a French coproduction, so there is quite a bit of quality to the film making.  I even noticed that the film could be set, quite easily, in any country, giving it a more universality to viewership.  There are some communist propaganda.  Examples: the father was exiled to the country for his views and there are scenes of the working class building society (a high rise);  On the other, is exposure to culture, usually unseen or whitewashed for Chinese propaganda purposes, including several Buddhist rituals, crime, and the story of a female's shame and placement in society.  The filmmakers use the Western crime drama and mystery ""genre,"" which is constantly working in the movie.The lead actress is quite stunning-looking and all acting is excellent.A First Run Feature DVD, a company who usually releases movies that are seldom shown, but are quite good (like Film Movement).  The transfer is not widescreen, nor do I believe that it was made that way (imdb doesn't say).5 of 5.  Well done movie.  Well-rounded and keeps the viewer interested.  Multi-layered.

A school teacher travels to the city in search of his son, to get him to visit his dying mother. His daughter greets him to help with the search and with various hints and disclosures, reveals to the father that she is a prostitute and later that she is pregnant. Her pimp/boss later tells her that her brother was killed while involved in a carjacking that he was also involved in.

1276121,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B002LC3M2S,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","It's pure coincidence but this is the third straight father-daughter relationship drama in a row that I've watched (after Greece's ""Attenberg"" and Romania's ""Ryna""). As I was reading the DVD jacket of this Chinese movie, it came with high praise from various sources, so I decided to pick it up.""Luxury Car"" (2006 release from China; 88 min.) brings the story of Li Yanhong (played by Tian Yuan), a young woman living in Wuhan trying to make a better life for herself away from the country-side where her parents live. As the movie starts, we see that Yanhong's dad is visiting her and staying at her place. We learn that Yanhong's mom is terminally ill and her dad is trying to find Yanhong's brother, whom the mom desparately wants to see one more time before it's too late, but the brother is out of contact. Yanhong's dad seeks the assistance of an older policeman who is close to retirement, to try and fine Yanhong's brother. Finally we also learn that Yanhong is working in a ""karaoke escort bar"", which is owned by Yanhong's boyfriend. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, although much of the movie focuses on the relationship between Yanhong and her dad, there are a number of side-stories that do not do the movie much service. At some point in the second half of the movie, the tone shifts radically for about 15 min. when it becomes a Chinese mob crime drama, only then to completely return to the father-daughter saga. I was taken aback by that, to be honest. Second, the last 5 min. of the movie, when ""all is revealed"", were way to condensed and the abrupt endng left me scratching my head. Third, even though the movie is listed as running 88 min., I think in reality it was probably 10 min. shorter than that, in other words: this is a very short movie. Last, there are several pluses, none more so than the very appealing performance of Tian Yuan as the young woman. In the end, given the praise that this movie came with (including winning one of the side-prizes of the 2006 Cannes film festival), I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed when the movie concluded. To be clear: this is by no stretch of the imagination a ""bad"" movie, not at all. It is simply not quite as good as I had hoped.",4,3.5 stars...

1276122,A2ET8ATAEGZ1WW,B002LC3M2S,Paul Healy,"[3, 3]","Wang Chao's film, Luxury Car, is an assured realisation of a compelling story of contemporary China. The story takes on a modern cinema noir tone, with interesting interweaving characters. Just to what extent and how those character's lives are entwined leads us to the story's climax. The film is carried by the beautiful Tian Yuan, a prostitute (Yanhong) working in a karaoke bar in Wuhan. Yanhong is visited by her father who, at the request of his dying wife, is trying to find out what happened to their son (Yanhong's brother). The really surprising character is the old policeman, who offers to help the father find his son. Here is a film from a masterful film director which shines a dark light, not only into contemporary Chinese society, but more generally into the lives of the disconnected and fragmented people that make up all consumer-oriented societies. Luxury Car is not a Hollywood film; instead it is a humble but perfectly made story, rich in character and offering real insights into the general human condition.",5,Social drama with style,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1034,"['Wang', 'Chao', 'film', 'Luxury', 'Car', 'assured', 'realisation', 'compelling', 'story', 'contemporary', 'China', 'story', 'modern', 'cinema', 'noir', 'tone', 'interesting', 'interweaving', 'characters', 'Just', 'what', 'extent', 'how', 'character', 'lives', 'are', 'entwined', 'leads', 'story', 'climax', 'film', 'carried', 'beautiful', 'Tian', 'Yuan', 'prostitute', 'Yanhong', 'working', 'karaoke', 'bar', 'Wuhan', 'Yanhong', 'visited', 'father', 'who', 'request', 'dying', 'wife', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'son', 'Yanhong', 'brother', 'really', 'surprising', 'character', 'old', 'policeman', 'who', 'help', 'father', 'find', 'son', 'Here', 'film', 'masterful', 'film', 'director', 'dark', 'light', 'not', 'only', 'contemporary', 'Chinese', 'society', 'more', 'generally', 'lives', 'disconnected', 'fragmented', 'people', 'make', 'up', 'consumer-oriented', 'societies', 'Luxury', 'Car', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'instead', 'humble', 'perfectly', 'made', 'story', 'rich', 'character', 'offering', 'real', 'insights', 'general', 'human', 'condition']",N/A
