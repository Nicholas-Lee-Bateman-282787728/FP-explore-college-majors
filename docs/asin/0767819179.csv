It had several more layers to it than that, and people accustomed to watching a heartfelt, quality film would recognize that. In fact, I think the editorial viewer for this site who called it &quot;self-absorbed&quot; on Streisand's part, must have been watching another movie when he stated:&quot;Her character constantly gazes upon her own reflection and is told at least a dozen times, one way or another, just how attractive she is. One wants to shout out, we get it already--you're pretty!&quot;What was he talking about? The entire film had her mother and sister nagging her about her sloppy and ugly appearance and constantly telling her how unattractive she was! And the reason she was constantly gazing at the mirror at her face was because she was critiquing it! She was critical of her own appearance, because she didn't feel attractive. She was by no means gazing at her reflection out of vanity! That much was definitely clear to anybody who actually paid attention to the film. And by the way, in case anybody has skipped the title, it's called &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;, which explains the metaphor of her constantly looking in the mirror, and mirrors constantly being shown throughout the film even when she's not gazing into them, to demonsrate the symoblism of the film's title. The mirrors were certainly not there to demonstrate how beautiful Barbra Streisand was! On the contrary, it was pointing out that she was NOT the conventional beautiful woman (in contrast to Elle Macpherson's character).Perhaps people's personal opinions about the actress interfere with their opinion on the film, which I really found to be exceptional.

Why is she living with her mother?The incidental musical score is precisely what you would expect in a Streisand film: 100 violins, a saxaphone..........I wish Streisand would get away from the Jeff Bridges'/Nick Nolte's/Ryan O'Neal's/Robert Redford's kind of co-stars.

Of course she gets a date with a man, but he's not physically attracted to her and he has this theory that good friends can make a marriage work without the physical attraction being involved.It's a really poignant film, which makes you realize--man or woman that not only is beauty only skin deep, but just being attractive isn't enough to make you happy, that is, if you're not happy being yourself.Barbra's character realizes that she has more to offer even if her character is deemed the ugly duckling. Something that her sister and mother never really seem to fully realize.They're all a great cast, but it's a sad movie with a happy ending where...Well, I will just let you see the film for yourself!*(Due to mature adult themes, I would only recommend this to viewers 18 and older.)*",5,"Excellent, heart-warming, and amusing!",1137715200,"01 20, 2006",2006,2003,"['give', 'movie', 'heart-felt', 'amusing', 'delightful', 'poignant', 'scenes.The', 'movie', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'played', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'excellent', 'actress', 'singer', 'who', 'difficulty', 'attracting', 'suitor', 'considered', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'opposed', 'sister', 'played', 'talented', 'actress', 'own', 'right', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'mother', 'played', 'talented', 'actress', 'Lauren', 'Bacall.Barbra', 'Streisand', 'character', 'successful', 'professor', 'Ivy-league', 'university', 'Columbia', 'who', 'go', 'blind', 'date', 'sister', 'afraid', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'miserable', 'spinster.Barbra', 'Streisand', 'up', 'meeting', 'professor', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'also', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'calculus', 'Columbia', 'Barbra', 'character', 'just', 'teach', 'different', 'subjects.Anyhow', 'end', 'up', 'hitting', 'off', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'think', 'can', 'remain', 'platonic', 'yet', 'married', 'friends', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'successful', 'marriage', 'romantic', 'love', 'involved.The', 'main', 'reason', 'sad', 'poor', 'Barbra', 'character', 'viewed', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'date', 'shadow', 'beautiful', 'mother', 'sister', 'course', 'date', 'man', 'not', 'physically', 'attracted', 'theory', 'good', 'friends', 'can', 'make', 'marriage', 'work', 'physical', 'attraction', 'being', 'involved.It', 'really', 'poignant', 'film', 'realize', 'man', 'woman', 'not', 'only', 'beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'just', 'being', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'happy', ""'re"", 'not', 'happy', 'being', 'yourself.Barbra', 'character', 'more', 'offer', 'even', 'character', 'deemed', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'Something', 'sister', 'mother', 'never', 'really', 'seem', 'fully', 'realize.They', ""'re"", 'great', 'cast', 'sad', 'movie', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'Well', 'will', 'just', 'let', 'see', 'film', 'yourself', '*', 'Due', 'mature', 'adult', 'themes', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'viewers', '18', 'older', '*']",N/A

Abilene,"[48, 51]","Streisand's third directorial effort was greeted with surprisingly vicious reaction from both fans and critics, nearly all of whom immediately labeled it as an over-the-top vanity piece.  It also had considerable difficulty at the box office.  After opening with strong numbers, the $45 million budgeted film took a nose dive and did not recover.  It ended up taking in $46 million domestically ($65 million worldwide), which was a respectable take, but far from the blockbuster status of films like A STAR IS BORN or THE PRINCE OF TIDES.  When considering all of the above information, it's a bit surprising to discover that the film is nothing more than an entertaining and heart-felt romantic comedy.  In hindsight, it's hard to understand why a such a harmless and light-weight film became such a lighting rod for scathing reviews and harsh comments.While the storyline is predictable, the movie is actually very well-done with a brisk pace, compelling characters, and a witty screenplay.  The finale may come down a bit heavy-handed on the ""message"" end, but the build-up is effective enough to merit this indulgence.  Though MIRROR doesn't match her previous two directorial efforts, Streisand does once again pull off the various actress/producer/director roles with great efficiently, and this results in an effective star vehicle for the then-54-year-old film legend.  Jeff Bridges received a lot of flack for his completely unselfconscious portrayal, but I admire how completely he throws himself into the silly role.  Lauren Bacall is brilliantly biting and luminous in her turn as Streisand's mother, a role that earned her first (and so far only) Oscar nomination.  Mimi Rogers is also fun as Streisand's (...)younger sister, as is Brenda Vaccaro as her self-deprecating best friend - although Pierce Brosnan is wasted as a gigolo-like suitor.

14742,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0767819179,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","That's the name of a comically mocking song from ""Funny Girl"" when a group of yentas discuss the romantic prospects of a young Fanny Brice. It seems the harsh sentiments still resonate with Barbra Streisand nearly thirty years later in her third directorial effort. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably.At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale.As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in ""The Prince of Tides"". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves.At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in ""The Owl and the Pussycat"") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role. As with her previous two films, Streisand imbues her film with lots of background music though this time it feels somewhat more intrusive. What she does achieve is the romanticism in tone and self-image reinforcement she obviously felt a need to convey. The DVD came out only two years later in 1998 and consequently has no extras to offer.",3,If a Girl Isn't Pretty...,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,2988,"['name', 'comically', 'mocking', 'song', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'when', 'group', 'yentas', 'discuss', 'romantic', 'prospects', 'young', 'Fanny', 'Brice', 'harsh', 'sentiments', 'still', 'resonate', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'third', 'directorial', 'effort', 'sure', 'hand', 'maneuvering', 'inevitable', 'shenanigans', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'multi-hyphenated', 'legend', 'intractable', 'need', 'convey', 'serious-minded', 'self-esteem-oriented', 'messages', 'weigh', '1996', 'movie', 'down', 'considerably.At', 'epic', 'length', '130', 'minutes', 'story', 'adapted', 'Richard', 'LaGravenese', 'forgotten', '1958', 'French', 'film', 'quite', 'slight', 'Rose', 'Morgan', 'wildly', 'popular', 'Columbia', 'literature', 'professor', 'also', 'fortyish', 'baseball-obsessed', 'frump', 'long', 'shadow', 'beautiful', 'sister', 'Claire', 'glamorous', 'mother', 'Hannah', 'lot', 'life', 'crystallized', 'Claire', 'wedding', 'when', 'weds', 'Rose', 'longtime', 'crush', 'Alex', 'Meantime', 'Columbia', 'mathematics', 'professor', 'Gregory', 'Larkin', 'tires', 'bedding', 'beautiful', 'women', 'who', 'rile', 'irrational', 'acts', 'find', 'homely', 'woman', 'whom', 'can', 'have', 'platonic', 'intellectually-focused', 'friendship', 'eventually', 'chaste', 'marriage', 'Greg', 'personals', 'ad', 'Claire', 'unbeknownst', 'Rose', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Rose', 'Greg', 'inevitable', 'moment', 'when', 'Rose', 'intimacy', 'disinterested', 'Greg', 'physical', 'transformation', 'message-driven', 'finale.As', 'Rose', 'Streisand', 'quite', 'good', 'sympathetic', 'most', 'way', 'even', 'never', 'terribly', 'frumpy', 'character', 'magnetic', 'speaking', 'skills', 'lecture', 'hall', 'yearning', 'Barbra', 'long', 'ago', 'palpable', 'sadness', 'when', 'humiliated', 'wedding', 'night', 'However', 'once', 'Rose', 'transforms', 'Streisand', 'ego', 'over', 'blonde', 'highlights', 'aerobicized', 'body', 'bring', 'back', 'execrable', 'soft-focus', 'treatment', 'lovemaking', 'scenes', 'Prince', 'Tides', 'Looking', 'more', 'uni-browed', 'brother', 'father', 'older', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Greg', 'befuddling', 'stereotype', 'who', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'story', 'time', 'release', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'received', 'sorts', 'kudos', 'Hannah', 'relatively', 'superficial', 'performance', 'showy', 'role', 'wonderfully', 'brave', 'make-up-free', 'scene', 'where', 'Hannah', 'Rose', 'how', 'valued', 'beauty', 'lasted', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'sharp', 'bite', 'Claire', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'necessary', 'smarminess', 'shallow', 'Alex', 'George', 'Segal', 'Streisand', 'one-time', 'co-star', 'Owl', 'Pussycat', 'relegated', 'dispensable', 'best-pal', 'role', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'Streisand', 'film', 'lots', 'background', 'music', 'time', 'somewhat', 'more', 'intrusive', 'What', 'achieve', 'romanticism', 'tone', 'self-image', 'reinforcement', 'obviously', 'felt', 'need', 'convey', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'only', 'two', 'years', 'later', '1998', 'consequently', 'extras', 'offer']",N/A

Though we come to see her as a source of friction in the life of her daughters (Barbra and Mimi Rogers), we also see her arc over to helping Barbra fufill her dreams of realizing a true love match.  Watch for Bacall's most poignant scene as she confesses the true nature of the marriage she had with the girls' father.  It is here, in the more quiet moments of the film, we see Bacall's strength as an actor.As far as Babs' directing chops, she best identifies the strong dichotomy between her two main characters--the English professor, played by herself, and her husband, the math professor as portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  She is kinesthetic, while he is contained; she is all about hands-on experiences, while he is more about removed learning; she is vibrant and funny; he is reserved and ill-at-ease with even himself.  The scenes in which we see him falling more and more for Barbra show he is perhaps most ill-at-ease with the thought of having indeed found that special someone!The cast is rounded out effectively by George Seagal, playing Bridges' best friend, and a small part of note is played by Elle McPherson as one of Bridges' former lovers.For those who love a good romantic comedy, this film is a must!

I'm hardly ever wrong, so I didn't watch this movie when it came out.It was one of those instances when a trailer turns out to be a wonderful movie's worst enemy, depicting it in such a light that I actually thought ""Oh no, not another Barbra Streisand movie, where she weeps about how ugly she thinks she is, all the while making love to gorgeous men, and then the guy is unfaithful to her, please God no"". I was traumatized by that movie of hers starring Robert Redford and nothing will induce me to watch anything like that again.Having finally watched it, almost by accident on television, I think I like it much more than ""The Prince of Tides"", which I really loved. Her character is a wonderful, fascinating person, with a full life and great things to offer - who, among many other characteristics, also happens to feel lonely and inadequate at times, and has dreams about finding Prince Charming, no matter how late in life.

I had wanted to go see it at the cinema when it was there, but never got to it before it left the theater. The acting is stellar. Streisand and the other cast members are excellent in their roles. When I first saw this film, I instantly liked it. The song sung by Streisand (dueting with Bryan Adams) which is played during the closing credits is another well loved song of hers that is right up there with Evergreen, The Way We Were, etc. That song is so wonderful. I bought the DVD used and was quite disappointed for these reasons:a) The movie is in FULLSCREEN instead of WIDESCREEN.b) The subtitles are in Spanish and Korean only; no English ones (this really tees me off)c) There are no special features or added ""bonuses"" for this DVD.I am giving this DVD a full five star rating in spite of there being no special features and that this film is not in WIDESCREEN.

14774,A155HMYU7VR3TF,0767819179,Tams,"[7, 10]","This movie is perfect for romantics everywhere and offers a very inspirational boost to women and men everywhere who feel that Mr. or Mrs. Right is out of their reach.I think the character that Jeff Bridges played was marvelous. If you look at it closely you can see that he's a good looking man, but the women that he's previously dated often find him too dull. However, the moment he realizes that sex is the problem in all of his relationships and he moves it to the back burner (as crazy as that may be) it leads him to the right woman.I think there's a really good message in there for people in reality.  His character's ideas were a bit over-the-top but if they were toned down a little, you can see that the moment he didn't put as much emphasis on looks and sex... he met Mrs. Right. That could easily be useful to people in real-life in helping them realize that maybe they are putting too much emphasis on the wrong thing and they may want to check out how they view things to see if they are trying to have their cake and eat it too.Pretty much what Rose and Gregory had was a courtship in modern time, which can often be a better alternative to dating and can lead a lot of people to the right person (without the risk of sounding too preachy).I also watched the movie and saw that Gregory was a very good man. He appreciated the right things when it came to Rose. He was a good looking man but he was the type of man that a lot of women would appreciate. The only problem with the women he was dating before he met Rose was that they were too beautiful and selfish to appreciate what a good man he was. Though I'm quite sure it would've been possible to meet beautiful women that weren't selfish... though often it just happened that the women in his league (looks-wise) were just not the type of women to appreciate him.They were spoiled and had too many options and idolized their own beauty far too much (like Rose's mother--played by Lauren Becall). And of course when you watch the movie... you can get a good look at how women with that attitude can often end up if they aren't careful (by paying attention to Rose's mother's feelings, life, and how she always has to have a compliment about her looks). Women like that are enslaved by their own spoils and priviledges... but eventually that fades with age. And you can see how they try and hold on to it--too afraid to let go. When you watch the movie it will also be easy to see that Rose's sister Claire was also following in her mother's footsteps. Scared to death of not being beautiful anymore and living each moment and weighing it against the attention she received from men. It's quite a sad outlook.Really I think there's a lot of lessons to learn in this movie and I'm surprised it's criticized by some people. I find the movie utterly beautiful and charming. It's hard to find wonderful men and women in this world these days and to see a wonderful example of one in a movie is very nice. :)And the thing with someone boring like Gregory is that if they meet the right person, that can be changed. When you meet the right person and they accept you for who you are (like Rose did with him) it's only a matter of time before things like that change for the better if it's the right relationship, because two people who come together like that challenge one another and help one another open up and grow in the right direction. For instance, Gregory says on a dinner date with Rose that he finds dancing rather embarrassing, however at the end if you watch the credits... you'll see that Rose helped him change in that area.As for Barbara Streisand, reviewers have said that she was using the film as a way to state how beautiful she was and to show off her talents. Well, I disagree with that way of seeing things. I think that's projecting one's biased attitude onto Barbara Streisand.Just because she chooses to use her talents to create something good doesn't mean she should be ridiculed for it. The reason talents are created is so that we can use them. Now it would just be silly for her to know she can do something great with a project like that and be too afraid to use her talents. It's rather blind to automatically think she's trying to prove something to everyone when it could just easily be Barbara wanting to do something for herself and because she has the skills in general to do it.This is my personal opinion now, but I don't think Barbara was trying to brag or tell the world she was beautiful at all. What I saw was a woman (Barbara Streisand) who knows that she's not ""conventionally"" or ""typically"" beautiful in the usual way using her known physical faults to show and prove to other women that they don't have to be typical or conventionally beautiful to be beautiful to themselves or others.I thinks it's a bit narrow-minded to automatically assume she's trying to prove anything to anyone (""the world"" per se) that she's beautiful. It's just quite possible that she's trying to use her God-given talents to achieve something she believes in. I could be wrong but I don't think she's losing sleep at night worrying about or trying to prove her beauty status to the world as reviewers have said. She seems much too strong of a woman for that, if you ask me.There were a few points in the movie in which I thought eating carrots/veggies (when she was trying to lose weight) and her metamorphasis as a beautiful woman was a bit over-the-top, but that's my opinion on the movie itself. I think they could've eased up on that message just a little and made it a bit less superficial but it's minor and it's entertainments. It's not going to be perfect. It's just a movie and you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride and the delightful ending that it entails.Perfect romance through and through. :)",5,Beautiful Movie for Romantics Everywhere Teaches

He believes it is because he chooses stunning woman and then becomes intimate. He decides to find a perfect mate, and the main criterion is that she be ugly. His campaign begins with an advertisement. Claire is Rose?s sister, and she responds to the ad as if she were Rose.Rose lives with her mother Hanna Morgan, played by Lauren Bacall, who did receive an Oscar nomination for the role of a selfish, self-absorbed, snob. Hanna has kept Rose under her thumb and in her house, and always plays the &quot;What will I do if...?&quot; or &quot;Would you really leave me?&quot; card. Her performance is extraordinary because she undermined Rose to keep her taking care of mommy dearest, but it is subtle.Streisand directed this film, and though it may appear to be a showcase for her many talents, there is a strong message. Do not settle. Never accept the belief that you are ugly, even though your Mom and others tell you, as they did her all of her life. You can always become the person you want to be.Rose and Greg date and eventually marry, but the terms are no amorous encounters. For example on their wedding night, they watch TV and they sleep in twin beds. In growing closer and falling in love, Rose teaches Greg &quot;how to teach&quot; and they are constant companions. Rose believes she can settle for this lack of affection, but she is in love with her husband and is a very sensuous woman.Even though I prefer action films, I loved this movie. It is one of the better &quot;chick flicks.&quot; There is a powerful and tender scene between Rose and Hannah regarding a very old photo. The universality of the film ? you are valuable, just as you are, do not settle -- makes this a classic favorite.Victoria Tarrani",5,A charming story of personal growth and self-acceptance.,1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,2272,"['Barbra', 'Streisand', 'not', 'dowdy', 'yet', 'perfection', 'assuming', 'role', 'lonely', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'Rose', 'flawless', 'Rose', 'excellent', 'popular', 'college', 'teacher', 'how', 'teach', 'way', 'involve', 'enchant', 'rowdy', 'class', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'baseball', 'go', 'quot', 'dead', 'end', 'quot', 'Bridges', 'Greg', 'handsome', 'yet', 'exceedingly', 'boring', 'teacher', 'Most', 'students', 'math', 'classes', 'sleep', 'pass', 'notes', 'chat', 'lonely', 'man', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'end', 'woman', 'stunning', 'woman', 'then', 'intimate', 'find', 'perfect', 'mate', 'main', 'criterion', 'be', 'ugly', 'campaign', 'advertisement', 'Claire', 'Rose', 's', 'sister', 'ad', 'were', 'Rose.Rose', 'lives', 'mother', 'Hanna', 'Morgan', 'played', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'who', 'did', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'selfish', 'self-absorbed', 'snob', 'Hanna', 'kept', 'Rose', 'thumb', 'house', 'always', 'quot', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'quot', 'quot', 'Would', 'really', 'leave', 'quot', 'card', 'performance', 'extraordinary', 'undermined', 'Rose', 'keep', 'taking', 'care', 'mommy', 'dearest', 'subtle.Streisand', 'directed', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'showcase', 'many', 'talents', 'strong', 'message', 'Do', 'not', 'settle', 'Never', 'accept', 'belief', 'are', 'ugly', 'even', 'Mom', 'others', 'tell', 'did', 'life', 'can', 'always', 'become', 'person', 'want', 'be.Rose', 'Greg', 'date', 'eventually', 'marry', 'terms', 'are', 'amorous', 'encounters', 'example', 'wedding', 'night', 'watch', 'TV', 'sleep', 'twin', 'beds', 'growing', 'closer', 'falling', 'love', 'Rose', 'Greg', 'quot', 'how', 'teach', 'quot', 'are', 'constant', 'companions', 'Rose', 'can', 'settle', 'lack', 'affection', 'love', 'husband', 'very', 'sensuous', 'prefer', 'action', 'films', 'loved', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'quot', 'flicks.', 'quot', 'powerful', 'tender', 'scene', 'Rose', 'Hannah', 'regarding', 'very', 'old', 'photo', 'universality', 'film', 'are', 'valuable', 'just', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'settle', 'classic', 'favorite.Victoria', 'Tarrani']",N/A
