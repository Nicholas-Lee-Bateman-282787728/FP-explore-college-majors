Fred Ward is a good actor and I wish he was more known then he is.  He plays the part of a dirt bike racer.  On his racing circuit, he gets lost somewhere in the desert and accidentally gets transported back in time, to the late 1800's.  A research group was conducting a time travel experiment and for reasons of safety and secrecy, they set up the time travel machine out in the middle of the desert, hundreds of miles from the nearest person.  Not knowing what it is, Fred Ward goes over to it on his dirt bike and the moment he pulls up to it, the research group activates it and he gets thrown back in time, about 100 years.

This is your basic fish out of water story with a motocross racer, Lyle Swan (played by Fred Ward) gets unknowingly caught in a time travel experiment and launched about 100 years in the past.  The general reaction, due to his attire and motorized horse is that he is some kind of devil, but one person he comes across, Porter Reese, a criminal outlaw played by Peter Coyote, sees the potential in owning this amazing contraption for himself.  All of this takes place in the southern California desert, and Lyle is unaware of what has happened to him.  He thinks he just got lost during a race, and tries to find his way back home.  I thought it was interesting that he never really gets clued into the fact that he is 100 years out of time.  As I said in the beginning, and I think another reviewer mentions this, that a few critical seconds were cut out of a scene at the end.  These few seconds of missing footage include a helicopter, its rear rotor blade, and the main antagonist.  I think this part was edited out for a television release and never put back in for the DVD release, which is a real shame.  You wouldn't think 3 to 5 seconds of footage could impact a movie as much as it does, but it does here.  This is the reason why I am giving the release 3 stars instead of four.

I wish I had read the Amazon reviews before I picked this DVD up last night--but then, why would I have expected that anything had changed? I've been a fan of TIMERIDER since its theatrical release, so I was very happy to have it on DVD finally, and pleased with the transfer, but the TV/airline-version ending completely BITES. ""Okay, here comes the tail rotor...and I can hear Reese screaming...and all those squishy sound effects...but...but...YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!"" (Good thing I was home alone.)The original sequence was a brilliant and memorable piece of film-making that worked by suggestion: it showed everything it needed to without showing...well, everything. But most importantly, it was where the bad guy got his well-deserved comeuppance. How satisfying would the ending of ""Die Hard"" have been if John McClane had just left Hans Gruber cowering on the floor? Or if, after Luke Skywalker torpedoed the Death Star, the lights just flickered out?Distributor Anchor Bay claims that the DVD was made from the ""only usable negative available."" Uh...sure. I find it impossible to believe that Michael ""Mr. Video"" Nesmith couldn't find a single viable source in his files for THREE WHOLE SECONDS of film. Laserdisc? How about digitally cleaning up a VHS tape? Unfreakinbelievable.*Am I upset? You're darn tootin' I am. Sometimes ""little"" things matter A LOT.UPDATE 7/16/09: I just purchased a copy of TIMERIDER on laserdisc, and guess what: the missing footage (no pun intended) is there. Granted, it's a washed-out pan-and-scan transfer, but the footage exists in digital form. Guess I'll have to restore it myself. (You can see it on that popular video website.)*In retrospect, I realize that it likely wasn't up to Nesmith or director William Dear, but to the legal owners of the movie, who probably didn't care what version they released and/or didn't want to spend money to restore the original footage.

The riding scenes are awesome at the beginning and the music is really well done for this type of film and the time it was made. I always loved the premise of a modern machine being transported into the old west. The acting is very good throughout the cast here and the story line is simple but very effective.

He meets a motley cast of characters that includes criminal Porter Reese (Peter Coyote, ""E.T.,"" ""Sphere,"" ""Patch Adams,""), and Claire Cygne (Belinda Bauer).  Lyle never does realize that he has traveled to the past during the movie.This movie is actually fun to watch if you like time travel movies.  There are aspects of this movie that are vaguely reminiscent of time travel stories by Robert A. Heinlein, such as ""By His Bootstraps"" and ""All You Zombies...""  I enjoyed how Swann reacted to his surroundings as though he had gotten lost in modern America, though he had traveled into the past.  Most time travel movies have the principal character or characters know that they traveled into the past and have them react accordingly.This movie does have some plot holes, typical for time travel movies in general and especially for low budget time travel movies.  However, the movie is sufficiently interesting that you keep watching to see what Lyle Swann will do next, most of the time anyway.  The biggest problem the DVD release has is that it replaced the ending originally seen on HBO and available on VHS with an awful ending that has significantly less irony and I found personally less satisfying.  I would probably have given this movie 4 stars had the original ending been retained.Michael Nesmith co-produced this movie.  He also wrote the music and appears in a cameo.  People who remember the 60's well may recall that Nesmith was a member of The Monkees (the tallest member, who was also one of the two members who could actually play instruments when they joined the band).  Nesmith became a powerful force in the music video business, producing videos and records while still recording music.  This movie was one of his numerous projects after departing The Monkees.Even with the awful change to the end of this movie, it is a good movie to watch if you want to see a different take on time travel movies.  The movie was filmed with a serious and sincere tone rather than being played for laughs.  Indeed, there are several violent deaths in this movie that make this movie unsuitable for family members younger than 12 or 13 years old.Because of the change to the ending I recommend either trying to track down the VHS with the original ending, or wait until another DVD comes out with the original ending.Good luck!",3,Motorcycle Guy Drives into the Past,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,2504,"['Lyle', 'Swann', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Escape', 'Alcatraz', 'Silkwood', 'Tremors', 'running', 'cross-country', 'motorcycle', 'race', 'when', 'launched', 'more', '100', 'years', 'past', 'motley', 'cast', 'characters', 'criminal', 'Porter', 'Reese', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'E.T.', 'Sphere', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'Claire', 'Cygne', 'Belinda', 'Bauer', 'Lyle', 'never', 'realize', 'traveled', 'past', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'actually', 'fun', 'watch', 'like', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'are', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'vaguely', 'reminiscent', 'time', 'travel', 'stories', 'Robert', 'A.', 'Heinlein', 'such', 'Bootstraps', 'Zombies', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Swann', 'reacted', 'surroundings', 'had', 'gotten', 'lost', 'modern', 'America', 'had', 'traveled', 'past', 'Most', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'have', 'principal', 'character', 'characters', 'know', 'traveled', 'past', 'have', 'react', 'accordingly.This', 'movie', 'have', 'plot', 'holes', 'typical', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'general', 'especially', 'low', 'budget', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'However', 'movie', 'sufficiently', 'interesting', 'keep', 'watching', 'see', 'what', 'Lyle', 'Swann', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'most', 'time', 'anyway', 'biggest', 'problem', 'DVD', 'release', 'replaced', 'ending', 'originally', 'seen', 'HBO', 'available', 'VHS', 'awful', 'ending', 'significantly', 'less', 'irony', 'found', 'personally', 'less', 'satisfying', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'had', 'original', 'ending', 'been', 'retained.Michael', 'Nesmith', 'co-produced', 'movie', 'also', 'wrote', 'music', 'cameo', 'People', 'who', 'remember', '60', 'well', 'may', 'recall', 'Nesmith', 'was', 'member', 'Monkees', 'tallest', 'member', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'two', 'members', 'who', 'could', 'actually', 'play', 'instruments', 'when', 'joined', 'band', 'Nesmith', 'became', 'powerful', 'force', 'music', 'video', 'business', 'producing', 'videos', 'records', 'still', 'recording', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'numerous', 'projects', 'departing', 'Monkees.Even', 'awful', 'change', 'end', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'want', 'see', 'different', 'take', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'serious', 'sincere', 'tone', 'rather', 'being', 'played', 'laughs', 'Indeed', 'are', 'several', 'violent', 'deaths', 'movie', 'make', 'movie', 'unsuitable', 'family', 'members', 'younger', '12', '13', 'years', 'change', 'ending', 'recommend', 'either', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'VHS', 'original', 'ending', 'wait', 'DVD', 'out', 'original', 'ending.Good', 'luck']",N/A

Only three options are available. Play movie, bonus features, and audio options.Now for the main and most important question I'm sure many people want answered. A scene involving the main villains death, Porter Reese. Played by Peter Coyote near the end of the movie. On Vhs the scene is in place. Years later it was released on dvd by Anchor Bay. The scene is edited resulting in angering many fans of the movie, including myself. Anchor Bay failed miserably. The dvd is now out of print. So don't bother wasting your money.So to answer your question everyone, yes. Yes the bloody boots scene IS included in the Blu-Ray! The movie is uncut as it was intended to be.

573972,A1P6NRWDD1NT4B,B000059PPC,"Yendor ""sknayfan""","[3, 5]","Fred Ward stars in another film that emphasized the main character in the title.  Ward was in a film called  REMO WILLIAMS: THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES.  The original title when this film was released was called TIMERIDER: THE ADVENTURE OF LYLE SWAN. A motocross racer (Swan/Ward),circa 1980's, is caught in a time travel experiment with motorcycle in tow, and is unwittingly sent back to around the 1870's. Then he is chased down by gunslinging cowboys who want his 'machine'.This reviewer fondly remembers seeing this film 20 plus years ago and it seemed to be more fun and adventurous (probably because this reviewer was watching it with a bunch of drinking buddies).  Seeing it again, it didn't hold up as it seemed to be slow and left a lot of things unexplained. Also, one of the other reviews on this page for TIMERIDER confirmed my suspicions.  One of the memorable sequences is near the end when Peter Coyote's character, Reese, is decapitated by a helicopter and all that's left was was his upright empty boots on a cliff with blood and smoke coming out of them. The DVD version is totally different as Reese just stops shooting and is seen just ducking down to avoid the helicopter as Lyle Swan (Ward) escapes. It didn't make sense, and it took away from the whole atmosphere of the film. Otherwise, the rest of the film is a decent time travel story and with a slight social commentary of old world meeting new world in terms of technology and mechanization (i.e. Lyle Swan's motorcycle is perceived in the 1870's as an evil entity).  The film is helped with a great support cast with Richard Masur (THE THING),TRACEY WALTER (BATMAN, CITY SLICKERS), Ed Lauter (THE LONGEST YARD),L.Q. Jones,Peter Coyote, and a sexy Belinda Bauer. Michael Nesmith (THE MONKEES) was the co-producer, co-screenwriter, and did the music score.  He even makes a non-speaking cameo in the film (he's one of the spectators (in a close-up scene) watching Lyle Swan riding on his 'bike' in the desert motocycle racing sequences in the first part of the film.) Overall, a film that is a curiosity because Michael Nesmith was involved in its production. However, it doesn't hold up as an adventure film in terms of its popcorn action and its the filmaking techniques.  Lastly, the re-edited ending with Peter Coyote's character living through the helicopter sequence was unnecessary.",3,"Timerider: 3 Stars For Film, 1 Star for the Re-Edit Ending.",1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,2363,"['Fred', 'Ward', 'film', 'emphasized', 'main', 'character', 'title', 'Ward', 'was', 'film', 'called', 'REMO', 'WILLIAMS', 'ADVENTURE', 'CONTINUES', 'original', 'title', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'called', 'TIMERIDER', 'ADVENTURE', 'OF', 'LYLE', 'SWAN', 'A', 'motocross', 'racer', 'Swan/Ward', 'circa', '1980', 'caught', 'time', 'travel', 'experiment', 'motorcycle', 'tow', 'unwittingly', 'sent', 'back', '1870', 'Then', 'chased', 'down', 'gunslinging', 'cowboys', 'who', 'want', ""'machine'.This"", 'reviewer', 'fondly', 'seeing', 'film', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'fun', 'adventurous', 'probably', 'reviewer', 'was', 'watching', 'bunch', 'drinking', 'buddies', 'Seeing', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'seemed', 'be', 'slow', 'left', 'lot', 'things', 'unexplained', 'Also', 'one', 'other', 'reviews', 'page', 'TIMERIDER', 'confirmed', 'suspicions', 'One', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'end', 'when', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'character', 'Reese', 'decapitated', 'helicopter', 'left', 'was', 'was', 'upright', 'empty', 'boots', 'cliff', 'blood', 'smoke', 'coming', 'DVD', 'version', 'totally', 'different', 'Reese', 'just', 'stops', 'shooting', 'seen', 'just', 'ducking', 'down', 'avoid', 'helicopter', 'Lyle', 'Swan', 'Ward', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'took', 'away', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'rest', 'film', 'decent', 'time', 'travel', 'story', 'slight', 'social', 'commentary', 'old', 'world', 'meeting', 'new', 'world', 'terms', 'technology', 'mechanization', 'i.e', 'Lyle', 'Swan', 'motorcycle', 'perceived', '1870', 'evil', 'entity', 'film', 'helped', 'great', 'support', 'cast', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'THE', 'THING', 'TRACEY', 'WALTER', 'BATMAN', 'CITY', 'SLICKERS', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'THE', 'LONGEST', 'YARD', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'sexy', 'Belinda', 'Bauer', 'Michael', 'Nesmith', 'THE', 'MONKEES', 'was', 'co-producer', 'co-screenwriter', 'did', 'music', 'score', 'even', 'non-speaking', 'cameo', 'film', 'one', 'spectators', 'close-up', 'scene', 'watching', 'Lyle', 'Swan', 'riding', ""'bike"", 'desert', 'motocycle', 'racing', 'sequences', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'Overall', 'film', 'curiosity', 'Michael', 'Nesmith', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'However', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'adventure', 'film', 'terms', 'popcorn', 'action', 'filmaking', 'techniques', 'Lastly', 're-edited', 'ending', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'character', 'living', 'helicopter', 'sequence', 'was', 'unnecessary']",N/A
