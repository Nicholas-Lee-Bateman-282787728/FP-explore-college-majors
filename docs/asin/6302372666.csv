309000,A3GGZVR1I4U907,6302372666,Alex Shuris,"[5, 6]","This 90 minute DVD (or VHS) is a great look at the &quot;old Metallica&quot;, before they began to slide in 1996, with the release of the mediocre &quot;Load&quot; album. I actually purchased this tape during the &quot;ReLoad&quot; era, and was blown away by the raw energy of their early live shows, and Cliff Burton's &quot;Hendrix-style&quot; bass pyro-technics. The tracks &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, &quot;Sanitarium&quot;, and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; are worth the $20 alone you will pay for this collection. The other tunes are recorded a bit less professionally, but the sound quality is decent. &quot;Dave Mustaine (former-Megadeth)&quot; is featured on lead guitar on one song, and Cliff Burton's 2nd gig ever is captured on film as well. If you love the recordings &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot;, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and &quot;Garage Days 1984&quot;, then this rare glimpse of early Metallica is a great purchase. Hey, also check out&quot;Live Sh*t (DVD version)(2002)&quot;, &quot;Cunning Stunts (1998)&quot;, and &quot;The Making of the Black Album (2001 documentary).&quot;&quot;Live Sh*t&quot; is by far Metallica's best live release.

309001,A3SGXREFATIF1U,6302372666,"Amy ""circleofdestruction.net""","[2, 2]","In the early '90s I had an umpteenth-generation dubbed VHS copy of this and a friend of mine and I watched it nearly every single day. The videotape squeaked and never wanted to rewind fully. The sound quality deteriorated until you could only tell what song they were playing by watching closeups of their hands on the guitars. We didn't care, and continued to watch it every day anyway, so good is this video.Now, after Load was released I think I actually went a full decade without listening to even one Metallica song, I was so disgruntled by it. I still haven't heard anything they've done after Load, but, you know, enough is enough. I've forgiven them, because there first few albums are still great. I still am depressed about the fact that, when ask people, ""Do you remember when Metallica didn't suck?"" people make me feel like a crusty old person. Many people do not remember. If they got this DVD, they could perhaps understand. Maybe it's the nostalgia value, but words cannot adequately convey my love of this compilation. It's mostly live clips but some humorous interview footage is also thrown in. (Interviewer asks how long the band has been together, James answers, ""...since we started..."")As implied by the name, this is obviously all stuff from when Cliff was still around. (R.I.P., Cliff.) In case you're clueless, he's that tall, puffy cloud of hair with the Misfits tattoo, and of course it collects a good amount of bass solos.Song choices are good and there is a clip of them covering ""Am I Evil?"" The video and sound quality varies, as some of this is bootleg video-sourced and other stuff was professionally-shot. But the fuzzy videos from the early days are still awesome due the amount of energy and the quality of the music, despite some quality problems and the fact that James doesn't sound great on some of the songs. Watching this, I can almost forget about Metallica's later stuff, and that is a good thing.",5,A great comp. from when Metallica was still good.,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,1945,"['early', 'had', 'umpteenth-generation', 'dubbed', 'VHS', 'copy', 'friend', 'mine', 'watched', 'nearly', 'single', 'day', 'videotape', 'squeaked', 'never', 'wanted', 'rewind', 'fully', 'sound', 'quality', 'deteriorated', 'could', 'only', 'tell', 'what', 'song', 'were', 'playing', 'watching', 'closeups', 'hands', 'guitars', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'continued', 'watch', 'day', 'anyway', 'so', 'good', 'video.Now', 'Load', 'was', 'released', 'think', 'actually', 'went', 'full', 'decade', 'listening', 'even', 'one', 'Metallica', 'song', 'was', 'so', 'disgruntled', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Load', 'know', 'enough', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'forgiven', 'first', 'few', 'albums', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'still', 'am', 'depressed', 'fact', 'when', 'ask', 'people', 'Do', 'remember', 'when', 'Metallica', 'did', ""n't"", 'suck', 'people', 'make', 'feel', 'crusty', 'old', 'person', 'Many', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'got', 'DVD', 'could', 'perhaps', 'understand', 'Maybe', 'nostalgia', 'value', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'adequately', 'convey', 'love', 'compilation', 'mostly', 'live', 'clips', 'humorous', 'interview', 'footage', 'also', 'thrown', 'Interviewer', 'how', 'long', 'band', 'been', 'together', 'James', 'answers', 'started', 'implied', 'name', 'obviously', 'stuff', 'when', 'Cliff', 'was', 'still', 'around', 'R.I.P.', 'Cliff', 'case', ""'re"", 'clueless', 'tall', 'puffy', 'cloud', 'hair', 'Misfits', 'tattoo', 'course', 'good', 'amount', 'bass', 'solos.Song', 'choices', 'are', 'good', 'clip', 'covering', 'Am', 'Evil', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'varies', 'bootleg', 'video-sourced', 'other', 'stuff', 'was', 'professionally-shot', 'fuzzy', 'videos', 'early', 'days', 'are', 'still', 'awesome', 'due', 'amount', 'energy', 'quality', 'music', 'quality', 'problems', 'fact', 'James', ""n't"", 'sound', 'great', 'songs', 'Watching', 'can', 'almost', 'forget', 'Metallica', 'later', 'stuff', 'good', 'thing']",N/A

What set this band completely apart from their competition was how in touch they seemed with their fan base, who were growing increasingly tired of the hairspray, spandex and special effects taking over once decent metal bands. Instead, Metallica seemed much like thier fans themselves. Seeing this video always brings back memories of that concert, for the footage of their opener, ""Creeping Death"", shows a view that almost appears to have been shot in the exact seat I was sitting in! It also reminds me of how powerful & raw these guys were, as opposed to the horrendous performance by Ozzy, who not only cut his encore because ""Jake is sick"", but looked like a bloated, Bea Arthur clone with his big hair and glittery Muumuu. Such a disappointment. The Ultimate Sin indeed. And who knew this would be my last chance to see Cliff Burton? He died a month or two later.This enormously popular video, released two years after Burton died, was watched endlessly by Metal Heads at the time. It may be hard for younger viewers used to such high standards in DVD to adjust to the poor quality contained here. Part of the reasons for this are likely because Metallica was initially fervant opponents to video and any other type of ""sell out"" publicity. This, of course, made them heroes to their fans, but ultimately presented very difficult business compromises for them further down the road. At any rate, this ethic of theirs - while well-intentioned - turns out to be a real shame in hindsight; there may not be any professionally shot footage of them in their younger days.What is here is largely fan-shot (i.e., illegally taped initially, but later released officially by the band) with some television stuff from overseas. Some of the earlier club stuff may have been shot by the band's management so the members could critique their own perfomance. The best quality comes from ""Day on the Green"" in their homebase of Oakland (For Whom the Bell Tolls) which alone makes this worth picking up.Still, this release obviously hasn't been touched in all its 18 years. I'm sure the sound, for one, could be cleaned up considerably with better source material surely in existence someplace, and some original video masters (esp. of the TV stuff) could be tracked down and spruced up. It would be nice for Metallica to take a lesson from the recent Led Zeppelin & Kiss 2-dvd packages and root through their archives to see what would be suitable for a more comprehensive release.

Unlike most rockers who die before they reach the age of thirty, it wasn't Cliff's fault. He was asleep on his tour bus when it crashed in Europe. That said, this DVD shows the REAL Metallica. Not that watered down, Poplica that we have been putting up with since the god-awful Black album.I remember the old days. Those of us who wore our Metal up your ... T-shirts to high school were a special group indeed. No one knew who Metallica were except for a select few. They were underground, dangerous, and played the most kick butt rock n roll ever heard.This DVD captures Metallica in all their glory with Cliff Burton, ""The major rager on the four string mother ...."" as introduced by Jaymz. Bass solos that will blister your ears, the greatest versions of 'Seek and Destroy' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls"" you'll ever hear, and Cliff footage showing Cliff at his humorous best. Did you know ZZ Top was a big influence of his?A lot of people complain that this DVD is no good because it's mostly bootleg footage shot from the crowd. I disagree, the poor quality footage and 'not so happening' sound only enhances the Cliff legend. Back in the days when you didn't know who Metallica was unless you bought an album or went to a show. They were against the establishment, against polished up MTV videos, and against everything that metal was that made itself a joke. Metallica was real and this was real, unmixed, raw footage. It's the Metallica we remember and love, and will never see again.This is the only Metallica DVD worth buying in my opinion. It brings me back to high school parties when we were the bad dudes who dug Metallica.I was a junior in high school when Cliff died and we were all shocked and in disbelief. When reality hit, it was a sad time for us. Gone was metal's most original bass player. Metallica wanted him so bad in the begining that they packed up and moved from LA to San Fran just to have him.Metallica was at it's greatest when they had a bass player that wore bluejean bell-bottoms and a Misfits T-shirt.
