It'll also be great for new fans to explore anime that they didn't get to watch the first time around, or if one if just a fan of collecting anime. This show will not disappoint. The dubbed version is fine, even though i find the main voice actor that dubbs Miaka's voice a bit annoying and wished someone else was cast. Anyways, check this series out. This box sets contains the first half of the first and only season.However, like many reviews have stated, the box set is poorly conceived. It contains 4 DVDs in one DVD case separated by a piece of foam. Chances are, finding it'll be damaged by the time someone opens it. I got two at Best Buy and had to return both.",5,5 Star Show with a ZERO Star Packaging,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",2012,816,"['great', 'show', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'fond', 'memories', '90', 'kids', 'teens', 'who', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'original', 'release', ""'ll"", 'also', 'be', 'great', 'new', 'fans', 'explore', 'anime', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'one', 'just', 'fan', 'collecting', 'anime', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'dubbed', 'version', 'fine', 'even', 'i', 'find', 'main', 'voice', 'actor', 'Miaka', 'voice', 'bit', 'annoying', 'wished', 'someone', 'else', 'was', 'cast', 'Anyways', 'check', 'series', 'out', 'box', 'first', 'half', 'first', 'only', 'season.However', 'many', 'reviews', 'have', 'stated', 'box', 'set', 'poorly', 'conceived', '4', 'DVDs', 'one', 'DVD', 'case', 'separated', 'piece', 'foam', 'Chances', 'are', 'finding', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damaged', 'time', 'someone', 'got', 'two', 'Best', 'Buy', 'had', 'return']",Fushigi Yugi: Season 1

1526986,A1LXMEHG1LLXVQ,B0076YFJHM,Chase Marshall,"[1, 1]","Well I've been a fan of Fushigi Yuugi for years.  A friend of mine has it on DVD, the original release including the OVA and Eikoden.  So when I saw it was rereleased, I was thrilled because the other DVDs are expensive.  And the show still is enjoyable.But the thing is...the packaging.  I bought mine from Best Buy but looking at the reviews here make me realize it doesn't matter whether you bought it at Amazon, Best Buy, or wherever.  The first version the packaging worked fine, didn't actually have any issues.  But the second disc didn't play right.  One episode it wouldn't play fully and a second episode it skipped during the recap at the beginning.  So thankfully it was only a couple days before the 30 day mark so I brought it back to Best Buy and exchanged it.  Got home to find out the third disc wouldn't stay in the case and when I was poking around it cracked and the inner portion popped out.  Shortly after the same thing happened to the second disc spot.  Thought I got them relatively fixed even though the third disc still wouldn't stay in.  Watched the two episodes of Disc 2 that had issues on my first version, they worked fine and watched disc 3 without trouble.  Just watched disc 4 today a couple weeks later...and had issues with I think episode three where it hitches and wont play when you get about half way through the episode and then skips to the end credits.It's annoying because I'm not sure I'll be able to take it back and exchange it.  But it really makes me wonder, because I've never had such of a hard time with a dvd or anime dvd release as I've had with this.  Makes me wonder if the reason why season 2 was pushed back was because they wanted to make sure they made the casing and discs actually work right.  I'm not saying don't buy this, especially if you've already seen the show and have been waiting like me for a more affordable release.  But be cautious and make sure you watch it all as soon as possible so you can see whether there are any playing issues.",3,Good anime buy poor packaging,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,2012,"['Well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Fushigi', 'Yuugi', 'years', 'friend', 'mine', 'DVD', 'original', 'release', 'including', 'OVA', 'Eikoden', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'rereleased', 'was', 'thrilled', 'other', 'DVDs', 'are', 'expensive', 'show', 'still', 'enjoyable.But', 'thing', 'packaging', 'bought', 'mine', 'Best', 'Buy', 'looking', 'reviews', 'here', 'make', 'realize', ""n't"", 'matter', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'Best', 'Buy', 'wherever', 'first', 'version', 'packaging', 'worked', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'issues', 'second', 'disc', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'right', 'One', 'episode', 'would', ""n't"", 'play', 'fully', 'second', 'episode', 'skipped', 'recap', 'beginning', 'So', 'thankfully', 'was', 'only', 'couple', 'days', '30', 'day', 'mark', 'so', 'brought', 'back', 'Best', 'Buy', 'exchanged', 'Got', 'home', 'find', 'out', 'third', 'disc', 'would', ""n't"", 'stay', 'case', 'when', 'was', 'poking', 'cracked', 'inner', 'portion', 'popped', 'out', 'Shortly', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'second', 'disc', 'spot', 'Thought', 'got', 'relatively', 'fixed', 'even', 'third', 'disc', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'stay', 'Watched', 'two', 'episodes', 'Disc', '2', 'had', 'issues', 'first', 'version', 'worked', 'fine', 'watched', 'disc', '3', 'trouble', 'Just', 'watched', 'disc', '4', 'today', 'couple', 'weeks', 'later', 'had', 'issues', 'think', 'episode', 'three', 'where', 'wont', 'play', 'when', 'get', 'way', 'episode', 'then', 'skips', 'end', 'credits.It', 'annoying', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'take', 'back', 'exchange', 'really', 'wonder', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'such', 'hard', 'time', 'dvd', 'anime', 'dvd', 'release', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'reason', 'why', 'season', '2', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'was', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'made', 'casing', 'discs', 'actually', 'work', 'right', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'more', 'affordable', 'release', 'be', 'cautious', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'playing', 'issues']",Fushigi Yugi: Season 1
1526987,AFV2584U13XP3,B0076YFJHM,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","While the series came out mid 90's and doesn't have the massive amount of CGI effects or animation the endearing cast of characters and enjoyable story more then make up for it,I mean look at series like Ranma 1/2,Inu Yasha,Yu Yu Hakusho and others. I've waited for a few years to get this series as until now the previous sets were a little pricey($400+)so I'm greatly appreciative to Anime Works for getting the rights to this series and releasing them at a more reasonable price.The series feels a little mix of Love Hina/Inu Yasha/Magic Knights RayEarth/Sailor Moon, the series animation also feels a mix of these series especially many of the character animation drawings.  The voice cast for the Japanese of course did a terrific job in their character roles and so did 90% of the English cast too though there were one or two who seemed to need some more time to work on their voice acting skills.The extras are alright but I haven't really bothered checking them out so can't tell you how well they are on these sets. Also the set dvd cases aren't the greatest but can easily be replace pretty reasonably so it's not really an issue. So for fans of the series looking to reclaim the joy of owning this entertaining series rejoice as now the series has come out for you to reclaim if you wish as well as getting the OVA sets too now as they have been re-released as well.",5,While A 90's Anime The Story And Entertainment Will Make Up For It,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1378,"['series', 'came', 'mid', '90', ""n't"", 'have', 'massive', 'amount', 'CGI', 'effects', 'animation', 'endearing', 'cast', 'characters', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'more', 'then', 'make', 'up', 'mean', 'look', 'series', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'Inu', 'Yasha', 'Yu', 'Yu', 'Hakusho', 'others', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'few', 'years', 'get', 'series', 'now', 'previous', 'sets', 'were', 'little', 'pricey', '400+', 'so', ""'m"", 'greatly', 'appreciative', 'Anime', 'Works', 'getting', 'rights', 'series', 'releasing', 'more', 'reasonable', 'price.The', 'series', 'little', 'mix', 'Love', 'Hina/Inu', 'Yasha/Magic', 'Knights', 'RayEarth/Sailor', 'Moon', 'series', 'animation', 'also', 'mix', 'series', 'especially', 'many', 'character', 'animation', 'drawings', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'course', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'character', 'roles', 'so', 'did', '90', '%', 'English', 'cast', 'too', 'were', 'one', 'two', 'who', 'seemed', 'need', 'more', 'time', 'work', 'voice', 'acting', 'skills.The', 'extras', 'are', 'alright', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'bothered', 'checking', 'out', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'well', 'are', 'sets', 'Also', 'set', 'dvd', 'cases', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'replace', 'pretty', 'reasonably', 'not', 'really', 'issue', 'So', 'fans', 'series', 'looking', 'reclaim', 'joy', 'owning', 'entertaining', 'series', 'rejoice', 'now', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'reclaim', 'wish', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'OVA', 'sets', 'too', 'now', 'have', 'been', 're-released', 'as', 'well']",Fushigi Yugi: Season 1

Maybe they were rushed or something it was a lot of episodes. It had that early anime feel going on, but i kind of like that. Icant really tell if I am reviewing the show or the shipper, so I'll touch on both. The ending left something to be desired, but that is typical with Japanese tradjedy. The overall story was great, amd the characters were very strong. As for 40k the provider. They gid a great job in packcking the discs. Somewhere in transit the box was totaly smashed and the discs were still ok. They all played fine, even though the season one box was broken.
