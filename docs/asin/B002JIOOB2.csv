1271455,A18CMGIQZ1OAA2,B002JIOOB2,toby,"[1, 1]","Ok, I watched this show from beginning to end on Showtime, I awaited the show after an interview with Guin Turner speaking about an idea for a lesbian show in the works and after the show was over I bought the dvds and watched them again.Its a show about a group of friends in West Hollywood.  Most of them are gay but some are bisexual and straight.  You have your 2 domestic lesbians Bette and Tina, you have your player Shane, busybody Alice, gay athlete Dana, temptress who likes to woo with words (amongst other things), Jenny, who's a self centered head case who thinks her coming to the realization that she's gay is the most important thing on earth, Tim (straight guy trying to make a life with his girlfriend) and Kit, the troubled alcoholic.  Later on a number of other characters come into it Lisa (male who thinks he's a lesbian), Max (transgendered), Carmen (hot dj with a heart of gold), Papi (female embodiment on Don Juan), Sasha -or was it tasha-(soldier trying to avoid a dishonorable discharge because of being gay, Jodi (deaf artist who doesn't care for monogamy), Tom (gay interpreter for Jodi), Helena (millionaires) and Paige (sweet, openminded single mom).  Oh, there are more.  The first set of course being the beginning characters.One thing to know about these women- during at least one occasion in most of their lives they get exactly who they want and then as soon as they get them they decide they want someone else.  It gets aggravating.  These women just love to kick themselves in the butt.  Most of them seem to have everything in the world going for them but to keep the show going they ruin everything they work for.Some of the women are rich, some aren't rich and some are downright struggling for money but they all wear designer clothes.  There are a lot of things about this show that are so far from real life that its ridiculous BUT I love this show.  It keeps me entertained from beginning to end.  These peoples lives get so crazy that it never gets dull.  You basically over a series of 6 years watch most of their lives fall apart.  Its showtime so of course its really sexed up. It has  tons of gay and gay loved groups come through the show like Goddess and She, Betty, Peaches, Sleater Kinney and more.  The music on the shows basically consisted of similar groups though there is also some hip hop.  Snoop Dog was on it for a while as a recurring guest star.The show can be a big predictable but this is my 3rd time going through the series and I still love it.  Season 1-4 were my favorites. After that the characters become more and more unlikeable.  By the time season 5 starts to unfold Its like looking at the pile of unfortunates that have gotten jilted and trampled going through the web of the group of central characters insanity.  By the time Paige left the show I really didn't care so much what happened to Shane, I didn't care what happened with Jenny earlier on than that, Bette and Tina didn't have anyone to blame but themselves for their problems but they didn't seem to see it that way and Max like Bette and Tina blamed others for his own mistakes BUT I love the show.  If you don't watch it all six seasons and stop at 4 you never discover what the show is ultimately leading to.I give the show 5 stars because after watching it in 3 rounds Id be a liar if I didn't.",5,great show about some aggravating people,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,3338,"['Ok', 'watched', 'show', 'beginning', 'end', 'Showtime', 'awaited', 'show', 'interview', 'Guin', 'Turner', 'speaking', 'idea', 'lesbian', 'show', 'works', 'show', 'was', 'bought', 'dvds', 'watched', 'again.Its', 'show', 'group', 'friends', 'West', 'Hollywood', 'Most', 'are', 'gay', 'are', 'bisexual', 'straight', 'have', '2', 'domestic', 'lesbians', 'Bette', 'Tina', 'have', 'player', 'Shane', 'busybody', 'Alice', 'gay', 'athlete', 'Dana', 'temptress', 'who', 'woo', 'words', 'other', 'things', 'Jenny', 'who', 'self', 'centered', 'head', 'case', 'who', 'coming', 'realization', 'gay', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'earth', 'Tim', 'straight', 'guy', 'trying', 'make', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Kit', 'troubled', 'alcoholic', 'Later', 'number', 'other', 'characters', 'come', 'Lisa', 'male', 'who', 'lesbian', 'Max', 'transgendered', 'Carmen', 'hot', 'dj', 'heart', 'gold', 'Papi', 'female', 'embodiment', 'Don', 'Juan', 'Sasha', '-or', 'was', 'tasha-', 'soldier', 'trying', 'avoid', 'dishonorable', 'discharge', 'being', 'gay', 'Jodi', 'deaf', 'artist', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'monogamy', 'Tom', 'gay', 'interpreter', 'Jodi', 'Helena', 'millionaires', 'Paige', 'sweet', 'openminded', 'single', 'mom', 'Oh', 'are', 'more', 'first', 'set', 'course', 'being', 'beginning', 'characters.One', 'thing', 'know', 'women-', 'least', 'one', 'occasion', 'most', 'lives', 'get', 'exactly', 'who', 'want', 'then', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'decide', 'want', 'someone', 'else', 'aggravating', 'women', 'just', 'love', 'kick', 'butt', 'Most', 'seem', 'have', 'everything', 'world', 'going', 'keep', 'show', 'going', 'ruin', 'everything', 'work', 'for.Some', 'women', 'are', 'rich', 'are', ""n't"", 'rich', 'are', 'downright', 'struggling', 'money', 'wear', 'designer', 'clothes', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'real', 'life', 'ridiculous', 'BUT', 'love', 'show', 'entertained', 'beginning', 'end', 'peoples', 'get', 'so', 'crazy', 'never', 'dull', 'basically', 'series', '6', 'years', 'watch', 'most', 'lives', 'fall', 'apart', 'showtime', 'course', 'really', 'sexed', 'up', 'tons', 'gay', 'gay', 'loved', 'groups', 'come', 'show', 'Goddess', 'Betty', 'Peaches', 'Sleater', 'Kinney', 'more', 'music', 'shows', 'basically', 'consisted', 'similar', 'groups', 'also', 'hip', 'hop', 'Snoop', 'Dog', 'was', 'while', 'recurring', 'guest', 'star.The', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'big', 'predictable', '3rd', 'time', 'going', 'series', 'still', 'love', 'Season', '1-4', 'were', 'favorites', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'unlikeable', 'time', 'season', '5', 'starts', 'unfold', 'looking', 'pile', 'unfortunates', 'have', 'gotten', 'jilted', 'trampled', 'going', 'web', 'group', 'central', 'characters', 'insanity', 'time', 'Paige', 'left', 'show', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'Shane', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'happened', 'Jenny', 'earlier', 'Bette', 'Tina', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anyone', 'blame', 'problems', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'way', 'Max', 'Bette', 'Tina', 'blamed', 'others', 'own', 'mistakes', 'BUT', 'love', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'six', 'seasons', 'stop', '4', 'never', 'discover', 'what', 'show', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'to.I', 'give', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'watching', '3', 'rounds', 'Id', 'be', 'liar', 'did', ""n't""]",N/A
