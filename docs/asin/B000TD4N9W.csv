1089197,A28Z84QTQ3ZLF3,B000TD4N9W,a movie fan,"[2, 2]","The first season was released on 2 discs, 11 episodes/disc, and looked as bad as that sounds - anyone with a DVD burner could make copies at least that good. The next two seasons had 8 episodes/disc, and didn't look much better, blurry and with numerous artifacts. Season four has 6 episodes/disc and looks noticeably better, but still not good. Like Dharma and Greg, this show is just not getting a fair shot on DVD. Consider a program like HBO's Rome, which puts 3 widescreen 50 min episodes on a disc, and the quality is outstanding, not BLU-ray, but close enough that I'll never bother replacing the DVDs. Mad About You puts 6 fullscreen 21 min episodes on a disc, and it looks obviously digitized (at least, on a big screen; it's probably decent on a TV). I suppose they have sandwiched this into a DVD-5 to save money, but it is a shame that such an outstanding show should have this kind of legacy. I'm hoping that Mad, Dharma, Wings,  and the other classic shows that have had inadequate DVD releases will one day have a BLU-ray release that does them justice.

This season was a turning point in the show and the laughter slowly gives way to the seriousness of relationship troubles as this season draws to a close.Much could be said about the last three episodes of the fourth season. Suffice it to say, these three shows, a trilogy story arc within the greater arc of the series, really bring home the reality of marriage - the side you never see in most series, let alone a sit-com. But, as we all know, this was more than just another sit-com. As M*A*S*H became more than a series of setups, prat falls and yuks featuring doctors at war, MAY demonstrates the depth and range of the actors, giving them dialogue that was about as close to ""real"" as you can get during the park bench scene. Chilling stuff.And with Season Five slated for a late 2010 release, it appears the powers that be are beginning to hear our cries for getting on with finishing the release of the remaining seasons.

Dean ""John""","[2, 4]","Always loved this show, one of the few back then that I used to actually make sure to watch when it was on.But for me, the first through third seasons were the best, because in this season, they started getting way too contrived, with the baby and marriage problems, that it just lost some of the appeal, started feeling more like just another sitcom.Up until this season, it was a smooth flowing, fun ride, and while i wouldn't have minded a more serious bent to the last part of the fourth season, it was how they went about it that just rang so hollow.  Out of the blue, suddenly the marriage is in danger, and the setup for the various things was just so planned, it took away the enjoyment.  The show where they were trying to talk, and suddenly everyone was showing up at their door, for instance...  They live up in the building, only way to get there is to go on the stairs or elevator, and there is no way the elevator could go up and down and bring up new people within 10 seconds, yet in one episode, their doorbell rings over and over, as if they all came up separately, but there is no possible way for that to have happened.  And the whole last end of the season has that feel, things just thrown at the wall in hopes something would stick.The beginning of the season is still good though, hence the reason I still gave it four stars.  And even the bad shows still have moments of hilarity, but this was the beginning of the end, and it unfortunately mars the series.Other than that, though, still glad this finally came out on DVD, as I have had seasons 1 through 3 forever it seems, and had wondered if it was ever going to come out.
