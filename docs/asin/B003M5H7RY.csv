1353908,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003M5H7RY,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","WORRIED ABOUT THE BOY (a/k/a Karma Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on, 2012, Dir. Julian Jarrold, 92 minutes, UK original screening May, 2010) is a classy biopic about a true hero of mine, George O'Dowd. We all know him as Boy George. It is impossible to tell why this is listed as BOO HOO when the film and the DVD is rightly titledWorried About the Boy(I have a review under that one also). The title is a reference to George's father, who is worried about him in his early years.Sadly confined to only a few years' time, this classy, well-executed and artful work is probably the only Boy George biopic I will live to see - thus I am ecstatic about it. And it is the best biopic of its kind.Beginning with Boy George's youth in 1980 (he's played by a far too old and skinny Douglas Booth, who is a gay Johnny Depp clone best known for playing Pip in Masterpiece'sMasterpiece Classic: Great Expectations), this pings back and forth between two periods in the five unsettled years when music was super-hot and the artists were just the opposite.Until the other side of that timeline, all of which I recall well and fondly, when Boy George brought true beauty to music. In 1980, however, Boy George is trying his best, but he can't seem to break out and move beyond his 'fashion photo' appearances.He meets Steve Strange (Marc Warren, a Strange clone!), who gives him his first job as coat-checker at Strange's Blitz Club. Pinging forward in time, we see the Boy under what is apparently house arrest, though I couldn't tell. From the date shown in the film (mid-1980s), he had just left Culture Club and I do not really recall him being in trouble with the law then. That part is completely confusing.Backward in time - 1980 - he meets a cocky and corrosive Jon Moss (Matthew Horne), who as we all know will be Culture Club's controversial drummer boy. But in 1980, he was just another smart-ass kid. Odd that in this film Jon, who was quite handsome and very short, should be almost as tall as Boy George and quite ugly in comparison. That is just one of the inexplicable screw-ups here that put me off a little. It is as bad as the almost miscast Douglas Booth, who unlike Boy George is rather short, rail thin and beautiful ... in another way than Boy George is.And almost every actor here is obviously ten or twelve years too old.In other words, somehow I didn't 'feel' it. Don't get me wrong: everyone is BRILLIANT, with classy, powerful acting and a touching bunch of moments in time are artfully presented. The trouble is, this life and music, the clothes and attitude, take me back to my youth. As I said, the performers didn't make me 'feel' it.I'd murder for a CD of the soundtrack (and this also makes me want to get the Bow Wow Wow songs that George sang).Don't let my grumpy mood discourage you. If you want to really be immersed in the world that gave birth to Boy George, if you want to learn about him, if you really don't want to hurt him, then get this beautiful film.With the added talents of Francis Magee as George's beloved father Jerry, Freddie Fox, Richard Madden, and Mark Gatiss as the legendary Malcolm McLaren.",5,"""Gay men think you're too much."" -Marilyn",1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,3127,"['WORRIED', 'BOY', 'a/k/a', 'Karma', 'Cam', 'eacute', 'eacute', '2012', 'Dir', 'Julian', 'Jarrold', '92', 'minutes', 'UK', 'original', 'screening', 'May', '2010', 'classy', 'biopic', 'true', 'hero', 'mine', 'George', ""O'Dowd"", 'know', 'Boy', 'George', 'impossible', 'tell', 'why', 'listed', 'BOO', 'HOO', 'when', 'film', 'DVD', 'rightly', 'titledWorried', 'Boy', 'have', 'review', 'one', 'also', 'title', 'reference', 'George', 'father', 'who', 'worried', 'early', 'years.Sadly', 'confined', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'classy', 'well-executed', 'artful', 'work', 'probably', 'only', 'Boy', 'George', 'biopic', 'will', 'live', 'see', 'thus', 'am', 'ecstatic', 'best', 'biopic', 'kind.Beginning', 'Boy', 'George', 'youth', '1980', 'played', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'skinny', 'Douglas', 'Booth', 'who', 'gay', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'clone', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Pip', ""Masterpiece'sMasterpiece"", 'Classic', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'pings', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'periods', 'five', 'unsettled', 'years', 'when', 'music', 'was', 'super-hot', 'artists', 'were', 'just', 'opposite.Until', 'other', 'side', 'timeline', 'recall', 'well', 'fondly', 'when', 'Boy', 'George', 'brought', 'true', 'beauty', 'music', '1980', 'however', 'Boy', 'George', 'trying', 'best', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'break', 'out', 'move', ""'fashion"", 'photo', 'appearances.He', 'meets', 'Steve', 'Strange', 'Marc', 'Warren', 'Strange', 'clone', 'who', 'first', 'job', 'coat-checker', 'Strange', 'Blitz', 'Club', 'Pinging', 'forward', 'time', 'see', 'Boy', 'what', 'apparently', 'house', 'arrest', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'date', 'shown', 'film', 'mid-1980s', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'Culture', 'Club', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'recall', 'being', 'trouble', 'law', 'then', 'part', 'completely', 'confusing.Backward', 'time', '1980', 'cocky', 'corrosive', 'Jon', 'Moss', 'Matthew', 'Horne', 'who', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'Culture', 'Club', 'controversial', 'drummer', 'boy', '1980', 'was', 'just', 'smart-ass', 'kid', 'film', 'Jon', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'handsome', 'very', 'short', 'should', 'be', 'almost', 'as', 'tall', 'Boy', 'George', 'quite', 'ugly', 'comparison', 'just', 'one', 'inexplicable', 'screw-ups', 'here', 'put', 'off', 'little', 'as', 'bad', 'almost', 'miscast', 'Douglas', 'Booth', 'who', 'Boy', 'George', 'rather', 'short', 'rail', 'thin', 'beautiful', 'way', 'Boy', 'George', 'almost', 'actor', 'here', 'obviously', 'ten', 'twelve', 'years', 'too', 'old.In', 'other', 'words', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", ""'feel"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'BRILLIANT', 'classy', 'powerful', 'acting', 'touching', 'bunch', 'moments', 'time', 'are', 'artfully', 'presented', 'trouble', 'life', 'music', 'clothes', 'attitude', 'take', 'back', 'youth', 'said', 'performers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', ""'feel"", 'it.I', ""'d"", 'murder', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'want', 'get', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Wow', 'George', 'sang', '.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'grumpy', 'mood', 'discourage', 'want', 'really', 'be', 'immersed', 'world', 'gave', 'birth', 'Boy', 'George', 'want', 'learn', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'then', 'get', 'beautiful', 'added', 'talents', 'Francis', 'Magee', 'George', 'beloved', 'father', 'Jerry', 'Freddie', 'Fox', 'Richard', 'Madden', 'Mark', 'Gatiss', 'legendary', 'Malcolm', 'McLaren']",Worried About the Boy 2010

1353910,A2S29EES9TA9ZM,B003M5H7RY,hredzak,"[1, 1]","I first saw this online when it came out a couple of years ago because it wasn't available here. I was pleased to see it released in 2012 for a USA-compatible DVD player.I loved it. It's not perfect or as long as I wanted it to be, but I still loved it. But I also understand it wasn't created to be a complete biography of the rise and fall of Culture Club... or of Boy George. It doesn't illustrate the impact this guy had on fans, perceptions of sexuality, popular culture, or music. You won't even hear more than a couple of Culture Club songs here. I get the complaints, I really do. But those bio's have been done before. Check out VH1's Behind the Music for a full bio, for example.This is something different. This movie is a snapshot of the love and loss that led to the creation of Culture Club and Boy George's fall into addiction. It has parallel stories that start in 1980 with another of him in the midst of addiction in 1986. And not much more. But that doesn't make it any less fascinating. These are his key connections that probably shaped the rest of his life. And they were the parts most hidden from the public.Personally, I loved the casting. I know the lead who plays George is shorter, slimmer, and prettier... but when George first came out he was beautiful and womanly. We didn't know what he was, yet women, men, children, grannies... we all loved him and his music. I think the beauty we saw and loved is represented in the casting. The actor who plays Jon also looks older and less sexy than Jon actually was... but he's got down the confidence, aloofness, and seductive energy that shaped George and the band.Loved beautiful Marilyn and the peek into The Blitz Club and all the other characters- Malcolm McLaren was hilarious. This may only be a snapshot, but it's a pretty one... and a very witty and often funny one to boot. A real glimpse of the time period and the spirit that brought on so much change in music, fashion, and culture. And it's a moving revelation of what drove George at the core.I would have preferred a bigger story, too.

1353911,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B003M5H7RY,Jeffery Mingo,"[5, 5]","The public gets nostalgic after 20 years.  I remember when there was a Monkees' craze in the 1980s.  Then, in the early 1990s, young people learned about Jim Morrison through the Stone film.  In late 1999, I told some friends, ""The 2000s is when folk will rediscover Culture Club!""  Well, I was off by a decade, but this film shows that it happened, at least ""across the pond.""You don't have to be a Culture Club fan to enjoy this film.  However, if you had the book ""When Cameras Go Crazy"" and if you read Boy George's ""Take It like a Man,"" then you will love this.  The outfits matched real life.  The gist of the story is factual.  It was like being a fly on the wall before Culture Club blew up.  I never saw ""Taboo,"" so I can't say which was more authentic, but this seemed very real to me.  Their lack of altering the facts is a sign of the compelling story that La O'Dowd has.  For non-fans, this will be a shocker.  Boy George didn't always have a ragdoll look.  Here he's more like a Frankenstein.  If you remember the ""Behind the Music"" episode, Jon Moss stated, ""He [Boy George] was weirder then than he was in Culture Club.""The actor playing Boy George did a wonderful job.  Like Boy George, he has a smooth chest.  The real Boy George has complained about his weak chin and this actor had a strong jaw line instead.  The cover of the DVD resembles the American cover of ""Kissing to be Clever.""  I think the actor playing Mikey Craig probably has just one Black parent whereas Mikey surely has two, but he did look like the bassist.  In an interview, Boy George said Jon Moss gave advice on the set.  The actor playing him also resembled him.  They show him in a pair of briefs and that makes sense as he was the hottie of the band.  The Roy Hay character looked NOTHING like the real Roy Hay.  Mr. Hay's look is not unique, so I'm surprised they couldn't find a more appropriate actor.  In fairness, Roy seems like he wants the least to do with the band, so I doubt he cared one way or the other.I'm an African American and in my community there's a furor about the supposed ""down low.""  Although this cast is mostly Caucasian, I think those interested in that subject would find this interesting.  This film shows all kind of men who want to kick it with Boy George but not be seen as a sexual minority.  They desire him, but don't want their status as ""one of the lads"" to be diminished.  This is an interesting study on how some men want to maximize man-squared sex but want to minimize facing homophobia.  The film uses the real name of one of Boy George's ex-boyfriends, Kirk Brandon.  Since he lost his defamation suit against the singer when ""Take It like a Man"" was published, I guess he must have accepted his fate and allowed his name to be used.  Then again, maybe the filmmakers gave him some ka-CHING.  Then again too, some say, ""There's no such thing as bad publicity.""Malcolm McLaren plays a big part in this film, even though he's only mentioned a few times in ""Take It like a Man.""  Mark Gatiss did a fantastic job portraying him (and he has a nice ginger hairy chest too).  The real McLaren died one month after this was aired in Britain.  Again, ""there's no such thing as bad publicity.""  However, he's portrayed as shady and manipulative.  As he had connections with the Sex Pistols and Boy George, some may want to see this film alongside ""Sid & Nancy.""  Still, McLaren fans may be highly upset about the portrayal here.  Viewers may ask themselves, ""How could the maker of 'Deep in Vogue' have been such a jerk!?""Another surprising portrayal is that of Jeremiah O'Dowd, George's father.  In the film, he comes off as a caring, outstanding parent.  However, Boy George's mother Dinah has written an excellent autobiography called ""Cry Salty Tears"" in which she revealed that her husband was abusive, violent, duplicitous, and probably mentally ill.  He pointed a knife at his wife when she was carrying George!  Wearing my feminist hat, his positive presence here, compared to Mrs. O'Dowd's near invisibility here, is disturbing.  Then again, Boy George himself did not reveal his father's bad side until this past decade.Like many Americans, I have beef with ""Take It like a Man"" because it was drowning in British slang that made no sense to me.  In fairness, if an African-American singer wrote an autobiography, I'd probably understand the lingo in a snap while British readers would be perplexed.  This film is not loaded with British vernacular.  An American viewer would be able to understand it.",5,Two Snaps!

1353912,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003M5H7RY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Want to know why the world fell in love with larger-than-life Boy George? So would I. Not much indication is given in ""Worried About The Boy,"" a portrait of the early years of the pop superstar. Director Julian Jarrold has a colorful canvas to draw from with the changing music and fashion scenes of the late seventies and early eighties. And indeed, the movie does depict this world very well. What is less successful, however, is putting a relatable face on George O' Dowd (well played by Douglas Booth). This is not a particularly enlightening look at any specific aspect of O' Dowd. If anything, it makes him out to be a selfish brat who happened into stardom with minimal effort. That may well be true, but as the film does not cover the Culture Club years--there is still little connection to the figure who would become an icon to many.The film begins with O' Dowd moving out of his parents home to pursue some sort of existence in Central London. Extravagant in dress and manner (before the film starts, he is fully wearing Boy George drag as everyday wear), he ends up in a dump with an instant group of new friends. The film does not examine anything that made Boy George who he is, detail how he began this new life, or give him any appreciable growth throughout the movie. He starts and ends as exactly the same person, the screenplay offers no new insight. Through a couple of boyfriends, he moves from club rat to musician. Again, he's never expressed the slightest interest in music before he's suddenly headlining a band and getting noticed. And as I've said, he's not a particularly likable fellow nor is his journey (as depicted) really noteworthy.The one thing the movie does quite well is to create the cavalier party atmosphere of the Blitz Club. Marc Warren camps it up delightfully as Steve Strange and the period recreation of this drug fueled world is believable and fascinating. Booth does well as the petulant George O' Dowd. I just wish the story would have clued me into just what the appeal or advantage of even being his friend, much less his lover or business partner, would have been. He's singularly unpleasant. Mathew Horne and Richard Madden are likable as love interests for Boy George, Freddie Fox is great as best friend Marilyn, and Mark Gatiss scores big in one scene impersonating Malcolm McLaren. Technically, ""Worried About the Boy"" has plenty to recommend it. It just lacks any particular insight to make it truly memorable. And if you're hoping for a great Culture Club soundtrack, you get only one song. Wanted to love it, but feel more ambivalent than anything.

Most of the film takes place in his years after school and before Culture Club, with a splash of his late 80's addiction drama.  It's possible they could have added a bit more actual history to the story line and deleted a bit of the fluff, but showing George's early years to make it more engaging, but he was more style than substance in real life.  The acting was pretty good. The George fellow was great.I felt as if this movie should have filled in the gap between 1983-1987 to make it feel complete.  As I said, the acting was impressive.  The filming was very good quality.  Had they added this to their timeline, I suspect it could have been sold to a larger distributor and more marketing would have been done to promote this movie -- and it would have been more of a success.  It felt like an unfinished project.It's no fun to 2-star rate this, but having been quite a hard-core fan throughout the 80's and into the 90's I know there many other stories that could have been added to make this more interesting.  And for folks that just liked Culture Club, well... they will probably want to see a bit more of that time frame in the film.

This film focused a lot on his time at the Blitz with very little time on how he came to be with Culture Club.  Oh sure, it touches on that, but it's like most of the details are left out.  The story is more about his relationships during that time rather than the walk to fame and fortune.  It fails to show how he came about his particular style, where he learned make-up, etc.  Mostly club scenes, boy-meets-boy scenes, a couple of mix-ups with his dad and an annoying back and forth thing between the past and the ""present"".  All in all very confusing leaving more questions than answers.  I would not recommend this movie as one to see how George O'Dowd became Boy George and Culture Club.
