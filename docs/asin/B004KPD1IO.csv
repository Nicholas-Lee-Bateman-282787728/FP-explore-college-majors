1412404,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B004KPD1IO,Bill Garrison,"[2, 2]","WHAT IF is a great Christian movie, and almost an exact retelling of the Nicholas Cage film, FAMILY MAN. But, that's a good thing because the premise creates a great story.The movie opens with Ben Walker leaving his girlfriend Wendy (Kevin Sorbo and Kristy Swanson, or Hercules and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) with promises of returning in a few months to continue their relationship. But, Ben never returns and the movie cuts away to 15 years in the future when Ben is a successful businessman focused only on money and material success. He finds out Wendy is in town for a missionary fundraiser, and sends a check, but doesn't have time to go himself. An angel (John Ratzenburger) has other plans, and soon takes Ben to a world where he actually married Wendy and had two girls (one is Debbie Ryan from Suite Life on Deck). Ben has no clue about what to do in this new life where he faces the responsibility of being a father, a husband, and a pastor.While obvious this is a low budget film, it is quite enjoyable (if a bit long). There is a lot of humor in Ben's attempt to be a pastor, especially when counseling a couple for marriage. This movie covers in all, including a conversion scene. I love the message in the movie, but this same message may seem contrived to the jaded general public. But, for the budget, this movie has good acting and high production values.But, this movie is what it is. Cries for more movies to be made like this are going to fall on deaf ears. This isn't a mass market movie, but one for Christians to enjoy and use to minister to others in their own home or at church.",5,"GREAT Christian movie, but don't know about crossover appeal",1314403200,"08 27, 2011",2011,1603,"['WHAT', 'IF', 'great', 'Christian', 'movie', 'almost', 'exact', 'retelling', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'film', 'FAMILY', 'MAN', 'good', 'thing', 'premise', 'great', 'story.The', 'movie', 'Ben', 'Walker', 'leaving', 'girlfriend', 'Wendy', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Kristy', 'Swanson', 'Hercules', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'promises', 'returning', 'few', 'months', 'continue', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'never', 'movie', 'away', '15', 'years', 'future', 'when', 'Ben', 'successful', 'businessman', 'focused', 'only', 'money', 'material', 'success', 'out', 'Wendy', 'town', 'missionary', 'fundraiser', 'check', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'go', 'angel', 'John', 'Ratzenburger', 'other', 'plans', 'soon', 'Ben', 'world', 'where', 'actually', 'married', 'Wendy', 'had', 'two', 'girls', 'one', 'Debbie', 'Ryan', 'Suite', 'Life', 'Deck', 'Ben', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'new', 'life', 'where', 'responsibility', 'being', 'father', 'husband', 'pastor.While', 'obvious', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'bit', 'long', 'lot', 'humor', 'Ben', 'attempt', 'be', 'pastor', 'especially', 'when', 'counseling', 'couple', 'marriage', 'movie', 'including', 'conversion', 'scene', 'love', 'message', 'movie', 'same', 'message', 'may', 'seem', 'contrived', 'jaded', 'general', 'public', 'budget', 'movie', 'good', 'acting', 'high', 'production', 'values.But', 'movie', 'what', 'Cries', 'more', 'movies', 'be', 'made', 'are', 'going', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears', ""n't"", 'mass', 'market', 'movie', 'one', 'Christians', 'enjoy', 'use', 'minister', 'others', 'own', 'home', 'church']",What If...

I was surprised that The Santa Suit had not been released on DVD at the time and this is what I got. I would have sent it back but I read about it and took a chance and watched it. I'm extremely glad that I did. It's hard to imagine John Ratzenberger as an angel because it's a very different kind of role for him but he was very good. He's a very different kind of angel. Ben Walker (Kevin Sorbo) is a man who is all about money (much like his role on The Santa Suit) but this movie has a much nicer plot. What if God gave second chances? It makes you wonder what you wouldn't have done differently. Ben Walker's first sermon at the new church is rather funny, but embarassing to his family. It truly shows how far he has to go to get back to his heart. But he does and it's a very good movie. I'm sure we'll watch it many times.

1412412,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B004KPD1IO,C. Long,"[0, 0]","This is a fairly well-made movie that genuinely is interesting, entertaining, and meaningful.While browsing the video shelf of a local store, I picked this movie up on a couple of different occasions to read what it was about, and each time quickly put it back thinking ""this looks over the top ridiculous"" and thinking I would find it theologically offensive. But then I happened to catch the last 30 minutes of it while over at a friend's house and it genuinely looked like a good movie, so I bought it and watched the whole thing. And I was NOT disappointed.Basically the main character earlier in his life runs from God and His call on his life, as well as his girlfriend. Later on, God (working through an angel) shows him what his life would have looked like if he had chosen differently (i.e. correctly). The guy actually starts living this ""alternate reality"". Eventually, after learning what he needs to learn, he goes back to his true real life with fresh perspective and a fresh start.Theologically, yes there are of course some ""issues"" with this movie. I don't believe God has people live out these alternate lives nor do I think the angel portrayal is spot-on, etc. However, the movie just uses this ""what if"" plotline really as a showcase of its greater message. In other words, I don't think it is intended to be taken dogmatically but as a ""device"" to make the point. There's a relatively good salvation scene (when compared to several other ""Christian/faith-based movies"") and there are loads of good messages in this movie.I can say without reservation that I left this movie feeling hopeful, encouraged, and spurred-on towards making my own life count in what really matters.The acting and production quality was relatively decent. I would put it in the ""really good made-for-t.v. movie"" category.All things considered, this is a good movie, but if you're watching with kids or brand-new-believers you might want to address some of the theological issues. After all, you don't want your 10-year-old thinking that God might whisk them off to live an alternate life, do you? This movie can set the stage for some interesting discussions regarding our choices, God's will for our lives, whether God is usually as ""pushy"" as He comes across in the movie in pushing the guy back to where He needs to be as opposed to gently nudging etc. Other discussion points could be the foolishness of waiting to the last minute to accept the Lord (as occurs with a character in the movie), what the family unit is to ideally look like - the importance of a united family, the importance of going forward into a bright future regardless of your past - that while unable to change your past choices, you can have a ""new beginning"" and go forward NOW with Jesus, and much more.Reviewed by MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians dot org",5,"Inspiring & Entertaining, but definitely has theological ""issues""",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,2835,"['fairly', 'well-made', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'meaningful.While', 'browsing', 'video', 'shelf', 'local', 'store', 'picked', 'movie', 'up', 'couple', 'different', 'occasions', 'read', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'time', 'quickly', 'put', 'back', 'thinking', 'top', 'ridiculous', 'thinking', 'would', 'find', 'theologically', 'offensive', 'then', 'happened', 'catch', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'friend', 'house', 'genuinely', 'looked', 'good', 'movie', 'bought', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'NOT', 'disappointed.Basically', 'main', 'character', 'earlier', 'life', 'God', 'call', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'girlfriend', 'Later', 'God', 'working', 'angel', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'had', 'chosen', 'differently', 'i.e', 'correctly', 'guy', 'actually', 'living', 'alternate', 'reality', 'Eventually', 'learning', 'what', 'learn', 'back', 'true', 'real', 'life', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'fresh', 'start.Theologically', 'yes', 'are', 'course', 'issues', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'people', 'live', 'alternate', 'lives', 'do', 'think', 'angel', 'portrayal', 'spot-on', 'etc', 'However', 'movie', 'just', 'what', 'plotline', 'really', 'showcase', 'greater', 'message', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'intended', 'be', 'taken', 'dogmatically', 'device', 'make', 'point', 'relatively', 'good', 'salvation', 'scene', 'when', 'compared', 'several', 'other', 'Christian/faith-based', 'movies', 'are', 'loads', 'good', 'messages', 'movie.I', 'can', 'say', 'reservation', 'left', 'movie', 'feeling', 'hopeful', 'encouraged', 'spurred-on', 'towards', 'making', 'own', 'life', 'count', 'what', 'really', 'matters.The', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'was', 'relatively', 'decent', 'would', 'put', 'really', 'good', 'made-for-t.v', 'movie', 'category.All', 'things', 'considered', 'good', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watching', 'kids', 'brand-new-believers', 'might', 'want', 'address', 'theological', 'issues', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', '10-year-old', 'thinking', 'God', 'might', 'whisk', 'off', 'live', 'alternate', 'life', 'do', 'movie', 'can', 'set', 'stage', 'interesting', 'discussions', 'regarding', 'choices', 'God', 'will', 'lives', 'God', 'usually', 'pushy', 'movie', 'pushing', 'guy', 'back', 'where', 'be', 'opposed', 'gently', 'nudging', 'etc', 'Other', 'discussion', 'points', 'could', 'be', 'foolishness', 'waiting', 'last', 'minute', 'accept', 'Lord', 'occurs', 'character', 'movie', 'what', 'family', 'unit', 'ideally', 'look', 'importance', 'united', 'family', 'importance', 'going', 'forward', 'bright', 'future', 'regardless', 'past', 'unable', 'change', 'past', 'choices', 'can', 'have', 'new', 'beginning', 'go', 'forward', 'NOW', 'Jesus', 'much', 'more.Reviewed', 'MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",What If...

What was so wrong about his life in the first place?  That he valued material things that his fiance did?  He said he was happy in his life and it showed.  He wasn't having problems with his fiance, he wasn't having issues with being empty, with wanting kids he didn't have, it wasn't as if he hated his job, etc.  As you read this you might think that I materialistic - not even close.  What I am saying is that he is going along happy as can be then he is forced into a city he didn't intend on being in.  ***SPOILER ALERT - having his car break down and then being knocked out and taken into a family that was NOT his is ridiculous.  He repeatedly says he wants to leave and attempts to do so - but God continues to keep him in a prison until he totally surrenders.  So, the condition of his release is to surrender?  As a Christian I am appalled by a movie that thinks God is about imprisoning us until we relent.  We are the ones that build our own prisons - God does not force us to love him nor would he force us in this way.

I don't understand their low opinion of his work. I thought this movie had some good acting, especially Kristy Swanson and Kevin. John Ratzenberger always produces a character role with his special panache. I thought the story line was interesting, although one reviewer complained it was a copycat version of a movie called Family Man. Since I never saw that flick, this plot was new to me and I found it compelling. Others complained about the theology and argued that God doesn't work in this manner. Of course He doesn't give us a second chance to go back and sample the fork in the road that we spurned and choose the one we prefer. The point of the movie was not to teach how God moves with His people. The point was that if we are not careful and we make the wrong choice (most likely done with consulting God) when we come to a crossroads, we could regret it the rest of our lives. This man could have had riches, a status symbol trophy wife, and a prestigious career.  But if he had those things he couldn't have a life where he depended on God for finances, a lovely wife who truly loved and supported him, and a honorable career.

And choosing a movie is easy as ex-RAF fly boy and I share a liking for the old movies or 'Family' movies (I let him enjoy Scifi's all by himself). We tend to shy away from anything with expletives or violence as we prefer to be 'entertained' not offended or scared out of our wits!Included on our list for i.e., 'The Blind Side', a warm hearted story, perfect for family viewing and best of all, based on a true story! So far, I have seen it twice and I love it!Years ago our then teenager son begged to see a series called 'Hercules: The Incredible Journeys' and the name Kevin Sorbo was first spoken in our household.As a Christian this well known actor is nothing like his fellows Hollywood actors. A good model for today's youths, he will not disappoint concerned parents! His acting career proves he remains a great entertainer!Whilst visiting our daughter a few days ago and enjoying her large flat screen telly (!) I discovered one of Kevin Sorbo's latest movies called 'What If'' (see also description above) and I could not wait to show it to my husband (huh...on our 27"" old telly - no worries, it's at least a colour one!). The best part? Mum (yes me!) got to introduce her son to one of Kevin Sorbo's latest movies as we all sat down to watch it!This is a wonderful story of a successful man who is given a second chance when he finds the courage to face the decisions he made and the ones he could have made and finally follow God's path.I was struck by the emotional performance of the actors, their faith alive and strong for all of us to witness.It is a story which reaches out and grabs you! This is a movie about discovering what truly matters even if you are not a Christian!Unlike the Hollywood epic movies, it is not ascetic. 'Ben Walker' is a man who identifies what he could have had when he realizes the treasure of having a family who loves you no matter what!In a recent interview Kevin Sorbo said: 'A lot of the faith-based movies in the past have always been shot sort of cheesy, kinda soap opera in a way. This movie isn't like that at all. I don't look at it as a Christian movie per se. It's a movie about redemption. ... We all have what ifs in our life. ... This movie is sort of a guiding light to show people that no matter where you are, no matter how upset or disappointed or frustrated you are in your life, if you want to change, you can change your life'.In 'What If' you will enjoy a great performance, a story of redemption and even have a few chuckles for 'Ben Walker' as a preacher is unlike any I ever met, never mind the Angel who looks like a mechanic!I give it 5 stars!Note: An other movie (also starring Kevin Sorbo) added to our list: 'Soul Surfer'!As always Readers, remember that unless stated otherwise, this post reflects my opinion only!

That alternative route helped him to become a selfish, greedy, self-centered man.When Ben is shown what could have happened had he followed God's call, at first, he is taken by surprise, which lends many laughable moments. After all, this life he could have had is completely opposite than the life he leads. Instead of being a wealthy businessman, he is now a pastor, struggling to get by on a meager income. Instead of driving a fancy sportscar, Ben now drives a minivan. Instead of being engaged to an equally selfish woman, he is now married to a sweet and giving wife. Instead of having no children and only having to think of himself, Ben is now the father of two daughters.This movie is full of wonderful discussion questions, the main one being the importance of realizing that God has a calling and plan for each of our lives (Jeremiah 29:11).  We are here to bring glory to His name and to spread the word about the hope that is found in Jesus Christ.I would highly recommend this movie for all ages, although younger children may not completely understand the plot.

While the plots are similar, this movie is about ten times better than Family Man.Kevin Sorbo gives a stunning performance as a man, Ben Walker, that is re-looking his life.The angel, John Ratzenberger, is absolutely brilliant.  His character makes sense.  He acts as you would expect an angel to act.  He also brings some humor to the role.Kristy Swanson does an excellent job as Ben Walker's wife.  She plays a strong character that directs Ben back onto the proper path.  Kristy Swanson plays the wife that you want Ben Walker to get together with at the end of the story.There is real substance to this movie.  The characters are engaging.  The story is riveting.  I challenge anyone who has ever been in a serious relationship to get through this film without tearing up at several of the critical points.Also, I found myself rooting for Sorbo's character.  Yes, Ben Walker is definitely a self-centered jerk at the beginning of the film, but Sorbo breathes so much life into the role that you really want things to work out for him.  (Contrast that with Family Man where you would not really have minded if things did not work out for the Cage character.)Finally, there is some deeper meaning to this story.  Sorbo plays a man who has lost his faith and his way, and his way back involves refinding his faith.As a bonus, all this is done without violence or without the need to introduce racial stereotypes or foul language.I was extremely impressed with Kevin Sorbo, and I will look for his future performances.Nicely done!Watch this movie and buy copies for gifts.

Ben Walker and his fianc&eacute;e Wendy are planning their life together when Ben leaves on a trip for only a few months. A few months turns into 15 years and Ben has changed his entire life.

When an angel comes to Earth and shows Ben what is life could have been like if he stayed on his original plan Ben has a choice to make. Not to cause an argument here but to me most of the faith based movies that come out are very cheesy and unbelievable. Movies like ""5th Quarter"", ""Courage"" and even ""The Blind Side"" to me are not that good mainly because there seems to be no real substance. Those movies are...if this doesn't happen then this can't...next scene everything works out perfect. Like in ""Blind Side"" when the family is told that if Michael doesn't pass this next test he will not be able to play, and then the very next scene is him saying I passed the test. This movie is the exception. While it does have it's cheesiness and is predictable it has something the other movies didn't...a real character facing real decisions. The only way to describe this movie is that it's very much like ""It's a wonderful life"" but with more God. To see Kevin Sorbo in a movie like this is strange at first but he does a great job.
