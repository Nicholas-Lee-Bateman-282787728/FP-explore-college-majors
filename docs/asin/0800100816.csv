160176,AGEIT17HENDIS,0800100816,Alfred Johnson,"[3, 4]","THIS REVIEW IS BEING USED FOR BOTH THE SEAN PENN AND BRODERICK CRAWFORD VERSIONS OF ALL THE KING'S MEN.I have seen both film versions of Robert Penn Warren's classic tale of the rise and fall of a `populist' corrupted politician, Willie Stark, based at least loosely on the political career of 1930's Louisiana Governor Huey Long. America has had no shortage of such politicians who have allegedly championed the cause of the `little people' in their rise to power while on the side lining their pockets and the pockets of their friends. The late Governor of Alabama George  Wallace comes to mind as a more modern example but there have been others, some who did not bother to champion the cause of `little people' or anyone else, for that matter.The question before us, however, is who is the real Willie Stark. Since the story line is fairly simple and familiar from a glance at today's newspapers or a look at the political landscape it is the believability of the performances in the films that counts here. Broderick Crawford played in the original black and white film version and won an Academy Award for his performance by acting as a initially nave country bumpkin with a thirst for power to do `good' who is corrupted by power as he goes about the business of governance. Seemingly, all his baser instincts come into play and there is an almost fatalistic sense that he is in for a big fall. Sean Penn in the more recent version seems to be more world weary about the political process and cynical about what he can do for the `people' and himself when in power. Of the two, Crawford just seems to be more comfortable in his interpretation of the role. Moreover, in the recent version the narrator's story, that of a troubled alcoholic former news reporter hired by Stark as his smooth-tongued flak, takes top-billing and that diminishes Stark's role in all the shenanigans. For my money, although Penn's performance may appeal to today's more politician-averse audience Crawford wins this duel.

It depicts the rise and fall of a Huey Long-like character, from his idealized beginning to his slow descent into corruption, alcoholism, blackmail and greed.  Broderick Crawford gives the performance of a lifetime as Willie Stark, his  powerful screen presence makes us at first admire his character, then we  slowly start feeling bad for him, but at the same time scares and  ultimately we get to pity this man that was corrupted by the system.  Assured direction by Robert Rossen and a superb script keep the film moving  at a steady pace.

160182,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,0800100816,calvinnme,"[3, 3]","This movie, although almost sixty years old now, is still interesting today mainly because human nature and thus the fundamentals of American politics haven't changed. What has changed is the average American's cynicism towards the political process, thus rendering this film possibly more interesting today than it was when it was first made. As others have mentioned, this film is based on a novel that was based on the life of Huey P. Long, governor of and then senator from Louisiana. The politician in this film is Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford), who starts out running for local office, but comes up against a corrupt local political machine that quickly shuts him down, even having his wife fired from her teaching job of many years. A few years later the same corrupt political machine is looking at their polling data and realizing that their candidate for governor will lose unless they can split the populist vote. They enlist Stark to run for office as governor, and his flattered pride doesn't allow him to see what their true motives are. Stark gives a few uninspired speeches until Sadie Burke (Mercedes McCambridge) explains to him what is really going on - that he is a patsy in a larger scheme. From that point forward he is a man transformed. He gives fiery speeches that rile up the people and almost actually wins the race. However, four years later he returns and does win. In order to do so, he has to ""make some deals"" with some moneyed interests. He starts out using power to help the common people of the state, but in the end he is helping the common people of the state just because he wants power, making sure that everything accomplished by his administration comes complete with a large landmark bearing his name to assure his legacy. His misdeeds in office - both professional and personal - escalate until they become even too large for him to cover up, leading to his ultimate downfall.The one character I found somewhat hard to understand was that of Jack Burden (John Ireland). He starts out covering Stark's story because he is assigned to do so by the newspaper for which he is working. He has such high ideals that he even quits the paper when his boss tells him that the state political machine no longer wants Stark's race covered. However, long after it is obvious what Stark has turned into, even after he knows that Stark has rewarded his friendship and loyalty by taking the girl he loves, Burden remains by his side. It takes Stark indirectly causing the death of Burden's long time mentor before he finally walks away.There have been plenty of movies made about how power corrupts otherwise good men, but in this film there is more than a hint that Stark was never actually a good man. He was just a man who wasn't in a position to be corrupt until power gave him an opportunity to do so. In the sixty years since this film was made we've seen offenses committed by Presidents of both parties that leave the average man wondering ""What WERE they thinking?"". However, in order to reach the top of the political heap, you probably need to possess a tendency for risk taking along with a great deal of self-confidence, just as Stark had, and these traits can be your enemies as well as your friends.There are virtually no special features on this DVD other than promotional pieces on Steven Zaillian's 2006 remake, which turned out to be far inferior to this 1949 classic.",4,"Power doesn't just corrupt, it enables corruption",1177718400,"04 28, 2007",2007,3419,"['movie', 'almost', 'sixty', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'still', 'interesting', 'today', 'mainly', 'human', 'nature', 'thus', 'fundamentals', 'American', 'politics', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'What', 'changed', 'average', 'American', 'cynicism', 'political', 'process', 'thus', 'rendering', 'film', 'possibly', 'more', 'interesting', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'made', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'life', 'Huey', 'P.', 'Long', 'governor', 'then', 'senator', 'Louisiana', 'politician', 'film', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'who', 'out', 'running', 'local', 'office', 'up', 'corrupt', 'local', 'political', 'machine', 'quickly', 'down', 'even', 'having', 'wife', 'fired', 'teaching', 'job', 'many', 'years', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'same', 'corrupt', 'political', 'machine', 'looking', 'polling', 'data', 'realizing', 'candidate', 'governor', 'will', 'lose', 'can', 'split', 'populist', 'vote', 'enlist', 'Stark', 'run', 'office', 'governor', 'flattered', 'pride', ""n't"", 'allow', 'see', 'what', 'true', 'motives', 'are', 'Stark', 'few', 'uninspired', 'speeches', 'Sadie', 'Burke', 'Mercedes', 'McCambridge', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'patsy', 'larger', 'scheme', 'point', 'forward', 'man', 'transformed', 'fiery', 'speeches', 'rile', 'up', 'people', 'almost', 'actually', 'race', 'However', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'win', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'make', 'deals', 'moneyed', 'interests', 'out', 'using', 'power', 'help', 'common', 'people', 'state', 'end', 'helping', 'common', 'people', 'state', 'just', 'power', 'making', 'sure', 'everything', 'accomplished', 'administration', 'complete', 'large', 'landmark', 'bearing', 'name', 'assure', 'legacy', 'misdeeds', 'office', 'professional', 'personal', 'escalate', 'become', 'even', 'too', 'large', 'cover', 'up', 'leading', 'ultimate', 'downfall.The', 'one', 'character', 'found', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'understand', 'was', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'John', 'Ireland', 'out', 'covering', 'Stark', 'story', 'assigned', 'do', 'so', 'newspaper', 'working', 'such', 'high', 'ideals', 'even', 'paper', 'when', 'boss', 'state', 'political', 'machine', 'no', 'longer', 'Stark', 'race', 'covered', 'However', 'long', 'obvious', 'what', 'Stark', 'turned', 'even', 'Stark', 'rewarded', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'taking', 'girl', 'Burden', 'side', 'Stark', 'indirectly', 'causing', 'death', 'Burden', 'long', 'time', 'mentor', 'finally', 'away.There', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'movies', 'made', 'how', 'power', 'corrupts', 'otherwise', 'good', 'men', 'film', 'more', 'hint', 'Stark', 'was', 'never', 'actually', 'good', 'man', 'was', 'just', 'man', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'position', 'be', 'corrupt', 'power', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'sixty', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'made', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'offenses', 'committed', 'Presidents', 'parties', 'leave', 'average', 'man', 'wondering', 'What', 'WERE', 'thinking', 'However', 'order', 'reach', 'top', 'political', 'heap', 'probably', 'need', 'possess', 'tendency', 'risk', 'taking', 'along', 'great', 'deal', 'self-confidence', 'just', 'Stark', 'had', 'traits', 'can', 'be', 'enemies', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'virtually', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'other', 'promotional', 'pieces', 'Steven', 'Zaillian', '2006', 'remake', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'inferior', '1949', 'classic']",N/A

The flick based on the life of controversial Louisiana governor Huey Long, rightly catapaulted Crawford, and supporting actress Mercedes McCambridge to Oscars, as well as best picture in the 1950 Academy Awards.Stark was a country bumpkin from a rural county seat.  He arose from a hardscrabble existence to eventually earn a law degree.  His clear and honest opinions delivered during a local election were a refreshing change from the diatribe regurgitated by the local party machinery.  His message resonated loudly with the common folk that he called ""hicks"".John Ireland, himself nominated for a supporting actor Oscar, played Jack Burden, a reporter for a rather large local daily newspaper assigned to cover the Stark phenomenon.  Stark and Burden connected but the good press Crawford received was not enough to carry the election.  Not discouraged Stark was soon after nominated to run for governor in an attempt to use him as a pawn to split the vote, assuring the re-election of the incumbent.  Although he again lost, he gained valuable political savvy and electioneering experience.Four years hence, Stark hit the ground running and with Burden as his press secretary, he again tried the gubernatorial election.  This time, he brokered deals with influential people in the state.  Crawford used Ireland, who came from a privileged background to gain support from the upper gentry of Ireland's wealthy home town, Burden's Landing.  Crawford gained favor with Ireland's girlfriend Anne Stanton played by the attractive Joanne Dru and her powerful family.  This time Crawford managed to gain the governor's mansion.Very soon however, Crawford who started with the best of intentions was seduced by power, greed and corruption.  He became a paranoid demagogue who eventually destroyed all those around him as well as his principles and ideals.  He used his son Tom played by a young and handsome John Derek, a local college football hero to enhance his own image, ultimately decimating him.Crawford would pay for his sins as the cries for his impeachment swirled around him.Director Rossen presented a concise and revealing account of the rise and fall of one of the more powerful political figures in this country.  His inevitable fall from grace serves as a lesson to point out how misplaced power is able to corrupt even the most honest individuals.  The acting was obviously superb by all members of the cast.",5,Excellent Huey Long biopic,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,2547,"['Broderick', 'Crawford', 'was', 'inspired', 'playing', 'backwoods', 'Southern', 'politician', 'Willie', 'Stark', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'King', 'Men', 'flick', 'based', 'life', 'controversial', 'Louisiana', 'governor', 'Huey', 'Long', 'rightly', 'catapaulted', 'Crawford', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Mercedes', 'McCambridge', 'Oscars', 'as', 'well', 'best', 'picture', '1950', 'Academy', 'Awards.Stark', 'was', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'rural', 'county', 'seat', 'arose', 'hardscrabble', 'existence', 'eventually', 'earn', 'law', 'degree', 'clear', 'honest', 'opinions', 'delivered', 'local', 'election', 'were', 'refreshing', 'change', 'diatribe', 'regurgitated', 'local', 'party', 'machinery', 'message', 'resonated', 'loudly', 'common', 'folk', 'called', 'hicks', '.John', 'Ireland', 'nominated', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'played', 'Jack', 'Burden', 'reporter', 'rather', 'large', 'local', 'daily', 'newspaper', 'assigned', 'cover', 'Stark', 'phenomenon', 'Stark', 'Burden', 'connected', 'good', 'press', 'Crawford', 'received', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'carry', 'election', 'Not', 'discouraged', 'Stark', 'was', 'soon', 'nominated', 'run', 'governor', 'attempt', 'use', 'pawn', 'split', 'vote', 'assuring', 're-election', 'incumbent', 'again', 'lost', 'gained', 'valuable', 'political', 'savvy', 'electioneering', 'experience.Four', 'years', 'hence', 'Stark', 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'Burden', 'press', 'secretary', 'again', 'tried', 'gubernatorial', 'election', 'time', 'brokered', 'deals', 'influential', 'people', 'state', 'Crawford', 'used', 'Ireland', 'who', 'came', 'privileged', 'background', 'gain', 'support', 'upper', 'gentry', 'Ireland', 'wealthy', 'home', 'town', 'Burden', 'Landing', 'Crawford', 'gained', 'favor', 'Ireland', 'girlfriend', 'Anne', 'Stanton', 'played', 'attractive', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'powerful', 'family', 'time', 'Crawford', 'managed', 'gain', 'governor', 'mansion.Very', 'soon', 'however', 'Crawford', 'who', 'started', 'best', 'intentions', 'was', 'seduced', 'power', 'greed', 'corruption', 'became', 'paranoid', 'demagogue', 'who', 'eventually', 'destroyed', 'around', 'as', 'well', 'principles', 'ideals', 'used', 'son', 'Tom', 'played', 'young', 'handsome', 'John', 'Derek', 'local', 'college', 'football', 'hero', 'enhance', 'own', 'image', 'ultimately', 'decimating', 'him.Crawford', 'would', 'pay', 'sins', 'cries', 'impeachment', 'swirled', 'around', 'him.Director', 'Rossen', 'presented', 'concise', 'revealing', 'account', 'rise', 'fall', 'one', 'more', 'powerful', 'political', 'figures', 'country', 'inevitable', 'fall', 'grace', 'serves', 'lesson', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'misplaced', 'power', 'able', 'corrupt', 'even', 'most', 'honest', 'individuals', 'acting', 'was', 'obviously', 'superb', 'members', 'cast']",N/A

160185,A2TL9FBMOC7AVK,0800100816,Curtis Crawford,"[0, 1]","All the King's Men(This review discusses important events in the movie.  It should not be read by anyone who wants to experience this film, knowing nothing in advance about what will happen. CC.)The title, ""All The King's Men,"" comes from the nursery rhyme, ""Humpty Dumpty.""""Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.All the king's horses and all the king's menCouldn't put Humpty together again.""The identity of the original Humpty is unknown, but the rhyme beautifully fits the film.  The ""king,"" Willie Stark, has a tremendous fall, both in character and fortune. His men can't put him together again, morally or physically.  Indeed, other characters, both friends and foes, also fall.  The movie is high tragedy, in both the gravity and the depth of the falls.In ordinary life, the word, tragedy, commonly means an event, like an auto accident, evoking pity and fear.  In fiction, it means a particular kind of plot.  In tragic stories, characters fall from happiness to misery, thanks to a fatal collaboration between their flaws and the course of events.  The audience feels pity, from the loss of good; and fear, from the triumph of bad.Many people avoid tragic stories, because of the conflicting emotions they produce: love of the characters' goodness vs. fear and hatred of their evil.  But this mixture of good and bad makes tragedies more realistic and moving, since we who watch are such mixtures ourselves.As several Amazon reviewers have noted, the action in ""Willie Stark"" strikingly illustrates the famous maxim: ""Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.""  At the beginning, there was much good in Willie, and little apparent evil.  By the end, this ratio is reversed.  Why is the initial good so easily corrupted?  Where did the evil, which dominates the middle and end of the story, come from?In the first scenes, Willie shows many desirable qualities: exceptional intelligence, courage, perseverance, honesty, sympathy for the powerless.  Moreover, he is accurate, alert, articulate; careful, considerate, concise, courteous, creative; decisive, determined, diligent, direct, discerning, discreet, dispassionate; effective, empathic, energetic, enterprising, expressive; fair, farsighted, firm, frank; generous, gentle, great-hearted.  (And this sentence includes only virtues whose names begin with the letters, A - G.)By the end of the movie, he has often been abrupt, adulterous, aggressive, amoral, antagonistic, anxious, argumentative, arrogant, avaricious;  belligerent, biased, bitter, bloodthirsty, boastful, brusque, brutal; callous, casuistical, cavalier, censorious, coarse, cocksure, combative, contemptuous, covetous, crafty, cruel, cunning; deceitful, designing, destructive, devious, dictatorial, disruptive, dissipated, dogmatic, dominating; envious, exhibitionistic; fanatical, fatuous, fickle, foolish, fretful, furtive; grandiose, greedy, grim, grouchy.In the first third of the screenplay, Willie's attractive qualities dominate.  In the last two-thirds, his unattractive qualities dominate.  It's as if, during the interval between his unsuccessful, first race for governor, and his successful, second race, he has ""sold his soul"" to power, whatever the moral cost.  Such a ""pact with the devil,"" or with the ""forces of evil,"" is a frequent theme in tragic drama.On Google, perhaps the most quoted line from the film is Willie's belief that ""man is conceived in sin and born in corruption.""  He uses this idea to justify his own evil conduct, claiming that his opponents would be, or have been, just as evil for selfish ends, whereas the evil he does is for the public good.  The quoted line is quite similar to Verse 5 of Psalm 51 in the Old Testament.  It reads, in the King James Version (the one Willie would have grown up on), ""Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.""  But how differently Willie and the psalmist respond to the same idea!  Willie asserts it, to justify doing evil. The psalmist asserts it, as requiring forgiveness and renewal.  In Verse 10, he writes: ""Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.""All the main characters in the film are defined largely by their response to the substantial presence of evil in human nature.  Two of them respond in part by deliberately taking a human life.  The elderly, aristocratic Judge Stanton, after resigning as attorney general in Willie's administration, becomes a powerful supporter of Willie's impeachment.  Willie obtains proof of ancient, grievous misconduct by the Judge, but offers not to expose it, if the Judge will stop supporting the impeachment.  The judge rejects the offer, ends the meeting, and kills himself (off camera) minutes later.  Does he act from shame? family pride? bitterness?  executing justice on himself?  falling nobly on his sword?  We don't know.  Instead of suicide, I wish he had acknowledged his misconduct to God and the world, praying with the psalmist for a clean heart and a right spirit.  No one is good enough or bad enough to dispense with this prayer.The Judge's nephew, Dr. Adam Stanton, though very uneasy about Willie's tactics, had agreed to direct the huge, free, public hospital that Willie plans to build.  But Adam now knows that Willie threatened to expose his uncle, and that his sister, Anne, helped Willie obtain the accusatory information.  He also learns, just before he acts, that the Senate has rejected the impeachment.  Willie appears, to greet a cheering crowd.  Adam kills Willie, knowing that he, himself, will be instantly killed by bodyguards.  Why does Adam kill?  The question is important.  Whether this act was just or unjust depends largely on the motive.  Was it in order to succeed where the impeachment had failed: ending the usurpation of a free, democratic state government by a dictator?  To revenge the threat that led to his uncle's suicide?  To protect his sister from an evil predator?  All three?  The movie doesn't show.  There was no homicide letter.  I hope Adam's motivation was primarily the first of these, and that it included something like the psalmist's prayer.",5,"Powerful, Dismaying, Heartrending, High Tragedy",1237248000,"03 17,

The book was so evocative of Louisiana. The state was practically another character. Warren did a great job of the interconnectedness of the people and their traditions. Also in the book there was a part set during the civil war that was wonderful. I understand why they couldn't put that part in the movie but the movie felt like it could have been Anywhere small town US in the 30's rather than LA. Also the acting seemed overly dramatic and dated to me.

160188,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,0800100816,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 1]","I have never read Robert Penn Warren's original novel, and if I ever did, I would probably have mixed feelings about this 1949 film adaptation. Some say that it misses the spark that made the novel so engaging. Well, even though I haven't read it, I still find the film to be an instant masterpiece. Loosely based on real-life Louisiana Governor Huey Long, Willie Stark rises to power in order to conquer corrupt politicians. Unfortunately, he slowly starts to become one of those whom he tried to prevent. Jack Burden (columnist and, later, Stark's right-hand man), Anne Stanton (Jack's lover), and Sadie Burke (Stark's assistant) are the driving forces of the story as they mainly become the POV's in the entire film. This is a very solid 40's film about power, corrupt politics, and people's misperceptions of true politics. It has a splendid ensemble of actors: the performers ""become"" the characters almost perfectly. It is well-directed: Robert Rossen has obviously put a lot of effort into this film. It is also well-written: again, I haven't read the original novel, but I can already tell that the overall script is crisp and intriguing. But I think the thing that stands out the most is the acting by Broderick Crawford. He is absolutely spot-on as Willie Stark. I swear he has the perfect look, the perfect voice, and the perfect personality for the character. It's almost tragic that Crawford is no longer well-known, especially in the new millennium, but we still have this to remember him by.Now, there are two problems I have with this movie (not very big ones, but still noticeable). The first is the uneven pacing. The second half of the film is slower than the first half, which makes for unbalanced storytelling. The other problem I have is the narrative. The voiceovers done by John Ireland are distracting and do not seem like a great way to tell the actual story. Still, the film finds its own way of showing how corrupt politicians can be. Now mind you, this is NOT like Citizen Kane, which is rightfully considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. But All The King's Men is different in many ways, such as the politics and the motives of the main character. And while Citizen Kane is more masterfully directed and more cinematically influential, it's not one of my personal favorites (and I'll explain why in my written review of the film later on). All The King's Men is on the list of my favorite films of all time, and while it is far from perfect (it does look pretty dated), it is a well-told tale of political corruption. I love it for its cleverly written script, its well-developed characters, and of course, Broderick Crawford's stunning performance (he deserved the Oscar win). As of now, I haven't seen the 2005 remake. I've heard of all the negative reviews, but maybe I'll give it a shot. I'll probably rent it when I have the time. But for now, the original still stands as an underrated film classic. Buying this on DVD instead of renting it was the right choice for me.Grade: A-",5,"""I'm going to stay in this race!

Taylor ""GFT""","[45, 48]","There are certain subjects that films in general and Hollywood in particular never handled very well--and chief among them are politics.  But even some fifty years after it first hit theatre screens, ALL THE KING'S MEN still has plenty of power.  Filmed in a ""noir"" style and based on the famous novel which was in turn based loosely on the rise and fall of Louisiana's Huey P. Long, the film offers the story of Willie Stark, a small-town lawyer who is nominated for govenor by a political party seeking to defeat their opponet by dividing the rural vote.  When Willie gets wise to the plot he turns on his  false benefactors and rockets to political power--but once in power the honest small-town-joe becomes even more corrupt than those who sought to manipulate him for their own gain.Broderick Crawford justly earned an Oscar for his performance as Willie Stark, whose ego and thirst for power grows to horrific proportions--and whose corruption gradually taints even the most honorable people around him.  The supporting cast of John Ireland, Joanne Dru, Anne Seymour, and Walter Burke (to name but a few) is also quite good.  But the real knockout here is actress Mercedes McCambridge as Willie Stark's hard-edged assistant and sometimes lover; it is an astonishing performance which, in spite of its supporting status, remains locked in mind long after the film ends, a role for which McCambridge won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress.The script doesn't really do full justice to Warren's novel, the film is a bit slow to start, and the story itself feels a bit dry in the telling--but the performances and numerous memorable scenes carry it through to tremendous effect. ALL THE KING'S MEN is so explicit in its portrait of how corrupt politicians manipulate the public that it should be required viewing for every one of voting age.

The acting is highly variable, with some very unmemorable performances in underwritten roles but also with some excellent work from Broderick Crawford as the megalomanical central character Willie Stark and Mercedes McCambridge as the hardbitten Sadie (both of whom won Oscars), and from Anne Seymour as Willie's idealistic wife who learns to compromise her values as Willie's star rises.

The book, written in 1946 by Robert Penn Warren won a Pulitzer Prize. I loved the book. I can't say as much for the video.Robert Rossen, who wrote and directed the screenplay, tried hard. But not only did he change the story to fit the confines of the screen, he kept it plot driven, thereby losing the complexity that gave the book its power. Without the beauty of the words and the layers of meaning in the story, it became the simple story of a politician's rise to power and his eventual downfall. The book was dense with meaning; the film a mere shadow. And in spite of fine acting by Broderick Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge as Stark's political aide, I found myself soon becoming bored. I was surprised that John Ireland, cast in the role of Jack Burden, the narrator and most complex of all the characters, was also nominated for an academy award. I found his acting wooden and at times I almost laughed out loud at his amateurish performance.However, even though the story was boiled down to a mere shadow of the book's plot, it still made its points about the realities of politics and the compromises that have to be made along the way.

Based on the life of Huey Long, it chronicles the rise to power of an obscure but ambitious backwoods Louisiana lawyer, Willie Stark, who initially seems to stand for honesty and reform in contrast to the entrenched and corrupt political machine he is fighting, which is determined to defeat him at all costs, rightly perceiving an honest man as a threat to everything they stand for.Stark triumphs, however, and we watch as he himself takes on the trappings of official power, which he takes to like a duck to water. Stark builds new schools and colleges, hospitals for the poor, improves the roads, and seems to be everything the common man could hope for in a champion and leader. But there is a darker side to Stark, as he himself ultimately becomes assimilated by the corrupt machine he sought to topple and reform, and evidence surfaces that he has not only tolerated and even fostered corruption himself but was possibly involved in the murder of an innocent man who dared to challenge his authority. In the end, we see Stark using the same means and ends to further his power and to hold it at all costs that his enemies used against him at the very beginning of his career.The movie raises the question as to whether Stark was really any different from the corrupt cronies he replaced, and the schools and hospitals he built just monuments to his ego and arrogance, or whether he was a good man who ultimately went bad in his quest and thirst for power. The question is left open for the viewer to decide, as Stark's career comes to a sudden and tragic end during a campaign where he's fighting for his political survival after he's finally implicated in the murder of the innocent man.Broderick Crawford, John Ireland, and Mercedes McCambridge are really superb in their roles, and the movie is shot in dark, film noir style, which helps create an appropriately dark, conspiratorial mood and ambience.

Pity that in the intervening decades he's all but been forgotten. Crawford is Willie Stark - an honest man butting heads in the political arena until he finally gets his chance to rule when he sweeps the every man's election.  Too bad for Willie that the power goes to his head.  John Ireland costars as the reporter who wants so desperately to believe in Willie that he's willing to overlook the slow spiral out of control.

John Derek is cast as Willie's son - the tragic victim of his father's scaling to great heights.TRANSFER: Somewhat of a disappointment. Though the gray scale is reasonably well balanced though at times the contrast levels seem to be a shade too low. A lot of wear and tear has gone into this film's original camera negative.

It is a little abrupt in its transitions and glosses over the honest man becoming a demogogue to a great extent but it is still a brave and true film in having the guts to portray a system that leaves no character unmuddied.  There are no heroes in this movie.  It is not just about power corrupting but also about how appealing power can be to people in its vicinity. It turns strong men into toadies and women into, well let's just say it's in the Bible and Babylon had one. The script and direction by Robert Rossen are both very effective.  There are also good performances by most of the actors, particulary Broderick Crawford.  The stand out, though, is the stunning portrait by Mercedes McCambridge who allows the standard character of the fast talkin' dame to seeth with anger under her sharp tongue.  There is more pain and defiance when she looks in a mirror that the other actors manage throughout the entire movie.  A film that is still true and still powerful.

160212,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0800100816,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","All the Kings Men(Released Nov/49)was Broderick Crawford's shining moment as he took the best actor award away that year for his role as Willie Stark.His co-star Mercedes McCambridge as Sadie also snatched the best supporting actress node.Out of the remaining five nominations it took another OSCAR and that was for overall best motion picture.It is still easy to see why as the film still packs a powerful punch.The story is loosely based on Louisiana Governor Huey Long's rise to power and it is a look at how absolute power corrupts absolutely.The story begins,as does the main characters',in humble backgrounds.A rural boy comes to the city(Willie Stark)in order to fight those that would subvert the political system for their own crooked gains.Naive about the ""game"" he is playing he is cajoled and bullied by his opponents.His seemingly honest attempts to do something for the people and their plight gets the attention of the state capitols newspaper which sends a man to check it out,one Jack Burden(John Ireland).Stark loses round one but the more he gets his hands dirty in the political arena the tougher he gets.He goes on a bender after hearing that the very people who have been financing and steering his campaign are just using him to split votes in order for their real choice to get in.At a rally the next day a hungover but new born Stark throws away his wooden speeches and comes out swinging.From this moment on all bets are off and Stark,although losing the election,doesn't let the grass grow under his feet.He goes to college and gets a BA in law and opens up his own practice as a lawyer.When the re-elections come around again he is more than ready to start the fight all over again;this time with a new fire.Stark's rural ideas become a thing of the past and his disguised feelings for the little guy or ""hicks"" become just a cover for his real personal ambitions.His methodology has become the same or worse than the very people he first campaigned against from the beginning.The newspaper man who first covered Stark is now on his payroll,as are many of the very people who tried to squelch Stark from the beginning.He says he keeps them around to remind himself of what he had to overcome,but it is by all appearances something else;to use those same and very corrupt hands to do his dirty work.Along for the ride is rough and tough Sadie who falls in love with Stark as does Jack Burden's own girlfriend,all the while using his own wife and adopted son as pawns for political gain(nothing ever changes)whenever the occasion calls for it.Stark by now has given a plum job to a prominent judge as Attorney General and a plum position for a doctor as head of the new Stark Hospital,both close friends of Burdens.Time however reveals the ugly truth behind Starks motives not only to these men but to all of Starks staff.When the judge backs a motion at the state capitol for now-Governor Stark's impeachment Stark confronts him with evidence of a wrong doing many years before that he had forgotten about.Stark wants the judge to call off the vote then and there but the judge tells Stark he will get his answer in the morrow.While Stark and Burden are outside of the room talking and about to leave a shot rings out and they find the judge has committed suicide.Problem solved for Stark.Things go from bad to worse however as the impeachment hearings at the state capitol resume.Stark has called on his henchmen to get the ""hicks"" out in support and they do.The plaza around the capitol building is jammed with humanity.The vote comes in and Stark,as would be expected,comes out in triumph and makes a speech.However out from the shadows of the capitol steps comes the distraught doctor who guns down Stark,who in turn is gunned down by police.Stark has flown too close to the sun and his wings of wax have melted sending him plummeting to earth and his inevitable death.Crawford's performance is mesmerizing throughout.Mind you with this Pulitzer prize winning book and resultant script,how could he have missed? McCambridge gives a very memorable performance as the tough as nails Sadie,with a yearning for the grace and beauty of other women that she will never have.The entire cast is solid in fact and watch for performances by by Paul Ford as the Senator that instigates the impeachment process;you may recall him better as Sgt Bilko's Colonel Hall.Also watch for Bert Hanlon as the newspaper editor,he is the self same actor who appeared as the plastic surgeon in Bogies film Dark Passage.Technically speaking this print has quite a few surface flaws,dirt specks,scratches,etc..It could use a good cleaning(even though it says it has been remastered in Hi-Def!),but overall the picture is quite crisp.It is full frame a/r(as it should be) and the only extras are two trailers for the tepid 2006 remake,which is very odd indeed.All in all a very good film that deserved every award it got in /49.It is a must have.Recommended.",4,Powerful as Ever!,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,4961,"['Kings',
