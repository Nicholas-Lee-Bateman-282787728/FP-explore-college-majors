I tried giving it away but no one wanted it. I am not exaggerating. I laughed whole heartedly when American Pie came out, I still laugh at South Park, Family Guy & Robot Chicken. All I did during this movie was roll my eyes & apologize numerously to my husband for wasting the $3 spent & the 90 minutes gone from our lives forever. I don't normally bash any movie this hard but trust me when I say, I'm trying to do u, the reader, a favor. Once ur precious time is lost, it's gone forever.

But-- I think they were either immature, or maybe drinking. It is not terrible by any means. But the script is uniquely surreal. I have never seen a weirder high school film. The girls are great, although they are about 25 [still in high school], but the script is all over the place.

1227240,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B001PKHS2W,S. Der,"[0, 0]","Basically, this is one of those B rated movie with no real plot and a whole lot of nudity. Every scene has either sex, nude girl, or half nude guy. The movies tried to give the viewer a story by making the movie about the main female lead, Gwen. Gwen is basically, trying to finish up her senior year in H.S., and that's what the movie is about, but you won't understand that unless, you see almost the whole movie.A little more about the movie. Gwen is already married to a guy and they are supposed to be in love. You have another girl trying to steal away the husband, so that she can break up the marriage. She is also Gwen's rival for everything. Gwen family isn't support of her, and in fact, they don't even like her. Also, the whole school doesn't like Gwen. There are two guys that are the clowns of the movie. They are always talking about nothing and making dumb stupid H.S. jokes. You have many staff and teachers characters trying to have sex with students throughout . The worse character is Gwen's own father trolling the school for H.S. girls. Gwen's father was some big porno star back in the day, and he also a muscle head. The female students are somehow really into that.If you love seeing hot/nude girls with almost no story, then this is the movie for you! I found the lead female actress very attractive, while the story makes fun of her all the way. I really into girl's wearing dark make up, so that's maybe why. lol I give this movie a 2 stars for the hot leading lady.",2,The plot is difficult to understand,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,1495,"['Basically', 'one', 'B', 'rated', 'movie', 'real', 'plot', 'whole', 'lot', 'nudity', 'scene', 'sex', 'nude', 'girl', 'half', 'nude', 'guy', 'movies', 'tried', 'give', 'viewer', 'story', 'making', 'movie', 'main', 'female', 'lead', 'Gwen', 'Gwen', 'basically', 'trying', 'finish', 'up', 'senior', 'year', 'H.S.', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'see', 'almost', 'whole', 'movie.A', 'little', 'more', 'movie', 'Gwen', 'already', 'married', 'guy', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'have', 'girl', 'trying', 'steal', 'away', 'husband', 'can', 'break', 'up', 'marriage', 'also', 'Gwen', 'rival', 'everything', 'Gwen', 'family', ""n't"", 'support', 'her', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'Also', 'whole', 'school', ""n't"", 'like', 'Gwen', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'clowns', 'movie', 'are', 'always', 'talking', 'nothing', 'making', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'H.S', 'jokes', 'have', 'many', 'staff', 'teachers', 'characters', 'trying', 'have', 'sex', 'students', 'worse', 'character', 'Gwen', 'own', 'father', 'trolling', 'school', 'H.S', 'girls', 'Gwen', 'father', 'was', 'big', 'porno', 'star', 'back', 'day', 'also', 'muscle', 'head', 'female', 'students', 'are', 'somehow', 'really', 'that.If', 'love', 'seeing', 'hot/nude', 'girls', 'almost', 'story', 'then', 'movie', 'found', 'lead', 'female', 'actress', 'very', 'attractive', 'story', 'fun', 'way', 'really', 'girl', 'wearing', 'dark', 'make', 'up', 'maybe', 'why', 'lol', 'give', 'movie', '2', 'stars', 'hot', 'leading', 'lady']",American High School

I believe one of the actors summed it up best in the deleted scenes commentary: ...""buy the American High School DVD - oh you already did suckers...""This is a story of a SOCal high school filled with people aged 25 or older, a perverted administrative staff, including a sexist principal, a nude art teacher, a school nurse that tries to have sex with the students, and so on. Nicki Ziering gets plenty of boob time on screen, Aubrey O Day (another Playboy alum) tries to fill some lines out, and all of the guys walk around without shirts so the gals can have something to watch.Haven't described the plot because there isn't one, but sufficed to say this film covers the last few months of a graduating class learning about life. But the way this group was written they could never have learned anything (even the lines). The deleted scenes total 20 minutes and have a built-in commentary from about six people having way too much fun laughing at themselves.I can laugh at and love to watch corny high school/college films, but this didn't make the recommendation list. As the director said in commentary ""get the pause button ready"" when Ziering would be getting naked, obviously the reason they made the whole film.",1,I had to give it a try,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,1286,"['One', 'can', 'always', 'hope', 'expectations', 'can', 'be', 'shattered', 'so', 'quickly', 'believe', 'one', 'actors', 'summed', 'up', 'best', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'buy', 'American', 'High', 'School', 'DVD', 'oh', 'already', 'did', 'suckers', 'story', 'SOCal', 'high', 'school', 'filled', 'people', 'aged', '25', 'older', 'perverted', 'administrative', 'staff', 'including', 'sexist', 'principal', 'nude', 'art', 'teacher', 'school', 'nurse', 'have', 'sex', 'students', 'so', 'Nicki', 'Ziering', 'plenty', 'boob', 'time', 'screen', 'Aubrey', 'O', 'Day', 'Playboy', 'alum', 'fill', 'lines', 'out', 'guys', 'walk', 'shirts', 'gals', 'can', 'have', 'something', 'watch.Have', ""n't"", 'described', 'plot', ""n't"", 'one', 'sufficed', 'say', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'graduating', 'class', 'learning', 'life', 'way', 'group', 'was', 'written', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'learned', 'anything', 'even', 'lines', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'total', '20', 'minutes', 'have', 'built-in', 'commentary', 'six', 'people', 'having', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'laughing', 'themselves.I', 'can', 'laugh', 'love', 'watch', 'corny', 'high', 'school/college', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'recommendation', 'list', 'director', 'said', 'commentary', 'get', 'pause', 'button', 'ready', 'when', 'Ziering', 'would', 'be', 'getting', 'naked', 'obviously', 'reason', 'made', 'whole', 'film']",American High School
