Here's a court case and an immediate resolution. When does that ever happen?The nation was starving for something outside the box and outside the typical routine T.V. shows that overwhelm our video box every night, and not to my surprise... THE UNIT actually locked in a solid rating. Was the state of the world we're in the reason for the people who tuned in? Was it the fact that Dennis Haysbert who was a lot of people's favorite character from the smash FOX hit, 24? Was it the no holds barred, no mercy, no sugar-coated story-telling method?I think it's a combination of a lot of things. My favorite reason for tuning in was that it was REAL. It wasn't like all the other CBS shows that unrealistically solve a murder in 40 minutes or resolve a court hearing in 40 minutes.The UNIT shows the not-so-pretty side of counter-terrorism secret units. A shadow company of elite soldiers who aren't even allowed to tell their wives what they do. But, unlike many CBS shows, you actually get to know the characters in the show. You get to see the HARD mission minded Jonas Blane (Haysbert) and the family man when he returns home. You get to see what the wives have to deal with while their men are away.The most important thing the UNIT gives its viewer is the understanding that GETTING THE JOB DONE, isn't always pretty. Isn't always moral. Isn't always negotiable. The UNIT also shows what it is to be military, what it is to be American, and what it is to do a thankless job.This show is gritty, dark, dangerous, secretive and it comes to a dramatic and shocking finale that will leave you salivating for the 2nd season episodes to begin their run.I'd give the DVD season set 5 stars, but the season was a mid-season replacement.

Thus, I got to know all these characters pretty quickly! I got annoyed at a few of them but overall was pleased because almost every episode was entertaining, and, hey, that's the name of the game. I would have preferred they had stuck to the military action stories each week and skipped the soap operas, but I understand they want more than just a male audience. Also, lulls were needed to break up the intense action here and there.All the characters, male and female, were interesting. Of the males, I had no problem with Dennis Haysbert (""Jonas Blane"") in the lead role. His character dominated the action stories. His deep voice and authoritative manner made him a very believable person as the leader of these missions The other, younger guys are fine, too. Their spouses run the gamut from experienced military wives to very young newlywed-rookies. Two of the three major female characters, however, had serious flaws: ""Tiffy"" as an adulterer, and ""Molly"" as a frequent liar. Speaking of moral issues, what turned me off more than anything was the commander ""Col. Tom Ryan"" (Robert Patrick) of this elite unit being the one having the affair with""Tiffy!"" Hey, I know everyone is human and subject to many daily sins but this seemed out of place and out of character with most everything else presented here.Oh, well, for the most part, the characters in this military show are honorable, brave and, hopefully by the second season a little better people, morally-speaking.

It has a terrific cast, with a great leading man in Dennis Haysbert, and makes for very compelling TV. The basics of this program are essentially an extension of one of Mamet's favorite recent subjects: The Black Ops soldiers. Their missions are secret, even to the people they love the most, and they are very important to the security of our nation. Even if the mission is ""BOHICA"". Mamet's love for this subject has been displayed in two of his recent efforts, SPARTAN, which he wrote and directed, and John Frankenheimer's RONIN, which he co-wrote under a psuedonym, which both focus on the lives and missions of professionals who will stop at nothing to get the job done. And as in everything Mamet, NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS. Don't believe what you hear, see, or feel. On occasion, the show can be a little predictable, but those who are students of Mamet's dialogue will definitely be able to tell the episodes that he himself has written, which by and large, are the best of the episodes.

A couple seasons ago he wrote and directed an episode of The Shield, and in its final year he wrote and directed a Hill Street Blues episode.  If you read what writer/directors  like John Sayles say about directing television, you realize that television is, unlike film, not really a director's medium but a writer's medium.  So the fact that Mamet, who has made himself into a quirky, often unpredictable filmmaker with movies as dissimilar as Things Change and Spartan and with a similar range of work in his scriptwriting ( The Verdict to The Edge to Ronin, not to mention his adaptations of his own plays), directs a few episodes of The Unit should not overly excite us: the fact, however, that Mamet is the mastermind and chief sensibility behind this show should.  Adapted from a  well written and exciting memoir by  Eric L. Haney (who also is a producer of the series) called Inside Delta Force, The Unit is Mamet in his genre-busting, most thought-provoking mode, much as he was in the underrated Spartan and little seen Homicide.  On one hand, The Unit is drenched in machismo and quite impressive action, as this small band of terrorist busting Delta operators zip across the world, meeting any threat to the US with steely-eyed toughness and unwavering intent.  Simultaneously there is the story of the families on the home front, wives mostly, who end up taking care of most of the family business as their husbands are on 24 hour a day call to go where the bad guys are.  On the surface this is what CBS does best: straightforward, simple minded action television, in the great tradition of JAG and NCIS.  But this is a Mamet and co-producer Shawn Ryan effort, and like Mamet's quirkier movies and Ryan's The Shield, this show plays with the  very conventions it dispenses.  What happens when the arms dealer you have to take down is guarded by an army of children (""Eating The Young"")?  Or when you become a wanted terrorist yourself when your mission in a friendly country is suddenly scraped (""Non Permissive Environment"")?  Or when you become the target of Guantanamo-like torture by fellow Americans in a seemingly routine training course (""SERE"")?  At home, what is it like to be a wife who cannot be told where her husband goes whenever he walks out the door on a mission? Who cannot tell anyone but her sister Unit wives about the job her husband does?  What does it mean to the most elite military unit in the US and to be, for all intents and purposes, not exist?  Mamet has always been fascinated by shadow lives, be it the con men of House of Games, multinationals in The Spanish Prisoner, the thieves of Heist and Ronin.  So as much as The Unit is an exciting and beautifully filmed series with a powerful cast (for those who have missed Regina Taylor since her stint on I'll Fly Away, it's great to see her again), it is a serious meditation on the cost on American's best men and women to fight a war on terror.  You can certainly watch The Unit the way you watch CSI, JAG, or NCIS, with half your brain on hold--it's exciting TV.  But you would be missing the best part of the show--the Mamet part.",5,Mamet TV--Never What You Expect,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,3173,"['David', 'Mamet', 'stranger', 'episodic', 'TV', 'couple', 'seasons', 'wrote', 'directed', 'episode', 'Shield', 'final', 'year', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'episode', 'read', 'what', 'writer/directors', 'John', 'Sayles', 'say', 'directing', 'television', 'realize', 'television', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'director', 'medium', 'writer', 'medium', 'fact', 'Mamet', 'who', 'made', 'quirky', 'often', 'unpredictable', 'filmmaker', 'movies', 'as', 'dissimilar', 'Things', 'Change', 'Spartan', 'similar', 'range', 'work', 'scriptwriting', 'Verdict', 'Edge', 'Ronin', 'not', 'mention', 'adaptations', 'own', 'plays', 'few', 'episodes', 'Unit', 'should', 'not', 'overly', 'excite', 'fact', 'however', 'Mamet', 'mastermind', 'chief', 'sensibility', 'show', 'should', 'Adapted', 'well', 'written', 'exciting', 'memoir', 'Eric', 'L.', 'Haney', 'who', 'also', 'producer', 'series', 'called', 'Inside', 'Delta', 'Force', 'Unit', 'Mamet', 'genre-busting', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'mode', 'much', 'was', 'underrated', 'Spartan', 'little', 'seen', 'Homicide', 'one', 'hand', 'Unit', 'drenched', 'machismo', 'quite', 'impressive', 'action', 'small', 'band', 'terrorist', 'busting', 'Delta', 'operators', 'zip', 'world', 'meeting', 'threat', 'US', 'steely-eyed', 'toughness', 'unwavering', 'intent', 'Simultaneously', 'story', 'families', 'home', 'front', 'mostly', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'care', 'most', 'family', 'business', 'husbands', 'are', '24', 'hour', 'day', 'call', 'go', 'where', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'surface', 'what', 'CBS', 'best', 'straightforward', 'simple', 'minded', 'action', 'television', 'great', 'tradition', 'JAG', 'NCIS', 'Mamet', 'co-producer', 'Shawn', 'Ryan', 'effort', 'Mamet', 'quirkier', 'movies', 'Ryan', 'Shield', 'show', 'very', 'conventions', 'What', 'when', 'arms', 'dealer', 'have', 'take', 'down', 'guarded', 'army', 'children', 'Eating', 'Young', 'when', 'become', 'wanted', 'terrorist', 'when', 'mission', 'friendly', 'country', 'suddenly', 'scraped', 'Non', 'Permissive', 'Environment', 'when', 'become', 'target', 'Guantanamo-like', 'torture', 'fellow', 'Americans', 'seemingly', 'routine', 'training', 'course', 'SERE', 'home', 'what', 'be', 'wife', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'told', 'where', 'husband', 'whenever', 'out', 'door', 'mission', 'Who', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'anyone', 'sister', 'Unit', 'job', 'husband', 'What', 'mean', 'most', 'elite', 'military', 'unit', 'US', 'be', 'intents', 'purposes', 'not', 'exist', 'Mamet', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'shadow', 'lives', 'be', 'con', 'men', 'House', 'Games', 'multinationals', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'thieves', 'Heist', 'Ronin', 'So', 'as', 'much', 'Unit', 'exciting', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'series', 'powerful', 'cast', 'who', 'have', 'missed', 'Regina', 'Taylor', 'stint', ""'ll"", 'Fly', 'Away', 'great', 'see', 'again', 'serious', 'meditation', 'cost', 'American', 'best', 'men', 'women', 'fight', 'war', 'terror', 'can', 'certainly', 'watch', 'Unit', 'way', 'watch', 'CSI', 'JAG', 'NCIS', 'brain', 'hold', 'exciting', 'TV', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'Mamet', 'part']",N/A

1001199,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000GB75CO,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 7]","I was initially drawn to ""The Unit"" because of David Mamet's involvement. His writing can be a thing of poetic machismo, blunt yet refined. And his name on a film or TV project is always worth a look. I, also, thought the subject matter was interesting for a serious network program. And the cast, without question, is a talented bunch. I was particularly excited to see Regina Taylor back in a series (an Emmy Winner for the criminally overlooked ""I'll Fly Away"").So having seen every episode of ""The Unit"", a big hit on TV, I'm afraid some of the individual pieces are a lot stronger than the end result for me.The show is kind of split into two parts: generally, the men are off on missions and the women are holding down the homefront.If the show was based solely on the missions, I'd have rated this a 3. While these scenes are certainly the better aspect of the program, they are a long way from original--Standard, generic assignments that you've seen in a hundred different other shows. But they are shot in a grittily realistic fashion, and that style can be appealing.If the show, however, was based solely on the homefront, I'd have rated it a 1. Yes--a 1. While I do like the actresses, they are given pretty thankless roles. So much ""speechifying"". The most unfortunate character for me is Kim. She is supposed to be progressive--yet is pious, preachy and self-righteous. That would be OK--some people are like that--if there was any REALISM to the role. Whether she is demanding change on the base, reform in policy, or revitalizing a local radio station--she is nothing more than a character construct. FALSE, FALSE, FALSE.Unfortunately, the show seems to be on a moral crusade. Nobility is great. But nobility at the expense of reality just isn't my thing. I'll take my drama a little more controversial, morally ambiguous and real. Check out ""Over There"" for a similarly structured show that actually takes chances.

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[49, 56]","I've always loved David Mamet films because of his brisk realistic dialogue and his preoccupation with the male code and its clash with civilization. That theme is well served in The Unit, even better than films, because he has the long-range TV landscape to develop his characters, Delta Force anti-terrorist unit who, for hardly any pay, risk their lives in international missions while their wives, living in a nondescript military base, pinch pennies and deal with the daily dramas of having husbands who could die in the blink of an eye. Avoiding sentimentality, piety, and jingoism, The Unit has an appropriately cynical look at power and the use of trickery to succeed against one's enemies and even one's bureacratic bosses. In this sense, The Unit resembles the show 24 but unlike 24, which is often over the top, The Unit employs psychological realism. Perhaps better than any TV show right now, The Unit specializes in riveting plot lines, especially employing the reversal, where the plot goes one way and then turns the tables in a way that never seems forced or arbitrary.

It is exciting, interesting, and thought-provoking; but the wives' storyline is just painful.I believe that it's due to a combination of poor writing for the women's characters and bad acting.  Most notably bad is the one having an affair with the colonel (can't think of her name, that's how forgettable she is).  The actress playing Molly Blane, who is normally good, is horrible in this role.  The best acting performance is for Mrs. Brown, but she needs to have better scripts.The most interesting parts are those when the men are on their missions.  The male performers are all very good actors.  If I were the writers, I would get rid of the colonel's mistress and Molly Blane characters; and replace them with better actresses.
