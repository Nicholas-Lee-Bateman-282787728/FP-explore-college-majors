923901,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000A8NZ0O,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 0]","Somewhat resembling a big budget `Blair Witch Project' for adults, `The Descent' finds six girlfriends from the U.K. spelunking in the caves of Appalachia after one of them, Sarah (Shaina McDonald), has a tragic family SUV accident.  Wanting to console her a year after she loses her husband, Sarah is not always a happy camper.  Everyone is all smiles in their mountain cabin, but soon we are confronted by the usual surprise tactics:  people sneaking up on others, bats coming out of nowhere, etc.  The movie then digs deep into the subconscious.  There are dream sequences that effectively tap our deeper regions.  Then, we go down physically.  (How refreshing it is to have a horror movie where going down and tunneling through caves replaces the forest or haunted buildings. )In the movie, writer and director, Neil Marshall, relies on plausible missteps.  There's the misplaced and left behind guide books, replaced in favor of adventure, and then there are injuries.  Tunneling through the caverns and tight holes made me feel claustrophobic, so true was the journey's authenticity.  (And I don't suffer from claustrophobia.)  There's also a foreboding presence that is made tangible with low-key creepy music.  In the story there is also some ambiguity about treachery that thickens the plot.  Led by Juno (Natalie Mendoza) but having Rebecca (Sashia Mulder) as a key player adds to our drama and makes the dangers lurking ahead all the more dire...The line, ""We all lost something in that crash,"" creates a tension and a needed ambiguity.  Twisty, just like the underground terrain, `The Descent' rises above most formula horror pictures, even, if like M. Night Shymalan's, `Signs,' and many others, it relies a great deal on anticipation to create its results.",3,Off the Beaten Path,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,1770,"['Somewhat', 'resembling', 'big', 'budget', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'adults', 'Descent', 'finds', 'six', 'girlfriends', 'U.K.', 'spelunking', 'caves', 'Appalachia', 'one', 'Sarah', 'Shaina', 'McDonald', 'tragic', 'family', 'SUV', 'accident', 'Wanting', 'console', 'year', 'husband', 'Sarah', 'not', 'always', 'happy', 'camper', 'Everyone', 'smiles', 'mountain', 'cabin', 'soon', 'are', 'confronted', 'usual', 'surprise', 'tactics', 'people', 'sneaking', 'up', 'others', 'bats', 'coming', 'nowhere', 'etc', 'movie', 'then', 'deep', 'subconscious', 'are', 'dream', 'sequences', 'effectively', 'deeper', 'regions', 'Then', 'go', 'down', 'physically', 'How', 'refreshing', 'have', 'horror', 'movie', 'where', 'going', 'down', 'tunneling', 'caves', 'replaces', 'forest', 'haunted', 'buildings', 'movie', 'writer', 'director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'plausible', 'missteps', 'misplaced', 'left', 'behind', 'guide', 'books', 'replaced', 'favor', 'adventure', 'then', 'are', 'injuries', 'Tunneling', 'caverns', 'tight', 'holes', 'made', 'feel', 'claustrophobic', 'so', 'true', 'was', 'journey', 'authenticity', 'do', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'claustrophobia', 'also', 'foreboding', 'presence', 'made', 'tangible', 'low-key', 'creepy', 'music', 'story', 'also', 'ambiguity', 'treachery', 'plot', 'Led', 'Juno', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'having', 'Rebecca', 'Sashia', 'Mulder', 'key', 'player', 'drama', 'dangers', 'lurking', 'ahead', 'more', 'dire', 'line', 'lost', 'something', 'crash', 'tension', 'needed', 'ambiguity', 'Twisty', 'just', 'underground', 'terrain', 'Descent', 'rises', 'most', 'formula', 'horror', 'pictures', 'even', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shymalan', 'Signs', 'many', 'others', 'great', 'deal', 'anticipation', 'create', 'results']","Descent,the Version anglais"
923902,A2RO5BKNBR7BSR,B000A8NZ0O,"A. BOSTON ""***""","[0, 0]","Besides the ending, which leaves you scratching your head, The Descent was excellent. The vague ending didnt bother me that much. It lets you end it the way you want to in your own mind. Did that really happen the way I seen it? What exactly happened? What was real and what was in that persons head? It ended in a way that leads to talk after the film on what YOU think happened. And I like that.What this movie does extremely well is the fear of tight spaces. I am not claustrophobic AT ALL but this film had me freaked out even before all heck broke loose. The girls fit thru tight shafts about 18 inches square, some filled with water. Gasping for air, the roof falling in on them. It had me on edge just from that. Another plus for the movie what that ""the crawlers"" did not show up until about 45-50 minutes in. Up to that point all you had to be afraid of was the girls getting trapt underground. It was as if the film maker wanted to lull you into thinking nothing was lurking in the shadows. Then BAM, over half way thru the movie ""the crawlers"" pop out and the whole mood changes.These nasty buggers have no sight, pale white skin and sharp hearing. They never see the light of day. They have been living in these caves for hundreds of years. Were they once human? I think so. And living in the darkness for centuries they lost sight, gained hearing and lost the ability to speak. These guys are gross. The way they move sends chills. They creap around and you never know when they will pop out.I suggest you pop The Descent in for friends and dont tell anyone what the plot of the movie is. Nearly an hour will go by without anyone guessing what the movie is really about. It will shock everyone I promise you! AWESOME!!!!",5,Great yet confusing at the end.

923904,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000A8NZ0O,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 1]","The Descent is one of the best horror movies I've ever watched. It's actually scary, the gore is gut-wrenching, the setting is great, and the creature designs are great. If you love horror movies, you need to watch this movie because it's the best horror movie made in over a decade.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Six women; Sarah, Juno, Beth, Rebecca, Holly, and Sam; go on a cave-climbing trip in the Appalachian Mountains, and find a mysterious cave no one has been in for over a century and wish to claim it and name it... or at least Juno does. The rest of the group thinks they're going to Borham Caverns. Things seem to be going well for a while, until the cave entrance collapses, and now they are trapped two miles underground with grotesque human-like creatures who like the taste of flesh.STORYLINE: SCORE: 8 OUT OF 10- Some parts of the story evoke memories of storylines that would come from a movie in the '80s, or perhaps earlier. However, the story is done well, although the beginning is slow, and it never gives an explanation as to what those creatures are, or an explanation of the bizarre and creepy ending. But that will never really bother you.MUSIC: SCORE: 9 OUT OF 10- There's not much, but it's good, and it knows when the pivotal moments of terror in the film come up.GORE FACTOR: SCORE: 9.75 OUT OF 10- The gore is just plain nasty and nausea-inducing. Eye-squishing, rock-climbing-axe-stabbing, falling into giant pools of blood, broken leg, and people being eaten... lovely.SCARE FACTOR: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- Don't watch this movie in the dark, it will scare the hell out of you. The film is tense a lot as you fear what comes next, and you don't know what comes next. It's really a marvel to see a film that still has an ability to scare you.ENTERTAINMENT: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- Aside from a slow beginning, this film has the perfect entertainment for horror fans and will definitely satisfy those who are looking for something that is actually scary and worth watching as a horror movie. Don't watch this movie if you're afraid of the dark or you're claustrophobic because it is loaded with these fears.OVERALL: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- This film is incredible and rather impressive, as it puts so many other horror movies to shame. You will enjoy it, you will get the crap scared out of you, and you will feel a little sick from the gore...

The Descent follows the rules, then surpasses them, then breaks them in its wake. This movie is phenomenal.For years I slovenly sagged by head after viewing one dissappointing horror flick after another. Jeez what a sad journey, but now I am happy and oh so pleased to tell you my amazon friends, a new king (or queen shall I say) is born for horror.The Descent transends the murky and abysmal, then turns it into a ride that cannot be ignored. Horror fans must see this movie. It is genuinely intense and at times, downright frightening.I don't want to delve into the story. There are far too many people ready and willing to give exhaustive descriptions of the plot. I can do it in one sentence, then I shall tell you of my personal experience.Seven women go off on an expedition into the earth, then almost immediately, the spiral into hopeless, claustrophobic darkness ensues. Oh yes, then there are the creatures...People were screaming, jumping, gasping and running out of the theater. Two girls on the top row had panic attacks, and that was before the movie was half over. I personally was sucked in. Usually I am able to keep a safe distance from the films I watch, so that I can relate to others whether or not the movie is ""good"". I couldn't help it. It teased, pulled then ultimately drew me in. Can any better compliment be given to a movie?The Descent is what every good scary film hopes to be, but seldom reaches. It's fantastic and truly scary. The Queen is dead - long live the Queen._____(Update - Jan 10th, 2006)I have now seen the Descent four times. I'll have to admit that I was always left wanting more with the ending. I thought it was a cheep conclusion to a masterpiece. The R-Rated version, I now know, is to blame for this. Thankfully, now there is the unrated version!

923907,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B000A8NZ0O,A. Estes,"[6, 7]","Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) could use some cheering up. Just one year ago, she lost her husband and her only daughter to a bad car accident. In an effort to cheer her up, five of her best friends take her on a vacation into the Appalachian Mountains for some routine spelunking. Things go horribly wrong, however, when they find themselves trapped and without a map inside one of the caves. Unfortunately for them, this cave has yet to be thoroughly explored and an unknown threat lurks in the darkness, ready to attack and threaten their solidarity and sanity.Writer/director Neil Marshall spends ample time building up the characters to the point where they feel real, but also wastes no time in getting to the point. It isn't long before our characters are submersed into the abyss from which they spend 90 minutes of the film trying to escape. A claustrophobic's nightmare come true, the film makes sure you're in the cave with the characters as they fight for their lives with a careful balance of character development and spooky atmosphere, achieved by its stunning cinematography and authentic location. By the time you get to the gore and the creature effects, the movie has already done its job and the rest is just icing on the cake.In fact, that's pretty much what sets ""The Descent"" apart from most modern horror stories. Rather than relying on outlandish death scenes and over-the-top gore, it's slightly restrained in its old-school approach that values tension over eye-candy. To be blunt, the death scenes are probably the last thing you'll remember from this film. What you'll likely take away from it is an unmistakable and unforgiving tone, a healthy portion of unforgettable imagery (see: climbing up a hill of human skulls) and an ending that will stay with you for days. It's a well-rounded, well-written and effectively directed film that warrants repeat viewings to absorb it all. With this film, Neil Marshall has certainly earned himself a spot in the echelon of iconic horror movie directors, and is truly a visionary to keep an eye on.A sequel is currently on the horizon, although what would possess Sarah to enter that cave again remains to be seen, especially if you are to go by the original ending -- found in the ""Original Unrated Cut"" (the true version of the film) -- which leaves nowhere for a sequel to go. By itself, though, it stands alone as a modern classic for a reason and a film that will effectively creep out and thrill audiences for many decades to come. When this decade is looked back upon in future years, ""The Descent"" will no doubt sit at the top of the pile of films that helped define horror movie cinema in the new millennium.",5,"""The Descent"" reaches new heights of horror.",1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,2680,"['Sarah', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'could', 'use', 'cheering', 'up', 'Just', 'one', 'year', 'ago', 'lost', 'husband', 'only', 'daughter', 'bad', 'car', 'accident', 'effort', 'cheer', 'up', 'five', 'best', 'friends', 'take', 'vacation', 'Appalachian', 'Mountains', 'routine', 'spelunking', 'Things', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'however', 'when', 'find', 'trapped', 'map', 'one', 'caves', 'Unfortunately', 'cave', 'yet', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'explored', 'unknown', 'threat', 'lurks', 'darkness', 'ready', 'attack', 'threaten', 'solidarity', 'sanity.Writer/director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'ample', 'time', 'building', 'up', 'characters', 'point', 'where', 'feel', 'real', 'also', 'time', 'getting', 'point', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'characters', 'are', 'submersed', 'abyss', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'trying', 'escape', 'claustrophobic', 'nightmare', 'come', 'true', 'film', 'sure', ""'re"", 'cave', 'characters', 'fight', 'lives', 'careful', 'balance', 'character', 'development', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'achieved', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'authentic', 'location', 'time', 'get', 'gore', 'creature', 'effects', 'movie', 'already', 'done', 'job', 'rest', 'just', 'icing', 'cake.In', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'Descent', 'apart', 'most', 'modern', 'horror', 'stories', 'Rather', 'relying', 'outlandish', 'death', 'scenes', 'over-the-top', 'gore', 'slightly', 'restrained', 'old-school', 'approach', 'tension', 'eye-candy', 'be', 'blunt', 'death', 'scenes', 'are', 'probably', 'last', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'film', 'What', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'take', 'away', 'unmistakable', 'unforgiving', 'tone', 'healthy', 'portion', 'unforgettable', 'imagery', 'see', 'climbing', 'up', 'hill', 'human', 'skulls', 'ending', 'will', 'stay', 'days', 'well-rounded', 'well-written', 'effectively', 'directed', 'film', 'warrants', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'absorb', 'film', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'certainly', 'earned', 'spot', 'echelon', 'iconic', 'horror', 'movie', 'directors', 'truly', 'visionary', 'keep', 'eye', 'on.A', 'sequel', 'currently', 'horizon', 'what', 'would', 'possess', 'Sarah', 'enter', 'cave', 'again', 'be', 'seen', 'especially', 'are', 'go', 'original', 'ending', 'found', 'Original', 'Unrated', 'Cut', 'true', 'version', 'film', 'nowhere', 'sequel', 'go', 'though', 'alone', 'modern', 'classic', 'reason', 'film', 'will', 'effectively', 'creep', 'out', 'thrill', 'audiences', 'many', 'decades', 'come', 'When', 'decade', 'looked', 'back', 'future', 'years', 'Descent', 'will', 'doubt', 'sit', 'top', 'pile', 'films', 'helped', 'define', 'horror', 'movie', 'cinema', 'new', 'millennium']","Descent,the Version anglais"
923908,A13QNGUB9IYTY4,B000A8NZ0O,"A Hermit ""J.Hamric""","[1, 1]","I don't know why some people hate this film. I have read the bad reviews, and tried to sympathize, but I can't. It's got a somewhat slow beginning, but you can't always just jump into the action, and keep it up.The ""descent"" is figurative, as well as literal. The lead character, traumatized over the death of her husband and daughter in a vehicle accident, is having a hard time trying to cope with and process what happened to her.  In time, she and her friends embark on a caving trip, and the one leading the trip, named ""Juno,"" decided to surprise the rest of them by going to an uncharted cave, and they become hopelessly lost. And, there was apparently a betrayal by this Juno, and a lot of guilt ensues.But, being in an underground cave is a very claustrophobic experience; I once went on such a trip with some friends, and even though we didn't go too far down, and the upper part was explored and well-lit, we went into the dark part, and it's not a pleasant experience. You can actually feel the darkness, it's incomprehensibly dark, and seeing these people become stranded, with nothing around but the cave walls, I got uncomfortable watching it. So, when they start to see creatures in the deeper parts of the cave, it would be easy to just say it's the mind playing tricks. But why does nobody ever believe the person who says they have seen something? This is an old cliche', but it adds to the discomfort of experiencing this.When you go into the depths like this, you don't know what you'll find, and sometimes, it's better not to find anything. You are in their turf, they are perfectly adapted to their surroundings. There are detractors of this film who say it isn't scary, and I believe such people probably take Ritalin. Psychological terror goes on in the viewer's mind, as well as on the screen, and when we finally see the creatures that live in the cave, you now have some people who are lost, injured, disoriented, and quickly losing hope, plus now, they are hunted by these ghastly things that would tear you apart as soon as look at you (if they had eyes, these things, living in total darkness, are blind from birth). One reviewer, who hated the film, and gave it one star, said ""...the monsters didn't look real...""I would ask you, how are they supposed to look? They live underground, apart from people, and aren't even a real species to begin with. But given this mindset, they would probably say the same thing upon seeing a deep-sea fish for the first time. Hey, they don't ""look real"" either.This film has probably the bleakest ending I have ever seen.

Six women, down into the depth of the earth.  Now I am a big horror fan in my own right.  I like movies that can take cliches and rework them into something interesting and phasing.  This movie is one of those kind of movies.  Then again, this is being shown to us by the same people who brought us Saw and Hostel--two sets of films I really don't care for because I go to a movie to be scared, not to watch torture scenes that I'm well aware of after studying such incidents as the Holocaust.  But I digress.  What I like about this movie is that, unlike Cave, this movie really does make you feel claustrophobic.  You really do think you are down there, with the women, at least as private observers, and that what they feel you feel.  Fear.  Uncertainty.  Anger.  Distrust.  I have to give the women of this film high marks.  They knew how to take six women characters and really build upon them better than you would tend to think (I mean really, it seems that in most horror movies women are running around screaming blah blah blah, but in this film, they know how to fight back against each other and the monsters).  The violence is visceral and nasty, but realistic and coordinated.  The monsters, whatever they were, were mean and unnameable.

The second half of this movie, i.e., when the monsters really come out, can get a little less than fully entertaining.

923918,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000A8NZ0O,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","When `The Descent' was released I had heard all the hype, I had read all the reviews and so I was dying to see it, but I truly had no idea all that I was really in for.  Have you ever watched a film that nestled so far beneath the surface of your skin that even when things aren't outright horrific you still find yourself shaking in anticipation of all that is bound to go wrong?  That is the feeling I got when watching this film for the first time.  This feeling is owed in large part to the breathtaking direction on the part of Neil Marshall who just went for it here, throwing caution to the wind and delivering a brutally heart racing horror film.  The one thing that will stick with you though throughout the whole of `The Descent' is the feeling of hopelessness, and I think that is due to the setting.  Having this horror film take place below the depths of the Earth was a brilliant, and I mean brilliant, idea.  Not only are we in fear of the `crawlers' but the audience is able to share in the claustrophobic feelings of those in the film.There are scenes within this film where I literally felt as though I couldn't breathe.The film opens with a tragic accident.  Friends Sarah, Beth and Juno have been rafting down rapids while Sarah's husband and daughter hang back and watch.  Upon their departure home though, tragedy strikes and both Sarah's husband and daughter are killed.  The movie then jumps forward a year and we meet up with the three women again.  This time they are accompanied by three other women, sisters Sam and Rebecca and newcomer Holly.  They have met in the Appellation Mountains for a caving trip.  We are given a few moments to get to know our cast of women before they set off and descend down a cave.  Juno has appointed herself the guide since the trip was her idea, but unbeknownst to the group Juno has taken it upon herself to lead them into a cave that has never been charted, a decision that proves disastrous.Upon their entry the audience can immediately feel the tension.  Your skin starts to tighten and your breath gets short as you contemplate the feelings of confined closure.  It reminds me of the feeling I got the first time I watched `Jaws', that creepy crawling sensation that ran across your legs as you imagined what you couldn't see gnawing at your skin from beneath the depths of the water.  It's that fear of the unknown, the unseen horrors that prove the most effective.  Soon after descent the group finds themselves trapped as their point of entry caves in.This sense of hopelessness only intensifies when the girls get their first sighting of the `crawlers'.  I expected the `crawlers' since the trailer gave many a hint to their presence but what I didn't expect was to be afraid of so much more than just some creatures.  The `crawlers' are in fact horrifying to encounter.  They are disturbing to the sight and deadly to the touch.  What makes their presence even more disturbing is the setting.  I keep coming back to the fact that they are confined underground for a reason.  I deeply feel that if the setting were more open, like say the woods or something, the fear would be less extensive.  When you can barely move, let alone run, and you can see no further than a few feet ahead of you, let alone behind you, then any and everything becomes all the more terrifying.Another major plus to the film is the acting.  The cast of actresses are strong, neither of them resorting to overacting, which is a problem very common in this breed of horror film.  Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza (who play Sarah and Juno) are especially effective here, but the entire cast is well rounded and balanced.  As a part of the cast (so to speak) Neil Marshall makes his presence known with such flare in the director's seat.

923922,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000A8NZ0O,Anton Ilinski,"[7, 11]","I'm immensely happy that couple of times a year I come across such movies as ""The Descent"" although I can't remember exactly when was the last one. I heard that a new movie came out by the director of ""Dog Soldiers"" and that was enough for me to start looking for the flick. And I was very surprised having found out it's in theaters. I watched it two days back and was totally blown away. I heard different opinions about its flaws and so on, but hey, there ain't no movies without plot holes. And ""The Descent's"" flaws were the minor ones, you won't notice them if they are not looked very hard for.If you watched ""Dog Soldiers"" you can get the idea about ""The Descent"" meaning its mood and atmosphere - Neil Marshall can frighten the audience very well and that's a fact. Remote Appalachian Mountains, sinister woods, gloomy sky - all that work just fine. The distinguishing feature of this film is that all of its characters are females (the only male character is being annuled within the first 5 minutes of the film in a rather grizzly way). And they are not usual horror film stupid teenage girls who like to show breasts, shriek and then be killed brutally. They are quite reasonable women in their late 20-ies or early 30-ies, who can deal with extraordinary situations as it seems. And there are lots of them (situations) to come.Six friends find themselves trapped in a cave and try to get out. Neil Marshall brilliantly managed these cave scenes, moving camera through narrow crawlways - you really start feeling claustrophobic. I personally don't have problems with elevators, but always felt uneasy lying under the bed as a child, so in the theater I found myself covering with cold sweat while watching those scenes. And it's not just the cave that will make you sweat. After the first 50-60 minutes of the movie THEY show up, and THEY will give you much more creeps. But the main Marshall's achievement is that he made quite a realistic flick about feminine frienship. The film demonstrates what six girls would do in extreme circumstances. Of course they try to help each other, but finally you see they don't know whom to fear most - THEM or each other. For they all have different and at times difficult relations with some secrets as usual. This human relations theme adds a lot of substance to the movie. Another good thing is that characters don't make stupid things like in many horror films. We see girls can act bravely, fight furiously and not die shrieking stupidly. One day in life a situation may come when you'll have to make a torch out of your friend's shinbone, and these girls demonstrate us some people won't quail when they're in such an extreme situation.""The Descent"" delivers to us a sense and mood of a real horror movie which is unlike latest PG-13 films. It's not funny for a second, it's brutal and obscure, it scares on all levels - it has suspense, fear of the dark, claustrophobia, fear of some unknown creatures, repulsion of seeing gore and guts.Speaking of gore - ""The Descent"" is very graphic and grim, American filmmakers don't dare lately to make their movies that graphic. I noticed that British and European in general flicks remain practically the only ones to really shock the audience.""The Descent"" is one of the best horror pictures I've seen in my life (and I've almost seen them all), I'm definately buying it on DVD.UPDATE (3/4/06): Just got the DVD from England. It's one of the best editions I've seen. First disc is a feature itself with director & cast commentary and director & crew commentary, the second one is filled with extras: 40-minute detailed ""making of"" featurette, extended and deleted scenes (about 10 of them), blooper-reel (one of the most hilarious I've seen on DVDs), storyboards, stills galleries, cast and crew biographies, two trailers and a TV-spot.The movie's transfer is rather good, I was afraid it wouldn't since all the action takes place in the dark. Certainly a Superbit edition would be better (and I hope it comes out eventually), but this one is also pretty adequate.The menus are a real piece of art, I haven't seen many like these. Great work.Somehow I liked ""The Descent"" now even more than when I watched it in theater, believe me this DVD is just awesome.

923923,A1JLIG5EIQZMD0,B000A8NZ0O,aquestari,"[1, 1]","I went to see 'The Descent' which is a movie about four friends who go on a caving trip and face their worst fears whilst they're down there.Would these movies be as scary as they are without the unexpected loudness in all the places? Probably not. Still, it was quite interesting for what it was. Kinda like the 'Poseidon' of the caves, wandering through unnavigated areas trying to find a way out, and tragedies occuring frequently along the way.The monsters got a bit much though. Creamy yellow slimy monsters which scream at and eat people. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all. They all look like Golum from 'Lord Of The Rings' still.At least the movie wasn't an American blockbuster, it was English. That's something. And you kinda get to know the characters, understanding their personalities in every scene, learning their names and not forgetting them, remembering when someone has died.My favourite characters were Holly and Juno. Holly was funny and knew how to have a laugh. She annoyed everyone else but she was probably the funnest of them all. No-one really liked Juno but she meant well. I think she would have tried her best for her friends and wouldn't purposely try to hurt them, still, she was the hated one in the end.The scariest part is when the real life realities are shown. How when we rot away (or in this case flesh eaten by raging mad monsters) all that we are, are bones underneath, and how death can happen so easily. It's frightening how each and every one of us are so robot like, we're machines, humans with minds, feelings, thoughts and emotions, but our bodies are totally separate from that; one false move and we're gone, nothing can change that.

They portray events without relating the horror to the film's characters - or worse, they leave us not caring at all and able only to think about the graphic nature of the film.Some think ""The Descent"" is a movie about six women who 'descend' into a cave and are attacked by man-eating monsters. Yes, those things occur. But that is not what the movie is about. The monsters only catalyzed the most horrifying aspects of the story.  ""The Descent"" easily could have been made without them.""The Descent"" is a tale about friendship, adventure, and betrayal; it's about the women's descent into savagery as the price they paid for grim survival; and, for one, it's about a final plunge into madness. This film wasn't made in Hollywood, so don't look for a happy ending. While the US release has an outwardly softer ending than the British version, appearances can be deceptive.This wasn't a perfect movie.

923927,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000A8NZ0O,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[111, 148]","Neil Marshall's follow-up to his cult-favorite werewolf film, Dog Soldiers, has finally arrived in the US. The Descent doesn't disappoint and I must say that Marshall's filmmaking skills have dramatically improved since the last time he's made and released a film. The Descent marks another notch on the resurgence of the horror genre's return to its darker, meaner and exploitative past when filmmakers weren't shy about pushing the boundaries.The film begins with a tragedy that strikes at the heart of one of the women in the film. Sarah's (played by Shauna MacDonald) tragic losses in the initial beginnings of the film becomes the emotional and psychological foundation that gives The Descent its emotional heft. It turns Marshall's film from just your typical survival-horror film into one about interesting female group dynamics and the measures people would take in order to survive. The rest of the cast appear pretty quickly. There's Sarah's friend Beth (played by Alex Reid) who accompanies Sarah to the US at the invitation of their American friend Juno (played by the hot Natalie Mendoza). This trio of friends are soon joined the trio of Holly (Nora Jane-Noonan) and a pair of sisters in Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Becca (Saskia Mulder). With Juno taking lead in what was to be a bonding weekend for all the ladies, The Descent gradually brings about a heavy sense of dread that something is amiss not just at the activity they're about to engage in but in the group dynamics within the female group.The six ladies undertake a spelunking expedition in a cave system in the Appalachian Mountains (already the film takes its first nod of homage to another great film about survival, Deliverance). The outdoor scenes in the woods was actually shot in the forests of Scotland, but one could never guess and Marshall doesn't linger overmuch in the bright, airy and safe outdoors. Juno soon leads her all-female spelunkers deep into the cave. Their descent into the darkening and gradually oppresive depths of the cave system takes abit longer than necessary, but just when the film was about to become a rehash of Cliffhanger, things suddenly become claustrophobic and the sense that every moment these ladies continue their descent the closer they put themselves into the arms of their inevitable doom.Things go from bad to worse in a cave-in scene that's sure to make those with problems of claustrophobia to close their eyes tightly and cover their ears. Except for a few slightly fake looking cave in rocks and debris, this cave-in scene will get hearts pumping and nerves racing. The scene is shot in a very up-close and intimate fashion that the audience has no choice but to feel as if they're trapped in that barely there tunnel as it begins to collapse around Sarah and Juno. Once the scene is over the ladies soon find themselves cut-off from the only exit they know. One could almost see panic begin to set-in, nerves fray and tempers simmer on the participants. Juno, already established as the alpha-female of the group, continues to take charge of the situation but already her reckless and infectious bravado in the beginning of the film becomes more of a thin veneer hiding a personality that uses such traits to hide a much more duplicitous and cowardly persona.From this moment of the film until the very final shot (well for the American version at least and more on that later), The Descent takes the meaning of oppresive claustrophobia and magnifies it to the nth degree. Gone are the daylight and open air of the outside forest. Even the upper levels of the cave would be a welcome sight for its stalactites and rock formations glittering from excess water runoff reflecting ambient light. Their descent deeper into the cavern system truly seems like a descent into that primordial fear everyone has since their earliest years: the fear of the dark and the unknown. Then to compound those primordial fears, Marshall adds in the internal conflict and discovered betrayals and secrets within the group dynamic. Its bad enough that these ladies have to contend with the terror of the surrounding darkness and what might dwell in its absence of light, but now personal baggage and secrets puts a new degree of danger to their chances of survival. Steel Magnolias this female-bonding film it is not.Neil Marshall and his cinematographer, Sam McCurdy, really play with the senses and fears of not just the audience but of the characters trapped in the dark with only a dwindling supply of glowsticks and batteries for their flashlights. The scenes which evokes some of the biggest moments of fright and horror shows nothing on the screen but a blackened, lightless sequence. These scenes impact in terms of horror were compounded by Marshall's excellent use of sound and its effect in confined, lightless spaces. The audience might not see whats going on in the scene, but we sure could hear every panting, panicky breath, random trickling of water that gives an impression of blind, water torture, and unknown rustles of movement that seem to come in from every direction. The Descent makes great use of the surround sound system in the theater. I noticed more than a few times people looking up and around the theater wondering if the sound is coming from those directions.The boogeyman, or men (and thats using the term very loosely), don't make an appearance until almost halfway through the film, but the first look the audience get of the Crawlers is bound to give some viewers nightmakes for days to come. The Crawlers themselves were not fully explained and they're barely seen until the very final reel of the film. Marshall's decision to let the claustrophobia and disorienting darkness hint more than show in the early stages of their fight against the Crawlers was pivotal one since it kept the monstrous visage of the creatures from becoming overly familiar too soon. Marshall gives us hints of whats stalking the ladies and lets the audiences' fevered imagination make up the rest. Once the Crawlers are seen abit more fully they're appearance and behavior do not fail whatever imagined concepts the viewer made. These creatures are fast, vicious and more than abit hungry. The scenes where the Crawlers wreak bloody havoc on Sarah, Juno and the rest of the gang will delight and satisfy fans of gore while making those not used to them quesy to their stomach. Marshall doesn't go overboard with the gore, but he does shoot and choreograph the violence in an almost lyrical fashion. He's also made the characters fleshed out enough that the audience wants them to survive and cheer whenever they fight back with a modicum of success.The Descent is such a refreshing, albeit one that's also terrifying and pulse-pounding, horror film. It takes the recent resurgence of extreme horror, or goreror as some have called it, but keeps the balance between primal terror and gory disgust. Marshall does a fine job of keeping the story from descending too much into the realm of extreme exploitation. The exploitative nature of the film's violence is still there, but it never becomes so much as to desensitize and turn away the people its trying to scare and entertain. The film doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The premise has been done in films such as Alien and Predator. The look of the film once the group is trapped underground even has hints of Argento as Marshall and McCurdy make great use of lighting in an attempt to pierce the solid darkness of the cave.The last couple years have given fans of the horror genre quite a good list of very good to great films heralding the return of horror to its very hard rated-R roots. Its a place that has been neglected too long by Hollywood and filmmakers, in general. Now we have The Descent to continue building on what films like The Devil's Rejects and The Hills Have Eyes, and to a lesser degree, Hostel and the Saw series, have begun in giving the fans of the horror genre what they truly want. What we really want are horror films that are not just about atmosphere and mood lighting, but also one that's brutal, nerve-wracking, and adrenaline-pumping. Horror was meant to be in the realm of R and NC-17 and not in the sissified level of PG-13. Neil Marshall has proven that his cult-classic Dog Soldiers was not a fluke. He has shown with The Descent that he's more than able to join the ranks of the new crop of horror auteurs like Rob Zombie and Alejandre Aja. Here's to hoping that Marshall continues to make great horror films.",5,Neil Marshall proves that Dog Soldiers wasn't a fluke and that he is here to stay,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,8525,"['Neil',

This movie makes me feel claustrophobic, and I hate feeling claustrophobic. So what does that mean? I love this movie. Most horror movies either make me laugh or entertain me in ways that's almost like I was watching an episode of Barney, but this one is different. It seemed realistic. Not that there's probably something Gollum-like rolling around in your local cave, but the idea of cave exploring doesn't sound completely far-fetched, or like something you could never go out and experience. Losing your equipment while exploring? Possible. A tiny earthquake that was enough to shift rocks and block an entrance? Ditto. It wasn't as though there was some spaceship flying around in the cave snatching up the hooks and equipment needed to make it from one end of the cave to the other.The HOLY CRAP SHOCK moments are completely realistic and really do leave you feeling HOLY CRAP SHOCK. I loved the gore, too. There's nothing better than Gollum taking bites out of your body, or people falling from ledges and breaking bones. I suppose it also helps that none of these ladies were really super well known, so it wasn't all ""hey, look at that 50-time Oscar winner climbing rocks!""

And every year a few diamonds are found among all that rubble and trash. THE DESCENT is one of those diamonds. An tragic tale of an innocent cavejumping expedition gone wrong. So what's to love about this flick?Well I enjoyed the story. There were so many elements. The cave dwellers are just a small part of a bigger tapestry. The characters are well written. I loved that the women featured in this film were experienced athletes. No bimbos tripping over high heels here. I was blown away by the big reveal as to why they are in that cave in the first place. Yeah, there's blood and guts here and there but it's the psychological stuff that really hits home. I was more terrified of Sarah getting stuck in a crawlspace than a cave ghoul leaping from the ceiling. Not as gory as advertised but what is shown should satisfy slasher fans. And it's not just the monsters dealing the pain either.My only concern is that THE DESCENT may not translate as well to DVD. The theater experience was incredible so I figure if you don't have one of those super-duper home systems then just shut off all the lights and light sources and hopefully that will be just as good.

923931,AXNIHQHKP52MN,B000A8NZ0O,Aveen B. Zachariah,"[0, 3]","I recently watched the blue ray version of this movie with the expectation of the new horrow classic, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. I hope this is not your introduction to the new horror genre because high tension, them, may, and inside are all far superior than this film (French horror is awesome). The movie spent alot of time setting up for the scenes in the cave and had some pointless story before they finally even got to the cave. It seemed like for over half the movie you are sitting there waiting for something to happen. It was so dull, luckilly I had my computer and was surfing the net. I also feel that creatures themselves looked like a knock-off of a sci-fi channel movie. They look like a combination of nosferatu with pirranha teeth.  If you see the movie for hot girls you may be happy, but don't expect much to get you to excited....i.e. no nudity.(A cardinal sin if hot girls are in horror movies) There were some scenes in the cave that were quite intense, but not enough.

Unlike such films as 'Creep', which was a complete mess, The Descent is a chilling experience that places believable characters into a situation that is strangely real, despite the obvious fiction.Films with great gore abound, for example Jason X, with the audience just waiting for the next gruesome killing to end the tedium in between. However, The Descent keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout, struggling for breath as you feel the walls closing in. This is a film to watch in a very dark room with great surround sound.

This moment was so effective that I stopped the movie at that point and couldn't come back to it for nearly a week.The movie has a lot in common with the great Sci-fi horror classic, `Alien'. All major action takes place in a venue the human heroes of the story cannot, or at least cannot easily escape. The terror they face, aside from the isolation, is an unimaginably horrible, unreasoning, and relentless foe, driven by a totally alien (!) hunger to have our heroes for lunch. Both monster types are preternaturally quick and seem to have senses beyond the abilities of mere humans. The heroes are also short on anything that could be considered a viable weapon against the monsters. There is even the element of a traitor in the group of humans who is willing to give up a comrade's life to save their own. (The `Alien' analogue is far more ambiguous, as the `traitor' is an android who is simply following `company policy' over protecting his crew's lives. The ambiguous cross-purpose makes better tragedy than simple selfishness.)The question immediately comes up as to why this movie doesn't have the same great cache as that Ridley Scott masterpiece. Much of it has to do with superior production values. Scott had a much bigger budget, a cast of talented, seasoned and easily recognized character actors, truly shocking surprise scenes, and a great monster design by H. R. Geiger which has yet to be outdone. And, in spite of Scott's love of very dark scenes, his lighting was still far more skillfully handled than in the difficult scenes in what appeared to be a cave two miles underground.Writer Marshall skillfully camouflages this fact, but the movie still suffers from using some of the oldest horror flick cliches in the book. The enormously scary setup scene where the group of six English twenty-something women find themselves trapped in a previously unexplored and presumably undiscovered cave in the mountains of the Eastern US is established due to a colossally stupid mistake by the group's leader. This is not much different from a group of teenagers trekking off to the scene of previous group murders for which the perp has not been caught (See Friday the 13th ad nausaum). They are left totally to their own resources because the group leader brought them to this cave without notifying any authorities of their whereabouts and with no map or even special equipment suitable for a true exploration rather than a conventional spelunking excursion in a familiar cave.Needless to say, things go downhill from there. Leaving aside the complications introduced by the blind humanoid monsters, our heroes do few of the things one would expect them to do in that situation. They recognize that the batteries on their helmet lamps won't last forever, but they don't turn three or four (out of six) of them off to conserve the batteries. They also don't start a map of their progress as soon as they encounter a fork in the cave. The very worst thing is when they separate and some members of the party throw caution to the wind and end up with a broken leg, making the situation even worse for the whole party.I am sure the situation is capable of turning even the most levelheaded people to hysteria, but these are not callow (American) teenagers. They are experienced cave explorers with all the right equipment for routine and skills for negotiating virtually any situation you would find in large limestone caves. This makes their devolving into panic a little harder to understand. Of course, one can easily counter that they seem to pull it together until the blind monsters make their appearance. I can see this; except that the blind monsters are real wimps and far less plausible (given the premises of the flick) than our horrific Alien. Since they are blind, they literally walk over our immobile heroes who don't make a sound. But one would think that in addition to hearing, their sense of smell would also be heightened, and I'm sure the girls, after working up a sweat with all their exertions, would have been pretty ripe.Unlike the climax to `Alien', the ending to this film was almost totally unsatisfactory. It seems as if the least deserving girl escapes, then the escape is taken away from us, as it may have been only a dream, followed by an implausible hallucination with a birthday cake and candles.This has the elements of a great horror movie. It certainly has a better (even if a bit derivative) plot than `Saw' or `Hostel', or even most of the `Texas Chainsaw' remakes, but some pieces are missing, and the difficulties of filming in a cave lit by battery lights, flares, or torches are not entirely overcome.As befitting an independent B movie such as this, it has very good extras, especially the two voice-over commentaries. The commentaries reveal the surprising fact that almost all the cave shots were done in a studio and the opening shot as they rappel down the large cave opening was done mostly with CGI. The problem is that one good voice-over would have been better than these two weak commentaries, which tend to repeat themselves.If you are fond of good scary movies, there is no question that this one, in its own way, is scarier and more original than most, but it's use of the old familiar conventions catch up to it with a weak ending.",4,Superbly Scary Moments.

Some of them introduce new characters that send goose bumps up our backs. Others tread over old material and put a fresh spin on them. But THE DESCENT doesn't do any of that.Comically labeled as ""Six Chicks With Picks,"" this cave exploration thriller has the obligatory fright scenes (you know the kind ...where something weird suddenly and loudly burst toward screen), the attractive die-off cast, and themes trodden over time and again (from ALIENS to the horrible film THE CAVE.)For some reason this flick has gotten several positive reviews by professional film critics, but I fail to see why. There's nothing original. Nothing that lingers after watching it. No truly memorable cast members.That we're supposed to sympathize with Sarah (Shauna Mcdonald), the main character, is rammed down our throats (and through her husband's head) when a car accident takes Sarah's family from her. A year later, a group of girlfriends get together to go spelunking and to try and heal the wounds left by the death of Sarah's husband and child. There's a touch of deceit going on as Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) was obviously having an affair with Sarah's husband before the accident. Whether Sarah knows of this or not is up for interpretation.As the group of six descend into the cave we quickly learn that this is an unexplored hole. And when a cave-in happens, they're forced to find another way out. But with them in the caverns is something pale and insidious (think about the Morlocks from THE TIME MACHINE and you won't be far off). But are they really there? Is it possible that Sarah's had a meltdown and only imagined seeing these creatures?It isn't the question of Sarah's sanity that'll put you off The Descent, but rather the ho-hum attitude most will have after seeing the film. It just doesn't have any emotional impact. You don't care whether these gals live or get their stomachs ripped open.The filming is also very dark and it's often difficult to see what exactly is going on. Although caves are dark and difficult to see in, this doesn't necessarily translate well to an entertaining movie experience.Still, those with a fear of enclosed spaces will probably be pretty freaked out by The Descent. The claustrophobia is easily felt, and when you add to that some bizarre ghost-like creatures with Spiderman-like crawling abilities, some might find this a lightly entertaining creep-fest.",2,What's So Special About This Horror Flick Again?,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2493,"['Slasher', 'films', 'are', 'dime-a-dozen', 'HALLOWEEN', 'NIGHTMARE', 'ON', 'ELM', 'STREET', 'list', 'lengthy', 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'send', 'goose', 'bumps', 'up', 'backs', 'Others', 'tread', 'old', 'material', 'put', 'fresh', 'spin', 'DESCENT', ""n't"", 'do', 'that.Comically', 'labeled', 'Six', 'Chicks', 'Picks', 'cave', 'exploration', 'thriller', 'obligatory', 'fright', 'scenes', 'know', 'kind', 'where', 'something', 'weird', 'suddenly', 'loudly', 'burst', 'screen', 'attractive', 'die-off', 'cast', 'themes', 'trodden', 'time', 'again', 'ALIENS', 'horrible', 'film', 'THE', 'CAVE', 'reason', 'flick', 'gotten', 'several', 'positive', 'reviews', 'professional', 'film', 'critics', 'fail', 'see', 'why', 'nothing', 'original', 'Nothing', 'lingers', 'watching', 'truly', 'memorable', 'cast', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'Sarah', 'Shauna', 'Mcdonald', 'main', 'character', 'rammed', 'throats', 'husband', 'head', 'when', 'car', 'accident', 'Sarah', 'family', 'year', 'later', 'group', 'girlfriends', 'get', 'together', 'go', 'spelunking', 'try', 'heal', 'wounds', 'left', 'death', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'child', 'touch', 'deceit', 'going', 'Juno', 'Natalie', 'Jackson', 'Mendoza', 'was', 'obviously', 'having', 'affair', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'accident', 'Whether', 'Sarah', 'not', 'up', 'interpretation.As', 'group', 'six', 'descend', 'cave', 'quickly', 'learn', 'unexplored', 'hole', 'when', 'cave-in', ""'re"", 'forced', 'find', 'way', 'caverns', 'something', 'pale', 'insidious', 'think', 'Morlocks', 'THE', 'TIME', 'MACHINE', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'far', 'off', 'are', 'really', 'possible', 'Sarah', 'had', 'meltdown', 'only', 'imagined', 'seeing', 'creatures', ""n't"", 'question', 'Sarah', 'sanity', ""'ll"", 'put', 'off', 'Descent', 'rather', 'ho-hum', 'attitude', 'most', 'will', 'have', 'seeing', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'gals', 'live', 'get', 'stomachs', 'ripped', 'open.The', 'filming', 'also', 'very', 'dark', 'often', 'difficult', 'see', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'caves', 'are', 'dark', 'difficult', 'see', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'translate', 'well', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'experience.Still', 'fear', 'enclosed', 'spaces', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'pretty', 'freaked', 'out', 'Descent', 'claustrophobia', 'easily', 'felt', 'when', 'add', 'bizarre', 'ghost-like', 'creatures', 'Spiderman-like', 'crawling', 'abilities', 'might', 'find', 'lightly', 'entertaining', 'creep-fest']","Descent,the Version anglais"

(like gee I dunno just about every horror movie made in the last 5 years including the garbage, mindless gore flicks exploiting the success of the overhyped SAW)The acting is solid for the most part, which is also a huge positive characteristic of the film  since there are no ""big stars"" to anchor the film- which is completely attributal to a solid script, storyline, and character development/ representation.  There is at least one actress whose character seems a bit cheesey and exagerated as some sort of adrenaline junky but then again I used to skydive so Im used to cheesey stereotypes of ""thrill-seekers"", or whatever that is supposed to mean.Another favorable attribute of the film, at least to myself, is that there is no happy, low-risk-cheesey-gutless-Hollywood-ending. The people responsible for creating this film have guts.Lots of typical horror movie cliches to satisfy fans of the genre- atmospheric and creepy colored lighting and intelligent use of the dark, roller coaster tension rides, impressive score, and what appears to be somehwat of a homage to the Shining (or not) in some of the heli shot environmnet scenes in the begining with similar foreboding music.I know many modern horror fans out there like the gore and blood but I was actually turned off by the amount which I felt dumbed down the film (I only had the option of watching the unrated) but then again I was raised on Halloween, The Shining, Jaws, a little of Friday the 13th, the Excorcist, etc. back in the day.Im not sure if this film will translate to broader success outside of the horror fanbase as I still think there is too much gore for something along the lines of a film like Aliens to become a hybrid hit but fans of the genre should eagerly attempt to see this film.",4,As good as the hype.,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,2423,"['reading', 'hearing', 'exorbitant', 'amount', 'hype', 'Descent', 'was', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'was', 'anything', 'but.As', 'reviewer', 'posted', 'movie', 'not', 'reinventing', 'wheel', 'rather', 'great', 'job', 'displaying', 'wheel', 'different', 'refreshing', 'way', '.for', 'example', 'actresses', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'going', 'be', 'nominated', 'academy', 'award', 'first', 'horror', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'long', 'time', 'where', 'actions', 'are', 'fairly', 'believable', 'not', 'once', 'movie', 'did', 'say', 'myself/', 'yell', 'screen', 'dont', 'do', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'idiot', 'gee', 'dunno', 'just', 'about', 'horror', 'movie', 'made', 'last', '5', 'years', 'including', 'garbage', 'mindless', 'gore', 'flicks', 'exploiting', 'success', 'overhyped', 'SAW', 'acting', 'solid', 'most', 'part', 'also', 'huge', 'positive', 'characteristic', 'film', 'are', 'big', 'stars', 'anchor', 'film-', 'completely', 'attributal', 'solid', 'script', 'storyline', 'character', 'development/', 'representation', 'least', 'one', 'actress', 'character', 'bit', 'cheesey', 'exagerated', 'sort', 'adrenaline', 'junky', 'then', 'again', 'used', 'skydive', 'so', 'Im', 'used', 'cheesey', 'stereotypes', 'thrill-seekers', 'whatever', 'supposed', 'mean.Another', 'favorable', 'attribute', 'film', 'least', 'myself', 'happy', 'low-risk-cheesey-gutless-Hollywood-ending', 'people', 'responsible', 'creating', 'film', 'have', 'guts.Lots', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'cliches', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'genre-', 'atmospheric', 'creepy', 'colored', 'lighting', 'intelligent', 'use', 'dark', 'roller', 'coaster', 'tension', 'rides', 'impressive', 'score', 'what', 'be', 'somehwat', 'homage', 'Shining', 'not', 'heli', 'shot', 'environmnet', 'scenes', 'begining', 'similar', 'foreboding', 'music.I', 'know', 'many', 'modern', 'horror', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'gore', 'blood', 'was', 'actually', 'turned', 'off', 'amount', 'felt', 'dumbed', 'film', 'only', 'had', 'option', 'watching', 'unrated', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'raised', 'Halloween', 'Shining', 'Jaws', 'little', 'Friday', '13th', 'Excorcist', 'etc', 'back', 'day.Im', 'not', 'sure', 'film', 'will', 'translate', 'broader', 'success', 'horror', 'fanbase', 'still', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'gore', 'something', 'lines', 'film', 'Aliens', 'become', 'hybrid', 'hit', 'fans', 'genre', 'should', 'eagerly', 'attempt', 'see', 'film']","Descent,the Version anglais"

We have six women unknowingly going off into uncharted caves thanks to their egotistic leader who decides the map book isn't necessary.  Throw in the predictable rockslide which traps them inside a cave infested with half human blood thirsty creatures and we watch as the women get devoured.  However, before this happens we have to sit through a good 40 minutes of character development and cheap scares.  BOO! Someone jumps out at someone else and laughs.  BAM! A swarm of bats rush out of a cave.  BOING! A pipe bursts through a window, skewering someone but wait they wake up and it's just a dream.  The soundtrack was annoying and absolutely inappropriate, rising string sections and orchestrations do not set a creepy or scary mood and the tragic accident in the beginning really had nothing to do with the overall story.  It was a cheap way to throw in some blood and set up the fact that one character was sleeping with the others husband (which explains what she does in the end) but was it necessary? No, and don't worry this little snippet of information does not ruin the movie in anyway, shape or form. It succeeds in doing that on its own. The Descent is rife with clich&eacute;s (I saw the end coming a mile away), inconsistencies and improbabilities.

923954,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B000A8NZ0O,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 0]","""The Descent"" features some relative rarities in horror film.  We have all-female cast, whose names we actually learn early in the movie.  And the women are competent human beings, by and large, who are not present in the movie solely to trip, fall and get rescued by men.  The cast can act, again something that is not altogether common in the genre.  And the film is shot beautifully, both outside and inside the cave.  Undoubtedly the cave was shot on a soundstage with entire walls of the cave chamber missing, but you really get an idea of claustrophobia.  It's hard to effectively light a movie that is supposed to take place underground without making it look harsh, or providing too much ambient light, but the lighting people succeed admirably.However, the ending is a cheat, as far as I'm concerned, and knocks a star off what I would have given it otherwise.  I won't spoil it for you.  Maybe you'll like it, but I thought it really invalidated most of the film.  In some respects, ""The Descent"" is similar to ""Silent Hill"" - another horror movie with female protagonists, gorgeous cinematography, good acting, but script and ending problems.

It truly amazes me to therefore read so many negative reviews that accuse Neil Marshall of the same pratfalls when, in all honesty, he has crafted a film that so very clearly goes against the shopworn grain.When I initially caught ""The Descent"" two years ago in Los Angeles, I was immediately enamored by the straightforwardly grim approach to the material. There was, much to my immediate relief, no unnecessary humor, cheesy one-liners, or MTV Top-40 soundtrack to be found anywhere. And the characters, contrary to some rather recent and incredibly erroneous claims, were not underdeveloped. Marshall fleshed each of these six women out just well enough to make me want to invest in their fates. I bought into their interpersonal relationships and I think that, along with the admittedly unapologetic bloodshed that was called for within the screenplay, actually helped elevate this film to a higher echelon.When I consider the watered-down PG-13 dreck, such as the fairly new ""Prom Night"" remake, that Hollywood lately seems to revel in cranking out assembly-line style, it makes savoring rare diamonds-in-the-rough like ""The Descent"" all the more enjoyable. This is a horror film that truly deserves to be called horror.

Most are simply ok, an occasional one is truly good, and most are crap.  This movie sadly falls into the latter camp.Borrowing from HP Lovecraft's ""The Beast in the Cave"" et al, a bunch of pretty stupid women go into a cave and are annihilated by said stupidity.  That part is at least satisfying.  The ride there is veritable torture to the viewer however.  The following modern horror movie rules are strictly adhered to :- Whatever rational normal people do in a given situation, these people do the exact opposite leading them headlong into the horrible situation they got themselves into- All characters except one will be victims of their own insecurities such that their actions can only be kneejerk responses along a linear path inevitably killing them.  EG - the tough girl has to prove she's tough leading her to her eventual death- The monsters will move silently right up to the person until the view shifts towards them, crook their head, then will shriek loudly, and kill the person in view.  They will also move inhumanly fast in ways that defy anything in nature, forgetting billions of years of evolution and the way predators in nature actually hunt- All characters will die except the one that suffered some sort of trauma early into the movie which causes deep soul-searching and a more grounded approach to the situation they end up in- That very same character will start out as a meek wallflower and will become the ""true bada__"" by the end of the film- The plotline serves as a cautionary tale against stupid people doing things to prove how ""bad"" they are.  It's really a cautionary tale against stupidity in generalI give this film a single extra star for the following aspects : Decent acting, ok cinematography, good makeup work on the monsters.  Other than that?  Pass on this tripe.

I don't like weird guess what happened endings. Better yet I like at least one person to survive any horror movies. To me that gives reason to have some hope during the whole horror of what the group endures. This ending made it look like no one survived, and a couple of people did the unforgivable crippling of others. One accidentally but one on purpose because of jealousy. At any rate that I can stomach. I just think at least one should have escaped the cave. Making a dream sequence like one did is clever, but not the answer.

923960,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000A8NZ0O,Carl Manes,"[2, 3]","Neil Marshall comes through for English horror again with the best genre film of 2005! A group of friends enter an uncharted cave, but after a collapse, they are forced to struggle through the serpentine passageways to find daylight. Too bad they aren't alone.. The craftsmanship implored in the careful writing and making of this film is unmatched in recent horror, and Marshall is able to make the first half of the film (completely devoid of monsters) even more terrifying than the climax. Gut-wrenching scenes of claustrophobic cave crawling, the unseen in the dark, and protruding bones are just a few of the universal fears that are tapped into, creating an immediate emotional bond between the characters and the audience. The women may not be given complete back stories, but what works is that they are portrayed as real people. In what situation in real life are we given flashbacks or do we commonly reveal our personal histories in our daily dialog? Rather, Marshall has written distinct cadences and personalities that distinguish a group of individuals rather than a group of talking heads.Then, there are the monsters. By the time the cave dwellers enter the film, it is already established as a terrifying and successful feature, but the vicious Gollum-like monsters in the film heighten the tension and fear to a whole other level. Though I typically despise surprise scares, Marshall has perfectly timed reveals for the creatures to scare the piss out of the audience. Though humanoid, they have regressed into bat like creatures hunting by sound, which makes for creepy visuals and allows the characters a plausible advantage in attempting to fight them off and escape. As the title implies, the film is not just a descent into the cave, as a surface level reading might suggest, but also a descent into madness for several of the characters, pushed to the brink of sanity at the thought of being trapped and having to fight for their lives against the impending foes. Our lead heroine, Sarah, takes control and makes a fighting effort, leading to tons of monster bloodshed which are handled with fantastic FX and gore.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,The Descent,1268006400,"03 8, 2010",2010,2169,"['Neil', 'Marshall', 'English', 'horror', 'again', 'best', 'genre', 'film', '2005', 'group', 'friends', 'enter', 'uncharted', 'cave', 'collapse', 'are', 'forced', 'struggle', 'serpentine', 'find', 'daylight', 'bad', 'are', ""n't"", 'alone..', 'craftsmanship', 'implored', 'careful', 'writing', 'making', 'film', 'unmatched', 'recent', 'horror', 'Marshall', 'able', 'make', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'completely', 'devoid', 'monsters', 'even', 'more', 'terrifying', 'climax', 'Gut-wrenching', 'scenes', 'claustrophobic', 'cave', 'crawling', 'unseen', 'dark', 'protruding', 'bones', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'universal', 'fears', 'are', 'tapped', 'creating', 'immediate', 'emotional', 'bond', 'characters', 'audience', 'women', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'complete', 'back', 'stories', 'what', 'are', 'portrayed', 'real', 'people', 'what', 'situation', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'given', 'flashbacks', 'do', 'commonly', 'reveal', 'personal', 'histories', 'daily', 'dialog', 'Rather', 'Marshall', 'written', 'distinct', 'cadences', 'personalities', 'distinguish', 'group', 'individuals', 'rather', 'group', 'talking', 'heads.Then', 'are', 'monsters', 'time', 'cave', 'dwellers', 'enter', 'film', 'already', 'established', 'terrifying', 'successful', 'feature', 'vicious', 'Gollum-like', 'monsters', 'film', 'heighten', 'tension', 'fear', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'typically', 'despise', 'surprise', 'scares', 'Marshall', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'reveals', 'creatures', 'scare', 'piss', 'audience', 'humanoid', 'have', 'regressed', 'bat', 'creatures', 'hunting', 'sound', 'creepy', 'visuals', 'characters', 'plausible', 'advantage', 'attempting', 'fight', 'off', 'escape', 'title', 'implies', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'descent', 'cave', 'surface', 'level', 'reading', 'might', 'suggest', 'also', 'descent', 'madness', 'several', 'characters', 'pushed', 'brink', 'sanity', 'thought', 'being', 'trapped', 'having', 'fight', 'lives', 'impending', 'foes', 'lead', 'heroine', 'Sarah', 'control', 'fighting', 'effort', 'leading', 'tons', 'monster', 'bloodshed', 'are', 'handled', 'fantastic', 'FX', 'gore.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']","Descent,the Version anglais"

This movie delivered all that to us and more, its scary but not cheesy it has unknowns which is so rare nowadays to see a fresh face in a imaginative movie. it had an awesome story line, that was full of symoblism of course but not so blatant that you were rolling your eyes and saying ""okay, cave wombs, blood, rebirth i get it"" the movie also had great effects for a 6 million dollar budget, and I left feeling like I had a refreshing adrenaline horror filled enema, cleansing all the ""the saws, the grudges, the rings, the darkwaters, etc"" out of my system.

So, with her friend Beth, she travels to the US to meet up with 4 American friends, led by the fearless Juno, deep into the Appalachian Mountains Juno has promised them a level 2 adventure; nothing too trying.

Go where you should not go, fail to leave the land untouched, and it will fight back. It shows us a parallel line of evolution, humans that went below ground and took a different path than us. But it is also a classic kill-them-one-by-one film, where those who make mistakes are marked for death.

923966,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000A8NZ0O,Chris Pandolfi,"[14, 19]","Because horror movies have effectively been told in a number of ways, it's difficult to determine exactly which elements are needed in order for them to be good. I began thinking about this after seeing ""The Descent,"" a high-tension roller coaster ride that left me more puzzled than exhilarated. This was an incredibly unstable film, lost within a maze of unfinished ideas. It reminded me of a misguided three-act play, each act characterized by wild shifts in storytelling methods. Yes, certain parts worked in and of themselves, but when put together, it turned into a chaotic, messy film.The first act is grounded in humanity (and I mean that in more ways than one), focusing solely on the interactions between six female rock-climbing enthusiasts. Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), Juno (Natalie Mendoza), Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) gather in a remote area of the Appalachian Mountains one year after Sarah lost her husband and daughter in a car crash. While she's understandably still upset over the whole incident, she's willing to rejoin the group and have a little adventure.The second act is the psychological portion of the story. While Juno's personality isn't fully developed, it can safely be assumed that she's the more reckless, ego-driven one. At one point she says something to the effect of, ""If there's no risk, why bother?"" This is apparently the motto she lives by, and because of that, she convinces the others that they should all explore a network of tourist-friendly caves hidden deep beneath the mountains. What she neglects to tell them is that they're actually going into an unexplored area, one she hopes they can claim as their own. Once they enter, they quickly learn that they're in a very unpredictable environment; they encounter pitch darkness, deep pits, unstable ledges, and narrow passages that could collapse at any moment. All of these scenes are tense, bringing on bursts of panic, blame, and uncertainty. For a while, it becomes a matter of pulling themselves together if there's to be any hope of escape.It then becomes a matter of survival at any cost. That's because the third act begins, and it turns the film into a gory creature feature by introducing a pack of slimy, humanoid predators with carnivorous appetites. At this point, all traces of plot cohesion are lost; it would have been just as effective if the three acts were expanded, separated into their own stories, and released as individual films. I say this because each act was completely different in genre, tone, and style. By the time the creatures are brought into the story, crucial details suddenly become irrelevant. The biggest one concerns Sarah's daughter, Jessica (Molly Kayll). The audience is initially shown quite a few haunting visions that plague Sarah on a regular basis (such as birthday cakes and an impaled windshield). But they dwindle in frequency during the second act, and by the third act, they're completely gone.I guess the car crash and Jessica's death weren't as important as the filmmakers led us to believe they were. If anything, they were nothing more than filler material, meant to kill time before getting to the good parts of the story, the ones with scary creatures. It was as if the filmmakers were saying, ""Who cares about that old subplot? We now have monsters and blood to keep them entertained."" But if they wanted monsters and blood so badly, they probably should have created something that could support those elements for the entire film. It might not have been as compelling a story, but at least then we wouldn't have to waste our time investing in characters we didn't need to invest in.And then there's the ending, which left me unfairly baffled. I obviously can't describe it in detail, but I'll say this much: one of the characters makes a particularly drastic decision. It was a decision I didn't feel she needed to make; it was not only an unnecessary thing to do, it was also an amoral one. The scene was over the top in a bad way, making one feel as cheated as if they had been watching an anticlimactic plot twist. It would be wrong of me to say that I expected something more inspiring, but I definitely expected something more appropriate. It probably would have been a good thing to re-shoot the ending, even if the rest of the film's incompatible elements were left alone.Based on this assessment, it would seem that one of the necessary components for a good horror movie is consistency. ""The Descent"" can't decide what kind of film it wants to be, and that made it an especially mind-numbing experience. This isn't to say that it doesn't have its good points; it actually has quite a few of them, especially during the last half of the movie. Most of those scenes are hidden in shadow, leaving much of the imagery left to the audience's imagination. That's certainly an effective way of delivering scares; what's not seen is always more frightening than what is seen. I just wish it had been a cohesive journey, one that didn't rely on unnecessary shifts in plot and structure.It's a mystery why ads for ""The Descent"" included comparisons to Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" They're only fair to the smallest degree: in both movies, small groups of people are trapped in a confined area and stalked by an otherworldly being. They also both have that sense of panic and desperation about them, conveying the confusion and fear the characters are going through. But ""Alien"" was a much more carefully crafted film, it's intent never wavering, it's story consistently terrifying. ""The Descent"" only has moments of effectiveness, ones that unfortunately don't add up to very much. I give it credit for trying, though; the idea behind it was definitely a good one. It just needed to be in the hands of a more focused writer/director.",3,Descending into Terror,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,5848,"['horror', 'movies', 'have', 'effectively', 'been', 'told', 'number',

923970,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000A8NZ0O,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 6]","To be honest, I have no idea what gravitated me towards the Descent. I think it was because word of mouth was very kind to the film and someone mentioned that ""this is what the Cave wasn't: good"". Missing the chance to watch it in theatres thanks to shoddy management, I had to check out the film when it was released on DVD and despite all the hype I had of ""I have to see this movie"" it actually delivered for once and while it does slightly have the trapping of recent horror films, it's a quite exceptional, if not entirely original, horror movie but it's certainly a standout among the recent factory conveyor belt turnouts.Sarah and a group of friends are thrill seekers who are enjoying a white-water rafting trip but on the way back, Sarah gets in an accident which kills her husband and daughter. A year later, still grieving, she decides to get back into the game and go cave spelunking. So Sarah and her friends Juno, Sam, Rebecca, Beth and Holly go into a cave system that was actually uncharted and turns out there's a reason since something scary and threatening are in the caves looking for unfortunate travellers.In recent films like Hostel, Wolf Creek, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and prequel, even the Saw films, the emphasis as been on out-and-out carnage. Gore galore I guess you can say and there's a couple scenes where it does get gruesome but's not in a frat-boy giddyness where they're chuckling away while having an eyeball hanging from a socket. Instead the film is mainly played for atmosphere and tension for a good section of the film then the fit hits the shan and it becomes a battle movie where the creatures attack and even the girls put up a fight too. While it's easy to see where the film shifts gears (made notable by probably one of the most effective jump scares since Alien's chestburster or the Exorcist III's nurse scene). Speaking of which, hope you didn't watch the trailer since it's more effective if you never saw it.Scream in a way started this: it's been harder and harder to care for characters who get sliced or any other thing. Strangely I did find myself caring for the women that had to fight their way out. Maybe it's because the genuine opinion is that men can handle themselves so we're not as emphathic whereas with women, one casualty is one too many. As far as our ""other"" cast members, they are appropriately creepy and scary but in a weird way, they're on screen too much so the feeling of guy-in-a-suit syndrome pops up but luckily they're so effective you don't even bother thinking of it.The one fault people might find although personally I didn't mind is the length of time it takes before the creatures show up. We get extended pre-cave stuff, then cave travelling then having to figure how to get out THEN they show up.

923971,A2DB22MRLKXUT4,B000A8NZ0O,"Collin O'Donnell ""HAL 9000""","[0, 0]","In an age where the vast majority of horror films are mindless trash with minimal scares, The Descent can be remembered as an effectively executed and genuinely tense outing. The basic set-up is this: a group of brazen women go spelunking in an uncharted cave. For the first 45 or so minutes, the film focuses on the growing tension between the women and the anxiety they feel as things start to go wrong. Right around the 50 minute mark, The Descent takes a complete left turn and goes from being a human vs nature survival film to a human vs bloodthirsty cave-dweller vs nature survival film. The situation was already scary enough without the monsters, but they were just the icing on the cake. Because the odds are so overwhelmingly against the girls, it is a total thrill to watch them try to survive and find their way back to the surface. Talk about gross-looking monsters! These 'crawlers' are thankfully not CGI and it allegedly took about three-and-a-half hours to apply the necessary makeup to the actors playing them. The choice of making the cast fully female is one that boosted the intensity in an interesting way. If it were mixed gender, there would probably be unnecessary sexual/relationship drama. If it were all-male, the film would lack heart and would become a bastardized version of Deliverance. With all women, it's just more fun to watch the transformation from sensitive young girls to savages. The contrast is stunning. The Descent was filmed in a very disorienting way which added much to the audiences terror. In many scenes where a girl is dangling on a rope over a bottomless pit, the camera will turn and maneuver in ways that cause the viewer to lose track of exactly what it is happening onscreen. And for a movie that takes place almost entirely in a cave, the minimal lighting is perfect for the atmosphere. The score is also terrifying, weaving through silent patches into loud, bombastic violins, horns, and drums. So far, the review has been nothing but the film's good qualities, which is not to say The Descent doesn't have its flaws. First off, its suffers from overly familiar horror territory, like characters making almost unbelievably dumb decisions. Like going into an uncharted cave for starters. The transition at the 50-minute mark isn't quite as smooth as it could have been. It happens rather abruptly when the movie is already suitably scary. Sarah's decision to stab Juno in the leg to avenge Beth's murder was dumb for multiple reasons. They could have helped each other escape and Beth should have mentioned to Sarah that Juno had only accidentally stabbed her in the throat. The little dream sequence at the end was also an unsatisfying cop-out to an otherwise above-average horror film. So The Descent had its ups and downs, but thankfully far more ups than downs.",4,The Gilmore Girls Get Trapped In The Wrong Cave,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,2823,"['age', 'where', 'vast', 'majority', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'mindless', 'trash', 'minimal', 'scares', 'Descent', 'can', 'be', 'remembered', 'effectively', 'executed', 'genuinely', 'tense', 'outing', 'basic', 'set-up', 'group', 'brazen', 'women', 'go', 'spelunking', 'uncharted', 'cave', 'first', '45', 'so', 'minutes', 'film', 'growing', 'tension', 'women', 'anxiety', 'feel', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'Right', '50', 'minute', 'mark', 'Descent', 'complete', 'left', 'turn', 'being', 'human', 'vs', 'nature', 'survival', 'film', 'human', 'vs', 'bloodthirsty', 'cave-dweller', 'vs', 'nature', 'survival', 'film', 'situation', 'was', 'already', 'scary', 'enough', 'monsters', 'were', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'odds', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'girls', 'total', 'thrill', 'watch', 'try', 'survive', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'surface', 'Talk', 'gross-looking', 'monsters', ""'crawlers"", 'are', 'thankfully', 'not', 'CGI', 'allegedly', 'took', 'three-and-a-half', 'hours', 'apply', 'necessary', 'makeup', 'actors', 'playing', 'choice', 'making', 'cast', 'fully', 'female', 'one', 'boosted', 'intensity', 'interesting', 'way', 'were', 'mixed', 'gender', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'sexual/relationship', 'drama', 'were', 'all-male', 'film', 'would', 'lack', 'heart', 'would', 'become', 'bastardized', 'version', 'Deliverance', 'women', 'just', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'transformation', 'sensitive', 'young', 'girls', 'savages', 'contrast', 'stunning', 'Descent', 'was', 'filmed', 'very', 'disorienting', 'way', 'added', 'much', 'audiences', 'terror', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'girl', 'dangling', 'rope', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'camera', 'will', 'turn', 'maneuver', 'ways', 'cause', 'viewer', 'lose', 'track', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'onscreen', 'movie', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'cave', 'minimal', 'lighting', 'perfect', 'atmosphere', 'score', 'also', 'terrifying', 'weaving', 'silent', 'patches', 'loud', 'bombastic', 'violins', 'horns', 'drums', 'So', 'far', 'review', 'been', 'nothing', 'film', 'good', 'qualities', 'not', 'say', 'Descent', ""n't"", 'have', 'flaws', 'First', 'off', 'suffers', 'overly', 'familiar', 'horror', 'territory', 'characters', 'making', 'almost', 'unbelievably', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'going', 'uncharted', 'cave', 'starters', 'transition', '50-minute', 'mark', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'smooth', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'when', 'movie', 'already', 'suitably', 'scary', 'Sarah', 'decision', 'stab', 'Juno', 'leg', 'avenge', 'Beth', 'murder', 'was', 'dumb', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'other', 'escape', 'Beth', 'should', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Sarah', 'Juno', 'had', 'only', 'accidentally', 'stabbed', 'throat', 'little', 'dream', 'sequence', 'end', 'was', 'also', 'unsatisfying', 'cop-out', 'otherwise', 'above-average', 'horror', 'film', 'Descent', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'thankfully', 'far', 'more', 'ups', 'downs']","Descent,the Version anglais"

923976,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000A8NZ0O,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[1, 2]","When walking into the theater Friday night I had high expectations. This film has been hyped up by critics of all people as one of the scariest films in the past years and that to me says a lot. I've been so disappointed lately with the slump in genuine horror films that I had all but given up in really finding a worthy scare...that was until I heard about 'The Descent'. Granted, there have been horror films of late that have proven to be watchable, to be intense and at times, yes even a little scary, but nothing that had my skin crawling. I wanted to feel trapped, helpless and alone. I can honestly say that throughout the majority of this film that is how I felt, even though the theater was packed and my brother was sitting right next to me.'The Descent' centers on a group of women who enjoy pushing themselves to the limit. The movie opens with three of them, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Beth (Alex Reid) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza) rafting down some rapids while Sarah's husband and daughter watch in amazement. These girls are fearless...until tragedy strikes in the form of a freak accident that takes the life of Sarah's family. A year later the three girls meet again for their yearly adventure, this time in the Appellation Mountains for some caving. They meet up with three other girls, sisters Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and new addition Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), all of whom we have a few minutes to get to know, and then they're off. Juno is the leader of the group, she called the group together for their adventure and she serves as their guide. The only problem is she's not much of a guide being that she doesn't know the cave's they enter.Soon after entering these unknown, uncharted and undiscovered caves the girls become trapped when their point of entry caves in. Without a map these girls have to find their way out, find another exit by burrowing deeper into the cave. This fills the viewer with a sense of claustrophobia that doesn't go away until the credits role. The monsters haven't even shown up and you're already on edge. Everything around these girls is foreign to them, is a potential danger. They are forced to push themselves as far as they can go, to the point of wanting to give up for everything looks helpless. The viewer is also forced to feel this way. I had what I wanted. I felt trapped as they did, I felt helpless as they did, and once the creatures show up, and in a rush of panic the girls separate...I felt alone as they did.From the moment the crawlers show up the movie takes a frantic turn from increasingly creepy and atmospheric to intense and horrific as these girls fight to survive, let alone escape. As intentions are revealed between the girls it also makes things all the more horrifying for you don't know who to trust. If you can't trust anyone then you truly are alone. The pace doesn't let up once the creatures are on the screen, and your heart won't stop racing either. As some of the critics have pointed out, this is a truly horrific film with images that won't leave you anytime soon, and yes, while I was able to sleep alright and didn't toss and turn in fear I was haunted by what I saw. This is not a film for the squeamish, that's a fact not an opinion. Neil Marshall did a brilliant job directing this film, giving it the raw edge that true horror films need, giving it not only jump scenes with blood and gore but building a layer, a foundation of fear before the first drop of blood is shed. And the actresses need to be commended for proving to be believable as well as likable, never 'over-acting' but giving us the feel that this is really happening and that these women are really that petrified (as I'm sure even the manliest of men would be in that given situation). Amazing job all the way around without much of a single drawback.I do say 'without much' and I only say that because of the ending. Now I've seen the US version so I can't speak for the UK version that has a different ending I hear. The US ending, while not horrible, leaves you wondering what is really going on. I have my ideas, that of which I won't share so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it reminded me a bit of the way I felt after watching 'The Ring'. The only drawback to that film was that the ending didn't answer any of our questions, it just added to the confusion. I felt that way after watching 'The Descent'...confused...but it's not really enough to harp on. The movie does enough redeeming work BEFORE the ending that it's easily forgiven.",5,How horror should be!,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,4547,"['When', 'walking', 'theater', 'Friday', 'night', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'film', 'been', 'hyped', 'up', 'critics', 'people', 'one', 'scariest', 'films', 'past', 'years', 'lot', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'disappointed', 'lately', 'slump', 'genuine', 'horror', 'films', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'really', 'finding', 'worthy', 'scare', 'was', 'heard', ""'The"", 'Descent', 'Granted', 'have', 'been', 'horror', 'films', 'late', 'have', 'proven', 'be', 'watchable', 'be', 'intense', 'times', 'yes', 'even', 'little', 'scary', 'nothing', 'had', 'skin', 'crawling', 'wanted', 'feel', 'trapped', 'helpless', 'alone', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'majority', 'film', 'how', 'felt', 'even', 'theater', 'was', 'packed', 'brother', 'was', 'sitting', 'right', 'next', 'Descent', 'centers', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'enjoy', 'pushing', 'limit', 'movie', 'three', 'Sarah', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'Beth', 'Alex', 'Reid', 'Juno', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'rafting', 'down', 'rapids', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'daughter', 'watch', 'amazement', 'girls', 'are', 'fearless', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'form', 'freak', 'accident', 'life', 'Sarah', 'family', 'year', 'later', 'three', 'girls', 'meet', 'again', 'yearly', 'adventure', 'time', 'Appellation', 'Mountains', 'caving', 'meet', 'up', 'three', 'other', 'girls', 'sisters', 'Sam', 'MyAnna', 'Buring', 'Rebecca', 'Saskia', 'Mulder', 'new', 'addition', 'Holly', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'whom', 'have', 'few', 'minutes', 'get', 'know', 'then', ""'re"", 'off', 'Juno', 'leader', 'group', 'called', 'group', 'together', 'adventure', 'guide', 'only', 'problem', 'not', 'much', 'guide', 'being', ""n't"", 'know', 'cave', 'enter.Soon', 'entering', 'unknown', 'uncharted', 'undiscovered', 'caves', 'girls', 'become', 'trapped', 'when', 'point', 'entry', 'caves', 'map', 'girls', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'find', 'exit', 'burrowing', 'deeper', 'cave', 'viewer', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'credits', 'role', 'monsters', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'shown', 'up', ""'re"", 'already', 'edge', 'Everything', 'girls', 'foreign', 'potential', 'danger', 'are', 'forced', 'push', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'point', 'wanting', 'give', 'up', 'everything', 'helpless', 'viewer', 'also', 'forced', 'feel', 'way', 'had', 'what', 'wanted', 'felt', 'trapped', 'did', 'felt', 'helpless', 'did', 'once', 'creatures', 'show', 'up', 'rush', 'panic', 'girls', 'separate', 'felt', 'alone', 'did.From', 'moment', 'crawlers', 'show', 'up', 'movie', 'frantic', 'turn', 'increasingly', 'creepy', 'atmospheric', 'intense', 'horrific', 'girls', 'fight', 'survive', 'let', 'alone', 'escape', 'intentions', 'are', 'revealed', 'girls', 'also', 'things', 'more', 'horrifying', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'trust', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'anyone', 'then', 'truly', 'are', 'alone', 'pace', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'once', 'creatures', 'are', 'screen', 'heart', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'racing', 'either', 'critics', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'truly', 'horrific', 'film', 'images', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'anytime', 'soon', 'yes', 'was', 'able', 'sleep', 'alright', 'did', ""n't"", 'toss', 'turn', 'fear', 'was', 'haunted', 'what', 'saw', 'not', 'film', 'squeamish', 'fact', 'not', 'opinion', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'giving', 'raw', 'edge', 'true', 'horror', 'films', 'need', 'giving', 'not', 'only', 'jump', 'scenes', 'blood', 'gore', 'building', 'layer', 'foundation', 'fear', 'first', 'drop', 'blood', 'shed', 'actresses', 'need', 'be', 'commended', 'proving', 'be', 'believable', 'as', 'well', 'likable', 'never', ""'over-acting"", 'giving', 'feel', 'really', 'happening', 'women', 'are', 'really', 'petrified', ""'m"", 'sure', 'even', 'manliest', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'situation', 'Amazing', 'job', 'way', 'much', 'single', 'drawback.I', 'do', 'say', ""'without"", 'much', 'only', 'say', 'ending', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'US', 'version', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'UK', 'version', 'different', 'ending', 'hear', 'US', 'ending', 'not', 'horrible', 'wondering', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'have', 'ideas', 'wo', ""n't"", 'share', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'anything', 'will', 'say', 'reminded', 'bit', 'way', 'felt', 'watching', ""'The"", 'Ring', 'only', 'drawback', 'film', 'was', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'answer', 'questions', 'just', 'added', 'confusion', 'felt', 'way', 'watching', ""'The"", 'Descent', 'confused', 'not', 'really', 'enough', 'harp', 'movie', 'enough', 'redeeming', 'work', 'ending', 'easily', 'forgiven']","Descent,the Version anglais"
923977,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B000A8NZ0O,DanD,"[0, 2]","Six women go spelunking...and find flesh-eating beasties.Such is the basic gist of THE DESCENT.  The film is very-well done; the cast of relative unknowns are all believable and relatable, and writer/director Neil Marshall certainly knows what he's doing.  The atmosphere is prevalent and truly frightening; while the film isn't necessarily claustrophobic (maybe it is; I've never been very claustrophobic myself), it is certainly a ""close"" picture, thrusting you right in there with the characters as they go through this living hell.  You're on the edge of your seat the whole picture, never quite knowing what'll happen next, and it all leads up to a truly haunting finale.Then why the three stars?  Because it bugs the hell out of me whenever a movie shirks its potential greatness to become something less than what it is.  There is tremendous talent behind this film--the cast, the cinematography, the writing, the directing--which makes its shortcoming all the more regrettable.  The film's first half is fantastic--part Tarantino, part ""Alien.""  The cave system itself is terrifying, and the audience is frightened right alongside the cast.  And then...it becomes something of a zombie film set underground.  Not to say these creatures are zombies; but that's what they come off as--flesh-eating, fast-moving, blind (yet somehow with functioning eyes?) zombies.  It's a terrible shame; if there weren't so many of the creatures, or if the emphasis wasn't so fully upon them in the second half, their presence could be justified (if if there existence never truly is; there are a few hints as to their origins, but honestly, the film would have been more believable if the creatures' origins were left completely unspoken).Thus, THE DESCENT is a great film that winds up being only a mediocre one.  It's still a must-see for horror fans, as the first half of the movie especially is truly outstanding.  Certainly it's worth watching to reassure yourself that there is true talent working in the horror industry today, with a writer/director (and cast) who knows how to relate to you, to entertain you, and to terrify you.",3,"""Six Chicks with Picks""",1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2128,"['Six', 'women', 'go', 'spelunking', 'find', 'flesh-eating', 'beasties.Such', 'basic', 'gist', 'THE', 'DESCENT', 'film', 'very-well', 'done', 'cast', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'are', 'believable', 'relatable', 'writer/director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'certainly', 'what', 'doing', 'atmosphere', 'prevalent', 'truly', 'frightening', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'claustrophobic', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'very', 'claustrophobic', 'certainly', 'close', 'picture', 'thrusting', 'right', 'characters', 'go', 'living', 'hell', ""'re"", 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'picture', 'never', 'quite', 'knowing', 'what', ""'ll"", 'happen', 'next', 'up', 'truly', 'haunting', 'finale.Then', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'hell', 'whenever', 'movie', 'potential', 'greatness', 'become', 'something', 'less', 'what', 'tremendous', 'talent', 'film', 'cast', 'cinematography', 'writing', 'directing', 'shortcoming', 'more', 'regrettable', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'fantastic', 'part', 'Tarantino', 'part', 'Alien', 'cave', 'system', 'terrifying', 'audience', 'frightened', 'right', 'cast', 'then', 'something', 'zombie', 'film', 'set', 'underground', 'Not', 'say', 'creatures', 'are', 'zombies', 'what', 'come', 'off', 'flesh-eating', 'fast-moving', 'blind', 'yet', 'somehow', 'functioning', 'eyes', 'zombies', 'terrible', 'shame', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'many', 'creatures', 'emphasis', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'fully', 'second', 'half', 'presence', 'could', 'be', 'justified', 'existence', 'never', 'truly', 'are', 'few', 'hints', 'origins', 'honestly', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'creatures', 'origins', 'were', 'left', 'completely', 'unspoken', '.Thus', 'DESCENT', 'great', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'only', 'mediocre', 'one', 'still', 'must-see', 'horror', 'fans', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'especially', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'Certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'reassure', 'true', 'talent', 'working', 'horror', 'industry', 'today', 'writer/director', 'cast', 'who', 'how', 'relate', 'entertain', 'terrify']","Descent,the Version anglais"

Marsh,"[1, 2]","I'm not a horror film buff, but I know a great horror flick when I see one, and ""The Descent"" is probably the best entry in the genre in a very long time. Most movies of this type lose their ability to scare (me, anyway) by the second viewing. Not ""The Descent."" Feelings of claustrophobia, panic, disorientation and dread cropped up even when I watched this movie a third time.This is a combination adventure/monster movie. It's got all the physical action of an Indiana Jones flick (only played out by six women!), mixed with the gory shocks of the original Alien. Seemingly against the odds, director Neil Marshall succeeds beyond my wildest expectations. I cared about the characters, I was sickened, I was disturbed. What more can you ask from a movie about cavers going up against man-eating bat creatures?The cast is uniformly excellent. Marshall's direction is brilliant. The sets are completely convincing. The scares are well placed and effective. I never thought I'd say this, but I loved both endings. The cinematography and music are first-rate.What sticks in my mind most of all is the first encounter with the Crawlers. I won't give it away, but the reveal of the cannibal in the bone room is, quite simply, the most effective shock I've ever seen in a movie. Marshall places it at just the right moment, so that you never quite know when to expect it ... and then BANG!

923979,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000A8NZ0O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 2]","Truth be told, I should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and I think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively.  When this thing gets going, though, The Descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status, and on top of all the incredible special effects, oppressive atmosphere, and grievous bloodletting (made with a pretty limited budget, by the way), one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner.  Are you kidding me?  Blood, gore, a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn't believe - and subtlety?  How could I not give The Descent five stars?So you've got these young British women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky, extreme activity.  White water rafting, for example.  Everyone has fun, but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), forever.  Still recovering from her terrible loss, Sarah joins her friend Beth (Alex Reid) in America, where mutual friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza), an Alpha Female if there ever was one, has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored.  Joining in the fun are Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), Juno's new gung-ho sidekick, and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet.The movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the Appalachians (apparently somewhere in the North Carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the UK), then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure.  Once they descend into the cave system, though, things start getting more intense fairly quickly.  Their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal, especially for Sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses.  That's when Juno, a woman with more than her fair share of secrets, admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before, supposedly to help reunite the group.  Well, it does just the opposite, but they just have to keep going.  If there is a way out, they're going to have to find it the hard way.Things are already creepy enough at this point.  The filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets, making the viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters.  Just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight, dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic.  But the real fun was just about to begin.  In the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you'll ever want to squirm through, Sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them.  No one believes her - at first.  When the ""crawlers"" attack, though, all hell breaks loose two miles under ground.  These Gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind, albino humanoids who hunt by sound, can scamper and climb like monkeys, move unbelievably quickly, and really tear into whatever flesh they can find.  Not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves, the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light.  And when the girls fight back, it's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy, bloody, gruesome department.  And even as characters are fighting for their lives, a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher.The ending is a little controversial because American theatrical audiences didn't get to see the true final scene of the film, for some pretty questionable reasons.  A few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference.  Don't worry, though, as the DVD has both endings available.The Descent draws deeply from the well of man's most instinctual fears, making it one of the most atmospheric, heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while.  The subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between Sarah and Juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here.  The Descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that.  If you care the first thing about horror, you must see this atmospheric tour de force.",5,Draws deeply from the well of man's most instinctual fears,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,4435,"['Truth', 'be', 'told', 'should', 'probably', 'give', 'film', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'take', 'while', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'think', 'story', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'more', 'effectively', 'When', 'thing', 'going', 'though', 'Descent', 'easily', 'not-to-be-missed', 'status', 'top', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'grievous', 'bloodletting', 'made', 'pretty', 'limited', 'budget', 'way', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'story', 'actually', 'brought', 'home', 'impressively', 'subtle', 'manner', 'Are', 'kidding', 'Blood', 'gore', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'subtlety', 'How', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'Descent', 'five', 'stars', 'So', ""'ve"", 'got', 'young', 'British', 'women', 'who', 'like', 'get', 'together', 'once', 'year', 'engage', 'sort', 'risky', 'extreme', 'activity', 'White', 'water', 'rafting', 'example', 'Everyone', 'fun', 'then', 'horrible', 'automobile', 'accident', 'life', 'one', 'women', 'Sarah', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'forever', 'Still', 'recovering', 'terrible', 'loss', 'Sarah', 'friend', 'Beth', 'Alex', 'Reid', 'America', 'where', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Juno', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'Alpha', 'Female', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'staked', 'out', 'cave', 'system', 'just', 'begging', 'be', 'explored', 'Joining', 'fun', 'are', 'Holly', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'Juno', 'new', 'gung-ho', 'sidekick', 'couple', 'sisters', 'who', 'round', 'out', 'spelunking', 'sextet.The', 'movie', 'good', 'bit', 'sit', 'watch', 'girls', 'arrive', 'destination', 'Appalachians', 'apparently', 'somewhere', 'North', 'Carolina', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'UK', 'then', 'do', 'bonding', 'thing', 'night', 'big', 'adventure', 'descend', 'cave', 'system', 'though', 'things', 'start', 'getting', 'more', 'intense', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'first', 'real', 'move', 'down', 'complex', 'cave', 'structures', 'quite', 'tight', 'claustrophobic', 'ordeal', 'especially', 'Sarah', 'who', 'stuck', 'barely', 'pulled', 'safety', 'tunnel', 'when', 'Juno', 'woman', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'secrets', 'admits', 'led', 'girls', 'cave', 'system', 'never', 'been', 'explored', 'supposedly', 'help', 'reunite', 'group', 'Well', 'just', 'opposite', 'just', 'have', 'keep', 'going', 'way', 'out', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'find', 'hard', 'way.Things', 'are', 'already', 'creepy', 'enough', 'point', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'sets', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'he/she', 'trapped', 'real', 'cave', 'system', 'characters', 'Just', 'watching', 'girls', 'pull', 'bodies', 'extremely', 'tight', 'dark', 'spaces', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'darn', 'claustrophobic', 'real', 'fun', 'was', 'just', 'begin', 'wake', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'compound', 'leg', 'fracture', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'want', 'squirm', 'Sarah', 'spots', 'presence', 'someone', 'something', 'else', 'down', 'there', 'one', 'first', 'When', 'crawlers', 'attack', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'two', 'miles', 'ground', 'Gollum-like', 'creatures', 'are', 'kind', 'blind', 'albino', 'humanoids', 'who', 'hunt', 'sound', 'can', 'scamper', 'climb', 'monkeys', 'move', 'unbelievably', 'quickly', 'really', 'tear', 'flesh', 'can', 'find', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'frighteningly', 'impressive', 'filmmakers', 'present', 'most', 'effective', 'cinematic', 'light', 'when', 'girls', 'fight', 'back', 'cinematic', 'magic', 'filmmakers', 'hold', 'nothing', 'back', 'creepy', 'bloody', 'gruesome', 'department', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'fighting', 'lives', 'personal', 'bombshell', 'two', 'also', 'ratchet', 'up', 'frenetic', 'drama', 'level', 'even', 'higher.The', 'ending', 'little', 'controversial', 'American', 'theatrical', 'audiences', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'true', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'pretty', 'questionable', 'reasons', 'few', 'seconds', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'pretty', 'big', 'difference', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'though', 'DVD', 'endings', 'available.The', 'Descent', 'deeply', 'well', 'man', 'most', 'instinctual', 'fears', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'atmospheric', 'heart-pounding', 'movies', 'come', 'along', 'quite', 'while', 'subtlety', 'story', 'terms', 'relationship', 'Sarah', 'Juno', 'almost', 'as', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'work', 'even', 'room', 'alternate', 'explanation', 'everything', 'here', 'Descent', 'everything', 'could', 'ever', 'ask', 'horror', 'film', 'plenty', 'more', 'top', 'care', 'first', 'thing', 'horror', 'must', 'see', 'atmospheric', 'tour', 'force']","Descent,the Version anglais"
923980,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B000A8NZ0O,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[5, 11]","Or, ""Geez, is that what they mean by Post Partum Depression?'Neil marshall's spelunk-a-dunk with she-hunks gone terribly wrong has been favorably compared to Aliens, and in one sense it's easy to fathom why: you've got a strong female protagonist (actually, um, all the cavers are chicks, but onward), pitted in a deep, dark, confined space against a shadowy, hungry, and unrelenting Evil.That's about where the similarities end, aside from the hopes of the guys in Marketing---who evidently did their groundwork well & hit the beaches hard for Neil Marshall's follow-up to the blearily gory good-times slaughterfest ""Dog Soldiers"".Don't believe the Hype. Unless you're easily scared, ""Descent"" just isn't that big of a deal: basically a bunch of chicks go spelunking in a Big Deep Cave in the mountains of Appalachia, and have a great time getting in touch with their inner caving-chick until some flesh-eating troglodytes come along and start harshing the vibe.But let's back up a bit: Descent's reluctant heroine Sarah (Shauna MacDonald, who does what she has to do with reserve & a stiff upper lip) has had a nasty trauma: her husband and daughter were killed in what is possibly the coollest road accident I've ever seen translated to film, minutes after her group's last escapade: a white-water rafting expedition in Scotland, where she thought---glimpsed, a few scant, fleeting moments of sight enhanced by a woman's intuition---that something just might be going on between her husband and the group's Alpha Female, Juno (deliciously played by Natalie Jackson Mendosa, who can sink her pitons in my futon any time).Six months pass, and Sarah has to get back up on the horse, get back on that stallion girl, head back into the wilds with her former gang. She agrees to go caving with Juno & her caving buds, but none of the women fully grasp the enormity of the challenge against which Juno has pitted the team.They're about to find out.Now look: long before Mark Twain penned that nasty, creepy, claustrophobic chase sequences between Injun Joe & Tom & Becky in the caverns, good solid folks---folks like you, Gentle Reader!---have had a horror, a fair dose of squeam, when it comes to thinking about being trapped beneath the ground, caught, stuck, air running out, darkness flowing down over your face, your mouth, like a mask, a caul, a coffin.Brrrr.Marshall is a fine director when it comes to building up atmosphere, and just as he did in ""Dog Soldiers"", he builds it here in brilliant little snippets: an ancient climber's piton gouged into the rock, a mouldering miner's helmet left orphaned in the inky black, the chittering and chirruping of something well off in the Dark---just beyond the pass, the turn, the little shaft that curves off to the northeast.I was hooked until the first attack, until the first big creature reveal, and here Marshall falls on his own sword: he's great at building suspense, but lousy at delivering the goods. The cave-troglodytes, however awful---and they're awful, particularly the den-mother who comes sloshing across this swimming-hole of goop & blood and viscera to throttle Sarah---never can compare with what you imagine might be stalking these women, just out of eyeshot, nestled back in the inky black.Worse, once the big attack comes, it's clumsily shot & edited---lessening the tension, rather than ratcheting it up.Step back from the film a second, please: think about the vast, horrible, gigglingly-insanely scary potential of a group of women marooned in an unexplored cave-system, their retreat blocked, the way forward mined and menaced at every turn. Imagine how easy it would be to turn claustrophobia into terror with the tiniest of things: the shift of sand a few feet behind the group, the clatter of talons on an escarpment above---or below; a wilding chase miles below ground, where the Killer takes its time in killing its victim.And the darkest terror of all: don't these things need new flesh, new blood, to breed?I'm not saying you should avoid ""The Descent"". Not at all: in time, it might be one of my 'regrets'; those films I loathed at first, perhaps out of mood, and then came to relish (like I did, originally, with Marshall's ""Dog Soldiers"").But perhaps not: there is something missing here, some jubiliant, nasty, wicked horror frisson that I just didn't feel, that made ""The Descent"" more of a chore and far less than a pleasure.But view it another way and it does get interesting: what if Sarah suspected Juno of stealing her man from her, and made up her mind to seek revenge in those dark, unguessable depths.Now *that* would be a Descent---oh yes, indeed.JSG",2,"You've come a long way, Baby",1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,4645,"['Geez', 'what', 'mean', 'Post', 'Partum', 'Depression', 'marshall', 'spelunk-a-dunk', 'she-hunks',

923981,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000A8NZ0O,Daryl B,"[1, 2]","I'm a pretty recent convert to the horror genre, only coming to enjoy good horror films in the last three to four years. I could care less for films that feature naked teens running around and being slaughtered by the likes of Michael, Jason or Freddy.  To me, being scared by the darkness, what you can't see or what you can't explain, is much more frightening!  Give me ""The Others"" or ""The Ring"" anyday over Chucky and his ridiculous bride!  ""The Descent"" gives you that kind of fear (darkeness and the unknown) and does so on several levels.The story features six action lovin' gals who decided to go cave exploring in the Appalachian Mountains.  The alpha female, Juno, is an adrenline junkie and decides, without informing the others, that they will descend into an unexplored cave.  Her friend, Sarah, only a year earlier lost her husband and daughter in a terrible car accident and is still battling the emotional demons of that tragedy, perhaps using the trip as a way to move on, trying to distance herself from the pain of loss.  Holly, another adventurer, is quite reckless and also prone, like Juno, to a big adrenline rush.Once the women are inside, they are trapped by a rock fall and eventually become aware of underground creatures that see them as a walking meal.  The creatures are very creepy and the tight shots of the ladies spelunking and later trying to escape the cave dwellers will tie your stomach in knots.  The camera work is great, making you feel the claustrophobic horror that the women are experiencing and giving you only enough light to see the terror that is being inflicted upon them.  Add to that trust issues among the friends and personl problems that add to the drama and you have a lot of emotion and fear.The film takes a little while to get into but once in the cave, the suspense builds with each scene.  There is a lot of blood and gore, but it isn't overdone and only adds to the shock of what is happening to the team of spelunkers.

But let me begin by saying what a joyous thrill it was to finally watch a modern horror film that mangaged to be scary, suspenseful, disturbing and genuinely creepy. What an experience it was to see these women battle something so heinus, so imaginatively disturbing, so humanly wrong that my jaw was sore from holding my mouth open for 90 minutes. Don't waste your time thinking you'll know what is going to play out in this film because you will be dead wrong. The films disturbingly wondrous discoveries are part of its powerful impact.  And that's all I'll say about the great qualities this movie posesses.I enjoy the opportunity to ""remake"" a movie as to how I think it should have been made. So, let me start by saying that the beginning needs to go.  Movies need to land on their feet running, and to have us sludge through back story and needless character development is a waste of precious film time.  The movie should have started from the moment they decend into the cave.  A few hints and commments about their life stories and why they are all together could have been done during the cave exploration scenes.  Nevermind the overused explanation as to why they were on this trip to begin with (the tragic death of a loved one prompts the characters to go on a retreat to recouperate and deal with their grief). It simply doesn't matter. I also felt that there were too many characters.  I say this only because it grew rather confusing to keep track of who was who when certain characters were in peril. Throw in the darkness of the cave and it was even more confusing to identify who the victims were. Finally, I have to mention the AWFUL ending.  I won't reveal it but I will just say it deflates the incredible adrenline rush that the brilliant last hour of the film provides.",4,Suspenseful and Disturbing,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,1919,"['wanted', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'let', 'begin', 'saying', 'what', 'joyous', 'thrill', 'was', 'finally', 'watch', 'modern', 'horror', 'film', 'mangaged', 'be', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'disturbing', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'What', 'experience', 'was', 'see', 'women', 'battle', 'something', 'so', 'heinus', 'so', 'imaginatively', 'disturbing', 'so', 'humanly', 'wrong', 'jaw', 'was', 'sore', 'holding', 'mouth', 'open', '90', 'minutes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'play', 'out', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'wrong', 'films', 'disturbingly', 'wondrous', 'discoveries', 'are', 'part', 'powerful', 'impact', ""'ll"", 'say', 'great', 'qualities', 'movie', 'posesses.I', 'enjoy', 'opportunity', 'remake', 'movie', 'how', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'So', 'let', 'start', 'saying', 'beginning', 'go', 'Movies', 'need', 'land', 'feet', 'running', 'have', 'sludge', 'back', 'story', 'needless', 'character', 'development', 'waste', 'precious', 'film', 'time', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'moment', 'decend', 'cave', 'few', 'hints', 'commments', 'life', 'stories', 'why', 'are', 'together', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'cave', 'exploration', 'scenes', 'overused', 'explanation', 'why', 'were', 'trip', 'begin', 'tragic', 'death', 'loved', 'one', 'characters', 'go', 'retreat', 'recouperate', 'deal', 'grief', 'simply', ""n't"", 'matter', 'also', 'felt', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'say', 'only', 'grew', 'rather', 'confusing', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'when', 'certain', 'characters', 'were', 'peril', 'Throw', 'darkness', 'cave', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'identify', 'who', 'victims', 'were', 'Finally', 'have', 'mention', 'AWFUL', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'incredible', 'adrenline', 'rush', 'brilliant', 'last', 'hour', 'film']","Descent,the Version anglais"

Basically it's a Lifetime Cable movie that breaks out into the absurd (and it takes 45 minutes of its running 99 minutes to do so).  We have the women friends who are adventure seekers that results in a tragic accident and loss, and then the bonding and healing by seeking adventure again together only a year later (over many beers and idle small talk in a cabin -- perhaps a drunken lesbian love fest would have helped the movie at this juncture -- just kidding, okay, maybe not, because the film is that bad). The girls take due diligence in having all proper equipment for a spelunking trip and then not using it (such as Guide Books, or Ropes that connect one another when going through narrow passages).  After taking safety precautions for the trip they drive carelessly and at great speeds over muddy narrow mountain roads that could kill them all at the slightest spin-out (again, this is just the beginning of stupid) to get to their destination.  Of course, there are (scary, unexplained -- NOT!) animal carcasses, convenient cave-ins of centuries-old rock formations, equipment loss, classic convenient stupidity leading to injury and death, and feeble attempts at sudden frights, such as Bats shooting out of a rocky crevice (ooooh...scary!)  PURE LAMENESS!  Add to that, Golum (obviously he found a role for him and his family after LOTR), and his family's thirst for blood underground and the poor ""helpless"" girl victims are there for the taking.  On top of it all, the Golum-like creatures are blind, but only conveniently as well when the scene requires them to be blind.  UGH!!!

These films are entertaining enough, but eventually you feel like you're watching the same garbage over and over again. With that said, I didn't expect to be very impressed with The Descent, in spite of its excellent reviews. But I watched it anyway and I was very impressed. Instead of falling back on the same old settings and sadistic villains, The Descent opened up an entirely new and creative horror landscape. And the villains were more interesting and intriguing than your run of the mill axe-murderer. Another interesting aspect of the film was the professional nature and technical ability of the protagonists. It was nice to see a horror film in which all of the players were skilled and pretty tough. It was hard to pick out who would survive, because no single character stood out as the token slow, cowardly loser. There were a few shameless `BOO!' scenes in which one character `accidentally' scared another by sneaking up on her. But I guess if you're in a cave that probably happens.

Originality plays the biggest part of the film, pitting a group of females into the deepest of an unexplored cave in the Appalachian mountains.  The incredibly creepy monsters, utter darkness, and fantastic camera work add just as much too.Though it's the cave creatures that are supposed to give the Descent its extreme scary horror, I actually found the caves themselves to be just as horrifying.  This isn't too be watched lightly for those who suffer from clostrophobia.  Thumbs up to the director for making this come to life, giving us the feel of being right in the middle of the cave climbing action.  And I must not place too much emphasis on ""climbing"", for most of the time it seemed that there was more falling taking place.  The first half of the film focuses on the caving alone, but the horror already begins there as the group of ladies fine themselves lost, stuck, and even injured.When the monsters make their entrance it is truly frightening as well.  Because the cave is so dark, the only means of light for the girls are either their flashlights, lighters, or infrared via camcorder - which gives the film a Blair Witch Project feel at times too.  Thus also begins the complete bloodfest that this film goes into, with each monster making a mess out of one of the ladies or vice versa.  It becomes the ultimate means of survival - not only are the ladies trying to escape these creatures, but trying to find their way out of the caves as well.  And as an added bonus, there is even a bit of drama between some of the ladies, with an added twist.I expected much from this movie and that's what I got, even a bit more.  The monster scare and blood was just what I was expecting, but the camera work and sense of enclosed space was more than I had hoped.  This turned out to be a truly frightful experience, and each time I watch it always gets to me.

923992,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B000A8NZ0O,Dr. E,"[16, 33]","I wanted to like this film. How often do directors present their audience with an all-female cast ... let alone a cast of strong adventurous women? And the concept of using spelunking to create claustrophobia is fairly innovative (outer-space has become too common a choice ... with films as recent as Boyle'sSunshinetaking full advantage of its restrictions). And, I admittedly had to restart this DVD because I was grabbing a soda when only A MINUTE into the film, the gore began. Soooo,when I pushed the back button, I was convinced this film was going to shine ... unfortunately, it was tedious stretch of blackness (for me).Yes, this film does have several ""jump-out-of-your-skin"" moments; however, these types of thrills are short lived and fairly thoughtless. They become disappointingly predictable to the skilled viewer. And, there are occassional moments of tension (mostly as a result of good camera-work), but this is undermined by the poorly-crafted creatures (""real "" or not). The sub-par quality of these underground-predators pulls the viewer out of the film (even if the viewer believes these are strictly hallucinations). And while the gore is well rendered, the film is so saturated with blood that one quickly becomes desensitized.Unlike many of the negative reviews of this film, I did not mind the conclusion. I've never been fond of films that neatly tie the end in a pretty bow. And the last image is perhaps its best ... it almost worked on me ... almost. (Watch the DVD with the director commentary and you will hear Marshall say that he left it open-ended for viewer interpretation ... and a potential sequel ... so there is no need for a forced-read ... which, again, is a welcome move).Maybe the biggest ""sin"" this film committed was to present a group of strong female characters and then reduce the conflict to one of romance. Exhausting. And, frankly, the director tipped his hand too early. What should have been subtle was painfully overt ... and while I could not have predicted the relatively ""bizarre"" events of the films, I easily predicted the final confrontation in the first FORTY-FIVE seconds of the film.Hey, a lot of viewers like this film ... there has to be a reason for that. The concept is genuinely innovative and the director bravely granted his film what he knew might widely be considered an ""unpopular"" ending. I respect that. But on both a visceral and intellectual level, it did not hold my attention (at all). Nonetheless, just because it failed to (even partially) engage me, does not mean it will fail for you. I see its merits ... I just believe this film is deeply flawed.Give it a try and return here to share your thoughts! And prepare for The Descent II which is currently in pre-production.

923997,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B000A8NZ0O,Duane Thomas,"[2, 3]","There are two main problems with most horror movies: (1) they're not truly, deeply, get-in-your-guts-and-twist scary; (2) the characters/victims are portrayed so shallowly and/or unsympathetically you don't really care what happens to them. Neither of those shortcomings afflicts The Descent. Boy, don't they.The Descent tells the story of six friends, female adrenaline junkies all, who get together once a year for a different extreme sports adventure, always a different sport, always a different country. This year it's cave exploring in the United States' Appalachian mountains. When they're well underground a cave-in cuts them off, they must find a new way out. Eventually they discover there's....something else down there with them.That bare description of plot sounds like it could make a really cheesy horror film. Add that the six women are all played by relatively unknown actresses and the possibility of a groaner just gets better and better. However The Descent  doesn't even stop at ""bad"" and goes straight for ""excellent."" Script, direction, cinematography, acting, in this film are all top notch.This is easily the most truly frightening horror movie I've ever seen - and much of the scariest stuff occurs even before the monsters show up. (Not to give it away, but you **did** know that eventually there'd be monsters, right?) If you have any hint of claustrophobia in your system, some of the scenes of these terrified, lost women worming their way through pinprick, dead dark tunnels will literally make it hard for you to breathe. They did me.This movie does so many things right. For one thing, you ever notice how many horror films suffer from what I call the Idiot Syndrome, i.e. the people on-screen die because they do things only an idiot would? (I believe this is one of the primary appeals of a certain type of horror movie: we look at the idiots on-screen and feel good about ourselves by comparison. ""**I'd** never be that stupid."") I'm not saying that none of these characters ever makes a bad decision, or that cumulative stress doesn't eventually start to wear. But the women in The Descent are, by and large, smart, tough individuals who, once the horror starts, all, to a greater or lesser extent, stay smart, tough individuals. Call it Post-Feminist Horror if you like, all I know is that I find a movie about hard, competent people in trouble infinitely more appealing than a movie about weak, incompetent morons in trouble. (Okay, there is one character who's reckless to the point of stupidity, but ""rush in where angels fear to tread"" is a well-established trait of hers long before it turns around and bites her in the butt.)In addition to its nicely done horror, The Descent is an amazingly well-drawn psychological drama. All the women come across as believable, distinct personalities, all in some way likable and admirable, at least to start. You **care** what happens to these people. The Descent is, along with a very different movie, Phone Booth, probably the ultimate example of what I call an ""elevator movie"" (a term based on a series of movies all appearing within a short time period in the Seventies, about people trapped in elevators) where you put a bunch of people in an enclosed space so they can't get away from each other, ratchet up the stress level, then sit back to watch what happens. And, as is the case so many times in real life, in even the best of us we find that the monsters inside are even more frightening than the monsters without.Watch this movie.

In fact, it is probably one of the more original, well made horror films I've seen in a while.In the extras, it is mentioned that this film has elements of three horror greats combined into one; ""The Shining"", ""Alien"" and ""Deliverance"".  It's difficult to argue with that comment.  This film explores the effects of stress on the human psyche, an ensemble in the path of horrific danger in cramped confines and a catastrophic collision of cultures for 6 cocky thrill seekers.  All of this is accomplished with great flair.  For times sake let me break down some basic things to help you get a picture of what this film experience is like without retelling the plot/story...Lookout!! Here come the bullets!!THE FILM-If you have claustrophobia, please stay as far away from this as you can.  Any normal person will feel the pressure of the confining cave.  Imagine ""Aliens"" only twice as cramped.-I thought character development was great.  At first you're thinking; ""Oh that's the clich&eacute; sassy chic and that's the clich&eacute; tough chic and that's the clich&eacute; crazy chic... and so on.  However, as time passes and the stress level rises, you get to see deeper into these surface dwellers personalities.  No one is ever as simple as they seem at first sight.-The story would seam simple enough, yet its brilliance is in its subtleties.  Yes, the crux of the story is; 6 gal pals have an ill fated adventure into a cave and encounter more than geological danger. But you don't get a six person ensemble for the simple convenience of body count as is the case with many horror films. Nearly everything said or done leading up to the cave expedition has a point.-The set-up is fairly long.  It takes about one third of the films length to get things going.  In all fairness, none of the set-up could be considered pointless (as stated above).-The women's nemesis in the film (Cave Crawlers) is fairly realistic considering the circumstances of their existence.  They behave as one would expect for predators.  Their animalistic traits make them very unpredictable and frightening.  I actually had a slight empathy for them since the women were invading their home.  However, I empathized more with the women.  When it comes to survival; take no prisoners! (And the crawlers started it!)-There is ample gore in this film.  They don't show every horrific act, but when they do, they go all out.  Some of the gore is a bit gratuitous in its depiction... ...and highly appreciated!  The director does not shy away from lengthy and close gore shots.  This would be one of my minor criticisms of the film.  Those long gore shots were almost comedic and a bit out of place in what is mostly a very serious horror film.  I said ""almost"".  The graphic gore does serve to heighten the emotional state of the women..-Near the end of the film is a fairly large melee between the surviving women and the crawlers.  This is one great frenzied and desperate fight scene (much like the kitchen fight in ""Dog Soldiers"").  It brings the emotional state of the women to a clear apex and is just a really cool fight!  It is brilliantly edited and beautifully staged.-The music is purely functional.  It does not garner your attention yet serves to set mood and heighten tension.  What more could you ask for?-The sets are mostly rocks and tiny tunnels.  Very convincing.-The ending is not what appeared in theaters here in the States.  Thanks goodness!!  The ending as it appears here completely leaves it up to your imagination how things turn out.  I often have trouble with ambiguous endings but not here.  My fear is the sequel will take a stupid path instead of one of the cool ones in my head.  In fact, a sequel just might ruin this brilliant ending.THE DVD-2 discs for cheap, cheap, cheap!!!  (I have not yet watched disc 2).-Good picture and sound.-Ample extras with the standard fair plus outtakes and deleted cuts.No complaints.In summary:-You should like gory horror films.-You should have patience enough to endure ample character development.-You should not be claustrophobic.  This would be very, very bad for you.-You should be able to enjoy a movie without any male characters.-You should be able to live with an undefined end to the story.Of course these are only suggestions.  If any of the above does not apply to you, you may still enjoy it.  I thought it was a much better than average horror movie.",4,The Descent is better than Decent; It's nearly Great.,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,4942,"['put', 'off', 'buying', 'movie', 'long', 'time',

Her acting here is very good.  I felt just like she did...like she was running out of air and was going to die there.  The director successfully captured the panicky feeling of claustrophobic.The story is interesting (it deals with both betrayal and big egos) and really didn't need any cave creatures, IMO.  However, the cave creatures will appease those who crave gore (when these creatures attack, they attack ferociously) and for those who crave fast-paced action (when these creatures attack, they attack quickly and move fast).I like that these are strong women fighting in this movie.  When the creatures attack, these women fight back hard.What I didn't like about this movie was both the beginning and the ending.Although the very first scene is shocking, after that scene, it takes a long time before anything interesting happens.

Using all females in every lead role was certainly refreshing and I think it worked. As a whole, I think most movie lovers can't be frightened anymore, everything is used up, everything is wasted, tried, re-tried, tired, and regurgatated. That said, I wasn't scared with The Descent, and safe to say nor was I terriried in any aspect, but the movie delivers for stunning special effects. The scenes in the belly of carcasses and pools of blood and remains was truly remarkable and very finely done indeed. The monsters were keen, but not shrewd, nor new in any aspect. I wont give anything away if you are reading this, (and most likely you aren't), but the scene at the end had me actually sitting up rooting her on, jibbering and squiggling in my seat. That rarely has happened since seeing E.T. in the theatres when the bad men are chasing after Henry Thomas and friends on their BMX's.What really got me into the film, was really believing that I was actually crawling through the small chunnels with the broads, and for what it's worth, isn't that what cinema is supposed to do to us: transport us away from reality and into the surreal.On one other sidenote, A.

924013,A2EHCZQTCWVXPV,B000A8NZ0O,"Franz Escobar ""franzescobar""","[0, 0]","The Descent is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and it never loses its effect. It has great character development and special fx, is extremely suspenseful, and is downright scary for the most part. The acting is great, the storyline believable, and the characters themselves are very smart in that they are really tough women who make smart decisions. Also, if you are chlaustrophobic like me, this movie will really tap a nerve.The Descent is basically about a group of women who are thrill-seekers. They enjoy things like white river rafting and rock climbing, etc. On the way back from a river rafting trip, the main character is in a car accident that kills her husband and baby. Very gory. The film picks up a few years later when that same character is strong enough to join back with her friends for another adventure; this time cave exploration. This is where the character devlopment arc really begins and the movie really takes off.I found this movie to be very similar to the film ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" in that the first half of the movie is really different from the second half. In From Dusk Til Dawn, the first act is basically a hostage/run from the police/chase movie, while the second half is a vampire survival movie.In The Descent, the first half of the movie is basically about this group of girls getting lost in an underground cave and trying to find a way out. Very suspenceful, keeps you on the edge of your seat and is very realistic. As the movie progresses one almost forgets that the film is really about underground cannabilistic cave dwelling monsters. The first time you see these creatures is one of the scariest moments in a movie I can recall. I've watched this movie with several people, and they all JUMPED during this scene. It really is terrifying as is the majority of the movie.Once this happens, the girls realize they are surrounded by these creatures and all hell breaks loose. The rest of the film is basically about the girls fighting for their lives, with some twists thrown in. This film concludes with a great ending. I recommend The Descent with the highest praise possible. This is a must see! One of the greatest horror movies I've seen.

924018,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000A8NZ0O,General Zombie,"[7, 9]","The British horror industry seems to be coming back to life in recent years, and Neil Marshall's sophomore film ""The Descent"" is the latest impressive addition to the growing catalogue. Marshall previously directed the much, perhaps excessively, lauded ""Dog Soldiers"".  I thought ""Dog Soldiers"" was good, but not altogether remarkable, and ""The Descent"" is definitely a cut above that, and falls into the upper tier of horror films. Though ""Dog Soldiers"" wasn't quite a horror-comedy it was definitely a relatively lighthearted, fun and humorous horror movie, while ""The Descent"" is much darker and more serious. The setup, as in most horror movies, is exceedingly simple: A group of friends go on a caving expedition only to be assailed by a pack of carnivorous, subhuman monsters. This will doubtless cause many ignorant individuals to suppose that this film is a knockoff of ""The Cave"", but hopefully the superior quality and craftsmanship of the film will carry it during its American release. Either way, horror aficionados will know the score, and that Neil Marshall has clearly established himself as one of the most, probably the most, promising up and coming horror director of the new millennium.Marshall says, in interviews, that his prime inspiration for the film is the early 70's classic ""Deliverance"". This may seems a little strange at first glance, but they have a lot in common under the surface: Both focus on a group of friends who enjoy going on athletic, adventurous vacations only to find that they've now bitten off more than they can chew, facing dangers from both murderous individuals and the natural setting itself. Of course, replacing ""rafting"" and ""crazy rednecks"" with ""caving"" and ""monsters"" is a pretty substantial reworking, but it's not tough to believe that this is where Marshall got his main inspiration. In contrast to the all-male major cast of that film we've got an all female ensemble here. We've got 6 people here, perhaps a few too many to allow for much characterization of a couple of them. (i.e. Sam and Becca) Other then those two we've got Sarah, who is somewhat more timid and low-key then most of the others, partially due to the tragic accident which occurred during their last trip. Then we've got Juno, the one American and the authoritative leader of the group, and her reckless Irish protege Holly plus Sarah's best friend Beth. Again, we don't get to know all of these characters terribly well, since there is little time for characterization prior to their horrific adventure, but they at least aren't the obnoxious cliches you'd find in most horror films, and Marshall manages to create some real pain and sadness in their deaths.Technically the film is very accomplished, particularly for having a mere 6 million dollar budget. The widescreen cinematography is very nice, particularly in the aerial establishing shots, and they manage to keep it from getting to visually monotonous in the cave itself. The cave is a set, naturally, but it looks very good, though the effects do falter at a few points, particularly a CGI bat swarm, and a somewhat dubious cave-in. Acting is professional and convincing all around, though perhaps not that much is asked from some of them. I also really like the score. It's effectively varied, with some throbbing pulses along with roaring, shrieking and chaotic stuff all topped off by the very dramatic main theme.""The Descent"" uses an interesting, uncommon tactic: The film pretends like you are watching a completely different movie from the one you really are up until the point where things really fall apart. This isn't like in some horror films, where they just kinda sit around for an hour before the killing starts, as we've got an actual plot and conflict here: Shortly after entering the cave the entrance collapses, trapping them all inside a previously unexplored cavern which may or may not have another exit. Thus, they have to deal with a wide variety of concerns prior to the appearance of the monsters, including a gruesome compound fracture where they have to cram the bones back into her leg in order to splint it. There are relatively few hints that anything is actually going on prior to the appearance of the monsters, and I suspect that anyone who watched this completely blind and who wasn't paying a ton of attention may be in for a surprise.Once the crawlers show up things really get out of control, and the film is just this side of incoherent, as the various characters are separated, wandering around looking for each other, hiding, and fighting the crawlers etc.  A monster movie needs a good monster to work, and the Crawlers are quite cool. Not truly remarkable or anything, but nasty and gruesome enough to be effective, and their makeup is very good.  Needless to say this film is extremely dark, not so much that scenes are poorly lit, but that many portions of the screen are not lit at all, with nothing but flashlights to illuminate it.  At a few moments I literally could not tell what the hell was going on the first time I watched it, but these are rare enough that it's not too big of a problem.  One minor concern is that the characters are frequently extremely tough to tell apart in the later scenes, but honestly it doesn't really make that much of a difference who is who. Personally, I didn't really find this movie scary, but it is intense and severely watchable, which is just as good. That's another nice thing about the long, buildup, as that it allows Marshall to throw everything at us in the climactic 35 or so minutes, and the film is just unrelenting from the first encounter on.Many have claimed this film is old-fashioned, and while that it true in many ways, that isn't correct regarding the violent encounters, which are exceedingly modern, particularly reminding me of ""28 Days Later"". Here Marshall uses incredibly frantic editing, sometimes makes the movement haphazard and jerky by speeding up the action or cutting frames.  This sorta modern presenting it is risky, and many films like this are tiresome and incoherent, but they get it just right here, making it genuinely chaotic but maintaining coherence. I should also mention that the film is fairly gruesome. It doesn't linger on the gore, but there's plenty of spurting blood and flesh eating going on.  Furthermore, it's got genuinely brute, painful violence, not the over-the-top and silly bloodletting you'd see in lotsa gory movies.This DVD has restored the UK ending, and I've never felt strongly about it either way.  Neither ending is great, but they're both acceptable.  Ultimately, I think the US theatrical ending implies what's show in the UK one, so they're effectively identical.  As for the DVD itself, I haven't got much of an eye for this kinda thing, but the transfer looks good to me, and the Director/Cast commentary was fairly entertaining, if not overwhelmingly insightful.But all that aside this is just a great horror film. Definitely one of the best ones in recent memory, and mandatory viewing for any horror fan.Grade: A-",5,First-rate UK Horror,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,7066,"['British', 'horror', 'industry', 'be',

Having read so many favourable reviews of this film, I went in wanting to like it. However, try as I might, the film just didn't work for me. I could go into detail about all of the things that I don't like about this film, starting with the characters, who just didn't appeal to me, and finishing with the film's ending, which I found to be depressing. However, the biggest thing that I have against this film is the lighting or lack thereof. Think about it. This film is set deep inside a cave.

A few years ago the English speaking world was treated to the Ring and suddenly went crazy for Japanese films due to the whole 'more suspense less gore' aspect of the films.  Along came Grudge then along came Dark Water which (to steal the title of another film) was frankly ahem..a 'bridge too far'  People made a big thing about Saw but to be honest for all the pseudo intelligent nut case it was all done before in Seven (elaborate methods of murder to punish and teach the victim a lesson etc) The point is, this film should come as no surprise when you find it has little to offer.You can find almost the exact same format from the Hills Have Eyes down to Creep.  Group of normal folk go on holiday only to be killed off by lunatics, hillbillies, mutants, inbreds etc....That the film has an all female leading cast really had little effect on me (I guess with it being underground and in near darkness there wasn't any sexual aspect to it) and really I just didn't see any 'feminist' slant to the film nor did I see the monsters in this film as 'males' (Maybe there was some subliminal feminist motive to the film that was just lost on me)The film has all that is needed for a good night in watching a shock/horror/gore film.  Group of people hopelessly lost in tunnels and caves being picked off by blind monstrous looking things which do look like the character in the film Creep.  The body count mounts on both sides as the ladies use whatever weapons come to hand to fend off their attackers (to some good effect) so you will be treated to plenty of blood, plenty of cracked skulls, fair bit of eye gouging, a dash of entrails eating and a fair bit of blood squirts from gaping head wounds.Is this predicable?  Yes.  If you are looking for a horror film to make you think as well as scare you best look somewhere else.

924026,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B000A8NZ0O,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[1, 2]","This movie reminded me a lot of ""Wolf Creek"" It starts very conventional and boring in the beginning (aside from the death in the beginning) but then starts building up adrenaline as it progress. This film is far, far better (and has more surprises) than some of the lackluster flicks like ""Hills Have Eyes"", and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"". The man who directed it Neil Marshall hasn't directed a film in three years prior to this but, he showed no rust here.One thing that does stand out this flick from the other garbage (When A Stranger Calls another trash flick) is the fact that this is an all female cast. Think about that for a sec, there haven't been that many horror flicks with all female cast, well at least ones that haven't been this good.Reading some of Neil Marshall's interview on the film and his directing is also interesting. While he had planned to make the movie after ""Dog Soldiers"", nothing really happened. That might actually have been a good thing because he describes working through several drafts of the movie.  Having gone through so many, it's conceivable that the first draft may not have been developed as the product fans have seen.The great thing about this movie that sets apart the other garbage released this year is the fact that the characters in the movie are all sympathetic and well rounded. We give a crap about them. That's a key thing that many directors even the big ones miss many times.Shauna MacDonald and Natalie Mendoza who plays Sarah and Juno are absolute fantastic.  Natalie has acted in tv shows and movies, but this probably her leading role to date and she really carries this flick along with her co-stars. The story about the girls on a caving expedition is very simple, but once you see the terror that they deal with, both the creatures and terrain they are on, you see it's a very complicated script.As far as the endings for the flick, well I don't see them as a big deal. I figured out how things were going to turn after the accidental death of one of the girls. I wasn't disappointed at all in this flick. It has great acting, action, suspense and for a movie that had such a small budget , Neil really did a fantastic job.Anyhow, glad I finally saw it and I would recommend to others who still haven't seen it.",5,All around fun and scary.,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2292,"['movie', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'very', 'conventional', 'boring', 'beginning', 'aside', 'death', 'beginning', 'then', 'building', 'up', 'adrenaline', 'progress', 'film', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'surprises', 'lackluster', 'flicks', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Beginning', 'man', 'who', 'directed', 'Neil', 'Marshall', ""n't"", 'directed', 'film', 'three', 'years', 'prior', 'showed', 'rust', 'here.One', 'thing', 'stand', 'out', 'flick', 'other', 'garbage', 'When', 'A', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'trash', 'flick', 'fact', 'female', 'cast', 'Think', 'sec', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'many', 'horror', 'flicks', 'female', 'cast', 'well', 'least', 'ones', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'good.Reading', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'interview', 'film', 'directing', 'also', 'interesting', 'had', 'planned', 'make', 'movie', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'nothing', 'really', 'happened', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'thing', 'working', 'several', 'drafts', 'movie', 'Having', 'gone', 'so', 'many', 'conceivable', 'first', 'draft', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'developed', 'product', 'fans', 'have', 'seen.The', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'apart', 'other', 'garbage', 'released', 'year', 'fact', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'well', 'rounded', 'give', 'crap', 'key', 'thing', 'many', 'directors', 'even', 'big', 'ones', 'miss', 'many', 'times.Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'who', 'Sarah', 'Juno', 'are', 'absolute', 'fantastic', 'Natalie', 'acted', 'tv', 'shows', 'movies', 'probably', 'leading', 'role', 'date', 'really', 'flick', 'co-stars', 'story', 'girls', 'caving', 'expedition', 'very', 'simple', 'once', 'see', 'terror', 'deal', 'creatures', 'terrain', 'are', 'see', 'very', 'complicated', 'script.As', 'far', 'endings', 'flick', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'big', 'deal', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'turn', 'accidental', 'death', 'one', 'girls', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'flick', 'great', 'acting', 'action', 'suspense', 'movie', 'had', 'small', 'budget', 'Neil', 'really', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job.Anyhow', 'glad', 'finally', 'saw', 'would', 'recommend', 'others', 'who', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen']","Descent,the Version anglais"

What we fell into was one of the most frightening, thrilling horror films we had ever seen.And not horror in the classic blood and guts theme, although this movie has its fair share. This movie plays on you psychologically until you find yourself watching it with great unease, gripping your friend as you straddle the edge of your seat.This movie will make you understand what claustrophobia is all about. You will curse that damned cave for an hour straight, and when things start to really hit the fan, your heart will race for the remaining 40.Why is this movie clever? It presents an interesting study of human nature.  When you are caught in a life-or-death situation, how long does it take before people lose all convention of decency, and turn to their primal nature of survival?

Writer/Director Neil Marshall is to be commended for creating a first rate horror film that, for once, doesn't rely  on all the hacneyed tricks and CGI effects that have come down the pike in the last several years as well as utilizing cast of unknowns who also can't act to save their lives. This cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably. The score by David Julyan is the perfect accompaniment to Marshall's film and the cinematography and editing by Sam McCurdy and Jon Harris respectively combine to make this the true jewel of horror films.I normally don't purchase films of this ilk but after renting the film and getting the bejesus scared out of me I just had to own a copy.

924036,A1ZRO681DK4NC4,B000A8NZ0O,HorrorFilms101,"[9, 9]","So this was a rather interesting film. I'd say that it was probably one of the most enjoyable films that I've seen in recent weeks. It provided an interesting location, mind-bending ending, and a unique cast of all females that react reasonably in the face of danger. What else really made the grade for this film?Plot: Ok, so it's not the most original plot I've ever heard of. A bunch of girls go caving, and lurking in the darkness is an evolved human, evolved to live perfectly in the dark. Cavemen gone crazy more-or-less. Still, the plot might lack some ingenuity, but they brought it out in a way that seems to master this form of the story. I've seen other cave movies before, but they weren't put together like this one was. In fact, they did a good job of explaining almost every aspect of the adventure in a true, realistic manner. You felt like the character had no choice and made responsible efforts in their quest to survive. The ending is somewhat of a give and take piece, it lets your imagination run for a bit, as it's more symbolic rather than direct, so you'll have to take away your own thoughts of the film, but I think that this makes it leave a lasting impression.Atmosphere: So this was another thing that I enjoyed. This movie boasts some excellent camera work. If you're at all claustrophobic, this movie will probably scare the h""ll out of you. They did a great job using the darkness and lighting the scenes effectively and mysteriously. They also used red flares, and green glow sticks in specific sequences, which gave a nice stylized look to the overall film.Effects: There was quite a bit of gore in the film...some of it better than others. I noticed a few scenes where the gore was just amateurish, and yet there were many scenes where it was really well done. A production schedule glitch? I don't know, but I would've loved to see the whole thing with a mastering of these effects. I think though that what they do provide over-rides the less-than incredible gore, and I think most gore fans will be pleased with the quality of the effects.Acting: There's a lot of new faces, at least new as in the sense of the American market. I've not heard of these British actresses before. They did a most excellent job, and really lost control on this production. It seems like they knew exactly how to react and the director did a great job of bringing out the emotion of the scene. It was a most realistic and reasonable ride throughout the film. I think that the females were ""friends"" off-set, because it really shows through in the film.This is a definite recommendation, and a film that I will add to my collection in the near future. I think that it was interesting, fun, creative, and it really keeps you going from beginning to end. It's got a good amount of suspense, tension and gore. In my opinion, it should make any horror film fan happy.",5,Women and Blood mix well.....,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2880,"['So', 'was', 'rather', 'interesting', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'weeks', 'provided', 'interesting', 'location', 'mind-bending', 'ending', 'unique', 'cast', 'females', 'react', 'reasonably', 'face', 'danger', 'What', 'else', 'really', 'made', 'grade', 'film', 'Plot', 'Ok', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'bunch', 'girls', 'go', 'caving', 'lurking', 'darkness', 'evolved', 'human', 'evolved', 'live', 'perfectly', 'dark', 'Cavemen', 'gone', 'crazy', 'more-or-less', 'Still', 'plot', 'might', 'lack', 'ingenuity', 'brought', 'out', 'way', 'master', 'form', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'cave', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'put', 'together', 'one', 'was', 'fact', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'almost', 'aspect', 'adventure', 'true', 'realistic', 'manner', 'felt', 'character', 'had', 'choice', 'made', 'responsible', 'efforts', 'quest', 'survive', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'give', 'take', 'piece', 'imagination', 'run', 'bit', 'more', 'symbolic', 'rather', 'direct', ""'ll"", 'have', 'take', 'away', 'own', 'thoughts', 'film', 'think', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression.Atmosphere', 'So', 'was', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'excellent', 'camera', 'work', ""'re"", 'claustrophobic', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'scare', 'h', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'using', 'darkness', 'lighting', 'scenes', 'effectively', 'mysteriously', 'also', 'used', 'red', 'flares', 'green', 'glow', 'sticks', 'specific', 'sequences', 'gave', 'nice', 'stylized', 'look', 'overall', 'film.Effects', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'gore', 'film', 'better', 'others', 'noticed', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'gore', 'was', 'just', 'amateurish', 'yet', 'were', 'many', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'production', 'schedule', 'glitch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'mastering', 'effects', 'think', 'what', 'do', 'provide', 'less-than', 'incredible', 'gore', 'think', 'most', 'gore', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'quality', 'effects.Acting', 'lot', 'new', 'least', 'new', 'sense', 'American', 'market', ""'ve"", 'not', 'heard', 'British', 'actresses', 'did', 'most', 'excellent', 'job', 'really', 'lost', 'control', 'production', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'react', 'director', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'out', 'emotion', 'scene', 'was', 'most', 'realistic', 'reasonable', 'ride', 'film', 'think', 'females', 'were', 'friends', 'off-set', 'really', 'film.This', 'definite', 'recommendation', 'film', 'will', 'add', 'collection', 'near', 'future', 'think', 'was', 'interesting', 'fun', 'creative', 'really', 'going', 'beginning', 'end', 'got', 'good', 'amount', 'suspense', 'tension', 'gore', 'opinion', 'should', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'fan', 'happy']","Descent,the Version anglais"

Not only was I still in awe of Neil Marshall's technical skill and the actor's performances and how they worked together to create the most claustrophobic film in existence, but while watching the film, I felt my wife almost unable to breathe or move while viewing it, and her energy enhanced my energy and my immersiveness into the film.The absolute best thing about this film is that it could have easily succeeded in a horror film even without the subterranean cannibals because of the setting of the film and the interaction between the characters in the film. It's one of those rare horror films that perfectly transcends the genre, and when a horror film can do that, it makes it an almost instant classic.I say to not watch this film alone, not just because it is damn scary, but if you do watch it alone, you don't have the energy of the other people around you. Some films you can see by yourself and it doesn't really matter, but THE DESCENT is a film that requires you being in an audience of at least one other person.

924049,A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI,B000A8NZ0O,JAMES MCCORMICK,"[1, 1]","5 Stars = MasterpieceFew horror movies, if any, in the last ten years match the intensity, suspense, dread, action, acting, direction, character study, & just the up in your face horror of ""The Descent!""A group of women descend in to a cave that is supposed to be already explored, at least that is what they all think, except Juno, who has actually taken them to a uncharted cave system. Juno wants them to be the first to explore it. So our story starts, after a prologue of Sarah, Juno's best friend (or should I say, biggest guilt?) loses her husband & daughter in a car wreck, & the group of friends meeting each other after a long absence, at a cabin in the woods.If you're claustrophobic, then don't watch this film, as the women crawl, climb, & dig their way in to the cave. In a terrifying scene, Sarah gets stuck in a small passage way. Her friend Beth, crawls back to talk her out of panicking, so she can get Sarah out. As this starts to work & Sarah squirms her way out, the passage starts to collapse on top of her, as Beth urges her to move fast! Hence the cave now becomes a huge looming cavernous maw that swallows them whole, & closes it's mouth. The women are stuck in a giant cave complex, filled with passages, spreading out like veins in a hand, with no idea if there is another way out. A true horror, that is completely plausible!As the women search for a way out, with many a suspenseful scene, the cave becomes more & more ominous. They find ancient drawings from cave dwellers that suggest another entrance (exit) of the cave. It is here that all hell breaks loose, as their stalked by mutant cave dwellers for food, one by one.Not since ""Aliens"" has there been such intense action in a horror film, as the women punch, kick, bludgeon, & stab their way through thrilling scene after scene of survival carnage with the mutants. This is literally savage, & is filmed, acted, & choreographed in such a way that it sucks you in like a giant vortex, right into the action! The mutants make up is totally credible & genuinely scary, especially the female mutant. They look like a cross of humans with bat like features on their head & faces, true subterranean looking creatures, right out of a nightmare!To say much more about the story, would be giving to much away. I will say this, the film is a experience! An experience in terrifying claustrophobic horror. One has a hard time figuring out which is more terrifying, the cave & it's hopelessness, or the mutants? Both are a potent combination, & if it were not for the terrific cinematography, make up, ensemble acting, direction, setting, & editing, this film could've of been just another forgettable horror film. Thanks to director Neil Marshall, it's not! For he has created a true masterpiece of the genre, & though there have been similar films, at least in theme of cave creatures, this film stands as a true original masterpiece!The Blu-ray looks & sounds fantastic, if you don't have it, it's time to upgrade!Essential viewing for the horror lover!",5,An Education in Claustrophobic Terror!,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,3032,"['5', 'Stars', '=', 'MasterpieceFew', 'horror', 'movies', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'match', 'intensity', 'suspense', 'dread', 'action', 'acting', 'direction', 'character', 'study', 'just', 'up', 'face', 'horror', 'Descent', 'group', 'women', 'descend', 'cave', 'supposed', 'be', 'already', 'explored', 'least', 'what', 'think', 'Juno', 'who', 'actually', 'taken', 'uncharted', 'cave', 'system', 'Juno', 'be', 'first', 'explore', 'So', 'story', 'starts', 'prologue', 'Sarah', 'Juno', 'best', 'friend', 'should', 'say', 'biggest', 'guilt', 'husband', 'daughter', 'car', 'wreck', 'group', 'friends', 'meeting', 'other', 'long', 'absence', 'cabin', 'woods.If', ""'re"", 'claustrophobic', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'women', 'crawl', 'climb', 'dig', 'way', 'cave', 'terrifying', 'scene', 'Sarah', 'stuck', 'small', 'passage', 'way', 'friend', 'Beth', 'back', 'talk', 'panicking', 'can', 'get', 'Sarah', 'out', 'work', 'Sarah', 'way', 'passage', 'collapse', 'top', 'Beth', 'move', 'fast', 'Hence', 'cave', 'now', 'huge', 'looming', 'cavernous', 'maw', 'whole', 'mouth', 'women', 'are', 'stuck', 'giant', 'cave', 'complex', 'filled', 'passages', 'spreading', 'out', 'veins', 'hand', 'idea', 'way', 'out', 'true', 'horror', 'completely', 'plausible', 'women', 'search', 'way', 'many', 'suspenseful', 'scene', 'cave', 'more', 'more', 'ominous', 'find', 'ancient', 'drawings', 'cave', 'dwellers', 'suggest', 'entrance', 'exit', 'cave', 'here', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'stalked', 'mutant', 'cave', 'dwellers', 'food', 'one', 'one.Not', 'Aliens', 'there', 'been', 'such', 'intense', 'action', 'horror', 'film', 'women', 'punch', 'kick', 'bludgeon', 'stab', 'way', 'thrilling', 'scene', 'scene', 'survival', 'carnage', 'mutants', 'literally', 'savage', 'filmed', 'acted', 'choreographed', 'such', 'way', 'giant', 'vortex', 'right', 'action', 'mutants', 'make', 'up', 'totally', 'credible', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'especially', 'female', 'mutant', 'look', 'cross', 'humans', 'bat', 'features', 'head', 'true', 'subterranean', 'looking', 'creatures', 'right', 'nightmare', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'experience', 'experience', 'terrifying', 'claustrophobic', 'horror', 'One', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'more', 'terrifying', 'cave', 'hopelessness', 'mutants', 'are', 'potent', 'combination', 'were', 'not', 'terrific', 'cinematography', 'make', 'up', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'direction', 'setting', 'editing', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'just', 'forgettable', 'horror', 'film', 'Thanks', 'director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'not', 'created', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'genre', 'have', 'been', 'similar', 'films', 'least', 'theme', 'cave', 'creatures', 'film', 'true', 'original', 'masterpiece', 'Blu-ray', 'fantastic', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'upgrade', 'Essential', 'viewing', 'horror', 'lover']","Descent,the Version anglais"

It takes only a few scenes to hook the viewer.Three thrill-seeking women are white water rafter, enjoying life. Just as a little tension is building, and a concept is forming, tragedy strikes. The tension that was there, or at least hinted at, is all but gone. But it sets up the rest of the movie.Wanting to get over the tragedy, the women gather together one year later to renew their adventurous side. The threesome meets three other women for the weekend thrill of caving. With no real experience, the women take off for a crazy, and dark adventure. Trouble ensues.As expected, several aspects of the movie are present: caving, shock scare scenes, a cave in, darkness adding to the eerie aura, injuries, deaths, and the use of all sorts of caving gear used in assorted fashions.As the women make their way through the caves, they soon encounter their cave-dwelling antagonist. The movie takes a quick turn to scarytown, and the action really picks up. Anyone wanting a fair share of blood, guts, and mutilation will love the action sequences in this movie.Genuine terror and shock, along with a creepy foe, makes for a delightfully evil and well made scary movie. There is, however, one downfall: the ending.The ending to ""The Descent"" is possibly one of the worst movie endings of all time. 95% of the movie is exactly as desired, and then the end is sloppy. The resolution is not there, and it's nowhere near as expected. A sure-fire ending, one that is already known, isn't a good thing, but neither is the total opposite. As with most things, moderation is the key. And the ending to this movie is not moderate by any means.

924059,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B000A8NZ0O,JD,"[2, 4]","The Descent was one of those movies that had me enjoying it and hating it at the same time.  I have to agree with other reviewers that mentioned that for a large portion of the audience (me included) the movie was clunky, full of holes and, in a sense, confusing and jumbled.  *I have not watched the director's commentary, as I don't think that should be a requirement for enjoying/undertanding a flick.On to the meat of the review.  The movie is basic and I like those.  You have a group of women who go spelunking/cave diving, run into trouble, meet up with some mutated human monster thingies and get themselves gobbled up.  Pretty good so far.The cave scenes were well shot for the most part, nice and tight and then at times opening up into dark caverns and underground water pools, etc.  But the tight scenes really get to us cluastraphobic types.  Good.The acting was fair for a flick of this type.  It wasn't great by any stretch because of the type of charchters, the actors playing them and the script and direction they had to work with.  I didn't find myself caring if they made it or not, or forming any chemistry for the cast, but I didn't really find them annoying either.  When they would die I was rather indifferent and never even learned most of their names anyway (that is how little you will care about them).  In a word:  Disposable.The monsters.  I liked them.  But they were portrayed horribly.  Supposedly they had access to the surface the whole time, but they preferred to stay down there and mutate to the point of losing their eyesite.  Um, ok, fine.  But they have been thriving down there and no one has run into them before, though one of the actors had heard about this cave and knew where to find it.  Ok.  In addition, the monsters are supposed to be blind and the senses they do use (maybe sound) to navigate and engage prey seems to come and go.  They can navigate the caves perfectly, but they apparently have no sense of feel, no sensation towards warmth or cold, and they can dodge physical attacks pretty well for something with a body that size that can't see.Another problem I had with the cast was their gear.  They were well supplied with ice-axes and they apparently were carrying medical gear, climbing gear and rope, but none of them were wearing fingered gloves (some didn't have gloves at all)? In addition, they didn't have extra batteries or lamps/lights, but they did have flares.  And no knives and only one lighter.  They had quite a collection of gear (I don't know how they were carrying it because you couldn't see them carrying much) but they didn't have the stuff I would have thought common to spelunkers.  But I haven't done that professionally.The combat scenes with the monsters were jumbled.  The cast fluctuates from being quite proficient at defending themselves one moment and then being the helpless victim the next.Ok, now I'm going to make an assumption here, because it helps explain away some of the holes I had at the end of the film.  The title, descent, could be indicative of two things:  1) the descent into the cave, 2) the descent into madness by the main charachter.  For me, that helped bring some cohesion to the movie, as I was originally struggling to find what the beginning sequence had to do with the rest of the movie.Hmmm...so I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it was a good movie, I don't think it was well thought out, well-acted or well put together.",3,Eh...,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,3449,"['Descent', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'had', 'enjoying', 'hating', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'large', 'portion', 'audience', 'included', 'movie', 'was', 'clunky', 'full', 'holes', 'sense', 'confusing', 'jumbled', '*I', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'director', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'be', 'requirement', 'enjoying/undertanding', 'flick.On', 'meat', 'review', 'movie', 'basic', 'like', 'have', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'go', 'spelunking/cave', 'diving', 'run', 'trouble', 'meet', 'up', 'mutated', 'human', 'monster', 'thingies', 'get', 'gobbled', 'up', 'Pretty', 'good', 'far.The', 'cave', 'scenes', 'were', 'well', 'shot', 'most', 'part', 'nice', 'tight', 'then', 'times', 'opening', 'up', 'dark', 'caverns', 'underground', 'water', 'pools', 'etc', 'tight', 'scenes', 'really', 'get', 'cluastraphobic', 'types', 'Good.The', 'acting', 'was', 'fair', 'flick', 'type', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'stretch', 'type', 'charchters', 'actors', 'playing', 'script', 'direction', 'had', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'caring', 'made', 'not', 'forming', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'annoying', 'either', 'When', 'would', 'die', 'was', 'rather', 'indifferent', 'never', 'even', 'learned', 'most', 'names', 'anyway', 'how', 'little', 'will', 'care', 'word', 'Disposable.The', 'monsters', 'liked', 'were', 'portrayed', 'horribly', 'Supposedly', 'had', 'access', 'surface', 'whole', 'time', 'preferred', 'stay', 'there', 'mutate', 'point', 'losing', 'eyesite', 'Um', 'ok', 'fine', 'have', 'been', 'thriving', 'there', 'one', 'run', 'one', 'actors', 'had', 'heard', 'cave', 'knew', 'where', 'find', 'Ok', 'addition', 'monsters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'blind', 'senses', 'do', 'use', 'maybe', 'sound', 'navigate', 'engage', 'prey', 'come', 'go', 'can', 'navigate', 'caves', 'perfectly', 'apparently', 'have', 'sense', 'feel', 'sensation', 'warmth', 'cold', 'can', 'dodge', 'physical', 'attacks', 'pretty', 'well', 'something', 'body', 'size', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'cast', 'was', 'gear', 'were', 'well', 'supplied', 'ice-axes', 'apparently', 'were', 'carrying', 'medical', 'gear', 'climbing', 'gear', 'rope', 'none', 'were', 'wearing', 'fingered', 'gloves', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'gloves', 'addition', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'extra', 'batteries', 'lamps/lights', 'did', 'have', 'flares', 'knives', 'only', 'one', 'lighter', 'had', 'quite', 'collection', 'gear', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'were', 'carrying', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'carrying', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'stuff', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'common', 'spelunkers', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'professionally.The', 'combat', 'scenes', 'monsters', 'were', 'jumbled', 'cast', 'being', 'quite', 'proficient', 'defending', 'one', 'moment', 'then', 'being', 'helpless', 'next.Ok', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'make', 'assumption', 'here', 'explain', 'away', 'holes', 'had', 'end', 'film', 'title', 'descent', 'could', 'be', 'indicative', 'two', 'things', '1', 'descent', 'cave', '2', 'descent', 'madness', 'main', 'charachter', 'helped', 'bring', 'cohesion', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'struggling', 'find', 'what', 'beginning', 'sequence', 'had', 'do', 'rest', 'movie.Hmmm', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well-acted', 'well', 'put', 'together']","Descent,the Version anglais"

924065,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000A8NZ0O,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","""The Descent"" is a good movie in almost every way. The tension and claustrophobia of being trapped in an unknown cave system is palpable. The previous movie of Neil Marshall was, in essence, a black comedy. There is none in here. Everything is horrifying, terrifying, thrilling and scary. Six girls trapped underground and a common enemy. This film brought two things to mind while I was watching it, Aliens and the Thing, these two movies set the bar when it comes to atmosphere, and this above all others is key to a good horror film. Neil Marshall seems to be a master of this, in an era when great horror films are tough to come by. From the very beginning this movie grabs you by your collar and doesn't let go. It seems to place right in the mix of everything that is happening, and emotion, what was the last horror film anyone has seen that had emotional attachment to its characters.The gore comes pretty hot and heavy in the second half of the film, and the ending of the film is appropriately surprising and bleak, without being corny. Another big plus in my book is that the ""creature"" FX aren't over-the-top and don't rely on much, if any CGI. When I first heard that ""The Descent"" was a ""creature"" film, I was kind of worried because I feel that those types of films have gone severely down-hill with the advent of the over-use of CGI...but this film doesn't fall into that category. Some of the acting isn't the greatest but it doesn't really detract from the film overall, and some seem to think that the first half of the film is slow. Personally, I think that the early sequences in the caves are a great ""tension-builder"" as things go from bad-to-worse, and right when you think it can't go any lower, the audience is clued in to the existence of the other ""inhabitants"" of the caves and all hell breaks loose.

924067,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B000A8NZ0O,J. Friday,"[3, 8]","I liked this movie when I look at it as mindless entertainment. But all the reviews that this is new and groundbreaking are ridiculous. This movie is full of cliches from American horror that were predictable 10 yrs before ""the Descent"" was made. For one thing, echolocation isn't something that only works when something moves or makes noise. A creature with echolocation is able to spot prey even when it is inert and silent. Another thing: so the creature can kill moose and wolves? But 95 lb Asian and British women armed with nothing but a pickaxe and a collar bone can take down a dozen without so much as a scratch? And get this: these women can kill these creatures even after her throat's been slashed.The characterization is nonexistent in this movie. These women go from frail Englishwomen to full-blown Green Beret Rambos? Director Neil Marshall has obviously been influenced by Rambo: the cave scene reminds me of First Blood's cave scene. The scene where the wolves fight the soldier's in the forest in ""Dog Soldiers"" is reminiscent of Rambo's forest scene against the cops. But using the Rambo influence is implausible here. These women have never fought these gollums before, let alone knew these things existed, yet they are able to defend themselves skillfully against a swarm of them? Right.If you watch this movie for entertainment purposes, it's good. But don't listen to the whole ""it's new and innovative"" talk from some positive reviewers. Virtually everything non-Hollywood is considered innovative. It's part of the whole ""bash Hollywood/praise non-Hollywood"" scene that's popular these days. To act as if the Descent isn't swamped in Hollywood horror cliches is ridiculous. Lionsgate helped promote this flick. People wanna bash the so-called ""American ending"". That's what helped the hype. This film gained notoriety based on the ""American ending"" controversy. This is true because all of Neill Marshall's other movies (except Doomsday...bleh) aren't nearly as popular as ""the Descent"". So shouldn't Marshall be grateful the controversy hyped his movie?

I suppose wasting the money to rent it is my own fault, since I got exactly what I anticipated: a lot of bloodshed, wannabe giallo, and some retarded attempts at echoing other mediocre horror movies (""The Grudge"", etc).When I read about the ""cave creatures"" that appear in the film (some of the only believable characters cause they don't talk too much, and make no attempts at fake on again off again foreign accents) I was pretty certain it would fail, and it took two hours of irritating alpha cave girls getting cannibalized by the most hilarious looking pointy-eared sorry a** excuses for monsters to convince me.People talk about an ""overwhelming mood of claustrophobia"", as though some new Hitchcock decided to go for broke and make a B horror movie in his spare time.  I'm claustrophobic, and I the only air I was gasping for watching this piece of sadistic trash was estrogen free oxygen.Someone mentioned Dario Argento in relation to this movie. Please, no.  His misogyny was a little less subtle and easier to take because he never bothered to make characters out of the women he slaughtered on camera.  I find it kind of disturbing that people enjoy watching this sort of thing and write rave reviews about it.  If all these chicks had died because they went insane and we never got a clear picture of the creatures that would be one thing, but you're telling me you enjoy watching this?The only remotely effective part of this ludicrous mess is the end.

924070,A2JXM2910HL9FY,B000A8NZ0O,"JG ""Jake""","[0, 0]","This British low budget horror picture, like 28 Days Later, does something that horror films have not done in a long time, and that is scare the living crap out of the audience. The movie is marketed as ""a movie from the same studio that released Hostel and Saw"" as if it were a bad movie which needed all the helpful marketing it could get. Ironically this film is miles above and beyond the Saw and Hostel franchises, and if anything audiences who hated Saw and Hostel will be turned off from this. It's a real shame though because this film is what horror movies haven't, and should've been, for a long time.The story and plot are well conceived, and it seems that this horrific trip through an unexplored cave system in the mountains can be symbolic of the main character's struggle to overcome the demons of her past. The main character had lost her family in frightening car accident a year before, and has since been having hallucinations revolving around it. Taking it as it is though, the plot revolves around six females who go exploring a cave, when there is a collapse blocking one of the entrances. And so the girls must find another way out. However, disorientation, claustrophobia, and hallucinations begin to set in, making this a terrifying journey.This however is only the beginning. When you just thought it couldn't get freakier, being in a pitch black unknown environment, it appears that the six girls are not alone miles under the Earth, and so this is when the movie turns into an all-out monster movie. The humanoid monsters would scare the living s*** out of anyone who is watching this movie, they move like the zombies from 28 Days Later, and in an environment like a pitch black cave, it's all the more frightening.Stylistically the film uses the same grainy handheld look of 28 Days Later, amping up the disorientation, this combined with the harsh shadows and sharp contrasts of the flashlights used by the characters, creates a look and feel that strongly brings to mind moments from the Alien series. Especially shots where there is a closeup of moisture dripping from the jagged ceiling of the cave. And for anyone who is a fan of the Alien movies, the first shot of the ""crawler"" monster will have you feeling nostalgic.This movie is truly terrifying, as I've said before, something that Hollywood cinema's so-called ""horror"" movies have failed to do for a long time, ever since the MTV Generation of film-makers took over. British horror films seem to still have it, and it seems that they are even reimaging classic horror archetypes into something new and even more scary. Just look at how much more scary the fast-moving zombies of 28 Days Later are in comparison to the sluggish zombies of old. And with this one, look at how the film-maker has managed to take influence from a movie from 1979 and managed to make a film equally horrifying, and fresh-feeling, as opposed to the American tendency to remake old horror movies with little aesthetic merit.

However, unlike ""Dog Soldiers,"" which is more creepy than scary, ""The Descent"" had me nearly climbing the walls in squirmy terror.Because I am a dunce, I first watched this by myself at night several years ago. (I have no idea what I was thinking.) I didn't realize how truly frightening it would be, and, by the time I did, I HAD to finish it because I needed to know what happened! I watched most of it from inside a blanket, viewing it from a hole in my protective cocoon. I think I held my breath through most of it.It manages to build characters and situations that are believable and real (even exploring the depths of female friendship and loyalty), making you care about these women. When you watch it, it doesn't feel like a soulless Hollywood film that's just gratuitously gory and bloody with a plot thrown in because there needs to be one. It's raw, engaging, and real--you can believe it really is a vacation for six women that went horribly wrong.True to what seems to be the nature of Neil Marshall's brilliance when it comes to suspenseful horror, this movie manages to not actually show you what's terrifying until more than halfway through the movie, yet keeps you engaged and on the edge of your seat by merely... suggesting... what might be terrifying.My husband, an avid horror connoisseur, actually jumped at The Scene (I'm sure everyone knows what scene this is without me having to describe it!) and squirmed through the rest of it, and I have never seen him jump or squirm at any movie before.All that said, and I hate to say it, this movie was not perfect to me. I docked a star for the ending, which was the only part that disappointed me--it was lame. This is because I am not a fan of endings that aren't endings.

Originally released in 2005 in foreign countries, it came out here in the U.S. last year and became a minor hit for LionsGate with good reviews and i believe this is a new horror classic of the new era and a must see.This unrated widescreen director's cut DVD contains footage of gore not shown in the R-rated cut and has cool features like two audio commentaries, a behind the scenes featurette, deleted and extended scenes, storyboard and scene comparisions, stills gallery, interview with the director and Bios, a must have for the horror collection.Also recommended: ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (1977 and 2006)"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Re-Animator"", ""Slither"", ""Predator"", ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Demons"", ""28 Days Later..."", ""28 Weeks Later..."", ""Night of the Living Dead (1968)"", ""C.H.U.D"", ""From Beyond"", ""Evil Dead 2"", ""The Hills Have Eyes 2 (2007)"", ""Slugs"", ""Stephen King's IT"", ""Saw Trilogy"", ""Bloodsucking Freaks"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Vampire Hunter D"", ""Underworld 1 & 2"", ""Blade Trilogy"", ""Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)"", ""Day of the Dead"", ""Land of the Dead"", ""Cabin Fever"", ""Hostel 1 & 2"", ""Battle Royale"", ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Street Trash"", ""The Toxic Avenger"", ""Undead"", ""Demons 2"", ""Inferno"", ""Ichi The Killer"", ""The Thing (1982)"", ""Resident Evil 1 & 2: The movies"", ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""Dagon"".",5,An instant horror classic of the 2000's.,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1979,"['Six', 'women', 'go', 'Appalachians', 'mountain', 'expedition', 'find', 'mysteries', 'cave', 'rockfall', 'exit', 'go', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'out', 'soon', 'discover', 'race', 'ancient', 'flesh-eating', 'creatures', 'must', 'fight', 'way', 'secret', 'exit', 'somewhere', 'cave.A', 'claustrophobic', 'atmospheric', 'British', 'horror', 'thriller', 'shocker', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'director', 'suprisingly', 'great', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'thrills', 'rollercoaster', 'movie', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'shocking', 'gore', 'unrated', 'cut', 'heart-pounding', 'gripping', 'thrillride', 'never', 'go', 'pushes', 'edge', 'Originally', 'released', '2005', 'foreign', 'countries', 'came', 'out', 'here', 'U.S.', 'last', 'year', 'became', 'minor', 'hit', 'LionsGate', 'good', 'reviews', 'i', 'believe', 'new', 'horror', 'classic', 'new', 'era', 'must', 'see.This', 'unrated', 'widescreen', 'director', 'cut', 'DVD', 'footage', 'gore', 'not', 'shown', 'R-rated', 'cut', 'cool', 'features', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'storyboard', 'scene', 'comparisions', 'stills', 'gallery', 'interview', 'director', 'Bios', 'must', 'have', 'horror', 'collection.Also', 'recommended', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '1977', '2006', 'Dusk', 'Till', 'Dawn', 'Re-Animator', 'Slither', 'Predator', 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'Demons', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '1968', 'C.H.U.D', 'Beyond', 'Evil', 'Dead', '2', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '2', '2007', 'Slugs', 'Stephen', 'King', 'IT', 'Saw', 'Trilogy', 'Bloodsucking', 'Freaks', 'Grindhouse', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'D', 'Underworld', '1', '2', 'Blade', 'Trilogy', 'Dawn', 'Dead', '1978', '2004', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Land', 'Dead', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Hostel', '1', '2', 'Battle', 'Royale', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Street', 'Trash', 'Toxic', 'Avenger', 'Undead', 'Demons', '2', 'Inferno', 'Ichi', 'Killer', 'Thing', '1982', 'Resident', 'Evil', '1', '2', 'movies', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'Dagon']","Descent,the Version anglais"

Both are interesting, but the one with the director and 5 of the 6 girls is better.  Not hard to guess why they jokingly referred to this film as ""Six Chicks with Picks"".  At the start of the Blooper Reel, right after the footage of the six actresses belching during takes, is some footage of one of the Crawlers doing his best Mick Jagger imitation (and he's pretty good!).Not all Director Commentary tracks are interesting.  But of the two on this DVD, the second one offered (the one with Director and Cast) is worth a listen.The only thing I can think of that would have made the Special Features section even better would be a ""Music Only"" track.  David Julyan's score is haunting and creepy.And in one of the commentaries, the director commented on the sparse use of CGI in this film.

However you do have six women starring in a horror movie, that's 12 boobs people, none of which we see. So no nudity, but the story, frights, and blood more than make up for it. You have six female friends who like to go on adventures like white water rafting. After a tragic car accident, one of the women loses her daughter and husband.The next outing is planned by Juno, who fancies herself as leader of the group. SHe takes the girls to a massive underground network of caves. The other women are under the impression that these are the Borehdom Caves, but Juno had other ideas. She actually took the women to an unexplored cave system. She wants them to get the credit for discovering it and naming it. Well there is a cave in and the truth comes out as the women realized they are lost and possibly trapped.Now things really start to go wrong, one girl falls down a long shaft and shatters her leg. While four women help her, one woman sees 'something... something that looks human'. Now the fun begins.The cave system is inhabited by milky white, blind humanoid creatures with amazing climbing skills and sharp teeth that love to bite and chew through flesh. Now the women are separated and forced to fight their way out. But soon another one of Juno's little secrets is about to be discovered. While fighting the monsters, she accidently sends he axe claw through the neck of one of her friends. She ends up leaving her for dead.But the dying girl now knows the secret and tells the other woman who discovers her as she lays dying and begs for death. Turns out Juno had an affiar with the dead husband! Soon it is just Juno and the betrayed wife fighting their way through the caves. After a huge battle leaves them both bloodied and exhausted, Juno gets an axe through the leg and is left behind to be torn to pieces.As for the jilted wife's fate, the movie has a great twist that I will not spoil here.

Small downsides: the women start appearing whiny after a while (understandable, but still annoying), and amid all the eventual screaming at one another for this or that I completely missed a few plot revelations mentioned in these reviews, the main one being that apparently one of the girls betrayed another one in a big way sometime in the recent past.  Maybe I was just tired when I watched it.  Anyway, I still liked the movie a lot, especially appreciating the way it successfully juggled both subtle, creepy scares and outright horrific moments.  It did both well and knew which types of scares to employ when.  And speaking of subtle and creepy, be sure to get the ""original unrated cut"", as it ends the movie on a more subtle and disturbing note that works much better than the ending attached to the truncated American cut.

The last trip was white water rafting and this one will be spelunking.  Plans are made and the women meet up in the Appalachian mountains.  They hike to their cave which looks like a Yucatan sinkhole and begin their adventure.  Things are moving smoothly and the women are having fun.  But a small rockfall blocks a narrow passage they need to use to exit.  Then the truths start to come out.  They are not in the cave they thought and they have no maps.  The cave is previously unexplored so they have no idea if there is another way out.  But with no other choice, they set out deeper into the cave to try and find a way out.  If they don't then they will die and no one will know where they are.Further into the cave system it becomes apparent that they are not alone.  There are other things that look sort of like people but are pale and blind.  They also happen to be excellent climbers, fast, strong, and vicious.  Now the women have a two front war on their hands.  One the one side they have to fight the cave to find their way out.  On the other side they have the cave creatures that think they are their next meal.  Tension, action, and desperation mount and time is running out.  Will they get out?  If they do, who will survive?  You will have to watch it to find out.Although remarkably similar to Jeff Long's book THE DESCENT there is nothing in the film, packaging, or extras that makes any mention of it.  This is an unusual film in that except for in the first few minutes, the entire cast is female.  There is no testosterone-fueled action here and yet it is not needed.  The film works.  There were a few subtle scenes that actually made my hackles rise (fewer than ten films have managed that).  The caves look like real caves and not flat-floored movie caves.  The lighting is handled so that it seems like the cavers are supplying all of the light and yet nothing is missed.  The tension and action build asymptotically.

It has elements of betrayal and revenge in it as well.  The plot is this (without giving too much away): five daredevil females go cave exploring in an unchartered cave and discover, or rather are discovered, by something heretofore unknown.The women are physically strong, fit, prepared.  They are experienced thrill seekers.  I like the fact that there are no dumb, helpless female moments.  At no time did I find myself rolling my eyes and thinking, ""This woman is too stupid to live.  Why doesn't she just die already.""  Throughout the movie I was rooting for each woman's survival. These women are damn tough and they know what they're doing! The actresses are all thoroughly convincing in their roles, especially when the element of fear is introduced.  The women's individual reactions is probably the most frightening aspect of all, so convincing do the actresses portray their characters.The only element of the movie I found disappointing was that Juno's betrayal of Sarah was not more dramatically pronounced.

The only genuinely scary moment that actually made effective use of the claustrophobic cave environment is the one where one of the women gets herself wedged in a narrow tunnel (nevermind that the tunnel collapsing on top of her inexplicably helps her free herself).To add to the fun, the opening 10 minutes or so of the movie has little to do with what happens next, before being arbitrarily evoked towards the end to justify some more gratuitous violence.In the final scenes of the Descent the protagonist detaches herself from any sort of credible plot or character motivation, and a laughable twist is inserted into the final moments of the film with all the aplomb and originality of a derivative grade 2 creative writing exercise.The production values are good, and this comes from Britain, which may be why it got far more attention than it deserves.

924091,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000A8NZ0O,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 4]","Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, ""The Descent"" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, ""The Descent""""The Descent"" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.Even though ""The Descent"" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.""The Descent"" is unrated and contains violence and language.",2,"Starts Out Strong, But Fizzles Quickly...",1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,3411,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'may', 'need', 'quit', 'listening', 'opinions', 'co-workers', 'regards', 'movies', 'watch', 'least', 'when', 'horror', 'genre', 'Numerous', 'people', 'where', 'work', 'told', 'movie', 'Descent', 'was', 'absolutely', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'defense', 'co-workers', 'were', ""n't"", 'only', 'people', 'opinion', 'many', 'critics', 'other', 'moviegoers', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'Well', 'apparently', 'hype', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'regarding', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'film', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'more', 'later', 'now', 'will', 'give', 'plot', 'summary', 'last', 'year', 'supposed', 'horror', 'spectacular', 'Descent', 'Descent', 'young', 'woman', 'vacation', 'family', 'friends', 'when', 'husband', 'daughter', 'suffer', 'tragic', 'accident', 'One', 'year', 'later', 'prodding', 'same', 'friends', 'spelunking', 'adventure', 'problem', 'none', 'friends', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'cave', 'fact', 'newly', 'discovered', 'cave', 'one', 'explored', 'yet', 'attempt', 'explore', 'unexplored', 'brave', 'young', 'women', 'become', 'trapped', 'cave', 'Making', 'matters', 'worse', 'cave', 'not', 'ordinary', 'cave', 'one', 'inhabited', 'bloodthirsty', 'mutant', 'creatures', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'found', 'next', 'meal.At', 'beginning', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'interested', 'developing', 'story', 'shocking', 'opener', 'really', 'caught', 'attention', 'giving', 'sense', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'actually', 'giving', 'unexpected', 'However', 'once', 'story', 'part', 'where', 'girls', 'are', 'cave', 'actually', 'where', 'majority', 'film', 'place', 'things', 'begin', 'go', 'awry', 'picture', 'first', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'using', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere', 'giving', 'audience', 'sense', 'entrapment', 'anxiety', 'served', 'heighten', 'suspense', 'regarding', 'possibility', 'impending', 'doom', 'Then', 'filmmakers', 'introduce', 'fact', 'felt', 'completely', 'derailed', 'movie', 'cave', 'one', 'been', 'girls', 'are', 'hardly', 'professional', 'So', 'who', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'put', 'friends', 'possible', 'jeopardy', 'just', 'be', 'first', 'explore', 'newly', 'discovered', 'cave', 'absolutely', 'stupid', 'especially', 'when', 'placed', 'viewed', 'context', 'character', 'interaction', 'companionship', 'other', 'none', 'girls', 'would', 'do', 'other', 'mutants', 'show', 'up', 'plot', 'point', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'help', 'put', 'movie', 'back', 'right', 'direction', 'however', 'where', 'movie', 'unwind', 'even', 'faster', 'now', 'just', 'one', 'gory', 'scene', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'average', 'monster', 'movie', 'decision', 'somewhat', 'agreed', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'was', 'decision', 'keep', 'mutants', 'unknown', 'one', 'hand', 'served', 'add', 'mystery', 'why', 'are', 'attacking', 'girls', 'just', 'assume', ""'re"", 'cannibalistic', 'other', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'know', 'how', 'got', 'there.Even', 'Descent', 'was', 'hyped', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'recent', 'time', 'friends', 'many', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'was', 'merely', 'average', 'addition', 'genre', 'already', 'full', 'mediocrity', 'Descent', 'unrated', 'violence', 'language']","Descent,the Version anglais"

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 4]","When I first saw previews for ""The Descent,"" I immediately wrote it off as a copycat wannabe thriller like ""The Cave.""  In fact, that's what took me so long to view this film.  I figured that it would be just another dull spelunking horror flick.  Boy, was I wrong.  ""The Descent"" is one of the top horror flicks to come out in the last few years.  The plot is simple enough:  six ladies, all with varied intentions, head off to the Appalachian mountains for a weekend of spelunking fun.  Once they hit the hole, however, they begin to discover a hidden agenda as well as some creepy, gel-skinned critters that are very, very hungry.  The creatures begin to pick them off (as all good horror movie monsters do), but they don't do it quietly.  In fact, these creatures are very vocal once they begin their attack.  Who, if anybody, will make it out in the end?The cast is headed up by Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Jackson Mendoza.  Both do a wonderful job with their characters, Sarah and Juno, respectively.  The rest of the cave-hopping gang includes the talented Saskia Mulder, Alex Reid, MyAnna Buring and Nora-Jane Noone.  American viewers will probably recognize Noone from her role in ""The Magdalene Sisters,"" although she has less hair in ""The Descent.""  All of the cast do a wonderful job with their roles and do manage to muster some sympathy from the viewers even though their characters aren't developed too deeply.The visuals in this film are breathtaking in two ways:  the Scottish forests which double for the Appalachians are simply beautiful and the claustrophobic, dust-filled cavern squeezes tightly at even the most non-claustrophobic person's throat.  Director Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers) knows how to highlight the vibrant greens of the forests and does so wonderfully despite the carnage that awaits underground.  When the action does move into the dark, Marshall plays on the fears of the human mind by using limited visuals and near-constant dripping water, creaking noises, and violent growls, yelps, and screams.  By cutting off the viewer's vision, Marshall notches up the suspense.  He does sometimes rely on the ""boo!"" factor to get a few cheap thrills, but for the most part, Marshall keeps the suspense at a decent level and moves the film along at an agreeable pace.The DVD transfer is wonderful, with no flaws that I noticed.  The colors of the forests, as I've bragged on before, pop off of the screen and blood never looked better.  Special features include cast biographies, a documentary on the ""making of"" and other obligatory offerings.  My favorite extra, and one that I suggest viewing after watching the film to lighten the air a bit, is the outtakes reel.  The ""crawlers"" lose a bit of their fierceness in a hilarious bit in the outtakes.Overall, this is definitely one of the top horror films of late.  Is it a classic?  Probably not, but the fact is that when compared to other recent gorefests like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw,"" ""The Descent"" rises above them.  This is a definite purchase for fans of films like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  Sci-fi fans will appreciate this flick as well.  If you have a weak stomach or don't enjoy gory films in general, stay away.

It's been a very long time since I thought of a current horror movie as a 5 star event, so nothing could have surprised me more than ""The Descent.""The preliminary setup is a good one. Our heroines begin to explore some unknown, uncharted cave systems and quickly become trapped. Now our ladies must use their resourcefulness and intelligence to try to get out. The dynamics start to play out between the women--good and bad--and a real fear for survival starts to set in. We are squarely in a man versus nature psychological thriller atmosphere. It recalls for me ""Open Water""--a film whose horror is about helplessness and being stranded, not about sharks.But just as soon as I was sure where I was headed, the rug was pulled out. The last third becomes a monstrously bloody battle for survival. It is so well choreographed, I was sucked in wholeheartedly. And far from being victims--our heroines exhibit intelligence, brutality, resilience, loyalty and a real survival instinct. We've got some real female empowerment going on! For pure horror, this film goes out with a real bang.I was completely blindsided by this one. There's a good screenplay, a credible backstory, appealing actresses, great cinematography and nice effects.""The Descent"" may not be the ""best"" movie I see this year--but as a pure adrenaline rush, I promise you it will be one of my favorites.

A group of six female friends get together to explore what most of them believe will be a relatively benign group of caves in North Carolina. They're getting together for the first time a year after one of them, Sarah, lost her husband and daughter in a car accident. The ladies feel that if they get back to their adventuresome ways maybe Sarah can learn to forget the past and start living in the present. What they don't realize is that one of the women, Juno (an athletic, no-holds-barred, go-for-it kinda chick), has decided that they won't go to the caves they'd planned to and will instead explore a group of unknown caves that aren't even charted. She's hoping that this adventure will bring them closer together and help them get a little female bonding time. What she doesn't count on is an avalanche leaving them stranded in a group of caves that no one has ever heard of, and a group of cave dwelling creepy crawlers who begin to stalk them once they're stuck.This movie was, in a word, terrifying. I screamed out loud at several points. It made me glad that when I take a vacation there are hotels and shopping involved instead of wilderness and mystery. Lions Gate has a knack for releasing disturbing thrillers about everyday people who just sought to make their lives interesting by going on an adventure, like in Wolf Creek and The Descent. All I can say is I know who to turn to the next time I'm in the mood for a scary movie.

924105,AR3HV5WH2I4B2,B000A8NZ0O,"Kristopher KR ""Um, yeah.""","[1, 3]","I wasn't really expecting much from 'The Descent.'  From the description, a group of women go cave exploring.  Soon enough, the women come across a mysterious noise or two, which rightly so freaks them out.  After a bit, the women are trapped, scared, after taking a wrong turn, and in the dark.  The source of the frightning sounds shows its face and begins terrorizing the women. Violence and sudden jumps ensue.From the opening of the film, when three female friends are whitewater rafting, we can tell the ladies are lifelong pals and adventerous at heart.  Tragically, as one woman is driving home with her family, an accident occurs causing deep psychological and bodily harm to all in the vehicle.After a year, the woman decides to tag along with her friends again, along with another few women she meets.  They decide to go cave dwelling to live life on the edge and to let out any deep seeded agression.The tension grows minute by minute as the women explore the inner depths of the cave.  Danger lurks all around as either a long drop to the depths below are around the corner, or a potential cave in of the rocks surrounding the travelers may happen at a moments notice.The tension explodes when the friends come across a graveyard of bones mysteriously covering the ground in one portion of the dark cave.  They soon realize they are not alone.These women are trespassers upon the grounds of an unknown, pale grey, blind creature who are in no mood to give directions towards home.  Instead, they're hungry.The Descent brings to mind the 1987 film Predator.  Not only because of the gurgling noise heard long before than the appearance of the creature(s), but also because of the build up and psychology of the actions.Each advesary has their weakness.  This weakness must be discovered by the counterpart.  Each of them have an advantage, which they use to defeat the other.  There is a long time within the film which allows for more and more tension to be created.  There are minor jumps and scares here and there until the real roller coaster ride begins and the action commences.It may be true that there are a lot of cliches in this film which are seen in almost every horror movie made. However, The Descent puts a twist on one or two of these cliches. Women as victims, for example; Normally a woman is saved by their 'boyfriend' or whichever man happens to be in the general area.  But now, with women being the entire cast, each of them can be the heroes as well.  The sudden reveal of the enemy in the dark is another example.  Normally the first victim is easy picking and a slight gasp is heard among the audience.  With The Descent, things don't go quite that smoothly.Overall this is a very good film for someone who just wants to escape the mundane exsistence of everyday life and everyday horror films.  It's different, while at the same time remaining familiar.  I was on the edge of my seat and clinching my fists throughout.  My knuckles don't often turn white while viewing movies, but this time they did.Watch and enjoy!",4,The Decent,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,3054,"['was', ""n't"", 'really', 'expecting', 'much', ""'The"", 'Descent', 'description', 'group', 'women', 'go', 'cave', 'exploring', 'Soon', 'enough', 'women', 'come', 'mysterious', 'noise', 'two', 'rightly', 'so', 'freaks', 'out', 'bit', 'women', 'are', 'trapped', 'scared', 'taking', 'wrong', 'turn', 'dark', 'source', 'frightning', 'face', 'terrorizing', 'women', 'Violence', 'sudden', 'jumps', 'opening', 'film', 'when', 'three', 'female', 'friends', 'are', 'whitewater', 'rafting', 'can', 'tell', 'ladies', 'are', 'lifelong', 'pals', 'adventerous', 'heart', 'Tragically', 'one', 'woman', 'driving', 'home', 'family', 'accident', 'causing', 'deep', 'psychological', 'bodily', 'harm', 'vehicle.After', 'year', 'woman', 'tag', 'friends', 'again', 'few', 'women', 'meets', 'decide', 'go', 'cave', 'dwelling', 'live', 'life', 'edge', 'let', 'out', 'deep', 'seeded', 'agression.The', 'tension', 'grows', 'minute', 'minute', 'women', 'explore', 'inner', 'depths', 'cave', 'Danger', 'all', 'around', 'long', 'drop', 'depths', 'are', 'corner', 'potential', 'cave', 'rocks', 'surrounding', 'travelers', 'may', 'happen', 'moments', 'notice.The', 'tension', 'explodes', 'when', 'friends', 'come', 'graveyard', 'bones', 'mysteriously', 'covering', 'ground', 'one', 'portion', 'dark', 'cave', 'soon', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'alone.These', 'women', 'are', 'trespassers', 'grounds', 'unknown', 'pale', 'grey', 'blind', 'creature', 'who', 'are', 'mood', 'give', 'directions', 'home', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'hungry.The', 'Descent', 'mind', '1987', 'film', 'Predator', 'Not', 'only', 'gurgling', 'noise', 'heard', 'long', 'before', 'appearance', 'creature', 's', 'also', 'build', 'up', 'psychology', 'actions.Each', 'advesary', 'weakness', 'weakness', 'must', 'be', 'discovered', 'counterpart', 'have', 'advantage', 'use', 'defeat', 'other', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'more', 'more', 'tension', 'be', 'created', 'are', 'minor', 'jumps', 'scares', 'here', 'there', 'real', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'action', 'commences.It', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'are', 'lot', 'cliches', 'film', 'are', 'seen', 'almost', 'horror', 'movie', 'made', 'However', 'Descent', 'twist', 'one', 'two', 'cliches', 'Women', 'victims', 'example', 'Normally', 'woman', 'saved', ""'boyfriend"", 'whichever', 'man', 'be', 'general', 'area', 'now', 'women', 'being', 'entire', 'cast', 'can', 'be', 'heroes', 'as', 'well', 'sudden', 'reveal', 'enemy', 'dark', 'example', 'Normally', 'first', 'victim', 'easy', 'picking', 'slight', 'gasp', 'heard', 'audience', 'Descent', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'that', 'smoothly.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'escape', 'mundane', 'exsistence', 'everyday', 'life', 'everyday', 'horror', 'films', 'different', 'same', 'time', 'remaining', 'familiar', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'clinching', 'fists', 'knuckles', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'turn', 'white', 'viewing', 'movies', 'time', 'did.Watch', 'enjoy']","Descent,the Version anglais"

It's not some grand piece of cinema that's gonna make an impact on the world. It's not outstanding or a masterpiece. It doesn't have any superb actors to brag about. Nor, does it has any stunning special effects or cinematography. Frankly, I don't see what all the rave reviews are about, but I guess it's a matter of taste in this case, and this movie did leave a bad taste in my mouth. I really don't know what this movie was trying to prove besides the main characters could fight. True enough, they were women, and they were tough, but I'm not impressed by that becuase so are plenty other female leading ladies. This movie is just the female empowered version of ""The Cave"" with Cole Hauser. Only it's not as good, and it's a helluva lot bloodier. At least in ""The Cave"" they tried to explain to you what happened, and how those ""cave monsters"" became those ""cave monsters"", but this movie doesn't even do that. I hate it when they just throw me into the deep end of the movie without showing me how they got to that point first. I still have too many unanswered questions. Like, what the hell were those things? That's what I wanted to know more than anything, but they never explained it. How did they get down there? Afterall, were they mutated humans?, were they parasites?, were they aliens? I'm sorry, but I didn't just wanna see ""cave monsters"" flying and jumping around in the dark like acrobats without any kind of explaination. I mean, for all I know they could've been ""pod people"", ""body snatchers"" or ""seed people"". I know that might seem like a stretch, but this whole movie is a stretch. For me, the ending was just a teaser. What the hell was that about? Were they trying to say that the only survivor that we thought made it out of the cave didn't really get away, but she only dreamed she got away. Don't even get me started on the fact that they started leaving each other for dead. Why were these girls friends again?

And just as you're about to be eaten alive, you wake up sitting straight up in bed, soaked in sweat, your mouth open in a silent scream . . . . . . . . . . . . . sorry, this movie won't take you there.  This had good scare potential -- trapped in a cave with unknown creatures lurking about, but it went downhill once the real action began.  Yes, the scenes are dark & shadowy.  It's in a cave!  I don't have any complaints about the lighting.  It adds to the atmosphere.  Anyone, who's been in a cave, knows that lighting and filming in a cave, while maintaining realism would be challenging.  I agree with some of the other reviewers -- the Enquirer's bat boy was stolen!  The cave monsters were a little too humanoid, and lacked the physical adaptations for their apparent abilities -- claws, large ears, large, powerful jaws, large canines, maybe some sticky, gecko-like feet, etc.  Sure, these women might be physically fit, and it might've even made for some good film footage, but they'd be no match for prehistoric, meat-eating, underground cave dwellers!  The last scene between Sarah & Juno -- what the?!  After Juno went back for Sarah, no less!  You wouldn't wanna go spelunking (or anything else) with friends like these.  Vengeance for what?  The accidental death of another friend as Juno fought for her life while everyone else fled like rats before an earthquake, simultaneously abandoning an injured friend and leaving Juno to fight alone.  It's each woman for herself in this movie -- a good way to get yourself killed.  And if none of that makes this movie annoying enough, there's still the wishy washy ending.  You're left wondering how it really ended.  Did she or didn't she??  A big let down after so many rave reviews here.

She's a risk-taker, a spelunker, together with a group of female friends who like edging up close to death and feeling the thrill. But, with the accident, she apparently folds up, and her friends don't stick around to help.And so, sometime later, these ""friends"" agree to draw her out with an exciting new adventure -- caving in the depths of Appalachia. Maybe, they figure, the danger and excitement will reignite their friendships, and maybe their friend's life.And so, down we go into this gaping hole of a cave, deeper and deeper into the Earth ... and maybe the subconscious. Monsters of the Id and all that.But, if that sounds provocative, rest assured that The Descent is nothing more than a spoiled opportunity ... a half-baked, half-executed, and never more than spottily realized exercise. Sure, the cinematography is first rate, filled with interesting angles and colors. The cave scenes are spooky, and the claustrophobic moments work.But, sadly, we have a director who thinks that jarring and unexpected noises are the most profound way to frighten an audience ... and that if you introduce an undiscovered race of demonoid creatures, an audience will suspend all disbelief ... and that a horror movie can survive even if all of its human characters are entirely unsympathetic, and many downright unlikable.In the end, The Descent is a film version of a roller coaster ride.

Derasmo,"[0, 2]","I had reasonably low expectations of this film at the onset,since it takes quite a bit to actually unnerve me and the more recent ""horror"" films of late have been quite laughable. There are a few exceptions,Hostel entertained my gore side,Saw 2 was just a cool horror movie,and The Hills Have Eyes was a good horror/suspense flick.  I have yet to be entertained on more than one level which is why I guess its hard for me to imagine a horror flick that will truly hold my interest and unnerve me, however slightly,like the first Alien movie did. I must say,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie. Once again a low budget movie by the director of Dog Soldiers which was pretty darn good, and not a notably named actor in the bunch. The acting was pretty solid and the story was adequate enough that I didnt lose interest during the first half of the film,which was all leading up to the meat and potatoes. I am not like some reviewers and dont really care how the group of women met,it was evident to me they had been friends awhile and that was sufficient. It was established well enough that there was a strong bond between the characters,and just enough information shared about each one to allow for some empathy at their imminent demise. The real treat of this movie starts about halfway through,after they have been trapped in the cave and it becomes clear they are not alone. The level of confinement and paranoia is communicated quite well to the viewer,and the feeling of complete claustrophobia at times is very potent indeed. The gore was not overdone and not understated as in Dog Soldiers,and although the creatures immediately brought to mind Gollum from Lord of the Rings at first glance,further inspection shows them to be quite frightening. I think the real treat for me was the subtle plot twist toward the end,and after building to a violent crescendo the movie hits you with another little surprise treat. All in all Id say I was very entertained by this movie and found myself to be quite satisfied with it,to the degree that I would certainly watch it again.

Thanks to a Baptist minister father and an upbringing replete with information on the Forces of Darkness, I have also grown up with a (possibly unhealthy) fascination of dark and unknowable creatures.  On top of all of this, I like women.  Hence, THE DESCENT, a film about a group of women who go spelunking in caves filled with nasty beasties is (ideally) right up my alley.The basic story I've already pretty much summarized, although I neglected to mention that one of the women lost her husband and child a year before the cave dive, a detail that gains and loses importance depending on how you choose to interpret the film's dreary head-scratcher of a conclusion.  As the women battle with the creepy crawlies (and each other) in their search for a way out, their sanity (and the story) rapidly begins to fray.After puzzling over the film's final moments, I came up with an interpretation that I thought was sound, albeit disappointing.  I visited discussion boards on both Amazon and IMDB to see what other explanations were being tossed around by viewers, and what I discovered was that the movie has so many avenues for interpretation, it's difficult to argue that any one of them are more or less valid than the other.  The point being that even the director has said there are multiple ways to view the film.That sort of approach work quite well for dramas and even comedies, but in my opinion, psychological thrillers need some hedges around their possibilities, or else what you have falls prey to the old and dull It Was All A Dream cop-out.  That's not exactly what you have here (I don't think so, anyways), but the end result is similar: why watch a film if you can argue that the entire thing is nothing but an artfully constructed fantasy?At times it is scary, and it is often grotesque.  The creatures are well-done and the acting is great (the women, at times, are at least as scary as the cave cannibals), but without some kind of anchor in reality, the movie is little more than a bunch of ""Boos!"" and blood and a whole lot of confusion.

However, as usual in the genre things go wrong and they end up trapped in the cave with no map. At first their main concern is finding another exit from the cave and fighting the paranoia and claustrophobia that the dark, dank conditions of the cave create, but then they discover that that they are not alone in the cave, and the company has a taste for blood...The first fourty-five minutes of the movie is about charactor-development and building up suspence, which I think was very well done. The second part of the movie is all about action and gore, which is also very well done. This movie manages to have very well crafted horror and suspence as well as gorey deaths and buckets of blood. Few movies have been able to combine the two aspects of the horror genre as well as The Descent has.This movie is similar to the directors previous movie, Dog Soldiers and to another movie called Creep. It also had aspects of The Cave.The Descent is a suspenceful, gorey and origional horror movie and definatly one of my favourite post-2000 movies.

The actors are quite good, and writer-director Neil Marshall should be congratulated on the fact that he made a movie that scares the living lights out of the spectator.You are curious about the plot? Well, it involves six women that are old friends, and that meet in order to explore new caves, in an effort to cheer up one of them (Sarah, played by Shauna MacDonald) that has recently lost her family. However, things go horribly wrong when they get trapped in an unexplored cavern system, without maps of any kind. As if the claustrophobia factor were not enough, they will have to face the fact that they are not alone in the cave, as someone is hunting them. On top of that, one of the members of the group has a secret that could destroy her relationship with Sarah and the other women. That doesn't sound too scary, does it? Despite that, it is. You cannot stop watching, because you wish to know how the story ends, but there are times when you will feel the temptation of turning off the tv.I believe that many will love this movie, but that a lot of people will hate it. I can appreciate it as an excellent example of the horror genre, but I wouldn't rent it again. The reason is that, in my opinion, ""The descent"" is not for casual fans of horror movies. So, if you like actions movies with an ingredient of terror but are not really into scary stuff that looks too real, give ""Alien vs Predator"" a try and avoid this film. On the other hand, if you love horror movies that are extremely gruesome and you cannot detach from, you will probably love ""The descent"".

924137,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000A8NZ0O,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","Buoyed by a tremendously effective atmospheric horror and a claustrophobic sense of terror, THE DESCENT is indeed a riveting film experience, well directed by DOG SOLDIERS' Neil Marshall and containing good performances from its relatively all female cast.A group of six friends embark on a relatively routine spelunking adventure in the Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee.  The group includes a woman who lost her husband and daughter in a tragic auto accident one year earlier and whose stability is undoubtedly questionable.  They're not in the cave very long when the expedition's planner announces that this cave is one that has not been explored so no one knows that the group is in the cave.  A cave in traps the women and soon they find that they are not alone...something deadly is stalking them.Marshall builds tension incredibly well, and unlike most movies set subterraneanly, the lighting lets us see pretty well what happens, even if the frenetic camera work is sometimes disturbing.  There are some confusing moments regarding the accidental death of one of the team, and the typically ambiguous ending.

924138,A1VNYP0RD6VXIX,B000A8NZ0O,"Michael Hogan ""Constant Reader""","[2, 5]","The Descent is a rare movie.  It is both a wonderfully gory and scary horror film and a character study.  There's about 25 minutes or so of character introduction.  Although we don't learn a lot about most of the women, save for Sarah and Juno, we learn enough to feel the added suspense while they are in the caves.Before there is even a glimpse of one of the creatures, there are scenes that had me terrified.  I'm not especially claustrophobic, but I was very uncomfortable watching as the explorers squeezed their way through very tight spaces.  I found myself gripping the edges of my chair during one scene when two women become stuck.Once the creatures make their entrance, the suspense and terror are elevated.  The somewhat strained relations between the women become more so.  As they begin to trust each other less and less, the creatures become more prominent and the blood bath ensues.  There are more than a few ""jump out and scare ya"" moments that are very well done. And through it all, the intense level of suspense never relents.A superior horror film that is definitely not for everyone.  Anyone squeamish around tight spaces, intense terror, and gore may not like it.

924139,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000A8NZ0O,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","There are a few recipes for survival horror that I've learned over the years.  A good survival horror has the following:1) Emotional and psychological conflict.  By having some underlying conflict between two characters, we set the stage for a mental or physical breakdown of societal mores.  This conflict usually comes to a head under severe stress.  For example, in The Thing, the scientists and military personnel have a philosophical dispute on how to conduct their mission.  In Predator, Dutch and Dillon have a disagreement as to the nature of their mission.  All these issues boil long before a monster shows up.2) A hostile environment. The environment can be anything from the arctic (The Thing), to the ocean (Jaws), to a jungle (Predator). The hostile environment exerts pressure on our protagonists, forcing them together and preventing them from easily escaping.3) A monster.  Be it a shapeshifting creature (The Thing), a great white shark (Jaws), or a star spanning alien on safari (Predator), the monster sows discord and divides loyalties by creating an immediate sense of urgency.Stephen King uses all these elements to great effect.  But even with all three, authors often screw up the formula by having a weak conflict (if the characters aren't fleshed out enough, who cares if they die?), an environment that's easily escapable (why doesn't anyone ever call for help on their cell phone?), or the monster being cheesy (killer tomatoes? RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!).I'm pleased to report that The Descent hits every note perfectly.Three women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), and Beth (Alex Reid), a veritable trio of female empowerment, successfully complete a whitewater-rafting event.  The suspicious nature of Juno's relationship with Sarah's husband is subtly portrayed through glances and facial expressions alone.  When a car accident kills Sarah's husband and daughter, we have the grounds for a terrific emotional conflict.Fast forward to one year later: our protagonist decides to rejoin her two companions in another bonding experience by going ""caving."" Three other women join them.  We have the sister team of Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and Sam (MyAnna Buring), the older of the two being the more experience spelunker.  There's the confident hotshot, Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), who rushes into everything with abandon.  And then of course we have our other two characters, the supremely confident Juno and Sarah's friend, Beth, who dreads getting older and seems to have the most common sense of the bunch.Off they go, into the caves.  Only it's not just any cave, it's an unexplored cave that's only been recently discovered.  The terrain prevents easy ingress or egress and for much of the movie, the foreboding nature of the cave system is as much a danger as the monsters.Eventually, the monsters show up. I won't give away any details other than to say that they are terrible to behold.  The arrival of the beasties gives us the final piece of our survival horror movie.The Descent is beautifully shot; director Neil Marshall (he of Dog Soldiers, the best werewolf movie EVER) experiments with different forms of lighting, including red flares, blue phosphorous, green glow sticks, and yellow torches.  Flooding and cave-ins are around every corner, and we never forget that our protagonists are stuck in a cave.The characters are equally engaging.  Although it's clear from the beginning who will survive to the end, it never feels forced.  People die horribly, monsters get their comeuppance, and the conclusion leaves us with the certainty that violence is no way to solve anything.Lord John Whorfin once said that character is ""who you are in the dark."" We get the answer in Descent. Despite the attractive actresses playing the roles, this movie is literally a descent into the dark recesses of the soul.

I would like to know the other ending if anyone would care to explain. END OF ADDED INFO****The biggest problem with this film is lack of true character development. Having a woman lose her family in a car accident does not create a 3 dimensional character. Typical sub-plot about one friend fooling around with another's husband...blah..blah..blah. From the time this movie begins until they reach the cave is an excruciating example of bad character development. I didn't care about any of these people and when you don't care about the characters, the movie is in trouble.On the plus side, this movie has some creepy moments and it is extremely claustrophobic, but it's has some of the stupidest situations I've seen in any film. Do people actually do these crazy things? Why anyone would want to crawl into a small dark hole the size of a basketball in the middle of nowhere is beyond me! Once these characters put themselves into this predicament, I just couldn't wait for them to die! The creatures are very creepy and when they are on screen, it's quite tense, but it's too easy to make the audience jump in this dark setting, so I can't award too many points for those types of scares. Stupid people go to stupid place and die horrible deaths! I give it 2 1/2 stars. This film could have earned a 4 star rating with a few small changes. It's not unwatch-able, but it not all that good...unless you like pretending your buried alive!",2,MORONS!.....

924151,A2UD8A6JDZ8L4M,B000A8NZ0O,"Mr. Mike ""Sci Fi Guy""","[9, 17]","This movie started off about as refreshing as you could get. Sure, there were ""Lifetime channel"" moments and such but for a horror movie at least it didnt just dump a bunch of hapless teenagers in the woods for them to be hacked one by one.The atmosphere was eerie and convincing.  The cave shots were well done, the tension was building ever so slowly and it was somewhat un-nerving when you just knew that something bad was brewing.  So, the first part of the movie was thumbs up all the way.  Unfortunately, like sooooooo many other horror films it resorts to silly blood spatters and totally unbelievable situations and it gets old rather quickly.  The creative tension that got me hooked was quickly replaced by absurdity. Too much ketchup, too many frantic scenes of the ""monster guys"" jumping around, and of course...the completely silly ""tough"" chick that Kung-Fu'ed her way through most of the monsters like they were invalids. That alone killed it.... the main characters were disposing the bad guys too easily and some of the ways they killed them was laughable.  I was angry at this movie not so much because I wasted my time but because it had a lot of potential and seemed to run out of ideas so they went the ""Gorefest"" route and completely chickened out of making what could have been a classic if it was done right.Remember how perfectly the original Alien movie slowly but surely built wicked tension and it never released you from that tension?  Remember how uncomfortable that movie made you feel for almost the whole running time?  This film started that way.... it was very creepy and made me feel uneasy. Just like Alien.  However, Alien never let up and did NOT turn into a pointless gore-fest like this movie did.

Parker ""Hallowscorp""","[3, 4]","Neil Marshall, hot on the heels of his brisk & entertaining were-wolf debut ""Dog Soldiers"", comes up with another character-driven monster movie in the tradition of the classics ( Night of the Living Dead, Alien ).The story starts with a tragic event for the main character, after which we are introduced to the women with whom she is involved in a amatuer adventurer's club of sorts. During some casual 'hanging out' the characters have a chance to interact - we see some of their strengths and weaknesses + get hints at the tensions between them. Their banter comes off as reasonably convincing, while the intro as a whole is peppered with ominous bits of forshadowing.After some bad choices leave them stranded in a subterranean cavern, things go from bad to worse as they discover they are not alone... and that the other inhabitants may not be human. As the terror mounts, attacking mutants, human flaws and character conflicts lead most of the group to their doom. In the end, the viewer must decide which is worse: the mindless beast or the darkest, deepest pit of the human urge for self-preservation.Neil Marshall provides thrills and shocks of the visceral, you-are-there variety; the result is lean, mean and morally ambiguous. The production values and effects are stripped-down, favoring physical reality instead of overdone CG.As someone who avoids 'slasher flicks' ( sadistic humans killing their own kind ) in favor of horror with monsters or supernatural elements, this really hit the spot for me - delivering the primal horror.

Well, now that I've finally gotten around to seeing Neil Marshall's (Dog Soldiers, the upcoming Doomsday) bloody and incredibly frightening flick, and let me tell you, believe every bit of the hype that has surrounded it.  The story involves six female friends, going on their annual battle against nature by spelunking in a remote cave in the Appalachian mountains.  Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) had lost her husband and daughter the year before, and her survivalist friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza) harbors a secret.  After they get cut off underground, they all soon discover that they aren't alone, and are being hunted by crawling, nocturnal fiends.  While the film doesn't sound all that promising from reading its premise alone, The Descent ends up being one of the best pure and original horror films in the last few years.  Marshall creates an incredibly claustrophobic atmosphere, while pouring on the shocks and gore to boot.  The acting is great, and the film's climax and final images nearly elevate it above its horror roots.

As a BIG fan of Dog Soldiers, I have to say that it seems like the director wanted to go one direction, and the studio another.  The first half of the film that deals with ONLY the aspect of claustrophobia, separation, and a sense of impending doom, and anything that can go wrong in a cave is unbelievably intense.  The thought of being hundreds of feet underground with a titanic amount of rock overhead is a terrifying concept.  Then add being in a tunnel only high and wide enough to crawl through on your stomach, and THEN hearing the Earth rumble.  Then after you escape the rockslide, you find out that you're in a cave that is not mapped and nobody is coming to look for you.  Sounds intense?  It is, and the director conveys it masterfully.  Then for some reason, bat-people are thrown into the mix.  Not just any bat-people, but blind, blundering, soft-skulled bat-people that are wearing the same costumes as the Ubervamp and The Master, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Not kidding, EXACTLY the same.  For me, it really took the focus off of the true terror of the cave itself, and placed the focus on a threat that was really far fetched.  I have a hard time believing that a race of cave-dwelling bat-people has occupied a cave system for, according to the film at least 100 years, going unnoticed in the Appalachian Mountains in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA?!  It derails the attention from the isolation, claustrophobia, and terror of being trapped in the cave.  Additionally, the monsters are shown WAY too much.  The viewer can easily become desensitized since the beasts are forced constantly in the field of vision.

Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Aliens, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ring and now The Decent. Make no mistake about it... this horror is a bone-afide fully-fledged masterpiece that will have you on the edge of your seat well into the end credits. A group of six female buddies fronted by Juno (Natalie Mendoza) reunite to pit themselves against a forest cave only to stumble upon something exceptionally horrific, after they find themselves trapped following a rock fall. Deep underground their friendship worsens as they undergo a frantic struggle to survive. Part action, mostly horror, The Decent gets you right in there with the claustrophobia, crawling through tight spaces to suddenly unleash a bloodbath of absolute horror. When the screaming starts it does not stop and although there are many moments that I would love to review I would be doing you a great disservice to spoil any of it for you, including what is down in the caves. Take my word for it. When things get going this is the white knuckle ride you have been longing for. It is thoroughly violent and extremely upsetting for the sum of its fiendish parts. Just go watch it alone in the dark and then watch it again with your friends. You will be glad that you did. And calling this a Horror Cult Gem, means exactly what it says. This one is a keeper that can sit quite comfortably next to the best that are out there... and then some more. Don't even read past this review. Don't try and find any spoilers.

True some of the gore was pretty bad (both gross bad, and unrealistic ""70's slasher"" bad at different points) but I really enjoyed this movie. Even the cheap scares were not at places where I expected them, and they didn't take up the majority of the movie. I loved the opening giving the background of the women, letting us peak into their lives and get to know them just enough to care about them once they get down there. It also gives the set up for the internet war over what really happened (SORT OF A SPOILER- were the monsters real or a figment of an insane party member's depraved mind?). My husband and I watched this while cleaning the house and I must admit... we both found ourselves standing about 3 feet from the TV just holding our cleaning supplies and watching. We eventually gave up on the cleaning until after the movie ended since it enthralled us both so much. I loved the group dynamic, and to have a horror film with excellent, realistic acting is a rarity. I LOVED it. The feel was similar to the original Alien in that it was dark, clautrophobic, and very tense. The fact that the cast members did not simply scream and give in to their grusome deaths made it even better. It's nice to see people fighting back when their lives are on the line. Is this film an academy award winner? No... but it IS a good solid horror film with excellent acting, a few good jumps, a creepy feel, a believable (monsters not included) plot, and realistic dialogue that though often funny, never sacrifices it's integrity for a laugh.

I did expect the survival element to be present but the adding on the creeper twist (don't know if there's a name for these creatures, I streamed the movie) made the movie much deeper and more engaging for the viewer.I really liked how these characters went through mini story arcs throught the film, dealing with trust, emotional recovery, clustrophobia, bringing out man's inner beast and relationships between characters. Also I liked how even when I knew one character and the viewer was about to get scared, no matter how many times I said ""Scare in 2 seconds"" I couldn't stop myself from shuddering violently.Now there are three problems I have: one when the death scenes start it felt like characters were dying stupidly (later I found out that none of them died stupidly), 2nd the husbend at the beginning has an important role in the relationship between two of the females but it is extremely easy to miss. Hint he has a saying that comes up during the latter half of the movie. Finally while I don't mind the original ending for being different, I think the US version ended the film better, even though I usually complain yet expect those endings.

924186,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000A8NZ0O,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","I was leery about seeing this film.  I like a good scare and gore doesn't bother me.  But what I don't like is cheap exploitation.  Lion's Gate has previously released stuff like SAW, HOSTEL and WOLF CREEK, which are all graphic, but more to the point, very unpleasant to watch. Unpleasant in a way that makes you feel like you just watched something very unseemly and need to take a shower.So I heard some good buzz about THE DESCENT, but still felt trepidation.  I'm glad I ignored my instinct in this case.  THE DESCENT is in many ways the best film of the summer.  It is promising to deliver something, and it delivers and then some!!  Most other summer films (much larger) either promised and fell short (such as POSEIDON or MI:3) or promised and came close to achieving (X-MEN 3 or PIRATES 2).  THE DESCENT, while modest in scale, budget and ambition was a stunner.You probably know the basic story, but quickly...it is about 6 British women who come to America to explore a cave in the Appalachians.  Only what 5 of them don't know is that their 6th friend has purposely led them to a scarcely known, totally unexplored, off-the-map cave with the goal of getting to name the place after themselves.Surprise, surprise...the plan doesn't go so well.  They get into a great deal of trouble, and in many ways, the scariest part of the film is when you are actually able to get a sense of what it would be like to be about a mile underground, in an unmarked cave, with your only known way out hopelessly blocked, and no idea of what lies ahead.  It literally made me shudder.  Through much of the film, nothing ""supernatural"" happens, and frankly, it was a pretty darn exciting bit of work even then.  But finally, the cave-dwelling mutants who will apparently eat anything they hear are introduced...and all hell breaks loose.The confrontations with the mutants are horrific, noisy, sometimes graphic and yet somehow shot with a just a bit of taste and restraint.  That's not to say that blood and bone doesn't spray, that horrible disembowlings don't ensue, etc...but the dark of the cave leaves most of it somewhat to our imaginations.  We see glimpes of the grotesque, but not all of it.  The camera doesn't linger over the gore...there's too much else going on.The best thing about the film, in my opinion, is that all 6 of these women (all very different characters) are intelligent, witty, smart and atheletic.  They don't make too many stupid mistakes.  There are moments when their athleticism is brought to bear, and it is refreshing convincing.  These actresses, who no doubt trained and buffed up some for the film, don't LOOK like actresses who just trained and got buff for a film.  They look like people who know what they're doing.  And while the director and writer don't take a lot of time to establish deep characters (there is a cliched scene early on when they all get together at the cabin, get drunk and laugh when we get to sort of see each of them in the daylight and know who they are), we still emphasize with all of them...even the ""villian"" of the piece.  I liked all the performances, and all these women should feel proud to have been in a ""slasher"" movie where they give back nearly as good as they got.The dynamics between the women are pretty interesting as well, and it's remarkable just how cold-blooded they are allowed to be towards each other.  This isn't a film where the survivors get together, despite their bickering, and find the way out through the monsters.  They separate, they turn on each other, they form loose groups and unform them as well.  It's a great way to add richness to what is afterall a genre film we all know pretty well.I HIGHLY recommend this film.  Why no 5th star?  Well, the very end of the film is not so great (although I'm sure the original ending will be restored for DVD) and the cabin scene was less than stellar on the part of the director.  But the other 80 out of 85 minutes are true edge-of-your-seat stuff.

Here's the saving grace: by the time the bad guys show up, you'll probably be too creeped out to care.Marshall (who previously directed the underrated thriller Dog Soldiers) gives us the tale of Sarah (Late Night Shopping's Shauna MacDonald), an extreme-adventure-loving kind of gal, who with her friends and constant companions Beth (Last Orders' Alex Reid) and Juno (Hotel Babylon's Natalie Mendoza), does silly things like go whitewater rafting on rivers that could kill all of them. Her safe, boring husband (Paranoid's Oliver Milburn) and their daughter Jessica (newcomer Molly Kayll) are ironically killed in a car accident, and Sarah has a nervous breakdown. A year later, when she has seemingly recovered, Juno invites her and Beth on a caving expedition in rural North Carolina along with Becka (Saskia Mulder, late of The Beach), Holly (The Magdalene Sisters' Nora-Jane Noone), and Sam (MyAnna Buring, recently of the remake of The Omen). The six of them head off to the cave, and find themselves trapped after a minor earthquake shifts some rock in a narrow tunnel they've just come through. Worse, they find they're not alone...The first half of this movie should probably be avoided by anyone who has claustrophobia issues. It is here that the film's real capacity for fear lies-- in a bunch of people crawling through very small passages with thousands of tons of rock above them. During one particular scene, I was curled up in my seat eating my own hand. (You'll know it when you see it.) It is soon after that that the bad guys show up, and the movie becomes a pretty typical survival thriller, though Marshall does throw in a few twists and turns along the way that, unlike the popping-out-at-you cheap thrills of most survival thrillers, really do hit home on occasion. (Most, unfortunately, have little to do with the bad guys.) The raging exception is the film's final scene, about which I was prepared to rage for most of this review until I found out that about ninety seconds of the original cut of the film was lopped off at the end (the original footage can be seen at YouTube until the DVD shows up, for those interested). Someone in Hollywood needs to lose a job over the loss of those ninety seconds, which entirely change the tone and meaning of the film, tie up at least one major loose end, and add new shades of subtext to the title. If you see the film, hop on YouTube soon after and check out what you missed; without it, the last shot is typical cheap horror-film fare. (And it works that way in the original cut as well, but its impact is considerably lessened by its not being the actual last shot of the film.)I sound like a broken record in today's reviews, but I have to say it again, like I said for Bad Lieutenant and Lifeboat: this is not really a movie about going down into a cave and fighting for your life. This is a movie about characters-- most notably Sarah, but also Juno. It's the way they react to their surroundings, how they come to make the snap decisions they have to make in order to survive, the way the stress of the situation transforms them, that makes this, ultimately, a very worthwhile movie. It's well worth your time.American cut: *** Original cut: ****",4,"Wonderful, right up until...",1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,3358,"['Descent', 'Neil', 'Marshall', '2005', 'Here', 'big', 'letdown', 'Descent', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'less', 'scary', 'when', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'up', 'Here', 'saving', 'grace', 'time', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'up', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'too', 'creeped', 'out', 'care.Marshall', 'who', 'previously', 'directed', 'underrated', 'thriller', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'tale', 'Sarah', 'Late', 'Night', 'Shopping', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'extreme-adventure-loving', 'kind', 'gal', 'who', 'friends', 'constant', 'companions', 'Beth', 'Last', 'Orders', 'Alex', 'Reid', 'Juno', 'Hotel', 'Babylon', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'silly', 'things', 'go', 'whitewater', 'rafting', 'rivers', 'could', 'kill', 'safe', 'boring', 'husband', 'Paranoid', 'Oliver', 'Milburn', 'daughter', 'Jessica', 'newcomer', 'Molly', 'Kayll', 'are', 'ironically', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Sarah', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'year', 'later', 'when', 'seemingly', 'recovered', 'Juno', 'Beth', 'caving', 'expedition', 'rural', 'North', 'Carolina', 'Becka', 'Saskia', 'Mulder', 'late', 'Beach', 'Holly', 'Magdalene', 'Sisters', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'Sam', 'MyAnna', 'Buring', 'recently', 'remake', 'Omen', 'six', 'head', 'cave', 'find', 'trapped', 'minor', 'earthquake', 'shifts', 'rock', 'narrow', 'tunnel', ""'ve"", 'just', 'come', 'Worse', 'find', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'should', 'probably', 'be', 'avoided', 'anyone', 'who', 'claustrophobia', 'issues', 'here', 'film', 'real', 'capacity', 'fear', 'lies', 'bunch', 'people', 'crawling', 'very', 'small', 'passages', 'thousands', 'tons', 'rock', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'was', 'curled', 'up', 'seat', 'eating', 'own', 'hand', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'soon', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'up', 'movie', 'pretty', 'typical', 'survival', 'thriller', 'Marshall', 'throw', 'few', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'popping-out-at-you', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'most', 'survival', 'thrillers', 'really', 'do', 'hit', 'home', 'occasion', 'Most', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'bad', 'guys', 'raging', 'exception', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'prepared', 'rage', 'most', 'review', 'found', 'out', 'about', 'seconds', 'original', 'cut', 'film', 'was', 'lopped', 'off', 'end', 'original', 'footage', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'YouTube', 'DVD', 'up', 'interested', 'Someone', 'Hollywood', 'needs', 'lose', 'job', 'loss', 'ninety', 'seconds', 'entirely', 'change', 'tone', 'meaning', 'film', 'tie', 'up', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'loose', 'end', 'add', 'new', 'shades', 'subtext', 'title', 'see', 'film', 'hop', 'YouTube', 'soon', 'check', 'out', 'what', 'missed', 'last', 'shot', 'typical', 'cheap', 'horror-film', 'fare', 'way', 'original', 'cut', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'considerably', 'lessened', 'not', 'being', 'actual', 'last', 'shot', 'film', 'sound', 'broken', 'record', 'today', 'reviews', 'have', 'say', 'again', 'said', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Lifeboat', 'not', 'really', 'movie', 'going', 'down', 'cave', 'fighting', 'life', 'movie', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Sarah', 'also', 'Juno', 'way', 'react', 'surroundings', 'how', 'come', 'make', 'snap', 'decisions', 'have', 'make', 'order', 'survive', 'way', 'stress', 'situation', 'ultimately', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'time.American', 'cut', 'Original', 'cut', '****']","Descent,the Version anglais"
924189,AK1OBVI54SY73,B000A8NZ0O,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[1, 3]","I thought this movie was going to be no better than the hundreds of other horror movies out I painfully watched. Nonetheless, the Descent is a lot better than they.Now I don't think this movie is amazing as so many others here think, but it actually was a horror film that had me on the edge of my seat. For awhile it is pretty easy- going, with they just getting to the cave and beginning the journey into it, but eventually they get into some trouble that eventually leads them to some odd but nothing too scary of creatures. I mean they're ugly creatures, but are they really scary? No not really. But dangerous? Very much so. That's what keeps you on the edge of your seat is knowing it will not be easy at all to evade these creatures- especially when you have no idea where to run to finally escape them.This movie is dark, very dark actually to the point where you might be moving up close to screen just to see what is going on- which I didn't like to do- and the acting was pretty average. Nothing too bold, but the actors weren't lame either. A few of the women were pretty forgettable though. The creatures again were nothing really compared to some of the monsters I've seen in other films and the gore I felt was maybe done a little bit too much at times just to sicken us viewers.What was good about this film though was the feeling of confusion and the utter fear of possibly never getting out of the cave, while those life threatening creatures were just a few steps behind or ahead of you. This movie gives real chills because of that, and that is refreshing after sheer boredom of so many other new films.I recommend it to watch at least once. I would watch it again.3.5/5",4,Not What I Expected...,1167264000,"12 28, 2006",2006,1690,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'no', 'better', 'hundreds', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'out', 'painfully', 'watched', 'Nonetheless', 'Descent', 'lot', 'better', 'they.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'amazing', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'think', 'actually', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'pretty', 'easy-', 'going', 'just', 'getting', 'cave', 'beginning', 'journey', 'eventually', 'get', 'trouble', 'eventually', 'odd', 'nothing', 'too', 'scary', 'creatures', 'mean', ""'re"", 'ugly', 'creatures', 'are', 'really', 'scary', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'dangerous', 'Very', 'much', 'so', 'what', 'edge', 'seat', 'knowing', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'evade', 'creatures-', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'run', 'finally', 'escape', 'them.This', 'movie', 'dark', 'very', 'dark', 'actually', 'point', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'moving', 'up', 'close', 'screen', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'on-', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'do-', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'average', 'Nothing', 'too', 'bold', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'lame', 'either', 'few', 'women', 'were', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'creatures', 'again', 'were', 'nothing', 'really', 'compared', 'monsters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'gore', 'felt', 'was', 'maybe', 'done', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'just', 'sicken', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'feeling', 'confusion', 'utter', 'fear', 'possibly', 'never', 'getting', 'cave', 'life', 'threatening', 'creatures', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'steps', 'ahead', 'movie', 'real', 'chills', 'refreshing', 'sheer', 'boredom', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'new', 'films.I', 'recommend', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'would', 'watch', 'again.3.5/5']","Descent,the Version anglais"

When it comes to horror films, I usually enjoy movies that build the tension and then go for a good scare instead of typical slasher films or movies that focus only on gore.  So this sounded like it was right up my alley.Visually the film is extremely effective.  The caverns and caves look very real, and for anyone who gets claustrophobic, this movie is one to steer clear from.  The lighting also well done, giving us enough to see by, but also providing lots of shadows that movie and twist as the light sources move.  Sound and music are also very effective, heightening mood and providing lots of good scares.  How about the gore?  Well the movie does have some bloody bits in it, but the most disturbing section was a broken bone peaking out of the skin and needing to be reset.  The combination of the sounds, the visuals, and the acting made me squirm in my seat.The story itself is simple.  Five women go into an uncharted cave, get trapped deep within the ground and find horrible creatures that want to devour them.  However Neil Marshall who wrote and directed the film gives us a bit more.  Each of the five women have their own histories, personalities and weaknesses.  We get to know them a bit before the adventure begins, and when things start going bad, we learn even more.  This intricacy works for and against the movie.  On the one hand, it creates believable characters, who you root for and sympathize with.  On the flip side, it provided a couple of interesting places for the movie to go, and yet it seemed that movie went with the most obvious and least satisfying path.  I don't want to say more without giving away spoilers, but I think the movie could have worked even better as a psychological horror, instead of a monster movie.The acting is stand out.  All five women give great performances.  Since each of the characters has a distinct personality and history, this gave them more to work with and each of them does a great job.  It was also nice to see fresh faces in these roles.  My only minor quibble was their diverse accents made some of the dialogue a bit difficult to catch.  The folks playing the monsters do a great job as well.  They don't have dialogue but thier movements convey all the hunger and threat you need.This is a very good horror film, much better than the recent stuff we've been getting lately  It was scary, disturbing, and moved at a good pace.  I confirmed that I never want to go cave diving... ever.  It also confirmed that good horror films can still be made in this day and age.  I look forward to Mr. Marshall's next film.",4,"The deeper they go, the more disturbing it gets.",1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,2698,"['heard', 'lots', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'theaters', 'again', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'DVD', 'When', 'horror', 'films', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'build', 'tension', 'then', 'go', 'good', 'scare', 'instead', 'typical', 'slasher', 'films', 'movies', 'focus', 'only', 'gore', 'So', 'sounded', 'was', 'right', 'alley.Visually', 'film', 'extremely', 'effective', 'caverns', 'caves', 'look', 'very', 'real', 'anyone', 'who', 'claustrophobic', 'movie', 'one', 'steer', 'clear', 'lighting', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'giving', 'enough', 'see', 'also', 'providing', 'lots', 'shadows', 'movie', 'twist', 'light', 'sources', 'move', 'Sound', 'music', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'heightening', 'mood', 'providing', 'lots', 'good', 'scares', 'How', 'gore', 'Well', 'movie', 'have', 'bloody', 'bits', 'most', 'disturbing', 'section', 'was', 'broken', 'bone', 'peaking', 'skin', 'needing', 'be', 'reset', 'combination', 'sounds', 'visuals', 'acting', 'made', 'squirm', 'seat.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Five', 'women', 'go', 'uncharted', 'cave', 'get', 'trapped', 'deep', 'ground', 'find', 'horrible', 'creatures', 'want', 'devour', 'However', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'five', 'women', 'have', 'own', 'histories', 'personalities', 'weaknesses', 'get', 'know', 'bit', 'adventure', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'bad', 'learn', 'even', 'more', 'intricacy', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'believable', 'characters', 'who', 'root', 'sympathize', 'flip', 'side', 'provided', 'couple', 'interesting', 'places', 'movie', 'go', 'yet', 'seemed', 'movie', 'went', 'most', 'obvious', 'least', 'satisfying', 'path', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'even', 'better', 'psychological', 'horror', 'instead', 'monster', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'stand', 'out', 'five', 'women', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'characters', 'distinct', 'personality', 'history', 'gave', 'more', 'work', 'great', 'job', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'fresh', 'roles', 'only', 'minor', 'quibble', 'was', 'diverse', 'accents', 'made', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'difficult', 'catch', 'folks', 'playing', 'monsters', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'dialogue', 'thier', 'movements', 'convey', 'hunger', 'threat', 'need.This', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'recent', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'lately', 'was', 'scary', 'disturbing', 'moved', 'good', 'pace', 'confirmed', 'never', 'want', 'go', 'cave', 'diving', 'ever', 'also', 'confirmed', 'good', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'made', 'day', 'age', 'look', 'forward', 'Mr.', 'Marshall', 'next', 'film']","Descent,the Version anglais"

924193,A387BD735MI50R,B000A8NZ0O,R. Schultz,"[1, 4]","This movie follows the long-standing convention of having friends talk to each other in flippancies. No one really communicates with anyone else here. This group of women who get together periodically to empower themselves by engaging in some grueling sports challenges - flip off, swear at, and breeze past each other. When confronted with amazing natural phenomena and obstacles, their reaction is also generally not awe and certainly never poetry. It's usually just another curse. Few, if any, meaningful sentences are exchanged.I know our society has grown increasingly rude and raunchy. But when I get together with women friends, we don't talk that way. We still do hunker down and talk more earnestly about politics and the environment - and most of all - about things of the heart. However movie directors seem to think it's more modern and visually arresting to have groups of young ""friends"" just bash and banter against each other in the most superficial ways.The trouble with following this format, especially in a movie like ""Descent,"" is that we don't get to know or care about any of the characters. I couldn't distinguish one gal-pal from another most of the time. This trouble was compounded by the fact that most of the action takes place in a cave where there is only the dim orange, smudgy, glow from various flares to shed any light at all on the characters.When the movie's menace appears though, there are some genuinely wrenching, suspenseful scenes. If only it was all happening to someone we knew and identified with more.The two DVD director commentaries are generally a waste of time. They are annoying frat house laugh-overs. If you do take the time to listen to one or both of them though, don't do it right after the movie. Let some time elapse, or else you will ruin whatever grim, gripping emotional impact the movie might have had on you.However the ""Behind the Scenes"" bonus feature is worthwhile. It shows how some of the movie's special effects were painstakingly created, and it shows some of the lively family-like atmosphere that develops among movie cast and crew members. (If only some of that sort of chemistry had gotten translated to the characters on-screen!)The Bonus Material also contains interesting information about alternate endings that were considered for ""Descent."" In spite of the director's/writer's guffawing, superficial intent throughout much of this film, I think they hit on the right ending after all. The one they went with opens the door to new subtleties of interpretation. And it leaves a poignantly haunting last image.

924195,A34TI9P66QGT0N,B000A8NZ0O,SB,"[4, 5]","Mini review.  I'm basically writing it to give this movie another 5 star vote.This is a great film.  It is off the Hollywood grid and that makes for a very gritty, down and dirty feel-- the opposite of the slick junk American studios turn out.The characters are really well written and acted.  It is a treat to see a film starring all females-- adult, fully developed, strong females, who never mention shopping.The story has a lot to say about human nature.  It is also incredibly visceral, terrifying, and sickening.  I would have been scared and filled with dread if they had just stuck to getting trapped in a cave.

WARNING:  Jeff Long wrote a fantastic book called 'The Descent'.  When I first heard of this movie I thought at last they had made the book into a movie.  Wrong.  The only things the book and the movie have in common are the name and something creepy underground.Six women, Sarah, Juno, Beth, Rebecca, Sam and Holly, love get togethers that include extreme adventures, such as white water rafting.  The ladies haven't gotten together since Sarah lost her family in a car accident.  Now, several months later, they're ready to take off again, this time on a deep cave spelunking adventure.  After venturing into the cave, crawling through an amazingly tight tunnel which collapses behind them, Juno admits she didn't bring the map because this isn't the cave everyone thought they were exploring.  It's a new, unexplored cave, one where they could have made a name for themselves by exploring.  The problem now becomes finding a way out.Deeper and deeper they go, until they come upon a chamber filled with bones.  Here they meet an unexpected welcoming party, a group of ghastly albino beings who see humans as simply another source of food.  The girls fight off the beasts, get separated, get re-united, and all the while the body count begins to pile up.'The Descent' is a good horror flick with plenty of gory eye gouging and head slicing to feed your taste for blood, but at the same time is a bit formulaic.  Another problem is that although its being filmed in a dark cave, the fights are too dark, too fast, and choppily edited making the best parts far too hard to see and follow.  There are still some scenes that will make you jump out of your seat, and a few surprises in the script that keeps this film from being just another splatter film.  Rent first.

Horror movies lately just seem redundant and extremely unoriginal; TCM: The Beginning anyone?Anyways, this a movie actually worth sitting through.  The best part to it is its environment.  The tight spaces that the girls have to work there way through is just amazing.  If you are claustrophobic, just imagine yourself crawling through them little rock tunnels and having part of the cave collapse all around you.  Scary eh?  The plot is pretty average.  There isn't really anything special about it, but it makes for an entertaining watch.  The acting is surprisingly above par for an non-All-Star cast.  The movie can also be suspenseful at times, but that is mainly due to the environment in my opinion.  I was kind of disappointed with the monsters.  They just didn't really heighten the fright-factor to the movie at all.  The one thing they did heighten was the gore factor, which is satisfying to the gore hounds.  Something that I couldn't help but notice multiple times in this flick and is so redundant with lots of other horror movies as well that I am getting really tired of is the CLASH-BANG scare techniques.  Can you not be any more unoriginal?But overall, despite the many minor flaws, this movie is a good watch.  It is alot better than the other crapola that has been coming out the past couple years.Oh, one more thing.  When jessica falls and hits her head near the end of the movie, she starts dreaming.

924204,AVI158V7UOB2B,B000A8NZ0O,Sir Cinephiliac,"[1, 1]","I've noticed several people who offered poor reviews on this film, and really gave little indication as to why. I can only imagine that they did not see what I saw when I watched ""The Descent"" for the first time. For everyone else who hasn't seen this film yet, I would like to contribute three suggestions to ensure a more enjoyable viewing experience.Suggestion one, if you have a short attention span, don't watch this movie! Go watch Saw, or some other fast-paced hack & slash that won't make you have to think much or feel for the characters. This movie's strength lies in strong character development, and gradual progression of suspense that takes up a good half of the film.Suggestion two, watch this movie ALONE... no friends or buddies you can pretend to be cool around by calling something lame, cheesy, or predictable. Yes, this movie has some cliche moments, but you should hardly be able to notice it if you are as fully immersed in the macabre and tense atmosphere of these dreaded caves as I was.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, use your imagination. Of course, with certain very graphic scenes, you will need to leave little to the imagination, but particularly in the first half of the movie where not much in the way of action really happens, the viewing experience hinges on YOU, the viewer. Try to really immerse yourself into the state of mind of the characters and see yourself in their world, not as some distant, impervious third party. Let down your guard a bit, and you will be surprised at what you may find. The effectiveness of this movie relies on its believability, and as you descend into this forbidding cave with these girls as your only companions, and you somehow do not feel, at least in part, their edginess, claustrophobia, despair, and pain, you will never truly appreciate their experience. Try to place yourself in the darkness, faced with having to crawl through a space barely wider than the span of your shoulders, hardly able to breath or move, and fully aware that the thousands of tons of rock above you may collapse at any moment... all this aside from the hungry, gut-ripping monsters that come onto the scene later!

The claustrophobic angles and dark, nearly pitch black lighting really gave it an effect I haven't seen since Pitch Black. The creatures were well done and nearly believable, and quite frightening. I would hate to be in the caves with them. Since this was a horror/thriller, the story wasn't expected to be very dense, and the characters weren't expected to be atypical, and this is usually the fault with this genre. If you want to terrify the audience, you need to identify with the victims and get to care for them. In this film we're just barely introduced to them enough to get to know their stereotype. But all of this doesn't matter when they enter the cave system and we see the beautiful underworld. This cave has never been mapped, so this is the greatest adventure these spelunkers could hope for, until the crawlspaces collapse behind them. With no way back, they move onward looking for an exit when the dark, confined spaces start to take a toll on their minds. But being stuck under the earth is the least of their worries.

A tunnel that you came through is sealed off leaving you only one way to go...down. And your partner reveals the reality that a guide didn't recommend the caves at all; she thought it would make the excursion more adventurous in unexplored caves. There is no charted way out.Think that's a problem? How about shining your light down the next tunnel where you see an eerie human-ish looking figure crouched in the dark peering back at you?The Descent has chills. There's high suspense. It goes without saying that there are good old fashioned jump-out-of-the-dark scares (they are in a cave!). No special effects needed here to generate excitement.

Yes, I know they were setting up the scenario, but it wasn't really necessary and once the main part of the movie started it felt like those scenes had been cheaply and shoddily tacked on to give a completely unbelievable movie a bit of reality.  Which didn't work.  It's a horror flick, just start out with people getting together for whatever reason to go explore dark and scary caves on an ill-advised trip.  I don't think most of the audience cares why - we came to this movie willing to suspend our disbelief, run with that.Once the adventure starts I began to like the movie more.  I know it's just a shallow horror flick but there were some genuinely interesting interactions within the group.  If you want to over-analyze it you could, because the reactions and actions of several of the group members were very well-done, considering the situation they found themselves in.  I found myself drawn into the storyline and pulled along with the characters.  The 'monsters' were good, just the right touch of frightening without being ludicrous.But then... then there was the end.  And what would have been an okay movie was completely ruined by an end scene that made (at least in my mind) no sense whatsoever.  I can't really say more without ruining the ending, but I can't wrap my brain around what was supposed to have happened and what the filmmakers were trying to imply with the last bit.So there was a bit of decent action-horror capped with a boring beginning and a confusing end, leaving a bad last impression.

I love creature films and indications were this would be a good-budget, well acted change from the cheesy norm.It has a fantastic 1/2 hour, that being the last 1/2 hour.  Until then it's little more than a National Geographic caving episode with a few cautious over-the-shoulder glances from a character or two thrown in, and creepier music.  Although some scenes may have you nibble a fingernail or two, it's more because of some spelunking challenge than any genuine sense of dread building toward the attacks you know are coming.I give it credit for having a female cast that doesn't sit around and cry, stand and scream, or trip every time they try to run.  Good performances of strong, no-nonsense women here and all the better for it.But we're back to that last 1/2 hour thing.

924212,A1AN4ZZ43SKLOE,B000A8NZ0O,Spooxster,"[1, 1]","As hard as it is to do these days, I watched this movie having not even seen a trailer or had the plot/key moments revealed through word of mouth. After watching the prerequisite introduction of the main character with a big black stain on her psyche from a personal trauma, I was ready for a ride through clich&eacute;-land.  However, at almost every point where a clich&eacute; starts coming into play, there is at least a slight twist to it that pleasantly surprises and further clinches ones interest.  The characters are well acted and obviously written with thoughtful attention.  Watching the main character's center shift as she is forced to confront her environmental situation along with her perceptions of those around her was enthralling.The first half of the movie was an exercise of psychological tension (assuming somewhere in you is the tiniest bit susceptible to claustrophobia) and really gives a sense of the women having the true bond of long-term friendship and love for each other.  By the halfway mark I was already going to be just fine with the rest of the movie being similar, but then a wonderfully eerie moment marks the beginning of a smooth transition to a much faster-paced, action-driven story.The second half retains the psyche-thumping moments of the first while radically changing the stakes of survival.  While the first half of the movie does inform you that this movie won't be bashful with displaying personal injury, the second half does not elect to throw gore-for-gore's sake moments at you, but instead deftly uses such events to cause 'Wham!-your tension meter just went up yet another notch, and yes, you did just clench whatever/whoever happens to be next to you' reactions.The final moments come in two flavors: Original UK and US.  I got to see the US ending, but afterwards read other reviews and learned of the UK ending.  Both are quite fitting, although I do wish I would have experienced the UK ending first, so if given a choice I would recommend going that route.The Descent is a truly excellent foray into the often-tread, seldom-inspired, cookie-cutter realm of horror movies.

O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","What ""Star Wars"" did for space-oriented special effects and the documentary ""Winged Migration"" did for aerial cinematography, ""The Descent"" does for the whole world of the subterranean.  Taking place largely in underground caves and tunnels, that whole exotic, dangerous, world is captured in all its rocky beauty.  And then, having established itself as a bona fide landmark in the craft of capturing this kind of envirornment, it injects into it a relentless horror as some of the most ghastly and yet believable monsters in moviedom begin to stalk the six spelunkers who've come exploring these seldom-seen-by-human-eyes tunnels and caverns.The six friends meet periodically for this kind of adventure, and in this case it's the first time in a while they've all been together, with the spectre of a tragic accident that occured during a white-water trek the previous year still hanging over them.  Hidden tensions begin to crop up once underground, once the tunnels turn out to be more treacherous than counted on, and they're already deep and off course when some of the members of the expedition begin to suspect that they're not alone down there.  Their fears are dismissed as claustrophobic delusions by other members of the group as the passages get tighter, the chasms more difficult to cross.  As they try to progress, clear evidence of past explorers in these inaccessible tunnels is found, and the fear of something as yet unseen begins to increase.Gorgeously shot - with many scenes lit only by the red light of flares - and featuring universally fine performances and outstanding special effects, The Descent goes on to be even more than the sum of its parts, and is one of the best horror movies of the last few years.

924216,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000A8NZ0O,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[1, 1]","This was truly a horrifying movie to experience and I do mean experience with a capital E!  Many others here have already outlined the plot so I'm just going to give you what I enjoyed about this little film that will be a classic one day.The title alone is very clever as it refers to both the physical descent into the cave, but also the descent into madness.  If that isn't enough, it suggests the descent of mankind itself as we watch these ""friends"" turn on each other.The dialogue and character interactions are extremely believable and played out by a brilliant cast of unknowns.  The effects are minimal, but good.  This film and story relies much more on anticipation, fear, suspense, and dread than anything tangible even though there is considerable blood and gore at key moments in the film that are certainly not for the squimish.  In addition, the claustrophic elements of the film are enhanced when viewing this film at home.  My wife and I watched this at midnight in our basement home theater room and I found myself needing air . . . desperately!I always like to check out what a film costs to make and I'm always impressed at how some writers, actors and directors can create a terrific film if they put more heart and soul into it than money.  This film only cost about $4 million to make and earned nearly $30 million.  That is a very nice profit and well deserved.  The lastest Rocky film cost $24 to make and earned $100+ million.  Movie producers would be wise to take a lesson from these smaller, but more artfully crafted films.One Compliant:  The audio of the film (or DVD) could have been better.

924222,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B000A8NZ0O,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","Written and directed by Neil Marshall, who also happened to write and direct one of my personal favoritesDog Soldiers, knocked out another instant classic with this film. Highly underrated on it's release the more people were able to see it though were able to help spread the word into a horror film I don't know anyone who has disliked.The movie starts with a tragic accident and shows how six good friends come together to enjoy one of their favorite past times as both a way to have fun as well as a way to help the one involved in the accident get back on her feet and move on with her life. How does one turn a movie about six tough female spelunkers of all things into a horror movie? What exactly is a spelunker? Watching The Descent will easily answer that as it was hands down one of the best horror films in the past 10 years! Oh, and to answer the second question a spelunker is a cave explorer for those who really didn't know.There are many ways to up the suspense level in a situation where 6 people are exploring caves. In fact how many basic premises of fear can we fit in? The three major ones are: the dark, being lost, claustrophobia and building on all three with a slew of increased dangers and ideas. How about starting the exploring and realizing the person in charge of setting up the expedition thought it would be a great idea to instead of picking a known cave system to explore a brand new one? Now let's mix in that they initially started to follow a map that wasn't relevant to the cave they were in and no one has a clue on which cave they actually went to explore?Of course known for his first film about werewolves it's easy to think he may include a creature of some sort chasing after our explorers - and he does. So on top of the above 3 major reasons for suspense to build upon, once things almost look like they are going well we can add in something stalking them into the mix. It is quickly clear what these creatures are what is hard to figure out is how these 6 friends will be able to avoid them and get out alive.When I first heard the premise for this film I wasn't sold on the idea that it was going to be great. When someone told me it was ""kind of like Dog Soldiers but with women in a cave"" I was worried it was just a rehash of a basic premise. In fact I wasn't even really interested in seeing the film until one of my friends said I was doing a disservice to myself for not giving it a chance and reminded me of my dislike for most werewolf films and how much I liked Neil's first movie about werewolves.

924223,A3AEDUJ7MXBNEX,B000A8NZ0O,"Sui Lin Chee ""Sui Lin Chee""","[3, 3]","09/03/2008There are over 140 reviews so there's not much I can add in plot summary.  I viewed the DVD over 6 months ago but decided to add a few comments and give away a few twists (warning: don't read this review if you want to be surprised).1. The story starts out with the lead character (Sarah), an outdoorsy young, married mother, suffering a horrible family tragedy - I'm not one to ""get over it"" if it happened to me - - the tragedy returns in the finally scene of the DVD unrated director's cut, and it is this closing of the loop that really haunts me, more than the Crawler creatures (which, as far as I know, don't exist).2. Because most of the actors are British/Irish/Scottish, I couldn't pick up all the dialogue.  Fast forward a year, and the group of 6 adventurer friends join on an underground cave exploration outing.  Unbeknownst to the group, the trip organizer (Juno)  selects a cave system that isn't charted.  That, in itself, demonstrates the recklessness of the leader and is one of several points of friction.3.  To proceed further after roping down, they have to go through a narrow tunnel.  I wouldn't crawl under my dusty bed to retrieve a dropped item much less a narrow tunnel dozens of feet underground but it was a situation of ""no guts, no glory"" according to their leader or turn back 10 minutes after starting off.  The collapse of the tunnel, the only way in & out they know, is filmed in a claustrophobic manner --  this scene was very effective and gave me an ominous feeling right away.4. Although trapped, they persevere with tense nerves and friction with each other -- blaming and encouraging each other since they know the situation is very untenable.  In one scene, one of the characters is overtaken with joy when she thinks there is a way out, and she (recklessly) suffers a broken leg that puts her and the group at even greater loss of hope.5. The antagonist Crawlers, as in most horror movies, are introduced slowly but once shown, they relentlessly attack the group.  I'm sure reviewers have a great deal to say about this but the Crawlers are shown to be graphic killers - in the DVD extras, you see the Crawlers are human actors wearing albino suits --  they are  not computer generated or added  in the editing room.  Knowing this, it explains their presentation and in my view, delivers the same scariness as Jurassic Park special effects.6. The movie devotes considerable time to the group's attempt at survival.  The characters are smart, athletic & can fight back (not those wimpy, dumb female characters in other horror movies), but distrust and ill feelings set in, and there is a later scene where one character leaves another to the Crawlers to kill so she can flee.  The character interactions are as interesting as anything in the movie and sets it apart from others - you actually feel for what they are going through, liking one over another, blaming some, while hoping they all survive but know that some won't make it.  During all of this, you get to know something about the women characters, taking sides while watching them fight for survival.7.

924227,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000A8NZ0O,Terry Mesnard,"[12, 16]","Last year heralded a ton of really good rated R horror films.  From High Tension to Wolf Creek to Saw 2 to, most recently, Hostel, these films were terrifying, grotesque and gory.  Onto this scene comes this gem of a movie from Dog Soldier's director Neil Marshall.  The Descent rivals all of the previously mentioned horror films in terms of horror.  While it won't live up to the gore involved in the films above, it succeeds in topping all three in terms of abject horror and terror.What makes this review a difficult one to write is that I don't want to tell you anything about it.  I will tell you that its about a group of women who, every year, go on some sort of extreme sporting expedition.  This year, they decide to go spelunking and what follows will test their friendship and their lives like no other event could.  That's about as much as I want to tell you.  A lot of reviews and websites detail some things that happen about 30 minutes from the end of the film.  And this is a film where the less you know, the better.Using pitch black tones with just hints of light, Marshall creates a great cinematic tapestry in which to thrust his characters.  In this way, he creates a very claustrophobic atmosphere and presses down on you.  He also plays with some of the horror conventions (like using a camera, for instance) to great and chilling effect.I have been watching horror films since before I really should have.  While there have been films in which I have ""jumped"" or was spooked by something (loud noise, quick image or what have you), this is the first film in which I have shouted.  In fact, I almost fell out of my chair.  And from that point on, I was on pins and needles.  It was genuinely thrilling to finally have a movie terrify me to the point where I just sat there and watched the credits roll for a few minutes.I would definitely recommend this film to any and all horror fans.  It is probably the most terrifying movie I have seen in a very long time.

As the movie opens, a group of female adventurists are ending thier whitewater rafting trip.  After what appears to be a weird moment between Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and Paul (Oliver Milburn), which is Sarah's (Shauna Macdonald) husband.  On their drive home, Paul and their daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) are brutally killed in an automobile accident.  Sarah wakes up in the hospital to learn of her family's demise.A year later the group meets again for a cave expedition intended to strengthen their friendship once again, and to help Sarah heal, as everything is still reminding her of her loved ones.  What everyone doesn't know is that Juno, an experienced climber, has changed locations to a different cave because it has never been charted.  She figures the group could then name their ""discovery"".Once in the cave, the women realize just how beautiful it is.  What they don't realize is how ugly its going to get.  As the group gets moving and starts to crawl through a claustrophobic tunnel, they soon get cut off from their only known way out after a small cave in blocks their path.  Looking to Juno for answers, panic sets in as they realize her intentions.  And that she doesn't have any answers.The movie sustains an unrelenting tension as the group must try to figure out how they are getting out of the cave.  The lack of lighting solidifies each individual's horror of the dark and unknown.  But worse than that, they begin to hear movement.  No longer the peaceful sounds of water lazily dripping.  Something is scurrying around them, and its fast.  Or is there more than one?Before long, one of these creatures are actually seen by Sarah.  The rest of the group finds it incomprehensible that  there was even the slightest chance of anything living down this far.  That is, until they find the feeding grounds.It's a fight for survival until the bitter end, between the Crawlers and the girls, and between Sarah and Juno.

924233,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B000A8NZ0O,titania86,"[0, 0]","** This review contains spoilers. **Sarah's husband and child died in a tragic car accident a year ago. Now, her estranged friends come together with her to go on their annual caving trip. It's a little awkward at first because they hadn't seen each other since the accident, but that's quickly over as they spend a night of drinking and reminiscing together. The next day, they head out to Borum Caverns, an easy, tourist level cave. They go there to find a much more difficult cave and end up trapped inside due to an avalanche. They start to panic and turn on each other. One of them becomes injured because of her own recklessness, making it imperative that they get to the surface. An unforeseen obstacle rears its ugly head in subterranean humanoid creatures that attack with ferocity and hunger. Can these six women battle these dangerous creatures and make it to the surface alive?I saw posters for The Descent during its theatrical run in the US and I dismissed it as another cheesy, lame horror film. A few years later, my sister recommended it to me and I watched it in total darkness, enhancing the scares and the film's already creepy atmosphere. The Descent is a frightening and claustrophobic film that features both realistic and supernatural scares. The first half of the film has no supernatural elements at all. The scares stem from narrowly escaping being crushed in an avalanche and trying to find a way out of the undiscovered cave while trying to keep calm despite practically certain death. Then the cannibalistic cave dwelling creatures appear and all hell breaks loose. The six women struggle to fight off these monsters and find a way out as their numbers dwindle, making their true natures emerge.The six women in this film each have their own strong personalities and back stories that are established when they meet at a cabin the night before. When they are put under the stress of being trapped, they turn on Juno, the woman responsible for misleading the group and dooming them to certain death. Despite their fear and hopelessness, these women are incredibly resourceful and strong, even in the face of monsters. The monsters cause some of them to lose their humanity in order to fight back as ferociously and survive, Sarah and Juno in particular. Sarah goes from emotionally crippled and barely functional to bad ass creature killer. She puts aside her fear and emotion until only her anger remains. Juno is the opposite. She starts out strong until she accidentally murders one of her friends in the heat of battle. Afterwards, she keeps physically strong, but her fear and guilt eat at her. Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for dead surrounded by creatures as revenge for everything that happened. Is it Sarah who has turned into a morally devoid monster and killed her friend? Or is Juno the villain, whose carelessness and cockiness cost her friends their lives? There is no clear answer to who is more justified or who ultimately is the hero of the film.The Descent is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. It's a perfect mix of suspense and gore that works harmoniously in a way I haven't seen before.

924239,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000A8NZ0O,trebe,"[3, 4]","In writer/director Neil Marshall's The Descent (2005), somewhere in the Appalachians, six female spelunkers looking for adventure, experience the terror of being stalked through underground caverns, by vicious, carnivorous, cave dwelling beings.  Overcoming the initial panic, the women transition to survival mode, doing whatever they must to stay alive.It begins as just an ordinary excursion.  After losing her husband and daughter in a tragic accident, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), is together again with Juno (Natalie Mendoza), and Beth (Alex Reid), looking to rekindle their friendship, on a spelunking expedition.  Also in the team, are sisters Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and Sam (MyAnna Burning), along with newcomer Holly (Nora-Jane Noone).  Entering the cavern, things are proceeding routinely, when a cave-in occurs.  The women can't get out the way they came in, and while looking for some way out, suddenly find themselves under attack, by strange wall crawling creatures.  With their number reduced to five, the group scatters into the darkness.There may be some issues with the backstory, as well as some technical issues related to cave exploration, but The Descent solidly delivers the thrills and scares, that most horror fans are seeking.  With intense fights, and plenty of gore and graphic violence, the film scores high marks in the woman vs. monster department.  The feeling of being driven to the extreme edge, is very real.  The cave creatures move fast, their hissing and screeching, becoming a signal for terror.  Hideous looking, and blind, the crawlers use some kind of internal radar for guidance, as they stalk their prey, and then attack relentlessly.The underground environment isn't pitch black as it should be, but the lighting is nicely done, giving the impression that the setting is reasonably realistic.  The amount of gear that the women have seems a little light.  Things like flashlights, eye protection, masks, gloves, and water seem to be in short supply or missing, but fortunately they do have their metal pickaxes along.  The sea of bones that appear in several locations makes for a nice effect, but is not very realistic.Infidelity is made a highly significant matter, but is rather lost on an audience, who know almost nothing about  the character's personal lives.  Overall, Juno gets a something of a bad rap.  In the initial attack, she's the only one fighting to defend a fallen comrade.  The tragedy that happens to Beth is clearly an accident, but Beth makes it sound like it was deliberate.  The ambiguous ending, leaves it unclear whether anyone has escaped.  This intriguing question however, is answered in the sequel, The Descent Part 2 (2009), which features some members of the original film.All about facing a terrifying horror that comes out of the darkness, The Descent is highly effective at raising fear at a very base level.  The all female cast, gives the creature feature an unusual spin, and the ladies acquit themselves, in a most skull-shattering fashion.  The unrated edition, has some nice extras, including two commentary tracks.  Neither is particularly informative from a purely technical standpoint, but there is some good information sprinkled among what is mostly chit chat.",5,"intense and brutal, subterranean gorefest . . .",1271980800,"04 23, 2010",2010,3250,"['writer/director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'Descent', '2005', 'somewhere', 'Appalachians', 'six', 'female', 'spelunkers', 'looking', 'adventure', 'experience', 'terror', 'being', 'stalked', 'underground', 'caverns', 'vicious', 'carnivorous', 'cave', 'dwelling', 'beings', 'Overcoming', 'initial', 'panic', 'women', 'transition', 'survival', 'mode', 'doing', 'whatever', 'must', 'stay', 'alive.It', 'as', 'just', 'ordinary', 'excursion', 'losing', 'husband', 'daughter', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Sarah', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'together', 'again', 'Juno', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'Beth', 'Alex', 'Reid', 'looking', 'rekindle', 'friendship', 'spelunking', 'expedition', 'Also', 'team', 'are', 'sisters', 'Rebecca', 'Saskia', 'Mulder', 'Sam', 'MyAnna', 'Burning', 'newcomer', 'Holly', 'Nora-Jane', 'Noone', 'Entering', 'cavern', 'things', 'are', 'proceeding', 'routinely', 'when', 'cave-in', 'occurs', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'way', 'came', 'looking', 'way', 'suddenly', 'find', 'attack', 'strange', 'wall', 'crawling', 'creatures', 'number', 'reduced', 'five', 'group', 'darkness.There', 'may', 'be', 'issues', 'backstory', 'as', 'well', 'technical', 'issues', 'related', 'cave', 'exploration', 'Descent', 'solidly', 'thrills', 'scares', 'most', 'horror', 'fans', 'are', 'seeking', 'intense', 'fights', 'plenty', 'gore', 'graphic', 'violence', 'film', 'scores', 'high', 'marks', 'woman', 'vs.', 'monster', 'department', 'feeling', 'being', 'driven', 'extreme', 'edge', 'very', 'real', 'cave', 'creatures', 'move', 'fast', 'hissing', 'screeching', 'becoming', 'signal', 'terror', 'Hideous', 'looking', 'blind', 'crawlers', 'use', 'kind', 'internal', 'radar', 'guidance', 'stalk', 'prey', 'then', 'attack', 'relentlessly.The', 'underground', 'environment', ""n't"", 'pitch', 'black', 'should', 'be', 'lighting', 'nicely', 'done', 'giving', 'impression', 'setting', 'reasonably', 'realistic', 'amount', 'gear', 'women', 'have', 'little', 'light', 'Things', 'flashlights', 'eye', 'protection', 'masks', 'gloves', 'water', 'seem', 'be', 'short', 'supply', 'missing', 'fortunately', 'do', 'have', 'metal', 'pickaxes', 'along', 'sea', 'bones', 'appear', 'several', 'locations', 'nice', 'effect', 'not', 'very', 'realistic.Infidelity', 'made', 'highly', 'significant', 'matter', 'rather', 'lost', 'audience', 'who', 'know', 'almost', 'nothing', 'character', 'personal', 'lives', 'Overall', 'Juno', 'something', 'bad', 'rap', 'initial', 'attack', 'only', 'one', 'fighting', 'defend', 'fallen', 'comrade', 'tragedy', 'Beth', 'clearly', 'accident', 'Beth', 'was', 'deliberate', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'unclear', 'anyone', 'escaped', 'intriguing', 'question', 'however', 'answered', 'sequel', 'Descent', 'Part', '2', '2009', 'members', 'original', 'film.All', 'facing', 'terrifying', 'horror', 'darkness', 'Descent', 'highly', 'effective', 'raising', 'fear', 'very', 'base', 'level', 'female', 'cast', 'creature', 'feature', 'unusual', 'spin', 'ladies', 'acquit', 'most', 'skull-shattering', 'fashion', 'unrated', 'edition', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'particularly', 'informative', 'purely', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'good', 'information', 'sprinkled', 'what', 'mostly', 'chit', 'chat']","Descent,the Version anglais"

Unlike overhyped, undernourished recent local efforts like glorified TV pilot 28 Days Later, this is a real movie made by someone who knows exactly what he's doing, and who does it well. More importantly, he's not afraid to take his time to ground the story and the characters before getting to the main course. There are a couple of hokey false alarms before his heroines find themselves trapped in an unexplored cave system, but the first two thirds are a pretty good survival story in their own right, making you wonder if he really needs to give the gals company down there: big mistake, because when they finally do meet the locals, the film shifts into high gear that makes Cameron and Sigourney look like wimps. Aside from some terrific action scenes, Marshall even manages to subvert the expected it's-not-really-the-ending ending, turning it from the usually schlocky clich&eacute; into something that is genuinely haunting. Which is a shame for those of who saw it theatrically Stateside, because that ending can only be found on the unrated special edition (it's only the last minute that's been cut, but that's enough to leave you with the standard one-size-fits-all horror movie ending).

924242,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000A8NZ0O,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 4]","Not to be confused with `Descent' a very bad sci-fi film starring Luke Perry.Neil Marshall (`Dog Soldiers') did it again. With much lower budget than most of the Hollywood films, Marshall succeeded in creating one of the most claustrophobic pictures in recent years. To be frank, I find Marshall's `The Descent' a bit too long, and wish that he cut the latter half of the film, in which I was amazed by one of the most disturbingly gory scenes I ever saw. Well, but it is impressive, and of that fact I am sure.From the opening chapter (that includes one shock sequence), we are to meet six females, amateur explorers going deep down into a cave among the Appalachian Mountains. When things are going well, one unnecessary step results in a roof fall which cuts off the way out.The basic rule to survive in this extreme situation is, as you know, to stick together all the time. The point of the film is that the explorers are not always capable of doing that. One of the merits of the film is its psychological nuances behind the behaviors of the people under the pressure, and the film is clever in suggesting that these explorers are going to get into a trouble in several of the scenes prior to caving.The second part of the film gives stress to another aspect, the `secret' of the cave which I should not reveal here. All I can say is that you are to experience the drastic change of the tone with more bloody fight and lots of gore.Technically the film is superb with the perfect lighting and sound effect that are both unnerving. Though scientifically Neil Marshall's story requires suspense of disbelief, and probably those who really enjoy caving expedition would say a word or two about the probability of the story, the fact that `The Descent' is a gripping horror film remains true.American version has a different ending. I saw the original British one, which I think is superior.

924243,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000A8NZ0O,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","A group of female friends meet each year for a weekend of outdoor adventuring. After a weekend of white water rafting, one of the women, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) is involved in a tragic car accident. Her husband and son are killed and she is left seriously injured. A year later she gathers together with her friends once again for a weekend of spelunking in the Appalachian Mountains (bringing images of DELIVERANCE and the cabin in EVIL DEAD to mind). Some of her friends want this to be a weekend of healing, some of them are there just for the adventure, and Sarah isn't quite sure why she's along--she wants to be there, yet she's scared, too. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, the leader of this expedition, Juno (Natalie Mendoza), has led the women into an unchartered cave. Passing through a tight tunnel, part of the cave collapses and the truth of what has been going on is revealed. Being trapped in a cave with no option of turning around is horrible enough. But the women aren't the only ones in the cave. Their descent has actually brought them into the lair of a group of semi-human predators who have a particular taste for human flesh. They are blind, but have the ears and reflexes of a bat. The challenge to find the exit then becomes a life or death race to escape from the descent they've lowered themselves into.THE DESCENT uses a lot of typical horror movie techniques, but the film is not a typical horror film. Despite the flesh-eating monsters (who don't even appear on screen until over half-way through) chasing the women and the claustrophobic cave imagery that surrounds them, THE DESCENT is more of an exploration of the psychological and emotional challenges people go through when faced with a life-threatening situation. Taking a cue from Hitchcock, director Neil Marshall knows that the most horrifying things in life are the things we can't see. It is this subtle subtext that gives THE DESCENT an edge. For instance, it is never actually addressed in the film, but Juno might have been having an affair with Sarah's husband and knowing this brings a depth of psychological tension to the situation that makes it far more fascinating than the carnivorous creatures chasing everyone in the cave. Not only that, but Marshall has given us a group of women who aren't like the typical women in horror movies. The women in THE DESCENT aren't frightened little creatures who scream and run away when the going gets tough. Neither are they the idiotic single women of THE GRUDGE or THE RING who seem intelligent but do really dumb things. Instead, the women in this film are women like Ripley in the Alien series; kick-butt, fight back, but fight back smart type of women. They are real women and do things that real women would probably do in such a situation. Nevertheless, this is a horror movie and this film is full of blood and guts. The gore is lessened a bit by the low lighting and economy film making. Nevertheless, there's a lot of blood--think of Sissy Spacek in CARRIE multiplied several times--and therefore the film isn't for the squeamish.I found THE DESCENT to be an enjoyable movie. The beginning moves rather slowly, but is necessary to build the characterization and hinted back-story that gives the film such an emotional and psychological depth later. When I originally saw this film, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. Lionsgate, the U.S. distributor, apparently thought the original ending (the movie was released in 2005 in Europe) was too bleak for American audiences and altered it. I felt that the ending I saw was a complete cop-out and thrown in the please people who have seen too many horror movies that end with the promise of a sequel.  I'm glad to say that the DVD version has the original ending intact.  There's only a couple more minutes of footage, but those couple minutes change the entire meaning of the film completely.  It's a bit ambiguous, too, but it doesn't feel like the cop-out of the original U.S. ending.The DVD includes two audio commentaries, a featurette entitled ""THE DESCENT: Beneath the Scenes"", deleted and extended scenes, outtakes, a short interview with director Neil Marshall explaining the differences in the two endings, some stills, cast and crew biographies, storyboard and scene comparisons, and some trailers for other Lionsgate features.  The behind the scenes featurette is enjoyable to watch and the interview with Marshall about the different endings is very interesting.  Some of the deleted scenes add some more background to the characters, but the rest were unnecessary to the film's plot and structure.",5,Voyage Into the Deep Dark.,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,4618,"['group', 'female', 'friends', 'meet', 'year', 'weekend', 'outdoor', 'adventuring', 'weekend', 'white', 'water', 'rafting', 'one', 'women', 'Sarah', 'Shauna', 'Macdonald', 'involved', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'husband', 'son', 'are', 'killed', 'left', 'seriously', 'injured', 'year', 'later', 'together', 'friends', 'once', 'again', 'weekend', 'spelunking', 'Appalachian', 'Mountains', 'bringing', 'images', 'DELIVERANCE', 'cabin', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'mind', 'friends', 'want', 'be', 'weekend', 'healing', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'adventure', 'Sarah', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'along', 'be', 'there', 'scared', 'too', 'Unbeknownst', 'rest', 'group', 'leader', 'expedition', 'Juno', 'Natalie', 'Mendoza', 'led', 'women', 'unchartered', 'cave', 'Passing', 'tight', 'tunnel', 'part', 'cave', 'collapses', 'truth', 'what', 'been', 'going', 'revealed', 'Being', 'trapped', 'cave', 'option', 'turning', 'around', 'horrible', 'enough', 'women', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'cave', 'descent', 'actually', 'brought', 'lair', 'group', 'semi-human', 'predators', 'who', 'have', 'particular', 'taste', 'human', 'flesh', 'are', 'blind', 'have', 'ears', 'reflexes', 'bat', 'challenge', 'find', 'exit', 'then', 'life', 'death', 'race', 'escape', 'descent', ""'ve"", 'lowered', 'into.THE', 'DESCENT', 'lot', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'techniques', 'film', 'not', 'typical', 'horror', 'film', 'flesh-eating', 'monsters', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'appear', 'screen', 'half-way', 'chasing', 'women', 'claustrophobic', 'cave', 'imagery', 'DESCENT', 'more', 'exploration', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'challenges', 'people', 'go', 'when', 'faced', 'life-threatening', 'situation', 'Taking', 'cue', 'Hitchcock', 'director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'most', 'horrifying', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'subtle', 'subtext', 'THE', 'DESCENT', 'edge', 'instance', 'never', 'actually', 'addressed', 'film', 'Juno', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'Sarah', 'husband', 'knowing', 'depth', 'psychological', 'tension', 'situation', 'far', 'more', 'fascinating', 'carnivorous', 'creatures', 'chasing', 'everyone', 'cave', 'Not', 'only', 'Marshall', 'given', 'group', 'women', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'typical', 'women', 'horror', 'movies', 'women', 'DESCENT', 'are', ""n't"", 'frightened', 'little', 'creatures', 'who', 'scream', 'run', 'away', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'are', 'idiotic', 'single', 'women', 'THE', 'GRUDGE', 'THE', 'RING', 'who', 'seem', 'intelligent', 'do', 'really', 'dumb', 'things', 'Instead', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'women', 'Ripley', 'Alien', 'series', 'kick-butt', 'fight', 'back', 'fight', 'back', 'smart', 'type', 'women', 'are', 'real', 'women', 'do', 'things', 'real', 'women', 'would', 'probably', 'do', 'situation', 'Nevertheless', 'horror', 'movie', 'film', 'full', 'blood', 'guts', 'gore', 'lessened', 'bit', 'low', 'lighting', 'economy', 'film', 'making', 'Nevertheless', 'lot', 'blood', 'think', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'CARRIE', 'multiplied', 'several', 'times', 'therefore', 'film', ""n't"", 'squeamish.I', 'found', 'THE', 'DESCENT', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'beginning', 'moves', 'rather', 'slowly', 'necessary', 'build', 'characterization', 'hinted', 'back-story', 'film', 'such', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'depth', 'later', 'When', 'originally', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'Lionsgate', 'U.S.', 'distributor', 'apparently', 'thought', 'original', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'Europe', 'was', 'too', 'bleak', 'American', 'audiences', 'altered', 'felt', 'ending', 'saw', 'was', 'complete', 'cop-out', 'thrown', 'please', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'end', 'promise', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'DVD', 'version', 'original', 'ending', 'intact', 'only', 'couple', 'more', 'minutes', 'footage', 'couple', 'minutes', 'change', 'entire', 'meaning', 'film', 'completely', 'bit', 'ambiguous', 'too', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cop-out', 'original', 'U.S.', 'ending.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'DESCENT', 'Scenes', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'short', 'interview', 'director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'explaining', 'differences', 'two', 'endings', 'stills', 'cast', 'crew', 'biographies', 'storyboard', 'scene', 'comparisons', 'trailers', 'other', 'Lionsgate', 'features', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'interview', 'Marshall', 'different', 'endings', 'very', 'interesting', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'add', 'more', 'background', 'characters', 'rest', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'plot', 'structure']","Descent,the Version anglais"

924251,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000A8NZ0O,Wayne C. Rogers,"[2, 3]","Several months ago, I purchased a DVD called The Cave, which was about a group of men who get trapped in a cave with strange creatures hunting them down.  I thought the movie was okay, but not great.  Then, The Descent came out.  I thought this was going to be a simple rehash of The Cave, but with women in it, instead of men, and I found myself not interested in seeing it.  It wasn't until I read a review by Roger Ebert, who gave this movie an enthusiastic four-star rating, which is the highest score he gives out for a film, that I found myself going, ""Hmmmm.""  I decided to take a chance on it when the DVD came out.  I'm now happy to say that this movie scared the living daylights out of me!  I must've jumped at least a dozen times while watching it, not to mention screaming and yelling, ""Nooooo, don't do that!"" and ""Watch out behind you!""  I have to say that I'm not a big fan of movies with a lot of blood and gore and knife-welding maniacs.  I usually prefer my ""horror"" movies to be subtle like in Shirley Jackson's The Haunting and Richard Matheson's Hell House.  Though The Descent starts out in ""subtle"" mode, it's anything but during the last half.  Still, I found myself totally engrossed and unable to turn away from what was happening.  I found myself bonded with the characters and wanting them to survive the horrendous ordeal that they were experiencing.The Descent deals with six rather tough outdoorsy women who decide to explore an underground cavern in the mountains of North Carolina.  One of the ladies, Sarah, is still recovering from the loss of her husband and young daughter the year before in a gruesome auto accident.  It's supposed to a simple expedition into a cave that's tourist friendly; but Juno, the leader of the group, has instead taken them to an unexplored cave for the risk element.  Of course, the group doesn't find this out until a cave-in traps them and they begin to realize that there might not be another way out.  The notch is raised again when one of ladies breaks her leg in a fall, making the search for another exit that much more difficult.  With a limited number of flares and no extra batteries for the lights on their helmets, this would've been a great survival story as it was.  But, no, the notch has to be raised again to keep the audience from being bored, and we're eventually introduced to the Crawlers, which are creatures from your worse nightmare.  The Crawlers use sound to detect movement, and boy are these creatures hungry for some fresh meat.  They begin picking off each of the ladies one by one.  The thing is these are tough ladies, especially Sarah and Juno.  These women aren't going down without a fight to the finish no matter how scared they are.  In one scene, Juno takes on four creatures with a large ice pick and kills all of them.  I wouldn't want her mad at me.  The question, of course, is who will survive and who will die by the time the movie ends.  This is where I got a little confused because the ending isn't what you think it is.  There's still another twist to be had to leave you even more drained than you already are.The Descent is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen.  It's an emotional, adrenaline-filled, roller-coaster ride that will leave you breathless and wanting more.  I have to say that the characters were totally believable and had me caring about them from the beginning.  I'm not familiar with any of the actresses, but they certainly did an excellent job with their performances, especially Shauna MacDonald as Sarah and Natalie Mendoza as Juno.  The Crawlers were absolutely terrifying and gave me nightmares when I went to bed.  I kept expecting one of them to hop on my bed during the middle of the night and to pull me out from underneath the covers.  This was the first time that I'd seen anything by director, Neil Marshall, and I was really impressed with the quality of his work.  I'm now a big fan of his and can't wait for his next picture to come out.  The photography and stage design were so good that I thought the entire movie had actually been shot in a cave.  I kept wondering how they were able to get all the cameras and lighting equipment down into these little, tiny tunnels.  The movie was just perfect on so many levels.  It certainly accomplished what the director set out to do which was to make a small, quality film that would scare the **** out of its audience.  The extras include a behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the movie, which runs about forty minutes, deleted and extended scenes, an interview with Neil Marshall, and two movie commentaries with the director, crew and cast.  I'm now getting ready to watch it again, but this time with the commentary.

""The Descent"" proves that the road to redemption and the road to recovery are often paved with the bones of distant memories, ghosts and friends. Neil Marshall's first film ""Dog Soldiers"" inverted the paradigm for horror films featuring werewolves and  cleverly used the template of ""Aliens"" creating a memorable beast all its own. Marshall now does the same thing for spelunking. One year after a family tragedy Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) and her buddies Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) and Beth (Alex Reid) meet up with three other women on their annual outdoor pilgrimage. In the past they've done climbing, white water rafting and other extreme sports. This year Juno has chosen the Appalachian Mountains and a series of underground caverns for them to explore. They get lost. Their friendships sour as they find they are being hunted by vicious creatures that have no fear.IS IT WORTH BUYING?Absolutely. If in doubt rent it but be aware that the ""R"" rated version has a slightly different ending than the unrated edition. The unrated edition seems to be the same as the UK theatrical release.IS IT WORTH WATCHING?Yes. While ""The Descent"" shares a similar setting to ""The Cave"", it's a close cousin to ""Aliens"" and ""Pitch Black"". It's one of the most suspenseful and best written films in the horror genre of the year. Writer/director Neil Marshall (""Dog Soldiers"")creates characters that are memorable each with their own individual quirks and allows the actresses to inhabit their roles completely. Each character is not a faceless victim but has enough character development and scenes to make them interesting and memorable. Marshall also fills his film with references to other horror movies as a tribute to them--you can spot inspirations from ""Deliverence"", ""Alien"", ""The Thing"" and many other classic horror films/thrillers that inspired him. This is definitely a worthwhile horror film.HOW DOES THE FILM LOOK?Great. ""The Descent"" receives a gorgeous transfer to DVD. If you have a widescreen TV go for the widescreen edition of the film as the carefully composed images look truly beautiful particularly during the white water rafting sequence that opens the film and the foreboding drive through the Appalachian Mountains(actually shot on location in Scotland). The level of detail is remarkably sharp with surprising depth given how dark much of the film is. The use of light, darkness and shadows is expertly portrayed in this edition. Colors are right on target with nice warm skin tones where appropriate. Director Marshall also makes effective use of color, texture, light and darkness to drive home the dramatic effects of the film and they are rendered extremely well in this edition.WHAT EXTRAS ARE INCLUDED?We're given two audio commentaries with both effective and intelligent. The first one features director Marshall, producer Christian Colson, Editors Jon Harris & Tina Richardsen and the production designer Simon Bowles focusing on the technical elements of the film, how various effects were achieved, shooting on a soundstage vs. actual location shooting (the entire sequence set in the caves was shot on soundstages) and the effort that went into creating the careful mounting element of fear that dominates the film. The production crew commentary is fun to listen to even when they aren't discussing technical stuff as they're all friends enough to bust each other's chops.The second audio commentary features Marshall again with his female cast. While they do discuss the various technical elements that made the film so effective, they also focus on the physical challenges of shooting the film and the development of their characters.The short documentary ""The Descent: Beneath the Scenes"" allows us to be the proverbial flies on the wall; we see the construction of the elaborate cave sets, the design for the creatures and production issues that arose during the shot. Director Marshall discusses the change to the ending in a short interview and how the film tested with American audiences, his feelings about the changes and how it impacted the drama.  A blooper reel is included as well as deleted scenes that elaborate on their characters relationships. A stills gallery and series of biographies round out the goodies in this set.We also get storyboard to sceen comparisons. Folks who purchase this film at BestBuy will get a second disc that was a featurette release in the UK on the make up/visual effects showing how they prepared some of the puppets for some of the effects, some of the gore effects and the preparations for the prosthetics in the film. The featurette runs about 12 minutes and because it's the only thing on the disc there isn't a menu to choose from. It's a pity that Lion's Gate didn't think to throw additional previews from other films on here as well as the original theatrical trailer.CONCLUSION:In a year of dreary remakes, sequels and bad horror films ""The Descent"" doesn't pretend to be the most original horror/thriller of the year but, instead, takes a conventional situation and twists it inside out with clever plotting and characterizations. This improved version features the unrated cut of the film, the original, darker ending of the film and enough extras to make you feel as claustrophobic at the cast did on the set during the shoot. Lion's Gate, Pathe and Marshall have done a top notch job with this release.",4,"A worthwhile, suspenseful horror film from the director of ""Dog Soldiers""",1167091200,"12 26,

924255,A25PM9JGHPU8EI,B000A8NZ0O,Wes,"[9, 14]","I cannot begin to tell you how utterly, deeply shaken to my soul, to my core being this masterpiece of horror cinema has left me. I have seen hundreds, thousands of movies. As of late, most of them fail to move me. Am I getting jaded? Used to the mediocrity churned out year after year? It could be.However...Watching this...this mind-blowing, visceral, roller-coaster into hell...NEVER has my physical body, my mind, and my soul been so ROCKED by a film with FEAR, HORROR, SUSPENSE, SHOCK. My senses elevated beyond all belief. I was holding on FOR DEAR LIFE at what I was witnessing upon the screen. I was genuinely and TOTALLY SCARED OUT OF MY MIND - I am not exaggerating, not in the slightest.This is an experience I have not had at the movies in AGES.So what is it about? I really don't want to tell you. The less you know about it going in the better. Seriously, I do not advise those with heart conditions stepping into the cinema and watching this. It is an experience so visceral, so emotionally gripping, so INTENSE, your very nervous system will be exercised in ways you never imagined movies were capable of. I for one, had stopped believing in the power, the ability of film to make me feel this way.The audience reaction I witnessed was unlike anything I've ever seen in my life - screaming, shrieking, jumping up from the seats, gasping for breath. This film is as close to a roller-coaster ride as you will ever experience. Upon U.S. release, I plan on seeing it SEVERAL times in theaters; it should be amazing just to simply hear audience reactions, to be in that charged of an atmosphere.Believe me as I tell you: this film WILL go down as a landmark, a classic, one that will be mentioned among the all-time greats: PSYCHO, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, etc.This film has already been released in the UK, and is in fact already available there on dvd. As of this writing I have not seen a date for U.S. release, but for its audiences-to-be I say this: you are in for an experience that you have only dreamed of, and I mean that literally. The sounds and images that are coming your way will stay with you for a very long time, as they still do with me.Technically, the film is outstanding. The cinematography is astounding, breathtaking. The execution of this production is one for the ages. This is landmark cinema, and I am only too grateful to have lived long enough to have experienced it.This is a film, if marketed correctly, will lock up $200 million US domestic EASY. Word of mouth, along with a shrewd release strategy will reap HUGE grosses. I GUARANTEE IT. It's THAT kind of film. People will want to see this more than once.

If you think The Blair Witch project was a ripeoff, then you would appreciate something of higher production value on dealing with unknown monsters in an unescapable situation. I found myself so drawn to it that I did feel kind of stuck just like the characters, maybe it's because I am very afraid of dark caves and underwater themed stories. I wished there was an alternate ending to this film that didn't quite satisfy my at the end. Just check it out and you'll know what I mean...",5,Indeed it is one of the top horror films of  the year!!!,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,1368,"['am', 'not', 'watching', 'body', 'parts', 'being', 'tortured', 'cut', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'appetite', 'shows', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'do', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'tricks', 'mind', 'scary', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'Descent', 'when', 'women', 'are', 'stuck', 'cave', 'trying', 'figure', 'what', 'hell', 'hiding', 'dark', 'course', 'time', 'realized', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'be', 'exploring', 'such', 'unknown', 'cave', 'was', 'too', 'late.The', 'cast', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'are', 'good', 'parts', 'story', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'creepier', 'crawlers/creatures', 'are', 'even', 'creepier', 'can', 'imagine', 'Gollum', 'L.O.T.R', 'making', 'cameo', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'Yes', 'cave', 'very', 'real', 'dark', 'slimey', 'wet', 'bloody', 'almost', 'believed', 'was', 'shot', 'real', 'cave', 'saw', 'special', 'features', 'Impressive', 'prosthetics', 'makeups', 'set', 'dec', 'think', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'project', 'was', 'ripeoff', 'then', 'would', 'appreciate', 'something', 'higher', 'production', 'value', 'dealing', 'unknown', 'monsters', 'unescapable', 'situation', 'found', 'so', 'did', 'feel', 'kind', 'stuck', 'just', 'characters', 'maybe', 'am', 'very', 'afraid', 'dark', 'caves', 'underwater', 'themed', 'stories', 'wished', 'was', 'alternate', 'ending', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'satisfy', 'end', 'Just', 'check', 'out', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean']","Descent,the Version anglais"
924260,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B000A8NZ0O,Wisconsin Dad,"[6, 16]","My wife and I had a rare opportunity to find a babysitter and head out to a Sunday movie. Not knowing what was out, we began exploring ratings and reviews on Amazon and Google. While not in the mood for a horror movie, we decided to see The Descent anyway, simply because it was rated extremely high compared to everything else.So, with popcorn in hand, we rolled past previews and into The Descent.The Descent is a story of a British woman and her group of friends who enjoy extreme adventures such as rafting on rapids, rock climbing, and even base jumping. After a tragedy, the reunite in the Appalachian mountains to explore a cave. It is here that the frights begin.Without giving away spoilers, I will mention some aspects of The Descent that my wife and I discussed in the car after the movie.First and foremost, we were surprised at how much blood and gore was in the film. It wasn't needed, and many times felt out of place. The blood and gore became very distracting. We both feltit was over the edge and took away from the story. Blood isn't scary in and of itself, and after a while it loses its shock value.Secondly, there were too many cheap frights in the movie. By this I mean unexpected scenes meant to stop your heart that come out of the blue and really have nothing to do with the plot. The beginning and ending of The Descent feature scenes like this. (and no, they were black cats jumping out of shadows)Third, while the acting was good, the characters were forgettable. One month from now I won't remember either the actors or their characters.That brings me to the fourth point: while entertaining, The Descent was forgettable. My wife and I agreed strongly on this point. In a year from now we most likely will be browsing the video stores and come across The Descent. I can hear the words now, ""Did we see that? I can't remember? Was that the movie...""Spoiler alert....Lastly, the ending was out of place. The main character does something to another character that wrecked the film for us. Earlier in the film, Juno is under attack and swings arounf wildly, only the land a climbing pick that goes all the way through another characters throat. That character can't speak, and drops to the group. While on the group, blood pours from this character's would at a fast and furious pace. There is a scene where you can literally see the blood pouring to the ground at a shocking rate. The stream from the wound is about an half inch thick. In any case, Juno leaves her for dead. My wife and I didn't blame her. This woman was toast with that kind of blood loss.But, alas, the woman didn't die and is still doing OK twenty minutes later in the film. Can you say hokey? I knew you could. Juno is then left for dead by the main character. The main character comes off as a bigger fool that Juno. At least Juno didn't kill on purpose.And then the main character fleas, only to give us another part deux of the cheesy ending: a heart stopper in the getaway vehicle. The end of the Descent contained two scenes that were out of place and ruined the movie for us. Nuff said.The movie was scary, the acting good, the story was pretty good, but the directing and the fleshing out of the characters in the script left us happy to ascend from The Descent.It is worth seeing, but my wife and I both agreed:1) We would not see it again2) We would not buy it on DVD3) We would be hesitant to recommend it to many of our friendsTotal Score (out of 100) = 4820 (out of 50).

There's claustrophobia, darkness, underground carnvivorous mutants, and much more. There's no male macho character to save the day either, it's all ladies here, and these are some tough yet feminine women. There were times when I found it hard to breathe when watching this movie, it was totally creepy.  I don't scare easily and I thought this movie WAS VERY SCARY!  I absolutely loved it.  For being a Lion's Gate film it was suprisingly well done.  I barely see this on TV so that's a bummer.  I'm glad I bought the UNRATED DVD so I can enjoy it as many times as I wish.  BRAVO!
