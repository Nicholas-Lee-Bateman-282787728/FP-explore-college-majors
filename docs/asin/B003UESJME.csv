1365674,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B003UESJME,Acute Observer,"[1, 3]","True Grit, 2010 filmCould a fourteen year old girl leave home to avenge her father's murder? A hired man killed his employer and fled away with no one in pursuit. [Believable?] This young girl came to collect her father's body. She sees three men hanged. The Sheriff explains why he can't pursue Tom Cheney into Indian Territory. She will need a US Marshal, like Rooster Cogburn. [Usually the unclaimed bodies of outlaws were sold for medical purposes.] Miss Ross does not wear a hat or bonnet, false history of that era. She is also a sharp bargainer1 [Unbelievable.] Maddie gets her father's old pistol. Marshal Cogburn brings them in dead or alive. Maddie offers him $50 to get Tom Cheney (in addition to the usual price). LeBoeuf turns up to visit Maddie; he is a Texas Ranger who is also after Tom Cheney. Maddie buys a horse then hires Cogburn and prepares for the hunt. Reuben Cogburn has left without her! Maddie won't be stopped by a river.They talk over a campfire. Maddie learns of a deal, but it is nullified by an argument. Cogburn learns about Cheney. They find a body. Then another man rides by with a body on a horse. They find shelter in a dugout cabin, and get news about Cheney. Cogburn has a plan. LeBoeuf arrives, then four others. ""That didn't pan out."" They continue to ride, the ground is snow-covered. They camp and talk. There is another disagreement. Down at the stream Maddie sees Cheney and is captured by Ned. But LeBoeuf shows up in time! Cogburn rides against four men with his two revolvers. LeBoeuf shows his sharpshooting skills. Maddie knows how to shoot too. There is more drama from snakes. Cogburn knows how to treat snakebite and rides with Maddie for help. Twenty-five years later we hear the rest of the story. Maddie visits a ""Wild West Show"" where Cole Younger and Frank James perform (after their release from prison). She hears that Cogburn died, and has him re-buried in the family plot. And so it ends.This ending seems unsatisfactory. I never read the original 1967 novel and don't remember the details of the original 1970 movie. This version was not a commercial success. It is unusual today to show a teenage girl so handy with a firearm. What was the purpose of recreating a 40-year old Western movie? A story of relentless revenge recalls ""The Searchers"". Some of the classic westerns of the 1930s did involve a story of revenge but as a side-plot. The idea of a fourteen year old as a hard bargainer is not believable.

I have the book and I re-read it so that when the movie came out, I could see how close they stuck to it. Well let me say that except for the ending, the 1969 version is truer to the book than this one. The Coen's changed scenes they didn't need to. They added characters and omitted others. I suppose they did this because they kept saying this wasn't a remake. Call it what you want, remake, reimagine, or reboot, comparisons will still be drawn. I have seen the new TRUE GRIT twice and enjoyed it more the second time BECAUSE I wasn't comparing to the 1969 version. I just wish these people who trash the original would read the book. Rooster is described as ""40'ish, looks like Grover Cleveland with a walrus moustache"". Also no mention of an eye patch, just that his left eye is almost completely closed. Tom Chaney is short and in his mid twenties, while LaBeof has perfectly trimmed aubern hair.I do hope though, that now Hollywood will see people will pay to go see a well made western. Because that is what this version of TRUE GRIT is.

1365677,A1K6A7JXC1CU81,B003UESJME,"Aglio ""Classic Film Lover""","[5, 10]","True Grit is not a remake of the 1969 Henry Hathaway classic starring John Wayne. In interviews, the Coen Brothers have said they decided to return to the original source material i.e. the book by Charles Portis. As a result, it's a closer adaptation of the book. That's what sets this movie apart. People will make comparisons. That's alright, but they really are two different movies.Jeff Bridges is extraordinary as the ""one eyed fat man"", US Marshall Rooster (Reuben) Cogburn. He's not Jeff Bridges doing an imitation of John Wayne. He has made the role of Rooster his own and it's worth its weight in California gold pieces. You can tell he's enjoying himself. He personifies the ""true grit"" that our hero, Mattie, feels is necessary to help her capture Tom Cheney. The man who murdered her father. In the original, the central character was Rooster Cogburn. Not so in this movie. It's Mattie Ross, as in the book.Mattie is 14 years old and is determined to avenge the death of her father. She is certainly precocious and intelligent far beyond her years. And she is just as single minded as Rooster, except without the ornery attitude. Every time he tries to shoo her away, she doggedly returns to seek his help as well as roll his cigarettes. She will not be put off her task. Half the fun of this movie is watching Mattie outwit Colonel Stonehill for the funds she needs to pay Rooster as well as the costs of her father's funeral. Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie as an intelligent, independent minded young woman who will not be treated like a child. She definitely holds her own on screen with Jeff Bridges as well as Matt Damon, Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin.All the actors are wonderful. Matt Damon is marvelous as the nincompoop Texas Ranger, LeBouef (pronounced LeBeef) also after Cheney. At first, he seems like a ninny constantly being bested intellectually by Mattie. However, in the end, he too proves that he has true grit. As for Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper, can you get two better onscreen outlaws. Josh Brolin is fabulous as the villainous Tom Cheney. He's all snarling miscreant. While Barry Pepper is made all the more menacing with a mangled set of teeth and furry chaps.This is a wonderful old fashioned type of western that Hollywood used to make and thanks to the Coen Brothers has been resurrected. The script is humorous, tight and witty. The one weak point is the ending. Towards the end, the script does seem to lose a bit of steam. However, do not let that stop you from seeing this movie. Yes, there is some violence. However, it is something you can take your 14 year old to see.Go see this movie !! You will not regret it. I loved it.

For this kind of western novel turned film I believe it was welcomed though. The remake of a movie like Planet Of The Apes is an example of freshness bombing. Of course that was sci-fi, but the concept still applies.True Grit screams freshness that works on almost all levels. It needs to be viewed on blu ray (unless pristine analog is perfected, as I hope for)for optimum enjoyment. What literally astounded me was the dialogue. Words flowed of the charactors lips like shinning glass under pressure. This was a script designed to expound upon the forgotten gems of our English language. I recommend setting the English subtitles to catch one old west nuance after the other.The Cohen brothers doing a western is like Edgar Alan Poe being blown back as a  hippie. It's odd, different and yet effective. Jeff Bridges hands down, drew upon his body of acting experience to summon up his own brand of Rooster Cogburn. The story of a young girl persuing her fathers killer is done in a note by note fashion that reopens the old west.I am not a fan of Matt Damon but I can't take away from him how he grounded his charactor in shinning Texas Ranger style. James Brolin didn't pan out as I expected and fortunately it wasn't a complete story stopper. The scene where he encounters his young opponent in the river was more than a bit sloppy for me. A strong-driving climax with an added thoughtful ending made this a worthwhile cinematic experience. The comparisons made to the original don't hold up.

Finally, the Coen brothers justify their reputation as great filmmakers.  I have been hoping in vain for the last 15 years for the Coens to make a movie that is up to the standards of their first, and best film, Blood Simple.  I must admit, I was scepticle at first.  First, I did not really like the original.  John Wayne was fine, as usual.  By this point, John Wayne could pretty much phone in the role he was playing, but John was never really a great actor to be frank.  But he WAS an icon, and that iconography shows through in the original.  But the near fatal flaw of the entire film was Kim Darby, the woman who played Mattie.  First, she didn't look like she was 14 (she was 21), and quite frankly, she was the most annoying human being on the planet.  Her incessant blubbering did not come across as determined, but more like whining.  This is probably the fault of the director, because he should have helped her with that performance.  This kills the film for me.  The film is also very much an old Hollywood version of the West, which is a tad idealized.  John Wayne's later westerns were a little grittier, but outside of Big Jake, they tended to be PG versions of what the West was really like.Then I saw the Coen Brothers' True Grit.Jeff Bridges is great as Rooster Cogburn, channeling his drunken, crazy sot in Crazy Heart and combining it with the Duke, and you get a great mishmash of a wonderful new character.  But Hailee Steinfeld, who plays Mattie in this version, is a vision.  Her portrayal was fantastic, and DOES come across as a tough girl in a very tough world who is determined to get justice for her father.  She is focused like a laser and very direct, and for some reason, pulls it off beautifully.  Matt Damon's LeBeouf is also great, being a bit of a dandy, but still, a very dangerous individual.  The world rings true, with the new revisionist wave of westerns that make them much more realistic.  Not exactly sure why Brolin gets top billing over Steinfeld, as he is in the movie for all of ten minutes, but he is good, too.  Even Barry Pepper is great, and who would have thought he could pull off fuzzy chaps?  I think the last time fuzzy chaps appeared in a western was Tom Mix.  Anyway, this is a great film.  The Coen's have finally made a great film worthy of their considerable talents.",5,Wow!

1365688,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,B003UESJME,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[8, 19]","First off, I do applaud, as others have, the ambition of the Coens in tackling this one. There are a few iconic Westerns out there that, in my view, shouldn't be remade -- the original TRUE GRIT among them. But, having said that, who better to attempt it than the Coens.That being said, let's get to it!I love reviewers who complain about ""John Wayne just playing John Wayne!"" It is, in my thinking, a remarkably stupid thing to say. Still, critics over the years have made the same rationalization when assessing the Duke's work. Ironically, the very same thing might arguably be said of James Stewart or of Henry Fonda or of Clint Eastwood or of Robert Redford. The great ones are great because they have us believing they ARE who they play and not the other way around. In other words John Wayne IS Rooster Cogburn just as he IS J.B. Books, Wil Anderson, J.D. Cahill and Jacob McCandles, just to name a few. And when a performance becomes so ingrained in the minds of movie goers, as John Wayne's depiction of Rooster Cogburn has, there's absolutely no getting around it. PERIOD.Some will say, ""Well, I like Jeff Bridges better."" Absolutely acceptable. Glad the new portrayal worked for you. It, however, did not for me.Bridges, while a talented actor, was simply in over his head. Absolutely drowning even before he entered the water! How do you go head-to-head with a legend? You cannot dismiss the original performance. After all, very likely Bridges was raised with it. So how do you go about it? Costuming changes? After all, Cogburn doesn't wear an eye patch in the book. Why not that? Maybe gain a ton of weight and grow a long, handlebar mustache for the same reason. But, because Wayne IS Cogburn, it would have been box office suicide. In this particular case, it seems Bridges attempted to monotonize the character all together. No emotion! NONE! Dead pan, half-drunk mumbling is all that emerges in every scene. Oh! And he does put on a farmer's hat! Even in the famous ""FILL YOUR HANDS, YOU SONOFABITCH!"" Stand off with Lucky Ned, Bridges manages no more than a drunken mumble! Heavens! Even Barry Pepper, starring as Lucky Ned -- the role made originally famous by a young Bob Duvall -- is far more appropriately animated when compared to Bridges' Cogburn in this signature scene.Obviously, Matt Damon comes across far better than his counterpart in the original, Glen Campbell. At least Damon didn't attempt to sing the theme song while, over the years, all of us have wondered why Campbell attempted acting.No. The only real bright spot in this movie is Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. Fresh. Quick. Spot on. Oh, sure! Kim Darby has been panned over the years for her overly perky portrayal. But, if you read the book, you'll see that Darby did rather well and you can easily tell that Steinfeld takes many of her cues from Darby's performance.And then there's the music. Composer Carter Burwell was faced with just as impossible a task in his work as Bridges was in his. How do you compete with Elmer Bernstein when it comes to music in the Western movies. And, you guessed it, Burwell handles his calling just about as well as Bridges did his!And forget all of the dialogue about this version being truer to the book. Absolutely not true. It's just that the Coens chose some things to include while leaving others out. The same is true of the original. But that's movie making, isn't it? You simply cannot include everything and the new movie is no exception there.Now, don't get me wrong. The cinematography is classic Coen. Beautiful and stark. Unmistakable. This movie is worth watching for that alone.But, all things being considered, I can manage only two stars.THE HORSEMAN",2,HOW DO YOU GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH A LEGEND?

The Coen brothers made a movie that was true to the wonderful novel by Charles Portis, which is recommended reading.I viewed this with low expectations and was very, very pleasantly surprised. The Coen brothers reigned in their propensity for over the top gore and violence and told the story that Charles Portis told, including the sometime priggishness of Matty and the drunkenness of Rooster Cogborn and the cockiness of Le Beouf. Every character and story element came together just the way it should have. All of the leads are marvelous and I didn't even recognize Matt Damon, which was a good thing. The 1969 version gives us John Wayne as John Wayne, a towering presence, but not Rooster Cogburn. Jeff Bridges gives us Rooster Cogburn.Along the way the Coens give us a portrait of a post-civil war America that is uncomfortably true. The West really was wild and was settled by a variety of people with true grit, not all of that grit suitable for Sunday school, though Matty's strong religious tendencies and quotations are the only element from the book that were downplayed.A wonderful film from a wonderful story.

Mattie's father was murdered by a dim-witted coward who gambled away his money and got heated in a drunken stupor, so he took the life of a man who was only trying to help him.  Mattie, an oddly matured young woman, seeks revenge for the unwarranted death of her father by seeking out a man with `true grit', someone who can hunt down the savage responsible for her newfound burdens and bring him to justice.  The man she finds is alcoholic Rooster Cogburn.  Feeling that Mattie is nothing more than a nuisance, he accepts (begrudgingly) her request and her money and then sets off with a Texas Ranger who is also in pursuit of Mr. Ross's killer, albeit for different reasons.  Mattie, determined to see this through, forces Cogburn to take her along, and soon she sets off for a life changing adventure that proves to be far more than she expected.Besides the fact that I haven't seen the original, I have been pretty clear on this site that I'm not really all that into Westerns as a genre.  That said; there have been quite a few modern Western submissions that have delighted me, and the last time the Coen Brothers attacked this genre, they scored pretty high (despite the fact that I find it marginally overrated, there is no denying that `No Country for Old Men' is a very good film).I was excited about this.As a film, `True Grit' works very well.  The acting is decent to great (with a small exception), the pacing is superb and the `grit' is well executed.  The violence is savage yet never overbearing.  The authenticity is captured in every frame, with a thick film of dust encapsulating each scene.  The dialog, while at times a tad overwrought, is one of the film's best assets, taking a classic story to another level by adding some depth and maturity.All in all, `True Grit' is a very good film.That said; there is a spark missing for me that I really wanted to be there.  When all was said and done I liked the film but didn't LOVE it like I expected.  Some of the film's themes seemed a tad redundant and the ending was a disappointment (not the `story' ending but the throwaway ending with the elder Mattie).  It was just a notch below what I thought it could have been.  Still, there is a lot about this film to love.  Matt Damon, for one, is superb.  While some of his dialog, especially his sarcasm, is overused, he sells it hard.  While I found Bridges to be phoning it in a bit, he was quite effective (the man can do anything) and Hailee Steinfeld was arguably sensational (she seemed a bit too rehearsed in scenes, but overall she was excellent).  In fact, the only actorly sore spot was Josh Brolin who just played the simpleton too clich&eacute;d.With sharp editing and directing and a superbly grounded pacing (the action falls in all the right places to pave the way for a keenly developed character study), `True Grit' is a film that lives up to its name and reputation.  It is gritty and engaging and totally invested.

Other than The Hudsucker Proxy, every one has been a masterpiece of acting and creativity.First, let me say I have never seen the original with John Wayne.  I never found him to be a convincing character in the few movies he did that I have actually watched.  I understand that True Grit may have been his best performance, so I will withhold comparative judgement.I also have to say that I was disappointed when I heard this was going to be their project for 2010.  I had only the sketchiest idea of the story and most of my ideas about it were wrong.All that being said, I loved this movie!  I rented the standard version from Netflix, and halfway through the watching, found myself ordering the Blue-ray edition from Amazon.  I absolutely identify with Hailee Steinfeld's character, Mattie Ross.  That's a whole other story.  Let's just say my outspokenness and inability to accept authority and others' definition of my role in this world have led me to take the risks that are not always the definition of feminine behavior...Jeff Bridges has become a master actor, and the difference between this role and the first movie I remember him in, King Kong, are unbelievable.  While I still believe his best role was ""The Dude"" in the Big Lebowski, ""Rooster Cogburn"" was still an amazing transformation which really showed the depth of his skills.  In its own right, this role redifined his career.  He is in an all new mode as an actor and artist.While Matt Damon has added a different depth to his acting in this piece, I am not sure he was the best choice for his character, and may be a slightly weak component.  He was very professional, but not completely believeable.  Timothy Olyphant of Deadwood fame, in a rougher form, might have been a viable alternative.  The character needed a bit more roughness.  This is not a major issue for me.Josh Brolin's character may have made more impact with a bit more development, and I certainly wouldn't have minded another 20 minutes of wonderful acting.  Since I have not read the original book, I don't know if there was actually any more development.  This is what happens when a movie leaves you wanting more, which almost all Coen Bros pieces have accomplished from Blood Simple on.This will be a revered part of my Coen Bros library.  I watch nearly every one but Hudsucker every year.  All are better than almost anything else ever produced.  I have special favorites, but all are on the top shelf in a place of honor.Until I watched it, I wasn't sure it would fit...Silly me!  I don't know if I will ever watch the original.  This has defined the story for me, so unlike many other reviewers, I am not and will likely never compare this with the one from the 70s, so yes, my views may be skewed for the Coens.I urge anyone reading this review to put aside dogmatic prejudices against remakes, even though I often find little interest in any sort of remake.  This is a piece of art unique unto itself.  It is its own work, and I don't know if comparisons are even called for.  You see an utterly believable period piece with immaculate detail and superb acting.  In some ways it does remind me of Jim Jaramusch and Johnny Depp's wonderful, but underrated black and white masterpiece, Dead Man.  The authenticity is amazing, and yet the creativity of the production is almost overwhelming.Take it as it is, and enjoy it for its own merits.

1365704,ARA48345JZPZR,B003UESJME,Archmaker,"[11, 16]","Walking out of the theatre, a man behind us said (referring to Jeff Bridges):""He wasn't John Wayne!""And I turned to my companions and said:""No he wasn't John Wayne, he was Rooster Cogburn!""And that is my take on the Coen's re-imagining of Charles Portis's True Grit.  I think this is a terrific film, beautiful to look at, beautifully acted by all, and loaded with the arch and arcane dialogue that made the book a delight and had me chuckling throughout the story and this presentation particularly. I think the Coens nailed it.It has been 40 plus years since I read the book, so I cannot attest how closely or how much the two films departed from the book.  But I do know that this version feels more true to the tone and tenor of the book I read so long ago, and the ending is more how I recall the novel ended.Roger Deakin's cinematography is alway exceptional, but I think here it is superlative.  The cold and forbidding landscape he shoots is a perfect match to the somber tale that underlays the humorous dialogue and indelible characters that are young Mattie and her gun-for-hire and eventual protector and saviour, the reprobate and dissolute Deputy Marshal, ornery and mean and not too concerned with the niceities of the law, Reuben (Rooster) Cogburn, indelibly played in the original as the iconic John Wayne character by John Wayne, and in this re-discovered by Jeff Bridges in a role he owns as his own.And of course there is the wonder of young Hailee Steinfeld (a real find), whom everyone seems to find astonishing in her confidence and command at 13 years old of a starring role with a lot of difficult dialogue and plenty of nuance in the complexity of her character.  This film is much more centered on Mattie and this young girl handles the chore with aplomb.All of the supporting roles, from Matt Damon's Texas Ranger to the small cameos Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper as villains Tom Chaney and Lucky Ned Pepper are fine.  And even if the bit with the ""doctor"" wearing the bear coat wasn't in the book as some reviewer noted (I can't remember), I for one found that bit of aside not a distraction but a nice bit of Coenesque ""color"" thrown in for the pure quirkiness but absolutely in tune with the tone of the piece as a whole.Anyway, many reviews here give lots of detail on the film so I will pass on that.  Let me just say that I think both films can be enjoyed for their strengths.  In the first, you have the incomparable Duke Wayne.  In the second, you have a completely realized film, with outstanding performances by the two leads, Steinfeld and Bridges as Mattie and Rooster, and a better script, cinematography, cast and direction.And if the debate continues about which film is better, my view is this:  take John Wayne out of the first film and would it be a great film?  No.  Take Jeff Bridges out of the new version (God Forbid) and you would still have a fine film.  With Jeff in it as Rooster, I think you have a great film.  That's my 2 cents.",5,Mattie and Reuben.....,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,2984,"['Walking', 'theatre', 'man', 'said', 'referring', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', ""n't"", 'John', 'Wayne', 'turned', 'companions', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'take', 'Coen', 're-imagining', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'True', 'Grit', 'think', 'terrific', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'loaded', 'arch', 'arcane', 'dialogue', 'made', 'book', 'delight', 'had', 'chuckling', 'story', 'presentation', 'particularly', 'think', 'Coens', 'nailed', 'it.It', 'been', '40', 'years', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'not', 'attest', 'how', 'closely', 'how', 'much', 'two', 'films', 'departed', 'book', 'do', 'know', 'version', 'more', 'true', 'tone', 'tenor', 'book', 'read', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'ending', 'more', 'how', 'recall', 'novel', 'ended.Roger', 'Deakin', 'cinematography', 'alway', 'exceptional', 'think', 'here', 'superlative', 'cold', 'forbidding', 'landscape', 'perfect', 'match', 'somber', 'tale', 'humorous', 'dialogue', 'indelible', 'characters', 'are', 'young', 'Mattie', 'gun-for-hire', 'eventual', 'protector', 'saviour', 'reprobate', 'dissolute', 'Deputy', 'Marshal', 'ornery', 'mean', 'not', 'too', 'concerned', 'niceities', 'law', 'Reuben', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'indelibly', 'played', 'original', 'iconic', 'John', 'Wayne', 'character', 'John', 'Wayne', 're-discovered', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'role', 'own.And', 'course', 'wonder', 'young', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'real', 'find', 'whom', 'everyone', 'find', 'astonishing', 'confidence', 'command', '13', 'years', 'old', 'starring', 'role', 'lot', 'difficult', 'dialogue', 'plenty', 'nuance', 'complexity', 'character', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'centered', 'Mattie', 'young', 'girl', 'chore', 'aplomb.All', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'small', 'cameos', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'villains', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'are', 'fine', 'even', 'bit', 'doctor', 'wearing', 'bear', 'coat', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'one', 'found', 'bit', 'aside', 'not', 'distraction', 'nice', 'bit', 'Coenesque', 'color', 'thrown', 'pure', 'quirkiness', 'absolutely', 'tune', 'tone', 'piece', 'whole.Anyway', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'give', 'lots', 'detail', 'film', 'will', 'pass', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'think', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'strengths', 'first', 'have', 'incomparable', 'Duke', 'Wayne', 'second', 'have', 'completely', 'realized', 'film', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Steinfeld', 'Bridges', 'Mattie', 'Rooster', 'better', 'script', 'cinematography', 'cast', 'direction.And', 'debate', 'film', 'better', 'view', 'take', 'John', 'Wayne', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'No', 'Take', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'new', 'version', 'God', 'Forbid', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'fine', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Rooster', 'think', 'have', 'great', 'film', '2', 'cents']",True Grit

Kim Darby was really too old to play the 14 year old Mattie Ross and Glen Campbell was never much of an actor.

1365716,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003UESJME,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[1, 3]","FILM RATING:  3.5 starsWriters/Directors Joel and Ethan Coen really redefined the idea of remaking an older film with their latest picture, True Grit (2010). For once, Hollywood has actually improved a movie by remaking it, which is more the exception than the rule. But the Coen Brothers really came through with a very good adaptation of the Charles Portis novel, that appears to be nothing like the original True Grit (1969) film, which I can't say I've ever seen. I'm not a John Wayne fan and that movie has looked too silly for my tastes from the bits of it I have seen.After renting True Grit from Redbox on blu-ray last week, I gotta admit that I wish I had seen this movie in the theater along with all the other great movies I saw in the theater last year. I'll admit it...I was hesitant because I wouldn't say that I'm a Coen Brothers fan. So I figured I would wait for True Grit to come out on Blu-ray. And it was a worthy Blu-ray rental for sure. I guess with lower than normal expectations, True Grit surprised me! Although more and more, I'm coming to appreciate the Coen Brothers' work. While none of their films are in my Top 100 Movies of all time yet, I do really like and appreciate Fargo (1996) and No Country For Old Men (2007)...and now True Grit. Those are their 3 best movies in my opinion, all 3.5 star films.What struck me right off the bat with True Grit was three things: the cinematography, the writing (i.e. the dialogue), and the acting. All three just impressed the hell out of me in the first 5-10 minutes. I just loved the crazy accents and pronunciations of the very juicy dialogue by everyone. Each actor brought something unique and special to their character, making everyone stand out, yet fit together as a misfit group. I also really loved the production design, because the modern western is something I've been into every since Lonesome Dove came out in 1989. Kudos to Production Designer Jess Gonchor.If there is a singular reason to watch True Grit, it's the cinematography in my opinion. Director of Photography Roger Deakins is absolutely one of the best in the business. HIs body of work simply astounds me: Thunderheart (1992), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Fargo (1996), Courage Under Fire (1996), Kundun (1997), House of Sand and Fog (2003), No Country For Old Men (2007), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), Doubt (2008), The Reader (2008), Revolutionary Road (2008), and The Company Men (2010). And True Grit can now easily be added to that list as one of his best. I'm extremely excited to see his work on Director Andrew Niccol's upcoming film In Time (2011), coming out in October. The director of Gattaca (1997) has such a striking style, so combined with Deakins eye, it should be a real treat!Deakins use of light, from bright sunny exteriors, to dark nearly pitch black interiors, to the subtle shades of dusk and dawn, provides a character of its own in this story. All the saturated shades of browns, greens, golds, blues, and other natural tones just pop on the blu-ray. There was no question that I wanted to see this on blu-ray and not on DVD. Its movies like this that High Definition was invented for. I'm naturally a sucker for landscape photography, since that's my background as a photographer. So I can really appreciate the work that Deakins did here to capture the beauty of ""The West"", both in its broad strokes and incredible textured details.I've already mentioned how brilliant the writing of the dialogue is in this movie. The Coens were obviously working with incredible source material from the author, but they also managed to put their unique style for dialogue into the script as well. You can just tell it's a Coen Brothers movie when you listen to the characters speak. Its almost like there's a new language called Coenese out there. And of course the dialogue would be nothing without the incredible cast who delivers it with sharp panache. Casting Director Ellen Chenoweth perfectly matched each character with the perfect actor. Or at least the actors left no room for us to wonder.At the center of the cast are Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld, and Matt Damon. If Bridges hadn't just won the Oscar for Best Actor for Crazy Heart (2009) the previous year, he certainly would have won for this role...even up against Colin Firth in The King's Speech (2010). Bridges is at his best here, just like I believe he was in Crazy Heart. Steinfeld also gives an amazing debut performance...especially for a 13-year old. But I'm not quite as enthralled with her acting in this movie as some critics and cinephiles have been. I felt it was very good, but not Oscar worthy. To my surprise, Matt Damon really pulls of his comedic role as LaBoeuf. He was funny, charming, and just plain good in this role. Supporting actors Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, and the rest of the bit players, all did a fine job. I couldn't even recognize Pepper at first...it took a few careful studies of his character to pull the actor out for me.The sound design and music on True Grit are top notch. Composer Carter Burwell creates the perfect score to accompany this unique story. And Sound Editor Skip Lievsay does a great job integrating all the various sounds together. There are many times during the movie that I really noticed how great the sound is on it. All of the foley work providing every little detailed sound was a perfect complement to the actor's voices and their unique accents.While there is a lot to love about True Grit, the story falls apart in the third act. Once we are actually introduced to the bad guys, I started losing interest. Granted there was a lot of great filmmaking craft for me to focus on and keep me partially interested. But emotionally, I felt a bit let down with the resolution of the story. I'm not totally sure why, but I'm guessing that what I was much more interested in was the stories of the three main characters and their dynamics with each other, and less about the actual plot. The bad guys almost didn't matter and felt a bit forced. It seemed like young Steinfeld's capture was unnecessary and then hurried to get resolved so that the film could have a happy ending. I'm probably being nitpicky here and maybe I'm wrong. I'll admit that I really wanna watch this film again in a few months and reappraise it. I just know that I felt like the movie started much stronger than it ended. And so for now, I give it 3.5 stars.It wouldn't surprise me if much like all of the other Coen Brothers' films I've seen, that True Grit grows on me over time. I really didn't care for or get Fargo when I first saw it. But then over time, it grew on me and I appreciated it more and more. I still think it has its flaws, like all of the Coen Brothers films. But I admire them for their unique vision and storytelling interests. And they are clearly incredible filmmakers in terms of their craft. The Coen Brothers could be compared to sauerkraut. You probably don't like them initially on their own, but you come to appreciate them over time in the right context.",4,The Coen Brothers are an acquired taste...and they keep growing on

People did not talk this way in this country, ever at any time. Never mind. This is a fun pic. Jeff Bridges is great at reprising John Wayne's last big role. The only hitch is his choice of dialect, which makes much of what he growls almost inaudible. I turned on the subtitles to solve that problem. He clearly stole his voice and tone from the Karl character in the movie ""Sling Blade."" Down to a Tee. The young girl who dominates the picture does fine with her character, too.

1365721,A3AWPDBQLK3SZ8,B003UESJME,Brian Canter,"[0, 1]","In general I do not like remakes. The original True Grit is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie I saw as a kid with my dad and of course that in and of itself makes it memorable. However, it was a my favorite western (along with Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid) that I had ever seen. So, I was very hesitant to go and see this movie when it came out. It was different to say the least, but, in most ways a good different. What struck me first, as the movie opened, was the religious aspect with a scripture and the music that greeted the viewer (To a degree, this was weaved throughout the entire movie). The young lady who played Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) was fantastic. She of course is a huge part of the movie and overall I thought she was a better Mattie than Kim Darby was in the original. Jeff Bridges is fantastic but I have a hard time in comparing his role as ""Rooster"" to John Wayne from the original. In my opinion any attempt to compare them in this role is senseless. To me, Rooster is John Wayne. I believe what makes Jeff so good as Rooster is the dialogue and the way he talks throughout the movie.  Matt Damon as LaBoeuf, the Texas Ranger, is pretty good but the character he plays and Glen Campbell played seem very different and they can't be compared. The movie has more humor than the original and the scenery the viewer is taken on seems a little darker in my opinion (This seems to be a Coen brothers trait). I have never read the book so I cannot make any assessment if the movie stays more true to the book by Charles Portis than the original. In the end I came away from this movie enjoying it quite a bit. Is it as good as the original? To me it is different and I think you have to look at this movie in that way.

1365724,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B003UESJME,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[8, 13]","Scanning over the previous reviews, the point of contention for this film seems to be the ghost of John Wayne - many of the critical reviews were completely satisfied with the earlier version of the film and portray the remake as unnecessary and almost insulting.  I have felt the same way about other remakes; yet while I understand the point, I still feel that this film is extremely entertaining in its own right.  Those unfamiliar with the earlier film starring John Wayne can look at it and judge with unbiased eyes, but even those who appreciate the Duke's performance - if they approach this one as a different film entirely instead of simply a remake - should be able to eke out at least some satisfaction from this effort by the Coens.The story is - or should be - pretty familiar.  Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross is bent on revenge for her father's death, and she seeks out Marshall Cogburn, a man with a reputation for 'true grit', to track down the outlaw that committed the murder, Tom Chaney.  Along the way, the two pick up another lawman hunting for Chaney on an unrelated charge, the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf.  Tracking Chaney to the Oklahoma territory, Cogburn and Laboeuf face off against Lucky Ned Pepper's gang, which has taken Chaney in, and in the end, it is Mattie who must find her own store of grit when she meets her father's killer.It's a minimalist story.  As such, it is really more of a character study than an action film, and those who are used to the hyperkinetic activity in most modern films may find it slow paced or even boring.  But while watching the short trailer for 'True Grit' on IMDb, it would be easy to see how someone might think it is non-stop action.  I suppose no one should look for truth in advertising anymore, but it seems especially misleading to me.  This is one of the other sources of contention with the film, and I'll agree that it does seem to take too long to get going.  But from the moment Mattie fords the river between Fort Smith and the territories, finally in pursuit of Chaney, the movie settles into its own rhythm, and, for this viewer anyway, it is perfectly paced from then on.I would encourage viewers who enjoy film but shy away from westerns because of their tendency to rely on simplistic plots and monochramatic characters to give this one a try - the time and place of 'True Grit' is incidental.  While I think the directors make fantastic use of western film tropes, essentially it is all about the characters - not as a deep penetrating psychological study, but as an example of diversionary entertainment with an emphasis on people rather than action.  I only have one last quibble with the film, and that is the ending, which may be true to the novel but is tremendously anticlimactic.  No doubt it will draw some comparisons to the ending of 'No Country for Old Men', but while I enjoyed the Coen's earlier effort from start to finish, this one is book-ended by slight missteps that don't so much as detract from the overall value as they just don't amplify the experience.Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross is quite excellent, while Josh Brolin as Chaney only has a brief time onscreen, and makes only a slight impression.  Barry Pepper, who is probably one of the better actors you've never heard of, ironically plays Lucky NED Pepper, whom we see for approximately the same amount of time, yet he turns in another stellar performance, and Matt Damon, amazingly enough, is nearly able to transcend his Matt Damon-ness to convincingly play Ranger LaBoeuf far better than Glenn Campbell may ever have dreamed of.  Which leads us to Bridges, of course.  This to me is the crucial difference in the films.  Jeff Bridges plays Rooster Cogburn to the point that I forget he is Jeff Bridges, an actor I've never cared much for.  John Wayne, in the earlier version of 'True Grit', plays John Wayne.  There's nothing wrong with either one, in and of themselves - viewers who have a soft spot for the first incarnation of the film may enjoy the second one more if they leave comparisons behind, and accept that these are two different films rather than as if the remake is supposed to be an 'improvement'.This is an eminently entertaining movie - four-and-a-half stars since I'd stop short of calling it a masterpiece - but a great night out at the movies nonetheless.

1365727,A9XKE4OE48BNK,B003UESJME,Byron,"[2, 3]","I was excited about this movie as soon as I heard that the Coen brothers and Jeff Bridges were involved.  The comic effect of the heightened vocabulary of Portis' novel fits right in with the Coen's aesthetic, most notably Raising Arizona and O Brother Where Art Thou, but it's also present in many of their other films as well. Like an O Henry story, the Coen's characters often speak more eloquently than their educational or societal level would seem to support.Jeff Bridges is great as usual and Hailee Steinfeld is amazing as Mattie.

The story is easy to follow.  A teenage girl just about to pass into young adulthood loses everyone and everything when her parents are murdered in the Old West.  She hires Rooster Cogburn, played by Jeff Bridges, to track down the murderer, played by Josh Brolin.  On the trail of the murderer, they are accompanied by Matt Damon as a Texas ranger.All of these actors do a tremendous job but what really makes this film is the Coen Brothers attention to detail in fashioning an utterly believable Old West, somewhat along the lines of Robert Altman's groundbreaking ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller."" Also, the Coens did an entirely new script based upon the source novel.  The Coens are first rate screenwriters and it shows in this film.As to the actors, Jeff Bridges is again outstanding.  Rather than becoming an imitation John Wayne, he sinks into what a Rooster Cogburn in the Old West might really be like and inhabits Rooster like his standard outfit and guns.  There is nothing overblown about him at all and the performance is that much more effective for being quieter. Brolin makes a great villain as usual.  This is becoming a sideline of his which he is excellent at creating.  I first marveled at his villainy while he was playing Dan White in the Harvey Milk film.

It's a film that can't decide if it is a drama or a comedy, and is inept at both.

They look like they ought to be having a picnic. Brolin plays his role as a cheap, hapless victim when in fact he is supposed to be a menacing, calculating sociopath (in the book and original film, played by a brilliant Bruce Dern). The only decent performances are the young girl who plays Mattie and the horse trader she bargains with.I was particularly offended by a gratuitous scene in which Bridges character kicks a young native American, several times, for no reason, other than sitting on a porch. While it is true that racism was rampant at that time, the scene had no bearing on the story or action and was completely offensive.Additionally, though this film was made on location in central Texas, there is an enormous amount of poor quality CGI enhancement, and uneven recoloring to give it a washed out sepia tone in some scenes but not in others.Don't waste your time or money on this one.

1365740,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UESJME,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 16]","There's a scene in both versions of ""True Grit"" in which Deputy Marshall Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn tells fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross about his ex-wife and his son, who he hasn't seen in years and expects to never see again. As portrayed by John Wayne in the original 1969 version, we see an actor delivering his lines. As portrayed by Jeff Bridges in the 2010 remake, we listen to his garbled, drunken inflections of speech and realize that he's the full embodiment of Rooster Cogburn - gruff, past his prime, merciless, and trigger-happy. He's not a romanticized Western archetype, but a cantankerous, battle-scarred old man, one who has put on a few too many pounds and lost a few too many years of his life to alcohol. There is decency in him, although he's not a sentimental fool.Adapted from the novel by Charles Portis, ""True Grit"" is in some ways a typical Coen Brothers movie, especially in the way it finds humor in a thoroughly humorless situation. In other ways, it's not like a Coen Brothers movie at all; although they have been known for paying homage to genre films (""Blood Simple,"" ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" ""Intolerable Cruelty""), they rarely adhere so strongly to convention. They instead opt to add their own highly eccentric spin on the subject, usually in the form of off-the-wall characters and bizarre events. This has worked beautifully before, but in the case of ""True Grit,"" they made the right decision by sticking to convention. This is a western through and through, and it's precisely because of that that the film is a modern day classic.Taking place in Arkansas during the late 1800s, the center of the story is Mattie Ross (Haliee Steinfeld), who looks vaguely like Wednesday Addams and, despite being a teenager, has the financial knowhow of an accountant and the bargaining skills of a Turkish vendor. She's also a young woman of high standards and tremendous determination; when her father is murdered and robbed by one of his hired hands, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), Mattie vows that he will be caught and made to pay for his crimes. She asks about the best U.S. Deputy Marshall around and, after hearing several names, decides on Rooster Cogburn (Bridges), who has a reputation for being merciless. In Mattie's eyes, he has ""grit."" Old, drowning in alcohol, and saddled with only one eye, Rooster eventually consents to her requests, although he has no intention of taking her along. This is something the tenacious Mattie refuses to accept.Here enters La Boeuf (Matt Damon), a Texas Ranger sent to arrest Chaney on the charge of murder. His character is introduced in a moment so wonderfully clich&eacute;, it deserves recognition: As he sits in a chair on porch with his feet propped up on the railing and his hat tilted downwards, he lights a match and starts puffing away on a pipe. He thinks he should team up with Rooster, since he knows the Indian territory Chaney is hiding in. Mattie doesn't want him to tag along, mostly because she would rather Chaney be hanged for her father's murder than for someone else's. She doesn't get her way; La Boeuf is a part of the team. As the three travel across the wintery landscapes of Arkansas, they must face a number of obstacles, including Rooster's intended target, ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper), the leader of an outlaw gang Chaney is believed to be associated with.Although it may be blasphemous to say that Jeff Bridges gives a better performance than John Wayne, the simple fact is that Jeff Bridges gives a better performance than John Wayne. Consider a scene in the remake in which Rooster, loaded on whiskey, repeatedly shoots at cornbread he flings into the air; we don't see a western archetype but a broken man with a desperate need to prove himself. At that moment, he seems the most human. We may laugh at his drunkenness, but we're more inclined to feel sorry for him. I cannot think of a single scene in the original ""True Grit"" that displays this level of emotional resonance. Wayne was effective at making Rooster an antihero typecast, although he never made that character-to-audience connection, in all likelihood because of his distinctive monotone voice.The film itself, while telling virtually the same story as the 1969 film, is darker, edgier, and, in many instances, funnier. You might even say that it has ""grit."" The Coen Brothers do a fantastic job capturing the atmosphere of a western - the hard-boiled characters, the wild landscapes, the shootouts - while at the same time adding touches that heighten the material.

I still think his best performance ever was in 1984's &#34;Starman&#34;, but he does a bang-up job as Rooster Cogburn.  As I stated in the review of 1969's True Grit, he plays Cogburn in a much more deadpan fashion than does John Wayne, but it works anyway.  I've read the book, but I read it after seeing the 1969 version, so I read Cogburn with Wayne's humor in my head.  It's hard to think of him 'deadpan' -- but Bridges's Cogburn works; the whole movie works.  Matt Damon is GREAT as the verbose and pontificating Texas Ranger.  But Hailee Steinfeld steals the show.  She rules as the precocious Mattie Ross, driving the movie and keeping you eager to see her in the next scene.  There was only one thing I didn't like (but it's hardly important to the whole movie):  the person who played Mattie in later life (at the end of the movie) just didn't work; my husband and I both thought, &#34;there's no way that girl would have grown up to look like that.&#34;  People don't change THAT much.

That this would be compared to the original TRUE GRIT & that Jeff Bridges would face comparison with John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn was inevitable.Yet this is a different TRUE GRIT. Not in major story line but rather in the personalities as displayed in the book. Truth be told, the original, which I love, was much more John Wayne does John Wayne in TRUE GRIT than it was John Wayne becomes Rooster Cogburn in TRUE GRIT. The Coens set out to make a movie truer to its literary source & in that they have succeeded.I heard one complaint that Jeff Bridges would never be anything but Lloyd Bridge's son to a reviewer. How prejudicially blind. For one thing Jeff Bridges is a far better actor (able to change personality to fit a role) than his father & most certainly exceeds John Wayne who was a TOWERING screen presence but had to be cast as John Wayne or look & sound poorly. Wayne's voice was far beyond his control. Bridges will never equal that presence but who can?I heard that there were times when Bridges speech was hard to understand. Are we to send him to the alcoholic school for elocution? Of course he was difficult to understand, he was a raging drunk as in the book, not the grinning drinker Wayne played. Quite frankly it reminded me of the time I read a review that stated a certain girl walked around & looked vacant which made the show poor. She was playing a withdrawn girl with deep emotional problems, duh!This movie is a marvelously period perfect movie & the outdoor shots are the equal of any good western around. Matt Damon gives his best performance doing the Texas Ranger according to the book, and he became a better actor in doing so. Josh Brolin & Hailee Steinfeld (who is a great foil for Bridge's Cogburn) makes no mistakes in their portrayals either.This is a master piece of literary translation & a tremendous job of casting, acting & photography. I see so many shows now that have too many close-ups with no facial expression to see. Not so here. They made good use of close ups.If you intend to go see this & judge whether it is the equal of the original, you will be disappointed. It's not meant to be a modern original. This show is its own interpretation of the story of True Grit. If you intend to judge Bridges or any other character on whether they equaled the original you are wasting your time. This movie is an entire show on its own. It is the book in video images & the combination of personalities make a complete story. I loved it.In honor of The Duke who is unmatched in force & stature, I respectfully withhold a 1/2 star from this show.

They always speak in full words, ""won't"" is ""would not"" and ""isn't"" is always ""is not"" and that is not--I did an online investigation--the way people spoke in the old West.  It makes for a painful ride, as it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Every character in the entire movie speaks in this very unconventional manner, and it detracts from the film.  Oh sure, True Grit has tons of other pitfalls--Jason Bourne miscast as a wimpy Texan with moustache like a dime store Charlie Chan, and Haille S. acting like a cardboard cutout in her first onscreen role.  Hey, just because she's a kid doesn't mean she can act. And of course, the biggest blunder, the buffoon Lebowski now playing the buffoon Rooster Cogburn. Bridges has some talent, but not enough to carry an otherwise Saturday matinee quality movie. The plot is thinner than a snakeskin coin purse, and gallops along at a meander with little or no tension (sure there was tension when the Texas ranger went to the shack and the bad guys were riding up behind him, but then we had to hear for 30 minutes how the ranger hated Rooster for shooting him when he saved his life.  I'd have been kissing the guy!).Overacted, understoried, straight ahead western with little going for it... a cast off in comparison to other superb movies in 2010 (e.g Black Swan, The King's Speech).  A rip-snorting western this is not, it's merely a straight ahead tale of revenge with comedic moments that fall flat, and of course, the damned stilted language.

Did the Coen's have some researcher find out that all the people in the Old West were going around with some sort of speech impediment?

1365753,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B003UESJME,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[3, 5]","Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men, Fargo) have extended their filmmaking prowess into new territory by adapting Charles Portis' famous novel, True Grit, and their interpretation is a refreshing take on the western genre and compares favorably to the memorable John Wayne starring version of 1969.  Purists who thought it would be sacrilege to remake a western classic have little to fear.  Thanks to a smart script and strong acting, True Grit comes off as a very solid film with some similarities and noticeable differences from the original film.Told in flashback by a woman's voice, a 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) wants to avenge the murder of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (a grizzled Josh Brolin), and she arrives in a small town to hire Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an aged, hard drinking veteran lawman who has done his share of killing and more.  Mattie is not one to be trifled with and as another pursuer, Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), realizes, not one to intimidate.  Headstrong, she has grit herself.  Together the trio search for Chaney and seek out a lead in another outlaw, Ned Pepper (an unrecognizable Barry Pepper).  As friction mounts among the searchers, LeBoeuf strikes out on his own, and Cogburn and Mattie come upon a cabin. There, a couple of outlaws are smoked out, and this leads to Ned Pepper and his gang. Can Chaney be far behind?  It all culminates in a final confrontation between Cogburn and Ned Pepper as Mattie comes face to face with her quarry and LeBoeuf reenters the scene with violent results.Bridges (Crazy Hearts) is utterly convincing in making this version of Rooster Cogburn his own persona.  He portrays him as a proud, grumpy curmudgeon who just may be a crack shot and smarter than he lets on.  This takes nothing away from the over the top performance of John Wayne who won an Oscar for his rendition.  You could almost see Tommy Lee Jones in this role.  We gets bits and pieces of Cogburn's past, and some of the tales make you wonder if they are utter fabrications or sheer exaggeration.  Steinfeld is a marvel in her first movie role.  She embodies Mattie as a take charge gal who will not be deterred and has enough smarts and spunk to strike a hard bargain with any man.  Witness her amusing negotiations with a horse trader and wearing him down.  Damon (Good Will Hunting) does well in a supporting role and adds more nuance than Glen Campbell's version of LaBoeuf did in the older version.  Brolin and Pepper have what amount to small but memorable screen time as the bad guys.The dynamics of the trio are interestingly portrayed as LeBoeuf and Cogburn face off and trade barbs, while Mattie asserts herself every chance she gets.  You even think there might be a hint of attraction between Mattie and LeBoeuf.  The arc of LeBoeuf's character deviates from the 1969 film significantly especially at the climax.  The only negative is that his fate is left open ended and unresolved.Much of the film is superior to the older version.  There is really only one scene that would suffer in comparison to the original film, and that is the climactic charge by Cogburn against the bad guys.  Bridges does well but he is not John Wayne.  The scene lacks the heroic, mythic feel of Wayne.  Also, when Bridges is shown in closeup carrying Mattie to safety, it seems a bit phony.  But those are minor observations.  A final sequence shows what happens many years afterward and serves as a melancholy postscript, and it has a final feel of a film like Unforgiven.  The film could easily work without it though.Thanks to the Coens, the authentic sounding dialogue, which is laced with humorous moments including a shooting contest between Cogburn and LeBoeuf, is peppy and sharp, a marked improvement from standard western fare.  There are times when Bridges' drawling and inflections are hard to understand but you get the gist anyway through context and body language.  Technical crafts are standout especially a good musical score by Carter Burwell and beautiful cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins (A Beautiful Mind).The Coen brothers must have been drawn to the quirky characters and the language of the novel, and while this is certainly not their best film, it is a very entertaining western with some standout performances.",4,TRUE GRIT and a Girl's Mission,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,4327,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Fargo', 'have', 'extended', 'filmmaking', 'prowess', 'new', 'territory', 'adapting', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'famous', 'novel', 'True', 'Grit', 'interpretation', 'refreshing', 'take', 'western', 'genre', 'favorably', 'memorable', 'John', 'Wayne', 'starring', 'version', '1969', 'Purists', 'who', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'sacrilege', 'remake', 'western', 'classic', 'have', 'little', 'fear', 'Thanks', 'smart', 'script', 'strong', 'acting', 'True', 'Grit', 'off', 'very', 'solid', 'film', 'similarities', 'noticeable', 'differences', 'original', 'film.Told', 'flashback', 'woman', 'voice', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'avenge', 'murder', 'father', 'hands', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'grizzled', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'small', 'town', 'hire', 'Marshal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'aged', 'hard', 'drinking', 'veteran', 'lawman', 'who', 'done', 'share', 'killing', 'more', 'Mattie', 'not', 'one', 'be', 'trifled', 'pursuer', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LaBoeuf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'not', 'one', 'intimidate', 'Headstrong', 'grit', 'Together', 'trio', 'search', 'Chaney', 'seek', 'out', 'lead', 'outlaw', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'unrecognizable', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'friction', 'mounts', 'searchers', 'LeBoeuf', 'out', 'own', 'Cogburn', 'Mattie', 'come', 'cabin', 'couple', 'outlaws', 'are', 'smoked', 'out', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'gang', 'Can', 'Chaney', 'be', 'far', 'culminates', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Cogburn', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Mattie', 'face', 'face', 'quarry', 'LeBoeuf', 'scene', 'violent', 'results.Bridges', 'Crazy', 'Hearts', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'making', 'version', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'own', 'persona', 'proud', 'grumpy', 'curmudgeon', 'who', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'crack', 'shot', 'smarter', 'nothing', 'away', 'top', 'performance', 'John', 'Wayne', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'rendition', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'role', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Cogburn', 'past', 'tales', 'make', 'wonder', 'are', 'utter', 'fabrications', 'sheer', 'exaggeration', 'Steinfeld', 'marvel', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'Mattie', 'take', 'charge', 'gal', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'deterred', 'enough', 'smarts', 'spunk', 'strike', 'hard', 'bargain', 'man', 'amusing', 'negotiations', 'horse', 'trader', 'wearing', 'down', 'Damon', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'well', 'supporting', 'role', 'more', 'nuance', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'version', 'LaBoeuf', 'did', 'older', 'version', 'Brolin', 'Pepper', 'have', 'what', 'amount', 'small', 'memorable', 'screen', 'time', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'dynamics', 'trio', 'are', 'interestingly', 'portrayed', 'LeBoeuf', 'Cogburn', 'face', 'trade', 'barbs', 'Mattie', 'chance', 'even', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'hint', 'attraction', 'Mattie', 'LeBoeuf', 'arc', 'LeBoeuf', 'character', '1969', 'film', 'significantly', 'especially', 'climax', 'only', 'negative', 'fate', 'left', 'open', 'ended', 'unresolved.Much', 'film', 'superior', 'older', 'version', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'would', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'original', 'film', 'climactic', 'charge', 'Cogburn', 'bad', 'guys', 'Bridges', 'well', 'not', 'John', 'Wayne', 'scene', 'heroic', 'mythic', 'feel', 'Wayne', 'Also', 'when', 'Bridges', 'shown', 'closeup', 'carrying', 'Mattie', 'safety', 'bit', 'phony', 'are', 'minor', 'observations', 'final', 'sequence', 'what', 'many', 'years', 'afterward', 'melancholy', 'postscript', 'final', 'feel', 'film', 'Unforgiven', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'work', 'Coens', 'authentic', 'sounding', 'dialogue', 'laced', 'humorous', 'moments', 'including', 'shooting', 'contest', 'Cogburn', 'LeBoeuf', 'peppy', 'sharp', 'marked', 'improvement', 'standard', 'western', 'fare', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Bridges', 'drawling', 'inflections', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'get', 'gist', 'anyway', 'context', 'body', 'language', 'Technical', 'crafts', 'are', 'standout', 'especially', 'good', 'musical', 'score', 'Carter', 'Burwell', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'veteran', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', '.The', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'quirky', 'characters', 'language', 'novel', 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'very', 'entertaining', 'western', 'standout', 'performances']",True Grit

1365758,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B003UESJME,Daddy,"[1, 1]","Were it not for John Wayne's legendary portrayal of Rooster Cogburn, this version of True Grit might stand on its own merit as a top-notch western, and Jeff Bridges might very well have taken the place of the legendary Duke.  If you have never seen the 1969 original True Grit, starring John Wayne and Glen Campbell, you may not appreciate or understand my comments herein. I recommend seeing the original as well, if you haven't already. In this remake, Jeff Bridges plays US Marshal Rooster Cogburn, Matt Damon plays Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, Josh Brolin plays killer Tom Chaney, Hailee Steinfeld plays the young Mattie Ross. Jeff Bridges carries the movie in his outstanding performance as Cogburn, equally rivaling the legendary John Wayne in the same role.  Matt Damon is absolutely superb as LaBoeuf, far outshining Glenn Campbell's performance in the original version. Hailee Steinfeld is very convincing and likeable as Mattie Ross, a bit more professionally played than that of Kim Darby in the 1969 version.  In further comparison to the 1969 original, this remake has more in depth look at the characters and a more personalized appeal.  The remake follows the original in most ways, including much of the dialog. However, there are minor additions and differences along the way... and a very different added-on ending - in which the adult Mattie returns twenty years later to visit Rooster Cogburn, only to learn he died a few days earlier - this added bit at the end diminishes the impact of the rest of the story... the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.  One other difference is the end of LaBoeuf... in the remake, LaBoeuf (Damon) lives and goes on alone. In the original, LaBoeuf (Campbell) dies of a head wound - sitting on his horse - while pulling Cogburn and Ross from the snake pit. And John Wayne has the great line; ""That's twice he saved my life... once when he was already dead."" (something like that)... which I prefered as the end of that scene. In any case, remake or not, this version of True Grit is a great movie... and Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon are outstanding.",4,A great movie... a great remake,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2107,"['Were', 'not', 'John', 'Wayne', 'legendary', 'portrayal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'version', 'True', 'Grit', 'might', 'stand', 'own', 'merit', 'top-notch', 'western', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'legendary', 'Duke', 'have', 'never', 'seen', '1969', 'original', 'True', 'Grit', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'understand', 'comments', 'herein', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'original', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'remake', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'US', 'Marshal', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LaBoeuf', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'killer', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'young', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Cogburn', 'equally', 'rivaling', 'legendary', 'John', 'Wayne', 'same', 'role', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'LaBoeuf', 'far', 'outshining', 'Glenn', 'Campbell', 'performance', 'original', 'version', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'very', 'convincing', 'likeable', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'bit', 'more', 'professionally', 'played', 'Kim', 'Darby', '1969', 'version', 'further', 'comparison', '1969', 'original', 'remake', 'more', 'depth', 'look', 'characters', 'more', 'personalized', 'appeal', 'remake', 'original', 'most', 'ways', 'including', 'much', 'dialog', 'However', 'are', 'minor', 'additions', 'differences', 'way', 'very', 'different', 'added-on', 'ending', 'adult', 'Mattie', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'visit', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'only', 'learn', 'died', 'few', 'days', 'earlier', 'added', 'bit', 'end', 'impact', 'rest', 'story', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'One', 'other', 'difference', 'end', 'LaBoeuf', 'remake', 'LaBoeuf', 'Damon', 'alone', 'original', 'LaBoeuf', 'Campbell', 'head', 'sitting', 'horse', 'pulling', 'Cogburn', 'Ross', 'snake', 'pit', 'John', 'Wayne', 'great', 'line', 'twice', 'saved', 'life', 'once', 'when', 'was', 'already', 'dead', 'something', 'prefered', 'end', 'scene', 'case', 'remake', 'not', 'version', 'True', 'Grit', 'great', 'movie', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'are', 'outstanding']",True Grit

1365760,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003UESJME,DanD,"[4, 7]","The Coen Brother's reworking of Charles Portis's novel TRUE GRIT is not quite what you'd expect from the makers of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and FARGO.  It's not dark, it's not depressing, and there's very little sense of anarchical chaos.  The film is more in line with the spiritual undertones of O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?, without that film's campy rumpus (or George's Clooney's hair).  It's a serious piece, with dashes of humor, that never takes itself seriously.  It's a more-or-less uplifting tale of challenges and proving your worth.  The film follows young Protestant girl Mattie Ross, whose father has been murdered by Tom Chaney.  Mattie recruits alcholic Marshall Rooster Cogburn; tagging alone for the ride is Texas Ranger LaBoef.  Together, they track down Chaney, face down an evil gang of ne'er-do-wells, and become fast and lasting friends in the process.That's right--this is (almost) family-friend Coen Brothers.  But don't let that deter you.  The Coens inhabit Portis's pretension-vs.-violence world like a second skin.  The film hews closely to the novel, as the Coens did with Cormac McCarthy's NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  This means that the language feels clunky at first, though coming from Hailee Steinfeld, it feels natural, even poetic.  Steinfeld is a true find--this is her film, and she manages to hold her own against her formidable costars.  That list includes Jeff Bridges, sinking his teeth into the role of Cogburn; Matt Damon, affecting a faux-nonchalance as LaBoef; Josh Brolin, thoroughly menacing (and slightly pitiful) as Chaney; Barry Pepper, absolutely fantastic as gang leader Lucky Ned Pepper; and other actors who've made their way into previous Coen collaborations.  The fact that the three leads were all nominated for major awards (Steinfeld and Bridges for Oscars) says something; the fact that two of the most prominent stars, Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin, take on relatively minor roles, suggests their dedication to such a fine work of cinema.  And you can't ignore the other eight Oscar nominations, either--including Best Screenplay, Best Directing, Cinematography (Roger Deakins, back again), and Motion Picture of the Year.Overall, TRUE GRIT is another Coen Brothers masterpiece.  It's different from their others--this is a Coen film you can take your kids to see.  They'll get a little scared in spots (the film does get intense), but they won't be scarred for life.  But don't let that fool you, or sway you from seeing the film--it's 100% Coen Brothers, another fine work of art in their catalog.",5,"A beatiful, well-crafted film...another Coen Brothers masterpiece.",1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,2553,"['Coen', 'Brother', 'reworking', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'novel', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'not', 'quite', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'makers', 'NO', 'COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'FARGO', 'not', 'dark', 'not', 'depressing', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'anarchical', 'chaos', 'film', 'more', 'line', 'spiritual', 'undertones', 'O', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', 'film', 'campy', 'rumpus', 'George', 'Clooney', 'hair', 'serious', 'piece', 'dashes', 'humor', 'never', 'seriously', 'more-or-less', 'uplifting', 'tale', 'challenges', 'proving', 'worth', 'film', 'young', 'Protestant', 'girl', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'father', 'been', 'murdered', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Mattie', 'alcholic', 'Marshall', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'tagging', 'alone', 'ride', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LaBoef', 'Together', 'track', 'down', 'Chaney', 'face', 'down', 'evil', 'gang', ""ne'er-do-wells"", 'become', 'fast', 'lasting', 'friends', 'process.That', 'right', 'almost', 'family-friend', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'Coens', 'inhabit', 'Portis', 'pretension-vs.-violence', 'world', 'second', 'skin', 'film', 'closely', 'novel', 'Coens', 'did', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'NO', 'COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'language', 'clunky', 'first', 'though', 'coming', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'natural', 'even', 'poetic', 'Steinfeld', 'true', 'find', 'film', 'hold', 'own', 'formidable', 'costars', 'list', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'sinking', 'teeth', 'role', 'Cogburn', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'affecting', 'faux-nonchalance', 'LaBoef', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'thoroughly', 'menacing', 'slightly', 'pitiful', 'Chaney', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'gang', 'leader', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'other', 'actors', 'who', ""'ve"", 'made', 'way', 'previous', 'Coen', 'collaborations', 'fact', 'three', 'leads', 'were', 'nominated', 'major', 'awards', 'Steinfeld', 'Bridges', 'Oscars', 'something', 'fact', 'two', 'most', 'prominent', 'stars', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'take', 'relatively', 'minor', 'roles', 'dedication', 'fine', 'work', 'cinema', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'other', 'eight', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Directing', 'Cinematography', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'back', 'again', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Year.Overall', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'masterpiece', 'different', 'others', 'Coen', 'film', 'can', 'take', 'kids', 'see', ""'ll"", 'get', 'little', 'scared', 'spots', 'film', 'get', 'intense', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'scarred', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'sway', 'seeing', 'film', '100', '%', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'fine', 'work', 'art', 'catalog']",True Grit

Matt Damon is miscast as Leboeuf but plays the Texas Ranger as well as he can. Josh Brolin also feels wrong as the evil Tom Chaney. That aside, the DVD is a keeper.

Yes, it's a good film but it's got some serious flaws that prevent it from being the ""hit"" some are making it out to be. First, the good stuff: This is a very good retelling of the original. The production values were excellent. The filmmakers didn't stray too far from the original but were still able to inject some new and interesting things into the film that the original didn't have. Still, the original is much better.Now, for the bad stuff: Jeff Bridges was very hard to understand. I understand that it was part of his character but it just made it very frustrating. It's not entertaining having to rewind and try to figure out what he was saying . Use subtitles while watching this and I guess you'll be OK. His mumbling was atrocious. Second, the actress playing Mattie was just awful. I'm sorry, I know a lot of people like her but her acting was just too affected and annoying.

Her turn as Mattie Ross is feisty and knowing that belies her tender years.  She reminds me of a young Jodie Foster or Natalie Portman.  Great things are in store for Steinfeld and I can't wait.  Roger Deakins' lenswork is evocative and lyrical and adds texture to the film.  Deakins' work is not show-offy and acts as a greek chorus to the proceedings.  Jeff Bridges' account of Rooster Cogburn only vaguely recalls John Wayne's work in the 1969 film, rather, he gives Cogburn characteristics only Bridges could imagine.  I admire the original film but I was never a huge fan of it.  The weakness in it and this version probably falls in the basic story based on the novel by Charles Portis.  The story is alright but nothing special just standard Western fare.

It is that dialogue which makes this film a delight for the ear as well as the eye.  The scene in which Steinfeld haggles over the price of some horses is especially well-written and -acted.  Bridges inhabits the role of Rooster Cogburn in his usual understated manner.  The contrast between his rough manners (we can almost see his body odor) and the flashy Texas Ranger (complete with jangling spurs) who joins in the hunt (Matt Damon) permits the Coens to explore the full spectrum of personalities that attempted to keep the peace in a land that was filling up faster than the law could keep pace.

1365768,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B003UESJME,David J. Brown,"[2, 6]","It still baffles my mind that some are STILL voiting this film down and comparing it to the John Wayne film, still calling it a remake.  If something is based on a previously published work, like a book, comic, or play, then making it more than once does not mean the latter versions are remaking the first.  To clear this up for all time, let me point this out, how many times has Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet been made into films(all based on a stage play)?  Was Kenneth Branaugh's mid 90's film a remake of the early 90's version of Hamlet or was it a remake of the Olivier one?  Or was it a remake of a specific production of the play on stage?  Yeah, none of the above, it was a new adaption of the written play.  Get it?  I knew that you could.I love Charles Portis' writings and I love his novel True Grit.  It's one of my top favorite pieces of literature.  I hold his works up there with Mark Twain and Shakespeare!  Now I don't dislike the John Wayne film.  I like it.  It's not a great movie, and it's certainly not the best John Wayne film(that belongs to Rio Bravo if you ask me).  Sure, he won his first and only Academy Award for it, but I think that was more for his body of work and not so much for that particular role.  The original is an okay adaption of the novel.  I found Wayne's version of Rooster Cogburn to be watered down and made more likeable.  It's basically John Wayne with a different name.  Here, thanks to the Coen Brothers, we get a truer representation of these characters and what the book was really about.  The most important thing about this film adaption and what makes it the book is the fact that it is told 100% from Mattie's point of view.  This is what made the book great and original especially when it comes to Westerns.  No, not all events are the same, not all scenes from the book are here, and YES things have been added to replace things from the book.  This is a MOVIE.  This is NOT A BOOK.  Book's have freedom, films do not.  All changes were made to give it it's visual nature and to get to the themes and story points faster in terms of how films are told.  If you still don't get that, then you are lost.This is truly a Coen's brothers film.  It looks and feels like one.  But it is so close to the book, like what they did with their masterpiece No Country For Old Men.  The only thing that a hardcore Coen Brother's fan, like me, could discredit this film for is be the most straight ahead film they've ever made.  There's really no Coen Brothers quirks to it.  It's to the point, with no sidetracks.  No Country fit their style and type of stories they like to tell, so it meshed together.  Here we have a basic Western with themes of losing innocence, but a damn well made and acted one.  This film is exceptionally directed and designed.  There isn't one misjudged moment or bad performance.  Roger Deakins(a usual collaborator of the Coens) make a beautiful picture while keeping a realistic view of the gritty, down and dirty West.  The vistas feel real, but the time and people don't seem romanticized.  Great.One can't say enough about the acting in this film.  Newcomer Haley Steinfeld(who was righfully nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal in this film) shines in every moment.  She never once feels like a modern teenager playing in the old West.  She fits right in, from her speech to her mannerisms.  No cloying kid here.  She's a real person, a determined and self righteous person who has to learn the hard way that the best laid plans don't always follow through.  Jeff Bridges has the flashiest role, of course he is playing the immortal Rooster Cogburn.  Of course Bridges leaves Wayne's portrayal in the dust, Bridges is a great actor, while Wayne was simply a great movie star.  Bridge mumbles, stares down, and convincingly plays drunk while never losing his hard edge or making the audience dislike him.  This is the best role and best performance he's given in a long time, even better than his Oscar winning role in Crazy Heart.  Matt Damon is sublime in a role that had the weakest acting link in the original film, which was sad because he is such a great character in the book.  He brings comedy in his hubris and state pride for Texas.  His and Bridges chemistry could work in ten more movies.  Now this character has been mildly toned down from the book.  While they keep his disdain for Mattie in, they soften it ever so slightly.  Finally, we get our villains played by Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper.  Bother are great and memorable, which is amazing considering they have the least screen time.  And calling them villains does a disservice to the writing, especially how they are portrayed in the movie.  Yes, they're bad, killers, and outlaws but they are played as real people doing what they need to do to get by.  While Brolin's character is a sociopath, Pepper's character seems more like a trashy business man just trying to get by in a world where the hand he was dealt wasn't the best.The blu ray looks and sounds amazing.  Deakins photography looks beautiful.  The only thing that is unfortunate, but I'm used to it when it comes to Coen Brothers movies, is the lack of their involvement and their voices on the special features.  I would love for them to talk about how they adapted the book and their reason for taking this classic to the big screen for a second adaption.  What we do get is great but short.  Behind the scenes with Mattie Ross is basically a showcase for newcomer Steinfeld who comes off just as smart and sassy as the character she plays in the film.  Outfitting the Old West is a great featurette regarding the design and costuming of the film and how they reached and strived for authenticiy.  There's a similar feature regarding the weapons used in the film.  There is a feature interviewing the cast but it's mostly fluff where they go on praising each other, which isn't unwarranted, but it's not that deep.  Finally, we get some features about the building of Fort Smith and a focus feature on Roger Deakins.  All good, if you're into that stuff.  The greatest feature for me on this disc is a mini doc called Charles Portis-The Greatest Writer You've Never Heard Of.  It goes over his starts, his career, and his greatest works in much depth.  It interviews other authors and admirers of the great author.  I wasn't expecting something like this and I hope it peaks enough interest for more folks to seek his works out.  It's a fitting doc considering how detached this film is from the John Wayne film and how it is so much more in the spirit of Portis' prose.This film is a great straigh forward Western that belongs in the ranks with Rio Brave, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West, Outlaw Joesy Whales, Cat Balou, and of course Unforgiven.  It's funny, exciting, emotionally resonant and better made than any film made last year on the level of writing, directing and acting.PS: This film is rated PG-13.  Although, somehow it does have two moments of graphic onscreen violence.  I felt like I was watching an R rated film.  I am supposing the MPAA justifies this by the fact that there are very few violent moments in the film, so it's okay to be graphic.  I don't know.  I do know that the MPAA is a political thing, a money making thing, that really has no use anymore.  Filmmakers should censor themselves and the viewing public should be respected enough and informed enough to judge what they find offensive.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","The original 1969 film (which garnered John Wayne an Oscar) is a cinematic icon, yet it's a tad sanitized and whitewashed.  The Coen brothers' 2010 version of TRUE GRIT is a rugged, gritty (pardon the pun), more realistic depiction of a 19th Century manhunt in the Indian Territories.  (And in this reviewer's opinion a much more enjoyable version than its predecessor.)  Viewers of the original film will instantly recognize much of the dialogue has been plugged into the Coen brothers' remake, and it's grand fun to hear Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Hailee Steinfeld repeat several juicy lines first uttered by Wayne, Glen Campbell, and Kim Darby.  Thus the modern version pays affectionate homage to the original.We're all familiar with the story:  Young, determined Mattie Ross hires Marshall Rooster Cogburn--a man known to have ""true grit""--to leave Fort Smith and go into the Indian Nations to capture outlaw Tom Chaney and bring him to justice for the murder of her father.  They are joined by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf, and over the course of their search they cross paths with Chaney and a band of outlaws riding under the direction of Lucky Ned Pepper.  Mattie does see Chaney meet his maker, yet during this encounter she falls victim to a rattlesnake bite, forcing Rooster to ride a horse to death in order to save her life.  There's a decided twist from the original, in that the film ends with 38-year-old Mattie journeying to a Wild West Show in hopes of meeting (and thanking) Rooster, who is traveling with the show--yet unfortunately, Rooster has died only days before.Bridges is stellar as ornery, hard-drinking Rooster, while Damon is light years better as LaBoeuf than wooden Glen Campbell.  In fact, Steinfeld, Bridges, and Damon all play well off one another, augmented by solid performances from Josh Brolin as Chaney and Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned.  There is violence and gore in this remake not for the faint of heart, but again, this version is grittier, more realistic, and meaner than its predecessor.  As a matter of fact, this Coen brothers' remake of TRUE GRIT stands alone on its merits as one very good Western.--D.

It captures, in an authentically gritty way, the drama, suspense and even humor of the story of 14 year-old Mattie Ross, who sets out in mid-winter into post-Civil War Indian country in search of the low-life who murdered her father.Mattie (well-played by Hailee Steinfeld) is brave beyond her years. She is accompanied by an aging one-eyed U.S. Marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a tough, pitiless man who has worked both sides of the law. The pair are joined by Le Beouf (Matt Damon), a slightly fussy Texas Ranger with his own agenda. The three of theme will chase the shiftless Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin) to his hideout with bandit chieftain Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper).Mattie sets the tone for the movie with her bravado performance in Fort Smith, as she somehow bullies an undertaker and a horse trader into doing business on her terms. The emotionally moving scene in which she dresses herself for the trip with her father's outsized clothing and gun is pitch-perfect. The slow rolling middle of the movie allows for Mattie and the lonely Rooster to strike up a friendship. The ending will load up the suspense, as Mattie finally confronts her father's killer.Comparisons with the original 1969 movie starring John Wayne are perhaps inevitable, but this movie can stand on its own as well-done and entertaining; recommended.",4,Going to the limit for justice...,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,1439,"['2010', 'version', '34', 'True', 'Grit', '34', 'worthy', 'retelling', 'novel', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'authentically', 'gritty', 'way', 'drama', 'suspense', 'even', 'humor', 'story', '14', 'year-old', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'who', 'out', 'mid-winter', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'Indian', 'country', 'search', 'low-life', 'who', 'murdered', 'father.Mattie', 'well-played', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'brave', 'years', 'accompanied', 'aging', 'one-eyed', 'U.S', 'Marshal', 'named', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'tough', 'pitiless', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'sides', 'law', 'pair', 'are', 'joined', 'Le', 'Beouf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'slightly', 'fussy', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'own', 'agenda', 'three', 'theme', 'will', 'chase', 'shiftless', 'Tom', 'Cheney', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'hideout', 'bandit', 'chieftain', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Barry', 'Pepper', '.Mattie', 'tone', 'movie', 'bravado', 'performance', 'Fort', 'Smith', 'bullies', 'undertaker', 'horse', 'trader', 'doing', 'business', 'terms', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'scene', 'trip', 'father', 'outsized', 'clothing', 'gun', 'pitch-perfect', 'slow', 'rolling', 'middle', 'movie', 'Mattie', 'lonely', 'Rooster', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'ending', 'will', 'load', 'up', 'suspense', 'Mattie', 'finally', 'father', 'killer.Comparisons', 'original', '1969', 'movie', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'are', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'movie', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'well-done', 'entertaining', 'recommended']",True Grit

As an agnostic fan of the Coen Brothers, and as an original dyed-in-the-wool John Wayne fan, what matters most here is being a true film fan. It isn't often I get to preach my film philosophy: it is ART, and one cannot take potshots at one artwork just because it is a newer version than another.Jeff Bridges as Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn is a surprise - more than usual - cast in this role. He is a gruff old-timer, yes, but he's not heartless or witless. As with all the perfect acting in this film, Bridges becomes a certain embodiment of the 'Old West' - and not as we imagine or guess, but close to what it really was, as close as we can get. Like Charles Portis' original novel.Matt Damon (as Texas Ranger LaBoeuf) is happily mostly absent from this film, as I am not a huge fan of his. Yet his screen time is not wasted, and he too sinks his teeth into the role. It's as if all the actors really felt they had traveled back to the late 19th century and needed to convince them back then - as well as convincing us today. What a crowning glory for these two directors, whose movies I generally like but then I never know they are the directors until I look them up - sloppy of me.The locations in New Mexico and Texas are as gorgeous and symbolic as anything Kurosawa or Ford ever did; the dialogue is probably over the heads of most youngsters today. I understood every clever, hilarious line and Portis' well timed jokes.Some people have complained of mumbled or incomprehensible lines. Well, they are hearing a type of ""old"" English and that was what I was taught to speak after I learned the King's English. The sound of the people here brought a tear to my eye: everyone I knew who sounded like them has been long dead.The details are rich and satisfying, from the two-second shot of Judge Isaac Parker (Jake Walker) to the dying of young Moon (Domhnall Gleeson of HARRY POTTER fame). The snappy back-and-forth, as it was written by Portis, is executed so well I cannot fathom how the actors could break away from the performances. Another example: reviewers have complained about LaBoeuf's weird speech impediment. Is that how closely they watched this film? He was dragged several yards and nearly bit through his tongue!There's no denying that Hailee Steinfeld as young Mattie is sweet and capable, tough and competent. Nothing was wasted in this film, but there was no overblowing the characters or performances and she held her own alongside Bridges, Damon and the stunning scenes she shared with an absolutely evil Josh Brolin (Tom Chaney). Details such as those seem wasted on an attention-deficient young audience who expects video games instead of deep, well-filmed drama.Seeing Cogburn viciously kick two Indian children was both laugh-out-loud and heartwrenching, as Mattie coldly observes him do it, but so it was in that time. The Coens do not shirk their tasks and they teach other directors the lesson that the devil is in the details - but so is the glory. If I have one tiny criticism, it is the slightly operatic way the music was inserted at key moments. It simply did not rise to the occasion, but with the soundtrack, the Coens were paying homage, as they constantly do, to the old ways.You'd be a fool not to own this classic, beautiful film. It has every single element I remember from the greatest Westerns, it is no parody or simple remake. I doubt Kurosawa or even Ford could have achieved this level of greatness. With more talent than I have allowed myself time to delineate here, I'll just repeat: this is one HELL of a great film. I actually feel privileged that I got to enjoy something like this.",5,"""A Resolute Officer of Parker's Court, 1903""",1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,3729,"['TRUE', 'GRIT', '2010', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'dramatic', 'unique', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'agnostic', 'fan', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'original', 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'what', 'most', 'here', 'being', 'true', 'film', 'fan', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'preach', 'film', 'philosophy', 'ART', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'potshots', 'one', 'artwork', 'just', 'newer', 'version', 'another.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Reuben', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'surprise', 'more', 'usual', 'cast', 'role', 'gruff', 'old-timer', 'yes', 'not', 'heartless', 'witless', 'perfect', 'acting', 'film', 'Bridges', 'certain', 'embodiment', ""'Old"", 'West', 'not', 'imagine', 'guess', 'close', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'original', 'novel.Matt', 'Damon', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LaBoeuf', 'happily', 'mostly', 'absent', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'wasted', 'too', 'teeth', 'role', 'actors', 'really', 'felt', 'had', 'traveled', 'back', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'needed', 'convince', 'back', 'then', 'as', 'well', 'convincing', 'today', 'What', 'crowning', 'glory', 'two', 'directors', 'movies', 'generally', 'like', 'then', 'never', 'know', 'are', 'directors', 'look', 'up', 'sloppy', 'me.The', 'locations', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Texas', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'symbolic', 'anything', 'Kurosawa', 'Ford', 'ever', 'did', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'heads', 'most', 'youngsters', 'today', 'understood', 'clever', 'hilarious', 'line', 'Portis', 'well', 'timed', 'jokes.Some', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'mumbled', 'incomprehensible', 'lines', 'Well', 'are', 'hearing', 'type', 'old', 'English', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'taught', 'speak', 'learned', 'King', 'English', 'sound', 'people', 'here', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'everyone', 'knew', 'who', 'sounded', 'been', 'long', 'dead.The', 'details', 'are', 'rich', 'satisfying', 'two-second', 'shot', 'Judge', 'Isaac', 'Parker', 'Jake', 'Walker', 'dying', 'young', 'Moon', 'Domhnall', 'Gleeson', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'fame', 'snappy', 'back-and-forth', 'was', 'written', 'Portis', 'executed', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'how', 'actors', 'could', 'break', 'away', 'performances', 'example', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'LaBoeuf', 'weird', 'speech', 'impediment', 'how', 'closely', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'dragged', 'several', 'yards', 'nearly', 'bit', 'tongue', 'denying', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'young', 'Mattie', 'sweet', 'capable', 'tough', 'competent', 'Nothing', 'was', 'wasted', 'film', 'was', 'overblowing', 'characters', 'performances', 'held', 'own', 'alongside', 'Bridges', 'Damon', 'stunning', 'scenes', 'shared', 'absolutely', 'evil', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Details', 'such', 'seem', 'wasted', 'attention-deficient', 'young', 'audience', 'who', 'video', 'games', 'instead', 'deep', 'well-filmed', 'drama.Seeing', 'Cogburn', 'viciously', 'kick', 'two', 'Indian', 'children', 'was', 'laugh-out-loud', 'heartwrenching', 'Mattie', 'coldly', 'do', 'was', 'time', 'Coens', 'do', 'not', 'shirk', 'tasks', 'teach', 'other', 'directors', 'lesson', 'devil', 'details', 'so', 'glory', 'have', 'one', 'tiny', 'criticism', 'slightly', 'operatic', 'way', 'music', 'was', 'inserted', 'key', 'moments', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'rise', 'occasion', 'soundtrack', 'Coens', 'were', 'paying', 'homage', 'constantly', 'do', 'old', 'ways.You', ""'d"", 'be', 'fool', 'not', 'own', 'classic', 'beautiful', 'film', 'single', 'element', 'remember', 'greatest', 'Westerns', 'parody', 'simple', 'remake', 'doubt', 'Kurosawa', 'even', 'Ford', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'level', 'greatness', 'more', 'talent', 'have', 'allowed', 'time', 'delineate', 'here', ""'ll"", 'just', 'repeat', 'one', 'HELL', 'great', 'film', 'actually', 'feel', 'got', 'enjoy', 'something']",True Grit

Especially  Hailee Steinfeld's take on Mattie Ross. While not 100% faithful to the book (the book Mattie was pluckier, while this Mattie displays a steely resolve more often than pluck), Hailee's Mattie was clearly the star of this show, driving things forward with a steely resolve yet still being believably (and sometimes dismayingly, when bad things happened to her) fourteen. Hailee's face has an expressiveness that brings the character to life as she reacts to the circumstances she encounters, whether it was dismay, determination, whatever, her face showed what Mattie was feeling, and it was *right* for what was happening. To tell you the truth, I found her performance to be more believable than the book, the book Mattie was way too perky for a kid in those kind of circumstances.For those complaining about the ending, the book pretty much does a cut-away to that scene at the end too. Perhaps the Coens could have changed that, but I think they were thinking more along the lines of, ""well, the book is a classic, and we've never written a western before, so let's stick with what we know worked for the book."" And finally, for those complaining about a fourteen year old doing the things in this movie, realize that in Arkansas, it was usual for girls to be married by age 15 until recent times, and a girl her age would have been doing childcare, housework, gardening, or the book-keeping it appears in this case for several years by age fourteen. Childhood as we currently envision it, as a time of innocence, simply didn't exist in the 1800's. Children were expected to participate in the full economic and social life of the family from an early age, they were not protected or cosseted as today. Families were big back then because the labor provided by the children had economic value, not because they loved children.I'd actually rate this movie about 4.5, because while it is very good, it is no Fargo. But then, not many movies are. What it is, is a very good movie that does a far better job than the John Wayne movie of bringing the book -- and the era -- to life. Not that it makes the John Wayne movie a bad movie. But it's a John Wayne movie, and this is a Mattie Ross movie.

I figured if the movie failed to draw me in (I assumed it would) that I could just do what I normally do when I find myself unwittingly ticketed to a movie I don't really want to see--I would just sleep through it.But as it turns out, I found myself watching 5 minutes . . . then 10 . . . and I was hooked by the time we got to the part where the guy with the eye-patch starting shooting off his witty dialogue in the courtroom.Fantasy being one of my favorite genre's I likened Eye-Patch (can't for the life of me remember the character's name) to a witty Gandalf with a rifle. The main character also reminded me a little of Clint Eastwood's performance in Gran Turino.The plot is pretty straightforward and there are fewer characters to keep track of than you have fingers . . . on one hand. I consider that a plus. The short but sweet action scenes also help keep the momentum going. In the end, though, I find it was the witty dialogue and antics of some of the characters that really kept me going . . . almost all the way to the end.The end is where I feel the movie kinda fizzles out and loses steam.

Sure, probably more realistic that way, but still. . . .I have not read the book, nor seen the original movie, so I'll leave such comparisons like those up to the genre experts, but if you want the opinion of someone who mostly lives and breathes SF and Fantasy, then I can safely recommend this movie to those of you that may still be skeptical.",4,NOT MY GENRE . . .

1365795,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B003UESJME,Erik North,"[6, 9]","The brothers Joel and Ethan Coen must have taken a lot of heat for daring to remake (or rework, depending on how you look at it) the classic 1969 Henry Hathaway-directed western TRUE GRIT, which gave John Wayne the sole Oscar of his career. But the end result, with Jeff Bridges, no stranger to westerns he (RANCHO DELUXE; BAD COMPANY; WILD BILL), in the role that the Duke cemented forever in people's minds, is no slouch of a film either.Once again, a teenager named Mattie Ross (here played by Hailee Steinfield, in the role Kim Darby had) hires the crusty, whiskey-drinking Cogburn (Bridges) to hunt down Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin, taking over for Jeff Corey), the man who killed her father, as well as Brolin's gang, headed up by ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, in the role Robert Duvall parlayed in '69). Matt Damon, meanwhile, tags along as LaBeouf, the greenhorn Texas Ranger (played by Glen Campbell back then) who proves he, like the feisty Mattie, shows some ""true grit"" of his own to stand up to Bridges' hard-charging marshal. The film, though somewhat longer than an audience weaned on headache-inducing 3D and MTV-inspired montage editing might like, moves at a fairly fast pace, thanks to Bridges' salty performance as Cogburn, and the Coen Brothers' eye for period dialog, set design, and music (provided by the Coens' regular composer Carter Burwell). And Steinfield gives a great and marvelously unruffled performance as Mattie--a role that probably ought to earn her at least an Oscar nomination.It's never easy for Hollywood to do remakes of anything, especially not Westerns, particularly those where John Wayne was involved; but the Coens' effort at reworking TRUE GRIT doesn't disappoint. If Bridges' performance as Rooster Cogburn doesn't necessarily outshine the Duke's, it is not out of lack of trying; he just gives a different, but equally valid, portrayal. Many of the original film's most famous lines are repeated almost verbatim (including the always-memorable ""Fill your hand, you son-of-a-b**ch!""). In the end, it may very well get people to ask why Hollywood went stone-cold on the Western, even after it proved its worth in recent times with films like UNFORGIVEN, TOMBSTONE, and OPEN RANGE. When made with the kind of care and authenticity shown here, along with solid performances from all concerned, the Western can still show the kind of ""true grit"" that the Coens' film, like the Henry Hathaway/John Wayne epic before it, showed.",4,"""The Dude"" Fills ""The Duke""'s Shoes",1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2471,"['brothers', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'lot', 'heat', 'daring', 'remake', 'rework', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'classic', '1969', 'Henry', 'Hathaway-directed', 'western', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'gave', 'John', 'Wayne', 'sole', 'Oscar', 'career', 'end', 'result', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'no', 'stranger', 'westerns', 'RANCHO', 'DELUXE', 'BAD', 'COMPANY', 'WILD', 'BILL', 'role', 'Duke', 'cemented', 'forever', 'people', 'minds', 'slouch', 'film', 'either.Once', 'again', 'teenager', 'named', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'here', 'played', 'Hailee', 'Steinfield', 'role', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'had', 'crusty', 'whiskey-drinking', 'Cogburn', 'Bridges', 'hunt', 'down', 'Tom', 'Cheney', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'taking', 'over', 'Jeff', 'Corey', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'father', 'as', 'well', 'Brolin', 'gang', 'headed', 'up', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'role', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'parlayed', ""'69"", 'Matt', 'Damon', 'meanwhile', 'tags', 'LaBeouf', 'greenhorn', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'played', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'back', 'then', 'who', 'feisty', 'Mattie', 'true', 'grit', 'own', 'stand', 'up', 'Bridges', 'hard-charging', 'marshal', 'film', 'somewhat', 'longer', 'audience', 'weaned', 'headache-inducing', '3D', 'MTV-inspired', 'montage', 'editing', 'might', 'like', 'moves', 'fairly', 'fast', 'pace', 'thanks', 'Bridges', 'salty', 'performance', 'Cogburn', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'eye', 'period', 'dialog', 'set', 'design', 'music', 'provided', 'Coens', 'regular', 'composer', 'Carter', 'Burwell', 'Steinfield', 'great', 'marvelously', 'unruffled', 'performance', 'Mattie', 'role', 'probably', 'ought', 'earn', 'least', 'Oscar', 'nomination.It', 'never', 'easy', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'remakes', 'anything', 'especially', 'not', 'Westerns', 'particularly', 'where', 'John', 'Wayne', 'was', 'involved', 'Coens', 'effort', 'reworking', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Bridges', 'performance', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'outshine', 'Duke', 'not', 'lack', 'trying', 'just', 'different', 'equally', 'valid', 'portrayal', 'Many', 'original', 'film', 'most', 'famous', 'lines', 'are', 'repeated', 'almost', 'verbatim', 'including', 'always-memorable', 'Fill', 'hand', 'son-of-a-b**ch', 'end', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'get', 'people', 'ask', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'went', 'stone-cold', 'Western', 'even', 'proved', 'worth', 'recent', 'times', 'films', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'TOMBSTONE', 'OPEN', 'RANGE', 'When', 'made', 'kind', 'care', 'authenticity', 'shown', 'here', 'solid', 'performances', 'concerned', 'Western', 'can', 'still', 'show', 'kind', 'true', 'grit', 'Coens', 'film', 'Henry', 'Hathaway/John', 'Wayne', 'epic', 'showed']",True Grit

1365803,A2BPDFR58H9575,B003UESJME,Galina,"[5, 8]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***True Grit (2010) is a new film by Brothers Coen for which they wrote the screenplay based on the eponymous cult western novel by Charles Portis. The novel was first brought to screen back in 1969 with John Wayne as the eye-patched, heavy drinking, trigger happy US Marshall Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn in Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1877, the possessor of ""true grit"" who was hired by a 14 year old girl Mattie Ross to find the killer of her father and to bring him to justice. During the last two weeks, I saw both films back to back and found them gripping, entertaining and very well made.I did not read the Charles Portis' novel and I can't say I am a big westerns fan even though I've seen and enjoyed some of them but I am a longtime loyal fan of all things Coen and I did not miss a single one of their movies. I sincerely believe that the Coens do not make bad movies for the simple reason they don't know how. True Grit is their first Western, and the first film since 2003 rated PG 13. For many fans that always wait impatiently for their next film, the brothers' choice of the material was a surprise. Coens had only remade one film before True Grits (The Ladykillers), and they never made a pure western before but after watching True Grit, it is perfectly clear that their latest film is a ""true Coens"", the western as only Ethan and Joel could have made it. According to Ethan Coen, before the shooting started, the Coens wanted to make a more faithful adaptation of the novel and to tell the story the way it was told in the book: from the point of view of Mattie Ross, the 14 years old girl who set her mind on hiring the right man for the job of finding and bringing to justice the murderer of her father. The newcomer Halee Steinfeld brings such incredible independence, sharpness, courage, intellect and toughness to the character of Mattie that she more than holds on her own in the scenes she shares with the true stars/talented actors, such as Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper among others. As wonderful as these actors are, this is Halley/Mattie's film, and she owns it from her first appearance.The Coens mentioned that the novel is tough, violent, and funny, and that's how they wanted to adapt it to the screen. I believe that they achieved their goal because their adaptation of the novel is a ""true Coens"" -very dark, violent (I personally could not watch the scene in the snake-pit and had to turn away) yet funny - thanks to another memorable performance from Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn and Coens 'unique dark humor which is in the dialogs and the characters' personalities. The screen chemistry among Bridges, Steinfeld, and Matt Damon as Texas Ranger, who is also in search of Tom Chaney for another murder, is very strong and watching three of them together is the viewers' delight. My only problem with the Bridges' performance is the way he speaks his lines. It was hard to understand what he was saying and some of the Coens'-Portis' writings were lost on me. In this regard, following John Wayne's Rooster was much easier.As always, Coens' cooperation with the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins, produced the film of indescribable beauty and authentic atmosphere of the time long passed. The scene close to the end of the film where Rooster rushes on the horseback to get bitten by the deadly rattlesnake Mattie to the doctor as the day light changes to darkness and the huge surreal stars lit the sky is breathtaking and its beauty brought the tears to my eyes. It is without doubt the most memorable shot in the Coens-Deakins movies for me. I realize that the awards may not be important in order to recognize and to admire Deakins' vision but it was upsetting to find out that in spite of having been behind the camera for dozens of the greatest films from over 20 years, he has never been awarded the Oscar for his work. This is a criminal oversight from the Academy of Motion Pictures and I hope that he will be rewarded for his camera-work in ""True Grit"".Some viewers and critics find he end of the film rushed and somehow abrupt. Wrong. It is a perfect ending to a perfect film; besides, it follows the novel's ending faithfully. It is different from more optimistic final of the older version but both finals fit their films very well.Renowned film critic Roger Ebert wrote about Ethan and Joel Coen's ""Fargo"": ""Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies,"" I would say, it is true about every one of the Ethan and Joel Coens' films including the adaptation of True Grit.",5,True Coens,1293926400,"01 2,

1365805,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B003UESJME,Gary P. Cohen,"[0, 0]","When I first heard they were remaking True Grit, I was shocked.  Why remake the wonderful film for which the Duke won his only Oscar?  I did not have any great desire to see it in the movies and finally caught up with it tonight on blu-ray.  My opinion remains the same, it is an excellent film but what was the rationale for remaking it?  Jeff Bridges seems to be making a new career out of playing rather scruffy, hard-drinking characters.  He is excellent as Rooster, however the Duke's performance was legendary.  Hailee Steinfeld is also wonderful as Mattie Ross, but Kim Darby was terrific as well.  Glen Campbell is usually criticised as LaBoeuf, however he was okay in his second film.  I must admit to not liking Matt Damon very much, however he is okay in the role.  Josh Brolin has little more than a cameo as the evil Tom Chaney.  This film has some fine supporting actors, however the original had Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Jeremy Slate, Jeff Corey, etc.: all very fine actors.  Like the original this film has beautiful scenery, wonderful cinematography and is an all-around enjoyable experience. The ending was fairly downbeat, closer to the novel I understand, than the Wayne version that made one walk out of the theater with a smile.  I guess the only rationale for remaking it is that the Coen brothers wanted to do it and Jeff Bridges was hot as hell after winning his Oscar.

1365806,AW484C888BDQE,B003UESJME,Gerald Schoenburg,"[5, 17]","What can I add to all these reviews?  First the movie was shot beautifully and it looks first rate.  I am told this version sticks a bit closer to the original book.  Comparing the two movies, I don't believe there is a single character I didn't like better in the first and original movies with John Wayne.  While Jeff Bridges is a terrific actor, this was a role John Wayne was a perfect fit.  Even Glenn Campbell, with his goofy delivery was better in this role than Matt Damon.  Please understand, I believe Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges are superior actors in every way, but not in these roles.James Brolin was far too good looking to play the role of Tom Chaney.  The last is a comparison with Kim Darby and Hailee Steinfeld.  Darby was 21 years old when she played Matty at 14.  Steinfeld was 14 playing 14.  Darby was more believable as a teenager.The bottom line is, why redo a perfect movie if you can't improve it.  I didn't hate it, but it just didn't do it for me.

The Coen Brothers give us that sense of landscape which is the emotional core of the Western as a genre.Bridges, Brolin, and Damon ham up their roles relentlessly, but that too was part of the classic western genre, which included such hamsters as Roy Rogers, the Cisco Kid, and Gene Autry. Only later did the western go through a 'noir' bloodbath-and-nastiness phase. The Coen brothers have synthesized the Saturday matinee westerns of the 40s and 50s with the faux-realism of the later westerns.And the girl Mattie Ross, played by Hailie Steinfeld, was miraculous!

TRUE GRIIT is a strong example of this.  Despite reading the book and seeing the original film version the viewer will likely not be prepared for this version of the Charles Portis novel.  Much of that is in the screenplay as written by Joel and Ethan Coen; the dialogue is definitely not contemporary but is as things might have been uttered during the timeframe of the piece. This adds considerable authenticity and rawness, AND humor to the story.Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld - the weak point in casting) is compelled to bring her father's murderer Tom Clancy (Josh Brolin) to justice. A girl of fixed purpose (and strange knowledge of Latin and law....) she hires US Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an alcoholic reprobate of a old cuss who has the one attribute Mattie needs - true grit.  The two set out on Clancy's trail, at times assisted by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon, who shines here), chasing Clancy and the gang led by Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, hardly recognizable), and after much killing and mangy incidents justice of sorts is served.  The ending of the film gets a bit sappy but leaves the audience a chance to clear heads before the film credits begin.Aside from the terrific dialogue, other attributes of this version of the story include first class acting by all concerned including some exceptional cameos by Ed Corbin as the Bear Man, Domhnall Gleeson as the kid Moon, Jarlath Conroy as the Undertaker and Paul Rae as Emmett Quincy, extraordinary cinematography by Roger Deakins who manages to give the Coen Brothers some spectacular scenery and atmosphere - the Old West the way we've seldom seen it, and a musical score that relies heavily on old Baptist church songs.

1365810,ATYVBUA5E1IDW,B003UESJME,Graham,"[1, 5]","My childhood was filled with John Wayne westerns. To this day, True Grit stands as Wayne's finest hour; so it was with both curiosity and apprehension that I first heard a remake was in the works. My apprehension soon gave way to excitement when I heard about the principals: The Coen Brothers, Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin. I was still unsure that anyone could match the presence and impact of the legendary Duke, but who better to try than the Dude? The western genre has enjoyed a brief, but critically viable, resurgence in recent years and True Grit is a welcome, if unspectacular, addition to the genre. There are very few missteps, but I can't help but feel that we just missed witnessing something that could have been truly spectacular.For those unfamiliar with the origins of the story, True Grit is a remake/reimagining of the 1969 Henry Hathaway film of the same name, which is in turn based on the 1968 book written by Charles Portis. Hathaway's film was notable for earning John Wayne only Oscar and Wayne's performance, though a bit on the hammy side, still stands as one of the high points of a legendary career. The Coen Brothers approached the material with the intent of delivering a more faithful adaptation of the book, and on that count they succeeded quite admirably. Told from the point of view of the young Mattie Ross (fantastic newcomer Hailee Steinfeld), True Grit tells the story of a young girl, dead set on finding and killing her father's murderer. She enlists the help of a drunken US Marshall named Rooster Cogburn (Bridges, clearly having a ball) and a boisterous Texas Ranger played by a riotous Matt Damon. Together, the three set out into Indian territory; what follows is a beautifully shot and often funny, if slight, journey.The Coen Brothers are known for their quirkiness and it is somewhat disappointing that True Grit possesses so little of this trademark oddness. Indeed, the film is likely the Coen's first straightforward genre exercise; to their credit, they set out to make a western and they made a good one. This is primarily due to the quality of their assured direction, the beautiful cinematography by longtime collaborator Roger Deakins, and the excellent performances by a star-filled cast.Bridges plays Cogburn as a drunken mess of a man, though a man still scarily competent when it comes time for bloodshed. As he staggers about, slurring his words and rattling off stories of past adventures, it's clear that outside of Wayne, Bridges is the only actor that could possibly inhabit the role. It is an Oscar-worthy performance, although one likely to result in only a nomination, given last years' win for Crazy Heart. Damon is hilarious as the cocky Texas Ranger, La Boeuf (pronounced La Beef, and repeated numerous times to hilarious effect by Cogburn), and Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper also turn in high quality performances in limited screen time as the villains. Those four actors comprise a murderers' row of talent, but the real star of True Grit is the young Steinfeld, who goes to toe to toe with Bridges and Damon and emerges unscathed. It is a remarkable debut, and while the role is admittedly one-note, it's certainly a promising start to what looks to be a long career. The 14-year old has garnered significant Oscar buzz, and deservedly so.The direction and acting are excellent, but where the film falters is in both pacing and tone. While it is quite funny, I couldn't help but feel that it was almost too funny, as the darkly serious subject matter didn't seem to be treated with the proper weight. And although this is no fault of the Coen Brothers, the film seemed rather slight, as there simply wasn't a lot going on. There are only three major events in the film, and the villains only appear for five minutes or so. My biggest gripe, however, was the lack of John Wayne. Again, it's hard to criticize a film for something beyond its control, but when you enter the remake game, you must accept that you will be judged against those that came before you. While Bridges version of Cogburn is certainly more believable and far funnier than the character as played by Wayne, I couldn't help but wish Wayne would take over during the scenes involving gunplay. The climactic gun battle lacks the power and ferocity of the original's finale, and it was with some disappointment that I realized that even the Coen Brothers, armed with Jeff Bridges and a host of great actors, cannot always pull an ace from their sleeves. True Grit is a good film, and compared to most recent entries in the genre, a great western, but it fails to leave much of a mark. 4 out of 5 stars.",4,"A solid western, but not the classic people are making it out to be",1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,4657,"['childhood', 'was', 'filled', 'John', 'Wayne', 'day', 'True', 'Grit', 'Wayne', 'finest', 'hour', 'was', 'curiosity', 'apprehension', 'first', 'heard', 'remake', 'was', 'works', 'apprehension', 'soon', 'gave', 'way', 'excitement', 'when', 'heard', 'principals', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'was', 'still', 'unsure', 'anyone', 'could', 'match', 'presence', 'impact', 'legendary', 'Duke', 'who', 'better', 'try', 'Dude', 'western', 'genre', 'enjoyed', 'brief', 'critically', 'viable', 'resurgence', 'recent', 'years', 'True', 'Grit', 'welcome', 'unspectacular', 'addition', 'genre', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'missteps', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'just', 'missed', 'witnessing', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'spectacular.For', 'unfamiliar', 'origins', 'story', 'True', 'Grit', 'remake/reimagining', '1969', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'turn', 'based', '1968', 'book', 'written', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'Hathaway', 'film', 'was', 'notable', 'earning', 'John', 'Wayne', 'only', 'Oscar', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'bit', 'hammy', 'side', 'still', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'legendary', 'career', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'approached', 'material', 'intent', 'delivering', 'more', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'count', 'succeeded', 'quite', 'admirably', 'Told', 'point', 'view', 'young', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'fantastic', 'newcomer', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'True', 'Grit', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'dead', 'set', 'finding', 'killing', 'father', 'murderer', 'help', 'drunken', 'US', 'Marshall', 'named', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Bridges', 'clearly', 'having', 'ball', 'boisterous', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'played', 'riotous', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Together', 'three', 'set', 'out', 'Indian', 'territory', 'what', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'often', 'funny', 'slight', 'journey.The', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'are', 'known', 'quirkiness', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'True', 'Grit', 'so', 'little', 'trademark', 'oddness', 'Indeed', 'film', 'likely', 'Coen', 'first', 'straightforward', 'genre', 'exercise', 'credit', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'western', 'made', 'good', 'one', 'primarily', 'due', 'quality', 'assured', 'direction', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'longtime', 'collaborator', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'excellent', 'performances', 'star-filled', 'cast.Bridges', 'Cogburn', 'drunken', 'mess', 'man', 'man', 'still', 'scarily', 'competent', 'when', 'time', 'bloodshed', 'slurring', 'words', 'rattling', 'off', 'stories', 'past', 'adventures', 'clear', 'outside', 'Wayne', 'Bridges', 'only', 'actor', 'could', 'possibly', 'inhabit', 'role', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'one', 'likely', 'result', 'only', 'nomination', 'given', 'last', 'years', 'win', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'Damon', 'hilarious', 'cocky', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'La', 'Boeuf', 'pronounced', 'La', 'Beef', 'repeated', 'numerous', 'times', 'hilarious', 'effect', 'Cogburn', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'also', 'turn', 'high', 'quality', 'performances', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'villains', 'four', 'actors', 'comprise', 'murderers', 'row', 'talent', 'real', 'star', 'True', 'Grit', 'young', 'Steinfeld', 'who', 'toe', 'toe', 'Bridges', 'Damon', 'unscathed', 'remarkable', 'debut', 'role', 'admittedly', 'one-note', 'certainly', 'promising', 'start', 'what', 'be', 'long', 'career', '14-year', 'old', 'garnered', 'significant', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'deservedly', 'so.The', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'excellent', 'where', 'film', 'falters', 'pacing', 'tone', 'quite', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'funny', 'darkly', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'treated', 'proper', 'weight', 'fault', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', 'seemed', 'rather', 'slight', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'going', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'major', 'events', 'film', 'villains', 'only', 'appear', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'however', 'was', 'lack', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Again', 'hard', 'criticize', 'film', 'something', 'control', 'when', 'enter', 'remake', 'game', 'must', 'accept', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'came', 'Bridges', 'version', 'Cogburn', 'certainly', 'more', 'believable', 'far', 'funnier', 'character', 'played', 'Wayne', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', 'Wayne', 'would', 'take', 'over', 'scenes', 'involving', 'gunplay', 'climactic', 'gun', 'battle', 'power', 'ferocity', 'original', 'finale', 'was', 'disappointment', 'realized', 'even', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'armed', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'host', 'great', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'always', 'pull', 'ace', 'sleeves', 'True', 'Grit', 'good', 'film', 'compared', 'most', 'recent', 'entries', 'genre', 'great', 'western', 'leave', 'much', 'mark', '4', '5', 'stars']",True Grit

That said, I must admit I was not thrilled when I heard there would be a remake of True Grit. Being a huge fan of the original I felt compelled to see it and I was expecting to be disappointed...I was not! I am very critical of remakes but this one does it well. The lines are mostly there, but delivered in the style of the actors in the remake without attempting to mirror the original performance. Bridges does Cogburn as Bridges, not trying to copy Wayne...admirable. I've seen the original so many times I know many of the lines by heart and I found this interpretation enjoyable and a homage to the original classic. The part where Mattie has the exchange with the horse trader (played by Strother Martin in the original) is definitely less humorous in this version. The scene where Cogburn and Mattie come upon the body hanging from the tree in this version was not in the original and I didn't really see a reason for it as it had no pertinence to the story, but it was pretty much the exception to the plot otherwise. I also must say that the ending of this version was very bleak compared to the wonderful conclusion of the original with Wayne jumping the fence on his horse which I much preferred (""well, come see a fat old man sometime!"")...and I do wish Bridges had put more animation in the scene where Cogburn asks Mattie what she has in the poke (""that's a Colt's Dragoon...""!).

Both worked to show dramatic effect without the humor that is present in the first film. For example, the fun was absent when Mattie bargained for the prices she wanted for her father's horses and when she haggled for other items. The first film spent more time on these events. As a result, we did not come to like Rooster and Mattie as we did in the John Wayne version. The ending of the first film was much more emotional. This new film added nothing to the drama by showing Mattie as a one-armed adult meeting famous western outlaws. The beginning of the Wayne movie was also better.

The first film with John Wayne was a mediocre average western only saved by the presence of a 14 year old girl chasing and hunting the killer of her father. The Coen brothers performed a miracle and give this film a strength and power it did not have in 1969. After spaghetti westerns now is the time of kaddish westerns.They more or less try to be a lot more effective as for the feelings and emotions of the audience. They use the girl at her maximum in all situations. The story though is simplistic but it provides us with some beautiful pictures and landscapes and it increases the dramatic tension a lot.But that does not make a great film and not even a beautiful film, except the touristic discovery of the Santa Fe region and its wilderness. The ending is different and it adds some posthumous depth to the story but fundamentally we are very far away and even more than far away from the tension of Sergio Leones' and Ennio Morricones' films.Yet it is pleasant and I must say the hanging scene is a lot more impressive in this version probably due to the nice sound track that makes the breaking of the vertebrae a lot more audible.

1365831,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B003UESJME,Jason Bean,"[0, 0]","True Grit by Charles Portis is easily one of my favorite novels. In 1969 it was adapted into a film starring John Wayne (in which he won an Academy Award), and while it took several liberties from the book I found it a decently entertaining film. This new adaptation by the Coen brothers is much more faithful to the novel and is an enjoyable movie as well but like it's predecessor seems to be missing something.The story of True Grit follows 14 year old Mattie Ross who's looking to avenge the murder and robbery of her father by Tom Chaney. She hires U.S. Marshal Cogburn and along with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf they set out after the killer. The story is very sharply filmed with a believable ""Western"" setting and is filled with the quirkiness and dark-humor we've come to expect from a Coen Brother's movie. The action scenes and gunfights are very tense and exciting giving a sense of realism and credibility to the story.Unfortunately as well-filmmed as this movie is there seems to be something a bit off with the screenplay, namely the characterizations. Don't get me wrong, all of the separate characters are three-dimensional but they still feel..well, SEPARATE. While True Grit's story stays (wisely) centered on Mattie her, Cogburn, and Laboeuf's motivations seem to keep changing on the fly with little to no (believable) explanation. It was hard to feel a connection in any of them which takes away a lot of the dramatic impact (especially from the ending). Even their humor seemed misguided at times like the Coen brothers weren't sure what kind of film they wanted to make.Thankfully while the characterizations are a bit sketchy, the performances in True Grit are outstanding! Hailee Steinfeld is exceptionally good as Mattie and she brings humanity and humor to her character (the scene's with her and Stonehill are hysterical!) and has you rooting for her. Jeff Bridges is fun to watch as the burned-out Cogburn as is Matt Damon as the self-assured LeBoeuf. Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper are excellent and memorable as Tom Chaney and Ned Pepper, which is impressive considering how little screen time they are given.While I still have my complaints about True Grit I'm sure most people (particularly Coen brothers fans) won't be bothered by it's short-comings. It's still a very entertaining movie with excellent performances and great directing and camera work.

Their ""True Grit,"" while a fine movie, fell far short of our family's expectations. The remake did improve two characters from the first that were thoroughly irritating: Glen Campbell's nancy-fied LeBoeuf and Kim Darby's cringe-inducing Mattie. At least the Coens made these two characters tougher, if not completely believable. OTOH, Jeff Bridge's was completely believable as the broken down, hard-drinking old lawman, Reuben Cogburn. His lines were mumbled and wise, and he was believable as a man who knew his way around the frontier. The Coens did manage to dirty up frontier characters, giving them bad teeth, dirty faces, stringy hair and other accouterments of life in ramshackle cabins. But impressive makeup does not a good movie make.The film's plot was full of interesting but disconnected asides -- including a bear-clad man with a hanged corpse on his saddle and a couple of passive, deformed Indian kids whom Cogburn kicked around for no apparent reason. Lack of context was the film's greatest handicap. What made Hattie so sanctimonious? Why was LeBoeuf, self-described as a hardened Texas Ranger, so innocent? Where did the description ""true grit"" come from? If you're not a Civil War fanatic, who is Captain Quantrill, under whom Cogburn served? A little less fidelity to the book and  a little more to the contemporary audience would have been appreciated.The lack of conversation in my family after watching the movie pretty much said it all.

I keep reading reviews where it says that ""True Grit"" is a ""departure"" from their previous work. Even Roger Ebert thinks so. I just saw the film and i can tell you that all of their usual trademarks are there. You would have shown me this film without telling me that it was from the Coen brothers and i'm pretty sure that i would have guessed it. Their dark humour is there. You see their usual off-beat characters, some with funny faces, all of them speaking with a certain eloquence (even the villains), you also have your strange character that suddenly appears and then goes away without never really realizing the point of it, they show us their usual and beautiful scenery modelled on precise storyboards, you witness some scene-stealing perfomances from wordy-characters, you can't escape their incredible quick outbursts of violence here and there, you have your usual Carter Burwell soundtrack, you again have a conclusion that is not ""Hollywood-like"" and always, you are amazed by their renewed talent.Is it because it's a western? Even that, you could see it coming in their filmography. Some of their previous films are modern westerns to me (""No Country For Old Men"" mostly). No really, ""True Grit"" is a true Coen movie. Everything you love about the brothers is there. Everything you hate also, if that ain't your thing. It's ""The Coen Brothers meet the Far West"". That's what it is.

It is a movie that lives on after you have seen it, and its characters are detailed, with dialogue that is novelish from that time period. This movie should perhaps have been given an R-rating because of its violence, but let it not make us overlook Hailee Steinfeld in what will be remembered as her stand-out role playing the vigilante, and brave Mattie Ross. She reminds me of a character out of a lengthy, and well written novel. She employs wordy dialogue, that in a lesser movie, would not work for being pretentious. But Hailee plays with fire and walks away without being burnt, because she is more eloquent in her discriptions than irksome, more determined than desperate, and witty and intelligent than showboating. Determined to abuse all that stand in her way with humiliation she is like an unstoppable stampede towards retribution. As a profound writer is enabled with freedoms to lavish his reader with a well-spring of description, she does so here with disregard for the typical Hollywood types short on discription. Here, the short leash for being creatively discriptive has been closeted, and our ears have hardly ever heard such uncommon, fluid talk. It winds up my passion for reading novels, and gives me hope in movies.I am accustomed to Westerners about revenge, where the son avenges his fathers death, but here, in this memorable movie we have a kind of plot that is rarely seen: where the daughter seeks not only vengence, but her personal vendetta in seeking to slay the man that killed her father. Mattie Ross is a literal character that sometimes shares her soft, cheerful, fourteen year-old-side, but you never forget that she has lost her beloved father and will not settle for bargains or a compromise. She is a young girl that knows the meaning of sacrifice.Jeff Bridges is again reminding the audience that he is a skillfull actor that has many faces. Here, in what is one of his best roles to date, he plays a course, aged, and volatile federal marshal who can sometimes use his rifles and six shooters without hesitation. He is a slave to the drink, and uses violence oftener than not but he has a soft spot for hard luck cases. He is dangerous, and it will be hard to trust his judgements. The one-eyed Rooster Cogburn is as apt to drink himself to death as he is in capturing the most dangerous cowboys wanted by the law.True Grit is directed by the Coen brothers, who have been called the two-headed director. I think this is the reason why I always get a misunderstanding after watching many of their films. No Country for Old Men is a turbulent movie, that I found many things to appreciate, but was offended by the pointless violence. There seemed to be a dual-syle to the movie. And here, in True Grit, I get that same sense, but it is a more complete movie for me, and more enjoyable. Not a movie of a bunch of great scenes like No Country for Old Men, but a movie that is complete, that is a sum of its parts. A movie with Gestalt principles that I appreciate. The ending did seem rushed, and incomplete, as many Coen movies do for me, but it is a style that I have come to recognize as a Coen trait, and instead of punishing their style in every movie, I have come to appreciate their ways ever more slowly as time goes by. The Coen brothers are certainly two directors with entirely different ideas, but they seem to come to an understanding before the end because of a shared basic principle.This movie is spearheaded by four talented actors. For Hailee Steinfeld this her break-out role. Jeff Bridges reminds us that he is an excellent, and diverse actor. Matt Damon plays a character that seems ill informed but good natured in the end. Laboeuf, a Texan, flirts in and out of sight, but never leaves your presence. He is a character that is written to behave insignificant, but is really a major player here. Josh Brolin has a face that is instantly recognizable. And after it all, it is amazing to me that he leaves such an impression after so little screen time.I of course highly recommend True Grit. It is a well made Western that is a credit to its genre. This past year is believed to be a year of less quality, though many viewers may disagree, but if that is so in the former, then True Grit is the exception to a bad year. It delivers a memorable story, with such storied dialogue that reminded me of the way historical documents of the time were written. A surprisingly interesting and creatively written dialogue forces my hand to write that this may well be the most enjoyment I have had watching a movie all year. Well done.",5,Sometimes very violent.

Hailee Steinfeld steals the spotlight and is the reason why anybody enjoys this version.  Matt Damon portrays a character (Texas Ranger) that doesn't let him shine as an actor, and as he holds back to let the other main characters have a better shot at the Oscar, it subsequently takes a lot away from how much the viewer enjoys this remake.  One of the trivia details about this film was John Wayne was 62 when he portrayed Rooster Cogburn, whereas Jeff Bridges was 60.  The character is supposed to be 40 yrs of age at the time this story's theme intended.  The redundant song heard over and over is the old hymn ""Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.""  ""Keep On The Firing Line"" is another hymn that is part of the soundtrack.  You have to let go of adoration for John Wayne, but even then this film lacks what it SHOULD have been because it seemed Jeff Bridges had a dozen marbles in his mouth 90% of the time he said anything.  Other than that, it is a decent western, and except for a few slow moving parts that at times was a bit tedious, the costuming, sets, and scenery are actually above average.  Some of the FX includes some brutal scenes of violence which is why the movie got the rating it has.  You'll need to try not to compare this 2010 film with the 1969 version.

1365859,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B003UESJME,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[9, 13]","When a Shakespeare play that has been made into a film previously is made again, it is not called a remake. The Coen Brother's latest film True Grit is based on a novel by Charles Portis that was made into an iconic film with an iconic lead performance in 1969, but the Coen's version is not a remake of the 1969 film but a new adaptation of the novel. I feel this way because it never feels like the 1969 version served as a reference point for the Coen's vision of the story. As I have never read Portis' novel, if I credit the Coens rather than Portis for a certain idea I apologize, but that just shows how adept the brothers are at making something their own. I will make certain comparisons to the 1969 original but I've looked at this 2010 version largely on its own merit.14-year-old Mattie Ross' (Hailee Steinfeld) father is killed by a hired hand named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who rides off with her father's horse and two of his California gold pieces. Chaney flees to Indian Territory and while collecting her father's things, Mattie inquires about hiring a U.S. Marshall to track him down. She is told the meanest Marshall in town is Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), described as a ""merciless"" man with ""true grit."" Mattie hires the rugged, whiskey-drinking Rooster on the condition she goes with him. Chaney is also being hunted by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who intends to catch Chaney for the murder of a Texas senator and collect on the reward money. Soon, the unlikely trio set out into Indian Territory to track down the man who killed Mattie's father.Few directors can balance such different genre elements and successful pull it off as well as the Coen Brothers. It's a western, but it works as a comedy, drama, and suspense film with the Coen's dark sense of humor present throughout. Any Coen Brothers fan can spot certain ""Coen moments,"" that are so delightfully odd and/or surreal they could only come from the inventive imaginations of those two. Coen fans will chuckle at the Bear Man character (""I have my bear skin"") and the early hanging scene, as well as several humorous lines that are trademark Coen Brothers humor (such as ""I do not know this man"" and ""You're not LaBoeuf""). The film is quite funny, with several laugh-out-loud moments, the dialogue is delivered with more biting wit, and the Coen's have constructed a much tighter, more cohesive script. LaBoeuf does not hang around needlessly through the entire film, which shifts the focus to the dynamic between Rooster and Mattie while allowing scenes to unfold in a fresher, more exciting way. The ""cabin scene,"" set at night here, may lack Dennis Hopper but is funnier, more suspenseful, and executed better than the '69 film elevating it from a good scene to a riveting sequence.Another big change is the less picturesque scenery, more barren and rough but still beautiful when shot by the legendary Roger Deakins. His sweeping cinematography has my vote for the Best Cinematography Academy Award with mesmerizing exterior shots and many others that I can see becoming iconic over time. Deakins' infinite talent and ability complements the Coen Brother's creative vision perfectly.Always masters of casting, the Coens have hired some great character actors, making even the smallest roles memorable. The undertaker (Jarlath Conroy) and Col. Stonehill (Dakin Matthews) are particularly more memorable than they would be in another director's film. The scene between Mattie and Col. Stonehill is an absolute delight to watch. Meanwhile, Brolin makes the most of his little screen-time as the slimy, half-wit Tom Chaney and Barry Pepper (as ""Lucky Ned"" Pepper) disappears into the small role originated by the great Robert Duvall. He's completely unrecognizable, but does bear a resemblance to Duvall in physical appearance and with his voice. Matt Damon's interpretation of LaBoeuf perfectly balances pride and sarcastic wit, but never takes itself too seriously. Some actors would skate dangerously close to parody playing this character the way Damon does but he creates a likeable and well-developed character. Damon has only gotten better with age and his range as an actor rarely brings him the praise he deserves.Hailee Steinfeld is a marvel as the assertive, fast-talking Mattie bringing great presence and personality to her debut film role. Mattie is an unusually strong female protagonist and it's no easy task for an actress, young or old, to capture that strength and project it so convincingly. Steinfeld is convincing, but she also brings great humor and dignity to the role. This performance is not simply impressive because Steinfeld is 14 years old. If she was in her twenties, this would be an impressive performance as evidenced by Kim Darby's passable portrayal of Mattie Ross in the original at the age of 21. Steinfeld's Mattie is someone you wouldn't want to mess with and she outshines Darby by a mile here. She's a well deserved nominee for Best Supporting Actress with a solid chance of actually winning.Taking on a role that was originated by an American icon and won that icon an Academy Award seems like it would be a daunting task, but Jeff Bridges is a great actor who seems to have been hitting a creative stride in the last few years. John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn is iconic, but Jeff Bridges completely reinvents the character and gives a performance that may very well become iconic itself. Jeff Bridges' Rooster (who wears the eye-patch on his right eye, instead of his left) is more rugged and (no pun intended) grittier than Wayne's. Complaints have been raised about Bridges' raspy voice (it's been likened to Karl from Sling Blade), with some apparently finding it unintelligible. I find it a perfect fit for the disheveled, drunken Rooster and don't believe that Bridges' natural speaking voice would do justice to the character. I won't compare Wayne's Rooster Cogburn with Bridges' Rooster Cogburn as I feel they are two entirely separate entities, but I will say that Bridges hits an emotional note not present in Wayne's performance. Towards the end you care about Rooster and, while he never says it, you can see he cares for Mattie. It's a great performance.This film is a great example of how different something can become when handled with a different vision. Look at the courtroom scene early in the film for an example of this. Much of the dialogue is verbatim from the 1969 version, but the scene feels completely different. We get a much different immediate perception of Rooster Cogburn even though he's speaking the same dialogue. Everyone knows the scene from the 1969 version where John Wayne charges, guns blazing, at four men with his horse's reigns in his teeth. That scene doesn't seem quite as epic here, but that single scene is so iconic you can hardly expect it to be. The Coen's interpretation of the story has a much darker tone even when scenes unfold the same way and the dialogue sounds much different even when recited verbatim. The Coens give the film a more realistic, bittersweet epilogue that may perplex some viewers but it just validates that, even when working with familiar elements, the Coens can bring their own unique style to a film and make it their own.True Grit is the most accessible and commercial film Coen Brothers have made, but this does not detract from what a stunning achievement it is. It is one of the best films of its kind to come out of Hollywood in many years and breathes new life into the comatose western genre. It is one of the best films of 2010, but also one of the most purely enjoyable films of 2010. True Grit is a complete triumph.GRADE: A",5,Breathes New Life Into the Comatose Western Genre,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,7665,"['When', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'been', 'made', 'film', 'previously',

This movie is not for those who are looking for a Tombstone like, shootout at the OK Coral, action packed western.  Its also not for those who are die hard John Wayne fans as I noticed that alot of the negative reviews are from folks who have put the original True Grit on a pedestal and any type of remake will fall short of the glorification of the first version.  Having said that, I admit to not having seen the original film or read the book from which this movie is based on.

The first time I watched the film, I did have some trouble catching what Jeff Bridges would say but during the second viewing I paid particular attention to the dialogue and alot of what I missed the first time, I caught the second time and like I said before, its worth figuring out because it's very clever, especially the back and forth verbal jabs between Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon.All in all, this movie is probably not for everyone, but I think its great and I highly recommend it.",5,True Masterpiece,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,1525,"['watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'westerns', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'kinds', 'westerns', 'Unforgiven', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', '3:10', 'Yuma', 'Tombstone', 'even', 'liked', 'cheesy', 'Quick', 'Dead', 'movie', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'Tombstone', 'shootout', 'OK', 'Coral', 'action', 'packed', 'western', 'also', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fans', 'noticed', 'alot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'put', 'original', 'True', 'Grit', 'pedestal', 'type', 'remake', 'will', 'fall', 'short', 'glorification', 'first', 'version', 'Having', 'said', 'admit', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'watched', 'film', 'own', 'merit', 'absent', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'expectations', 'criticisms', 'watching', 'simply', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'actors', 'acting', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'dialogue', 'smart', 'sharp', 'times', 'witty', 'cinematography', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'trouble', 'catching', 'what', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'would', 'say', 'second', 'viewing', 'paid', 'particular', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'alot', 'what', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'caught', 'second', 'time', 'said', 'before', 'worth', 'figuring', 'out', 'very', 'clever', 'especially', 'back', 'forth', 'verbal', 'jabs', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Matt', 'Damon.All', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'everyone', 'think', 'great', 'highly', 'recommend']",True Grit
1365862,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B003UESJME,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[6, 9]","True Grit is a true hit!The Cohen Brothers mark this film with their personal and unique trademark making it so much more than a remake.  At first I wondered why anyone would want to re-make 'True Grit', a classic movie remembered well by fans old enough to have seen the original at its release and discovered later by younger fans who value a great film.  But this 'True Grit' turned out to be so much more than the original.  I was blown away by this film and am so glad I overcame my initial hesitancy about seeing it.Jeff Bridges gives another Oscar-worthy, astonishingly dead-on character-driven, picture-perfect performance as Rooster Cogburn.  It is hard to know exactly how Bridges could be so perfectly `Bad Blake' and also so perfectly `Rooster Cogburn' when those two characters were so very different.  Well, okay, maybe they had the hankering for booze in common, but otherwise, these two spot-on portrayals are just a beautiful testament to Jeff Bridges' transformation over the years from a perfectly solid performer to an absolutely amazing actor.Matt Damon shows another side to his acting abilities as well, in a pretty darn acceptable performance as Texas Ranger, La Boeuf, even if his performance was a bit subdued in this otherwise larger-than-life-character populated film.Rounding out the top cast members, if Jeff Bridges should be considered for an Oscar nomination this year, and be assured - he should, so too should young actress, Hailee Steinfeld, whom I admit to not having seen previously, but after her performance as 14-year-old Mattie, I don't think many movie attendees will be able to claim non-acquaintance with Ms. Steinfeld  much longer.Carter Burwell's music in `True Grit' just every bit as perfectly fit the characters, the events, and the surroundings and atmosphere in this film as it did in the sweeping hit `The Alamo', albeit, without the soulful fiddle solo Davey Crockett delivered in the huge tale of Texas.  Burwell's movie music is always perfection in every way.Female vocalist, Iris DeMent, who joined John Prine in a somewhat `blue', but oh-so-enjoyable, giggle-producing duet at the end of Billy Bob Thornton's great familial tale `Daddy and Them', sings a solo as the closing song of `True Grit'.  Iris delivers a beautiful, heart-felt rendition of `Leaning on The Everlasting Arms', which was also instrumentally featured throughout the film.  I have not heard such a moving vocal rendition of `Leaning.....' since it was so hauntingly performed a capella by Robert Mitchum in `The Night of the Hunter' back in 1955 when it made my childish blood run cold, and it still does every time I re-watch the DVD.`True Grit' contains some of the most beautiful scenes I have seen in a western film in a great long time, all due to the masterful talent of Roger Deakins.  These scenes are not just the usual sprawling expanses of mountains, trees, and rivers routinely seen in films that are shot in the west or in the southern part of the U.S. (most of `True Grit' was shot in Texas).  The familiar panoramas are certainly present in `True Grit' and they are pleasingly presented; but the viewer is also treated to several astoundingly beautiful artful creations including some absolutely gorgeous moonlit scenes and glorious, visually pleasing star-filled skies, as well as some stunning snowfall episodes.  I want to add, these are not exactly smooth, rich and lush visual offerings, they are created with just enough `roughness' to fit perfectly within the genre and atmosphere of the film and still take your breath away.One other thing I want to mention is the wonderful to-die-for dialogue.  I understand a great deal of this was lifted directly from the novel and was also in the original film, which I saw at the time of its first release.  However, I admit to not only not recalling the intricacy of the dialogue, but also not recollecting the unique dialect used in this version, nor being so entertained by the richness of the prose, or sufficiently in awe that the actors could actually remember so much priceless verbage and deliver it with such pitch-perfect ease.  The conversations, by each of the cast members, down to the smallest part, are alone worth the price of the film.I have not mentioned anything about the plot, not wanting to include any spoilers.  The novel and original film were sufficiently far enough in the past (1968 for the novel and 1969 for the film) I am certain there are many movie fans reading this review-of-sorts are not at all familiar with either version, having never read the novel nor viewed John Wayne, Glen Campbell, Kim Darby, or Robert Duvall, in the original movie offering.I want to recommend this latest version of `True Grit' as a true future classic, but also as a very enjoyable and entertaining film, one best viewed, at least initially, on a theater screen, preferably the widest one a fan can find today.  We have all been reading a lot lately about  at the questionable caliber of adult movies being made today.  This is one great film that will surely satisfy a fan's desire for a `real, authentic, fine, fine movie'; it certainly did mine.  I have enough family, friends, and acquaintances who have seen this film that they include a certain percentage who do not necessarily agree with my assessment, but their biggest failing seems to be in not recognizing that this is a Cohen Brother's film and not your parent's 'True Grit' and also it is so much more than your usual western.",5,TRUE GRIT IS A HIT!,1294358400,"01 7,

1365865,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B003UESJME,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[5, 9]","Everybody is familiar with John Wayne's 1969 ""True Grit"" and people may be tempted to compare the Jeff Bridges/Coen Brothers/new ""True Grit"" but you can't say one version is better than the other, they're different, different visions for different times.""True Grit"" (either version of the movie) follows Charles Portis'True Gritnovel pretty closely. It's still the story of 14 year old Mattie Ross who's father was murdered and she hires federal marshall, Rooster Cogburn to bring the man who murdered her father to justice. And make no mistake about it, Mattie is out for vengeance against Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), given her choice of marshalls she chooses the one most likely to kill, Cogburn only brings his man in alive accidentally.In the 1969 version you were aware you were watching a John Wayne movie, this ""True Grit"" is a western. Jeff Bridges submerges into Cogburn, his hair is dirty, he has the broken blood vessels in his face of a man who's drunk too much whisky, and Cogburn not only has trail dust on him, he's caked in the mud and blood of the trail. Hailee Steinfeld looks every bit of Mattie's 14 years and while her acumen about business matters is present we also see a girl thrown into a violent world she's not used to, Steinfeld's reactions are authentic to a 14 year old. Steinfeld's Mattie is more intense, and more realistic than Kim Darby's Mattie. The one question you have of Mattie though is, despite her precocity and determinedness to go with Cogburn into Indian Country would a men like Cogburn or Texas Ranger LeBeouf  (Matt Damon) allow her? Or would they be more likely to box her ears and send her on her way? I don't know if that question is answered in the movie.""True Grit"" does stray a little from Portis' novel especially with LaBoeuf. The Coen's, for some reason don't have LaBoeuf coming along with Mattie and Cogburn for the entire journey and when they need him back it takes a little plot wrangling to get him back into the story where Portis had him all along. Some of the humor is also stripped out or subdued. I think that takes away some of the camaraderie present in Portis' novel (and Wayne's 1969 version) and leaves some doubt as to why Cogburn would allow Mattie to come along. In fact he does try to leave her behind but she catches up with Cogburn and LaBoeuf, who have struck up a deal of their own. The moment Cogburn agrees to take Mattie along is when LaBoeuf is spanking her with a switch. We also see Cogburn stop two boys from teasing a mule, is it compassion? We're not sure, it's never commented on and Cogburn doesn't show compassion in any other area of his life.""True Grit"" is different from the 1969 version and hardcore fans of Wayne may not like this version, but the Coen Brother vision of ""True Grit"" is darker, grittier, and has a great sense of style of the tone of the movie with the cinematography. The Coen's ""True Grit"" is more realistic to the era; it's the flip side of Wayne's version but no less enjoyable a movie or story.",4,"Darker, Gritier, True(r) Grit",1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,3011,"['Everybody', 'familiar', 'John', 'Wayne', '1969', 'True', 'Grit', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'tempted', 'compare', 'Jeff', 'Bridges/Coen', 'Brothers/new', 'True', 'Grit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'one', 'version', 'better', 'other', ""'re"", 'different', 'different', 'visions', 'different', 'times', 'True', 'Grit', 'version', 'movie', 'Charles', ""Portis'True"", 'Gritnovel', 'pretty', 'closely', 'still', 'story', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'who', 'father', 'was', 'murdered', 'federal', 'marshall', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'bring', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'father', 'justice', 'make', 'mistake', 'Mattie', 'out', 'vengeance', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'given', 'choice', 'marshalls', 'one', 'most', 'likely', 'kill', 'Cogburn', 'only', 'man', 'alive', '1969', 'version', 'were', 'aware', 'were', 'watching', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'True', 'Grit', 'western', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Cogburn', 'hair', 'dirty', 'broken', 'blood', 'vessels', 'face', 'man', 'who', 'drunk', 'too', 'much', 'whisky', 'Cogburn', 'not', 'only', 'trail', 'dust', 'caked', 'mud', 'blood', 'trail', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'bit', 'Mattie', '14', 'years', 'acumen', 'business', 'matters', 'present', 'also', 'see', 'girl', 'thrown', 'violent', 'world', 'not', 'used', 'Steinfeld', 'reactions', 'are', 'authentic', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Steinfeld', 'Mattie', 'more', 'intense', 'more', 'realistic', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'Mattie', 'one', 'question', 'have', 'Mattie', 'though', 'precocity', 'determinedness', 'go', 'Cogburn', 'Indian', 'Country', 'would', 'men', 'Cogburn', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LeBeouf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'box', 'ears', 'send', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'question', 'answered', 'movie', 'True', 'Grit', 'stray', 'little', 'Portis', 'novel', 'especially', 'LaBoeuf', 'Coen', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'LaBoeuf', 'coming', 'along', 'Mattie', 'Cogburn', 'entire', 'journey', 'when', 'need', 'back', 'little', 'plot', 'wrangling', 'get', 'back', 'story', 'where', 'Portis', 'had', 'all', 'along', 'humor', 'also', 'stripped', 'out', 'subdued', 'think', 'away', 'camaraderie', 'present', 'Portis', 'novel', 'Wayne', '1969', 'version', 'doubt', 'why', 'Cogburn', 'would', 'allow', 'Mattie', 'come', 'along', 'fact', 'try', 'leave', 'behind', 'up', 'Cogburn', 'LaBoeuf', 'who', 'have', 'struck', 'up', 'deal', 'own', 'moment', 'Cogburn', 'take', 'Mattie', 'along', 'when', 'LaBoeuf', 'spanking', 'switch', 'also', 'see', 'Cogburn', 'stop', 'two', 'boys', 'teasing', 'mule', 'compassion', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'never', 'commented', 'Cogburn', ""n't"", 'show', 'compassion', 'other', 'area', 'life', 'True', 'Grit', 'different', '1969', 'version', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Wayne', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'version', 'Coen', 'Brother', 'vision', 'True', 'Grit', 'darker', 'grittier', 'great', 'sense', 'style', 'tone', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'Coen', 'True', 'Grit', 'more', 'realistic', 'era', 'flip', 'side', 'Wayne', 'version', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'story']",True Grit

1365871,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B003UESJME,K. Driscoll,"[6, 10]","Joel and Ethan Cohen's True Grit is an adaptation of the 1968 Charles Portisnovel of the same name, just as the 1969 John Wayne vehicle was (a fine movie for its own very different reasons).  The Cohen brothers are not remakingHenry Hathaway's moviebut instead weaving their very own amazing little movie adapted from the book alone.  As a bonus to watching a genuine five star Cohen brother's western, we get to see Jeff Bridges as Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn.  Bridges is as an actor that just seems to get better and better with time.  His recent turns as a serious dramatic actor have placed him at the tippity top of the short list of modern American actors who are among the very best in the world at their craft.  He consumes the character of Cogburn entirely and dominates every frame he is in, but still finds himself in a worthy threesome that includes Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Matt Damon), a quirky but effective bounty hunter wielding both a sharp nerdy tongue and a powerful Sharps carbine rifle.  The other character that matches these two is played by a hugely talented 14 year old actress named Hailee Steinfeld as the film's primary heroine.  She's the resourceful beyond her years Mattie Ross, and her along with her lovable horse Blackie force True Grit to be something beyond an immaculate and beautiful Cohen brothers' showdown at high noon.Mattie Ross essentially wants revenge against a man named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) and she wants the meanest U.S. Marshall to help track him.  She looks to enlist Rooster Cogburn and it just so happens that Chaney is wanted for another crime in Texas, so Mr. La Boeuf is on his trail as well.  Mattie does everything she can to take part in hunting Chaney down and in the process proves an effective ally in her own way.  The bunch encounter numerous enemies including Barry Pepper's enjoyable villain Lucky Ned.  Like most Cohen brother's movies this could be about nothing at all and we would find the characters and style so rich and intriguing that it would be nearly impossible to not enjoy every minute.  True Grit is more than that as there is not only something to be said for the story but something to be said for the way the story is presented as a piece of classic cinema.  It's not something the Cohen brothers have really done before but here they execute a true genre film with absolute perfection, and with their trademarks intact, and only muted enough perhaps to keep the uninitiated in their seats.There's been some Oscar buzz surrounding True Grit and there should be.  I'm surprised some critics have dissented.  All three major performances could see nominations; so could the cinematography, screenplay adaptation, and direction.

Since it was yet another remake by Hollywood, in a long line of remakes, I expected them to feel the need to change the movie from the orginal which they did.  I don't know if it's these changes or what, but this movie just doesn't flow well.  Jeff Bridges does a good job of acting and I like him, but his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn just doesn't flow.  It's too dis-jointed from when he jumps personalities between the drunk, the grissled tough sheriff, the braggart, etc. and I kept waiting for the directors to yell ""cut, do it over"".  Another part of the problem is they not only re-made a movie that didn't need re-made, but they stole lines from the 2nd version of this movie with John Wayne, in ""Rooster Cogburn (and the lady)"".  This particular scene was a terrible reproduction of the original scene of Rooster shooting the 'corn dodgers'.  Just out of nowhere they slap in their version of this scene and it didn't fit in the movie at all, almost as if it was an after thought to do this and they randomly picked a spot in the movie to do it.  And unfortunatley Matt Damon's portrayal of LeBoeuf was just down right annoying with the monotone steadiness of his voice.Basically, if you've seen the original True Grit with John Wayne, this movie doesn't measure up.

God help the poor devil who has to watch a movie now days amongst the unwashed never-shutup masses in an actual theater.  In terms of the film, it has to be seen as a separate piece of work from the original to be enjoyed - but, of course, most people are interested in how it compares to the famous original.That said, with the ability to see the new ""True Grit"" from the comforts of home and uninterrupted by crying babies and over indulgent idiot parents, and with the requisite adult beverage at my side, I think it is a fine film but inferior to the original (if comparisons have to be made). It is easy enough to point out the differences between John Wayne and Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon and Glen Campbell. However, to me, what I most noticed were the differences between the subordinate roles i.e. the actor who played the horse trader in the new film and the GREAT Strother Martin from the original. The new movie is a definite step down when it comes to supporting roles.  For cryin' out loud, who are you going to find to best Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper? I say the man does not exist. For God's sake, Dennis Hopper had a MINOR role in the original film.  There are no Dennis Hoppers in minor roles in the re-make and that's just a fact.As for Mattie, I enjoyed the performance of Steinfeld but found it inferior to Kim Darby's rendering. Specifically, I found her performance less humorous and more stilted (but still good). She is acting and sometimes it is very evident.  Darby was natural in the role.Last, there is a mythic quality to the old version. John Wayne, whose history literally tracks to the beginnings of movies, casts a shadow that it is unfair to expect anyone to match. When you watch Wayne, with that big belly and eye patch, it's as if you are watching film of U.S. Grant.  Though ACT-ORRS and general arty types hate to admit it, Wayne was damn good at what he did.  It might have been limited in range, but there was genius within that range.  It is unfair to expect anyone to live up to that.That said, I thought Bridges performance was absolutely game. He was the strength of the movie and, as he often does, played to the more subtle attributes of his role. As I think anyone who takes movies seriously knows, Jeff Bridges is one of the best actors of his generation. I loved him in ""True Grit"".I have to say I thought the line in the original about Labeouf being proud of his cowlick was written specifically for hair-perfect Glen Campbell, but by-gollee, a pert-near exact line showed up in the remake.In short, don't fret over the old vs. the new (though it is impossible not to compare on some level).

1365877,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B003UESJME,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[0, 0]","I stand amazed at how closely Jeff Bridges' Rooster Cogburn resembles Bad Blake fromCrazy Heartwhile remaining a completely different character.  It's almost as great as the amazement I feel trying to compare Bridges to John Wayne.  At root, this is not a remake of the 1969 Oscar-winning classic movie; it applies a 21st Century vision to the 19th Century, the closing frontier, and the end of an era.Back in 1893, Frederick Jackson Turner wrote, inThe Significance of the Frontier in American History, that to understand America, you must understand the frontier principle.  Novelist Charles Portis clearly understood what this meant.  The 1969 movie diluted this somewhat, though coming at a time of national disillusionment with Vietnam and the vague optimism embodied in Wayne himself, it at least acknowledged the reality of changing times and adjusting values.This film, in some ways closer to Portis' novel, also recognizes closings.  As the rah-rah boosterism of the Bush administration gives way to economic malaise and cynicism, we live in a time much like that depicted in this film.  As grizzled Rooster Cogburn, slick LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), and legalistic Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) struggle for control of their mission, they represent conflicting forces struggling to inherit the new American situation.Because the frontier plays such a central role in American psychology, this mythological representation, so very different from the prior version, inevitably speaks to what America needs right now.  Comparing it to John Wayne's iconic version is absurd.  This isn't 1969, and our needs and struggles have changed.  This bleak, fog-shrouded apocalypse speaks to us right now, as our old ways vanish and our future remains undetermined, distant, and vague.",5,21st Century Western,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,1776,"['stand', 'amazed', 'how', 'closely', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Bad', 'Blake', 'fromCrazy', 'Heartwhile', 'remaining', 'completely', 'different', 'character', 'almost', 'as', 'great', 'amazement', 'feel', 'trying', 'compare', 'Bridges', 'John', 'Wayne', 'root', 'not', 'remake', '1969', 'Oscar-winning', 'classic', 'movie', '21st', 'Century', 'vision', '19th', 'Century', 'closing', 'frontier', 'end', 'era.Back', '1893', 'Frederick', 'Jackson', 'Turner', 'wrote', 'inThe', 'Significance', 'Frontier', 'American', 'History', 'understand', 'America', 'must', 'understand', 'frontier', 'principle', 'Novelist', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'clearly', 'understood', 'what', 'meant', '1969', 'movie', 'diluted', 'somewhat', 'coming', 'time', 'national', 'disillusionment', 'Vietnam', 'vague', 'optimism', 'embodied', 'Wayne', 'least', 'acknowledged', 'reality', 'changing', 'times', 'adjusting', 'values.This', 'film', 'ways', 'closer', 'Portis', 'novel', 'also', 'closings', 'rah-rah', 'boosterism', 'Bush', 'administration', 'way', 'economic', 'malaise', 'cynicism', 'live', 'time', 'much', 'depicted', 'film', 'grizzled', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'slick', 'LaBoeuf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'legalistic', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'struggle', 'control', 'mission', 'represent', 'conflicting', 'forces', 'struggling', 'inherit', 'new', 'American', 'situation.Because', 'frontier', 'plays', 'central', 'role', 'American', 'psychology', 'mythological', 'representation', 'so', 'very', 'different', 'prior', 'version', 'inevitably', 'what', 'America', 'right', 'now', 'Comparing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'iconic', 'version', 'absurd', ""n't"", '1969', 'needs', 'struggles', 'have', 'changed', 'bleak', 'fog-shrouded', 'apocalypse', 'speaks', 'right', 'now', 'old', 'ways', 'vanish', 'future', 'undetermined', 'distant', 'vague']",True Grit

1365879,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003UESJME,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[105, 118]","In my world, the arrival of any film by the estimable Coen brothers is a welcome sight. But I must admit, I was a little surprised when I heard they were taking on a new version of ""True Grit."" In a sly way, however, it made sense. I have always felt that the 1969 John Wayne film version underserved the subversively comic masterwork by Charles Portis. I thought that perhaps the Coens were, thus, the ideal pair to bring the cynicism, eccentricity and subtle humor of this fine novel (and underrated American classic) to the big screen. The Coens assembled a big-name cast including Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin for this incarnation that manages to be true to both the source novel and the previous film--but isn't really a definitive new vision. However, that said, this ""True Grit"" is a solidly constructed and very entertaining western that has a lot to recommend it.Unfamiliar with the story? Probably not, but here's a quick run down. Fourteen year old Mattie Ross arrives in town to claim the body of her father who has been gunned down by a notorious outlaw. Local law enforcement seems ineffectual and the culprit (Brolin) has set off into Indian territory to parlay with another band of renegades (led by Pepper). With dogged persistence, Mattie strikes up some financing and hires Deputy Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Bridges) to track the man down for her. Seems like she's got a little vigilante justice on her mind! But a Texas Ranger (Damon) is also in pursuit and the three form a tenuous, and ever shifting, relationship as they track their prey.To me, the book's greatest asset has to be Mattie Ross--an undeniably unique narrative voice. While the Wayne version features a plucky Kim Darby in the role, the film is largely a vehicle to showcase The Duke. Rooster Cogburn was to become his late career iconic role and the film won him an Oscar. Bridges does well with the cantankerous Cogburn, but the Coens have delivered the film back into the hands of the delightful Mattie Ross. As portrayed by the strong and stoic Hailee Steinfeld, who has deadpan earnestness down to perfection, she is front and central where she belongs. Steinfeld has been receiving some justified accolades as one of this year's finest supporting actresses--but, make no mistake, this is the lead role in every conceivable way. Her interplay with Bridges is a true delight and her relationship with Damon brings surprising depth.All the performances are solid, I especially liked Brolin's small but pivotal role as the catalyst for the entire expedition. The film looks and sounds great. The screenplay is tight and amusing. If anything, the ending seems a bit rushed--it's boom and we're out of here with a flash forward that doesn't really feel cohesive to the rest of the picture.

1365884,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B003UESJME,"kone ""kone""","[5, 11]","The Coen brothers showed their own brand of true grit, going against all common sense by remaking the classic movie, ""True Grit"", and in the process, the Coens earned their spurs in delivering a film that is clearly one of the best of 2010. This is not your parent's version of the 1969 version starring John Wayne (and I consider it an excellent movie).  On the contrary!  The Coen's ""True Grit"" is more true to the book (author Charles Portis), has much better acting performances from the major stars, and keeps the viewer's interest from beginning to end with a ""gritty"" western story that unwinds with equal portions of suspense, drama, and humor.The key to any successful movie is the storyline and casting of the major characters.  If the story is believable and tells an interesting tale, the addition of the right actors and actresses, the right music to set the mood, and firm direction make the movie truly special.  ""True Grit"" is all of this and much more.Clearly, Hailee Steinfeld steals every scene she is in, and must be considered a favorite for best supporting actress of the year.  She nails Portis' ""Mattie Ross"" with a dead-on performance.  Steinfeld is Mattie Ross!  How she does this at thirteen years herself is amazing.  She captures every mood, every expression, every nuance perfectly.  The entire premise of the movie hinges on the very words the movie begins with:  ""People do not give it credence that a fourteen year-old girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood..."".  Yet because Steinfeld so perfectly captures the essence of Mattie Ross, the viewer is lassoed and the adventure is on.  Steinfeld is the star of this show hands-down.Playing the role of the ""greasy, vagabond, drunkard, and notorious thumper"", Deputy Marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn, is Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges.  Bridges' performance is also Oscar worthy.  He plays Cogburn exactly as Portis envisioned him.  Bridges the actor completely disappears behind the eye patch and unkempt whiskers of the marshal with ""true grit"".  Bridges is Cogburn as much as Steinfeld is Mattie Ross.Rounding out the excellent cast is Matt Damon as Texas Ranger LeBoeuf (pronounced ""LaBeef"").  Damon appears at ease clanking around in his ""great brutal spurs"", comfortable as the somewhat self-adoring antagonist that rubs Cogburn the wrong way.  The dialogue between LaBoeuf, Ross, and Cogburn is witty, terse, and funny.The movie can be appreciated on many levels.  It can be viewed purely as entertainment through the story, characters, and the acting performances.  The movie can also be appreciated for the more subtle themes that undercurrent the film.  For example, who (or what) is the movie named for?  All three main characters show their grit throughout the film.  Cogburn is depicted as a boozy, one-eyed bushwhacker who lives without any regard for others.  Yet, when he sees two boys torturing a mule, he frees the mule and punishes the boys with swift kicks to their rear-ends.  Conversely, Cogburn later brutally abuses Ross' horse when he races on its back to save Mattie's life.  The relationship between Mattie Ross, Marshal Cogburn, and LaBoeuf also deserves attention.  Both men disregard Ross as a mere child early on, but later come to respect her (""You've earned your spurs""), and in Cogburn's case, develop a  paternal protective love for her as well.  Real people are rarely all good or all bad; we are instead a complex mixture of both.  Indeed, to the Coen's credit, their characters cannot be painted with a single brush stroke.  Even the chief outlaw in the story, Lucky Ned Pepper, spares Mattie's life when he could have easily done worse.The Coens sought to make their version of ""True Grit"" more true to the book, and for the most part they succeed.  This version is darker, less light-hearted, more serious, and more gritty than the 1969 version.  For those who have read the book, there are definite departures and many deletions from Portis' narrative.  For example, in the movie, LaBoeuf's role is changed appreciably.  The movie also has a scene where Cogburn and Mattie view a horse approaching with what appears to be a bear on it.  This scene, inserted apparently for comic relief, is not in the book, and adds nothing substantial (or humorous) to the movie.  I beleive the plot is weakened through these departures and deletions, and this is why I give it 4 of 5 stars.  At 1 hour and 50 minutes, the film flies by, and I believe the already terse script would only be strengthened by the additional details left out.  For those viewers who never read the book the omissions and departures will not be noticed.  For those who have seen the 1969 version, the ending will be a great surprise (again, true to the book).I applaud the Coens for delivering a western that tells a great story, has wonderful casting and acting performances, and is visually beautiful.  While this film probably won't singlehandedly revive the nearly dead American West genre, it certainly earns its place among many other fine western films.  The audience I was in appreciated the film enthusiastically.  I recommend this film (and the book),True Gritto viewers over age twelve.  (The film contains at least one scene of graphic (but realistic) violence).konedog",4,"True Grit (2010) Has ""True Grit"" in this Remake!",1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,5309,"['Coen', 'brothers',

Along the way they sometimes teamup with Texas Ranger Lebeouf (Matt Damon) seeking the outlaw for a seperate reward.  The only things standing in their way are rough terrain, bad weather, their own conflicting personalities, and of course a gang of well armed outlaws.First of all the acting was excellent. I should note that despite being a big John Wayne fan I have never seen all of the original so I cannot fully compare Bridges' performance to the Duke.  That said Bridges does a masterful job at portraying Rooster Cogburn.  Just like the character in the novel, Cogburn in the film displays both a good dose of humor and clear lethality.  Hailee Steinfeld is superb as Mattie Ross.  Ross is a fascinating character in both the film and the novel.  Nice to see a devoutly Christian chararter as an intelligent protagonist but the character is also conversely rather saucy and somewhat ruthless.  Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper all deliver solid performances as well.The cinematography conveys the sweeping landscape of the American west.  Sound editing is quite good.  The score has an interesting quality in that it is largely based on traditional church hymns--especially ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"".  This turns out to be quite appropriate for both the plot and setting.  One quality I like about True Grit is its ability to make one feel they are watching the nineteenth century.  Superb use of costumes and sets to accomplish this effect.The action scenes but especially the climatic showdaown are well handled and not overdone.  The story itself moves from being fairly dark to quite humorous.  The plot actually stays surprisingly close to that of the book.  I would not recommend the film for younger children due to the violence.  Otherwise I highly recommend it to western fans.",5,Nearly Flawless Western,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,2276,"['True', 'Grit', 'modern', 'Western', 'Classic', 'have', 'seen', 'fair', 'number', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Westerns', 'such', 'Shane', 'Searchers', 'Unforgiven', 'etc', 'said', 'one', 'favorites', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'best', 'story', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'hunt', 'down', 'outlaw', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'killed', 'pa', 'Arkansas', '1878-1880', 'drinking', 'trigger', 'happy', 'Marshal', 'named', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'assist', 'way', 'sometimes', 'teamup', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Lebeouf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'seeking', 'outlaw', 'seperate', 'reward', 'only', 'things', 'standing', 'way', 'are', 'rough', 'terrain', 'bad', 'weather', 'own', 'conflicting', 'personalities', 'course', 'gang', 'well', 'armed', 'outlaws.First', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'should', 'note', 'being', 'big', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fan', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'compare', 'Bridges', 'performance', 'Duke', 'said', 'Bridges', 'masterful', 'job', 'portraying', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Just', 'character', 'novel', 'Cogburn', 'film', 'good', 'dose', 'humor', 'clear', 'lethality', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'superb', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'Ross', 'fascinating', 'character', 'film', 'novel', 'Nice', 'see', 'devoutly', 'Christian', 'chararter', 'intelligent', 'protagonist', 'character', 'also', 'conversely', 'rather', 'saucy', 'somewhat', 'ruthless', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performances', 'well.The', 'cinematography', 'conveys', 'sweeping', 'landscape', 'American', 'west', 'Sound', 'editing', 'quite', 'good', 'score', 'interesting', 'quality', 'largely', 'based', 'traditional', 'church', 'hymns', 'especially', 'Leaning', 'Everlasting', 'Arms', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'plot', 'setting', 'One', 'quality', 'like', 'True', 'Grit', 'ability', 'make', 'one', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'Superb', 'use', 'costumes', 'sets', 'accomplish', 'effect.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'especially', 'climatic', 'showdaown', 'are', 'well', 'handled', 'not', 'overdone', 'story', 'being', 'fairly', 'dark', 'quite', 'humorous', 'plot', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'close', 'book', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'younger', 'children', 'due', 'violence', 'Otherwise', 'highly', 'recommend', 'western', 'fans']",True Grit

Also silly are the copious one and two star short stories from the whiners. I had already seen this version of the film when I bought it. I read as many 1+2 star reviews as I could handle out of simple curiosity, perhaps entertainment. All I have to say is ""damn dude, don't watch it if it offends you so much."" Certainly don't buy it, right? This is a rebuttal to the nay-sayers.This is a good movie, and John Wayne couldn't act. Let's face it, The Duke played a puffed-up version of himself in every movie he ever graced with his presence. I'm glad you all loved him, but, the book never mentions John Wayne anywhere. The original flick was no more correct, either.Deviations from he book? The addition of a few character twists and interesting moments is referred to as artistic license, which goes way back to Homer, Plato, the Old Testament, and beyond. The point of literature is to use your imagination(not the Duke) to fill in the colors, textures, and gaps in the story. Besides, would you have wanted to watch the same exact movie only with different actors?I liked Bridges' character. What the other reviewers failed to define, is that you aren't supposed to bond emotionally with him. HE""S A BAD MAN! YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM!

His english... well, he could have talked less like he'd been born in a cave(to a retarded grizzly), but it didn't anger me personally or cause me not to understand him at any point. Furthermore, frontiersmen at the time were widely known for their garbled, unique speech patterns.The verdict: If you love the Duke and Dirty Harry, just don't watch it.

1365903,A36EW68H08UOCS,B003UESJME,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[4, 7]","John Wayne's lone Academy Award was for the first film version of True Grit, even if some felt the award represented a ""lifetime achievement"".  Still, if you're going to produce a film that is guaranteed to be compared to the best of The Duke, you'd better know what you're doing.  Joel and Ethan Coen know what they're doing.This film version of Charles Portis' novel has a scruffy texture that feels more realistic than dozens of Westerns - including the great 1969 John Wayne version.  We open in a Fort Smith Arkansas that looks like a bustling, growing frontier town rather than a few Hollywood prop houses erected along a muddy boulevard.  We meet Maddie Ross - played by young Hailee Steinfield in a career-making turn.  Fourteen-year-old Maddie has come to town because her father has been murdered by ne'er do well Tom Chaney, played by Josh Brolin.  Chaney has fled to the Indian Territories and the gang of Lucky Ned Pepper, played with rotten-toothed enthusiasm by Barry Pepper.  In his early scenes Mr. Pepper seems to be recreating the earlier performance by Robert Duvall.  Later, his inflection reminded me of Brando.  If you're an actor looking for role models you could do far worse than Duvall and Brando.The local sheriff tells Maddie he can't pursue Chaney because he has no jurisdiction in the Indian Territory.  She is told that a Federal Marshall may take on the task.  She asks which Marshall would be the best and is told that this one is the best tracker, and that one is the best overall and the meanest and most ruthless of the Marshalls is Rooster Cogburn.  Maddie tracks down Rooster in court where he is giving testimony about the twenty-third man he has killed on the job.  She knows she has the right man and offers him a fifty dollar bounty on top of the usual reward as Chaney is now a wanted man.  Rooster was the John Wayne role in the original film, and it's difficult to imagine how daunting it must have been to try a new take on Rooster Cogburn.  Fresh from his first Oscar, and familiar with the Coen Brothers from his work in another iconic role - as the leading ""Dude"" in ""The Big Lebowski"" - Jeff Bridges throws himself into the role of Rooster Cogburn in a way that made me not miss John Wayne at all.  Rooster is old and fat and ""likes to pull a cork"" so Maddie is taking no small risk giving all her money to Rooster, then following him on the manhunt.Rounding out the cast is Matt Damon as Laboeuf, a Texas Ranger who is after an even larger reward than Maddie's fifty dollars: it seems Mr. Chaney also murdered a Texas Senator, so the reward in Texas is even higher.  Damon is a significant upgrade from Glen Campbell in the earlier film.  One of my personal movie pet peeves occurs when a non-southerner tries adopting a southern accent.

1365905,AAYE34TCTNV2R,B003UESJME,MarlowesMom,"[4, 8]","Joel and Ethan Coen's adaption of Charles Portis's novel ""True Grit"" is, for my money, in the top tier of their work, and a very fine movie.For readers who think they don't like Westerns, I don't generally like them either. I enjoy looking at the horses and landscapes, but most of the time the simplistic stories and stilted acting bore me. There are a couple of exceptions, typically comic takes on the genre like ""Two Mules for Sister Sara,"" but in general, not a fan. I've never seen the 1969 version of ""True Grit"" with John Wayne, so I will neither cloud nor enlighten, depending on your feelings about it, this review with comparisons to it.I'll start with the script, which is truly unusual. It hews closely to the novel, itself a small masterpiece of deadpan comic genius. The narrator, Mattie Ross, is a middle-aged spinster looking back on an adventure she had at age 14 shortly after the Civil War, seeking  revenge on her father's killer, Tom Chaney, in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Mattie speaks with the stern and proper diction and Biblical references of a 19th century Presbyterian preacher. Initially I found the spoken language in the film a bit disconcerting, but as with Shakespeare, once I fell into its old-fashioned rhythm, I loved the bone-dry humor and the sense of time and place it evoked.The acting has been widely and justly praised. Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn, the Deputy US Marshal Mattie hires to track her father's killer, truly inhabits this run-down character whose morality has been shaped, some would say horribly distorted, by the harshness of the Civil War and life in the wild frontier thereafter. He's a drunk and a southerner, but there his similarities with the character he played in ""Crazy Heart"" end. Hailee Steinfeld, a 14-year-old girl from Tarzana, CA, is brilliantly provoking, funny and finally admirable as the whip-smart, determined Mattie. She handles the old-fashioned language well, does not suffer at all from misguided efforts to be cute or charming, and never seems like a modern kid playing dress-up, a fault I frequently find with child actors in period films. Matt Damon, who can be a bit bland, is perfectly cast here as the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf who accompanies Mattie and Cogburn on their hunt for Tom Chaney. Damon is vain, self-important, funny, and ultimately heroic. I gained a lot of respect for Damon with this movie. The smaller roles are, as always with the Coens, well-cast and memorably played.Roger Deakins' cinematography is my favorite of his work for the Coens. He's always been brilliant at capturing just the right lighting and mood. This is the first time I remember him capturing so many images of pure, jaw-dropping beauty.This is a Coen Brothers movie, and you will find bits of the weirdness you've come to look forward to. Among the Coenesque treats they add to the book is a scene where Mattie spends a night with her father's body at the undertaker's. Playing the hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms""  over the closing credits has to be another of their perfectly-selected and perfectly-placed tributes to ""The Night of the Hunter."" Still, for the most part, they tell the story in a straightforward manner, and the result is perhaps the most emotionally engaging movie they've ever made, including ""Fargo.""While the Coens will always have my gratitude and respect for avoiding formulaic popcorn-munching fare, some of their movies really don't connect for me. I fell asleep at ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" and I couldn't love ""No Country for Old Men,"" though that was partly a problem I had with the source material. I found ""True Grit"" to be fast-moving (except for one somewhat slow scene at the beginning where Cogburn is testifying about an arrest he made, intended to expose his violent approach to law enforcement) and involving from start to finish. I was sobbing when I left the theater, and I've NEVER cried at a Coen Brothers movie. The price Mattie and her horse Little Blackie pay for revenge is a high one. As Mattie says, nothing is free except the grace of God, and that cannot be deserved or earned.I can't say I think ""True Grit"" will be everyone's cup of tea. The humor won't be to all tastes, and it gets pretty violent at times, but its a lovely, lovingly-made film, appropriate for ages 10 and up (maybe older depending on how you feel about the violence).",5,At the Top of the Coen Canon--From Someone Who Isn't a Fan of Westerns,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,4377,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'adaption', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'novel', 'True', 'Grit', 'money', 'top', 'tier', 'work', 'very', 'fine', 'movie.For', 'readers', 'who', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Westerns', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'like', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'horses', 'landscapes', 'most', 'time', 'simplistic', 'stories', 'stilted', 'acting', 'are', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'typically', 'comic', 'genre', 'Two', 'Mules', 'Sister', 'Sara', 'general', 'not', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', '1969', 'version', 'True', 'Grit', 'John', 'Wayne', 'will', 'cloud', 'enlighten', 'depending', 'feelings', 'review', 'comparisons', 'it.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'script', 'truly', 'unusual', 'closely', 'novel', 'small', 'masterpiece', 'deadpan', 'comic', 'genius', 'narrator', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'middle-aged', 'spinster', 'looking', 'back', 'adventure', 'had', 'age', '14', 'shortly', 'Civil', 'War', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'father', 'killer', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Indian', 'Territory', 'now', 'Oklahoma', 'Mattie', 'stern', 'proper', 'diction', 'Biblical', 'references', '19th', 'century', 'Presbyterian', 'preacher', 'Initially', 'found', 'spoken', 'language', 'film', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'Shakespeare', 'once', 'fell', 'old-fashioned', 'rhythm', 'loved', 'bone-dry', 'humor', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'acting', 'been', 'widely', 'justly', 'praised', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Deputy', 'US', 'Marshal', 'Mattie', 'track', 'father', 'killer', 'truly', 'run-down', 'character', 'morality', 'been', 'shaped', 'would', 'say', 'horribly', 'distorted', 'harshness', 'Civil', 'War', 'life', 'wild', 'frontier', 'thereafter', 'drunk', 'southerner', 'there', 'similarities', 'character', 'played', 'Crazy', 'Heart', 'end', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', '14-year-old', 'girl', 'Tarzana', 'CA', 'brilliantly', 'provoking', 'funny', 'finally', 'admirable', 'whip-smart', 'determined', 'Mattie', 'old-fashioned', 'language', 'well', 'not', 'suffer', 'misguided', 'efforts', 'be', 'cute', 'charming', 'never', 'modern', 'kid', 'playing', 'dress-up', 'fault', 'frequently', 'find', 'child', 'actors', 'period', 'films', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'bland', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'here', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LaBoeuf', 'who', 'Mattie', 'Cogburn', 'hunt', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Damon', 'vain', 'self-important', 'funny', 'ultimately', 'heroic', 'gained', 'lot', 'respect', 'Damon', 'movie', 'smaller', 'roles', 'are', 'always', 'Coens', 'well-cast', 'memorably', 'played.Roger', 'Deakins', 'cinematography', 'favorite', 'work', 'Coens', 'always', 'been', 'brilliant', 'capturing', 'just', 'right', 'lighting', 'mood', 'first', 'time', 'remember', 'capturing', 'so', 'many', 'images', 'pure', 'jaw-dropping', 'beauty.This', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'bits', 'weirdness', ""'ve"", 'come', 'look', 'forward', 'Coenesque', 'add', 'book', 'scene', 'where', 'Mattie', 'night', 'father', 'body', 'undertaker', 'Playing', 'hymn', 'Leaning', 'Everlasting', 'Arms', 'closing', 'credits', 'be', 'perfectly-selected', 'perfectly-placed', 'tributes', 'Night', 'Hunter', 'Still', 'most', 'part', 'tell', 'story', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'result', 'perhaps', 'most', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'made', 'including', 'Fargo', 'Coens', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'gratitude', 'respect', 'avoiding', 'formulaic', 'popcorn-munching', 'fare', 'movies', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'fell', 'asleep', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'love', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'was', 'partly', 'problem', 'had', 'source', 'material', 'found', 'True', 'Grit', 'be', 'fast-moving', 'one', 'somewhat', 'slow', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'Cogburn', 'testifying', 'arrest', 'made', 'intended', 'expose', 'violent', 'approach', 'law', 'enforcement', 'involving', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'sobbing', 'when', 'left', 'theater', ""'ve"", 'NEVER', 'cried', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'movie', 'price', 'Mattie', 'horse', 'Little', 'Blackie', 'pay', 'revenge', 'high', 'one', 'Mattie', 'nothing', 'free', 'grace', 'God', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'deserved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'think', 'True', 'Grit', 'will', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'tastes', 'pretty', 'violent', 'times', 'lovely', 'lovingly-made', 'film', 'appropriate', 'ages', '10', 'up', 'maybe', 'older', 'depending', 'how', 'feel', 'violence']",True Grit

It isn't so much the material as the treatment. The film is based on Charles' Portis' 1968 novel of the same name, which was first adapted for the silver screen in 1969, a film for which John Wayne won his only Academy Award. I have not seen the 1969 film, so I can only hope that this one is more interesting in comparison than it is on its own. It takes place in Arkansas of the late 19th century. Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a clever, headstrong 14-year-old come to Fort Smith to claim the body of her father Frank Ross, who was murdered by a ne'er-do-well employee named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin).Mattie is a shrewd, pushy businesswomen who manages to wrap up her father's affairs profitably, and she is not content to let her father's killer waltz off into Indian territory never to be seen again. She insists that  Chaney be brought to justice, and, when she finds out that only US Marshals have jurisdiction in the Indian Territory, she offers the meanest, most pitiless Marshal she can find $50 to find Chaney. Deputy Marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn has shot 23 men in his 4 years on the job. He turns Mattie down, but the young woman has a way of imposing herself, and soon she is off on an adventure with the trigger-happy Marshall and a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who wants to bring Chaney in for killing a state senator.Coen brothers films are fascinating for the astounding variety of perspectives on a fundamentally disordered universe that Joel and Ethan Coen endeavor to explore. They all have the same, very particular, world view. The differences are in how the protagonists cope with that world, according to their own personalities and limitations. The Wild West is, on the face of it, an ideal milieu in which to set this existential drama, as it is a harsh environment where people lived at the mercy of nature and of each other.There are 3 protagonists in ""True Grit"", but we know Mattie better than the others, and the story is her recollection. There is a lot of black humor, which is welcome in an otherwise plodding narrative. Cogburn talks too much -and mumbles, at that. The film runs too long by at least 15 minutes, and most of it seems to be spent bickering. I found none of the characters the least bit interesting. Their adventure is dreadfully dull. And ""True Grit"" doesn't have anything interesting to say about their interaction with a world they can't control. I was left wondering what fans of Westerns will make of this film. Cogburn is a caricature, and LaBeouf is underwritten. Mattie is the only fully-written character. While I enjoyed watching her argue with people in Fort Smith, she's as drab as the rest once they embark on the hunt.",3,Just Dull.

1365916,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B003UESJME,Monkdude,"[4, 7]","True Grit, as told by The Coen Brothers, is maybe the best western since Unforgiven. The way the complex dialogue was written reminded me of HBO's Deadwood. The story is really just a basic revenge tale, but the three lead actors and clever dialogue are what makes it interesting.Jeff Bridges is once again in a role that he seems to be living, rather than pretending to inhabit. You can't understand half of what he says, but that's part of his realistic appeal and what subtitles are made for once it comes out on DVD. Matt Damon turns in one of his best performances, but I still can't shake the thought of that it's just Matt Damon dressed up like a cowboy. I do like the banter between him and Bridges. For my money, the real star of the show is newcomer Hailee Steinfeld. This 14-year-old actress blew me away with her great line delivery and tough attitude. She's got a real chance at the best supporting actress Oscar. Oh yeah, Josh Brolin has his name on the poster, but he's barely in the movie.I was real close to bumping this up to five stars, but it just didn't blow me away. After seeing it was one of the best overall reviewed films of the year, I was hoping for more than just your standard western fare, but the crisp writing and high level acting made up for the lack of vision.If you haven't yet, check out the remake of 3:10 to Yuma from a few years back.

It had great casting, dialogue, scenery, and a good storyline.  There may have been a few quirks here and there, but not enough to keep this from being a five star movie to me.Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a fourteen year old girl who has come to town to collect the body of her father.  In addition to this, she is on a mission to also find his killer Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin)and see him hanged.  To do this, after asking around, she hires dubious lawman (although he supposedly has grit) Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). After much argument on whether she can go on the trip or not, they set off with the addition of a Texas Ranger La Beouf (Matt Damon) who has been in pursuit of Chaney since he killed a man in Texas.They don't stay together long though.  La Beouf and Cogburn just rub each other wrong and they split up, with Mattie staying with Cogburn.  They encounter plenty of danger and with Cogburn's senses sometimes not the best from drinking, Mattie has her doubts.  Chaney has taken up with a gang of robbers and the stakes become even higher.  Mattie realizes just what kind of danger she has gotten herself into, but is still determined to capture her father's killer.The characters were all very well cast in this movie.  The fact that Mattie was an unknown was excellent, and she did an amazing job that let you really connect with her character.  Jeff Bridges was funny as Cogburn and he really pulled off the gruff, funny Marshall well.  Matt Damon's character was a bit annoying, but I think that maybe he was supposed to be.The scenes were all shot in beautiful places and there was only one that seemed out of place.  The scene with snakes was kind of fake looking, but luckily it wasn't that long of a scene.  They played mostly instrumental music throughout the movie but it fit in nicely with the different scenes.  Weak stomached people or people with young children should take note however, this movie contains a lot of violence and gore that is not shielded from viewers eyes.I definitely plan on adding this movie to my home collection.

Yes, I said comedy.  Most of the movie is spent on dialogue with only about 15 minutes of real action.  And it is the dialogue that provides the comedy.  Jeff Bridges plays a drunk whose slurred speech is filled with great one-liners while Matt Damon plays an over-talkative law officer, and their relationship throughout the movie alludes to that famous TV show The Odd Couple.  Josh Brolin is perfect as the villain, both in look, talk and style.  The lead actress, and the role around which the movie revolves is Hailee Steinfield.

It also helped that the protagonist is a 14 year old girl, making it an ideal assignment for literary analysis in schools by english teachers. 'True Grit'  was made into a movie starring John Wayne and Kim Darby and directed by Henry Hathaway in 1969. It is a great film and showcased an aging John Wayne at his best. However the film, as good as it was, did not reflect the uniqueness of Portis's novel and was a poor substitute for the novel. Along comes the Coen brothers.The Coen's version of 'True Grit' is a truer visual enactment of the Charles Portis novel. it may not be as interesting to watch for many people as the Hathaway version.

I am an avid John Wayne fan and I was absolutely horrified that anyone would even attempt to remake this movie.  This, the ONE film for which he won an Oscar (granted, it was more of a lifetime achievement award than for his performance in True Grit but still...).  To me, it was sacrelige.  I started stuttering exclamations like ""NO!"" and ""They didn't!"" and my husband asked me what was wrong.  I had to rewind the DVR and show him. He was not nearly as upset as I was but he was surpised, as well.  I was relieved, however, to see that they had at least chosen a decent actor to play Rooster Cogburn and that the supporting cast was also on par.  As I got used to the idea, I became willing to watch this movie with an open mind and my husband really wanted to see it, so we watched it.It turns out, I enjoyed this movie.  Jeff Bridges was excellent as Rooster Cogburn.  He was difficult to understand at times, which does suit the character, HOWEVER, I feel that part of an actor's job is to deliver lines so that his audience can understand them. That was my only problem with his portrayal and I feel that it did not take that much away from the film.  I do have to say, though, that Rooster's line ""Fill your hands, you son of a %!^*#!"" sort of fell a little flat when Bridges said it.Hailee Steinfeld completely blew Kim Darby out of the water, in my book.  She was AMAZING and played off Bridges so well.  Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper were all great.  The costumes, settings, everything seemed accurate for the period and fit the tone of the story.

I'm not going to say it was a total let down, but it was pretty close.It's easier to say what I like about the film rather than what I didn't.(SPOILER ALERT)  I liked the ambush action scene, the near-end action scene and Rooster's ride.  That's about it.To begin, whoever wrote this script clearly thinks very well of themselves.  There was so much unnecessary dialogue, the film from the beginning comes across as chatty, thus rendering the characters most of the time unconvincing.Being a seasoned student of the C.War period and thereafter, there were numerous parts in the film that simply annoyed me as they seemed quite unauthentic.  I wonder if the Coen brothers bothered to have any credible historical consultants.  I think that would have helped the film.  Furthermore, certain phrases used throughout the film struck me as a sorry attempt at authentic lingo.The best acting performance came from Matt Damon and the guy who played Barry Pepper.  I felt that the cast was bogged down by the script and direction and could have done a better job.It annoyed me greatly that Jeff Bridges sounds like he has something in his mouth throughout the film, and later did Matt Damon, as well as Brolin.  While Jeff Bridges' may have been trying to come across as authentic with this form of speech, to a viewer, it only hindered his performance and frankly didn't add to his character's authenticity in my eyes.I had high hopes for True Grit.  I enjoy reading about the old west and thought I would enjoy this.

1365942,A1K6K23WG0IBWE,B003UESJME,Quadro Sinead Summer,"[0, 0]","Interesting film in that this is probably the most straight forward project the Coen brother have ever made. It's certainly a solid piece of film making, but I believe it falls rather short of the Coen's crafty uniqueness and originality that have made their films unlike so many others. The style here is more basic and predictable by the usual Hollywood style, and generally what you come to expect from a big Hollywood production. I do have a few minor gripes though. Firstly I think Josh Brolin's character has such a small appearance, and that's just plain sad because he was so great in No Country for Old Men, as he is in many of his performances. Here he is given little opportunity to shine due to a role that has rather sparse requirements. Bridges is pretty great as Cogburn, but this performance is nothing to rave about. it's also pretty common in it's execuation by Bridges. I don't think the character is one that could ever win mass raves, but that being said it's certainly good. The real gift in this film is clearly Hailee Steinfeld, who is simply genious in her role, more than well deserving of an oscar nomination. She is simply brilliant, and her performance is really the only truly beautiful thing about this film. This is clearly no 'Unforgiven' Or Wild Bunch, but it's still a pretty good western. Though I expected more Coen magic and originality, which is evident here and there, but over all this film on it's own merits works very well, but again, falls short in the area of Coen genious as we have seen it before.",4,"Not as entertaining as the original, but still a piece of great cinema!",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,1545,"['Interesting', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'straight', 'forward', 'project', 'Coen', 'brother', 'have', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'solid', 'piece', 'film', 'making', 'believe', 'rather', 'short', 'Coen', 'crafty', 'uniqueness', 'originality', 'have', 'made', 'films', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'style', 'here', 'more', 'basic', 'predictable', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'generally', 'what', 'come', 'expect', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'gripes', 'Firstly', 'think', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'character', 'small', 'appearance', 'just', 'plain', 'sad', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'many', 'performances', 'Here', 'given', 'little', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'due', 'role', 'rather', 'sparse', 'requirements', 'Bridges', 'pretty', 'great', 'Cogburn', 'performance', 'nothing', 'rave', 'about', 'also', 'pretty', 'common', 'execuation', 'Bridges', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'character', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'win', 'mass', 'raves', 'being', 'said', 'certainly', 'good', 'real', 'gift', 'film', 'clearly', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'who', 'simply', 'genious', 'role', 'more', 'well', 'deserving', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'really', 'only', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'film', 'clearly', ""'Unforgiven"", 'Or', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'western', 'expected', 'more', 'Coen', 'magic', 'originality', 'evident', 'here', 'there', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'very', 'well', 'again', 'short', 'area', 'Coen', 'genious', 'have', 'seen']",True Grit

1365944,A2WFBIPVZFYDL5,B003UESJME,"Randal Rauser ""The Tentative Apologist""","[0, 0]","&#8220;True Grit&#8221; a remake of the 1969 classic western by the great Coen Brothers (Joel and Ethan). For the most part the film plays like a straight western, though there are a couple quirky Coen moments thrown in which appear like the blackened brand on the rump of a grazing steer.  It&#8217;s always nice to find a director&#8217;s brand.The film takes place in the fall of 1877 and tells the story of Mattie Ross, a fourteen year old who is so clever that she&#8217;d leave Tom Sawyer holding the paint brush and so tough that she could take out Huck Finn with one arm tied behind her back (therein, dear reader, lies a veiled reference to events late in the film, and no there isn&#8217;t a Huck Finn cameo). Mattie&#8217;s father has just been killed by a hired hand and Mattie has been sent to identify the body and then, against her mother&#8217;s wishes (no surprise there!) to hunt down the killer. Yes, hunt down. Mattie is not content to hire a bounty hunter (though she does that). But she is determined to go along for the ride to ensure that her father and his killer both receive justice.Here kudos go to young Elizabeth Marvel who is outstanding (I was going to say she&#8217;s a marvel but then I decided not to, except that I just did) in the role of Mattie. While Marvel&#8217;s performance is a real standout, that is to take nothing away from the rest of the stellar line up. Jeff Bridges is amazing as Rooster Cogburn, the bounty hunter Mattie hires to kill her father&#8217;s murderer. Matt Damon is also excellent as the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf and Josh Brolin shines like the mud-spattered spotlight on a red neck pickup as Tom Chaney, her father&#8217;s killer.  (And let us not forget the underappreciated Barry Pepper who excels as Ned Pepper.)All throughout the film Mattie is on a quest to see Chaney hanged. But not just hanged. She wants him hanged in Arkansas. And she wants him to know why. Mattie is driven not by a blind rage but rather by a desire for retributive justice distilled and poured with as much care as the best backwoods moonshine. She is a teenage embodiment of the Count of Monte Cristo&#8217;s maxim &#8220;revenge is a dish best served cold&#8221; except you can drop revenge and slot in retribution &#8230; or justice.This clearly is a world of retribution, an eye for an eye. And in the end Mattie is the one who kills Tom Chaney with her own father&#8217;s gun. So where is the satisfaction from this exercise in just retribution? In a moment Chaney disappears over the cliff and just as quickly the recoil of the gun sends Mattie backwards and down into a cave. Inside the cave there is a corpse with a snake and in a moment Mattie is bitten. The irony is heavy given that the whole film they have been careful at night to protect the campsite from snakes. So why the bite and why now? And why does she lose an arm from the bite? And why do we keep hearing that old gospel hymn &#8220;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&#8221;?I am not sure whether the film is an unqualified indictment of retributive justice, but it certainly could be viewed that way. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. Or it leaves one person over a cliff and another deep in a cave. As for the bite of the snake, is this an echo of the serpent in the garden? Did Mattie fall for the serpent&#8217;s call to play God by exercising retributive justice instead of forgiveness?It seems to me that the film&#8217;s pivotal climax comes in the moment when Chaney and Mattie meet. After hunting him for days Mattie happens upon him at a river. It seems to me that the river is a profound clue here of another decision that Mattie could have made. Could it be that with both standing ankle deep in the water, this was the moment when she could have extended unmerited forgiveness instead of pursuing her quest for just payback? Wouldn&#8217;t you have loved to see Chaney&#8217;s face if she had declared &#8220;Tom Chaney, I came all this way to say I forgive you.&#8221;Why the river and why restorative justice and forgiveness? Consider the opening verses of Revelation 22 which feature a very different Edenic image with a river but no serpent, and at last no retribution:&#8220;And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.&#8220;In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&#8221;For the healing of the nations. For Mattie&#8217;s father. For Mattie herself. And yes, even for Tom Chaney.[Correction: After I had originally posted this my friend Tim Wilson pointed out that I confused my Matties. The actress who played Mattie as a grown woman in the film was Elizabeth Marvel. The young Mattie, the really impressive newcomer, is named Hailee Steinfeld.

But here goes.The new film version of Charles Portis' novel will invariably be compared to the original movie, but it shouldn't be.  Both are adaptations from the same source as interpreted by different film makers of different eras.  The original sought authenticity, yet still depended on John Wayne star charisma and suffered from ""clean cut"" Hollywood imagery.This version has more authentic frontier grit'n'grime.  Of course the locations are not right for Eastern Oklahoma, the Indian Territory of the novel: cinematographers are usually not geographers, and here they were obviously after a ""Western"" look of rugged canyons and bare, flat-baked prairies for good shots, not location authenticity.The dialogue retains Portis' period-piece Victorian book-prose, though its elocution falls rather clunky from the lips of its 21st century actors, for whom it is an  unnatural form of speech. . . Nor did the average person of the period speak that way in real life.  One of the defects of transferring the word imagery of print to modern action drama.Also this version is more ""evangelical"" than the original film or the book.  There's even a gratuitous Dolly Parton version of ""Leaning on the Arms"" at the closing scene.  The producers had a clear focus on the film's target audience. Though his central character Mattie is of this mold, Portis did not write his novel as a judgemental reap-what-you-sow gospel tract.As good as the original, because it's based on the same story, which remains a classic in itself.

1365958,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B003UESJME,RMurray847,"[9, 12]","14-year-old Mattie Ross has come to Ft. Smith Arkansas sometime during the ""old west"" to hire a US Marshall to track and bring to justice the man who shot and killed her father.  She hires the man she's been told has true grit, Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn, a one-eyed drunk with a ferocious reputation.  They set out for the Indian Territories, accompanied, to their chagrin, by the dandified Texas Ranger LeBoeuf.  Along the way, they encounter some strange characters and engage in dangerous and bloody adventures.This, in a tiny nutshell, is the story of TRUE GRIT, the Coen Brothers take on the famous novel (rather than a remake of the John Wayne original).  It's a fairly simple story, and to be honest, much of it is predictable.  Will the irascible drunk shake himself out of his stupor long enough to take on the job?  Will his initial dislike of the young, smart-mouth Mattie turn to respect and affection?  Will the three reluctant companions find grudging value in each other?  Will there be blood?In many ways, the Coens have made their most commercially accessible dramatic movie.  While it is full of their usual quirkiness, it all lends itself to add mood and authenticity (for example, the rococo and florid language everyone uses would on paper seem hard to believe, no doubt.  But it adds to the feeling of time and place in remarkable ways).  You don't need to grasp around for meaning (as in the mundane ending of FARGO or the abrupt conclusion to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN).  TRUE GRIT is a period piece with authentic looking sets, costumes and locations (much of it filmed in New Mexico, as was NO COUNTRY).  It is full of bloodshed, in the usual blunt, brutal, graphic style of the Coens (when someone is killed in a Coen brothers movie, there is never anything satisfying about it...we feel the life going out of the person, along with their aspirations, loves and longings).  It is also full of many funny moments, primarily in the extremely tart and intelligent dialogue.  It's one of the loveliest sounding films of the many years.One of the earliest Coen Brothers movies was MILLER'S CROSSING.  It could have been a commercial movie, except at the time, period pieces about gangsters were not much in vogue.  The dialogue was nearly as fancy as in TRUE GRIT.  There was plenty of violence (including a stunning shootout with Albert Finney).  But it starred Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden.  Fine actors...but not movie stars.In TRUE GRIT, the Coens have turned again to Jeff Bridges (from their cult comedy THE BIG LEBOWSKI).  Bridges is enjoying a popular renaissance right now, and just looking at a photo of him as Cogburn tells you he's going to give an iconic performance.  So the part is perfect for Bridges, and the times are perfect for the public to flock to see him.  His Cogburn is certainly Oscar-worthy (as was Wayne's performance, which won the award).  He looks great...both terrifying and a little silly.  But in young Hailee Steinfield, who plays Mattie, he has found a perfect foil.  Steinfield gives an amazing and riveting performance.  This young lady has so much poise, so much intelligence and so much fire that she and her character light up the screen and nearly steal all their scenes.  Steinfield makes Mattie entirely a girl of her time.  She goes into the wild and sees and endures horrible things, yet never complains...in part because she's got grit of her own, but also because in the time of the movie, kids already understood that life could be short, painful and unattractive...and that death could be too.  We do occasionally see Mattie scared, but mostly we see her innate acceptance.  It's a fabulous performance and Bridges seems delighted to have such a great co-star to spar with.  The two develop their bond so easily, we hardly notice it happening.  Matt Damon, whose part is smaller, is something of comic relief...but he has his own reserves of fire and when the three are together, he does not detract but rather enhances the film.  I wouldn't say his performance is on the same level as the other two, but he's very fine indeed, and it's nice to see him join his buddies George Clooney and Brad Pitt as a Coen Brothers actor.  I suspect it won't be his last time.TRUE GRIT, at least as presented here, is a study of the high price of retribution.  The idea of simply chasing a killer down and bringing him to deadly justice seems straightforward.  But what I suspect drew the Coen's to the material is the high price that is paid, both physically and spiritually, for this ""simple"" justice.  Grit is earned at a fairly high price.TRUE GRIT is hugely satisfying and entertaining.  The ending is a little threadbare (I believe that comes from the source material)...but otherwise, it is a thing of harsh beauty.  The camerawork and editing are impeccable.  The costumes are appropriately dirty, and reflect the hygiene of the day.  All the supporting cast (notably Barry Pepper) are excellent.  And the Coen Brothers aesthetic has been stretched (but not broken) in pleasing ways.  Because the film is so accessible, one might assume going in that the Coen's have ""sold out.""  Nothing could be further from the truth...the film has their distinctive hallmarks all over it, and this only makes the film better.  I saw the film on Christmas Day (in a sold-out theater).  It's not exactly upbeat holiday fare.  But if seeing great films puts you in a cheery mood, then TRUE GRIT leave you feeling very fine indeed.",5,Riveting look at the high cost of vengeance.

My favorite quote from the movie is when Mattie says to Rooster that she is looking for someone with true grit in helping her track her father's killer and avenge his death. True Grit is a phrase that describes Mattie's character in the movie. She is a determined young woman blessed with intelligence and courage. Hailey Steinfield's performance is the best I have seen from any actress this past year. The relationship between Rooster and Mattie evolve in the movie.Mattie and Rooster are accompanied on this journey by a man named LeBeouf. He is a ranger and is played by Matt Damon. There is one particularly exciting scene where LeBeouf rescues Mattie's life in the face of danger by Tom Chaney. Steinfield has chemistry with her co stars and that is what makes the movie work for me.The music from the movie is composed by Carter Burwell. There is a beautiful song at the end of the movie entitled Leaning On The Every Lasting Arms. This song is performed by a singer named Iris DeMent. Her voice is very moving. There is instrumental music featured in the movie derived from this tune. Burwell does a great job scoring the film. There is a scene in the movie where Mattie is stuck in a snake pit. Burwell's music in that scene makes me feel a sense of dread at the appropriate time.The film is set in Texas with some parts in New Mexico. The Coen brothers bring out the beauty of these places in the movie. I would love to ride a horse and see this beauty in person if I could.

1365964,A16QODENBJVUI1,B003UESJME,Robert Moore,"[4, 7]","First off, this is not a remake of the 1969 Henry Hathaway film starring John Wayne.  Rather, it is the second film version of Charles Portis's great 1968 novel TRUE GRIT.  Unlike the Hathaway/Wayne version, the Coen Brothers' version is far more faithful to the novel.  As an Arkansan (although I live in Chicagoan, I remain an Arkansan through and through) I loved the novel from the first of the several times I have read it, and as a result have always loathed the John Wayne film.  Although I'm a huge fan of John Wayne's westerns with John Ford and Howard Hawks, but of his other Westerns, not so much.The problems with the Hathaway film are extensive.  The script distorts the story to make it a star vehicle for John Wayne and to do this have to pretty much gut the character of the novel's main character, Mattie Ross.  Although in the novel Mattie tells Rooster that she wants to hire him because he was a man with ""true grit,"" the events of the novel reveal that even more than Cogburn, Mattie possesses the true grit referred to in the title.  The Coen Brothers correct the aberrations of the earlier film by restoring Mattie Ross to the heart of the film.  They also cast Hailee Steinfeld in the role, a vastly more appropriate actress than Kim Darby in the earlier film, who was far too old for the role (22 instead of 14).  Darby's Mattie is too timid, too inept, and lacking in intelligence and confidence.  She is a traditional heroine in need of a hero.  But Hailee Steinfeld's Mattie is the Mattie Ross of the novel.  It is emblematic of the two films that John Wayne won an Oscar for his performance (which he truly did not deserve - ironically he did not even get a nomination for his greatest performance as Ethan Edwards in THE SEARCHERS, but won for a second tier performance as Rooster Cogburn), but Hailee Steinfeld looks like she will win an Oscar for this second film. An additional irony is that while Jeff Bridges's performance as Rooster Cogburn is vastly better than Wayne's, he is unlikely to win a second straight Oscar.  The Academy usually awards the Best Actor award for reasons that surpass quality of performance, and Wayne won in 1969 largely because he had never won before, while Bridges is unlikely to win this year he won last year.The other problem with the 1969 film was almost across the board weak casting.  Robert Duvall was the only strong actor other than Wayne in the film.  Glen Campbell was appalling as LaBoeuf.  The new film features a string of great actors in pretty much every role, with a huge upgrade in LaBoeuf with Matt Damon and a brilliant performance by Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney.  And while Robert Duvall has done some great work over the years, Barry Pepper was great in his small role as ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper.The script in the new film is another huge improvement over the earlier film, as is the cinematography.  There is also a significant upgrade in location shooting.  The novel and both films start off in Fort Smith, Arkansas and proceed through parts of eastern Oklahoma.  The Henry Hathaway film was shot in the Rocky Mountains, which looks absolutely nothing like Arkansas or Oklahoma.  This film was shot in Texas and New Mexico, which while not quite like northwest Arkansas and Oklahoma, is closer than the Rocky Mountains.By restoring the balance between Rooster and Mattie that drives the novel, the movie ceases to be a star vehicle for a lead actor and becomes instead a film that explores the relationship between two strong personalities.In short, if you are a lover of the novel, this is the film that finally does a beautiful book justice.It is also another great film by the Coen Brothers, who along with Martin Scorsese are the great filmmakers of their generation.  Some of their films have been less than outstanding, but they never make completely uninteresting movies.  I'd rank this up there with RAISING ARIZONA, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as one of their greatest achievements.  I can't wait to see what they do next.",5,The greatest Western since Unforgiven - one of the Coen Brothers' greatest efforts,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,4031,"['First', 'off', 'not', 'remake', '1969', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'film', 'starring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Rather', 'second', 'film', 'version', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'great', '1968', 'novel', 'TRUE', 'GRIT', 'Hathaway/Wayne', 'version', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'version', 'far', 'more', 'faithful', 'novel', 'Arkansan', 'live', 'Chicagoan', 'remain', 'Arkansan', 'loved', 'novel', 'first', 'several', 'times', 'have', 'read', 'result', 'have', 'always', 'loathed', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'John', 'Wayne', 'westerns', 'John', 'Ford', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'other', 'Westerns', 'not', 'much.The', 'problems', 'Hathaway', 'film', 'are', 'extensive', 'script', 'story', 'make', 'star', 'vehicle', 'John', 'Wayne', 'do', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'gut', 'character', 'novel', 'main', 'character', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'novel', 'Mattie', 'tells', 'Rooster', 'hire', 'was', 'man', 'true', 'grit', 'events', 'novel', 'reveal', 'even', 'more', 'Cogburn', 'Mattie', 'true', 'grit', 'referred', 'title', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'correct', 'aberrations', 'earlier', 'film', 'restoring', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'heart', 'film', 'also', 'cast', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'role', 'vastly', 'more', 'appropriate', 'actress', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'earlier', 'film', 'who', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'old', 'role', '22', 'instead', '14', 'Darby', 'Mattie', 'too', 'timid', 'too', 'inept', 'lacking', 'intelligence', 'confidence', 'traditional', 'heroine', 'need', 'hero', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'Mattie', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'novel', 'emblematic', 'two', 'films', 'John', 'Wayne', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'truly', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'ironically', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'nomination', 'greatest', 'performance', 'Ethan', 'Edwards', 'THE', 'SEARCHERS', 'won', 'second', 'tier', 'performance', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'will', 'win', 'Oscar', 'second', 'film', 'additional', 'irony', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'performance', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'vastly', 'better', 'Wayne', 'unlikely', 'win', 'second', 'straight', 'Oscar', 'Academy', 'usually', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'reasons', 'surpass', 'quality', 'performance', 'Wayne', 'won', '1969', 'largely', 'had', 'never', 'won', 'before', 'Bridges', 'unlikely', 'win', 'year', 'won', 'last', 'year.The', 'other', 'problem', '1969', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'board', 'weak', 'casting', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'was', 'only', 'strong', 'actor', 'other', 'Wayne', 'film', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'was', 'appalling', 'LaBoeuf', 'new', 'film', 'string', 'great', 'actors', 'pretty', 'much', 'role', 'huge', 'upgrade', 'LaBoeuf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'done', 'great', 'work', 'years', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'was', 'great', 'small', 'role', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper.The', 'script', 'new', 'film', 'huge', 'improvement', 'earlier', 'film', 'cinematography', 'also', 'significant', 'upgrade', 'location', 'shooting', 'novel', 'films', 'start', 'Fort', 'Smith', 'Arkansas', 'proceed', 'parts', 'eastern', 'Oklahoma', 'Henry', 'Hathaway', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Arkansas', 'Oklahoma', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Texas', 'New', 'Mexico', 'not', 'quite', 'like', 'northwest', 'Arkansas', 'Oklahoma', 'closer', 'Rocky', 'Mountains.By', 'restoring', 'balance', 'Rooster', 'Mattie', 'novel', 'movie', 'be', 'star', 'vehicle', 'lead', 'actor', 'instead', 'film', 'relationship', 'two', 'strong', 'personalities.In', 'short', 'are', 'lover', 'novel', 'film', 'finally', 'beautiful', 'book', 'justice.It', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'who', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'are', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'generation', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'outstanding', 'never', 'make', 'completely', 'uninteresting', 'movies', ""'d"", 'rank', 'there', 'RAISING', 'ARIZONA', 'THE', 'BIG', 'LEBOWSKI', 'NO', 'COUNTRY', 'FOR', 'OLD', 'MEN', 'one', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'next']",True Grit

1365967,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B003UESJME,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 13]","***1/2The Coen Brothers' remake of ""True Grit"" is drier, darker and considerably less ebullient than the 1969 original that won John Wayne his Oscar. Well, it's definitely ""grittier.""The Charles Portis novel on which both movies are based centers on Mattie Ross, a spunky, wise-beyond-her-years 14-year-old who hires the aging, drunken, one-eyed fat man, Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), to help her hunt down and capture the hired hand who murdered her father in cold blood. The two are joined in their endeavor by LaBoeuf, a Texas ranger (Matt Damon  replacing Glen Campbell) who has reasons of his own for wanting to see Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) brought to justice.The real charm of ""True Grit"" has always lain in several unique elements: the incongruity between the idealistic, inexperienced and indefatigable Mattie and the cynical brutality of the Old West setting; the quaintly amusing way in which the characters speak without the use of contractions; and the larger-than-life figure of Cogburn himself. In their stab at the material, the Coen Brothers get most of those elements right, though the movie may be a bit more emotionally detached, dawdling and long-winded than it needs to be at times. And although Bridges brings a great deal of humor and bluff to his interpretation of Cogburn, in his single-minded attempt to avoid simply duplicating Wayne's signature performance, he seems to have come dangerously close to channeling Karl from ""Sling Blade"" instead. Moreover, since much of Bridges' dialogue comes out garbled, the viewer often finds himself at a loss as to what exactly the man is saying, which makes it rather hard to follow the plot at times. Damon, who's been given some fairly impressive jowls for the occasion, has some of the same problem, though certainly not to the extent Bridges does.The real acting triumph comes in the form of a then-thirteen-year-old bundle of energy named Hailee Stenfeld, who far surpasses what a likable, but far less talented Kim Darby was able to do with the role. It is Stenfeld, with her indomitable spirit and letter-perfect diction, who becomes the true heart and soul of the picture.As with ""No Country for Old Men,"" the Coens once again demonstrate their eye for detail and their mastery of long-shot composition, brought to vivid life by the crystalline cinematography of Roger Deakins.  For ""True Grit"" is never anything less than gorgeous to look at.Perhaps it's pointless even to compare this version with the one from forty-plus years ago, since the Coen Brothers have gone out of their way to make it clear that they are not attempting a remake with their film. But one side-by-side scene analysis may be of some value here anyway. It is clearly the most familiar and fondly remembered moment from the earlier film, the one in which an aging, scowling, greatly outnumbered Wayne, all bulked-up and astride his horse, throws the reins into his mouth and, with a rifle discharging from each hand, rides straight towards the bad guys without a moment's hesitation. The reason it is such an iconic image is because it represents the visual culmination of Wayne's entire career as a movie cowboy hero. We laugh along at the audacious absurdity of the scene, yet can't help but be moved by its purity. Yet, when we see Bridges do the exact same thing, finely executed as the scene may be, it can't possibly have the same impact because we have no previous associations of Bridges to go along with it.Perhaps in keeping with the temper of the times, this ""True Grit"" is a more sober and serious (and faithful) adaptation of the Portis novel.

Having watched the original many times I wanted to see this remake with as much of an open mind as possable. I have not read the book so I make no comparison's to that work.I have to agree with the assesment that the original was a John Wayne playing John Wayne.  This new version was a darker version of the Cogburn charector. Bridges did a excellant job with his version. Waynes version made him seem a lovable alcohic while Bridges version made him more close to a realistic portrayal of a true alcoholic.( I am a recovering alcoholic hence the focus here.) I found both to be enjoyable based on the time each movie was made and the different audiance of today vs 1969 which is when I 1st saw the original. The weight of each version carries both movies well. Wayne lighter Bridges darker.Having just watched both versions back to back there is one point that I found that sets one movie slightly above the other. This would be the classic confrontation between Cogburn and Pepper.  I found the Wayne version of that scene to be more exciting and satisfying than the remake.  This is due to one simple prop. There was just something more captivating about John Wayne at that epic moment saying fill your hand you SOB while drawing his pistol and flipping the lever action of his winchester one handed that made the scene more riveting than JB and his 2 pistols. Hollywood hoopla maybe but what a scene. I felt it on a emotional level in the original, not so much in the remake.  Both versions are good I just enjoyed JW a little more.

However given a choice between 4 and 5 as my only two options I went with the higher rating.The first version of True Grit was almost totally focused on John Wayne's role as he had to carry that movie for the most part.  There was no doubt that he was the one with True Grit.  The role of the Texas ranger was not very well acted by Glen Campbell, but several of the character actors were quite good.  I would give the original 4  stars also, just based on Wayne's performance and the performance of some of the character actors like the judge, and the outlaws.In this second version Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) vies with Jeff Bridges for the person with True Grit.  She really steals the show much of the time with an outstanding performance.  Bridges interpretation of Rooster Cogburn was a little rougher and rawer than Wayne's, but Bridges does the role justice and with the aid of Hailee Steinfeld in the role of Mattie makes this a very good movie and just different enough to make it every bit as interesting as the original Wayne version.

1365971,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B003UESJME,R. Sardrena,"[0, 2]","The Coen Brothers' 2010 remake of the novel and film True Grit was yet another example of the film industry's aversion to risk.  Why try something new when one can simply remake a well-known commodity?  The industry's logic (we can no longer refer to it as ""Hollywood"") is to ""Keep doing it 'till you get it wrong.  And the new Grit is well-crafted and intentioned, but wrong. While not the putrid mess that Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho was, the new Grit also begs the question: Why?Since this film wouldn't have been made, save for the popularity of the John Wayne version, comparisons are fair and inevitable.  The new version suffers when measured against its predecessor.  I'm surprised to feel this, since I am not an admirer of John Wayne.  Moreover, Jeff Bridges has earned respect over the years, displaying versatility that his actor father and brother could never dream of.  Nevertheless, Wayne's performance was strong and affable, whereas Bridges' was strained and overly-affected.  He was like a stage actor drawing whispers from the audience that ""He's trying too hard.""Matt Damon, another actor who has brought many solid performances to the screen, is at his worst in this film.  The Bostonian simply has no idea how to play a Texan.  He was more at home portraying an Afrikaaner in ""Invictus"" than here.  It doesn't help that his costume is ridiculous; it looks like a tenderfoot maxed out his credit card at an LL Bean before going out on a camping trip.The new Grit's great strength is its ""Western Gothic"" visual style which has become the norm among modern genre productions.  Unfortunately, the Gothic look, with its nearly-colorless chiaroscuro style becomes tedious after awhile.  One longs for the rich fall colors of the earlier film.The Coen Brothers conceded in passing what many reviewers have not; that the new Grit has lost much of the humor of the novel - and by extension, the Wayne version.  Sensibilities have changed since the Sixties.  The original novel and film were built around snappy rapid-fire verbal fireworks.  The post-Seventies filmmaking style stresses pseudo-documentary touches that dismiss crisp dialogue.  The Coens - and their actors - simply are unequipped to fully appreciate and adapt the crisp dialogue of the original to their sensibilities.  The new Grit's version of the famous horse-trading scene is the best case in point; whereas the original film brought a smile to the audience through Strother Martin's increasingly flustered delivery, the remake seems like a tedious waste of time.The new Grit's Maddie also suffers in comparison to the original film's Kim Darby. Though perhaps the new performer is more age-appropriate, she is tone-deaf to the character's peculiar personality.  She may adequately portray pluckiness, but lacks the precocious horse-sense required of the part.As the villainous ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper, a young Robert Duvall showed great presence in the original film, whereas in the remake, the actor merely mouths his lines in a rushed delivery that shows he doesn't feel up to the task.  It is a small but important part, and requires a strong actor to carry it.Only in the final scene is the remake in its element.  Its bleak, nihilistic denoument fits modern Westerns well, and would have been unwelcome in the Wayne version.  But in the end, the new Grit is a successful film because the Coen's flaws are the modern audience's flaws, and match them well.Sigh.",2,Why Remake Grit?,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,3448,"['Coen', 'Brothers', '2010', 'remake', 'novel', 'film', 'True', 'Grit', 'was', 'yet', 'example', 'film', 'industry', 'aversion', 'risk', 'Why', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'simply', 'remake', 'well-known', 'commodity', 'industry', 'logic', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'refer', 'Hollywood', 'Keep', 'doing', ""'till"", 'get', 'wrong', 'new', 'Grit', 'well-crafted', 'intentioned', 'wrong', 'not', 'putrid', 'mess', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'remake', 'Psycho', 'was', 'new', 'Grit', 'also', 'question', 'Why', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'save', 'popularity', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', 'comparisons', 'are', 'fair', 'inevitable', 'new', 'version', 'suffers', 'when', 'measured', 'predecessor', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'feel', 'am', 'not', 'admirer', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Moreover', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'earned', 'respect', 'years', 'displaying', 'versatility', 'actor', 'father', 'brother', 'could', 'never', 'dream', 'Nevertheless', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'was', 'strong', 'affable', 'whereas', 'Bridges', 'was', 'strained', 'overly-affected', 'was', 'stage', 'actor', 'drawing', 'whispers', 'audience', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'actor', 'who', 'brought', 'many', 'solid', 'performances', 'screen', 'worst', 'film', 'Bostonian', 'simply', 'idea', 'how', 'play', 'Texan', 'was', 'more', 'home', 'portraying', 'Afrikaaner', 'Invictus', 'here', ""n't"", 'help', 'costume', 'ridiculous', 'tenderfoot', 'maxed', 'out', 'credit', 'card', 'LL', 'Bean', 'going', 'out', 'camping', 'trip.The', 'new', 'Grit', 'great', 'strength', 'Western', 'Gothic', 'visual', 'style', 'become', 'norm', 'modern', 'genre', 'productions', 'Unfortunately', 'Gothic', 'look', 'nearly-colorless', 'chiaroscuro', 'style', 'tedious', 'awhile', 'One', 'longs', 'rich', 'fall', 'colors', 'earlier', 'film.The', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'conceded', 'passing', 'what', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'not', 'new', 'Grit', 'lost', 'much', 'humor', 'novel', 'extension', 'Wayne', 'version', 'Sensibilities', 'have', 'changed', 'Sixties', 'original', 'novel', 'film', 'were', 'built', 'snappy', 'rapid-fire', 'verbal', 'fireworks', 'post-Seventies', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'pseudo-documentary', 'touches', 'dismiss', 'crisp', 'dialogue', 'Coens', 'actors', 'simply', 'are', 'unequipped', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'adapt', 'crisp', 'dialogue', 'original', 'sensibilities', 'new', 'Grit', 'version', 'famous', 'horse-trading', 'scene', 'best', 'case', 'point', 'original', 'film', 'brought', 'smile', 'audience', 'Strother', 'Martin', 'increasingly', 'flustered', 'delivery', 'remake', 'tedious', 'waste', 'time.The', 'new', 'Grit', 'Maddie', 'also', 'comparison', 'original', 'film', 'Kim', 'Darby', 'perhaps', 'new', 'performer', 'more', 'age-appropriate', 'tone-deaf', 'character', 'peculiar', 'personality', 'may', 'adequately', 'portray', 'pluckiness', 'precocious', 'horse-sense', 'required', 'part.As', 'villainous', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'young', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'showed', 'great', 'presence', 'original', 'film', 'whereas', 'remake', 'actor', 'merely', 'mouths', 'lines', 'rushed', 'delivery', ""n't"", 'feel', 'up', 'task', 'small', 'important', 'part', 'strong', 'actor', 'carry', 'it.Only', 'final', 'scene', 'remake', 'element', 'bleak', 'nihilistic', 'denoument', 'fits', 'modern', 'Westerns', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unwelcome', 'Wayne', 'version', 'end', 'new', 'Grit', 'successful', 'film', 'Coen', 'flaws', 'are', 'modern', 'audience', 'flaws', 'match', 'well.Sigh']",True Grit

1365977,A6FIAB28IS79,B003UESJME,Samuel Chell,"[2, 4]","The latest ""True Grit"" is a worthy film, possibly even a great one. But it's time for a closer assessment of the film as well as the common practice of movie remakes, which are popular with movie producers primarily because of a ""guaranteed"" box office draw.  In taking on the remake of ""True Grit"" the Coen Brothers might be expected to adhere, albeit it with creative flare, to the original story.  A radical make-over would seem especially ill-suited to this film for a number of reasons. Perhaps above all, its Dukish screen icon and ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" co-star, Glen Campbell, are sufficiently ensconced in public memory to make a barely recognizable ""True Grit"" seem disrespectful if not offensive.  Doing a remake of ""True Grit"" that is more a display of originality than a sincere adaptation would strike critics and public alike as intellectually and artistically dishonest.At the same time, if the goal was faithful adherence to the original, there are far safer bets than the Coen Brothers.  The history of these filmmakers includes the off-beat black comedy ""Fargo"" and, more recently, ""That Is No Country for Old Men,"" a film closer to the existential, thought-provoking cinema of Ingmar Bergman than to conventional Hollywood entertainment.  Moreover, the original ""True Grit"" had certain elements that by today's standards might be considered sentimental, formulaic, or Disney-esque--i.e. ""dated,"" out-of-step with a new millennium along with its impatient and jaded consumers in a post-modern, digitalized mediascape.  Among today's directors the Coen Brothers, moreover, have established the expectation of making films that are ""off-beat,"" unconventional, utterly unique.  As a result, I was prepared for a wholesale remodeling, a barely recognizable approximation, of the original movie, which attained semi-classic stature primarily because it was Duke's last hurrah.So what approach did the Coen Brothers take?  Remarkably, they elected NOT to play a clever, strikingly original hand with a test-proven, practically archetypal, property such as the one given them.  Viewers can pick up either of the two ""True Grits"" without fear of being misled into distortions of the literary source.  The viewer can just as readily watch both ""True Grits"" in succession and come out the wiser about the challenges facing the makers of remakes of popular films.To begin with, it's critical to take note of how the Coens' script has pointed the viewer to the literary source, using the point of view (POV) of the daughter (Mattie), who is determined to avenge the killing of her father.  Moreover, the Coens have, to a degree considerably greater than the original, lifted  language directly from the literary source, even to the point of testing the credulity of a modern-day audience that is at once more deficient in language skills and ever more convinced that theirs is the exceptionally ""gifted child.""  Those who marvel at the scenery and score of the remake may forget too easily that the original version directed by Henry Hathaway was almost as mindful of its Western spaces (though neither version so completely captures the nature surrounding the quest for revenge as John Ford's ""The Searchers"") and of the importance of ""expanding"" the uncharted territory with a full-blown symphonic orchestration.  But the primary differences to story and plot, or to script, apart from the aforementioned are in a more graphic and shocking attention to detail, thanks to the use of more ""shock"" edits as well as a more dynamic, intrusive (at times jolting) sound-track.  The effect is to make the world of the hunted and the hunter as much a  part of the spectator's world as the wastelands of ""That Is No Country for Old Men"" or the frozen tundra of ""Fargo.""  There is no escaping the world of nature, however merciless, cold-blooded, and life-threatening it can be to all of us who, as mortal beings, necessarily share in its destiny.Apart from the absence of John Wayne, the most obvious difference in characterization for many spectators is likely to be in the character of Mattie.  In the original version Kim Darby's Mattie is determined but at the same time a trifle awkward, or ""boyish,"" rather than precocious; she was a transplant from a Disney film about a tomboyish young girl intent upon showing her meddle.  In the remake Mattie is none of these things: rather, Halle Steinfeld's Mattie is a precocious, extraordinary articulate and intelligent 14-year-old feminist!  The question of her age and even gender are beside the point from the opening scene.  Her command of jurisprudence jargon and latin, her unhalting and complex verbal syntax, her keen intelligence and control of language are so complete and advanced as to tax the viewer's credulity (in fact, our suspension of disbelief is saved only by the reminder that that what we're witnessing is the account through the experienced perspective of the adult Mattie).Matt Damon's LaBoeuf is quite obviously a more experienced screen actor than the role as played by country and western popular music star Glenn Campbell.  At the same time, Campbell's bumbling ways may seem more appropriate to the tenderfoot status that he occupies in the original film, in which he attains some redeeming maturity just prior to his death.  In the remake, Matt Damon's La Boeuf is able to provide a more capable and credible foil to Jeff Bridges' crustiness.  His strength might be seen as another device employed by the Coens to replace the original's most irreplaceable element, i.e., John Wayne.  For the same reason, the remake counterbalances Rooster Cogburn with a more formidable and believable antagonist.  Tom Chaney in the original is little more than a faceless, soon-forgotten villain, completely overwhelmed by the John Wayne protagonist that occupies our attention during and long after the movie.  The role as played by Josh Brolin's bad guy in the remake is one we take more seriously, especially given our familiarity with the actor in films like ""That Is No Country.""  The emphasis he receives is yet another answer to the overwhelming, indomitable presence of Wayne's Rooster Cogburn in the original.The signature of a genuine auteur, as Andre Bazin and his followers argued, is not a film director who has complete control of his project along with the liberties of expressing himself as he chooses.  Alfred Hitchock was the most admired director of the influential French film theorists because he left his personal stamp on each of his films in spite of the commercial, profit-making priority expected of him in each instance.  There's a trademark tone, a consistency, a thematic purpose, or worldview, that becomes apparent in every Hitchcock film, even to a viewer who at the outset is unfamiliar with the director.And here's where the Coen brothers have excelled.  Rather than taking a radically different, bold or quirky approach, they've stayed within the rules and, in spite of long odds, achieved a cinematic triumph that is consonant with the themes of their less formulaic films.  In the beginning of the film the stakes are made clear by the voiceover. As mortal beings we are accountable for our past actions, each of which will have consequences from which we can't hide.  In the end there is no concealing our offenses against society, nature or God; there is no escape or freedom; mortality in itself is at once inescapable, beautiful, and deadly.  Despite our wishes to the contrary, as Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff reminds us at the end of ""That Is No Country,"" there is no ultimate justice, no ""deus ex machine"" that will, at some climactic moment in our lives, rescue us from the final encounter against which, as Dylan Thomas reminds us, all mortals have no more than two options: 1. wearing blinders and cowering in fear; or 2. singing in our chains while raging against the dying of the light.In the original ""True Grit,"" spectators had, prior to attending the film or shortly afterward, knowledge that the film was elegy as much as saga. Wayne's mythic character would not spare him from the cancer he was already fighting. It was in fact our knowledge of that ""human flaw"" that made the title ""True Grit"" stand not simply for the ""exceptional"" man but the ""universal"" one. Much as we hate to admit it, all of us in search of a dramatic rescue or, seeking escapist entertainment in movies, must confront the fact of our mortal existence. Better it be with eyes open and a healthy appreciation of life's bounties than the whimper of a cowardly lion. For some, there may be the consolations offered by religion, but neither the original story nor the Coen brothers' movie goes there. The church, to the extent that it is even visible in a Coen Brothers' movie, is presented as ineffectual, deluded and hypocritical.In place of salvation lying outside the camera lens is an unflinching representation of the only life that the camera along with human consciousness can know. If it's not enough, it's more than most filmmakers have been able to offer. The Coen Brothers reveal what will be required of each of us at the conclusion of life's journey: the truest grit of all.",5,The Coens as gritty as ever.,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,9168,"['latest',

1365981,A3HZ2D336K7QSY,B003UESJME,"Scott Martin Gavin ""yukicat1""","[16, 24]","Although I missed the 1969 version of True Grit in the theater (due to boycotting John Wayne over his very public political stance on the Vietnam War) the movie is a perennial favorite. I was prepared not to like the new version but thought I would give it a chance. And, I must say that the Coen Brother's version of the movie did not disappoint. I actually liked this movie better than the 1969 version, though both have their strong points and weak points.The 2010 movie is, first of all, not a remake of the 1969 movie, in fact, there is no comparison between the two. The strong points of the new version is that it is much more faithful to the original novel than the 1969 film. In fact, most of the dialog is taken right out of the novel. The 2011 movie also avoids the 1969 movie's two dreadful casting errors (the first being Glen Campbell - as an actor he is a fine singer. He should have stuck to his trade - and the second mistake was casting a 22-year old Kim Darby as a 14-year old girl). Mat Damon made an excellent LaBoef, though his role is cut down significantly from the novel and the movie. And Hailee Steinfeld is wonderful (and age appropriate) in the role of Mattie Ross.The strong points of the 1969 movie version was, of course, John Wayne, and also the wonderful cast of character actors filling the roles of Colonel Stonehill, Tom Chaney and Lucky Ned Pepper. Their performances were so iconic I doubted anybody else could fill their shoes. John Wayne was always under-rated by the critics (undeservedly so) as a comedic actor and he shines as Rooster Cogburn and plays him as a parody of the iconic movie image he had built his career upon.The actors in the 2010 version did not attempt to imitate these classic performances, for which I am profoundly grateful. The new actors made the roles their own. Jeff Bridges is not the Rooster we grew up watching, but his performance is a lot closer to the Rooster Cogburn in the novel. Who KNEW that Jeff Bridges could actually ACT? Miss Steinfeld played the role of Mattie ""right down to the ground"" - as a sassy, abrasive, know-it-all young teenager and not with the fake wide-eyed wonderment that Kim Darby brought to the role (I was never quite sure if this was acting on Miss Darby's part or if she was just in awe at being in a movie with John Wayne).The music in the new film is beautiful (though some of the hymns the sound track is based on were from the late 1880s and not the late 1860s, during which period the movie was set) and Iris McDemit's ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" is beautiful and haunting. The Texas scenery is much more appropriate to Arkansas than the Colorado scenery the 1969 movie was shot in. Sorry, folks, but there just ain't any part of Arkansas that looks like the Rockies.That said, the new movie is not a perfect film. First, it's significantly shorter than the original, and some vital scenes are missing. The most glaring omission was the whole first chapter of the novel, where, in the 1969 film, we see Frank Ross and family at home, before he sets out on his shopping trip to Fort Smith. I'd have much rather that this scene had been included in the film instead of the Bear Man scene, which the Coen Brothers made up out of whole cloth and isn't in the novel. Also, the journey through the Indian Territory is so fast paced it seems to only take a day or two for Rooster and Mattie to run Lucky Ned Pepper's gang to ground, instead of the weeks it seemed to take in the original film. Most of the quest for Tom Chaney is simply passed over. The ending of the new film is different, too, and though many other reviewers complained about this, the new ending is taken directly from the novel almost word for word. Evidently Henry Hathaway thought that 1969 audiences wouldn't accept such a melancholy ending and so made up a happier ending. I liked the happier ending, but the new ending is more faithful to the book.That said, I feel I must close by taking the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to task. If the 1969 movie (and John Wayne) deserved an Oscar, then the 2010 version - which in my opinion is a better film and more faithful to the original book - also deserved a few Oscars. Jeff Bridges deserved one for his interpretation of Rooster Cogburn, as did Hailee Steinfeld. That neither won an Oscar is almost a crime (though it should be noted that the Academy routinely disrespects both Sci-Fi movies and Westerns, no matter how excellent they may be). I'd much rather watch ""True Grit"" again than some movie about a stuttering King. It's also shameful that the Academy didn't even consider Carter Burwell's soundtrack, dismissing it as ""derivative"" (Which is akin to saying that Aaron Copeland's ""Appalacian Spring"" and ""Rodeo"" aren't classical music because he reused traditional music in the score). Mr. Burwell took two or three traditional hymns and wove them into a symphony that evokes the full range of emotions, from wide-eyed wonder to abject terror and everything in between. The music from the film stands up on its own, a sure sign of a good musical score.I am still very fond of the John Wayne version, even though it was written as a vehicle for John Wayne and thus strays far and wide from the novel. The new movie, however, is both a worth successor to the 1969 film, and also an improvement upon it. Both movies deserve space on any Western fan's movie shelf.",5,"They was robbed, I tell you, robbed!",1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,5413,"['missed', '1969', 'version', 'True', 'Grit', 'theater', 'due',

1365982,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B003UESJME,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 4]","Chalk me up as one who was puzzled at the idea of Joel and Ethan Coen ""stooping"" to do a remake of another movie - especially a semi-classic John Wayne Western.  A remake is already pedestrian - if they had remade something edgy like Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" or Hitchcock's ""Notorious,"" I might not have been surprised, but a John Wayne film (other than perhaps ""The Searchers"")?  What is going on here?I shouldn't have doubted these guys, who have added another gem to their filmography.  ""True Grit,"" it has been said, is less a remake than a reimagining, and I think that is fair.  This movie is both darker and more spiritual than the John Wayne version.  An opening shot of snow gently falling on a dead body lying in the street sets an elegiac tone that is maintained throughout - thanks in large part to the masterful score by Carter Burwell.  The movie both pays homage to the dangerous world of the Old West and, like ""Unforgiven,"" reminds us that many of the heroes of our history were nasty cusses just like the villains.Hallie Steinfeld nearly steals the movie from everyone else with her performance as Mattie Ross, a fourteen year old girl who travels to the frontier to avenge her father's murder and put his affairs to right.  This is the most unnervingly perfect performance by a young lady since Natalie Portman's turn in ""Beautiful Girls.""  Mattie Ross may be fourteen, but she is often the smartest person in the room and always the most determined.  This is a gal who can stand up to murderers and thieves.It's good that she can, because that's who she runs into.  Even the good guys - Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) - are not above lying or thrashing a child when it suits them.  Bridges and Damon make a good pair - Bridges plays Cogburn as a perpetually half-buzzed killer who's only on the side of the law because it pays regular, and Damon's LaBoeuf is only a Texas Ranger because it allows him to say he's a Texas Ranger.  Both men can kill and kill well.The rest of the cast, including Josh Brolin as the murderous Tom Chaney and Barry Pepper as the ill-fated Lucky Ned Pepper, does fine work in their supporting roles.  Pepper in particular seems born to play a Western villain - he dirties up good.  It's only the limited screen time that keeps these guys in their roles as supporting players.There's a lot of discussion these days about the Coen Brothers' filmography and where various movies rank on that list.  For what it's worth, my personal favorite is ""Miller's Crossing.""  But all those lists are ultimately irrelevant as the Coens consistently make first rate movies - it's fun to see that, with the exception of ""The Ladykillers,"" pretty much every one of their movies is somebody's ""favorite Coen Brothers' film.""  ""True Grit"" deserves to be at the top of several of those lists.",5,An elegiac Western given life by Coens and stellar cast,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,2872,"['Chalk', 'up', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'puzzled', 'idea', 'Joel', 'Ethan', 'Coen', 'stooping', 'do', 'remake', 'movie', 'especially', 'semi-classic', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Western', 'remake', 'already', 'pedestrian', 'had', 'remade', 'something', 'edgy', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'Hitchcock', 'Notorious', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'other', 'perhaps', 'Searchers', 'What', 'going', 'here', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'doubted', 'guys', 'who', 'have', 'added', 'gem', 'filmography', 'True', 'Grit', 'been', 'said', 'less', 'remake', 'reimagining', 'think', 'fair', 'movie', 'darker', 'more', 'spiritual', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', 'opening', 'shot', 'snow', 'gently', 'falling', 'dead', 'body', 'lying', 'street', 'elegiac', 'tone', 'maintained', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'masterful', 'score', 'Carter', 'Burwell', 'movie', 'pays', 'homage', 'dangerous', 'world', 'Old', 'West', 'Unforgiven', 'many', 'heroes', 'history', 'were', 'nasty', 'cusses', 'just', 'villains.Hallie', 'Steinfeld', 'nearly', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'performance', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'frontier', 'avenge', 'father', 'murder', 'put', 'affairs', 'right', 'most', 'unnervingly', 'perfect', 'performance', 'young', 'lady', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'turn', 'Beautiful', 'Girls', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'may', 'be', 'fourteen', 'often', 'smartest', 'person', 'room', 'always', 'most', 'determined', 'gal', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'murderers', 'thieves.It', 'good', 'can', 'who', 'Even', 'good', 'guys', 'Marshall', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'LaBoeuf', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'are', 'not', 'lying', 'thrashing', 'child', 'when', 'suits', 'Bridges', 'Damon', 'make', 'good', 'pair', 'Bridges', 'Cogburn', 'perpetually', 'half-buzzed', 'killer', 'who', 'only', 'side', 'law', 'regular', 'Damon', 'LaBoeuf', 'only', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'say', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'men', 'can', 'kill', 'kill', 'well.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'murderous', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'Barry', 'Pepper', 'ill-fated', 'Lucky', 'Ned', 'Pepper', 'fine', 'work', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Pepper', 'particular', 'born', 'play', 'Western', 'villain', 'up', 'good', 'only', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'guys', 'roles', 'supporting', 'lot', 'discussion', 'days', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'filmography', 'where', 'various', 'movies', 'rank', 'list', 'what', 'worth', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'lists', 'are', 'ultimately', 'irrelevant', 'Coens', 'consistently', 'make', 'first', 'rate', 'movies', 'fun', 'see', 'exception', 'Ladykillers', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'movies', 'somebody', 'favorite', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', 'True', 'Grit', 'be', 'top', 'several', 'lists']",True Grit

1365985,A18IK6YI6T3RK2,B003UESJME,Shannon Deason,"[2, 4]","I came to this movie expecting quite a lot.  Look, it got all those nominations (tho didn't win one) and it's a Coen Bros. production.  Frankly, I came away disappointed.  The film is beautifully shot of course and the period setting is done with an eye for authenticity.  First, let me say, I thought Jeff Bridges was great as Rooster, although I had to use subtitles to understand what a word he uttered.  I also liked Damon, in a real departure from his usual characters, he had the unenviable task of having to show romantic feelings for an uh, 14 year old (even though in fairness she acted like a 40 year old).  Now comes the problem for me, the girl playing the lead.  First of all, from the beginning she speaks like a law clerk for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, second, even when faced with people getting mutalated and a kid relatively her age getting his fingers chopped off and dying right in front of her, she is still quoting legalese and acting like a 30 year old vet after 3 tours in Nam', no post truamatic stress for this kid, oh no!  We really never see her truly frightened or shaken, look, here is a 14 year old, whose father has just been murdered and she's marching around like an petulent cyborg, with a Harvard Law Degree, with not ounce of fright or worry, and even when she's captured by some crazy rednecks, all she's worried about is what's for supper, and haranging them about the law, like she's auditioning for the lead in The Lincoln Lawyer, not worrying about being savagely assaulted, or worse, no, she worried about what kind of beans they're going to serve her!  Here she is a female child in the old west at the mercy of crazy male rednecks and she's sitting at the camp fire asking about the fish of the day!  Not to mention, I just didn't care for her period, she seemed like such a know it all, Pratt, who needed a real reality check.  I also wasn't crazy about the end, it seemed anti-climatic, and the actress who playes the adult lead, is severe to say the least.  Overall, I recommend this because it's a Coen film and for Jeff Bridges great turn as Rooster, as for the kid, I have no idea how she got a nomination for this, much less was an early favorite..as perplexing as her odd performance, she must have Harvey Weinstein as her agent.",3,GRITTY,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,2295,"['came', 'movie', 'expecting', 'quite', 'lot', 'Look', 'got', 'nominations', 'tho', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'one', 'Coen', 'Bros.', 'production', 'Frankly', 'came', 'away', 'disappointed', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'course', 'period', 'setting', 'done', 'eye', 'authenticity', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'thought', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'great', 'Rooster', 'had', 'use', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'what', 'word', 'uttered', 'also', 'liked', 'Damon', 'real', 'departure', 'usual', 'characters', 'had', 'unenviable', 'task', 'having', 'show', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'uh', '14', 'year', 'old', 'even', 'fairness', 'acted', '40', 'year', 'old', 'Now', 'problem', 'girl', 'playing', 'lead', 'First', 'all', 'beginning', 'law', 'clerk', 'Chief', 'Justice', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'second', 'even', 'when', 'faced', 'people', 'getting', 'mutalated', 'kid', 'relatively', 'age', 'getting', 'fingers', 'chopped', 'off', 'dying', 'right', 'front', 'her', 'still', 'quoting', 'legalese', 'acting', '30', 'year', 'old', 'vet', '3', 'tours', 'Nam', 'post', 'truamatic', 'stress', 'kid', 'really', 'never', 'see', 'truly', 'frightened', 'shaken', 'look', 'here', '14', 'year', 'old', 'father', 'just', 'been', 'murdered', 'marching', 'around', 'petulent', 'cyborg', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'Degree', 'not', 'ounce', 'fright', 'worry', 'even', 'when', 'captured', 'crazy', 'rednecks', 'worried', 'what', 'supper', 'haranging', 'law', 'auditioning', 'lead', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'not', 'worrying', 'being', 'savagely', 'assaulted', 'worse', 'worried', 'what', 'kind', 'beans', ""'re"", 'going', 'serve', 'Here', 'female', 'child', 'old', 'west', 'mercy', 'crazy', 'male', 'rednecks', 'sitting', 'camp', 'fire', 'asking', 'fish', 'day', 'Not', 'mention', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'period', 'seemed', 'such', 'know', 'Pratt', 'who', 'needed', 'real', 'reality', 'check', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'end', 'seemed', 'anti-climatic', 'actress', 'who', 'adult', 'lead', 'severe', 'say', 'least', 'Overall', 'recommend', 'Coen', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'great', 'turn', 'Rooster', 'kid', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'got', 'nomination', 'much', 'less', 'was', 'early', 'favorite..as', 'perplexing', 'odd', 'performance', 'must', 'have', 'Harvey', 'Weinstein', 'agent']",True Grit

So with the preconceived notion that I was going to hate the movie I bought my ticket, popcorn, and soda and entered the theater fully prepared to spend a miserable 2 hours and 8 minutes watching a vastly inferior adaptation of the novelTrue Gritby Charles Portis. However, and I say this full well eating my own hat, I was surprisingly disappointed in my preconceived notion that this would be a horrible movie. In fact, it was quite the opposite. I fully enjoyed this movie and the acting was nothing short of superb, from the legendary Jeff Bridges to the surprising actor, who I will not name here, that plays the role of Lucky Ned Pepper who was originally and brilliantly played by Robert Duval.So how long did it take me to start enjoying this movie? All of about maybe 5 minutes, and that would be stretching it quite a bit, and that is solely due to the wonderful actress that played Mattie Ross. She really and truly did an outstanding job and you quite easily believed that she was on a quest to track down and bring to justice the cowardly killer Tom Chaney, who had killed her father.The cinematography was fantastic and the story itself more closely followed the book than the John Wayne original, which by the way is still my favorite and always will be, although I fully intend to purchase this adaptation as soon as it becomes available on DVD. The Coen brothers certainly deserve well earned praise for their vision of this American classic and if anything it pays homage to the original while at the same time being true to the book and their own take on the story.Although Jeff Bridges sure makes a believable Rooster J. Cogburn, the one line uttered in this movie, that is perhaps one of the greatest lines ever uttered in a John Wayne movie or any other for that matter, just didn't seem to have the same tone and inflection that the original had. Which line am I referring too? Well I don't want to spoil it for you here, but I will give you a hint, it is the line uttered in response to Lucky Ned Pepper's observation about Rooster's handicap and the fact that he was a bit overweight.So was there anything missing from this remake? Sadly yes, and I will spoil that for you here by stating that not once did I see a pivotal character from the original film and that was General Sterling Price who for those of you that don't remember, was Rooster's orange striped tabby cat.So in closing this review of a remake that you really should see because if you don't, the only response I have to that is...""Fill your hands you son-of-a_____!""Shawn Kovacich100% John Wayne FanCreator of numerous books and DVD's.",5,"It's Not John Wayne, but...

1365988,AHJK8Y7IG1RSE,B003UESJME,Sheepy,"[0, 5]","The Coen Brothers have made it clear that they are not remaking the classic Wayne film and are trying to stay more true to the book.  Other than the ending, that could not be anymore false.  Watching the two films, it is very clear that the Coen brothers have watched the John Wayne film over and over again.All you have to do is look at particular scenes side-by-side.  So many of the same camera angles are used.  The spacial conformations of the characters are all too frequently close to the same.  The final fight between Cogburn and and Ned Pepper and his flunkies could basically be laid right on top of each other in dialogue and camera angles.  There are many many scenes in the Coen film that can basically be laid right on top of the Wayne film camera angles.  It is clearly inspired by the Wayne classic and it is far more likened to a remake rather than the claim that the novel was the big inspiration.  You may say they were more true to the ending, which is true, but there were other inserted scenes by the Coen brothers that are not in the novel.Another thing to make very clear is that the novel never states that Cogburn wore an eyepatch.  So you're really telling me they wanted to stay more true to the novel rather than the Wayne classic?  This thing screams Wayne inspiration all over it.So that aside, what about the film itself separated from the silly claim that they were inspired by the novel more than the Wayne film?  The actors are pretty good.  Bridges is really fun, except for hardly being able to understand him.  It is really hard to stomach his ""fill your hand you sonuvab*tch"" I didn't like it all the much.  No comparison to Wayne, it felt way too out of character and forced.If you have seen the original film starring John Wayne, you have already no doubt seen all the clearly inspired camera angles and spaces.

The scene where he tells the girl about &#34;taking the reins in my teeth&#34; and charging a whole posse is a whole lot more believable from John Wayne. He gets excited telling the story. Jeff Bridges just sounds like he's reading a cue-card.

No matter how different the update is from the source material, there's nothing wrong with this as long as the updated version tells a great story, is well acted and holds the viewers interest. Having never seen the original True Grit, I can't comment on how different 2010's True Grit is compared to the original. I can say that 2010's True Grit was indeed a great story; it was indeed well acted; and it did indeed more than hold my interest...so much so that I am still thinking about how great the movie is days after watching it.Similar to the theme ofUnforgiven, the story chronicles the hiring of an old cowboy named Rooster Cogburn to seek out and kill a villain. Jeff Bridges is Cogburn and the hiring is done by 14 year old Mattie Ross played by 14 year old Hailee Steinfeld. Matt Damon joins the hunt and the movie is mostly a 3 person show between these 3 fine actors until they catch up later with villain Josh Brolin.Steinfeld really steals the show with her precocious, intelligent banter with various characters, but mostly her barbs with Bridges and Damon. The Coen brothers keep the movie movie along at quick pace and keep the interest level and suspense factors high from start to finish. So much so that, knowing in advance that the movie run-time was under 2 hours, I was disappointed at the 90 minute mark to realize the movie would soon end.So I'd highly recommend catching this movie, but don't expect John Wayne.

1365999,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B003UESJME,Spider Monkey,"[1, 1]","I have to start by saying `True Grit' is another excellent film from the Coen brothers.  Some of their films can miss the mark, but when they get it right they hit the target dead on and with full force.This film follows a 14 year old girl called Mattie as she goes about finding the man who murdered her father.  She is quick thinking, highly intelligent and full of sass.  She hires the grizzly old Rooster Cogburn (played by Bridges) to help her in her endeavours and together they make an unlikely, but effective duo.  There are also interactions with a Texas Ranger (played by Matt Damon) and gun fights and horse chases a-plenty.The dialogue in this film is excellent and some of the lines Mattie and Cogburn come out with will have you roaring with laughter and appreciative of their eloquence.  This film has quite a gentle pace and yet this is juxtaposed with the odd gun fight which adds the needed spark to the film.Everyone acts very well in this and I adore the accents of all involved.  Damon is great as the self righteous Texas Ranger and Bridges is simply wonderful as the time worn and hardened Cogburn.  I haven't seen Hailee Steinfeld, the actress who plays Mattie,  act in a film before, but I have to say I was highly impressed.  The direction is superb, with plenty of artistic shots of the wide landscapes that will leave you breathless and the gun fights and scenes with drama and action are tight and full of excitement.Overall I have to say I enjoyed this more than I anticipated I would and it made for just under 2 hours highly entertaining viewing.

Jeff Bridges was unlikely to win after finally being recognized a year ago, but Roger Deakins (cinematography) and Hailee Steinfeld (supporting actress) were particularly unlucky to lose.I'm generally not in favor of watching remakes, or Westerns, but this one is worth it. The Coens don't make bad films. The acting is superb and there's just the right balance between action, drama and humor.The story is narrated and told from the viewpoint of Mattie Ross (Steinfeld), a 14-year-old girl who wants to hire someone to catch the man who killed her father. After hearing the qualities of the potential candidates, she approaches Rooster Cogburn (Bridges). He's a one-eyed drunk with a reputation for getting the job done. Perhaps she wanted someone with the same strength of character as her own?One of the best scenes in the movie comes early. Mattie argues with a horse trader, wanting compensation for a horse of her father's stolen while under the trader's care, as well as a refund for four ponies her father bought. This is where we see that Mattie, although young, is intelligent and capable of looking after her interests. The trader meets most of her demands and is relieved to see her leave.Cogburn's character is revealed when he gives evidence in court. It's clear that he'll kill if necessary, and that he thinks it's often necessary. After another negotiation, Mattie secures his services to search for Tom Chaney (Brolin), her father's killer.The other main character is LaBoeuf (Damon), a Texas Ranger who has been tracking Chaney for another crime. He wants to team up with Cogburn as both have the same goal, but they are unable to convince Mattie to stay behind and the trio end up together.The dialogue doesn't follow that of traditional Westerns. The characters are generally well-spoken and intelligent and don't use contractions. This has the effect of making the dialogue sound formal and more important. Some of the accents are thick, but you'll soon get used to it.After an argument with Cogburn, LaBoeuf departs and leaves Cogburn and Mattie to fend for themselves. They look for shelter and find a shack occupied by two men. Cogburn finds out some valuable information to aid the search and learns that Chaney has joined a gang which is due to arrive at the shack. Cogburn and Mattie hide and wait for them to show up.LaBoeuf later rejoins the pair and the main action occurs when the trio meets the gang. Mattie proves her worth and both Cogburn and LaBoeuf have important parts to play in the conflict. Cogburn is not always drunk and proves very capable when the situation calls for it.While not as quirky as other Coen films, True Grit contains plenty of humor. The dialogue is fast and the wits of the main characters are sharp. Each has some memorable lines. There isn't a huge amount of action. It's more about the setup and the dynamic between the trio. We see more of the journey than the eventual confrontation. It has the effect of making the story well-rounded and there's enough background information for us to feel like we know the characters by the end of the movie.The conclusion jumps forward 25 years and we are shown what happens to the characters. It's a good way to end the story.Video Quality 5/5The Texas and New Mexico locations look stunning in this presentation and colors are bright and well-defined. Fine detail is exceptional and you can clearly pick out patterns in the dirt and see individual pieces of straw. Grain is barely visible in the majority of scenes, but there's no loss of detail. Paramount has delivered a wonderful transfer and I can't think of a better-looking live action movie.Audio Quality 5/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track also shines. Whether it's horses galloping, insects, wind or gunfire, everything sounds the way it should. What really impresses me is the depth of sound in quieter scenes. There is so much detail. The excellent dialogue is well-defined and there's nothing to fault in the audio presentation.Special Features 3/5There are just over an hour of additional features on the release and all are in full HD:Mattie's True Grit (5:13) - Telling the story of Steinfeld's audition, her preparation for the role and working with the Coen brothers.From Bustles to Buckskin - Dressing for the 1880s (8:02) - Interviews with the costume designer and some of the cast.Colts, Winchesters & Remingtons: The Guns of a Post-Civil War Western (4:41) - Explaining the choice of guns used by the main trio.Re-Creating Fort Smith (11:20) - Showing how the set was put together.The Cast (5:25) - Interviews with Bridges, Damon, Steinfeld, Brolin and Barry Pepper.Charles Portis - The Greatest Writer You've Never Heard Of (30:54) - An extensive look at the career of writer Charles Portis.Cinematography (2:57) - Roger Deakins talks about some of the shots in the movie.Trailer (2:33)There should be an Oscar for best Blu-ray presentation. True Grit would certainly be nominated. If you're a fan of the film, you'll be delighted with the whole package. The crew researched the time period thoroughly and the result feels authentic. I would recommend this even if you're not a fan of the genre.Overall score 4.5/5",5,A remake worth seeing,1307059200,"06 3, 2011",2011,5773,"['True', 'Grit', 'western', 'drama', 'adventure',

(The 1969 film shot in the Colorado Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, while the 2010 film was shot in Santa Fe, New Mexico as well as Granger, and Austin, Texas.)The novel's narrator is Mattie, which got totally lost in the original.She has the ""true grit""of the Old Testament and she finds it matched by Rooster Cogburn's more worldly,lethal ""true grit"".Mattie like a religious Huck Finn goes forth into a pit of hell full of blood and rattlesnakes to gain vengeance on the man,Tom Chaney, who killed and robbed her father.Mattie(Hailee Stenfield)losing her innocence has to pay a high price to pursue the wicked:""I would not rest easy until that cur was roasting and screaming in hell!""The film captures the novel's spirit-Cormac McCarthy with laughs.Mattie is an avenging fury.This will affect the rest of her life.The Coens movie is stronger than Hathaway's by fully re-engaging the western,aided by the cinematography of Deakins,the historical accuracy,but also by its greater weirdness:Mattie cutting down a corpse,the pitilessness of the wider world outside Fort Smith,the post Civil War atmospherics,the silencing of the about-to-be-hanged Indian,the passing of the buffalo,the Indian relieving them of the corpse to trade with,the mountain medicine-man dressed in a bearskin,the madman in Pepper's gang with his maniacal gobbles and squawkings,Mattie sleeping in a coffin.We could be in The Outlaw Josie Wales in spirit.Bridges Cogburn is meaner than Wayne's,but as heroic and his gruff hide-""I don't believe in fairytales or sermons or stories about money,baby sister"" and he seems to desert her- has a protective core.He threatens LaBoeuf when he whips Mattie. LaBoeuf ,the dandy Texas Ranger is far better served by Matt Damon than Glen Cambell.Brolin plays Chaney as an evil psychopath.The music has spirituals in it like `Leaning on the Everlasting Arms',which recalls Night of the Hunter,especially with the story's final desperate ride with its macabre,swooning fairytale elements of sweeping stars.The Coens restore the scripture-sprinkled narrative,the introductory voiceover and coda, her complex feelings towards Coburn are more mysterious.

I thought Jeff Bridges was very strong in his role as Rooster Cogburn.  Like some of the other reviews have said, he was a little hard to understand at times, so crank up the volume and turn on the subtitles.  Matt Damon was great in his role as LaBoeuf, as well.  He played the egotistical lawman perfectly.  His interchanges with Jeff Bridges were awesome.Here's what took the one star away from this movie (spoiler alert):  I found the premiss of this movie to be completely too far fetched to be realistic.  Mattie Ross (played by Hailee Steinfeld, who did a great job) would never have been taken seriously as the spokesperson for her dead father's estate.  Especially when she was negotiating for her father's money back on the horses.  Or, when she tagged along with Rooster.

1366013,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B003UESJME,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The real star in this movie is clearly Haliee Steinfield. The characters portrayed are exaggerated and unrealistic, bordering on unbelievable and cartoon-ish. This adds to the enjoyment of the film. Haliee as Mattie has developed a level of knowledge and maturity that most people don't achieve in a lifetime, let alone in 14 years. There are certain characteristics of background people that make things interesting. For instance the undertaker tells Mattie on two separate occasions that it is okay for her to kiss a corpse, then later tells her it is okay if she wants to sleep in the coffin. Is the undertaker a borderline necrophiliac? The Texas Ranger LaBoeuf talks about kissing Mattie, then later spanks her. Is he boarding on pedophilia? Then there is the grandmother who snores.

1366015,A2DYREXTG5D1SD,B003UESJME,The Sasquatch,"[12, 29]","I'm going to try and keep this simple, as I could write paragraphs about how this was a horrible re-boot. It saddened me too, because I went into the film wanting to like it, based on the reviews.The Acting - Nothing short of SAD. Jeff Bridges is a good actor, but NO ONE can ever replace John Wayne; especially in his Academy Award Winning role. The Duke brought so much emotion and heart to the Rooster Cogburn character, while Bridges just seemed like a pathetic boring drunk, playing a role for a paycheck. At no time did I feel any love or emotion towards Bridges as I did for Wayne. Kim Darby blew away Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. Clearly, Hailee looked the correct age, but couldn't hold a candle to Kim's perfomance of Mattie. I felt no simpathy for Hailee's character as I did Kim's. Kim brought so much raw emotion to Mattie, that after a while, you felt for the poor girl. Matt Damon's portrayal of LaBoeuf was another joke. He was so boring lifeless. Glenn Campbell brought humor and a certain arrogance to LaBouef. Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney...I'm stumbling over what to say. Another unemotional and boring character portrayal. Last but not least, Barry Pepper as Ned Pepper. He reminded me of Buford Tannon in Back to the Future III. Robert DuVall had a better look and didn't have to use a ""rough, raspy"" voice to make you believe he was a bad ass.The Score - absolutely lifeless and dreary. The original score may have been a little ""cheesey"", but it brought a certain feel to the movie, that complimented the sequences in the film.The Scenery - no where near as vibrant and alive as the original.I would say my biggest gripe was the over-the-top phony ""cowboy"" dialect. In the original, everyone spoke in the REAL voice. Bridges, Brolin, Pepper and Damon all spoke in a ridiculous dialect. Many times you couldn't understand what Bridges was saying. It was so annoying.I'll close with this: The 2010 version of True Grit is a disgraceful attempt at re-booting one of John Wayne's best performances ever. Everything about the re-boot was inferior to the 1969 Henry Hathawy film. It was clear that the Coen's wanted this to be a dark depressing movie, which is the exact opposite of the story and original film. The Duke is probably rolling over in his grave. I have friends that saw this movie and liked it. I then introduced them to the original, which looks abslutely amazing on Blu Ray, and they agree that the original is a much better film. Thankfully, this only cost me 3.99 on Black Friday. I honestly think this movie got all the hype it did, simply because the Coen's directed it. Don't know why so many people think they are amazing director's. They've had a few good films, and this wasn't one of them.",1,Over Hyped.

1366018,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B003UESJME,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 10]","Joel and Ethan Cohen are my favorite filmmakers. They always manage to create interesting, unusual, highly memorable films filled with funny, original characters. Some of their films are better than others, but they are all good, offering us glimpses into strange worlds pulled from the minds of this duo. And they are on quite a streak, producing a series of films remarkable for even this team. Their latest, ""True Grit"" reunites them with Jeff Bridges and Josh Brolin, adding Matt Damon and a remarkable performance from newcomer Hallie Steinfeld to create one of their best films yet.Mattie Ross (Steinfeld) arrives in town to deal with her father's death at the hands of the coward Tom Chaney (Brolin) who has most certainly fled into the neighboring Indian country. The young lady, accompanied by a family servant, makes her way to the undertakers, quickly identifies her father's remains and makes preparations for the servant to accompany the body back home. Mattie has other plans and intends to stay in town for a few days. She quickly learns U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Bridges) is in town and it takes some work, but she eventually gains a face to face meeting and explains she wants to track down Chaney and bring him back to justice. Cogburn is reluctant, so she turns to Texas Ranger LaBeouf (Damon) who is already in town to apprehend the same man for other violations. The two men eventually agree to work together and help the young woman.The Coen Brothers have apparently used the original book as the basis for their new film, keeping the original John Wayne vehicle at arm's length. I have never seen the original, not a fan of the Duke, but I have to believe this newer version is a more accurate depiction of life in the Old West. And closer to the original book as well. I just can't believe John Wayne's Cogburn is introduced in the same way as Bridge's interpretation. And the Coens have populated the story with unusual, interesting characters, characters who look and act like you would expect people living in the Old West to act. At one point, Rooster and Mattie cross paths with Bear Man, a self-proclaimed veterinarian, doctor and dentist. The man, wearing a bear fur with the bear's head sitting on his head, talks in a slow, halting way, much like someone who has little interaction with other people might. It must seem strange for him to speak, let alone see and interact with others when he spends so much time on the trail alone. They meet a small handful of people, each different and unusual, each affected by life in the Old West..For that matter, this is part of the reason Bridges' portrayal is, well, kind of brilliant. From the moment we first hear Rooster, Bridges perfectly embodies the character; Cogburn has spent so much time on the trail, alone, he has difficulty relating to others as we currently feel would be proper. But in his day and age, Cogburn maybe came into contact with hundreds of people over the course of his life. There simply weren't that many people then. It is difficult for him to come up with a pleasantry when Bear Man makes an appearance. Instead, his first words are ""You are not LaBeouf"", as though it is Bear Man's fault he is not who they were looking for.Matt Damon plays Texas Ranger LaBeouf, a man who seems desperate to uphold the romantic ideals of his organization. In town to bring Chaney to justice, he  agrees to help Mattie in her quest for justice. When he and Cogburn begin working together, it quickly becomes clear the two men would prefer to continue working alone. But LaBeouf adapts and even seems to enjoy the company. Cogburn, on the other hand, does not adapt so well and the other man's constant chatter gets under his skin, causing him to become even more ornery.Damon is just about always good and LaBeouf is an interesting character. At one point, the Ranger experiences some physical challenges which he quickly overcomes and these only seem to make him more steadfast and determined. Damon is able to make us believe he is experiencing these problems for real keeping them in our mind throughout, helping LaBeouf really stand out.Josh Brolin's portrayal of Chaney is good, but it is little more than a cameo. There are more than a few instances of high profile actors taking on small, pivotal roles in films; Chaney is the reason for the film, yet we actually only live with him for a few minutes. Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"" and Orson Welles' Harry Lime in ""The Third Man"" are the best examples of this type of role. On the one hand, his character is very important and you feel like you know enough. On the other, you want to get to know more about him. Because of the importance of his character, it makes no sense to let an unknown actor play the role.Hallie Steinfeld does a remarkably good job as Mattie Ross. From the moment we first lay eyes on her, we know she is a very mature young lady. She quickly sends the family servant away, essentially leaving her to her own devices, to survive on her own in the Old West, to handle her dead father's affairs. Our initial concerns about a fourteen year old on her own in the frontier are quickly put to rest as we witness how well she deals with the men in this world. If she can conquer these men, nothing will stand in her way. Strangely, she seems to have more trouble with the few women she encounters; the owner of her father's boarding house welcomes her to her ample bosom yet is unable to meet her simple requests.This year two of the best performances in film have come from two young newcomers. Earlier this summer, Jennifer Lawrence was mesmerizing in ""Winter's Bone"" as another young woman forced to be an adult before her time. If you haven't seen ""Winter's Bone"" you are missing out on one of the best films of the year. In most years, we would be lucky to have one such great performance. It is a treat to have two.The Coen Brothers have worked overtime to bring such a high level of attention to detail to the film. The film begins with an Iris Open effect, commonly used in silent film, and when Mattie arrives in the small town, we feel as though we have stepped back in time to join her. This essentially allows the brothers to lead us into this new world with the heroine. Later, a discussion between Cogburn and LaBeouf contains, a co-worker tells me, references to real skirmishes in the Civil War, giving us deeper insight into their characters. We witness a trial involving Cogburn as a witness, giving us a glimpse into many other facets of life in the Old West.The Coen Brothers earned their reputation for a series of off the wall, almost slapstick comedies filled with eccentric, strange characters. In the last few years, they have shifted their focus towards a more diverse selection of stories. ""Fargo"" is a very funny movie, but it also deals with a lot of human pain. ""No Country for Old Men"" is a frightening tale of revenge and the efforts of one man to stop the killer. ""A Serious Man"" is a deeply introspective look at a college professor in the 60s, a man who seems to have been inspired by some of their father's own history. ""Man"" is a real puzzle; strange and hard to decipher, I have seen the film three times and appreciate it more each time. Now with ""True Grit"", they turn to a story perfect for their sensibilities. It allows them to explore a violent, at times humorous, tale filled with strange and unusual characters.""True Grit"" is the perfect Coen Brothers' vehicle and a great example of their skill and craft.",5,"This Is One Film With ""True Grit""",1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,7542,"['Joel', 'Ethan', 'Cohen', 'are', 'favorite', 'filmmakers', 'always', 'manage', 'create', 'interesting', 'unusual',

Bridges is a good actor but nowhere near the Rooster that Wayne was.  Was Bridges saying his lines with marbles in his mouth or in the book did Rooster have a speech impediment?  There were times I really didn't even understand him.  And the girl playing Mattie couldn't even hold Kim Darby's dirty clothes.  She was totally uninspiring if you compare the zest with which Darby played the part.  I even missed Glenn Campbell and a young Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper.  To be fair to Bridges, Wayne was an icon who really just played John Wayne, a larger than life  American treasure.  An Oscar nomination for Bridges?  I certainly hope not.  This portrayal doesn't merit one.  Besides, if Eastwood was not nominated for Gran Torino it would be criminal to nominate Bridges in this uninspired effort.  What's next?

A western, set in Arkansas and the pre-state territory that is now Oklahoma, the movie is faithful to the old west setting and genre.

And very satisfyingly, I felt, is rendered faithfully by the whole cast, giving the movie a unique, rich language, that I feel marked the movie as a Coen Brother's film.  The entire cast did an excellent job.  As well as viewing the film on Anazon Instant Video, I also bought the DVD through Amazon, and it includes three excellent special features, one with Hailee Steinfield, the young star, one with Mary Zophres, the costume designer, and one showing the set designer's recreation of the old western town Fort Smith.

1366022,A1D9C4NC8TZ9Q2,B003UESJME,TJ Burnzley,"[1, 2]","I am not trying to start a great debate--this is just a review of a film I have found to be entertaining every time I watch it.  I am old enough to have seen John Wayne's Oscar-winning performance as Rooster Cogburn in a first run theater and many times since.  Most people who dislike the Coen Bros version take issue with the attempt to remake a ""classic.""  I thought then and still think now that the original True Grit is a good movie, but not a great movie.  Similarly, Wayne's performance is good, not great.  You want to see Wayne's best performance, watch The Searchers.  Nevertheless, the original True Grit holds a dear place in many hearts, and I was surprised the Coen's chose this as their western project.  I was as skeptical as everyone else when I read Jeff Bridges would play Cogburn.  Bridges is an actor, but because of Wayne's portrayal and status as Hollywood legend, the role requires the qualities of an icon.  I think Bridges proves that great acting trumps a legend.  He totally inhabits the character, and I, for one, think he earned his Oscar nomination.  I recently watched The Big Lebowski, The Contender, and True Grit back-to-back (yes, I am retired), and there is no doubt Bridges is one of the best actors of our time.  Regarding True Grit (2010), the Coen's cast Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie, a role in which she is perfect.  How the Oscar went to Melissa Leo (whose work I respect very much) is now one of the many ""misplaced Oscar"" stories.  I found the language of the film, in particular Steinfeld's diction, realistic and refreshing.  Another improvement over the original is Matt Damon as Leboeuf.  Much of the film's sparse humor rides on the banter between Cogburn and Leboeuf, and I laugh out loud at their scenes together.  Just as important is the scene between Mattie and Leboeuf before he leaves camp.  Both actors achieve a credible tenderness, and the writing is perfectly understated.  I have seen this film in the theater, on DVD and on Blu-ray.  At the end of each viewing, I have felt the same--this is a great movie, possible the best western movie of all time.",5,Possibly the Best Western,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",2011,2113,"['am', 'not', 'trying', 'start', 'great', 'debate', 'just', 'review', 'film', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'time', 'watch', 'am', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'seen', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'first', 'run', 'theater', 'many', 'times', 'Most', 'people', 'who', 'dislike', 'Coen', 'Bros', 'version', 'take', 'issue', 'attempt', 'remake', 'classic', 'thought', 'then', 'still', 'think', 'now', 'original', 'True', 'Grit', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'Similarly', 'Wayne', 'performance', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'want', 'see', 'Wayne', 'best', 'performance', 'watch', 'Searchers', 'Nevertheless', 'original', 'True', 'Grit', 'dear', 'place', 'many', 'hearts', 'was', 'surprised', 'Coen', 'chose', 'western', 'project', 'was', 'as', 'skeptical', 'everyone', 'else', 'when', 'read', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'would', 'play', 'Cogburn', 'Bridges', 'actor', 'Wayne', 'portrayal', 'status', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'role', 'qualities', 'icon', 'think', 'Bridges', 'great', 'acting', 'trumps', 'legend', 'totally', 'character', 'one', 'think', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'recently', 'watched', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Contender', 'True', 'Grit', 'back-to-back', 'yes', 'am', 'retired', 'doubt', 'Bridges', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'time', 'Regarding', 'True', 'Grit', '2010', 'Coen', 'cast', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'Mattie', 'role', 'perfect', 'How', 'Oscar', 'went', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'work', 'respect', 'very', 'much', 'now', 'one', 'many', 'misplaced', 'Oscar', 'stories', 'found', 'language', 'film', 'particular', 'Steinfeld', 'diction', 'realistic', 'refreshing', 'improvement', 'original', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Leboeuf', 'Much', 'film', 'sparse', 'humor', 'rides', 'banter', 'Cogburn', 'Leboeuf', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'scenes', 'together', 'Just', 'important', 'scene', 'Mattie', 'Leboeuf', 'camp', 'actors', 'achieve', 'credible', 'tenderness', 'writing', 'perfectly', 'understated', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'theater', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'end', 'viewing', 'have', 'felt', 'same', 'great', 'movie', 'possible', 'best', 'western', 'movie', 'time']",True Grit

Jeff Bridges is also excellent in this film, and brings a realness to his character.

1366027,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B003UESJME,Todd Bartholomew,"[0, 1]","By hewing more closely to Charles Portis' novelTrue Gritand the perspective of its protagonist, 14 year old Mattie Ross, the Coen Brothers have created what is perhaps their best film and one for the ages.  Comparisons with the book and the previous version of the film are inevitable, but this film easily eclipses the prior film featuring John Wayne largely due to the fantastic ensemble case, taut script writing and directing, and some of the best cinematography, art direction, and costuming in recent films.  ""True Grit"" captures the essence of the era, a much harder, rougher, and more violent time in the West.  This version focuses the action on young Mattie Ross who narrates the film and propels it onwards in her quest for justice.  Unlike the 1968 version ofTrue Grit (Special Collector's Edition), which was more of a vehicle for Wayne, the course language and violence is largely retained from Portis' novel, and it is that stunning vernacular prose that is captured pitch-perfect here.  There is a poignant beauty to some of the dialog that at times is almost Shakespearian as is Mattie's single-minded commitment to seeing justice be done.  In the hands of a less capable actress Mattie Ross could come across as headstrong, cloying, obnoxious, or worse.  Yet the breakout debut performance by Hailee Steinfeld carries with it a sense of tentativeness and vulnerability the role requires.  Going with an unknown was an enormous gamble but it pays off brilliantly here.  Bridges is likewise pitch perfect as Rooster Cogburn, the cantankerous lawman Mattie goads into pursuing her father's killer.  Bridges plays the part with gusto, never veering into caricature and honestly I've never seen him better than this Oscar-worthy bravura performance.  Matt Damon's turn as the blustery Texas Ranger Le Beouf is particularly well tailored and the interplay between Ross, Cogburn, and Le Beouf as they track down Tom Chaney and his cohorts is hilarious - truly capturing the wit and humor from Portis' book.The Coens also aren't afraid of quiet interludes throughout the movie, rather than creating a frenetic non-stop action movie approach that gives the movie time to breathe without losing any sense of suspense.  Those who have read the book or who have seen the prior film largely know how it unfolds.  Without spoiling the end, the final third of the movie where Mattie is caught by Tom Chaney and his gang's memorable d&eacute;nouement is absolutely spellbinding.  Cogburn's efforts to save Mattie are profoundly moving, a testament to selflessness in the face of danger, and by the end I was bawling like a child.  In a time where movies are disposable flotsam in pop culture ""True Grit"" transcends completely, becoming art rather than being arty.  ""True Grit"" is an emotional roller coaster ride where you can certainly see aspects of yourself in many of the characters.  None of them wants to be where they are, yet all have a need and a desire to complete what must be done - the definition of true grit.  Every aspect of the movie is so well done and executed with skill and devotion that I could watch it over and over again.  I rarely see a movie a second time in theaters, but was moved by ""True Grit"" that I jumped at the chance to see it again.  Each viewing reveals still more detail you may have missed before and revel in the beauty of the script and the performances.  Even if you're not a fan of Westerns there's plenty here to enjoy, and ""True Grit"" is really more a tale of morality and selfless devotion to your fellow man; a movie that while sad at the end is nonetheless life affirming and inspirational.",5,Breathtakingly Good!,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,3641,"['hewing', 'more', 'closely', 'Charles', 'Portis', 'novelTrue', 'Gritand', 'perspective', 'protagonist', '14', 'year', 'old', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'have', 'created', 'what', 'perhaps', 'best', 'film', 'one', 'ages', 'Comparisons', 'book', 'previous', 'version', 'film', 'are', 'inevitable', 'film', 'easily', 'prior', 'film', 'featuring', 'John', 'Wayne', 'largely', 'due', 'fantastic', 'ensemble', 'case', 'taut', 'script', 'writing', 'directing', 'best', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'costuming', 'recent', 'films', 'True', 'Grit', 'essence', 'era', 'much', 'harder', 'rougher', 'more', 'violent', 'time', 'West', 'version', 'action', 'young', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'who', 'film', 'propels', 'quest', 'justice', '1968', 'version', 'ofTrue', 'Grit', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'was', 'more', 'vehicle', 'Wayne', 'course', 'language', 'violence', 'largely', 'retained', 'Portis', 'novel', 'stunning', 'vernacular', 'prose', 'captured', 'pitch-perfect', 'here', 'poignant', 'beauty', 'dialog', 'times', 'almost', 'Shakespearian', 'Mattie', 'single-minded', 'commitment', 'seeing', 'justice', 'be', 'done', 'hands', 'less', 'capable', 'actress', 'Mattie', 'Ross', 'could', 'come', 'headstrong', 'cloying', 'obnoxious', 'worse', 'breakout', 'debut', 'performance', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'sense', 'tentativeness', 'vulnerability', 'role', 'Going', 'unknown', 'was', 'enormous', 'gamble', 'off', 'brilliantly', 'here', 'Bridges', 'likewise', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Rooster', 'Cogburn', 'cantankerous', 'lawman', 'Mattie', 'pursuing', 'father', 'killer', 'Bridges', 'part', 'gusto', 'never', 'veering', 'caricature', 'honestly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'better', 'Oscar-worthy', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'turn', 'blustery', 'Texas', 'Ranger', 'Le', 'Beouf', 'particularly', 'well', 'tailored', 'interplay', 'Ross', 'Cogburn', 'Le', 'Beouf', 'track', 'down', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'cohorts', 'hilarious', 'truly', 'capturing', 'wit', 'humor', 'Portis', 'book.The', 'Coens', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'quiet', 'interludes', 'movie', 'rather', 'creating', 'frenetic', 'non-stop', 'action', 'movie', 'approach', 'movie', 'time', 'breathe', 'losing', 'sense', 'suspense', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'prior', 'film', 'largely', 'know', 'how', 'spoiling', 'end', 'final', 'third', 'movie', 'where', 'Mattie', 'caught', 'Tom', 'Chaney', 'gang', 'memorable', 'd', 'eacute', 'absolutely', 'spellbinding', 'Cogburn', 'efforts', 'save', 'Mattie', 'are', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'testament', 'selflessness', 'face', 'danger', 'end', 'was', 'bawling', 'child', 'time', 'where', 'movies', 'are', 'disposable', 'flotsam', 'pop', 'culture', 'True', 'Grit', 'completely', 'becoming', 'art', 'rather', 'being', 'arty', 'True', 'Grit', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'where', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'aspects', 'many', 'characters', 'None', 'be', 'where', 'are', 'yet', 'have', 'need', 'desire', 'complete', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'definition', 'true', 'grit', 'aspect', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'executed', 'skill', 'devotion', 'could', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'rarely', 'see', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'theaters', 'was', 'moved', 'True', 'Grit', 'jumped', 'chance', 'see', 'again', 'viewing', 'reveals', 'still', 'more', 'detail', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'revel', 'beauty', 'script', 'performances', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Westerns', 'plenty', 'here', 'enjoy', 'True', 'Grit', 'really', 'more', 'tale', 'morality', 'selfless', 'devotion', 'fellow', 'man', 'movie', 'sad', 'end', 'nonetheless', 'life', 'affirming', 'inspirational']",True Grit

I know people stand on each side of that, and I do not want that element in my review because it is showing partiality between two good movies. Thanks.A 14-year-old girl finds her father murdered by a man he trusted. After claiming the body for 60 dollars, she steps up and determines that she has to become the insturment of justice or her father will have none. In doing so, she teams up with a marshall, a ranger, and sets out into the unknown.When True Grit came out, I had high hopes for it. The directors clout alone says that this should eb a grea tmovie, and I really was not disappointed. The one thing I was surprised by was the fact that I laughed quite a bit while watching it, and I found myself not being bored. It had great narration, great dialog, and great acting moving that one thing forward. If it had not been that way, I wonder what would have been - thankfully I did not have to ponder that in the really real.The acting in this movie shines, and it makes you really think about how good some of these people can be. Jeff Bridges was the standout amongst everyone, with his portrayal of a man that had grown drunk and cocky and fatter with time, but was still full of fire and grit. The same can be said of the girl that hires him, with her not only presenting a formitable front but also doing great narration. Matt Damon was good but he seemed a little stale in some places, but even that worked in favor of the man standing in that Ranger's badge.The plot itself was easy to follow, but some things happen that you might not expect. I enjoyed that, too, and I liked the fact that the ending was not predictable. Like many Coen movies, I thought I might know the ending but I wasn't sure. I did think one thing, however, and that was that there was a link in the types of endings they had been presenting. Perhaps that says something on them or their views or just what they like. Whatever it is, I find I like it as well.The effects are nice, too, and it has some violent portions. It really does not have to have these and does not rely on them, sticking to dialogue more than anything. this earns it an easy 4.0/5 stars in my book, and is easily worth watching.

I believe we have the director to blame for some of the failure in this movie such as having Jeff Bridges over do trying to sound gruff. In the middle of the movie where a little more of his natural voice was allowed, it was actually an improvement to the experience of the movie. The gal that plays Mattie had some bright spots with her expressions, but the haggling scene came up short in comparison to the original. I'm not a huge John Wayne fan, BUT when he did something right.....he flat did it extremely well and the same goes for Duvall and the rest of the cast of characters in the original. Matt Damon started out well but then was no better than Glenn Campbell and lacked in his performance.I blame the director for the shortcomings in this movie. Sure Barry Pepper is a great actor, but he just didn't carry the role as well as Duvall. Josh Brolin was ok, but again kept from doing it as well as he could. It was obvious. It was as if all the actors were being held back from giving their best to follow the vision of the director who should stick to Sci-fi etc and forget about remaking a great classic western that was done so perfectly the first time around. I honestly don't know what the director was thinking. I live out west and the characters lacked the flavor, the spice and character of real life out here.John Wayne's True Grit captured all of it.My wife was also greatly disappointed in this film, so much so that she demanded I get the original along with Rooster Cogburn in case some fool decided to do a remake and screw that up as well.You expect more, you expect better, not in special effects, but in content and performance.

1366033,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003UESJME,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I have to disagree with Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald who downgraded 'True Grit' slightly because of what she terms ""the prevailing lack of Coen-ness in the movie."" In fact, that's precisely why the movie worked a lot better than many of their previous offerings (usually involving trashing one of their prototypical straw man anti-heroes as well as reveling in their ubiquitous 'glass is half-empty' philosophy of life). The Coens have been quoted as saying that they approached the True Grit source material quite reverently, based on Charles Portis' 1968 novel, ""with its emphasis on adventure and quest.""As usual the Coen cinematography and set design is excellent, creating a much better look to the old west, than the way it was depicted in the first True Grit vehicle, starring John Wayne. Except for the ending and a greater emphasis on Mattie Ross (focusing on the clever 14 year old, as the story's main protagonist), both versions pretty much followed the main plot points as found in the novel.I found this 'True Grit' to be mildly interesting but often slow-moving. It takes quite a while before 14 year old Mattie conscripts Rooster Cogburn, the 'meanest' US Marshall in the west, who will eventually track down Chaney, the man who killed her father. Joining them along the way is LaBouef, the Texas Ranger played by Matt Damon, who is also seeking Chaney for the killing of a Texas State Senator. When Mattie objects to LaBouef and Cogburn agreeing to bring Chaney back to Texas and not to her hometown to stand trial for the murder of her father, she receives a whipping from LeBouef. Cogburn intervenes, preventing LaBouef from inflicting additional punishment, and he then leaves.Although one of the strong suits of the film is the dialogue which features interesting local references, it's often hard to understand much of it, as Jeff Bridges has a tendency to mumble his words. The Coen brothers are determined to make this True Grit more 'grittier' and play up the violence. Cogburn is not politically correct when he gruffly tosses two Native Americans off a porch as he looks for an outlaw, Ned Pepper, and his gang, who are reportedly traveling with Chaney. When he finds two outlaws, Quincey and Moon, in an empty dugout, Quincey cuts off Moon's fingers and stabs him in the chest, to prevent him from talking, with Cogburn forced then to dispose of Quincey.Most of the rest of 'True Grit' is perfunctory. Ned shows up with his gang and Cogburn kills some of them with his shotgun, saving LeBouef in the process (who showed up earlier, right before the gang comes on the scene). Eventually, Mattie is kidnapped by Chaney, Cogburn kills most of Ned's gang, but is saved at the last moment by LaBouef, who shoots Ned, from a cliff, 400 yards away. Oh yes, Mattie eventually kills Chaney but falls into what looks like an abandoned mine, only to be saved by Cogburn after she's bitten by a rattlesnake.True Grit has its moments, but there are really few surprises overall, in this average tale of a teenager's desire for vengeance. Much of the conflict stems from the tension between the perspicacious Mattie and Cogburn, who is often befuddled by the tenacity of such a female. It works occasionally because it's nice to see such a macho character as Cogburn, get his comeuppance. But Cogburn is also such a one-note character, that the machinations between the two principals, begins to grow tiresome. As for the plot, it's basically a tale of the good guys dispatching the bad guys (with antagonists who aren't particularly interesting). The film might have worked a bit better if we arrived at the climax a bit sooner.The Coen Brothers did well in adding on the ending which is found in the novel but not in the 1968 film. We see Maddie (sans an arm due to the snake bite) now as a grown woman, looking for Cogburn, but tragically misses him by only three days (Cogburn, employed at a circus, dies right before Maddie can find him). After all the excitement, Maddie ironically turns out to be a spinster, in her adulthood (no CGI effects here folks; the Coens actually did a nationwide search and found a one-armed woman, who could play the part).Perhaps True Grit's main problem is that it's based on source material that has quite a bit of realistic dialogue but no real twists and turns in the plot. I liked Hailee Steinfeld as the new Maddie, as she provides a more 'serious' approach than the Kim Darby version in 1968. As for Jeff Bridges, some have said he's guilty of overacting; I leave further evaluations for the pundits, although again, I think he could have done better in annunciating his lines a bit better. Damon fails to bring anything distinctive to the thankless part of LaBouef.In the end, True Grit pretty much is an average western, featuring better than usual dialogue as well as a great deal of impressive cinematography. For once the Coen brothers decide not to stand above the fray and expect to be congratulated for shooting down one of their usual straw men. This time, they've done an honest job in attempting to adapt someone else's material. Not all of it works but one can say it's mighty nice to look at--and that's no small feat.",3,Coen Brothers' re-make has impressive cinematography and set design but plot is nothing to write home

Largely faithful to the novel of the same name ""True Grit"" receives a marvelous Blu-ray transfer that looks sharp, has nice depth and detail. Audio sounds terrific with a VERY active surround lossless mix.As far as extras for the film itself we get the following: DVD with digitally encoded copy on the same disc as well as the following featurettes; ""Mattie's True Grit"" where actress Halee Steinfeld talks about her role in the film;""From Bustlers to Buckskins"" focusing on the costuming of the movie; ""Colds, Winchesters and Remingtons"" focusing on the gun hardware used in the movie; ""Re-creating Fort Smith"" where we see the careful and detailed creation of Fort Smith, Ark as shown in the film. We also get brief (all too brief) interviews with the actors and a discussion of Roger Deakins' marvelous cinematography. ""Charles Portis: The Greatest Writer You've Never Heard Of"" profiles the author of the novel both films were based on giving us as much as is know about the author. It's a nice supplement and doesn't overstay its welcome at a little over a half hour. We also get the theatrical trailer for the film in high def.If you're a fan of John Wayne's original film you may or may not like the Coen's slightly different take on the same material. The Coen's go for authenticity and a gritty style that was only hinted at in the previous film. Rooster Cogburn is portrayed by Jeff Bridges as much less of a loveable grump and a hard man with little in the way of qualities to make him someone you would like. Matt Damon does a marvelous job as LeBeof making the Texas Ranger a strange cross of lawman and dandy. The supporting roles for the film are all well cast and the film is filled with the Coen's characteristic off-beat sense of humor.The original Wayne western was the dying gasp of the older styled Hollywood western quickly being replaced by Sergio Leone's epic westerns filled with anti-heroes and Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood's darker hued films that succeeded Leone's which featured characters in need of redemption but rarely searching for it.

1366042,A3S1EUMKDM571E,B003UESJME,William Caputo,"[2, 6]","True Grit (2010) is a much better movie than the original 1969 John Wayne movie for quite a few reasons:1.) The Mattie Ross character in the original movie (played by Kim Darby) was such an annoying, dumb, and cowardly woman that I was hoping that The Duke would shoot her too. She was acting too much like a spoiled baby-boomer than a female living in the late 1800s. The new Mattie Ross character is a very calm, intelligent, and brave woman. In fact, her 14 year-old character is even more intelligent than college-educated women in the 21st century. It's nice to see females back when they were smart and brave without being masculine.2.) The LaBeef character in the original movie (played by country / pop singer Glen Campbell) was dull as dishwater. That's because Glen Campbell should have stuck to singing his country-pop crossover hits like ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""Galveston"" instead of trying to act. He's a singer, not an actor and his poor acting proves this. The new LaBeef character is played by Matt Damon (an actual actor) and this gives the Texas Ranger character something it was missing before....character depth and a convincing performance.3.) The Rooster Cogburn character in the original movie (played by John Wayne) was too comical to be convincing as a U.S. Marshal. It reminded me of his performance in the awful western-comedy ""McLintock."" The award John Wayne won for this movie was strictly a sympathy award. Nobody played a tough movie cowboy better than The Duke but nobody played a comedic cowboy clown worse than The Duke and, sad to say, The Duke playe one in ""True Grit"" and ""McLintock."" The new Rooster Cogburn character (played by Jeff Bridges) is a U.S. Marshal whose humor is subtle and not clownish; who has a toubled past not explored in the original film; and the voice of a grizzled, hard-nosed, hard-drinking older man instead of the famous slurred voice of John Wayne who talked the same way in every movie.4.) The plot is closer to the novel than the original movie and that matters here because it's a good plot. Not even a fair plot but a good plot of revenge.All in all: Bridges' grit is true...Wayne's grit is false to the point of being comical.However, True Grit (1969) has some better qualities than the re-make.1.) Robert Duvall's Ned Pepper in the original is a far more menacing villain than Barry Pepper's Ned Pepper. Also, Robert Duvall is one of the greatest actors of all-time. No actor after Duvall's generation even comes close to portraying such brilliance on-screen [can you imagine Tom Hanks playing a fierce villain? And no, ""Road to Perdition"" doesn't count...he was as menacing in that as he was in Bosom Buddies, Big, and all those other goofy movies he makes].I think the casting director chose Barry Pepper to play Ned Pepper just because their last names are the same. I can imagine what the casting director thought to himself when he came up with that idea: ""Pepper playing Pepper! Oh, The Irony!""2.) There is no Strother Martin in the re-make. I know it was impossible to have him reprise his role as the Colonel whom Maggie Ross bargains with because he's been dead since 1980 but that doesn't matter. The Colonel in this movie tries too hard to have a Strother Martin accent and it comes off as an obviously bogus voice. They should have had the actor playing the Colonel speak in his normal voice or have Strother Martin's voice dubbed-in with the new Colonel's dialogue. Heck, the actor could have imitated John Wayne's voice as a subtle tribute. No western character was like the late great Strother Martin and anyone who tries to mimmick him is only embarrassing himself.3.) Josh Brolin's Chaney isn't as effective as the original Chaney but the Coen Brothers probably chose him because he was in their last big hit ""No Country For Old Men."" It's basically a sympathy role. Personally, I would have preferred Billy Bob Thornton with a dark moustache as Chaney. Thinking of Josh Brolin riding that little bike in ""The Goonies"" makes it impossible for me to consider him a serious, let alone menacing, actor.4.) The famous dialogue between Ned Pepper and Rooster seemed much more appropriate in the original. If you forget the dialogue, it goes something like this:Pepper: That's just talk from an old, one-eyed fat man.Rooster: Fill your hands you son of a gun!When this part is in the remake, it seems too forced and out-of-place. It's as if the Coen Brothers said ""we HAVE TO put those lines in the movie! We just HAVE TO!""After all, John Wayne was FAT and Jeff Bridges isn't that fat at all in this movie so the lines in the original are more effective and insulting.Bottom Line: True Grit (2010) is much better than the original [which was one of Wayne's worst westerns], and it's a good adaptation of a good novel about the fascinating subject of vengeance.",4,His Grit Is True,1303948800,"04 28,

The latter novel /reads/ as if it had been written by the Coens, and I expect the Portis ""True Grit"" is not far-removed.""Needless to say"", the remake is far superior to the original. The Coens built their careers on the strange and off-kilter, the weird beneath the normal, which makes them ideal interpreters of a Portis novel. Their version captures -- what should I call it? -- the oddness of everything. The 1969 version is deadpan and bland.I have problems with two of the performances, though. Hailee Steinfeld is an obviously talented young woman. Unfortunately, she has to deliver long, densely worded speeches in Mattie's overly precise manner. This is not unlike playing a Paganini violin concerto! The words too-often blur together, not only making the dialog harder to understand, but undercutting the humor of her mannered speech and overbearing nature. This is not her fault, but the Coens'.And though I adore Jeff Bridges -- unquestionably one of the all-time-great American actors -- he too-often overplays Rooster. Yes, he's an infinitely better actor than John Wayne, but he lacks (or fails to put on) Wayne's gravitas, which allowed the Duke's drunkenness to seem part of the character's personality. I decided that, as ""True Grit"" /is/ a comedy, I would play along. But Bridges could have done better.Bridges has another problem. He's always been boyish-looking, and has one of the winningest smiles in movies. But as that boyishness has been overlaid with a handsome cragginess, the smile looks more and more out of place. When he smiles, he cannot avoid ""breaking character"", and we see the happy, well-adjusted human being he is. Bridges' best moments come when he /isn't/ speaking, and we see how a gifted actor uses his face to convey everything.Am I the only person who noticed that Barry Pepper seemed to be channeling Robert Duvall? Though not trying to imitate the timbre of Duvall's voice, the way Pepper delivers the lines, and his hand gestures (particularly) are decidedly Duvallish. Indeed, there's even a passing physical resemblance to the 40ish Duvall.The cinematography, beautifully captured on the Blu-ray, is magnificent. Many of the outdoor-daylight scenes have an other-worldly pale and washed-out quality (but without burned highlights) quite unlike anything I've seen in a Western.This is a wonderfully entertaining film, practically perfect in every way. I was particularly impressed by the opening scenes, which nearly tear out your heart -- not something the Coens are noted for. Strongly recommended.",5,"""I do not like you.

Given that, let me make a potentially blasphemous suggestion: this might be a good remake, maybe very good. I know that a good story really can't be copied, but even good tellings show their age. The story needs to be told again, in the words of a new generation, to remain fresh and vital.Back then people could tolerate a heroic man with a few flaws. Today, we can only believe in a flawed man with - maybe - a little heroism. And not just man, but woman, a very young woman, only 14 but still a force to be reckoned with. I've seen the level at which teenagers can perform in art, science, music, math, and impulsiveness. I am well disposed to believe in young Mattie's mix of intelligence, belligerence, visceral motivation, and remnant of little girl who wants a campfire story.If bloodshed suits you poorly, then this isn't a movie for you. It normally doesn't bother me much, but seeing it all around the barely-teen girl didn't work well for me. That's the only loss of innocence, though. It maintains a chaste tone throughout - even if one might have wished the adult Mattie a bit less chastity. Although I've liked Matt Damon in many other flicks, he didn't get a real chance to shine here.

Jeff Bridges is excellent as Rooster Cogburn; and Matt Damon & Josh Brolin are solid in their roles.It's interesting -- but fitting -- how Mattie's disposition remains intact as she grows older.

I vowed never to see it and treated it as a joke.But then, a funny thing happened...it turned into a serious project.  Actors like Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon were cast to give the film some gravitas, and all of a sudden the advance previews looked gritty and realistic.  So, with a few other Duke fans in tow, I broke my vow and headed to the theater.  Boy, was I ever glad I did, as otherwise I might have missed the greatest western film ever made.For a basic plot summary, ""True Grit"" tells the story of young Maddie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), who hires Deputy Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to avenge the death of her father at the hands of the coward Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin).  Along the way, with the help of Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), Maddie and Rooster track Chaney via the notorious Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) gang.What elevates this movie from the original is the closer following of the source material: Charles Portis' novel.  It isn't perfect, but the Coens portray a much darker, grittier time and circumstances.  Whereas the 60s version was all about the Duke, this one focuses on the rightful charge: the young, plucky Ross.""True Grit"" also does all the ""little things"" (which so often end up as so much more) perfectly.  The acting is flawless, the direction is solid, and even the music adds some emotional depth to the entire production.  Every scene is riveting, and will have you on the edge of your seat.  Heck, even the comedic and light-hearted moments do their job and add some needed levity.Thus, I consider 2010's ""True Grit"" to be the all-around greatest western I've ever seen.  There isn't a single scene that is a letdown, and all the other filmmaking factors converged to produce a masterpiece.
