575312,A2PL65YZRL1VDH,B000059XYE,Mike Sweeney,"[0, 0]","I believe that the song that was played when Andy went over to gabby's house was ""give"" by the suicide machines. Also, in that same movie, the Suicide Machines play the song ""look before you leap"" which is shown when Andy is doing a whole bunch of different things during the day and it shows a time period at the bottom of the screen. I believe it's also from the soundtrack ""Battle Hymes"" but I'm not 100% sure. You're best chance to find the song would be to look it up on limewire or something.Anyway, this is a great movie! I REALLY recommend it, even if you don't like skating, because it teaches the importance of friendship, and how it can be a lot greater than money.

Maybe it's the funny parts where the ""Soul Skaters"" and ""Sell-Outs"" play pranks on each other, or maybe the director just purposely filmed it with that feel-good attitude to it.  Either way, I think girls and boys alike will enjoy this movie full of skating, friendship, and rivalry.

In BRINK!, Andy Brinker (Erik Von Detten) and his friends rollerblade for the fun and enjoyment of doing it. When Andy's family starts to have money problems, Andy has to decide whether to dump his friends, or join a professional rollerblading team for the money. A great TV movie that tests one of the biggest problems and joys of all: Friendship. I really enjoyed watching this movie. Erik Von Detten is so cute and talented it's hard not to see this movie. BRINK! is a very delightful and entertaining TV movie for both kids and adults -- but mainly kids and teenagers will enjoy this movie, probably more than adults because kids and teeangers might understand it more.

(But I didn't...:-p)Brink! is about Andy Brinker (aka Brink--played by Erik von Detten--:-D), a &quot;soul skater&quot; who skates with his best friends Peter (Patrick Levis), Gabby (Christina Vidal), and Jordy (Asher Gold). They all skate for fun, nothing more. However, they're having problems with their rivals, Team XBladz, whose leader Val Horrigan (Sam Horrigan) has it in for Brink. Their ongoing rivalry leads to a race in school, in which one of XBladz's members, Boomer, gets hurts and can't compete in the upcoming championship.Brink finds out that his family is having money problems, and when Val comes up to him and his friends and tells them the upsides of XBladz, Brink thinks that could be a great way to make money. So he joins the team, but his friends find out and hate him. So Brink has to figure out whether to stay true to his friends (and if they'll forgive him), or to stay on XBladz and help out his family.This is a great movie in many aspects. The skating scenes kick, and the music is excellent. That punk rock stuff is exactly what skaters listen to, so they got that right. And the same with the clothes. The acting is good, and the plot is mundane, but believable in that sense. Plus, Erik von Detten is a total cutie, and he lights up the screen. Christina Vidal is also great.
