578188,A3VY4KU3TNPAO7,B00005AQ50,B. Andre,"[0, 0]",this was really a bizarre story yet made believable by skillful direction and performances. Wife was a new kind of film for me as i have not experienced many japanese films beyond say guinea pig and naked blood type shockers. this was a nice change. this sort of thing deffinately appeals to the darker side of voyeurism. i admittedly got a kick out of the sadistic shenannigans. not so sure if i would watch this again any time soon but it is well worth a look. kind of wish i hadnt purchased the initial us release for $20 since a new proper release has recently become available for a couple dollars more. i do recall the picture being rather dark and muddy and hopefully the new release corrects this. i would consider upgrading.pretty odd little psycho sexual film. a better release would warrant 4 stars.,3,this was interesting,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,810,"['was', 'really', 'bizarre', 'story', 'yet', 'made', 'believable', 'skillful', 'direction', 'performances', 'Wife', 'was', 'new', 'kind', 'film', 'i', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'many', 'japanese', 'films', 'say', 'guinea', 'pig', 'naked', 'blood', 'type', 'shockers', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'sort', 'thing', 'deffinately', 'appeals', 'darker', 'side', 'voyeurism', 'i', 'admittedly', 'got', 'kick', 'sadistic', 'shenannigans', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'i', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'soon', 'well', 'look', 'kind', 'wish', 'i', 'hadnt', 'purchased', 'initial', 'release', '20', 'new', 'proper', 'release', 'recently', 'become', 'available', 'couple', 'dollars', 'more', 'i', 'do', 'recall', 'picture', 'being', 'rather', 'dark', 'muddy', 'hopefully', 'new', 'release', 'i', 'would', 'consider', 'upgrading.pretty', 'odd', 'little', 'psycho', 'sexual', 'film', 'better', 'release', 'would', 'warrant', '4', 'stars']",Wife to Be Sacrificed

578190,A1P7R1Z7BQ5HCL,B00005AQ50,Ian Hunter,"[0, 0]","The ex-husband disappeared three years ago. He returns, claiming just to be passing through. By a clever device, he ensnares then kidnaps his ex-wife. He takes her to an almost idyllic rural location. The film becomes a study of seduction and conquest, resistance and a struggle to retain personal integrity. He promises. She `lets him'. Promises are broken. She is tethered. Degradation enters the frame. Torture ensues. Violation by two strangers leads to her discovery, unconscious and dishevelled. His reactions are contradictory. A fishing trip offers unexpected bounty. It is a digression that offers him more pleasure and her, vicarious and eventually, actual enjoyment. The two discovered young lovers are humiliated. Hers is perverse; lavatorial, with the irony of triumphant music to highlight her relief - perversion indeed. This is a wife being degraded, not sacrificed. The conclusion surprises, on many fronts.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'.",4,Degradation rather than sacrifice,1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,954,"['ex-husband', 'disappeared', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'claiming', 'just', 'be', 'passing', 'clever', 'device', 'then', 'kidnaps', 'ex-wife', 'almost', 'idyllic', 'rural', 'location', 'film', 'study', 'seduction', 'conquest', 'resistance', 'struggle', 'retain', 'personal', 'integrity', 'Promises', 'are', 'broken', 'tethered', 'Degradation', 'frame', 'Torture', 'ensues', 'Violation', 'two', 'strangers', 'discovery', 'unconscious', 'dishevelled', 'reactions', 'are', 'contradictory', 'fishing', 'trip', 'offers', 'unexpected', 'bounty', 'digression', 'more', 'pleasure', 'vicarious', 'eventually', 'actual', 'enjoyment', 'two', 'discovered', 'young', 'lovers', 'are', 'humiliated', 'Hers', 'perverse', 'lavatorial', 'irony', 'triumphant', 'music', 'highlight', 'relief', 'perversion', 'indeed', 'wife', 'being', 'degraded', 'not', 'sacrificed', 'conclusion', 'surprises', 'many', 'fronts.Ian', 'Hunter.Author', 'e-Love']",Wife to Be Sacrificed
578191,AEFTIUQHSVUFX,B00005AQ50,Joe Z,"[0, 0]","Wife goes from cliche, submissive Japanese wife to dominating submissive - meaning she demands to be tied and tortured. While some complain about the content, it is/was, IMHO, 40 years ahead of its time. If you follow current trends in Japanese BDSM, it's all here. This movie could have been made last Thursday, it is that relevent.My issues are with plot and, I don't know how to say this, but it would have been a good intro to a real look at a twisted psychology. Meaning that her transformation could have happened in, say, fifteen minutes, then we'd be treated to a movie about a transformed woman exploring her new life. Also, there's no real indication as to the time frame. Did he keep her for a week? A month? When the change comes it comes awfully fast.As for plot, there's a gratuitous rape scene where she ends up half naked and muddy. And hubby brings her to an abandoned house that seems overstocked with rope of all shapes and colors. There's no explanation as to how he saves the young suicide couple. And no logic as to how they manage their second attempt. I won't spoil it, but it's one of those 'huh?' moments.Bottom line: An enjoyable Japanese BDSM romp with an attractive milf-like lead bound several times in those complex shibari things the Japanese love so much. There is plenty of nudity. And it has a real story line to boot.

Itis beautiful and disturbing.  There is no comedic relief.  The gorgeousNaomi Tani is absolute perfection.  This film is not for everyone.  Itis dark and touches on some very uncomfortable subjects besides the main BDSM storyline. Having said that, there are very few quality films withan actual storyline dealing with BDSM.  This is the best I have ever seen.The quality of the look and feel, is that of a big budget film.  As with my review of Flower & Snake '74, this is worth having- even if just for Naomi Tani.

578196,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00005AQ50,Zack Davisson,"[5, 5]","Oh Naomi, how many times must you be bound, tortured and forced before you realize how much you love it? Apparently many, many times.Naomi Tani, taking her name from the classic Junichiro Tanizaki novelNaomi, made her career in the Nikkatsu Studios notorious ""pink"" SM films. This woman has probably been tied up and beaten more than anyone else alive. If you have the stomach for this sort of thing, then ""Wife to be Sacrificed"" (""Ikenie fujin"") is one of the best of the genre.Kunisada's wife, Akiko (Naomi Tani), left him three years ago due to his violent temper. Kunisada has bided his time, until he could reclaim what is his. Kidnapping her, he takes her to a hidden cabin where he subjects her to a variety of humiliations, slowly breaking her will until she realizes that true love lies in abject submission to her husband. Along the way, they take in another couple, a failed double-suicide, and try to share their new found wisdom.The style of ""Wife to be Sacrificed,"" along with the performances of the actors, is what sets it apart from other films with similar plots. It is almost artistic in its pursuit of the boundaries of submission and love, taking itself very seriously. The eroticism is subdued, and is never explicit. While there is nudity, it is nothing even approaching ""hardcore.""Definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and there is more than enough here to offend, but if you like a bit of well-done SM, then ""Wife to be Sacrificed"" is for you.This DVD release is better than previous versions, including the documentary ""Sadistic and Masochistic"", a retrospective of director Masaru Konuma, the king of the genre and of course the director of ""Wife to be Sacrificed"" as well as the classic Flower and Snake.
