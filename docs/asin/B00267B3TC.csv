No one really rings all that true, either. So, you're left to wade through the film-making technique, which relies on a lot of time-shifting and flashbacks that become a bit confusing because they are so short and frequent. It takes awhile before it dawns on you who is who here besides the evil dad, Willem DaFoe, who looks the same in flashback and today. Julia Roberts doesn't have much to do, either, as the long-suffering mom who looks the other way at her husband's child abuse.

1251210,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00267B3TC,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[22, 27]","These are times in which movie audiences are subjected to extreme doses of special effects, action, animation, violence, sex and the like. And, in each category, the moviemakers are trying to outdo each other, in terms of being more innovative. So it is an immense risk to make old-fashioned dramas, not necessary romantic, but about life's daily struggles. Despite all the trends, they still need to be made, as to document our times. The very engaging ""Fireflies in Garden"" does just that: it is a painful and passionate look at a given modern family, like many others in this crazy planet.Right at the beginning of the film, we meet Michael Taylor (Ryan Reynolds, in a well-acted dramatic role), a successful writer that is on his way to his hometown to celebrate his mother Lisa's (Julia Roberts) graduation from college. Michael is kind of hard to read or understand, and you can feel that for some reason he is unwillingly going back home. Once he arrives to his hometown, tragedy strikes, and what was supposed to be a happy celebration turns into an incredibly sad occasion. Once in the house, facing the harsh reality in his life, he is sadly taken to his past and his relationship with his disturbingly strict father Charles (Willem Dafoe), a successful college professor of literature, who is being groomed to be the president of his prestigious teaching institution. Michael also has to re-examine his bonds with his sister Ryne (Shannon Lucio), and his aunt Jane (Emily Watson).Well-directed by Dennis Lee, ""Fireflies in Garden"" is about how the past defines the present, and the struggles that we have to endure to accept it. It goes right to the heart and I'm glad that I watched it. The DVD includes a making-of documentary.

1251213,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00267B3TC,Grady Harp,"[24, 24]","FIREFLIES IN THE GARDEN  is a perplexing movie. The story seems as though someone threw the script up in the air with the fireflies in the garden (a quite beautiful moment in the film that suggest the night gardens of John Singer Sergent's `Carnation Lily, Lily Rose'), shot it full of holes and then reassembled it the next groggy morning. Pieces are simply missing: we are informed that the original version is 122 minutes while this version is only 89 minutes and it is likely that in the missing 33 minutes many of the unresolved and very confusing elements of time and place and character development and perplexing moments existed.  Writer/Director Dennis Lee obviously had a fine story to share and a brilliant cast to offer it, but so much of it is missing that we are left frustrated.Successful Romance novelist Michael Taylor (Ryan Reynolds) has completed his latest novel, a work of serious memoir literature in which he has recounted his childhood in an attempt to free himself from the influence of his demonic father, English professor Charles Taylor (William Dafoe) who seriously abused Michael as a child and for whom he holds little emotion but disdain. Michael has returned home for the college graduation of his sister Ryne (Shannon Lucio) as well as his mother's - Lisa (Julia Roberts)  - deferred graduation. But the celebration is altered by an accident: Charles swerved to not hit his nephew Christopher (Chase Ellison), hit a pole resulting in a crash that killed Lisa and injured Charles and leaves Christopher with a dark cloud of guilt that he caused the trauma.We gradually meet the family: Lisa's sister Jane (Emily Watson) is the mother of Christopher and his little sister and has always been the closest friend of Michael when they were children (as children, Michael is portrayed by Cayden Boyd and Jane by Hayden Panettiere ),  At Lisa's funeral Michael's `ex-wife', AA reformed Kelly (Carrie-Anne Moss) shows up to add to Michael's angst.  From here the film jumps back and forth between the childhood of Michael and Jane and the suffering and abuse Michael endured at the hands of his grotesquely diabolical father and the secrets of that failed family life are gradually exposed and the traumatic present.  In cleaning out Lisa's things Michael discovers some information that alters his view of his past, and those discoveries lead to a change in the way Michael views his father and Jane's children and most significantly the demons that have burdened him through his life.In addition to the fine work by Reynolds, Watson, Dafoe, Roberts, and all the other cast members, there is an important cameo for Ioan Gruffudd that opens the murk of the story well.  Though this journey through the progress of a dysfunctional family has been done many times before and even frequently using the protagonist as a novelist about to open the secrets of the family's lives to the world, this story take some significant  alternative routes that make it more tender. The uses of flashbacks could have been better edited so that the audience is aware of when the character changes occur, and there are many unanswered questions about how each of these characters came to inhabit the human roles they present here.  But given the fact that the audience must stay completely alert during this film in order to follow this at times meandering story, this is a worthy film.  One wonders why the missing 33 minutes were not included in the American release (the film was made in 2007 and it seems as though it never played the theaters, going instead directly to DVD). With a cast of this caliber this should have been a popular film.  But where did those missing pages take us?

Teslovich,"[3, 8]","From the opening moments the overly exaggerated abusive father/husband seemed so unreal that the viewing audience is immediately skeptical of probably everything that will follow. Scenes such as leaving a young boy to jump out of a car in an isolated rural area, in the rain, to find his own way home. Also, calling a young boy a f-up was more laughable than enlightening. Then there was the scene when dad violently grabbed two young children by the fronts of their shirts and got into their faces. Story creation is one thing but trying to be over-the-top just for effect is cheap directing.Dialogue from the adults sounded simply juvenile stupid. Acting seemed so method school acting that I could predict the facial expression with just a piece of dialogue. I don't know what's going on with Roberts lately and Dafoe is just typecast stuck. Directing was boringly predictable - the lengthy camera shots of the distracted driver prior to the crash; the prolonged close up shots of the wedding ring.Always wary of movies with lots of ""Special Thanks"" for free stuff, 85 in this case of which my best two were to ""X Box"" and to ""Valdadice Pinot Grigio 2004 Wine"".Then there was the final explanation that every tragedy is preceded by any number of ""ifs"".

It's too bad because there's a lot of high quality acting and wonderful tone setting in this family drama.Tale focuses upon a romance novelist reflecting on his abusive time as a child in which his father verbally and physically abused him and put him through ""torture"" when he was displeased with the boy. Now, after the death of his mother, he has to face his father's anger as well as all of the other dysfunctional family members. He's got a novel written that is about his life growing up and basically lays out all the family dirt and he's trying to decide whether to get it published or not.There's a bittersweet taste to this film. At times you laugh, at times you feel like you just got hit in the gut and other times you feel people are going to work out their differences. It's one of those films that tries to reflect real life so sometimes there are no happy and complete resolutions but for myself I left the picture feeling satisfied with the delivery. It's nice to see a film every now and then that admits things aren't always resolved like a fairy tale. That's called fantasy, people. That said, I felt the main character worked things out just not in a Pollyanna manner.There's an all star cast here, including several who took supporting roles: Willem Dafoe, Julia Roberts, Carrie-Ann Moss, Emily Watson, Ryan Reynolds, Hayden Panettiere and Ioan Gruffud.The budget for this picture was $8M (which tells me a lot of big names took pay cuts to work on a project they believe in) but it only made a bit over $3M at the Box Office. We'll see if it does better in DVDs and residuals.Written and directed by Dennis Lee. Some say his tale is autobiographical. Note that the movie was edited and seems to be missing over 20 minutes so their may be a director's cut at a later point.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; THEMES/FAMILY FOCUSES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.",5,MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,2213,"['one', 'sleeper', 'high', 'quality', 'films', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'noticed', 'terribly', 'DVD', 'sales', 'simply', ""n't"", 'have', 'explosions', ""n't"", 'rom-com', 'was', ""n't"", 'recommended', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'too', 'bad', 'lot', 'high', 'quality', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'tone', 'setting', 'family', 'drama.Tale', 'romance', 'novelist', 'reflecting', 'abusive', 'time', 'child', 'father', 'verbally', 'physically', 'abused', 'put', 'torture', 'when', 'was', 'displeased', 'boy', 'Now', 'death', 'mother', 'face', 'father', 'anger', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'members', 'got', 'novel', 'written', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'basically', 'out', 'family', 'dirt', 'trying', 'decide', 'get', 'published', 'bittersweet', 'taste', 'film', 'times', 'laugh', 'times', 'feel', 'just', 'got', 'hit', 'gut', 'other', 'times', 'feel', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'differences', 'one', 'films', 'reflect', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'sometimes', 'are', 'happy', 'complete', 'resolutions', 'left', 'picture', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'delivery', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'now', 'then', 'admits', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'resolved', 'fairy', 'tale', 'called', 'fantasy', 'people', 'said', 'felt', 'main', 'character', 'worked', 'things', 'out', 'just', 'not', 'Pollyanna', 'star', 'cast', 'here', 'including', 'several', 'who', 'took', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Carrie-Ann', 'Moss', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'Ioan', 'Gruffud.The', 'budget', 'picture', 'was', '8M', 'lot', 'big', 'names', 'took', 'pay', 'cuts', 'work', 'project', 'believe', 'only', 'made', 'bit', '3M', 'Box', 'Office', ""'ll"", 'see', 'better', 'DVDs', 'residuals.Written', 'directed', 'Dennis', 'Lee', 'say', 'tale', 'autobiographical', 'Note', 'movie', 'was', 'edited', 'be', 'missing', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'may', 'be', 'director', 'cut', 'later', 'point.CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING', 'B', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'minus', 'THEMES/FAMILY', 'FOCUSES', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'mid', 'September', '2012', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'B', 'minus']",Fireflies in the Garden [Reg.2]

Superb acting by Ryan Reynolds and Julia Roberts but the best performance in the movie was Willem Dafoe's performance. He plays the cold and mean father to the T. I saw the movie in 2008.
