Ripping-off theatrical hits was nothing new for series television, but ""Alias Smith and Jones,"" though perhaps only intended to cash-in on the success of the Paul Newman-Robert Redford hit, stood on its own two feet and is a bonafide, albeit unheralded, classic.The show's wit is reminiscent of ""Maverick"" in a way, and that's not surprising since it came from the same creator: Roy Huggins (who also gave us ""The Fugitive"").""Alias Smith and Jones"" excelled with fine writing and expert direction from such TV masters as Barry Shear and Jeff Corey. It also had a better than average lineup of guest stars with such luminaries as Burl Ives, Wally Cox, Walter Brennan, and even Sally Field turning up, and often more than once. The show's biggest appeal, however, was Pete Duel and Ben Murphy who had a definite chemistry as the two charming outlaws.The release of season one on DVD is the best news I've heard in a long time.

1039966,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000LPS2VS,Chrijeff,"[2, 2]","This light comic Western was probably consciously based onButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), but it creates a world and characters all its own and is perhaps the best note on which the great TV-Western era could have begun to go out.  Hannibal Heyes (Pete Duel) and Kid Curry (Ben Murphy), ""the two most successful outlaws in the history of the West,"" are the leaders of Wyoming's infamous Devil's Hole Gang.  Heyes is a born manipulator and con artist, a safecracker without peer, and a keen judge of human character; the Kid may be one of the fastest guns who ever lived.  But they're finding the outlaw trail a tougher one to ride: the safes are getting stronger, the posses more resolute, and the telegraph is everywhere.  So, after an unproductive tussle with a Brooker 440 safe, they make up their minds to go straight--if the Governor can be persuaded to issue them an amnesty: with $10,000 apiece on their heads, their only other option would be to leave the country.  An old friend, a former outlaw turned sheriff, acts as their go-between, but the Governor can't commit political suicide by giving them an amnesty right off: the banks and railroads are too mad at them.  So he lays down conditions: stay out of trouble for a year (or maybe more) and earn their freedom.  And in the course of the series they try to do just that--but it isn't easy.  Saddled by their sheriff friend with their unimaginative aliases of Smith (Heyes) and Jones (Curry), to which they subsequently add Joshua and Thaddeus, roaming from Wyoming to Texas and Mexico to Arizona and back again, locking horns with lawmen, other outlaws, bounty hunters, con artists, ordinary folks gone crooked, and the occasional murderer, and making their way by Heyes's poker skill and silver tongue and Curry's quick gunhand, they struggle to stay on the straight and narrow and start a new life.Lighter in tone than most Westerns of its era, AS&J; is still a delightful ride with plenty of fast action, and it's also full of complicated plots and cons (Sam Jaffe appears twice as a successful retired con man named Soapy who owes ""the boys"" a large favor) and occasional very close escapes.  It's also one of the all-time best ""buddy"" series ever filmed: Heyes and Curry's good-natured ribbing of each other and occasional friendly, low-key rivalry over a girl shows clearly that they know each other well and enjoy a mutual respect and affection.  The chemistry between Duel and Murphy is unmistakable, and Heyes's mobile face, safecracker's hands, and clear, bell-like voice, Curry's youthful features and way of looking sad just before he draws, and the seemingly utterly natural grace of movement both have, make them among the most attractive Western heroes ever to appear on the small screen.  To judge from what I've learned over 40-odd years of research into the American West, they're probably actually a much more accurate portrayal of outlawry than the vicious murderers seen in so much of the genre: probably 80% of Western outlaws weren't ""badmen,"" but jobless cowboys gone wrong, who'd drifted into the life from a love of action and adventure, a need to help out a friend or meet a temporary shortage of funds, often urged along by the stimulus of strong drink.  Heyes and Curry take great pride in the fact that ""When we were robbing banks we didn't kill people,"" which makes them very sympathetic and easy to root for.  (Trivia buffs may be interested to know that ""A Fistful of Diamonds"" was based on an actual incident: a ""genuine salted diamond field"" con was actually run in northwestern Colorado in 1872.)  Dozens of famous faces appear as guest stars, among them Burl Ives, Cesar Romero, Fernando Lamas (who also directs one segment), Susan Strasberg, Susan St. James, Diana muldaur, Forrest Tucker, Ramon Bieri, John Larch, John McGiver, Dana Elcar, L. Q. Jones, Med Florey, Gregory Sierra, Dub Taylor, Mark Lenard, Peter Breck, Pernell Roberts, Slim Pickens, James Drury, Alan Hale, Royal Dano, William Windom, J. D. Cannon ofMcCloud - Seasons 1 and 2(who appears twice as Bannerman Detective Harry Briscoe), Randolph Mantooth ofEmergency - Season One, Joseph Campanella, Keenan Wynn, Susan Oliver, Claudine Longet, Richard Anderson, Joan Hackett, Robert Donner, and Michele Carey (who appeared inEl Doradowith John Wayne, who in turn starred inChisum, the movie that introduced Duel's younger brother Geoffrey).  Lovers of Westerns, both light and serious, should enjoy this stylish series.",5,Two good badmen,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,4521,"['light', 'comic', 'Western', 'was', 'probably', 'consciously',

It may not be much, but compared to the non-existent special features on other old t.v. westerns, it's very, very welcome.I liked the way the main menu came up--it looks like a wanted poster is being hung, then bang, bang, bang, bang as four nails are being hammered in.I also really like the theme music and the music during the episodes.  This show is just so darn good-natured--you can't help but enjoy it.  Most of the episodes really do deal with the problems a couple of train robbers might encounter while trying to go straight.  Duel and Murphy play it just right--not too heavy and not too light.  They both just look so easy going and natural, and their friendship seems very real.  The characters of Heyes and Curry never come off as preachy or like martyrs--they just seem like two decent men who really do try to help out anyone in trouble.  They stand up for themselves, but in a smart way--they never seem cocky.  Heyes and Curry never blend into each other--they are two very distinct characters.It's an uneven season--there are some clunkers on disc two, but overall it's a great show.  Because it's over 30 years old, the episodes strech out towards 50 minutes, too, which is a plus for modern viewers.If you like buddy movies and buddy stories, you can't go wrong here.",5,Good fun,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1550,"['Glen', 'Larson', 'commentary', 'pilot', 'sparse', ""n't"", 'talk', 'most', 'time', 'talk', 'Duel', 'Murphy', 'much', 'have', 'interesting', 'historical', 'tidbits', 'info', 'was', 'going', 'minds', 'show', 'creators', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'compared', 'non-existent', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'old', 't.v', 'westerns', 'very', 'very', 'welcome.I', 'liked', 'way', 'main', 'menu', 'came', 'up', 'wanted', 'poster', 'being', 'hung', 'then', 'bang', 'bang', 'bang', 'bang', 'four', 'nails', 'are', 'being', 'hammered', 'in.I', 'also', 'really', 'theme', 'music', 'music', 'episodes', 'show', 'just', 'so', 'darn', 'good-natured', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'Most', 'episodes', 'really', 'do', 'deal', 'problems', 'couple', 'train', 'robbers', 'might', 'encounter', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'Duel', 'Murphy', 'play', 'just', 'right', 'not', 'too', 'heavy', 'not', 'too', 'light', 'just', 'look', 'so', 'easy', 'going', 'natural', 'friendship', 'very', 'real', 'characters', 'Heyes', 'Curry', 'never', 'come', 'off', 'preachy', 'martyrs', 'just', 'seem', 'two', 'decent', 'men', 'who', 'really', 'do', 'try', 'help', 'out', 'anyone', 'trouble', 'stand', 'up', 'smart', 'way', 'never', 'seem', 'cocky', 'Heyes', 'Curry', 'never', 'blend', 'other', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'distinct', 'characters.It', 'uneven', 'season', 'are', 'clunkers', 'disc', 'two', 'overall', 'great', 'show', '30', 'years', 'old', 'episodes', 'strech', 'towards', '50', 'minutes', 'too', 'plus', 'modern', 'viewers.If', 'buddy', 'movies', 'buddy', 'stories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'here']",Alias Smith and Jones: Season One

What a great series with a great many stars....in this same episode Walter Brennan appeared. One of my favorite recurring actors was J.D. Cannon, the conniving detective. I have many of the series shows on several VHS from cable, but nothing can compare to the DVD.It's hard to believe the first season of Smith & Jones goes back to 1971, a much younger me watched them on TV. Much later I began to watch and tape them on Encore Westerns.  Now, finally, they are out on DVD and I have at long last received my own copy of the First Season. Goodbye VHS copies!Though I enjoy more 'serious' western fare too, this series due to the interplay between the actors and the relatively good scripts has always captured my attention. Even after the original twosome ended due to Duel's death, the new partnership took on a life of its own and it is impossible for me to say which set of two actors did best. I liked them both and I suppose that contributed to the longer running of the series.Well, here's to many more sets of their DVDs being released.  What a great series.  Now if Warner Bros. will only release a few more Cheyenne DVDs, hmmmm.Listed below are the entire contents of this 1st season:Disc 1The McCreedy Bust-Exit from WickenburgDisc 2Wrong Train to Brimstone-The Girl in Boxcar #3-The Great Shell Game-Return to Devil's HoleDisc 3A Fistful of Diamonds-Stagecoach Seven-The Man Who Murdered Himself-The Root of it AllDisc 4The 5th Victim-Journey from San Juan-Never Trust an Honest Man-The legacy of Charlie Ol'RourkeIf you are anything like me having seen these shows over-and-over, some of the above info may help you remember certain episodes.Semper Fi.",5,"1971, REALLY?

1039985,A3CGJJEJAW98YZ,B000LPS2VS,steveacoustic,"[4, 4]","I'd give this six stars if I could. I was fourteen years of age when Alias Smith and Jones first hit BBC2 (major terrestrial channel here in the UK) and the memory has stayed with me ever since. It was an instant success and the cheerful, self-effacing style of AS&J; was irresistable. At its height the British Broadcasting Corporation was receiving 5,000 letters a week demanding more episodes and rapid re-runs.For the first time we had a Western series that featured two amiable rogues as the lead characters. The level of scripting and the storylines were, for the most part, very original and highly intelligent, but what carried the series was the free-wheeling approach of the late Pete Duel (as Hannibal Heyes) and Ben Murphy (Kid Curry). Some of the stories involved quite sophisticated ""stings"", making it almost a Western version of the present-day Hustle, and clearly AS&J; was closely modelled on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (and a good premise at that).Watching the pilot episode is just so uplifting and reminded me just how good some classic television can be; it's not all about designer suits and hairstyles. And essentially, unlike many old TV series, AS&J; has not dated. It looks great, it's funny, uplifting and so refreshing in its approach. I'm not sure that anything's come near it since. The only negative point is that the sad and untimely death of Pete Duel cost the series a key player after he'd filmed around 32 episodes. The dozen or so that followed were of a similar quality but it wasn't easy to replace him, although Roger Davis made a gallant effort.I could start quoting memorable one-liners or dialogues from the series. I'll resist the temptation and just affirm that this is, without reservation, an excellent series. Buy it and enjoy it!

Universal has done a fine job the shows themselves look extremely good (with just a bit of dirt and grit during the opening montage for each episode--probably due to the original source elements). We get the entire first season of the series as well as the TV movie that essentially served as a pilot episode for the series. While the tone differed a bit from the pilot, the series is equally as good with top notch production values and acting.The story revolves around Hannibal Heyes (Pete Duel) and Kid Curry (Ben Murphy)a pair of robbers who never killed anyone as they broke the law (although interestingly, Roger Davis who went on to play Hannibal Heyes played a villian that WAS killed by Curry)during the regular season. They're given an option to go straight by the governor (they see a handbill offering amnesty to criminals who haven't committed any murders)--if they can stay clean for an entire year. It'll be their secret until the 12 months (probably in case it fails) are up but that also means the guys are fair game for bounty hunters who may discover their identity. Trouble follows them wherever they go though and they end up performing one good deed after another hoping that they don't get caught in the gun of someone's crosshairs since the original wanted poster still says ""Dead or Alive"".The first season set include the pilot movie plus the first 14 episodes of the show (the show was a mid-season replacement which is why it doesn't have a full season of 22-24 episodes). While clearly inspired by ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" the film achieves its own quirky tone by the first regular season episode. Duel and Murphy's charm and chemistry on camera is immediately evident. 30 plus years later the show still retains its charm.The show looks good in its first ever DVD presentation. Colors have faded a bit (but that's to be expected given the age of the show)and some of the stock footage (including the opening for the pilot)has some dirt, grit and a bit of wear and tear evident but overall the show looks darn good. The guest star list is a who's who of TV from the 70's including Early Holliman, Forrest Tucker and Susan Saint and James Drury--just in the pilot episode alone! Later guest stars would include Burl Ives, Slim Pickens and Sally Field among many others.The lone extra here is a commentary track by co-creator/co-writer/producer Glen A. Larson. While there are some stretches of silence Larson's comments are intelligent, observant and has trivia about how the series came to be produced. He notes that the amnesty plot that makes the series different from other westerns was real and, in fact, was offered to Butch and Sundance as well as the real Kid Curry. When news of the amnesty was delayed, they got mad and robbed a bank blowing their chance of receiving it!While we did getAlias Smith And Jones: Seasons 2 & 3the second set looks a bit rough at times (although the best looking episodes rival those seen here).

1039992,A3Q4XAQXKKV6V,B000LPS2VS,William Smith,"[27, 27]","I have all my ""biggies"" from the 70's. Columbo, Kung Fu, AITF, Rockford; I'm sure you guys know the long list. Anyway, I had never heard of this show much less ""seen"" it before. How can this be? This show is FANTASTIC!! I had some extra bucks laying around, plus I did like Pete Duel from Gidget even though I didn't care for the show; so I gambled. Well, the chemistry and writing are top notch, the story is interesting, and the humor is perfect, I couldn't be more pleased.Sadly, this isn't a full season of 22-24 eps, though 15 seems enough I suppose. The transfer quality is pretty good for a show this old, the sound is standard fare, but they really did a nice job with the boxart and ONE sided discs. Gary A. Larsons commentary is generally helpful (when he speaks) and I find it a bit funny he says this is ""one of his favorite shows"" he has produced, I had to read between the lines but when I saw he was also the creator of Night Rider, I quickly realized he meant this IS his favorite but he was too polite to say:) C'mon, Alias Smith and Jones... or drek from the 80's like Night Rider? Gah.As a side note; of course I am still generally shocked of Pete Duel's fate. I see his amazing smile, witness his relentless talent, and shake my head in disbelief.... how can it BE? R.I.P.

1039993,A3V2B0T4KJZ9GF,B000LPS2VS,Zagethe,"[22, 24]","This short-lived series was a small screen version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It offered appealing actors who had a great chemistry with each other. Please note that I am referring only to the eps that starred Pete Duel and Ben Murphy. Honestly, I couldnt bear to watch it after Pete died. I always found the decision to just stick another actor in the role like no one would care to be a crass mistake.Having recently re-watched the episodes I have to say its aged remarkably well. I think you really have to thank the writers for this. Oh sure, there's a few spots where you know its not a recent show (note the horrible music in a few eps) but overall you'd be hard pressed to date this 30+ year old show.Both actors are perfect in their roles as two ""pretty good bad men"" who are trying to go straight. They have to contend with not only lawmen, posses, and other outlaws, but their own less than sterling natures. Some eps focused on light comedy (The MacCreedy Bust) while others are starkly dramatic (The Bounty Hunter)Both were handled equally well by the cast.It offers something for everyone. Good writing/scripts, handsome outlaws, light comedy, drama/angst, and a hint of danger all set against the backdrop of the beautiful Southwest (yep, them are real locations..)If you are a fan of westerns you simply can't go wrong with this series.",5,The Best of the TV Westerns!,1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,1363,"['short-lived', 'series', 'was', 'small', 'screen', 'version', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'offered', 'appealing', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'other', 'Please', 'note', 'am', 'referring', 'only', 'eps', 'starred', 'Pete', 'Duel', 'Ben', 'Murphy', 'Honestly', 'couldnt', 'bear', 'watch', 'Pete', 'died', 'always', 'found', 'decision', 'just', 'stick', 'actor', 'role', 'one', 'would', 'care', 'be', 'crass', 'mistake.Having', 'recently', 're-watched', 'episodes', 'have', 'say', 'aged', 'remarkably', 'well', 'think', 'really', 'have', 'thank', 'writers', 'Oh', 'sure', 'few', 'spots', 'where', 'know', 'not', 'recent', 'show', 'note', 'horrible', 'music', 'few', 'eps', 'overall', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'date', '30+', 'year', 'old', 'show.Both', 'actors', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'two', 'pretty', 'good', 'bad', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'have', 'contend', 'not', 'only', 'lawmen', 'posses', 'other', 'outlaws', 'own', 'less', 'sterling', 'natures', 'eps', 'focused', 'light', 'comedy', 'MacCreedy', 'Bust', 'others', 'are', 'starkly', 'dramatic', 'Bounty', 'Hunter', 'Both', 'were', 'handled', 'equally', 'well', 'cast.It', 'something', 'everyone', 'Good', 'writing/scripts', 'handsome', 'outlaws', 'light', 'comedy', 'drama/angst', 'hint', 'danger', 'set', 'backdrop', 'beautiful', 'Southwest', 'yep', 'are', 'real', 'locations..', 'are', 'fan', 'westerns', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'series']",Alias Smith and Jones: Season One
