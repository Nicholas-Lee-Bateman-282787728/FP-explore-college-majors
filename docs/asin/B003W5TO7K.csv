To be short: don't read reviews, don't judge the movie until you actually see it with your own eyes. To me the movie was so much fun. This is the first ''The Lost Boys'' movie that I had seen and I loved it. After this movie I decided to get the first two movies as well. I loved the story, the werewolf female especially. They must do the 4th movie. I am looking forward for it. I really want to know what happens not just with vampires but also other creatures. I liked the actors and there is really nothing what I've disliked in the movie. The main Frog brother however does look a little childish, but that was for fun. Since it's not really a horror movie. The soundtrack for the movie was nothing new to me. But as I know those songs, I must say they are very good. So if any of you will not like the movie, the soundtrack will be a good treat for you.",5,Why so many bad reviews?,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,950,"['thought', 'avoiding', 'movie', 'other', 'reviews', 'finally', 'gave', 'up', 'idea', 'be', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'movie', 'actually', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'loved', 'movie', 'decided', 'get', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'well', 'loved', 'story', 'werewolf', 'female', 'especially', 'must', 'do', '4th', 'movie', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'not', 'just', 'vampires', 'also', 'other', 'creatures', 'liked', 'actors', 'really', 'nothing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'disliked', 'movie', 'main', 'Frog', 'brother', 'however', 'look', 'little', 'childish', 'was', 'fun', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'know', 'songs', 'must', 'say', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'So', 'will', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'treat']",N/A

It's worse than ""Troll 2,"" since it fails to entertain even by accident.So I am damning ""Lost Boys: The Thirst"" with faint praise when I say that it is substantially better in every way. This second sequel to the classic 1980s vampire movie at least knows that it's stupid, cheesy and goofy, so it runs all the way -- expect parodies of reality TV and of romanticized vampire teen lit.While selling comic books to make ends meet, Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) is approached by Gwen Lieber (Tanit Phoenix), a vacuous writer of teen vampire romances. She has a pretty typical problem: her brother has been kidnapped by the evil DJ X (Seb Castang), who is disguising vampire blood as a new designer drug called ""The Thirst."" In just a few days, X and his minions will be hosting a rave at a nearby island.Edgar isn't really interested. But when she says that the alpha vampire will be at the rave, he becomes intrigued by the idea of wiping out all vampires -- and freeing half-vampires like his brother Alan (Jamison Newlander).With the help of his friend Zoe (Casey B. Dolan), Edgar sets out to the island to take out DJ X. Unfortunately, not only do they have the idiot Gwen along for the ride, but a meathead reality star (Steven van Niekerk) who doesn't believe that vampires actually exist. Will the Frog Brothers finally triumph, or will they free the world from vampires once and for all?Good news: ""Lost Boys: The Thirst"" is a much, much better movie than ""The Tribe."" Bad news: It's... well, it's still not very good.In fact, most of the movie feels like a tepid build-up to the rave and the inevitable battle with DJ X, with the characters just sort of wandering around, gathering weapons. Occasionally vampires will pop out and attack them, followed by some bad one-liners (""It turns holy water into holy slaughter!"") and the vampires literally squealing like pigs before they combust.However, the movie at least seems aware of how dumb it is. So it also takes the opportunity to mock reality TV (""It's also haunted... by cannibal pirates!""), and the hyper-romanticized vampire tween books. Gwen is basically Stephenie Meyer in a teeny-weeny bikini.Things only speed up when the heroes actually get to the rave, in the last twenty minutes or so of the movie -- which is when we find out the so-obvious-it-hurts twist involving the alpha vampire. He seems awfully weak for the top-dog of the entire vampire species.Corey Feldman still sounds like he's been gargling with gravel, but he gives a fun intensity to the entire film -- although I can't quite buy that two super-attractive women would practically claw each other's faces over him. Dolan gives a pretty decent performance as his sidekick/friend/love interest.But honestly, most of the rest of the actors are chewing scenery so hard that they have splinters lodged between their teeth -- Tanit Phoenix in particular looks like the porn version of a bestselling author, and Steven van Niekerk is so annoying that he simply cannot die fast enough.""The Lost Boys: The Thirst"" has some fun moments -- mostly from the spoofery and Feldman -- but most of it is solidly below mediocre. While not horrendous, it's bad enough to avoid.",2,Leaves you without a thirst,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,3281,"['Lost', 'Boys', 'Tribe', 'dubious', 'honor', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'sequels', 'time', 'worse', 'Troll', '2', 'entertain', 'even', 'accident.So', 'am', 'damning', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Thirst', 'faint', 'praise', 'when', 'say', 'substantially', 'better', 'way', 'second', 'sequel', 'classic', '1980s', 'vampire', 'movie', 'least', 'knows', 'stupid', 'cheesy', 'goofy', 'way', 'expect', 'parodies', 'reality', 'TV', 'romanticized', 'vampire', 'teen', 'lit.While', 'selling', 'comic', 'books', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'approached', 'Gwen', 'Lieber', 'Tanit', 'Phoenix', 'vacuous', 'writer', 'teen', 'vampire', 'romances', 'pretty', 'typical', 'problem', 'brother', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'evil', 'DJ', 'X', 'Seb', 'Castang', 'who', 'disguising', 'vampire', 'blood', 'new', 'designer', 'drug', 'called', 'Thirst', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'X', 'minions', 'will', 'be', 'hosting', 'rave', 'nearby', 'island.Edgar', ""n't"", 'really', 'interested', 'when', 'alpha', 'vampire', 'will', 'be', 'rave', 'intrigued', 'idea', 'wiping', 'out', 'vampires', 'freeing', 'half-vampires', 'brother', 'Alan', 'Jamison', 'Newlander', '.With', 'help', 'friend', 'Zoe', 'Casey', 'B.', 'Dolan', 'Edgar', 'out', 'island', 'take', 'out', 'DJ', 'X', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'idiot', 'Gwen', 'ride', 'meathead', 'reality', 'star', 'Steven', 'van', 'Niekerk', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'vampires', 'actually', 'exist', 'Will', 'Frog', 'Brothers', 'finally', 'triumph', 'will', 'free', 'world', 'vampires', 'once', 'Good', 'news', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Thirst', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'Tribe', 'Bad', 'news', 'well', 'still', 'not', 'very', 'good.In', 'fact', 'most', 'movie', 'feels', 'tepid', 'build-up', 'rave', 'inevitable', 'battle', 'DJ', 'X', 'characters', 'just', 'sort', 'wandering', 'around', 'gathering', 'weapons', 'Occasionally', 'vampires', 'will', 'pop', 'out', 'attack', 'followed', 'bad', 'one-liners', 'holy', 'water', 'holy', 'slaughter', 'vampires', 'literally', 'squealing', 'pigs', 'combust.However', 'movie', 'least', 'aware', 'how', 'dumb', 'also', 'opportunity', 'mock', 'reality', 'TV', 'also', 'haunted', 'cannibal', 'pirates', 'hyper-romanticized', 'vampire', 'tween', 'books', 'Gwen', 'basically', 'Stephenie', 'Meyer', 'teeny-weeny', 'bikini.Things', 'only', 'speed', 'up', 'when', 'heroes', 'actually', 'get', 'rave', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'so-obvious-it-hurts', 'twist', 'involving', 'alpha', 'vampire', 'awfully', 'weak', 'top-dog', 'entire', 'vampire', 'species.Corey', 'Feldman', 'still', 'been', 'gargling', 'gravel', 'fun', 'intensity', 'entire', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'buy', 'two', 'super-attractive', 'women', 'would', 'practically', 'claw', 'other', 'Dolan', 'pretty', 'decent', 'performance', 'sidekick/friend/love', 'interest.But', 'honestly', 'most', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'so', 'hard', 'have', 'splinters', 'lodged', 'teeth', 'Tanit', 'Phoenix', 'particular', 'looks', 'porn', 'version', 'bestselling', 'author', 'Steven', 'van', 'Niekerk', 'so', 'annoying', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'fast', 'enough', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Thirst', 'fun', 'moments', 'mostly', 'spoofery', 'Feldman', 'most', 'solidly', 'mediocre', 'not', 'horrendous', 'bad', 'enough', 'avoid']",N/A

However, as the movie developed, the acting and dialogue got at least marginally better.The plot regresses into nostalgia as there are lots of flashbacks to the original as Mr. Feldman recalls better times with the Frog Brothers. I think a lot of it was a tribute to Corey Haim as he had plenty of screen time in those flashbacks. As for the plot, Mr. Frog is called back into action when a new vampire threat comes to town. Of course, he is broke, bitter, and going nowhere until a bitchin' babe lures him back into action. He does a passable Snake Pliskin with his little growls that top off some of the dialogue exchanges between him and the other characters.There was nothing particularly challenging about this story. Though I pretty much hate vampire movies, this one was different enough that it kept me from turning it off. Part of that was nostalgia, part was a chance to see Mr. Feldman in action again, and part was because I like schlocky horror movies. I don't usually consider vampire stories as horror, but this one didn't stray too far into just another bloody romance, as most vampire stories seem to do.

The Thirst is a major step in the right direction. This film is more of a Frog Brothers film than a Lost Boys film. It's more in the vein of a horror/action picture than a straight horror picture. Honestly, I feel The Thirst kind of has an Expendables feel to it, with a more comedic tone. Feldman and Newlander give very likeable and well-balanced performances. The girl who helps the Frog Brothers fight the vampires also does a great job, and I'd like to see her character reappear if a sequal is made. My only compaint with the Thirst is that the main gang of vampires look like bratty, rich-kid, reality show wannabees. This detail is kind of rectified though, but I won't say anymore.

The overall acting is pretty bad.  The story is predictable with lots of stereotypical characters.  There are some good scenes and the vampires overall look pretty cool with their red eyes.  They could have made the story more believable quite easily, makes you wonder who (or what-could have been a room full of monkeys on typewriters!).  A few examples: Cory Feldman gets stabbed with a sword in a spot that had to have punctured his lungs and likely severed his brachial plexus-i.e. he would not have been able to move his arm and he would not have been able to breath and would have bled out pretty quickly and died.  Instead, he is carried to the beach and falls asleep for an hour and then has full function restored to his arm and perfect breathing!  Whew, quick healer!  Also, the ""climactic"" scene when the Frog brothers are battling the head honcho vampire there are around a thousand vampires being held back by a rusty chain link fence when they are supposed to be ten times stronger than a gorilla.  This is probably a 2.5 movie just for the flashbacks and some of the action but it is definitely not a 5 or a 1.  Any of the blades would be a much better choice but if your are nostalgic for the 80's you could do worse than rent this, I wouldn't ever need to see it again.  Also at least for the DVD, there is no way to skip the previews (you can fast forward but not skip or hit menu button); the menu screen has two choices 1. play movie and 2 languages.

People are too harsh on these sequels forgetting that they are very low budget movies. The vampires look fine however unlike other films in this series they suddenly develop ghoul teeth , instead of the traditional two fangs. I have read some ridiculous reviews here in which people complain about Feldmans voice, hello he did that in the original movie too, hence the inside joke 'frog brothers'.  I enjoyed this one and found nothing wrong with it at all , I love horror flicks and enjoy them all the back to the silent era so this fits in with the many low budget pleasures I have enjoyed over the years.  Of course this originates from a modern horror classic; which is why people are so harsh on this. Effects wise this looks fine for today. ( I can't stand it when someone reviews a much older movie and complains about effects that's just lame but this is a modern flick so it's valid) The story is about vamps at raves , (god that music is terrible though , mindless bleeps and blorps made by machines) who want to take create a army of emo goth vamps. Which is pretty funny and the idea of a twilight type author involved with this story is a good one.  This is low budget vamp horror with some added humor and that's good enough for me. The blu ray has a interview with the frog brothers, and a made for tv documentary with charisma carpenter who should have been in this movie. She's a excellent actress.  The blu way is the way to go on any movie , This is the type of flick that teenage girls who want romance won't like. The vamps are all creeps and it's done for fun.  That reminds me ,where's 'vamp' on blu ray?. That was a hollywood vampire movie that rises way above it's budget.  One thing that did terrify me here in this movie was the scene in which feldman puts a 'batman number 15' on a grave, the late cory haims characters grave. (Haim ;rest in peace; was destroyed by drugs sadly). old comics belong in collections not on graves! that was a scary scene for sure.  The blu ray looks excellent and imo if you can afford a blu ray always go that way unless it's a cleaned up critireon movie.

I couldn't wait...and got an early pre-order yesterday.  I've seen it twice already.  The DVD is a real bare bones affair, and could have been a little more with a few special features, deleted scenes or even a chapter select...but it has none of that stuff save for a little 'documentary' on the appeal of the vampire hosted by Charisma Carpenter that is entertaining enough.  This movie is fun fun fun!  Brilliantly paced, surprisingly well directed, and writing that might just make this franchise live on.  The only glaring problems where with the cast, but the writing endeared the characters to the viewer so much that it was forgivable.  Make no mistake...this film is a direct to dvd horror sequel that comes out in October.  Normally this would scream 'avoid' like it has with the recent 'Dark Days' vampire fare.  But this is the horror fans gift from Cory Feldman, who produced and stars in the gem.  In fact for me it was the witty writing that defines the cool of this film  At times a bit self referential but never to much so and done as so to truly continue a mythology from the first film, that of Edgar Frog.  The lighting was cool and atmospheric, and the soundtrack is simply killer.  I think the soundtrack of the first film captured the era well, and it is obvious the when defining a new era, you must use the sounds of its time, Lost Boys: The Thirst does that well...just a kick ass soundtrack.  The Frog brothers have become a big cult favorite not only because of the first film, but also the semi classic ""Reign of Frogs"" comic.  But when it really comes down to it..who buys these films?  The horror fan...people like me.  This movie delivers everything you could want.  The vampires are preternatural and uber creepy yet super sexy.  The editing is seamless and the frights are fast and fun.  Gore hounds...it's for you too.  There is not a whole lot new here...in fact outside of the cool character development the story is just run of the mill...but it's the whole of the film that works.  It's campy but not too much so, it builds a fun and dangerous world for Edgar Frog, and brings the Lost Boys franchise into a more modern time.A true surprise, one that I was looking forward to.

He is hired by a Stephanie Meyer-esque bookwriter, who also shares a similar, unrealistic take on vampires, to find her brother, who was kidnapped by bloodsuckers. Joing him on this perilous mission are a comic book friend, the author herself, and an idiotic reality TV host. ""The Thirst"" feels more like a true sequel to the original film than ""The Tribe"", but that doesn't stop it from being, for the most part, a pretty crappy movie. On the upside, Corey Feldman's Edgar Frog is the star of this one, rather than the integral but small role he had in ""The Tribe"". Additionally, Jamison Newlander also returns as brother Alan Frog, but sadly in a more minor role. Also, this entry has a more big-budget feel than the last movie, giving it a comfortable sense of professionalism. Most of the small-scale action scenes are pretty entertaining as well, and the iconic song ""Cry Little Sister"" returns as well. Sadly, most everything else is way down hill. The vampires are overacting hipsters who are far from threatening. The heavy-duty violence and gore featured in ""The Tribe"" is now gone in favor of some squirting blood here and there. There are also disguised but obvious, and negative, references to the ""Twilight"" series. Yes all of us true horror fans feel the same way about that, but adding such references to this movie feels out of place. Another thing; ALL THE VAMPIRES DIE THE SAME! This really drove me nuts, as it was well-established in the first two films that vamps all die in elaborate, unique ways; here they all lamely burst into ash ""Blade""-style. Lastly, what drove me insane about this was the writing and dialogue. My God, the dialogue and one-liners in this movie are just painful to hear, from The Frog Brothers' quirky lines to vampiric monologues, most of what I heard hurt me a quite a bit. And don't even get me started on the asinine, out-of-place ending.

The movie then goes into a wonderful title/credit roll with blood being splattered to techno-metal music with a ""Rave"" going on in the background. Edgar (Corey Feldman) lives in a trailer and is selling his comic book collection in order to avoid eviction. He is at home in a comic book shop the way Pee Wee Herman was at home in a bicycle shop. A woman (Anne Rice?) comes up to him and offers him money to save her brother (and the world) from vampires. It seems vampires are holding ""Raves"" where they play techno-metal dance music and they hand out vials of vampire blood which turns the kids into an army of vampires. The drinking of the blood also has the effect of repelling clothing from silicon (brief nudity).The lines are corny and border on redneck. The movie also spoofs Rambo, reality shows, and perhaps a few other things I didn't catch. Good simple unsophisticated humor along with a vampire story with a twist.

1368333,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B003W5TO7K,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[1, 2]","The good news, such as it is, is that Lost Boys: The Thirst is not as abysmally bad as Lost Boys: The Tribe was. But given that Tribe was arguably one of the worst sequels ever made, this isn't saying a whole lot. Lost Boys: The Thirst still falls far short of actually being good. The shame is that it could have been so much better.The story this time around takes place in the California town of San Cazador where Edgar Frog (Cory Feldman) is on the verge of being evicted from his trailer. Edgar is so desperate for money he sells off what's left of his comic book collection at a store where his friend Zoe (winningly played by Casey Dolan) works. When he returns to his trailer, he finds Gwen Lieber (Tanit Phoenix), a famous author of romantic vampire novels, waiting for him with an offer. She needs him to rescue her brother, Peter (Felix Mosse) who has been kidnapped by a gang of vampires, headed by rave personality DJX (Seb Castang) who, as chance would have it, is apparently going to be throwing his next rave in San Cazador. And adding to the mix is a hyper-egoed reality-show star Lars Van Goetz (Steven Van Niekirk) and his much put-upon cameraman Claus (Joe Vaz) whom Lieber forces Edgar to take along with him on the rescue mission.The Thirst does have some good things in it. Cory Feldman once again reprises his role as Edgar Frog, this time as a grumpy world-weary vampire-killer who really just wants to be left alone. And as always, Feldman does throw everything he's got into the role. Some of the best bits are clearly Feldman ad-libbing as he deadpans that ""All reality shows are fake!"" (riffing on his own former reality show, The Two Coreys) and ""There's nothing sexy about vampires!"" (ranking on the Twilight movies as well).  And Jamison Newlander actually has some scenes this time around as Edgar's brother Alan, who is living a shadow life as something of a half-vampire, having been turned in a flashback sequence we see early on in the film. Given the years that have passed, Newlander actually does a good job of reprising his Alan Frog character, bringing back some of the feel of the original Lost Boys in the few scenes he's in. Casey Dolan brings some much-needed vitality and freshness to the film as Zoe, Edgar's patient and enduring friend who clearly wants to be more than just a friend even if Edgar apparently has no clue.  And there was one imaginative scene early on where the vampires jump from a private plane and land in San Cazador under their own power, a nice throwback to the train trestle scene in the original film.But in spite of the good elements you can see in The Thirst, as a film The Thirst plods along in a listless mechanical fashion that even the occasional action sequence fails to alleviate. This is, again, clearly the fault of the director, Dario Piana, and the writers, Evan Charnov and Hans Rodionoff. Why Dario Piana was chosen to direct in the first place is a complete mystery as prior to this his experience largely consisted of writing for Italian television. And judging by The Thirst, he has no feel for anything as a director. The pacing was listless, the scenes mechanical, the action sequences stiff and stagey, and worst of all, the style completely lacking the kind of humor that was one of the best things about the original Lost Boys. You can see Feldman and Dolan and the other cast members trying their best but nothing they do can overcome Piana's leaden dulling direction. Or the lame script and banal dialogue they're lumbered with.And once again, like they did in The Tribe, the actors cast as the vampires for The Thirst are, with a single exception, much too old to be 'boys'.  Seb Castang was 30 when the film was made.  Most of the others were obviously in their 20's or 30's.  Contrast this with the original Lost Boys, where the main characters were meant to be teenagers and they looked it as the actors playing the parts were all between 15 and 21, except for the youngest one - ""Laddie"" - who was 10.Only recommended for the most die-hard fans of the original classic Lost Boys and of the Frog brothers, Cory Feldman and Jamison Newlander.",2,"Not as bad as LB: The Tribe, but still far short of good",1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,4142,"['good', 'news', 'such', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Thirst', 'not', 'abysmally', 'bad', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Tribe', 'was', 'given', 'Tribe', 'was', 'arguably', 'one', 'worst', 'sequels', 'ever', 'made', ""n't"", 'saying', 'whole', 'lot', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Thirst', 'still', 'far', 'short', 'actually', 'being', 'good', 'shame', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.The', 'story', 'time', 'around', 'place', 'California', 'town', 'San', 'Cazador', 'where', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'Cory', 'Feldman', 'verge', 'being', 'evicted', 'trailer', 'Edgar', 'so', 'desperate', 'money', 'off', 'what', 'left', 'comic', 'book', 'collection', 'store', 'where', 'friend', 'Zoe', 'winningly', 'played', 'Casey', 'Dolan', 'When', 'trailer', 'Gwen', 'Lieber', 'Tanit', 'Phoenix', 'famous', 'author', 'romantic', 'vampire', 'novels', 'waiting', 'offer', 'rescue', 'brother', 'Peter', 'Felix', 'Mosse', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'gang', 'vampires', 'headed', 'rave', 'personality', 'DJX', 'Seb', 'Castang', 'who', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'apparently', 'going', 'be', 'throwing', 'next', 'rave', 'San', 'Cazador', 'adding', 'mix', 'hyper-egoed', 'reality-show', 'star', 'Lars', 'Van', 'Goetz', 'Steven', 'Van', 'Niekirk', 'much', 'put-upon', 'cameraman', 'Claus', 'Joe', 'Vaz', 'whom', 'Lieber', 'forces', 'Edgar', 'take', 'along', 'rescue', 'mission.The', 'Thirst', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'Cory', 'Feldman', 'once', 'again', 'role', 'Edgar', 'Frog', 'time', 'grumpy', 'world-weary', 'vampire-killer', 'who', 'really', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'always', 'Feldman', 'throw', 'everything', 'got', 'role', 'best', 'bits', 'are', 'clearly', 'Feldman', 'ad-libbing', 'reality', 'shows', 'are', 'fake', 'riffing', 'own', 'former', 'reality', 'show', 'Two', 'Coreys', 'nothing', 'sexy', 'vampires', 'ranking', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'Jamison', 'Newlander', 'actually', 'scenes', 'time', 'around', 'Edgar', 'brother', 'Alan', 'who', 'living', 'shadow', 'life', 'something', 'half-vampire', 'having', 'been', 'turned', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'see', 'early', 'film', 'Given', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Newlander', 'actually', 'good', 'job', 'reprising', 'Alan', 'Frog', 'character', 'bringing', 'back', 'feel', 'original', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'few', 'scenes', 'Casey', 'Dolan', 'much-needed', 'vitality', 'freshness', 'film', 'Zoe', 'Edgar', 'patient', 'enduring', 'friend', 'who', 'clearly', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'friend', 'even', 'Edgar', 'apparently', 'clue', 'was', 'one', 'imaginative', 'scene', 'early', 'where', 'vampires', 'jump', 'private', 'plane', 'land', 'San', 'Cazador', 'own', 'power', 'nice', 'throwback', 'train', 'trestle', 'scene', 'original', 'film.But', 'spite', 'good', 'elements', 'can', 'see', 'Thirst', 'film', 'Thirst', 'plods', 'along', 'listless', 'mechanical', 'fashion', 'even', 'occasional', 'action', 'sequence', 'alleviate', 'again', 'clearly', 'fault', 'director', 'Dario', 'Piana', 'writers', 'Evan', 'Charnov', 'Hans', 'Rodionoff', 'Why', 'Dario', 'Piana', 'was', 'chosen', 'direct', 'first', 'place', 'complete', 'mystery', 'prior', 'experience', 'largely', 'consisted', 'writing', 'Italian', 'television', 'judging', 'Thirst', 'feel', 'anything', 'director', 'pacing', 'was', 'listless', 'scenes', 'mechanical', 'action', 'stiff', 'stagey', 'worst', 'style', 'completely', 'lacking', 'kind', 'humor', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'original', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'can', 'see', 'Feldman', 'Dolan', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'trying', 'best', 'nothing', 'do', 'can', 'overcome', 'Piana', 'leaden', 'dulling', 'direction', 'lame', 'script', 'banal', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'lumbered', 'with.And', 'once', 'again', 'did', 'Tribe', 'actors', 'cast', 'vampires', 'Thirst', 'are', 'single', 'exception', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'be', ""'boys"", 'Seb', 'Castang', 'was', '30', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Most', 'others', 'were', 'obviously', '20', '30', 'Contrast', 'original', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'where', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'teenagers', 'looked', 'actors', 'playing', 'parts', 'were', '15', '21', 'youngest', 'one', 'Laddie', 'who', 'was', '10.Only', 'recommended', 'most', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'original', 'classic', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Frog', 'brothers', 'Cory', 'Feldman', 'Jamison', 'Newlander']",N/A
