The first half is consistently funny, with many jokes about the white trash rednecks who populate the town that the movie is set in. However, the riffers seem to run out of the steam later on in the film with less jokes. I can't blame them though, as the movie does get pretty boring later on and there really isn't much to joke about. Most of the cheesy stuff does happen earlier in the movie, after all. Still, this one is definitely worth seeing for fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Rifftrax.",4,Another Solid Rifftrax Episode,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,603,"['time', 'guys', 'Rifftrax', 'take', 'Galaxy', 'Invader', 'bad', 'sci-fi', '/', 'horror', 'movie', '80', 'first', 'half', 'consistently', 'funny', 'many', 'jokes', 'white', 'trash', 'rednecks', 'who', 'populate', 'town', 'movie', 'set', 'However', 'riffers', 'seem', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'later', 'film', 'less', 'jokes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'though', 'movie', 'get', 'pretty', 'boring', 'later', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'joke', 'about', 'Most', 'cheesy', 'stuff', 'happen', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Still', 'one', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fans', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'Rifftrax']",Rifftrax: Galaxy Invader
1525146,A294EVB54EEMA2,B0072VFXN4,evol_v,"[0, 0]","Have to disagree with the other reviewers here. This movie was good fodder for riffing, with horrible acting, stupid gun-crazy hicks and a morally ambivalent lizard alien whose presence in the inbred-est part of Maryland goes completely unexplained. &#34;Galaxy Invader&#34; indeed. More like Galaxy Trespasser. The dumb hicks deal with him easily enough. And there's only one of him. No invasion to speak of.Mike, Kevin and Bill on a good day could have wrought comedy gold from this, as they did with the similar Giant Spider Invasion. Alas, it wasn't a good day, so much, when they riffed Galaxy Invasion. They get off a few good shots, but something in their tone is a little too aggressive. They seem more irritated than normal, and the barbs come off as bullying rather than teasing. Also, they try to make dumb things funny by repeating them over and over. Most unforgivable is the bad singing over the credits. (Hint for next time: if a name isn't particularly funny, or even if it is, you won't make it funnier by screeching it in an atonal voice for four minutes. They could have just handed the movie to a six year old, with equally unfunny and annoying results.)Don't get me wrong, I still love the guys, and I will watch this one again at some point, to see if it grows on me, but this one is not their best.

1525148,A121660P9WJSER,B0072VFXN4,"Hose Nose ""B-film buff""","[0, 0]","I LOVE Don Dohler's work. The man was hero of sorts and an inspiration to kids like myself back in the late 70's/early80's who were aspiring to be little Steven Spielberg juniors using our parents' Super8mm home movie cameras. His work was semi-regularly featured in the awesome Starlog sister publication, CineMagic. I recall this film being released on home vdieo back in the late 80's/early 90's in 2 different versions. Same cover art and back of the box descriptions. Only difference was the tagline on the front of the box. Originally, it read something along the lines of &#34;He came to earth. His goal? To survive!&#34;  When folks didn't seem to respond to the idea of a kindly alien who wasn't ET, the box's end tagline was re-worded so that his goal was &#34;To KILL!!!&#34; LOL.This film may be a chore to watch for those not accustomed to the desperate, hard times/no money offerings from Dohler who, (along with a handful of others), was miraculously able to turn what were essentially home movies into legit home video releases. If you can get into his work then you're in luck since the film is available without the RiffTrax voiceovers, allowing you to watch it as it was intended. If this stuff isn't your cup of tea, then the MST3K-cum-RiffTrax crew will help make it a little more palatable with a heaping helping of their stinging riffs. I love seeing this both ways.

1525149,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B0072VFXN4,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[12, 12]","While out in the woods a young student sees a fireball crash into a deeper part of the woods so he calls his former professor who answers the phone shirtless and he says he'll be there in six hours (I don't know why, maybe shirt wearing was something he never mastered and it takes him a while). The fireball was of course a spaceship and the alien inside comes out to explore and by explore I mean kill, then kill, then kill, then get captured by some drunken hicks (are there ever any other kind in these films?). The professor and the student try to get clues to the whereabouts of the alien (even asking a bartender in a full bar very non-discreetly I might add) and we can't forget Joe a drunken father with a hole in his shirt who loves to hunt his daughter with a shotgun and yell at his 40 year old simple minded son.The movie is quite a mess as you can imagine, there isn't one likeable character in the film, the cheesy clothed style of filming is very annoying, as is the night shooting scenes and the endless padding just to reach 80 minutes of running time. Thankfully the Rifftrax crew does a spectacular job slamming the many horrid aspects of the movie, they keep the jokes coming fast and furious and I was laughing non-stop during a lot of the movie.

1525151,A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B0072VFXN4,Otto Correct,"[6, 6]","Its a shame Amazon doesn't even have a picture of this on its item page, I think this Rifftrax DVD in particular deserves a bit more attention than its getting.Simply put, this is a fantastic entry into their catalogue and a welcome addition to the DVD collection of anyone who's been missing MST3k.Speaking of MST3k, Galaxy Invader has actually appeared on the show before, though not as a full episode.  Observant fans will recognize Galaxy Invader as the ""other movie"" that played during the credits of ""Pod People.""Galaxy Invader's plot is fairly simple:  An alien lands in a cartoon fireball and runs afoul of a disgusting drunken redneck and several of his ugly family members and friends.  They want to kill/capture the alien and use it to get rich, while a kid who saw the fireball and his professor want to save the alien from the rednecks.  Complications ensue, the alien probably dies, the redneck definitely dies, and the movie grinds to a halt without really doing anything to tell us why the alien came here in the first place.  I mean, sure, its called ""Galaxy Invader"" so you could infer the alien was supposed to be invading Earth, but he mostly attacks in retaliation to his redneck agressors, he doesn't really seem to personally be there to fight.This movie is from the mid 80's, though the styles and character types reek of the 70's.  The characters themselves are quite a revolting bunch, most of them make the family from ""Giant Spider Invasion"" look like British royalty.  There's one point where the drunk rednecks equally drunk brother (or something, I can't remember how they know each other) takes the cigar out of his mouth and drools about a quarter cup of spit straight on the ground.  He doesn't spit, he actually DROOLS on camera, in such a casual, ""this is completely normal"" way that I'm not even sure it was on purpose.  You get the feeling a lot of these actors were just as disgusting in real life as they are in this movie.Given the abundance of riffing material, it should come as no surprise that Mike and Co. have a field day with all the disgusting redneck characters and squalid settings.  If you enjoyed MST3k episodes like ""Giant Spider Invasion"" or ""Boggy Creek 2"" you'll dig this one, the guys are absolutely on fire here.An easy 5 star entry to the Rifftrax catalogue.
