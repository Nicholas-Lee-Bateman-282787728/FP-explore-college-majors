There are indeed many plot holes that seem way too big to just brush off (no one saw the daughter on the plane?..she was the first on board!! No one saw her daughter being kidnapped and injected with a drug or her luggage being taken?).

The movie ""Flight Plan"" is about a widow, a mother of six-year-old girl, who while moving from Berlin to New York realizes that her daughter is missing. The movie is about her delusion and fears Vs facts and crime. The movie becomes so intense after the first 30 minutes, which will keep you glued to your seats.Acting by Jodie Foster is SUPERB, so is by Peter Sarsgaard, and Sean Bean. What is great about this movie is its direction. Director Robert Schwentke has done an excellent job and it is amazing how he has improved his skills after the direction failure of 2002 ""The Tattoo""!The DVD features include ""The making of the Flight Plan"" and ""The making of Altos 474"".

953596,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000BYY11O,Adam Craig,"[2, 4]","For me, Flightplan was really a movie of two completely different halves.  The first half of the movie was atmospheric, creepy, and I had no idea what was going on or what to think of anything.  I found myself paying extremely close to attention to every little detail of what was on the screen.  I couldn't wait to see what happened next, and when Kyle Pratt's (Jodie Foster) daughter Julia goes missing, I was totally clueless and enthralled with the plot.That was all well and good, but then Flightplan turns into a completely formulaic thriller that has basically been done too many times before.  I wouldn't really call what a happens a twist, more like just a revelation of what is really going on.  There has to be some solution, and it just happens that this is the way the filmmakers wanted to go with the storyline.  Personally, I thought the film could have been a lot better.  Jodie Foster does an admirable job as the classic distressed yet strong, resolute heroine of any suspense film.  Peter Sarsgaard plays a formulaic air marshall character (how many movies has he been in the last six months?!?!), and he breaks no acting ground for sure, not that he needs to.  Sean Bean plays the captain of the plane, and he was my favorite character.  He seemed to be the only one using straight intelligence in the film, and he served as a good antagonist for most of the film.Flightplan gets 4 stars because, however formulaic and disappointing the last half might have been, it still kept me on the edge of my seat.  Even though I basically knew how it was going to end, for some reason, it still drug me along for the ride, and that is the sign that a film is made well.  As I say in the title, Flightplan is a great one-time Friday night rental.

953598,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B000BYY11O,ajsteele,"[2, 2]","Flightplan is a true mystery film. The acting by Jodie Foster rock solid. In a nutshell its about a woman who boards a plane with her six year old daughter, and after taking a nap wakes up to find her daughter missing. She's not only missing, but is told when searching for her daughter that the kid never came on board the plane with her! This leads to a search of the plane while the passengers think the mother is nuts. Their are some extremely interesting twists and turns including a corrupt air marshall and stewardess, a suspicious middle easterner and a womans psychological perplexity. For my taste the movie starts off way too slow and uninteresting. Thats not to say slow cant be good at times.With all the remakes being made this film feels real fresh. When the movie takes off(no pun intended)it should hold any competent adults interest with ferver. Many of the scenes are filmed brilliantly, with unique angles and smart moody detail. As mom searches for her daughter you can feel the love and the fear thats given off by Jodie Foster with intensity. If you are the parent of a young child you can especially relate. The interaction between mom and the flight crew is as realistic as it gets. The captains' concern and frustration towards the hysterical mom is executed with sharp believeability.The action scenes and reason for the childs disappearence is done differently then I've seen in quite awhile. The ending has a few corny lines but it's tolerable. The movie is a great candidate for an alternate ending, which their wasn't. All considered, a really good NEW movie for a change.

953599,A3DJMO0WZNJ8N5,B000BYY11O,Alan Seals,"[0, 0]","This will not doubt be compared to ""Red Eye"" since both came out so closely to the same time and both take place aboard an airplane.  Both are also psychological thrillers.  But the plots and details are very different.In Flight Plan, there are not flying on just ""any"" airlplane.  It is the new two story plane that is the worlds largest which in reality will start flying this year.  Jodie Foster's character is no ordinary person.  She is a propulsion engineer who had a big role in designing the plan.  Where Red Eye takes an average flight with (apparently) average people and puts them in a great plot, Flight Plan makes the lead character a powerful person.  To me this is a negative.  I'm sure the fact that she is an engineer, a job which few women hold, helped its political correctness score.But back to the movie.  I gave it four stars because it was very entertaining.  But like so many have said, it falls apart on closer scrutiny.  Wouldn't SOMEONE have seen or noticed the little girl coming on the plane?  Wouldn't someone have seen her being taken?  The ""plot"" had been planned out so thoughtfully by the antagonist (the air marshall), but what would have happened to the plan to take the girl if Foster's character had not fallen asleep.  There are only some of the problems with the movie.A strong part of the movie is that it sets up a very dreadful mood on the plane.  We can almost feel the emotions that Foster is feeling.  I could almost put myself in her position under those cicumstances.  One reviewer (not to give away more info. but I assume most people reading this review have already seen the movie) mentioned that the movie seemed to be going in the direction that she WAS dillusional and there really was no girl to being with.  Some viewers would have been angry at a ""sad"" ending like that, but it also would have bold and surprising.To me it would have make it a much better movie.  As it is, sit back and enjoy the movie, just don't try to make too much sense out of it.

Gates ""Christian, Mother, Daughter,...","[1, 2]","During the opening 20 minutes, I was prepared to be royally disappointed - it looked like it was going to be *The Sixth Sense* with the roles reversed.  As the film progressed, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was an original (if slightly improbable) premise.Everything began to pick up when Foster's character (Kyle) and her daughter boarded the plane and the crew came around.  Occasional fragments of conversation, a knowing smile, strange questions - all built the tension and caused me to wonder what was really going on.While the conclusion did seem a little rushed, the numerous plot ""holes"" (why did they pick her, why did the guy in the morgue say the child was dead, etc) that are listed in other reviews are answered in dialogue toward the end of the film.  Perhaps these filmmakers decided that ""less is more"" in the way of explanation.  The performances, which are strong, smooth out some of the rough places.Are there some problems?  Well, yes.

If so, then you know how it feels to watch the first 20 minutes of this film.  Ever circled repeatedly over your destination as the pilot waited for landing clearance?  If you have, then you know how it feels to watch the last 15 minutes of Flightplan.They say that one of the greatest mistakes a person can ever make is engaging the child sitting one seat ahead in a game of peek-a-boo on a trans-Atlantic flight.  Watching this film is a close second.  To give you an idea of how bad it actually is - the set of the airplane completely steals the movie.  In fairness, it's an extremely good set, and the cinematography is fine.  But only truly awful writing and direction can make a force like Jodie Foster look this foolish.Viewers stuck watching Flightplan, who forgot to pack parachutes, will be reminded of Panic Room - except that Panic Room was a good movie with excellent writing, compelling characters, an interesting plot, and palpable tension.  Flightplan has none of these qualities.  The dialogue could be summarized thusly.  She:  ""My daughter is on this plane!""  He:  ""No she isn't.""  Eat you heart out Edward Albee.The imaginary airplane that serves as the setting for this airborne drawing room murder mystery seats 450 people, we're told.  The number of key players is surprisingly small, given this massive headcount.  Many minutes are devoted to tight shots of Jodie Foster looking upset, as only she can.  Beyond that, there's virtually no acting to be found.  Peter Sarsgaard is absolutely awful as the Air Marshall.  Only Sean Bean, as Pilot, saves the day with a performance both credible and interesting.

953603,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000BYY11O,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","Flightplan / B000BYY11Y*Spoilers*In my next life, I want Jodi Foster to be my mum. No one else can so convincingly freak out and tear a plane apart looking for her potentially-fictional daughter, even in the midst of a plot that Foster had to know was so riddled with holes as to make a block of swiss cheese seem completely solid in comparison.Follow me through this: An exceedingly small cabal of terrorists, composed of a rogue air marshal, a flight attendant, and a funeral director, plan to murder the husband of a local engineer on the grounds that she will then book the next flight back to her parents in America on the big plane she's been working on. She will, of course, be bringing her husband's coffin on the same flight, which is crucial because they can hide explosives in the coffin where they won't be found (security doesn't scan coffins because....um.).As part of the plan, it is absolutely essential that no one on a sold-out flight ever notices the engineer's daughter. I mean, seriously, not one child can say they saw the girl, not one parent can register ""hey, that kid's jumper is the same one I bought for Susan,"" nothing like that. This myopia must extend even to not noticing when the air marshal and flight attendant drug the girl, stuff her into a food cart, remove her luggage from the overhead bin, and steal the boarding pass from Foster's pant pocket.Once Foster comes to, it is vital to the plan of the terrorists that she completely freak out and start turning the plane upside down looking for the little girl. Now to some people, that behavior may be a given, but it's just as possible that the mother might figure that, after all, it's a closed plane and she's not going anywhere, so she must have found some kids to play with and is moving through the grieving process healthily, so maybe it's best to give her some space and collect her when we land. Whatever, Foster freaks out and elicits the captain's aid on the grounds that the flight crew is less than helpful.Hardly any time has passed before the captain has helpfully radioed ground control to find that the computer says (those frisky terrorists) that the little girl never even boarded. Displaying an uncharacteristic faith in computers, the crew figure that that is that, an assumption further backed up by another radio from the morgue stating that the little girl is, in fact, dead - even though there's only one coffin aboard, a detail that the captain is wholly incurious about.Also, there's a red herring with some Arabic passengers whom Foster believes she has seen staring into her daughter's window a few nights before.Eventually, the plane lands, the entire flight crew is ushered off except the terrorist flight attendant who inexplicably isn't, and Foster demonstrates that not only does an engineer know EVERYTHING about the plane she builds engines for, she also knows enough about explosives to tell, at a glance, what she can and can't blow up without damage to herself or daughter. She walks off the tarmac with daughter in hand, and everyone realizes that the crazy terrorist woman MUST be innocent, now that she has a little girl who vaguely looks like her.Really, ""Flightplan"" is something of an enigma in that everyone on the project MUST have known what a terrible story they were telling, but they still do their best. The acting varies from superb (Foster) to decent (everyone else), the visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and the sheer amount of effort that went into this movie is clear on every frame. I'm frankly astonished that they tried so hard, but they did. The result, however, is that the movie is unwieldy, boring, and trite since we never seriously suspect that Foster might be insane and the sheer inanity of the terrorist plot hurts the viewer's head.~ Ana Mardoll",2,Attractive thriller crippled by a ridiculous plot,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,3802,"['Flightplan', '/', 'B000BYY11Y*Spoilers*In', 'next', 'life', 'want', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'be', 'mum', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'so', 'convincingly', 'freak', 'out', 'tear', 'plane', 'apart', 'looking', 'potentially-fictional', 'daughter', 'even', 'midst', 'plot', 'Foster', 'had', 'know', 'was', 'so', 'riddled', 'holes', 'make', 'block', 'swiss', 'cheese', 'seem', 'completely', 'solid', 'comparison.Follow', 'exceedingly', 'small', 'cabal', 'terrorists', 'composed', 'rogue', 'air', 'marshal', 'flight', 'attendant', 'funeral', 'director', 'plan', 'murder', 'husband', 'local', 'engineer', 'grounds', 'will', 'then', 'book', 'next', 'flight', 'back', 'parents', 'America', 'big', 'plane', 'been', 'working', 'will', 'course', 'be', 'bringing', 'husband', 'coffin', 'same', 'flight', 'crucial', 'can', 'hide', 'explosives', 'coffin', 'where', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'security', ""n't"", 'scan', 'coffins', '.um', '.As', 'part', 'plan', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'one', 'sold-out', 'flight', 'ever', 'engineer', 'daughter', 'mean', 'seriously', 'not', 'one', 'child', 'can', 'say', 'saw', 'girl', 'not', 'one', 'parent', 'can', 'register', 'hey', 'kid', 'jumper', 'same', 'one', 'bought', 'Susan', 'nothing', 'myopia', 'must', 'extend', 'even', 'not', 'noticing', 'when', 'air', 'marshal', 'flight', 'attendant', 'drug', 'girl', 'stuff', 'food', 'cart', 'remove', 'luggage', 'overhead', 'bin', 'steal', 'boarding', 'pass', 'Foster', 'pant', 'pocket.Once', 'Foster', 'vital', 'plan', 'terrorists', 'completely', 'freak', 'out', 'start', 'turning', 'plane', 'upside', 'down', 'looking', 'little', 'girl', 'Now', 'people', 'behavior', 'may', 'be', 'given', 'just', 'possible', 'mother', 'might', 'figure', 'closed', 'plane', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'must', 'have', 'found', 'kids', 'play', 'moving', 'grieving', 'process', 'healthily', 'maybe', 'best', 'give', 'space', 'collect', 'when', 'land', 'Whatever', 'Foster', 'out', 'captain', 'aid', 'grounds', 'flight', 'crew', 'less', 'helpful.Hardly', 'time', 'passed', 'captain', 'helpfully', 'radioed', 'ground', 'control', 'find', 'computer', 'frisky', 'terrorists', 'little', 'girl', 'never', 'even', 'boarded', 'Displaying', 'uncharacteristic', 'faith', 'computers', 'crew', 'figure', 'assumption', 'further', 'backed', 'up', 'radio', 'morgue', 'stating', 'little', 'girl', 'fact', 'dead', 'even', 'only', 'one', 'coffin', 'aboard', 'detail', 'captain', 'wholly', 'incurious', 'about.Also', 'red', 'herring', 'Arabic', 'passengers', 'whom', 'Foster', 'seen', 'staring', 'daughter', 'window', 'few', 'nights', 'before.Eventually', 'plane', 'entire', 'flight', 'crew', 'ushered', 'off', 'terrorist', 'flight', 'attendant', 'who', 'inexplicably', ""n't"", 'Foster', 'not', 'only', 'engineer', 'know', 'EVERYTHING', 'plane', 'engines', 'also', 'enough', 'explosives', 'tell', 'glance', 'what', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blow', 'up', 'damage', 'daughter', 'walks', 'off', 'tarmac', 'daughter', 'hand', 'everyone', 'crazy', 'terrorist', 'woman', 'MUST', 'be', 'innocent', 'now', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'vaguely', 'her.Really', 'Flightplan', 'something', 'enigma', 'everyone', 'project', 'MUST', 'have', 'known', 'what', 'terrible', 'story', 'were', 'telling', 'still', 'do', 'best', 'acting', 'varies', 'superb', 'Foster', 'decent', 'everyone', 'else', 'visuals', 'are', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'sheer', 'amount', 'effort', 'went', 'movie', 'clear', 'frame', ""'m"", 'frankly', 'astonished', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'did', 'result', 'however', 'movie', 'unwieldy', 'boring', 'trite', 'never', 'seriously', 'suspect', 'Foster', 'might', 'be', 'insane', 'sheer', 'inanity', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'viewer', 'head.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

She seems to bring an intelligence and raw emotion to her films like no other actor/actress.Plot- In Germany and Still grieving from her husbands death- Foster, ''Kyle Pratt'', and her 6 yr old daughter Marlene Lawston who plays ''Julia'' get on an amazing 474 aircraft to return to the United States to bury her husband. Kyle and her daughter board the plane and are relaxing before taking off when Kyle falls asleep, upon waking up she finds her daughter missing. She struggles to prove to the passengers and flight attendents that her daughter was on the plane and she is missing though noone seems to have seen her. They claim the evidence indicated her daughter was never on board. As she frantically searches for her daughter most of the crew and passengers are getting upset and they are led to beleive she is emotionally unstable due to her husbands recent death. They dont want to doubt the bereaved widow but from all the evidence they arent sure what to believe. She alone has to try to solve the mystery of her daughters disapearance.The aircraft used in the film is a real stunner. Plush, Roomy, Amazing aerodynamic inovation.

953605,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BYY11O,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","For a fast paced thriller I must admit that `Flightplan' actually succeeds on many levels.  The acting is committed (as it really needs to be and so often isn't in films of this nature) and the films construction is so tightly compacted that even when it doesn't make sense (and when you think about it, a lot of this movie doesn't) it doesn't matter because you are, most importantly, very entertained.The film follows Kyle, a grieving widow transporting her husband's body home aboard a jet she helped design.  She is accompanied by her daughter, but not for long, for no sooner do they take off her daughter up and disappears.  She's frantic (who wouldn't be) but it soon becomes very clear that not only does no one truly believe her, but no one really wants to help her, including the sky marshal, Carson, no matter how sympathetic he seems (creepy).Jodie Foster really delivers here, and she's not one who is all over my `must see' lists.  I like her enough, but I find her highly overrated (I love `The Silence of the Lambs' as much as the next guy, but she wasn't even nomination worthy, let alone WIN worthy over the likes to Sarandon and Davis).  Here, she is a complete joy to watch.  This hardened woman scorned is her niche (I'd hate to see her play soft and pretty), and she is definitely believable in every scene, despite the fact that the plot is far from probable.  I LOVE PETER SARSGAARD and so it's no surprise that he really steals this show for me.  In fact, I love Peter Sarsgaard so much that I'm dedicating my next four (five total counting this one) to him and his greatness.  Yes, he plays the `obvious creep' very well, but why fault him for doing what is asked of him exceedingly well (that's like faulting Scarlett Johansson for playing the man-eater perfectly).  He is all sorts of spine chilling here and I adore that about his performance.Sarsgaard is far from one trick, even if he has been labeled.  Watch him in `Jarhead', `Garden State', `Kinsey', `Boys Don't Cry', `Shattered Glass', `Year of the Dog' and `The Salton Sea', just to mention a few.  He has many faces.  I really need to write a review on him as an actor soon!Sean Bean and Erica Christensen (why has this girl disappeared?) are also very well used in their supporting roles here.So, do I recommend this film?  Yes.  It is a fun, suspenseful and engaging ride that, despite a few flaws, will not lose your interest.  I found that it failed to tie up a few loose ends and feeds into hysteria without purpose, but it is an easily dismissed issue.

953611,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,B000BYY11O,A. Schneider,"[0, 0]","Flightplan might not be worth buying to some but it's certainly worth a look at. Don't get your hopes up though, while the actors involved give some solid performances this movie is by far no masterpiece.If you've read other reviews on Amazon (and/or the description) of the movie, then you're no doubt expecting to watch an interesting psychological thriller filled with non-stop suspense. In this regard the movie does not disappoint: it's suspenseful toward the very end. As for the ""interesting"" part, well, it's probably what you would expect from a ""woman missing child perhaps she's crazy"" type of action-suspense movie, nothing more but perhaps nothing less.What separates the film from others is simply the timing of the release. Films of this kind are usually insanely scary (Final Destination) or relay on an end plot twist which you've come to expect (M. Night Shyamalan's works). While this movie certainly features elements found in both types of films, a positive aspect of this film is that it manages to be captivating in a way that few theatrical releases of this genre have been lately. That is to say the atmosphere and mood were created (for the most part) by Jodie Foster's solid performance.Subtle intricacies along the way also make the journey of Flightplan quite interesting. Such aspects include the introduction of an Air Marshal onto the plane, suspected terrorists being onboard, and other such things. Sure the film isn't going to win awards solely based on its storyline but I assure you it makes for an exciting experience.This film isn't great. There are certain impracticalities that take place during the film that'll make you want to pull your hair out, but for me at least, they weren't all that troublesome. The largest sets of impracticalities which are often mentioned in reviews occur during the film's conclusion. Although the ending wasn't up to par with my expectations, I certainly didn't think any less of the film because of my feelings toward it.All and all I think this is a film worth renting. For the film's performances and overall delivery I'm going to have to give this film 4 stars (in good faith I can't give the film less considering I found it highly engaging while it was going on). As far as I'm concerned this isn't the type of film I'd be buying anytime soon, but if it's any help to know I don't often rate fast-paced modern suspense/action films with 4 stars.",4,"Rent it first, suspenseful and fun!",1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2424,"['Flightplan', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'worth', 'buying', 'certainly', 'look', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'actors', 'involved', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'movie', 'far', 'masterpiece.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'description', 'movie', 'then', ""'re"", 'doubt', 'expecting', 'watch', 'interesting', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'filled', 'non-stop', 'suspense', 'regard', 'movie', 'not', 'disappoint', 'suspenseful', 'very', 'end', 'interesting', 'part', 'well', 'probably', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'woman', 'missing', 'child', 'perhaps', 'crazy', 'type', 'action-suspense', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'perhaps', 'nothing', 'less.What', 'film', 'others', 'simply', 'timing', 'release', 'Films', 'kind', 'are', 'usually', 'insanely', 'scary', 'Final', 'Destination', 'relay', 'end', 'plot', 'twist', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'works', 'movie', 'certainly', 'elements', 'found', 'types', 'films', 'positive', 'aspect', 'film', 'be', 'captivating', 'way', 'few', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'genre', 'have', 'been', 'lately', 'say', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'were', 'created', 'most', 'part', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'solid', 'performance.Subtle', 'intricacies', 'way', 'also', 'make', 'journey', 'Flightplan', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Such', 'aspects', 'include', 'introduction', 'Air', 'Marshal', 'plane', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'being', 'onboard', 'other', 'such', 'things', 'Sure', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'awards', 'solely', 'based', 'storyline', 'assure', 'exciting', 'experience.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'great', 'are', 'certain', 'impracticalities', 'take', 'place', 'film', ""'ll"", 'make', 'want', 'pull', 'hair', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'troublesome', 'largest', 'sets', 'impracticalities', 'are', 'often', 'mentioned', 'reviews', 'occur', 'film', 'conclusion', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'expectations', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'less', 'film', 'feelings', 'it.All', 'think', 'film', 'renting', 'film', 'performances', 'overall', 'delivery', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'give', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'good', 'faith', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'considering', 'found', 'highly', 'engaging', 'was', 'going', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', ""n't"", 'type', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'buying', 'anytime', 'soon', 'help', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'rate', 'fast-paced', 'modern', 'suspense/action', 'films', '4', 'stars']",N/A

We learn that her husband fell off the roof of a building, and Kyle and her young daughter, Julia, are taking the body back to the the U.S. Mid-flight, she wakes up to discover that her little girl is no longer beside her. She looks around the cabin. She looks in the lounge. She looks in the bathrooms. The little girl is no where. The passengers get annoyed-- how can you lose a child when you're 38,000 feet in the air? Eventually, the poor woman is in hysterics, believing that there is some kind of conspiracy to kidnap her daughter, when the pilot (Sean Bean) informs her that her daughter died the same day her husband did. He apparently took the girl with him when he ""fell."" But she's not so sure. She believes her little girl is alive and somewhere on that plane. So the question is-- is this woman delusional? Is there a conspiracy? What the heck is going on?!It's all relatively simple, though I was still surprised when the ""twist"" finally came. Seriously didn't see it coming! Much more shocked than I was with The Forgotten, which was just plain hokey.

953614,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000BYY11O,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","Here lately, the great Jodie Foster has taken on the mantle of tough, single women in jeopardy. She really made this her own niche with ""Panic Room"", and now with this film. Unfortunatley, this movie, while a lot of fun, seems to have the other film firmly in it's agenda. Let's think about it for a minute, shall we?. In 'Panic', Jodie plays a single mother who is confined in a house, and is trying to save herself and her daughter from a couple of bad guys. In this film, Foster plays a widowed mother who is confined in an airplane, and is trying to save herself and her daughter from a couple of bad guys. The movie itself is nothing really new or original, even if 'Panic' never existed. However, this doesn't stop it from being a well made, well acted, entertaining film, because it is. Foster plays Kyle Pratt, a woman who just lost her husband in a freak accident. She is transporting his body from Berlin to America, and she hops on board with her 6 year old daughter, Julia. Did I mention Pratt was an engineer?. She knows the plane. How convenient. She wakes up from a nap, and her daughter is gone. Poof. Vanished. Records show that her daughter was never on board. Never listed. An air marshall named Carson(Peter Sarsgaard)tries to help, and the pilot(the great Sean Bean)quickly loses patience. Was there ever really a daughter?. Was Pratt so far gone from the death of her husband that she imagined a daughter?. Did the daughter die too?. Is someone playing games with her?. You'll have to see to find out. The movie makes the most of the airplane itself and it's space. It's photographed well, and sharply directed. Foster, as usual, is great. She brings great depth and sophistication to her role. She is a great heroine, as she proved in 'Panic' and ""Silence Of The Lambs"". Bean, who is usually a bad guy, does well and it's nice to see him as a nice guy. Sarsgaard, with his sleepy eyes, looks as if he could be Paul Rudd's brother. But it's not all great, folks. The scenario of a vanishing daughter on a plane is great, but the plot's reasoning for why and how it happened is kind of weak. Before long, the whole thing is forgotten and collapses on itself as you are just more interested in what's going on, rather than what it all means. And was it all really necessary?. Am I missing something?. ""Flightplan"" is not entirely original, but it's a lot of fun. The cast is great, the direction is great, and it will keep you interested.

Well, Jodie Foster's husband dies right at the beginning of the movie, supposedly by accident. Bad way to start when looking for an exciting thriller.Flightplan really gets going when Jodie and her daughter board a flight from Berlin to New York. They fall asleep way up in the air, and when Jodie wakes up, her daughter is gone. She has the plane searched from front to back, but the crew fails to find the child. Everyone is beginning to think Jodie is insane (so was I), even Jodie is wondering if her meds are making her act strange, when the plot is uncovered. The air marshall, who until now has been helping Jodie, makes up a story about Jodie being a terrorist wanting fifty million dollars deposited into her bank account, or else she'll blow up the plane. The money is transferred, all the passengers deboard when the plane lands, all the crew leaves, and its just the air marshall, Jodie, and the evil flight attendant, who is the air marshall's accomplice. Eventually, of course, Jodie finds her daughter and the evil duo is broken up. The plan is foiled, lets all be happy. We also find out that Jodie's husband was in fact murdered by the air marshall.Plot problems... Why was she chosen as the victim? Why was her husband killed and her daughter picked and not the annoying kids sitting in front of Jodie? Jodie is an aeronautical engineer, so... wouldn't we want to stay away from her during a major abduction on an airplane? She knows parts of the plane, she knows where people can be hidden. Second, whats the fifty million dollars for? Never explained. And last, why was Jodie going to America in the first place?

It should not, however, be the sole or primary reason for a film to be made or to have a script tailored around.  But in the banal movie FLIGHTPLAN, this appears to have been the case.  From there, we get an unsuspenseful mystery and an uninteresting thriller all rolled into one easily predictable formulaic plot.  Never having seen any of the film or heard about the plot before I watched it in its entirety, I actually announced my prediction for the outcome of the story 10 minutes into the film, and was fairly accurate.  That is not to boast of my prescience.  I am pretty sure many (if not most) of you could do the same or come pretty close.  It is hard to describe this film without giving too much away, so I will leave out most of the details and in a rare display of literary restraint, I will keep this review relatively short.The story of the film concerns an aircraft design engineer (Jodie Foster) who boards a flight with her daughter from Europe back to the United States, with the casket and body of her recently deceased husband in the cargo hold.  But there's a strange twist that occurs once the flight gets underway.  Oh yeah, it's also supposed to be the world's largest passenger jet - big whoop!  This was almost inconsequential except only to allow for a supposedly immense myriad of places to hide, and ostensibly because it does not allow for escape (while in the air), as well as allowing for a convoluted fortuitous coincidence to benefit Foster's flaky character.  You will probably figure out who the bad folks are early on, and also the highly improbable and remarkably unimaginative twist to the ""mystery"".  The acting is highly overdone or creepy high camp, as are Jodie Foster's and Peter Sarsgaard's respective consistent acting hallmarks.

Erland,"[0, 1]","'Flightplan' released in '05 is a taut, well-constructed, surpenseful murder/kidnap thriller that literally grabs your attention once the action starts on the airplane and holds you captive to the very end. Jodie Foster does a masterful job as Kyle Pratt the distraught and vulnerable widow and mother of little six year old Julia (Marlene Lawston). Kyle is bringing her dead husbands body back from Germany to the U.S. for burial. During the long flight from Berlin to New York the unimaginable occurs, little Julia disappears and no one on board has any recollection of ever seeing the child. Has Kyle Pratt lost her mind, or is something conspiratoral and sinister going on? Once the plane lands it will be too late either way.Jodie Foster does an amazingly successful job of graviating back and forth between the brink of insanity and logical, rational analysis as she battles the unbelieving flight staff, air marshall and fellow passengers. It's a strong, gutsy female role that most actresses would die for.

953627,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000BYY11O,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[0, 1]","""Flightplan"" is a suspenseful film that follows a woman and her young girl as they board a large, two- level jet on route from Europe to the USA. In this fast- paced film, a woman finds herself in the middle of a hijacking of sorts. She is certain she brought her little girl on the flight with her yet no one around her claims to have seen this young child and the flight crew, captain, and others insist her girl was never there. It sends Foster's character into panic mode, and she proceeds to check every nook and cranny of the plane, including the cargo area and the upper section of the plane, above the top row of passengers, in a frantic effort to find her daughter.This movie does succeed on some levels, although it isn't quite the sky- high thriller I had hoped for. Among the assets of this film, one is certainly the fast - paced action taking place at 30,000 feet. Most of the duration of this film takes place in the sky, with Foster running all over the plane, arguing with the crew, causing mayhem, and demanding a full scale search to find her little girl. She manages to make her way into the cargo area. She climbs into the upper area above the passengers by climbing through the opening in the ceiling of one of the bathrooms. At one point, she deliberately plays around with the electrical wiring and causes the oxygen masks to release themselves to the passengers. You never quite know what she will try next or how the people in charge will react and the action is non- stop until near the end.Jodie Foster and Peter Sarsgaard are the two main stars of this film and they help make the movie interesting. Foster can always be counted on for a solid performance and she delivers here, in this movie. It isn't Oscar- caliper by any means, but it is still good. Sarsgaard is quite interesting because his character is so calm and cool you start to wonder if he is up to some dirty tricks or if he is just, well, a calming, soothing type of guy who is just doing is job to protect the passengers of the plane from harm.As far as the suspense goes, this film is generally pretty good and it does keep you guessing most of the time. First, you start to wonder about the missing girl. You can clearly see her on the plane when it takes off and then suddenly she is missing. Why is she missing? Is someone hiding her somewhere on the plane? Did Foster do something to her? Or will the director suddenly decide to turn the whole ""missing child"" dilemma into a dream sequence? Then, you start to wonder about the fate of the plane and the passengers. Will the plane explode in the sky? Will it successfully make an emergency landing? Will the people responsible for this chaos be brought to justice? You don't really know until the movie gets into its second half and starts to wind down.As for the bad points, there are a few. I didn't like the ending of this film at all and it really loses steam during the final twenty minutes. It moves quickly for the first half and the adrenaline builds and builds. Then, the jet fuel begins to lose its high octane punch for the final twenty minutes leaving the viewer with a feeling of disappointment. The final scenes are a real letdown because even though they give you a sense of closure, they leave you wanting to know more. It ends too quickly to be real. At 98 minutes, the film is really too short to present a full- fledged thriller. It needed at least another twenty to thirty minutes to make it complete and satisfying. And some of what you see is a little far- fetched, like the fact that no one in the nearby seats claims to have seen Foster's little girl- even when the plane first took off.This suspenseful film has been referred to by some as a psychological thriller. I don't think it is worthy of this designation because there isn't much psychology involved. The only point where psychology comes into play is when you are left to ponder whether or not Foster's character is losing her mind over her insistence that her daughter was next to her and is now somewhere on the plane. Other than that, this is a generic thriller that offers some interesting twists and turns as the plane makes its way to the runway.""Flightplan"" may not be the perfect thriller and many viewers will get frustrated over the film's ending and the fact that the director didn't better utilize the talents of Foster and Sarsgaard. But it still offers enough fast- paced action and suspenseful moments to make it worthy of a DVD rental. It hits some turbulence during the second half but it glides along smoothly for most of its 98 minutes and provides some entertaining moments",3,"Mayhem at 30,000 Feet",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,4626,"['Flightplan', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'woman', 'young', 'girl', 'board', 'large', 'two-', 'level', 'jet', 'route', 'Europe', 'USA', 'fast-', 'paced', 'film', 'woman', 'middle', 'hijacking', 'sorts', 'certain', 'brought', 'little', 'girl', 'flight', 'yet', 'one', 'claims', 'have', 'seen', 'young', 'child', 'flight', 'crew', 'captain', 'others', 'insist', 'girl', 'was', 'never', 'there', 'Foster', 'character', 'panic', 'mode', 'check', 'nook', 'cranny', 'plane', 'including', 'cargo', 'area', 'upper', 'section', 'plane', 'top', 'row', 'passengers', 'frantic', 'effort', 'find', 'daughter.This', 'movie', 'succeed', 'levels', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sky-', 'high', 'thriller', 'had', 'hoped', 'assets', 'film', 'one', 'certainly', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'taking', 'place', '30,000', 'feet', 'Most', 'duration', 'film', 'place', 'sky', 'Foster', 'running', 'plane', 'arguing', 'crew', 'causing', 'mayhem', 'demanding', 'full', 'scale', 'search', 'find', 'little', 'girl', 'make', 'way', 'cargo', 'area', 'upper', 'area', 'passengers', 'climbing', 'opening', 'ceiling', 'one', 'bathrooms', 'one', 'point', 'deliberately', 'electrical', 'wiring', 'oxygen', 'masks', 'release', 'passengers', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'will', 'try', 'next', 'how', 'people', 'charge', 'will', 'react', 'action', 'non-', 'stop', 'end.Jodie', 'Foster', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'stars', 'film', 'help', 'make', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Foster', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'counted', 'solid', 'performance', 'here', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Oscar-', 'caliper', 'means', 'still', 'good', 'Sarsgaard', 'quite', 'interesting', 'character', 'so', 'calm', 'cool', 'start', 'wonder', 'up', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'just', 'well', 'calming', 'soothing', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'protect', 'passengers', 'plane', 'harm.As', 'far', 'suspense', 'film', 'generally', 'pretty', 'good', 'keep', 'guessing', 'most', 'time', 'First', 'start', 'wonder', 'missing', 'girl', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'plane', 'when', 'then', 'suddenly', 'missing', 'Why', 'missing', 'someone', 'hiding', 'somewhere', 'plane', 'Did', 'Foster', 'do', 'something', 'will', 'director', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'whole', 'missing', 'child', 'dilemma', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Then', 'start', 'wonder', 'fate', 'plane', 'passengers', 'Will', 'plane', 'explode', 'sky', 'Will', 'successfully', 'make', 'emergency', 'landing', 'Will', 'people', 'responsible', 'chaos', 'be', 'brought', 'justice', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'wind', 'down.As', 'bad', 'points', 'are', 'few', 'did', ""n't"", 'ending', 'film', 'really', 'steam', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'quickly', 'first', 'half', 'adrenaline', 'builds', 'builds', 'Then', 'jet', 'fuel', 'lose', 'high', 'octane', 'punch', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'disappointment', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'real', 'letdown', 'even', 'give', 'sense', 'closure', 'leave', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'too', 'quickly', 'be', 'real', '98', 'minutes', 'film', 'really', 'too', 'short', 'present', 'full-', 'fledged', 'thriller', 'needed', 'least', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'make', 'complete', 'satisfying', 'what', 'see', 'little', 'far-', 'fetched', 'fact', 'one', 'nearby', 'seats', 'claims', 'have', 'seen', 'Foster', 'little', 'girl-', 'even', 'when', 'plane', 'first', 'took', 'off.This', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'been', 'referred', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worthy', 'designation', ""n't"", 'much', 'psychology', 'involved', 'only', 'point', 'where', 'psychology', 'play', 'when', 'are', 'left', 'ponder', 'not', 'Foster', 'character', 'losing', 'mind', 'insistence', 'daughter', 'was', 'next', 'now', 'somewhere', 'plane', 'Other', 'generic', 'thriller', 'interesting', 'twists', 'plane', 'way', 'runway', 'Flightplan', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'thriller', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'frustrated', 'film', 'ending', 'fact', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'better', 'utilize', 'talents', 'Foster', 'Sarsgaard', 'still', 'enough', 'fast-', 'paced', 'action', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'make', 'worthy', 'DVD', 'rental', 'turbulence', 'second', 'half', 'smoothly', 'most', '98', 'minutes', 'entertaining', 'moments']",N/A

A woman on a plane in flight suddenly realizes that her daughter is missing - and not only does nobody believe her, but there appears to be no record that her daughter was ever on the flight!As we follow this true psychodrama chess game to its inevitable conclusion, undercurrents and subplots reveal their plot-thickening hair. Why does no one recall seeing the child when we, the audience, obviously saw her? Even when the child is missing, her teddy bear manifests. True, her mother is distraught, grief stricken over the loss of her husband - and yet, there's the mark on the window the little girl made, a small heart, just before both laid down to take a nap.

The movie was too good to be true, and it degenerated into a standard, nonsensical thriller, with Arabs, with hints of hijacking, with threats of a remote controlled bomb, with ransom demands, with guns, and with an intricate murder plot.It is always a pleasure to see Jodie Foster, and to see the quality of her acting.

Rector,"[3, 15]","There are some movies that are so tasteless and poorly thought out that you really have to wonder just what they were thinking of when they made it. One such flick is the 2005 Jodie Foster picture Flightplan. This has to be one the most poorly conceived movies of recent years.Flightplan is a movie that is both poorly conceived and boring to boot. It trashes stewardesses and U.S. air marshals. It comes across as an attempt to tell us all that all terrorists are not Arabs, as if most Americans were not aware of the likes of Timothy McVeigh. In other words, Flightplan is a mixture of both Hollywood stupidity and political correctness rolled into one.The movie very strongly hints that the four Arabs who are on the plane are terrorists. However, we never see the Arab passengers engage in any terrorist acts. This violates a general rule in thrillers that folks who are hinted to be bad people, turn out to be bad people. There are no red herrings in thriller flicks.The movie also very strongly hints that the Federal air marshal and a flight attendant are terrorists. Guess what? It turns out that both the attendant and the marshal really are the terrorists!This development is especially sickening when you consider that air marshals and flight attendants are poorly paid workers who put their lives at risk whenever an airplane takes flight. This movie is a blow to their image and leads to passengers unfairly suspecting the attendants and marshals of being terrorists. Being fight attendants and air marshals was already tough work since it involves a lot of flight time and and very little recuperation time between flights.Flightplan's agenda is spelled out in the scenes involving the Arab passengers. All of the Arab passengers are evil looking characters. They all bear strong resemblances to Mohammed Atta and when they are on the screen, there is the music that normally denotes when evil things are about to happen. Jodie Foster's character even at one point accuses the main Arab guy of being a terrorist. In the end when it is revealed that the Arabs are all innocent and the bad guys were all white folks, the main Arab guy hands Jodie Foster's character her purse that he found on the floor.

Perhaps its one of those things that goes on in Hollywood's politics stuff as such- which went beyond like way back in the 70's when THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE being a hit spawned other movie makers to come up with disaster flicks like THE TOWERING INFERNO.What we're talking about are the certain incidences wherein rival movie production companies would try to get ahead in releasing a certain flick with a plotline (or a concept) that is taken from what is reportedly under production from other movie companies, and those certain cases went when PIXAR is currently under production of A BUG's LIFE that the other movie company came up with a pale equivalent featuring ants cashing on to feature known stars for its voice-over actors and released it (i bet in a hurry) ahead before PIXAR's project finished. Other similar cases of such ditch in the name of competition for Hollywood politics, we've the following: for VOLCANO- there's the tear-jerker flick Dante's Peak which stars Pierce Brosnan; for ARMAGGEDDON there's Deep Impact; for MOLL FLANDERS there's While You Were Sleeping; and for AUSTIN POWERS, there's its american equivalent Deuce Bigolowe.Jody Foster however did an amazing performance looking like some disturbed mother looking for its child that may've not really been around with her- causing panic with those on the plane.Peter Saarsgard however kind of annoyed me a bit with that dropy look of his looking like Meatloaf on heavy grass.Anyhow as for the movie- in its overall composure I'd a good ride.

(One of the conspirators is an Air Marshal and the other is a flight attendant. These two had no simpler ways to sneak a bomb into the plane? They did what they did because coffins are never checked at airports? If only drug dealers would know that...)Mr. Belsky again: ""Sounds overly complicated? Wait, there is more. With the help of the corrupt Berlin morgue director, the hijackers create the illusion that Foster's daughter had died along with her father. Thus, when Foster summons up the Captain and the crew to help search for the little girl, they doubt her sanity.  Now this is preposterous. The plot relays on no one noticing Foster's daughter as she boards and enters the plane. How could they count on it on advance?""To this observation I would add: we are told that no one noticed the girl because Foster & daughter were the first to board the plane. Let alone the fact that the first (or the last in a line) are usually more conspicuous than someone in a crowd: the announcement was ""passengers with children first"" so if there was no child with Foster, nobody wonders why Foster boarded first?Back to Mr. Belsky: ""Furthermore, they have phones on planes nowadays. After the Captain informs Foster that the morgue in Berlin told him that she was dead, all she has to do is call the nanny who had been with the child when the father had died, and get corroboration for her story. Of course she doesn't."" (...) ""But even if nobody did that, and the hijackers do manage to take the daughter's boarding pass from the mother without anyone noticing, there is still the risk that while searching the plane, the crew would have stumbled on the girl anyway.""To elaborate on Omer Belsky's insights: the girl was openly lying on a bulkhead for everyone to see. How come no crew person saw her during the search? They didn't know that part of the plane exists?This links with the reason why, other than the Hollywood happy ending requirement, the conspirators --who had murdered the husband already-- did not kill the girl (a possible witness!) right away. Or at least tied up, gagged and perhaps caged her, to make sure she does not wake up and returns on her own before time. No, they didn't; the girl is found untied, just sleeping on a bulkhead, as if the conspirators did not have the forethought of bringing a box or a rope in the plane.How did the bad guy manage to carry an unconscious girl through all the nooks and crannies, stairs and hatches, without being noticed?  Much later, he goes the same route in order to install the bomb. Why -apart from the customary Hollywood requirement- did he not set the bomb the first time he was there?The unbelievably tortuous plan conceived by the bad guys is the criminal equivalent to a Rube Goldberg contraption, only funnier.And remember that all this convoluted scheming is just to extort 50 million from the airline on the threat of a bomb. Wouldn't be much easier, say, to sneak the bomb in the plane, perhaps kill a passenger during the night (to make a strong statement) and leave a message to the captain pinned on the corpse? They could even misdirect suspicions by adding some political or religious statement to the threat.  Of course, this would no longer be a ""Lady Vanishes on a Plane"" scenario, so if that idea must be kept, here goes a simpler alternative: The bad guy kidnapped the girl because she spotted him while setting up the bomb.The criminal plot also relies on that the Captain, when he receives the extortion message, decides not to confront Foster. Such dialogue would have exposed that Foster knew nothing about the money and immediately threw suspicions on the air marshal, precisely the opposite result of what the conspirators were trying to accomplish with all these contrived preparations.The bad guys were not the only ones acting weird: the girl was drugged --or otherwise knocked unconscious-- and left exposed for hours in a probably non heated part of the plane, and she is still visibly asleep when, in the end, she is carried in Foster's arms towards the authorities. However, the ambulance services do not assist the daughter nor take her to an hospital. They allow the girl to stay with Foster in the vicinity of the plane explosion, I guess to meet the requisite Hollywood end-of-movie conversation.There is more, of course, but to conclude: Entertaining, if you stop thinking.",3,"""Rube Goldberg's revenge"" or ""watch, don't think""",1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,5471,"['would', 'give', 'film', '4', '5', 'stars', 'entertainment', 'then',

Middleton,"[1, 1]","It is difficult not to make comparisons with this film, which has many similarities to another extremely intense thriller, Panic Room: A single mother protecting her child; a confined space that pushes the Director and Director of photography to push the limits of their creativity, shooting a feature film in a limited space. The sheer panic in Jodie Foster's eyes when her six-year-old daughter strangely disappears on the plane has the full force of that familiar Hithcockian paranoia. However, these comparisons do not deter the fact that Flightplan is an excellent thriller, pushing its pace slowly until it hits an amazing crescendo at the climax.This film is also a lesson not to get in the way of a mother and her child. Jodie's character is sharp and intelligent, and once her daughter disappears, the intensity of her search and her dealings with the flight crew made me uncomfortable. Foster is without question an excellent performer. Watching her character attempting to repress her panic, observing it build slowly until the Air Marshal (Peter Sarsqaard) pushes her up against the door and cuffs this poor, distraught mother, was excellent acting as it was entirely believable.This film also addresses the fact that most people are unobservant, only concerned with their own lives, as no one remembers seeing the young girl get on the plane nor move to the back to sleep. As one of the character's exclaim, ""No one cares.""Flightplan is definitely a four star effort, as Jodie Foster once again shows us what great acting is all about.",4,Another stellar performance from Ms. Foster,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,1548,"['difficult', 'not', 'make', 'comparisons', 'film', 'many', 'similarities', 'extremely', 'intense', 'thriller', 'Panic', 'Room', 'single', 'mother', 'protecting', 'child', 'confined', 'space', 'Director', 'Director', 'photography', 'push', 'limits', 'creativity', 'shooting', 'feature', 'film', 'limited', 'space', 'sheer', 'panic', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'eyes', 'when', 'six-year-old', 'daughter', 'strangely', 'plane', 'full', 'force', 'familiar', 'Hithcockian', 'paranoia', 'However', 'comparisons', 'do', 'not', 'deter', 'fact', 'Flightplan', 'excellent', 'thriller', 'pushing', 'pace', 'slowly', 'amazing', 'crescendo', 'climax.This', 'film', 'also', 'lesson', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'mother', 'child', 'Jodie', 'character', 'sharp', 'intelligent', 'once', 'daughter', 'disappears', 'intensity', 'search', 'dealings', 'flight', 'crew', 'made', 'uncomfortable', 'Foster', 'question', 'excellent', 'performer', 'Watching', 'character', 'attempting', 'repress', 'panic', 'observing', 'build', 'slowly', 'Air', 'Marshal', 'Peter', 'Sarsqaard', 'up', 'door', 'cuffs', 'poor', 'distraught', 'mother', 'was', 'excellent', 'acting', 'was', 'entirely', 'believable.This', 'film', 'also', 'fact', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'unobservant', 'only', 'concerned', 'own', 'lives', 'one', 'seeing', 'young', 'girl', 'get', 'plane', 'move', 'back', 'sleep', 'one', 'character', 'exclaim', 'one', 'Flightplan', 'definitely', 'four', 'star', 'effort', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'once', 'again', 'what', 'great', 'acting']",N/A

But Because this is movie is set on a plane that also does make it a different movie. To be perfectly honest, ""Flightplan"" is acutally ""Panic Room"" meet the 1973 movie ""Horror at 37,000 Feet. This time Jodie Foster is William Shatner's character, but instead of saying that ""There's some-thing on the wing."" She's just looking for her daugther on Aalto E-474 aircraft. But the people still don't believe her, even when one of the other children on board tells their parents that they saw the little girl too. But the chaos runs throughout anyway. But instead of what's outside being the threat, Jodie Foster is the threat. And so the threat is inside the plane. And her character knows the insides and outs of the plane because she designed it. The child actress that play's Jodie's daughter in the movie's performance is both heartbreaking yet conveincing as we see the two of them at the beginning of the movie dealing with the passing of her husband. You almost believe for a moment that Jodie's character is making it all up and is really going crazy. Maybe the daugther is a ghost that she just can't let go of. Maybe her character's fears being alone and with no family left. But ( as you might have already see in the previews now) she does find out that her dauther is alive is she is on the plane. And jodie Foster handles herself in the same fashion is she did when taking  back control of the apartment in ""Panic Room"". But in this case it's taking back control of the plane for whatever or whoever is doing this. So I'm not going to spoil the rest of the movie for you from there. But I will tell you one thing, Flightplan is a thriller that delivers the thrills. Despite hitting some familiar ""Panic Room""- like territory. Plus James Horner composes a really good to the movie despite what some people might say. So if you're looking for a really good thriller to make a movie night out of.

Most of them involve having to get a vital piece of information somewhere that will save the day and if it fails to arrive death and destruction result.  In my view this is really a three star movie that I give four stars because of Jodie Foster's performance.  She is so believable that she sucks us in to an otherwise rather clumsy movie.The best thrillers give us all the information available to the protagonist even when it is misleading.  However, this movie depends on us being off balance from the very beginning.  We aren't sure what the movie is going to be about.  Foster's character is obviously disturbed, but we aren't exactly sure if she is disturbed because of real events or if the events are a function of her disturbance.I don't want to get into much of the plot because what enjoyment there is in the movie depends on you knowing (and thinking) as little as possible about the real nature of the story.  The one thing I can say is that like all action flicks that take place within airplanes, from John Wayne's ""The High and the Mighty"" to this movie, they always make the interiors of the planes bigger, ROOMIER, and quieter than they really are.  Have you ever been able to whisper in a plane?  I don't care if the plane seats 800 people, you don't have a bar with loose bottles of liquor on a shelf, nor do you have cathedral sized spaces in the storage area beneath the passenger compartments.  This is a commercial vessel and every cubic inch has to be used to maximize efficiency.  Puh-leeze.Still, Foster is such a strong actress (and I always get drawn in by her) that she is able to help us feel her anxiety and panic.  We also feel the frustration and disbelief of the ordinary passengers and crew.  It makes for a fun division of emotions, but if you start thinking too much about everything you will see, the thing comes crashing down (if you can forgive the term).It is a good family flick, but might be too disturbing for little kids.

The premise being that Foster, living in some German country, is flying back to the states with her daughter to bury her recently deceased husband.  Things get bad when her daughter dissapears, but the question lingers...did her daughter ever get on the plane, did her daughter die?  Maybe, maybe not.  The film exploits this perfectly, leaving you guessing and second guessing and even cross checking your answers over and over, not ever really sure who's right or wrong.  My only complaint is that I feel the end still left a few questions unanswered...I mean, without giving anything away, the end answers the main question but there are a few questions or scenerios left open, one involving Iranians on the plane that I felt should have been investigated deeper or left out intirely because with the way the film ends your left scratching your head on that one.

953658,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000BYY11O,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[0, 1]","I loved this movie!  From beginning to end, Jodie Foster gives an amazing performance worthy of the cost of admission to a theater.  She is one of the best actresses working in Hollywood, and this performance, musch like ""Contact"", proves it.Flightplan is analyzed way too much.  Yeah, there are items in the movie that are probably a bit stretched - a coffin not fully screened before being loaded, etc..  Big deal!  It is the acting, the suspense, and the drama that make this movie a thrill ride.  This is one of those movies that you find yourself not wanting to look away from the screen for fear you might miss something.Jodie Foster plays Kyle, an engineer living in Germany whose husband recently died and is flying, along with his body and her daughter to New York.  After Kyle and her daughter, Julia (Marlene Lawston), decide to take a little nap, things get scary!  Kyle wakes up to find her daughter missing and no one on the plane can ever remember having seen her.As Jodie Foster's character becomes more and more desperate to find her daughter, we (the audience, of course) are introduced to a cast of extremely interesting characters who we become very suspicious of.  And that is what really drives this movie.Peter Sarsgaard (Shattered Glass, Garden State, The Skeleton Key) plays Air Marshal Carson, and man is he great in this film (my wife totally disagrees with me.  She believes someone else should have played the role).  The only other role that he performs so well in is Shattered Glass, and if you haven't seen that movie, you need to!  He is awesome in that film!Sean Bean (National Treasure, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King) plays the Captain (pilot), and I really enjoyed watching him in this film.  He is very convincing as a pilot.  The only flaw in his role probably came from the script or directing - a few times, he paused for so long in between decisions, I was expecting him to go find a Magic Eight Ball to retrieve his answer.  At one point in the movie, during a long pause by Bean, my wife said out loud, ""Say something already!""  Other than that minor complaint, Bean is excellent in his part.Erika Christensen plays flight attendant Fiona and just about steals the show with her on screen presence.  Beautiful and a bit of a mystery in this movie, she seemed to realize the importance of her role beyond what I think most actresses would.  She keeps us guessing!Kate Beahan does the best she can with a role that never really tapped all of her talent.  Her dialogue was a little underwritten.Too many people are overanalyzing this film!  Ignore the negative hype.  I think it is playing off of itself, as if liking this movie somehow supports the fact that airline attendants are all rude, or that all coffins are not being inspected before being loaded on a plane.  The movie is not a DOCUMENTARY for goodness sake!All and all, Flightplan is an excellent movie, filled with a lot of suspense.  The whole family can watch this movie.  If there were any cuss words, I don't remember them.  Jodie Foster is quality act.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for her, and I will continue to see her movies and support her with my hard-earned greenbacks.See ya next review!",5,An Awesome Hollywood Suspense Movie!,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,3230,"['loved', 'movie', 'beginning', 'end', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'amazing', 'performance', 'worthy', 'cost', 'admission', 'theater', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'performance', 'musch', 'Contact', 'it.Flightplan', 'analyzed', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'Yeah', 'are', 'items', 'movie', 'are', 'probably', 'bit', 'stretched', 'coffin', 'not', 'fully', 'screened', 'being', 'loaded', 'etc..', 'Big', 'deal', 'acting', 'suspense', 'drama', 'make', 'movie', 'thrill', 'ride', 'one', 'movies', 'find', 'not', 'wanting', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'fear', 'might', 'miss', 'something.Jodie', 'Foster', 'Kyle', 'engineer', 'living', 'Germany', 'husband', 'recently', 'died', 'flying', 'body', 'daughter', 'New', 'York', 'Kyle', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'decide', 'take', 'little', 'nap', 'things', 'get', 'scary', 'Kyle', 'up', 'find', 'daughter', 'missing', 'one', 'plane', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'having', 'seen', 'her.As', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'more', 'more', 'desperate', 'find', 'daughter', 'audience', 'course', 'are', 'introduced', 'cast', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'characters', 'who', 'become', 'very', 'suspicious', 'what', 'really', 'movie.Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'Garden', 'State', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'Air', 'Marshal', 'Carson', 'man', 'great', 'film', 'wife', 'totally', 'someone', 'else', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'role', 'only', 'other', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'need', 'awesome', 'film', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'Captain', 'pilot', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'very', 'convincing', 'pilot', 'only', 'flaw', 'role', 'probably', 'came', 'script', 'directing', 'few', 'times', 'paused', 'so', 'long', 'decisions', 'was', 'expecting', 'go', 'find', 'Magic', 'Eight', 'Ball', 'retrieve', 'answer', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'long', 'pause', 'Bean', 'wife', 'said', 'out', 'loud', 'Say', 'something', 'already', 'Other', 'minor', 'complaint', 'Bean', 'excellent', 'part.Erika', 'Christensen', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Fiona', 'just', 'steals', 'show', 'screen', 'presence', 'Beautiful', 'bit', 'mystery', 'movie', 'seemed', 'realize', 'importance', 'role', 'what', 'think', 'most', 'actresses', 'would', 'guessing', 'Kate', 'Beahan', 'best', 'can', 'role', 'never', 'really', 'tapped', 'talent', 'dialogue', 'was', 'little', 'underwritten.Too', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'overanalyzing', 'film', 'negative', 'hype', 'think', 'playing', 'liking', 'movie', 'somehow', 'fact', 'airline', 'attendants', 'are', 'rude', 'coffins', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'inspected', 'being', 'loaded', 'plane', 'movie', 'not', 'DOCUMENTARY', 'goodness', 'sake', 'Flightplan', 'excellent', 'movie', 'filled', 'lot', 'suspense', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'were', 'cuss', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'quality', 'act', 'have', 'nothing', 'utmost', 'respect', 'will', 'continue', 'see', 'movies', 'support', 'hard-earned', 'greenbacks.See', 'ya', 'next', 'review']",N/A

This nonsense entirely misses the point, which is not the physical action per se, but the unfolding psychological action, and the developing structure of possible implications of the total action of the film, and what it might mean, as we move closer to the finish. From this perspective, in terms of moment to moment suspense, and the ongoing dramatic control of that suspense, the movie is excellent--very well directed, and well played by the entire company of actors. It is true that there are a few plot points that are a bit of a stretch, but none so extreme as to be impossible, and we become conscious of even these only retrospectively, at or near the very end of the film (I am being deliberately vague so as not to give away the story).

953660,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BYY11O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","I was surprised by some of the less than stellar reviews this film received, mainly because Jodie Foster, the consummate actress, just does not make bad movies - especially at this stage in her illustrious career.  A few comparisons to The Forgotten did manage to lower my expectations a bit going in, but Flightplan really impressed me.  Yes, you have to stretch credibility a little bit when you watch it, but that's almost to be expected since we are talking about a movie and not a documentary or reenactment of actual events.  It's not easy to come up with a decent ending for a movie like this (and, inevitably, some viewers will think it should have taken a different path at the end), but I think the filmmakers hit a stand-up triple if not a home run in the case of Flightplan.Jodie Foster plays Kyle Pratt, a grieving widow flying home from Germany with her daughter and the body of her husband (who died when he fell off the roof of their building).  It's a huge, brand new airplane, one which Pratt actually helped design, and she sets out to search every inch of it after she wakes up, some three hours into the flight, to find her six-years-old daughter missing.  Like any mother, she does a quick search of the surrounding area before quickly slipping into panic mode, soliciting the help of the crew and, ultimately, the captain.  A search is organized by the crew, but no one finds any sign of little Julia (Marlene Lawston).  To make matters worse, no one on board the plane even remembers seeing the little girl, and everyone on the passenger list is accounted for.  By now the air marshal (Peter Sarsgaard) is heavily involved, as Pratt has begun making quite a disturbance.  She just wants to find her child, but no one believes the girl was ever on the plane.  Can the drama of such a situation play out effectively for over an hour?  You bet it can, especially if Jodie Foster is the one pulling at your heartstrings.I think this film is put together extremely well.  A gloomy, somewhat discordant beginning lays the groundwork for what is to come, introducing a level of ambiguity that makes it more difficult to figure out where this movie is ultimately taking you.  The acting is really top-notch overall (with the exception of Sarsgaard, who doesn't seem to be putting all that much effort into it).  I thought Sean Bean was particularly impressive as the captain.  Jodie Foster, of course, is superb, and the viewer can't help but develop a really strong relationship with her; a less talented actress might have had trouble sustaining the tension over the course of the entire film, but Jodie keeps ratcheting up the old suspense meter with every action she takes in her desperate search - and she climbs all over that plane, showing me places I never even knew existed.  The film's moment of truth comes toward the end, when the whole nature of the story suddenly takes a dramatic turn.  I think it comes through it with flying colors, giving us a highly satisfying ending - which is quite a feat for a film of this nature.Even if you were to hate the whole story, Flightplan is still worth watching for Jodie Foster alone.  With all of the movie stars filling up Hollywood these days, it's a rare treat to watch a true actress at work.

953663,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000BYY11O,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 1]","The premise for this mystery thriller in the skies is unique. The execution of it demonstrates good production craftsmanship by all aboard. The quarrels that some people have had mostly concern its 3rd act resolution, which I understand as less than satisfactory to this critical audience. Until someone comes up with a suggestion for a better way it might have satisfied the premise, I'll go with it. It's a taut trip, with unflagging suspense, a full plate of thriller goodies, and a high level performance by an actress who doesn't choose to make very many movies.The reason for the flight is a sad one. Kyle (Jodie Foster), a propulsion engineer who works on engines for airplanes, lost her husband in a fall from their apartment building in Berlin where he worked. She and 6-year old daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston) are flying his body back home for burial. The night before their departure, they are both spooked, she by a conviction that middle-eastern men seem to be spying on her from a building across the street and Fiona from fears brought on by her father's death. Kyle has all she can do to convince her daughter that she'll be safe on the airplane. Mom's an expert, isn't she? She knows the plane inside and out.In an effort to foreshadow what's to come, Julia, who is supposed to be insecure, wanders off from mom in the terminal, a cheap fright moment that sends Kyle into hysterics. From then on she'll be in skin contact with her daughter every step of the way.And so she is. They're first into the plane cabin and watch it slowly fill prior to takeoff. There is the family with two brat kids that continually have to be shut up and kept in their place by their parents. There's the guy across the aisle (Peter Sarsgaard) whose interest seems to be in the bodies of every female that saunters by. There is the group of arabs at the front of the cabin who give everyone the jitters. And, there is the efficient crew of stewardesses. Meanwhile, Kyle attends to Julia's every need. In flight, they fall asleep, still in skin contact. But, when Kyle awakens, Julia's gone. Gone where?Kyle keeps her anxiety in check, convinced that Julia has simply done again what she did in the terminal -- even after having promised she never would. The lech across the aisle introduces himself as Carson and softly assures her that he hasn't seen the girl. From here on it's a dizzying search in which Kyle can't find Julia's backpack that she herself stowed in the overhead rack, or anything else that could prove that her daughter has ever been aboard.She raises a stir among the crew by insisting that they perform a thorough search of the areas of the plane that are off limits to passengers, including the baggage section. Her fright and her demands bring the level-headed Captain Rich (Sean Bean) into the drama. Following protocol in such instances, he directs the crew to perform the search, which is not done in enough detail or dedication to please the increasingly desperate Kyle. It's her daughter, after all!But when the search shows nothing, and when the flight manifest shows no Julia aboard, and no one on the crew or in the passenger cabin remembers seeing Julia, the disappeance begins to look like the delusions of a woman in grief. It's even suggested that Julia died with her father and that Kyle is in a state of denial.But Kyle's not someone who responds well to patronization or therapy. She controls her hysteria and switches to defense mode. Creating diversions, she uses her intimate familiarity with every hidden hatch and entrance on the plane and conducts her own search. Before long, while inconvenienced by her innovative tactics, the passengers who were so disgusted by this woman's belligerence applaud her determination and initiative.Jodie Foster does the frantic head of the family under great stress and credible threat very well, as she so superbly demonstrated in an earlier state of panic (""Panic Room"").Sean Bean is admirably charismatic as a fair and patient arbiter of a difficult situation.

No one remembers seeing the child, so is the child really somewhere aboard the plane or is the mother crazy with grief from her husband's death?  Did the child perhaps die as well and she couldn't deal with both being dead, so in her mind she still sees the child?  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next.  Some reviewers said they guessed the surprise ending early on.  Maybe I don't watch enough movies because I did NOT guess it, until it was revealed.  Yes, there are some real problems with the plot, but I didn't notice it until others pointed it out.  The one thing that really bothered me was how could the highjackers be sure that the mother would open the coffin of her dead husband during the flight, so they could get their explosives hidden in the coffin?  That was a real long shot and depended on some very specific things happening that couldn't be controlled.  There were some other holes, but in the long run you are able to forgive a lot just because the movie stays interesting.  I wouldn't consider this a great performance by Foster, but it was passable.

There is no filler here, as after only about 12 minutes, Jodie Foster is already on the plane and the gripping plot takes hold.  It goes right up through to the very satisfying ending.  All 90 minute films should be this tight from beginning to end.It's Hitchocockian in nature, then it delves into the psychological-thrillers-of-recent genre, and makes you wonder where the film is really going to go.  I won't give it away, but if you are an action lover, this movie comes to it's completion pleasing just about any lover of thrill flicks.  I agree, if you sit back and analyze what you've just seen, the plot starts to get very thin, but fortunately the movie's brisk pace makes you forget all about that, and only concentrate on the excitement at hand.Jodie Foster is superb, and supporting actors Sean Bean as the Pilot/Captain, and Peter Saarsgard as the Air Marshall lend a strong hand to this minimal cast.  This also may be the best cinematography of any indoor type thriller, having about 95% of this take place inside this futuristic jumbo jet.

Foster plays her role well--she's basically sympathetic, but a little nutty and therefore questionable. The film holds its cards as long as it can, allowing the audience to puzzle for themselves as to whether or not it's all in Foster's head. The supporting cast is strong--Peter Sarsgaard is wonderful, as always, and I especially like the character of the Captain who is impossibly put upon. The suspense builds slowly to a nice climax at the end, paying off just about everything in the film to that point.

Foster is always a great actress, and the movie hinges on whether we can relate to her angst as a mother of a missing child.  If we can't identify w/her, this movie is toast.  Thankfully, as always, Foster comes through and we're able to feel her frustration as a person who is treated like some sort of mad woman when all she wants is to keep her daughter safe.Bean is very good as the kind & caring captain who is willing to give people the benefit-of-the-doubt.  He will do anything in his power to help a child in danger, but he is unsure whether such a child is actually on board his aircraft.While some of the components of this film are a bit contrived (if not outright far-fetched?), it still remains right on the outer cusp of believability.  There are some nice plot-twists, and it adds to the depth of the plot that Foster's character is an engineer who actually helped design the plane.If you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller, this is a good one to pick up.  While it does not seem like it early on, everything will make sense eventually.",4,Amber Alert in the sky,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,1432,"['movie', 'something', 'cross', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'presents', '9/11', 'themes', 'thrown', 'just', 'fun', 'missing', 'little', 'girl', 'huge', 'double-decker', 'passenger', 'jet', 'flying', 'Atlantic', 'missing', 'girl', 'Therein', 'crux', 'storyline.The', 'DVD', 'strong', 'performances', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Foster', 'always', 'great', 'actress', 'movie', 'can', 'relate', 'angst', 'mother', 'missing', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'w/her', 'movie', 'toast', 'Thankfully', 'always', 'Foster', ""'re"", 'able', 'feel', 'frustration', 'person', 'who', 'treated', 'sort', 'mad', 'woman', 'when', 'keep', 'daughter', 'safe.Bean', 'very', 'good', 'kind', 'caring', 'captain', 'who', 'willing', 'give', 'people', 'benefit-of-the-doubt', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'power', 'help', 'child', 'danger', 'unsure', 'child', 'actually', 'board', 'components', 'film', 'are', 'bit', 'contrived', 'not', 'outright', 'far-fetched', 'still', 'right', 'outer', 'cusp', 'believability', 'are', 'nice', 'plot-twists', 'depth', 'plot', 'Foster', 'character', 'engineer', 'who', 'actually', 'helped', 'design', 'plane.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'good', 'one', 'pick', 'up', 'not', 'seem', 'early', 'everything', 'will', 'make', 'sense', 'eventually']",N/A
953677,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BYY11O,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","Sorry to say that this airborne psychological thriller feels like an overextended episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" without the irony and with the additional burden of spiraling plot convolutions that amount to a constant decrease in altitude. Jodie Foster is always watchable, and here she pulls out her vast arsenal of pent-up talent to play Kyle Pratt, an aeronautics engineer who is grieving over the week-ago accidental death of her husband in Berlin. She decides to fly back to the states with her young daughter Julia in the expansive jumbo jet she helped design. About three hours after take-off and having awoken from a nap, Kyle discovers Julia is missing, and the plot turns into her frantic search against escalating odds - a disbelieving crew, angst-driven passengers and an alternately sympathetic and dispassionate air marshal. The stacked deck set-up sounds Hitchcockian, a modern-day update of ""The Lady Vanishes"", but the movie actually feels more like a derivative take on M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" with a Michael Bay-type mindset.For a movie that clocks in at 93 minutes, it feels unnecessarily long, and the search scenes drone on for quite a while without much emotional payoff. When the twists finally come to light, it becomes even more disappointing for the haphazard way it has all been presented. Director Robert Schwentke provides visual and aural interest but stumbles considerably on not only pacing but also providing a clear line of thought with the characters, their motivations and the subsequent actions. Some of the blame belongs to screenwriters Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray, who seem more preoccupied with layering the perceived plot developments as a means toward justifying a climax high on octane but devoid of reason. Contributing to the problem is a middle section that reminds me of the worst attributes of the ""Airport"" disaster movies of the 1970's. There is a potentially interesting scene involving post-9/11 paranoia, but even this angle is botched due to its exploitative nature.In what amounts to a retread of her ""Panic Room"" role, Foster manages the balance between desperation and tenacity with her trademark intelligence intact. The problem is that despite the new setting, the performance is unsurprising, and her unbridled strength doesn't resonate simply because we already expect her to be resourceful and uncompromising before the movie starts. Had her character upended Foster's persona, the movie would have been far more interesting. Another surprising disappointment is the generally reliable Peter Sarsgaard, who unfortunately falters quite badly as the air marshal. He seems too cerebral a presence to take on a role of such passive inconsistencies. Even though his role seems the most predictable, Sean Bean fares best as the conflicted plane captain who sympathizes with Kyle's plight but grows hesitant and wary over the mounting contrary evidence. Other fine actors are simply wasted such as Erika Christensen as an unobservant flight attendant and Greta Scacchi as an unctuous therapist.The DVD has a surprisingly robust package for a recent release with a five-chapter, 40-minute making-of documentary, ""The In-Flight Movie: The Making of Flightplan"", and a less interesting 10-minute featurette, ""Cabin Pressure: Designing the Aalto E-474"". Both do their job of making the film seem better than it truly is, though be forewarned that the plot is completely divulged in the former. Schwentke provides informative, sometimes quite insightful commentary on an alternative track. His remarks, especially around the ending sequences, show careful thoughtfulness about certain story elements, though the necessity of retakes proves not enough attention was paid to logical connections and emotional payoffs.",2,Illogical Plot Threads Sabotage a Patently Mainstream Thriller Awaiting Take-off,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,3786,"['Sorry', 'say', 'airborne', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'feels', 'overextended', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'irony', 'additional', 'burden', 'spiraling', 'plot', 'convolutions', 'amount', 'constant', 'decrease', 'altitude', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'always', 'watchable', 'here', 'out', 'vast', 'arsenal', 'pent-up', 'talent', 'play', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'aeronautics', 'engineer', 'who', 'grieving', 'week-ago', 'accidental', 'death', 'husband', 'Berlin', 'fly', 'back', 'states', 'young', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'expansive', 'jumbo', 'jet', 'helped', 'design', 'three', 'hours', 'take-off', 'having', 'awoken', 'nap', 'Kyle', 'Julia', 'missing', 'plot', 'frantic', 'search', 'escalating', 'odds', 'disbelieving', 'crew', 'angst-driven', 'passengers', 'alternately', 'sympathetic', 'dispassionate', 'air', 'marshal', 'stacked', 'deck', 'set-up', 'sounds', 'Hitchcockian', 'modern-day', 'update', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'movie', 'actually', 'more', 'derivative', 'take', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Michael', 'Bay-type', 'movie', '93', 'minutes', 'unnecessarily', 'long', 'search', 'drone', 'while', 'much', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'When', 'twists', 'finally', 'come', 'light', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing', 'haphazard', 'way', 'been', 'presented', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'visual', 'aural', 'interest', 'considerably', 'not', 'only', 'pacing', 'also', 'providing', 'clear', 'line', 'thought', 'characters', 'motivations', 'subsequent', 'actions', 'blame', 'screenwriters', 'Peter', 'A.', 'Dowling', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'who', 'seem', 'more', 'preoccupied', 'layering', 'perceived', 'plot', 'developments', 'justifying', 'climax', 'high', 'octane', 'devoid', 'reason', 'Contributing', 'problem', 'middle', 'section', 'worst', 'attributes', 'Airport', 'disaster', 'movies', '1970', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'scene', 'involving', 'post-9/11', 'paranoia', 'even', 'angle', 'botched', 'due', 'exploitative', 'nature.In', 'what', 'retread', 'Panic', 'Room', 'role', 'Foster', 'balance', 'desperation', 'tenacity', 'trademark', 'intelligence', 'intact', 'problem', 'new', 'setting', 'performance', 'unsurprising', 'unbridled', 'strength', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'simply', 'already', 'expect', 'be', 'resourceful', 'uncompromising', 'movie', 'Had', 'character', 'upended', 'Foster', 'persona', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'surprising', 'disappointment', 'generally', 'reliable', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'quite', 'badly', 'air', 'marshal', 'too', 'cerebral', 'presence', 'take', 'role', 'such', 'passive', 'inconsistencies', 'Even', 'role', 'most', 'predictable', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'best', 'conflicted', 'plane', 'captain', 'who', 'Kyle', 'plight', 'hesitant', 'wary', 'mounting', 'contrary', 'evidence', 'Other', 'fine', 'actors', 'are', 'simply', 'wasted', 'such', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'unobservant', 'flight', 'attendant', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'unctuous', 'therapist.The', 'DVD', 'surprisingly', 'robust', 'package', 'recent', 'release', 'five-chapter', '40-minute', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'In-Flight', 'Movie', 'Making', 'Flightplan', 'less', 'interesting', '10-minute', 'featurette', 'Cabin', 'Pressure', 'Designing', 'Aalto', 'E-474', 'do', 'job', 'making', 'film', 'seem', 'better', 'though', 'be', 'forewarned', 'plot', 'completely', 'divulged', 'former', 'Schwentke', 'informative', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'alternative', 'track', 'remarks', 'especially', 'ending', 'sequences', 'show', 'careful', 'thoughtfulness', 'certain', 'story', 'elements', 'necessity', 'retakes', 'proves', 'not', 'enough', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'logical', 'connections', 'emotional', 'payoffs']",N/A

953681,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B000BYY11O,Erik North,"[2, 2]","Although not necessarily the most plausible thriller ever made, let alone one set onboard a claustrophobic modern jet, FLIGHTPLAN is nevertheless one of the better ones of recent times largely thanks to another sterling performance by Jodie Foster, who, ever since her Oscar-winning turns in THE ACCUSED and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, has done fine jobs of portraying an Everywoman type.In this film, Foster is Kyle Pratt, the designer of a high-tech aircraft that is taking her, her daughter (Marlene Lawston), and their dead father back overseas from Germany to New York City.  At some point during the flight, however, after taking a nap, Foster awakens to find Lawston gone.  At first, Foster is apt to believe that her daughter is wandering somewhere in the cabin; but she quickly becomes terrified that something awful has happened to her.  Worst of all, none of the passengers or crew onboard claim to have even seen her, and the crew claims she is not on the passenger manifesto.  They all look upon her as being paranoid and a threat to the flight--all except for the air marshal (Peter Sarsgaard), who knows a lot about Foster's plight, and is in fact willing to make Foster look like a terroristic lackey.From the moment of Lewiston's disapperance to the final plot revelation, FLIGHTPLAN closely mirrors ""The Twilight Zone"" in its making Foster's distraught mother seem like she's losing her mind.  Much of the film's intense suspense comes not only from the fact that most of its action is set onboard a plane, but also from the fact that pretty much the entire film in set in the dead of night, offering considerable opportunities for fright, tension, and more than a little post-9/11 anxiety.  Sean Bean, who played a terrorist heavy in 1992's PATRIOT GAMES, is on hand as the conscientious pilot, and Sarsgaard makes for a good heavy (not to mention the fact that he looks a bit like Kiefer Sutherland at times), but it is Foster that is wisely kept the center of attention by director Robert Schwentke and screenwriters Peter Dowling and Billy Ray.Although the plot twist near the end is slightly predictable it does not in any way fatally compromise the film, making FLIGHTPLAN a well above average airborne thriller that is well worth seeing.",4,In-Flight Paranoia,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,2260,"['not', 'necessarily', 'most', 'plausible', 'thriller', 'ever', 'made', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'set', 'claustrophobic', 'modern', 'jet', 'FLIGHTPLAN', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'recent', 'times', 'largely', 'thanks', 'sterling', 'performance', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'ever', 'Oscar-winning', 'turns', 'THE', 'ACCUSED', 'THE', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'done', 'fine', 'jobs', 'portraying', 'Everywoman', 'type.In', 'film', 'Foster', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'designer', 'high-tech', 'aircraft', 'taking', 'daughter', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'dead', 'father', 'back', 'overseas', 'Germany', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'point', 'flight', 'however', 'taking', 'nap', 'Foster', 'find', 'Lawston', 'gone', 'first', 'Foster', 'apt', 'believe', 'daughter', 'wandering', 'somewhere', 'cabin', 'quickly', 'terrified', 'something', 'awful', 'happened', 'Worst', 'none', 'passengers', 'crew', 'onboard', 'claim', 'have', 'even', 'seen', 'crew', 'not', 'passenger', 'manifesto', 'look', 'upon', 'being', 'paranoid', 'threat', 'flight', 'air', 'marshal', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'lot', 'Foster', 'plight', 'fact', 'willing', 'make', 'Foster', 'look', 'terroristic', 'lackey.From', 'moment', 'Lewiston', 'disapperance', 'final', 'plot', 'revelation', 'FLIGHTPLAN', 'closely', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'making', 'Foster', 'distraught', 'mother', 'seem', 'losing', 'mind', 'Much', 'film', 'intense', 'suspense', 'not', 'only', 'fact', 'most', 'action', 'set', 'onboard', 'plane', 'also', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'film', 'set', 'dead', 'night', 'offering', 'considerable', 'opportunities', 'fright', 'tension', 'more', 'little', 'post-9/11', 'anxiety', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'played', 'terrorist', 'heavy', '1992', 'PATRIOT', 'GAMES', 'hand', 'conscientious', 'pilot', 'Sarsgaard', 'good', 'heavy', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'bit', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'times', 'Foster', 'wisely', 'kept', 'center', 'attention', 'director', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'screenwriters', 'Peter', 'Dowling', 'Billy', 'Ray.Although', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'not', 'way', 'fatally', 'compromise', 'film', 'making', 'FLIGHTPLAN', 'well', 'average', 'airborne', 'thriller', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

So, it is no shock that Kyle ends up going to sleep, with Julia close by of course. When she wakes up, she discovers that Julia is missing and as any mother would in such a situation, she freaks out. She demands that the flight crew help her search for her little girl and when they say they have looked everywhere, the fact that she is an engineer for the particular plane they are on helps as she snaps out other places where children may hide. Of course, her duaghter is not found and as the tension progresses and a US Marshall gets involved, it becomes quite evident that the entire flight crew seems to be hiding something. Of course, the real twist and turn is not as easily explained and I will not reveal it for the sake of surprise. Needless to say, I only saw part of the big reveal comming and I was completely blown away when the big moment transpired... and it happens about an hour or so into the movie. Erika Christensen offers a solid performance as a flight attendant;however, the role could have gone to any actress. Aside from Jody Foster, the actor who owned the screen time they had was Sean Bean who came off as a blend between a take charge general and a firm huggable teddy bear. He really made his part work. Peter Sarsgaard was serviceable as the US marshall and did what he had to do. He was a good guy that everyone loves to hate because he thinks he is doing the right thing even though the viewers know the truth. Waht the film boils down to is: is the mother a delusioned woman, on the verge of a breakdown or is she seriously in trouble.Flightplan isn't overtly violent although there a couple of moments. Racial profiling comes into play as an Arab man is accused because Kyle swears she saw him the night before outside her daughters bedroom. The ending of the film is a little over the top but it isn't crazy enough to make you go ""huh?"". So, overall, this movie delivers on the thrills. Some compared it to Red Eye, but the films are nothing alike. This one has a lot of unkowns and there are doubts cast that even viewers start to question what they think they know. A worthy buy... for sure.",4,Quite a Flight into suspense,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,2682,"['Flightplan', 'edge-of-your', 'seat', 'thriller', 'actually', 'life', 'instead', 'just', 'dropping', 'everyone', 'action', 'get', 'see', 'event', 'whole', 'purpose', 'story', 'Kyle', 'played', 'multi-facettly', 'always', 'divine', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'newcommer', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'get', 'plane', 'headed', 'New', 'York', 'man', 'life', 'daddy-husband', 'sad', 'opening', 'even', 'two', 'try', 'make', 'light', 'situation', 'curcumstances', 'voyage', 'hang', 'heavy', 'black', 'cloud', 'So', 'shock', 'Kyle', 'up', 'going', 'sleep', 'Julia', 'close', 'course', 'When', 'up', 'Julia', 'missing', 'mother', 'would', 'such', 'situation', 'out', 'flight', 'crew', 'help', 'search', 'little', 'girl', 'when', 'say', 'have', 'looked', 'everywhere', 'fact', 'engineer', 'particular', 'plane', 'are', 'helps', 'out', 'other', 'places', 'where', 'children', 'may', 'hide', 'course', 'duaghter', 'not', 'found', 'tension', 'US', 'Marshall', 'involved', 'quite', 'evident', 'entire', 'flight', 'crew', 'be', 'hiding', 'something', 'course', 'real', 'twist', 'turn', 'not', 'easily', 'explained', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'sake', 'surprise', 'Needless', 'say', 'only', 'saw', 'part', 'big', 'reveal', 'comming', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'when', 'big', 'moment', 'transpired', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'solid', 'performance', 'flight', 'attendant', 'however', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'actress', 'Aside', 'Jody', 'Foster', 'actor', 'who', 'owned', 'screen', 'time', 'had', 'was', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'who', 'came', 'off', 'blend', 'take', 'charge', 'general', 'firm', 'huggable', 'teddy', 'bear', 'really', 'made', 'part', 'work', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'was', 'serviceable', 'US', 'marshall', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'good', 'guy', 'everyone', 'hate', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'even', 'viewers', 'know', 'truth', 'film', 'down', 'mother', 'delusioned', 'woman', 'verge', 'breakdown', 'seriously', 'trouble.Flightplan', ""n't"", 'overtly', 'violent', 'couple', 'moments', 'Racial', 'profiling', 'play', 'Arab', 'man', 'accused', 'Kyle', 'saw', 'night', 'daughters', 'bedroom', 'ending', 'film', 'little', 'top', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'enough', 'make', 'go', 'huh', 'So', 'overall', 'movie', 'thrills', 'compared', 'Red', 'Eye', 'films', 'are', 'nothing', 'alike', 'one', 'lot', 'unkowns', 'are', 'doubts', 'cast', 'even', 'viewers', 'start', 'question', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'worthy', 'buy', 'sure']",N/A

Dowling and Billy Ray is excellent on creating tension from the first frames of the film well into the uni-set stage of an impossibly huge airplane.  Little things like scenes of isolation, snow, ice, coffins - all set the viewer up for a thriller.  Atmosphere 5, story 3.The plot is so well known from other reviews that it merits no re-hash here.  But the 'driven mother' against the free-floating anxiety of air travel and espionage in the post-911 is what keeps this film airborne.  If the viewer can appreciate the possibilities of how even a scientific mind like that of aeronautics engineer Kyle (Jodie Foster) can splinter in the days following the death of her husband coupled with the added emotional burden of helping her child understand death, coffins, terror etc then the story will be gripping.  The performances are fine - especially Foster in yet another superfemale role, but also Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, and the supporting cast and crew of the beleaguered icy airplane.At some point, however, the atmosphere must support a solid, intelligent story, one that is without holes in credibility, if it is to rate high on the Terror/Thriller/Suspense factor. The cinematography and musical score both support the director's vision. FLIGHTPLAN  tries very hard but ends up feeling like a sellout somewhere along the line.

It has this dark ambience to it that really goes with the flow and screenplay. Flightplan is not really the kind of film that will make you jump from your seat and want to scream. This is probably why most people didn't like it. I liked Flightplan because of the staunch conviction of one mother against a few hundred odd. Most of the film is shot in that airplane and after the film ended I felt like I came out of one huge airplane. There is a very subtle humor about some of the dialogues in the film and although there is no real thunderous suspense, the film manages to just touch the right emotional chord that it seeks to. There is an Arab angle on the film which I found very interesting. Please be well informed that this is NOT A FILM FOR SHORT ATTENTION SPAN TEENAGERS who wish to see a plane explode like Final Destination. I will strongly consider buying the dvd if I have enough spare cash to.Flightplan is made with a patient bent of mind which is probably why despite the critics outcry it will do well. I do not really think one should think twice before going to the theater and watching it. It is worth every buck you pay.

953700,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,B000BYY11O,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[4, 6]","The premise might sound a little silly: a mother wakens after a 3-hour nap on a plane, and finds her six-year-old daughter missing. The passengers and crew are understandably not very concerned. They're on a plane, after all - how far away could the little girl be?The tension of the film unfolds in finding out just how far that might be - and whether or not the woman Kyle Pratt, a propulsion engineer who had worked on the engines of this new class of aircraft, was imagining having brought her daughter on board.She could have. Her husband died less than a week ago, in what seemed like an accidental fall. Terrible fears of his possibly having committed suicide are lying in Kyle's mind, because it's hard to understand how he could possibly have fallen. She hallucinates him next to her in a Berlin train station, trying to lose herself in the comfort of this imagining because it's more bearable than the empty hollow feeling of the truth of her loss.As Kyle goes hand-in-hand with the apparition of her husband to sit outside after she returns home from ensuring that his coffin is sealed at the mortuary, ready for transportation to America where her parents are, a stunning and beautiful scene is shown of ""his"" arm sweeping clean the snow from a bench, and birds dispersing in sudden flight. The camera looks down at the face of Kyle, and she is (of course) alone...So we know that this is a woman holding in a terrible pain and under an enormous tension of loss. The opening image of the film is sheer genius - Jodie Foster's back is to the camera, and in that still image the viewer can quite literally see the pain and the hollowness caused by that pain of that lonely figure.Significant moments are seen when Jodie's character, Kyle, goes inside to check on her six-year-old daughter, a solemn charmer with a strong look of Jodie Foster herself. The daughter is clearly suffering from the loss as well, and Kyle, as she goes to close the curtains, sees two men of Middle Eastern appearance in a room opposite. They seem to be looking in her direction. Is it of importance? Does it mean anything? Yes - but perhaps not as one might expect.The feeling of nightmare implacability as Kyle wakens on the plane to find her vulnerable daughter nowhere to be found notches up the tension with a well-judged hand. It's true that there are several points in the plot which stretch plausibility a little, but this doesn't lessen the impact, particularly as the important point here is not - who did it, but rather - is she imagining it all?It's because the character of Kyle (and what is real to her) is central that the deliberate slowing of pace for scenes that show her fragile state are so important. The scene with the sympathetic psychologist is a masterpiece of timing, allowing Jodie Foster to show how easily a vulnerable individual can have their mind convinced of imagining something, irrespective of whether the events that are being doubted might be true.This is a psychological thriller above all, and while some viewers might well see the resolution coming, the moment of revelation is beautifully done. I have to admit I did not like the final scene with Kyle's exit from the plane (you will know what I mean when you see it, and will understand, I think, why I consider it cheesy and not of the same high standard as the majority of this film), but in almost every respect, this is a high quality thriller that handles itself very well.Recommended.

It's like watching any Keanu Reeves or Casper Van Dien movie - the viewer simply has to go with the flow and accept the mediocrity.Jodie Foster plays the paranoid propulsion engineer on a red eye from Berlin to New York.  She is taking the flight with her daughter on a plane that is a double-decker, but shot like flying palace.  One would think they were on the Titanic in the air.  Come to think of it, I think I would have preferred a massive crash as opposed to the actual premise.Anyhow, Foster wakes up to find her 6-year old daughter missing, with only a blanket and a teddy bear where she once was.  Foster immediately changes to translucent white like a chameleon, displaying true anxiety and terror of which very few in Hollywood are capable.  As a frequent flyer, I immediately sympathized with the other passengers, and was hoping that someone would punch Jodie Foster into unconciousness.Nonetheless, Foster rants and raves up the aisles, disturbing all other passengers more than a Middle Eastern family with two angry, 20-something sons and triplette babies who have ear-infections in a pressurized cabin.  She gets the pilot upset, the flight marshall upset, and every stewardess surely wants to strangle her with one of the rubber chords off of an emergency oxygen mask.Despite the plausability problem - so nobody else saw her daughter getting on the plane? - there were other issues that troubled me about the movie.  Exactly how many secret passageways and doors are on this plane?  I thought that I was watching a Cribs episode at Michael Jackson's house for a moment.  Also, in today's hypersensitive air-travel environment, there is no possibility that she would have been able to run rampant throughout the plane without being subdued by an employee or tackled by a fellow passenger with air-rage.  In real life Foster not only would have been looking for her daughter, but also a fist-full of hair and about six of her teeth on the floor of the cabin.It's about as believable as Snakes on a Plane, and because of the great acting and superb cinematography, it's a worthwhile movie to watch on a rainy afternoon.",3,Far from Foster's best,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2282,"['Flightplan', 'one', 'movies', 'requiring', 'ultimate', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'one', 'audience', 'really', 'put', 'blinders', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'movie', 'viewer', 'simply', 'go', 'flow', 'accept', 'mediocrity.Jodie', 'Foster', 'paranoid', 'propulsion', 'engineer', 'red', 'eye', 'Berlin', 'New', 'York', 'taking', 'flight', 'daughter', 'plane', 'double-decker', 'shot', 'flying', 'palace', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'were', 'Titanic', 'air', 'Come', 'think', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'massive', 'crash', 'opposed', 'actual', 'premise.Anyhow', 'Foster', 'up', 'find', '6-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'missing', 'only', 'blanket', 'teddy', 'bear', 'where', 'once', 'was', 'Foster', 'immediately', 'translucent', 'white', 'chameleon', 'displaying', 'true', 'anxiety', 'terror', 'very', 'few', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'capable', 'frequent', 'flyer', 'immediately', 'sympathized', 'other', 'passengers', 'was', 'hoping', 'someone', 'would', 'punch', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'unconciousness.Nonetheless', 'Foster', 'rants', 'up', 'aisles', 'disturbing', 'other', 'passengers', 'more', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'family', 'two', 'angry', '20-something', 'sons', 'triplette', 'babies', 'who', 'have', 'ear-infections', 'pressurized', 'cabin', 'pilot', 'upset', 'flight', 'marshall', 'upset', 'stewardess', 'surely', 'strangle', 'one', 'rubber', 'chords', 'emergency', 'oxygen', 'mask.Despite', 'plausability', 'problem', 'so', 'nobody', 'else', 'saw', 'daughter', 'getting', 'plane', 'were', 'other', 'issues', 'troubled', 'movie', 'Exactly', 'how', 'many', 'secret', 'passageways', 'doors', 'are', 'plane', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'Cribs', 'episode', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'house', 'moment', 'Also', 'today', 'hypersensitive', 'air-travel', 'environment', 'possibility', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'run', 'rampant', 'plane', 'being', 'subdued', 'employee', 'tackled', 'fellow', 'passenger', 'air-rage', 'real', 'life', 'Foster', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'daughter', 'also', 'fist-full', 'hair', 'six', 'teeth', 'floor', 'cabin.It', 'as', 'believable', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'great', 'acting', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'watch', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[0, 0]","It's an interesting premise, and oddly similar to Foster's previous film, `Panic Room,' in which her maternal character is forced into a confined space with no outlet. In keeping with most of Foster's performances, she plays a strong-willed, intelligent woman who overcomes difficult circumstances. As expected, Foster delivers, and pulls the audience into the story. I was disappointed, however. Foster has more to offer than `Flight plan' is capable of giving her. `FlightPlan', while entertaining, remains among those psychological-thrill-rides that are only as successful as their audience is unsuccessful in knowing the truth during the course of the film. To achieve this, the film has to throw a slew of false leads and suspicious looking characters into early shots in order to have the audience questioning.I'm not fond of this technique. It's possible to keep the audience in suspense, and guessing without trickery. To me, this degrades the integrity of a storyline.The real problem with `FlightPlan' is that the more you think back, the more you become frustrated with how inconceivable the whole charade was; the more you become irritated with how often you were lead to wonder about something eventually irrelevant. There are some films that don't give you all the answers and pull you along on a suspenseful ride, and leave you feeling fulfilled when you finally figure everything out, and everything fits together. `FlightPlan' concludes, you know the culprit, and then you think back, and nothing fits together.This film does a good job at depicting the post 9/11 atmosphere one gets when riding an airplane, everything from undercover air marshals to passengers being wary of Arabs. It also reminds us of how annoying airplane flights can be, with hyperactive kids acting up right in front of you, or snobby passengers who say things like, ""It's not like she lost her Palm Pilot."" By the middle of the film, most of the passengers are just as patronizing, as they clap when the Air Marshal escorted her back to her seat after causing a stir.If one is expecting an original story, he/she will likely come out disappointed. However, it remains enjoyable if one just sees it simply as a story that, while not original, is a story well-told.",3,She's definitely one mother you don't want to mess with.,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,2255,"['interesting', 'premise', 'oddly', 'similar', 'Foster', 'previous', 'film', 'Panic', 'Room', 'maternal', 'character', 'forced', 'confined', 'space', 'outlet', 'keeping', 'most', 'Foster', 'performances', 'strong-willed', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'who', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'expected', 'Foster', 'delivers', 'audience', 'story', 'was', 'disappointed', 'however', 'Foster', 'more', 'offer', 'Flight', 'plan', 'capable', 'giving', 'FlightPlan', 'entertaining', 'psychological-thrill-rides', 'are', 'only', 'as', 'successful', 'audience', 'unsuccessful', 'knowing', 'truth', 'course', 'film', 'achieve', 'film', 'throw', 'slew', 'false', 'leads', 'suspicious', 'looking', 'characters', 'early', 'shots', 'order', 'have', 'audience', 'questioning.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fond', 'technique', 'possible', 'keep', 'audience', 'suspense', 'guessing', 'trickery', 'integrity', 'storyline.The', 'real', 'problem', 'FlightPlan', 'more', 'think', 'back', 'more', 'become', 'frustrated', 'how', 'inconceivable', 'whole', 'charade', 'was', 'more', 'become', 'irritated', 'how', 'often', 'were', 'lead', 'wonder', 'something', 'eventually', 'irrelevant', 'are', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'answers', 'pull', 'along', 'suspenseful', 'ride', 'leave', 'feeling', 'fulfilled', 'when', 'finally', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'everything', 'fits', 'together', 'FlightPlan', 'concludes', 'know', 'culprit', 'then', 'think', 'back', 'nothing', 'fits', 'together.This', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'post', '9/11', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'when', 'riding', 'airplane', 'everything', 'undercover', 'air', 'marshals', 'passengers', 'being', 'wary', 'Arabs', 'also', 'how', 'annoying', 'airplane', 'flights', 'can', 'be', 'hyperactive', 'kids', 'acting', 'up', 'right', 'front', 'snobby', 'passengers', 'who', 'say', 'things', 'not', 'lost', 'Palm', 'Pilot', 'middle', 'film', 'most', 'passengers', 'are', 'just', 'patronizing', 'clap', 'when', 'Air', 'Marshal', 'escorted', 'back', 'seat', 'causing', 'stir.If', 'one', 'expecting', 'original', 'story', 'he/she', 'will', 'likely', 'come', 'out', 'disappointed', 'However', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'just', 'simply', 'story', 'not', 'original', 'story', 'well-told']",N/A

The movie 'Flight Plan,' successfully twists and turns the plot without giving away the end until the perfect moment. Jodie Foster plays the character of a disgruntled mother, distressed by the loss of her husband. She takes him back for burial from Germany to NY, her daughter with her. When Foster's character and her 6 year old daughter fall asleep, the action picks up quite significantly, and very successfully with so small a setting. (It's on a plane, guys) When she wakes up, her young daughter is gone. Frantically she searches, but to no avail...and then comes the twist...no one remembers seeing a little girl about 6 years old on the plane that matches the description of her daughter. The acting is incredible, especially that of Jodie Foster (Contact, Panic Room) and Sean Bean (National Treasure, Lord of the Rings). The setting contributes to the mood for the plane gives a sense of isolation, yet through her knowledge of the plane business (Foster's character is an engineer), she essentially takes us to many different areas that regular customers have never seen, adding to the mysterious and suspenseful mood as well as the twisting plot. The movie brings in many modern themes associated with today, and even has a few bits of comic relief that are so essential to a suspenseful plot, for it keeps the audience near the edge of their seats, but not toppling out of them. I would recommend paying the outrageous 9 dollar fee to go see this movie, for seeing it on the big screen I am sure will do much to add to the effect.

The movie starsJodie Foster as Kyle Pratt, an engineer living in Berlin who's husband has fell from their building to his death. Returning to the states with her young daughter Julia (and her husband's coffin in the holding of the plane) she begins the long plane ride back to the states. Then, Kyle falls asleep and when she wakes up her daughter's gone. As she investigates, she discovers not only is her daughter missing but there is no record of her ever boarding the plane and the flight attendant claims that during the count her daughter was not there. Despite her efforts, no one believes her except for the pilot (Sean Bean), one of the flight attendants (Erika Christensen), and the Air Marshall, Carson (Peter Sarsgaard, finally getting into mainstream films from the indie films he's occupied for the last few years). But even these people soon start to just see her as a delusional woman suffering from the death of her daughter. So is she delusional or is her daughter really on the plane somewhere? Anyway, as I mentioned before all the performances are top notch. I've always liked Sarsgaard and while he appears to be stoned in a few of the scenes he's great as the bad guy that you can't help but like. Foster, as always, is great although she's starting to really show her age in some of the scenes. Also, the guy who keeps verbally and physically attacking the Arabs aboard the plane when something goes wrong was very funny.

953727,A2GM9GNP2G8HO1,B000BYY11O,J. R. SOUTH,"[1, 2]","Although I felt I had an advance grasp of the ""Flightplan"" plot based on all the previews and the critics' assessments, I was pleasantly shocked to see there was a lot more to the story than I had suspected.  There's the eerie, nightmarish prologue with Kyle (Foster) sitting in an empty subway station waiting for an (almost) empty train; the mysterious death of her husband; and the unsettling pre-suggestion that her daughter may indeed already be dead before the film even started.  As others have stated, ""Flightplan"" borrows a lot from Hitchcock's ""The Lady Vanishes"" and Otto Preminger's ""Bunny Lake Is Missing"".  However, this movie is presented in a modern, sad, alienated atmosphere.  With the exception of Kyle and her daughter, Julia (sweet Marlene Lawston), every character comes across as a cold-hearted lug head, immune to Kyle's pain and her logic.  Interestingly, this attitude forces Jodie's character to desperate actions of cruelty of her own, subjecting unsuspecting air travelers to terrorist extremes, doing whatever is necessary to lead her to her child.  This movie might have benefited from at least a touch of Hitchcockian humor somewhere along the line, but director Robert Schwentke and the editors have left the audience without relief, and it is a valid choice.  The unrelenting suspense and dread of ""Flightplan"" made me queasy, but I wasn't bored for a second.Once again, Jodie Foster is amazing.  Even though we clearly know her as a celebrity, she is one of those actors whose dramatic skills are such that two minutes after she's appeared onscreen, the audience forgets the star and goes totally with the character.  What a gift that is!  Watch J.F. in the shots where she's not the focus of the camera, but almost just out of range during someone else's interaction.  I was struck by her breathing, which of course is unheard, but visible as her shoulders rise and fall, anxiety forcing her to take in more oxygen.  Foster's make-up person also deserves a kudo for Kyle's pale, cool skin tone, blending with the outward wintry-steel-look of the film, but conflicting with, and thereby drawing attention to, her warm, motherly personality.A friend of mine who is a flight attendant was horrified and disgusted by the way the crew was depicted, which I understand is common in the airline industry.  True, they are over-the-top heartless bimbos and bimbettes (two of them have sex in an overhead compartment while they've been assigned to find a missing six-year-old).  But since no one else in the supporting cast seems to have more than an ounce of humanity, I don't think it should be taken too personally.  Witness the annoying mother and father, constantly trying to reign in their obnoxious kids, as though they had never before taught them a minimum of  politeness.  Overall, director Schwentke has held the mirror up and shown us a very bleak view of today's society.No, I still can't quite make heads or tails of the reasoning behind the true plot of ""Flightplan"" once all the secrets are unveiled.  But what movie does not demand that we suspend more than a little bit of common sense?  My only quibble is with Peter Sarsgaard, who looks uncomfortable and drowsy, not up to performing against Jodie, like the supporting players in ""Panic Room"".  If only every Jodie Foster movie had a role for Anthony Hopkins!  Still it's a great move, totally worthy of five stars.But, hey, Jodie!  How about singing lessons and a musical-comedy next?

They are taking her husband's body back to America on a new airplane that Kyle helped design.  Early on she takes a nap,  and awakes to find her daughter missing.  The plane is searched; no one remembers seeing the child, the flight crew  doubts Kyle's sanity, and there may be terrorists aboard.The story was so intense and believable that I was on the edge of my seat for the first three-quarters of the film; the pace slows considerably after we learn the secret, but it is still a riveting movie.  Foster is well-cast as the hysterical but strong mother and she gives a memorable performance.  Sean Bean is very good as the pilot who wants to be sympathetic, but suspects Kyle is delusional.  Peter Sarsgaard is convincing as the air marshal who handles the case.This is an exciting thriller; despite taking place mostly on board a plane, it never gets boring.

953739,A1H6P9THIMDJOS,B000BYY11O,"kristin724 ""kristin724""","[0, 0]","I didn't expect to see the airplane thriller genre to revive anytime soon after 9/11, but the claustrophobic, understandably turbulent action offshoot made famous by the likes of Executive Decision and Air Force One never actually went away. Unfortunately real life events are still forcing a fictional tone down, but the 2002 Jodi Foster thriller Flightplan embraces the new less on action, more on brains turnabout.Flightplan begins with former Engineer Kyle Pratt (Jodi Foster) preparing for a flight from Germany to America. Pratt and her six year old daughter (Marlene Lawston) are transporting her husband's coffin home, and understandably so, both mother and daughter are upset and confused. Kid is very fearful of the outdoors and the jumbo plan designed by Pratt. The packed double decker plane provides little comfort to the family, and when Mrs. Pratt wakes up from a restless sleep, she discovers her situation has gotten worse. Every mother's fear-kid has disappeared. When evidence implies that kid was never even on board the plane, both the crew and passengers suspect Pratt of foul play.While researching for this review, I was surprised to find Jodi Foster's role was intended for Sean Penn. The change is nominal-the masculine first name of Kyle is only mentioned once in the film, and although it would have been intriguing to see a father dealing with the loss of a six year old, the vigilante father theme has been done before. I wouldn't think the role out of Penn's range, especially now, as an older subdued actor. For Foster however, the role comes almost too easy. Make no mistake, her performance was spot on, and no doubt about it, this is Jodi's film. Her facial realizations, actions, and movements are just right, yet it seems we've seen Foster in this kind of role before with previous hits Little Man Tate and Panic Room. Yet still, she adds her own spin on this near hysterical, yet highly intelligent mother. Panic Room was more action and stunts and about strong women taking control. Here, you would have somehow expected a man to be a propulsion engineer-except Foster plays Pratt as sympathetic, yet always with her wits about her. Not an easy line to walk, and its probably Foster's Oscar winning talent that makes it seem so effortless and nonchalant.I was impressed with the mostly unknown cast that holds its own with Foster. We see just enough of daughter Julia for the seeds of a realistic relationship, and hey, it's a cute kid. Who wants to have her kidnapped, really? I've not seen Peter Sarsgaard before, but his portrayal of the ambiguous marshal Mike is equally subdued versus Foster. Likewise, Erika Christensen becomes fishy as the lone flight attendant who may be trying to help Foster, as does contentious stewardess Stephanie (Kate Beahan). The dialogue between all is tight and real, including the swift references to Foster simply as `Mrs. Pratt'. They are all just trying to be so polite!Kudos to director Robert Schwentke and writers Peter Dowling and Billy Ray for keeping the film multi cultural and languaged. On-plane video and the jet's crew are often heard repeating everything that's said in English, German, and French. Making a film like this with an American protagonist and a solely American crew is simply not realistic.Fortunately, the most obvious antagonist in Flightplan is Sean Bean as Captain Rich. His attempts at sympathy toward Pratt try his patience-and he seems quite the jerk. His flat out questioning of Pratt's drinking or medication and labored indulgence of her absurd requests allude to a Twilight Zone feeling. Is there no one on Pratt's side? Why does she have such blind faith in the Captain's control of the plane? Thinking of his crew and passengers first makes Bean-who is very well known to American audiences for his villainous turns in Patriot Games, Goldeneye, and Don't Say A Word- look like the bad guy. His uppity British tone had a tinge of villainy, but of course, early on you learn that nothing in Flightplan is what it seems.Flightplan excels in delighting the mind over the action. We've seen films like Turbulence that pride themselves on how much they can make their prop plane shake, but Pratt's knowledge of aeronautics and aviation provide smart set ups and believable in-flight action. The references to the 9/11 attacks are also well played. You can't not mention it or how its change airline procedures. How the crew and passengers react to these restrictions in the unusual situation of having a child onboard go missing is more suspenseful and mind thrilling than losing cabin pressure.The believability of a child missing on a plane-How many places could there be? It's not like she could leave!- is helped by the ultra slick set of the plane. Lush bars and crew areas, double decker passenger lounges, spacious cockpit. The posh look of the common plane areas is state of the art, and the underbelly sequences are dark, cramped, full of mechanics-very realistic. If you don't know what the innards of a plane look like, you can imagine with Flightplan.The behind the scenes features on the widescreen DVD are standard enough-and by the way, do get widescreen even if you are still clinging to full screen viewings. The scope of the plane and flying cannot be fully realized with a cropped picture. Schwentke and his team shed light on the featurettes, along with cast interviews, screen tests, and the usually movie magic reveals. What amazes me most about Flightplan is while it does have some potentially scary scenes and the obligatory plane explosions, the film is quite family friendly.Younger children may be frightened by the kidnapping set up or death talk-especially children that might have recollections of September 11th, but thinking kids 10 and up might enjoy a night in with Flightplan. Enough action, realistic folks to root for, and very little blood or language. Parents beware, however, over a few scenes involving the stereotyping of Arab passengers. I don't suspect that is something even the smartest kid could really understand.The conclusion of Flightplan, unfortunately, leaves a bit to desire. After showcasing Foster's intelligence, the ending relies on one the the bad's cohorts to confess everything. It's also a bit foolish to have Pratt ultimately destroy the evidence that could clear her without the cohort's capture. Still, all parties carry their performances through to the end. Not only carry, but step up as the story unfolds to its inevitable- if potential let down- ending.But hey, it's tough for parents to find a film the whole family can watch. Even if you think your children are too young to understand the finer points of Flightplan, it's not the kind of film you have to keep looking your shoulder for while you watch. Let the kids cheer for something-and perhaps get a lesson and some food for thought with the entertainment.",4,Thriller for Families!,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,6894,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect',

Then she is watched by an air marshall and even restrained. Each time she manages to slip away to continue the hunt for her missing child no one believes ever boarded the plane.Flightplan is no classic and is not such a thriller that viewers will become terrified of flying.

However, many people do not remember seeing a child accompanying Kyle.  With another panic attack, she runs to the captain's deck.  However, she's quickly subdued by an undercover air marshal (Sarsgaard).  Finally, the captain comes out to meet Kyle.  However, he's suspicious of her because her story doesn't match the manifests.A partial search is done.  In frustration, Kyle manages to accuse a couple of Arabic men of taking her child.  She claimed that these men were the ones looking at her window the previous night.  Her accusation has caused everyone else to be wary of the Arabic men for the duration of the flight.Refusing to believe that she has lost her mind as everyone keeps telling her, Kyle goes on a mission to find and save her daughter.  This is where she puts her knowledge of the plane's systems to use.  Things get really interesting from here on to the end.Did she lose her daughter as she lost her husband?

A student asked if Memorex was a new system for her iPod. So much for the subtle and allegedly unintentional put downs of aging.I like Jodie Foster. A child star like Cruise she stays out of the limelight, has her own private life and makes darn good movies. Odd. A little avante garde, she commands your attention and your respect. Which is kind of like what ""Flightplan"" does. It commands your attention, which is good for the film but has a downside to it as well.She's a propulsion engineer and and darn good (as we would suspect) and is carrying the remains of her husband on this flight from Berlin to the U.S.A.  Now that's kind of eerie, and we find out about it in sort of an offhanded manner. Hubby died by accident we are told and sold. Yet there also is something strange going on here at 30,000 feet.So her daughter (not Dakota Fanning . . . . Ms. Foster knows that a child star can ""steal"" a film) and Foster are sitting in coach and Mommy draws a 'heart' on the condensation on her  window. Later when the daughter disappears and Mom is just starting to believe that those anti-D pills she's taking ARE making her nuts, the 'heart' mystically reappears and she's reaffirmed that someone stole her child. At 30,000 feet.Sean Bean, the best ""supporting"" actor around (see him in North Country - like the Guiness commercial - ""brilliant"") is the skipper in the Left Seat and does a credible if a sorely missed and unused job. The brother can do so much more.Visually appealing and great 'madwoman' filming, the picture doesn't measure up to scrutiny. Certainly she would know the ins and outs of the aircraft as we already believe she's a gifted engineer. But how would you steal a child at 30,000 feet? It does play on post 911 paranoia, which is why you could never lose a passenger boarding a flight. She's six years old, not a pet. And then my own little 'whoops' is the heart coming and going. No condensation in the cabin. Bad for air. Bad for passengers. Another question is if she's the real deal and a fantastic engineer, why is she in coach? She wants to get down with the people?Visually pleasing, good filming, evil co-conspirators, but kind of an unbelievable plot. Ms. Foster is, as always, great. 4 stars.

953747,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BYY11O,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","""Flightplan"" is a movie that wants to start playing with your mind before you ever see the movie.  After all, the hook for the movie is certainly good enough to stand on its own.  A woman and her daughter are on an airplane over the Atlantic Ocean, and the daughter disappears.  How can a child disappear on an airplane?  Well, you the idea should be that you go to see the movie and you find out the answer.  After all, we went to go see ""Titanic"" to see how Kate Winslet's character was going to survive when we see her riding the stern of the ship in to the Atlantic Ocean in the trailer.  But the trailer for ""Flightplan"" plays out a lot more of the line, because the people on the airplane are all telling the mother that nobody saw her with a child, there is no record on the manifest, and basically telling the audience that there was never a child.So we start watching ""Flightplan"" knowing about the hook and the line, and waiting to find out what the sinker is for this 2005 film.  Consequently, everything that happens from the first moment of the film is a clue for us to try and unravel.  The mother, Kyle Pratt (Jodie Foster) is in the bedroom of her daughter, Julia (Marlene Lawston), in their Berlin home and the kids seems real enough.  But then we see Kyle talking with her husband: one minute he is there, the next minute he is not.  Then he is in a coffin being loaded on an airplane that is the biggest one you have ever seen and which is taking mother and daughter to the United States.The script by first time screenwriter Peter A. Dowling and punched up by Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass""), takes full advantage of every nook and cranny in that giant airplane.  The ace in the hole that the increasingly distraught Kyle has in her favor is that she works for the company that built the big airplane so that she can list in detail all of the places where a six-year-old girl could disappear.  More importantly, beyond the idea of a mother getting upset over the sudden disappearance of her child, there is something quite unsettling about seeing Jodie Foster play a character who has gone over the edge.  I was a bit uneasy watching her character wilt before the investigating committee at the end of ""Contract,"" and when she starts coming apart at the seems here it is disquieting because Foster's strength is in playing characters who push back when they get pushed.  But hang in there.  It just takes a while for Kyle to start pushing back.In the meanwhile, the film does an effective job of stripping her of her inherent sympathy to the point that the crew and passengers become convinced Kyle is just a crazy woman.  It is the realization of how their thinking that will keep her from finding her daughter, who may or may not be there, that brings Kyle back from the edge as she deals with Carson (Peter Sarsgaard), the sky marshal, Captain Rich (Sean Bean), the pilot, and flight attendants Stephanie (Kate Beahan), Fiona (Erika Christensen), and Claudia (Jane Kolesarova).""Flightplan"" works pretty well the first time, which is to say that I did not figure it out.  However, when it is over you should be able to figure out how tenuous a house of cards has been created for director Robert Schwentke's film.  Letting the audience be ahead of the game at the start of the film is actually the key way this movie keeps audiences from figuring it out.  The explanation makes sense and all of the pieces fit, but in retrospect it seems a ludicrous path for a story to take.  Fortunately, Foster's performance helps keep this one longer in the air that most actresses could have managed.  The rest of the cast certainly helps, but Foster does the heavy lifting on this one.",4,Jodie Foster's daughter disappears on an airplane and she wants her found,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,3694,"['Flightplan', 'movie', 'start', 'playing', 'mind', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'hook', 'movie', 'certainly', 'good', 'enough', 'stand', 'own', 'woman', 'daughter', 'are', 'airplane', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'daughter', 'How', 'can', 'child', 'disappear', 'airplane', 'Well', 'idea', 'should', 'be', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'answer', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'Titanic', 'see', 'how', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'survive', 'when', 'see', 'riding', 'stern', 'ship', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'Flightplan', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'line', 'people', 'airplane', 'are', 'telling', 'mother', 'nobody', 'saw', 'child', 'record', 'manifest', 'basically', 'telling', 'audience', 'was', 'never', 'child.So', 'start', 'watching', 'Flightplan', 'knowing', 'hook', 'line', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'sinker', '2005', 'film', 'Consequently', 'everything', 'first', 'moment', 'film', 'clue', 'try', 'unravel', 'mother', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'bedroom', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'Berlin', 'home', 'kids', 'real', 'enough', 'then', 'see', 'Kyle', 'talking', 'husband', 'one', 'minute', 'there', 'next', 'minute', 'not', 'Then', 'coffin', 'being', 'loaded', 'airplane', 'biggest', 'one', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'taking', 'mother', 'daughter', 'United', 'States.The', 'script', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter', 'Peter', 'A.', 'Dowling', 'punched', 'up', 'Billy', 'Ray', 'Shattered', 'Glass', 'full', 'advantage', 'nook', 'cranny', 'giant', 'airplane', 'ace', 'hole', 'increasingly', 'distraught', 'Kyle', 'favor', 'company', 'built', 'big', 'airplane', 'can', 'list', 'detail', 'places', 'where', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'could', 'disappear', 'More', 'importantly', 'idea', 'mother', 'getting', 'upset', 'sudden', 'disappearance', 'child', 'something', 'quite', 'unsettling', 'seeing', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'play', 'character', 'who', 'gone', 'edge', 'was', 'bit', 'uneasy', 'watching', 'character', 'wilt', 'investigating', 'committee', 'end', 'Contract', 'when', 'coming', 'apart', 'here', 'disquieting', 'Foster', 'strength', 'playing', 'characters', 'who', 'push', 'back', 'when', 'get', 'pushed', 'hang', 'there', 'just', 'while', 'Kyle', 'start', 'pushing', 'meanwhile', 'film', 'effective', 'job', 'stripping', 'inherent', 'sympathy', 'point', 'crew', 'passengers', 'become', 'convinced', 'Kyle', 'just', 'crazy', 'woman', 'realization', 'how', 'thinking', 'will', 'keep', 'finding', 'daughter', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'there', 'Kyle', 'back', 'edge', 'Carson', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'sky', 'marshal', 'Captain', 'Rich', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'pilot', 'flight', 'attendants', 'Stephanie', 'Kate', 'Beahan', 'Fiona', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Claudia', 'Jane', 'Kolesarova', 'Flightplan', 'pretty', 'well', 'first', 'time', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'figure', 'out', 'However', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'tenuous', 'house', 'cards', 'been', 'created', 'director', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'film', 'Letting', 'audience', 'be', 'ahead', 'game', 'start', 'film', 'actually', 'key', 'way', 'movie', 'audiences', 'figuring', 'out', 'explanation', 'sense', 'pieces', 'fit', 'retrospect', 'ludicrous', 'path', 'story', 'take', 'Fortunately', 'Foster', 'performance', 'keep', 'one', 'longer', 'air', 'most', 'actresses', 'could', 'have', 'managed', 'rest', 'cast', 'certainly', 'Foster', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'one']",N/A
953748,A2ED6TMGB6O8DT,B000BYY11O,Lawrence Kinsley,"[3, 7]","""Flightplan"" is one of those you-must-suspend-all-the-critical-belief-you've-ever-used-to-function-as-a-sapient-human-being, contemporary Hollywood thrillers. It is easy, of course, to be smug and caustic about such presentations, which as I've argued elsewhere are part of the burgeoning Dumbing-Down-of-America movement which is especially prevalent nowadays in the motion picture field. This particular example also further advances its mediocrity by stealing from (of course the writers like to claim it is ""in homage to"") several other movies of the genre from time past, such as ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""Bunny Lake is Missing"", both of which managed to entertain without resorting to a nearly complete logical breakdown of plot.Acting-wise, we get in ""Flightplan"" what has become today pretty much a standard Jodie Foster vehicle. She turns in a competent performance certainly, though at times she can become a tad whinny. If her acting is also forced to veer crazily between near psychic incapability brought on by a sudden severe tragedy, and a brilliantly competent display of expertise in both the fields of criminology and aviation technology, it is of course the fault of the incredible script that she must twist herself into such a schizophrenic display. The usually underrated Sean Bean -who would have made a much more suitable Aragorn than Viggo Mortensen in ""Lord of the Rings"", had that movie's director been more faithful to the original source - gives a stolid performance which is forced to turn into almost complete concrete by the end when he becomes the simple-minded pawn of the chief villain. As for Peter Sarsgaard, one can only wonder at the praise that has been thrown at his near-drugged, snake-eyed performance by many reviewers here or elsewhere. One simple question should suffice for these people: Is this really how you would want a real-life air marshal to look and act if your safety was ever in his hands 40,000 feet above terra firma? All-in-all, such a gun toting protector who has apparently sniffed just a bit too much airplane glue should hardly give one the strongest post 9/11 confidence in our country's aviational war on terror.Again, one can complain ad nauseam about the plot holes in a movie that, alas, also includes long introspective scenes allowing one to not only see the holes easily, but to literally fall in and swim around in their glaring irrationality. But what disturbs most is not simply that the writers - and by extension, the director, the producer (Mr. Glazer, whose appearance fits all to easily into the adolescent-brained image the movie conveys), and also sadly the audience who are thought to be so capable of so suspending their intellectual capacities that one wonders if these capacities aren't lost to them beyond recovering once outside the confines of the multiplex's front door, could with just a little semblance of labor either asphalted over or even completely avoided at least some of the script's pitfalls in the first place. Foster's character is called a propulsion engineer, for example, when absolutely nothing in the movie involves the slightest knowledge of the workings of the airliner's engines. Since a knowledge so thorough it even survived her highly distressed psychic situation of avionics and cabin design was what was needed for her character, how difficult would it have been to simply label her as one of the plane's aeronautical designers, a catchall phrase that might have kept the more conscious members of the audience from bursting out into incredulous guffaws a good half a dozen times during the movie? And why was she allowed to load onto the airplane first and alone with her daughter, thus straining believability to the extreme that no member of the crew ever saw her come in the door or move down the aisle or take her seat - couldn't she simply have been shown boarding in a crush of other passengers who are all too preoccupied with getting settled in to be individually noticeable? Since none of the eventually revealed villains had the ability to tamper with the plane's passenger list, thus removing her daughter's reservation as the script said they had done, couldn't her necessary presence on the list have been explained away as due to her having simply bought a ticket for her daughter in her neurotic fantasy that she was still alive? And couldn't it have been shown at some time that her going to sleep - so necessary to the plot's success - was induced by a drug put into a drink by someone? Couldn't, in other words, the writers have spent at least a brief amount of their well-paid time coming up with at least a few plausible steps in the plot that would have rendered it somewhat less incredible and dependent on a train of events so lengthy and beyond the perpetrators' control that they had about as much chance of pulling their caper off as a monkey has of writing Shakespeare? There was a time, perhaps not even as far back as ""Bunny Lake"", when that was what writers believed they were supposed to do, fully in keeping with the integrity of their profession. Sadly, not only is a script like ""Flightplan"" an indication of the current worth in which they hold their profession, but even more an example of the contempt in which they - and the others involved in such an insult to rational entertainment - hold us, the paying audience. And just maybe, tragic to say, from all the positive reviews and the large attendance this movie has gotten, they are right.",2,"Where is the plan in ""Flightplan?""",1140566400,"02 22,

This movie have been compared with Panic Room or The Forgotten but its really don't compared.

I think this is where many reviewers, both laymen and professionals get confused. These red herrings confused and mislead the audience - which I believed is the purpose of such thing. But when the movie comes together at the end, when all the answers are given and understood, the movie make whole lot of sense and plot become more entertaining. After all, many movies out there with even more farfetched plots have won praises.Jodie Foster hold this movie together very nicely. She is in almost every scene, her actions and reactions proves to be powerful as well as believable. She's believable because she's scare for her daughter but yet keep her smarts. This make her transformation from scare mother to fighting mother more acceptable.Of course, the movie do have certains holes and some are bigger then others.

It was with great apprehension that, for want of nothing else to watch, I took a look. You know, it wasn't bad at all! It is your typical psychological thriller (without the violence--okay there was a little at the end)--there are dozens of them out there, but so what, periodically I enjoy sitting on the edge of my seat and being entertained. And what do the critics know--I usually abhor the films that they laude.Jodie Foster couldn't be a bad actress if she tried. She did an excellent job of portraying a fragile, grieving widow and also the tough and stubborn mother on a mission of searching for her daughter. When I saw that Sean Bean was in this movie, I knew he was the bad guy.......isn't he always? Perhaps he was cast for this reason but he was excellent (and nice looking too) as the compassionate captain. Peter Sarsgaard was okay as the flight marshal yet when he tried to look sympathetic, I thought he really looked stoned! I was also surprised that some big names had small parts in this film: Erica Christensen as the flight attendant and Greta Scacchi as the therapist. The entire supporting cast was outstanding.This movie was not long--a little over one and half hours and I thought it moved fairly quickly, even while watching someone make umpteen laps up and down an airplane that was longer than a football field.

This is to prevent corpse tampering and/or looting.  As a mortuary marshall, I personally perform retinal scans and cavity searches on bereaved family members before and after they access the RDI.  The cavity search may seem an extreme protocol but nevertheless it is standard operating procedure at all mortuarys.  You'd be surprised at how many BFMs are caught leaving the scene of a wake with something shoved up their rectums.  Also, some BFMs try to smuggle something into the coffin that they have concealed in their backsides.  Modern morgue security can prevent all this.2) Yes, ""propulsion engineers"" who design jet engines do have an in-depth knowledge of the cabin and cargo layouts and electrical wiring of jumbo jets.  They are trained to know how to climb out of an airplane toilet into the bowels of the aircraft.  Once in the plane's innards, they crawl around until re-exiting into the toilet and then returning to their seat as though nothing unusual were happening.  This is part of their training.  My brother in law Vince is an aerospace engineer and he just got back from a week-long training retreat in which he was smeared in camo paint, combat crawling through an airplane toilet most of the time.

953758,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B000BYY11O,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[7, 9]","In ""Flightplan,"" Jodie Foster stars as Kyle Pratt, a woman mourning the unexpected death of her husband. While transporting his casket from Berlin to New York, Kyle faces every mother's worst nightmare when her young daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston) vanishes mid-flight. Already emotionally devastated, Kyle desperately struggles to prove her sanity to the disbelieving flight crew and passengers, while facing the possibility that she may be losing her mind.Though neither the Captain (Sean Bean), nor Air Marshal (Peter Sarsgaard) want to doubt the bereaved widow, she is desperate and alone. Kyle can only rely on her wits to solve the mystery and save her daughter - if she does in fact exist.Aside from a small cameo in the French film, ""A Very Long Engagement,"" this is Jodie Foster's first film since 2002's ""Panic Room."" In fact, ""Flightplan"" plays out like ""Panic Room"" on an airplane. Both films take place in a confined and claustrophobic setting with Jodie Foster as a widow trying to protect her daughter from some villain who is after them.While it is decent entertainment, ""Flightplan"" fails at what it is ultimately trying to be - a claustrophobic Hitchcockian thriller. In fact, it borrows from one of the Hitchcock's very best, 1938's brilliant comic mystery ""The Lady Vanishes."" In this case, it is not an old lady who disappears, but a young girl. It does not take place on a train, but on a state-of-the-art two-story airplane.That is where the film ""Bunny Lake is Missing"" comes in. The 1965 thriller, directed by Otto Preminger, concerns a woman who drops her daughter off at a new boarding school, and when she goes to pick her up, no one can remember seeing the young girl. Laurence Olivier is an inspector who tries to discover the truth, and, gasp, realizes the little girl might not exist. Sound familiar?""Flightplan"" borrows heavily from these two classic films, as well as many recent thrillers using the same plot devices, and plot twists, but upping the action and violence, while putting in a morality lesson that not all Arabs are terrorists.Although ""Flightplan"" does not have an original idea in its contrived script, it is suspenseful enough, and entertaining throughout, but it just doesn't seem enough. The plot twists don't make much sense, and the film is full of holes, which unfortunately, need to be disregarded for full enjoyment of the film.By Hollywood standards, we get the predictable outcome we have come to expect, but the more cardinal offense here is that this is a story where you can not imagine a satisfying outcome anyway.If the daughter was never there, we have been watching a madwoman run over everyone for nearly two hours, and becomes a `Sixth Sense"" type ending all over again. And if she was there, it would seem odd that with all the passengers and crew, no one saw her.""Flightplan"" does not try to be ""Citizen Kane,"" or make much sense. It just wants to entertain and it does.Hollywood stopped having original ideas years ago and have been bombarding us with rip-offs and remakes for years. In fact, Reese Witherspoon is rumored to star in a remake of ""Bunny Lake Is Missing"" next year. It is no wonder the box-office is at its worse slump in years.""Flightplan"" is decent enough entertainment, but it'll be forgotten by morning. If ""Red Eye"" is still playing, at least you can plan to waste your time a little more efficiently. Or better yet, go out and rent ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""Bunny Lake is Missing"" and journey back to the days when movies were more than just entertaining, they were actually great.",3,Dumb but entertaining rehash,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,3573,"['Flightplan', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'woman', 'mourning', 'unexpected', 'death', 'husband', 'transporting', 'casket', 'Berlin', 'New', 'York', 'Kyle', 'mother', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'when', 'young', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'mid-flight', 'Already', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'Kyle', 'desperately', 'prove', 'sanity', 'disbelieving', 'flight', 'crew', 'passengers', 'facing', 'possibility', 'may', 'be', 'losing', 'mind.Though', 'Captain', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Air', 'Marshal', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'want', 'doubt', 'bereaved', 'widow', 'desperate', 'alone', 'Kyle', 'can', 'only', 'rely', 'wits', 'solve', 'mystery', 'save', 'daughter', 'fact', 'small', 'cameo', 'French', 'film', 'Very', 'Long', 'Engagement', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'first', 'film', '2002', 'Panic', 'Room', 'fact', 'Flightplan', 'out', 'Panic', 'Room', 'airplane', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'confined', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'widow', 'trying', 'protect', 'daughter', 'villain', 'who', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'Flightplan', 'fails', 'what', 'ultimately', 'trying', 'be', 'claustrophobic', 'Hitchcockian', 'thriller', 'fact', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'very', 'best', '1938', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'mystery', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'case', 'not', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'young', 'girl', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'train', 'state-of-the-art', 'two-story', 'airplane.That', 'where', 'film', 'Bunny', 'Lake', 'Missing', '1965', 'thriller', 'directed', 'Otto', 'Preminger', 'woman', 'who', 'daughter', 'off', 'new', 'boarding', 'school', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'young', 'girl', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'inspector', 'who', 'discover', 'truth', 'gasp', 'little', 'girl', 'might', 'not', 'exist', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Flightplan', 'heavily', 'two', 'classic', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'recent', 'thrillers', 'using', 'same', 'plot', 'devices', 'plot', 'twists', 'upping', 'action', 'violence', 'putting', 'morality', 'lesson', 'not', 'Arabs', 'are', 'Flightplan', 'not', 'have', 'original', 'idea', 'contrived', 'script', 'suspenseful', 'enough', 'entertaining', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'film', 'full', 'holes', 'unfortunately', 'need', 'be', 'disregarded', 'full', 'enjoyment', 'film.By', 'Hollywood', 'standards', 'get', 'predictable', 'outcome', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'more', 'cardinal', 'offense', 'here', 'story', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'satisfying', 'outcome', 'daughter', 'was', 'never', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'madwoman', 'run', 'everyone', 'nearly', 'two', 'hours', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'type', 'ending', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'there', 'would', 'seem', 'passengers', 'crew', 'one', 'saw', 'Flightplan', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'just', 'entertain', 'does.Hollywood', 'stopped', 'having', 'original', 'ideas', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'been', 'bombarding', 'rip-offs', 'remakes', 'years', 'fact', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'rumored', 'star', 'remake', 'Bunny', 'Lake', 'Missing', 'next', 'year', 'wonder', 'box-office', 'worse', 'slump', 'years', 'Flightplan', 'decent', 'enough', 'entertainment', ""'ll"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'morning', 'Red', 'Eye', 'still', 'playing', 'least', 'can', 'plan', 'waste', 'time', 'little', 'more', 'efficiently', 'better', 'yet', 'go', 'out', 'rent', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'Bunny', 'Lake', 'Missing', 'journey', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'more', 'just', 'entertaining', 'were', 'actually', 'great']",N/A

However, not long after reviewing the film,two Federal Air Marshals were accused of using their identification badges to smuggle drugs and cash through airport security. One of the accused allegedly threatened another that he would ""put him to sleep"" if he ratted out any other Marshals who may have been involved. So, maybe that aspect of the script is not insane. Still, it is anti-security propoganda that no one needs right now.The daughter does not have much to say, but in the run-up to the flight, she has such a hardened, neutral (not depressed or sad) affect, that I suspect she was misdirected, or clumsily directed, or confused by the instructions of a director who needed a translator. (This is the director's first English-language film.) The net effect of the daughter's performance was, for me, that I did not care about her.The script could have used a doctor, and the plot could have been simplified.

I thought being almost entirely set on a plane, it might be claustrophobic and it was very!I'm surprised at Jodie Foster taking on this kind of role, but I have to admit she did well in the role, although she didn't have to stretch herself too far for the role. It was very basic.The thing about Flightplan is that although the cast are good (Sean Bean, Peter Saarsgaard, and Erika Christensen), the plot really isn't up to much. A child could have dreamt up this plot, it's very basic, and it could have been set on nearly any form of transport, and it still would have been the same. It's just cos it's in the air, that it makes it what it is. But it's very racist at the same time, as Jodie's characters ""thinks"" she saw two foreign men across the road from her the night before getting on the plane, and then she ""thinks"" on the plane they're there, and they kidnapped her daughter. This plotline is started, but never really completed, and it's just another plotline in a dizzying number of them. The actors try to do their best in a film that has so many twists and turns, you never know what's going to happen next. But Flightplan goes one twist too many, and by the end of the film, you don't really care what happens, you just want it over. And there are quite a few plotholes as well, but it doesn't really matter.Jodie should never have agreed to do this script. And neither should Sean Bean. The other two could have taken it or left it.

953763,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000BYY11O,Melissa Niksic,"[2, 5]","Hollywood rule of thumb: Jodie Foster doesn't make bad movies. If you liked ""Panic Room,"" you will absolutely LOVE ""Flightplan!""This movie takes a different approach to all the ""nightmare in the air"" movies that have preceded it. About 90% of this film takes place aboard a double-decker aircraft that engineer Kyle Pratt (Foster) helped design. Kyle is distraught over the recent death of her husband, who died under very suspicious circumstances. Accompanied by her six-year-old daughter, Julia, Kyle is flying with her husband's casket in tow, which is to be buried in the United States.Soon after the plane takes off, Kyle and Julia doze off in their seats. When Kyle wakes up, she discovers that her daughter has disappeared. None of the passengers or flight crew members remember seeing her, and despite everyone's efforts to locate Julia, the little girl cannot be found.Understandably, Kyle becomes frantic when her daughter cannot be located. Things take a turn for the worse when a flight attendant reports that there is no evidence of Julia Pratt ever being on the plane at all, and eventually the crew receives confirmation from a morgue that Kyle's daughter was killed along with her father a week ago.Foster's performance in this film is incredible. She is devastated over her daughter's disappearance and is relentless in her pursuit to search every square inch of the aircraft she knows so well. Peter Sarsgaard is also great in his role as Gene Carson, an air marshal who steps up to restrain Kyle when she begins to disrupt her fellow passengers.I can't say enough good things about this movie. The script is very original and there are many twists and turns that will keep the audience guessing until the very end. Foster and Sarsgaard are accompanied by a great supporting cast, including Sean Bean as the captain of the plane. This is the best thriller that's come out in 2005, hands-down.(An interesting movie tidbit: Kyle was originally intended for a male actor, but the sex of the character was changed when Foster expressed interest in the role.

David Pratt was an apparent suicide, though Kyle doesn't know why her husband would jump from the top of a building.  She and her six-year-old daughter, Julie, decide to fly the body back to the United States for burial.  On medication, truly not grounded while aboard the huge 474 jetliner, Kyle wakes to find Julie missing.  None of the crew or other passengers admit to having seen her.  Almost overwhelmed by the turn of events, Kyle has to face the fact that someone has stolen her daughter on the jetliner, or that her daughter died with her husband and she losing her mind.FLIGHTPLAN stars Jodie Foster (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, PANIC ROOM, ANNA AND THE KING, CONTACT) in one of her most compelling roles.  Peter Sarsgaard (JARHEAD, SKELETON KEY) stars as the air marshal on the jet who alternately helps and hinders Kyle Pratt's efforts to find her child.  Directed by Robert Schewentke, who has done primarily German films but is now moving into the American market, the film has definite Hitchcockian tones.FLIGHTPLAN is what the director frequently calls a ""slow boil"" in the bonus materials on the DVD.  The quiet, heavy weight of the beginning as the viewer tries to sort out everything that is going on, dreading the certain knowledge that someone is dead sucks the audience into the story and Kyle Pratt's plight.  The sets were also intricately plotted out, including the color (which affects both the mood and the tension the story ratchets up), and the 474 comes across as its own world.  The subtle twists and turns of the plot are suggested rather than telegraphed, so the viewer actually has thought about a possibility before the movie deals with it.  This is one of the best suspense movies with twists to come along in a long time.Unfortunately, though the pacing works for the movie, it also sometimes works against it.  Although FLIGHTPLAN works in familiar terrain, the terrain is TOO familiar at times.  Veteran suspense movie watchers will have too much time on their hands to think about what is going on and, perhaps, grow a little impatient.FLIGHTPLAN is a great movie for an easy night of film watching.  There's no blood, no gratuitous violence, no nudity.  It performs exactly as it's supposed to, piques the watcher's interest, levels them off with paranoia, and brings them crashing to the landing field.",4,"A Chiller At 30,000+ feet",1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,2524,"['Kyle', 'Pratt', 'jet', 'propulsion', 'engineer', 'who', 'worked', 'Aalto', '474', 'world', 'largest', 'jet', 'airliner', 'reels', 'emotionally', 'loss', 'husband', 'beginning', 'movie', 'David', 'Pratt', 'was', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'Kyle', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'husband', 'would', 'jump', 'top', 'building', 'six-year-old', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'decide', 'fly', 'body', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'burial', 'medication', 'truly', 'not', 'grounded', 'huge', '474', 'jetliner', 'Kyle', 'find', 'Julie', 'missing', 'None', 'crew', 'other', 'passengers', 'admit', 'having', 'seen', 'Almost', 'overwhelmed', 'turn', 'events', 'Kyle', 'face', 'fact', 'someone', 'stolen', 'daughter', 'jetliner', 'daughter', 'died', 'husband', 'losing', 'mind.FLIGHTPLAN', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'SILENCE', 'THE', 'LAMBS', 'PANIC', 'ROOM', 'ANNA', 'THE', 'KING', 'CONTACT', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'JARHEAD', 'SKELETON', 'KEY', 'air', 'marshal', 'jet', 'who', 'alternately', 'hinders', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'efforts', 'find', 'child', 'Directed', 'Robert', 'Schewentke', 'who', 'done', 'primarily', 'German', 'films', 'now', 'moving', 'American', 'market', 'film', 'definite', 'Hitchcockian', 'tones.FLIGHTPLAN', 'what', 'director', 'frequently', 'slow', 'boil', 'bonus', 'materials', 'DVD', 'quiet', 'heavy', 'weight', 'beginning', 'viewer', 'sort', 'out', 'everything', 'going', 'dreading', 'certain', 'knowledge', 'someone', 'dead', 'sucks', 'audience', 'story', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'plight', 'sets', 'were', 'also', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'out', 'including', 'color', 'mood', 'tension', 'story', 'up', '474', 'across', 'own', 'world', 'subtle', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'are', 'suggested', 'rather', 'telegraphed', 'viewer', 'actually', 'thought', 'possibility', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'suspense', 'movies', 'twists', 'come', 'along', 'long', 'time.Unfortunately', 'pacing', 'movie', 'also', 'sometimes', 'FLIGHTPLAN', 'familiar', 'terrain', 'terrain', 'TOO', 'familiar', 'times', 'Veteran', 'suspense', 'movie', 'watchers', 'will', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'think', 'what', 'going', 'perhaps', 'grow', 'little', 'impatient.FLIGHTPLAN', 'great', 'movie', 'easy', 'night', 'film', 'watching', 'blood', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'nudity', 'exactly', 'supposed', 'piques', 'watcher', 'interest', 'levels', 'off', 'paranoia', 'crashing', 'landing', 'field']",N/A

I thought Panic Room was brilliant, so I was looking forward to essentially the same premise on a plane.In Flightplan, Foster plays Kyle, an airplane engineer who has recently lost her husband.  She's traveling back from Germany to the States with her daughter, Julia (played with impossible cuteness by Marlene Lawston).  Julia is so traumatized by her father's death (he ""tripped off a building,"" ya see), that she is terrified of even going outside, much less on a plane.The panic rises as Kyle awakens to discover her daughter is nowhere to be found.  There's no record of the child and then we realize that nobody was really paying attention to her--or really anyone--on the plane.The subtle message throughout Flightplan is that despite our heightened awareness of terrorist, we rarely pay attention to each other.  It's easy to focus on the dark-skinned man with the beard, but apparently much harder to keep track of a blonde mother and her daughter.  Why?  Because we don't SEE her anymore, even though she's right in front of us.There is undoubtedly some nefarious plans going on, but those plans are bolstered by malaise from the stewardess, the crew, and a streak of self-doubt from Kyle herself.  Is she having a nervous breakdown?Peter Sarsgaard plays Carson, the sky marshal.  Sarsgaard channels John Malkovich with startlingly intensity (in fact, the two played father/son in ""The Man in the Iron Mask"").  Kate Beahan is a particularly annoying stewardess who, judging from her dark eye makeup, is clearly up to no good.  In the background, Sean Bean lends gravitas to the Captain.  You'd think airplane captains were born of royalty the way he portrays Captain Rich.The plane is as much an actor as any human, rumbling and shaking at the appropriate moments.  It's two levels (I didn't even know there was such a thing), and awfully roomy.  That only makes sense, but it detracts from some of the claustrophobia if you've never been on a plane of that size before.  On the other hand, I watched this movie while I was on a cruise ship, so I could understand the terror of losing someone in a confined space.Throughout the film are other asides: comments on the fickle nature of passengers, on psychiatry, about white raged, and of course, about airlines.

953774,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BYY11O,mirasreviews,"[4, 4]","""Flightplan"" is a thriller that makes use of its spatial limitations to create the questions that drive the story and its action-packed climax. The action takes place within the confines of an airplane: a huge double-decker futuristic E-474 en route from Berlin to New York. Kyle Pratt (Jodie Foster) is an American propulsion engineer living in Berlin with her 6-year-old daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston). After the death of her husband, Kyle plans to return to the U.S. with Julia and her husband's casket. Three hours into the flight from Berlin, Kyle awakes to find Julia missing. The passenger manifest shows no record of Julia ever having been on board. After a search of the plane turns turns up nothing, Kyle is frantic and suspects fowl play. The Captain (Sean Bean) doesn't know what to think. The Air Marshall (Peter Sarsgaard) is angry and exasperated by Kyle's accusations but also sympathetic to her increasingly panicked mental state.""Flightplan""'s great strength is its set and director Robert Schwentke's insistence on confining his camera to the confines of the plane. No walls were moved to make room for the cameras, and nothing is shot from outside the set looking in. So the camera's perspective, and ours, is always from within that plane. I'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie shot this way in a plane, but several movies have been shot within the confines of a train to great effect. The claustrophobia really heightens the tension. In this case, it also proposes ""Flightplan""'s driving questions: Does the child exist? How could she disappear from a confined space? Is Kyle sane or hallucinating under the stress of her husband's death?Robert Schwentke has made some lower budget films in Germany and obviously admires European cinema. Although ""Flightplan"" is in many ways a classic Hollywood thriller, it moves from a somewhat European sensibility to an American one as the plane moves from Berlin to North America. The first part of the film is introverted: a woman who is grappling with her perception of the world around her finds herself in an environment that is essentially indifferent to her, under circumstances that she cannot control. The second part of the film is extroverted: she applies herself to the problem and tries to get some control of it, in very American fashion. This shift that occurs in Kyle's psyche adds a lot to her character, which would have been unbelievable had she started out confident in herself or dull had she resigned herself to the circumstances. ""Flightplan"" is an entertaining and thoughtful thriller. It might seem like the trailer for this film gave a lot away, but there are many more twists and turns, so don't think it's been spoiled for you.The DVD (Touchstone 2006): There are 2 featurettes and an audio commentary. ""The In-Flight Movie: The Making of Flight Plan"" is a documentary in 5 parts, which follows the film's creation from writing the script to casting to adding visual effects. Includes interviews with director Robert Schwentke, writers Billy Ray and Peter  A. Dowling, cast and producers. ""Cabin Pressure: Designing the Alto E-474"" (10 min) is about designing, building, and filming in the plane set. It features interviews with the director, production designer Alec Hammond, and director of photography Florian Ballhaus. There is a good audio commentary by director Robert Schwentke that combines discussion of the film's editing, characters, story, and filming within a confined space, with comments on guiding themes, thrillers, and genre films in general.

Although not one of his most well-known films, it is a minor classic that remains entertaining today.  This great movie is an obvious inspiration for the 2005 thriller Flightplan, but despite the slicker look of the movie, it is at best a pale imitation of its predecessor.In Flightplan, Jodie Foster plays Kyle Pratt, an American engineer living in Berlin.  After the apparent suicide of her husband, she and her daughter Julia fly back to the U.S. with the body.  During the flight, Kyle falls asleep, and when she wakes up, her daughter is missing.  No one recalls seeing Julia and there isn't even a record of her boarding; in fact, the only recent record of Julia states that she also died in Berlin.  Naturally, everyone thinks Kyle is crazy, but it wouldn't be much of a story if that were the case; obviously something sinister is afoot.I won't spoil things by saying what the sinister plot is, but suffice it to say that it is utterly ludicrous, one of those schemes that requires everyone behave precisely as the villains planned.  In particular, the scheme only works if no one on the plane can recall seeing the girl, a contingency that is quite the gamble.  (In The Lady Vanishes, this works a lot better.)  Several other things need to work exactly as schemed or the whole thing falls apart.On the other hand, the movie is ably acted, with a good cast led by Foster.  The effects are decent and the writing is at least good enough to provide some suspense; it is really only as the movie is concluding that you realize exactly how dumb the plot is.  The plus points are enough to give the movie a high two stars, but if you are in the mood for a modern danger-on-a-plane movie, you'd probably be better off watching the enjoyable Red Eye; better yet, take a train instead and go with The Lady Vanishes itself.",2,The Child Vanishes,1149811200,"06 9, 2006",2006,1915,"['Back', '1938', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'made', 'nice', 'little', 'comic', 'thriller', 'called', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'well-known', 'films', 'minor', 'classic', 'entertaining', 'today', 'great', 'movie', 'obvious', 'inspiration', '2005', 'thriller', 'Flightplan', 'slicker', 'look', 'movie', 'best', 'pale', 'imitation', 'predecessor.In', 'Flightplan', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'American', 'engineer', 'living', 'Berlin', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'husband', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'back', 'U.S.', 'body', 'flight', 'Kyle', 'asleep', 'when', 'up', 'daughter', 'missing', 'one', 'seeing', 'Julia', ""n't"", 'even', 'record', 'boarding', 'fact', 'only', 'recent', 'record', 'Julia', 'states', 'also', 'died', 'Berlin', 'Naturally', 'everyone', 'thinks', 'Kyle', 'crazy', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'story', 'were', 'case', 'obviously', 'something', 'sinister', 'afoot.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'things', 'saying', 'what', 'sinister', 'plot', 'say', 'utterly', 'ludicrous', 'one', 'schemes', 'everyone', 'behave', 'precisely', 'villains', 'planned', 'particular', 'scheme', 'only', 'one', 'plane', 'can', 'recall', 'seeing', 'girl', 'contingency', 'quite', 'gamble', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'lot', 'better', 'Several', 'other', 'things', 'need', 'work', 'exactly', 'schemed', 'whole', 'thing', 'apart.On', 'other', 'hand', 'movie', 'ably', 'acted', 'good', 'cast', 'led', 'Foster', 'effects', 'are', 'decent', 'writing', 'least', 'good', 'enough', 'provide', 'suspense', 'really', 'only', 'movie', 'concluding', 'realize', 'exactly', 'how', 'dumb', 'plot', 'plus', 'points', 'are', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'mood', 'modern', 'danger-on-a-plane', 'movie', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'enjoyable', 'Red', 'Eye', 'better', 'yet', 'take', 'train', 'instead', 'go', 'Lady', 'Vanishes']",N/A

Sean Bean did his usual solid job of acting and Peter Saarsgard was good enough as the strange but ever so helpful air marshall.The suspense and build up were very well done and it was setting up to be a great flick and then it kind of disappointed a bit as the film reached its climax.  The problem was that you really had to have a leap of faith to actually believe that everything happened as it did. There were so many varibles that the bad guys ""plans"" were relying on and they were really rolling the dice banking on things falling into place. Also, Fosters ability to navigate the planes innards and for her to understand the wiring and other technical aspects were a little contrived as well.

Well that is heavy and makes for an ideal suspense-thriller.As the movie gets up to cruising speed, we are made to wonder if the lady somehow was living in some sort of imagined state - after all she was still suffering the loss of her husband.Unfortunately what takes off in the Twilight Zone, lands (I know it's cheesy) in all-too-familiar territory as it turns out that this is just some very cleverly disguised extortion attempt!There were some issues that were not resolved, however which makes the movie not have a satisfying ending.So why was the husband murdered in the first place and what relationship did the widow have with the murderer prior to the murder?  She seemed to know him at the time when they were having their showdown.  This inplied to me that there was some kind of relationship between then and the murdered hubby?Also, the role of the of the guy at the morgue suggests that he was in on this as he was saying that the child died.One reviewer took up an issue with why the perpetrator would bother kidnap a child of someone who would know the ins and outs of the very plane they were flying in.  However, I think they did this because, the very one who knew the airplane was also distraught and would probally be too off-kilter to do much in the line of insuring the plane be completely searched, furthermore, because of her being already messed up from her husband's death, they would be able to say she was probally suffering from that trauma and not be so apt to believe her.  That made sense althought they underestimated her abilities as the main perpetrator and his crooked flight attendant accomplice were concluding that she was figuring it out.Now for some unbelivables:My main issue is - as another reviewer pointed out - in this post-911 day.  The woman's carrying on while aboard the plane should have earned her being restrained and sedated if not shot down especially after causing some potentially life-threatening kaos.The glaring issue I noticed is that access to the attic of the plane - was throught a trap door... in a bathroom!  Now why would access to a restricted area be available in an unrestricted area such as a bathroom, and not an employee-only one mind you.  Sorry but that was a give-away.  The writers had to find a way to make it where the woman could finagel her way into having the handcuffs removed and her being left unattended.  Perfect, a bathroom.  Unfortunately, it was all to obvious.I can understand casting a middle-easterner into the film and using him to make us think he had a hand in the disappering child but perhaps some might take this as a stereotype and some middle-easterners may take this as a form of racism while some Americans may take this as an exploit of the 9-11 mess.  As for the passenger who was having an issue with the middle-easterner enough to attack him, this incident seemed unconnected to the film and, again, his behavior in this post-9-11 day would have earned him getting arrested and some prison-time.  I don't think this was very beliveable unless this movie was about him.Finally, at the very end, the woman was being asked to come and identify the picture of the Morgue employee who said her daughter had died,  the movie ended before she did that, so it is not established if this one had a role in the extortion attempt or the husband's murder and why he was murdered.  His murder is not explained in anyway and how it plays into the extortion plot other than that explosives were brought onto the plane via his casket.  Surely, they did not murder someone in general just to get his explosives on a plane.  It seems that there would have been a more calculated reason for the murder.  This element lends itself to the Twilight Zone elements of this film but it really should have kept to that and stayed away from some disguised extortion.",4,The Panic Plane?,1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,4166,"['are', 'lot', 'comparisons', 'Panic', 'Room', 'only', 'saw', 'parts', 'video', 'store', 'pun', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'cute', 'pass', 'up', 'enjoyed', 'Twilight', 'Zone-esque', 'movie', 'idea', 'child', 'coming', 'up', 'missing', 'then', 'noone', 'noticing', 'even', 'insisting', 'record', 'child', 'first', 'place', 'Well', 'heavy', 'ideal', 'suspense-thriller.As', 'movie', 'up', 'cruising', 'speed', 'are', 'made', 'wonder', 'lady', 'somehow', 'was', 'living', 'sort', 'imagined', 'state', 'was', 'still', 'suffering', 'loss', 'husband.Unfortunately', 'what', 'off', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'know', 'cheesy', 'all-too-familiar', 'territory', 'out', 'just', 'very', 'cleverly', 'disguised', 'extortion', 'attempt', 'were', 'issues', 'were', 'not', 'resolved', 'however', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'satisfying', 'ending.So', 'why', 'was', 'husband', 'murdered', 'first', 'place', 'what', 'relationship', 'did', 'widow', 'have', 'murderer', 'prior', 'murder', 'seemed', 'know', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'having', 'showdown', 'inplied', 'was', 'kind', 'relationship', 'then', 'murdered', 'hubby', 'Also', 'role', 'guy', 'morgue', 'was', 'was', 'saying', 'child', 'died.One', 'reviewer', 'took', 'up', 'issue', 'why', 'perpetrator', 'would', 'bother', 'kidnap', 'child', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'know', 'ins', 'outs', 'very', 'plane', 'were', 'flying', 'However', 'think', 'did', 'because', 'very', 'one', 'who', 'knew', 'airplane', 'was', 'also', 'distraught', 'would', 'probally', 'be', 'too', 'off-kilter', 'do', 'much', 'line', 'insuring', 'plane', 'be', 'completely', 'searched', 'furthermore', 'being', 'already', 'messed', 'up', 'husband', 'death', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'was', 'probally', 'suffering', 'trauma', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'apt', 'believe', 'made', 'sense', 'althought', 'underestimated', 'abilities', 'main', 'perpetrator', 'crooked', 'flight', 'attendant', 'accomplice', 'were', 'concluding', 'was', 'figuring', 'out.Now', 'unbelivables', 'main', 'issue', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'post-911', 'day', 'woman', 'carrying', 'plane', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'being', 'restrained', 'sedated', 'not', 'shot', 'down', 'especially', 'causing', 'potentially', 'life-threatening', 'kaos.The', 'glaring', 'issue', 'noticed', 'access', 'attic', 'plane', 'was', 'throught', 'trap', 'door', 'bathroom', 'Now', 'why', 'would', 'access', 'restricted', 'area', 'be', 'available', 'unrestricted', 'area', 'such', 'bathroom', 'not', 'employee-only', 'one', 'mind', 'Sorry', 'was', 'give-away', 'writers', 'had', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'where', 'woman', 'could', 'finagel', 'way', 'having', 'handcuffs', 'removed', 'being', 'left', 'unattended', 'Perfect', 'bathroom', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'obvious.I', 'can', 'understand', 'casting', 'middle-easterner', 'film', 'using', 'make', 'think', 'had', 'hand', 'disappering', 'child', 'perhaps', 'might', 'take', 'stereotype', 'middle-easterners', 'may', 'take', 'form', 'racism', 'Americans', 'may', 'take', 'exploit', '9-11', 'mess', 'passenger', 'who', 'was', 'having', 'issue', 'middle-easterner', 'enough', 'attack', 'incident', 'seemed', 'unconnected', 'film', 'again', 'behavior', 'post-9-11', 'day', 'would', 'have', 'earned', 'getting', 'arrested', 'prison-time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'very', 'beliveable', 'movie', 'was', 'him.Finally', 'very', 'end', 'woman', 'was', 'being', 'asked', 'come', 'identify', 'picture', 'Morgue', 'employee', 'who', 'said', 'daughter', 'had', 'died', 'movie', 'ended', 'did', 'not', 'established', 'one', 'had', 'role', 'extortion', 'attempt', 'husband', 'murder', 'why', 'was', 'murdered', 'murder', 'not', 'explained', 'anyway', 'how', 'extortion', 'plot', 'other', 'explosives', 'were', 'brought', 'plane', 'casket', 'Surely', 'did', 'not', 'murder', 'someone', 'general', 'just', 'get', 'explosives', 'plane', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'calculated', 'reason', 'murder', 'element', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'elements', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'stayed', 'away', 'disguised', 'extortion']",N/A

I was happily proven wrong.  Jodi Foster leads the cast as a mother grieving the sudden and unforseen loss of her beloved husband who becomes frantic when her only child dissappears on an airplane...while it's flying across the Atlantic.  My first compliment goes to the writers and set designers who nicely debunk the theory that there are only so many places on an airplane that a child can get to...there are apparently plenty that I didn't think of (yes, I know the type of plane used is fictional, but there are airplanes that are really that big.)  The casting director also made a good call when he cast Sean Bean as the plane's captain, a man torn between believing Foster's character and maintaining the safety and welfare of everyone else on the plane...a role that shows us that the interests of the majority aren't always the right or easiest choices.  Peter Sarsgaard has come a long way since his small debut role in ""Dead Man Walking"".  Now, he's an accomplished Air Marshal who tries his best to help Foster's character but is conflicted about how far to let her go on.  The Middle Eastern passengers serving as a red herring were a nice touch...it was also nice to see such individuals portrayed as ultimately being good, honest people instead of evil terrorists.  As for Marlene Lawston, I wonder how much training she has had as an actress.  For being so young when this film was made, she definetly was able to have great chemistry with Jodi Foster, her ""mother"" in the film.  I know the film was about the mystery of her dissappearance, but I wish they could have used her more.  Ultimately, this is a decent film to watch.

Foster gets panicky as she searches the plane and tries to persuade the crew to help.  As the suspense keeps mounting, the story almost takes on a twilight-zone eeriness as the flight attendants deny the girl ever boarded the plane.  Though they all act as if they believe Foster is deluded, the pilot allows a thorough search of the plane to humor her.  Peter Saarsgard (Shattered Glass, Skeleton Key) plays an ineffectual air marshall who finally goes through motions of helping her, for a time.Foster plays it just right and her performance together with good writing, directing, and editing, almost make us doubt her sanity, even though we saw the girl board with her.I've heard of other reviews that claim the ending is disappointing because it's far-fetched.  I saw the movie before hearing that, and I was quite satisfied with the end, even though a few scenes did seem far-fetched.

When the little girl goes missing with no evidence of her ever being on the plane, Foster goes all out to find her and ends up confronting a terrorist plot.Foster's performance alone is worth seeing this film.  She doesn't disappoint and what makes her great is you're not thinking Jodie Foster is performing this role.  She brings to ""Flightplan"" the intensity of Clarice Starling and the heart of a woman with everything she loves at stake.What interested and diverted me was the reaction of the crew and passengers.  One remark when the first announcement that a little girl was missing was telling, a young man said:  ""What's all the fuss, it's not like she lost a Palm Pilot or something.""Only the 'problem children' from a family sitting a couple of rows away believed the little girl was missing and wanted to help.Sad to see how quickly we come to conclusions about situations and how little some people care.

Exciting, generally well-acted, well edited and lit, it just felt like a top-notch thriller.  But within three minutes of walking out and actually thinking about what had happened, it all began to fall apart.I don't want to let out any spoilers, but let's just say that when we find out what's REALLY going on...the ""plot"" doesn't really make sense.  The people who are trying to do what they're doing in the story could have achieved their goal with FAR, FAR, FAR less effort!!!  What the actually try to pull off is ridiculous in the extreme.  Yes, watching the movie, I suspended by disbelief enough to enjoy it...but when the silliness of it came crashing in, the disappointment was acute.  Kinda like coming down from a sugar high.The plot, at least its beginning, deals with Jodie Foster and her young daughter getting on a plane in Berlin to take the body of her recently dead husband back to the US for burial.  Naturally, both mother and daughter are feeling stressed and burned-out and traumatized.  So when Foster wakes up after a brief nap to find her daughter missing, her reaction goes beyond frazzled.  Her escalating despair in the face of apathetic crew and passengers is gripping and pulls us right in to her dilemma.  We really see and feel things through her eyes...which makes it easier for us to overlook the plot holes, in my opinion.  If the filmmakers kept us more at arms length from the film...not only would we find the plot totally unconvincing, but we wouldn't even care enough to overlook that fault.As it is, Jodie Foster is very good.  She does so few films, it's always good to enjoy her particular brand of intensity.  But after her last film, the superior PANIC ROOM, one has to wonder why she wanted to take on a very similar sort of role...single mother in distress and trying to save her daughter.  Although she's very good, it does feel like she's slumming a bit.The rest of the cast is good as well.  Sean Bean makes a perfect pilot...officious, supercilious, handsome, straight-backed and the accent doesn't hurt either.  Peter Sarsgard, so good in work like KINSEY and SHATTERED GLASS, has an interesting role as an Air Marshall.  Greta Scacchi has a smallish role as a passenger and Erika Christensen, who started with such promise a few years ago in TRAFFIC, is relegated to the role of a rookie flight attendant whose character ultimately has nothing to do.The interior of the airplane is great.  You really get a good sense of flying, and the plane itself becomes something of a ""character"" itself.  As I said, the lighting was excellent, as was the sound mix and editing.  But the basic core...the screenplay...is really a lazy piece.  Someone came up with a great premise (""what if the mother wakes up and can't find her daughter...and no one remembers seeing the girl and no one can find her""), but couldn't come up with a satisfying conclusion...but they made the film anyway.So, because it's well made and features on of our great actresses, I can't totally dismiss the film...but I've tried to warn you that this is not a classic film.",3,"Glossy and well-crafted, but totally unbelievable",1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,3175,"['actually', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'sitting', 'theater', 'watching', 'Exciting', 'generally', 'well-acted', 'well', 'edited', 'just', 'felt', 'top-notch', 'thriller', 'three', 'minutes', 'walking', 'out', 'actually', 'thinking', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'began', 'fall', 'apart.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'let', 'out', 'spoilers', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'REALLY', 'going', 'plot', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'goal', 'FAR', 'FAR', 'FAR', 'less', 'effort', 'What', 'actually', 'try', 'pull', 'off', 'ridiculous', 'extreme', 'Yes', 'watching', 'movie', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'when', 'silliness', 'came', 'crashing', 'disappointment', 'was', 'acute', 'Kinda', 'coming', 'down', 'sugar', 'high.The', 'plot', 'least', 'beginning', 'deals', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'young', 'daughter', 'getting', 'plane', 'Berlin', 'take', 'body', 'recently', 'dead', 'husband', 'back', 'US', 'burial', 'Naturally', 'mother', 'daughter', 'are', 'feeling', 'stressed', 'burned-out', 'traumatized', 'So', 'when', 'Foster', 'up', 'brief', 'nap', 'find', 'daughter', 'missing', 'reaction', 'frazzled', 'escalating', 'despair', 'face', 'apathetic', 'crew', 'passengers', 'gripping', 'pulls', 'right', 'dilemma', 'really', 'see', 'feel', 'things', 'eyes', 'easier', 'overlook', 'plot', 'holes', 'opinion', 'filmmakers', 'kept', 'more', 'arms', 'length', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'find', 'plot', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'enough', 'overlook', 'fault.As', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'very', 'good', 'so', 'few', 'films', 'always', 'good', 'enjoy', 'particular', 'brand', 'intensity', 'last', 'film', 'superior', 'PANIC', 'ROOM', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'wanted', 'take', 'very', 'similar', 'sort', 'role', 'single', 'mother', 'distress', 'trying', 'save', 'daughter', 'very', 'good', 'feel', 'slumming', 'bit.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'perfect', 'pilot', 'officious', 'supercilious', 'handsome', 'straight-backed', 'accent', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'Peter', 'Sarsgard', 'so', 'good', 'work', 'KINSEY', 'SHATTERED', 'GLASS', 'interesting', 'role', 'Air', 'Marshall', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'smallish', 'role', 'passenger', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'who', 'started', 'such', 'promise', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'TRAFFIC', 'relegated', 'role', 'rookie', 'flight', 'attendant', 'character', 'ultimately', 'nothing', 'do.The', 'interior', 'airplane', 'great', 'really', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'flying', 'plane', 'something', 'character', 'said', 'lighting', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'sound', 'mix', 'editing', 'basic', 'core', 'screenplay', 'really', 'lazy', 'piece', 'Someone', 'came', 'up', 'great', 'premise', 'what', 'mother', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'daughter', 'one', 'seeing', 'girl', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'could', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'made', 'film', 'anyway.So', 'well', 'made', 'features', 'great', 'actresses', 'ca', ""n't"", 'totally', 'dismiss', 'film', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'warn', 'not', 'classic', 'film']",N/A

Jodie Foster I don't know too well I've seen two other films of hers but this one is definitely the best I've seen from her.The film is full of mystery and you are constantly guessing the main question: Is the mother crazy or is she truly missing a daughter? You are constantly asking this question as Foster continues to run around this incredibly massive airplane, searching every corner she can of the plane, desperate to find her missing daughter she had left sleeping on a seat and then when she herself went to sleep and woke up awhile later she realized her daughter was gone. You meet a few other main characters on the plane and constantly wonder if they are truly doing all they can to look for her daughter. One thing my friend pointed out was right as she watched this film with me- these people on the plane hardly had any sympathy for Foster, did they? How would they feel seriously if it was their own daughter lost, wouldn't they be as desperate as she was? But of course they thought though she was delusional but nonetheless it always made me wonder if one- or some of them had something to do with it.The cast is pretty good in their roles definitely, and the scenes are fast- paced and never leave you bored. The ending itself is one you might have guessed already but it will be hard to guess the complete end. I was even shocked at the ending so be prepared.

When none of the crew members and passengers can recall seeing the little girl, the question becomes (as in ""The Forgotten""), whether the child is really missing or whether she is merely the figment of a mentally ill woman's delusional mind.""Flightplan"" provides heart-pounding suspense and even some genuine poignancy in its early stages, managing to turn the cramped confines of an overcrowded airplane into a stage for high drama.  Jodie Foster plays yet another of her emotionally overwrought characters, but as few do it as well as she does, we feel we are in good hands on this flight.  Peter Sarsgaard and Sean Bean also contribute mightily in their roles as the air marshal and the captain, respectively, whose job it is to try to ferret out the mystery without engendering panic and pandemonium among the understandably perturbed passengers.  And the wonderful Gretta Scacchi illuminates the screen in her few brief moments as a sympathetic therapist called in to subdue the distraught woman.However, like so many mystery stories, ""Flightplan"" is far more intriguing in its setting-up stages than it is in its resolution.

Admirable tension. Insulting revelation.Jodie Foster plays beneath her talents as Kyla Pratt, an airplane engineer flying from Germany to America for the funeral of her husband, whose casket lies in the cargo hold. She has a young daughter, Julia, who disappears early in the flight. Kyla knows the plane, and knows where and how to order a full-fledged search of it. An air marshal (Peter Sarsgaard), two airline attendants (Kate Beehan and Erika Christensen) and the lead pilot (Sean Bean) are the primary search party. Nothing comes up. In fact, Julia isn't in the passenger log. In fact, Julia has been listed by the German coroner as dead.There is an answer to this, and it doesn't involve ghosts or Kyla dreaming it all up. Before this solution is revealed, director Robert Schwentke nicely handles the red herrings, which includes a couple Middle Eastern men who were seen by Kyla the night before. Are they the kidnappers? What is the short sequence with that therapist all about? Which of those two flight attendants seem less trustworthy? Is the air marshal straight up? The captain? Did the husband really commit suicide? Is he even dead? Is Elvis? Paul? Tupac?It mostly works until the point when the movie must show its hand, and while the villains of ""Flightplan"" mildly surprised me, they did not delight me. The questions that film critic Roger Ebert asserts won't hit you until after the movie assaulted me immediately.

While the premise was frightening, the thriller aspect of this film just did not convey.  In fact, it came across flat out hokey in several spots.

But not even Jodie could save the movie from the oh-so-many plot holes.To pull off the underlying diabolical plot of the ""missing child"" and its ultimate purpose, there were too many different events that would have needed to occur without fail that certainly couldn't have been counted on or planned (but of course in the movie world they did happen as if they could be predicted).It's the story of a recently widowed airline exec (Jodie) and her daughter that are traveling back to the US on an overseas fight. Jodie takes a nap (the main element that couldn't have been counted on but was required for the ""hidden"" plot to work) and awakens to find her daughter nowhere to be found. Jodie does a great job getting the viewer to take her seriously about the missing child in a captivated environment, but unfortunately can't get anyone in the movie to take her seriously. As we learn what's really going on the holes in the plot become more visible than I would have expected for a Jodie Foster movie. Then the climax of the film leaves the viewers happy, but saying to themselves...""that could have never happened.""Therefore, after it's all said and done, the film has believability issues, but is worth a rental for sure.

She was part of the overall hit Maverick. Yeah it was amazing (but in reality disturbing) to see her as a kid in The Taxi Driver and Freaky Friday. BUT . . . Flightplan was just Jodi Foster playing another character. Same mannerisms. Same whispering voice. Same sideways look when she is trying to play defenseless and vulnerable. Again she is one dimensional like Julia Roberts. When both of them were young and new we didn't care as it was a treat to see them. But after decades of them in movie after movie we just see Julia Roberts and Jodi Foster playing another role as themselves. Boring. Anyway this movie was a Hollywood liberal attempt at ""teaching"" Americans how to look at Muslims after 9/11, including the finger wagging. This movie was focused heavily on Muslims and Middle Easterns and how Americans ""stereotype"". It mocks our fear of their hatred. It mocks the memory of 9/11. But the overall plot was nothing more than Panic Room. Woman protecting kid (this time a daughter who actually looks, acts, dresses, and talks like a girl, not a boy. . . but traded in for a silicon injected lip, bugged eyed, big faced woman and a sinister villain who squints a drug induced look through the entire movie) against evil men. They never tell you why she was the target here unlike Panic Room. They never made all the connections including her husband's death. They just have a character mention it in passing. They never even explain why the villains are being villainous. They just have characters mention a few words about it is good for them that muslims were on board. They never link the muslims on the plane back to the window scenes even though they showed them to you. Anyway the only interesting part centered around figuring out whether there was a kid or not. But honestly I get tired of Hollywood mind game plots (e.g. A Beautiful Mind, Shutter Island, etc). It was something to fill the void of the movie or better yet the movie that they couldn't begin or end.Anyway, I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and getting up and leaving after they started lecturing us about stereotyping muslims.

Apparently Kyle Pratt's (played by  Jodie Foster) husband falls off a roof and dies. They live and work in Berlin.  Therefore, she immediately quits her job (designing airplane engines), packs up his coffin (which requires a ""code"" to be sealed)and hops on a plane with her daughter Julia, to fly to Long Island to bury hubby and move back in with mommy and daddy.She and Julia hear the boarding announcement for their flight, and for some reason, are the very, very first to board the plane.  Their seats are toward the back, and the plane is not full. Seated in front of them are some very nosy, loud kids, who constantly turn around and look over their seat.  After the plane takes off, Kyle and Julia agree to head for some empty seats even further back and stretch out. After a 3 hour nap, Kyle wakes up to find Julia gone.  Upset, she questions passengers and the flight crew. NO ONE (out of 425 passengers plus crew) will admit to seeing Kyle with a little girl. Upon hearing the loss of the child, all of the flight attendants smirk and snicker at Kyle. They ask around, but don't do a complete search until Kyle insists. Kyle thinks the search isn't complete enough, ends up throwing a fit, and is restrained with handcuffs. What she SHOULD have done, since she knew the exact layout of the plane, was search the plane herself (which she ended up doing later anyway).Personally, I found the plot completely preposterous (there are just too many variables required for it to work) and asking too much from the audience - a complete suspension of common sense.

To go more in depth, the movie begins with many questions, more so than answers and truly sets up a possible delusion situation with Jodie Foster's Kyle Pratt.  Is she insane, is her daughter missing?  Does anyone care?I hate spoiler reviews, but I have to write one in order to discuss why I rated it so low.  Although, really if you've seen any of the trailer for this, you know everything I'm going to say.To be honest, I really enjoyed about 1/2 of the film.  The mood it created, the claustrophobia, the feeling of unease was terrific.  Unfortunately, all of the major plot points have been ruined through trailers.  You know, just by watching one, that she gets on a plane, her daughter vanishes, then no one has seen her, then there's no record of her being on the plane, then there's record that she's dead.  Bam, that's the first half of the movie, given to you by trailers.  Then the ""big twist"" (if you can call it that), is stupid.  The one twist that HAS been hidden and kept under wraps is so mundane and silly that I felt let down.Jodie Foster is, of course, excellent in playing the devastated and fearful mother.  But she's had experience in that, having done the better Panic Room prior to this.  Sean Bean is there.  I'm a little tired of directors relying on him to play stock characters.  He was good in Lord of the Rings, give him something more please.  And Peter Sarsgaard, well, his role wasn't exactly the most interesting and was a bit on the nose.Marketing is so important anymore.  I enjoy trailers but I think they are destroying films.  I know that my knowing 1/2 of the movie before going to see it completely ruined my enjoyment of it.  It cheapens the experience.  In some movies, it only lessens my enjoyment.

After boarding an airplane she helped design, Kyle settles down for a nap, only to awaken and find that Julia is missing. Frenzied, Kyle demands the plane be searched, which irritates the flight attendants, and raises the suspicions of one of the passengers (Peter Sarsgaard). When each search comes up empty, fellow passengers start becoming agitated, and the captain of the plane (Sean Bean) wary of her motives, Kyle is forced to confront her own sanity and accept that Julia might not have existed at all. It's not any fault of ""Flightplan"" that it has to come out a month after Wes Craven's rollicking ""Red Eye."" After gorging on Craven's outrageous airplane thriller like it was a Halloween night candy bonanza, ""Flightplan"" dares to mount a similar nightmare-in-the-sky experience, this time crusted with a little more refinement and an A-list acting pedigree.Jodie Foster returns to a big screen starring role after her 2002 hit, ""Panic Room."" At first glance, the two films are quite similar, requiring the veteran actress to play an extremely physical part, maintaining intensity like a pro while crawling around tight spaces and confronting everyone in sight. ""Flightplan"" is a good example of Foster's uncanny ability to make almost any material work, and her performance here is a major reason why ""Flightplan"" has credible moments of any entertainment value.  Directed by German-born Robert Schwentke, ""Flightplan"" is a picture that is entirely about the art of persuasion. To delve into the plot too far would give away the surprises that Schwentke and his screenwriters have in store for the audience, much like ""Red Eye."" However, Schwentke takes the opposite route of Craven, and begins to fancy himself a Hitchcockian type of director, taking the film very seriously, even when the screenplay begins to veer off into the abyss of ridiculousness. Schwentke knows how to assemble a good suspense sequence, and ""Flightplan"" sets itself apart by freely exploring the post 9/11 airline world with its collection of undercover air marshals and suspicious Arab passengers.When truths are finally revealed in the second half, ""Flightplan"" slips into action mode, and things become increasingly hard to swallow. Schwentke doesn't seem prepared to handle the more outlandish moments of the extended climax, but the scenes work regardless since the film is so blessed with acting talent. By this time in the film, the audience is ready for a little brutality, and Schwentke is willing to give it to them, just not with the same quality of execution found in the first half.  The real problem with Flightplan is that the more you think back, the more you become frustrated with how inconceivable the whole charade was; the more you become irritated with how often you were lead to wonder about something eventually irrelevant. There are some films that don't give you all the answers and pull you along on a suspenseful ride, and leave you feeling fulfilled when you finally figure everything out, and everything fits together. ""Flightplan"" concludes, you know the culprit, and then you think back, and nothing fits together.",2,Flightplan  (2005),1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,3539,"['Director', 'Robert', 'SchwentkeCast', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Kate', 'Beahan', 'Michael', 'Irby', 'Assaf', 'Cohen', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Marlene', 'Lawston.Running', 'Time', '98', 'minutesRated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'intense', 'plot', 'material.After', 'mysterious', 'death', 'husband', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'Marlene', 'Lawston', 'are', 'looking', 'forward', 'relocating', 'Germany', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'boarding', 'airplane', 'helped', 'design', 'Kyle', 'down', 'nap', 'only', 'awaken', 'find', 'Julia', 'missing', 'Frenzied', 'Kyle', 'plane', 'be', 'searched', 'flight', 'attendants', 'suspicions', 'one', 'passengers', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'When', 'search', 'up', 'empty', 'fellow', 'passengers', 'start', 'becoming', 'agitated', 'captain', 'plane', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'wary', 'motives', 'Kyle', 'forced', 'confront', 'own', 'sanity', 'accept', 'Julia', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'existed', 'not', 'fault', 'Flightplan', 'come', 'out', 'month', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'rollicking', 'Red', 'Eye', 'gorging', 'Craven', 'outrageous', 'airplane', 'thriller', 'was', 'Halloween', 'night', 'candy', 'bonanza', 'Flightplan', 'dares', 'mount', 'similar', 'nightmare-in-the-sky', 'experience', 'time', 'crusted', 'little', 'more', 'refinement', 'A-list', 'acting', 'pedigree.Jodie', 'Foster', 'big', 'screen', 'starring', 'role', '2002', 'hit', 'Panic', 'Room', 'first', 'glance', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'similar', 'requiring', 'veteran', 'actress', 'play', 'extremely', 'physical', 'part', 'maintaining', 'intensity', 'pro', 'crawling', 'around', 'tight', 'spaces', 'confronting', 'everyone', 'sight', 'Flightplan', 'good', 'example', 'Foster', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'make', 'almost', 'material', 'work', 'performance', 'here', 'major', 'reason', 'why', 'Flightplan', 'credible', 'moments', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Directed', 'German-born', 'Robert', 'Schwentke', 'Flightplan', 'picture', 'entirely', 'art', 'persuasion', 'delve', 'plot', 'too', 'far', 'would', 'give', 'away', 'surprises', 'Schwentke', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'store', 'audience', 'much', 'Red', 'Eye', 'However', 'Schwentke', 'opposite', 'route', 'Craven', 'fancy', 'Hitchcockian', 'type', 'director', 'taking', 'film', 'very', 'seriously', 'even', 'when', 'screenplay', 'veer', 'off', 'abyss', 'ridiculousness', 'Schwentke', 'how', 'assemble', 'good', 'suspense', 'sequence', 'Flightplan', 'apart', 'freely', 'exploring', 'post', '9/11', 'airline', 'world', 'collection', 'undercover', 'air', 'marshals', 'suspicious', 'Arab', 'passengers.When', 'truths', 'are', 'finally', 'revealed', 'second', 'half', 'Flightplan', 'slips', 'action', 'mode', 'things', 'become', 'increasingly', 'hard', 'swallow', 'Schwentke', ""n't"", 'seem', 'prepared', 'handle', 'more', 'outlandish', 'moments', 'extended', 'climax', 'scenes', 'work', 'regardless', 'film', 'so', 'blessed', 'acting', 'talent', 'time', 'film', 'audience', 'ready', 'little', 'brutality', 'Schwentke', 'willing', 'give', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'quality', 'execution', 'found', 'first', 'half', 'real', 'problem', 'Flightplan', 'more', 'think', 'back', 'more', 'become', 'frustrated', 'how', 'inconceivable', 'whole', 'charade', 'was', 'more', 'become', 'irritated', 'how', 'often', 'were', 'lead', 'wonder', 'something', 'eventually', 'irrelevant', 'are', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'answers', 'pull', 'along', 'suspenseful', 'ride', 'leave', 'feeling', 'fulfilled', 'when', 'finally', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'everything', 'fits', 'together', 'Flightplan', 'know', 'culprit', 'then', 'think', 'back', 'nothing', 'fits', 'together']",N/A
953832,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BYY11O,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[31, 35]","Kyle (Jodie Foster), a former engineer for a large aerospace firm in Berlin, packs up her home and takes her daughter, Julia (Marlene Lawston) and her husband's dead body to the airport; they are flying back to New York, to start over. The flight happens to be on a new double decker jumbo jet (think the new Airbus jet) that she helped design. Kyle and her daughter get settled and a couple of hours into the flight, Kyle wakes up to find Julia missing. Kyle becomes frantic and insists that the plane be searched from head to toe. Since Kyle and her daughter were the first people on the plane, no one saw Julia. The captain (Sean Bean) listens to the accounts of his flight attendants, including Stephanie (Kate Beahan) and Fiona (Erika Christensen), who confirm that Julia was never on the manifest or seen, before finally agreeing to a search lead by the Air Marshall, Carson (Peter Saarsgard). Things don't go well.""Flightplan"", Jodie Foster's newest film, is a promising, taut thriller that ends with a whimper. Directed by Robert Schwentke, the film works well for a long time and then falls victim to many of the problems that plague thrillers.Beginning promisingly, we meet the grieving Kyle (Foster) who is mourning her husband's death. She has conversations with her dead husband, in the empty Berlin subway, or the empty snow swept streets. Her loss is significant and it isn't any easier that it happened in a foreign country, that she has a young daughter, or that there seems to be some question as to whether her husband slipped off the snowy roof or committed suicide. The film quickly establishes that Kyle and her husband have been in Berlin for a long time; six-year old Julia doesn't even know what type of food they have in America, so the trip home is a bit disorienting.Both of these factors; her grief and the disorienting trip home, help establish Kyle's vulnerability. At one point, a therapist (Greta Scacchi) on board is asked to speak to Kyle and she is easily swayed by the therapist's suggestions. All the people who are constantly telling her that Julia was never on the plane, or worse, begins to have an effect on her and she begins to question the fact herself. This is all highly effective and works extremely well.The plane itself is a unique and interesting setting for a thriller. Two stories, with the capability of carrying almost five hundred people at 30,000, the plane is immense, with many hiding places. Of course, it helps that Kyle is an engineer who worked on part of the plane. She knows the ins and outs, the compartments, how to get into the holds, and more. This works both for and against her. She can tell when the flight crew isn't being thorough, but she also becomes more of a threat to the safety of the plane. Which is why Carson is asked to detain her when no one can find her daughter and she becomes a bit violent.The set and the camera work add to the feeling of claustrophobia throughout. Not only do we get a sense of Kyle's frustration, in this relatively tiny, enclosed space, but these two elements help to give us the feeling these same passengers are experiencing. Yes, the plane is huge, the largest ever built, but it is still basically a tin can holding 450 people.When Kyle realizes that the search is not going to continue, she takes matters into her own hands. Foster's portrayal of this desperate woman is very good. Throughout, Kyle remains passionate and smart, two qualities not often found in a female protagonist. If a heroine is smart, she is usually cold and calculating, because she has to figure things out. Naturally, as a mother, Kyle is distraught over the disappearance of her daughter. Even more distraught now that she is alone. The blend of emotions seems natural and all credit for this should go to Foster.Many people may watch the trailers for ""Flight Plan"" and say something like ""Oh, so she made ""Panic Flight"""". Well, yes and no. Certainly, some comparisons can be drawn between the two, they are both thrillers, but ""Flight Plan"" is a more psychological thriller were ""Panic Room"" is a more action packed thriller. There is a large difference in tone and theme. For much of ""Flightplan"", Foster's Kyle doesn't know who, or even, if she is trying to identify a villain.During the first part of ""Flight"", the director and writers throw a lot of red herrings at us. Is the Captain (Bean) involved? How about the flight attendants Stephanie and Fiona (Beahan and Christensen)? Fiona is a new flight attendant, maybe she is behind the plan? What about those two men who are sitting at the front of the cabin and appear to be Middle Eastern? What about Kyle herself? Is she crazy? Does she imagine that her daughter is with her?Things start to unravel a bit when Kyle finally realizes she is sure that Julia was on the plane. This moment is not as conclusive as necessary to suddenly make the audience go `aha' and start rooting for Kyle. Until, and even after, this point, doubt is successfully cast on whether Kyle's daughter is a figment of her imagination or real.When the final reveal is made it seems a bit lacking. For all of the effort made to make everyone seem to be the villain, the actual identity of the villain is disappointing and there doesn't seem to be enough motivation for their actions. Why does this person want all of this to happen? It doesn't seem to have enough gravitas to make the film that memorable.The final few scenes are so overly dramatic that they seem to be from a different movie all together, or perhaps a television soap opera. I half imagined Susan Lucci's Erica Kane character in place of Foster's Kyle as she walks through... I will not reveal that much. Let's just say that the final few scenes are slow, poorly written and anticlimactic. In a thriller, you want the audience huffing and puffing, on the edge of their seat until the very final frame of film. Anytime wasted should not be at the end. This is your last chance to leave an impression with the audience. If the ending is slow, the audience may feel the same way.""Flightplan"" is a suspenseful, well-made film for the most part. But the film also suffers from the same problems a lot of thrillers have. Because Foster makes so few films, handpicking every project, you would expect that she would choose a thriller that was so tightly plotted a drop of water couldn't get through. In fact, the film has a number of holes in the plot, some large enough for the large jumbo jet to fly through on its way to New York via Berlin.Catch a bargain matinee or rent the DVD.",3,3 1/2 star

953834,A2Q4XG9UABH3S3,B000BYY11O,"Torquemada ""dunlopilo""","[13, 21]","Selecting a film has become increasingly difficult because of the variety of options on the market, among which you get films which were used to be called ""telefilms"". Telefilms were those made specifically for television, aiming at a large population, less demanding as to the intrinsic quality of the product. The main reasons were that viewers were not paying to see the film, that being home they generally combined it with other activities (talking on the phone, to friends, or even sleeping) and the viewing was on lower quality screens than the ones in the cinemas.This is not as true today (home theatres can offer high quality of sound, large screens wit high picture definition are more and more available), but you still get the equivalent of those telefilms on DVDs. ""Flightplan"" is one of those underproducts.I won't go over the story or suspense of this film. Just be aware that you will see a lot of running by Jodie Foster in closed spaces, a very questionable script, weak performances by all the actors (I never had seen most of them on any performance before, and they are very stiff), a horribly designed aircraft for special effects (you can really tell on many shots it is a phoney plane). A big disappointment because you have the impression that the initial intention of the makers was to deliver a Hitchcock type of film, with lots of suspense, and an unexpected ending. It is in fact a mess. What is the reason for including the incident with the middle eastern passenger ? Why does he commit assault on Jodie Foster and what happens to him for that ? Why does the aircraft have those constant earthquake like shakes during the flight, which are unrealistic (anybody who has taken an airplane knows turbulences are not like that) ? What is the reason for showing that, instead of looking for the disappeared girl, two of the cabin crew members hid in a corner to have ""unallowed"" fun ? What about the rest of the crew that behaves like zombies ? And why would anybody make a bank wire (following the request of the highjacker) without any investigation ? The plot about the husband flying over the roof doesn't make much sense either. All this does not bring anything consistent into the film; rather, it makes it less credible.I mentioned the special effects before. Let me add that one of the last scenes with the explosion and breakup of the aircraft looks cheap and executed by people with little skills. When going into the menu of the dvd, the explanation about the scenes with the aircraft was that they had to ""create"" from nothing because that type of plane does not exist, and they seem proud of the result achieved. Well, that is just wrong, that type of plane does exist. It is the first double decker in commercial aviation. Airbus 380.To the filmmakers : Next time you get into something like this, get real actors, see how the job is really done on an airplane, get a good special effects crew, and use a credible script, avoiding cheap and unrealistic cliches. To the consumers or good film lovers : get something else or watch ""Lost"" instead, and if you like Jodie Foster, watch ""panic room"" (not a great film either, but at least more consistent) or, of course ""Silence of the lambs"", close to masterpiece. Comparisons can be lethal.The flightplan here turns out to be a bad plan.P.S. Now you can hit me with all the negatives you want, but at least I've explained WHY I think this is a very weak film.",1,Bad plan...,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,3446,"['Selecting', 'film', 'become', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'variety', 'options', 'market', 'get', 'films', 'were', 'used', 'be', 'called', 'telefilms', 'Telefilms', 'were', 'made', 'specifically', 'television', 'aiming', 'large', 'population', 'less', 'demanding', 'intrinsic', 'quality', 'product', 'main', 'reasons', 'were', 'viewers', 'were', 'not', 'paying', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'home', 'generally', 'combined', 'other', 'activities', 'talking', 'phone', 'friends', 'even', 'sleeping', 'viewing', 'was', 'lower', 'quality', 'screens', 'ones', 'cinemas.This', 'not', 'true', 'today', 'home', 'theatres', 'can', 'offer', 'high', 'quality', 'sound', 'large', 'screens', 'wit', 'high', 'picture', 'definition', 'are', 'more', 'more', 'available', 'still', 'get', 'equivalent', 'telefilms', 'DVDs', 'Flightplan', 'one', 'underproducts.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'story', 'suspense', 'film', 'Just', 'be', 'aware', 'will', 'see', 'lot', 'running', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'closed', 'spaces', 'very', 'questionable', 'script', 'weak', 'performances', 'actors', 'never', 'had', 'seen', 'most', 'performance', 'are', 'very', 'stiff', 'horribly', 'designed', 'aircraft', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'really', 'tell', 'many', 'shots', 'phoney', 'plane', 'big', 'disappointment', 'have', 'impression', 'initial', 'intention', 'makers', 'was', 'deliver', 'Hitchcock', 'type', 'film', 'lots', 'suspense', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'fact', 'mess', 'What', 'reason', 'including', 'incident', 'middle', 'eastern', 'passenger', 'Why', 'commit', 'assault', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'what', 'Why', 'aircraft', 'have', 'constant', 'earthquake', 'shakes', 'flight', 'are', 'unrealistic', 'anybody', 'who', 'taken', 'airplane', 'knows', 'turbulences', 'are', 'not', 'What', 'reason', 'showing', 'instead', 'looking', 'disappeared', 'girl', 'two', 'cabin', 'crew', 'members', 'hid', 'corner', 'have', 'unallowed', 'fun', 'What', 'rest', 'crew', 'zombies', 'why', 'would', 'anybody', 'make', 'bank', 'wire', 'following', 'request', 'highjacker', 'investigation', 'plot', 'husband', 'flying', 'roof', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'either', 'not', 'bring', 'anything', 'consistent', 'film', 'rather', 'less', 'credible.I', 'mentioned', 'special', 'effects', 'Let', 'add', 'one', 'last', 'scenes', 'explosion', 'breakup', 'aircraft', 'cheap', 'executed', 'people', 'little', 'skills', 'When', 'going', 'menu', 'dvd', 'explanation', 'scenes', 'aircraft', 'was', 'had', 'create', 'nothing', 'type', 'plane', 'not', 'exist', 'seem', 'proud', 'result', 'achieved', 'Well', 'just', 'wrong', 'type', 'plane', 'exist', 'first', 'double', 'decker', 'commercial', 'aviation', '380.To', 'filmmakers', 'Next', 'time', 'get', 'something', 'get', 'real', 'actors', 'see', 'how', 'job', 'really', 'done', 'airplane', 'get', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'crew', 'use', 'credible', 'script', 'avoiding', 'cheap', 'unrealistic', 'cliches', 'consumers', 'good', 'film', 'lovers', 'get', 'something', 'else', 'watch', 'Lost', 'instead', 'like', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'watch', 'panic', 'room', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'least', 'more', 'consistent', 'course', 'Silence', 'lambs', 'close', 'masterpiece', 'Comparisons', 'can', 'be', 'lethal.The', 'flightplan', 'here', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'plan.P.S', 'Now', 'can', 'hit', 'negatives', 'want', 'least', ""'ve"", 'explained', 'WHY', 'think', 'very', 'weak', 'film']",N/A
953835,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000BYY11O,trebe,"[0, 1]","The intriguing premise of a young girl vanishing without a trace, while on a transcontinental flight, is the cornerstone of Flightplan (2005), a suspense thriller from producer Brian Glazer that stars a tough as steel Jodie Foster.  Requiring some massive suspension of disbelief, and putting aside logic, the story is as solid as a house of cards.  It's hard to imagine that a child could actually disappear without a trace, but this tale is told with so much emotion and bravado, and pretense is carried forward with such bold confidence, that much like a magician's grand illusion, you go along with the trick, while speculating on how it might be done.  The film plays with the audience, dangling the possibility that the missing girl may not even be real, as a great effort is made to pump up the drama and tension.  Unfortunately, the movie falters down the stretch, as the rationale behind the elaborate scheme, is less than totally convincing.Few can bring the kind off relentless determination and righteous maternal outrage to a role, like Jodie Foster, who similar to a pit bull, refuses to give up, and seems at times to cross the line between sanity and madness.  Although Peter Sarsgaard and Sean Bean give strong performances, they are each overpowered by Foster's electric presence.Kyle Pratt (Foster) is an aircraft engineer working in Berlin, whose husband has just died in an accident.  The widow, along with her six year old daughter Julia (Marlene Lawson), are on a flight to New York City, with her husband's casket in the hold.  Pratt falls asleep, and finds her daughter missing when she wakes up.  Unable to locate Julia, Pratt begins to assert herself.  Matters soon escalate to involve air marshal Gene Carson (Sarsgaard) and the pilot Captain Rich (Bean), who has his crew conduct a search of the plane.  No signs of the girl are found, and those in charge begin to doubt Pratt, because no one remembers seeing Julia, there is no record of her boarding, and Pratt has ""lost"" her daughter's boarding pass.A supercritical element is that Kyle Pratt helped design the E-474, the same type of aircraft that she is flying in.  Her Intimate knowledge of the plane's construction and layout, helps her to evade capture, travel through restricted areas, and affect the plane's functions, when she goes ""rogue"", attempting to locate her daughter without regard for anyone else.Playing out with some similarities to the old TV series Banacek, Flightplan has a number of large plot holes, starting with no one on the plane seeing Julia.  Exploring these faults in detail, would lead to some major spoilers, so suffices to say, that after the identity of the perpetrators is revealed, the story becomes even more outlandish, as the authorities play almost no role in what happens, and Pratt goes into full action hero mode.This is a first rate production, with high quality special effects, unique sets for fictional cutting edge jet, and even a high tech coffin.  The plane's design, interiors, operational systems, storage hold, and equipment layout, are more fantasy than reality, but it hardly seems to matter.  In a breakthrough effort, director Robert Schwentke (The Time Traveler's Wife,Red) delivers the kind of film you would expect from a Brian Grazer production, and one that should please Jodie Foster fans.  Appearing in films likePanic Room(2002) andThe Brave One(2007), Foster continues to impress in physically demanding roles.  Schwentke delves into the filmmaking process, and eloquently explains and analyzes his vision, in a rather comprehensive commentary.The reality in Flightplan feels very much like your typical airplane disaster movie, as the story attempts to manipulate its audience on a grand scale.  It's very much a show, but those who get aboard this flight will probably be entertained, as there are few things as strong as a mother's love.

Recently bereaved mother Kyle Pratt leaves Germany for New York with her 6-year-old daughter. But in the airplane (and quite a huge airplane, of which design she happened to have participated in) her daughter disappears while Kyle was sleeping. Kyle gets panicky, even suspecting the conspiracy.Or is it only her delusion? Is her daughter really on board or not? This kind of situation is nothing new and original, and the answer to this engaging question in `Flightplan' is as preposterous as that of `Forgotten.' Both thrillers have good acting in common as well as numerous plot holes.One thing I can recommend is the film's atmospheric images. German-born director Robert Shwentke creates claustrophobic space of a flying airplane and the detached, unsympathetic reaction of the passengers to the mother.Jodie Foster did a good job as always as Kyle, but her good acting as distraught mother is at odds with the often incredible decisions done by her character. The same thing can be said about Peter Sarsgaard, whose character is often subject to the rules of Grade B-actions. Sean Bean, Erika Christensen, Kate Beahan and Greta Scacchi also appear, but the film's contrived script does not give enough room for the actors to do what they can do except the mininum function in the story.So is it worth our time? It is as long as you don't think, and probably there would be no second watching. `Flightplan' is a fairly entertaining thriller made with Oscar-winning actress in the middle of the B-action formula.",3,Jodie Foster's Hitchcockian Thriller Entertaining As Long As You Refuse to Acknowledge the Plot Holes,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,1851,"['[', 'JODIE', 'FOSTER', 'IN', 'HITCHCOK-TYPE', 'THRILLER', ']', 'Flightplan', 'aerial', 'version', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'none', 'wits', 'great', 'master', 'suspense', 'new', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'film', 'tradition', 'Hitchcock', 'thrillers', 'being', 'enough', 'suspenseful', 'up', 'very', 'conclusion', 'plain', 'impossible.The', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'Recently', 'bereaved', 'mother', 'Kyle', 'Pratt', 'Germany', 'New', 'York', '6-year-old', 'daughter', 'airplane', 'quite', 'huge', 'airplane', 'design', 'happened', 'have', 'participated', 'daughter', 'disappears', 'Kyle', 'was', 'sleeping', 'Kyle', 'panicky', 'even', 'suspecting', 'conspiracy.Or', 'only', 'delusion', 'daughter', 'really', 'board', 'not', 'kind', 'situation', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'answer', 'engaging', 'question', 'Flightplan', 'as', 'preposterous', 'Forgotten', 'thrillers', 'have', 'good', 'acting', 'common', 'as', 'well', 'numerous', 'plot', 'holes.One', 'thing', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'atmospheric', 'images', 'German-born', 'director', 'Robert', 'Shwentke', 'claustrophobic', 'space', 'flying', 'airplane', 'detached', 'unsympathetic', 'reaction', 'passengers', 'mother.Jodie', 'Foster', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'always', 'Kyle', 'good', 'acting', 'distraught', 'mother', 'odds', 'often', 'incredible', 'decisions', 'done', 'character', 'same', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'character', 'often', 'subject', 'rules', 'Grade', 'B-actions', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Kate', 'Beahan', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'also', 'appear', 'film', 'contrived', 'script', 'not', 'give', 'enough', 'room', 'actors', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'mininum', 'function', 'story.So', 'time', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'second', 'watching', 'Flightplan', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'made', 'Oscar-winning', 'actress', 'middle', 'B-action', 'formula']",N/A

953840,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B000BYY11O,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[2, 2]","A gem of a movie. I loved every minute of it. Jodie Foster is the mother of a girl who is suddenly lost on a plane in mid flight. The girl is not registered on the boarding list and the plane crew things she's gone bonkers and they find documents on her pointing to the fact that her daughter died earlier. Add to the fact that she is on the plane toactually carry the body of her deceased husband (who apparently for illogical reasons jumped of a building committing suicide) back to USA. The movie begins with her trying to come to grips with her husband's death and we see that the daughter was with her but then we also think whether Jodie just hallucinated all this due to her just recent grief onthe loss of her husband and a supposedly additional loss of her daughter (as per some documents on her). She claims it has all been fixed and that the girl is on the plane. Being from the engineering department of that same plane's engine manufacturing company, she has intimate understanding of the design and schematics of the plane. Its kind of like a mini die hard movie inside flight plan. There are tense moments with passengers, airhostesses, pilot and an interesting and very important air marshall. Till about half way its a suspense film where you dont know what is real and unreal (Is Jodie imagining stuff that her daughter is alive ?) and then the movie becomes a thriller action adventure. A non existant large model shooting set was built as a plane with no outside walls so they could take fast moving rail shots or dolly shots. The extras section of dvd show som real cool production design that went into building the set. They made an actual new airplane interior model. With specific positioning of cameras with tracks and rails to move within the aircraft. Jodie is so good at these ""fight back"" characters. ""Panic room"" and now recently ""the brave one"".She is the female version of the die-hard spirit. She refuses to give up in any situation. She has this icy steely determined look, at the same time a look of vulnerability and she has the gym physique that you believe she has the physical reserves needed also to fight back.

Kyle (Jodie Foster)a recently widowed plane engineer is returning to the United States with her daughter and her husband's body. She's distracted, distraught,  and having a difficult time coping with the loss of her husband taking multiple medications for anxiety. Midflight after she takes a nap she discovers her daughter missing. The Captain (Sean Bean) and Air Marshal (Peter Skarrsgard) begin to doubt her sanity as more and more information about her situation becomes available.Imaginatively directed by Robert Schwentke with a number of strong performances, the film falls apart during the third act of the film and stretches believability a bit. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining thrill ride. Fans of Foster who enjoyed ""Panic Room"" will enjoy this tense thriller. Originally the thriller was written with a male airport security officer and his son, the script was retooled by writer Billy Ray(""Suspect Zero"")from an original script by first time writer Peter Dowling.The extras are pretty good in this set including a thoughtful solo commentary track by Robert Schwentke where he discusses everything from unsuccessful previews, retooling sections that weren't clear after the preview and even rethinking entire sequences in the film. It's an honest appraisal of his film and the shortcomings he felt it had as well as the improvements. There's a great featurette on the visual effects of the film and I was quite surprised to see that they used a large scale model for the visual effects involving the plane vs. CGI (there is CGI in the film as well). It's a cool featurette. We also get a ""making of"" featurette where we hear from everyone including the original writer about the changes to the script, issues they had during shooting, etc. The featurettes are a valuable glimpse into how making a movie is very much a collabortive artform but also how the right director can help give a film its much needed focus.""Flightplan"" is a fun thrill ride even if parts of the film are a bit implausible.

Where is the tension, thrills, suspense, and just a general sense of urgency?  Nowhere to be found.Jodie Foster, as good as she is, didn't portray the ""mother in agony"" as strongly as the role should have been.  James Horner's music, though bautiful, didn't fit this film.  The direction and editing were not tight enough, to make this film even remotely interesting.All in all, totally uninvolving, and deeply disappointing.

Even though I am not satisfied by this film's story, it's still great to see the captivating performance from Jodie Foster who managered to make this mediocre film more watchable, not to mention that the supporting cast includes talented young actresses like Erika Christensen(The Upside of Anger) and Kate(Chopper), the underused and scene-stealing Greta Scacchi, Sean Bean, and the always brilliant supporting player Peter Sarsgaard(Kinsey, The Skeleton Key, Boys Don't Cry).Kyle(Foster) is a sophisticated plane engineer who is grieving over the death of her husband and decids to take her six year old daughter Julia back to New York to be with her folks. Kyle and daughter were the first passengers to board the newest and largest Germany-based plane that was designed by her. Kyle fell asleep and a few hours later, her daughter was missing. She panic when she couldn't find her little girl. For some reason, the fellow passengers and the flight attendents(Christensen and Beahan) as well as the plane marshall(Sarsgaard) who sat near her told her they never saw her daughter with her in the first place. Eventually, she would take matters into her own hands and violates the rules and broke into the restricted parts of the the interiors in hoping to find her daughter since she suspected someone is kidnapping her. She came across two Arabian passengers whom she recognized from the hotel where they had stay, and accused them of taking her daughter. The situation would eventually get very chaotic, and even the captain(Sean Bean) started to believe that she was delusional. The crew would have her detained and sent a theapist(Scacchi) to calm her down. Nobody believe her words anymore, and it was upto herself to break lose and figure out this puzzle and identify the real mastermind amongst all the suspects in the scene....Even tough the script made the viewers to believe who might have been the villian halfway through the film, it really became more obvious and surprising, but unconvincing as a solution to the direction of the plot. Well, I thought Christensen's character was going to be the villian, but I was wrong. I am not going to give it away. The design of the interiors is very impressive. It's an overall very well movie, but can be much better if they had put more effort on the script. The upside of this film is that it had dominated the box office two weeks in a row, and that's certainly a good thing for the semi-retired Jodie Foster whom I am dying to see in a heavy-duty drama next time she's on.",3,Intense and Gripping Flying Experience Towards Unsatisfying Climax.,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,2709,"['agreed', 'who', 'instantly', 'compared', 'film', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Panic', 'Room', 'film', 'more', 'psychological', 'level', 'minimum', 'amount', 'action', 'taken', 'place', 'Even', 'am', 'not', 'satisfied', 'film', 'story', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'captivating', 'performance', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', 'managered', 'make', 'mediocre', 'film', 'more', 'watchable', 'not', 'mention', 'supporting', 'cast', 'talented', 'young', 'actresses', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Upside', 'Anger', 'Kate', 'Chopper', 'underused', 'scene-stealing', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'always', 'brilliant', 'supporting', 'player', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'Kinsey', 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', '.Kyle', 'Foster', 'sophisticated', 'plane', 'engineer', 'who', 'grieving', 'death', 'husband', 'decids', 'take', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Julia', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'be', 'folks', 'Kyle', 'daughter', 'were', 'first', 'passengers', 'board', 'newest', 'largest', 'Germany-based', 'plane', 'was', 'designed', 'Kyle', 'fell', 'asleep', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'daughter', 'was', 'missing', 'panic', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'little', 'girl', 'reason', 'fellow', 'passengers', 'flight', 'attendents', 'Christensen', 'Beahan', 'as', 'well', 'plane', 'marshall', 'Sarsgaard', 'who', 'sat', 'told', 'never', 'saw', 'daughter', 'first', 'place', 'Eventually', 'would', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'rules', 'broke', 'restricted', 'parts', 'interiors', 'hoping', 'find', 'daughter', 'suspected', 'someone', 'kidnapping', 'came', 'two', 'Arabian', 'passengers', 'whom', 'recognized', 'hotel', 'where', 'had', 'stay', 'accused', 'taking', 'daughter', 'situation', 'would', 'eventually', 'get', 'very', 'chaotic', 'even', 'captain', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'started', 'believe', 'was', 'delusional', 'crew', 'would', 'have', 'detained', 'sent', 'theapist', 'Scacchi', 'calm', 'down', 'Nobody', 'believe', 'words', 'anymore', 'was', 'upto', 'break', 'lose', 'figure', 'out', 'puzzle', 'identify', 'real', 'mastermind', 'suspects', 'scene', '.Even', 'tough', 'script', 'made', 'viewers', 'believe', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'villian', 'halfway', 'film', 'really', 'became', 'more', 'obvious', 'surprising', 'unconvincing', 'solution', 'direction', 'plot', 'Well', 'thought', 'Christensen', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'villian', 'was', 'wrong', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'design', 'interiors', 'very', 'impressive', 'overall', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'script', 'upside', 'film', 'had', 'dominated', 'box', 'office', 'two', 'weeks', 'row', 'certainly', 'good', 'thing', 'semi-retired', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'whom', 'am', 'dying', 'see', 'heavy-duty', 'drama', 'next', 'time']",N/A
