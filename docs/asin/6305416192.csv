463048,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6305416192,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The introduction says this picture has no resemblance to the men and women of the press today. [Really? Do people still think a Hollywood film is reality?] This was adapted from the famous play ""The Front Page"", a parody of Chicago and the press of the 1920s. The film opens on a newspaper office from decades past. A reporter tells the Editor of her plans, they discuss their past. Hildy is getting married and will quit journalism. What will Walter do? A sneaky trick? Hildy wants a normal life. Does life insurance help people? [Does this chatter slow down the film?] Will the editor exploit a death sentence to sell newspapers? Or other sensational news of an unexpected death? [Yes, its what people want.]The condemned man will be checked by an alienist. The reporters wait in the newsroom. They tell what happened. [Does unemployment cause more crime?] Hildy Johnson knows how to get an interview? Will she create a story? ""Production for use."" Will reporters make up a story? Are they cynical? Is Molly too emotional? [But it makes good drama. This story mocks government as much as newspapers.] But an event changes Hildy's mind: Earl Williams escaped! Walter Burns is terribly tricky. So too the Mayor. ""I can fix anything."" There is a dramatic surprise! The film picks up when the original story is used. Will the story be played to influence the election? Hildy can't give up the excitement of her job. Is there anyone who won't be double-crossed by Walter Burns?The highpoint is the recapture of Earl Williams. Each reporter files a different version of the capture. Who can you believe? Then the courier with the reprieve shows up; this changes everything. Walter Burns' scheme with the money causes more trouble for Bruce Baldwin. Hildy relents, she returns to the excitement of her job (and her old marriage?). [Was this ending required by the movie code or censorship?] I think the 1975 version of this play was better than this film. Was it modified for changing tastes?The real Walter N. Burns was a newspaper editor who wrote a biography of `Billy the Kid' in 1926 that presented him as a popular hero to some of the people of New Mexico. Previously he was always shown as a dangerous killer. Robert M.

463049,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305416192,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 6]","A few weeks ago I reviewed one of Grant's earlier projects with director Howard Hawks called Bringing Up Baby and completely despised it.  It was annoying, unfunny, and the timing was completely moldy.  Well, maybe Hawks learned from his mistakes because His Girl Friday was the direct opposite.  While in Baby I thought that Grant and Hepburn made a horrific team whom couldn't play off each other, in this film Grant's chemistry with Rosalind Russell is impeccable.  They both know timing and they both are able to keep up with each other.  Both have their characters developed and understood so even if there was some ad lib mixed in with the script, we wouldn't know because they are able to playfully compete with each other on screen.  The story is rather dark, surprisingly, which keeps the viewer attracted to the themes and plot, which unfolds with lightning speed in front of us.  You have the sensation that Hawks felt comfortable with this film, the challenges and the actors unlike the outcome of Bringing Up Baby.  Everyone involved seems to be on top of their game providing yet another memorable chapter in ""screwball comedy"" history.I must say that originally my impression of Cary Grant was not a desirable one.  My first film viewed in which he stars did not leave a great taste in my mouth, but thankfully he was able to counter with this film.  Grant seemed born to play Burns, and I wonder if it wasn't more comforting for him.  He seemed relaxed in this role, familiar with his mannerisms, and completely in control.  His ability to be constantly above 100% in each scene we watch was impressive, but what I found most enjoyable was Rosalind Russell's performance.  She matched what Grant had and raised it even higher.  You could not keep your eyes off her as she controlled every scene she was involved with.  Her ability to be stronger than the male characters, and honestly smarter, was impressive for a film made in the 1940s.  This was a strong woman doing a man's job, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hawks wasn't trying to tell us something here.  While the ending of the film didn't seem to fit as well as the rest of the film with Russell, she was so charismatic, so charming, and so innocent, that you could not help but root for her during the entire run.  She captured you and never let you go!While the characters did create this film and keep you laughing constantly, the story wasn't shabby either.  It was actually a very dark story, darker than I anticipated a film starring Cary Grant would be.  Here you have a newspaper conglomerate that has the power to sway the decisions of Governors, to take sides in public matters, to cohort with evildoers and still remain at the top of their game.  While I do believe Hawks was trying to recreate the reality of such a fast paced work environment, I couldn't help but wonder if he wasn't speaking even on broader terms.  Did he hold some animosity towards the media?  Did Hawks think that perhaps the media was swaying the public's image away from the truth?  One scene that I thought was sheer brilliance was when Molly Malloy (Helen Mack) arrived in the pressroom frantically yelling about how the newsmen smeared the truth throughout the paper.  It was so bad that she herself couldn't remember what really happened.  It seemed that every word that came from Molly's mouth was twisted into a new, far-fetched story.  It was similar to a game of telephone.  The truth may be staring you in the face, but when it reaches the end of the line, it may be something completely different.  I think Hawks was trying to tell us something.  Even when Molly finally reaches her climactic scene, you cannot help but wonder if she doesn't represent a part of Hawks, or the entertainment industry, or anyone hurt by the media.  Inside this ""screwball comedy"" was something deeper and very disturbing.Overall, I was impressed with this film.  I loved the language of the characters.  I love the way that Cary Grant embodied this manipulative man who got everything he reached out for.  Beware those thinking that this is a feminist film, while there may be a very strong central female character, the smarter Grant constantly undermines her.  The ending was the only part of this film that I had trouble dealing with.  While Hawks was trying desperately to drive a point home, it just seemed choppier than the rest of the film.  The ending felt rushed and completely bland.  I needed a stronger structure, but was extremely happy with the rest of the film.  This was an amazing feature, for both the creative and charismatic characters that were painted onto the screen, but also with the hidden themes that Hawks threw in between jokes.  I found myself laughing and thinking at the same time.  This truly was one of those films that was released well before its time.Grade: **** out of *****",4,What did I treat you like?

463050,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6305416192,Alex Udvary,"[2, 3]","I don't know if Howard Hawk's ""His Girl Friday"" is the greatest dialogue comedy of all-time, but it's certainly in the top five. I can only think of one other comedy where the dialogue is as fast paced as this movie, and that's ""Duck Soup"". But it took four Marx brothers to match what Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell do in this picture.For those who don't know ""His Girl Friday"" is a remake of the stage play ""The Front Page"" written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur only in this version a battle of the sexes element is added, as the star report (played by Russell) is a woman, turning this into one of the great screwball comedies.Cary Grant plays Walter Burns, an editor at a newspaper who has absolutely no ethics, we won't go into if anything has changed now. When Walter finds out his star report and may I add ex-wife ""Hildy"" Johnson (Russell) is going to leave the paper in order to get married to Bruce Baldwin (played by an actor who looks surprisingly like Ralph Bellamy, as Cary Grant tells us in the movie). Well, Walter simply won't hear of this. How can he just sit by and watch his ace reporter leave. Plus we suspect perhaps deep down they still love each other. But ""love"" really doesn't matter. Walter will say or do anything just as long as ""Hildy"" doesn't leave.Now while all of this is going on a major story is about to break out as an execution is going to take place in a murder case. Walter's paper has been defended the man claiming he's criminally insane. So Walter wants ""Hildy"" to go and interview the prisoner to prove his innocence.In the newsroom though is where most of the fun takes place. Some of the reports include Cliff Edwards (probably best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket in ""Pinocchio"" and star of a couple of Buster Keaton comedies such as ""Bedroom, Parlor, and Bath"" and ""Doughboys"") and Roscoe Kerns (""It Happened One Night"" and Hawk's ""Twentieth Century"")Hawks wasn't primarily a comedy director, he did direct some John Wayne westerns and gangster pictures (the original ""Scarface""). But some of his best work can be found in his comedies. He and Grant worked together on ""Bringing Up Baby"" two years earlier and ""I Was A Male War Bride"" nine years later.""His Girl Friday"" is a classic example of great screwball comedy. The witty banther between Grant and Russell is priceless and worth the price of a DVD alone. You will never see a comedy as fast as this one.Also worth mentioning is a delightful cameo by Billy Gilbert. His brief work is scene-stealing good!Bottom-line: One of the fastest dialogue comedies of all-time. One of Hawks' and Grant's best works together.

463051,AGEIT17HENDIS,6305416192,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I suppose  the world could use a laugh, could use getting away from the bummer daily headlines anytime and anyplace and hide for a couple of hours in the cinematic world, a world where the funny can be therapy for the ailments of the day. Probably in the time of the film under review, His Girl Friday a female-centered newspaper story variation on the original story, The Front Page, a time when the world was stirring out of the Great Depression and the flames of war were enveloping Europe and the Far East the need for such relief was as important as any other time. And the flamboyant newspaper publisher played by Cary Grant and the feisty newspaper reporter played by Rosalind Russell delivered using all the comedic skills at their command.Now the story line, the hot-cold love between Grant and Russell who have divorced, well, divorced over the differences in perspective about what married life was about for two working professionals, overlaid by the big news story of the day, the upcoming execution of a harmless Walter Mitty-type for murdering a police officer, is not what drives this one. Nor is it the witty take on governmental corruption and incompetent, the sensationalism of the media, or the current events of the day. It is the strangely inviting repartee between Grant and Russell as the debonair Grant tries to persuade the reluctant Russell to do one last story, the career-making big one on the execution, before setting off into the sunset to that white house with picket fence, a couple of kids and a dog in,ah, Albany. The patter between the pair as Grant works his charm and Russell comes to realize that she is a hell of newspaperman (today news reporter) is what provides the laughs as they, at times, seem to be working their lines overreach other.

The material is so ripe and yet the film had this filmy `un-eventfulness' that corroded what could have been absolute perfection.  Like I said, I liked it more than most and yet I still recognize that something was off, despite a killer cast and director.  Then I saw `His Girl Friday' (a film I was unaware was based off the same stage play) and it all clicked.Hildy NEEDS to be a woman.It is funny to think that a mere gender change can make all the difference, but the same dialog spouted between ex-lovers makes a much broader impact, and it doesn't hurt that the chemistry created contains a stiffer upper-cut.  Lemmon and Matthau make a great team, don't get me wrong, and they built on that chemistry for years, but there is something about the way that Russell and Grant spar off one another that is otherworldly.The film centers on Hildy, a newspaper reporter who is reporting to her boss, her ex-husband Walter, with her resignation.  She is quitting the newspaper business and getting married.  Walter isn't going to take this lying down.  Not only is he still infatuated with his ex-wife, but she is his best reporter, and he isn't about to lose her.  So, he manipulates the situation to get her to stay for one last report, and once she's been bitten by the bug she has a very hard time walking away.  As the situation spins out of control thanks to circumstances beyond all control, these two are forced to reevaluate what it is that they want from each other and their lives; and their careers.I find it baffling that this was ignored entirely by Oscar.  Not only is Rosalind Russell Oscar worthy here, but Grant is also at the top of his game, and the sensationally written dialog certainly deserved an Oscar nomination.  This is one of those great comedies of times past that deserves all the attention it can get.

463056,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6305416192,Andrew McCaffrey,"[9, 9]","(Please note that the DVD version I am reviewing is the Laserlight release that features an additional documentary on the life of Cary Grant as well as an introduction by an even-more-confused-than-usual Tony Curtis.)With Laserlight you can never predict from the outside case exactly what the quality of the film itself is going to be in.  I've watched good quality prints from them in the past, but I've also seen some truly awful releases that aren't worth the plastic that they're pressed on.  Fortunately, their version of HIS GIRL FRIDAY is quite excellent, with a crisp picture and a clear soundtrack.  Their budget releases are usually worth the risk, and in this case, you end up with a great movie that's quite well preserved and all for a fairly low price.The movie itself is simply fantastic.  The dialogue comes flying at you so fast that'll be afraid to laugh for fear of speaking over the next line.  The story itself is also intensely funny, and deceptively dark.  What begins as a seemingly light romantic comedy slowly becomes more and more twisted until the final scene, where the reinstatement of the romance subplot reminds us of how far we've come.  It's a testament to the skills of the director, Howard Hawks, that the result is not only coherent, but also highly enjoyable.  The story flows effortlessly from moment to moment, with each scene being slightly more frantic than the last, yet still together enough to be extremely entertaining.The acting from the two main leads is also a delight.  In the past I had thought of Cary Grant as always playing the same sort of character in every film.  Although, you'll see some similarity to other roles that he played, he's incredibly amusing in this film and playing a far more manipulative character than I'd seen him perform.  It's a nice change to see the usually easily befuddled Cary Grant actually running rings around the rest of the cast.As for the DVD extras, they don't distract from the feature, but they won't be the deciding factor in whether you purchase this DVD or not.  The included documentary, CARY GRANT ON FILM: A BIOGRAPHY runs about 28 minutes long and consists mainly of random trailers that span Grant's entire film career.  It's fairly interesting, although not terribly riveting.  The introductory remarks by Tony Curtis are as bizarrely entertaining as always.  The film contains Spanish, Japanese and Chinese subtitles, but does not include an option for English, which is a slightly annoying oversight.In the end, it's not the extras that you should be buying this disc for; it's the wonderful film that's packaged with them.  Kick back, relax, and watch the dialog fly across the screen.  You'll want to keep the remote control handy so that you can rewind to catch all the great moments that you missed while laughing over them.",5,Witty and entertaining,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,2832,"['Please', 'note', 'DVD', 'version', 'am', 'reviewing', 'Laserlight', 'release', 'additional', 'documentary', 'life', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'as', 'well', 'introduction', 'even-more-confused-than-usual', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'Laserlight', 'can', 'never', 'predict', 'outside', 'case', 'exactly', 'what', 'quality', 'film', 'going', 'be', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'good', 'quality', 'prints', 'past', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'truly', 'awful', 'releases', 'are', ""n't"", 'plastic', ""'re"", 'pressed', 'Fortunately', 'version', 'HIS', 'GIRL', 'FRIDAY', 'quite', 'excellent', 'crisp', 'picture', 'clear', 'soundtrack', 'budget', 'releases', 'are', 'usually', 'risk', 'case', 'end', 'up', 'great', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'preserved', 'fairly', 'low', 'price.The', 'movie', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'dialogue', 'flying', 'so', 'fast', ""'ll"", 'be', 'afraid', 'fear', 'speaking', 'next', 'line', 'story', 'also', 'intensely', 'funny', 'deceptively', 'dark', 'What', 'seemingly', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'slowly', 'more', 'more', 'twisted', 'final', 'scene', 'where', 'reinstatement', 'romance', 'subplot', 'how', 'far', ""'ve"", 'come', 'testament', 'skills', 'director', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'result', 'not', 'only', 'coherent', 'also', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'effortlessly', 'moment', 'moment', 'scene', 'being', 'slightly', 'more', 'frantic', 'last', 'yet', 'still', 'together', 'enough', 'be', 'extremely', 'entertaining.The', 'acting', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'also', 'delight', 'past', 'had', 'thought', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'always', 'playing', 'same', 'sort', 'character', 'film', ""'ll"", 'see', 'similarity', 'other', 'roles', 'played', 'incredibly', 'amusing', 'film', 'playing', 'far', 'more', 'manipulative', 'character', ""'d"", 'seen', 'perform', 'nice', 'change', 'see', 'usually', 'easily', 'befuddled', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'actually', 'running', 'rings', 'rest', 'cast.As', 'DVD', 'extras', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'feature', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'deciding', 'factor', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'not', 'included', 'documentary', 'CARY', 'GRANT', 'ON', 'FILM', 'BIOGRAPHY', '28', 'minutes', 'long', 'mainly', 'random', 'trailers', 'span', 'Grant', 'entire', 'film', 'career', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'not', 'terribly', 'riveting', 'introductory', 'remarks', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'are', 'bizarrely', 'entertaining', 'always', 'film', 'Spanish', 'Japanese', 'Chinese', 'subtitles', 'not', 'include', 'option', 'English', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'end', 'not', 'extras', 'should', 'be', 'buying', 'disc', 'wonderful', 'film', 'packaged', 'Kick', 'back', 'relax', 'watch', 'dialog', 'fly', 'screen', ""'ll"", 'want', 'keep', 'remote', 'control', 'so', 'can', 'rewind', 'catch', 'great', 'moments', 'missed', 'laughing']",His Girl Friday

Transfer quality of these is usually fair to good, at best.HIS GIRL FRIDAY is an energetic remake of the MacArthur/Hecht play ""The Front Page,"" with Rosalind Russell as star reporter Hildy Johnson and Cary Grant playing her boss and ex-husband, Walter Burns. Hildy's plans to quit her job, remarry and move elsewhere are put on hold so she can work on the hottest story in years: the escape of a condemned prisoner. Meanwhile, Walter tries to figure a way to get his ex-wife and best employee back.Certainly the fastest-paced version of this comedy, its machine-gun speed dialogue often has three characters speaking simultaneously. With added whimsy from Grant's direct references to both Bellamy and himself (he mentions his own real name, Archie Leach). Having Walter and Hildy as a divorced couple is the smartest twist of all.

But there are some really bad, almost unviewable versions out there.  Fortunately, I chose the  right version, and it's a clean crisp image, tightly-focused sound -- a joy  throughout.  So if you want 'His Girl Friday', make sure you get the  Laserlight DVD version, complete with a Cary Grant biog documentary and an  unvelievably hokey intro from Tony Curtis on a bad day.  I got the  Laserlight disc from Amazon for around $7 -- the really bad dubs other  reviewers have complained about from other companies cost more! I've found  Laserlight transfers of old films are generally ok -- their cheapie  Hitchcock transfers of 'The Lady Vanishes' and 'The 39 Steps' are almost as  good as as Criterion in image, though pretty scratchy in sound. For a  budget label, they do a good job compared to the absolute garbage put out  by Madacy and others.  So remember -- 'His Girl Friday' has to be from  Laserlight or you're wasting your money and buying something totally  unviewable. And no, this is NOT a paid ad! Just trying to steer people  towards a good edition of a classic comedy.

463062,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,6305416192,Bob L,"[2, 2]","Right in the middle of one of the most successful three years anybody has ever had, Howard Hawks gave us his new and improved reworking of Ben Hecht's comedic play, The Front Page. He changed the title to His Girl Friday. It was sandwiched in between Only Angels Have Wings in 1939 and Sergeant York in 1941. This amazing string of five classics began with Bringing Up Baby in 1938 and wound up with my personal favorite, Ball of Fire in 1941. WOW, what a run!Bringing Up Baby and Only Angels Have Wings both starred the irresistible Cary Grant. He was probably the inspiration for Hawks' reworking. Grant owned the role of Walter Burns. It was a role that allowed him to ham to his heart's content. Burns is the freewheeling owner/editor of a big city newspaper that's at odds with its local government.Originally, the plot revolved around Burns trying to keep his star reporter, Hildebrand ""Hildy"" Johnson, from quitting his job to get married. Hawks made a brilliant revision turning Hildebrand into Hildegaard and made her Burns' ex. When she shows up at the paper Walter conceitedly thinks she's there to get her job back but she's actually there to tell him that she's going to live in Albany with her soon to be husband, the nebbish insurance agent Bruce Baldwin beautifully self-parodied by Ralph Bellamy. Walter, unwilling to see his ex and star reporter walk out on him, works the kind of magic only he can work. This results in one of the top ten American comedies of all time and one that can truly be called madcap.Hildy is realized in a frenetic performance by not the first nor second or even third choice, Rosalind Russell. Russell was borrowed from MGM after Jean Arthur turned the role down and for whatever reasons Irene Dunne and Claudette Colbert also didn't work out. One could only guess their ultimate choice would have been Kate Hepburn but RKO would probably never lend her out to play the part. The stars must have been aligned. Because she was their last choice, Russell played the part with a huge chip on her shoulder, which was just what the role needed. She was so miffed she even felt the script gave Grant the lion's share of good lines and injected her own prewritten adlibs to offset. This did not endear her to Grant and the two never worked together again but once again it worked toward the betterment of the film as this two giant talents rivaled to ""one up each other"" in scene after scene.Here is where Hawks developed his trademark style of layering dialog, making actors start their line before the other actors had finished their line. This wasn't the first time it was done but in His Girl Friday it was brought to the level of fine art. It was not only practiced by the stars but also perfectly played by the innumerable character actors. The core of pressroom actors did this so well they will always be thought of not as actors but reporters. The pacing is blindingly fast and rarely ever achieved again. The celebrated scene in Broadcast News pales by comparison.If you've haven't seen this American treasure, I envy you. I wish I could see for the first time again but I can attest to its ability to make you laugh even after twenty viewings.",5,He looks like that film actor,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,3193,"['Right', 'middle', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'three', 'years', 'anybody', 'ever', 'had', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'gave', 'new', 'improved', 'reworking', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'comedic', 'play', 'Front', 'Page', 'changed', 'title', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'was', 'sandwiched', 'Only', 'Angels', 'Have', 'Wings', '1939', 'Sergeant', 'York', '1941', 'amazing', 'string', 'five', 'classics', 'began', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', '1938', 'wound', 'up', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Ball', 'Fire', '1941', 'WOW', 'what', 'run', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'Only', 'Angels', 'Have', 'Wings', 'starred', 'irresistible', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'probably', 'inspiration', 'Hawks', 'reworking', 'Grant', 'owned', 'role', 'Walter', 'Burns', 'was', 'role', 'allowed', 'ham', 'heart', 'content', 'Burns', 'freewheeling', 'owner/editor', 'big', 'city', 'newspaper', 'odds', 'local', 'government.Originally', 'plot', 'revolved', 'Burns', 'trying', 'keep', 'star', 'reporter', 'Hildebrand', 'Hildy', 'Johnson', 'quitting', 'job', 'get', 'married', 'Hawks', 'made', 'brilliant', 'revision', 'turning', 'Hildebrand', 'Hildegaard', 'made', 'Burns', 'ex', 'When', 'up', 'paper', 'Walter', 'conceitedly', 'there', 'get', 'job', 'back', 'actually', 'there', 'tell', 'going', 'live', 'Albany', 'soon', 'be', 'husband', 'nebbish', 'insurance', 'agent', 'Bruce', 'Baldwin', 'beautifully', 'self-parodied', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Walter', 'unwilling', 'see', 'ex', 'star', 'reporter', 'walk', 'kind', 'magic', 'only', 'can', 'work', 'results', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'American', 'comedies', 'time', 'one', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'called', 'madcap.Hildy', 'realized', 'frenetic', 'performance', 'not', 'first', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'choice', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'Russell', 'was', 'borrowed', 'MGM', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'turned', 'role', 'down', 'reasons', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'One', 'could', 'only', 'guess', 'ultimate', 'choice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Kate', 'Hepburn', 'RKO', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'lend', 'out', 'play', 'part', 'stars', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'aligned', 'was', 'last', 'choice', 'Russell', 'played', 'part', 'huge', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'role', 'needed', 'was', 'so', 'miffed', 'even', 'felt', 'script', 'gave', 'Grant', 'lion', 'share', 'good', 'lines', 'injected', 'own', 'prewritten', 'adlibs', 'offset', 'did', 'not', 'endear', 'Grant', 'two', 'never', 'worked', 'together', 'again', 'once', 'again', 'worked', 'betterment', 'film', 'two', 'giant', 'talents', 'rivaled', 'one', 'up', 'other', 'scene', 'scene.Here', 'where', 'Hawks', 'developed', 'trademark', 'style', 'layering', 'dialog', 'making', 'actors', 'start', 'line', 'other', 'actors', 'had', 'finished', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'was', 'done', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'was', 'brought', 'level', 'fine', 'art', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'practiced', 'stars', 'also', 'perfectly', 'played', 'innumerable', 'character', 'actors', 'core', 'pressroom', 'actors', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'thought', 'not', 'actors', 'reporters', 'pacing', 'blindingly', 'fast', 'rarely', 'ever', 'achieved', 'again', 'celebrated', 'scene', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'pales', 'comparison.If', ""'ve"", 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'American', 'treasure', 'envy', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'again', 'can', 'attest', 'ability', 'make', 'even', 'twenty', 'viewings']",His Girl Friday

463066,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305416192,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 5]","With Howard Hawks in the director's chair and Cary Grant in the lead role, you're pretty much guaranteed to have a good time.  His Girl Friday isn't the first or last film adaptation of the 1928 play The Front Page, but it is easily the best.  This thing comes at you a mile a minute, with dialogue that starts out at break-neck speed and never slows down and more humorous moments than you can find time to laugh at.  It's an unusual romantic comedy, given the fact that Cary Grant's character is a little less than noble (he is a rather ruthless newspaper man, after all) and the nice guy in the picture is lucky to finish at all, but there's still something endearing about the whole relationship between Walter Burns (Grant) and his former ace reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell), who also happens to be his ex-wife (in earlier adaptations of the story, Hildy was just a darn good male reporter).  Hildy is due to get married in less than 24 hours, and Burns is desperate to win her back - for the newspaper as well as himself.  The big city proves most cooperative in his endeavors, with a corrupt sheriff and mayor getting set to hang a ""dangerous"" little man for murder in order to bolster their bids for reelection in three days.  And that's only the beginning of this screwball comedy story.  This battle of the sexes turns into one of the most impressive battles of wits the big screen has ever seen, and the whole wild and crazy story makes for an extraordinary experience.Grant and Russell demonstrate remarkable chemistry together, which is a necessity given the fact that their characters are divorced and know each other's ways so well.  Poor Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), Hildy's mild-manner fianc&eacute;, is overwhelmed by the charm and manipulations of the remarkable Walter Burns.  Even Hildy falls prey to his spontaneously elaborate schemes, finding herself agreeing to do one last story before leaving the newspaper business for good.  That story, about a timid little man guilty of shooting a policeman whose forthcoming execution is being exploited as a triumph of law and order over anarchists and Reds, explodes in the hours leading up to the scheduled hanging, as the murderer escapes and ultimately provides the paper with a scoop that even the imaginative Burns could hardly have engineered on his own.I could try to describe the story in more detail, but there's little purpose in doing so.  His Girl Friday is all about the dialogue.  There are more words spoken during this ninety-minute film than you will find in any handful of other motion pictures.  Grant and Russell really are remarkable, as most scenes go on for many minutes without either actor breaking stride.  All of the minor characters jump in and out at the same unstoppable pace, and many are the times multiple characters are speaking to different people simultaneously.  This is nothing less than an elaborate circus of vocalization, and it is all you as the viewer can do to keep up with everything that is going on.  Burns and Hildy may have little time to think, but that doesn't stop them from unleashing words of great wit, innuendo, sarcasm, comic genius, and even a couple of in-jokes one on top of the other.  Meanwhile, the script becomes much more complicated than I expected, as the murderer awaiting the gallows escapes, the corruption of the police and local government is made manifest, a woman tries to kill herself, and Hildy's husband-to-be and his mother find themselves victimized by Burns' ruthless schemes to keep Hildy right where she belongs.His Girl Friday is an inspired example of moviemaking at its best, a classic that demands multiple viewings and loses none of its edge over the ensuing decades since its 1940 release.  Not only is the film a real hoot to watch, it's a strange sort of pleasure to sit back and enjoy a host of extraordinary actors performing at the very tops of their games.  It takes accomplished actors to handle the intensity and sheer volume of dialogue that defines this film.

The story has not dated and the film contains some of the fastest dialogue put on celluloid.Cary Grant plays the editor of the paper and Rosalind Russell, his star reporter and in this version, his ex-wife. Part of the reason that Russell seems so modern is that her part was originally a male role. By switching reporter Hildy Johnson to a female, the director, Howard Hawks, introduced sex and issues such as women competing in a male world and career versus private life, still relevant today. The depiction of the press is also still spot on. Grant's character is actually very unlikeable, a real creep, so there is nothing sentimental here. Special mention too of Ralph Bellamy, Russell's fiance, giving an hilarious portrayal of a hick as he did in ""The Awful Truth"".This DVD copy of the film contains an excellent print but there are no extras included.

Cinematography by Joseph Walker.Editing by Gene Havlick. Distributed by Columbia Pictures.American screwball comedy: A newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter ex-wife from remarrying. The change in this version is that the role of Hildy Johnson was converted from male to female.His Girl Friday was originally supposed to be a straightforward adaptation of The Front Page, with both the editor and reporter being men. But during auditions, Howard Hawks's secretary read reporter Hildy Johnson's lines. Hawks liked the way the dialogue sounded coming from a woman, resulting in the script being rewritten to make Hildy female and the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns. Most of the original dialogue and all of the characters' names (with the exception of Bruce Baldwin, Hildy's fiance, who was of course a woman in the play) were left the same.Hawks had a very difficult time casting this film. While the choice of Cary Grant was almost instantaneous, the casting of Hildy was a far more extended process. Hawks finally turned to Rosalind Russell, who was annoyed that she was not his first choice. During filming, Russell noticed that Hawks treated her like an also-ran, so she confronted him: ""You don't want me, do you? Well, you're stuck with me, so you might as well make the most of it.""The film is noted for its rapid-fire repartee, using overlapping dialogue to make conversations sound more realistic, with one character speaking before another finishes. Although overlapping dialog is specified and cued in the 1928 play script by Hecht and MacArthur. Grant's character describes Bellamy's character by saying ""He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know...Ralph Bellamy!"" According to Bellamy, the remark was ad libbed by Grant. Columbia studio head Harry Cohn thought it was too cheeky and ordered it removed, but Hawks insisted that it stay. Grant makes several other ""inside"" remarks in the film.205us - His Girl Friday (Howard Hawks, 1940, 92') -Fast, with very good acting - 3/11/2012",4,"Fast, with very good acting",1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,2308,"['Girl', 'Friday', 'Howard', 'Hawks', '1940', '92', '205us', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Howard', 'Hawks', '1940', '92', 'Produced', 'Howard', 'Hawks.Written', 'Charles', 'Lederer', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'Charles', 'MacArthur.Starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'Gene', 'Lockhart.Music', 'Sidney', 'Cutner', 'Felix', 'Mills', 'Cinematography', 'Joseph', 'Walker.Editing', 'Gene', 'Havlick', 'Distributed', 'Columbia', 'Pictures.American', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'trick', 'book', 'keep', 'ace', 'reporter', 'ex-wife', 'remarrying', 'change', 'version', 'role', 'Hildy', 'Johnson', 'was', 'converted', 'male', 'female.His', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'straightforward', 'adaptation', 'Front', 'Page', 'editor', 'reporter', 'being', 'men', 'auditions', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'secretary', 'read', 'reporter', 'Hildy', 'Johnson', 'lines', 'Hawks', 'liked', 'way', 'dialogue', 'sounded', 'coming', 'woman', 'resulting', 'script', 'being', 'rewritten', 'make', 'Hildy', 'female', 'ex-wife', 'editor', 'Walter', 'Burns', 'Most', 'original', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'names', 'exception', 'Bruce', 'Baldwin', 'Hildy', 'fiance', 'who', 'was', 'course', 'woman', 'play', 'were', 'left', 'same.Hawks', 'had', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'casting', 'film', 'choice', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'was', 'almost', 'instantaneous', 'casting', 'Hildy', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'extended', 'process', 'Hawks', 'finally', 'turned', 'Rosalind', 'Russell', 'who', 'was', 'annoyed', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'choice', 'filming', 'Russell', 'noticed', 'Hawks', 'treated', 'also-ran', 'confronted', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'Well', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'make', 'most', 'film', 'noted', 'rapid-fire', 'repartee', 'using', 'overlapping', 'dialogue', 'make', 'conversations', 'sound', 'more', 'realistic', 'one', 'character', 'speaking', 'finishes', 'overlapping', 'dialog', 'specified', 'cued', '1928', 'play', 'script', 'Hecht', 'MacArthur', 'Grant', 'character', 'Bellamy', 'character', 'saying', 'fellow', 'movies', 'know', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'According', 'Bellamy', 'remark', 'was', 'ad', 'libbed', 'Grant', 'Columbia', 'studio', 'head', 'Harry', 'Cohn', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'cheeky', 'ordered', 'removed', 'Hawks', 'insisted', 'stay', 'Grant', 'several', 'other', 'remarks', 'film.205us', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Howard', 'Hawks', '1940', '92', '-Fast', 'very', 'good', 'acting', '3/11/2012']",His Girl Friday

Take your [$$$] version out into the street and drag it along the nearest gravel road.  Now watch it.  Notice any difference?  Didn't think so?Second, I'm sure someone will say that this Marx Bros. movie is funnier or that Billy Wilder movie is funnier, but this is (in my mind) the funniest movie ever.  Timing is everything in screwball comedies and this one is nearly perfect in its timing.  ""How could you break up our home like that?""  ""What home?""  Don't you remember the home I promised you?"" all at breakneck speed.  And then when Hilde is interviewing Earl Williams it is much slower.  His ""Oh, I don't smoke"" is very pathetic and induces sympathy in the viewer even though its pretty hard to defend his actions.  Brilliant!Ralph Bellamy is also good as the sweet, but unexciting Bruce Baldwin.  Watch Cary Grant's face as Bellamy delivers the line ""So, Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?"".  Its priceless and gives me a laugh every single time I see it.The audio track by Todd McCarthy is fairly insightful.  The best stories are those about Rosalind Russell hiring an adman to write better lines for her and the producers wanting to cut Cary Grant's ad-lib ""He looks like that fellow from the movies, what's-his-name, Ralph Bellamy."" because it was insolent.  Thank God better sense prevailed.  I think that might be the first movie ""in-joke"" followed by Grant's ""Archie Leach"" gag.The documentaries are good, but don't really reveal too much.  I was interested to hear that Jean Arthur was originally offered the part but turned it down.  I always thought she would be perfect.

463078,A14XUCN5OC998O,6305416192,"Dusty White ""Advanced Tarot Secrets author an...","[6, 6]","This movie reminds us what movies used to be: fun.Carey Grant is handsome and debonair (and all that stuff that drove women crazy) and downright evil sometimes in this movie. He is not above twisting arms (men or women's) to get what he wants and needs, but he does it with such charm that most people just follow him. This is a lesson in alpha-male behavior 101. I won't reveal the storyline or any spoilers (I am sure someone has already done that), but instead I ill say that the movie reeks of another era, which wasn't that long ago chronologically. The witty banter and seemingly endless conflict between the main characters drives the movie forward like a roller coaster that threatens to come off of the tracks at any moment.This is Howard Hawks' brilliance. The director, the actors, even the lighting all work together seamlessly to create this film. The truest beauty of this film I believe was not the way that Hawks was able to entertain men and women equally in this truly romantic comedy (as compared to the trash that passes for ""romantic crap (oops! I mean 'comedy')"" today. It was the way this and other films laid down archetypes to aspire to. Cary Grant wasn't just a good looking guy with money - he was a good looking guy with money and a demonic bent and a razor-sharp tongue that he coated with just enough charm to make the poison work all the better. He had an iron will and was Hell bent on getting his way, and not looking like the bad guy in the process. His counterpart, ""Hildy Johnson"" was his intellectual equal and very sexy, and independent as well. Not the type of woman you would ever get tired of - or bored with.With characters like this on screen, it became all to easy to imagine that people like that existed somewhere, and that you might get lucky enough to snag one. The characters in this film were not as flat and 2-dimensional as many of the films today, and that is why it stands up so well even though it is shot in black and white, and the actors are long deceased.

463079,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6305416192,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Howard Hawks was responsible for a lot of outstanding movies, like ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Bringing Up Baby.""But one of his best was wild, witty screwball comedy ""His Girl Friday,"" which has never quite gotten the same recognition as those better known films. It has razor-sharp, bullet-fast dialogue, a hilarious plot and Cary Grant as (once more) a divorced man who won't give up so easily. You'll never look at a rolltop desk the same way again.Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) comes into her ex-husband's newspaper office. Walter (Cary Grant) is ready to give her her old job -- until she announces that she's marrying a nice, dull insurance agent (Ralph Bellamy). Walter insists that Hildy can't just go to Albany and be a housewife, and she insists that that's exactly what she wants.So the wily ex bribes Hildy to cover a sensational cop-killing case -- the convicted man is scheduled to be executed in the morning -- and takes the opportunity to make life difficult for her fiancee. Now Hildy tries to get the facts behind the cop-shooting, while battling with a corrupt mayor who wants the convicted man dead. Is the sordid world of journalism -- and Walter -- what Hildy really wants? Looks like it.Sometimes even if people don't get along, they fit so perfectly that trying to get together with someone else is pointless -- just look at Shakespeare's Beatrice and Benedick. Personally I've never experienced that kind of love (yet), but I've seen couples who do work the way Hildy and Walter do. Howard Hawks captures the feel of such couples perfectly.In addition to the screwball romance, Hawks mixes in a cop-killing, a prison break, an attempted suicide, a conspiracy for mayoral votes, and a lot of reporters slavering for a hit story. It's a tight, taut little story peppered with humor, like the convict in the roll-top desk, or Bellamy's imperious mother being dragged out of the building.Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell have electric chemistry in this movie, from the first scene right to the finale. It's a shame that they apparently didn't collaborate on any other movies, because in terms of comedy skill, they fit as snugly as two pieces of a puzzle -- they jabber together, trade fast barbs, and lob insults that don't pierce each other's skin.Their dialogue is as fast as their wits: ""I wish you hadn't done that, Hildy."" ""Done what?"" ""Divorced me. It makes a man feel he's not wanted!"" And on the sidelines, Bellamy has an amusing role as the rather slow-witted fiancee whom Grant charms and then gets arrested. Interestingly, Bellamy played the same role in ""Awful Truth,"" another Grant movie about a divorced guy trying to win his ex-wife...""His Girl Friday"" is one of those classic movies that leaves you with a warm glow and a cynical chuckle.

Although several movies were made based on the hit play The Front Page, a sarcastic comedy about the newspaper business, none was as successful or is as hilarious as His Girl Friday.Made by expert director Howard Hawks, His Girl Friday is one of the most entertaining and hilarious films ever! The film was the first to use overlapping dialogue, and it is probably the fastest talking film in history! It can be watched again and again, because every time you find new things to laugh about that you missed the last time!The cast is fantastic as well. Cary Grant, especially, though usually very good, gives one of his best performances in His Girl Friday as the amoral and manipulative newpaper editor Walter Burns. He is spectacular! Every scene he is in is hilarious because of his funny expressions and clever way of saying his lines. He also contributes greatly to the film by several &quot;in jokes&quot;, such as the Archie Leach line and the part in which he describes Ralph Bellamy's character as looking like &quot;uhh..that fellow in the movies..you know, Ralph Bellamy.&quot;Rosalind Russell is excellent as well as Hildy Johnson, the star reporter who wants to quit, and she and Cary make a wonderfully spunky pair! Ralph Bellamy does a good job with his role as Hildy's fiancee, the bumbling insurance guy. The rest of the cast is just as good.Anyhow, this movie is a must have!

463083,A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,6305416192,Frederick Baptist,"[1, 2]","Unlike your earlier screwball comedy movies, this one has a little dark edge to it as it covers issues such as the death penalty for innocent people and police and government corruption.  For its time, it was also unique in that the female lead was treated somewhat as an equal with her other male colleagues which we take for granted today but was unheard of in 1940.  As far as screwball comedies go, I wouldn't call this the best one I've seen as that accolade would have to go to ""My Man Godfrey"" or perhaps ""The Thin Man"" but this movie while not coming close to the standard of these two is still entertaining.The problem with this DVD though is the poor video quality although the sound quality isn't that bad if you have a system with Dolby Pro Logic which simulates surround sound and yet the hissing is still noticeable.  The picture quality is riddled with imperfections and it may be a good idea to wait for a properly restored version to come out or maybe Blu-Ray?  The Biography - Cary Grant On Film was entertaining but it isn't the best biopic on the man that I've seen.  For that you would have to see the special features for the 2-Disc version of ""Bringing Up Baby"" which by the way is also a much better movie than this one.  The jokes on ""His Girl Friday"" while they may have been funny 68 years ago have not aged very well and despite the quick dialogue, I guess living in this extremely fast paced society today, I didn't think it was that extraordinary either.

Hawks decided to give the film a fast pacing; many times Grant & Russell (among others) are all talking at the same time. His Girl Friday was one of the first films to take this approach.

The title always made me think Cary Grant was a businessman and Rosalind Russell his secretary. Far from it. Grant is Walter Burns and he runs a newspaper. Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) is not only his ex-wife but his star reporter. No one can cover a story better than Hildy.Hildy shows up to announce she is leaving town to marry a man a mild-mannered Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) with a domineering wife. Her reporting days will give way to a life as a housewife. Of course, no one can believe that Hildy will be satisfied away from her reporting days.I had recently seen THE AWFUL TRUTH and was immediately reminded of the similarities. Grant again is an annoying, lout with a mouth that keeps running. In that film his soon to be ex-wife is going to marry a mild-mannered man with a domineering mother AGAIN played by Ralph Bellamy. Fortunately, the similarities end there. Enter Rosalind Russell as the dedicated reporter about to give up her career to be Mrs. Bruce Baldwin. Hildy Johnson is a strong character who is well aware of  Burns's less than honorable scruples that keep ending Bruce in jail.The film seemed so to start and then I began to see the charm in the story. The crispt, fast-pace dialogue that sometimes never seems to end. Grant seems to always be talking over another character and we all know people like this. Hildy is tricked into covering one last story-a convicted murdered is about to be executed. There is hope of a reprieve. Hildy and the other reporters are at the prison in a room that overlooks the execution site. Things don't go as planned and Hildy becomes much more involved that she ever expects.Here is a fine film where the female lead is a strong and strong character. She holds her on against the charms of Cary Grant and he allows her to be independent and actually appreciates her talents as a reporter. Of course, it seems like a career woman of the 30's and 40's can never go out in public without an elaborate hat. Those were the days, I guess! The hats are another charm of this film.Don't miss a couple of subtle comedic lines in the film. Grant is one the phone and mentions a thug called Arhcie Leach (His real name). He is later asked to describe Bruce Baldwin (played by Ralph Bellamy) and describes him as a looking like that famous actor Bruce Bellamy. Nice humorous touch.I always think of Howard Hawks as a director of action films. Here he showed his talents in a romantic comedy. The story we changed from the original FRONT PAGE version. Hildy not only is a woman this time but she is the boss's ex-wife. The film is a total charmer and I can clearly see why it is so well respected and beloved.

In particular the sound was badly degraded, with a hiss that made  it difficult to understand the dialog towards the beginning (that improved  somewhat, but it was still bad).

Because of those theatrical roots, there is an atmosphere here at work that is seldom seen in movies today. You will never see more characters on screen at the same time trying to talk over each other. You have to see the movie numerous times to catch all the witicisms, so imagine how the play must have been. Cary Grant is perfect in this role, and really gets to play the center of the universe of this film. Rosalind Russell plays a great star reporter/ex-wife to Grant, the editor of a newspaper. The swarm of other characters that revolve around these two are perfect, fiancees, future mother-in-laws, reporters, civil servants. Years Later, in the fifties, Jack Lemmon and the late great Walter Mathau tried to remake this film, obviously without the romantic undertones. They may have been the only two with enough screen chemistry to even attempt this recreation.

A perfect example of the quick witted humor of the 30s,  before there were cell phones and everything was abbreviated.clever and fun repartee,  though a bit overwhelming at times.  The actors seem to know they are cute... but except for those moments Miss Russell hits the mark and sets the standard for the hard nosed new woman of the 30's. ( pre war 40s..)The story...  divorced couple still in love,  but she is heading for the suburbs with an unsuspecting protestant insurance salesman,  and He,  the editor of a newspaper,  is not about to let her go without a fight.  He tricks and maimsand upsets the happy apple cart,  using characters of unsavory remark,  and employing every dirty trick to exhaust the husband ( and his mother)  before they can board that train for HappyeverAfterville..  Meanwhile someones life is at stake,a man has murdered a policeman.  Here is where the story takes on an unexpected complexity.  This mild mannered unemployed sadsack has not only shot a policeman - but a black policeman - they emphasize - and you know what thatmeans.  Liberals will be lining up to have him killed. Why?  To keep the black - I mean 'colored' vote.  Colored in these decades was a term used by hipper white folks who,  while surely racists,  did not want to be so.  It felt the least degrading.So you hear a complaint about a black man who has been killed and a white man who will be killed in return - because he is black!  and you know how we aren't allowing any black folks to get killed right now.  I mean it goes by sofast but it,  while maybe appearing to be honest,  is downright racist and frightenly so.  Then the socialist stuff.  This out of work killer would just walk around in the rain in the park,  he was hungry,  sad, lonely.  He'd been fired aftera lifetime.  And he hears a speech about everything must have a use.  And then he has the gun in his hand and...  IT seems that there was probably a lot of socialize propaganda going on at the time,  i get that impression by the easyreference to things that no longer seem clear.  So I like this complexity,  especially since on the surface it just seems to be a comedy of no particular merit except for the fabulous rhythm of the writing and the beautiful spirits of Rosalind Russelland Cary Grant.Culmination-  the news room above the gallows...with the various scribes,  their phones and their garters,  who care about no one and nothing but the story,  playing cards waiting for the execution.  Our lady journalists stops byand so does the lady witness who had tried to do the poor sap a good turn and take him in...only to be slandered in the press  by mocking innuendo.  The sad,  tiny killer hiding in the rolltop desk,  an effeminate writer who, when he offers to come to her wedding Russell quips  ( you can be the bridesmaid..) and the irascible orchestrator of this rondo,  Cary Grant,  handsome enough to carry the scene when the dialogue is to exhausting to stay with.  All this goes by without blinking an eye, no reactions,  just hit after hit,  its operatic,  really..  Then enters the ignoramous messenger and the corruption is revealed..... A  Capra-esque stew of Shakespear proportions written in the gritty street style of the 30's.  I lovethis movie.

Reporters who had seen it all--many, many times--covered Prohibition-era beer wars, gangsters several times bigger than life, crooked politicians, lurid scandals of every conceivable stripe, Red scares, repeated labor strife, mesmerizing mouthpieces who reduced juries to tears in order to save thrill killers from their justly deserved dates with public executioners, and any other mad things that turned up by land, sea or air.  The pop culture of the day was fascinated by it all and two contemporary plays survive into our time to remind us of those hard-charging times: ""Chicago"" and ""The Front Page.""  ""Chicago,"" of course, was a hit play, that became a hit movie (and advanced the career of Ginger Rogers), that became a hit Broadway musical, that became a hit retro-movie musical.""The Front Page"" was an even bigger hit on stage in its first go-around.  It was written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur who had served time in the news bullpen at the Chicago City Hall and had finally escaped to write for other venues that were no more respectable but paid a whole lot more money.  Their subject was Hildy Johnson, a reporter on his last day in the bullpen before escaping into the real world and his boss Walter Burns, an amalgamation of every editor who'd ever run a beady eye over Hecht and MacArthur's deathless prose.  I should point out that Hildy Johnson in the play is a man.  The reason for that is ... well, because there actually was a Hildy (short for Hilding) Johnson who happened to be a bullpen reporter at the Chicago City Hall.  Whatever inclination (if such a thing ever entered their minds at all) that Hecht and MacArthur had to make Hildy Johnson a woman would have promptly fallen by the wayside because the two authors were aware that the real Hildy Johnson would be in the theater on opening night to observe the antics of the fictional Hildy on stage.  By all accounts, the real Hildy was a large and formidable Swede, not at all someone H&Mac; wished to annoy.In very short order, the play was faithfully transferred to the movie screen with Pat O'Brien as Hildy and dapper Adolph Menjou as Walter Burns.  That film is largely forgotten today, but is well worth watching.  It was the first major film of the talkie era in which the old fluid movement of the silent film camera was re-attained.  Menjou and O'Brien are both terrific.More than a decade later, a geologic era of Hollywood time, Howard Hawks set himself to the task of making a remake.  He hired Charles Lederer, yet another raffish writer, to make a 1940-ish screenplay out of the 1928 play.  He, or Lederer, or both simultaneously succumbed to the psycho-magnetic pull of that name, Hildy.  They subjected Johnson to a gender transformation ... which changed the relationship between Burns and Johnson from Mephistopheles and Faust to lovers-separated ... which allowed for the importation of a new character as the temporary impediment to the course of true love ... which yielded a magnificent screenplay that maintained all the cynical energy of the original, but in the context of a romantic comedy.In the apportioning of credit, so far, I would put writer Lederer far ahead of director Hawks.  Hawks racks up points for casting Cary Grant in the unaccustomed role of an authority figure, for casting Roz Russell who was perfectly capable of going toe-to-toe with Grant and always giving as good as she got, and for tossing in the wonderful, but still under-appreciated Ralph Bellamy as hilarious ballast to keep everything on course.Hawks did one more thing.  He rehearsed each scene in long takes, again and again, until the rapid, overlapping rhythm of the words was ingrained in the performers.  Then, and only then, did he shoot it.This film is a masterpiece for its screenplay, for its performers down to the smallest parts (a perfect, Big Studio-era repertory company of players), for Hawks' masterful direction.  Sheesh, what more could you want?  Of course it's worth five stars!",5,"Breathless take on old-style Chicago news hounds with Grant, Russell and Bellamy",1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,4888,"['95th', 'review', 'appear', 'here',

This is a good movie, no question about it.  But why do people go overboard about good old movies and act as if they are better than all the rest?Watch this one and then watch The Lady Eve starring Barbara Stanwyck.  There are some excellent lines here, and the plot is a good one, but The Lady Eve is far superior.  People say that this movie is smart, and it is, but The Lady Eve is a lot smarter, has a lot more heart, and is just much better.There's something tinny about this.  About Cary Grant's character, always bs'ing everyone.  About all the fast talking.  There are a few scenes during which I was thinking that the director hurried the actors through their lines to the point where it was not believable.  People do have to think before they can speak.  Some of these frenetic scenes are rushed through.  Others sustain the fast pace very well.The characters played by Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda in The Lady Eve are genuinely adorable.  The same can't be said here.  Cary Grant is a lot to take, in this movie, and Hildy isn't a heart throb either.  There's more appeal and more heart in The Lady Eve.It is unfair to compare any film to the Stanwyck-Fonda classic, but the other reviews on this site force me to it, because they make the inaccurate claim that His Girl Friday is one of the best movies ever made.  I'm pointing you to a movie that really is, as opposed to this one.This movie has some great laughs though.  A few of the throwaway lines really got me.  I like when Cary Grant opens the rollup desk in which the killer is hiding and calls him a mock turtle, or whatever he calls him.There's a bit of silliness early on when Cary Grant looks at his rival, the insurance salesman from Albany, and says he looks like Ralph Bellamy.  That's cute, considering that he is being played by Ralph Bellamy.  Talk about taking away the fourth wall.This is a good movie, but one of my pet peeves is just how often reviewers will call every good old movie one of the greatest of all time.

With a great cast, a suspense-busting story, and possibly the cleverest and certainly the fastest and most perfectly timed dialog of any movie ever made, this is a timeless and great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age.The movie reprises the famous Ben Hecht play from 1928, The Front Page, which some considered to have had the best dialog ever written for the American stage, but with one important change. Director Howard Hawks had the idea of changing the male reporter's role to that of a woman, which brilliantly set the stage for the romantic comedy of this movie.The rapid fire dialog of the movie deserves at least a brief comment. As one other reviewer wrote here, Hawks shot the scenes in long takes many times until the dialog was perfect, and only then committed it to film. Grant and Russell were also given considerable latitude in ad-libbing the occasional line. In fact, I've heard that Russell felt she needed a little extra sparkle in her dialog and secretely engaged (unfortunately I don't recall who) another writer to provide some additional lines, which were left in the final cuts. Eventually Grant began to suspect Russell was up to something, and she was. :-)There's so much that goes by so fast in this movie that it's easy to miss something. My favorite is when Grant and Russell (who's still playing hard to get) are reminiscing about one of their previous capers--when they stole the stomach of a murder victim right off the autopsy table to get evidence for their story. :-)You'll also recognize dozens of character actors from the era in various roles. Most, except for Gene Lockhart, father of June Lockhart who many will remember from the 60s TV series, I didn't know the names of, but I've seen them pop up in many other movies from the period over the years. No doubt most of these people were under contract to various studios, and got used again and again in different movies.

The tale is about a newspaper editor, Cary Grant, who loses his wife and best journalist potentially to a bland insurance man, Ralph Bellamy, who is basically a complete and total wussbag when it comes to Rosalind Russel, the ex wife. Grant's character begins to try and sabotage the relationship by pulling Russel's character back into the newspaper game with a juicy story. Russel's character is resistant at first but later on you see she's in denial that getting married and having kids may not be the best choice for her. Rapidfire dialogue reigns supreme. Nice interplay between the two love interests as they finish lines for each other showing how well they know each other. Reporters have their fast talking sarcastic cynical dialogue as well.  Ironically Rosalind Russel was not a top choice for this role. She resented it during the production and actually hired her own script writer to do some of her own lines to make her a more active character.

463136,A16QODENBJVUI1,6305416192,Robert Moore,"[9, 10]","Of all the great directors in cinema history, Howard Hawks was easily the most versatile.  Think of a great director.  Any director.  Think of the kinds of films they directed?  No matter who you consider, at best they worked in two or three genres.  but Hawks turned to every conceivable genre with his cinematic mastery intact.  Had he worked in the 1970s or 1980s, he would probably have produced a great martial arts film.  Hawks made great war films, comedies, Westerns, gangster films, detective films, adventure films, musicals, and is even acknowledged to be the uncredited creative force behind THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE, the film that started the Sci-fi craze of the fifties.But in my mind, Hawks was first and foremost a director of screwball comedies.  He more or less invented the genre with his 1934 TWENTIETH CENTURY, and went on to direct BRINGING UP BABY, BALL OF FIRE, and lesser efforts like I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE and MONKEY BUSINESS.  But as much as I like TWENTIETH CENTURY and BRINGING UP BABY, my favorite Hawks comedy is easily HIS GIRL FRIDAY.This movie gets so many things right that it is difficult to begin isolating just a few of its excellencies.  You almost have to begin with the utterly breathtaking verbal interchanges between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell.  The script is heavily based on the great Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur play THE FRONT PAGE.  In becoming a comedy, many of the impressive social themes of the play become muted.  Fortunately, some of the racism of the play also is muted, though not eliminated (an unfortunate joke about a black woman giving birth is retained in the Hawks script and film).  But whatever is lost in seriousness is gained by in sheer comedic force and exuberance.  Which leads us back to Grant and Russell's verbal exchanges.  They are intense, quick, fast-paced, and almost manic.  This film may contain more words per minute than any other Hollywood has produced.  The pace is so rapid that in many spots the characters are intentionally tripping over the others' lines.  Frequently two and even three characters are talking at once.  But over and over again, the viewer is just stunned by the virtuosity of Grant and Russell.  It is difficult to imagine better comedic acting than this.The cast is almost impossible to overpraise.  All the way down to the top 15 or 20 characters, the casting is perfect.  Although Grant and Russell stand out, this is really an ensemble cast.  Ralph Bellamy is solid in his thankless but essential role as Rosalind Russell's fianc&eacute;.The movie also features some great in jokes.  I'll mention only three.  When Grant sends someone to give some (counterfeit) money to Bellamy's character, Grant is asked what he looks like.  He hesitates for only a fraction of a second before answering, &quot;He looks just like that movie fellow, Ralph Bellamy.&quot;  At another point, a frustrated Cary Grant threatens someone by saying, &quot;I'll do to you what I did to Archie Leech.&quot;  Archie Leech, was, of course, Cary Grant's real name.  When Earl Williams, who is hiding in a roll top desk, attempts to get out, Grant says, &quot;Get back in there, you old Mock Turtle.&quot;  Near the beginning of his career, Grant had played the part of the Mock Turtle (in heavy make up but singing his own song--most people are not aware that Grant had a pleasant light tenor and was quite at ease in musical comedy).Just a great comedy.  I would, however, like to caution people with the other reviewers to get only the Columbia version of the film.  This movie was in public domain for some time, and during that time a large number of execrable versions were produced.

463138,A3BSS2M2DPPV4T,6305416192,"""scotsladdie""","[2, 2]","One of my very favourites.  Howard Hawk's masterpiece is a culmination of the &quot;screwball&quot; comedy tradition of the thirties.  Here, it's the dialogue rather than the plot which gives this gem its distinction.  Roz Russell as Hildy turns the newsroom upside down as she throws her well-padded shoulders around.  She's a fast-talking dame who's accepted by the newsmen as &quot;one of the boys&quot;; she's  a fast talker with a quick retort for each and every wisecrack.  The character of Walter Burns is made-to-order for Grant.  Here, his stunts are verbal; his insults fly like daggers; the pace is somewhat frenzied, yet the film doesn't suffer from its weak thread of a plot.  Time dances frantically by; the comedy is copious and varied; the gags are rapid-fire.  The sarcastic banter between Hildy and Burns is the soul of the film. and it is this clever repartee that captures the audience.  HIS GIRL FRIDAY is a fast, furious classic version of the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur 1928 hit play &quot;The Front Page&quot;. This movie is a unique example of Hollywood's golden years of film-making. The dialogue is delivered at breakneck speed with overlapping and clever inside jokes throughout. Rosalind Russell is a most inspired choice for Hildy Johnson (originally the character was a man) and she makes the best of her new-found niche in films; she's irreplaceable. Cary Grant has never been better and he even got to use his real name (Archie Leach) in one of his lines.

Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[0, 0]","One of the finest examples of 1930s comedy, and an excellent adaptation of a story that has been told many times, *His Girl Friday* is Hollywood at its best. Perfectly pairing Grant and Russell with an excellent script by Charles Lederer, based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's 1931 play, *The Front Page*, it is the kind of studio magic that could occur when the powers-that-be assigned the best work to the best candidates. Grant, whom I found arrogant and repellant later in his career - not to mention redundant - is at his suave-and-smooth best here as Walter Burns, newspaper editor, with the perfect foil in Rosiland Russell. As Hildy Johnson, Burns' ex-wife, Russell plays was in the process of cutting her teeth developing characters like this. Hildy is the archetype that gave Russell her reputation as a fast-talking dame, with machine gun delivery, and a smart-mouthed answer for everything. Hildy is off to marry Bruce, played by Bellamy, but her ex, Walter, still needs her to be his star reporter and cover the execution of a convicted killer. Every early journalistic stereotype is in full force - from reporters who would stop at nothing to get their story, to the city editor with a visor and sleeve-garters. Gene Lockhart, Ernest Truex and Clarence Kolb are all in fine form, but even the finest supporting performances pale against Grant and Russell. They are both delightful in this stylish slapstick farce that had previously been filmed as *The Front Page* (and later, again as *The Front Page* in 1974, and as *Switching Channels*). It also spawned a slew of imitators, not the least of which was TV's *Moonlighting*. Screenwriter Lederer's scripts have a freshness even today - 1995 saw a remake of his script *Kiss Of Death* and 2001 brings us *Ocean's Eleven*, which Lederer wrote the script for in 1960.",5,Excellent 30s Comedy,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,1835,"['One', 'finest', 'examples', '1930s', 'comedy', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'many', 'times', '*His', 'Girl', 'Friday*', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'Perfectly', 'pairing', 'Grant', 'Russell', 'excellent', 'script', 'Charles', 'Lederer', 'based', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'Charles', 'MacArthur', '1931', 'play', '*The', 'Front', 'Page*', 'kind', 'studio', 'magic', 'could', 'occur', 'when', 'powers-that-be', 'assigned', 'best', 'work', 'best', 'candidates', 'Grant', 'whom', 'found', 'arrogant', 'repellant', 'later', 'career', 'not', 'mention', 'redundant', 'suave-and-smooth', 'best', 'here', 'Walter', 'Burns', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Rosiland', 'Russell', 'Hildy', 'Johnson', 'Burns', 'ex-wife', 'Russell', 'was', 'process', 'cutting', 'teeth', 'developing', 'characters', 'Hildy', 'archetype', 'gave', 'Russell', 'reputation', 'fast-talking', 'dame', 'machine', 'gun', 'delivery', 'smart-mouthed', 'answer', 'everything', 'Hildy', 'marry', 'Bruce', 'played', 'Bellamy', 'ex', 'Walter', 'still', 'be', 'star', 'reporter', 'cover', 'execution', 'convicted', 'killer', 'early', 'journalistic', 'stereotype', 'full', 'force', 'reporters', 'who', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'story', 'city', 'editor', 'visor', 'sleeve-garters', 'Gene', 'Lockhart', 'Ernest', 'Truex', 'Clarence', 'Kolb', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'even', 'finest', 'supporting', 'performances', 'pale', 'Grant', 'Russell', 'are', 'delightful', 'stylish', 'slapstick', 'farce', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'filmed', '*The', 'Front', 'Page*', 'later', 'again', '*The', 'Front', 'Page*', '1974', '*Switching', 'Channels*', 'also', 'spawned', 'slew', 'imitators', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'TV', '*Moonlighting*', 'Screenwriter', 'Lederer', 'scripts', 'have', 'freshness', 'even', 'today', '1995', 'saw', 'remake', 'script', '*Kiss', 'Death*', '2001', 'brings', '*Ocean', 'Eleven*', 'Lederer', 'wrote', 'script', '1960']",His Girl Friday

Yet, the quality ones like Howard Hawks' &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; not only are still remembered but still hold up remarkably well to this very day.  Watching Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant work their magic in this production is proof positive that good films will always remain good films regardless of their age.Reporter Hildy Johnson (Russell) plans to leave her job as a reporter in order to settle down with insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy).  However, Hildy's boss and former husband, Walter Burns (Grant), does not want to lose her so he offers her the juicy assignment of covering the upcoming hanging of convict Earl Williams (John Qualen) to get her to stick around.  Hildy accepts the job but gets more than she bargains for when she encounters the escaped Williams who takes refuge with her.&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; is, more than anything else, a showcase for Russell and Grant.  Given a wonderful script to work with, the two leads use their natural charisma to vividly bring to life their respective characters.  The art of the verbal quip is refined like never before here as Russell and Grant trade one-liners so deftly and so amusingly that you will be constantly smiling at their playful and witty exchanges.  &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; is also a reminder of just how rare it is to find a modern film that has the same type of sharp dialogue.  When the medium evolved to showcase spectacle over substance, less concern was directed toward the quality of a screenplay and countless films have suffered for it.

Instead of the bumbling buffoon that Grant usually plays, in HIS GIRL FRIDAY he plays Walter Burns, a fast-talking newspaper editor who writes for the people instead of the big business and political corporations that support it. Russell portrays Hildy, one of the best writers in the business and Burns' ex-wife. The verbal bombardment between the two is some of the best ever captured on film. Nevertheless, all that wit is spoken so naturally that it feels completely normal and ordinary.Howard Hawks was one of the best directors and made great films in all genres from Westerns to comedies to the fast-paced roller coaster that is HIS GIRL FRIDAY. Hawks made a lot of great films in his career, but HIS GIRL FRIDAY ranks as one of the top five Hawks films of all time.The movie is not only full of verbal intelligence, but it's full of action as well.

463152,A2ITPZOXVR7X6T,6305416192,Vinny,"[3, 4]","I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about concerning this  movie. This is a masterpiece of comedy and acting, way ahead of it's time.  The copy of this movie that I have seen on various TV stations is terrible,  however this is a Laserlight production DVD and the quality is excellent. I  think there is another version of this DVD by another company which maybe  what the other reviewers are talking about, I don't know. A very  sophisticated comedy, the dialogue between the actors is done the way real  people talk to one another, which is Howard Hawks' style. The characters  are very colorful. The story is basically about how a newspaper run by Cary  Grant is trying to stop the execution of a disturbed communist who murdered  a black police officer, this in 1940. They point out how the black vote is  very important to the politicians, all of whom are heels. The portrayal of  politics was very unique to Hollywood films of the time. Also Grant is  trying to persuade Rosalind Russell to do the story instead of running off  to Albany to marry that guy &quot;who looks like Ralph Bellamy&quot;.  Anyway if you know this film I reccommend it highly. Laserlight does a very  good job transferring this film to DVD, the TV versions are terrible. I  bought this film because I have bad VHS versions of it taped from TV and  figured for $7.99 it could only be better. I was surprised because I never  saw such an excellent copy of this movie. It is well worth it, I have other  Laserlight movies and they so far have been great transfers to DVD of old  classic films.

I am appalled that any business would put out such low quality at a premium price. However, I am so relieved at the good people who review DVD's on this site for the recommendation of the Columbia Classics version, which was remastered and shows some dignity and respect towards their audience.

463154,A3CFT5LHFCB46K,6305416192,"""weirdo_87""","[0, 6]","Based upon the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur play ""The Front Page"", ""His Girl Friday"" is one of the most terrific and enjoyable of screwball comedies, as well as a satire of the newspaper business (Which explains it lack of Oscars).Cary Grant is Walter Burns, the chief editor of the Morning Daily newspaper. He runs into trouble with his ex-wife ""Hildy"" Johnson (Rosalind Russell), who is also the best writer at the paper. Hildy tells Walter that she is moving to Albany and is getting married to an insurance man, Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). Thus, she's quitting her job. This comes at a bad time, for an innocent man named Earl Williams (John Qualen) has been charged with and will be hanged for murder. Walter seems to still love Hildy, and sure isn't going to loose his best writer. So he has her interview Williams and get a story on him to prove he isn't insane. Walter, however, has a plan behind this. He wants to delay the trip of Hildy and Bruce long enough to allow Hildy to reconsider her decision to leave the paper. Thus, he has Bruce put on the charge of stealing a watch. Hildy becomes so irate that she destroys her story and is about to depart when Earl Williams breaks out, causing a chain reaction of events that'll make Walter and Hildy feel as though they're in a tea kettle.Hildy Johnson's character in the original play was a man. Which might explain some of her not so lady like gestures and actions. There's ink flowing in her blood and Walter knows that. He knows that she was meant to be active and adventurous, not bogged down by figures and facts in an insurance office. But, it is also very likely that some of the things Walter does are out of love. He wants to make up for lost time that he didn't have with Hildy, like how their honeymoon was spoiled because they were trapped in a mine. Grant seems to be perfect for the role. But, though Russell was also a terrific choice, other actresses of the period (Katherine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, Myrna Loy) would have also been good choices. They would have presented the character differently though; they don't have newspaper ink flowing in their blood. Then again, what right do I have to complain? I'm a film buff, yes, but one who still needs more experience in screwball comedies.A fine supporting cast assists Grant and Russell. Bellamy replays a role that's similar to his in ""The Awful Truth"". Come to think of it, this movie is a lot like ""The Awful Truth"", at least with the bickering ex-lovers and with Bellamy's Bruce, like his Daniel in ""Awful Truth"", being loyal to his mother. Gene Lockhart (""Going My Way"") has some funny scenes as Sheriff Peter B. `Pinky', who inadvertently helps Earl Williams escape from prison (Which causes Hildy to say that the B means Brains). The newspaper reporters are all a cruel bunch: They published bad things about Earl Williams and smeared the name of his girlfriend, Molly Malloy (Helen Mack). They only spring into action when they hear a news lead that sounds interesting, such as a background check that shows Earl Williams failed a class in High School. Among this group includes Porter Hall, Cliff Edwards, Roscoe Karns, Frank Jenks, and Regis Toomey (There's also Ernest Truex as Roy Bensinger, a tribune reporter). Also in the supporting cast include Clarence Kold as the mayor who would hang his own mother to be reelected, Abner Biberman as Louis, a hood who seems to be a send up of ""Scarface"" Al Capone (Or at least as he was played by Paul Muni), Alma Kruger as Bruce's mother, who uncovers the hiding place of Williams, Pat Westas as Warden Cooley, Edwin Maxwell as Psychiatrist Dr. Egelhoffer and Billy Gilber as a messenger with news from the governor.Though it could be another item that makes this show great, the rapid, twisting plot may annoy some. Walter teams with Hildy, only to then double cross her by getting Bruce landed in jail. But not just once, oh no no. The poor guy goes there three times. It's like ""Come three times in one day and your next visit is free"" (That's right. All this occurs in about 12-18 hours). The ending I'll try not to spoil. But I will say that'll either make sense to you or just seem like another happy Hollywood ending (Or similar to endings of screwball comedies like ""It Happened One Night"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""The Awful Truth"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"").The VHS edition I saw this on was from the Goodtimes Video series ""Hollywood Movie Greats"" and is erroneously called a ""Collector's Edition."" Well, I guess if the collector wants a so-so print of the movie. The picture quality is clear for the most part, though some scenes are lighter or darker then others. One such scene is when one reporter asks for more light in the pressroom, saying that he can't see a thing. He must be blind because I could see fine. The sound is clear for the most part, though some scenes suddenly become louder for a few minutes and then tone down. A collector's edition should also have something like a theatrical trailer, or at least an advertisement for others in the collection. Fortunately, the movie has been put on DVD in an edition licensed by Columbia. I don't have it, but it should at least have better audio and video (Not to mention some extras).",4,His Girl Anyday,1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,5248,"['Based', 'Ben', 'Hecht', 'Charles',
