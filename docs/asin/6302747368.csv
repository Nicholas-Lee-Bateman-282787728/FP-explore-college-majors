Maybe if she was replaced by either Kathleen Turner or Sherilyn Fenn, the film would be a lot better than it was. The performances of the cast saved the film from being a complete dud. It's really the expert acting by Willem Dafoe, although showing zero chemistry with Madonna, that made Body of Evidence an interesting picture to watch. Probably the biggest issue of the film was the smell of a set-up from the get go. Perhaps it's Jurgen Prochnow's name in the opening credits as a dead giveaway. Obviously, from there on to the aftermath of the rendered verdict set up for the predictable outcome. The court case was rather silly. When the defendant elects to testify, that usually takes days to complete the process, not just mere minutes. On the other hand, I just couldn't help but feel the mastery in the direction in films such as Double Indemnity, Chinatown, and Body Heat. That's why Body of Evidence paled in comparison.

Objectively speaking, ""Body of Evidence"" HAS to be among the top five worst movies ever made.  The only sort of person who could ever tolerate sitting through it is the rabid Madonna fan.  I mean, I've seen it and yeah, I'm a fan of sorts, I'll admit it - but I can only take so much.  This flick is simply inexplicable as anything other than a bizarre mistake on the part of most everybody involved.*(*Then again, while Madonna as a rule is not a huge box-office draw, I'm sure anything with her name attached winds up selling big on video and DVD eventually, no matter how awful.)Poor Madonna.  It's not that we don't want her to do well.  It's not that we can't see how hard she's trying - it's that we CAN.  The girl never had an un-self-conscious moment in front of the camera in her life.  By the way, that's exactly why she is so magnetic in her proper medium, music video - that instant rapport is what made her a star.  ""Evita"" worked for her because it's basically a 2-hour highbrow music video.  But ""Body of Evidence,"" which is obviously Madonna's attempt at ""Basic Instinct,"" just makes her look foolish.  AGAIN.  At that point she was already a veteran of looking foolish on the silver screen.  And you know, good for her, she does what she wants, she takes risks, but her choices are so consistently, amazingly terrible that it's impossible to take her seriously as an actress.Who wrote this script?  I'm not hitting the back button to see if it says, I don't really care, but I mean, good night! - it's bad.  She kills the rich old guy by having-relations-with-him to death.  She's like a much leaner and supposedly much more savvy version of Anna-Nicole Smith.  Deviant S&M; behavior may have been involved, as well as cocaine - ""Basic Instinct"" motifs; except in this case the killer blond can't quite pull it off.  The dialogue's a mess; e.g. at one point somebody actually has Madonna tell her lawyer ""There's nothing wrong with admitting that you want me.""  Groan.  Nor does the ending make any sense, but by then who really gives a damn.  The kicker is that Madonna read the script and thought ""This sounds like a real gem.""But we can't blame it all on the script or her choice of it either.  If Madonna were a ""real actress"" - and it is more than evident that she is not - she would be able to breathe some sort of creative life into even such an abject piece of trash as this.  Sharon Stone did it for the otherwise ridiculous ""Basic Instinct;"" Linda Fiorentino for the otherwise laughable ""Last Seduction.""  ""Body of Evidence"" attempts to fit into this same neo-Noir spider-woman genre, but it fails quite miserably.  Not only that, but you have to watch Willem DaFoe having sex.SPOILER: She doesn't even get away with it in the end.  The good guys burn the witch.

But after seeing it, I'm still trying to figure out where the erotic and thrilling parts are. Oh yes, Madonna's in it, so be assured there's plenty of love-making. But the sex scenes(involving hot candle wax, broken glass, and handcuffs) aren't sexy, they're not even kinky. They're just plain creepy. The plot of the film, if it can be defined, concerns a sultry blonde(Miss M) who is accused of murdering her wealthy older lover with a weapon more lethal than a gun or knife, her body! Amazingly, a talented group of performers signed on for this sado-sexual mishmash, including Joe Mantegna, Anne Archer, Frank Langella, Jurgen Prochnow, and Julianne Moore, all of whom do their best to breathe some life into this dud. Willem Dafoe, also a good actor, is the most uncomfortably miscast of the bunch as Madonna's lawyer who is susceptible to his client's sultry charms. As for lady Madonna herself, she is the perfect choice for such a campy role. The part doesn't call for much more than removing clothing and heavy-breathing, and as long as the script she is given sticks to those aspects, then she is safe. But whenever she is called upon to do the slightest bit of serious emoting, it's embarrassing. This was most definitely THE low point in Miss M's acting career. She redeemed it, somewhat, a few years later with EVITA. Some people say that this is the worst of the mid-90's sex and murder yarns &quot;inspired&quot; by the 1992 mega-hit BASIC INSTINCT(itself, a vastly overrated film), but personally, I vote for the Bruce Willis/Jane March starrer COLOR OF NIGHT(1994).",2,Erotic thriller?,973987200,"11 12, 2000",2000,1671,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'theatres', 'was', 'promoted', ""'erotic"", 'thriller', 'seeing', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'erotic', 'thrilling', 'parts', 'are', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Madonna', 'so', 'be', 'assured', 'plenty', 'love-making', 'sex', 'scenes', 'involving', 'hot', 'candle', 'wax', 'broken', 'glass', 'handcuffs', 'are', ""n't"", 'sexy', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'kinky', ""'re"", 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'plot', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'defined', 'sultry', 'blonde', 'Miss', 'M', 'who', 'accused', 'murdering', 'wealthy', 'older', 'lover', 'weapon', 'more', 'lethal', 'gun', 'knife', 'body', 'Amazingly', 'talented', 'group', 'performers', 'signed', 'sado-sexual', 'mishmash', 'including', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'whom', 'do', 'best', 'breathe', 'life', 'dud', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'also', 'good', 'actor', 'most', 'uncomfortably', 'miscast', 'bunch', 'Madonna', 'lawyer', 'who', 'susceptible', 'client', 'sultry', 'charms', 'lady', 'Madonna', 'perfect', 'choice', 'campy', 'role', 'part', ""n't"", 'call', 'much', 'more', 'removing', 'clothing', 'heavy-breathing', 'as', 'long', 'script', 'given', 'sticks', 'aspects', 'then', 'safe', 'whenever', 'called', 'do', 'slightest', 'bit', 'serious', 'emoting', 'embarrassing', 'was', 'most', 'definitely', 'THE', 'low', 'point', 'Miss', 'M', 'acting', 'career', 'redeemed', 'somewhat', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'EVITA', 'people', 'say', 'worst', 'mid-90', 'sex', 'murder', 'yarns', 'quot', 'inspired', 'quot', '1992', 'mega-hit', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'film', 'personally', 'vote', 'Bruce', 'Willis/Jane', 'March', 'starrer', 'COLOR', 'OF', 'NIGHT', '1994']",N/A

Her role as a seductive and manipulative mystery novelist blew moviegoers away. No one had expected this obscure film genre to take off the way it had. It was no surprise that more films of this sort were released. However, a similar thriller titled Body of Evidence did not receive the same rave reviews and box office success as Basic Instinct. After all, Madonna playing a sexually aggressive seductress-slash-dominatrix was as unexpected as Arnold Schwarzenegger playing an action hero.

Released in 1993, Body Of Evidence capped off the Erotica CD/Sex book era of Madonna's career.Madonna portrays Rebecca Carson, gallery owner and s&m;/bondage fetishist. Her latest lover, a wealthy older man, dies suddenly of a heart attack and the prime suspect is Rebecca who is touted as being the 'murder weapon' herself.Body Of Evidence certainly contains many erotic moments - we have never seen Madonna so explicit as we do in this movie. Whilst her sexual prowess is above reproach, her acting here is also noteworthy. Madonna underplays the role here for character subtly. Only in the final few scenes do we see the true Rebecca. Madonna becomes better with every movie she makes and with Body Of Evidence we see a developing actress - her characterisation is believable and holds ones' interest.Is it a good movie???

It's also the murder weapon, the film's premise being that she murdered her lover by making invigorating love to him, causing the rich old guy to drop dead from excitement.  I suppose this could, and actually has, happened.  Then again I have an active imagination.At any rate we could also call this ""Madonna on top"" or ""Madonna in charge"" or maybe ""She can show you the power you can have from the prone position.""  One thing about Madonna, other than having no shame (and I admire her for that) is that she can crawl and not feel the slightest bit reduced.Another thing about Madonna is her unerring sense of how to appeal to her primary audience, namely young girls (now grown women).  During the height of her career a few years back Madonna was the woman most admired by teenaged and pre-teenaged girls.  (You could look it up, but just think of the song, &quot;Papa Don't Preach,&quot; or her role as the young free-spirit in Desperately Seeking Susan (1985).)  And you want to know why?  Because she was perceived as having it all: fame, fortune, personal freedom, the attention of the males, and, most important, she achieved her success through hard work and a certain audaciousness that suggests courage, the kind of unmitigated self-expression that most of us can only dream about.She's not especially bad in this mediocre thriller, nor especially good.  The script is ridiculous and the treatment without a hint of nuance or subtlety.  William Dafoe and Joe Mantegna seemed to be acting on rote and Anne Archer was, alas, a wash.  The problem is the movie is so obviously fake that it's like watching bad TV.  There's no point other than kinky sex.  I'm not sure why Madonna agreed to do this.  I can't believe she needed the money, nor can I believe she didn't care about her reputation as a performing artist.  I think she was seduced by the &quot;power over men&quot; fantasy of the script.

Interestingly, the Portland Historical Society allowed some filming done on the estate with the condition that Madonna not set foot in the house.  This movie is clearly Madonna's attempt to copy ""Basic Instinct"" and it is as wretched as  people have made it out to be. The three Oscar nominees in the cast: Willem Dafoe, Julianne Moore, and Anne Archer make the most of a terrible script and Ms. Archer looks as if she's embarrassed to be here. Frank Langella makes a brief cameo as one of Madonna's former lovers and his graphic descriptions of his sex life with Madonna would be disturbing if they were'nt delivered in such a campy, stilted manner.  Madonna and Defoe have no chemistry - in fact could Dafoe have chemistry with anyone ? The film is shot with a 1950's film noir look but Madonna is no Sharon Stone. She wiggles, she jiggles, she overdoes it in the moan department..she does everything except act. Whereas Ms. Stone played a killer in ""Basic Instinct"" who just happened to be a nymphomaniac, Madonna's emphasis is on nymphomaniac first and killer second.

The first is the murder itself. The second, subliminally but more overt as things progress, is about what the conservative mind would refer to (perhaps) as deviant sex: handcuffs, restraints and making love in a public place for example; in this case, a poorly lit multi-storey car park. As such, a serious argument is presented in favour of the non-conventional view of sex; one that is fun and exciting but of course, only when both parties agree. It is certainly a view I subscribe to and have written about. The verbal descriptions elicit reactions in court. The encounters between the main protagonists are strong (watch the uncensored version; mine had both on the one disk). What was particularly impressive was the acting of Madonna. I have never thought of her as an attractive woman in the conventional visual sense but she certainly conveys a predatory hunger in this movie.

331183,A2YQ5O6XV23543,6302747368,Kevin H. Dudley,"[26, 34]","Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.After the surprise success of 1992's controversial erotic thriller Basic Instinct, studios starting snatching up every similar script floating around in an attempt to cash in on that film's success. One of the most infamous attempts at ripping off Basic Instinct was the 1993 Madonna vehicle entitled Body of Evidence. Before the movie's initial theatrical release, there was a considerable buzz surrounding the movie's numerous explicit sex scenes between Madonna and a slumming Willem Dafoe. People were talking about how in-your-face these scenes were. There also were some rumors that some of the sex scenes weren't completely faked.But the movie ran into huge problems with the MPAA and almost all of the sex got cut out of the R-rated theatrical version. Regardless, the movie was pretty awful regardless and died a quick death at the box office. It also really hurt Madonna's credibility at that time and was viewed as severely damaging to her overall career. When it was released on video, MGM released it in both its R-rated version as well as an unrated cut that restored all of the explicit sex that had to be removed from the R version. (The unrated cut is the version that I'm basing my review on BTW).  It's also been rumored that the European cut is still even more explicit than even the unrated American cut but I haven't seen it to compare and sitting through this movie more than once might cause me irreperable brain damage.The plot involves Rebecca Carlson (Madonna) who has been accused of murdering her much older lover by deliberately having kinky sex with him despite his severe heart condition. Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) is a defense attorney who gets assigned to her case. He is married to Sharon (Julianne Moore) and has a son. Robert Garrett (Joe Mantegna) is the prosecutor. During the trial the highly flirtatious and kinky Rebecca begins to weave a spell over Frank and pretty soon he's having a torrid affair with her while the trial is still going on. He does a decent job keeping it from his wife for awhile , but naturally, she eventually finds out. There's also the deceased man's secretary Joanne (Anne Archer) who is convinced that Madonna killed him to get his riches but it turns out that Joanne may have been much closer to her employer than just working for him.The plot chugs along to a thoroughly predictable climax and mainly serves as a canvas for some surprisingly explicit and energetic (though about as far from erotic as you can get) simulated sex scenes. I'll admit that some of these scenes went quite a bit farther than I was expecting them to go (the scene in the parking garage where they do it on the hood of a car for instance). I'm really not sure how the director thought much of the sex footage would get past the MPAA relatively intact when he had a scene of a nude-from-the-waste-down Madonna literally sitting on Willem Dafoe's face (in fairly graphic detail) on the hood of his car while he performs oral sex on her. There is also the infamous scene of Madonna pouring hot candle wax all over Willem that in another movie with a much more convincing (and better) actress and director, it could have been very kinky and erotic. Here it just plays out as silly and unintentionally funny.The reason that this turkey is still worth checking out is that it is very clear that everyone involved wasn't taking this movie that seriously. A lot of the performances are extremely tongue in cheek. Not that it makes it any better mind you. But it's one of the most unintentionally funny movies that I've watched in quite some time. Madonna can't act to save her life, but a lot of her scenes had me laughing until I was in tears. Even though she displays an apparent willingness to let it all hang out, so to speak, she literally keeps just one expression on her face throughout practically the whole movie. Willem Dafoe fares a little better, as does the always lovely Julianne Moore (who also has a prettty explicit, but quick, sex scene with Willem Dafoe), but there's only so much you can do acting wise with characters and a plot as silly as this. The rest of the cast serves more or less as just filler and plays their characters just like the stereotypes that they are that normally populate erotic thrillers such as this.The film does boast some considerably better cinmatography and direction than the material required. Director Uli Edel apparently has a good eye for detail and mood, but all of his efforts are wasted in the nonstop parade of stupidity.I guess if you're a big fan of Madonna, the thought of seeing her nude and in some explicit sexual situations is reason enough to check this movie out. But I really haven't been able to stand her throughout most of her career and have always found her to be somewhat of a joke (singing or acting wise).While this movie strives way too hard to be Basic Instinct 2, what it forgot is that the reason that Basic Instinct worked was that it actually had a good script in addition to a lead actress in Sharon Stone who was unbelievably hot as well as being a great actress. Madonna doesn't look bad nude, in fact she has a pretty happening body. She does an ample amount of full frontal nudity throughout the film so fans take not. But at this point in her career she had made her living at flaunting herself at any and every opputunity and I had just gotten to the point where she doesn't do a thing for me, nude or otherwise. I've been extremely desensitized to her routine.This movie came close to being a career killer for all involved, but with the slew of similar erotic thrillers that were being dumped into thrillers around that point (Sliver, Jade) people just ended up forgetting about this movie. While I think that there's some entertainment value to be found in this movie (though it's all unintentional), a lot of people will find this movie thoroughly derivative and poorly made. But, I still recommend it to people since it is so silly and goofy. It's really good for a few laughs. (BTW if you are a fan of the now defunct show Mystery Science Theater 3000, this is an incredibly easy (and fun) movie to rip apart).The recent DVD released by MGM has both the unrated and rated versions of the film on either side of the disc. Most curiousity seekers will probably just stick with the unrated version for the extra nudity/sex. The movie is present in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen but the only extra is the theatrical trailer and an awful 8 minute featurette on the making of this awful but unintentionally hilarious film.Body of Evidence is unrated and contains explicit sexual content & nudity, graphic language and violence.The edited R rated version contains strong sexual content, nudity, strong language and

This is basically a rip-off of ""Basic Instinct"" without the benefit of anything that movie had to offer. The supporting actors here are wasted--- particularly Anne Archer who just re-hashes her role in ""Instinct"". Pity, because she CAN act. One gets the feeling that Madonna relishes the opportunities to exploit herself in the trashiest ways possible. Here, she plays a woman who literally kills her elderly husband with sex as a weapon. When asked what she does for a living on the witness stand, she tells them and it cannot be repeated here. That's probably the most convincing line she utters in the whole film. The sex scenes are played up with lighting and ambience but Madonna doesn't even do THEM very well and William Dafoe is just plain unattractive.

What gave me the heebie-jeebies about seeing this movie isn't so much to controversial sex scenes, but the fact that it was released shortly after BASIC INSTINCT, and the script worked seemlessly as a companion piece for it. What made it work though, was the courtroom scenes, as corny as they were.As a hard-headed lawyer Willem Dafoe's Frank Dulaney is the character who gets more personal taking your case than if you were the witness. It is demonstrated very effectively in the moments where Anne Archer is in the witness stand. Critique: Madonna's on trial for the murder of her wealthy older lover. After an evening's entertainment, he is found dead apparently had a bad heart. Seeing Madonna naked probably did the trick.....LOL! Dafoe inevitably falls for her, and the case twists and turns. Thus the screenplay ties the film together as a kaleidoscope with very little brilliant colors. Who's the blame? Director Uli Edel? Or the cameraman? There is one scene during Dafoe's opening deliberation where we notice a very attractive young girl in the jury. Are we supposed to believe, this gal will turn into a hero of the juries to help turn Madonna loose? Nope, she's just another citizen just trying to earn the extra dough.For Madonna fans this is a sure winner. Her character is the perfect vamp. Anybody would feel right at home in Portland. I know because I have been there myself and it is a beautiful city. As Madonna memorably points out while being interrogated by Joe Mantegna as the opposing attorney, ""Portland is a small city. I even dated a man who dated a woman you dated."" Clearly Dafoe has feelings for her when watching her pose naked beneath the balustrade. It probably made the fishermen in the area a little eerie as well. Her character and all the other characters have seemingly no morals or values. What does she dedicate her life to? She answers that in one of the funniest lines in the entire movie, which unfortunately cannot be printed here.True, Madonna is a very beautiful, very talented woman. So much so, she must have been offered a heck of a salary to take the part. Had she been any wiser, she would have refused it, and Sharon Stone or Meryl Streep may have gotten the role. Who knows. Maybe they refused it too. Think about it. The entire movie looks like it was filmed in a very short amount of time, on a very low budget, and written by a High School play director.

It's hard to view ""Body of Evidence"" even as a guilty pleasure--there's just way too much guilt.  Madonna plays a scheming, Betty Davis-esque golddigger (surprise) who destroys men by oversexing them with her body!  Willem Dafoe, the lawyer hired to defend her against charges of murdering her elderly, rich husband, may be her next target.  The story is so purile it makes ""The Days of Our Lives"" look like Shakespeare, and the film wastes just about every likable performer in it (including Joe Mantegna, Ann Archer and Dafoe).  Perhaps the biggest mistake is letting Madonna do more than be filmed without clothes--she delivers her lines about a beat too slow and often looks uncomfortable in her own skin.  (It doesn't help that Madonna often is made up to appear ten years older than she is--she looks hotter now in her music videos).

Resistibility is Madonna's salient quality as a film star.The plot of Body of Evidence, the most enjoyably awful of Madonna's awful movies, can be summed up in the words uttered by the pint-sized son of defense lawyer Willem Dafoe: ""Can you really screw someone to death?"" Yes, that's the very question the entire story of Body of Evidence revolves around. Madonna has been accused of murdering her fiance, an older man whose death by cocaine, handcuffs and rough sex came right after he made her the sole beneficiary of his $8 million estate. Going right to work in his job of defending Madonna, lawyer Dafoe scoffs at investigating cop Joe Mantegna: ""What are you going to do, tag her body as a murder weapon? It's not a crime to be a great lay."" Well, it may not be a crime to be a great lay, but if you're Madonna it is a crime to try to play one. Striving for the effortless, incendiary va-voom of Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice, Kim Novak in Vertigo or Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, Madonna comes off not as a blonde bombshell but a blonde bomb.When Dafoe tells Madonna that Mantegna is going to build his case on her predilection for violent, dirty sex, Madonna replies, ""It wasn't dirty! Have you ever seen animals make love? It's intense. It's violent. But they never really hurt each other."" To which Dafoe replies, ""We're not animals,"" whereupon Madonna counters, ""Yes, we are."" Well, some of us are. Soon, in the strangest come-on in movie history, a nude Madonna gets needles stuck into her behind by an acupuncturist while Dafoe watches, practically panting. In court, detective Mantegna presents his take on Madonna to the jury: ""She is the murder weapon itself. When this trial is over, you will see her no differently than a gun or a knife or any other instrument used as a weapon."" In short, an inanimate object. He does have that right. Prosecution witness Anne Archer, the secretary of the dead man, refers to Madonna as ""a cokehead slut."" Judge Lillian Lehman pipes up with one of our favorite Bad Movie lines ever: ""I cannot change the titillating nature of this trial, but if I had wanted to work in the circus, I would have learned how to ride a trapeze!""",5,MATERIAL GIRL MURDERS FILM CAREER - NO SURVIVORS!,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,2312,"[""'m"", 'hard', 'resist', 'wanton', 'art', 'gallery', 'owner', 'Madonna', '1993', 'flick', 'Body', 'Evidence', 'beg', 'differ', 'Resistibility', 'Madonna', 'salient', 'quality', 'film', 'star.The', 'plot', 'Body', 'Evidence', 'most', 'enjoyably', 'awful', 'Madonna', 'awful', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'words', 'uttered', 'pint-sized', 'son', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Can', 'really', 'screw', 'someone', 'death', 'Yes', 'very', 'question', 'entire', 'story', 'Body', 'Evidence', 'revolves', 'around', 'Madonna', 'been', 'accused', 'murdering', 'fiance', 'older', 'man', 'death', 'cocaine', 'handcuffs', 'rough', 'sex', 'came', 'right', 'made', 'sole', 'beneficiary', '8', 'million', 'estate', 'Going', 'right', 'work', 'job', 'defending', 'Madonna', 'lawyer', 'Dafoe', 'investigating', 'cop', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'tag', 'body', 'murder', 'weapon', 'not', 'crime', 'be', 'great', 'lay', 'Well', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'crime', 'be', 'great', 'lay', ""'re"", 'Madonna', 'crime', 'try', 'play', 'one', 'Striving', 'effortless', 'incendiary', 'va-voom', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'Vertigo', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'Madonna', 'off', 'not', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'blonde', 'bomb.When', 'Dafoe', 'Madonna', 'Mantegna', 'going', 'build', 'case', 'predilection', 'violent', 'dirty', 'sex', 'Madonna', 'was', ""n't"", 'dirty', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'animals', 'make', 'love', 'intense', 'violent', 'never', 'really', 'hurt', 'other', 'Dafoe', 'replies', ""'re"", 'not', 'animals', 'whereupon', 'Madonna', 'counters', 'Yes', 'are', 'Well', 'are', 'Soon', 'strangest', 'come-on', 'movie', 'history', 'nude', 'Madonna', 'needles', 'stuck', 'behind', 'acupuncturist', 'Dafoe', 'watches', 'practically', 'panting', 'court', 'detective', 'Mantegna', 'take', 'Madonna', 'jury', 'murder', 'weapon', 'When', 'trial', 'over', 'will', 'see', 'differently', 'gun', 'knife', 'other', 'instrument', 'used', 'weapon', 'short', 'inanimate', 'object', 'have', 'right', 'Prosecution', 'witness', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'secretary', 'dead', 'man', 'refers', 'Madonna', 'cokehead', 'slut', 'Judge', 'Lillian', 'Lehman', 'up', 'one', 'favorite', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'lines', 'ever', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'titillating', 'nature', 'trial', 'had', 'wanted', 'work', 'circus', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'how', 'ride', 'trapeze']",N/A

And this movie was and yet another attempt to wrestle that ever-elusive stardom to the ground.  Coming after &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, this little gem's producers clearly thought that they could outdo that movie at the box office.  After all, Madonna had set the music industry on it's ear, and taken the publishing industry by storm with her book &quot;Sex&quot;.  Their fatal mistake was not realising that Madonna can't act- she was sort of playing herself in her first movie, so of course she was good.

She and Willem DaFoe have zero chemistry together.It doesn't help that the script is awful- to the point of being unbelievable.
