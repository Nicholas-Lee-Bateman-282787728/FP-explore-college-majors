801094,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B0001DMUCM,Alice L. Moore,"[1, 1]","This is a continuation from the excellent 1st seasonMonarch of the Glen - Series One.  The series followed the arc started from Season One.  My personal preference would have been more complications for the the endings of Archie's romances.The addition of Fergol didn't seem to add anything except as a foil to Archie and Katrina.  I did like the final episode that ended on a cliffhanger.The scenery of Scotland is of course a big star and trump for the series. Susan Hampshire does well not only as Archie's mother but as a complex character in her own right(see the 1st episode) The relationships, Archie's, seemed to be contrived.This being said I will certainly watch Season 3.  The general Amazon review is not very helpful as it gives inadvertant spoilers. I wish they would remedy this",4,Monarch of the Glen: Season 2,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,793,"['continuation', 'excellent', '1st', 'seasonMonarch', 'Glen', 'Series', 'One', 'series', 'followed', 'arc', 'started', 'Season', 'One', 'personal', 'preference', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'complications', 'endings', 'Archie', 'romances.The', 'addition', 'Fergol', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'add', 'anything', 'foil', 'Archie', 'Katrina', 'did', 'final', 'episode', 'ended', 'cliffhanger.The', 'scenery', 'Scotland', 'course', 'big', 'star', 'trump', 'series', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'well', 'not', 'only', 'Archie', 'mother', 'complex', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'see', '1st', 'episode', 'relationships', 'Archie', 'seemed', 'be', 'contrived.This', 'being', 'said', 'will', 'certainly', 'watch', 'Season', '3', 'general', 'Amazon', 'review', 'not', 'very', 'helpful', 'inadvertant', 'spoilers', 'wish', 'would', 'remedy']",Monarch of the Glen - Series Two

In season 2 Archie is fully charged with his new position as Laird and is doing everything he can for the estate to make money.

The 'will they or won't they' romance between Archie and Katrina was getting tiresome but by the end of season 2 they seemed to have settled in.Season 2 of Monarch of the Glen continues the high quality of the first.

801104,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B0001DMUCM,R. Kyle,"[0, 0]","""Monarch of the Glen"" is a delightful Scottish drama with some of the best scenery, soundtrack and actors in British television. In this second season, Archie MacDonald, the reluctant laird of Glenbogle is actually pulling the sprawling estate out of debt and bringing tourism to the region. He's hired a wildlife ranger to put up nature trails so schoolchildren and others can see the estate's unspoiled forests and protect the wildlife. He's setting up an authentic Victorian croft to depict how people lived. And he's arranging to sell cottages to the long-time renters.  Hector, the old laird, is finally coming around save for the occasional lapse where whiskey is concerned. Archie's relationship with his London partner and girlfriend is over, and he believes he might have a chance with the local school-mistress.  Overall, the program's satisfying and hilarious.Rebecca Kyle, September 2009",5,"More ""MacInations""",1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,899,"['Monarch', 'Glen', 'delightful', 'Scottish', 'drama', 'best', 'scenery', 'soundtrack', 'actors', 'British', 'television', 'second', 'season', 'Archie', 'MacDonald', 'reluctant', 'laird', 'Glenbogle', 'actually', 'pulling', 'sprawling', 'estate', 'debt', 'bringing', 'tourism', 'region', 'hired', 'wildlife', 'ranger', 'put', 'up', 'nature', 'trails', 'so', 'schoolchildren', 'others', 'can', 'see', 'estate', 'unspoiled', 'forests', 'protect', 'wildlife', 'setting', 'up', 'authentic', 'Victorian', 'croft', 'depict', 'how', 'people', 'lived', 'arranging', 'sell', 'cottages', 'long-time', 'renters', 'Hector', 'old', 'laird', 'finally', 'coming', 'around', 'save', 'occasional', 'lapse', 'where', 'whiskey', 'concerned', 'Archie', 'relationship', 'London', 'partner', 'girlfriend', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'local', 'school-mistress', 'Overall', 'program', 'satisfying', 'hilarious.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'September', '2009']",Monarch of the Glen - Series Two
