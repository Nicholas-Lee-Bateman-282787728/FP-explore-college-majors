Aguero ""donburioishii""","[4, 7]","I know you have heart and you meant well, but I just have to warn anyone who watches this movie and does not find it funny within the first 10 minutes, that it will NOT pick up. Better to give up than to go another one hour and 38 minutes marveling at how terrible this movie is. As another reviewer noted, it's not even ""good-bad."" It's just really ... bad. The jokes are slow, simplistic, and stereotypical; I was actually cringing at times.On the other hand, if you truly like this movie within the first few minutes, then you will certainly enjoy it; as the saying goes, ""To each his own."" For my part, however, I read the five-star reviews, and I am still mystified.Again, I am very sorry to give this film such a poor review. On the other hand, after paying for it and spending the best part of my evening sitting through it, I feel duty-bound to warn others!I should add one bright note, though: Sheetal Sheth offers the only relief here.

Produced by Albert Brooks.  Starring Albert Brooks.  I sincerely hope Albert Brooks had a good time, because nobody else did.I will be very generous here, and hope he had a point, and that it was that of the oblivious American traveller.  He goes to India, which isn't Muslim, and manages to find an alternate reality version of the place so sanitized and Americanized that he could've easily filmed the entire movie on the studio back lot in Hollywood.  But if that's the joke, it misfired horribly.  If that's not the joke, then my opinion of Albert Brooks must go way down.I really don't want to jump on a ""I've lived in Asia since 1999"" high horse.

994689,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000FS9FD0,Alex Udvary,"[3, 4]","I'm going to be completely honest here, just lay all my cards on the table. I think Albert Brooks is one very funny guy. I've seen all of his movies and I laugh and laugh at all of them, even the one's the public goes against such as ""The Muse"". So when I heard about this film, lets just say my hopes were pretty high.""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" has a pretty good idea behind it but the execution is a bit off. The U.S. government has decided that their ""war on terror"" isn't really working. A new approach is needed. The government has decided they really don't know anything about the muslim world. And you can't fight a war if you don't understand your enemy. So, in an attempt to get inside the muslim world's mind, they have decided the best way to do this is to understand what makes muslim's laughs. If the United States can understand that, then they will understand the muslim people.After trying out a few comedians, a letter is sent to Albert Brooks (who plays himself in the film) asking him if he would like to head this committee.The situation is ripe for satire. Brooks could poke fun at the U.S. government, at bureaucracy in general, the cultural differences between the West and the Muslim world and list is endless for the potential a film such as this could have. But, somehow, somewhere along the way the first loses its nerve and doesn't fully engaged itself in the material.What I mean by that is mostly, the film simply falls flat. The jokes aren't funny, the situation becomes boring.The government sends Brooks to India and Pakistan, and while in India Brooks goes around as a sort of ""man on the street"" reporter asking various people what makes them laugh. But his approaches to finding this out are repetetive at best because the street approach is his only approach.What if he watched Bollywood movies? Found out about muslim comics?Joining Brooks on his journey are two government officials; Stewart (John Carroll Lynch) a wanna comic whom learns the secret rule among comics from Brooks, and Mark (John Tenney) a so-called ladies man who is constantly on the phone.Also with Brooks is his secratary, Maya (played by Sheetal Sheth, who is a new face to me, but, what a face! I hope we see much, much more of her in the future).The tough thing about reviewing a comedy is, it's hard to be serious in a review because what you really want to do is tell everyone all the funny jokes. But, because there are so few good jokes in the film, I'd be spoiling the entire movie for you if I did that.This is not to make ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" a complete dud. Brooks has written a few choice moments. Some scenes are very cleverly written and have comical exchanges that remind us of Brooks' other films. Remember the famous exchange in ""Lost in America"" concerning the casino giving Brooks back his money? Nothing in this film really reaches that, but, Brooks is trying here and there.Albert Brooks will be back again, I'm sure, but how disaapointing the film couldn't reach its potential. One thing to consider is Brooks wrote and directed the film by himself. Brooks usually collaborates with Monica Johnson, they have written ""The Muse"", ""Defending Your Life"" and ""Lost in America"" together. So their track record is pretty good. Brooks seems to need to work with someone. He needs someone to feed ideas to and give him input. Perhaps instead of trying to find out what makes muslims laugh he should have found out what makes Americans laugh first.Bottom-line: A surprising disppointment from writer/director Albert Brooks. The film is ripe of cultural and political satire but misses the mark. The jokes and the situations fall flat.",2,Still Looking!,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,3690,"[""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'here', 'just', 'lay', 'cards', 'table', 'think', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'one', 'very', 'funny', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'even', 'one', 'public', 'such', 'Muse', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'just', 'say', 'hopes', 'were', 'pretty', 'high', 'Looking', 'Comedy', 'Muslim', 'World', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'execution', 'bit', 'off', 'U.S.', 'government', 'decided', 'war', 'terror', ""n't"", 'really', 'working', 'new', 'approach', 'needed', 'government', 'decided', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'muslim', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fight', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'enemy', 'So', 'attempt', 'get', 'muslim', 'world', 'mind', 'have', 'decided', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'understand', 'what', 'muslim', 'laughs', 'United', 'States', 'can', 'understand', 'then', 'will', 'understand', 'muslim', 'people.After', 'trying', 'out', 'few', 'comedians', 'letter', 'sent', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'film', 'asking', 'would', 'like', 'head', 'committee.The', 'situation', 'ripe', 'satire', 'Brooks', 'could', 'poke', 'fun', 'U.S.', 'government', 'bureaucracy', 'general', 'cultural', 'differences', 'West', 'Muslim', 'world', 'list', 'endless', 'potential', 'film', 'such', 'could', 'have', 'somehow', 'somewhere', 'way', 'first', 'nerve', ""n't"", 'fully', 'engaged', 'material.What', 'mean', 'mostly', 'film', 'simply', 'flat', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'situation', 'boring.The', 'government', 'sends', 'Brooks', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'India', 'Brooks', 'around', 'sort', 'man', 'street', 'reporter', 'asking', 'various', 'people', 'what', 'laugh', 'approaches', 'finding', 'out', 'are', 'repetetive', 'best', 'street', 'approach', 'only', 'approach.What', 'watched', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'Found', 'muslim', 'comics', 'Joining', 'Brooks', 'journey', 'are', 'two', 'government', 'officials', 'Stewart', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'wan', 'na', 'comic', 'whom', 'secret', 'rule', 'comics', 'Brooks', 'Mark', 'John', 'Tenney', 'so-called', 'ladies', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'phone.Also', 'Brooks', 'secratary', 'Maya', 'played', 'Sheetal', 'Sheth', 'who', 'new', 'face', 'what', 'face', 'hope', 'see', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'future', 'tough', 'thing', 'reviewing', 'comedy', 'hard', 'be', 'serious', 'review', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'do', 'tell', 'everyone', 'funny', 'jokes', 'are', 'so', 'few', 'good', 'jokes', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'spoiling', 'entire', 'movie', 'did', 'that.This', 'not', 'make', 'Looking', 'Comedy', 'Muslim', 'World', 'complete', 'dud', 'Brooks', 'written', 'few', 'choice', 'moments', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'cleverly', 'written', 'have', 'comical', 'exchanges', 'remind', 'Brooks', 'other', 'films', 'Remember', 'famous', 'exchange', 'Lost', 'America', 'concerning', 'casino', 'giving', 'Brooks', 'back', 'money', 'Nothing', 'film', 'really', 'Brooks', 'trying', 'here', 'there.Albert', 'Brooks', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', 'how', 'disaapointing', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'reach', 'potential', 'One', 'thing', 'consider', 'Brooks', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'Brooks', 'usually', 'Monica', 'Johnson', 'have', 'written', 'Muse', 'Defending', 'Life', 'Lost', 'America', 'together', 'track', 'record', 'pretty', 'good', 'Brooks', 'need', 'work', 'someone', 'someone', 'feed', 'ideas', 'give', 'input', 'Perhaps', 'instead', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'muslims', 'should', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'Americans', 'laugh', 'first.Bottom-line', 'surprising', 'disppointment', 'writer/director', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'film', 'ripe', 'cultural', 'political', 'satire', 'mark', 'jokes', 'situations', 'fall', 'flat']",Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World
994690,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000FS9FD0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[28, 34]","LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD is a thinking man's comedy. If you're of the 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN or DATE MOVIE crowd, please avoid this film and spare us your ""It just ...sucks"" review.If you're an Albert Brooks fan, you most certainly will enjoy his deadpan delivery and hyper-worried state that we came to enjoy during DEFENDING YOUR LIFE (I suspect this is why he was also cast as the father's voice in FINDING NEMO). But enough about Brooks. Let's see what the movie's about.Looking For Comedy opens with Brooks arriving for a casting call at Penny Marshall's office (It's noteworthy to mention that Albert Brooks plays Albert Brooks and Penny Marshall plays Penny Marshall). Everyone seems to only recognize Brooks as ""that guy who played that fish in Finding Nemo."" His career is grudgingly winding down.But upon returning home a letter from the government appears in the mail. He is summoned to Washington by a panel of Senators to do a research project for them (""Our first choice, quite frankly, wasn't available"" they tell him when Brooks asks `Why me?') And his job? Travel to India and Pakistan and find out what makes Muslims laugh. Oh. ""And you have to write a 500-page report on it.""""500 pages? I don't think I've ever written anything that long,"" Brooks protests. But he accepts the assignment and travels with two government men as his entourage and support crew. Once in India they bumble through getting an office and a secretary named Maya (the stunningly pretty Sheetal Sheth). Now the hard work begins. Either people won't talk to him or give him off the wall answers or give no answer at all. So Brooks decides to put on a comedy show at a local gymnasium only to have that fall flat, too.To add insult to injury, war bells are ringing between Pakistan and India, bells that Brooks doesn't help with by sneaking across the border into Pakistan one night in order to meet up with some future comedian hopefuls.The thing that makes this film so funny is that it doesn't try that hard. It just is. Brooks' normal paranoia fits perfectly with the script and makes us laugh time and again at his overzealous fears. Also is the fact that it shows the complete ineptness of government in trying to understand another culture by sending someone to another country who has no knowledge of such a job. And they send him to India! Although there are a lot of Muslims there, it is mainly a Hindu country. An Arab nation may have been a better choice but obviously the government higher-ups failed to do their own research before sending in an even-less-informed Brooks. Now THAT is subtle humor. If you ""don't get that"", you should avoid seeing this flick. But if you enjoy that kind of subtlety, give Looking For Comedy a try.

994693,AEVNUEDRGTC4P,B000FS9FD0,Charles J. Rector,"[6, 8]","There are a certain number of films released each and every year that aim to be controversial. Some filmmakers such as Michael Moore achieve their goal of becoming rich and famous. Others try and fail to hit their target. And then there are others such as Albert Brooks in the recently released Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World whose arrows land well short of the target altogether.Basically, this movie is about Albert Brooks's going on a government appointed mission to discover just what makes folks laugh in the Islamic world and finding very little. Accompanying Brooks are 2 idiotic State Department flunkies.For a movie that has ""comedy"" in the title, there is certainly little comedy in Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World. There are some genuinely funny bits such as the Polish eye chart. Another fun moment was the spoof on Indian call centers taking calls for American insurance companies, department stores and even the White House.The movie itself is largely boring and there is very little genuine comedy in it. There are several misfires such as a Jew-hating Indian trying to get the Jewish Brooks to hire him. The movie does attempt to show that the Islamic world is generally humorless and that U.S. State Department programs in the Islamic world are both stupid and poorly run. Brooks spends a lot of time worrying about what to write down in his 500 page report to the State Department. Brooks also conducts a number of interviews with everyday Indians to try to find out what makes Muslims laugh. In any event, since most of the characters in the movie are either Hindus or Sikhs and not Muslims, its pretty evident that Albert Brooks himself is an incompetent.The flick makes very little sense in its implied contention that there is no sense of humor in the Muslim world. The Three Stooges have been well received everywhere. Basically, the film has a counterproductive plot in that someone like Albert Brooks who has no real sense of humor himself is sent on a mission to find out what makes folks in a certain region laugh.Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World is a waste and time and effort, not to mention your time and money.",1,Should Be Titled Looking For Comedy In Albert Brooks,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",2007,2162,"['are', 'certain', 'number', 'films', 'released', 'year', 'aim', 'be', 'controversial', 'filmmakers', 'such', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'achieve', 'goal', 'becoming', 'rich', 'famous', 'Others', 'try', 'fail', 'hit', 'target', 'then', 'are', 'others', 'such', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'recently', 'released', 'Looking', 'Comedy', 'Muslim', 'World', 'arrows', 'land', 'well', 'short', 'target', 'altogether.Basically', 'movie', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'going', 'government', 'appointed', 'mission', 'discover', 'just', 'what', 'folks', 'Islamic', 'world', 'finding', 'very', 'little', 'Accompanying', 'Brooks', 'are', '2', 'idiotic', 'State', 'Department', 'flunkies.For', 'movie', 'comedy', 'title', 'certainly', 'little', 'comedy', 'Looking', 'Comedy', 'Muslim', 'World', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'bits', 'such', 'Polish', 'eye', 'chart', 'fun', 'moment', 'was', 'spoof', 'Indian', 'call', 'centers', 'taking', 'calls', 'American', 'insurance', 'companies', 'department', 'stores', 'even', 'White', 'House.The', 'movie', 'largely', 'boring', 'very', 'little', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'are', 'several', 'misfires', 'such', 'Jew-hating', 'Indian', 'trying', 'get', 'Jewish', 'Brooks', 'hire', 'movie', 'attempt', 'show', 'Islamic', 'world', 'generally', 'humorless', 'U.S.', 'State', 'Department', 'programs', 'Islamic', 'world', 'are', 'stupid', 'poorly', 'run', 'Brooks', 'lot', 'time', 'worrying', 'what', 'write', 'down', '500', 'page', 'report', 'State', 'Department', 'Brooks', 'also', 'number', 'interviews', 'everyday', 'Indians', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Muslims', 'laugh', 'event', 'most', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'Hindus', 'Sikhs', 'not', 'Muslims', 'pretty', 'evident', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'incompetent.The', 'flick', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'implied', 'contention', 'sense', 'humor', 'Muslim', 'world', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'received', 'everywhere', 'Basically', 'film', 'counterproductive', 'plot', 'someone', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'who', 'real', 'sense', 'humor', 'sent', 'mission', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'folks', 'certain', 'region', 'laugh.Looking', 'Comedy', 'Muslim', 'World', 'waste', 'time', 'effort', 'not', 'mention', 'time', 'money']",Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World

994695,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000FS9FD0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 3]","This quirky comedy had the potential to be pretty funny and/or actually say something about Muslim culture, and I was quite disappointed to find it met the first goal only partially and failed abysmally at the second - especially since the film spent most of its time in India, a nation I find fascinating (while it is by and large a Hindu nation, India does have a very significant Muslim population).  Frankly, I don't know what this film actually wanted to accomplish.  Stereotypes abound in the representation of the two foreign cultures, Albert Brooks spends a lot of time being conspicuously unfunny, and all but one of the secondary characters are without any substance whatsoever.  Albert Brooks' sardonic wit can be funny when he's complaining, but that's about all this movie has going for it.Why is Brooks Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World, anyway?  Well, a special committee headed by politician/actor Fred Thompson, working under the auspices of the State Department, has asked him to serve his country by helping the American government understand what makes your typical Muslim tick.  Find out what makes Muslims laugh, as the argument goes, and you'll go a long way toward understanding them.  That's why they're asking Brooks, a comedian, to travel to India and Pakistan, spend a month figuring out what makes the people laugh, and write a 500 page report on it.  You'll hear a lot about this 500 page report, as Brooks goes on and on about the challenge of it, especially as time goes on and he learns almost nothing remotely useful or relevant.  Thank goodness for Sheetal Sheth, who plays Maya, the assistant/secretary Brooks hires after arriving in India.  Sadly, however, the script wastes a golden opportunity to reveal something about the life of an independent woman in Indian society, relegating Maya all too often as the only person in the entire film who finds Albert Brooks remotely funny.I'll admit that I'm not familiar with the comedic work of Albert Brooks, although I do appreciate the type of sarcastic dry humor he seems to specialize in - but I don't see how even his biggest fan can find his big ""comedy show"" in India funny.  He actually opens with a Gandhi joke, which is not the best way to win over his audience.  At least they didn't have any trouble finding a crowd who could sit there stone-faced throughout the routine, as this show would be a total bomb in any country, in any language.  Having counted on the big show to discover what Indians find funny, Brooks' mission is all but doomed by this point.  And forget about Pakistan - Brooks has to sneak across the border just to spend a few hours with a group of ""budding Pakistani comedians.""If the film has any point at all - and I don't think it does - it might be this: even our best-intentioned attempts to understand foreign cultures are too misguided or just plain stupid to ever have a prayer of succeeding - and sometimes exacerbate problems that we are too insensitive to understand or even recognize.

994697,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000FS9FD0,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","There is a great, timely idea at the heart of Albert Brooks' most recent comedy, but as it turns out, the idea is the most inspired aspect of this 2006 film. As a writer and director, he has been on a gradual artistic decline since his peak, 1985's ""Lost in America"", when he effectively skewered the vacuity of materialistic yuppie values in a road-movie format. In this movie, he addresses an interesting topic, whether there is universality to comedy that transcends cultural differences at a time when hostilities have been peaking against Americans in the Middle East. The film starts out well with Brooks, playing himself and struggling to find his next job in Hollywood, is requested by the U.S. government to find out what makes Muslims laugh in India and Pakistan and submit a 500-page report about it.The problem is that the story loses much of its relevant punch by setting most of the action in Delhi instead of a more Muslim-dominated area. While there is some humor in the scene where Brooks interviews for an assistant and a running gag related to outsourcing, the film continues to deflate with his character's persistent efforts to ask various Indians what makes them laugh and prepares a stand-up concert to test his comic relevance to a local audience. This leads to an overlong performance scene that belabors the point that a comedian needs to develop a rapport with an audience before they will consider laughing.The story meanders quite a bit with tiresome stops at the Pakistani border and the Al-Jazeera network offices, but Brooks is so timid and self-absorbed in his approach that the film starts to induce yawns for its increasingly enervating tone. One intriguing angle is introduced involving suspicions about Brooks from the Indian and Pakistani governments, but the pay-off is minimal. In fact, very little momentum is gained from a number of subplots, including one involving Brooks' perennially cheery assistant Maya and her jealous Iranian boyfriend. As Maya, Sheetal Sheth provides one of the few bright spots in the film, but her character has little to do other than boost Brooks' morale. John Carroll Lynch has a few funny moments as a State Department agent who turns out to be a longtime fan of the comedian.The movie does little to enhance the filmmaking reputation of Brooks, who still shows a gift for self-deprecating humor, this time going all the way by playing a fictionalized version of himself. Recalling his video shorts from the first incarnation of ""Saturday Night Live"" back in the seventies, I keep thinking this could have been funnier and far more pertinent as a documentary with Brooks actually doing the research with real Muslims. Given the poor box office reception to the movie, I am not too surprised that the DVD is very skimpy on extras - no commentary track from Brooks or anything that has him explaining the genesis of the film, just four unlabeled deleted scenes (including a silly gag with a New York cabbie in Delhi) and the theatrical trailer.",2,"Great Premise Falters Upon Its Meandering, Politically Timid Execution",1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,3015,"['great', 'timely', 'idea', 'heart', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'most', 'recent', 'comedy', 'out', 'idea', 'most', 'inspired', 'aspect', '2006', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'been', 'gradual', 'artistic', 'decline', 'peak', '1985', 'Lost', 'America', 'when', 'effectively', 'skewered', 'vacuity', 'materialistic', 'yuppie', 'values', 'road-movie', 'format', 'movie', 'interesting', 'topic', 'universality', 'comedy', 'cultural', 'differences', 'time', 'when', 'hostilities', 'have', 'been', 'peaking', 'Americans', 'Middle', 'East', 'film', 'out', 'well', 'Brooks', 'playing', 'struggling', 'find', 'next', 'job', 'Hollywood', 'requested', 'U.S.', 'government', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Muslims', 'laugh', 'India', 'Pakistan', 'submit', '500-page', 'report', 'it.The', 'problem', 'story', 'much', 'relevant', 'punch', 'setting', 'most', 'action', 'Delhi', 'instead', 'more', 'Muslim-dominated', 'area', 'humor', 'scene', 'where', 'Brooks', 'interviews', 'assistant', 'running', 'gag', 'related', 'outsourcing', 'film', 'deflate', 'character', 'persistent', 'efforts', 'ask', 'various', 'Indians', 'what', 'laugh', 'stand-up', 'concert', 'test', 'comic', 'relevance', 'local', 'audience', 'overlong', 'performance', 'scene', 'point', 'comedian', 'develop', 'rapport', 'audience', 'will', 'consider', 'laughing.The', 'story', 'meanders', 'quite', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'stops', 'Pakistani', 'border', 'Al-Jazeera', 'network', 'offices', 'Brooks', 'so', 'timid', 'self-absorbed', 'approach', 'film', 'induce', 'yawns', 'increasingly', 'enervating', 'tone', 'One', 'intriguing', 'angle', 'introduced', 'involving', 'suspicions', 'Brooks', 'Indian', 'Pakistani', 'governments', 'pay-off', 'minimal', 'fact', 'very', 'little', 'momentum', 'gained', 'number', 'subplots', 'including', 'one', 'involving', 'Brooks', 'perennially', 'cheery', 'assistant', 'Maya', 'jealous', 'Iranian', 'boyfriend', 'Maya', 'Sheetal', 'Sheth', 'one', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'film', 'character', 'little', 'do', 'other', 'boost', 'Brooks', 'morale', 'John', 'Carroll', 'Lynch', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'State', 'Department', 'agent', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'longtime', 'fan', 'comedian.The', 'movie', 'little', 'enhance', 'filmmaking', 'reputation', 'Brooks', 'who', 'still', 'gift', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'time', 'going', 'way', 'playing', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'Recalling', 'video', 'shorts', 'first', 'incarnation', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'back', 'seventies', 'keep', 'thinking', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'far', 'more', 'pertinent', 'documentary', 'Brooks', 'actually', 'doing', 'research', 'real', 'Muslims', 'Given', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'reception', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'surprised', 'DVD', 'very', 'skimpy', 'extras', 'commentary', 'track', 'Brooks', 'anything', 'explaining', 'genesis', 'film', 'just', 'four', 'unlabeled', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'silly', 'gag', 'New', 'York', 'cabbie', 'Delhi', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World
994698,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B000FS9FD0,Eugene Chamson,"[5, 11]","For those of us who grew up appreciating the comic genius of Albert Brooks in such classics as ""Defending Your Life"" and ""Lost in America"", this film will be painful to watch.  Brooks has frequently used his personal neuroses in self-deprecating ways as material for funny stories (for example, his jealousy in ""Modern Romance"", his writers-block in ""The Muse""), but here, he has taken it too far, in portraying himself as a comic that can't get a laugh.Brooks plays himself as a has-been comic star who no one seems to remember or respect.  He's humiliated in job interviews for parts and can't find work until a special U.S. government commission asks him to travel to India and Pakistan to discover what makes people laugh in the Muslim world, and to write a 500 page report about it.  Here, Brooks is taking a swipe at our government's ham-handed approach to dealing with the Muslim world, but he is also saying something dark and sad about what happens to aging comics: they wind up doing silly gigs where no one laughs anymore.  Which is essentially what this movie is, as well as what it is about.As Brooks goes on his trip, there are running gags about how underfunded and unimportant everyone considers his mission to be: his cramped coach airline seat, his tiny office in India.  These are supposed to be funny, but I found myself wincing more often than laughing.  Likewise, when Brooks performs his comedy to a stone silent New Delhi audience, it's painful to watch.  Mostly because the audience in India is reflecting the truth that the audience in the theatre feels: that Brooks just isn't being that funny with his tacky jokes and his 30 year old schtick.Given the title of the film, one might expect much of the humor to be at the expense of Islamic fundamentalists.  But the joke backfires.  The people of India and Pakistan are perfectly capable of laughing, it's just that Brooks isn't funny.  Toward the end of the movie, in a scene that is the ultimate humiliation for the comic, Al-Jazeera proposes that he star in a new sitcom, generously translated as ""That Darn Jew"".Fortunately, there are enough clever lines and cute bits to provide a few smiles and chuckles, and prevent the movie from being a total bomb.  If you don't know Albert Brooks, you might find it somewhat amusing to watch this American comic struggle in a foreign culture.  But if you do know Albert Brooks as someone who was once one of the brightest comic talents of his generation,  you'll find it uncomfortable to watch him play a comic who can't get a laugh.

994699,A2WETFLJM0D6R0,B000FS9FD0,"ewomack ""ewomack""","[2, 2]","First off, understand that this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with Islam or Muslims. It instead focuses on myopia, with Brooks himself taking on the role of ugly American. Pretty much off the wall from beginning to end, the film makes it clear that neither the main character nor his government have any idea what they're doing. And worse, they don't care. A Senator, armed with a budget, charges Brooks with a mission to India and Pakistan to find out what makes Muslims laugh. He also gets assigned a 500-page paper because they need to ""justify the expense"".Along the way viewers will learn nothing about Islam or India. Of course that's the whole point. We experience the film and the cultures through the eyes of people who have no knowledge nor any desire to learn about Muslim culture. Brooks tries interviewing people on the street by stopping them and asking ""what makes you laugh?"" He offends and confuses most of them, and his assistant doesn't understand all of the languages (India has quite a few). The group visits some laughing yogis but they again make no effort to understand them. Instead, Brooks suggests putting on a comedy show. Since he has no idea what people in India find funny, he falls back on old tried and true material (at least, tried and true in the United States). Of course it falls flat, but once again Brooks makes no effort to find out why. He assumes the people are the problem. But he does at least visit a mosque. That sums up the Islamic part of the film.The Indian parliament starts to suspect Brooks. They decide to watch him. Brooks' US government cronies then set him up to visit a group of aspiring Pakistani comedians. But they have to cross the border illegally since their visas didn't get processed. Brooks sneaks in alone, smokes a hookah, and reduces the Pakistanis to helpless laughter with the same jokes that didn't work in India. The hookah probably helped. Though a success, Brooks once again doesn't make any effort to understand why. Unfortunately, India and Pakistan both begin to suspect foul play and start hoarding troops at their borders. Soon after Brooks gets called home for his own safety.In his comfortable California home, sipping wine with friends, Brooks gets hailed as the ambassador of peace. At the same time the television announces escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. Of course he has learned nothing nor accomplished anything apart from annoying people. He even brings his daughter home a Taj Mahal snow dome; blatant tourist bait.A fairly obvious metaphor emerges. Maybe a bit too obvious. Unfortunately, Brooks sometimes seems more concerned with message than narrative. The movie nonetheless contains many hilarious moments (the group takes a ""day off"" to  see the Taj Mahal, but they somehow miss it as it scrolls by in the background; again, myopia). But the entire project leaves behind a feeling, perhaps an intentional one, of ""what just happened?"" Also, a very noticeable downturn in energy occurs halfway through. The film builds up to this moment with amazing anticipation, and then unfortunately stops. If Brooks could have sustained that original momentum throughout, he would have created a masterpiece. Instead, we get an entertaining but slightly muddled film. But likely Brooks wanted viewers to feel slightly confused to simulate getting lost in another culture. Does it work? Hard to say. Brooks' cerebral style will disorient many viewers. Not only that, the film's title creates expectations that don't really get delivered. Of course that is, again, the point. But that point, along with the central message of the movie, will get lost on many audiences. Regardless, Brooks deserves some credit for his effort. Not many movies like this one exist. Some will welcome that fact, while others will bemoan the paucity of intellectualism in Hollywood. In the end, ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" deserves at least a single viewing.

One reviewer called it a ""thinking man's comedy"" and noted if you thought 40 year old virgin was hilarious put this in the don't bother category.Much of the humor is situational and very subtle; it goes well beyond one-liners.  There are scenes, mirroring Discovery, PBS, and Geographic travelogues of India.  There are tiny taxis, holy cows, bustling streets of people in very colorful dress some religiously prescribed,  These directly contrast with scenes of Washington DC, so trim, uncluttered, with its Doric temples of power and humorless men seeking to find humor in others.  How can these peoples possibly understand each other? The parallel temples of power in India and Pakistan prove equally grim and unimaginatively populated.  It is no wonder this part of the world and DC are at war.  Brooks' talent for getting beyond the comfortable travel pix gives a new much neeed perspective.Snippets of information are picked up by spies, take on a life of their own in a miasma of suspicion and fear and grow into troop movement and military engagements.  Grim offices filled with telephone operators respond in accented English as Onstar, State Farm Insurance etc.  Who are these people, who are these companies?  Brooks most able and ""almost-understands"" satire assistant tries valiantly to ""get it"" but always misses for one reason or another.  Not unlike Borat, Brooks reveals multi-national cultural blind spots with laser like precision.  It is important to realize that this film is as much about American perspective as it is about the ""Muslim world"".If you like a bit of vinegar with your comedy, an added dimension that might reveal your own cultural blind spots, this film is for you. Like Borat, this film makes people nervous.  They sense there is something beneath the surface, some run away, others dig, then laugh and learn.  If comedy for you is an experience of pleasure laughing at the antics of a clown whose foolishness could not possibly resemble your own, pick up another DVD.  Chaplin in ""Modern Times"" revealed early 20th century man trapped in a machine age.

The plot about a famous comedian...alleged famous comedian since the running gag of the movie seems to be that nobody knows about him much less cares tells you right of the bat that this is far from a ""thinking man's"" comedy as somebody else said. Age didn't matter either in me disliking (I'am over the teenybopper age a long, long time ago).First the film drags on and on with unfunny jokes. Why would the government trying to soften relations with Middle East send Albert Brooks why not Jay Leno or Conan O'Brien, oh well. Like somebody else the stereotypical jokes (like the Call Center well all the technical computer questions in American are received by Outsourced Pakistans) gets old quick.Even this side story (which I guess was supposed to be romantic) with Albert and his assistant Maya I think her name is wasn't really explored though hinted at many times (like her boyfriend is really jealous at her spending so much time with Albert). The jokes Albert throws at this Muslim/Pakistan are lame, very lame. Besides the character he plays looks utterly desperate in just compiling an audience to begin with. I guess this was supposed to be funny how an alleged famous comedian can't even get enough seats to fill a gymnasium but it just wasn't funny. Deadpan humor/Dry humor whatever you want to call it isn't always funny and this movie is living proof of that.It's just a sad, bad movie. I wouldn't even call it ""it's so bad it's good"" movie it just really had nothing special going for it and you'd have to pay me to watch this again. It's gotten a 5.4 rating on IMDB which pretty much is borderline average to mediocre which is about right. Again I like Albert but this isn't his best effort not by any stretch of the imagination.

An American comedian is sent to infiltrate India and Pakistan to find out what makes them laugh.  Then the movie actually got boring as Brooks meandered through India with some painful and un-comic moments.  Ironically, while it was meant to backfire on the Indian audience in the film, too much of Brooks's schtick also petered over to the real life audience - us.  Although keeping with Brooks' self-effacing style, there really is a fine line between understated and lame comedy.  The journey is underwhelming, and the promise of the film never arrives.I literally struggled with some of this, which is a shame.  This movie had tremendous opportunities to be many things that no other movie would ever attempt.  But we leave India and Pakistan no wiser than when we found it, which I acknowledge may be the point of the film.  Still, the whole episode leaves an unsatisfying taste.  It's a little like bring offered a steak and getting a regular Mcdonald's burger.There are moments of Lost in Translation reality in the film that really resonate.  Others just fall by the wayside.

But when applied to people, the meaning goes further to indicate someone who is irritatingly flat. ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" -- Albert Brooks's film about a government-initiated plan to understand Muslims by studying their humor-- fits the French meaning of ""platte"" perfectly. The film shuttles between LA, Washington, New Delhi and Pakistan, but never achieves anything approaching humor or even that feeling of satisfaction at watching the travails of real people. Brooks's humor is deadpan to the point of being nonexistent. And like too many unsatisfying movies, its best lines are all in the trailer.The centerpiece of the film is Brooks's arrangement of a comedy night in New Delhi. He wishes to test various bits of humor on an Indian audience to see what works. Unfortunately, not only are his jokes unfunny to the Indians, they are unfunny to American ears as well, making me wonder what the joke was. Throughout the film, people ask the Brooks character whether (given his utter failure as a comedian in India) he really was a successful standup comedian in America. It's almost cringe-worthy to see a comedian highlight his professional failure so starkly. The film makes it clear that whatever propelled his success in the past has left him. The film's comedic situations are not ludicrous. A supposed joke -- in which his New Delhi office is very ""small"" -- fails completely. The office, while sparse, is a rather spacious, sunlit  2-room suite, with a desk and a leather sofa. It's an office I wouldn't mind having.We learn very little about Muslims in the movie, and less about what makes them laugh. ""Looking for Comedy"" is lazy, uninstructive, unfunny and uninteresting.

994707,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B000FS9FD0,Lleu Christopher,"[6, 9]","Albert Brooks, as he has shown in films like Lost In America and The Muse, has an intelligent, idiosyncratic style of comedy. That, along with the provocative title of Looking For Comedy In The Muslim World, gave me certain expectations about the movie. Even though I wasn't sure up front if it was a documentary or fictional (it is the latter), the notion of a Jewish-American comic going into Islamic countries with the intention of making people laugh seemed daunting, original and unpredictable. Unfortunately, what was unpredictable to me was how tame and slight the movie turned out to be. The premise, that Brooks (playing himself) is being sent to India and Pakistan by the U.S. government to find out what makes Muslims laugh, is, if not believable, a decent enough set-up. The first problem is that the whole movie (with the exception of a midnight border crossing) takes place in India, a country that is primarily Hindu. Brooks has two American assistants with him on the trip. They aren't especially funny; you can't say they are ""straight men"" either, as Brooks' style of comedy is droll and low-key, so he needed some livilier or wackier sidekicks. He also hires an attractive young Indian woman to be his assistant. She has a red dot on her forehead, identifying her as a Hindu. Brooks interacts with surprisingly few Muslims, despite the film's title.The running joke of the film is that the people of India don't get Brooks' style of humor. In one of the longest scenes, he does a stand-up routine in front of a packed auditorium. There is scarcely a chuckle throughout the performance as Brooks vainly tries various jokes, improvisations and even a ventriloquist routine. Watching this film, I felt like a member of this Indian audience, not getting it. It would be fine for the film not to be laugh-out-loud funny if it were insightful about cultural differences or about the psychology of a comic. But it doesn't come close to reaching these depths.  He makes a joke about Halloween, an American holiday. When no one laughs, it isn't funny to watch. It isn't even sad or moving; you just wonder how anyone could be so clueless as to not realize the mistake. There is not much tension in the movie, aside from the scene were Brooks illegally crosses into Pakistan and meets some aspiring comics who don't speak English. When the translator repeats the same jokes that flopped in front of the Indian audience, the Pakistanis think they are hilarious. There is no explanation for this. There is a mildly amusing subplot that has the Indian and Pakistani governments thinking Brooks is a spy, but this, by being the funniest thing in the film, actually calls attention to how weak the main story is.Because of the international incident Brooks inadvertently causes, he is sent home early. He kisses his wife and daughter and the movie is over, the audience left to wonder what it was all supposed to mean. This movie vaguely reminded me of another film, Lost In Translation (which I know many people liked more than I did). In both of these films, I had the feeling you were supposed to find people from non-Western cultures amusing simply because they aren't Americans.

It's not as good. But since REAL LIFE is to my mind one of the funniest films ever made and along with Brooks' next three films, a masterpiece, this isn't exactly damning.I hate using the phrase ""acquired taste"", but if those words do have any meaning then surely Albert Brooks' works as writer-director-star all qualify for the adjective; his reviews have always been divided, the box office always mediocre-to-poor; his fans, though, are as fiercely loyal as any. I count myself as one and am happy to report that after the largely disastrous MUSE (1999) Brooks is back on firmer, funnier, and generally more interesting ground. The satirical premise here is that the US State Department, in trying to find new ways to open dialogs with those angry Allah-worshiping folks, have commissioned a study on what makes people laugh in the Muslim world. Right away Brooks is in his element as the simultaneously arrogant and egotistical, yet self-deprecating and depressed paranoid entertainer -- he learns very quickly that he's hardly the country's first choice for this mission, something that gets repeated often throughout the film. It's all the more humorous and (coincidentally) fitting that the head of the project is played by none other than third-tier recent presidential candidate Fred Thompson, and that Brooks is first sent to predominantly Hindu India (I guess we'd like to know what makes the Hindus laugh too, they're important and they might hate us some day).If you know Brooks, you'll know that much of the humor from here on out will be subtle, low-key, and most of it at the star's expense, but the larger issues of American and Hollywood arrogance in the face of a different culture are never more than a moment's thought away. The bulk of the film has Brooks and his comely multilingual Indian assistant Maya (Sheetal Sheth) interviewing people on the street (the vast majority of whom speak excellent English, but of course don't know Brooks' work at all, apart from FINDING NEMO), staging a pretty unsuccessful standup show, and illicitly visiting underground Pakistani comics. Some of the best scenes involve his assistant's boyfriend, a jealous and insecure lover with both a suspicion of and fascination with western culture that is mirrored in Brooks' complex fears of him - as a potential terrorist (for no reason at all) and just as a boyfriend with a potentially dangerous misunderstanding.This all gets a just a bit stale towards the end and wraps up rather unconvincingly, alas, but Brooks fans shouldn't fear, the man still has it - he may need some new ideas or insights to bring him back to the level of MODERN ROMANCE or DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, but at least he's got me laughing again.",4,A return to form for one of our greatest comic actor/directors,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,2982,"['many', 'ways', 'thematic', 'sequel', 'sorts', 'Brooks', 'first', 'feature', '1978', 'REAL', 'LIFE', 'Brooks', 'essentially', 'version', 'using', 'own', 'name', 'making', 'documentary/essay', 'type', 'film', 'best', 'get', 'comparisons', 'way', 'quickly', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'REAL', 'LIFE', 'mind', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Brooks', 'next', 'three', 'films', 'masterpiece', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'damning.I', 'hate', 'using', 'phrase', 'acquired', 'taste', 'words', 'do', 'have', 'meaning', 'then', 'surely', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'works', 'writer-director-star', 'qualify', 'adjective', 'reviews', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'divided', 'box', 'office', 'always', 'mediocre-to-poor', 'fans', 'are', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'count', 'one', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'largely', 'disastrous', 'MUSE', '1999', 'Brooks', 'back', 'firmer', 'funnier', 'generally', 'more', 'interesting', 'ground', 'satirical', 'premise', 'here', 'US', 'State', 'Department', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'ways', 'open', 'dialogs', 'angry', 'Allah-worshiping', 'folks', 'have', 'commissioned', 'study', 'what', 'people', 'Muslim', 'world', 'Right', 'away', 'Brooks', 'element', 'simultaneously', 'arrogant', 'egotistical', 'yet', 'self-deprecating', 'depressed', 'paranoid', 'entertainer', 'very', 'quickly', 'hardly', 'country', 'first', 'choice', 'mission', 'something', 'repeated', 'often', 'film', 'more', 'humorous', 'coincidentally', 'fitting', 'head', 'project', 'played', 'none', 'other', 'third-tier', 'recent', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'Fred', 'Thompson', 'Brooks', 'first', 'sent', 'predominantly', 'Hindu', 'India', 'guess', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'what', 'Hindus', 'laugh', 'too', ""'re"", 'important', 'might', 'hate', 'day', '.If', 'know', 'Brooks', ""'ll"", 'know', 'much', 'humor', 'here', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'subtle', 'low-key', 'most', 'star', 'expense', 'larger', 'issues', 'American', 'Hollywood', 'arrogance', 'face', 'different', 'culture', 'are', 'never', 'more', 'moment', 'thought', 'away', 'bulk', 'film', 'Brooks', 'comely', 'multilingual', 'Indian', 'assistant', 'Maya', 'Sheetal', 'Sheth', 'interviewing', 'people', 'street', 'vast', 'majority', 'whom', 'speak', 'excellent', 'English', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Brooks', 'work', 'apart', 'FINDING', 'NEMO', 'staging', 'pretty', 'unsuccessful', 'standup', 'show', 'illicitly', 'visiting', 'underground', 'Pakistani', 'comics', 'best', 'scenes', 'involve', 'assistant', 'boyfriend', 'jealous', 'insecure', 'lover', 'suspicion', 'fascination', 'western', 'culture', 'mirrored', 'Brooks', 'complex', 'fears', 'potential', 'terrorist', 'reason', 'just', 'boyfriend', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'misunderstanding.This', 'just', 'bit', 'stale', 'end', 'wraps', 'up', 'rather', 'unconvincingly', 'alas', 'Brooks', 'fans', 'should', ""n't"", 'fear', 'man', 'still', 'may', 'need', 'new', 'ideas', 'insights', 'bring', 'back', 'level', 'MODERN', 'ROMANCE', 'DEFENDING', 'YOUR', 'LIFE', 'least', 'got', 'laughing', 'again']",Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World

I think I got arthritis from watching this, that's how painful it was to watch. My joints started swelling and throbbing with each terrible awkward not-funny moment which was definitely meant to make us laugh. The title is misleading as there is only a very small part in it where he interacts with Muslims (happens to be the one funny scene), most of the film takes place in Hindu India, but that's the least of its problems. All in all it's one unfocused mess.The direction, by Brooks, is terrible; scenes go on just that one second too long ending up with Brooks making Brooks look terrible, lost, gasping like a fish on a dock. Even when we are supposed to see that these jokes are awful, the rule remains: you *still* have to make it funny. Simply told bad jokes lay there and really stink up the place, and there is so much lame humor in this that I began to wonder if there was something physically wrong with Brooks himself.His timing, always excellent, is execrable here, completely off. He's not an old man yet though he ambles anciently through this movie like someone who once had something and is now slowly realizing that he no longer knows where it is. What is going on with him? I began to fear that I was watching the end of a career. Clearly, you can't take this film for a laugh, but you certainly can't take it for serious commentary either. I've been a big Albert Brooks fan since Real Life which came out in 1979. That's 28 years ago (he didn't register with me in Taxi so I don't count that). In both drama and comedy he has always been brilliant. My First Mister, a terrific film, was only 6 years ago. I hope this was just a touch of talent indigestion, a bit of spoiled one-liners, an overdone setup, a joke left in the freezer too long, because there's more burps than belly laughs in this dud.",1,"Albert, Dude!

Yes there's a lot of muslims there but most of the people Brooks meet seems to be Hindus. No matter what they are they don't think he's funny. And he isn't. Not in this movie.Initially, most of the jokes are based on how badly planned his trip was. He gets to fly business class instead of first class. Nobody comes to pick him up at the airport so he has to take a cab. His office is small and has no computer, etc. Funny? After that, there is a slightly amusing scene where he has a conversation with his secretary, Maya, and they don't know when the other is joking or not. ""Was that a joke?"". According to his plans, he was supposed to go to Pakistan, but he doesn't get a visa, so he has to cross the border illegally in order to spend a couple of hours there with some would be comedians. This makes Indian and Pakistani intelligence agents suspicious, and there's almost a political conflict. Brooks realises he has failed and goes is sent back to the US. The End. His wife, unaware of his failure, thinks he's a big hero. The political subplot about the conflict Brooks almost caused, is tied up by means of on-screen text before the closing credits. The main plot also goes nowhere. I'm not sure what Brooks tried to do with this movie. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and it doesn't work as a dark comedy nor as a satire. Unfortunately, with this movie, real-life Brooks ends up like on-screen Brooks: trying, but failing, to be funny. ""Is that the joke?"".

The question is, how many friends and relatives can Albert Brooks press into service for those inexplicable five star ratings?The one star reviews state their position quite clearly: ""It wasn't funny.""  Well, comedy has to be the penultimate subjective medium.  More so than beauty, comedy is in the eye of the beholder.  As a confessed ""Fawlty Towers"" fan, I'm the last person to say that everyone should find one thing funny and not another.  All we can do is count the reviews and figure our chances that we might also find it funny.  Applying math to comedy, now that's funny Amazon.It's the five-star reviews to which I take exception.  There are plenty of ""you just didn't 'get' its"".  While potentially true, why post it as a review?  Did it make you feel any better to say ""I'm smarter than you because I know why it's supposed to be funny""?No fewer that three of the dozen or so reviews I read claimed this was a ""thinking man's comedy"".  I was under the impression that people like Mark Russell or Dennis Miller produced ""thinking man's comedy"".  Albert Brooks?  What is this metaphorical man supposed to be thinking?Is there even such a thing as a ""thinking man's comedy""?  Victor Hugo is credited with saying ""the greater the mind, the simpler the pleasures"".  (Well, the equivalent French, anyway.)  Einstein enjoyed raking leaves, for example.  By this measure, a ""thinking man's comedy"" would include Larry, Curly and Moe.  None of that here.I do believe that there is such a thing as thoughtful comedy, and certainly thought-provoking comedy.  This movie is neither of these.Perhaps it's a ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy of cultural errors?  Possibly.  Albert's character made me cringe as he complained and whined about everything from the coach air accommodations to the taxi to the elevator that frightened him with a noise he didn't like.  He whines every step of the way.  I've never seen a more accurate betrayal of the provincial, self-obsessed, winging, entitled and pretentious ugly American.""We are such a great nation that it is impossible to remain humble when abroad.  The world relinquishes its respect for us accordingly.""  Albert Brooks, playing himself, has mastered the role.This move has surpassed ""Ishtar"" as the worst comedy since the creation of the motion picture.  Honestly, it is only AS bad as Ishtar in terms of a near-absolute lack of humor, but it wins walking away because it's premise was so incredibly promising!  Sending an American Jew to figure out what makes a radical Muslim laugh?  Brilliant!I smiled when I first read the title.  I laughed when I read the premise.  I chuckled when Albert did Leno.  Who knew I was done?So, if you loved Ishtar, S*P*Y*S, or City Heat, then this movie might be for you.

994716,A387BD735MI50R,B000FS9FD0,R. Schultz,"[5, 8]","Albert Brooks plays himself in this movie about a comedian hired by a U.S. government agency to gain insights into the Muslim mind by investigating what makes Muslims laugh. Since the U.S. has trouble getting access to any of the more solidly Muslim countries, it ends up sending Brooks to India, where there are still many Muslims living.This premise has all the makings of a hilarious film. Brooks sets himself up in the kind of specific, Seinfeld-like situations in India that ought to produce funny, slice-of-life improbability. He finds himself underfunded and forgotten in bare offices In India, without any guidelines on how to proceed, but with orders to turn in a huge report in just a few weeks. He ends up going out on the streets telling jokes to nonplussed passersby to see if they laugh. This should make us laugh. But instead it all falls flat.Part of the problem is that Brooks adopts a sort of George Costanza/Larry David persona for this role. He makes needless complications for himself by stating definite preferences and insisting on definite accommodations. This sort of eccentric self-assertion works in Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. But it doesn't work here, partly because Brooks' insistences are just too trumped up.Then there is at least one completely embarrassing scene where Brooks assembles some Indians in an auditorium and sets out to entertain them with his stand-up monologue. When he gets virtually no response, he spirals down into an insulting tirade. This tirade isn't as bad as the one Michael Richards (Seinfeld's Kramer) delivered to some African-American hecklers in real life. But it's bad enough.This whole movie strikes the wrong note. I give it 3 stars because Brooks did come up with a clever, promising idea for a movie here. And I think a lot of viewers will be like me and will fill in the blank spots with their own, funnier scenarios. So you will get a comic movie out of this, even if it's spun out of your own imagination.

Brooks doubts if he will be able to come up with enough material for the report. Will he be able to come up with enough jokes to wrestle this 500 pound gorilla and win?Albert Brooks finds himself between movies when he receives a letter from the State Department asking him to meet with a new commission in Washington, DC. He meets with the head of the commission, former Senator Fred Dalton Thompson, and learns the government wants him to travel to India and Pakistan, stay for a month, and learn what makes Muslim people laugh. After he learns the secret, he is to write a 500 page report. His payment for a job well done? The Medal of Freedom. Upon his arrival, he finds it hard to communicate and decides to put on a comedy concert, to help him learn first hand what Muslim people think is funny. Soon, he begins to attract the attention of both the Indian and Pakistani governments.""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"", Albert Brooks' new film, is a better concept than finished film. Brooks is able to mine the material for laughs, but I think any average comedian would be able to achieve the same results. What Brooks brings to the film is his self-effacing persona, his ability to laugh at himself and Hollywood, which is only successful part of the time, leading to an uneven film.A 500 page report? The longest thing he ever wrote was for high school and it didn't even begin to approach 500 pages? Can he even come up with that many jokes? Can he come up with enough jokes to fill a 90 minute film?The set-up is good. Brooks is initially delighted and surprised to receive the invitation from the commission, leading to many amusing jokes about his career, the state of his career, and his life at home. His wife, Laura (Emma Lockhart), an e-Bay-aholic urges him to go to Washington, to find out what they would like him to do.Upon his arrival, he learns his assignment is to travel to India and Pakistan, stay for a month, find out what makes the Muslim people laugh, and write a really long report. Naturally, this sequence delivers a few jokes aimed at the government and sets-up a recurring theme which is, initially, funny, but tires very fast. The fact that the government, in their effort to understand the Muslim population of the World, is attempting to figure out what makes them laugh, is funny, but also scary because it seems so real. Can we really assume this is fictional?500 pages! Brooks has trouble getting his mind around that figure. What can he write to fill 500 pages? Does he even have that much material?The government promises first class transportation and accommodations throughout. When Brooks finds himself wedged next to two escorts from the State Department (John Carroll Lynch and Jon Tenney) in coach, the situation is initially funny. But the more Brooks carries on; the joke loses its impact. When he finds his new office is very run down and ill-equipped (no computer, let alone Wi-Fi), Brooks becomes even more sarcastic. Initially, this is funny, but the more he complains, the more annoying he becomes. He doesn't seem to realize that large numbers of Americans can only make such a trip by traveling in economy next to the crying, coughing children. When he arrives in India, his eyes seem to miss the equally squalid conditions surrounding him. When he complains, he comes to resemble the classic stereotype of the Ugly American.Upon his arrival in New Delhi, the comedian interviews many people interested in becoming his assistant, providing an amusing, yet uneven sequence. Ultimately, he decides upon Maya (Sheetal Sheth, the Indian equivalent of the Julie Haggerty character in most of Brooks' films), an enthusiastic woman who wants to be a journalist. She provides him with a running total of the number of pages completed throughout the film.One page.Soon, Brooks decides to hold a free comedy concert, using all of his material, to help him determine what makes Muslim people laugh. The State Department co-horts find a school auditorium for him to use and Maya prints flyers for them to hand out. On the night of the concert, the auditorium is packed and Brooks begins his routine. Bombing horribly, he decides to check to see how many people speak English. The majority of the attendees raise their hands. He's in trouble. The concert sequence is funny, but only because it goes terribly wrong. When we realize this, and the sequence continues, and continues, and continues, it becomes annoying. The material is bad and when Brooks continues with it, banging us over the head with the joke, it just becomes tedious.Two pages.There are running jokes throughout; the State Department's inability to provide Brooks with anything he needs to complete his assignment, the continuing inability to bridge the communication barrier, Brooks dealing with the Indian population's idea of who is and who isn't famous, etc. Some of these ideas work, briefly, but when Brooks returns to them again and again, they lose a lot of their impact and begin to resemble extended skits on ""Saturday Night Live"", you know, the type that are funny one-joke premises but continue for ten or more minutes?Three pages.The concept of the film is amusing, but I have to wonder if it might have been more successful as a real documentary. The idea of Albert Brooks, as a character, in a fiction film, being played by Albert Brooks, allows the actor to take some critical digs at his career and he does his same shtick, but that's about it. He doesn't get what people are saying to him, leading to his trademark deadpan expression (funny), but then it goes on and on, and on. When he arrives in India, he realizes more people know him as the voice of Nemo's father. Funny, but, again, the joke goes on, and on.By making the film fiction, with Brooks and others playing themselves, yet actors playing his wife, State Department officials, his Indian assistant, etc., the film resembles an extended episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". This isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it were as funny as an episode of the HBO hit, but it isn't. By a long shot.Four pages.At one point, Brooks travels to Pakistan to meet with a group of aspiring comics. This idea is rife with possibilities, but the filmmaker doesn't seem to have the skill to back it up. As he performs his routine, his audience laughs and laughs, but the set-up for this scene robs the laughter of any legitimacy.Five pages.Towards the end of the film, it becomes clear he will never be able to write the 500 hundred page report. Maya indicates he maybe has four or five pages when circumstances force him to leave and return home. A brief Coda indicates that the report was six pages. And he didn't receive the Medal of Freedom. The ending is handled in such an amateurish way, I find it hard to write about. At a certain point, Brooks clearly seems to run out of ideas and the film has to end, so he ends it very quickly, in a way that seems all too forced and rushed. It almost feels like he was embarrassed and wanted to end the film in a hurry. I know I was embarrassed when I watched it.Six pages.Brooks never finishes his report and is unable to wrestle his metaphorical 500 pound gorilla. Brooks' metaphorical gorilla is called ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World.""",2,Brooks Doesn't Find It,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,7405,"['Early', 'Looking', 'Comedy', 'Muslim', 'World',

But frankly, what could have been a really interesting premise dulls itself by relying on smugness and a puzzlingly stunning refusal to go broader. I am not saying that this should have been ""Talladega Nights,"" but someone should have warned Brooks that repeating the same shtick for close to two hours gets tired. In fact, if you're going to be an ""Ugly American,"" at least inject some enthusiasm into the irony. The only actor in ""Muslim World"" who seemed to want to play anything beyond wooden was Sheetal Sheth, who plays the cheery assistant Maya, who unflappably supports Brooks even as he bombs comedic.After that, situations fizzle, flop like fish or just shouldn't have been developed in the first place. Having Brooks' office near a call center was a clever joke...ONCE. After the third repetition if comes off as bad Saturday Night Live material. Same with the anti-Semitic snips. Yes, Albert, you're Jewish. Good for you. Bad for Al-Jezeera. Next? Frankly, there's an early scene where all the government officials gather round Fred Dalton Thompson (playing direct to type as a conservative blow-hard), chuckling smugly to themselves as Brooks has the mission laid out. These folks seem to be the kind of insular clods that ""Muslim World"" is directed towards.

Why did they remake the INLAWS, ours at least BEGS for it!"" and then the casting director mentions that he's a good actor, it's all him saying these things.He obviously KNOWS what's wrong with his comedy routine and the ending of ""Lost in America"" because he WROTE it in the script , along with his characters stubborness to see it.I love the character of Maya, although it will be noted that he has her have a crush on him etc......Of course along the way he pokes fun at the also challenges stereotypes, from the ineptitude of the government, to outsourcing of jobs, the idea of the comedy ""That Darn Jew"" is TOO funny.....and pokes fun at his own reason for doing all of this, in order to get that MEDAL ""That's the NICE one"", and inevitably he accidentally almost causes a war.....It is also about understsanding comedy....Liked how he taught Maya about ""Sarcasm"".....you can't GET a joke unless you understand basic things about it......""It's called the ""Freeway""...but if you don't know what a freeway is or that we have them in California, it won't make any sense.",5,I love this Film!,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,1934,"['am', 'recent', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'movies', 'past', 'currently', 'as', 'well', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'watching', 'movies', 'depict', 'life', 'always', 'unexpected', 'everything', 'last', 'one', 'watched', 'was', 'MOTHER', 'was', 'GREAT.In', 'finally', 'terms', 'Mother', 'therefore', 'now', 'able', 'allow', 'woman', 'be', 'who', 'supporting', 'caring', 'not', 'critical', 'demeaning.And', 'now', 'see', 'result', 'Muslim', 'loving', 'relationship', 'child', 'wife', 'love', 'way', 'them.I', 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'being', 'COMEDIAN', 'own', 'ego', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'fun', 'others', 'too', 'very', 'genuine', 'always', 'remember', 'whatever', 'characters', 'saying', 'really', 'saying', '.when', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'scoffing', 'Why', 'did', 'choose', 'HIM', 'Why', 'did', 'remake', 'INLAWS', 'least', 'BEGS', 'then', 'casting', 'director', 'mentions', 'good', 'actor', 'saying', 'things.He', 'obviously', 'KNOWS', 'what', 'wrong', 'comedy', 'routine', 'ending', 'Lost', 'America', 'WROTE', 'script', 'characters', 'stubborness', 'see', 'it.I', 'love', 'character', 'Maya', 'will', 'be', 'noted', 'have', 'crush', 'etc', 'course', 'way', 'fun', 'also', 'stereotypes', 'ineptitude', 'government', 'outsourcing', 'jobs', 'idea', 'comedy', 'Darn', 'Jew', 'TOO', 'funny', '..and', 'fun', 'own', 'reason', 'doing', 'order', 'get', 'MEDAL', 'NICE', 'one', 'inevitably', 'accidentally', 'almost', 'war', '..It', 'also', 'understsanding', 'comedy', '.Liked', 'how', 'taught', 'Maya', 'Sarcasm', '..you', 'ca', ""n't"", 'GET', 'joke', 'understand', 'basic', 'things', 'called', 'Freeway', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'freeway', 'have', 'California', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense']",Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World
