922899,A1VONCVB0ANIEH,B000A6T22G,B. Wolf,"[0, 0]","To begin with, the DVD has everything it ought too.  The extra's are just right, the selected scenes (pardon my not existing in 1975) all had me chuckling, and the synergistic aspect of Belushi's time and stage presence at SNL can be felt.Only those who had the pleasure of working on SNL (Lemmings to boot) with John Belushi will ever surely know who and what he really was, and for those who are adoring SNL fanaticals, this DVD is a preface.  There's something eerily haunting and sentimental about this DVD, although SNL avoids that as much as possible in most of what they do (aside from the 25th anniversery).  Seeing John Belushi's ""Schiller's Reel"" was, um, disturbing but still hit the mark: ""Why me???? Cause...I'm a dancer!""I must say the two skits, know this is unfair to state but will go ahead doing so anyways, that stand out most in my mind are the ""NBC Star Trek Cancellation"" (Chevy Chase is brilliant in this one as well) and John Belushi singing ""The Wonder Years"" theme song, well before the show ever was.  Another funnybone was the ""Super Hero Halloween Get Together"" with Belushi as The Hulk; and who can forget the breaking the bread over the forehead in addition to slashing down hunks of ham from wall nearby ""Samurai Warrior"" (have I seen real life renditions of this on Food Network...oh wait that's regular chef's on patrol finding stardom not through how the food's prepared, but its scrumtrulescent - Will Ferrel's coining - well, scrumtrulescence!).Above all, my favorite snippet of the DVD in its entirety is the extra featuring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd on the Today Show, where they both come across as engaging, bright, and genuinely funny.  Aykroyd really shines, as you get to see the young Dan Aykroyd full of energy and charisma.  Gene Siskell asks them each toward the end of the segment what they would desire for a one final meal, Belushi: cottage cheese & pineapple plate; Aykroyd: grapefruit juice and celerey (sounds good, I think I'll have to try some)!  Also, if recalled correctly, was Aykroyd selling ""Spies Like Us"" which came out years later to have he and Belushi as original leads?And to think, I grew up loving ""The Great Outdoors"" and ""Ghost Busters"" and never had a clue of how close Aykroyd was to Belushi or how many blazingly genius pieces of comedy they pulled off together, in many instaces, on SNL.There comes a mixed feeling when watching classic moments like these, perhaps a surge of sadness, what with all the horrors worldwide that have happened since 1975 dating SNL's inception, a time when great people were doing creative and downright uplifting things; namely making millions cross-country laugh to a whole new tune.  That's where the celebrity of SNL stands the test of time, and that's what gives one an inkling of hope for the so-called ""New Comedy"" even though it's always buzzing about us, with the majority never heard (some highschool prank) and some never spoken (your grandmothers kitchen).  Sure change is a good thing, and time certainly passes, but because I look back on these skits from never having seen their original airing, writing, and rehearsing, I bear the right to say this much: Long live comedy and acting, and God save us from ""24 hour cable news"" and ""reality T.V.""  Just when did the talented and the erudite lose out to commonality and repetition?  Finally, a personal debt of gratitude to all those mad minds who made SNL a national monument reaching like a beacon straight to higher places!  Amen.

These SNL ""Best of's"" are lots of fun and have a knack for showcasing the moments that had the most bang for the buck. Samurai, Joe Cocker (hilarious over the top Belushi moment, but I'd forgotten how well John SINGS the part!), SNL Update Commentaries, a priceless full performance by the Blues Brothers, and much more. For me, though, the most important parts of this DVD are the incredible extras, including John's screen test  (Brando, etc.), and an appearance with Dan Aykroyd on the Today Show (early 80's) which is one of the more compelling insights into Belushi's off screen personality, and some obvious discomfort in that setting (being interviewed), so Dan takes charge. There is also a great and frank ""tribute/discussion"" with John's wife and SNL team members. I think you'll find it illuminating.

I bought the VHS way back in 1983(so old it's in mono!!!) and was greatly looking forward to hearing the musical performances in 5.1!But....lo & behold... this isn't the entire VHS that was originally released!!! And among the missing parts is THE major reason I was looking forward to the DVD - the single greatest Blues Brothers performance (in my opinion)....B Movie Boxcar Blues!!! I was so disgusted that I have yet to do a skit by skit comparison so am not sure what else is missing but I am certain some comedy skits are missing as well.I also soon realized that there are many new skits as well and one of them is the Samurai Night Fever skit with OJ Simpson. Since this wasn't on the original VHS it can only be an editing decision made after the OJ fiasco. As another reviewer noted, we definitely could have done without this skit and I hope OJ didn't get any proceeds from its addition. In fact the only reason I can think of for its inclusion is the demand for more Samurai skits. But they could have picked from many others, the 2 skits with Frank Zappa conducting his band & The Samurai musician are both priceless and rarely aired.Also, I agree with the reviewer who stated there are better Joe Cocker skits too. In addition to the one mentioned with Joe himself, there is also a hilarious skit with Belushi doing his impersonation along side a female singer (I forget who....Ann Margaret?) and she ends up laughing so hard she can't finish the song!!Bottom line....if you are a fan of Belushi by all means get this!!

922916,AS6SH2JM2YY3H,B000A6T22G,R S Cobblestone,"[1, 1]","One of the wonders of the original five year run of Saturday Night Live was how it served as a launching pad for so many entertainers.  Clearly, John Belushi was one of these.  His performances in The Blues Brothers and Animal House, to name his two biggest hits during that period, were classics that go beyond the slapstick moniker.This little gem, SNL - Best of John Belushi, is best described as ""a taste of Belushi"" (John, not Jim).  As a regular on SNL those first five years, he developed characters and comedic performances that still are popular today (the Blues Brothers).  Others went splat (the Bee Band).  His athleticism, facial expressions, and attention to detail (note the Joe Cocker spoof/imitation) were his strengths.This collection has some favorites... his imitations of rocker Joe Cocker, actress Elizabeth Taylor (the portly version), the Hulk, and his appearances on the SNL news program.  This collection also contains the piece of him as an old man visiting the graves of his former SNL colleagues.  Ironically, he was the first to die.This DVD is a great bargain as a sampler.  If you like what you see, start collecting the complete SNL seasons (seasons 1 and 2 are out at the time of this review).",4,A new slapstick comedian is born.,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,1227,"['One', 'wonders', 'original', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'how', 'served', 'launching', 'pad', 'so', 'many', 'entertainers', 'Clearly', 'John', 'Belushi', 'was', 'one', 'performances', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'Animal', 'House', 'name', 'two', 'biggest', 'hits', 'period', 'were', 'classics', 'go', 'slapstick', 'moniker.This', 'little', 'gem', 'SNL', 'Best', 'John', 'Belushi', 'best', 'described', 'taste', 'Belushi', 'John', 'not', 'Jim', 'regular', 'SNL', 'first', 'five', 'years', 'developed', 'characters', 'comedic', 'performances', 'still', 'are', 'popular', 'today', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'Others', 'went', 'splat', 'Bee', 'Band', 'athleticism', 'facial', 'expressions', 'attention', 'detail', 'note', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'spoof/imitation', 'were', 'strengths.This', 'collection', 'favorites', 'imitations', 'rocker', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'actress', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'portly', 'version', 'Hulk', 'appearances', 'SNL', 'news', 'program', 'collection', 'also', 'piece', 'old', 'man', 'visiting', 'graves', 'former', 'SNL', 'colleagues', 'Ironically', 'was', 'first', 'die.This', 'DVD', 'great', 'bargain', 'sampler', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'start', 'collecting', 'complete', 'SNL', 'seasons', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'are', 'out', 'time', 'review']",SNL - Best of John Belushi
