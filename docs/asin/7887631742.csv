It is an historical epic of gigantic proportions covering about fifty years of Chinese history. The film also serves as a metaphor for the lives of the actors. Viewed without proper insight, the viewer could miss many of the fine qualities associated with this film. The DVD cover attests 1)over 60 Critics had agreed it was one of the year's 10 best films in 1993, 2) it won the prestigious ""Best Picture Honors"" at the Cannes Film Festival, and 3) it won a Golden Globe as best foreign film. The film is highly artistic when viewed from multiple perspectives: the obvious surface view, the delicate and sensitive themes of male friendship/bonding, romantic love, political/historical changes, and the depth of human relationships which are thoroughly explored.It is about the training of young boys to be actors in the Peking Opera Academy which performs classical Chinese opera in large cities during tumultous times in China's history. They perform a classic piece about an Emperor who is deposed and his concubine, who makes the ultimate sacrifice for him: she commits suicide out of love and loyalty. Primarily, the film focuses on the lives of two specific actors, who become best friends from childhood well into adulthood. They suffer severe punishment in their early training for their stage roles and eventually become famous. Each plays one of the starring roles in this classic called ""Farewell My Concubine"" which is a famous and favorite Chinese opera. One plays the Emperor and the other his Concubine. The two actors are inextricably bound as friends and actors due to this Opera. Tensions develop in their adult friendship and relationship because one of them falls in love with a prostitute and marries her. Their relationship is obviously strained due to this marriage but the problems go much deeper. There are political upheavals which cause a great deal of stress and strife in the lives of the Chinese people and the opera performers are forced to perform under circumstances against their wills but they do so - to save their lives. Later, during Mao Tse Tung's ""Cultural Revolution"" - the actors are put on trial for their perceived political stance in the previous regime.The roots of this film run very deep. The film explores risky areas of human relationships, one of which includes male bonding which becomes a deeper same sex love desire that remains unfulfilled. It lasts 172 minutes which is nearly 3 hours, so one must really desire to see it and commit the necessary time for full appreciation. While I liked the film, I will give it only four stars despite the rave reviews by professional critics because some areas could have been cut shorter, without any loss of its artistry or depth.

This movie did all that to me after watching it last night on DVD. Believe me, this is no formulaic, effective-but-conventional tearjerker that you'd cry over only when your brain is on vacation. This movie moves BECAUSE of the intellect--along with intuition. The opening stanzas to this extended score cement the film into the viewer's memory regardless of the pitfalls that would follow. The early scenes encompassing the opera school for boys could stand alone as worthy cinema. The first half is genuine cinema, a riveting drama. The second half is thick with contrived plot devices used to usher in historical pieces.In terms of performance, the three adult leads were adequate. Leslie Cheung was least convincing. His mannerisms, his baby face, his falsetto voice ""mimicked"" a man at odds with his gender and sexuality but I was not completely convinced that there was much inner turmoil within his character. He seemed to use the opium scenes and scenes of overt jealousy towards GongLi's character as psychological crutches, as though he could not realistically play the part of tortured soul unless he was high on drugs or the object of his resentment was directly in front of him. He seemed to sleepwalk through the part as though caught up in a dream state. The character was supposed to literally inhabit the concubine he portrayed. This did not come across well for me. When I reflect upon the character of Dieyi, I recall the boy in the first half and not the adult portrayed by Cheung. The role of Xialou was least demanding and the actor who played him was sufficient to the part. Why he would so easily betroth himself to a former prostitute would have been better conveyed if a stronger sense of suffocation was presented with respects to his relationship with Dieyi.GongLi as the former prostitute is strongest in the movie, excluding the exceptional performance by the child actor who played the young Dieyi. GongLi had plenty of dichotomies and contradictions to play with and she played them well. Her character is simple yet astute, wanting a bland home life yet smartly cornering other characters into her rescuing schemes. She wants to be subservient to Xialou and yet she is firm with him and actually dictates his actions at certain points.

Marren ""jtm497""","[11, 11]","""Farewell My Concubine"" is the shattering story of two stars of the Beijing Opera whose friendship is torn apart by personal betrayals against the backdrop of the political turmoil of 20c. China. Two young boys endure the brutal training at a famous school and emerge as stars, their fame growing from their roles as the general and concubine in the famous opera which lends its name to the movie. The first and perhaps irreparable breach occurs when one marries--it is clear that their relationship runs more deeply than friendship, at least for one of them. But tragic events overcome this very personal crisis as the Japanese invade, the Nationalists repulse them, the Communists rise, and finally the Cultural Revolution destroys these two men, who really care only to practice their art. The opera itself ends up replaying itself over and over in the lives of the main characters.This is a long, difficult but very rewarding film. Made by a Chinese director, it's an authentic, not Westernized, view of Chinese art and society. Beijing opera as an art form is quite inaccessible to Westerners, from the stylized movements, to the crashing cymbals and most of all the screechy sounding singing (at least to our ears). It's hard to understand how young boys could be so moved as to cry as they watch a performance. But after awhile, as the film returns to the same scene over and over, the ritual seemed less alien to me, even beautiful. The film may seem slow at times, and the brutality of the school is hard to watch.

However, I did find that any section was weak or dragged on. For me, it was the brilliant performance by Leslie Cheung as Cheng that kept the film centered. As the violent political atmosphere of China from 1924-1977 throws danger and traps in his path, Cheng clings to and embodies the spirit of the opera. His obsessive nature serves him on his climb to fame and in the end destroys him. Cheung's performance is incredible and I will certainly be watching more of his films.I thought Gong Li's performance was impressive as well. With one look, she is able to convey crushing disappointment and hopelessness. It is heart wrenching.I thought Zhang Fengyi's Xiaolou was a little uneven. His transformation from beginning to end rang a little false and, from what I could understand, didn't quite fit the ""King & Concubine"" theme running through the film.

This is one film that really makes me regret that.In this film, Chen tells a gut-wrenching story of unrequited love, betrayal, and friendship. The story is triumphantly placed against the background of 20th century China, stumbling through decades of change and war. In a testament to his ability, Chen manages to masterfully weave the myriad themes and conflicts of the film into one striking tale. The clash between masculinity and femininity, love and friendship, ideology and survival--all of these and more are deftly engaged by Chen.Every aspect of this film is as near perfect as it could be.The cinematography is simply impeccable, which is really no surprise. Furthermore, the use of color is nothing short of brilliant. The splashes of red in the particularly dreary, gray scenes are particuarly striking. I really cannot give this film enough praise for its direction and cinematography. Chinese beauty Gong Li turns in a stellar performance, matched by those of Leslie Cheung and Zhang Fenyi.Over the years, I have become a Zhang Yimou devotee, and find myself enjoying his films the most.

It is not only the story of some very interesting characters, it is also the story of the Peking Opera as well as modern Chinese history from 1924 to 1977.  It is beautiful and sad and violent and romantic.  And, along the way, I learned a lot about Chinese opera.The performers are all male, and training for the young boys is harsh.  Apprentices start in early childhood.  They are beaten often for such infractions as forgetting their lines.  They are forced to kneel for hours holding up buckets water.  They are stretched into split positions in torturous agony. And yet, as we follow the story of two of these young boys, we come to understand that this horrible treatment resulted in classically trained performers, some of whom rose to great fame.This is the story of two young orphan friends, Dousi and Shitou, played by three sets of actors depicting their childhood, then adolescence, then adulthood (and cast so well that it really seemed like the same actors growing up).  Dousi is more delicate and excels in the role of the concubine.  Shitou is more robust and always plays the king in &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; which is a classic Chinese opera.  It's easy to see that Dousi is in love with Shitou but Shitou favors women and marries a the lovely Juxian, who he meets in a brothel. Immediately, there's a love triangle.All this is set against the backdrop of first the Japanese invasion, then the Nationalist Army and then the Communists.  The characters suffer through all this and adapt and struggle.  There are horrible moments, especially when they renounce each other during the cultural revolution. My emotions were touched by their plight because I really felt I knew each of these people.  I didn't even mind the almost-three-hour-long film because it seemed I was actually living their lives right with them.  And there was no way it could have been told in a shorter time.I loved this film.  It's disturbing, of course.

It is an unbelieveable cinematic achievement, with glorious, exquisite costumes and supreme actors.  It is the story of two boys who grow up to be stars in the Beijing Opera.  One boy plays the King, the other his concubine.  Many men played female roles with great skill, earning them great admiration and honor.Beijing Opera is a very important part of Chinese culture.  From the late 1700's until Mao's Cultural Revolution in the 60's, whole towns would thrill to the arrival of the stars.  The performance included dazzling acrobatics, sumptuous costumed court ladies, generals, gods, scholars, and warriors.  Today, Beijing Opera is not as popular.  Although it is shown on state-run Chinese television, it is difficult to compete with more modern entertainment such as movies, sports, and the Internet.  Like other ancient arts, Beijing Opera will fade away without support.  Farewell My Concubine brings it back to life in such a stunning manner, you will weep to see this art revived to it's former glory.The beginning of the movie deals with the boys' difficult childhood.  They are being trained by a master of opera.  The master's methods may seem harsh, but he really wants the best for the boys' futures.  Mostly street orphans, the master knows that the only future they may have is actors in the Opera.  However, the master cannot protect young Douzi from the pedophiliac clutches of a wealthy patron of the troupe.  These early scenes are very difficult to watch, but they set the stage for the tragic character Douzi grows up into.  Douzi's adult name is Dieyi, his friend Shitou becomes Xiaolou.Gong Li is the only actress in this male-dominated film.  She gives a great performance, per usual.  She plays a street-smart prostitute who contrives to marry Xiaolo, so she can escape life in the brothel.  There is instant, intense competition and hatred between her and Dieyi over Xiaolou.You cannot watch this movie without weeping.  It deserved the Palm D'Or it received at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.  You will have a new appreciation for Chinese culture, and especially for Chinese Opera after watching this film.

489130,A12A08OL0TZY0W,7887631742,Luc REYNAERT,"[0, 0]","In this movie based on Lilian Lee's masterpiece, Chen Kaige has mainly developed the evolution of the 'sentimental' link between two actors (one gay one) through the turbulent history of China in the 20th century, with the fall of the Empire, the Japanese occupation, the civil war, the communist victory and the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese opera ""Farewell My Concubine"" functions marvelously as a leitmotiv. The sentimental relationship between the two actors, and later with the lover of one of them played superbly by Gong Li, will be seriously shaken during the political earthquakes. Although 'everyone should be responsible for his own fate', everybody, if he isn't strong enough physically or psychologically, could be forced to betray his friend by false accusations, particularly during violent public interrogations.The political message of the film can be summarized by the slogan: 'Cursed are the tyrants who plunge their people into misery.'With unforgettable scenes, like the abandonment of a child by his mother, the rigorous training of the young aspirant-actors, the public political trials or the meeting of 'old friends', Chen Kaige translated perfectly in moving pictures (with sublime color grading) Lilian Lee's text.Nevertheless, Lilian Lee's book transcends all personal relationships with her sublime meditations on art, the artist, individual life, love, death and politics.One example from the book: in the ordinary world, victory and defeat, life or death are only during the time of a wink. But art and artists are not part of this world, where politics with its slogan 'kill or be killed' only sow pain, suffering and misery.Through art, the spectators escape during the spectacle for a few hours the harsh reality of life and enter into a world of dreams and deepest emotions, which are embodied in the actors (of Chinese operas).This movie is a must see for all lovers of world cinema.",5,Everyone should be responsible for his own fate,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,1922,"['movie', 'based', 'Lilian', 'Lee', 'masterpiece', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'mainly', 'developed', 'evolution', ""'sentimental"", 'link', 'two', 'actors', 'one', 'gay', 'one', 'turbulent', 'history', 'China', '20th', 'century', 'fall', 'Empire', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'civil', 'war', 'communist', 'victory', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'Chinese', 'opera', 'Farewell', 'My', 'Concubine', 'functions', 'marvelously', 'leitmotiv', 'sentimental', 'relationship', 'two', 'actors', 'later', 'lover', 'one', 'played', 'superbly', 'Gong', 'Li', 'will', 'be', 'seriously', 'shaken', 'political', 'earthquakes', ""'everyone"", 'should', 'be', 'responsible', 'own', 'fate', 'everybody', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'could', 'be', 'forced', 'betray', 'friend', 'false', 'accusations', 'particularly', 'violent', 'public', 'interrogations.The', 'political', 'message', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'slogan', ""'Cursed"", 'are', 'tyrants', 'who', 'plunge', 'people', 'misery', 'unforgettable', 'scenes', 'abandonment', 'child', 'mother', 'rigorous', 'training', 'young', 'aspirant-actors', 'public', 'political', 'trials', 'meeting', ""'old"", 'friends', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'translated', 'perfectly', 'moving', 'pictures', 'sublime', 'color', 'grading', 'Lilian', 'Lee', 'text.Nevertheless', 'Lilian', 'Lee', 'book', 'personal', 'relationships', 'sublime', 'meditations', 'art', 'artist', 'individual', 'life', 'love', 'death', 'politics.One', 'example', 'book', 'ordinary', 'world', 'victory', 'defeat', 'life', 'death', 'are', 'only', 'time', 'wink', 'art', 'artists', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'world', 'where', 'politics', 'slogan', 'be', 'killed', 'only', 'sow', 'pain', 'suffering', 'misery.Through', 'art', 'spectators', 'escape', 'spectacle', 'few', 'hours', 'harsh', 'reality', 'life', 'enter', 'world', 'dreams', 'deepest', 'emotions', 'are', 'embodied', 'actors', 'Chinese', 'operas', '.This', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'lovers', 'world', 'cinema']",N/A

I don't understand the Chinese language but I wanted to rewind the film to listen to the sound of her speech.I do feel as if I was misled by the blurbs on the box. This is a highly violent and disturbing movie, especially in the beginning when we are witnessing severe child abuse, over and over again.

There is also a bloody incident where a wooden tool is placed in the mouth of  the transvestite character and wiggled around until he bleeds.

As an adult, I was bothered by the unneccesary violence. It does not mesh with what I've read about the high value placed by Chinese upon their male children.Ironically the invading army scenes were not as violent as the acting school scenes, given that the Japanese committed such inhumane atrocities in 1930s China.  Also, it was unbelievable that the characters found a male baby left outside the city wall to die, when it reality, female infanticide is more likely.The costumes in this film are spectacular.  And  I thought the film moved well through the various eras, first the Warlord era, then invasion by the Japanese, then the Nationalists, then the Communists.  I think it gave a good sense of the public humiliation and blacklisting done during the &quot;Cultural Revolution.&quot;I saw this film with English subtitles, which seem to aptly reflect what's going on  in most cases.

From the beginning, the acting, directing, sets, costumes, and overall majesty of the movie had me convinced that this was time well-spent.  I was a little lost initially as I followed the story of two boys in China who suffer through their determined goal to become opera stars.  However, as the years of beatings and suffering unfolded in their acting school, I realized just what an obsession that our two main characters had.  As the movie progressed, it was interesting how each of the two dealt with their common obsession.  To further illustrate this, a third person gets involved in their lives and we see how the three different persons handle their own obsessions; to what extent they will go to preserve or obtain what they want the most.  Ultimately, this was the imagery I took away from ""Farewell My Concubine"".  While I did not always accept the outcome of these and other individuals, the movie challenged me to dwell on what I had seen.For me, the additional impact of ""Farewell My Concubine""  was the portrayal of the history of China from the era of the warlords through the post ""Gang of Four"" era.  With each change in between we are given a telling glimpse of its' impact on the people of China.  Of special interest for me was the focus of the various phases of the communist rule such as the initial asumption of power to through the cultural revolution to the near present.  I found myself reflecting on ""The Last Emperor"" and ""One Man's Bible"".  The former, a movie, did a tremendous job of bringing this same history to life but weakened when dealing with Communist China.  The latter, a book by Gao Xingjian, focussed primarily of the different phases of the communist rule.  ""Farewell My Concubine"" falls somewhere in between those two for revealing what China went through in the 20th Century.  As a history buff, I appreciated that.""Farewell My Concubine"" is nearly a 3 hour movie in Chinese with subtitles.  I did not think it overly long although I sometimes wondered where it was headed.  Perhaps the early days may have stretched out a bit but then I might not have cracked up at the line ""Who gave you permission to stand?"".  Sometimes it's hard to truly appreciate a movie that leaves you with a depressing feeling.  One man weathered everything for something that meant so much to him.

Even though I had not slept the night before and had a very nerve racking day ahead of me, i was completely enveloped and forgot about everything else. It is brutal in its realism, especially towards the cruel treatment that the young boys are subjected to. The actors are perfectly cast, with Leslie Cheung playing the effeminate Douzi to perfection. Indeed, when he is fully dressed in his opera regalia he appears totally androgynous. You just wouldn't know. I will not be buying this dvd because it has many important scenes cut out, presumably to make it easier on western viewers.  I have a vested interest in Beijing opera and yet many of those scenes were cut.

489145,A1OEKU0BVKLMHG,7887631742,"Sharon Shurley ""Feekie""","[2, 2]","Before seeing Leslie Cheung in Farewell My Concubine, I had seen him in approximately a dozen other movies, playing everything from macho police cadet to romantic hero to gay gigolo.  He was equally impressive in each of these roles.  But when I saw him portray Dousi in Farewell My Concubine, I saw the true extent of his brilliance.  I can't imagine that anyone else could have portrayed this role so convincingly.  Other reviewers have explained the story far better than I can, so I will not bore you with those details.However, for me, the major theme of this movie is betrayal.  Dousi (Cheung) is the soft, effeminate, sensitive one who plays the part of the Concubine to his longtime friend, (Zhang Fengi's) Shitou's macho role of the King in the opera which defines their lives from the age of 16 until their 40's. The title of the movie takes its name from the opera for which they are famous, ""Farewell My Concubine.""  Although it is Shitou who is portrayed as the strong masculine partner, it is Dousi who shows the greatest courage and self-sacrifice in the face of danger and loss throughout all the years he and Shitou are together as friends and acting partners.  It is obvious that Dousi has a deep love for Shitou both as a friend and as a soulmate.  However, Shitou is attracted only to women and sees Dousi as a friend and acting partner only. Yet,  he is not above exploiting Dousi's love for him for his own benefit. Although Shitou does have a feeling of friendship to Dousi and cares about him in his own way, Shitou is often callous and insensitive to Dousi. He is betrayed on numerous occasions by both Shitou and the woman Shitou marries.  However, it is Shitou's ultimately selfish and cruel betrayal of Dousi after the Japanese occupation of China that you see the depth of Shitou's cowardice.  Seemingly, without hesitation, he abandons Dousi by telling lies and saying and doing whatever he thinks is necessary to save himself from the Japanese officers' wrath.  With great loyalty and love, Dousi remains silent and courageously faces the ensuing consequences rather than risk harm to his beloved Shitou.Since the movie takes place over a period of approximately 40 years, there are a lot of political changes which take place in China during this time frame.  However, even if you are not familiar with China's history, it is explained well enough that you will not be confused.  The movie is visually stunning and the acting superb.  Still, it is Leslie Cheung's portrayal of Dousi, the ""concubine,"" which makes this movie worth seeing and owning.  I was surprised that the movie's length is approximately 3 hours long, because it moves along so swiftly yet effortlessly.  Leslie Cheung's performance is heart-breaking and made even more so given his later real-life suicide.  I can't help but feel that, at least part of the time, we are seeing the ""real"" Leslie Cheung onscreen and not just the part he is playing.  The movie is beautiful and moving and artistic.

Flanagan,"[0, 0]","Not since Lawrence of Arabia has a film so successfully fused the personal with the epic, the grand drama of history with the melodrama of personal lives.  And I use the word ""melodrama"" in the best sense - not as a pejorative for excessive affect, but in its older meaning, to connote an emotional story distilled to its most potent, primal form.Although it is easy (and not entirely incorrect) to assign significance to the subtext of sexual repression in China (sex and sexual abuse in many forms underlies nearly every important development in the film), it is only a small part of a much larger design.  Modern China's identity crisis runs far deeper than the film's surface themes. It is a reflection of a larger human failing to find social and moral codes that work. From before the Second World War to the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, China and her people were whipsawed between various brands of hedonism and oppression, individualism with its attendant chaos and tyrannical conformity with its rigidly enforced social order. In the Dickensian story of two orphaned boys forced into servitude with a Beijing Opera troupe, it finds an uncanny metaphor in their struggle for personal identity, and against the repression of their own natures imposed by both internal and external forces.Shitou is reared from childhood to play the king in the highly stylized traditional opera from which the film takes its title. He is by nature a sensualist, drinker, womanizer, and scoundrel.  He has also been molded, initially quite against his will, in the role of a celebrity - a beloved star and public face of China's high culture. His girlfriend Juxian (Gong Li) is a prostitute, to whom he almost accidentally proposes, making her (and himself) ""legitimate"" to the masses when he marries her.Douzi is his acting partner, a homosexual who plays the role of the king's suicidal concubine in the same opera.  As in Elizabethan England, only men were traditionally allowed on-stage, so, in a sense, Douzi's role was also forced upon him - although the film strongly suggests that his sexuality was more a matter of nature than nurture (he was born with an extra finger, to symbolize that he was always ""different"" from the others). Ironically, he must hide his true sexual orientation from an adoring public, even as the unrequited love for his co-star brilliantly informs his performance as the concubine.As we follow the men's struggles throughout China's tumultuous journey into the modern world, it becomes apparent that they have accepted and even embraced the roles that were initially foisted upon them by circumstance.  We come to realize that they may very well have chosen them, had they been given the freedom to do so. At the center is the romantic triangle between Shitou, Douzi, and Juxian.All of which brilliantly sets the stage for one of the saddest third acts in cinema, in which the lines between free will and determinism, the necessity of circumstance and the will of the inner self, will blur, cross, and cross again.  Each of the three main characters will betray and publicly denounce the others in order to survive, will claim allegiance to one revolution or another, and perhaps even mean it for a time, to stay the hands of the revolutionaries, whose shifting ideologies by turns celebrate and threaten each of them.In lesser hands such a story would be trite, morbid, and - well - melodramatic, in the bad sense of the word.  But director Chen Kaige has a unique personal connection with the material, in that he denounced his own father during the Cultural Revolution - an act which he bitterly regretted later. It is therefore with sympathy and genuine compassion that he tells his tale, rather than cheap sentiment or maudlin histrionics.When made poorly a tale like this is insufferably turgid, awash with treacly tears. When made well - with care, precision, and truth - it is breathtaking.This is my favorite Chinese film.",5,One of the great films of China,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,3963,"['Not', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'film', 'so', 'successfully', 'fused', 'personal', 'epic', 'grand', 'drama', 'history', 'melodrama', 'personal', 'lives', 'use', 'word', 'melodrama', 'best', 'sense', 'not', 'pejorative', 'excessive', 'affect', 'older', 'meaning', 'connote', 'emotional', 'story', 'distilled', 'most', 'potent', 'primal', 'easy', 'not', 'entirely', 'incorrect', 'assign', 'significance', 'subtext', 'sexual', 'repression', 'China', 'sex', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'many', 'forms', 'underlies', 'nearly', 'important', 'development', 'film', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'design', 'Modern', 'China', 'identity', 'crisis', 'far', 'deeper', 'film', 'surface', 'themes', 'reflection', 'larger', 'human', 'failing', 'find', 'social', 'moral', 'codes', 'work', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'aftermath', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'China', 'people', 'were', 'whipsawed', 'various', 'brands', 'hedonism', 'oppression', 'individualism', 'attendant', 'chaos', 'tyrannical', 'conformity', 'rigidly', 'enforced', 'social', 'order', 'Dickensian', 'story', 'two', 'orphaned', 'boys', 'forced', 'servitude', 'Beijing', 'Opera', 'troupe', 'uncanny', 'metaphor', 'struggle', 'personal', 'identity', 'repression', 'own', 'natures', 'imposed', 'internal', 'external', 'forces.Shitou', 'reared', 'childhood', 'play', 'king', 'highly', 'stylized', 'traditional', 'opera', 'film', 'title', 'nature', 'sensualist', 'drinker', 'womanizer', 'scoundrel', 'also', 'been', 'molded', 'initially', 'quite', 'will', 'role', 'celebrity', 'beloved', 'star', 'public', 'face', 'China', 'high', 'culture', 'girlfriend', 'Juxian', 'Gong', 'Li', 'prostitute', 'whom', 'almost', 'accidentally', 'making', 'legitimate', 'masses', 'when', 'her.Douzi', 'acting', 'partner', 'homosexual', 'who', 'role', 'king', 'suicidal', 'concubine', 'same', 'opera', 'Elizabethan', 'England', 'only', 'men', 'were', 'traditionally', 'allowed', 'on-stage', 'so', 'sense', 'Douzi', 'role', 'was', 'also', 'forced', 'film', 'strongly', 'sexuality', 'was', 'more', 'matter', 'nature', 'nurture', 'was', 'born', 'extra', 'finger', 'symbolize', 'was', 'always', 'different', 'others', 'Ironically', 'must', 'hide', 'true', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'adoring', 'public', 'even', 'unrequited', 'love', 'co-star', 'brilliantly', 'performance', 'concubine.As', 'follow', 'men', 'struggles', 'China', 'tumultuous', 'journey', 'modern', 'world', 'apparent', 'have', 'accepted', 'even', 'embraced', 'roles', 'were', 'initially', 'foisted', 'circumstance', 'come', 'realize', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'chosen', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'freedom', 'do', 'so', 'center', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'Shitou', 'Douzi', 'Juxian.All', 'brilliantly', 'stage', 'one', 'saddest', 'third', 'acts', 'cinema', 'lines', 'free', 'will', 'determinism', 'necessity', 'circumstance', 'will', 'inner', 'self', 'will', 'blur', 'cross', 'cross', 'again', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'will', 'betray', 'publicly', 'denounce', 'others', 'order', 'survive', 'will', 'claim', 'allegiance', 'one', 'revolution', 'perhaps', 'even', 'mean', 'time', 'stay', 'hands', 'revolutionaries', 'shifting', 'ideologies', 'turns', 'celebrate', 'threaten', 'them.In', 'lesser', 'hands', 'such', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'trite', 'morbid', 'well', 'melodramatic', 'bad', 'sense', 'word', 'director', 'Chen', 'Kaige', 'unique', 'personal', 'connection', 'material', 'denounced', 'own', 'father', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'act', 'bitterly', 'regretted', 'later', 'therefore', 'sympathy', 'genuine', 'compassion', 'tale', 'rather', 'cheap', 'sentiment', 'maudlin', 'histrionics.When', 'made', 'poorly', 'tale', 'insufferably', 'turgid', 'awash', 'treacly', 'tears', 'When', 'made', 'well', 'care', 'precision', 'truth', 'breathtaking.This', 'favorite', 'Chinese', 'film']",N/A

489153,AVQ7GNVHX9HU3,7887631742,Wu Yuan,"[15, 15]","China had been through so many dramatic social transforms during the last century, from the feudal dynasty, the warlord period, the Japanese invasion, Republic of China, communism, Cultural Revolution to the current era. It took a lot of top talents from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to make the movie &quot;Farewell my concubine&quot;, which brilliantly tells these transforms from the tragic story of two opera performers.&quot;Farewell my concubine&quot; is a famous story in the Chinese history. It tells that after the misrule of the Qin dynasty, two main forces rose to compete with each other for the reign. One is called Han, which is led by Liu Bang, a subtle and somewhat unfaithful man, and the other, Chu, led by the bold Xiang Yu (the King), who had peerless courage. In the decisive battle, the army of Chu was severely beaten. The King was trapped with remaining troop and little grain. The defeat was doomed. At the night, Hang's troop started to sing Chu's folk songs all around to make Chu's soldiers forgo their fighting spirit. Hearing the homeland's folk songs when the King was drinking, he sighed to his beloved concubine Yuji woefully: &quot;My strength can uproot mountains; my courage is peerless in the country. But the fate is not on my side; even my black steed would not run away to save its life. What should I do with you?&quot; Yuji danced for the King for the last time and sang in tears: &quot;Hang's troops have taken the field, Chu's songs are all around. As your Highness's courage is over, why should this humble concubine value her own life any more?&quot; The song ceased; she suddenly pulled out the King's sword and took her own life. On the following day, it came the final bout. The King, unable to accept the loss of honour, refused to cross the Great River to return to his homeland defeated. He fought to the last man and killed himself beside the river. The story of &quot;Farewell my concubine&quot; itself is just as famous as the war between Chu and Hang if not more. It has been recited again and again by generations through fictions, storytellers, operas, etc.The movie started from 1924 in Beijing. A whore took her son (Chen Dieyi) to the opera school to ask the instructor to keep her son. But the instructor refused as the boy had six fingers on his right hand. In the cold winter, his mother chopped off the extra finger when his hands are frozen to numb. From there started the doomed tragic life of the boy. For having a feminal figure, he was trained to act female roles. In the school, Chen formed a close friendship with his senior Duan Xiaolou, who was trained to perform masculine roles. Chen had a hard time to accept being female in the opera at first. After rigorous and sometimes torturous training, he was eventually forced to admit the female role, but also became mixed up between opera and the real life.After years, both of them became famous for the show &quot;Farewell my concubine&quot;, in which Duan played the King and Chen played the concubine Yuji. But in real life, Chen was also obsessed by Duan, who had only brotherhood feeling towards him in return. Life went on well until the day Duan announced the decision to marry a whore named Juxian. Chen detested the matter for his dream of performing intimately with Duan for the whole life was ruined. He brought a real sword to Duan, telling him to perform separately in the future.During the Japanese occupation of Beijing, Duan was arrested after a conflict with the Japanese soldiers in a performance. Juxian begged Chen to save Duan and as an exchange she would go back to the whorehouse. After being released, Duan despised Chen for performing for the Japanese. Juxian also ate her own words and kept Duan from performing again. At that time Chen's fame was at the climax. But the emptiness in his heart led him to opium.When the old instructor came to know that the two separated, he summoned them and scolded harshly. Feeling shamed at the master's words, the two started perform together again.After the anti-Japanese war, the lives of opera performers were no better. Once the soldiers were making passes at Chen during a performance. Duan could not stand it and the soldiers beat the performers. Pregnant Juxian lost her child in the fight and Chen was arrested for performing for the Japanese before. Duan and Juxian tried to save Chen, but disheartened Chen refused to cooperate in the court. When Duan was helpless, the court surprisingly announced the suspension of the case for a high official secretly wanted Chen to perform for him.After the PRC was founded, during a performance for the PLA, Chen suddenly lost his voice due to overdose of opium. They apologized; expecting angry boos from the audience. But to their surprise, the PLA applauded warmly. They suddenly found that the whole world has changed overnight. Chen decided to quit opium and start a refreshed life. As they are consulted on the modern form of Beijing opera, Chen, over-obsessed by the opera, spoke out his opinions sharply on the shortcomings of the modern opera, for which he was regarded at backwardness at that time. Eventually he was dropped from the cast just before a performance, which broke the new dream he only just built up.In the Culture Revolution, Duan was forced to confess the &quot;guilt&quot; of Chen. Stricken by the shock, Chen revealed the &quot;guilt&quot; of Juxian. Duan was again forced to admit: &quot;She is a whore. I don't love her.&quot; Juxian lost all hope and hang herself in her red bridal dress.After 11 years and the end of the 22-year separation on the stage, the two performers came back to an empty stage to perform &quot;Farewell my concubine&quot; one last time. Concubine Yuji: &quot;Your Highness, please confer me with the sword&quot;. The King: &quot;My concubine, no, don't take your life lightly.&quot; Chen pulled out the sword, the real blade that symbols the long relationship of the two, and ended his own tragic life in his broken dream.",5,Farewell my concubine,1007856000,"12 9, 2001",2001,6022,"['China', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'dramatic', 'social', 'transforms', 'last', 'century', 'feudal', 'dynasty', 'warlord',
