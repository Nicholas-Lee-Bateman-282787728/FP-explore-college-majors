It can also provide you with plenty of questions --and maybe some reassurances-- about the nature of obligations and how we define ""family"".At the start of the movie, the central character (Lucky, a 10-year old boy, is awaiting his mother's return to the Zulu village where he lives in South Africa. She returns in casket, dead from an acute illness that is not named (but is presumably AIDS). Lucky's father is already absent at this point, and the arrangement his mother has made with his uncle in the city (apparently Johannesburg) rapidly fails under the strain of the uncle's flaws. Lucky's fate ultimately depends on an elderly Hindi neighbor who first views him with fear, the man who denies being his father and an underperforming social services system.The writing and acting in this film are spare and understated, the music evocative and the conflicts are many: generational, racial and ethical. Lucky is told --and later repeats-- that ""adults lie...to survive"". The pathos in this movie that results from these lies is sharp-edged, as a 10-year old must make decisions on his own when those lies eliminate his options.Director Avie Luthre had options of his own in how to end this movie. I applaud the choice of the ambiguity, that leaves us with both hope and doubt as the screen goes black.Awesome flick!Note: I received this movie at no cost for review purposes.",5,"Stunning examinations of loss, obligation, age and race...",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,1487,"['summer', 'approaches', 'Lucky', 'can', 'offer', 'welcome', 'shelter', 'onslaught', 'comic-book', 'themed', 'action', 'flicks', 'can', 'also', 'provide', 'plenty', 'questions', 'maybe', 'reassurances', 'nature', 'obligations', 'how', 'define', 'family', 'start', 'movie', 'central', 'character', 'Lucky', '10-year', 'old', 'boy', 'awaiting', 'mother', 'return', 'Zulu', 'village', 'where', 'South', 'Africa', 'casket', 'dead', 'acute', 'illness', 'not', 'named', 'presumably', 'AIDS', 'Lucky', 'father', 'already', 'absent', 'point', 'arrangement', 'mother', 'made', 'uncle', 'city', 'apparently', 'Johannesburg', 'rapidly', 'strain', 'uncle', 'flaws', 'Lucky', 'fate', 'ultimately', 'elderly', 'Hindi', 'neighbor', 'who', 'first', 'fear', 'man', 'who', 'being', 'father', 'underperforming', 'social', 'services', 'system.The', 'writing', 'acting', 'film', 'are', 'spare', 'understated', 'music', 'evocative', 'conflicts', 'are', 'many', 'generational', 'racial', 'ethical', 'Lucky', 'told', 'later', 'repeats', 'adults', 'lie', 'survive', 'pathos', 'movie', 'results', 'lies', 'sharp-edged', '10-year', 'old', 'must', 'make', 'decisions', 'own', 'when', 'lies', 'eliminate', 'options.Director', 'Avie', 'Luthre', 'had', 'options', 'own', 'how', 'end', 'movie', 'applaud', 'choice', 'ambiguity', 'hope', 'doubt', 'screen', 'black.Awesome', 'flick', 'Note', 'received', 'movie', 'cost', 'review', 'purposes']",N/A

Lucky is a young black boy and the video opens with his deceased mother being brought back to his small Zulu village for burial. While it is not explicitly stated, it is fairly clear that she died of AIDS, something that is very common throughout most of the African continent. With an estimated 18% of the young adult population of South Africa infected with the HIV virus and neighboring Swaziland having a rate estimated at 26%, there is a large number of AIDS orphans in that area. One of the most incredible statistics is that there is an estimated 1.9 million AIDS orphans in South Africa alone, so in this respect the story of Lucky is one shared by many other children. Some knowledge of this sad fact helps the viewer better understand some aspects of the movie, especially the scene where someone takes responsibility for him.Once his mother is buried, Lucky is sent off to the city to live with his uncle. His mother has given the uncle money so that Lucky can go to school, something that he very much wants to do. He craves an education and promises on his mother's grave that he will succeed. After traveling to the city Lucky discovers that his uncle will be of no help to him, the uncle is a greedy man interested only in himself and his hedonistic impulses.Shortly after arriving, Lucky witnesses some black children harassing an elderly Indian woman that is trying to get some water from a community tap. She curses the children, calling them ""Black dogs"" as she goes back to her apartment without water. Seeing this, Lucky gets a bucket and fills it with water, carrying it to the woman.Her first reaction to Lucky is one of dislike and mistrust, although she does accept the water. To understand this it is necessary to know something about the history of racial animosity between the black Africans and Asians in South Africa. In the old apartheid system, the approximately 2% of the population that was Indian were often classified as ""colored"" and given privileges denied the blacks, leading to tensions between them.As the Indian woman begins to understand how Lucky is being treated, her prejudices begin to fall and a slow process of friendship and surrogate parenting begins. As Lucky pursues his goals of simply surviving and getting educated, there are references to the long struggle against apartheid.  There are people that just want to put that chapter behind them and stay uninvolved with most of what is now happening. To understand this it is necessary to know something about the violence and deaths that took place in South Africa as people struggled to overturn the apartheid system. There were riots with strong government reaction and an armed insurrection.The main characters are brilliantly portrayed and it is clear that Sihle Dlamani, the actor that played Lucky, is a rising star. There is no question that director Avie Luthra is correct when stating that Dlamani is a natural. The viewer cannot help but empathize with the plight of Lucky as he bounces around, at times homeless but never losing sight of his goals. The ending is not explicitly a happy one, yet there is much that can be implicitly concluded.",5,"Intense story of the life of an orphan in South Africa, his struggle for a place where he can pursue his goals of an education",1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,3265,"['Understanding', 'video', 'much', 'easier', 'know', 'something', 'history', 'nation', 'South', 'Africa', 'Lucky', 'young', 'black', 'boy', 'video', 'deceased', 'mother', 'being', 'brought', 'back', 'small', 'Zulu', 'village', 'burial', 'not', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'fairly', 'clear', 'died', 'AIDS', 'something', 'very', 'common', 'most', 'African', 'continent', 'estimated', '18', '%', 'young', 'adult', 'population', 'South', 'Africa', 'infected', 'HIV', 'virus', 'neighboring', 'Swaziland', 'having', 'rate', 'estimated', '26', '%', 'large', 'number', 'AIDS', 'orphans', 'area', 'One', 'most', 'incredible', 'statistics', 'estimated', '1.9', 'million', 'AIDS', 'orphans', 'South', 'Africa', 'alone', 'so', 'respect', 'story', 'Lucky', 'one', 'shared', 'many', 'other', 'children', 'knowledge', 'sad', 'fact', 'viewer', 'better', 'understand', 'aspects', 'movie', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'responsibility', 'him.Once', 'mother', 'buried', 'Lucky', 'sent', 'off', 'city', 'live', 'uncle', 'mother', 'given', 'uncle', 'money', 'Lucky', 'can', 'go', 'school', 'something', 'very', 'much', 'do', 'education', 'promises', 'mother', 'grave', 'will', 'succeed', 'traveling', 'city', 'Lucky', 'uncle', 'will', 'be', 'help', 'uncle', 'greedy', 'man', 'interested', 'only', 'hedonistic', 'impulses.Shortly', 'arriving', 'Lucky', 'black', 'children', 'harassing', 'elderly', 'Indian', 'woman', 'trying', 'get', 'water', 'community', 'tap', 'children', 'calling', 'Black', 'dogs', 'back', 'apartment', 'water', 'Seeing', 'Lucky', 'bucket', 'water', 'carrying', 'woman.Her', 'first', 'reaction', 'Lucky', 'one', 'dislike', 'mistrust', 'accept', 'water', 'understand', 'necessary', 'know', 'something', 'history', 'racial', 'animosity', 'black', 'Africans', 'Asians', 'South', 'Africa', 'old', 'apartheid', 'system', 'approximately', '2', '%', 'population', 'was', 'Indian', 'were', 'often', 'classified', 'colored', 'given', 'privileges', 'denied', 'blacks', 'leading', 'tensions', 'them.As', 'Indian', 'woman', 'understand', 'how', 'Lucky', 'being', 'treated', 'prejudices', 'begin', 'fall', 'slow', 'process', 'friendship', 'surrogate', 'parenting', 'Lucky', 'pursues', 'goals', 'simply', 'surviving', 'getting', 'educated', 'are', 'references', 'long', 'struggle', 'apartheid', 'are', 'people', 'just', 'want', 'put', 'chapter', 'stay', 'uninvolved', 'most', 'what', 'now', 'happening', 'understand', 'necessary', 'know', 'something', 'violence', 'deaths', 'took', 'place', 'South', 'Africa', 'people', 'struggled', 'overturn', 'apartheid', 'system', 'were', 'riots', 'strong', 'government', 'reaction', 'armed', 'insurrection.The', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'clear', 'Sihle', 'Dlamani', 'actor', 'played', 'Lucky', 'rising', 'star', 'question', 'director', 'Avie', 'Luthra', 'correct', 'when', 'stating', 'Dlamani', 'natural', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'empathize', 'plight', 'Lucky', 'around', 'times', 'homeless', 'never', 'losing', 'sight', 'goals', 'ending', 'not', 'explicitly', 'happy', 'one', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'implicitly', 'concluded']",N/A
1602486,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B009V1934I,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 1]","Love, loss, and the kindness of strangers is the best way to describe the magnificent movie Lucky. If, like me, you were hesitant to slip this film into the DVD player, make the leap, it is so rewarding and so much better than I ever expected.At its core this is a sad film. The film opens with Lucky wandering around his village. It appears at first as if he is a homeless boy that doesn't fit in anywhere. Quietly and gradually, we get to know more about Lucky. Eventually we find that his mother has just died and he is now completely alone in the world. The film moves forward from this moment, through the eyes of young Lucky. The world isn't seen as evil or dealing him an awful life. Instead he promises his mother he will go to school and study hard. In that sense the film is incredibly positive.I loved this film so much. It grabbed me from the start. There is very little dialog. The music is beautiful and subtle, enhancing the film at every turn. The characters are so well cast. This film owes everything to the lead character, Lucky, played by Sihle Dlamini. He is a handsome young man, with incredible facial expressions and a sense of timing other actors can only hope for. I loved every minute he was on screen. Jayashree Basavaraj, a relatively famous Indian actress, plays Padma, the stranger that gives Lucky more kindness than anybody should ever give. The rest of the cast was amazing.The film succeeds on so many levels. Of course there is the back drop of South Africa and the Black Death that is decimating the population. The film never becomes political. It has a larger universal feel, something everybody can understand, that huge loss when somebody we love dies; the great feeling of love for that person even after they are gone; the great feeling of void when you have nobody; and the incredible kindness that people can give even though they might eat black dogs with curry. No this wasn't another documentary about South Africa, it was a tender eloquent story about a young man and how he rises above his situation.The film is not rated. It would be acceptable for mature younger viewers around the R rated age group. There was a scene viewed from another room of a couple clearly having sex, the woman on top with her back to the camera. Although not graphic, it was clear what was going on. There was some strong language and talk about prostitutes. A chicken is captured and a woman cuts its head off - although the actual act wasn't shown (no animals were harmed in the making of this film) the sound effect and the action before and after make it clear what happened. Death and being an orphan is a recurring theme in the film. This is a powerful film.At an hour and forty three minutes this film is exactly the right length. There isn't one second I would change.The movie is presented in Zulu, Hindi, and English with subtitles. The DVD includes text biographies of the Director Avie Luthra, Jayashree Basavaraj, Sihle Dlamini, and Vusi Kunene. The Film Movement site also has much more detailed information about the actors. This is the first time I have run into a film where there is virtually no information about this film on IMDB. Vusi Kunene is the only actor with a detailed page. I guess that speaks volumes to how incredibly this film is.The DVD includes a 20 minute short, Lucky. This is the original short film that Avie Luthra created to begin developing the full length film. The 20 minute version is good, but not great. From a technical and completest standpoint the short is worth watching.Film Movement works very hard at finding undiscovered treasures from around the world. This is a gem, one of the best they have ever distributed.I was provided a review copy.",5,"Love, Loss, and the Kindness of Strangers",1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,3723,"['Love', 'loss', 'kindness', 'strangers', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'magnificent', 'movie', 'Lucky', 'were', 'hesitant', 'slip', 'film', 'DVD', 'player', 'make', 'leap', 'so', 'rewarding', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'ever', 'expected.At', 'core', 'sad', 'film', 'film', 'Lucky', 'wandering', 'village', 'first', 'homeless', 'boy', ""n't"", 'fit', 'anywhere', 'Quietly', 'gradually', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'Lucky', 'Eventually', 'find', 'mother', 'just', 'died', 'now', 'completely', 'alone', 'world', 'film', 'moves', 'forward', 'moment', 'eyes', 'young', 'Lucky', 'world', ""n't"", 'seen', 'evil', 'dealing', 'awful', 'life', 'Instead', 'mother', 'will', 'go', 'school', 'study', 'hard', 'sense', 'film', 'incredibly', 'positive.I', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'grabbed', 'start', 'very', 'little', 'dialog', 'music', 'beautiful', 'subtle', 'enhancing', 'film', 'turn', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'cast', 'film', 'everything', 'lead', 'character', 'Lucky', 'played', 'Sihle', 'Dlamini', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'incredible', 'facial', 'expressions', 'sense', 'timing', 'other', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'loved', 'minute', 'was', 'screen', 'Jayashree', 'Basavaraj', 'relatively', 'famous', 'Indian', 'actress', 'Padma', 'stranger', 'Lucky', 'more', 'kindness', 'anybody', 'should', 'ever', 'give', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'amazing.The', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'course', 'back', 'drop', 'South', 'Africa', 'Black', 'Death', 'decimating', 'population', 'film', 'never', 'becomes', 'political', 'larger', 'universal', 'feel', 'something', 'everybody', 'can', 'understand', 'huge', 'loss', 'when', 'somebody', 'love', 'dies', 'great', 'feeling', 'love', 'person', 'even', 'are', 'gone', 'great', 'feeling', 'void', 'when', 'have', 'nobody', 'incredible', 'kindness', 'people', 'can', 'give', 'even', 'might', 'eat', 'black', 'dogs', 'curry', 'No', 'was', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'South', 'Africa', 'was', 'tender', 'eloquent', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'how', 'situation.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'acceptable', 'mature', 'younger', 'viewers', 'R', 'rated', 'age', 'group', 'was', 'scene', 'viewed', 'room', 'couple', 'clearly', 'having', 'sex', 'woman', 'top', 'back', 'camera', 'not', 'graphic', 'was', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'strong', 'language', 'talk', 'prostitutes', 'chicken', 'captured', 'woman', 'head', 'actual', 'act', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'making', 'film', 'sound', 'effect', 'action', 'make', 'clear', 'what', 'happened', 'Death', 'being', 'orphan', 'recurring', 'theme', 'film', 'powerful', 'film.At', 'hour', 'forty', 'three', 'minutes', 'film', 'exactly', 'right', 'length', ""n't"", 'one', 'second', 'would', 'change.The', 'movie', 'presented', 'Zulu', 'Hindi', 'English', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'text', 'biographies', 'Director', 'Avie', 'Luthra', 'Jayashree', 'Basavaraj', 'Sihle', 'Dlamini', 'Vusi', 'Kunene', 'Film', 'Movement', 'site', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'detailed', 'information', 'actors', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'run', 'film', 'where', 'virtually', 'information', 'film', 'IMDB', 'Vusi', 'Kunene', 'only', 'actor', 'detailed', 'page', 'guess', 'volumes', 'how', 'incredibly', 'film', 'is.The', 'DVD', '20', 'minute', 'short', 'Lucky', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'Avie', 'Luthra', 'created', 'begin', 'developing', 'full', 'length', 'film', '20', 'minute', 'version', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'technical', 'completest', 'standpoint', 'short', 'worth', 'watching.Film', 'Movement', 'very', 'hard', 'finding', 'undiscovered', 'treasures', 'world', 'gem', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'distributed.I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy']",N/A
1602487,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009V1934I,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","Film Movement continues to bring brilliant little films of deep significance to our attention. LUCKY originated as a 2005 short film about a lad named Lucky whose parents succumbed to AIDS.  Writer/Director Avie Luthra has expanded the message of this story into a full length film and cast it with South African and Indian actors, committed to having the dialogue in Zulu, Hindi, and English (which adds enormously to the film's treatment of isolation) and has discovered a gifted child actor in Sihle Dlamini who portrays the role of Lucky.Recently orphaned 10-year-old South African Lucky (Sihle Dlamini) observes his beloved but estranged mother returned to his Zulu village in a coffin and being without family he leaves his village to make his own life in the city, having promised his mother in a touching scene at the gravesite that he will make himself better, become educated and make her proud. He makes his way to the nearest big city, lives on the streets, until he locates his uncle (his mother had let him know that should anything happen, her brother would take care of him) who is an irresponsible, womanizing, wayward man who has spent the money Lucky's mother left with him for Lucky's school. Desperately disappointed he seeks help where he can find it and encounters Padma (Jayashree Basavaraj), an elderly Indian woman whose concept of caste means she cannot touch Black people or anything that the Blacks have touched. Padma speaks Hindi and Lucky speaks Zulu so verbal communication is out of the question until Padma engages a genuinely warm taxi driver (James Ngcobo) with whom she can converse in English and translate for her. Lucky has a tape recording his mother left him, and when he finally is able to listen to it he discovers the last words of his dying mother reassuring him of her love.  Padma has the taxi driver translate the tape for her and this gains Padma's empathy.  The three work together to place Lucky in school, find the man ((Vusi Kunene) who had lived with his mother - a tender but lonely man who tends to the dead - and ultimately through the kindness of strangers Lucky achieves his primary goal: he wants to attend school and find people who will care for him emotionally.Lucky questions everyone's motives and responses and it is from the taxi driver that he discovers that `Adults have to lie sometimes. That's how they survive.' In his search for his dream, marked by greed, violence, and belonging, Lucky shows how a child's spirit can bring out decency, humility and even love in adults coping with life in the new South Africa. Beautifully written, filmed and acted, this is an exceptional film that deserves the widest possible audience. Grady Harp, May 13",5,'Adults have to lie sometimes.

1602488,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009V1934I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Set in South Africa, the stirring drama ""Lucky"" explores the prejudices, racial division, and economic hardships that still plague a community in transition.  At its heart, though, is the perfectly understated and believable sojourn of a young boy trying to find his place in the world.  At his lowest point, he makes an unlikely connection that will become instrumental in choosing a new life and setting him on an alternate course.  Lucky, the young orphan at the center of the movie, has only a few true motivators.  He wants to honor his recently deceased mother by seeking out an education that will lead to greater opportunity.  But his path is not an easy one for he has no one that is truly on his side.  Director Avie Luthra makes some pretty impressive choices in telling Lucky's story.  In some hands, this tale would be wrought with melodrama and big emotional moments.  Luthra plays things a little closer to the vest in terms of dramatics.  By utilizing a more restrained touch, ""Lucky"" and its ultimate impact on the viewer really sneaks up.  The quiet power of the film, therefore, is its strongest attribute.As ""Lucky"" opens, we see the tragedy that has befallen Lucky's life.  Although his community reaches out to support him, he pushes away.  His mother wanted him to have a better life.  Seeking out his uncle in the big city, Lucky is adamant about going to school.  But life in the city is not what he might expect.  One of his neighbors is an elderly Indian woman who is unhappy with the city's new integration.  She is suspicious and standoffish of Lucky, especially as the two don't even share a language to ease communication.  Circumstances, though, inevitably continue to push them together.  And once she can see Lucky as an individual, as a lost little boy, the dynamics of their relationship start to change.  ""Lucky"" is filled with compassion, but never devolves into overt sentimentality.  That's why I liked it so much.  It is simultaneously hopeful and truthful.  The two central characters will change each other irrevocably, but it is handled quietly and without grandstanding.The film has a number of nice supporting turns, but it really rests on the central pairing. Sihle Dlamini is incredibly strong as Lucky.  He is strong, defiant, stubborn, and vulnerable by equal turns.  It is an incredibly dignified performance that will pull on your heartstrings because it is not manipulative or over-the-top.  I believed Dlamini at every moment.  Likewise, Jayashree Basavaraj, as Padma, defies most expectations with her toughness and matter-of-factness.  Most screenplays would have turned this relationship into sentimental treacle, but ""Lucky"" retains a refreshingly hard edge throughout.  The DVD presentation also has Luthra's 20 minute award winning short on which the feature was based.  I enjoyed the contrast.  This is certainly one case where the expansion was worth the investment.  Quietly powerful, ""Lucky"" gets under your skin and many of its images have stayed with me long after the viewing.

1602489,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B009V1934I,Paul Allaer,"[6, 6]","Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, in fact I finally gave in and started my membership last year to their DVD of the Month releases. This is the February, 2013 release in that on-going series.""Lucky"" (2011 release from South Africa; 104 min.) brings the story of Lucky, a 10 yr. old boy living in a remote Zulu village in South Africa. As the movie begins, we see him anxiously awaiting the return of his mom fom a trip to the Big City. As it turns out, she died of HIV-AIDS and instead she is returned to the village in a coffin. Before dying. she made arrangements for Lucky to go live with his uncle (mom's brother) in the Big City. Upon arriving, Lucky is not particularly welcomed with open arms, and it doesn't take long before things come to a full conflict. Around that time, Lucky strikes up an unlikely friendship with an old Indian woman living in the same complex. At this point we are about one-third into the movie. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is a very moving family drama that brought tears to my eyes on several occasions. When you see Lucky trying to cope with his mom's death, you cannot help but feel so incredibly sorry for him, as no 10 year old should have to go through this. Second, the movie explores the interaction between the large Indian community in South Africe and the natigve Zulu population in a very nuanced way that gave me great insights in the matter. Third, there are several outstanding performances, none more so than Sihle Dlamini as the 10 yr. old boy. He simply blew me away, not unlike, say, the performance of Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis as the little girl in last year's Beasts of the Southern Wild. Last but not least, there are several DVD bonus materials, by far the best of which is the original 20 min. short film from 2005, also called ""Lucky"", which director Avie Luthra uses as the platform for this feature film, and which is quite good in and of itself as well. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, ""Lucky"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Moving family drama,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,2267,"['Let', 'state', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Film', 'Movement', 'library', 'foreign', 'indie', 'movies', 'fact', 'finally', 'gave', 'started', 'membership', 'last', 'year', 'DVD', 'Month', 'releases', 'February', '2013', 'release', 'on-going', 'series', 'Lucky', '2011', 'release', 'South', 'Africa', '104', 'min', 'story', 'Lucky', '10', 'yr.', 'old', 'boy', 'living', 'remote', 'Zulu', 'village', 'South', 'Africa', 'movie', 'see', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'return', 'mom', 'fom', 'trip', 'Big', 'City', 'out', 'died', 'HIV-AIDS', 'instead', 'returned', 'village', 'coffin', 'dying', 'made', 'arrangements', 'Lucky', 'go', 'live', 'uncle', 'mom', 'brother', 'Big', 'City', 'arriving', 'Lucky', 'not', 'particularly', 'welcomed', 'open', 'arms', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'before', 'things', 'come', 'full', 'conflict', 'time', 'Lucky', 'up', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'old', 'Indian', 'woman', 'living', 'same', 'complex', 'point', 'are', 'one-third', 'movie', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'very', 'moving', 'family', 'drama', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'several', 'occasions', 'When', 'see', 'Lucky', 'trying', 'cope', 'mom', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'so', 'incredibly', 'sorry', '10', 'year', 'old', 'should', 'have', 'go', 'Second', 'movie', 'interaction', 'large', 'Indian', 'community', 'South', 'Africe', 'natigve', 'Zulu', 'population', 'very', 'nuanced', 'way', 'gave', 'great', 'insights', 'matter', 'Third', 'are', 'several', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Sihle', 'Dlamini', '10', 'yr.', 'old', 'boy', 'simply', 'blew', 'away', 'not', 'say', 'performance', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'little', 'girl', 'last', 'year', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'are', 'several', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'materials', 'far', 'best', 'original', '20', 'min', 'short', 'film', '2005', 'also', 'called', 'Lucky', 'director', 'Avie', 'Luthra', 'platform', 'feature', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'mood', 'quality', 'foreign', 'movie', 'miles', 'away', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Lucky', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

He then meets Padma, an Indian with a fear of Africans. They aren't able to speak to one another, which makes the connection, the bond that they share, that much more interesting and special.If you take the time to watch, you will almost certainly be taken in by the heartwarming story... even if it is difficult to see the boy as anything other than UN-Lucky in the beginning of the tale.Also included, as an excellent bonus, is the short film that was used as the basis for the feature length version.Film Movement has created a stellar release for many an ""art house"" film, and this release continues the tradition of a moving film in a fantastic package.Video:The DVD is presented in the 16x9 aspect ratio, which is the ratio from the original film. Despite ""only"" being on DVD, there is a ton of detail and each shot is well composed.Audio:You have a choice of stereo or 5.1 surround in what I believe is the Zulu language. As is the way of most art style releases, it is all about maintaining the original artistic intent of the film, which means presenting it in its original language.The only option for subtitles is English, which are completely optional. Since I don't understand Zulu, I opted to watch with English subtitles.I honestly didn't notice much difference between the stereo and the surround track, as it's mainly a dialog driven film.Extras:You get the original short film that spawned the full length feature. It is worth watching to get a feel for where the amazing film came from.Overall:Lucky is well acted. Presented amazingly well by Film Movement and tells a truly heartfelt, real feeling story about loss, greed, violence and acceptance. You will feel yourself rooting for Lucky on every step of his journey.Very highly recommended.Of note, I received a free review copy of this film. Despite receiving items for free, I do not allow this to color my review in any way.",5,"Fantastic film, great presentation on DVD",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,2012,"['Lucky', 'story', '10', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'orphan', 'who', 'uncle', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'then', 'Padma', 'Indian', 'fear', 'Africans', 'are', ""n't"", 'able', 'speak', 'one', 'connection', 'bond', 'share', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'special.If', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'will', 'almost', 'certainly', 'be', 'taken', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'even', 'difficult', 'see', 'boy', 'anything', 'other', 'UN-Lucky', 'beginning', 'tale.Also', 'included', 'excellent', 'bonus', 'short', 'film', 'was', 'used', 'basis', 'feature', 'length', 'version.Film', 'Movement', 'created', 'stellar', 'release', 'many', 'art', 'house', 'film', 'release', 'tradition', 'moving', 'film', 'fantastic', 'package.Video', 'DVD', 'presented', '16x9', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'ratio', 'original', 'film', 'only', 'being', 'DVD', 'ton', 'detail', 'shot', 'well', 'composed.Audio', 'have', 'choice', 'stereo', '5.1', 'surround', 'what', 'believe', 'Zulu', 'language', 'way', 'most', 'art', 'style', 'releases', 'maintaining', 'original', 'artistic', 'intent', 'film', 'presenting', 'original', 'language.The', 'only', 'option', 'subtitles', 'English', 'are', 'completely', 'optional', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Zulu', 'opted', 'watch', 'English', 'subtitles.I', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'stereo', 'surround', 'track', 'mainly', 'dialog', 'driven', 'film.Extras', 'get', 'original', 'short', 'film', 'spawned', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'worth', 'watching', 'get', 'feel', 'where', 'amazing', 'film', 'came', 'from.Overall', 'Lucky', 'well', 'acted', 'Presented', 'amazingly', 'well', 'Film', 'Movement', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'real', 'feeling', 'story', 'loss', 'greed', 'violence', 'acceptance', 'will', 'feel', 'rooting', 'Lucky', 'step', 'journey.Very', 'highly', 'recommended.Of', 'note', 'received', 'free', 'review', 'copy', 'film', 'receiving', 'items', 'free', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'color', 'review', 'way']",N/A
