272350,A3R1WUS2R3E9IB,6301917588,A. Owens,"[4, 4]","The VHS recorded tape of this made-for-tv movie was a travesty.  The original film was shown in 2 nights. The running time of the original was 178 mins.  Vidmark's VHS version is 93 mins. You do the math.  What is left is a film that makes absolutely no sense to a first time viewer. Some of the scenes are spliced together with no thought to continuity, jumping from one scene to another.  Viewers are bound to wonder ""what did I miss"". I would highly recommend giving this VHS version a definite ""miss"".  If I could rate it lower than 1 star I most would do so.",1,"Great Escape II: The Untold Story, The",1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,563,"['VHS', 'recorded', 'tape', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'was', 'travesty', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'shown', '2', 'nights', 'running', 'time', 'original', 'was', '178', 'mins', 'Vidmark', 'VHS', 'version', '93', 'mins', 'do', 'math', 'What', 'left', 'film', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'scenes', 'are', 'spliced', 'together', 'thought', 'continuity', 'jumping', 'one', 'scene', 'Viewers', 'are', 'bound', 'wonder', 'what', 'did', 'miss', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'giving', 'VHS', 'version', 'definite', 'miss', 'could', 'rate', 'lower', '1', 'star', 'most', 'would', 'do', 'so']",Great Escape II:The Untold Story VHS

Still the story and the acting are excellent.  It is an excellent followup to the original ""Great Escape"" and well worth watching.  If it were possible to find all the missing parts and put it in a DVD format, it could be truly outstanding.",2,Needs to be restored,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,366,"['VCR', 'have', 'was', 'made', 'run', 'low', 'speed', 'was', 'apparently', 'cut', 'make', 'fit', 'time', 'schedule', 'media', 'showing', 'Still', 'story', 'acting', 'are', 'excellent', 'excellent', 'followup', 'original', 'Great', 'Escape', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'were', 'possible', 'find', 'missing', 'parts', 'put', 'DVD', 'format', 'could', 'be', 'truly', 'outstanding']",Great Escape II:The Untold Story VHS
