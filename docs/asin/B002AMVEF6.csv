This is the only new show that caught my interest this season and rightfully so thanks to Creator Ryan Murphy (Popular, Nip/Tuck).

Jane Lynch is a riot and Matthew Morrison is the Spanish teacher with a heart of gold who decides to revamp the socially dead Glee club. The music is a hit and miss for me though, some of the song selections are too predictable and what's wrong all those Beyonce songs??

I bought my own copy today and now have all available songs on my ipod. Glee is a rare treat. The cast is chock full of very talented actors who sing as well as dance. The music is fantastic, and the show features a wide variety from broadway hits to rap. It is a musical, so not for everyone. The characters on the show are unique and everyone has their own quirks; these are characters that you love or love to hate, there are very few, if any, in betweens, and there are one or two that you love one moment and hate the next. The script is full of teenage agnst and deals with everyday problems that both teenagers and adults are faced with today like pregnancy, coming out of the closet, peer pressure, prejudice, trying to find your niche, etc with subtle, sometimes sarcastic, often witty humor.

They all come home from performing in the theater and watch this from their TIVOs.  The New York Times just reported this in depth.  Regular people also love it and I am one of them.  This is set in a high school but there is something for everyone.  The main character is a high school Spanish teacher and his extracurricular running of the Glee Club.  Will's students make up the modern day incarnation of a Glee Club which is nothing like what most of thought of as our high school glee club.  Their choral singing involves full stage numbers of major hits.  They dance and sing to it and are absolutely wonderful.  Even if you hate all other aspects of the show, you will love the musical numbers.  The Glee music CD has become a major hit in and of itself.  There are some timely topics going on in the show as well.  Will's wife fakes a pregnancy whereas one of his students is pregnant.  She was a member of a high school abstinence club so there is a lot of food for thought as you ponder the effectiveness of the club. (These kids are so in the dark on sex education that they think you can get pregnant by ejaculation into the waters of a hot tub!) My favorite character is the coach for the Cheerleaders, Sue.

1258742,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B002AMVEF6,"Crabigail Cassidy ""Crabby Abby""","[1, 1]","I watched a fair share of the first season of GLEE on tv. When I was talking to a friend a couple of weeks ago, we reminiced about the shows we used to love in grade school and high school and how we'd always be on the phone critiquing them and probably spending more time talking about them than we did watching them. This all lead to the subject of GLEE which she had not seen but heard great comments about from her kids. In anticipation of her visiting me over the past week, I bought this set.Instead of doing my usual multi-tasking while we watched this over a seven day period, I came to realize that this show was way better when I gave it my full and undivided attention. While I'd have to admit that some characters are a tad over-the-top (HELLO, SUE SYLVESTER!), there is so much about GLEE that speaks to a broadly based audience that it is hard for me to not like it. It is reminiscent of a John Hughes movie in that the misfits join together to take on the socially elite/snotty kids at their school. The characters are fairly well-developed (though the current season seems to be going full throttle and doing more in that direction than Season 1). The program takes on popular teen topics such as unplanned pregancy, bullying, and acceptance of diversity. The adults are portrayed as having their own unique sets of problems which is realistic.  The use of music which reflects some really artful staging, is often used as a subtext for what is happening to the characters as the plotlines are moved forward. The more I watched this show, the more I found it compulsively addictive. I love the ongoing rivalry between everyman teacher Will Schuster (Matthew Morrison) and Sue Sylvester(Jane Lynch). I am absolutely in awe of the entire cast who are absolutely amazing and incredibly talented on so many levels.This dvd set may not be your thing if you catched all the episodes from Season 1 on tv, but if you like the show and haven't caught all the episodes it is definitely a worthwhile purchase. If you love the show and have seen all of the first season, it is great to have because you can enjoy it all over again.As a footnote to this review, my friend has fallen for this show and is now a weekly viewer. We both think it defies comparison to anything we've seen on the boob tube and reminds us of West Side Story without the tragedy.",5,"Love Glee, But Honestly Can't Fully Explain Why",1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,2357,"['watched', 'fair', 'share', 'first', 'season', 'GLEE', 'tv', 'When', 'was', 'talking', 'friend', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'reminiced', 'shows', 'used', 'love', 'grade', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'how', ""'d"", 'always', 'be', 'phone', 'critiquing', 'probably', 'spending', 'more', 'time', 'talking', 'did', 'watching', 'lead', 'subject', 'GLEE', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'heard', 'great', 'comments', 'kids', 'anticipation', 'visiting', 'past', 'week', 'bought', 'set.Instead', 'doing', 'usual', 'multi-tasking', 'watched', 'seven', 'day', 'period', 'came', 'realize', 'show', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'when', 'gave', 'full', 'undivided', 'attention', ""'d"", 'have', 'admit', 'characters', 'are', 'tad', 'over-the-top', 'HELLO', 'SUE', 'SYLVESTER', 'so', 'much', 'GLEE', 'broadly', 'based', 'audience', 'hard', 'not', 'reminiscent', 'John', 'Hughes', 'movie', 'misfits', 'join', 'together', 'take', 'socially', 'elite/snotty', 'kids', 'school', 'characters', 'are', 'fairly', 'well-developed', 'current', 'season', 'be', 'going', 'full', 'throttle', 'doing', 'more', 'direction', 'Season', '1', 'program', 'popular', 'teen', 'topics', 'such', 'unplanned', 'pregancy', 'bullying', 'acceptance', 'diversity', 'adults', 'are', 'portrayed', 'having', 'own', 'unique', 'sets', 'problems', 'realistic', 'use', 'music', 'really', 'artful', 'staging', 'often', 'used', 'subtext', 'what', 'happening', 'characters', 'plotlines', 'are', 'moved', 'forward', 'more', 'watched', 'show', 'more', 'found', 'compulsively', 'addictive', 'love', 'ongoing', 'rivalry', 'everyman', 'teacher', 'Will', 'Schuster', 'Matthew', 'Morrison', 'Sue', 'Sylvester', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'am', 'absolutely', 'awe', 'entire', 'cast', 'who', 'are', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'so', 'many', 'levels.This', 'dvd', 'set', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'thing', 'catched', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'tv', 'like', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'caught', 'episodes', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'love', 'show', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'have', 'can', 'enjoy', 'footnote', 'review', 'friend', 'fallen', 'show', 'now', 'weekly', 'viewer', 'think', 'comparison', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'boob', 'tube', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'tragedy']","Glee: Season 1, Vol. 1 - Road to Sectionals"

Never in recent memory can I think of a show that I have fallen so madly and quickly in love with as I have with Glee. Everything about this show is utter perfection! This is the second show I can say that I watch RELIGIOUSLY right behind ""Ugly Betty"". The cast is just so talented beyond words, especially Rachel (Lea Michele) she has one of the best voices I have ever heard come out of a human body and I am always looking forward to what song she is going to sing each week. Another character that really has my heart is Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). I have loved Jane ever since I saw her ""40yr old Virgin"" and I was delighted to see her in this because I now how funny she can be. And OH MY GOD is she funny in this show!!! I can almost say that I live to hear what she has to say every week. She has the funniest lines every single episode she is in and in some cases she can actually make the episode for me. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well. Everyone has great vocals, some a lot better than others obviously, but as a whole they are a real delight to witness.

No matter how they package it, it's just too much.That said, if you haven't seen this show and are considering giving it a try, I highly advise you! Essentially, the weekly plots circle around a group of less-than-popular social misfits, all of whom have joined their high school Glee club for a variety of reasons. Their advisor, Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) is sincere about his enthusiasm in bringing the long-dead club back to life, although his drive for success is also motivated by outside factors. Meanwhile, the sarcastic cheerleading coach, played by Jane Lynch, continues to scheme against Will and butt heads with him every step of the way.While this might not sound like the premise for a fresh new series, don't be misled! Each week, we learn more about the personal lives of various characters, and what motivates them. There's also bizarre and hilarious events at the school, amidst renditions of numerous popular songs each week -- everything from Broadway to Beyonce. Viewers can never predict what they'll hear next, or just how the Glee kids will present it.Each week, it's a pleasure waiting for this bright show - both in terms of smart dialogue and the singing. It's even visually stimulating, with a wide array of bright costumes and backgrounds that are bound to make you smile, no matter if your own high school experience was worse than that of the kids at McKinley High.While nearly every episode is great in its own way, particularly noteworthy episodes include ""Wheels,"" where Will asks the kids to help support the wheelchair-using Artie by spending a few days (as well as doing a number) in wheelchairs themselves. There's also the fall finale, ""Sectionals,"" where the Glee kids finally make it to the first big competition, amidst - naturally - many obstacles and roadblocks.",4,"Great show, but don't waste your money",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2001,"['fell', 'love', 'smart', 'funny', 'show', 'sneak-peek', 'pilot', 'airing', 'last', 'spring', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'should', 'have', 'pay', 'thirty', 'dollars', 'season', 'matter', 'how', 'package', 'just', 'too', 'much.That', 'said', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'are', 'considering', 'giving', 'try', 'highly', 'advise', 'Essentially', 'weekly', 'plots', 'circle', 'group', 'less-than-popular', 'social', 'misfits', 'whom', 'have', 'joined', 'high', 'school', 'Glee', 'club', 'variety', 'reasons', 'advisor', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'Will', 'Schuester', 'Matthew', 'Morrison', 'sincere', 'enthusiasm', 'bringing', 'long-dead', 'club', 'back', 'life', 'drive', 'success', 'also', 'motivated', 'outside', 'factors', 'Meanwhile', 'sarcastic', 'cheerleading', 'coach', 'played', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'scheme', 'Will', 'butt', 'heads', 'step', 'way.While', 'might', 'not', 'sound', 'premise', 'fresh', 'new', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'week', 'learn', 'more', 'personal', 'lives', 'various', 'characters', 'what', 'also', 'bizarre', 'hilarious', 'events', 'school', 'amidst', 'renditions', 'numerous', 'popular', 'songs', 'week', 'everything', 'Broadway', 'Beyonce', 'Viewers', 'can', 'never', 'predict', 'what', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'next', 'just', 'how', 'Glee', 'kids', 'will', 'present', 'it.Each', 'week', 'pleasure', 'waiting', 'bright', 'show', 'terms', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'singing', 'even', 'visually', 'stimulating', 'wide', 'array', 'bright', 'costumes', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'bound', 'make', 'smile', 'matter', 'own', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'was', 'worse', 'kids', 'McKinley', 'High.While', 'nearly', 'episode', 'great', 'own', 'way', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'episodes', 'include', 'Wheels', 'where', 'Will', 'kids', 'help', 'support', 'wheelchair-using', 'Artie', 'spending', 'few', 'days', 'as', 'well', 'doing', 'number', 'wheelchairs', 'also', 'fall', 'finale', 'Sectionals', 'where', 'Glee', 'kids', 'finally', 'make', 'first', 'big', 'competition', 'amidst', 'naturally', 'many', 'obstacles', 'roadblocks']","Glee: Season 1, Vol. 1 - Road to Sectionals"

Schmidt ""Classics Caper""","[4, 4]","While i understand that many people could not wait to have some Glee episodes sitting on their shelf at home, those who are looking to buy this DVD set now should be aware that FOX recently announced the release date of the complete first season of ALL 22 episodes. Of course, this set only has the first 13. The September 14th release will be a 7-disc box set retailing for [...] MSRP for the DVD and [...] for the Blu-ray, That's about [...] more than most 22-episode releases of FOX shows which typically have a list price of [...] for the DVD. Apparently FOX is claiming the extra [...] is due to music licensing fees, which I guess is understandable with a music based show like Glee.Unlike this release, which has little to no bonus features, the complete season set will have extended episodes, sing-along karaoke, a behind-the-scenes look at 'The Power of Madonna' episode, 'Glee' makeovers, never-before-seen 'Sue's Corner' segments, a dance tutorial and more. I haven't heard anything about episode commentaries, but hopefully there will be some of those as well.As of right now, there are NO PLANS by FOX to release a 2nd volume with the 9 spring episodes as a companion to this volume 1 release. You will have to buy the Sept 14th complete 1st season set if you have already bought release and would like to own the other 9 episodes. In addition, there was talk earlier in the year about an alleged rebate included in the complete 1st season release so that fans who had already bought the volume 1 release could get some money back because they double dipped. Later on, FOX denied any such rebate, but now it looks likes there MOST LIKELY will be a [...] rebate. All the info about this rebate, or ""Gleebate"" as FOX has dubbed it, will supposably be available after June 1st via a special website FOX has set up.  Several websites already have pictures of the box set up and if you google the words 'gleebate dvd' you should be able to see what the 1st season cover art will look like.So, if you are looking to buy yourself some Glee, hold out until September 14th if you can. If you don't mind spending the money to buy both releases, not to mention having duplicates of the first 13 episodes, then go ahead and buy this Road to Sectionals DVD as Glee truly is a great series!",1,"COMPLETE 1st season due Sept 14, 2010, DONT BUY THIS RELEASE!!",1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,2290,"['i', 'understand', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'have', 'Glee', 'episodes', 'sitting', 'shelf', 'home', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'now', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'FOX', 'recently', 'announced', 'release', 'date', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'ALL', '22', 'episodes', 'course', 'set', 'only', 'first', '13', 'September', '14th', 'release', 'will', 'be', '7-disc', 'box', 'set', 'retailing', '[', 'MSRP', 'DVD', '[', ']', 'Blu-ray', 'That', '[', 'more', 'most', '22-episode', 'releases', 'FOX', 'shows', 'typically', 'have', 'list', 'price', '[', ']', 'DVD', 'Apparently', 'FOX', 'claiming', 'extra', '[', ']', 'due', 'music', 'licensing', 'fees', 'guess', 'understandable', 'music', 'based', 'show', 'Glee.Unlike', 'release', 'little', 'bonus', 'complete', 'season', 'set', 'will', 'have', 'extended', 'episodes', 'sing-along', 'karaoke', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', ""'The"", 'Power', 'Madonna', 'episode', 'makeovers', 'never-before-seen', ""'Sue"", 'Corner', 'segments', 'dance', 'tutorial', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anything', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'well.As', 'right', 'now', 'are', 'PLANS', 'FOX', 'release', '2nd', 'volume', '9', 'spring', 'episodes', 'companion', 'volume', '1', 'release', 'will', 'have', 'buy', 'Sept', '14th', 'complete', '1st', 'season', 'set', 'have', 'already', 'bought', 'release', 'would', 'like', 'own', 'other', '9', 'episodes', 'addition', 'was', 'talk', 'earlier', 'year', 'alleged', 'rebate', 'included', 'complete', '1st', 'season', 'release', 'so', 'fans', 'who', 'had', 'already', 'bought', 'volume', '1', 'release', 'could', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'double', 'dipped', 'Later', 'FOX', 'denied', 'such', 'rebate', 'now', 'likes', 'there', 'MOST', 'LIKELY', 'will', 'be', '[', ']', 'rebate', 'info', 'rebate', 'Gleebate', 'FOX', 'dubbed', 'will', 'supposably', 'be', 'available', 'June', '1st', 'special', 'website', 'FOX', 'set', 'up', 'Several', 'websites', 'already', 'have', 'pictures', 'box', 'set', 'up', 'google', 'words', 'dvd', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'what', '1st', 'season', 'cover', 'art', 'will', 'look', 'like.So', 'are', 'looking', 'buy', 'Glee', 'hold', 'out', 'September', '14th', 'can', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'spending', 'money', 'buy', 'releases', 'not', 'mention', 'having', 'duplicates', 'first', '13', 'episodes', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'Road', 'Sectionals', 'DVD', 'Glee', 'truly', 'great', 'series']","Glee: Season 1, Vol. 1 - Road to Sectionals"

You can purchase Volume 1: Road to Sectionals on Amazon.com if you're truly fiending for the show, but since these were the first episodes BEFORE the network ordered 9 more after the show's success, I would highly suggest to catch the re-runs and save your money for the true first season when it comes out in April.**My review of the show is below:Cute characters, if not along the some of the same tired lines of those we've seen before, fantastic musical talent and numbers and high school drama make up the wonder that is ""Glee"".At first, the network was unsure if they should greenlight the series, fearful that it wouldn't click with the demographic they were aiming for.  But once ""Don't Stop Believin'"" was released, everyone who hadn't seen the show and was amazed by the vocal talent just had to check it out--including me.""Glee"" is a feel-good show that focuses on triumph over adversity through the power of music and determination.  Matthew Morrison stars as Will Schuester, a Spanish teacher and the Glee club coach.  Morrison is a delightful actor.  When he smiles, you smile along with him.  When he fights for the kids on issues like disability or pregnancy, you feel like he genuinely cares for them-he pulls you into his acting performance and that in itself makes the show a delight.That along with the talented cast of kids and Jane Lynch as the stop-at-nothing, evil cheerleading coach, Sue Sylvester, will have you tuning in every Wednesday to see what happens next.  Each kid represents the typical stereotype in a world of diversity that we've all seen before, but even though that is a tired angle to try to present as ""new"", each actor bring new life to the characters, making it enjoyable to watch.Below is a list of the more prominent Glee club members:Lea Michele is Rachel Berry, a Jewish girl with ""two gay dads"" who has a fierce determination to be a star.  Michele comes to the show fresh off of her run in the Broadway play, ""Spring Awakening"".  It is usually her pipes you hear above everyone else's.Cory Monteith is Finn, the boy that Rachel pines for and the quarterback for the high school football team.  Finn is led to believe by Quinn, (Dianna Agron), that he has knocked her up and she tries to make him take full responsibility for the baby when in reality, the baby's father is really Noah, (Mark Salling).Chris Colfer is the adorable out-and-proud Kurt Hummel, who tows the line between being proud of who he is and pleasing his father, (Mike O'Malley).  Thankfully, his father, a mechanic, is portrayed as an understanding father, not a homophobic one, as characters in this macho kind of role are typically molded.Kevin McHale is the wheelchair-bound Artie.  Artie has a crush on fellow Glee club member Tina, (Jenna Ushkowitz), who he feels a connection with due to her having a struggle with stuttering.Amber Riley is delightful as Mercedes, the ""chocolate thunder"" of the group.  Her vocals in such songs as ""Hate on Me"" are just as goose-bump giving as Rachel's.Jayma Mays co-stars as Emma Pillsbury, the school guidance counselor with a huge crush on Will, (and a secret vocal talent that will blow you out of your chair!).  But when Will's wife, Terri, (Jessalyn Gilsig), makes it painfully obvious that no one is going to steal her man, Emma agrees to marry the football coach, Ken, (Patrick Gallagher), whom she finds repulsive but who loves her enough to make her settle for him.Will's wife Terri is also harboring an awful secret-that she is not truly pregnant with Will's baby but is instead faking it and tries to convince Quinn to give her the baby that she doesn't even want to have anyway.So as you can see, the drama in this show is a bit over the top.

I've seen 4 episodes through DVR, and I caught the last 5 episodes on Hulu, but that means I am missing 4 episodes!!  I haven't seen 1, 2, 3, or 8.Yes I could sit there and have my DVR record the episodes and hope that eventually the powers that be will cycle through the show again (in fact, I am fairly confident Episode 8 will air this week), but that completely misses the point about how utterly FANTASTIC this show is and how I will absolutely DIE if I don't see episodes 1, 2, and 3 as soon as it is humanly possible.So.  While on the one hand I am peeved that I will end up purchasing these DVDs twice (since I will get the complete season as soon as it is available), on the other hand I am insanely grateful that the DVDs are available for purchase now so that I don't have to WAIT an undetermined amount of time to see the early episodes.Okay.  About Glee.  I just wasn't interested since I figured it was a show targeted for teens and would therefore be completely boring to me.  But I know people who love it, and I always like to check out popular culture stuff, (albeit grudgingly), so I recorded an episode and it just blew me away.The show is a bit of a spoof and situations/characters tend to be a bit stereotypical and extreme (Sue, the maniacal cheerleading coach is HILARIOUS), and there are a few dramatic situations that were right out of Desperate Housewives (a faked pregnancy for starters), but this show reveals the vulnerable, human side of its characters in such a beautifully honest way that I just fell in love with it.  For example, Quinn, the gorgeous and vicious cheerleader, has an incredible, poignant story line involving teen pregnancy and given how much I loathed her initially, I just can't believe how much I've grown to care about her and what happens to her.I will say that the show is pretty edgy in terms of subject matter, and some of the dancing (I'm thinking of the bootyliscious dance) is suggestive, but I allow my 11 and 12 1/2 year old children watch it with me because I think the positive values Glee promotes outweighs some of the other more confusing (to my kids anyway) choices that the characters have made, and it has launched many great conversations about honesty and deceit and problem solving and winning and losing and acceptance, etc...Plus the music is great!  We all enjoy the performances so much. And many of the songs are very cleverly integrated into the story line.Definitely my new fave.

Still, we happened to catch the second episode on television and after that we were hooked.  We caught up, and kept watching and now we can't wait until the second part of the first season this spring.  My early teenaged kids purchased and listen to the music on their ipods, and love to sing along.  In spite of my early reservations and expectations, I found the show taking me back to my own high school days when I played minor roles in a few community musical theater shows and loved it even though I instinctively knew it wouldn't win me any popularity contests among my fellow students.There's an infectious joy to the musical numbers, and the story has the poignancy mixed with darkly hilarious viciousness and acts of deception between rivals that my wife and I had come to love inDesperate Housewives, just never quite as dark.  It's funny and touching, and always entertaining. Jane Lynch is perfect as Sue Sylvester, the ambitious and arrogant ""cheerio"" coach you can't help but love to hate.  Lea Michele brings a brilliant mixture of insecurity and overconfidence to the role of the lead glee club singer.  All of the actors are extremely talented.At bottom, it's intelligently written high school soap opera, played by extremely talented actors and performers.  There's nothing profound here, but it doesn't try to be.  Still, there's an intriguing social edge to this show, as the students deal with issues such as homophobia and racism, handicaps, gender roles, teenage promiscuity and pregnancy, drugs, bullying, infidelity, intolerance, and gossip, but the writers avoid the usual cliches and platitudes that often tend to surround these issues.  The show manages to raise awareness and provoke thought without raising the red flag of ""political correctness.""

From a marketing standpoint, it is unprecedented to see a series have a midseason DVD box set released. Shows like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, THE SOPRANOS, and SEX AND THE CITY have had the first half of seasons released, but in those cases the shows had extremely long hiatuses. GLEE is having a few months' hiatus, but it isn't as long as with those other shows. It isn't the first show to have a great deal of music in it; that distinction goes to the superb ELI STONE, a show that was thoroughly enchanting but that sadly did not get enough viewers to keep it on the air. But no show in memory has had so much music so completely up and front. The show is also unique in that the pilot debuted several months before the start of its first season. The ratings for the pilot were extremely weak, but word of mouth and strong reviews built up sufficient interest in the show for ratings to improve dramatically when the show returned in the fall.The cast of the show is uneven, especially in the area of musical talent, but luckily some key characters were extremely well cast and pick up the slack for the other characters. Veteran character actress and comic Jane Lynch has been in countless shows and graced an exception number of movies, but has never really gotten a role that garnered her the kind of acclaim that she has deserved. For instance, this past year she stood out on the great Starz comedy PARTY DOWN, but it was like so many of her other roles, something to get her noticed, but not something to set her apart. But as cheerleader coach Sue Sylvester, Lynch has finally gotten a role that will get her both acclaim and awards. I'm betting that she is going to take home either an Emmy or Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy. The two other key cast members were unknowns in TV and film. Matthew Morrison is exceptionally as Spanish teacher and Glee Club leader Will Schuester. On a show that puts a premium on singing and dancing, he is exceptionally fine at both. He fully deserves the Golden Globe Award he was just given. He has a fine light singing voice and an engaging personality that is just right for the show. But the star of the show is the astonishingly talented Lea Michele, who while having had some stage success, is more or less new to TV. She not only has a marvelous singing voice, she has a world of personality and one of the most engaging smiles on TV. Luckily she has competition for the best singer on the show, Amber Riley, who plays Mercedes on the show. There are other excellent actors on the show. There are unfortunately some weak links. The weakest link is Cory Monteith as Finn, who is a likable enough character, but hardly believable as a high school student (he'll be 28 before the season ends) and completely lacks the vocal chops of the other key figures. This comes out even more on the official cast recording than it does on the show itself. As I said, he is likable, but his voice simply isn't on the same level of the other top performers.The weak link in the series overall is the writing. It is OK, and there are some fine individual moments, but the overall story is very strong and isn't very compelling. If you took away the music it would, in fact, be a remarkably bland series. Luckily, there is the music. All of the songs are pretty standard and invariably Top Forty or familiar show tunes, but the arrangements are first rate and the performances compelling.I have a minor fantasy. It isn't very likely to take place, but I can hope. With the demise of DOLLLHOUSE Joss Wehdon is no directly linked to any full time project. He is possibly the only producer/writer working today who might have the ability to make this both a musically entertaining show with a great story to boot. And while he usually only wants to work on his own projects on a permanent basis, he might be tempted to take on GLEE. Whedon is actually going to direct one of the episodes for the second half of the season. He has been very upfront about musicals being his favorite genre. This might be the only project not of his own creation that he might be willing to undertake on a permanent basis. OK, it is just a fantasy. The people in charge may know that the writing isn't top shelf, but with the ratings strong they might not want to mess with the formula. But I would love to see GLEE become a show that not only had likable characters and some great musical numbers, but a show with a really strong storyline as well. Frankly, right now I find the story to be completely and totally forgettable and not up to the level of the music. Maybe the producers will love Whedon and Whedon the show enough for something special to happen. Just remember, no episode of GLEE has been even remotely as entertaining as ""Once More With Feeling,"" the great musical episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.Even if my fantasy does not occur, this will at least continue to be superb light entertainment. I wouldn't put it on my list of the ten best shows on TV, but it is definitely on the list of shows that I will definitely watch each week.I will add that I have absolutely no intention of buying this set. It is not being advertised on Blu-ray and I would definitely want this on Blu-ray, if nothing else then for the improvement in sound quality over the DVD.",4,Utterly delightful light

Although it hasn't been the full season yet, the first 13 episodes and the outpouring of support on I-Tunes with the show's songs have proven that ""Glee"" is a force to be reckoned with. Created by Ryan Murphy (Nip/Tuck), the show follows the William McKinney HS club led by Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison)who finds something special and wonderful in each of the Glee members. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is head of the school's cheerleading team and part co-sponsor who hilariously never ceases to scheme to take out the Glee club. Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), the ""doe-eyed neat freak"", is the school's counselor who finds herself becoming closer to the club than expected. Jessalyn Gilsig (who portrays Will's wife, Terri), is supportive of her husband's decision to take over Glee but becomes selfish in her hopes to start a family. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) displays her abilities as a diva and proves that she is confident in her talents and goals. Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) reluctantly joins the club and ends up having to make a decision between Glee and football. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) is proud of having an independent spirit and her vocals are out of this world. Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) struggles to admit his sexual orientation but his passion for the music is inspiring after he joins the football team and teaches them a thing or two about dancing. Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) is Finn's best friend who at first, dislikes the club for it's flamboyancy, but has a change of heart for a very different reason. Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is the all-American cheerleader who is head of the celibacy club and joins Glee to assist Sue in taking the club down. Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) is another fellow Glee-ster who wears Gothic clothes regularly and has a speech impediment who becomes a worthy adversary for Rachel. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) is a handicapped student who reaches out to the club in proving that his disability hasn't limited him in being an outstanding guitar player and singer. There were so many moments that were so touching, funny and all-around joyous that it's hard to completely mention. From laugh-out-loud musical numbers of Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push It"" to the momentous hit of Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"", the tie-in soundtrack is a MUST for any die-hard fan of the show!
