1445159,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B0058JQYE4,J. Michael,"[0, 0]","This is a wonderful story of a man who moves to the Alaskan wilderness, builds himself a cabin and basically lives alone with nature for 30 years. It's such a refreshing antidote to our superficial, ever-moving, ever-connected modern culture that my entire family, including our toddler, found ourselves engrossed, and could have watched 20 more hours. It's slow-paced- the way real life is slow-paced- but there's always something fascinating to see: Mr. Proenneke builds almost everything by hand, he catches most of his own food, he canoes, he hikes, he looks at the wildlife and the changing seasons, he makes profoundly simple observations. He wasn't the type of man who cared about twitter feeds, internet memes, skinny jeans, or sitcom arcs; he simply wanted to be self-sufficient, know himself and know the world God created. He was the type of man most Americans would recognize, not too long ago. So, if you don't like this documentary, just go ahead and get yourself fitted for Google Glasses or a barcode implant or the Mark of the Beast. You're already half-android.

1445162,A14WPXY4ZA6BQP,B0058JQYE4,Princelight-7,"[1, 1]","These are a superb set of two DVD documentaries filmed mostly by Richard Proenneke who in 1968 at the age of 51 retired from a successful diesel mechanic job in California to live in solitude in contact with Mother Earth: the great outdoors, fresh air, clean pristine land and waters, and even sunshine.  Yes, even sunshine also because he moved to Lake Clark National Park alongside the shore of the famous twin lakes in Southern Alaska.A gorgeous healthy location yet at the dead of winter the temperature can drop down to fifty below and as beautiful as it is teeming with wildlife of all sorts, the place is not suitable for feeble souls especially those who dislike extreme cold weather.Yet Dick Proenneke is not a weak man, but a talented self-sufficient craftsman, mechanic, and carpenter who was obviously up to the challenge of building in a few months an impressive 15' x 11' log cabin complete with a stone chimney and fireplace.What happened to him was that after an illness of six months and for the strength and health of his mind and body he decided to live the rest of his life in harmony with himself and with nature, and what a better place in America for that than Alaska?To be indoors with barefoot contact with the ground (he had few opportunities to be in barefoot touch with Mother Earth) is extremely beneficial and essential for preserving good health so instead of using gravel as he did I would have used clay or packet dirt for the cabin floor.Highly recommended.""I don't think a man knows what he actually can do until he is challenged.""
