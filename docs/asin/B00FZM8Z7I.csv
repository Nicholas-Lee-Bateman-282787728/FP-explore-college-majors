I was going to state that it was the most and least original of the Northern Lights animated flicks, however, the credits say it is based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, 'The Snow Queen; otherwise, I would have rashly compared this film to Lewis's 'The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,' especially for the reluctant role of the title character to The White Witch.  Obviously, Andersen came first.In essence every frosty archetype comes to fruition:  The Abominable Snowman, Northern Lights, talking reindeer, etc., but the sled-on-a-J-slide pace and the special effects are dazzling enough to skate past all the familiar polar retread.There are a few substandard elements for what is mainly a venue for those wanting to satisfy a particular candy crush, but some of the dialogue and delivery are the epitome of cloying caricatures.  Also, as heart-warming as the songs are meant to be, a cursory listen to the venue reveals a very stiff set of lyrics (with the exception of two) that sound forced and lack flow.  You can't tell me the composite soundtrack is up to Disney's usual standards.Don't get me wrong, 'Frozen' is still great entertainment:  It is well-rounded, captivating, and fun to watch.  If anything, delightful characters like Olaf, the Snowman, keep the snow-scape world fresh, funny, and fun.  By all means rent or buy 'Frozen,' but don't expect the next 'Lion King' of Arctic animated films.",4,Undoubted the Year's Best Is Not Necessarily Disney's,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,1634,"['qualify', 'merits', 'triumph', 'year', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Picture', 'should', 'make', 'clear', ""'Frozen"", 'primarily', 'mix', 'visual', 'delights', 'engaging', 'characters', 'magnetic', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'state', 'was', 'most', 'least', 'original', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'animated', 'flicks', 'however', 'credits', 'say', 'based', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'rashly', 'compared', 'film', 'Lewis', ""'The"", 'Lion', 'Witch', 'Wardrobe', 'especially', 'reluctant', 'role', 'title', 'character', 'White', 'Witch', 'Obviously', 'Andersen', 'came', 'first.In', 'essence', 'frosty', 'archetype', 'fruition', 'Abominable', 'Snowman', 'Northern', 'Lights', 'talking', 'reindeer', 'etc.', 'sled-on-a-J-slide', 'pace', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'dazzling', 'enough', 'skate', 'familiar', 'polar', 'are', 'few', 'substandard', 'elements', 'what', 'mainly', 'venue', 'wanting', 'satisfy', 'particular', 'candy', 'crush', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'are', 'epitome', 'cloying', 'caricatures', 'Also', 'as', 'heart-warming', 'songs', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'cursory', 'listen', 'venue', 'very', 'stiff', 'set', 'lyrics', 'exception', 'two', 'sound', 'forced', 'lack', 'flow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'composite', 'soundtrack', 'up', 'Disney', 'usual', 'standards.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'Frozen"", 'still', 'great', 'entertainment', 'well-rounded', 'captivating', 'fun', 'watch', 'anything', 'delightful', 'characters', 'Olaf', 'Snowman', 'keep', 'snow-scape', 'world', 'fresh', 'funny', 'fun', 'means', 'rent', 'buy', ""'Frozen"", 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'next', ""'Lion"", 'King', 'Arctic', 'animated', 'films']",N/A

My daughter was sad when the parents died at the beginning- but let's think:Snow White= mom dies, dad is tricked into marrying an abusive woman who tries to KILL Snow.In the Wizard of Oz= Dorothy no longer has her parents, she has an initially resentful relationship with her family, she also must witness death multiple times, one of those being when SHE kills the witch.Cinderella= mom dies, dad marries abusive woman then dad dies.Hansel & Gretel= can you imagine the trauma of having your father marry a terrible woman who convinces him to leave you in the woods?  Then a cannibalistic witch traps you, makes one of you a servant and plans to eat the other.  THEN you must shove her in an over in order to kill her & escape.Epic= mom takes you and leaves job focused dad, but then she dies & you have to go back to dad.Lion King= do I really need to go here?  I STILL cry.Toy Story= No dad, and toys think they have been forgotten by the person who they love most (look back at Toy Story 2- Jesse's story)Hotel Transylvania= Mom is killed in a fire set by humans!Princess & the Frog= they live in the 'slums' of New Orleans outskirts, dad works himself to the bone, dies while away at war- then teenage girl must support the family.Meet the Robinsons= adoption, repeated flashes & feelings of rejection because his Mom gave him up.And do I even need to say anything about UP???  Good grief- I was traumatized by that!My point being, yes there are some real life-esque moments- but ALL of them are tastefully done and actually started a really good talk between me & my kids (girl age 7, boy age 5) about death and losing people (&pets;) we love.The real beauty about this is an element that was somewhat rejected in Brave.  Young women do NOT need to be saved by a man, or brought back to life or define themselves through a man.  While Anna is quite naively smitten through the story she learns from it and she learns what REAL love is--- a self-less act, that does not NEED to be between a man & woman or romantic.And the sidekicks???  OMG- hilarious, I almost peed myself when Olaf sings about his great wish for summertime.Anna & Kristoff are a lot of fun, and Sven the reindeer is very funny.  Now Elsa- talk about someone who has put the world on their shoulders- and pushed the people she loves away for fear of hurting them (Anna's 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman')... she is one tortured soul- but her 'Let It Go' power ballad will give you chills.The animation is lovely, the setting unique, the characters are VERY 3-dimensional  and they learn and grow as they go, and the story telling has twists you would never expect from Disney--- and best of all for all of us adults, it has some fun and thoughtful things for us too.Really, don't miss out on this one.

When Elsa ends up placing her kingdom in eternal winter, it is up to little sister Anna to seek her out and try and get Elsa to stop the curse. What is so beautiful about this story is the many metaphors racing throughout the story.

1674170,AH93HX89KVQG2,B00FZM8Z7I,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[44, 83]","After seeing Frozen, I came out of the theater saying, ""Yea, it was okay,"" and with most movies I'm not bowled over by, I just leave it at that. But as I repeatedly listened to the music, I realized in retrospect the specific reasons why I wasn't able to lose myself in the movie and come out of the theater thinking it was great. And the problems with Frozen especially bothered me because of all the amazing potential it had which, as an animation buff, I was particularly disappointed it didn't reach. I was also surprised that it was getting such amazing reviews. So I decided to share my thoughts here.Of course kids, especially girls, will probably love it. My 5-year-old daughter certainly did. (Note: Some scenes may be too scary for kids under 5 or sensitive kids, especially the snow monster. It is rated PG, and Common Sense Media recommends it for kids 5-6 and up.) It is an enjoyable romp with a lot of humor, quirky and likeable characters, wonderful visuals, and Grammy-worthy music. If you're only reading reviews of Frozen with your kids in mind, you can stop right here because they won't care about any of the stuff I get into below. Though if you don't like the whole chauvenist-princess-sexy marketing machine aimed at girls (google A Mighty Girl and #NotBuyingIt), that is something I do touch on; there is some bad and some good from Frozen in that area.So this review is mainly aimed at adults who really enjoy animated films. It's hard to understand why so many people think theatrical animated films are targeted just at kids, when Disney's earliest feature films targeted adults even more than children, and the studio targeted adults and kids about equally from Cinderella through Sleeping Beauty, and again from The Little Mermaid until today... and the other studios have followed suit. (And should I even mention Japan?) If Frozen was not one of a plethora of animated movies which target both kids and adults, I wouldn't have bothered writing a review of it. Nor are my complaints due to its being a fantasy; my favorite fictional genres are fantasy and sci-fi, and I understand that fantasy by definition has many surreal elements. And like any genre, the quality of the story it tells can vary. The plot should still hold together and make sense within its fantastical context.I'm surprised this is being touted as the ""First Disney ABC since XYZ."" There is nothing in this movie that was not in Tangled (released only 3 years ago), or Princess and the Frog (4 years ago). There is a bit more musical dialog and that's about it. I also was surprised to see that it's being widely hailed as the best Disney animated film in a generation. What about all the Pixar movies, Tangled, and Wreck-It Ralph? There are too many problems with Frozen for me to consider it as good as most of those movies, much less the best of them. So many animated movies I've seen, whether epic or silly or somewhere in between, have left me feeling inwardly enriched and wanting to see them again, but Frozen did not. It had so much potential: it's inspired by a beloved classic tale, and it's got engaging characters, stunning visuals, and great music... but a muddled plot drags it down. A few media critics have made this same observation. The Seattle Times said ""the important thing that glues all this stuff together--story--is sadly lacking."" The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in ""Frozen is Pretty but Pointless,"" said that ""Whereas the great Disney (and Pixar) flicks are rooted in story, ""Frozen"" makes almost no sense. ...The images are crystal clear, but as a story, ""Frozen"" is mush."" But before I discuss the specific issues with the plot, here are my thoughts on the other aspects of the movie.THE GOOD STUFF- The visuals are gorgeous. I love the Norwegian elements, such as the fjords, ice palace, and rosemaling. The costumes and settings are beautiful also. The animation is top-notch; I love the way the humans move and emote.- The musical numbers are great. After seeing the movie I bought the soundtrack, and I have them almost memorized now, since both my daughter and I love them. ""Let It Go"" has just got to win a Grammy. Though Idina Menzel's vocals seem somewhat too old and country-western for Elsa, and thin out on the high notes, the song still gives me goosebumps. It would have been great to give Kristoff a song of his own to show off Jonathan Groff's voice. ""In Summer"" has a hilarious premise and clever lyrics. I like the multiple meanings in some of the lyrics, such as in ""Fixer-Upper,"" most of which is also applicable to Elsa and Anna's relationship though directed at Kristoff and Anna; and in ""Frozen Heart"" which refers literally to the heart of ice being mined, but also to Elsa's voluntary exile, and to something else that happens later. The biggest problem with the songs is that they had to conform to a flawed plot. I do think there could have been less sing-talking, which seemed out of place; it's painfully obvious this movie is a total setup for a Broadway musical. The score is almost entirely forgettable, which is not surprising. With the exception of a few such as The Lion King and Little Mermaid, most Disney scores (and most film scores) aren't interesting on their own but only serve as background music, as this one does. The exception in my opinion is ""The Great Thaw.""- The main characters are likeable and relatable, with quirkiness and flaws, and great sidekicks (Olaf steals the show!). My only beef with them is that their demographics could have been more diverse and unique. I'll get more into that below.THE STORYNow, about the story. I've seen Frozen twice in the theater, and recently in bits and pieces since we got the video. In the subsequent viewings I've tried to put a mental block on the issues I have with the story, and work harder on suspension of disbelief, to see if it will grow on me, since clearly it is a runaway hit and I'd love to be able to jump on the bandwagon. There are things I definitely enjoy, and things I appreciate more now after repeated viewings, but the story problems still keep me from loving it.To be a great film requires a great story, as Walt Disney well knew and constantly preached and enforced, hacking hours of work if it was tied to a weak story. He, like most true artists, didn't focus on profit; what he cared about was artistic integrity, technological innovation, and excellence in entertainment--which hinges on a good, solid story. Unfortunately, Frozen's plot is all over the place, trying to be too many things at once, and it has too many holes. Most films have some things you can pick apart (like, how did Flounder get that huge statue of Eric into Ariel's grotto?), but the flow of the overall story allows you to overlook them. I have a pretty high tolerance for plot holes, but in Frozen there are so many things that don't add up that the story loses its integrity and seems patchy and forced, which makes it, for me, unrelatable on an emotional level. There are a couple of refreshing twists, but it still uses many staid old archetypes. There are good messages in it but they seem contrived. It all seems so contrived toward specific unrelated ends that it doesn't make sense as a cohesive whole. And many aspects of the movie seem to have mercenary rather than artistic motives, which adds to the story problems.I think that the decisions made for the basic story arc are at the root of the inconsistencies and holes. It's really regrettable that the studio could not find a way to do the original story of The Snow Queen. The protagonist is a little girl named Gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to find and rescue a boy named Kay, her platonic best friend, from the Snow Queen. Helping her along the way are a young robber's daughter, a crow, a reindeer, a plucky princess who would only marry someone intelligent, the intelligent prince, and a few others. The Snow Queen could have made a wonderful villain worthy of Maleficent, or even a somewhat sympathetic or neutral character... but for some reason, Disney Studios has been unable since the '40s to find a good way to ""make her work"" for a movie--even though somehow she works on paper. So instead, they used the story as loose inspiration for another story which stars not one but TWO princesses, and also tries to appeal to boys/men (who are underestimated in their scope of tastes, as are girls/women). The character demographics are where the marketing motives really show through, especially when compared to the characters in The Snow Queen. They tried to create an original story with good marketing/merch value but still give a few nods to Andersen's story, and those two goals clashed. Even if they couldn't find a way to put Andersen's story on film (though I bet Hayao Miyazaki could), I'd like to think Walt Disney would have required a tighter story than the one in Frozen. Here are the specific problems I saw with the plot. *Alert: spoilers in this list!*- There is not enough development of the sisters' relationship before their estrangement. With only one very short scene showing them together as young children, after which they are estranged, it's really hard to find the rest of the story, which hinges on their deep love for each other, that believable. I would have loved to see the demo song ""We Know Better"" in the movie, which is all about the sisters' relationship as youngsters, growing together to seemingly older ages than 5 and 8 (the age they are when their estrangement happens in the movie). My daughter and I both love that song, which is on the deluxe version of the soundtrack. That song is great in another way because they sing about princesses not having to be poised, coiffed and proper, but rather fun, messy and goofy, and sometimes inappropriate and misbehaving. Instead of that song, the opening song is ""Frozen Heart,"" a chant by big manly ice miners shadowed by the young orphan Kristoff. It's a good song, and it's cute to see a young Kristoff and Sven, but it's unnecessary and takes up time which could have been far better served in developing the sisters' early relationship. I have no doubt that this choice was made to add some testosterone to the movie to offset the princess theme.- The king and queen were hapless parents. Why did they have Elsa try to stifle and hide her power instead of learning how to use it? The troll had said she must learn to control it, but that could have been achieved through practice rather than stifling. He also said that fear made it more dangerous, and the king made Elsa more fearful rather than less. And if the trolls knew so much about Elsa's power and how to heal its effects, it's surprising that they didn't have some resources to help Elsa learn how to use it. Why did the king and queen apparently leave Anna to fend for herself and be alone for years while Elsa stayed hidden from her? Why couldn't Anna have still known about Elsa's power and have just been told to keep it a secret? Why did they leave on a sea voyage without a contingency plan for Elsa, saying merely, ""you'll be fine""? How did they not realize that, besides being sucky parenting, all these things would lead to disaster? And of course, the only reason they had to die was so that Elsa could become the Snow QUEEN. And also I guess because if they had been alive when Elsa ran away they would presumably have sent an army after her. And because, you know, parents just simply have to be absent in fairy tales. Sure, bad parents abound both in real life and in fiction, but their decisions were so bad that they seemed to be done purely so the rest of the movie could be the way it was. (For a wonderful take on the parents, look up the funny video How Frozen Should Have Ended, which touches on all of this--I watched it a few months after writing this review... it's good to be validated!)- How did Anna and Elsa manage to avoid seeing each other while living in the same house? Did Elsa have her own wing? Did the family never have dinner together? Didn't any servants or former servants remember Elsa's powers, or have to interact with her? Didn't any courtiers ask about Elsa, the heir to the throne, and wonder why they never saw her? People only seemed to care after the parents died; as Anna tells her, ""people are asking where you've been.""- Anna's staying cooped up in the castle and seeking closeness with Elsa for 10+ years is unrealistic even for a fantasy. A 5 year old would almost certainly have looked for friends elsewhere. If they had been older when the accident happened, it would have been more believable. After she does leave the castle to look for Elsa, Anna is plucky and amazingly socially adept, so why didn't she just go outside and make some friends and look for adventure prior to that time? It's just really odd for her to have willingly stayed isolated for over a decade. If she was forbidden by her parents to go out anywhere, or see any friends or family, it's hard to believe that she would have submitted to that, and it just reinforces the fact that the king and queen were idiots. They ruined both daughters' childhoods, and almost doomed the whole country, through trying to hide Elsa's power from everyone including her sister. Amazing that the girls came out as well as they did, and survived their own near deaths.- After Elsa runs away, Anna gallops off to look for her, refusing help by saying she needs to ""do this alone""-- ""this"" being going into cold mountains at night without supplies or directions. Why did her people let the only remaining heir to the throne set off alone into danger with just a cloak and a horse? (At the end, the officials don't let Hans leave to look for Anna because it's too dangerous and he's ""all we have left."") Good thing Anna stumbled across a supply store and a (luckily honorable) mountain man or she wouldn't have survived for long.- Why was it OK for Anna to trust the mountain man she just met enough to travel alone in the mountains with him, but not to say yes to a fast marriage proposal (about which she gets razzed repeatedly by the mountain man)? That seems a double standard. They acknowledge this irony when he asks her if her parents taught her about strangers, in reference to her fiance, and she edges away and says, ""yeees"" nervously. But instead of making jokes to gloss over a plot hole, it would have been better not to have the hole! Maybe, like Rapunzel, the audience is to assume that Anna can defend herself, though unlike Rapunzel, no evidence of that is shown. I do like that Disney pointed out that fast courtship is foolish, which was probably their way of rescinding the messages from most of their past fairy tale movies in which the couple spends only a few hours with each other before getting married. I love it when Anna tells Elsa of her engagement and Elsa is totally baffled.- If Elsa was truly so concerned about not wanting to hurt Anna or anyone else, why did she create a huge snow monster that almost killed Anna and others? She basically hurt Anna out of fear of hurting her, which doesn't make sense. Maybe we're supposed to see deeper motives, such as perhaps Elsa's shame of her power or her desire to no longer be restricted in its use. But if those are her deeper motives, one wonders why they didn't overtake her before now... how would she have tolerated imprisonment in her room for over 10 years if not motivated primarily by love? Maybe this was the closest they could get to making her like the Snow Queen. Or maybe Disney just needed to inject something really scary, as they almost always do. I have long wondered why almost all the princess movies have terrifying scenes in them!- When Kristoff takes Anna to see the head troll, even though Anna needs help urgently, the other trolls don't wake him up from his nap right away but instead spend several minutes singing about Kristoff and Anna's romantic potential. Sure, we've got time for a musical number, let's go for it! Of course as soon as the song is over, the head troll manages to make time for them, Anna collapses and Kristoff frantically tries to get her back to town, racing against every second on the clock.- Concealing Hans' duplicity until near the end meant that the audience couldn't have any hint of Anna or Kristoff's feelings for each other, which made their admitting feelings at the end seem forced and sudden. It also made some of Hans' actions at the beginning not make sense. They had to add incongruous elements in order to keep fooling the audience. At least the 'act of true love' was between the sisters and not romantic, which was refreshing.- The country's officials were far took quick to make Hans their new leader. They had no proof of anything he told them: Anna's death, Elsa's treason, or his exchanging marriage vows with Anna. They accepted his word on all of it without question and begged him to take over.- Elsa suddenly learned how to control her powers with no explanation other than, ""Love! That's it!"" and a lifelong problem was solved. She was so full of love for Anna and her entire kingdom that she hid herself away for over a decade, so why was that not enough before? Maybe it was the 'love drives out fear' principle? Maybe it was realizing how much she was loved? Maybe she realized she had to consciously focus on her love? Whatever it is, I hope she passes the revelation on to the trolls, who strangely knew everything about her powers except how to control them.THE CHARACTERSI mentioned above that the characters lack diversity, and here's what I mean:- The supporting cast is all male. True, the two main characters are female. But why make the rest of them male? It was probably to try to appeal to the male population whom they presumed would have no interest in a mostly female cast, which I'm sure is why the movie's name, trailers and posters weren't feminine... sneaky marketing strikes again! As for the two lead females, while they do show resourcefulness and strength of character, they also still retain some negative female stereotypes. Anna, though brave, plucky and selfless, is also nave and ditzy, desperately wants a man, and has men helping/saving/romancing her throughout the movie. Elsa is strong and self-reliant, but dysfunctional and over-sexualized. My 5 year old daughter and her friends love Elsa because she's ""so pretty"" when she turns into the snow queen, but I was bothered by how vampy Elsa becomes in that scene, with more makeup, swaying hips, high heels and a skin-tight dress with a long slit. Wow, a 19th century Norwegian suddenly channels Dolly Parton! Were they trying to appeal to males in another way? Or maybe they were trying to give her some 'bad girl' flair for that number. (It's certainly not the first instance of a sultry female in a Disney animated feature--Esmeralda's pole dance, Jasmine and Jessica Rabbit come to mind.)- 3 of the 4 main characters are royalty of marriageable age: Two eligible princesses (read: cash generators) who can be made into Barbie-esque dolls, and 2 eligible males. Why do we need yet more princesses in the already bloated line up? We don't; Disney just wants the revenue. For 50 years there were only 3 princesses; in just 24 years they've added 9 more. As a wise uncle said to his niece about the Rapunzel merchandise, ""Disney made a new movie so that they can sell you more dolls."" (I predict their next movie will be ""The Twelve Dancing Princesses,"" maybe called something liked ""Blistered."") By contrast, Gerda and the robber's daughter are brave, strong, capable, non-noble girls around 10 years old who have no love interests. I bet that if Gerda and her friends had been used, girls would have loved them AND would have been enriched for it. And if they really wanted a princess element, they could have used The Snow Queen's princess and prince for that, as part of the supporting cast. Girls love Merida for her youth, spiritedness, strength, skill, normal looks and unkempt hair, but Disney decided to do a ""princess"" makeover on her anyway for the merchandise, making her older and sexy--which caused an uproar among parents, girls, and even the creator of Brave, which Disney staunchly ignored.- All the humans are white. The humans in their last 9 feature films were also all Caucasian (i.e. white-non-Hispanic). In fact, the humans in 80% of Disney's feature films since 1970 are Caucasian (33 Caucasian, and 8 non-Caucasian), and for no good reason; there are plenty of places where non-white characters could have been used and weren't. With Frozen, there are now 8 white Disney Princesses vs. 4 non-white, and unbelievably, 3 of those 4 have been lightened in the Princess merchandise! (The porcelain-skinned Elsa, being a queen, may not be an 'official princess,' but I'd say she's #9, because little girls really love her. Her hair and skin got even lighter after her transformation.) Tumblr's ""This Could Have Been Frozen"" highlights the lack of diversity in Disney characters. Memo to Disney execs: Europe is not the only source of great stories, culture, princesses, or fairy tales. Caucasians make up 60% of the U.S. and just 16% of the world. Diversity in film matters for many reasons, but here's just one: ""Disney is the largest media conglomerate in the world, and the Princess brand is one of its most successful marketing tools. ...In 2009, two doctors, Sharon Hayes and Stacey Tantleff-Dunn, did a study on animated characters and young girls' self-image. After watching clips of cartoon characters who were princesses, the participants were asked what made a 'real princess.' The results might be different from what you would expect: these girls, around the ages of six and seven, generally did not report having a desire to be thinner after studying and watching the narrow-waisted princesses. Instead, when asked how they could become a princess, many of the girls reported that they would need to change their skin color. They responded with things like 'I'd paint myself white' and 'I would change from brown skin to white skin.'"" (From SPARKsummit's excellent article ""Bright Like a Diamond, White Like a Princess."") Recently my daughter brought home a coloring page of Elsa and Anna, on which she had colored Elsa's skin a very light beige, and Anna's peach--the slight difference in their skin color was something she noticed. She always colors characters with their actual skin and hair colors; she colors Jasmine, Tiana, Pocahontas and some of the fairies brown, so I'm glad that those characters exist. But more diversity is definitely needed in Disney movies.",3,A potentially great movie is marred by a muddled plot,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,22600,"['seeing', 'Frozen', 'came', 'out', 'theater',

The elder sister, Elsa, was born with the ability to create ice and snow with the wave of her hands, which delights the younger, effervescent Anna. When Elsa slips and accidentally blasts Anna with her icy magic, the King and Queen race Elsa and Anna into the deep woods to seek help from local trolls. The father troll heals Anna, but removes her memories of Elsa's magical abilities. He also warns Elsa that her powers are beautiful, but dangerous. Elsa's greatest enemy will be fear.The King and Queen immediately shut Elsa away from the rest of the world, closing the castle gates to keep her powers secret and to keep her safe. Elsa, in turn, locks herself away from Anna, who doesn't understand why her best friend doesn't want to play anymore. As the years pass, Anna tries less and less to repair the broken relationship with Elsa, who fears not only her powers, but also any emotions which may cause her powers to flare.Years later, when the girls have become women, Arendelle opens its doors for Elsa's coronation as Queen. Elsa [Idina Menzel] dreads the ceremony, for she must remove her gloves, the very gloves she believes will hold back her monstrous power. Anna [Kristen Bell] is jubilant; she's been alone for so long she's starved for attention. The coronation is to be her first party ever and all the food and dancing and handsome suitors. What if she meets one today? What if she meets The One?Enter Prince Hans of the Southern Isles [Santino Fontana], who literally sweeps Anna off her feet. It isn't long before Anna decides she's found True Love and marches in to get Elsa's blessing. Elsa, meanwhile, is struggling to keep her powers at bay, so when Anna announces her engagement to a man she just met, the two begin an argument that boils over when Elsa freezes the floor and fountains in front of all their guests.Elsa is horrified. Anna is confused. And the people lead by the arch, villainous Duke of Weaseltown declares Elsa a monster and a sorcerer. Elsa flees across the fjord, freezing the bay and (unintentionally) turning summer into a permanent, never-ending winter. The Duke wants to send his armed men after the monster, but Anna convinces them to hold back, telling Prince Hans to keep Arendelle safe from the Duke's greedy hands. Anna fearlessly sets off alone to bring her sister home and save the kingdom from the deep freeze. Along her journey, she picks up a few sidekicks, a mountain man named Kristoff, a reindeer named Sven (who does NOT talk), and a talking snowman named Olaf. But, even with Anna's new friends, the questions remain; does Elsa want to come home?Winner of two Academy Awards - Best Animated Feature Film & Best Original Song, for 'Let It Go' - 'Frozen' is the 53rd animated film produced by Walt Disney Studios Animation. It has earned more than a billion dollars at the worldwide box office, making it the most successful (non-sequel) animated feature film of all time.Co-directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, who share story credit with Shane Morris (Lee also wrote the screenplay), 'Frozen' was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen', a project Walt Disney himself wanted to make some seventy years earlier. What we have now is both wonderfully modern and classically Disney. Wait, that's not exactly right. A better way to describe this computer-animated fairy-tale-musical is to say it is classic era Disney fairy-tales from the '30s and '40s... fused with the blockbuster Disney musical renaissance of the early '90s... animated with the tools of post-modern PIXAR CGI. Its closest sibling is probably the revisionist 'Tangled'.'Frozen' is an extremely entertaining animated musical that harkens back to classic Disney fairy-tales while putting a modern spin on things that may or may not be socially important. This is clean entertainment for the entire family. I loved every single frame of it, from the musical numbers to the action sequences to the sight gags, save for one thing. The end credits switch to a pop star version of &#34;Let It Go&#34;, performed by Demi Lovato. I'm sure Ms. Lovato is a wonderful person, but compared to Ms. Menzel... it's a little underwhelming.Blu-ray 3D Video Quality &#8211; 'Frozen - 3D' skates onto Blu-ray 3D with a highly dimensional, gorgeous 1080p encode framed in the film's original 2:24:1 aspect ratio. This is an outstanding 3D release, and watching 'Frozen' in the third dimension is now my preferred way to experience it. There's no apparent loss in colour vibrancy or brightness despite the 3D glasses. Unlike some releases, the 3D actually adds to the whole experience. This is a highly dimensional film. The entire world of Arendelle comes alive in this format. The sets, the characters, the action...it feels like you are inside the movie. Especially when it's snowing as the flakes tend to come out of the screen. Olaf's carrot nose, while never really poking you in the eye or distracts the viewers, but it does seem to stick out into our world too. And, for those who have ghosting-prone displays (as I sometimes do), I didn't see much of a problem.Blu-ray 2D Video Quality &#8211; Aside from the slightest hint of banding during the Walt Disney Animation Studios logo, aka material NOT created for this movie specifically, 'Frozen' is another reference quality CGI animation Blu-ray. Your display's ability to reproduce the colour white is sure to be tested here, as the movie balances many snowy landscapes during day and night sequences. Colours are bright and bold and beautiful, from the elegant costumes to the sparkling magical ice to the auroras in the night skies. Black levels are expectedly inky, in particular a semi-transparent sheet hung over a painting early in the film's running time. Detail and resolution are resplendent as well. To be fair, Walt Disney Animation Studios doesn't render textures in the almost-photo-realistic Pixar way, but wood grains and individual snowflakes and strands of hair make for a visual feast. There's so much to see in the 'Frozen' world, and all of it is here in a two dimension setting so clear, it feels somewhat three dimensional. In a word: gorgeous.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; 'Frozen' sings and roars its way onto Blu-ray with a dynamic 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound mix which will sure to please the  audiophiles addicts amongst us. While 'Frozen' starts out a little light on aggression and grunt, that's okay. We're first rewarded with the room filling orchestrations of composer Christophe Beck, who partners with Norway's Frode Fjellheim for &#34;Eatnemen Vuelie&#34; (&#34;Song of the Earth&#34;). From there we race through time and musical numbers where the voices are crystal clear and the effects nice and punchy. Once the action moves out of the castle's safety, the track really rises to the aural occasion. Blowing storms and growling wolves and wooshing sleds highlight the mix's articulate panning. And then there's the thunderous roar of the snow monster. It first appears when Elsa creates a new friend to guard her fortress of solitude ice castle. It's definitely a lot of fun if you like that sort of thing.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Blu-ray 3D - 'Get A Horse! [6:00] The Walt Disney Animation Studios short that played before the film's theatrical release. It features Mickey Mouse fighting Peg-Leg Pete over Minnie Mouse through different styles of animation, both classic hand-drawn B&W; as well as modern CGI in full widescreen colour. It's clever a lot of fun and is truly and terrific use of 3D.Blu-ray 2D - 'Get A Horse!' [6:00] The Walt Disney Animation Studios short that played before the film's theatrical release. It features Mickey Mouse fighting Peg-Leg Pete over Minnie Mouse. It's clever and fun, but sadly, this one works a lot better in 3D.Music Videos [15:42] Demi Lavato (in English), Martina Stoessel (in Spanish & Italian), and Marsha Milan (in Malaysian) perform their &#34;End Credit&#34; versions of the Academy Award winning song, &#34;Let It Go.&#34; I still prefer the original Idina Menzel version, but Marsha Milan is also an incredible singer.The Making of 'Frozen' [3:18] You might have seen this video online. Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, and Kristin Bell lead a fun musical number inside the Disney Animation building in Burbank, poking fun at the fact they didn't make an actual making-of featurette.D'frosted: Disney's Journey From Hans Christian Andersen to 'Frozen' [7:28] A short piece covering Walt Disney's history in translating fairy-tales into animated motion pictures.Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee [6:51] Four unfinished deleted scenes can be accessed, with introductions from the co-directors, with Play All. Or, you can watch them individually: Never Underestimate The Power of Elsa / The Dressing Room / Meet Kristoff 1 / Meet Kristoff 2Original Teaser Trailer [1:32] An Olaf-heavy teaser that evokes the world, but not the story. Definitely feel free to watch this and do NOT worry about spoilers.Finally, 'Frozen' is quite simply one of the best Disney Princess movies ever made. This engaging musical is firmly grounded in its classic Disney roots while blazing a new path. It is also an important display of fully-rounded female characters, balancing heroics and flaws and fears. More than the most refreshing animated surprise of 2013, Frozen is a lovingly crafted, wonderfully nuanced dual-princess fairy tale for the modern age. It isn't quite as well-rounded or gender-neutral as Tangled, and it probably shouldn't have defeated Miyazaki's The Wind Rises for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, but none of that should detract from everything Frozen accomplishes. Disney's Blu-ray release is excellent too... if, that is, you're willing to overlook its terribly anemic half-hour supplemental package, which offers very little insight into the film's production. Fortunately, perfect video and audio have a way of softening the sting of any disappointment, and the studio's stunning video presentation and outstanding DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track do just that. (And then some.) Not everyone will warm to Frozen's charms, but I suspect those who do, essentially anyone who gives the 70-years-in-the-making animated musical a fair shot, will still be watching the film in twenty years with a new generation of children and grandchildren. This why I am so pleased to add this to my ever increasing Walt Disney Blu-ray Collection and will give me lots of enjoyable and is worth viewing again, as there is so much visual treats and I suspect each time I view this Blu-ray, I will see different aspect of this stunning Walt Disney Animation.

1674180,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00FZM8Z7I,Andrew Ellington,"[399, 465]","And this will teach us all not to judge a book by its cover ever again.When the trailer for &#8216;Frozen&#8217; was dropped a few months back, I predicted a dud.  It looked so generic and obvious and unfunny and repetitive and just everything I didn&#8217;t want it to be.  When news of the film broke I was ecstatic.  Disney, doing another musical, basing it off of a very dark and disturbing tale.  I knew it would get white washed a bit (which I was fine with), but it was a MUSICAL and so I was automatically game for it.Then that trailer deceived me.Still, my daughters were hooked with the very first television spot, and they&#8217;ve had the dolls for nearly a month already, and so we were going to see this opening night.  With expectations low (despite some good early ink), there was nowhere to go but up for this film, and it didn&#8217;t just go up, it blew through the roof!  Yes, &#8216;Frozen&#8217; is easily Disney&#8217;s best film since &#8216;Beauty and the Beast&#8217; and honestly, one of the best musicals since.  It&#8217;s a visual feast, charming and sincere, and an unexpected twist on a tale of love, family and acceptance with beautiful shades that make this something truly special.The film tells the story of two sisters, Anna and Elsa.  In early childhood, they are joined at the hip.  Elsa has an ancient power to create ice (a power that is never explained, and quite frankly doesn&#8217;t need to be) and they use her power as an advantage to their playing.  When an accident occurs and Anna is injured, Elsa becomes terrified of her &#8216;gift&#8217; and basically locks herself away from everyone and everything, including Anna.  The two obviously drift apart (&#8216;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&#8217; is a marvelous musical moment and brought tears to my eyes) and after the loss of their parents things only get worse.  Now fully grown, Anna is a nave and desperate young woman seeking any attention she can get, and Elsa is distant and misunderstood.  On the night of Elsa coronation things go amuck and her secret is exposed to disastrous consequences, and soon Elsa is forced to flee and Anna is left to track her down and &#8216;thaw&#8217; her town.Now, many have balked before seeing the film that Anna is reduced to yet another Disney stereotype, a girl who needs a man to get the job done.  Ignorance is bliss, I suppose, but &#8216;Frozen&#8217; certainly takes a different approach that the one expected and presents us with a lovable tomboy, a klutz who takes risks and places faith and is willing to &#8216;take the bull by the horns&#8217;, even when its beyond her reach.  Sure, she is aided by a man, but she doesn&#8217;t need him around (and even the twist at the end where it could have easily fallen into stereotype of &#8216;man saves the day&#8217; turns out to be even more sincere and honest in the way it finally comes out).  Anna is a great role model for young girls (and surprisingly, so is Elsa) and the beautiful bond created by Disney here is unlike anything I&#8217;ve seen them do before.Yes, while the film does eventually give is an antagonist (albeit ever so briefly and the way the villain is handled is light and a very nice change of pace), the beauty of &#8216;Frozen&#8217; is that the chief antagonist is not a singular person but the inner struggle to be accepted and understood.  Elsa is not a monster, she is simply scared or herself and what she may do to those whom she loves.  &#8216;Frozen&#8217; does a marvelous job of portraying the bond between sisters and the lengths each will go to protect and love the other.My daughter was in tears over their separation; that is how heartfelt this portrayal is.&#8216;Frozen&#8217;, in my eyes, is one of the best things Disney has done; ever.  The film is a modern-day classic and one that is sure to be remembered and regarded as a beloved nod to the Disney Renaissance with obvious modern twists and its own identity.  I&#8217;m not exaggerating when I say that I can see this being spoken of in the same circles as &#8216;Beauty and the Beast&#8217;, &#8216;Cinderella&#8217; and &#8216;The Little Mermaid&#8217;.  While &#8216;Tangled&#8217; certainly helped Disney regain their footing after some serious dips in quality, &#8216;Frozen&#8217; completely redeems them and proves that they are still as magical as they ever were.Take that Pixar!And let&#8217;s just talk about the musical angle for just a moment.  This is one of those rare gifts that actually feel like a true Broadway show.  The use of music is integral to the feel of the story, and the glorious visual expanse helps create an epic and &#8216;larger than life&#8217; reality.  When Elsa has her big number (&#8216;Let it Go&#8217; is one of the greatest Disney ballads of all time, easily) you can feel the goose-bumps and your heart starts beating faster.  This is a beautifully nostalgic reminder of the power of Disney, and it helps bring those same chills and thrills to a new and younger generation.  I have never seen my daughter so excited to be watching a film as I saw her while watching &#8216;Frozen&#8217;.It carries a different feeling.",5,The magic of Disney!,1386720000,"12 11,

Only now I know I did never find the classical Disney any entertaining.Too soap opera-y, too dreamy, too childish, too unbearable, too cliche.And the musicals? Nothing creeps me more than the musicals. I have to hand it to Disney: it keeps on perpetuating the toxic idea to young females about &#34;true love&#34; (usually in the form of some cute hunky guy who at first quarrels with them quite a bit but always and always puts up with their childish behavior like a tolerant father figure). Get it girls? Be as dreamy and clumsy and air-headed as you can, some guy out there will love you anyway.Name one classical Disney movie whose female protagonist doesn't yearn for love (for a prince charming, particularly) from the beginning to the end?No wonder why Disney's successful movies are with Pixar, by large. Because Disney, you're getting old!Just half way, I already figured out the whole plot and napped through the rest. It's that predictable. The pace is too slow.

I finally got to watch it and was not disappointed - it deserves all the acclaim and allocades and more.The Kingdom of Arrendale has two princesses, Anna the younger and Elsa the older.  Elsa also has an ability to create ice and snow, which during a night of play accidentally hurts Anna.  This causes her and her parents to fear her ability, despite the wise trolls advice,  and to seal her away.  But when the parents die, Elsa becomes queen and on the night of the coronation her ability comes out during an argument with her sister.  Now Anna must figure out how to bring Elsa back and free their home from the frozen state it is in.This movie reminds me of the old days of Aladdin, Lion King and Beauty and the Beast (two of those won best picture before the Acadamy made an Animated category).  Songs both serious and goofy are throughout the movie and appropriate for the moments they come out.  Characters were well done, from the enthusiastic Anna, to the quiet Kristoff, to the comedy relief of Sven the Reindeer and Olaf.

The first film I took my daughter to see in the theaters was 'The Princess And The Frog' and the first film we ever saw in 3D was 'Tangled'.  Both of those films absolutely dazzled and captivated us with the character arcs, the animation, and the amazing music.  So, when we first saw the trailer for 'Frozen', everyone was excited to see what great Disney memory would be created next.  I'm sorry to say that the film just fell flat.  The characters didn't seem well developed and the music seemed to be more like something off of Top 40 radio than it did our of the mind of Disney composers.I will give them credit for the old college try.  They did try to introduce (and almost make fun of) those Disney themes of young princesses falling in love and being proposed to in less than a day, but it didn't quite get there.  The one shining point in the entire film and the thing that gives it 3 stars is the walking-talking snowman, Olaf.  There was something wonderfully noble about his character that made him stand out.  Truthfully, I find it hard to remember anything much else remembering about that film except for the scenes Olaf were in.At the end of the film, even my daughter, who has a habit of bursting into Disney song at the drop of a hat said &#34;I give that a 6 out of 10.

There is lots of emotional tension between the parents and eldest daughter, between the two sisters, then between the monsters & bad guys and the other characters. Not for kids sensitive to such things.3) Sometimes the ladies were not dressed as modestly as some might desire (slits in skirt up above knees, low collars, etc). Just FYI for those who care about such things :)PROs:1) Ahhhhhhhhhhh..... wow!  The scenery was goooooorrrrrgeous! I can't rave enough about the cinematography of the piece! Beautiful ice castles. Beautiful costumes. Cute snowman. Interesting people...2) The songs were beautifully sung and very catchy. I foresee people using these songs in talent shows around the country in the yeas to come...3) The story line was very sweet and taught good lessons: (A) we all have talents and we can use these for good or ill, (B) love is about character choices, not just feelings, (C) love overcomes fear [very biblical analogy, if you ask me, as well as scientific... did you know that if you think positive thoughts they combat negative ones?

When I first began watching it, I was sucked in instantly by the somewhat dark plot at the beginning. Now near the beginning and in the middle it may be slightly overkill with the songs however the movie is so amazing it doesn't bother you.What sets this apart from all the others is how unique it is. And its new and different. Instead of it being the usual cliche story of the woman needing true love's first kiss, a handsome prince to kiss her, it focuses on something much more pure/innocent.Instead it is about a princess and a queen who are sisters. Queen Elsa has beautiful but deadly powers of ice and snow. After injuring her little sister Princess Anna by accident, Elsa struggles to control her magic and Anna's memories are removed of the powers when they are 18.When they are 18, an argument between the sisters causes Elsa to freeze the palace and put the kingdom in an eternal winter and she flees.So Anna must now journey to find her sister with the help of an ice deliverer, his loyal Reindeer and a comical and cute Snowman brought to life. The previews make Frozen look cute and like just a simple sweet Disney film.But in truth you'll be surprised to see how much darker it is for a Disney film.

I for one am tired of all this gay rights etc. Recently Disney pulled its support of the Boy Scouts because they won't allow gay leaders. To start with all these people have to do is keep their mouth shut and no one will know, but they have to declare their gayness. Second the BS won a Supreme Court decision that they didn't have to allow gay leaders and now years later Disney comes out of nowhere and makes this statement. Third the woman that now runs the Muppets inc. came out in support of gay marriage, a property of Disney. Walt is spinning in his grave. Sorry, but this is a perversion just like child molesters, rapists etc. A lifestyle choice.

Maybe I'm more old school, but I didn't think the music was that memorable or exciting.  Beauty & the Beast is the pinnacle of Disney animation to me, in terms of character development, plot and story-telling.  I also think it does a better job of using music to push the plot forward than Frozen does.  In Frozen, the characters just kind of sing what they're thinking.  They sing about a specific moment they're currently involved in.  They tell, don't show.  In Beauty and the Beast, the characters express their changing emotions while interacting with each other in a way that shows more than tells.  That right there makes it better writing, in my opinion.  At least in terms of the music.Still, Frozen is cute.  The main characters - both boys and girls - are all 3 dimensional and the fact that it's focused on the love of a family (sisters) more so than romantic love really touched me.

1674245,A2DONKOXI3JU6A,B00FZM8Z7I,Ben Moore,"[1, 2]","As a father of a daughter, one of the things that we always struggle with and wince through on many &#34;Princess&#34; movies (especially the older movies) is the common theme which centers around the random prince swooping in to save the day.  As a parent of a strong willed, intelligent, beautiful little girl, I'm not trying to raise someone who needs a strange prince to show up to make her life complete.  At this point, I think I have some time... she isn't even 4 yet... but seriously.  That was one of the things that I really enjoyed about Brave... the culmination of the movie wasn't the princess being saved by a prince, it was a princess saving her family.Frozen takes that kind of strong willed female character and moves it forward.  While there are some small love story qualities throughout the movie, they are mostly sub-plots with the major story arc being centered on the love shared between two sisters.  In fact, early on in the movie, one of the sisters points out that the idea of marrying someone you just met that day is a little ridiculous.  We've come a long way from Snow White, Sleeping Beauty (thank goodness).The story is quite good and the characters are all entertaining in their own right.  A quick word of caution, this is a MUSICAL.  Now, I'm sure you are saying... come on Ben, we know it's got music in it... this is a Disney movie they always have singing.  You're right, they do, but this has a LOT of musical numbers.  This isn't a bad thing, most of the songs are really quite good.  But if you have a strong aversion to musical characters that sing for no apparent reason this might be helpful to know before you pick it up.  At the very least, you have been warned. :)  A quick easter egg for you as well... in the first few minutes, right when Princess Anna throws open the doors and walks out (singing of course) pause the movie.  Look at the lower left of your screen and you will find Rupunzel (with her short brown haircut) and Flynn Ryder walking up the path.  Just discovered that this morning and it was pretty cool to watch my daughter's reaction when she saw it too.I hate reviews that give away the whole plot, but the quick version is this is a story about true love, betrayal, coming into your own, and being true to yourself.  The focus on two sisters works well in my opinion and is a welcome shift to stronger more independent female leads in movies that are most frequently targeted towards little girls.  This is now a very popular request and I've seen it multiple times in the last few days, it hasn't made me crazy yet... in fact I still enjoy it.  Hopefully that holds out after 100+ viewings.

The older daughter (Elsa) is has the ability to create ice/snow through anything she touches with her hands/feet.  Why Elsa has this ability is never explained.  Elsa accidentally hurts her younger sister while playing one day and is segregated from her younger sister so she won't hurt her again.In the meantime the parents die unexpectedly while taking a voyage.The two sisters then re-unite and invite the townspeople and others living abroad to Elsa's coronation to take over as queen.Something predictable happens and the rest of the movie is spent with the sisters battling, then re-uniting for the happy ending.Personally, I found the movie to be completely lacking in story-telling and character development.  There were no real villains, just a few individuals with greedy aspirations that were somewhat hard to believe (Hans).The supporting characters (snowman, trolls) did not add much to the film and the movie dragged on to a predictable but disappointing ending.My wife and kids enjoyed the movie and it is okay but if you compare it to films like Tangled or Brave my feeling is that you will come away feeling like it should have been much better.",2,Weak movie by Disney/Pixar standards,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,1326,"['Took', 'wife', 'kids', 'see', 'Thanksgiving', 'holiday', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best.The', 'story', 'king/queen', 'who', 'have', '2', 'young', 'daughters', 'older', 'daughter', 'Elsa', 'ability', 'create', 'ice/snow', 'anything', 'hands/feet', 'Why', 'Elsa', 'ability', 'never', 'explained', 'Elsa', 'accidentally', 'younger', 'sister', 'playing', 'one', 'day', 'segregated', 'younger', 'sister', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'again.In', 'meantime', 'parents', 'die', 'unexpectedly', 'taking', 'voyage.The', 'two', 'sisters', 'then', 're-unite', 'invite', 'townspeople', 'others', 'living', 'abroad', 'Elsa', 'coronation', 'take', 'over', 'queen.Something', 'predictable', 'happens', 'rest', 'movie', 'spent', 'sisters', 'battling', 'then', 're-uniting', 'happy', 'ending.Personally', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'completely', 'lacking', 'story-telling', 'character', 'development', 'were', 'real', 'villains', 'just', 'few', 'individuals', 'greedy', 'aspirations', 'were', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'believe', 'Hans', '.The', 'supporting', 'characters', 'snowman', 'trolls', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'film', 'movie', 'dragged', 'predictable', 'disappointing', 'ending.My', 'wife', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'okay', 'compare', 'films', 'Tangled', 'Brave', 'feeling', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better']",N/A

Fighting the elements to save their home from destruction, we see them encounter magic at every turn.

1674272,A3FNQG7QWNP0RC,B00FZM8Z7I,Bob the Skull,"[1, 9]","Going into &#34;Frozen,&#34; I had decided that it was probably not going to be my thing.  Yes, my mind was made up before I went in; and yes, sure enough, I  found that I disliked the movie.  However, to my complete surprise, I didn't dislike the movie for the reasons I had expected.  I had feared from the commercials - and let me take a minute to note that &#34;Frozen&#34; has some of the most ghastly, clich&eacute;d congealed tripe for commercials that I have ever had the profound displeasure of being unable to avoid -  that &#34;Frozen would be exactly what the majority of movies seem to be: absolute twaddle interlaced with infuriatingly vapid humour (obviously aimed at children, for which children should feel insulted), all wrapped up in a self-appointed mantel of trendy fabulous-ness - grossly undeserved.  In truth, &#34;Frozen&#34; is something much worse: what was obviously once an incredibly earnest, somewhat clumsy movie with all of the trappings of a classic which was swiftly mugged by ham-handed idiocy.&#34;Frozen&#34; got off on the right foot by introducing both sides of a conflict and permitting us the chance to understand both; at which point, my expectations began to melt.  I mean, come on: how often do we get to see this happen AND ALSO not feel like braining both parties with a hefty rock?  But it didn't stop at the opening.  The characters seemed delightful and the story began to appear more and more promising with each passing second.  Shockingly for me, I even began to forget about the insipid media slots and concentrate on the story unwinding in front of me - feeling slightly dumbfounded.  Even the fact that the songs fell a little too thick and furious (it's a musical, Disney; not a competition to see who can make the most songs evaaaaar) did nothing to slow down the evaporation of my of doubts; it seemed to me that I had grossly underestimated this movie, and would be purchasing it on Blu-ray ASAP.  That, frustratingly enough, is where things fell down.Perhaps I should have seen it coming - what with the slightly awkward approach to make everything a ditty - but what killed this movie is is mind-rending-ly stupid contrivance paired with a fatal case of clumsiness.  The sudden betrayal of Hans (yeah, spoilers) was not just unexpected, but actually completely out of apparent character.  I mean, sure he's only been introduced for what amounts to approximately one day; but his choices, mannerism, and actions simply don't match up with the cold-hearted villain that he's eventually painted to be.  And if falling in love quickly is one of this story's no-nos, then how come it's all right to fall in love with the rustic peasant after knowing HIM for only half a day more than the prince Herr Hans von Horrible?  Seems a little hypocritical of you, movie.  Or perhaps that's just oversight.  I mean, after all, the love interest character that they (so rudely) shoehorned in didn't actually even develop into a full-blown love interest in the end.  How embarrassing it must be to have your whole point for existing so rudely ripped out from underneath you.  And for what?  To avoid a clich&eacute;?  That seems a little late when you've spent the run-time thus far positively wallowing in them - even if they were delightful.This, then, is the end for &#34;Frozen&#34; in my mind - a whisper, not a bang.  And, frankly, I'm absolutely disappointed.  Despite my initial comments, I would have enjoyed being proven wrong.  It's no fun being right all the time about movies being rubbish; and, for once, I'd like to see a movie that not only thwarts my expectations, but follows through and blows me away.  If you absolutely love the singing, buy the soundtrack.  If you adored the story, read the works of the brothers Grimm.  But please, PLEASE don't buy the film.  We vote with our money, and so buying &#34;Frozen&#34; is a vote for tripe that won't end here.  Soon enough, if we purchase enough products like &#34;Frozen&#34;, we'll be inundated by a wave of half-hearted, ham-handed, C-grade (at best) media - and we'll have no one to blame but ourselves.  After all, they wouldn't have built them if we wouldn't come.To summarize into a TLDR format: promising start which then twists around and breaks the movie's spine - it's garbage.  And, as a side note, my girlfriend (whose idea it was to watch &#34;Frozen&#34; in the first place) told me that it's rubbish - and I'm not even responsible for that opinion.  Plus she's the nicer of us two, so that you should tell you something in and of itself.",2,Disappointing In a Thoroughly Frustrating Fashion.,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,4568,"['Going', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'had', 'decided', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'thing', 'Yes', 'mind', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'went', 'yes', 'sure', 'enough', 'found', 'disliked', 'movie', 'However', 'complete', 'surprise', 'did', ""n't"", 'dislike', 'movie', 'reasons', 'had', 'expected', 'had', 'feared', 'commercials', 'let', 'take', 'minute', 'note', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'most', 'ghastly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'congealed', 'tripe', 'commercials', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'profound', 'displeasure', 'being', 'unable', 'avoid', '34', 'Frozen', 'would', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', 'majority', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'absolute', 'twaddle', 'interlaced', 'infuriatingly', 'vapid', 'humour', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'children', 'children', 'should', 'feel', 'insulted', 'wrapped', 'up', 'self-appointed', 'mantel', 'trendy', 'fabulous-ness', 'grossly', 'undeserved', 'truth', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'something', 'much', 'worse', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'once', 'incredibly', 'earnest', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'movie', 'trappings', 'classic', 'was', 'swiftly', 'mugged', 'ham-handed', 'idiocy.', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'got', 'off', 'right', 'foot', 'introducing', 'sides', 'conflict', 'permitting', 'chance', 'understand', 'point', 'expectations', 'began', 'melt', 'mean', 'come', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'happen', 'AND', 'ALSO', 'not', 'feel', 'braining', 'parties', 'hefty', 'rock', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'opening', 'characters', 'seemed', 'delightful', 'story', 'began', 'appear', 'more', 'more', 'promising', 'passing', 'second', 'Shockingly', 'even', 'began', 'forget', 'insipid', 'media', 'slots', 'concentrate', 'story', 'unwinding', 'front', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'dumbfounded', 'Even', 'fact', 'songs', 'fell', 'little', 'too', 'thick', 'furious', 'musical', 'Disney', 'not', 'competition', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'most', 'songs', 'evaaaaar', 'did', 'nothing', 'slow', 'down', 'evaporation', 'doubts', 'seemed', 'had', 'grossly', 'underestimated', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'purchasing', 'Blu-ray', 'ASAP', 'frustratingly', 'enough', 'where', 'things', 'fell', 'down.Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'what', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'approach', 'make', 'everything', 'ditty', 'what', 'killed', 'movie', 'mind-rending-ly', 'stupid', 'contrivance', 'paired', 'fatal', 'case', 'clumsiness', 'sudden', 'betrayal', 'Hans', 'yeah', 'spoilers', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'unexpected', 'actually', 'completely', 'apparent', 'character', 'mean', 'sure', 'only', 'been', 'introduced', 'what', 'amounts', 'approximately', 'one', 'day', 'choices', 'mannerism', 'actions', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'cold-hearted', 'villain', 'eventually', 'painted', 'be', 'falling', 'love', 'quickly', 'one', 'story', 'no-nos', 'then', 'how', 'come', 'all', 'right', 'fall', 'love', 'rustic', 'peasant', 'knowing', 'HIM', 'only', 'day', 'more', 'prince', 'Herr', 'Hans', 'von', 'Horrible', 'little', 'hypocritical', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'just', 'oversight', 'mean', 'love', 'interest', 'character', 'so', 'rudely', 'shoehorned', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'even', 'develop', 'full-blown', 'love', 'interest', 'end', 'How', 'embarrassing', 'must', 'be', 'have', 'whole', 'point', 'existing', 'so', 'rudely', 'ripped', 'out', 'underneath', 'what', 'avoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'little', 'late', 'when', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'run-time', 'thus', 'far', 'positively', 'wallowing', 'even', 'were', 'delightful.This', 'then', 'end', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'mind', 'whisper', 'not', 'bang', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'disappointed', 'initial', 'comments', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'proven', 'wrong', 'fun', 'being', 'right', 'time', 'movies', 'being', 'rubbish', 'once', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'expectations', 'through', 'blows', 'away', 'absolutely', 'love', 'singing', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'adored', 'story', 'read', 'works', 'brothers', 'Grimm', 'please', 'PLEASE', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'film', 'vote', 'money', 'so', 'buying', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'vote', 'tripe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'here', 'Soon', 'enough', 'purchase', 'enough', 'products', '34', 'Frozen', '34', ""'ll"", 'be', 'inundated', 'wave', 'half-hearted', 'ham-handed', 'C-grade', 'best', 'media', ""'ll"", 'have', 'one', 'blame', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'built', 'would', ""n't"", 'come.To', 'summarize', 'TLDR', 'format', 'promising', 'start', 'then', 'breaks', 'movie', 'spine', 'garbage', 'side', 'note', 'girlfriend', 'idea', 'was', 'watch', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'first', 'place', 'told', 'rubbish', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'responsible', 'opinion', 'nicer', 'two', 'should', 'tell', 'something']",N/A

It was clearly a simplistic take on Anderson's &#34;The Ice Princess.&#34;  Ordinarily, I do not have a problem with this type of feature because that could describe all of the Disney movies  But unlike their adaptation of something like &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34;, the story was not developed and the studio relied on incredible visual effects instead of fleshing out the tale of the 2 sisters.Then there is the music.  I felt it was less like a Disney movie and more like a Broadway play. A lot of the singing was not so much for a song, but as part of a dialogue or monologue. Of course, Disney has done that in the past, but not to the extent of this movie. I must assume that they will want to make this into a Broadway show because of the money they have made in theater adaptations in the past. The movie was cute, but the music (what should be a Disney specialty) was disappointing...nothing memorable to me.That said, my 14 year old loved it.

The soundtrack is fantastic. Be warned - once your kids see this, they will be wanting to watch it again and again and they will be looking for the music video for &#34;Let it go&#34; (title theme) by Idina Menzel on youtube. As a result, you will not be able to get the song out of your head. But it's not nearly as annoying as the title theme to Dora the Explorer, for instance.The only gripe I have - and this is very minor - is that just like in almost every other Disney movie, the parents get killed off. It's very brief and almost incidental to the plot. This is not a spoiler... it happens in the first 5 minutes and sets up why the sisters are left to their own devices, but I wish that Disney could have sent them on a long vacation instead. If I were to count all the Disney movies that have dead or missing parents in them, it would be the vast majority. I don't think it's necessary to support the plot line or drama of the film, and kids don't need to be dealing with that for entertainment purposes.

The plot will be straight forward like any other animation movies for kids."" How wrong I was!Unlike other Disney animation, this film has character development. It convincingly and skilfully shows emotion can bring enormous positive or negative consequences. I have seen it happened many times in reality. It also touchingly demonstrates with family love, one can overcome huge obstacles.Most of the humor is original to me. I like the snowman the best. He makes me laugh heartily multiple times.The animation is first rate. The characters' faces express emotions such as surprise, anger, happiness exactly like human beings. In one scene, Anna stands next to a life-size drawing. My friend said to me: ""Anna in the movie and the people in the drawing are not real. They are characters drawn by the artists.

For example, it one scene, I have the feeling the snow is falling on my face. It is wonderful. These characteristics make me want to watch it many times.The plot has a twist near the end. I did not see it coming. This makes it different than other animation for family viewers.At first, I was a little bit disappointed after finding out it was a musical picture. I did not like it when the characters sang instead of talking. I thought it was not realistic. However, after 10 minutes, I enjoyed it so much that I forgot that it was musical.Wow!

For months I had heard some minor plot lines from friends and family and then when I finally got around to viewing it, I found myself taken off guard. It didn't seem as though it was the same movie they had seen. I'm not saying that in a bad way, it was just like drinking orange juice while thinking about milk and confusing your mind and taste buds...Overall, I found the plot refreshing. The idea of magical &#34;wintering&#34; powers was fun - I often wondered if this was the cause behind the my personal non-stop winter wonderland.The one thing I love about Disney/Pixar movies is the subtly injected &#34;adult humor&#34;. It keeps us entertained in the background as the kids are enjoying talking snowmen.I give this 4 stars because I felt like the plot was a little jerky. Granted, it flowed pretty well and it resolved the major issues, but there were many times where I'd wonder why they chose a certain point in the movie to talk about something versus a different point in the movie. There were some places where answers came too soon or not soon enough. Granted, this is a kids movie and for the most part they probably don't care, but I still think it's important from a writing/entertainment perspective. It was a bit like plot whiplash with no explanation at certain points.I still highly recommend this as a fun family movie for any time of the year!

The characters are likeable and the love story teaches kids about what love really is rather than going with the silly romantic clich&eacute;s that Disney usually relies on.One aspect of the film that tends to get overlooked is how carefully put together the whole thing is. Lines that seem to have no deeper meaning at first become meaningful echoes later on. Even the comedy relief adds to the story and plays into the overarching themes of the film.Frozen is a movie that kids can enjoy, that adults will find entertaining, that casual filmgoers will be amused by, and that film scholars can analyze in a rewarding manner.

Like all Disney movies, it was a great experience for them. I, on the other hand, was disappointed. I left the movie with too many questions. Maybe I thought too hard about it, after all it's a kids' movie, right?I am a great Disney fan but when I started to write this review, I had in mind all the things I didn't like about Frozen. I decided that would be too many. So I'll write what I did like instead.Disney continues to put together visually pleasing animation, whether it's digital or traditional. It's colorful and fanciful. My favorite characters are Olaf and Sven, the snowman and reindeer. The songs were nice. Of course the favorite is Let It Go sung by Elsa. The actress Idina Menzel in the movie sang her heart out in that song. However, the songs had a Broadway feel to it. Instead of dialog, they sang...a lot. A kid in the theater actually said, &#34;Don't tell me she's going to sing again.&#34; But Disney came to their senses and cut down on the songs considerably toward the end of the movie. I have no aversion to Broadway, it was just different than what Disney usually does with its songs.The setting was appropriate (mountains and snow tend to go together) yet its culture didn't come through as well as in the movie Brave. I believe Frozen is set in Norway (I had to look it up). The characters' names tipped me off to the general location. But other than that and the one guy with an accent, I wouldn't have known.Frozen's theme was endearing. It was about love.The movie is about two sisters. The oldest, Elsa, has kept a secret from her sister Anna. She can create/control ice and snow. Incidently everyone finds out when Elsa accidentally brings eternal winter to the land during the summer. Elsa runs away because she's afraid, Anna goes after her. The plot loses focus after this, somewhere in the middle.I have seen Disney do a lot better when it comes to plot and character. I liked the concept but, there is just something off about the story. But it's Disney, so the movie is worth a look.Rating 3.5/5Update: I read the trivia on IMDB.com. This movie had major changes made to it pertaining to the sisters' characters.

1674375,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B00FZM8Z7I,Chris Kennison,"[0, 0]","There is no hope for any other animation studio to overtake Disney as the king of animated cinema. Despite the fact that I've noticed that most of their movies in recent years are more carefully orchestrated than challenging cinema, they have the secret potion. &#34;Frozen&#34; is without question carefully orchestrated to appeal to a wide variety of youths and adults. While the delivery is magical, beautiful and heart-warming is it also easy on the brain and predictable as they come.&#34;Frozen&#34;, based loosely on the Hans Christian Anderson tale, &#34;The Snow Queen&#34;, is as a whole catered toward a certain audience; preteen and above girls. There's princess', romance, singing and dancing and if the entire movie were that way, the boy Disney fans would be squirming in their seats. Disney would never make that mistake though, would they? Absolutely not. Insert a nave little fun-loving snowman named Olaf and a giant frightening snow beast and &#34;Frozen&#34; is no longer just for little girls. It's for everybody who has a heart and wants to enjoy a world where people are sickeningly kind and good-willed for a couple of hours. Well, except for a couple, but you wouldn't have a Disney movie if it weren't for a couple of bad seeds.That being said, &#34;Frozen&#34; may be orchestrated and predictable, but it is also one of the finest visual treats Disney has produced in years. In fact, I will go as far as to predict that it will become, at some point or another, a classic that is viewed by millions every winter. Olaf the snowman may just go down as one of the best sidekicks to a leading character since Hermey from &#34;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#34;.It's a shame that more people in the world aren't as simplistic, genuine and nave as Olaf and Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell). That is the true source of Disney's magic and it is so very simple. We live in a world where we lose our innocence and simplicity way too soon in life. Disney paints a world that we've all forgotten and the kids can relate to. In the movie, Anna falls in love with a prince from Weselton in one-day and wants to be married because she's lonely. While the movie paints this as way too fast and questions what love is, we, in a matter of minutes fall in love with the characters on screen.We've forgotten what it's like to be trusting and openly joyous. &#34;Frozen&#34; explores love and kindness like only the movie studio that built the happiest place on earth can; heavy on the cheese, heavy on the cuteness, heavy on the goofiness, a princess, incredibly visuals, equally incredible sound and beautiful singing from Kristen Bell and Wicked star Idina Menzel. &#34;Frozen&#34; is a Disney classic in the making.This is a 5-star movie that isn't quite as good as the 6-star movie &#34;Tangled&#34;... and it's a 4-star bluray release because THIS version is less of a product than Disney was capable of delivering.  The 3D version of the movie was only released in the UK and I have this 3D version. It is beautiful. I had to have it shipped OVERSEAS to enjoy it. Obviously, Disney has this product available, but American's don't deserve it, or are prime for scalping down the road. Also, what would have been a remarkable behind the scenes movie with Kristen Bell, Olaf and Idina Menzel, is explored in a 'pfft' little video that accomplishes nothing.

The story, based on ""The Snow Queen"", is fairly well developed.  For some reason, though, it felt significantly weaker to me in its emotional impact than earlier Disney movies like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.  I think the reason is because the script is cheesier and has a way of making some of its serious plot developments feel too casual and silly.  What cheapens the script most is the cheap, awkward, slightly silly characterization of the heroine, the kind of persona that made Anne Hathaway's early screen image, and the snowman sidekick was even more obnoxious to me.  His rather effeminate and abnormally goofy reactions were the movie's attempt at comedy, and all of it fell flat for me.  Additionally, the music is lackluster, built upon pop/rock style and on a clich&eacute;d form of the Beauty and the Beast/Little Mermaid Disney musical style.  I recognize, being very musical myself, that writing music which carries great power is very hard to do, but my main criticism of the music on this movie is that the songs don't seem to elevate the experience beyond what words alone could do.  In other words, I don't find the musical format to improve the movie; it would be the same if it had no songs, in my opinion.  The pop/rock style in some of the songs doesn't fit a fairy tale at all, either, which I found annoying.  In sum, the movie offers an amazing visual experience with how it depicts winter and the Snow Queen's special effects, but for me, was annoyingly cheesy and not a special experience.",3,"Outstanding visuals, but weak in major ways",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,1622,"['new', 'computer', 'animated', 'movie', 'unsurpassable', 'job', 'creating', 'beautiful', 'winter', 'visuals', 'story', 'based', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'fairly', 'well', 'developed', 'reason', 'though', 'felt', 'significantly', 'weaker', 'emotional', 'impact', 'earlier', 'Disney', 'movies', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Aladdin', 'think', 'reason', 'script', 'cheesier', 'way', 'making', 'serious', 'plot', 'developments', 'feel', 'too', 'casual', 'silly', 'What', 'script', 'most', 'cheap', 'awkward', 'slightly', 'silly', 'characterization', 'heroine', 'kind', 'persona', 'made', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'early', 'screen', 'image', 'snowman', 'sidekick', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'rather', 'effeminate', 'abnormally', 'goofy', 'reactions', 'were', 'movie', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'fell', 'flat', 'Additionally', 'music', 'lackluster', 'built', 'pop/rock', 'style', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'form', 'Beauty', 'Beast/Little', 'Mermaid', 'Disney', 'musical', 'style', 'recognize', 'being', 'very', 'musical', 'writing', 'music', 'great', 'power', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'main', 'criticism', 'music', 'movie', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'elevate', 'experience', 'what', 'words', 'alone', 'could', 'do', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'musical', 'format', 'improve', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'had', 'songs', 'opinion', 'pop/rock', 'style', 'songs', ""n't"", 'fit', 'fairy', 'tale', 'found', 'annoying', 'sum', 'movie', 'amazing', 'visual', 'experience', 'how', 'winter', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'annoyingly', 'cheesy', 'not', 'special', 'experience']",N/A

1674406,AHMBRRDMGIFV3,B00FZM8Z7I,Conelius III,"[3, 5]","A part of me really wishes I liked this movie, in the end though I'm afraid I just can't. Each viewing cements my position more and more and ultimately I find myself disliking it more each time I watch it. What is the main problem with the film? For me it was the lack of any real substance or character development, particularly in the character of Kristoff.Kristoff is a character who didn't receive his due. What does he want? Where does he come from? What's his motivation? There is no clear answer to any of these questions. But wait you'll say, it's a kids movie and it isn't about Kristoff! It's about the relationship between the two sisters and that love conquers all.I couldn't disagree more. Listen, children are intelligent, if you give them a complex story they'll probably understand it better than adults do. Why then is this story so rushed? Because it's for kids? Well so is every Pixar film but these movies are smart, every character is developed and interesting. Look at the opening of Up, we learn more about Carl and Ellie in 5 minutes than we ever learn about Kristoff in this film.Where did they go wrong? They went wrong when they put so many songs into it and sacrificed character development. This film could have been fine without either Olaf's song or the Troll's song. Both are just padding and serve no point to the story, the Troll song actually goes against the theme of the entire movie. In all honesty a movie should have more emphasis on story and character than anything else. If I don't care about a character than I'm not going to be invested in a song about them (ironically I find the Troll song the most fun one of the film though I think it could have been cut).Everyone likes to say this is the most progressive Disney film but are we forgetting Atlantis, Brave, or Lilo and Stitch? These films do so much for gender roles and story telling but for some reason we don't talk about them and Frozen is labeled the &#34;most progressive,&#34;Finally there is the problem of the song &#34;Let it Go&#34; a song that glorifies selfishness. Now here's the deal with this song, you can say that it is just a song in the film and that Elsa changes after singing this song but the problem is that this is the song everyone seems to be taking away from the film. Everyone seems to only recall the song about selfishness and forget the rest of the message. Remember this song is the villain song of the film, Elsa is the antagonist of the film, you can say it's Hans but what is he guilty of? Political conspiracy? It's a common thing of this time and as we see during the scenes of him taking care of the citizens, who Elsa and Anna ignored, he seems more concerned with the well-being of the average person than any other character. His turn is also just so sudden and unexpected that I cannot help but call nonsense. There is no build-up and in the end it just seems to be a bait and switch.I wanted to like this movie but I just can't, I understand why people like it. It isn't deep, it's easy to understand and no one has to think about it too much.

Hitchman,"[1, 1]","Yes, there seems to be some kind of ""play it really, really, really safe"" disease going on at John Lasseter's animation empire at The Mouse Factory.  Gone are the days of inspired films like ""Toy Story 1&2,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (the ""Heaven's Light/Hellfire"" musical number is so chock full of not-so-subtle adult themes that is an absolutely classic song and the most daring departure for Disney since ""A Night On Bald Mountain"" from ""Fantasia""), ""Aladdin,"" and ""The Lion King.""Many of these current stories and characters are fairly bland, predictable, and cookie-cutter... and they're on a princess kick like no other.  The only things that elevate this beyond the lackluster ""Brave"" (an actual retread of a box office flop in the 90's called ""Brother Bear"") are Kristen Bell's laudable voice-over work as Princess Anna and the occasional, subtly placed adult-level in-joke (few and far between in the ultra-blah ""Brave"").Among Disney's most recent cinema-grade animated releases, ""Tangled"" was superior in story and character development than ""Frozen.""  In ""Tangled"" at least you had a comically roguish leading man as counterpoint to the plucky heroine and a more complex villain as antagonist.  Here that is replaced with two rather underdeveloped guys in the form of Kristoff and Hans with a metaphor for female puberty and entering that quasi-adult stage of sexuality (ie. latent and almost uncontrollable magical powers brought on by emotional urges - watch Elsa's transformation from emotionally repressed waif to va va va-voom, hour-glass vixen in a curve-hugging evening gown replete with slit up the side) instead of a truly dangerous and menacing foe as in some classic Disney films.Without spoiling things, I think it might have been a better choice to amp up the jeopardy facing Kristoff, Anna, and Olaf by having Elsa not only having powers she may not be able to control, but abilities that start seducing her with the temptation of absolute power that just might twist and corrupt her very soul (kind of like Steven King's ""Firestarter"" or ""Carrie"").  Maybe because of that troubled childhood and the fact she shuts everyone out who might guide her on the right path.The 7.1 lossless audio and 1080p video are about as good as one can expect from current Blu-ray technology.  We'll just have to wait and see what the UHD version brings us...  hopefully the Dolby Atmos theatrical object mix besides 2160p resolution and better colors.If you were disappointed in ""Brave,"" you might find enough here to make ""Frozen"" part of your HD collection.

1674432,AE62TIY3899YL,B00FZM8Z7I,"Daniel J. Silva ""Superman_242""","[11, 14]","In what is one of the more anticipated Disney animated features since Tangled, the mousy studio has released its remarkable musical Frozen.  Starring Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars), Idina Menzel (Wicked, Glee), Jonathan Groff (Glee), and Josh Gad (The Book of Mormon Musical, Ice Age: Continental Drift), Disney's latest is fresh, bold, and unique in ways that should be applauded.Loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, Frozen centers on two princesses, Elsa (Idina Menzel), the soon-to-be Queen, and Anna (Kristen Bell) of the fictional Norwegian kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa has the ability to create snow and ice, but suppressed these powers after a traumatic childhood incident involving Anna. After her cryokinetic powers got out of hand during her official July coronation, she goes into hiding, but her emotions trigger a magical, eternal winter that freezes the entire kingdom. The arrogant Duke of Weselton (Alan Tudyk) plots to turn everyone against &#34;the monster&#34; Elsa for his own devilish needs.Let's face it: the marketing for this film has been atrocious.  It has been cryptic to the point of turning folks off of the film.  The synopsis that I just provided above tells you much more than any trailer they've released.  This is too bad, because the film is delightful.Audiences are going to want to compare this to Tangled, which I think is fair, it being the last Disney musical in recent memory.  Tangled is a masterpiece that is a high bar to be up against, but I think Frozen is up to the task.  Therefore, the basis of this review will such a comparison.First off, the music in this true musical (there are 9 musical numbers compared to the 4 in Tangled) is fabulous!  They employed husband-and-wife songwriting team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez to write the songs, and they are fantastic.  I'm listening to the soundtrack as I write this, and it knocks the socks off of Tangled, in my opinion.The vocals are better than Tangled as well, with both Bell and Menzel being better singers than Mandy Moore.  And the amazing voice acting/singing doesn't stop at the leads: Groff and Gad are just as marvelous in their roles.This has been called a feminist film, which I think is true and not in a bad way.  It passes the arbitrary Bechdel test with flying colors, but doesn't try to punch you in the face with any overt feminist messages.  It's just a great movie about two sisters who are trying to navigate their way through the difficult circumstances that they were born to.Visually, the only thing better this year is Gravity.  The 3D is spectacular, although not essential.  The animation is flawless and stunning.Where Frozen falls short of Tangled is in its script.  The script just isn't as tight and the payoff and climax are not nearly as good.  Tangled's ending was so touching and caused me to tear up a bit, where this ending was just plain good and nothing more.  Although, the humor is probably a bit better in Frozen, if only by a hair.Besides a few script issues Frozen will be an instant classic, with its music and voices more than making up for its shortcomings.  I give it a 4.5/5 stars.

1674441,AM6EXX5Z2RUQC,B00FZM8Z7I,Dante M. Alegre,"[1, 2]","It seemed that Disney had run out of decent ideas and songs for animated features somewhere after The Lion King (and yes there was a huge gap of quality work from the early 40s and 50s animated films until The Little Mermaid).  Thankfully, though not officially Disney, Pixar demonstrated a fresh approach to &#34;writing&#34; for animated features if not the huge success of CGA.  Then Disney kept plodding along with concepts from history or mythology without putting much effort into the work and some films I would not even show my children, though obviously Disney thought they were child-oriented (can anyone believe the level of violence in Tarzan?).  My son actually &#34;abandoned&#34; (read: he got up an left) his first viewing of Bolt.  I couldn't continue much longer either.  Brave was refreshingly different and humorous, but did not live up to the level of quality of the early 90s films.  Enter Frozen.  This time, whether Disney actually had a hand in this or simply approved a production by the creators, a very quality film was released.  Not just a quality animated film, a quality film!  Frozen not only deserved the Oscar it won for Best Animated Feature, I believe it was deprived by not getting the nod for Best Film.  I've seen some reviews criticizing what others have called a &#34;Disney formula&#34; of princess' coming of age, but this is a very different story.  Tapped from a Hans Christian Andersen story, this story is vastly different from past &#34;princess&#34; stories in that there isn't really an antagonist.  The story really does revolve around self emergence more so than any of the other Disney stories that attempt this genre mostly because it focuses on the self rather than through brave acts of a protagonist overcoming incredible (and unrealistic) odds.  It also avoids the predicable endings of other Disney films of a Sleeping Beauty/Little Mermaid ending.  Yes there is a bit of fantasy through the magic in the story, but I think it allows the story to be told and leads to some really good songs.  Another well deserved Oscar win was the hit song from the show that my son sings over and over again (he is only 4).  I think two things happened here that Disney should seriously consider in producing more animated films.  Use experienced and quality writers for production.  I can see this film being instantly transferred to the stage on and off Broadway.  The writing was that good and had the unique viewpoints of its characters as well as the openness for improvisation necessary for a good stage production.  The film also hired quality actor/singers already well established for stage productions to not only make the story work, but have quality signing without changing the artist.  Although having already worked with Disney, Idina Menzel also has a quality stage and vocal history.  Josh Gad (Olaf) and Kristen Bell also did a fine job with their songs.  Overall, a high quality piece of work long overdue for Disney.",5,Amazed by Frozen,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,2982,"['seemed', 'Disney', 'had', 'run', 'decent', 'ideas', 'songs', 'animated', 'features', 'somewhere', 'Lion', 'King', 'yes', 'was', 'huge', 'gap', 'quality', 'work', 'early', '40s', '50s', 'animated', 'films', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Thankfully', 'not', 'officially', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'demonstrated', 'fresh', 'approach', '34', 'writing', '34', 'animated', 'features', 'not', 'huge', 'success', 'CGA', 'Then', 'Disney', 'kept', 'plodding', 'along', 'concepts', 'history', 'mythology', 'putting', 'much', 'effort', 'work', 'films', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'show', 'children', 'though', 'obviously', 'Disney', 'thought', 'were', 'child-oriented', 'can', 'anyone', 'believe', 'level', 'violence', 'Tarzan', 'son', 'actually', '34', 'abandoned', '34', 'read', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'first', 'viewing', 'Bolt', 'could', ""n't"", 'continue', 'much', 'longer', 'either', 'Brave', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'humorous', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'level', 'quality', 'early', '90s', 'films', 'Enter', 'Frozen', 'time', 'Disney', 'actually', 'had', 'hand', 'simply', 'approved', 'production', 'creators', 'very', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Not', 'just', 'quality', 'animated', 'film', 'quality', 'film', 'Frozen', 'not', 'only', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'won', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'believe', 'was', 'deprived', 'not', 'getting', 'nod', 'Best', 'Film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'criticizing', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'called', '34', 'Disney', 'formula', '34', 'princess', 'coming', 'age', 'very', 'different', 'story', 'Tapped', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'story', 'story', 'vastly', 'different', 'past', '34', 'princess', '34', 'stories', ""n't"", 'really', 'antagonist', 'story', 'really', 'revolve', 'emergence', 'more', 'so', 'other', 'Disney', 'stories', 'attempt', 'genre', 'mostly', 'self', 'rather', 'brave', 'acts', 'protagonist', 'overcoming', 'incredible', 'unrealistic', 'odds', 'also', 'predicable', 'endings', 'other', 'Disney', 'films', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty/Little', 'Mermaid', 'ending', 'bit', 'fantasy', 'magic', 'story', 'think', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'really', 'good', 'songs', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'hit', 'song', 'show', 'son', 'sings', 'over', 'again', 'only', '4', 'think', 'two', 'things', 'happened', 'here', 'Disney', 'should', 'seriously', 'consider', 'producing', 'more', 'animated', 'films', 'Use', 'experienced', 'quality', 'writers', 'production', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'instantly', 'transferred', 'stage', 'off', 'Broadway', 'writing', 'was', 'good', 'had', 'unique', 'viewpoints', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'openness', 'improvisation', 'necessary', 'good', 'stage', 'production', 'film', 'also', 'hired', 'quality', 'actor/singers', 'already', 'well', 'established', 'stage', 'productions', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'have', 'quality', 'signing', 'changing', 'artist', 'having', 'already', 'worked', 'Disney', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'also', 'quality', 'stage', 'vocal', 'history', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'Olaf', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'also', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'songs', 'Overall', 'high', 'quality', 'piece', 'work', 'long', 'overdue', 'Disney']",N/A

1674445,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00FZM8Z7I,Darren,"[16, 22]","[This review is written for those who have already seen the film, so proceed with caution]An attempt to &#34;get back to basics&#34;: the inspiration -- no, check that, the nebulous notion -- comes from Hans Christian Andersen, someone from whom Walt Himself certainly drew inspiration.  The particular tale that &#34;Frozen&#34; is supposed to be derived from is Andersen's &#34;Snow Queen&#34;, but aside from a few Swedish names, a journey with a reindeer, and a princess who lives in an ice palace (thoroughly wicked in Andersen's version, by the way), not an attempt is made to actually adapt that rather severe fairy tale.  What we get instead are primarily Two Disney Princesses to market instead of just One, and secondarily another attempt from Walt Disney Animated Studios to justify their &#34;Princess&#34; gold-mine (videos, books, dolls) as some sort of feminist message.Incidentally, there's nothing wrong with princesses.  Nor is there anything wrong with little girls wanting to be princesses and thus identifying with charmed characters like Snow White, Cinderella, and Ariel the Mermaid.  For gods sake let the tykes enjoy the fantasy; they'll find out soon enough that they won't be princesses when they grow up.  One just wishes that the Disney Company would stop apologizing for their contribution to all that, would stop &#34;making up for it' by brow-beating us to death with all the you-go-girl heroics and the ineffectual male characters.  If one of the themes here is female empowerment, how much more charming -- and more useful for today's girls -- to embody that theme in a pair of ordinary young girls without royal pedigree.  Otherwise?  Let Princesses be Princesses without all the hand-wringing about it; let the old tales remain old tales, for they will always delight without our &#34;help&#34; and certainly without our modern sensibilities.  By the way, I'd also recommend that Walt Disney Animated Studios scrounge up a tale for boys -- you're in danger of losing half your market, fellas.The male half of the species -- admittedly, mostly useless -- certainly gets no breaks here.  I enjoyed the working-class Christoph, who laments the destroyed sled that he had just paid off.  He is loyal and steadfast to the Princess Anna whom he carts about the Arctic Circle without any specific hope of personal remuneration; he's good at carrying a torch.  His relationship to Anna is rather like the relationship between himself and his reindeer: selfless devotion to a Master, or Mistress, as the case may be.  But in the end he is denied heroic agency (that's reserved for the girls), and prior to that, he's the subject of a song in which he's cast as a &#34;fixer-upper&#34;.  We have come a long way from Prince Charming, haven't we?  (Or Prince Eric from &#34;Mermaid&#34;, for that matter.)  The poor guy even smells and has fleas.  Well, there IS a Prince here, and he is totally nice, earnest, and rather simple, in the Disney tradition ... until about two-thirds of the way through, when -- after the writers have boxed themselves in with their overly baroque plot -- the mask is dropped to reveal the bloody fangs beneath.  I can't think of a prior Disney movie in which such a bait-and-switch has occurred.  Apart from terrible screenwriting, the sudden conversion of the Prince to Machiavellian villain can only mean the grinding of an ideological axe:  Prince Charmings are definitely OUT.  Got it.  At any rate, the whole business is a most unwelcome new development in the Disneyverse that I hope is not repeated again.  Guys, guys, remember: these movies are for small children.  Let's save the neo-noir motivations for other filmmakers in other genres -- it doesn't work for tykes, who require clear heroes and villains to understand and latch onto.  Walt (remember him?) would definitely NOT approve.  Finally, there's also an amusing gay, or at least fey, little snowman mascot who apparently walked straight off the set of a 1990s Meg Ryan rom-com.  His &#34;Summer&#34; song is probably the funniest thing in the movie.The main heroine of the movie is Princess Anna, who sings about feeling gassy and stuffing chocolates in her face.  One wonders if the writers have watched ANYTHING else besides modern romantic comedies from which to draw inspiration.  If you're reading this, girls (guys?), I recommend the formal classicism of the early movies of Walt Disney himself as a model on which to emulate your next scripts.  Begin by watching &#34;Snow White&#34;, carefully, this time.  Well, whatever.  The prospect of romantic love with a Prince is fun, but (and you can hear that ideological axe sharpening again in the distance) Anna's primary motivation is rekindling her friendship with her older sister, Princess Elsa.  Elsa is part of that relatively new line of &#34;complicated&#34; Disney heroes like Simba, heroes who can't relax because of their burdens.  In Elsa's case, it's the burden of a Midas-like power which turns everything she touches into ice (the power is never explained, btw -- the parents are normal).  Influenced more by Stephen King than Hans Christian Andersen, the writers turn Elsa into a sort of Disney Carrie -- wielder of a terrible power that she's too inexperienced to control.  She becomes the epitome of the ultimate teenage girl: running away to brood by herself, singing a pop song in the terrible modern manner about not minding the cold, anyway.  All of this is interesting, I suppose, to older kids and adults, but I can report that my 3-year-old niece was nonplussed.  She preferred the snowman.The songs are fairly charming, except for that centerpiece tune indicated above, &#34;Let It Go&#34; -- a tuneless whinefest that doesn't even have a good beat.  Walt Disney Animation Studios is still losing to their internecine rivals Pixar, who smartly tend to make movies with fish and motorcars as heroes.  CGI continues to fail when it comes to the human face.  Elsa and Anna have prognathous jaws, bean-like noses, and massive eyes that belong to some blind cave creature rather than on a human face.All in all?  If &#34;Frozen&#34; is supposed to be a return to Disney Greatness, or at least a return to the quality of the Disney &#34;Renaissance&#34; (1989-1999), then either everyone is just wishfully thinking or I'm just a grumpy old man.  Probably both.  2 out of 5.",2,No more Prince Charmings,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,6372,"['[', 'review', 'written', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'proceed', 'caution', ']',

I thought the first 60 minutes was quite simply the best movie I've seen in several years. This was based on a story from Hans Christian Anderson. As many of you know this movie had several starts and stops but the final result was amazing!The story was very unusual in that there was barely a villain as the major theme of the story is redemption of one of the female leads, Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) who has the power to control the cold and snow. Having seen Idina Menzel live she doesn't disappoint here. I find the strength (and the range!) of her vocal abilities stunning, especial considering her relatively small physical size.I did find Olaf the snowman a little irritating but otherwise this was a movie destined to be a classic. I didn't see the evil turn of Hans , a prince from another country there for the crowning of Elsa as queen.And the music was top notch as well.

1674460,A2VN15501IUTND,B00FZM8Z7I,"D. Christensen ""Jesus Freak""","[2, 2]","I'm a movie fan. I love movies. I'm not overly critical unless a movie is just horrible. I pick and choose my genres, (no horror for me) but I love all kinds of movies. Just to give you a sense of scope, some of my favorites are Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, The Avengers, both Thors, both Captain Americas, It's A Wonderful Life, Hoosiers, Rocky IV, and Napoleon Dynamite. I absolutely adore every movie Pixar has ever made. They are legends in their own time. With the exception of Brave, I own every single Pixar movie and watch them regularly. Ever since 1995, when Toy Story was released, I've felt that Disney Animation has sat in the shadow of Pixar. They've tried, but nothing has come out that has caught my eye, with the exception of Tarzan. Honestly, Disney Animation's last &#34;golden era&#34; was from 89-94 which saw Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King, to name a few. '95 ushered in the Pixar era, which has yet to end. Even some of the competitors have bested Disney in recent years (Despicable Me 1 and 2, to be precise).That all ends with Frozen.I saw the teaser for this film last summer when I saw Despicable Me 2 in the theaters. It was the goofy trailer with Olaf the snowman and Sven the reindeer, and I didn't think twice about it. Figured it would be another Disney try-and-fail attempt. When it came out on DVD I heard some stuff about it, but nothing really solid that made me say &#34;Wow, I need to see this.&#34;About a month ago I went to visit a college and over the weekend they had what they called &#34;The Monty's&#34;, basically the Grammy's for students of the college. There were 9 acts, and you could vote for the best, so on and so forth. One of the acts was a duet performing &#34;For The First Time In Forever&#34;. One of the guys I was sitting with told me it was from Frozen. I thought &#34;Huh. That was a good song. Maybe I'll have to watch Frozen.&#34; So for the past few weeks I've been scouring Redboxes to find it but it was always checked out. Finally we found it and I watched it with my family. Here's what I thought.For the first 10-15 minutes it's pretty slow. I did not see what all the hype was about. Yeah, the songs were decent, but the plot seemed to lack structure and direction. After the first 15 minutes or so, it really picked up and I was honestly engaged for the rest of the movie. When I evaluate a movie, I really only look at two things with much intensity, and those are the characters and the plot. Usually a good show by one makes up for rottenness in the other, and the greatest movies have great plots and great characters. By that count, Frozen would be one of the greatest movies. You have four main characters, Anna and Elsa, two girls turned young women who are heirs to the throne of Arendelle. You also have Hans, a prince from the Southern Isles, and Kristoff, a relatively poor loner who sells ice for a living. Each of these characters are pretty well-fleshed out, and they're not these perfect people either. They all have these flaws. Elsa is too hard on herself and others, Kristoff and Anna are both kind of socially awkward, and Hans... Well, you have to watch the movie to find out about Hans. I also like that the characters are dynamic, in other words, they grow as the story progresses. The supporting characters are great too, and ultimately the supporting cast is what makes this such a fun movie. The plot is great, really original as far as I'm concerned. I've never seen a movie with a plot quite this unique. The basic premise is unique, but then on top of that the climax and resolution are total surprises. You never expect the ending to turn out the way it does. The plot twists are numerous, and and this is surprising because usually movies geared toward kids are much simpler. Not the case here.No discussion of this movie would be complete without a word about the music. There are four what I would call main songs: Do You Wanna Build A Snowman, For The First Time In Forever, Love Is An Open Door, and Let It Go. There are some other songs as well, like Fixer Upper, In Summer and Reindeers Are Better Than People. This has finally overturned my reigning champion for best songs in a movie, Rocky IV. These songs are just so good. They get stuck in your head constantly, but they're not annoying. They're real songs. They could be hits on their own. I feel like the songs really overshadow the superb soundtrack by Christophe Beck. His score is a masterpiece, and it really completes the movie.I really hope Disney continues to make animated movies like this. I was thoroughly impressed.It doesn't matter what your age or walk of life, if you like good movies, you'll love Frozen. Highly recommended.",5,"For the first time in forever, a great Disney movie not made by Pixar!",1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,4736,"[""'m"", 'movie', 'fan', 'love', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'critical', 'movie', 'just', 'horrible', 'pick', 'choose', 'genres', 'horror', 'love', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Just', 'give', 'sense', 'scope', 'favorites', 'are', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Hobbit', 'Avengers', 'Thors', 'Captain', 'Americas', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Hoosiers', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'movie', 'Pixar', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'legends', 'own', 'time', 'exception', 'Brave', 'own', 'single', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'watch', 'regularly', 'Ever', '1995', 'when', 'Toy', 'Story', 'was', 'released', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'Disney', 'Animation', 'sat', 'shadow', 'Pixar', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'nothing', 'come', 'out', 'caught', 'eye', 'exception', 'Tarzan', 'Honestly', 'Disney', 'Animation', 'last', '34', 'golden', 'era', '34', 'was', '89-94', 'saw', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Lion', 'King', 'name', 'few', ""'95"", 'ushered', 'Pixar', 'era', 'yet', 'end', 'Even', 'competitors', 'have', 'bested', 'Disney', 'recent', 'years', 'Despicable', 'Me', '1', '2', 'be', 'precise', 'ends', 'Frozen.I', 'saw', 'teaser', 'film', 'last', 'summer', 'when', 'saw', 'Despicable', 'Me', '2', 'theaters', 'was', 'goofy', 'trailer', 'Olaf', 'snowman', 'Sven', 'reindeer', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'Figured', 'would', 'be', 'Disney', 'try-and-fail', 'attempt', 'When', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'heard', 'stuff', 'nothing', 'really', 'solid', 'made', 'say', '34', 'Wow', 'need', 'see', 'this.', '34', 'month', 'went', 'visit', 'college', 'weekend', 'had', 'what', 'called', '34', 'Monty', '34', 'basically', 'Grammy', 'students', 'college', 'were', '9', 'acts', 'could', 'vote', 'best', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'One', 'acts', 'was', 'duet', 'performing', '34', 'First', 'Time', 'Forever', '34', 'One', 'guys', 'was', 'sitting', 'told', 'was', 'Frozen', 'thought', '34', 'Huh', 'was', 'good', 'song', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'Frozen.', '34', 'So', 'past', 'few', 'weeks', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scouring', 'Redboxes', 'find', 'was', 'always', 'checked', 'out', 'Finally', 'found', 'watched', 'family', 'Here', 'what', 'thought.For', 'first', '10-15', 'minutes', 'pretty', 'slow', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'hype', 'was', 'about', 'Yeah', 'songs', 'were', 'decent', 'plot', 'seemed', 'lack', 'structure', 'direction', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'really', 'picked', 'was', 'honestly', 'engaged', 'rest', 'movie', 'When', 'evaluate', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'look', 'two', 'things', 'much', 'intensity', 'are', 'characters', 'plot', 'Usually', 'good', 'show', 'one', 'up', 'rottenness', 'other', 'greatest', 'movies', 'have', 'great', 'plots', 'great', 'characters', 'count', 'Frozen', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'have', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'Anna', 'Elsa', 'two', 'girls', 'turned', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'heirs', 'throne', 'Arendelle', 'also', 'have', 'Hans', 'prince', 'Southern', 'Isles', 'Kristoff', 'relatively', 'poor', 'loner', 'who', 'ice', 'living', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'well-fleshed', ""'re"", 'not', 'perfect', 'people', 'either', 'have', 'flaws', 'Elsa', 'too', 'hard', 'others', 'Kristoff', 'Anna', 'are', 'kind', 'socially', 'awkward', 'Hans', 'Well', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'Hans', 'also', 'characters', 'are', 'dynamic', 'other', 'words', 'grow', 'story', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'ultimately', 'supporting', 'cast', 'what', 'such', 'fun', 'movie', 'plot', 'great', 'really', 'original', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'plot', 'quite', 'unique', 'basic', 'premise', 'unique', 'then', 'top', 'climax', 'resolution', 'are', 'total', 'surprises', 'never', 'expect', 'ending', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'numerous', 'surprising', 'usually', 'movies', 'geared', 'kids', 'are', 'much', 'simpler', 'Not', 'case', 'here.No', 'discussion', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'word', 'music', 'are', 'four', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'main', 'songs', 'Do', 'Wan', 'Build', 'A', 'Snowman', 'First', 'Time', 'Forever', 'Love', 'Open', 'Door', 'Let', 'Go', 'are', 'other', 'songs', 'well', 'Fixer', 'Upper', 'Summer', 'Reindeers', 'Are', 'Better', 'Than', 'People', 'finally', 'overturned', 'reigning', 'champion', 'best', 'songs', 'movie', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'songs', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'good', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'constantly', ""'re"", 'not', 'annoying', ""'re"", 'real', 'songs', 'could', 'be', 'hits', 'own', 'feel', 'songs', 'really', 'overshadow', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'Christophe', 'Beck', 'score', 'masterpiece', 'really', 'movie.I', 'really', 'hope', 'Disney', 'make', 'animated', 'movies', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'impressed.It', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'walk', 'life', 'like', 'good', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Frozen', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1674500,A39FTW448TRUQO,B00FZM8Z7I,DisneyDenizen,"[19, 25]","We have seen this movie in the theaters four times. It is the best Disney Princess movie ever.The movie opens as sisters Elsa and Anna play together as children, Elsa creating ice and snow magic for her younger sister. Tragedy ends their play and changes the girls' lives forever. Their parents' lives end abruptly, and we fast forward to the day of Elsa's coronation. Chaos ensues as Elsa's gift is revealed. She flees into the now-snowy wilderness. Anna vows to save her sister and bring her home.But what jumped off the screen at me was not the story itself but the way Elsa and her gift were treated by everyone. A troll asks, &#34;Born with it or cursed?&#34;--as if her difference could not possibly be a positive thing. Her parents dismiss the staff, separate Elsa from her sister, and teach her to keep to herself and hide her difference. She is taught that she needs to control her powers, but never how to control her gift or even that her gift could be a positive thing.My review cannot begin to do justice to what I am trying to convey. But any Spectrum person who has ever been told to change to fit into a neurotypical world will be able to relate to this film in a way that I have never encountered before. When Elsa leaves people behind and belts out &#34;Let It Go&#34;, it is like she is singing a new Aspie anthem.It is only when Elsa learns that her difference is a gift that she can begin to be around others. And the others! They have learned a lesson, too. That Elsa is not a monster or a witch, that her difference is a positive thing.As an added bonus, all of our favorite leading characters are social misfits. Elsa and Anna have been separated from society, leading Anna to blurt out any number of inappropriate remarks. Her wilderness guide Kristoph has likewise grown up in isolation (except for his family of trolls, themselves hardly typical). And the Snowman Olaf and Kristoph's Reindeer Sven are also offbeat. In fact, the only characters who appear to be neurotypical are the girls' well-meaning but misguided parents, Anna's love interest Hans (spoiler omited), the horrid minister of Wieselton, and the assorted townfolk and servants. It's enough to give neurotypicals a bad name.Take your Aspie to see this movie. You will love the experience.

They show love, friendship and humor in the real and in the not so real world of Frozen. It captures the creative imagination of the children who watch it, not just my granddaughter. In a time of lightning fast internet, the impersonal connections of the social media (ironic in its term), we find families coming together to learn lessons about people...through a cartoon movie.

Disney has been on a roll the last few years giving us The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck it Ralph and now Frozen. Once again Disney blows it up in the animation department and Olaf the snowman is another memorable sidekick.I must admit that when I saw the trailer for this film at least a year or so ago, I thought it looked pretty generic and it didn't interest me at all, but being a collector of Disney animated films I knew I would be purchasing it and hoping for the best.I'm not really into musicals especially live action type, I find most of them very artificial. I guess it's more eerily for me to accept cartoon characters bursting into song for no apparent reason? The songs in Frozen are really good and they fit the situations well and I can't remember a musical I enjoyed more since Fiddler on the Roof. Yes, it's that good!The Blu Ray looks flawless, but imagine my disappointent when I viewed the bonus feature entitled ""The Making of Frozen"" only to find a 3 minute song explaining ""they don't know?""..

1674537,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00FZM8Z7I,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","What do just about all the Hayao Miyazaki films and most of the Pixar films have in common? They are better than Frozen. I&#8217;ve heard it said that Frozen is the best animated film from Disney since Lion King. I would argue that it&#8217;s not even as good as the previous Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph. I would defend Pixar&#8217;s 2012 animated film Brave as the superior movie.  Frozen is now the highest grossing animated film of all time and eighth highest grossing film of any genre. My first inkling that Frozen may not be all that was when I watched the video for &#8216;Let It Go&#8217; and found it completely underwhelming. The music overall just didn&#8217;t compare to the songs being produced during the Disney renaissance of the late 80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s. The MAIN problem however is in the writing and I&#8217;ll list out my issues.1. Elsa&#8217;s ice powers are never explained or defined. She is capable of effortlessly creating an enormous elaborate ice castle and freezing huge bodies of water in seconds, she is immune to cold, she can create autonomous sentient servants at will or in one case accidently and she is able to drastically alter weather patterns for an indeterminate radius. As if that were not enough she is able to radically alter her clothing which seems to be a non-ice based power unless her new clothes are some kind of malleable ice and her body temperature is below freezing. I originally thought of Elsa as a female version of Frozone from The Incredibles but she&#8217;s actually more like Dr. Manhattan from The Watchmen and apparently all of this vast power was kept in check by a pair of ladies gloves. I know people will counter with &#8216;It&#8217;s a MOVIE, relax&#8217; and there are movies where mystery is a plus and over explaining can hurt the flow but this really is a movie that needs some kind explanation. I don&#8217;t get the impression that the lack of background was a stylistic choice. I get the impression the writers just didn&#8217;t feel like bothering.2. Somehow Elsa is able to create massive, intricate ice objects and intelligent ice creatures and yet when she inexplicably changes the weather around her kingdom she has no ability to remove it. How can she be so commanding of her powers in some respects and so unable to control them in others? If her lady gloves were able to restrain her powers for years why not just put them back on? The main source of problem is that Elsa has created winter in the kingdom. If Elsa truly cannot stop the winter why doesn&#8217;t she just stroll further away? How far does her sphere of winter extend?3. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Most of Elsa&#8217;s life is spent trying to protect her younger sister from harm even though it causes years of separation between the two. Right after Elsa makes a speech to Anna about how she can&#8217;t come back because she may harm her she does a sweep with her hand and nails Anna right in the heart with ice. For all Elsa&#8217;s talk she is incredibly careless. As if that weren&#8217;t enough Elsa creates a massive ice beast that seems intent on killing Anna. If you&#8217;re trying to protect your sister sending a murderous monster after her is probably not the best course of action.4. Late in the film the villain of the story decides to reveal himself and proceeds to lay out his entire dastardly plan. If he had just kept his fool mouth shut he would have been successful but instead he has to pontificate for no good reason and blow his plan.The problems listed above all stem from lazy writing. Diligent writing fills in the gaps and explains what&#8217;s going on. Lazy writing just has things happen. The film takes no risks and has a trite paint by numbers ending. For all the talk about Anna being a new kind of Disney princess I preferred Merida from Brave as a much more believable, well rounded character. This is in no way a BAD movie; in fact the scene where Elsa&#8217;s powers are revealed and she runs off was brilliantly done. My issue is that there are so many better animated films out there and if people are falling over themselves over Frozen they really need to watch some of the other animated films available.",4,Good Animated Film But Far From the Best,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,4199,"['What', 'do', 'just', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'most', 'Pixar', 'films', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'better', 'Frozen', '8217', 've', 'heard', 'said', 'Frozen', 'best', 'animated', 'film', 'Disney', 'Lion', 'King', 'would', 'argue', '8217', 'not', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'Disney', 'film', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'would', 'defend', 'Pixar', '8217', 's', '2012', 'animated', 'film', 'Brave', 'superior', 'movie', 'Frozen', 'now', 'highest', 'grossing', 'animated', 'film', 'time', 'eighth', 'highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'genre', 'first', 'inkling', 'Frozen', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'was', 'when', 'watched', 'video', '8216', 'Let', 'Go', '8217', 'found', 'completely', 'underwhelming', 'music', 'overall', 'just', 'didn', '8217', 'compare', 'songs', 'being', 'produced', 'Disney', 'renaissance', 'late', '80', '8217', 's', 'early', '90', '8217', 's.', 'MAIN', 'problem', 'however', 'writing', '8217', 'list', 'issues.1', 'Elsa', '8217', 's', 'ice', 'powers', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'defined', 'capable', 'effortlessly', 'creating', 'enormous', 'elaborate', 'ice', 'castle', 'freezing', 'huge', 'bodies', 'water', 'seconds', 'immune', 'cold', 'can', 'create', 'autonomous', 'sentient', 'servants', 'will', 'one', 'case', 'accidently', 'able', 'drastically', 'alter', 'weather', 'patterns', 'indeterminate', 'radius', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'able', 'radically', 'alter', 'clothing', 'be', 'non-ice', 'based', 'power', 'new', 'clothes', 'are', 'kind', 'malleable', 'ice', 'body', 'temperature', 'freezing', 'originally', 'thought', 'Elsa', 'female', 'version', 'Frozone', 'Incredibles', '8217', 'actually', 'more', 'Dr.', 'Manhattan', 'Watchmen', 'apparently', 'vast', 'power', 'was', 'kept', 'check', 'pair', 'ladies', 'gloves', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'counter', '8216', '8217', 's', 'MOVIE', 'relax', '8217', 'are', 'movies', 'where', 'mystery', 'plus', 'explaining', 'can', 'hurt', 'flow', 'really', 'movie', 'kind', 'explanation', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'impression', 'lack', 'background', 'was', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'get', 'impression', 'writers', 'just', 'didn', '8217', 'feel', 'bothering.2', 'Somehow', 'Elsa', 'able', 'create', 'massive', 'intricate', 'ice', 'objects', 'intelligent', 'ice', 'creatures', 'yet', 'when', 'inexplicably', 'weather', 'kingdom', 'ability', 'remove', 'How', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'commanding', 'powers', 'respects', 'so', 'unable', 'control', 'others', 'lady', 'gloves', 'were', 'able', 'restrain', 'powers', 'years', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'put', 'back', 'main', 'source', 'problem', 'Elsa', 'created', 'winter', 'kingdom', 'Elsa', 'truly', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'winter', 'why', 'doesn', '8217', 'just', 'stroll', 'further', 'away', 'How', 'far', 'sphere', 'winter', 'extend', '3', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***', 'Most', 'Elsa', '8217', 's', 'life', 'spent', 'trying', 'protect', 'younger', 'sister', 'harm', 'even', 'years', 'separation', 'two', 'Right', 'Elsa', 'speech', 'Anna', 'how', 'can', '8217', 'come', 'back', 'may', 'harm', 'sweep', 'hand', 'nails', 'Anna', 'right', 'heart', 'ice', 'Elsa', '8217', 'talk', 'incredibly', 'careless', 'weren', '8217', 'enough', 'Elsa', 'massive', 'ice', 'beast', 'intent', 'killing', 'Anna', '8217', 're', 'trying', 'protect', 'sister', 'sending', 'murderous', 'monster', 'probably', 'not', 'best', 'course', 'action.4', 'Late', 'film', 'villain', 'story', 'reveal', 'proceeds', 'lay', 'out', 'entire', 'dastardly', 'plan', 'had', 'just', 'kept', 'fool', 'mouth', 'shut', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'instead', 'pontificate', 'good', 'reason', 'blow', 'plan.The', 'problems', 'listed', 'stem', 'lazy', 'writing', 'Diligent', 'writing', 'fills', 'gaps', 'what', '8217', 'going', 'Lazy', 'writing', 'just', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'risks', 'trite', 'paint', 'numbers', 'ending', 'talk', 'Anna', 'being', 'new', 'kind', 'Disney', 'princess', 'preferred', 'Merida', 'Brave', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'well', 'rounded', 'character', 'way', 'BAD', 'movie', 'fact', 'scene', 'where', 'Elsa', '8217', 's', 'powers', 'are', 'revealed', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'issue', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'better', 'animated', 'films', 'there', 'people', 'are', 'falling', 'over', 'over', 'Frozen', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'available']",N/A

1674549,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B00FZM8Z7I,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[63, 82]","During the entirety of &#34;Frozen,&#34; I was in thrall at what was occurring on the screen in front of me. Honestly, it was kind of hard to tell what was hitting me, as I cheered, cried, and almost stood up clapping for the characters on screen. By the time the credits were rolling, and the hairs on my arms were still standing up, I still wasn't sure what to think. So I walked out of the theater, then bought another ticket to the next showtime. Walking home as the sunset after the second screening, it became clear to me. &#34;Frozen&#34; is the best thing Disney has put out in well over a decade, and will probably go down in cinema history as one of the greatest artistic achievements in animation. Oh, yes, and it's a darn fine film in its own right, for adults and children alike.A very loose retelling of &#34;The Snow Queen&#34; that Walt Disney himself had been planning since the 1940's, &#34;Frozen&#34; tells a tale of two sisters, Anna and Elsa. From a very young age, they were inseparable and played together all the time. But when Elsa's control over the element of ice threatens her sister's life, her father puts her powers under control, and erases Anna's memories of her sister ever being anything but normal. Years go by, and a rift occurs between the siblings, which comes to a head on the day of Elsa's coronation as queen. Anna angers her sister into fleeing and releasing an eternal winter for their oceanic trading town, as well as the entire land. To undo the damage, she must find Elsa and reason with her, lest the livelihood of thousands be threatened. With the help of the travelling ice merchant Kristoph (and his silly reindeer Sven) and the lively snowman Olaf, she goes up against seemingly insurmountable odds to save the day.That's about the most basic description I can give of the film without giving away too much. Which is a wonderful thing to say, because for the first time in far too long, Disney has created a movie that is almost entirely unpredictable, and incredibly subversive in terms of what we expect from them. Startling new revelations occur at a very rapid rate, especially during the film's masterful climax, which completely floored me due its unwillingness to fall into trite, cliche territory. The admittedly great &#34;Tangled&#34; looks like small potatoes compared to how fantastic this movie in terms of its powerful and surprising narrative, and Jennifer Lee should be commended for her masterful screenplay (as well as her direction alongside Chris Buck.)What really makes this a special film, as mentioned above, is how it's unlike anything Disney normally puts out. Routinely, the movie takes out trite tropes and plot devices from their usual stock, dangles them in front of our faces to the point of approaching parody, then coyly smashes them to pieces right before our very eyes and does something entirely new. While I can't really give examples without spoiling the movie, I can assure you that this isn't the typical Disney experience, and it feels like the aging studio has turned a new page, much like it did in the 80's with the release of &#34;The Little Mermaid,&#34; ironically another Hans Christian Anderson piece.Speaking of &#34;The Little Mermaid,&#34; this is another tale with incredibly strong female leads in Anna and Elsa. Anna will stop at nothing to simple establish better bonds with her sister, and Elsa's struggle to contain her power and be herself can be paralleled to the struggles faced by young women growing up in modern society. Their rich characterizations reinforce the idea that girls don't need to grow up looking for a prince in shining armor, and instead, can be strong and independent by their own merits. The same can be said for the character of Kristoph, who teaches the idea of chivalry versus sheltering, teamwork versus saving the damsel in distress. For children, &#34;Frozen&#34; carries some fantastic messages that parents are sure to appreciate, and are much different from other kids' movies today.On top of the great writing and rich characterizations, the visuals on display are simply majestic. The characters are deeply expressive and creatively designed, with crisply animated flowing hair and endearingly exaggerated physical attributes. Set pieces are a wonder to behold, from Elsa's beautiful ice castle to the mysterious frozen tundras trekked across by Elsa and Kristoph. Everything in this film is pure eye candy of the highest caliber, and easily one of the best works of CG animation to come out of the field for quite some time. Years down the line, this will most likely still be captivating to look at.The same can be said for the voice work and music, as both are top-notch. Every character is perfectly cast, and while it's really difficult to pick favorites, I must say that Idina Menzel's mysterious and sultry voice as Elsa is enchanting to the ears, and her soulful singing voice during both her solo bits and duets make me suspect there might be an Oscar for Best Original Song in her future. All of the singing complements Christophe Beck's truly awesome score, which includes some of the best songs in all of Disney history, including the tear-jerking anthem to freedom &#34;Let It Go,&#34; heart-wrenching ballad of sororal love &#34;Do You Want To Build A Snowman?,&#34; and the peppy uptempo piece &#34;In Summer.&#34; Great music and a talented cast round out the film into a complete, wonderful package.It's no secret that Disney's been in a bit of a bind lately, what with uninspired sequels and tired standalone films with worn-out premises. But &#34;Tangled&#34; was a step in the right direction, and now, &#34;Frozen&#34; is an unabashed dash ahead in that very same direction. Make no mistake, this is not just a great work of animation, or a well-done Disney film. It is a truly superb and divine cinematic experience, the likes of which only comes along a few times every decade or so, if we're lucky. Regardless of your age, or whether you like these types of movies or not, this is something you must experience. If you like movies, or more basically, if you like feeling happy, watch this film without delay.&#34;Frozen&#34; is an artistic achievement beyond comprehension, and perhaps a sign that we are on the precipice of Disney's second renaissance.Grade: A+ (Superb)",5,Ironically Heartwarming Masterpiece,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,6339,"['entirety', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'was', 'thrall', 'what',

1674562,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00FZM8Z7I,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[2, 5]","There was a time in the early to mid-1990s when Disney started making animated movies without musical numbers. I can't tell you how relieved I was. I'm not a big fan of musicals at all. Do I like a lot of the classic films the Mouse House released early on? Of course I do. However, that's not to say I don't take a restroom break or frantically search for the remote to fast-forward through the songs in movies like &#34;The Jungle Book,&#34; &#34;Cinderella,&#34; and &#34;Sleeping Beauty.&#34;Parents who share my aversion to musicals can now look forward to suffering through even worse tunes geared towards the pop-infected ears of tween and teens everywhere thanks to &#34;Frozen.&#34; Before I go into my personal tirade against &#34;Frozen,&#34; let me state something very clearly. Children and musical-loving adults will adore the film. Besides its new style of animation, this is a classic Disney outing through and through. There's a princess, a prince, an inanimate object that talks, the dumb peasant who deserves love, and a kingdom in the grips of fear and trouble.Without going into any spoilers, I will say that I was impressed with one plot twist that set &#34;Frozen&#34; aside from other Disney movies. Since I'm reflecting on the good found, I'll also mention that the snowman Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad delivering his best impersonation of Jonah Hill I've ever heard) provided just enough comic relief to keep me on the inner edge of sanity.Let's take a moment to reflect on the incredibly annoying theme song &#34;Let It Go.&#34; Where we once would get operatic and symphonic numbers, we're now cursed to slosh through a whiny pop track tailor-made to be played to death on top 40 radio stations for eternity. Entertainment Weekly's Marc Snetiker described the song as &#34;an incredible anthem of liberation.&#34; Liberation from what? Being a cartoon character that freezes stuff with her hands? Just keep the gloves on and get over it!I don't find it necessary to go into much detail about the audio and video quality of &#34;Frozen.&#34; Both are perfect and look and sound phenomenal. The picture is clean and dynamic and the 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio delivers all the musical numbers and sound effects wonderfully.For those who enjoy &#34;Frozen,&#34; there are plenty of extras for you to take in. Two featurettes include &#34;The Making of 'Frozen'&#34; and &#34;D'frosted: Disney's Journey from Hans Christian Anderson to 'Frozen.'&#34; We also get deleted scenes and a Mickey Mouse short entitled &#34;Get a Horse!&#34; There are four (yes, four) different versions of &#34;Let It Go&#34; to suffer through as it is sang in English, Spanish, Italian, and Malaysian. They couldn't find anyone to sing it in French, Japanese, or Chinese?If you have kids who enjoyed &#34;Tangled&#34; and &#34;Brave,&#34; then &#34;Frozen&#34; will give them something else to watch. Parents who loved those films will embrace this one as well.

1674574,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00FZM8Z7I,FNDNreview,"[577, 682]","It's unrealistic to watch animated movies these days and be able to call one better than all the rest - and that goes for Disney movies, too.  True enough, each year one animated feature eventually goes on to win an Academy Award, along with several other awards, but for the most part, even the year's most praised film looks just like the last.  Only a select few films in the last decade, like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo will withstand the test of time and possibly earn a place in the same conversation as Disney classics, like Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.  Still, every now and then, Disney treats animated movie lovers to something special, and to be completely honest, it's been quite a while.  This might be a bit premature to say, but Disney has finally struck gold once more (and not just commercially) with a film that has the potential to be one of the greatest animated films every created.  That film is called Frozen.Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee write (along with Shane Morris) and direct Disney's Frozen, loosely based on The Snow Queen - a story created by Hans Christian Anderson.  The film begins with the introduction of two young children, both princesses - Elsa and Anna.  However, Elsa has the power to control the winter elements, ice and snow.  After a terrible accident, the girls' parents decide to isolate Elsa from Anna and wipe Anna's mind clean about Elsa's powers in order to protect Anna from knowing the truth.Flash forward several years, the day has come for Elsa (Idina Menzel) to claim her right as the Queen of Arendelle.  Now an adult and Queen, Elsa must face the people of her kingdom, all of whom she has hidden herself away since she is unable to control her powers.  Unfortunately, her greatest fear comes true after an encounter with Anna (Kristen Bell), who spontaneously decides she wants to marry a visiting prince, Hans (Santino Fontana).  Unwilling to give her blessing for the marriage and angry with her sister, Elsa unintentionally unleashes her powers on the entire kingdom, instantly turning winter to summer.  Elsa quickly leaves the kingdom and rushes to the mountains, creating her own palace of ice away from anyone and everyone.  Feeling responsible, Anna embarks on a quest, along with a mountain-based ice maker, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his reindeer, Sven, and a magical snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), to bring the Queen home.For whatever reason, Disney moved away from the on-screen musicals that provided some of the most memorable soundtracks in film history.  You may recall A Whole New World from Aladdin and Circle of Life from The Lion King as being just the tip of the iceberg in a massive library of memorable songs over a variety of films.  In all likelihood, Disney simply got sidetracked with spectacular new animation and the realization that 3D implementation had endless potential (which is hardly the case).  Regardless, the diehard lovers of Disney classics will be happy that the company has decided to revisit the musical aspect of storytelling.  Both Kristin Bell and Idina Menzel simply thrive with their heartfelt, energetic voices, and even though there's very little about the songs in Frozen that stand out, the hope is that Disney will continue with this classic trend.The music, meshed with the story, easily makes Frozen one of the most unique animated features in recent memory.  Just when you think you have this story figured out it will absolutely surprise you with its misdirection.  Initially, Frozen appears to be a film that will pit sister vs. sister, sort of like a Good Witch of the North vs. the Wicked Witch of the West dynamic.  However, that couldn't be further from the truth as there is a serious amount of character inner turmoil and theme-driven action going on here instead.  One princess is desperate to protect the world from her own actions, even though she becomes exactly what she hoped to avoid.  The other princess is more traditional with her intent to find true love and save her sister, plus the kingdom (and her sister) - both of which she loves to no end.Like the story itself, the characters are also much different than anything you'd expect out of a film of this nature.  Every little girl on this planet will fall in love with Anna, the happiest princess you could possibly ever imagine.  Kristin Bell is a splendid choice for this role, bringing an enthusiasm to a character that you can't help but adore.  She breaks out into song early and often, singing songs including Do You Want to Build a Snowman? and Love is an Open Door.  Even Menzel, who is portraying a bit of a tragic character, sings with reassurance in songs that include Let It Go and For the First Time in Forever.The most outstanding premise in this film is the fact that there is no major antagonist.  While that is a bit surprising for an animated film, the story goes in a much more thematic direction.  Queen Elsa is the closest thing to a villain in this story, but she doesn't mean to be.  Her goal is to protect the people she cares about, but fails miserably.  As the story progresses, it becomes more about redeeming an individual that has simply lost her way and needs help to find the path back to ""the light.""  To help the Queen, there are a few odd characters that shine in their own unique manner, including a comical snowman, and a moose that loves his carrots.  Even though the film progresses in a mostly serious tone, these two supporting characters won't fail to make you laugh.Overall, there's very little not to like about Frozen.  It contains an honest-to-goodness message that parents should feel free subjecting their children to.  The film is far lighter on the animated violence that has been much more prominent in many films recently.  And, the action sequences that do occur are either playful or of the supernatural variety.  For young boys, the constant presence of princesses may be a bit tedious, but the girls will absolutely love them.  Anna and Elsa might just be in line for the massive commercial success of Ariel and Tinker Bell.  In any event, Disney has a monster hit on their hands that will easily thrive on all formats (theater, home video, etc.) for years and years to come.GRADE:  AFNDNreview.com",5,Disney's 'Frozen' the

1674579,A1VG5XBZZA853N,B00FZM8Z7I,"Frank F ""stravo""","[2, 3]","This Disney movie captures the depth of the love between sisters like few other animated films I have seen in recent memory.  It portrays the deep concern, playful competitveness and driving desire to help and protect your sibling that perfectly demonstrates the bond between siblings, particularly sisters that is at the heart of this movie.  As a father of two girls, I am always on the lookout for entertainment that helps reinforce the importance and uniqueness of this kind of relationship. Frozen wonderfully accomplishes this goal through creative storytelling.  It reminds me very much of Lion King, which for me is the Disney gold standard I hold their films to.  In Lion King you had a movie that majestically covered the relationship between father and son in a way that no other animated movie could match.  Too often animated films focus on the bond between mother and daughter, or daughter and father, but rarely has Disney done father and son and when they did it with Lion King it was amazing.The same can now be said about Frozen and the way it portrays sisterly love.  It is tragic in the beginning to see how the relationship is set up and the deep divide between sisters and how that grows into something magical and beautiful with true love lauded not with a prince or male act of love but the love between two sisters and the lengths they will go through for each other.Again, as a father of two girls, I have grown uneasy with the way many of these movies focus so much on the prince saving the day and the princess waiting for her prince charming to validate her journey.  Here, the prince is not what he seems and the man does not save the day.  It is the kind of story telling I desire to see more of.  Strong female characters should be able to save themselves and in fact, should be able to save the prince.You can safely  ignore all the lofty overarching themes of sisterly love and female empowerment and focus on a good story for you and your family.  it has amazing music and songs - &#34;Let it go&#34; is sung in my household on a daily basis.  It is serious but wholesome story telling and is entertaining for all ages.  Disney really knocked it out of the park with this one.  Don't hesistate to get this for your family.  I assure you, it will be on regular rotation on your DVD/Bluray player for a long time to come.",5,Sisterly Love and No Prince Charming to the rescue,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,2354,"['Disney', 'movie', 'depth', 'love', 'sisters', 'few', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'memory', 'deep', 'concern', 'playful', 'competitveness', 'driving', 'desire', 'help', 'protect', 'sibling', 'perfectly', 'bond', 'siblings', 'particularly', 'sisters', 'heart', 'movie', 'father', 'two', 'girls', 'am', 'always', 'lookout', 'entertainment', 'reinforce', 'importance', 'uniqueness', 'kind', 'relationship', 'Frozen', 'wonderfully', 'goal', 'creative', 'storytelling', 'very', 'much', 'Lion', 'King', 'Disney', 'gold', 'standard', 'hold', 'films', 'Lion', 'King', 'had', 'movie', 'majestically', 'covered', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'way', 'other', 'animated', 'movie', 'could', 'match', 'Too', 'often', 'animated', 'films', 'focus', 'bond', 'mother', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'father', 'rarely', 'Disney', 'done', 'father', 'son', 'when', 'did', 'Lion', 'King', 'was', 'amazing.The', 'same', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'said', 'Frozen', 'way', 'sisterly', 'love', 'tragic', 'beginning', 'see', 'how', 'relationship', 'set', 'up', 'deep', 'divide', 'sisters', 'how', 'something', 'magical', 'beautiful', 'true', 'love', 'lauded', 'not', 'prince', 'male', 'act', 'love', 'love', 'two', 'sisters', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'other.Again', 'father', 'two', 'girls', 'have', 'grown', 'uneasy', 'way', 'many', 'movies', 'focus', 'so', 'much', 'prince', 'saving', 'day', 'princess', 'waiting', 'prince', 'charming', 'validate', 'journey', 'Here', 'prince', 'not', 'what', 'man', 'not', 'save', 'day', 'kind', 'story', 'telling', 'desire', 'see', 'more', 'Strong', 'female', 'characters', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'fact', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'prince.You', 'can', 'safely', 'ignore', 'lofty', 'overarching', 'themes', 'sisterly', 'love', 'female', 'empowerment', 'focus', 'good', 'story', 'family', 'amazing', 'music', 'songs', '34', 'Let', 'go', '34', 'sung', 'household', 'daily', 'basis', 'serious', 'wholesome', 'story', 'telling', 'entertaining', 'ages', 'Disney', 'really', 'knocked', 'park', 'one', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hesistate', 'get', 'family', 'assure', 'will', 'be', 'regular', 'rotation', 'DVD/Bluray', 'player', 'long', 'time', 'come']",N/A

1674597,ACY9QYNDFLVBI,B00FZM8Z7I,G. Farnsworth,"[0, 1]","I enjoyed this movie but it definitely doesn't live up to my expectations.  Since buying Pixar, Disney is kind of getting the idea again that if they make good movies, they will make more money.  Good for them.  In particular, Tangled is one of Disney's best movies in almost every respect.  Wonderful dialog, music, etc.  I was hoping (and people led me to believe) that this would follow in the same tradition.Unfortunately Frozen is dominated in every respect by Tangled.  But it's still an ok movie.  Instead of being a musical movie (plot that makes sense and several very memorable songs) it's much more like a broadway musical (plot that is garbage and lots of music woven in, none of which is really all that catchy).  The plot in this one is pretty thin and it would be easy to poke holes in it.  That's not the worst flaw in the world since it's pretty common in movies, especially those that intend to have children as a major part of the audience.My biggest beef with this movie is the characterization.  There isn't much.  You don't really empathize much with any of the characters and there isn't a ton of growth and development.  There's the handsome guy that turns out to be a bad guy, but he really isn't much of an antagonist and is only present in a few scenes.  Also he had no reason to be as bad as he was.  Really the only reason for his character to exist is that they needed some conflict so the one girl can show an unselfish loving act.  But there were other characters and situations that could have filled that role.  Instead I think Disney was just trying to teach the message that you shouldn't get married on a whim.  I guess it's not the worst message.  The &#34;main&#34; character who has the ice powers isn't that great a character.  She doesn't have that many redeeming qualities and besides learning to control her power she doesn't  grow much in the film.  The sled guy, this reindeer, and the snowman are all ok for comic relief, but they weren't developed very well either, I thought.  Pretty flat.People have made a big deal about the pro-homosexual undercurrent of the movie.  I think that mainly has to do with our political environment today, not the movie.  It's really subtle.  Mostly there's a strong sense in the movie that going off and doing your own thing regardless of whether it makes other people happy is the way to personal progress.  Not the best moral in the world, but it's passable (better than, say, Pocahontas, where the moral is that white men are evil but if they could just learn to be indians we would all be better off).  People have talked about this being a good sisterly love movie but it's actually pretty weak that way.  The sisters hardly know each other.  The one sister is always trying to be loyal but the ice sister is pretty much a jerk or a drama queen all the way through and never changes.  I wouldn't recommend it on those grounds.The music in this movie is what I would call passable.  If you liked the music in wicked, you will like this.  What you get is a few moments within songs that are great, but not whole songs that you will remember or find yourself singing later.  That was a big disappointment.  Simply put, the Andersen-Lopez team is no Alan Menken.  Not by a very long shot.  Nevertheless if you don't try and compare the music to the greater Disney works of the past, you will find that it is painless and even enjoyable.One major bone for me: the voice acting and singing of the ice princess.  Idina Menzel is famous for her role in Wicked and other things and the movie really wanted to capitalize on that, but her voice is clearly too old for the character she plays.  I find it difficult to watch movies where the character's voice clearly doesn't match her look and age.  I'm not the biggest Idina Menzel fan anyway, but if she had played a character that was 20 years older and more mature I wouldn't have had an issue with it.  On the other hand, Kristen Bell, who played the other sister, was brilliant at acting and singing.Overall I felt like the movie meandered.  It kind of seemed like it was heading to a coherent plot but then the big climax, which was a disappointing but also expected deux ex machina, comes and I sort of walked away feeling like it was an ok ride.I don't regret owning this.  If you haven't seen it already, go in with low expectations and you will end up happy.",4,Good movie but doesn't live up to the hype,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,4394,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'buying', 'Pixar', 'Disney', 'kind', 'getting', 'idea', 'again', 'make', 'good', 'movies', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'Good', 'particular', 'Tangled', 'one', 'Disney', 'best', 'movies', 'almost', 'respect', 'Wonderful', 'dialog', 'music', 'etc', 'was', 'hoping', 'people', 'led', 'believe', 'would', 'follow', 'same', 'tradition.Unfortunately', 'Frozen', 'dominated', 'respect', 'Tangled', 'still', 'ok', 'movie', 'Instead', 'being', 'musical', 'movie', 'plot', 'sense', 'several', 'very', 'memorable', 'songs', 'much', 'more', 'broadway', 'musical', 'plot', 'garbage', 'lots', 'music', 'woven', 'none', 'really', 'catchy', 'plot', 'one', 'pretty', 'thin', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'poke', 'holes', 'not', 'worst', 'flaw', 'world', 'pretty', 'common', 'movies', 'especially', 'intend', 'have', 'children', 'major', 'part', 'audience.My', 'biggest', 'beef', 'movie', 'characterization', ""n't"", 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'empathize', 'much', 'characters', ""n't"", 'ton', 'growth', 'development', 'handsome', 'guy', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'antagonist', 'only', 'present', 'few', 'scenes', 'Also', 'had', 'reason', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'Really', 'only', 'reason', 'character', 'exist', 'needed', 'conflict', 'one', 'girl', 'can', 'show', 'unselfish', 'loving', 'act', 'were', 'other', 'characters', 'situations', 'could', 'have', 'filled', 'role', 'Instead', 'think', 'Disney', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'teach', 'message', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'married', 'whim', 'guess', 'not', 'worst', 'message', '34', 'main', '34', 'character', 'who', 'ice', 'powers', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'character', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'besides', 'learning', 'control', 'power', ""n't"", 'grow', 'much', 'film', 'sled', 'guy', 'reindeer', 'snowman', 'are', 'ok', 'comic', 'relief', 'were', ""n't"", 'developed', 'very', 'well', 'either', 'thought', 'Pretty', 'flat.People', 'have', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'pro-homosexual', 'undercurrent', 'movie', 'think', 'mainly', 'do', 'political', 'environment', 'today', 'not', 'movie', 'really', 'subtle', 'Mostly', 'strong', 'sense', 'movie', 'going', 'off', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'regardless', 'other', 'people', 'happy', 'way', 'personal', 'progress', 'Not', 'best', 'moral', 'world', 'passable', 'better', 'say', 'Pocahontas', 'where', 'moral', 'white', 'men', 'are', 'evil', 'could', 'just', 'learn', 'be', 'indians', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'People', 'have', 'talked', 'being', 'good', 'sisterly', 'love', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'weak', 'way', 'sisters', 'hardly', 'know', 'other', 'one', 'sister', 'always', 'trying', 'be', 'loyal', 'ice', 'sister', 'pretty', 'much', 'jerk', 'drama', 'queen', 'way', 'never', 'changes', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'grounds.The', 'music', 'movie', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'passable', 'liked', 'music', 'wicked', 'will', 'like', 'What', 'get', 'few', 'moments', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'not', 'whole', 'songs', 'will', 'remember', 'find', 'singing', 'later', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'Simply', 'put', 'Andersen-Lopez', 'team', 'Alan', 'Menken', 'Not', 'very', 'long', 'shot', 'Nevertheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'compare', 'music', 'greater', 'Disney', 'works', 'past', 'will', 'find', 'painless', 'even', 'enjoyable.One', 'major', 'bone', 'voice', 'acting', 'singing', 'ice', 'princess', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'famous', 'role', 'Wicked', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'really', 'wanted', 'capitalize', 'voice', 'clearly', 'too', 'old', 'character', 'find', 'difficult', 'watch', 'movies', 'where', 'character', 'voice', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'match', 'look', 'age', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'fan', 'anyway', 'had', 'played', 'character', 'was', '20', 'years', 'older', 'more', 'mature', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'issue', 'other', 'hand', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'who', 'played', 'other', 'sister', 'was', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'singing.Overall', 'felt', 'movie', 'meandered', 'kind', 'seemed', 'was', 'heading', 'coherent', 'plot', 'then', 'big', 'climax', 'was', 'disappointing', 'also', 'expected', 'deux', 'ex', 'machina', 'sort', 'walked', 'away', 'feeling', 'was', 'ok', 'ride.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'owning', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'already', 'go', 'low', 'expectations', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'happy']",N/A

So when I saw it was coming out on DVD, I had my mom buy it for me.  I'd heard that it was an excellent movie so my expectations were high.  And let me tell you, I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  This movie was everything I expected and much more!  One of the things I really like about this movie is that it seems to have a maturity that other Disney films don't have and the other thing I like are the characters.  They're all great.  Elsa (Idina Menzel), Anna (Kristen Bell) Olaf (Josh Glad), and the others.  Olaf steals the show in my opinion.  In terms of its maturity, Frozen has a new take on the ""prince charming""  character, Hans.  Hans is a prince and he is charming, but he's no knight in shining armor.  In Fact, he's everything a Disney prince shouldn't be.  He uses and manipulates Anna so he can become king of Arendelle.  I like the way Disney did Hans' character because all other Disney princes have looked good on the outside and have been good on the inside.  But Hans is the opposite.  He looks good on the outside but he's rotten-to-the core on the inside.  I don't think Disney has ever done that before.  So, way to go Disney!!  I think its great that Disney took this approach to the character of Hans because girls need to realize that there are men just like Hans in the world.  Men who appear to be prince charming.  They say all the right things, they're likable, they're engaging but in reality, they're anything but.

When Disney is true to itself, making the kind of movies that have been the hallmark of the studio for over 70 years, it's &#34;magic&#34; the thing, not &#34;magic&#34; the word.At first glance, Frozen doesn't seem to break any new ground for the genre. It's great storytelling, a marvelous score, spectacular visuals -- everything one expects from classic Disney. But its overwhelming success suggests that it is more of a landmark than it may seem.They listened to their audience. Not through data, research and focus groups, but in everyday life. This movie has true insight into where young and old really are in this day and age. Possible more than most live-action movies, Frozen taps into commitment, loyalty, frustration, self-sacrifice and the many forms of love. It's not all about me-me-me -- ultimately it's about we-we-we. You just don't see this much in today's entertainment, which leans toward the you-deserve-a-break-today message.To me, the best thing about Frozen is the music -- the songs and the background score (which tends to be overshadowed by the great songs). This means that family musicals may have life again and perhaps survive a little longer than in the past. Disney's life blood is animation, but its soul is music.And the songwriting innovation that the Lopezes brought with them from the stage (as well as their fine work on Winnie the Pooh and Finding Nemo-The Musical) is the &#34;revue&#34; song. There have been many humorous Disney songs, but never with this precise kind of verbal interplay. Yet their work is extremely reverential to the Disney musical canon and the great talents that created all those songs.The bonus features are nice, but there will probably be more on the inevitable &#34;Crystal Edition&#34; or some such reissue, since Frozen has shattered home entertainment records the way it did at the box office and in Billboard.You let it go, girl!BLU-RAY BONUS FEATURES&#8226; Original Theatrical Short - Get a Horse&#8226; The Making of Frozen (3:18)&#8226; D-Frosted: Disney's Journey from Hans Christian Andersento Frozen (7:28&#8226; Deleted Scenes (with optional intros from directors)Never Underestimate the Power of ElsaThe Dressing RoomMeet Kristoff #1Meet Kristoff #2&#8226; &#34;Let it Go&#34; Music Videos&#8226; Original Teaser TrailerDVD BONUS FEATURESOriginal Theatrical Short - Get a Horse&#34;Let it Go&#34; Music Videos",5,Why has this become such a phenomenon?,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,2486,"['fans', 'Disney', 'musicals', ""n't"", 'been', 'more', 'satisfying', 'phenomenon', 'Frozen', 'When', 'Disney', 'true', 'making', 'kind', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'hallmark', 'studio', '70', 'years', '34', 'magic', '34', 'thing', 'not', '34', 'magic', '34', 'word.At', 'first', 'glance', 'Frozen', ""n't"", 'seem', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'genre', 'great', 'storytelling', 'marvelous', 'score', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'everything', 'one', 'classic', 'Disney', 'overwhelming', 'success', 'more', 'landmark', 'may', 'seem.They', 'listened', 'audience', 'Not', 'data', 'research', 'focus', 'groups', 'everyday', 'life', 'movie', 'true', 'insight', 'where', 'young', 'old', 'really', 'are', 'day', 'age', 'Possible', 'more', 'most', 'live-action', 'movies', 'Frozen', 'commitment', 'loyalty', 'frustration', 'self-sacrifice', 'many', 'forms', 'love', 'not', 'me-me-me', 'ultimately', 'we-we-we', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'today', 'entertainment', 'you-deserve-a-break-today', 'message.To', 'best', 'thing', 'Frozen', 'music', 'songs', 'background', 'score', 'be', 'overshadowed', 'great', 'songs', 'family', 'musicals', 'may', 'have', 'life', 'again', 'perhaps', 'survive', 'little', 'longer', 'past', 'Disney', 'life', 'blood', 'animation', 'soul', 'songwriting', 'innovation', 'Lopezes', 'brought', 'stage', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'work', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Finding', 'Nemo-The', 'Musical', '34', 'revue', '34', 'song', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'humorous', 'Disney', 'songs', 'never', 'precise', 'kind', 'verbal', 'interplay', 'work', 'extremely', 'reverential', 'Disney', 'musical', 'canon', 'great', 'talents', 'created', 'songs.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'nice', 'there', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'inevitable', '34', 'Crystal', 'Edition', '34', 'such', 'reissue', 'Frozen', 'shattered', 'home', 'entertainment', 'records', 'way', 'did', 'box', 'office', 'Billboard.You', 'let', 'go', 'girl', 'BLU-RAY', 'BONUS', 'FEATURES', '8226', 'Original', 'Theatrical', 'Short', 'Get', 'Horse', '8226', 'Making', 'Frozen', '3:18', '8226', 'D-Frosted', 'Disney', 'Journey', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersento', 'Frozen', '7:28', '8226', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'optional', 'intros', 'directors', 'Never', 'Underestimate', 'Power', 'ElsaThe', 'Dressing', 'RoomMeet', 'Kristoff', '1Meet', 'Kristoff', '2', '8226', '34', 'Let', 'Go', '34', 'Music', 'Videos', '8226', 'Original', 'Teaser', 'TrailerDVD', 'BONUS', 'FEATURESOriginal', 'Theatrical', 'Short', 'Get', 'Horse', '34', 'Let', 'Go', '34', 'Music', 'Videos']",N/A

Ninety percent of Amazon reviewers rate Frozen as a 4.0 or 5.0.  In terms of World wide appeal Frozen has become the highest grossing animated film of all time.  Now, detractors will quickly point out that when inflation is considered, Frozen loses its top ranking.  However, there is a lot more competition for Frozen's movie ticket dollars than existed  for older films - how many of you waited until Frozen came out on Blu-ray to watch the film?  The point is that Frozen is a tremendous success and that  would not have happened unless the movie was something truly special.  A prevalent theme in many reviews, both within and outside of Amazon's forum, is repeated viewing by the reviewer or their acquaintances.  This is probably the highest compliment that a film can garner and is a hallmark of great cinema.  So,  3.7 percent of reviewers can slam Frozen and claim that it is a waste of time, but they are a statistical anomaly that can be scientifically discounted.

1674617,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B00FZM8Z7I,Grimluke,"[2, 3]","As much as I love Disney, I have noticed that their recent films haven't been quite as up to scale as the classics they made in the 90's. That doesn't mean I don't like recent Disney films. I even liked The Lone Ranger for crying out loud! (I have a review if you want to know why) In fact, Wreck-It Ralph is one of my favorite cartoons to date. I just prefer that epic feel that I got out of Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Tarzan, etc. When I heard that this movie was being compared to some of those older movies, I got pretty excited (despite being a Disney princess movie). The trailers, however, weren't so convincing. It looked funny, but not what I was looking for. Anyways, after seeing the movie I was very satisfied. Here's my breakdown of the movie:Story: The story is about two sisters of royal blood. One (Anna) is normal enough, but the other (Elsa) has magical ice powers (they don't explain WHY she has these powers, but I don't really care), and she can't seem to control it very well. They are separated for years to prevent harm from coming to Anna. Things are pretty rough, considering one is completely ignoring the other, and the other doesn't know why, but eventually, Elsa accidentally releases her power and freezes the entire land. She goes off into hiding in the mountains, and her sister Anna goes after her with the help of a mountain man named Kristoff, his reindeer, and eventually a snowman named Olaf. It's a creative enough story, but there aren't any big plot twists or anything like that. It's overall a good story.Animation: The animation is great, particularly all the ice effects (it's shiny).Voice Acting: No big-name actors involved as far as I can tell, but they're all very talented.Music: Like Tangled, Frozen is a musical. Unlike Tangled, pretty much all the songs are really good. Tangled had one or two really good ones, while the rest were just okay. I thought most of the songs in this movie were memorable. They really remind me of ones from The Lion King and all of those other classics from the 90's.Writing: While hilarious at times, this isn't as comedy-based as Wreck-It Ralph or Tangled. It has a good mix of humor and seriousness (once again, like the ones from the 90's), but it's mostly light-hearted.Verdict: In the end, Frozen is exactly what Disney needed: another classic. For years, I always looked to Pixar for that great mix of comedy and story, but recently it's felt like Disney's and Pixar's places have switched (Monsters University was great, but I'm referring to the simpler, less-story driven movies like Cars 2 and Brave). Let's hope that Disney continues to be this good for years to come.Final Score: 8.9 out of 10.",4,Modern Classic,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,2697,"['As', 'much', 'love', 'Disney', 'have', 'noticed', 'recent', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'quite', 'scale', 'classics', 'made', '90', ""n't"", 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'recent', 'Disney', 'films', 'even', 'liked', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'have', 'review', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'fact', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'one', 'favorite', 'cartoons', 'date', 'just', 'prefer', 'epic', 'feel', 'got', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Lion', 'King', 'Tarzan', 'etc', 'When', 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'compared', 'older', 'movies', 'got', 'pretty', 'excited', 'being', 'Disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'trailers', 'however', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'convincing', 'looked', 'funny', 'not', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'Anyways', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'Here', 'breakdown', 'movie', 'Story', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'royal', 'blood', 'One', 'Anna', 'normal', 'enough', 'other', 'Elsa', 'magical', 'ice', 'powers', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'WHY', 'powers', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'control', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'separated', 'years', 'prevent', 'harm', 'coming', 'Anna', 'Things', 'are', 'pretty', 'rough', 'considering', 'one', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'other', 'other', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'eventually', 'Elsa', 'accidentally', 'power', 'entire', 'land', 'off', 'hiding', 'mountains', 'sister', 'Anna', 'help', 'mountain', 'man', 'named', 'Kristoff', 'reindeer', 'eventually', 'snowman', 'named', 'Olaf', 'creative', 'enough', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'plot', 'twists', 'anything', 'overall', 'good', 'story.Animation', 'animation', 'great', 'particularly', 'ice', 'effects', 'shiny', '.Voice', 'Acting', 'big-name', 'actors', 'involved', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', ""'re"", 'very', 'talented.Music', 'Tangled', 'Frozen', 'musical', 'Tangled', 'pretty', 'much', 'songs', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'Tangled', 'had', 'one', 'two', 'really', 'good', 'ones', 'rest', 'were', 'just', 'okay', 'thought', 'most', 'songs', 'movie', 'were', 'memorable', 'really', 'remind', 'ones', 'Lion', 'King', 'other', 'classics', ""90's.Writing"", 'hilarious', 'times', ""n't"", 'as', 'comedy-based', 'Wreck-It', 'Ralph', 'Tangled', 'good', 'mix', 'humor', 'seriousness', 'once', 'again', 'ones', '90', 'mostly', 'light-hearted.Verdict', 'end', 'Frozen', 'exactly', 'what', 'Disney', 'needed', 'classic', 'years', 'always', 'looked', 'Pixar', 'great', 'mix', 'comedy', 'story', 'recently', 'felt', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'places', 'have', 'switched', 'Monsters', 'University', 'was', 'great', ""'m"", 'referring', 'simpler', 'less-story', 'driven', 'movies', 'Cars', '2', 'Brave', 'Let', 'hope', 'Disney', 'be', 'good', 'years', 'come.Final', 'Score', '8.9', '10']",N/A

A last act twist is rather brilliant, but for me the film's attempts to subvert and rise above the standard Disney story conventions gave FROZEN ambitions that the film itself never stepped up to fulfill.  Worse, the musical numbers felt more like filler than the classical Disney sequences that use song to advance the story by leaps and bounds - only an early musical number really advanced the plot and felt choreographed, while a bit involving Trolls was the film's low point.  The biggest tragedy is Disney setting up one of its most complex women protagonists only to ignore her character's depths for most of the run time.  I suppose I'm especially harsh as an animator -  for most families FROZEN will be a fun film and little girls especially will adore it.

It has been that as an adult I was introduced to them; I mistakenly thought that my kids should be familiar with them. I still haven't watched several of the Disney animated classics...and I could live without doing so.  I would rather read the books if I had to expose them to the stories.  So, I have only become familiar with them as perhaps an overly analytical parent who is careful about what her children watch.  This movie has a PG rating...that is appropriate.Though there are lots of good qualities in this movie, this will not be a regular for my family. (Small  children will like it.  Probably ages 2-6  especially...even older ones will not mind watching.)  I don't base my rating on popularity among the crowds, but the overall content as I see it.The strongest message was very biblical:  ""perfect love casts out fear"".The obvious evil in this movie are those who pretend to be something that they are not.I saw that fear can be evil, destructive and contagious.  I also saw true love is healing, merciful, edifying, just, and contagious as well.  True love isn't always a romantic love either.Lots of good in this movie.  I wish someone would think of other stories to bring us with good values and messages, minus the witch (even if a good one--is that an oxymoron?), a spell, magic, trolls, a curse, etc.This movie reminds me a little of the story (not movie) of Beauty and the Beast but still quite different because of the twists.  If you liked Beauty and the Beast, you will like this movie.There, I think I gave a fair, honest opinion/review without giving out the whole story.I was drawn to read this story because of a review I read from a reliable source.  A story about ""Redeemption"" is what I understood it to be ...I was ready for something like that to come from Disney, so I was eager to watch it and I read reviews before hand...I had no idea that there was any magic from the reviews...I probably would not have bought it if I had known.So I hope this helps someone out one way or another to be informed.By the way, at the end of the movie, it is noted that the story is based on Andersen's The Snow Queen...a work that I was not familiar with.",3,"Lots of Beauty, Lots of Love, Lots of White Magic...Typical Disney Movie",1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,2233,"['was', ""n't"", 'raised', 'watching', 'Disney', 'movies', 'child', 'been', 'adult', 'was', 'introduced', 'mistakenly', 'thought', 'kids', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'several', 'Disney', 'animated', 'classics', 'could', 'live', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'rather', 'read', 'books', 'had', 'expose', 'stories', 'So', 'have', 'only', 'become', 'familiar', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'analytical', 'parent', 'who', 'careful', 'what', 'children', 'watch', 'movie', 'PG', 'rating', 'are', 'lots', 'good', 'qualities', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'regular', 'family', 'Small', 'children', 'will', 'like', 'Probably', '2-6', 'especially', 'even', 'older', 'ones', 'will', 'not', 'mind', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'base', 'rating', 'popularity', 'crowds', 'overall', 'content', 'see', 'it.The', 'strongest', 'message', 'was', 'very', 'biblical', 'perfect', 'love', 'out', 'fear', '.The', 'obvious', 'evil', 'movie', 'are', 'who', 'pretend', 'be', 'something', 'are', 'not.I', 'saw', 'fear', 'can', 'be', 'evil', 'destructive', 'contagious', 'also', 'saw', 'true', 'love', 'healing', 'merciful', 'edifying', 'just', 'contagious', 'as', 'well', 'True', 'love', ""n't"", 'always', 'romantic', 'love', 'either.Lots', 'good', 'movie', 'wish', 'someone', 'would', 'think', 'other', 'stories', 'bring', 'good', 'values', 'messages', 'witch', 'even', 'good', 'one', 'oxymoron', 'spell', 'magic', 'trolls', 'curse', 'etc.This', 'movie', 'little', 'story', 'not', 'movie', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'still', 'quite', 'different', 'twists', 'liked', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'will', 'like', 'movie.There', 'think', 'gave', 'fair', 'honest', 'opinion/review', 'giving', 'out', 'whole', 'story.I', 'was', 'drawn', 'read', 'story', 'review', 'read', 'reliable', 'source', 'story', 'Redeemption', 'what', 'understood', 'be', 'was', 'ready', 'something', 'come', 'Disney', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'read', 'reviews', 'hand', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'magic', 'reviews', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bought', 'had', 'known.So', 'hope', 'someone', 'out', 'one', 'way', 'be', 'informed.By', 'way', 'end', 'movie', 'noted', 'story', 'based', 'Andersen', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'familiar']",N/A

They detracted rather than added to the story and the development of the characters. Towards the final part of the movie they finally stopped the songs to allow the plot and action to pick up the lost pace. It's a shame because they really could have done something special with this animation. Perhaps 1 or 2 songs but not the quantity they had.

First off, I'm a huge fan of animation especially once made by Disney I really enjoyed Tangled and Brave so much to the point where I was expecting Frozen to be made of the same enjoyment but alas the story was muffled, bizarre and completely uncoordinated it felt like a mash up of multiple story lines into one.So, first off The story is supposed to represent *friendship* between two sisters, one has magical powers Elsa who's an albino and the other one is Ana who's very normal and is the sweeter, younger one. While they were playing as kids making magic with Elisa's powers Ana happened to suffer a blow that might've caused her death but thankfully she was saved by some wise trolls who erased her memory of Elsa ever having magical snow powers and warned her family that Elsa's powers will grow by time to be great as well as dangerous if and unless she can control them. So the parents go back to their castle and trap their gifted daughter into a room secluded from people, they suppress her magical powers by making her wear a glove and that continues for years till they go to sea and all of a sudden die. Only during conurbation day does Elsa get to see people including her sister Ana who meets a prince then decided to marry and then Elsa got angry and her magical powers went out of hand then the whole kingdom was put through the so called eternal winter and Elsa ran off, her sister came after her to try and stop her....Everything this movie was throwing at me was predictable. The ending was abrupt and disappointing it made me want more. Maybe I was expecting more? The characters were shallow and one dimensional very naive and stupid? I didn't understand the moral of this story.

A heartwarming tale of separation and devotion between sisters, Disney undoes 80 years of damage to girls' psyches by redefining ""true love"" as something other than the kiss of a handsome prince. Whose heart doesn't ache at the dilemma of Anna and Elsa? Who doesn't thrill to the action sequences and laugh at the hijinx of the adorable snowman Olaf? The actors bring all the characters vividly to life. The casting of Kristen Bell as the feisty, optimistic Anna and Idina Menzel as her gifted but troubled sister Elsa is fantastic. Visually stunning, the color schemes and special effects rock. The songs are short, witty, hummable and always enhance character or move the action forward. ""Let It Go"" has become a rather annoying earworm from constant radio play but is perfect in the context of the film. Although the female characters are cinch-waisted with little button noses, they are active, powerful individuals. Elsa struggles to understand and control her powers while Anna is directly engaged in every effort to save her sister. ""Frozen"" is a wonderful change of pace for animated films.

1674680,AIO247KHD2O40,B00FZM8Z7I,James N Simpson,"[0, 0]","Frozen is hyped as being a revolutionary film in the world of animated ones. It's not.  In the past movies such as Toy Story had the same hype, but they actually were unique, both animation wise and storyline wise in the fact they catered just as much for adults as well as kids and had their own unique stories.  Frozen is watchable but it's not a movie that deserves the hype that Disney's marketing machine has created for it.Paragraph contains spoilers - Frozen is a been there, seen that before movie plot. You can predict everything that is about to happen simply because you've already seen it before in other films. The prince who tells the naive princess he loves her really has an ulterior motive?  The twist would have been if he didn't.  His horse in this one was taken right out of Tangled, the other main male character (Ice Block Man Deliverer's) Reindeer in it's younger days was an animated dog companion that pushes the rolling boy along or into something with it's head that you've seen over and over again in countless films.  Then it's older version pretty much became Donkey from Shrek without Murphy's voice.  In fact there's pretty much a recreation of the scene where Shrek doesn't think Princess Fiona and him could ever be together, due to him being an ogre and her a princess, the same term true love is even mentioned, then the donkey, I mean reindeer convinces his ice block man companion to wake up to himself and revaluate the situation.More Spoilers - The princesses were both suffering from some big mental issues due to being locked away from other human contact (other than a servant or two) for most of their childhood lives so I didn't actually find it unrealistic like some people do that the younger one (Anna) instantly falls in love literally with the first guy she ever sees.  The fact that he mentions he's a prince would have instantly made her think, I'm a princess, a princess is supposed to marry a prince, I'm having fun for the first time since I was little girl, I don't want this to end, so this must be love.  In fact the Ice Block Deliverer Boy/Man would have also been suffering from the same mental issues being razed by trolls who kidnapped him after he discovered their existence, and only probably interacting with other humans when selling the ice and buying stuff for the trolls with the money so his human parents never found him.  So when Anna assertively makes him take her to the top of the mountain and her sister, this is probably the first time he's spent any time or had much of a conversation with a female human before as well, so again the feeling of love.  Plus they would also have the normal hormonal teens lustful feelings all teenagers do which being they lacked much of an interaction with others upbringing may have further confused the issue.  The older princess sister apparently can't control her magic, but knows how to not only design spiral staircases that can go up the height of mountains and not fall down with handrails and be able to take the weight of climbers but can make them out of ice as well.  Can bring the snow to life as snowmen or giant monsters but yet couldn't trust herself to talk to her sister while she was growing up.  That's a bit inconsistent.Spoilers - Olaf, the snowman I thought was going to be irritating from the previews but isn't actually that bad.  Some of his facial expressions and accompanying voice personality in those scenes we've seen before with other animated sidekick or minor characters such as the one when Anna gives him his nose.  But overall I liked him, I thought he could have actually had a bit more screen time, maybe when the villager's see him for the first time and freak out (we only here a sentence in the background).  He actually showed true love so by being prepared to die for Anna by getting her near the fire so I don't know why that didn't save her without the need for the later scenes with the sister.Surprisingly Disney includes a scene where Anna punches someone in the head who annoyed her (Hans) when he's completely not expecting it. Like a lot of other stuff in this movie that sort of thing used to be part of the entertainment norm.  But we're now in 2014, an era where that kind of thing is no longer applauded and admired but instead labelled by society as a ""coward's punch"" and governments are running campaigns to change this sort of behaviour due to people being killed from just one punch, or becoming vegetables for life, you'd think Disney would have thought of a better way for Anna to handle her anger or give Hans his well deserved comeuppance.  It's not really the greatest lesson for kids to see and think is acceptable, emulate and then ruin their lives down the track when it becomes part of their natural instinct behaviour when they are older and in relationships and get some lip, or if stranger spills their drink, glances at someone they are interested in or something like this down the track.",3,"Been There.

I heard the reviews from people bashing it. I didn't read what the critics had to say and decided that &#34; I &#34; would be the judge of good or bad.  My first recommendation is this: don't listen to what anyone tells you, good or bad, be your own judge.Now already thinking this movie would be bad just from the trailers I went ahead and gave it a chance. I thought the plot would follow the classic formula, which in a sense it did, but it has major twists and if you really look into how the plot plays out you will discover a very powerful message. It ended up being nothing as I had imagined, it ended up &#34;in my opinion&#34; being one of the most fulfilling animated movies that I had ever seen. Granted I know my Disney animated movies pretty well and there are stories I cared about growing up and others that I didn't think were great and missed the mark.All else I will say is this, although it may have a prince and princesses, it wasn't a story about a prince and a princess. It was about learning the definition of what love is really about. For people that couldn't see that, well they are missing the mark. For those of you that do see the point I guarantee that it will be worth it. I suggest you watch the movie before buying the DVD and decide afterwards if you want to invest in having it be part of your collection.

Of course it's on blu-ray so the picture is outstanding, and it's awesome that it comes with a DVD copy as well. First and foremost, this movie is a musical.

One night while playing with her sister Anna, Elsa hits her sister in the head with her powers. She is then taken to a group of trolls who are able to fix the cold in her head, but they remove the memory of the magic. Elsa then is required to longer see or play with Anna. Elsa's parents also attempt to help her control it so that no one will find out and that she will not injure anyone again. Her parents end up passing away due to a tragic accident and Elsa and Anna are left in their castle. Elsa becomes the new queen.

Dean ""John""","[0, 0]","This won't cover the movie, that's been reviewed plenty before the DVD and Blu Ray were released, so this will cover the actual Blu Ray.Unfortunately as with so many, there's a bunch of previews right away, but at least here you can skip them. I'm so tired of discs that don't let you skip past them, and was very glad here we could.My son is 10 and loves this movie, since he's totally obsessed with the music in it. We didn't see it in the theaters until Feb, several months after it was first released. We got the expanded soundtrack within minutes of getting home, and it's the only thing he's let me play in the car for over a month and a half now. When the digital download was released, I got that to hold us over until the Blu Ray release. It was disappointing in that it had such poor sound, stereo only. And of course it was rather compressed, so even the 1080 version wasn't very impressive.So when I got this one playing, I felt stunned because it's such a night and day comparison to the iTunes version I have. I use a Media Center PC so anything I watch, or any of my movies, all play on my 55&#34; LED TV.  But I dislike having to use iTunes for watching movies in my setup, I prefer my own Media Browser system to watch my digital movies, or my Xbox One for watching Blu Ray discs. The PC I use has a blu ray player, but the software has a tendency to get the audio out of sync slightly, which is annoying.Extras - it has the &#34;Get a Horse&#34; short that my son loved, several version of the music video, and not just the English versions. It has a very slick extra that talks about some things in the 40's where they initially had assigned a production number to &#34;The Snow Queen&#34; even though it was never realized. This video also had some of the artwork from one of the original Disney artists, I don't recall his name, but there were some really nice shots of some of the things he drew along the Ice Queen theme, and the producers of Frozen talked with his widow about some of his drawings, and compared some of the things they incorporated that they recognized in his work. There is also a &#34;Deleted Scenes&#34; bit that has pseudo animation by taking the storyboard shots and running them one after another to give some sense of motion. But nothing in there really impressed me, and I can see why they were cut. Interestingly enough though was a storyboard about when Elsa was originally going to be &#34;Evil&#34; at the beginning of the work on the project.But back to the picture quality - amazing. I'm watching it now, and after having seen the iTunes version so many times, I just keep gasping at each scene, and how amazing it looks now compared to what we're used to. Surround sound is well done, and it's nice getting the voices out of the center channel and music out of the sides and rear as well as the sound effects. Even in the &#34;Get a Horse&#34; short the surround sound aspects were well done for when Mickey flies the &#34;cow airplane&#34; around behind the audience.Bright, vibrant, and no &#34;washing out&#34; of any of the colors. It's great being able to pause it to see details so clearly, like the cameo of Rapunzel and Flynn.All in all, this will likely be one of the more played DVD's in our Pixar / Disney collection for quite some time, and it was well worth buying.

1674783,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00FZM8Z7I,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[1, 1]","I have to admit I almost feel a little embarrassed giving FROZEN my highest rating. However, in spite of my reservations about this retelling -- er, Disneyfication -- of Hans Christian Andersen's SNOW QUEEN -- being a CG film and not a traditional one (the latter format could have been used just as effectively for a film like this) -- FROZEN is surprisingly really good. Which is not something I was expecting to say given how disappointed I was with TANGLED. However, FROZEN earns my highest rating for the following reasons.While this is a &#34;Disneyfied&#34; SNOW QUEEN, it's not done in the manner one would normally expect. This is arguably a darker, edgier re-imagining; the title queen in this story is Elsa, one of two sisters whose primary motivation for causing eternal winter is not out of outright evil, but for more complex issues. The whole conflict starts off because of an accident that traumatized her and her sister, Anna, in childhood, leading the girl to become emotionally distant. This lends a surprisingly more &#34;adult&#34; angle to the story.But the best part about FROZEN is how Disney turns two of its tried and true cliches completely on its heels. There IS a handsome prince, yes, and he does romance Anna, but not for the reasons one would expect. Furthermore, the climactic &#34;act of true love&#34; needed to break Elsa's spell isn't romantic, but sister related. It's because of this that FROZEN emerges as one of Disney's best fairy tales in a long time.The chemistry between the principal characters is also very well done, especially the sister dynamic between the more aloof, distant Elsa and the outgoing, socially awkward (but sweet-natured) Anna.  Prince Hans, as mentioned, isn't the picture perfect figure you'd expect.  If anything, the most interesting character has to be Kristoff, a somewhat grumpy ice hauler who grudgingly agrees to help Anna find her, but naturally he turns out to be a real soft-hearted gentleman.  Naturally, this DOES give this film a &#34;love triangle&#34; angle, but to reveal how it is resolved would be the equivalent of giving spoilers.The music is also great, especially Elsa's charged ballad &#34;Let it Go.&#34; (The only exception is a gospel-flavored song involving trolls, which isn't BAD by any means, it just struck me as out of place with the tone of the story.) Even the occasional comic relief (from a snowman and a mute elk) doesn't overpower the dramatic depth of the story.  There ARE a few places where I think Disney could have toned down the laughs, though, but it's nowhere nearly as grating as in TANGLED.I'm not quite sure where FROZEN ranks in terms of Disney's all-time greatest films, but I WAS pleasantly charmed by it and it exceeded my expectations.",5,Exceeds frozen expectations.,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,2756,"['have', 'admit', 'almost', 'feel', 'little', 'embarrassed', 'giving', 'FROZEN', 'highest', 'rating', 'However', 'spite', 'reservations', 'retelling', 'er', 'Disneyfication', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'SNOW', 'QUEEN', 'being', 'CG', 'film', 'not', 'traditional', 'one', 'latter', 'format', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'just', 'effectively', 'film', 'FROZEN', 'surprisingly', 'really', 'good', 'Which', 'not', 'something', 'was', 'expecting', 'say', 'given', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'TANGLED', 'However', 'FROZEN', 'highest', 'rating', 'following', 'reasons.While', '34', 'Disneyfied', '34', 'SNOW', 'QUEEN', 'not', 'done', 'manner', 'one', 'would', 'normally', 'expect', 'arguably', 'darker', 'edgier', 're-imagining', 'title', 'queen', 'story', 'Elsa', 'one', 'two', 'sisters', 'primary', 'motivation', 'causing', 'eternal', 'winter', 'not', 'outright', 'evil', 'more', 'complex', 'issues', 'whole', 'conflict', 'accident', 'traumatized', 'sister', 'Anna', 'childhood', 'leading', 'girl', 'become', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'surprisingly', 'more', '34', 'adult', '34', 'angle', 'story.But', 'best', 'part', 'FROZEN', 'how', 'Disney', 'two', 'tried', 'true', 'cliches', 'completely', 'heels', 'handsome', 'prince', 'yes', 'romance', 'Anna', 'not', 'reasons', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Furthermore', 'climactic', '34', 'act', 'true', 'love', '34', 'needed', 'break', 'Elsa', 'spell', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'sister', 'related', 'FROZEN', 'one', 'Disney', 'best', 'fairy', 'tales', 'long', 'time.The', 'chemistry', 'principal', 'characters', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'sister', 'dynamic', 'more', 'aloof', 'distant', 'Elsa', 'outgoing', 'socially', 'awkward', 'sweet-natured', 'Anna', 'Prince', 'Hans', 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'picture', 'perfect', 'figure', ""'d"", 'expect', 'anything', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'be', 'Kristoff', 'somewhat', 'grumpy', 'ice', 'hauler', 'who', 'grudgingly', 'help', 'Anna', 'find', 'naturally', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'soft-hearted', 'gentleman', 'Naturally', 'DOES', 'give', 'film', '34', 'love', 'triangle', '34', 'angle', 'reveal', 'how', 'resolved', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'giving', 'spoilers.The', 'music', 'also', 'great', 'especially', 'Elsa', 'charged', 'ballad', '34', 'Let', 'Go.', '34', 'only', 'exception', 'gospel-flavored', 'song', 'involving', 'trolls', ""n't"", 'BAD', 'means', 'just', 'struck', 'place', 'tone', 'story', 'Even', 'occasional', 'comic', 'relief', 'snowman', 'mute', 'elk', ""n't"", 'overpower', 'dramatic', 'depth', 'story', 'ARE', 'few', 'places', 'where', 'think', 'Disney', 'could', 'have', 'toned', 'down', 'laughs', 'though', 'nowhere', 'nearly', 'as', 'grating', 'TANGLED.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'where', 'FROZEN', 'terms', 'Disney', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'films', 'WAS', 'pleasantly', 'charmed', 'exceeded', 'expectations']",N/A

The girls are separated from each other and isolated from the rest of Arendelle in the castle.The second problem is, after a few years, the parents go on a trip and die. The girls grow up in a rather austere life which is finally intruded upon by Elsa's coronation, when people are again invited into the castle. Elsa barely makes it through the coronation ceremony without her power going haywire. Meanwhile, Anna has met and fallen in love with a prince from a faraway land who has come for the celebration. He is quite charming and seems like such a good match that he proposes and she accepts. Ask Elsa for her blessing at the ball, to which she says, &#34;You can't possibly marry someone you just met.&#34; Things escalate and Elsa's power go out of control. She flees to the mountains. Her power has caused a massive winter storm that causes perpetual winter in Arendelle.Anna decides to go after her sister, eventually joining up with Kristoff, a mountain man whose ice-selling business is hurting thanks to the July deep freeze. They search for Elsa to bring her back home and end the storm.The movie is quite delightful. The songs are good and the story moves along at a brisk pace. The animation is beautiful, especially the several snow and ice scenes. The 3D is fine though not remarkable.Where this movie really shines is the relationships between the various characters, especially the sisters. Most parents probably agree wholeheartedly with Elsa when she forbids her sister to marry a man she's only known for a day. They've had a strained relationship due to their isolation from each other (which is partly Elsa's own choosing since she does not want to hurt her sister). They try to love each other but are unsure of what is best.The theme of what is true love is well-explored throughout the movie. At one point, a group of pleasant trolls try to marry Kristoff and Anna to each other. They sing a delightful song about how Kristoff is a &#34;fixer-upper,&#34; comically describing his foibles (both physical and social) that she needs to know about and put up with. As the song progresses, the trolls realize Anna needs some fixing-up too, and not just her dress. While highly comical, the song also points out that we all have our imperfections and that love needs to be more than idealistic romanticism. The theme is explored with a sort of depth rare in Disney princess movies.I highly recommend the movie.",5,Great addition to the Disney canon,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,2814,"['Frozen', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'daughters', 'king', 'Arendelle', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'First', 'older', 'sister', 'Elsa', 'power', 'make', 'things', 'freeze', 'not', 'have', 'full', 'control', 'childhood', 'accident', 'where', 'Elsa', 'almost', 'harmed', 'sister', 'Anna', 'parents', 'have', 'Anna', 'memories', 'altered', 'so', ""n't"", 'remember', 'sister', 'special', 'abilities', 'girls', 'are', 'separated', 'other', 'isolated', 'rest', 'Arendelle', 'castle.The', 'second', 'problem', 'few', 'years', 'parents', 'go', 'trip', 'die', 'girls', 'grow', 'up', 'rather', 'austere', 'life', 'finally', 'intruded', 'upon', 'Elsa', 'coronation', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'again', 'invited', 'castle', 'Elsa', 'barely', 'coronation', 'ceremony', 'power', 'going', 'haywire', 'Meanwhile', 'Anna', 'met', 'fallen', 'love', 'prince', 'faraway', 'land', 'who', 'come', 'celebration', 'quite', 'charming', 'good', 'match', 'Ask', 'Elsa', 'blessing', 'ball', '34', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'marry', 'someone', 'just', 'met.', '34', 'Things', 'escalate', 'Elsa', 'power', 'go', 'control', 'mountains', 'power', 'caused', 'massive', 'winter', 'storm', 'perpetual', 'winter', 'Arendelle.Anna', 'go', 'sister', 'eventually', 'joining', 'up', 'Kristoff', 'mountain', 'man', 'ice-selling', 'business', 'hurting', 'thanks', 'July', 'deep', 'freeze', 'search', 'Elsa', 'bring', 'back', 'home', 'end', 'storm.The', 'movie', 'quite', 'delightful', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'story', 'along', 'brisk', 'pace', 'animation', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'several', 'snow', 'ice', 'scenes', '3D', 'fine', 'not', 'remarkable.Where', 'movie', 'really', 'relationships', 'various', 'characters', 'especially', 'sisters', 'Most', 'parents', 'probably', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'Elsa', 'when', 'forbids', 'sister', 'marry', 'man', 'only', 'known', 'day', ""'ve"", 'had', 'strained', 'relationship', 'due', 'isolation', 'other', 'partly', 'Elsa', 'own', 'choosing', 'not', 'want', 'hurt', 'sister', 'try', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'unsure', 'what', 'best.The', 'theme', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'well-explored', 'movie', 'one', 'point', 'group', 'pleasant', 'trolls', 'try', 'marry', 'Kristoff', 'Anna', 'other', 'sing', 'delightful', 'song', 'how', 'Kristoff', '34', 'fixer-upper', '34', 'comically', 'describing', 'foibles', 'physical', 'social', 'know', 'about', 'put', 'up', 'song', 'trolls', 'realize', 'Anna', 'fixing-up', 'too', 'not', 'just', 'dress', 'highly', 'comical', 'song', 'also', 'out', 'have', 'imperfections', 'love', 'be', 'more', 'idealistic', 'romanticism', 'theme', 'explored', 'sort', 'depth', 'rare', 'Disney', 'princess', 'movies.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

1674806,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B00FZM8Z7I,judy,"[1, 1]","Alright, I have finally seen the animated film that has been talked about for the last 6 or so months. Almost everyone I know has seen the film, as well as most people everyone else anywhere apparently (The film has made well over a billion dollars). You could say I under estimated the film's potential, I did, I didn't expect the film to reach such a following as it has, and now that I have finally seen the film myself I see why it's received so much attention. It's really a beautiful film from Disney. Would I say we are entering another Disney Renaissance? No, at least not yet, but I would say 'Frozen' made a large leap toward it. I estimated back in November, a total gross of 500 million even, similar to the studio's previous venture in 'Wreak it Ralph'. And now it's grossed well over a billion dollars. A little fun fact is the film played in my own home town theater for 14 weeks from its release of November 27th to March 7th. I'm just amazed at how strong the film was, and now I say I'm not as amazed because I understand why. My review of 'Frozen'.'Frozen' tells the tale of sisters Elsa and Anna. Elsa, however freezes whatever she touches and his magical abilities, after nearly killing her sister in an accident as a child, Elsa hides herself away till adulthood. When she is finally forced to reveal herself as she is titled Queen, her powers are unfortunately discovered, with Elsa fleeing into the woods in a fit of anger turning the country into a blizzard of snow and ice. Now it is up to her sister, Anna with the help of an ice maker with a warm heart, Kristoff, a snowman Olaf, and a reindeer Sven, to find Elsa and return summer to the country.The formula is typical Disney, but it's told with such tender care and ease, it doesn't make any difference. You still feel as if you're journeying into something new. It's warm hearted storytelling. The story connects well with the audience, with a heart that has been missing recently in Disney films. You feel Elsa's pain in the story, which is really uplifting.The animation is beyond beautifully rendered. It's very soft to touch. The designs of Elsa's snow castle are particularly beautiful. The shots of snow are cleanly animated and surprisingly realistic looking. The character animation never misses a note; with Anna looking particularly human through the first 1/3 of the film.The songs while mostly nothing to brag about, one stands out as magnificent. 'Let it Go' won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and it deserves it. It's emotionally powerful, and gripping. It showcases Elsa, as anything but a villain. It is original, catchy and can be heard multiple times. The opposite could be said of 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman?'. I found that one to be beyond annoying and while it does express emotions I found tit o be cringe worthy and not very good. Most of the songs end up being just sub-par except 'Let it Go'.The voice cast excels, with 'Idina Menzel' vocally performing the song 'Let it Go' and expressing Elsa's distress and sadness wonderfully well. 'Kristian Bell' is beautiful as the voice of our heroine, Anna and 'Josh Gad' is very witty as the snowman, Olaf in the short amount of screentime he receives.But I do express disappointment with the lack of character development. The film's pacing really doesn't allow for much. Its speeds by not allowing for our heroines, Anna and Elsa to be much of anything. Anna more in particular falls into a seemingly plain Disney model, with no style or substance to make herself differentiate from previous Disney females. The same can be said to the male characters, Hans and Kristoff who play out as generic male love interests for the female leads.All and all 'Frozen' may not be the most superior Disney film, but with strong animation, emotionally gripping voice casting, and the near classic song 'Let it Go', 'Frozen' is still one of Disney's best to date.

Incidentally, as one of my friends pointed out, there are parallels between Elsa and Elphaba - from Wicked)Character development: 3.5 starsCharacters: Princess Elsa (5 Stars), Princess Anna (5 Stars), Prince Hans (4 stars), Kristoff (sorry, not sure about spelling 4 stars), Olaf (3.5 stars, he's goffy comic relief), Sven (the reindeer, 4.5 stars)Songs: Most of the songs were just all right, but ""Let it Go"" was amazing and I liked how they used the ""Do you want to build a snowman"" song to cover the passage of time as the girls grow up.Story synopsis: Princess Elsa and Princess Anna were once best buddies, but a tragic, childhood accident forces Elsa to shut her sister out of her life for fear of hurting her again. When their parents die Disney style, both sisters suffer the loss feeling more alone. Three years later, after the coronation ceremony, a dispute/ misunderstanding leads Elsa to run away, inadvertently plunging the kingdom into a never-ending winter. Now it's up to Anna to find her sister and beg her to bring back summer weather.Short review: Overall, it's a wonderful modern Disney movie. You're going to get some wonderful songs as well as some weird, awkward, uncessary songs - they're thankfully relatively short. The animation of the demonstration of Elsa's powers was suitably amazing.(As with all things, you could totally read more into it. It's actually not a great movie for parenting advice. Elsa's got this amazing ability to turn things into snow and ice and they're answer is to hide the ability and basiclaly lock the kid away for years. Ignore all that and just enjoy the show for what it is.)Who would enjoy this movie?: It's a great movie to see with your sister. If you don't have a sister, grab some girlfriends or borrow a kid to treat to the show. Kids of all ages (even kids at heart) will likely enjoy the movie. Although the ""those who love it"" group will likely be more female than male, I can easily see guys who like Disney movies in general also liking this. It's made by creators of Tangled so there's definitely some of that feel to it.Conclusion: Go see it in theaters. Buy the dvd or bluray :-)Update: As you can see, I actually bought the bluray. Since most of you are strangers and don't know how incredibly frugal/ stingy I can be it won't have that big of an impact, but this is the first Disney movie I'm actually buying in my adult life.",5,"Fantastic, Fun, Heartwarming, and so on ...",1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,2890,"['***Mild', 'unintentional', 'spoilers', 'always', 'possible', 'when', 'rambling', 'ranting', 'raving***Since', 'snowing', 'furiously', 'guess', 'good', 'time', 'review', 'movie.Poster', 'art', '3', 'stars', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'really', 'story', 'Elsa', 'Anna', 'story', 'poster', 'Olaf', 'snowman', 'central', 'spot.Story', '4', 'starsStory', 'twists', '5', 'starsAnimation', '5', 'starsVoice', 'Cast', '5', 'stars', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'wonderful', 'job', 'voicing', 'Elsa', 'so', 'rest', 'cast', 'roles', 'Incidentally', 'one', 'friends', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'parallels', 'Elsa', 'Elphaba', 'Wicked', 'Character', 'development', '3.5', 'starsCharacters', 'Princess', 'Elsa', '5', 'Stars', 'Princess', 'Anna', '5', 'Stars', 'Prince', 'Hans', '4', 'stars', 'Kristoff', 'sorry', 'not', 'sure', 'spelling', '4', 'stars', 'Olaf', '3.5', 'stars', 'goffy', 'comic', 'relief', 'Sven', 'reindeer', '4.5', 'stars', 'Songs', 'Most', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'all', 'right', 'Let', 'Go', 'was', 'amazing', 'liked', 'how', 'used', 'Do', 'want', 'build', 'snowman', 'song', 'cover', 'passage', 'time', 'girls', 'grow', 'up.Story', 'synopsis', 'Princess', 'Elsa', 'Princess', 'Anna', 'were', 'once', 'best', 'buddies', 'tragic', 'childhood', 'accident', 'forces', 'Elsa', 'shut', 'sister', 'life', 'fear', 'hurting', 'again', 'When', 'parents', 'die', 'Disney', 'style', 'sisters', 'suffer', 'loss', 'feeling', 'more', 'alone', 'Three', 'years', 'later', 'coronation', 'ceremony', 'dispute/', 'misunderstanding', 'leads', 'Elsa', 'run', 'away', 'inadvertently', 'plunging', 'kingdom', 'never-ending', 'winter', 'Now', 'up', 'Anna', 'find', 'sister', 'beg', 'bring', 'back', 'summer', 'weather.Short', 'review', 'Overall', 'wonderful', 'modern', 'Disney', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'as', 'well', 'weird', 'awkward', 'uncessary', 'songs', ""'re"", 'thankfully', 'relatively', 'short', 'animation', 'demonstration', 'Elsa', 'powers', 'was', 'suitably', 'amazing', 'things', 'could', 'totally', 'read', 'more', 'actually', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'parenting', 'advice', 'Elsa', 'got', 'amazing', 'ability', 'turn', 'things', 'snow', 'ice', ""'re"", 'answer', 'hide', 'ability', 'basiclaly', 'lock', 'kid', 'away', 'years', 'just', 'enjoy', 'show', 'what', 'Who', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'see', 'sister', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sister', 'grab', 'girlfriends', 'borrow', 'kid', 'treat', 'show', 'Kids', 'ages', 'even', 'kids', 'heart', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'who', 'love', 'group', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'more', 'female', 'male', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'guys', 'who', 'Disney', 'movies', 'general', 'also', 'liking', 'made', 'creators', 'Tangled', 'definitely', 'feel', 'it.Conclusion', 'Go', 'see', 'theaters', 'Buy', 'dvd', 'bluray', 'Update', 'can', 'see', 'actually', 'bought', 'bluray', 'most', 'are', 'strangers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'incredibly', 'frugal/', 'stingy', 'can', 'be', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'impact', 'first', 'Disney', 'movie', ""'m"", 'actually', 'buying', 'adult', 'life']",N/A

1674858,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B00FZM8Z7I,Kenya Starflight,"[6, 8]","I have to admit to being among the many people who was turned off from this movie by the previews and promotional material.  Based (loosely) on one of Hans Christian Andersen's classic tales it might be, but the trailers chose to focus primarily on an annoying talking snowman and a cute reindeer.  I understand that Disney has long marketed itself to children, but surely in the 70+ years Disney has been creating movies they've learned that there are plenty of teens and adults who watch their films as well.  Surely there's a market for this audience, or at least room for some ads that promote the more dramatic or adventurous elements of an animated film rather than focusing exclusively on the plucky comic relief.Issues with the advertising campaign aside, I finally caved to word of mouth and watched this film.  And I was pleasantly surprised to find that instead of a goofy animated romp, it's a wonderful fantasy adventure-drama that all ages can enjoy.Inspired by Andersen's fairy tale ""The Snow Queen,"" ""Frozen"" follows the story of two princesses -- aloof and reserved older sister Elsa, who struggles to hide her growing ice powers from the world; and the clumsy and naive but eternally optimistic Anna, who can't understand why her sister shuts everyone out of her life.  When disaster strikes on Elsa's coronation day and her powers are revealed to the world, she flees to the mountains, accidentally plunging the kingdom into eternal winter.  Undeterred, Anna rides off to find her sister and bring her home, and gains some unexpected allies along the way -- crude and antisocial but kindhearted ice-worker Kristoff, his pet reindeer Sven, and the clueless but ever-curious living snowman Olaf.  Anna's quest is complicated along the way, however... for Elsa doesn't want to return home, and there are powers conspiring to seize the throne back home...Many of Disney's non-Pixar computer-animated films have been sadly lackluster in the past in comparison to Pixar and Dreamworks -- ""Chicken Little,"" ""Meet the Robinsons,"" and ""The Wild"" all come to mind.  But like ""Tangled"" before it, ""Frozen"" is gorgeously animated, maintaining the look and feel of its classic animated films while still portraying its fairy-tale world in lush detail.  The winter wonderland of this film is beautifully portrayed, especially Elsa's ice palace and the snow-locked kingdom she leaves behind.  And the characters are well-rendered and animated without falling into the uncanny valley as some CGI humans tend to do (see ""Polar Express,"" the first ""Toy Story,"" and even the human characters in the ""Shrek"" movies).  My one nitpick is that the CGI water looks a little wonky, but then, water is a difficult substance to animate.The story is only vaguely similar to the original fairy tale, but this is not a bad thing.  Disney has created a beautiful original tale that subverts and twists many of the familiar Disney themes and tropes, creating something fresh and new -- something the franchise has desperately needed.  The nature of true love is explored, the princesses are fully realized characters who aren't constantly in need of rescuing, the heroes and villains aren't always what they seem to be, and for once we get a Disney QUEEN who isn't evil.  After years of having to put up with ""princess = good, queen = evil,"" it's really nice to see Disney bucking this trend once and for all.  Hopefully they continue to subvert it...And of course, the songs for this movie are amazing.  Almost all the voice actors do their own singing for this film, which is a refreshing change from the normal system of hiring separate VAs for the speaking and singing parts.  And instead of going for big-name movie actors, this film uses actors with Broadway musical experience, such as Kristin Bell (best known from ""Veronica Mars,"" though she got her start on Broadway), Idina Menzel (best known from ""Wicked,"") Santino Fontana (best known from ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella""), and Josh Gad (best known from ""The Book of Mormon"").  The songs are written by veteran Broadway duo Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez (""Avenue Q"" and ""The Book of Mormon"") and the orchestra score by Christopher Becke (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""The Muppets"").  And the phenomenal singing and songwriting talent for the film pay off, with some of the catchiest and most heartfelt songs yet for a Disney musical.  After seeing more modern Disney films eschew songs for the most part, it's been wonderful seeing a return to the full-on animated musicals of the past.And the snowman sidekick?  Yes, he's a little annoying.  But he's actually very sweet as well and doesn't detract from the movie.  And despite what the previews say, he doesn't even show up until about the halfway mark and doesn't hog the screen time.While my favorite movie of 2013 is still ""Pacific Rim,"" ""Frozen"" is an extremely close second.  It's the perfect blend of great animation, great story, and great music, and is a new Disney classic in my mind.  Recommended for ages 8 and up due to some scary scenes.",5,Phenomenal music and a non-typical story make this Disney classic stand out,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,5071,"['have', 'admit', 'being',

If you really really really want to, you can read into this movie a LGBT push. I'm a Christian and theological-thinker, and I can see themes of &#34;don't hide who you are,&#34; and &#34;Let it go, be who you want to be,&#34; and a surprising twist-ending that would only push that agenda... But you REALLY have to read into that. As I've said to other people that I felt like there was a subliminal LGBT message they were blown away and had to be explained my reasoning... SO... I say all that to say that the odds are that you or your kids wouldn't feel that vibe. I'm just a strong thinker.So you can be wound up and worried that your kids are being fed subliminal messages, but apparently the disney movies of the 90s like Lion King and the Rescuers and Little Mermaid had hidden sexual imagery and I turned out fine. So instead of worrying, be transported back to the 60s when you watched Disney's Robin Hood, and enjoy their latest blockbuster... complete with memorable songs, a fairy tale of old that has persisted for a reason for generations... and good-one liners.. .and of course the comedic supporting character of Olaf who doesn't have a skull.. or any bones, for that matter... and wants to know what a snowman does in the summer.",5,It's an Old-Fashioned Disney Movie,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",2014,1649,"['timeless', 'tale', 'memorable', 'characters', 'memorable', 'songs', 'surprising', 'twist', 'formula', 'Disney', 'used', 'generations', 'seemed', 'have', 'dropped', 'turn', 'millennium', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'had', 'dropped', 'formula', 'would', 'continue', 'work.What', 'like', 'felt', 'was', 'bygone', 'age', 'where', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'blatantly', 'feed', 'political', 'agenda', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'want', 'can', 'read', 'movie', 'LGBT', 'push', ""'m"", 'Christian', 'theological-thinker', 'can', 'see', 'themes', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'who', 'are', '34', '34', 'Let', 'go', 'be', 'who', 'want', 'be', '34', 'surprising', 'twist-ending', 'would', 'only', 'push', 'agenda', 'REALLY', 'have', 'read', ""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'people', 'felt', 'was', 'subliminal', 'LGBT', 'message', 'were', 'blown', 'away', 'had', 'be', 'explained', 'reasoning', 'say', 'say', 'odds', 'are', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'vibe', ""'m"", 'just', 'strong', 'thinker.So', 'can', 'be', 'wound', 'up', 'worried', 'kids', 'are', 'being', 'fed', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'apparently', 'disney', 'movies', '90s', 'Lion', 'King', 'Rescuers', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'had', 'hidden', 'sexual', 'imagery', 'turned', 'out', 'fine', 'So', 'instead', 'worrying', 'be', 'transported', 'back', '60s', 'when', 'watched', 'Disney', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'enjoy', 'latest', 'blockbuster', 'complete', 'memorable', 'songs', 'fairy', 'tale', 'old', 'persisted', 'reason', 'generations', 'good-one', 'liners..', '.and', 'course', 'comedic', 'supporting', 'character', 'Olaf', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'skull..', 'bones', 'matter', 'know', 'what', 'snowman', 'summer']",N/A

Gordon,"[1, 1]","A charming and great looking loose adaptation of Hans Christian Anderson's &#34;The Snow Queen&#34; this animated gem from Disney has a lot going for it; catchy songs that are strong in both music and lyrics, terrific voice acting (I like that they bucked the trend of jamming in the most famous names they could in favor of actors who sound perfect as the characters), actually surprising plot twists, some real emotion, some witty humor, some dark and scary moments that don't pull all their punches, and most of all some really beautiful images using snow and ice.Jennifer Lee is, surprisingly, the first woman to (co) direct an animated feature for Disney, so it may be not for nothing that the film has a likable 'girl power' attitude, where the princesses take no back seat to the male characters in bravery or in action.The story involves two sisters, the eldest of whom has magical powers that can turn things to ice or snow, control the weather, and even, if used wrong, be deadly. So after an accidental near miss with her adored younger sibling, the two are kept separate, and grow up with decidedly different personalities. The film then jumps forward to the day of the eldest's coronation as queen. This brings joy to the younger, extroverted and lonely sister, as the palace will finally be opened, and she can see the world (and maybe fall in love), but dread to her older sister who fears not being able to control her powers, and being discovered as some sort of (unwilling) sorceress. Of course things do go awry, leading to all kinds of adventure and miss-adventure. There are the inevitable clich&eacute;'s here and there, and a few bits seem stolen from other animated films, but these are very minor problems in a film that I thoroughly enjoyed, even though I'm many times older than the intended audience.",5,"Charming, funny, clever, with a solid score and some real emotions",1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,1828,"['charming', 'great', 'looking', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson', '34', 'Snow', 'Queen', '34', 'animated', 'gem', 'Disney', 'lot', 'going', 'catchy', 'songs', 'are', 'strong', 'music', 'lyrics', 'terrific', 'voice', 'acting', 'like', 'bucked', 'trend', 'jamming', 'most', 'famous', 'names', 'could', 'favor', 'actors', 'who', 'sound', 'perfect', 'characters', 'actually', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'real', 'emotion', 'witty', 'humor', 'dark', 'scary', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'most', 'really', 'beautiful', 'images', 'using', 'snow', 'ice.Jennifer', 'Lee', 'surprisingly', 'first', 'woman', 'co', 'direct', 'animated', 'feature', 'Disney', 'may', 'be', 'not', 'nothing', 'film', 'likable', ""'girl"", 'power', 'attitude', 'where', 'princesses', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'male', 'characters', 'bravery', 'action.The', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'eldest', 'whom', 'magical', 'powers', 'can', 'turn', 'things', 'ice', 'snow', 'control', 'weather', 'even', 'used', 'wrong', 'be', 'deadly', 'So', 'accidental', 'miss', 'adored', 'younger', 'sibling', 'two', 'are', 'kept', 'separate', 'grow', 'up', 'decidedly', 'different', 'personalities', 'film', 'then', 'forward', 'day', 'eldest', 'coronation', 'queen', 'joy', 'younger', 'extroverted', 'lonely', 'sister', 'palace', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'opened', 'can', 'see', 'world', 'maybe', 'fall', 'love', 'dread', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'control', 'powers', 'being', 'discovered', 'sort', 'unwilling', 'sorceress', 'course', 'things', 'do', 'go', 'awry', 'leading', 'kinds', 'adventure', 'miss-adventure', 'are', 'inevitable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'here', 'there', 'few', 'bits', 'seem', 'stolen', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'problems', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'even', ""'m"", 'many', 'times', 'older', 'intended', 'audience']",N/A

So I did, and it wasn't as good as people make it out to be. I don't love it, and I actually wouldn't really care to watch it again. I love Disney so it's weird that I don't much care for this one. I was even told that if you liked Rapunzel, that you would definitely love Frozen. But I don't. (And I still think the talking snowman is weird character to devise up.) Even if it isn't in Hans Christian Anderson's version, I REALLY wish Disney would have told some kind of story as to how/why Elsa had these strange powers to make ice and snow. What I did find really great, though, is that the whole movie is set up like a musical. There was a song or two though, like Olaf's, that really didn't feel it belonged though. I am not the first to point this out. The singing voices of the sisters are beautiful and the songs really enjoyable. If I had seen this in theaters, I would not have bought this.

1674955,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B00FZM8Z7I,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[94, 123]","Disney's is back with a slightly more fun animated feature and heartfelt spin on an old Hans Christian Anderson story called ""The Snow Queen"" which was first published in 1945. The original story is a darker version compared to what Disney is presenting you (as always loosely based), but it is considered one of the most acclaimed of all his Fairy Tale story's. Certainly the longest in length and the most illustrated of Anderson's works. It's called ""FROZEN""This film features a wonderfully and positively adapted screen story by Chris Buck ( Surf's Up, Pocahontas), Jennifer Lee (Wreck-It-Ralph) and Shane Morris (The Dukes of Hazard: The Beginning) and then turned into an adapted screenplay by Jennifer, yet the film is impressively directed by both Chris and Jennifer themselves.The story is about two sisters who end up losing their parents and living alone as the only heirs to a kingdom. One sister is special (in a very private way) and the other just fun loving, trusting, and adventurous and truly loves her big sister so very much. That is, until the big sister has to shut all of the kingdoms doors for what she believes is a very good reason. Enter a semi-interested Prince from another Kingdom and a rough `Ice Breaker' with a feisty Reindeer as a companion and you have a really fun, heartwarming and colorful adventure. Did I mention there is a magically hysterical snowman too?The younger sister is Anna who is perfectly voiced and sung by Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars, Parks & Recreation) and her older sister (who is The Snow Queen she discovers later) is impressively voiced and sung by Idena Menzel (Glee, Enchanted). Their acting talents provide the perfect combination of what sisters can be really like. Now add an obnoxious Duke who wants nothing more than to overrun these two sisters kingdom who is voiced by Alan Tudyk (Firefly, Wreck-It-Ralph) and a foreign Prince named Hans who is voiced by Santino Fontana (Submissions Only, Royal Pains),  who has his own agenda of a sort and you have a wonderfully well thought out film with some scary and very happy moments.Now you always need a hero and I won't spoil who the actual hero is in this film, but banded with a series of well caricatured trolls, an ice selling character named Kristoff voiced and sung by artistically Jonathan Groff (Glee, The Good Wife), a wonderfully creative snowman named Olaf perfected voiced by Josh Gad (21, The Internship) and a reindeer named Sven with a slight attitude and you have some wildly wintery fun all through the movie.With music by Christopher Beck (Pitch Perfect, The Internship) and lyrics by Kristine Anderson-Lopez (Winnie the Pooh) and Robert Lopez (Avenue Q, Winnie the Pooh) there is a wonderful Broadway-style showstopper-type song sung by Idena called ""Let It Go"" that will amaze you. She sings it as she realizes her choices and destiny never matched and as she transforms into The Snow Queen, the art and colors will overwhelm you. Especially her dress!Another fun song comes from Olaf called ""In the Summer"" which will have you laughing out loud because Olaf dreams of sunning on the beach. (Remember he's a snowman.) The puns and fun lyrics continue in many of the memorable songs including the two sisters beautiful duet ""For The First Time In Forever"" and the Prince and Anna's comical song ""Love Is An Open Door"".The production and artistic design in this film is amazing and magically brought to the screen by designer Michael Giaimo (Pocahontas, Christmas Is Here Again) while the entire color scheme and overall visual effects were perfect orchestrated by Steve Goldberg (Tangled, Fanatasia 2000).This film has a much more real story and drama dealing with the two sisters and it is sprinkled with some very funny humor throughout. A great family film for the season and much more engaging than Disney's ""Brave"" several years back. With the music thrown in with great care like Disney's more popular and entertaining ""The Princess and the Frog"", ""FROZEN"" is sure to be a family favorite as it teaches everyone what a true loving sacrifice is all about.

Suffice to say if you have kids under 16 then you've probably heard the song &#34;Let It Go&#34; enough times to have a family sing-a-long. In this case, you know that you're going to own this movie sooner or later (and I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the price to come down).All that really matters is this--should you buy this lovely 2-disc set or rent it? I strongly recommend the former. Between the Blu-ray, DVD and HD digital, you're covered on all bases. Be assured that your family will eventually rent this thing 3 or 4 times--so rental isn't all that cost-effective.What about purchasing the digital HD download from Amazon? I firmly believe that this set is a better deal. Give or take a couple of bucks, the price is identical. Since the digital download come FREE with this set, it simply makes more sense to have the Blu-ray option.I sat down with the family (again) and decided to view the Amazon HD version on my very nice Vizio Smart Apps TV. In my opinion, it is not quite as good as the Blu-ray. The resolution suffered at moments while watching the digital--and I'm working with a 45meg/second download router!In conclusion, I can see no reason to choose the pricy download when you can have the whole enchilada for a buck or two more.

However, don't let the packaging fool you: the ""Making Of"" feature on here is NOTHING. Literally, it's a three minute song and dance number that leads you to believe they will take you behind the scenes of how the film was made, only to then have the cast and crew tell you ""We don't know"" at the end. And that's it. Aside from music videos and a few deleted scenes (which are nothing more than animatics) there's little else on here that big fans will be interested in.I think the film's okay; not nearly worthy of the massive hype but far from terrible. It does what it does well and families have embraced it, which is nice. My main gripe is Disney listing this as a major bonus feature and suckering people into buying a version that tells you nothing about how the film was made.

Circumstances lept me out of the theater, but I pre-ordered the Blu-ray and DVD set from Amazon and watched it when it arrived at my home.  The set itself is exactly waht you would expect. . . a nice case with a couple of discs inside.  The movie has many of hte hallmarks of a typiucal Disney animated film (I won't spoil the plot here), but I didn't find it to be as moving or poigniant as many have been in the past.  All I will say about the plot is that it seems to pick up on three or four common Disney themes (sacrifice for the common good, sibling bonds, ugly duckling love interests where the &#34;rough around the edges&#34; guy turns out to be &#34;the one&#34;), but it doesn't really break any new ground.The setting is excellent, and the attention to detail in things like clothing, the animations of snow and ice and the aurora borealis make the move really visually stunning at times.  The characters range from serious to goofy and there are a good number of puns and gags that made me laugh.  The music was also a little disappointing.  The excellent song &#34;Let It Go&#34; is featured prominently, but the rest of the songs carry much less intesity and seem to disappear by the midway point of the film.  The second half has far fewer songs.  I doubt that many people will find themselves humming other songs from the film after a couple of viewings.Overall, I think four stars is fair based on my view of the excellent technical merit of the animation, which is hampered to some extent by a plot that seemed thin and not overly original and musical content that relies too much on one stand-out song to carry through an entire feature.",4,"A solid Disney movie, but not spectacular",1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,1748,"['When', 'heard', 'hype', 'Frozen', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Circumstances', 'theater', 'pre-ordered', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'set', 'Amazon', 'watched', 'when', 'arrived', 'home', 'set', 'exactly', 'waht', 'would', 'expect', 'nice', 'case', 'couple', 'discs', 'inside', 'movie', 'many', 'hte', 'hallmarks', 'typiucal', 'Disney', 'animated', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'plot', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'moving', 'poigniant', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'will', 'say', 'plot', 'pick', 'up', 'three', 'four', 'common', 'Disney', 'themes', 'sacrifice', 'common', 'good', 'sibling', 'bonds', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'love', 'interests', 'where', '34', 'rough', 'edges', '34', 'guy', 'out', 'be', '34', 'one', '34', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'new', 'ground.The', 'setting', 'excellent', 'attention', 'detail', 'things', 'clothing', 'animations', 'snow', 'ice', 'aurora', 'borealis', 'make', 'move', 'really', 'visually', 'stunning', 'times', 'characters', 'range', 'serious', 'goofy', 'are', 'good', 'number', 'puns', 'gags', 'made', 'laugh', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'disappointing', 'excellent', 'song', '34', 'Let', 'Go', '34', 'featured', 'prominently', 'rest', 'songs', 'carry', 'much', 'less', 'intesity', 'seem', 'disappear', 'midway', 'point', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'far', 'fewer', 'songs', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'humming', 'other', 'songs', 'film', 'couple', 'viewings.Overall', 'think', 'four', 'stars', 'fair', 'based', 'view', 'excellent', 'technical', 'merit', 'animation', 'hampered', 'extent', 'plot', 'seemed', 'thin', 'not', 'overly', 'original', 'musical', 'content', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'stand-out', 'song', 'carry', 'entire', 'feature']",N/A

In fact it is a completely different tale, about two princesses, Elsa, the wise but sad elder sister and Anna, the impulsive, merry but a little bit foolish (at least initially) younger one. The sisters love one another dearly, but early in their childhood dire circumstances (and a REALLY stupid advice) erected a wall between them - and in fact also a wall between Elsa and all the rest of the world... And the day this wall unavoidably collapses, well, Elsa will &#34;let it go&#34; - and all hell will break lose! I will say here nothing more about the story.My 12 year old daughter simply adored this film. My 4 year old daughter liked it too, although she didn't exactly understand the story, but she was quite happy with the snowman Olaf (lots of giggling), the OTHER snowman who was not Olaf (lots of pretending to be afraid), the reindeer Sven (&#34;daddy can I have a reindeer?&#34;), the carrots (an important element of the film), the songs and the beautiful images.Me, I was absolutely impressed by the visual aspect of this film, the clever dialogs and this INREDIBLE &#34;Let it go!&#34; song, which is I believe the best musical cinema moment I had since &#34;The circle of life&#34; in &#34;Lion King&#34;. And also I was absolutely impressed with the character of Elsa - we can clearly see there a John Lasseter's touch in the scenario, a little bit similar to the &#34;corrected image of typical Disney princess&#34; he already offered us in &#34;Brave&#34; and &#34;Tangled&#34;.This film teaches us many things, including two crucially important warnings for parents:- if you have a child with issues, do not take advice from a troll! Or at least get also a second opinion!- if you have one child with issues AND therefore also a vulneable sibling, BOTH of you should not take stupid risks, because those children need at least one of you to live and be there for them!The ending is may be just a little bit weaker than one could expect, but after all it is a film for kids and it was appropriate for the young public. Still, this is a minor point and honestly, if &#34;Frozen&#34; doesn't win the Oscar for Best Animated Film and &#34;Let it go!&#34; doesn't take the Oscar for best original song, it will mean there is no justice in this world...This is a great film, to watch absolutely on the big screen, as long as it still plays in theatres - and later, I advise to buy this one on Blu-ray, because here the quality of picture is REALLY important and every pixel counts.

The only females with lines were the sisters. Yeah, I know, they are the principals. But as soon as that quota was filled the script went back to Everybody That Matters Is a Guy.  Guy reindeer. Guy that runs the trading post/sauna. Guy good snow creature. Guy bad snow creature. King, not Queen, gets the lines.

Nice balance of songs to dialogue, and songs that really advance the plot. Great development of relationship between Kristof and Anna. Nice complicated personality in Elsa. Nice turncoat of initial hero.  Wonderful gay moments in the sauna, when the owner waves to his family.The plot is as thin as an onion skin, and owes very little to the Snow Queen referenced in the credits.

1675065,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00FZM8Z7I,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 9]","If you know the Disney tropes by now, you know what to expect: girl suffers tragedy, boy overcomes great odds to rescue her, boy and girl get married, the end.  That's exactly what &#34;Frozen&#34; expects you to think, and it cleverly plays against every standard trope to upend our expectations about what true love is all about.  In this case, it's sisterly love.In the kingdom of Arendelle, Elsa (Idina Menzel) the elder has Ice Man-like powers to create snow.  Her sister Anna (Kristen Bell) thinks this is the best thing ever and encourages her to make snowmen in the palace ballroom, including a little guy who &#34;likes warm hugs&#34; named Olaf (Josh Gad). An accidental use of her powers nearly kills Anna, which causes Elsa's parents to lock her away and forbid contact with the outside world.  Shortly thereafter, the king and queen are lost at sea, leaving Elsa to come out of her shell on coronation day.The rush of new experiences is too much for the sisters.  For Elsa, her powers (tied to her emotions) are unleashed in a big way, creating an unending winter and causing her to flee into the mountains.  For Anna, she falls instantly in love with the first prince she meets, Hans (Santino Fontana) and plans to wed.  It's all very fairy tale standard...and then Frozen takes an unexpected turn when Anna, not Hans, decides to go after her sister.  This is a tale in which the women are firmly in control.Along the way, Anna meets Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven.  Kristoff mostly just stays out of Anna's way, all the while acting as a foil to explain how marrying the first guy she meets is pretty much the dumbest thing he's ever heard. It's a gentle attack on decades of Disney lore, but it's about time.  The finale revolves around a lifesaving act of true love -- but it's not what you think.&#34;Frozen's&#34; special effects are gorgeous, particularly the snow and ice crystals in 3D. The character designs are distinctly reminiscent of &#34;Sleeping Beauty,&#34; an intentional parallel to show how different the characters are from their archetypes.

1675080,AIFRJS0H0AA3A,B00FZM8Z7I,Mikhail Kamenskiy,"[4, 5]","I think that Frozen is a great animated movie, well in line with the visual and storytelling style that Disney has been experimenting with at least since Tangled. I have seen several negative reviews here on Amazon.com and, while they have a point, I'd like to point out that your perception of Frozen and, ultimately, whether you love it or hate it will depend a lot on your initial expectations. Many websites that review Frozen or have a description of the cartoon state that this animated cartoon is &#34;(loosely) based on H.C.Andersen's &#34;The Snow Queen&#34;&#34;. This is not really so, the correct way to put it would be that the story is inspired by the Snow Queen, not based on it. If you watch Frozen expecting to see a more or less faithful animated version of &#34;The Snow Queen&#34; as written by Hans Christian Andersen, you'll be sorely disappointed (and this is where the cartoon gets a good deal of flak from when it comes to negative reviews). This is a different, original story, set in a different place and written with different characters in mind (so, there is no Kai, Gerda, or even the Snow Queen as you know her from Andersen's story). There are only a few parallels here to the original Snow Queen, the most obvious one being the fact that one of the main characters, Elsa, has snow-based magical powers. However, neither Elsa nor Anna, nor the other characters in Frozen were the participants of the original Andersen's story, and the plot line was certainly drastically different from what we see in Frozen. As such, like I said, watching Frozen and expecting The Snow Queen is a wrong idea and it will only lead to disappointment. However, in its own right Frozen is a wonderful cartoon - with an interesting plot line and character interactions, with some interesting and funny twists on such &#34;canon elements&#34; of many fairy tales as &#34;true love's kiss&#34; and &#34;marrying the man you just met&#34; (&#34;Enchanted&#34;, anyone?). The characters are beautifully modeled in the style that resembles &#34;Tangled&#34; the most (out of all cartoons) - some models, I believe, might have been reused in a modified way, such as the horse(s), but that's not a bad thing in my opinion. Frozen is one of the most musical cartoons I've ever seen, I think it has more songs than Tangled used to have (at least that was my impression). And I have to say, the songs are stunningly beautiful and performed with operatic techniques that many operettas and musicals benefit from on a regular basis. In the best Disney style, Frozen is both touching and humorous at the same time, and overall a lot of fun to watch. Definitely worth watching in movie theaters while it's still there and then buying on DVD/Bluray! So, to sum it up, a great Disney movie, definitely among my top favorites from the current-gen Disney animated work along with &#34;Tangled&#34; and &#34;Wreck-it Ralph&#34;. Just make sure you watch it as a separate, original story in itself, and you shouldn't be disappointed as long as you like Disney's work of late in general!",5,A lovely masterpiece if understood correctly,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,3078,"['think', 'Frozen', 'great', 'animated', 'movie', 'well', 'line', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'style', 'Disney', 'been', 'experimenting', 'least', 'Tangled', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'have', 'point', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'perception', 'Frozen', 'ultimately', 'love', 'hate', 'will', 'depend', 'lot', 'initial', 'expectations', 'Many', 'websites', 'review', 'Frozen', 'have', 'description', 'cartoon', 'state', 'animated', 'cartoon', '34', 'loosely', 'based', 'H.C.Andersen', '34', 'Snow', 'Queen', '34', '34', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'correct', 'way', 'put', 'would', 'be', 'story', 'inspired', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'not', 'based', 'watch', 'Frozen', 'expecting', 'see', 'more', 'less', 'faithful', 'animated', 'version', '34', 'Snow', 'Queen', '34', 'written', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'where', 'cartoon', 'good', 'deal', 'flak', 'when', 'negative', 'reviews', 'different', 'original', 'story', 'set', 'different', 'place', 'written', 'different', 'characters', 'mind', 'so', 'Kai', 'Gerda', 'even', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'know', 'Andersen', 'story', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'parallels', 'here', 'original', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'most', 'obvious', 'one', 'being', 'fact', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Elsa', 'snow-based', 'magical', 'powers', 'However', 'Elsa', 'Anna', 'other', 'characters', 'Frozen', 'were', 'participants', 'original', 'Andersen', 'story', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'certainly', 'drastically', 'different', 'what', 'see', 'Frozen', 'such', 'said', 'watching', 'Frozen', 'expecting', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'wrong', 'idea', 'will', 'only', 'lead', 'disappointment', 'However', 'own', 'right', 'Frozen', 'wonderful', 'cartoon', 'interesting', 'plot', 'line', 'character', 'interactions', 'interesting', 'funny', 'twists', 'such', '34', 'canon', 'elements', '34', 'many', 'fairy', 'tales', '34', 'true', 'love', 'kiss', '34', '34', 'marrying', 'man', 'just', 'met', '34', '34', 'Enchanted', '34', 'anyone', 'characters', 'are', 'beautifully', 'modeled', 'style', '34', 'Tangled', '34', 'most', 'cartoons', 'models', 'believe', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'reused', 'modified', 'way', 'such', 'horse', 's', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'opinion', 'Frozen', 'one', 'most', 'musical', 'cartoons', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'think', 'more', 'songs', 'Tangled', 'used', 'have', 'least', 'was', 'impression', 'have', 'say', 'songs', 'are', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'performed', 'operatic', 'techniques', 'many', 'operettas', 'musicals', 'benefit', 'regular', 'basis', 'best', 'Disney', 'style', 'Frozen', 'touching', 'humorous', 'same', 'time', 'overall', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'theaters', 'still', 'then', 'buying', 'DVD/Bluray', 'So', 'sum', 'up', 'great', 'Disney', 'movie', 'definitely', 'top', 'favorites', 'current-gen', 'Disney', 'animated', 'work', '34', 'Tangled', '34', '34', 'Wreck-it', 'Ralph', '34', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'separate', 'original', 'story', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'as', 'long', 'Disney', 'work', 'late', 'general']",N/A

1675091,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B00FZM8Z7I,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","Frozen, in my opinion, is probably the best Disney animated movie not made by Pixar to come out since the Lion King.  The Lion King was the peak of Disney animation.  After that Disney animated films were on the decline and Pixar took over for a while.  However, that could be about to change.  If Disney continues to put out movies as good as or better than Frozen then we may have another Disney golden age.Frozen is the story of two sisters Anna and Elsa.  Elsa has the ability to create ice and snow, but she cannot control it.  Her parents end up locking her away from all human contact until she can control it.  She eventually becomes queen and finally opens the gates to the public again.  She freaks out at the party and accidently uses her ability which terrifies the crowd.  She runs away and decides to live in isolation in the icy mountains.  It is then up to her sister Anna to bring her back.Frozen is the story of the Ice Queen but told from a different angle.  When you think of the ice queen you think that she is the villain.  However, in Frozen she is not evil but more misunderstood, which I did not expect.  This story could be really fun or feel really forced.  Fortunately this movie was extremely fun, well-paced, well-acted, and well animated.  The characters are really fun and relatable.Most of the songs were also good.  One of the things I love about this film is that it is a Disney animated film not a Pixar film.  Frozen is a Disney 2D animated film in 3D animation.  While in 3D animation this film is not a comedy like most of them are.  It has much humor in it, but it places focus on the story and the dramatic moments more than humor.  Plus it is a musical like the old Disney films, which is a welcome change.  I also like how they make fun of past Disney tropes like a prince and princess falling in love instantly without getting to know one another.There are some issues I have with the film, though most are minor.  Firstly, I kind of wish this was done in 2D animation.  I do not dislike 3D animation, but I do like the 2D style of animation more.  Plus, I am so used to pure Disney animated movies like this in 2D that seeing one in 3D did not entirely click with me.  Another is the songs.  The songs are good (like I said earlier) but I do not find them really memorable.  Many of the big 2D Disney films had at least one memorable song that stuck with you forever.  Lion King and Beauty and the Beast had a ton like Be Our Guest, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, etc.  Little Mermaid had songs like Under The Sea, Pocahontas has Colors of The Wind, Oliver and Company had Why Should I Worry?, etc.  I do not find the songs in Frozen as memorable those.  I actually think the story could have worked just as well without songs.Another problem I have is with the villain.  The problem is that they reveal who the main villain is in the third act.  To be honest it really comes out of nowhere.  Not to mention the villain is very bland.  I have seen this villain in many Disney films and even films in general.  I get what they were going for with the reveal but I still did not really care for it and thought it was too out of left field.Overall, Frozen is Disney&#8217;s best films in a while.  It is fun and funny when it wants to be and dark and serious when it needs to be.  The characters (save one) are all likable and fun to watch.  The effects were amazing and very well done.  I do have some gripes but they&#8217;re really just nitpicks.  I recommend going to see this and I highly recommend taking your kids to see this.",5,Best Disney Animated Film Since The Lion King (not counting Pixar films)!,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,3573,"['Frozen', 'opinion', 'probably', 'best', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movie', 'not', 'made', 'Pixar', 'come', 'out', 'Lion', 'King', 'Lion', 'King', 'was', 'peak', 'Disney', 'animation', 'Disney', 'animated', 'films', 'were', 'decline', 'Pixar', 'took', 'over', 'while', 'However', 'could', 'be', 'change', 'Disney', 'put', 'out', 'movies', 'as', 'good', 'better', 'Frozen', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'Disney', 'golden', 'age.Frozen', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'Anna', 'Elsa', 'Elsa', 'ability', 'create', 'ice', 'snow', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'parents', 'end', 'up', 'locking', 'away', 'human', 'contact', 'can', 'control', 'eventually', 'queen', 'finally', 'gates', 'public', 'again', 'out', 'party', 'accidently', 'ability', 'crowd', 'away', 'live', 'isolation', 'icy', 'then', 'up', 'sister', 'Anna', 'bring', 'back.Frozen', 'story', 'Ice', 'Queen', 'told', 'different', 'angle', 'When', 'think', 'ice', 'queen', 'think', 'villain', 'However', 'Frozen', 'not', 'evil', 'more', 'misunderstood', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'fun', 'feel', 'really', 'forced', 'Fortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'fun', 'well-paced', 'well-acted', 'well', 'animated', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'fun', 'relatable.Most', 'songs', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'One', 'things', 'love', 'film', 'Disney', 'animated', 'film', 'not', 'Pixar', 'film', 'Frozen', 'Disney', '2D', 'animated', 'film', '3D', 'animation', '3D', 'animation', 'film', 'not', 'comedy', 'most', 'are', 'much', 'humor', 'focus', 'story', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'more', 'humor', 'musical', 'old', 'Disney', 'films', 'welcome', 'change', 'also', 'like', 'how', 'make', 'fun', 'past', 'Disney', 'tropes', 'prince', 'princess', 'falling', 'love', 'instantly', 'getting', 'know', 'one', 'are', 'issues', 'have', 'film', 'most', 'are', 'minor', 'Firstly', 'kind', 'wish', 'was', 'done', '2D', 'animation', 'do', 'not', 'dislike', '3D', 'animation', 'do', '2D', 'style', 'animation', 'more', 'am', 'so', 'used', 'pure', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movies', '2D', 'seeing', 'one', '3D', 'did', 'not', 'entirely', 'click', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'said', 'earlier', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'really', 'memorable', 'Many', 'big', '2D', 'Disney', 'films', 'had', 'least', 'one', 'memorable', 'song', 'stuck', 'forever', 'Lion', 'King', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'had', 'ton', 'Be', 'Guest', 'Circle', 'Life', 'Be', 'Prepared', 'etc', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'had', 'songs', 'Sea', 'Pocahontas', 'Colors', 'Wind', 'Oliver', 'Company', 'had', 'Why', 'Should', 'Worry', 'etc', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'songs', 'Frozen', 'memorable', 'actually', 'think', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'songs.Another', 'problem', 'have', 'villain', 'problem', 'reveal', 'who', 'main', 'villain', 'third', 'act', 'be', 'honest', 'really', 'nowhere', 'Not', 'mention', 'villain', 'very', 'bland', 'have', 'seen', 'villain', 'many', 'Disney', 'films', 'even', 'films', 'general', 'get', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'reveal', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'left', 'field.Overall', 'Frozen', 'Disney', '8217', 'best', 'films', 'while', 'fun', 'funny', 'when', 'be', 'dark', 'serious', 'when', 'be', 'characters', 'save', 'one', 'are', 'likable', 'fun', 'watch', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'do', 'have', 'gripes', '8217', 're', 'really', 'just', 'nitpicks', 'recommend', 'going', 'see', 'highly', 'recommend', 'taking', 'kids', 'see']",N/A

1675094,AU1ROWBIOKX7X,B00FZM8Z7I,M. Leister,"[2, 3]","To be flat out honest, I am not a fan of computer animation.  Gorgeous scenery, but I find the characters lack humanity in their bizarre faces that all look the same (this is with any movie).  Once Anna&#8217;s hair went white, if not for her dress, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell her apart from Elsa because of that sameness.  I spent half the film pondering why, in profile, they gave both Elsa and Anna mile long ski jumps for noses and the other half wondering why such a half-assed script made it to the screen.The poor writing begins right off.  We meet Kristoff and Sven way before the other characters as if we are going to follow them on the adventure, maybe have him meet and befriend the royal sisters.  Nope, he vanishes until later in the film.  Yes, the baby reindeer was adorable, but we really could have met them along with Anna at the store.  Why were they the first people we met?Elsa&#8217;s powers, the driving force of the film, are never explained beyond that she was born with them.  Rather than have the trolls are the inexplicable experts on her power, why not have it that they gifted to or cursed this power on the royal family centuries ago, and it turns up willy-nilly?  Until Elsa hurts Anna, no one is freaked out about her power and no one seemed to be trying to hide it.  Surely the servants in a palace would have noticed something, and the parents knew she was born with it, so the whole &#8220;people will fear you&#8221; aspect is kind of lame because it wasn&#8217;t a secret and clearly no one was scared of Elsa until Anna was hurt.  Bringing me to the part that makes the least sense out of the muddled mess of a screen play.Anna was hurt by ACCIDENT.  Elsa, trying to keep her sister from falling while they played, had bad aim and hit Anna with the frost.  She didn&#8217;t get upset and lose control, up until then she seemed very in control of her abilities (no fear about using them for fun).  Obviously she touched things every day and they didn&#8217;t freeze since the gloves came after the accident.  So teaching her not to feel and cover up to control her power makes no sense at all since that wasn&#8217;t what caused Anna&#8217;s injury.  What would have made sense with the rest of the film was if the sisters got into an argument (a petty fight about a toy) and Elsa&#8217;s power went wild resulting in the injury.Oosp the parents are dead without us seeing Elsa trying to learn how to control what she has, coming to term with her future as a queen or bristling under parental insistence that she hide her gift.  For the Let it Go song to really pack a punch, we should see Elsa showing some anger at having to bottle it up at her parent&#8217;s behest, not unleashing something she seemed to live in fear of.  We&#8217;re told through the song that she&#8217;s full of turmoil, but we aren&#8217;t shown it.  It&#8217;s a movie, I want to see it, not be told it.  Really, for me, they should have focused on not just the secret of the power coming between the sister (and why couldn&#8217;t Anna be told about it again once she forgot it?), but also on the &#8220;heir and the spare&#8221; situation.  Elsa didn&#8217;t just have to control her power, as future queen she had to be more mature and staid, causing envy of a care free sister, who might feel superfluous and loved less by their parents since she didn&#8217;t know they were with Elsa to deal with her power not just because she was their heir.Because I didn&#8217;t see Elsa&#8217;s isolation or fight to stay in control, I found her unsympathetic and selfish.  She shut her sister out and vowed to continue locking up the palace, ensuring Anna&#8217;s continued misery.  Largely Anna seemed goofy to me, but I felt bad for her because her sister wrecked her life.  Considering it seemed like Elsa didn&#8217;t give Anna another thought after hurting her and then their parents&#8217; death, good riddance should have been Anna&#8217;s motto when Elsa left, not guilt that she finally stood up to her.  Again, proper development would have explained why Anna had no fear of Elsa after the ball icing and thought she could talk her into coming home.  What made a girl who couldn&#8217;t talk her sister out of her room think she could talk her into returning when their bond seemed faintly lingering on Anna&#8217;s side and gone on Elsa&#8217;s?Olaf&#8217;s plight, the snowman who wants summer, was a plot point at best.  We don&#8217;t see how he came to life and he has little time to bond with Anna.  Couldn&#8217;t we have seen lonely young Anna talking to her inanimate snowman pal earlier in the film?  Couldn&#8217;t Elsa have made herself a frosty friend who knew she was lonely and who joined up with Anna to help his friend the ice queen?I felt Hans as the villain was an afterthought.  They needed one so they took a guy who seemed pretty genuine and made him a schmuck.  It came off as bad writing rather than a shocking twist.  Given the congenial expression on his fact on the packaging, I really think they got halfway through animating it, decided to make Elsa good and chucked Hans under the bus or sled if you will.  It would explain why Elsa wasn&#8217;t given more scenes to make her sympathetic as well.The film had good bones, but no flesh to it.  I understand why Disney was caught off guard by its success (there is little merchandise in the parks) because they knew the script wasn&#8217;t there.  A little kid would like the film, but unlike the fairytales of the 1990s, this one is not meant for an adult who can see the plot holes a mile away.",3,"Bad script, pretty scenery",1403740800,"06 26,

Yes, folks, the trailer is a completely made-up scene that is not in the movie at all (thank goodness).  Clearly someone didn't believe in what they had, which is a magical, visually stunning work.Of course, perhaps part of the reason is that this is not simply a kiddie Disney cartoon.

There are no kid-singable songs in this film - in fact it opens with a chorale arrangement which is so NOT Disney (in a very good way).  Many of the songs are complicated duets.The story has been explained in many other reviews, so I won't bother re-describing it here.  It's simple and sweet with a not-obvious ending.  The visuals are among Disney's best ever. It's rather amusing to watch trailers for re-issues of Sleeping Beauty, and compare what could be done with animation then and now!Frozen is a movie that anyone of any age can enjoy - so ignore the trailer and prepare for a sensory feast!",5,Don't be deceived by the trailer!,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,1305,"['am', 'so', 'glad', 'paid', 'attention', 'number', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'movie', 'one', 'Disney', 'best', 'years', 'loved', 'Tangled', ""'ll"", 'love', 'Frozen', 'One', 'WHY', 'Disney', 'chose', 'promote', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'trailer', 'snowman', 'reindeer', 'ice', 'way', 'DOES', 'NOT', 'EVEN', 'APPEAR', 'IN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'Yes', 'folks', 'trailer', 'completely', 'made-up', 'scene', 'not', 'movie', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Clearly', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'had', 'magical', 'visually', 'stunning', 'work.Of', 'course', 'perhaps', 'part', 'reason', 'not', 'simply', 'kiddie', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'hey', ""'re"", 'adults', 'love', 'Tinkerbell', 'series', 'too', 'are', 'kid-singable', 'songs', 'film', 'fact', 'chorale', 'arrangement', 'so', 'NOT', 'Disney', 'very', 'good', 'way', 'Many', 'songs', 'are', 'complicated', 'duets.The', 'story', 'been', 'explained', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 're-describing', 'here', 'simple', 'sweet', 'not-obvious', 'ending', 'visuals', 'are', 'Disney', 'best', 'ever', 'rather', 'amusing', 'watch', 'trailers', 're-issues', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'compare', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'animation', 'then', 'now', 'Frozen', 'movie', 'anyone', 'age', 'can', 'enjoy', 'so', 'trailer', 'prepare', 'sensory', 'feast']",N/A
1675103,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00FZM8Z7I,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","I was one of those parents who didn't mind taking my kids to the movies as long as they were the animated kind.  Mom usually took them to the G-rated ""live action"" films that I abhorred.  Those days are behind me now, but I still appreciate a good animated film, albeit usually in the comfort of my home.  In the most recent Disney modernization (John Lassiter influenced?), add ""Frozen"" to the list of well-done films.Loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen,"" a pair of young princesses are heirs to the kingdom.  The older sister, Elsa (Idina Menzel) is afflicted/gifted with the ability to freeze objects and create bone-chilling cold.  She often has a hard time controlling it.  Her parents decide to hide her away from people to protect the kingdom from errant freezing.  The younger girl, Anna (Kristen Bell), doesn't understand why she can no longer play with her sister, after an accident put her in physical harm.The accidental death of the girl's parents puts Elsa on the throne.  At the coronation ceremony, Anna meets a young prince, Hans (Santino Fontana) from another land.  She falls instantly in love and they quickly decide to get married, much to the chagrin of the new Queen.  During a heated argument, Elsa's anger lights up her frozen finger placing the entire countryside in a state of winter.  Hey, it's summer!  With the townsfolk up in arms, Elsa retreats deep into the snowy realm and builds her own ice castle high in the mountains.Anna decides to go after her and coax her back to take her throne and unfreeze the kingdom.  Along the way she meets up with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), a handsome woodsman who sells ice.  He's a little rough around the edges but agrees to guide Anna up the mountain.  He is assisted by his trusted steed, who's actually a moose, and a funny one at that.  A childhood snowman (just go with it) called Olaf (Josh Gad) provides additional comic relief.  How Anna is going to resolve her obvious attraction to Kristoff with Hans back at the castle had me scratching my head.  But let's give the filmmakers credit.  There's a surprising resolution.Before getting there however, the story becomes exciting as the meeting between Elsa and Anna doesn't go as planned and as a result, Anna health is again threatened with a ""frozen"" heart.  The film has a heart in the end and has a healthy resolution.  While this film isn't laced with adult inside jokes like many others, it is a wonderful film for boys and girls and is highly recommended.The Blu ray transfer is spectacular.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.25:1 aspect ratio.  The detail is superb finding freckles, fur and furrows equally clear.  The colors range from beautiful blues, purples and startlingly bright whites and silver.  I saw no technical flaws either.  Perfecto.  The audio comes with an excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  It is demo grade.  The film uses all of the channels with the surrounds and subs in constant play.  The Oscar winning soundtrack plays beautifully.  And I will also admit I'm finding appreciation for the Oscar winning song, ""Let it Go."" It is beautifully sung by Menzel and fits the scene perfectly.  Extras include a short piece on the transition from Andersen's story to the film, a 3 minute making of segment, some deleted scenes, a trailer, a short called ""Get a Horse"" and some music videos.

1675114,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B00FZM8Z7I,Moon Donkey,"[49, 359]","Another example of the current lack of imagination at Disney.This film suffers from an inherent flaw.  There is no clear central protagonist and, therefore, no clear hero quest.  Rather, we have two sisters, Elsa and Anna.  Which is the main character?  Whose quest are we on?  Sometimes it seems like Anna.  At other times, Elsa.Why does Elsa need to hide her powers from Anna?  This doesn't make any sense.  When they are children, Elsa hits Anna in the head and the cold is sucked out of her head by a stupid looking troll (really... this is the best troll Disney could come up with?).  The troll also says that she will forget everything about Elsa's powers, or needs to forget, or some such nonsense.  As they grow older, Elsa then locks herself away and her powers are hidden from Elsa.  So I repeat... why?  Anna sees Elsa's powers eventually, right?  Does it hurt anything?  No.  There is really no reason why Anna couldn't be aware of Elsa's powers.  Elsa, and her parents, just decide for some reason that it needs to stay hidden.  Ok fine, but it doesn't make any sense.I was actually willing to give this movie a partial pass until the stupid snowman appeared.  One minute Anna and the elk boy are running around in the woods... the next minute out pops the dumbest looking character I've ever seen in a cartoon.  Ask yourself this question - when did it become a necessity to put stupid comic-relief characters into kids' movies?  Huh?  Have we become so stupid as a society that we need to throw a moronic jester character into every film?  Did ""older"" films have these characters?  Heck no, because they are ridiculous and stupid.  Is this snowman supposed to be Frozen's version of Shrek's donkey or something?  It looks stupid, talks stupid, and acts stupid... expect that donkey is sometimes funny.  The snowman is just stupid all the time.As I often do, I try to imagine the meeting a Disney when they came up with this idiot.  Who was the tool at the conference table that decided the film didn't work unless they inject an annoying snowman with buck teeth?  Who were the other tools that thought ""Yeah!  That's a great idea!""  I mean really.... Why wouldn't you take an attempt to make a ""classic"" Disney type film and treat it like watching the Simpsons over beers on Friday night at the trailer park?Also, the trolls were particularly ill-conceived.  Ask yourself another simple question - wouldn't the film be better if the trolls were more like the Ents from Lord of the Rings?  Wouldn't this film carry more weight, and be more meaningful if the trolls were old and wise?  Wouldn't you have more respect for the trolls and the majesty of nature if the trolls were... well... like traditional trolls?  What possible advantage is there to making them look like stupid little round fools?  What advantage is there to giving them silly little voices?  None.  I can't think of a single thing.Also, was the stupid dance/song routine the trolls did in order to get the elk boy and Anna to marry each other really necessary?  It struck me as just a lame song and dance for the sake of having a song and dance.  Hey look!  We are stupid looking trolls and we sing funny songs!  Weeeeeee!  Pass the popcorn!If you want a referendum on the decline modern civilization, look no further than old Disney films versus new Disney films.  Compare a classic like Snow White and Cinderella to this pile of crap.  Which was better, the Dwarves in Snow White or the Trolls in Frozen?  Consider the difference.  100 years from now, people will still recognize the Dwarves and sing ""Hi Ho, Hi Ho.""  Can the same be said of the trolls in Frozen?  Well... you know the answer to that don't you...UPDATE 2/28/14Since my original review I have watched Frozen 7 more times.  My conclusion is this - the snowman was not original to the film.  The snowman was added in after the fact.Yes, you may think I'm crazy but read this post and then go watch the film again.I suspect that the film wrapped production and was reviewed by corporate executives... maybe even some kid focus groups.  Coming out of that process, I believe that the suits at Disney thought it was too serious... maybe even too adult in some of its themes.  They needed to lighten it up.  The comic relief was actually the reindeer, but they needed more... so the snowman was invented and added after the fact.I'm sure you are scratching your head, but go back and watch the film.  The snowman doesn't even appear until half-way through the film.  Also pay very close attention to how the snowman is used in scenes and how he appears in scenes.  Notice how he is rarely part of the action.  Notice how he is separate and off to the side.  Notice how the characters don't acknowledge his existence even if they are on scene together.For example, I'll point out two scenes with Anna.  In one, they are meeting the trolls with Elk boy. Elk boy is talking to the rocks and we see Anna and Olaf watching him off to the side.  Olaf is saying that Elk boy is crazy and that she should run while she can.  Question - does Anna do anything that would indicate Olaf is actually there?  Does she speak to Olaf?  No.  Does she motion in any way to Olaf?  No.  Does she even look at Olaf?  No.  If Olaf wasn't there at all, the scene would still play out exactly the same... it is like he was added in later.Is Olaf part of the song and dance routine with the trolls?  No.Also, take the scene near the end when Anna jumps out of the castle window and rolls down the snow bank.  Olaf follows her.  Again - does she acknowledge his existence?  No.  Does she help him up out of the snow?  No.  Does he help her?  No.  Does she look at him?  No.  She slides down the snow, jumps up, and takes off as if Olaf isn't even there.  Does Olaf add anything to this scene?  No.  Would the action be the same regardless of his existence?  Yes.  Hmmmm... it is like Olaf was digitally edited in after the fact...Also, watch closely how Disney manages the dialogue when Olaf is speaking.  Notice how often we see Olaf is a cut scene... just Olaf himself saying something... before the picture cuts back to the other characters.  An easy way for Disney to edit in dialogue without having to place Olaf in the same shot.Now of course there are a few scenes that include Olaf as an integral part.  The scene in the Castle with Anna by the fireplace is one.  The scene when they meet Olaf in the forest is another.  My theory is that these scenes were created after the fact and added in to replace other content for the final product.If you have seen the original Star Wars remakes by George Lucas, Olaf follows the same pattern.  Lucas went back and added a bunch of junk into the original films.  Just extra stuff placed on top of existing scenes.  In a few instances, like when Han Solo meets Jaba the Hut in the 1st movie, Lucas added in a scene.  I think Disney did the same with Olaf.  They took a film that had a serious side and added Olaf later in order to make is more lighthearted.Maybe I'm wrong, but that would be the first time ever.",1,The snowman is stupid,1391126400,"01 31,

Truth is, the previews didn't really speak to me and actually made me want to wait until it came out on DVD. I caved nonetheless and went to see it in theaters and really loved it. Surprisingly enough my fiance loved it even more than I did. I guess he could identify with Kristoff's character. Some of the songs/singing took some getting use to but they're actually pretty good. I love a good fairy tale typically as much as any girl. It's always nice when characters live happily ever after, especially after overcoming adversity. However, as someone who grew up on these movies I think it's great for children to be exposed to real-life concepts while still preserving their sense of innocence. Kristoff's open honesty and sarcasm brings a touch of reality to the movie while still preserving all of it's whimsical charm. Similarly, Tiana's (The Frog Princess) concept of working hard and meeting dreams half way is a great concept. You can't just wish for things, you have to work for them. You can't really know a person that you've only met once. I welcome this change and think this movie is a wonderful addition to other loved Disney movies.

The plot developed nicely, character development good, imagery was good too.One thing I have to say is that when you rent an amazon movie (2-3 day or whatever) they give you a timer so you know how many hours is left on the subscription. If you START the movie before the timer is up you get to FINISH the movie. They do not cut you off when the timer goes off.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this out. We watched Frozen 4 times during our 3 day rental period and the last time we started it with 20 mins left on the timer. We DiD get to watch the whole movie start to finish on this last run also.

Their Tinkerbell movies, Sofia the first, and now Frozen I consider some of the best and most refreshing to watch with kids. This is without including even the always excellent Pixar movies. Good lessons, meaningful character development, great attention to detail. John Lasseter undoubtedly is one of the reasons for this move towards such high quality movies that make you feel good. I respect his vision.To speak of Frozen, you can't help but feel the emotions of Elsa and Anna in your own heart, you share their pain and loss and fear. You share their joy and love. This is the true love found in families (and those you consider family) where you are willing to sacrifice even your life for the sake of those you love.I enjoyed for once a princess movie where the girls don't just fall in love immediately and ""live happily ever after"". Reality could not be farther from the truth and it is nice to finally see a movie (esp a disney princess one) acknowledge that.I enjoyed a movie where the princess is not generically saved by the handsome prince.I enjoyed a movie where the music and songs flowed together well with the plot and movie. I especially like the use of duets between Elsa and Anna.I enjoyed Olaf. Even though he was a goofball, you couldn't help but like him.I enjoyed seeing what I believe is the first left-handed princess. I realized this when Anna threw the snowball at the marshmallow snowman.It is disappointing that Elsa is the most popular among girls when Anna showed all the true princess traits such as perseverance, love, determination, bravery, etc... Elsa can make cool ice and snow things though...I really enjoyed seeing this explode on youtube like no other movie I can recall. Every song can be found in almost every single language. Each is beautiful to listen to and a refreshing example of how global our world is now.---------------Overall a wonderful movie.

The animation is spectacular and there are a few good songs, especially ""Let It Go"" and ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"".  Kristen Bell does a fantastic job of voicing Anna (I had no idea she could sing as well as she does) and Idina Menzel was great as Elsa.

1675242,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00FZM8Z7I,Ranny Levy,"[7, 8]","I loved this film. It takes the classic tale by Hans Christian Anderson and updates it with state-of-the-art 3D animation that truly is magnificent. The ice castle created by Elsa, aka The Snow Queen, is an elaborate form of imagery that exudes elegance. The tale takes a creative leap from the original but still centers on the struggle between good and evil and, in the end, we learn how love overcomes the most dire circumstances. There are some scenes which may be too frightening to your younger viewers such as the giant snow monster the Queen creates to guard her castle. But, for the most part, this is a tale to be shared with your younger children and even pre-teens will enjoy it - particularly the imagery.Youth comments: I expected the movie to be kind of like &#34;Tangled&#34; with a main plot and a long, long quest. Well... I was almost right. &#34;Frozen&#34; is a great movie the whole family should see! The movie has so much to love - comedy, romance, adventure, suspense, thrillers, fantasy and so, so much more. It also teaches us a valuable lesson of not being afraid to show who we are and put our &#34;powers&#34; to a good use.The fun starts when two young royal sisters get into an accident. One has a magical power to summon ice. The magical girl hits her little sister, Anna. She lives but, has no memory of the magic and does not see her sister for many years. When Anna finally gets to see her sister, it turns into a tragedy.The animation is so adorable and fitting for the actors. They play the voices very well. The two sisters, Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) sound so much alike. The other actors, like Josh Gad do fantastic as well. The film flows very nicely too. The graphics and animation look unbelievably real.My favorite scene is when Elsa (the one with powers) runs away and builds her own ice castle. She is also my favorite character because she tries to protect her sister, but keeps messing up at it. The castle is built very nicely and it shows her true powers of being the &#34;Snow Queen.&#34; I wouldn't mind living in a castle like that myself, if you know what I mean. Since the movie is so kind, bright and educational, I recommend it to ages 4-18 and give it 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST!

The little snowman is adorable and the reindeer is pretty cute too and sometimes acts more like a dog. My favorite part of the movie was when the gifted troubled sister makes a magical ice castle. This of course has a happy ending for everyone.

I am so glad that Disney decided to look back on their library of movies (we all know that Disney not only creates beautiful artistic films, but the soundtrack to these movies are still good enough to listen to years later), and one-upped the other movies.  I don't believe I've seen a better Disney movie than Frozen since The Lion King.  Not only was my granddaughter transfixed to the screen (seriously, I don't think she blinked once while the movie was playing!) but I found myself getting into the storyline.My granddaughter is in the ""Princess"" stage (every girl should believe she's a princess, at least for a little bit).  However, each time she asks to see Cinderella (her favorite Princess), I cringe inside.  Why?  I hate the message.  Only a Prince (man) can save you from all the mean and wicked women of the world??!So glad that Disney showed that true love comes in all forms.  Now for the cons:  it was difficult to emphasize with Elisa, she was so mean to Anna (which caused me to suspect that Elisa was the Queen Grimhilde, Maleficent, Ursula and from Tangled, Mother Gothel... all that because she had issues with almost killing her sister.  Counseling does wonders, Elisa!)  Also, it felt like Elisa was good until she put on a  tight dress with a too high slit and let their hair down... is that what makes a bad girl these days... really?Yes, I recommend this movie.

With the exception of two characters, the Duke of Weselton & Prince Hans, I loved everything about this movie. I loved the remaining characters, especially Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven, the plot of the movie where Elsa has this special power to create ice & snow but she's unable to control it and sets off an eternal winter in the town of Arendelle, the settings of the movie, especially Elsa's ice palace & the town of Arendelle, itself, the soundtrack, especially the songs, ""Let It Go"" (which I have memorized by heart), ""For The First Time In Forever"" & ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"".  I also like, when Elsa's singing ""Let It Go"", she changes from her coronation dress to the beautiful ice dress that she wears for the rest of the movie.  I especially like the message that the movie delivers in that ""An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart"" when Anna sacrifices herself to save Elsa from being killed by Hans and that Elsa realizes that love is how she can control her powers & thaw the city.

1675295,AJ4TG9LNSB0Y4,B00FZM8Z7I,"Robert M. ""Professional Nerd""","[1, 1]","&#8220;Frozen&#8221; is certainly one of my new favorite Disney movies, although that may not be that selective of a group. In my opinion, Disney film animation is at its best when it is doing it&#8217;s best, and that&#8217;s musical fairy tales. Just like they have taken quite a few liberties with the source material before, the same is the case here, with the original Hans Christian Andersen story &#8220;The Snow Queen&#8221; being present in only the barest sense, but that hardly matters at all because this film is a delight from beginning to end.However, this film is not without its own Disney clich&eacute;s either. We have two princesses now, but also cue the dead king and queen. Still, this film does its best to break as many conventional molds as it can. Queen Elsa does not need nor even desire a charming prince to save her. The romance here is reserved for her younger sister Anna, who is adorably nave and hilarious in her own right with her reactions. There is a degree of self-awareness on Disney&#8217;s part in that particular aspect, almost in a self-parodying manner similar to that in &#8220;Enchanted.&#8221; The twist at the end concerning the villain was unexpected enough to legitimately surprise me, and in a good way. It can drag for a bit towards the end, and it overall has a problem depicting the passage of time well, but that doesn&#8217;t take away from the warm experience that &#8220;Frozen&#8221; delivers. The comic relief characters, the animal and the goofball Olaf, were not as annoying as I might have expected from the promotional material; quite the contrary actually. They are both a delight and that little snowman should replace Frosty as the definitive jolly happy soul in a package of human-shaped frozen water.As expected of a Disney film, much of this film&#8217;s charm and success are closely tied the music. In a move that I greatly appreciate and seems to be recurring more with this studio as of late, all of the voice actors also do their own singing. If I recall correctly, both &#8220;Tangled&#8221; and &#8220;The Princess and the Frog&#8221; also did this, but not since &#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; had it been done before that. At any rate, this cast is wonderful. In particular, Kristen Bell has as much innocence and charm to her singing as Jodie Benson and Paige O&#8217;Hara. And, of course, Idina Menzel has proven herself to be in a class all her own. She delivers, in all the best senses of that word, this film&#8217;s killer single &#8220;Let It Go,&#8221; which has become so popular in such a short amount of time, I doubt I need to elaborate much on it. Needless to say, it resonates strongly with anyone who hasn&#8217;t fit in at some point in their lives, which is pretty much everyone, and is now as iconic as &#8220;Under the Sea.&#8221; &#8220;For the First Time in Forever&#8221; also hits several emotional points wonderfully, its own &#8220;Belle&#8221; that&#8217;s fantastic. The first few stanzas of &#8220;Do You Want to Build a Snowman?&#8221; are so overly cute, they will probably give you diabetes. This is not to say, however, that the soundtrack is all hits; there are a couple of misses. Kristoff&#8217;s bit is creepier than it is endearing, the opening song about ice is as forgettable as that sounds, and the trolls&#8217; song towards the end is kind of stupid.Overall, whatever very minor faults this film has doesn&#8217;t detract from the fact that this is a modern instant classic. &#8220;Frozen&#8221; will go down in Disney history has great and as iconic as anything from its Renaissance era or the Golden Age. No one can go wrong with this film, as children and adults of all ages will absolutely adore it as I do. Basically, if you don&#8217;t like this film, it is you who has a cold heart.",5,Wonderful addition to classic Disney canon,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,3812,"['8220', 'Frozen', '8221', 'certainly', 'one', 'new', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'movies', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'selective', 'group', 'opinion', 'Disney', 'film', 'animation', 'best', 'when', 'doing', '8217', 'best', '8217', 'musical', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Just', 'have', 'taken', 'quite', 'few', 'liberties', 'source', 'material', 'same', 'case', 'here', 'original', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'story', '8220', 'Snow', 'Queen', '8221', 'being', 'present', 'only', 'barest', 'sense', 'hardly', 'matters', 'film', 'delight', 'beginning', 'end.However', 'film', 'not', 'own', 'Disney', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'two', 'princesses', 'now', 'also', 'cue', 'dead', 'king', 'queen', 'Still', 'film', 'best', 'break', 'many', 'conventional', 'molds', 'can', 'Queen', 'Elsa', 'not', 'need', 'even', 'desire', 'charming', 'prince', 'save', 'romance', 'here', 'reserved', 'younger', 'sister', 'Anna', 'who', 'adorably', 'nave', 'hilarious', 'own', 'right', 'reactions', 'degree', 'self-awareness', 'Disney', '8217', 's', 'part', 'particular', 'aspect', 'almost', 'self-parodying', 'manner', 'similar', '8220', 'Enchanted.', '8221', 'twist', 'end', 'concerning', 'villain', 'was', 'unexpected', 'enough', 'legitimately', 'surprise', 'good', 'way', 'can', 'drag', 'bit', 'end', 'problem', 'depicting', 'passage', 'time', 'well', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'take', 'away', 'warm', 'experience', '8220', 'Frozen', '8221', 'delivers', 'comic', 'relief', 'characters', 'animal', 'goofball', 'Olaf', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'annoying', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'promotional', 'material', 'contrary', 'actually', 'are', 'delight', 'little', 'snowman', 'should', 'replace', 'Frosty', 'definitive', 'jolly', 'happy', 'soul', 'package', 'human-shaped', 'frozen', 'water.As', 'expected', 'Disney', 'film', 'much', 'film', '8217', 'charm', 'success', 'are', 'closely', 'tied', 'music', 'move', 'greatly', 'appreciate', 'be', 'recurring', 'more', 'studio', 'late', 'voice', 'actors', 'also', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'recall', 'correctly', '8220', 'Tangled', '8221', '8220', 'Princess', 'Frog', '8221', 'also', 'did', 'not', '8220', 'Beauty', 'Beast', '8221', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'rate', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'particular', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'as', 'much', 'innocence', 'charm', 'singing', 'Jodie', 'Benson', 'Paige', 'O', '8217', 'Hara', 'course', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'proven', 'be', 'class', 'own', 'best', 'senses', 'word', 'film', '8217', 'killer', 'single', '8220', 'Let', 'Go', '8221', 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'such', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'doubt', 'need', 'elaborate', 'much', 'Needless', 'say', 'strongly', 'anyone', 'who', '8217', 't', 'fit', 'point', 'lives', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'now', 'as', 'iconic', '8220', 'Sea.', '8221', '8220', 'First', 'Time', 'Forever', '8221', 'also', 'several', 'emotional', 'points', 'wonderfully', 'own', '8220', 'Belle', '8221', '8217', 'fantastic', 'first', 'few', 'stanzas', '8220', 'Do', 'Want', 'Build', 'Snowman', '8221', 'are', 'so', 'overly', 'cute', 'will', 'probably', 'give', 'diabetes', 'not', 'say', 'however', 'soundtrack', 'hits', 'are', 'couple', 'misses', 'Kristoff', '8217', 's', 'bit', 'creepier', 'endearing', 'opening', 'song', 'ice', 'as', 'forgettable', 'trolls', '8217', 'song', 'end', 'kind', 'stupid.Overall', 'very', 'minor', 'faults', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 't', 'detract', 'fact', 'modern', 'instant', 'classic', '8220', 'Frozen', '8221', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'Disney', 'history', 'great', 'as', 'iconic', 'anything', 'Renaissance', 'era', 'Golden', 'Age', 'one', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'children', 'adults', 'ages', 'will', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'do', 'Basically', 'don', '8217', 'film', 'who', 'cold', 'heart']",N/A

I go into watching these in analyst mode, looking for the agenda, and this time it seems to be the &#34;Let it go&#34;-theme of independence, that men are either stupid, manipulative, or Shmoo-like amorphous, idiotic animated snowmen.  And unlike Snow White with 'loves first kiss' this time it's sisterly sacrifice, not the heroic male hero. No, the males are definitely the clumsy idiots of this yarn.

1675302,APRNS6DB68LLV,B00FZM8Z7I,"Rob Slaven ""slavenrm@gmail. com""","[4, 6]","To begin, I went to this movie because my 8-year-old daughter decided she wanted to go 12 minutes before showtime so we dashed in a huge hurry to the movie theatre 11 minutes away and got the Sunday matinee.  Since this movie isn't really targeted to my demographic, I won't really try to make a value judgment so much as state a few random observations.  (Also: No spoilers whatsoever)OK, so the most important reaction is that of my daughter.  Everything I say in paragraphs after this is merely silly adult-talk that matters not one iota.  My 8-year-old was absolutely transfixed.  She bounced in her seat.  She bit her nails.  She gasped audibly.  She raised her hands in triumph.  She was thoroughly and completely sucked in to this.  When asked at the end what she thought she went on at length about the music and one particular character.  As she says after every movie, &#34;This was the best movie ever!!!!&#34;  Also, she's fairly sensitive to violent situations for her age but she was fine in this case.  On the edge of her seat but certainly not under it.Alright, silly adult talk commences.At a plot level this one is a mix of a lot of other Disney movies.  A bit of Beauty and the Beast, some Shrek plus some X-men to mix things up.  There's some grand variety to be sure.  The music in this one wasn't bad but in the first hour or so it seemed we had a 4-minute song about every 5 minutes.  Song quality was wonderful but I thought at points that I was watching a cartoon opera.  In the second half of the movie the vocals settle down to a more reasonable level and we get on with an actual plot.  No single song stands out for me (they were all fairly pop-ish) with the exception of one sung by a group of trolls.  That one is assured to be lodged firmly in my head for a while.  It's musically entertaining and so very, very, very true all at once.  As always, the graphics were jaw-dropping.  Some scenes drew audible gasps and whispers from the audience just from the standpoint of quality of the artwork.  Human characters have become so natural that they're often difficult to distinguish from real actors.My only complaint is the standard one that I make about all such movies.  At the risk of a mild spoiler I will merely say that it bothers me when movies are all wonderful fireworks and bubblegum at the end.  Eventually kids should learn that there is a price to success so it bugs me when absolutely EVERYTHING turns out just wonderfully for EVERYONE involved who's not a terrible villain.In summary, Izzy loved it, I was entertained though very slightly grumpy in exactly the way I'm grumpy about all Hollywood movies.  Take that for what it's worth.  Which is probably everything and nothing in exactly that order.",4,"Cute to be certain, almost an operatic level of singing in the first hour, my 8-year-old was giddy",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,2745,"['begin', 'went', 'movie', '8-year-old', 'daughter', 'decided', 'wanted', 'go', '12', 'minutes', 'showtime', 'dashed', 'huge', 'hurry', 'movie', '11', 'minutes', 'away', 'got', 'Sunday', 'matinee', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'targeted', 'demographic', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'try', 'make', 'value', 'judgment', 'so', 'much', 'state', 'few', 'random', 'observations', 'Also', 'spoilers', 'whatsoever', 'OK', 'most', 'important', 'reaction', 'daughter', 'Everything', 'say', 'paragraphs', 'merely', 'silly', 'adult-talk', 'not', 'one', 'iota', '8-year-old', 'was', 'absolutely', 'transfixed', 'bounced', 'seat', 'bit', 'nails', 'gasped', 'audibly', 'raised', 'hands', 'triumph', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'completely', 'sucked', 'When', 'asked', 'end', 'what', 'thought', 'went', 'length', 'music', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'movie', '34', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', '34', 'Also', 'fairly', 'sensitive', 'violent', 'situations', 'age', 'was', 'fine', 'case', 'edge', 'seat', 'certainly', 'not', 'it.Alright', 'silly', 'adult', 'talk', 'plot', 'level', 'one', 'mix', 'lot', 'other', 'Disney', 'movies', 'bit', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Shrek', 'X-men', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'grand', 'variety', 'be', 'sure', 'music', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'first', 'hour', 'seemed', 'had', '4-minute', 'song', '5', 'minutes', 'Song', 'quality', 'was', 'wonderful', 'thought', 'points', 'was', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'opera', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'vocals', 'settle', 'down', 'more', 'reasonable', 'level', 'get', 'actual', 'plot', 'single', 'song', 'out', 'were', 'fairly', 'pop-ish', 'exception', 'one', 'sung', 'group', 'trolls', 'one', 'assured', 'be', 'lodged', 'firmly', 'head', 'while', 'musically', 'entertaining', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'true', 'once', 'always', 'graphics', 'were', 'jaw-dropping', 'scenes', 'drew', 'audible', 'gasps', 'whispers', 'audience', 'just', 'standpoint', 'quality', 'artwork', 'Human', 'characters', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'natural', ""'re"", 'often', 'difficult', 'distinguish', 'real', 'actors.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'standard', 'one', 'make', 'such', 'movies', 'risk', 'mild', 'spoiler', 'will', 'merely', 'say', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'wonderful', 'fireworks', 'bubblegum', 'end', 'Eventually', 'kids', 'should', 'learn', 'price', 'success', 'when', 'absolutely', 'EVERYTHING', 'out', 'just', 'wonderfully', 'EVERYONE', 'involved', 'who', 'not', 'terrible', 'villain.In', 'summary', 'Izzy', 'loved', 'was', 'entertained', 'very', 'slightly', 'grumpy', 'exactly', 'way', ""'m"", 'grumpy', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Take', 'what', 'worth', 'Which', 'probably', 'everything', 'nothing', 'exactly', 'order']",N/A

Zwick,"[1, 1]","Walt Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Frozen&#8221; takes us back to a time when animated films were literally royal affairs, overflowing with handsome princes and beautiful princesses, magic spells and comical sidekicks, Broadway-style songs and happily-ever-after endings. In this case, it&#8217;s the Princesses who take center stage, and they&#8217;re pretty resourceful and feisty, as befits the modern era.The story, based on &#8220;The Snow Queen&#8221; by Hans Christian Anderson, features Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) as royal sisters, the former of whom has magical powers, the latter of whom does not. The problem is that Elsa&#8216;s use of her power is erratic, to put it mildly, and in an attempt to protect Anna from any possible fallout, Elsa has hidden that power from her little sister for most of their lives. On the day she is crowned Queen of Arendelle, Elsa inadvertently casts a spell on the world, plunging it into eternal winter. It becomes the job of Anna, with the help of some colorful assistants, to get Elsa to un-cast the spell and return normalcy to the world.With screenplay by Jennifer Lee and direction by Lee and Chris Buck, &#8220;Frozen&#8221; isn&#8217;t the most cutting-edge of animated features, particularly in contrast to many of PIXAR better-known offerings, but it has an elegant, classical appeal that makes &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; seem cool again.

The score, by the Lopez duo who brought us some of Book Of Mormon and Avenue Q, is Broadway-ready, with a sensational centerpiece in the gorgeous and thrilling LET IT GO.  As sung by Idina Menzel (yes, Elphaba in the original WICKED), it is a spine-tingling anthem about, well, just being yourself.  Olaf the Snowman offers an adorable jolt of humor that feels organic, and not forced (think Shrek 3).  The 3-D version I saw surrounds you with snow and ice, and had me reaching for my scarf.

Its a great film and a great experience.  Like all Disney films, the story is based on a complete trashing of a classic fairy tale.  In this case &#34;The Snow Queen&#34;.  I hope it inspires people to actually read the classic.A few things stand out from this film vice its contemporaries.The animation is (mostly) superb.  I was impressed with the characterizations in Tangled but this surpasses them.  I've yet to see any better character animation in an animated feature.  Its truly a marvel to watch on that level alone.  The one drawback is the background computer modeling.  Some were definitely created by a team that either had far less talent or was in a big, big hurry to get the production finished.  I doubt most folks will notice it but it stood out to me.  Its not bad enough to take a star away.The music is also top-rate.  &#34;Let it Go&#34; is a terrific sequence, both in storyline and in the song itself.  In fact, I place it at the level of &#34;Under the Sea&#34;, &#34;Be Our Guest&#34;, and &#34;I Just Can't Wait to be King&#34; for animated music hits.  Once you see the sequence, you'll know why.Also, the sound mixing is likely the best I've experienced in a long while.  We watched this with a high-grade 7.2 system (faking the sides) and it was flawless.  Very deep sound placement and the best of levels at the best of times.  Really a remarkable job.My other praise lies in the underlying theme of the film.  Rather than following the classic &#34;save by the prince&#34; mantra, which is contained in the film, the real message is that girls need to be confident in themselves and be who they really are rather than pretend to be something they're expected to be.  I found that to be a very promising message for young girls.

As a jazz fan (and musician) I must admit the music wasn't my &#34;bag&#34; (with the exception of &#34;Avenue Q,&#34; which knocked me out).  To my ears, most popular songs of the past 50 years sounds infinitely inferior to the music of Jerome Kern (&#34;Showboat&#34;), Rodgers and Hammerstein (&#34;Oklahoma&#34;), Gershwin (&#34;Porgy and Bess), Rodgers and Hart (&#34;On Your Toes&#34;), Cole Porter (&#34;Anything Goes&#34;), Bernstein and Sondheim (&#34;West Side Story&#34;)--in terms of structural integrity, melodic inventiveness, lyric wit, and range and depth of emotional expression (perhaps the reason these are the songs that constitute the library that has come to be known as &#34;The Great American Songbook&#34;).In any case, my opinions were rendered meaningless by the profound effect this movie had on my 3-year-old grand-daughter.  Although I didn't observe much of a response from her at the theater (either during or immediately following the movie), a mere 3 months later she's singing every single note, every word of the score of &#34;Frozen&#34; (I couldn't even tell you the name of the composer-lyricist). Granted, in that time she's had a birthday, but I'm no less impressed.  And it's quite apparent that this &#34;blockbuster&#34; out of the Disney studios is having a similar impact on thousands of other children--of all ages.The tunes from &#34;Frozen&#34; and, for that matter, most other recent musicals, don't lend themselves to jazz improvisation, but neither does much operatic music.  Only the passage of time will tell us whether this music will endure like Kern's &#34;All the Things You Are&#34; or Johnny Greene's &#34;Body and Soul&#34; or Harold Arlen's &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; (to name just a few examples of &#34;classic&#34; American tunes that are part of an inarguable &#34;canon&#34; of American popular song).  But I'll be far more hesitant about criticizing it.  And even if it eventually sinks into the oblivion of so much pop emphemera, a musical like &#34;Frozen&#34; leads in a musical direction that's considerably more professional and sophisticated than the folk, rock and country music (mostly by guitar-playing singer-songwriters) that has dominated American popular music since the 1960s.Come to think of it, Menzel exhibited a &#34;Broadway voice&#34; that was not all that unlike Ethel Merman's (minus the vibrato--Ethel was the favorite of the early great composers because of her power and elocution, both essential to Broadway shows before the development of the microphone, which was not even a factor in vocal performances until the late 1920s and the emergence of the creative genius who knew to use it-- Bing Crosby).  Near the beginning of practically any course that I teach--literature, music, and film--I warn my youthful troops (learning is a risky adventure) that they all possess a bias against anything that is perceived as &#34;old,&#34; &#34;past,&#34; &#34;before their time&#34; and that one of their greatest challenges will be to surmount their pre-existing bias in favor of the &#34;modern,&#34; or &#34;contempotrary&#34; for education (which means &#34;moving out&#34; of restrictive confines) to occur.Education is more about covering epochs of &#34;time&#34; (in teaching linguistics, I endeavor to go back some 50 million years!) than vast expanses of &#34;space.&#34;  Traveling--even in outer space--is of great interest and even a potentially transformative experience for some, yet it's extremely limited compared to the traveling in time that is possible only through the study of texts from the past.  In other words, they'd better be prepared to read, and have an open mind to, a lot of &#34;dead white guys&#34; (not excluding some black ones, like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, both of whom produced music that resonates in consciousness with the creative brilliance of a Shakespeare sonnet or a Homeric epic poem).Already, as a teacher-student, I've no doubt alienated myself from not only some of those &#34;present-bound&#34; youth that occupy my classroom but from of the narrow-minded and rigid Americans on the far right who have condemned &#34;Frozen&#34; as a propaganda piece supporting modern &#34;liberal&#34; notions such as women who can overcome formidable obstacles and attain the kind of powerful automony we like to see in our great national leaders.  We're told that such empowerment of women defies all of the patriarchal examples of the past not to mention the teachings of the Bible and other religious texts.  Moreover, we're told that by showing us two women who are capable of loving, above all, each other, &#34;Frozen&#34; is brainwashing our youth into approving of homosexuals if not becoming one!Who would have &#34;thunk it&#34;!!  (I confess these ideas never occurred to me until I bagan reading and hearing reports about the controversy stirred up by this movie, which had initially left me largely indifferent and about $50 poorer).  It occurs to me that we can all &#34;learn&#34; from these alarmists as the vert antithesis of a genuine student, with a mind open to learning.  Rather than learning how to interpret a &#34;text&#34; (literary, film, musical, etc.) they're &#34;hardened idealogues&#34; who have become all too well practiced in their habitual litmus tests (i.e. &#34;witch hunts&#34;).  I encourage them all to take a few classes in &#34;higher learning,&#34; for their own good and the communities they attempt to serve.In the meantime, I'm enjoying my grand-daughter's extended arias-recitatives, lifted from the soundtrack of &#34;Frozen,&#34; and being sung with such joyful abandon and power (&#34;mostly&#34; on pitch) that I can feel my house's foundation moving and witness my cats frozen in trepidation as they cling to their preferred perches in the four-story trees (ordered from Amazon).  It's enough proof for me to conclude my grand-child (who had just recently conquered &#34;the potty&#34;) was, indeed, &#34;liberated,&#34; and at the age of 3!  Who knows where she'll go from here?  I'm simply relieved to know that she won't have limits placed upon her by some perhaps well-intentioned by sadly misinformed hard-liner.  If you wish to learn about music, you might do well to talk to and hang out with a musican. If you want to learn about &#34;morality,&#34; the last person to consult is a &#34;moralist.&#34;",5,"Yes, it can brainwash your child (making this grandfather retire his case)",1397433600,"04 14,

Sadly I was disappointed...While the plot seems pretty straight forward, they kind of try to make unnecessary characters tie into the movie (i.e. The rock... troll.. things?). I also felt the &#34;evil&#34; character in this movie was unnecessary and probably would've been better without this character.Also some of the character introductions (aside from the main girls [Elsa and Anna]) just didn't really tie into the plot, I mean Kristoff is an ice harvester, but they could've just introduced him the first time in the movie to Anna instead of giving him an unnecessary back story aside from what he tells her the first time they meet.Last but not least, the songs.. The songs in this movie are SO BORING, and I mean that in the most honest way possible. As a man who LOVES musicals, these songs were just kind of lackluster for a Disney movie, or any musical feature in general, even &#34;Let It Go&#34; was just kinda boring.The reason I don't hate this movie entirely (personally I give it a 2.5 star rating) was because of Olaf (The Snowman) and Sven (The Reindeer), as well as some of the grown up themes within the movie.

1675363,A3RTR8Q4POQCKW,B00FZM8Z7I,SaveUsMike,"[1, 2]","I love Disney. Working in the Disney Store in Times Square for a brief period as well as owning over 100 Disney movies and attending the parks year round, should tell you that I am a true Disney Groupie . Even if this movie wasn't as good as it turned out to be, I most likely would still have found something &#34;good&#34; about it. But with that being said the movie sure did work on so many levels! I remember the hype around &#34;Tangled&#34; a few years ago with myself often hearing things like &#34;Best Disney flick since Beauty and the Beast&#34; &#34;Best Disney soundtrack in years&#34; etc etc, I distinctly remember watching it and feeling totally underwhelmed. While it was a &#34;good&#34; movie (6.75 out of 10 in my eyes) It nowhere deserved the hype it was getting and it just left me with the thought that maybe I was getting older.Now cut to some years later and I hear the same exact quotes being spun out for Frozen and I immediately suspected I would be disappointed  all over again. I decided to pass up Frozen in theaters and maybe get it down the road but it wasn't something I &#34;Needed&#34; to see. Now cut to months later and my shock and surprise at how much I enjoyed this movie! Like I said above I will keep this spoiler free but I will offer my pros and cons about what worked and didn't with this bound to be classic.Pros- Really good soundtrack. I can't tell you the last time I remember watching a Disney movie and actually hum the songs after! While the soundtrack has some duds (Every Disney movie has a couple!) The majority of the soundtrack was a pure delight and made me want to purchase the CD right after the movie was done.- No evil Parents, Horse riding Princes, or &#34;True loves first kiss&#34; story lines!  What a major surprise I must say (and a pleasant one at that!) How many Disney princess movies have the prince on his horse? Or the Evil Queens, Stepsisters, Aunts, Step mothers? And lastly no matter what the spell True Love can just about break every curse right?! Wrong!!! Frozen almost plays up as a satire of the traditional Disney flick and mocks the fact that it isn't going to Follow the &#34;Disney Tradition&#34;! Elsas comment to her sister about Marrying a prince SHE JUST MET had me loving the movie even at this early early point &#34;You can't marry a man you just met...&#34; This movie although is a Disney Princess film, leaves the realm of check listing and brings a new type of Disney Princess that doesn't need to follow a cliche turn of events to tell a story.-It FEELS like a 1989-1997 Disney Film. As most fans know that was Disney Renaissance. Films like Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast etc where all made during this wonderful Disney Period and became classics we still love and cherish to this day. While Frozen isn't up to the level of ANY of those films, it still feels like something that would have came from that period! I mean that in the most positive of ways. Even though Frozen was made with expensive CGI technology I would have totally loved to have seen this film in traditional Animation and it would have been just as good.Cons- Plot feels rushed. Animated films tend to not have a long run time but even with the unusually long run time of 1 hour and 40 minutes the plot still tends to feel rushed. Towards the last half hour I began to feel like the filmmakers realized the movie needed to end and everything had to be completed as quickly as possible to wrap it all up. While the movie generally flows really well, those moments where I feel like things just came and went too quickly hurt the overall presentation of the film especially when there was plenty of filler moments that where not needed.-The &#34;Love&#34; at the end. l will keep this spoiler free and be as vague as possible. When One of our main characters begins to fall in love towards the end it feels really really out of left field considering everything that has happened thus far in the movie. The love has been hinted too but we literally go from one seen where we feel &#34;Yeah I sorta like you&#34; to a handful of minutes later &#34;I love him!&#34; No these are not direct movie quotes but you get my drift. I can really only attribute this to my above con of the rushed plot. Unfortunately this love is a casualty of the rushed story towards the end and it is really hard to buy into it when its conceived in the final act of the film.Despite the pacing issues Frozen is a film that is destined to be a classic. While I stand by what I said about it not being the greatest Disney movie ever (Plenty are better). It might be the best Disney film in the last 15 years! If you watch this with friends of family, or even yourself, I can guarantee you will enjoy this movie and find at least something that makes you smile.I hope you enjoyed this review and thank You the

The love and concern that the two sisters show for each other is very touching.

I LOVED this film and instantly added the DVD to my wishlist.  Honestly, my favorite movies are The Hunt for the Red October, Galaxy Quest, Pixar's Incredibles, Princess Bride, Ponyo, Sound of Music, and Lord of the Rings Extended Editions.  I gravitate to no particular genre, but only to what I find are the absolute best movies.  Frozen is up there with the best movies I have ever seen. Period.Why is this film so good?1. It teaches real love.  Love is about putting the other person's needs first.  Love is shown in your actions not your words.  I am so floored that a kids movie actually taught this and even took the time to point out you never get engaged or married to a guy you just met.  WOW... a Disney film not about being swept off your feet by a guy in 3 seconds?  Its about time.2. The side kick characters are not annoying.... seriously!!  Its like the difference between Jar Jar Binks and R2D2.  These side kicks are more like R2D2 whereas past Disney sidekicks were like Jar Jar Binks.  These side-kicks from the reindeer to snow monster were done exactly right.  They add humor to the show and dimension without ever getting in the way of the story or you wanting to strangle them.  Way to go Disney!!! Any way you can retroactively edit sidekicks in older films?3.  The plot themes are serious yet with enough humor that it doesn't feel too serious AND without the humor taking away from the story line.  What a great balance to hit just right.  Ok so the story line is a bit simplistic because its a kid movie, but it still has twists and turns.  I did not find the story predictable because I was expecting another one of those princesses falling in love movies.. and this was not typical.  The story teaches important themes like what love really is, the weight of responsibility, how to use power rightly vs. wrongly, and empathy for others.4.  Great music.  The opening song grabs you and whisks you away to another world.  Every song helps you connect more deeply to each character... and pulls you deeper into the story.  I have never felt so much empathy in a musical since Fiddler on the Roof... and I'm not that emotional of a person.So if you have daughters, grandchildren, nieces, or work in childcare... get this movie.  You will be able to watch it over and over without going insane.  The kids will learn what true love really is and what to watch out for in love.... its not what all those other princess movies teach.  So you can rest easy.",5,Unexpected Excellence,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2558,"['went', 'theater', 'expecting', 'usual', 'dumb', 'kids', 'movie', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'LOVED', 'film', 'instantly', 'added', 'DVD', 'wishlist', 'Honestly', 'favorite', 'movies', 'are', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'October', 'Galaxy', 'Quest', 'Pixar', 'Incredibles', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Ponyo', 'Sound', 'Music', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Extended', 'Editions', 'gravitate', 'particular', 'genre', 'only', 'what', 'find', 'are', 'absolute', 'best', 'movies', 'Frozen', 'there', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Period.Why', 'film', 'so', 'good', '1', 'real', 'love', 'Love', 'putting', 'other', 'person', 'needs', 'first', 'Love', 'shown', 'actions', 'not', 'words', 'am', 'so', 'floored', 'kids', 'movie', 'actually', 'taught', 'even', 'took', 'time', 'point', 'out', 'never', 'get', 'engaged', 'married', 'guy', 'just', 'met', 'WOW', 'Disney', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'guy', '3', 'seconds', 'time.2', 'side', 'kick', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'annoying', 'seriously', 'difference', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'R2D2', 'side', 'kicks', 'are', 'more', 'R2D2', 'past', 'Disney', 'sidekicks', 'were', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'side-kicks', 'reindeer', 'snow', 'monster', 'were', 'done', 'exactly', 'right', 'add', 'humor', 'show', 'dimension', 'ever', 'getting', 'way', 'story', 'wanting', 'strangle', 'Way', 'go', 'Disney', 'way', 'can', 'retroactively', 'edit', 'sidekicks', 'older', 'films', '3', 'plot', 'themes', 'are', 'serious', 'yet', 'enough', 'humor', ""n't"", 'feel', 'too', 'serious', 'humor', 'taking', 'away', 'story', 'line', 'What', 'great', 'balance', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'Ok', 'story', 'line', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'kid', 'movie', 'still', 'twists', 'turns', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'story', 'predictable', 'was', 'expecting', 'one', 'princesses', 'falling', 'love', 'movies..', 'was', 'not', 'typical', 'story', 'teaches', 'important', 'themes', 'what', 'love', 'really', 'weight', 'responsibility', 'how', 'use', 'power', 'rightly', 'vs.', 'wrongly', 'empathy', 'others.4', 'Great', 'music', 'opening', 'song', 'grabs', 'whisks', 'away', 'world', 'Every', 'song', 'connect', 'more', 'deeply', 'character', 'pulls', 'deeper', 'story', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'empathy', 'musical', 'Fiddler', 'Roof', ""'m"", 'not', 'emotional', 'person.So', 'have', 'daughters', 'grandchildren', 'nieces', 'work', 'childcare', 'get', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'going', 'insane', 'kids', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'really', 'what', 'watch', 'out', 'love', 'not', 'what', 'other', 'princess', 'movies', 'teach', 'can', 'rest', 'easy']",N/A
1675369,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B00FZM8Z7I,"Scotman's Critic's Corner ""Film & Book Reviewer""","[2, 3]","Frozen[Theatrical Review]As animated features go, Disney is tops.  Unlike the morality tales of Pixar films (which I do love, that&#8217;s no insult on them!), Frozen goes a step back to a more traditional method of storytelling.  Like Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, Frozen takes us through a story of love, of betrayal, and of family.I&#8217;m sure sisters have felt shut out by their fellow siblings.  This film does reflect that.  It also tells us not to rush into anything, like marriage, as that person could really be a wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing.The characters are developed well in this story of two sisters, Elsa (the young and feisty one) and Anna (the magic one, whose powers of ice and snow make her consider herself a freak with a curse).  Their ups & downs in relationships between each other, and the love they have for each other is quite a change from the usual boy-meets-girl-Prince Charming style of Disney films.The music is fresh and original.  The film plays like a musical and most of the themes deal with tackling life head-on and not be dissuaded from your goals and purposes.The story is inspired from Hans Christian Anderson&#8217;s tale of The Snow Queen.The theater version starts with a short, that plays like an old Walt Disney 1940s&#8217; style black & white cartoon, but then morphs into a modern story with plenty of slapstick.  Great start!I really liked the Snow Queen, who hurt her sister and did not want a repeat of that.  But thought protecting her by not revealing herself, she actually hurt her sister emotionally and the younger one was shut out.  I&#8217;m sure kids will relate to this.Bottom Line:  If you love castles, dancing, some comedy relief and some traditional Disney style, look no further than Frozen.  Even Olaf the Snowman was a trip.  The special effects were excellent; the detail down to the fibers of cloth and the features of stone and design were amazing.Highly recommended.Cast:Kristen Bell l  ...

I watched it tonight with my 3 year old daughter.She was captivated by the animation and completely followed the story. So it's not too complex for a toddler.The music is very well done. the songs sounded beautiful. (I will bet large sums of money right now that Disney turns this into a Broadway musical in the next few years.)There is a giant scary snowman in about 5 total minutes of the film that was a little frightening to my 3 year old. So fair warning, you might have to be ready to do a quick 'hide the eyes' move with smaller children.The story was nice. It had a great message of a female character being the happiest in her life when she finally decided to be who she was rather than playing the role that people expected her to be. She has magical powers to control ice and everyone wanted her to hide that about herself. She felt stiffed and trapped her whole life. But when she finally said &#34;Screw it&#34; and lived like she wanted to, she was happy....at least until her ice powered caused a ton of problems and she had to learn responsibility. But that's a great message too.Without spoiling the end for you I was also impressed by the way they used the predictable &#34;act of true love&#34; to save the day. It was a nice twist on this theme. And I'm not spoiling anything by telling you that. It's a Disney princess movie. You know there was going to be something about and act of true love to save the day. It's a running theme.The DVD was underwhelming though. It is not full of special features.

The incredible amount of praise and adoration that it has drawn is truly astounding to me. While the wintertime animation is beautiful and the tone friendly and engaging, and the attempt at subverting some of the more cliched elements of fairy-tale love is well-meaning, this is the most mediocre Disney film that I can recall having seen in a very long time. The story is under-written, the lead characters surprisingly underdeveloped, the music sub-par overall--""Let It Go"" is the standout number, to be sure--and the supporting characters almost exclusively tired, paper-thin cliches. (Including an extremely obnoxious snowman.)All of this is subjective, of course, but while I can understand why people, in particular children, enjoy Frozen, I find it hard to fathom how so many adults feel that it qualifies as ""great."" I much prefer the recent Tangled, to say nothing of past classics like Beauty and the Beast. I am not writing this to be negative or cynical. If one watches this film and feels inspired, then that is wonderful. However, I feel that there are many, many animated films that are far superior almost across the board.

This has been in our DVD player since the day it arrived. She loves it, and so do I. Normally when she's watching a movie, I use that time to pick up around the house. Not with this movie. I get everything done before the movie starts so I can watch it with her.Keep in mind, it's still a Disney story, so there are the signature elements of fairy tales, princesses, and the quest for love. However, the story line is well written, and much more modern for the times. Disney is maturing in their character growth, subject matter, and tone. This is the epitome of an animated musical. The songs are catchy, my daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves to run all over the house singing &#34;Let it go&#34;, and knows the words almost verbatim.Elsa is the oldest sister, born with the power to freeze what she touches. She and Anna were close in their youth, until one day Elsa struck her with her powers while they were playing. Elsa was isolated from Anna by their parents, and Anna never understood why, and has been trying to reconnect with Elsa from that day forward. Three years after their parents pass away (remember, it's Disney), Elsa becomes queen. After her coronation, that's when the true grit of the movie begins.Disney really did  a wonderful job capturing the attention of all ages in this story. I feel for Elsa, while most think she's the villain...but you'll have to watch and find out for yourself. Anna is lonely growing up in the castle without having much contact with her big sister. She can't wait for her sister's coronation because the gates will finally reopen, and she'll have contact with actual people for the first time in years. The character's introduced later, Kristoff, and his reindeer Sven, Prince Hans, Olaf the snowman, the trolls, and the other minor characters that come and go throughout the movie, make this one of the best Disney films I've ever seen. Disney will always have their classics, like Little Mermaid, Cinderella, etc., but this next generation of Disney films seems to be a power house in the making.

I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to the Bluray Combo pack.&#8220;Frozen&#8221; is &#8220;loosely&#8221; based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, but it&#8217;s been brought very much up to date. Yes , there is a villain (actually only one, though the villain &#8211; I won&#8217;t give a spoiler here!- has a some accomplices) but it&#8217;s not who you think it is. And that makes this different from many Disney films. Also the CGI animation is not like Little Mermaid or even Toy Story. It&#8217;s &#8211; well &#8211; different &#8211; with the non-humans having a lot more detail than their human characters. The music is great &#8211; some of the best Disney in recent years and the &#8220;humorous&#8221; supporting characters are downright hilarious! I loved it and I&#8217;m in my 60s.The special features are somewhat space compared with recent Disney BDs but what is here is great! First there is the totally unrelated NEW Mickey Mouse cartoon &#8211; &#8220;Get A Horse&#8221; &#8211; which just won an Oscar. It&#8217;s a wonderful use of black and white and color. It runs about 6 minutes. Next is the &#8220;Making of Frozen&#8221;, which is only 6 minutes long but it&#8217;s hysterical. I can&#8217;t tell you why &#8211; again it&#8217;ll spoil the fun &#8211; but it&#8217;s unlike any other &#8220;Making of&#8221; featurette you&#8217;ve seen on a DVD or BD. There are 6 minutes of Deleted scenes with commentary and another featurette of similar length about how the film compares to the HC Andersen original. Then there are the music videos in about 4 languages (including Malaysian!).  The film itself runs 102 minutes (but the last 7  minutes consists of the credits! &#8211; Lots of folks worked on their PCs on this film!) so there&#8217;s a bit over 2 hours of fine entertainment in the package.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful!Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,"Review of the Bluray combo pack and bonuses - LOTS of fun!

1675446,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00FZM8Z7I,StrangePegs,"[3, 4]","Pixar's loss of John Lasseter's direct involvement in their day-to-day operations hasn't done them any favors (see my reviews of Monsters University and Brave); however, his influence on Disney as a whole looks to be unmistakable. Unmistakably good, at that. Whereas the last couple of Pixar movies have descended to fairly typical Disney fare, Frozen rises towards the kind of film we haven't seen from Pixar since Toy Story 3 (a movie that made me cry, and I don't cry at movies very often). It's not as good as TS3, but it's definitely the best Disney Animation movie in a good long while.In an effort to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the movie is delightful on so many levels. Olaf steals every scene he's in, and my kids loved him. Seriously, my daughter especially has not stopped talking about him, and both of the younger ones have been singing as much of his &#34;puddle&#34; song as they can remember. My daughter, who is less interested in movies than the boys, would have turned right around and seen it again.The animation in the movie was, in a word, incredible, especially the ice and especially especially the ice bridge. The songs are good (and who knew Kristen Bell could sing? Okay, so, well, maybe lots of people, but I didn't know, so I was surprised to see that she had performed her own songs), and, as I've already implied, the song by Olaf was really catchy.The best parts of the movie, however, can't be talked about without being spoilery: You've been warned.The death of the parents at the beginning of the movie is pretty typical for Disney. I'm not quite sure why all of their young heroes have to be orphans of some type, but it's almost always the case. Possibly, for Frozen, it's there to help you feel as if you're in a typical Disney film (I kind of doubt it), but, whatever the reason, you know when the parents are leaving on their trip that they're not coming back. Of course, that's what sets up the problems for the rest of the movie. Elsa has no one to help her cope with her powers and grows up in isolation because of it.One of the best moments is between Anna and Kristoff as he chastises her for attempting to marry someone (Hans) that she had just met that day. It's very amusing, because the immediate True Love thing is so endemic in Disney movies, so it's refreshing to see it handled like this in this movie. In fact, the catalyst of the whole thing is Elsa (now the Queen) refusing to allow the marriage between Anna and Hans because they had only just met. There's even a comment from Kristoff to Anna where he is saying &#34;no&#34; to her about something (no, I don't remember exactly what) because he doesn't trust her judgement. All of this is a nice break from that Disney cliche.And then there's the whole thing with True Love's Kiss that they also turn on its head, and that was great to see, too. And I won't say more than that, because I don't want to give everything away. Let's just say that the movie ended with both Anna and Elsa growing as characters, something that Brave, unfortunately, lacked.At any rate, it's a very enjoyable movie and one that I hope is signaling a new direction for Disney. Disney Princesses are great and all that, but it's good to have some that don't need to get rescued.Also, Alan Tudyk was great. I didn't even realize that was him until I saw his name in the credits.

Pocahontas?) there were also some BIG winners (Beauty and the Beast, Lion King). The merits of various films can be argued left and right, but the point is obvious. Disney Animation went from a juggernaut to a whisper and back again.Then, the post-Katzenberg era saw Disney Animation once again unraveling while their rivals picked up steam, and Steve Jobs moved in to pick up the slack. We saw Universal shamelessly make fun of Disney with Shrek, and Pixar release films like Toy Story. Meanwhile, Disney was putting out laughable features like Brother Bear, Home on the Range, and (shudder) Valiant!Move forward a few years and Disney Animation is desperately trying to suck the mojo out of Pixar and its rivals, and reboot itself. We get Meet the Robinsons (better), Bolt (better still). And then... on November 24, 2010, we got Tangled. A true hybrid of the storytelling of years past (with musical numbers and reworked fairy-tale sensibilities. After that, for better or worse, Disney had found its footing again. Sure, there are still some wild experiments (Wreck-It-Ralph), throwbacks to traditional animation (Winnie the Pooh), and collaborations with Pixar (Brave, Monsters University). But for all intents and purposes, Sleeping Beauty is awake...again...&#34;Would You Like to Build a Snowman?&#34;As anyone who saw the Academy Award Winning &#34;Paperman&#34; can readily verify, someone knocked some Capra back into Disney. Their old movies used to be able to grab you and really tug at your emotions (in a good way). Somewhere along the line that was lost, but it's definitely back here, and that emotional core is what has been sorely missing.You could argue that there's no real plot to this movie, or that it's too predictable and formulaic. But it's about the best aspects of human relationships (family, devotion, sacrifice, love) that makes you care. Within the first half hour or so, there's a song thrown at you that summarizes a relationship, makes you want to laugh, and makes you want to cry, all in the span of a few minutes. I think I knew after that song, I was watching something special.Whatever Snow Does... In Summer....From the trailers I thought this movie would be terrible (Disney needs someone good to take over marketing, and fast). But all the positive talk about this film online got me interested. I came in with an open mind...dreading the Disney comic relief character. And then as the non-talking talking animal (ala Pascal from Tangled) and goofy talking snowman appeared, a funny thing happened. I realized that I liked them. Because while they were definitely comic relief, they had more depth than say...Mushu. And yeah, the snowman's song about summertime is absolutely hilarious.Disney realized some time ago that their classic fairy-tale tropes were being averted, subverted, and even perverted by the competition, they released Enchanted, figuring that if everyone else was making fun of them, they might as well join in. From out of that deconstruction, we got the reconstruction of Tangled and Frozen (heck even the naming of the two is darn similar). What I'm saying is... is Disney going through old territory with a tale of princesses? Yes. Does it know this? Yes it does. And that self-awareness has enabled Disney  to move beyond nativity of a snowman who has never seen anything but winter, and move on the maturity of what the protagonists of Tangled and Frozen have achieved by the end of the film. In other words, there's more to life than love at first sight (for some people at least) and Disney accepts this, and embraces it even.Let It GoOkay, okay. Disney Animation has rebooted itself and learned it's important life lessons and moved on, blah, blah, blah. I want to know if the dang movie is entertaining Mr Reviewer? Is there some of the old Disney Magic with songs that lift the spirit, animated eye candy, and above all-else, an ending that satisfies the child within!? So glad you asked, gentle reader. The answer is...Anyone who enjoyed a High School Musical movie or three knows that Disney knows how to make songs even when it isn't really trying. So when they really pull out all the stops as seen in Tangled and in this film (and embrace Broadway talent to give us the old-fashioned show-tunes magic), it's AWESOME. There's a princess belting out signature song at the top of her lungs, a spritely song of comedic relief, and some lovely duets to be found. The only real mis-step is the background music. I think we've stuck in Tangled territory there too unfortunately (no Hans Zimmer Lion King-style awesomeness to be found). But in a film with so many other things going for it, I can overlook that. I mean...The animation might not quite top the best coming out of Japan these days (I'm starting to wonder just how many swan-songs Miyazaki can have), and for sheer technical achievement Dreamworks is REALLY pushing the envelope (watch the Blu Ray of Kung Fu Panda 2 if you don't believe me), but Disney still does... quite well actually. Sure, there are some moments where things look a bit bland, but overall I'd say we are at the level of tangled, a hybrid of 2D-style and 3D animation, and it WORKS. VERY enjoyable.All that said, there are a few slow parts to the film, a few characters that could be fleshed out a bit more, and a few plot twists that didn't quite work for me. But when I got to the conclusion of this film there were tears in my eyes, and even though I knew it was coming, the resolution of the film was absolutely fantastic. It made me want to see it again.My recommendation? Go see this film in the theater. And after you've had a chance to digest it, go see it again. It's not perfect. But it IS wonderful.

This is a BIG Disney hit.  Elsa and her younger sister Anna are princesses in a Scandinavian country. There is something different about older sister Elsa - she has powers that are not understood - she can turn things to ice.  After an accident, her parents lock her away from her beloved younger sister.  (Spoiler alert) In true Disney fashion, her parents are lost at sea and Elsa is set to become queen.  There are always those who seek power for their own gain and this story runs true to that theme.  In this case there are two handsome men in younger sister Anna's life, not to mention a lovable reindeer, and a singing and dancing snowman named Olaf.  Elsa comes to terms with her &#34;gift&#34; and  determines her own destiny and Anna, not needing a prince to rescue her, ultimately rescues herself...and most of them live happily ever after.There is plenty here to keep all ages interested.  I was amazed that my 3 year old granddaughter was captivated by the entire movie - even to the point of bursting into spontaneous applause (and never asked for a snack food run or bathroom stop once the movie started).  Her Papa, who is not a big fan of cartoons, liked it too.  Idina Menzel provides the voice for Elsa and knocks it out of the park with the theme song &#34;Let It Go&#34; (which I'm pretty sure everyone has heard by now).  All in all - you cannot go wrong with this movie.  I don't think it's my personal favorite overall, but well worth buying and watching (probably more than once).I purchased this two-disc version for my grandchildren so they would have one copy for the car and one for the house.

The only two things I liked of this movie was the story and the villain. But Frozen brought back the old Disney Princesses. The only problem was the two songs &#34;Love is a Open Door&#34; and &#34;In Summer&#34;, I remember when even the goofy songs where wroth singing in the shower or out load. &#34;Under the Sea&#34;, &#34;Be Our Guest&#34;, and &#34;Hakuna Matata&#34; were songs that made sense and were able to sing and not feel weird about sing it. They where well written, well composed, and well thought of. But the &#34;The Frog Prince&#34; and &#34;Tangled&#34; had TOO MANY stupid songs that may no seances and you could not sing to with out being confused. Besides those two songs I like the rest of the movie. The organelle story of The Snow Queen is dark but like Rapunzel it did not make much since.

1675487,AOKYGPVBVBNY3,B00FZM8Z7I,T.,"[1, 1]","This is an awesome movie. The script was very rich and well developed, the animation was amazing, and an un-Disney like ending. The movie focus on two princesses, Elsa and Anna, who are sisters (for those sick of Disney, it's here we go again, the same story). Elsa is born with enormous powers over ice and snow, while the younger is born completely normal. In the beginning, the two sisters are very close, but drift apart after an accident, while playing, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna with her powers. Anna is revived and saved by a troll king, but has no memory of Elsa's power, and Elsa is warned she needs to learn to control her powers, as they will continue to grow and become more powerful as she grows. Their parents soon both die in an enormous storm at sea, and Elsa is coroneted Queen, bringing her out of her shell. During the ceremonies, Anna falls for Hans, a visiting prince. Elsa doesn't approve of the match, and in the resulting argument, Elsa's powers are revealed, and she flees the kingdom. In exile, Elsa uses her powers to the fullest, building herself an ice castle and becoming the Snow Queen. Anna then goes to retrieve her sister and end the winter, teaming up with ice salesman Kristoff, and for the kids, Olaf the snowman. The song I really liked was  &#34;Let it go&#34;, which was sung by Idina Menzel while Elsa is building her ice palace,  perfectly describes Elsa's feelings about her newfound freedom and her powers. &#34;Love is an Open Door&#34; and &#34;Fixer Upper&#34; won't become Disney classics, but they were well choreographed and helped to add to the storyline. Its funny all the way through, the kids and adults will love, and its a departure from the traditional Disney princess, especially with Elsa, who is more regal, reserved, and less adventurous than most of Disney's other princesses. Its more about time and love, rather finding your true love and rushing into marriage like most of Disney's other classics. The only complaint is that, the script should have had more time to be explained. It seemed they were trying to push it into an hour and 30 minutes. Taking 10-20 more minutes (two hour) would have made the movie a whole lot better, but, this will still be a movie that will stand the test of time.",5,Newest Disney Classic,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,2265,"['awesome', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'rich', 'well', 'developed', 'animation', 'was', 'amazing', 'un-Disney', 'ending', 'movie', 'focus', 'two', 'princesses', 'Elsa', 'Anna', 'who', 'are', 'sisters', 'sick', 'Disney', 'here', 'go', 'again', 'same', 'story', 'Elsa', 'born', 'enormous', 'powers', 'ice', 'snow', 'younger', 'born', 'completely', 'normal', 'beginning', 'two', 'sisters', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'apart', 'accident', 'playing', 'Elsa', 'accidentally', 'Anna', 'powers', 'Anna', 'revived', 'saved', 'troll', 'king', 'memory', 'Elsa', 'power', 'Elsa', 'warned', 'learn', 'control', 'powers', 'will', 'continue', 'grow', 'become', 'more', 'powerful', 'parents', 'soon', 'die', 'enormous', 'storm', 'sea', 'Elsa', 'coroneted', 'Queen', 'bringing', 'out', 'shell', 'ceremonies', 'Anna', 'Hans', 'visiting', 'prince', 'Elsa', ""n't"", 'approve', 'match', 'resulting', 'argument', 'Elsa', 'powers', 'are', 'revealed', 'kingdom', 'exile', 'Elsa', 'powers', 'fullest', 'building', 'ice', 'castle', 'becoming', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'Anna', 'then', 'retrieve', 'sister', 'end', 'winter', 'teaming', 'up', 'ice', 'salesman', 'Kristoff', 'kids', 'Olaf', 'snowman', 'song', 'really', 'liked', 'was', '34', 'Let', 'go', '34', 'was', 'sung', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'Elsa', 'building', 'ice', 'palace', 'perfectly', 'Elsa', 'feelings', 'newfound', 'freedom', 'powers', '34', 'Love', 'Open', 'Door', '34', '34', 'Fixer', 'Upper', '34', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'Disney', 'classics', 'were', 'well', 'choreographed', 'helped', 'add', 'storyline', 'funny', 'way', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'love', 'departure', 'traditional', 'Disney', 'princess', 'especially', 'Elsa', 'who', 'more', 'regal', 'reserved', 'less', 'adventurous', 'most', 'Disney', 'other', 'princesses', 'more', 'time', 'love', 'rather', 'finding', 'true', 'love', 'rushing', 'marriage', 'most', 'Disney', 'other', 'classics', 'only', 'complaint', 'script', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'be', 'explained', 'seemed', 'were', 'trying', 'push', 'hour', '30', 'minutes', 'Taking', '10-20', 'more', 'minutes', 'two', 'hour', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'movie', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time']",N/A
1675488,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00FZM8Z7I,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 1]","&#8220;Frozen&#8221; is an animated feature film loosely based on &#8220;The Snow Queen&#8221; by Hans Christian Andersen. In typical Disney manner, the company has tweaked the story and eliminated most of the dark moments. The Disney version is about two princesses. Elsa, the elder sister, has the ability to shoot ice and snow from her hands. As the girls grow up, with plenty of Broadway-caliber songs along the way, Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) comes to realize her magical powers can be a threat to those around her, so she retreats from everyone, including her sister, Princess Anna (Kristen Bell). The metaphor is clear: a person&#8217;s own insecurities can freeze out loved ones. As in the Broadway musical &#8220;Wicked,&#8221; the dynamic that drives the story is the strained relationship between two girls.&#8220;Frozen&#8221; is among the best of Disney&#8217;s recent animated features. It has a powerhouse score by husband-and-wife team Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, including the Academy Award-winning song, &#8220;Let It Go,&#8221; performed by Ms. Menzel. The song sequences are mini-extravaganzas in themselves, but rather than stop the action dead, they move the story forward.The sisters are distinctive and march to their own beat &#8212; a theme that crops up a lot lately in animated films. When Anna meets a handsome mountain man (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer sidekick, she is conflicted by her attraction to this hunky, dashing guy and an at-home love interest, Hans (Santino Fontana). Comic relief is amply supplied by Olaf (Josh Gad), a Chaplin-esque anthropomorphic snowman.The 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains deleted scenes, a Mickey Mouse cartoon, a making-of short, and a featurette showing the adaptation process from original fairy tale to screen.",5,A Homerun for Disney Animation,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,1799,"['8220', 'Frozen', '8221', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', '8220', 'Snow', 'Queen', '8221', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'typical', 'Disney', 'manner', 'company', 'tweaked', 'story', 'eliminated', 'most', 'dark', 'moments', 'Disney', 'version', 'two', 'princesses', 'Elsa', 'elder', 'sister', 'ability', 'shoot', 'ice', 'snow', 'hands', 'girls', 'grow', 'up', 'plenty', 'Broadway-caliber', 'songs', 'way', 'Elsa', 'voice', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'realize', 'magical', 'powers', 'can', 'be', 'threat', 'everyone', 'including', 'sister', 'Princess', 'Anna', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'metaphor', 'clear', 'person', '8217', 'own', 'insecurities', 'can', 'freeze', 'out', 'loved', 'ones', 'Broadway', 'musical', '8220', 'Wicked', '8221', 'dynamic', 'story', 'strained', 'relationship', 'two', 'girls.', '8220', 'Frozen', '8221', 'best', 'Disney', '8217', 'recent', 'animated', 'features', 'powerhouse', 'score', 'husband-and-wife', 'team', 'Robert', 'Kristen', 'Anderson-Lopez', 'including', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'song', '8220', 'Let', 'Go', '8221', 'performed', 'Ms.', 'Menzel', 'song', 'sequences', 'are', 'mini-extravaganzas', 'rather', 'stop', 'action', 'dead', 'move', 'story', 'forward.The', 'sisters', 'are', 'distinctive', 'march', 'own', 'beat', '8212', 'theme', 'up', 'lot', 'lately', 'animated', 'films', 'When', 'Anna', 'handsome', 'mountain', 'man', 'Jonathan', 'Groff', 'reindeer', 'sidekick', 'conflicted', 'attraction', 'hunky', 'dashing', 'guy', 'at-home', 'love', 'interest', 'Hans', 'Santino', 'Fontana', 'Comic', 'relief', 'amply', 'supplied', 'Olaf', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'Chaplin-esque', 'anthropomorphic', 'snowman.The', '2-disc', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'cartoon', 'making-of', 'short', 'featurette', 'showing', 'adaptation', 'process', 'original', 'fairy', 'tale', 'screen']",N/A

When I saw this film for a second time, I heard many people in the theater laughing at his funny moments. Kristoff is enjoyable to, especially when he voices over Sven. Elsa, I have to admit is likable too. She reminds me a lot of Raven from ""Teen Titans""; shutting people out, fearing her powers are dangerous, needing private time, the list goes on. The musical numbers are enjoyable too. Much like ""Lion King"", I don't feel like I have a particular favorite. I just like them each for their own reasons. I WILL say though, ""In Summer"" and ""Fixer Upper"" are the film's funniest songs. I also like how their is true love, but shown in a different way. Sisterly love that we don't see too often in a Disney fairy tale movie.I don't know what else to say other than the fact that I really enjoyed this film.

1675507,A3LDFTSXU3UPBO,B00FZM8Z7I,Tim &#34;Timdiana&#34; Dunn,"[7, 11]","I don't know about you, but I remember a time where Disney reign supreme in the genre of animation.  Classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King; aw, those were day. These days, on the other hand, the animated trend of Disney has died down. Yet, when an animated film does pop up, it can be a treat. That brings us to latest animated Disney feature: Frozen. After the success of Tangled, Frozen would be worked on the 2010 film's creators and be another Disney movie completely CG.  Though Tangled prove Disney Animation could be brought in a different light, how does Frozen fair in Disney's long list of animated classics?The tale of Frozen deals with two princess: Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel). While things have been peaceful in the kingdom Arendelle, there is a secret in the royal family: Elsa has the power to control ice. After a dramatic situation, Elsa's powers go out of control bringing an eternal winter to Arendell. Anna journeys after Elsa with  the mountain man Kristoff (Johnathan Groff), his trusty reindeer Sven and a living snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). Together, the four journey into a wilderness so they can save kingdom as well as Elsa.While there are many classic Disney films, sometimes the films' plot can be repetitive. Frozen, on the other hand, does not fall under such stereotypes. Thanks to the two plots of Anna and Elsa, Frozen's plot was very refreshing. Plus, the pacing of the story was great by making Frozen an adventurous tale that really stood out.With a great story came wonderful characters. It almost hard to decide who was the superior character among the ensemble. Kristen Bell brought a charismatic performance as Anna; while surprising me in other areas. Idina Menzel brought her voice and belting ability as Elsa, who was just a different kind of Disney Princess. I even liked Kristoff and Olaf, and normally can't stand the generic male love interest and comedic relief. On paper, the cast to Frozen didn't look like it was going to work. Yet in the end, this ensemble was hard not to love.To say Frozen's animation was great seems a little redundant seeing that Disney film usually shine in this element; but Frozen has some wonderful animation. What stands out in the animation is the use of the colors and lights. This help thing such as the character stand out from the likes of Tangled's cast. Along with the animation came the music. The score by Christophe Beck was impressive, and even more so was the fact that Frozen was a musical. Speaking of musicals: Frozen has to be the one best Disney musicals in a very long time. The reason why the element work was because the movie treated itself like a Broadway musical. A rare feat, even in Disney films.This is the point where I talked about which scenes stood out me. In the case of Frozen, the moments that stood out to me were the musical numbers. The big songs, ""First Time In Forever"" and ""Let It Go"", were great.""First Time In Forever"" was a fantastic title song giving us great moments between Anna and Elsa; plus the sound was soothing. Then there was Elsa's big song: Let it Go. The song was catchy and just great for the character. I am willing to bet that these songs will be remember in the years to come.If you haven't guessed yet: I liked Frozen. The film was a treat for families and fans of both animation and Disney. With a compelling story, memorable character and  the Broadway atmosphere, Frozen is indeed a hit. This film is not just one of the best of the year, but it is one the best Disney for quite sometime.See review here: [...]",5,A New Disney Classic!,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3595,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'remember', 'time', 'where', 'Disney', 'reign', 'supreme', 'genre', 'animation', 'Classics', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Aladdin', 'Lion', 'King', 'aw', 'were', 'day', 'days', 'other', 'hand', 'animated', 'trend', 'Disney', 'died', 'down', 'when', 'animated', 'film', 'pop', 'up', 'can', 'be', 'treat', 'latest', 'animated', 'Disney', 'feature', 'Frozen', 'success', 'Tangled', 'Frozen', 'would', 'be', 'worked', '2010', 'film', 'creators', 'be', 'Disney', 'movie', 'completely', 'CG', 'Though', 'Tangled', 'prove', 'Disney', 'Animation', 'could', 'be', 'brought', 'different', 'light', 'how', 'Frozen', 'fair', 'Disney', 'long', 'list', 'animated', 'classics', 'tale', 'Frozen', 'deals', 'two', 'princess', 'Anna', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'Elsa', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'peaceful', 'kingdom', 'Arendelle', 'secret', 'royal', 'family', 'Elsa', 'power', 'control', 'ice', 'dramatic', 'situation', 'Elsa', 'powers', 'go', 'control', 'bringing', 'eternal', 'winter', 'Arendell', 'Anna', 'journeys', 'Elsa', 'mountain', 'man', 'Kristoff', 'Johnathan', 'Groff', 'trusty', 'reindeer', 'Sven', 'living', 'snowman', 'named', 'Olaf', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'Together', 'four', 'journey', 'wilderness', 'can', 'save', 'kingdom', 'as', 'well', 'Elsa.While', 'are', 'many', 'classic', 'Disney', 'films', 'sometimes', 'films', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'repetitive', 'Frozen', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'fall', 'such', 'stereotypes', 'Thanks', 'two', 'plots', 'Anna', 'Elsa', 'Frozen', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'refreshing', 'pacing', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'making', 'Frozen', 'adventurous', 'tale', 'really', 'stood', 'out.With', 'great', 'story', 'came', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'almost', 'hard', 'decide', 'who', 'was', 'superior', 'character', 'ensemble', 'Kristen', 'Bell', 'brought', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'Anna', 'surprising', 'other', 'areas', 'Idina', 'Menzel', 'brought', 'voice', 'belting', 'ability', 'Elsa', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'different', 'kind', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'even', 'liked', 'Kristoff', 'Olaf', 'normally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'generic', 'male', 'love', 'interest', 'comedic', 'relief', 'paper', 'cast', 'Frozen', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'going', 'work', 'end', 'ensemble', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'love.To', 'say', 'Frozen', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'little', 'redundant', 'seeing', 'Disney', 'film', 'usually', 'shine', 'element', 'Frozen', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'What', 'out', 'animation', 'use', 'colors', 'lights', 'help', 'thing', 'such', 'character', 'stand', 'out', 'likes', 'Tangled', 'cast', 'animation', 'came', 'music', 'score', 'Christophe', 'Beck', 'was', 'impressive', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'fact', 'Frozen', 'was', 'musical', 'Speaking', 'musicals', 'Frozen', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'Disney', 'musicals', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'reason', 'why', 'element', 'work', 'was', 'movie', 'treated', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'rare', 'feat', 'even', 'Disney', 'films.This', 'point', 'where', 'talked', 'scenes', 'stood', 'out', 'case', 'Frozen', 'moments', 'stood', 'out', 'were', 'musical', 'numbers', 'big', 'songs', 'First', 'Time', 'Forever', 'Let', 'Go', 'were', 'great', 'First', 'Time', 'Forever', 'was', 'fantastic', 'title', 'song', 'giving', 'great', 'moments', 'Anna', 'Elsa', 'sound', 'was', 'soothing', 'Then', 'was', 'Elsa', 'big', 'song', 'Let', 'Go', 'song', 'was', 'catchy', 'just', 'great', 'character', 'am', 'willing', 'bet', 'songs', 'will', 'be', 'remember', 'years', 'come.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'guessed', 'yet', 'liked', 'Frozen', 'film', 'was', 'treat', 'families', 'fans', 'animation', 'Disney', 'compelling', 'story', 'memorable', 'character', 'Broadway', 'atmosphere', 'Frozen', 'indeed', 'hit', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'one', 'best', 'Disney', 'quite', 'sometime.See', 'review', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

Elsa completely pulls away, locking herself away from the world and working to control her powers by suppressing her emotions. Their parents downsize the staff and close the gates to Arendelle to reduce the danger Elsa poses to others. Anna feels abandoned and both girls feel utterly alone. Years later, their parents die in a boating accident, making Elsa the queen of Arendelle. She is forced to open the gates and hold a coronation celebration. The coronation goes well, but her powers are revealed after a heated argument with Anna. She runs away, leaving a wake of ice and snow, making the much needed summer into winter in Arendelle. Anna feels it's her responsibility to make amends with Elsa and convince her to life the supernatural winter.Frozen is a fun film with charming characters and an unexpected ending. Anna and Elsa are both sympathetic characters who feel alienated and alone. I just want to give Elsa a great big hug. She tries her best to contain her powers and her feelings, sacrificing her close relationship with her sister in order to shield her from harm. She is forced to hide a fundamental part of herself in order to appear normal and utterly fails, causing harm to her entire community. I&#34;m glad she wasn't a real villain as in the original story (which is very weird and religious), but a person trying her best and making mistakes. Anna is funny, quirky, and definitely not the poised and graceful Disney princess one might expect. She's very clumsy and embarrassingly blurts out her feelings to random people. She just wants a real relationship with her sister, to be able to make friends, and to have people around instead of cutting themselves off. My favorite character is Olaf, the living snowman who loves warm hugs. He provides perfect comic relief and he's just adorable.Disney films are rather guilty of having two people fall in love rather quickly based on next to nothing and then living happily ever after. It seems as if this film goes in that direction when Anna falls for Prince Hans of the Southern Isles and accepts a proposal within an evening of meeting. When Anna is once again injured by Elsa's magic, her condition is said to be cured by an act of true love, suggesting Hans should save the day. The ending switches things around and Anna is cured because she threw herself in front of Elsa as Hans tried to kill her. The true love in this instance wasn't romantic love, but sisterly love. I really enjoyed this subverting of typical Disney tropes and the story is the best Disney has produced in a while.The music of the film is delightful and another reason for the film's success. The filmmakers opted to hire Broadway composers to create these fun songs of varied styles. Do You Want to Build a Snowman is a cute, but sad song that encompasses Anna and Elsa's relationship after the accident and each of their loneliness and frustration. For the First Time in Forever is a cute song that shows Anna silly and quirky nature and her excitement for human contact and a dash of Elsa's mantra to control her powers. Love is an Open Door is an adorable instalove song between Anna and Hans with more of a rock feel and fun harmonies. In Summer is Olaf's hilarious song about his obsession with summer, but he has no idea what snow does in heat. The song has a nice old Hollywood musical flair and some unexpected lyrics. The best song of the film is Let It Go, Elsa's song of empowerment where she accepts herself despite what others think of her. Idina Menzel belts out the song and gives it the power it needs. The visuals are also amazing as Elsa effortlessly builds an ice castle around herself.The only part of the film I didn't really like was the trolls. They were cute and provided some comedy, but didn't really add much to the story. They could have easily been cut out without anything essential being removed.

The musical animation also won Oscar&#8217;s Best Original Song (with the powerhouse &#8220;Let It Go&#8221;), and its musical sequences alone are worth your time and money. The song is simply unforgettable.Some even think this is &#8220;a new Disney classic&#8221; &#8211; but I really don&#8217;t know. &#8220;Frozen&#8221; has everything that makes it a masterpiece: gorgeous visuals, excellent voice acting, and most of all, interesting heroine Elsa or the &#8220;Snow Queen&#8221; (Idina Menzel), who has to find a way to cope with her magical power. But what about the story? The story is excellent in the first half of the film, with this complicated heroine.The second half is a little less effective, with Elsa&#8217;s sister Anna (Kristen Bell), trying to do something for Elsa now living alone in the Ice Tower. Except that, however, it seems Anna really does not know what she is doing. With two male characters hardly impressive (and an unnecessary comic relief Olaf the snowman), Anna&#8217;s story is much less compelling than Elsa&#8217;s.We need some time to see whether or not the film will survive the test of time to be called a classic by future generations.

1675538,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B00FZM8Z7I,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 0]","The Disney studios have produced some of the most memorable animated films of all time, and &#34;Frozen&#34; ranks right up there as top notch entertainment for the whole family.Although the story is supposed to be inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen tale, &#34;The Snow Queen&#34;, there is practically no resemblance between the two. While the HCA story is dark and somewhat brooding, the Disney movie is all brightness and wonder. They've really created something entirely new and very charming.People have outlined the story in other places, so no spoilers here, rather some things to look for that make the movie first rate.1. The MUSIC!  Disney films often have the best composers and singers available, and &#34;Frozen&#34; sports these in abundance. The songs are charming and delightful, with a varied style that should reach the hearts of everyone, filled with outstanding melodies and lyrics. In addition, the orchestral score for all the sequences is also top of the line music, inspiring, powerful and it helps drive the movie and support the action and the characters. Excellent!2. The Characters. As one might expect from Disney, we get a cast of memorable and endearing characters. They aren't &#34;realistic&#34; as in a real life stage drama. They are, like their animated persona's, idealistic and they present the best (and worst) of human nature and aspirations. They are role models (except for the villains, of course). It is easy to like them and identify with them.3. The Animals. Disney has always had a way with depicting animals that brings out charm and delight. Two notable animal characters are the Reindeer star &#34;Sven&#34; and a lesser character, Prince Hans' horse. Watch these characters carefully for great expression and heartwarming charm.4. Comedy. No Disney movie is complete without a healthy dollop of humor, which &#34;Frozen&#34; has in abundance. While many of the character's lines and interactions are funny, the character of &#34;Olaf&#34; the snowman is a show stealer. He's a delight.5. Happy Ending. While &#34;Frozen&#34; does develop quite a bit of suspense at times, and it seems the problem behind the story is irresolvable, this is a Disney film, so you know it will have a resolution and a happy ending. What is particularly nice is that good does triumph over evil (as would be expected) but the villains are not harmed or killed (as in many earlier Disney films). They are dealt with more gently, and humanely, but they are punished for their crimes, none the less. This is a nice trend I hope we'll see in future movies. Death and vengeance have been used far too long to dispose of &#34;evil&#34;, especially when &#34;evil&#34; is the result of some complex and very human ambitions gone wrong.6. Production values, direction, animation and design. &#34;Frozen&#34; is a &#34;frozen treat&#34; for the eyes! The animation, although CGI, has a 3 dimensional quality even in 2D. The CGI is excellent and rendered with flow and grace. The direction is spot on, moving the story forward while allowing character introspection and development (although, due to running time, this takes place very quickly). The design is typical Disney magic, brilliant colors, great detail and plenty of eye candy.Conclusion:Disney's &#34;Frozen&#34; is a pure delight from start to finish, with just the right pacing and action. While there may be a few scenes that may frighten young kids, overall, it's perfect entertainment for folks of all ages. It is a film that has great re-play value, if for nothing else, the fabulous music and beauty of the work. It took a lot of people and a lot of time to make this movie. The effort paid off. This is a top notch MUST SEE and ENJOY movie.Bravo!",5,BRILLIANT! and MAGICAL!,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,3740,"['Disney', 'studios', 'have', 'produced', 'most', 'memorable', 'animated', 'films', 'time', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'top', 'notch', 'entertainment', 'whole', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspired', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Andersen', 'tale', '34', 'Snow', 'Queen', '34', 'practically', 'resemblance', 'two', 'HCA', 'story', 'dark', 'somewhat', 'brooding', 'Disney', 'movie', 'brightness', 'wonder', ""'ve"", 'really', 'created', 'something', 'entirely', 'new', 'very', 'charming.People', 'have', 'outlined', 'story', 'other', 'places', 'spoilers', 'here', 'rather', 'things', 'look', 'make', 'movie', 'first', 'rate.1', 'MUSIC', 'Disney', 'films', 'often', 'have', 'best', 'composers', 'singers', 'available', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'sports', 'abundance', 'songs', 'are', 'charming', 'delightful', 'varied', 'style', 'should', 'reach', 'hearts', 'everyone', 'filled', 'outstanding', 'melodies', 'lyrics', 'addition', 'orchestral', 'score', 'sequences', 'also', 'top', 'line', 'music', 'inspiring', 'powerful', 'drive', 'movie', 'support', 'action', 'characters', 'Excellent', '2', 'Characters', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Disney', 'get', 'cast', 'memorable', 'endearing', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", '34', 'realistic', '34', 'real', 'life', 'stage', 'drama', 'are', 'animated', 'persona', 'idealistic', 'present', 'best', 'worst', 'human', 'nature', 'aspirations', 'are', 'role', 'models', 'villains', 'course', 'easy', 'like', 'identify', 'them.3', 'Animals', 'Disney', 'always', 'had', 'way', 'depicting', 'animals', 'out', 'charm', 'delight', 'Two', 'notable', 'animal', 'characters', 'are', 'Reindeer', 'star', '34', 'Sven', '34', 'lesser', 'character', 'Prince', 'Hans', 'horse', 'Watch', 'characters', 'carefully', 'great', 'expression', 'heartwarming', 'charm.4', 'Comedy', 'No', 'Disney', 'movie', 'complete', 'healthy', 'dollop', 'humor', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'abundance', 'many', 'character', 'lines', 'interactions', 'are', 'funny', 'character', '34', 'Olaf', '34', 'snowman', 'show', 'stealer', 'delight.5', 'Happy', 'Ending', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'develop', 'quite', 'bit', 'suspense', 'times', 'problem', 'story', 'irresolvable', 'Disney', 'film', 'know', 'will', 'have', 'resolution', 'happy', 'ending', 'What', 'particularly', 'nice', 'good', 'triumph', 'evil', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'villains', 'are', 'not', 'harmed', 'killed', 'many', 'earlier', 'Disney', 'films', 'are', 'dealt', 'more', 'gently', 'humanely', 'are', 'punished', 'crimes', 'none', 'less', 'nice', 'trend', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'see', 'future', 'movies', 'Death', 'vengeance', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'dispose', '34', '34', 'especially', 'when', '34', '34', 'result', 'complex', 'very', 'human', 'ambitions', 'gone', 'wrong.6', 'Production', 'values', 'direction', 'animation', 'design', '34', 'Frozen', '34', '34', 'frozen', 'treat', '34', 'eyes', 'animation', 'CGI', '3', 'dimensional', 'quality', 'even', '2D', 'CGI', 'excellent', 'rendered', 'flow', 'grace', 'direction', 'spot', 'moving', 'story', 'forward', 'allowing', 'character', 'introspection', 'development', 'due', 'running', 'time', 'place', 'very', 'quickly', 'design', 'typical', 'Disney', 'magic', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'great', 'detail', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy.Conclusion', 'Disney', '34', 'Frozen', '34', 'pure', 'delight', 'start', 'finish', 'just', 'right', 'pacing', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'few', 'scenes', 'may', 'frighten', 'young', 'kids', 'overall', 'perfect', 'entertainment', 'folks', 'ages', 'film', 'great', 're-play', 'value', 'nothing', 'else', 'fabulous', 'music', 'beauty', 'work', 'took', 'lot', 'people', 'lot', 'time', 'make', 'movie', 'effort', 'paid', 'off', 'top', 'notch', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'ENJOY', 'movie.Bravo']",N/A
1675539,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00FZM8Z7I,Turfseer,"[18, 136]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Maybe because the critics were desperate for a Christmas time blockbuster that wasn't an action film (like Thor, The Hunger Games, or The Hobbit), that's why this average Disney animated musical, ended up receiving a multitude of accolades. In my view, however, it was overrated; not at all because of the music and special effects, which were quite good, but rather for the weak narrative.'Frozen' is very loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale, 'The Snow Queen' but bears little resemblance to the original classic tale. In the original, the two children were male and female; here there are two sisters of royal stock: eight year old Elsa who is afflicted with magical powers and her perky younger sister, five year old Anna, who live in the kingdom of Annendale (which in part bears a resemblance to a 19th century Norwegian fishing village). When Elsa can't control her powers (which involve turning everything into ice when she points her fingers), she accidentally injures her sister while they are playing. The result is the very awkward scenario of having Elsa locked up in her room until she's crowned queen as a teenager, following the demise of her parents, who are lost at sea during a storm.The demise of the parents is handled quite nicely before we arrive at the big coronation scene but children may find it disturbing that the film's scenarists opt to dispose of the parental figures and leave the two young girls as orphans. There is some stupendous 3D animation throughout the film, especially the interior shots of the palace (dig the Bruegel-like paintings on the wall, for example).The best part of 'Frozen' involves Anna's infatuation with the duplicitous Prince Hans. The whirlwind courtship between the inexperienced Anna and Hans, is undoubtedly meant as a cautionary tale for young women who are too easily taken in by good looks and facile words fashioned to manipulate, as opposed to proposals infused with sincerity. Elsa, on the other hand, sees through her sister's inexperience and refuses to give her blessing (as well as permission) for Anna to wed Hans, after a few hours of superficial courtship.Unfortunately, the rest of 'Frozen' is downhill. Anna strikes out on her own to try and find her sister the Queen, who's fled because again she is unable to control her own magical powers. Anna is aided by good guy 'Kristoff' the ice dealer and his trusty reindeer, Sven, and wouldn't you know it, Anna falls in love with him (after of course Prince Hans outs himself by revealing that his true intentions was to marry Anna and take over the Arrendale throne). That reversal is a nice twist but Hans is a minor villain in the pantheon of 'Frozen' antagonists, which all can be described as 'minor'.The problem with 'Frozen' is that it basically lacks an antagonist. Instead, the scenarists rely on Elsa's INTERNAL CONFUSION to move the story along. There is no evil 'Snow Queen' for the audience to root against. Instead, we merely are dragged along until Elsa inevitably gets herself together. But one wonders why she can't get herself together sooner. Instead of fighting an external villain, Elsa becomes an unlikeable loser who ends up creating a monstrous snowman, that almost hurls sister Anna and her soon-to-be boyfriend, off a cliff (also please include dopey Olaf, Anna's childhood snowman, who gets taken apart and put together again, ad infinitum).The all-powerful Elsa, is then somehow subdued by a few martinets and imprisoned in a jail cell with iron mitts. If she's such a powerful 'sorcerer', why does it take so long before she's able to 'freeze dry' the mitts and escape the jail cell? That's actually a minor contrivance compared to the climax when Elsa 'realizes' that Anna has sacrificed herself to save her. When Anna thaws out of her frozen state, that's when (duh!) Elsa realizes that only true love can set her own self free and also save the kingdom from eternal winter. Again, why does it take so long for (clueless) Elsa to realize the power of love? It's only hinted at (in the first few minutes of the film) but some kind of malevolent force has played with her self-esteem. But since that 'force' never manifests itself as a tangible entity, Elsa is reduced to being an ineffectual neurotic (hardly much of a crafty villain or heroine, we can root for!).As noted above, 'Frozen' has some great animation and the songs are bouncy and tuneful. Idina Menzel, of 'Wicked' fame, belts out the Elsa numbers and does quite well, especially the most catchy number, 'Let It Go'. Demi Lovato reprises 'Let It Go' on the end credits, but doesn't have as warm a voice as Menzel (and arrangement #2 doesn't help either). For years Disney attempted to adapt Han Christian Anderson's 'Snow Queen' as an animated feature without success. The difficulty in adapting such a sophisticated story is apparent in the current failure entitled 'Frozen'. Should a sequel be in the works, it would be best to create an actual Snow Queen antagonist, which could then propel this new adaptation, in a more efficacious direction.",2,H.C. Anderson rolls over in his grave as Disney scenarists substitute clueless neurotic for villainous Snow Queen antagonist,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,5121,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',

I enjoyed the characters of Anna and Olaf in great measure. I thought the kingdom was beautiful and the snow flurries that Elsa would make were really fun and pretty (the ice castle scene was amazing!!!).Two songs made an impression on me: &#34;Love is an Open Door&#34; & &#34;Let it Go&#34; (both movie and pop versions).I liked the plot up to the point when Elsa, the ice sister, finishes making her ice castle. After that, the plot on Elsa&#8217;s side drooped for me. I would&#8217;ve liked to of seen Elsa spend more than one day away from her kingdom and build more of her own, see her develop her powers further, and possibly make more ice friends or something so we can see what she's like when she doesn't have to fear &#34;icing&#34; people.As for Anna&#8217;s plot, it was predictable but good.The trolls were a so-so thing for me. They had potential, but I would&#8217;ve liked to of seen them be involved more with the story. Like coming down to help Kristoff at the end.The story did have one plot twist that I didn't see coming. A good move, and it solved who Anna would be with, but I gotta say I was disappointed in what happened. I can see why they did it, but still&#8230;I wish it were different.There were some laughs and some beautiful/classy outfits for some of the characters. I really liked Elsa's snowflake cape and Hans's prince outfit.All that being said...I felt like Disney was grasping at straws here. The story had wonderful potential and I feel it could've been better, but it missed the mark. Mostly it&#8217;s because I wanted to see Elsa get a happier ending. She needs to be rewarded after the loneliness she put up with for all those years to keep her family safe.

1675543,A2N60VDBR10N18,B00FZM8Z7I,Tyler Johnson,"[5, 8]","I enjoyed this movie. Frozen is excellent family entertainment. It is not, however, the return to form that so many people seem to be trumpeting it to be. If you're looking for a family friendly movie that you and your kids will love, look no further. The characters are fun, quick, and utterly charming. The visuals are nothing short of gorgeous. The musical numbers are outstanding and the cast handles them wonderfully. The film delivers on the promise of a strong, likeable female lead that many people feelBrave (Three-Disc Collector's Edition: Blu-ray / DVD)was unable to fulfill.That Frozen is a good movie is not in question, and if all you're looking for is a great family film, you can ignore everything that follows this paragraph. Go see it, pre-order it, and enjoy. If you're looking for a return to the true Disney magic however, you may be disappointed.Again, I enjoyed Frozen, but the writing is just not up to ""Golden Age Disney"" quality. The main conflict of the movie could have been easily avoided by a little more TLC and a little less ""cutting your child off from the world"". The plot, too often, depends on misunderstandings of epic proportions. The ""villain"" of the story has little to no actual impact on the film as a whole, and the final solution to Elsa's problem is far too convenient and rather lazy. None of these things will effect the enjoyment of a very young child, the target audience, but the shame of it is that what made Disney great in their hey day was that ALL AGES could easily enjoy their films. The writing in Beauty and the Beast, Sleeping Beauty, Mulan, Aladdin, Tarzan, The Aristocats, The Rescuers, ect was excellent, managing to entertain children while at the same time engaging adults, and it is that last part that Frozen doesn't quite manage to get right.This minor issue aside though Frozen is an excellent movie, that any family will love.

In the most recent years, the animated classic has been overshadowed by the amazement that is PIXAR. Now with the brainchild of that franchise heading the entire Disney animation department the fans have been given a very interesting mix of stories. Now, Disney's 53rd classic has brought the Disney faithful something that has been missing for a while, the gift of song.Frozen is a real step back in time to the glory days of the Disney Classic. The iconic films that saved Disney can be proud as they adopt Frozen into their elite crew. With a Broadway star cast and incredible songs, Frozen has done what the Disney classic has been unable to do for over a decade. While, the classic cell animation has been replaced by imaginative CGI, it is still the song, story and characters that drive this film and that is what makes a Disney classic. I enjoyed this film very much and it brought me back to those days, but I for one am still not calling it the greatest. My issue with this film is it really seemed that the songs were what drove this movie and it probably because the last few Disney classics were not musicals, it seemed that every 5 seconds there was another song and it just took away from the story. While The Little Mermaid, Beauty and The Beast and Aladdin had their music, those films still had rich stories and that is why they are some of the greatest. Don't get me wrong, Frozen is definitely a reminder of those days and the film is still enjoyable, but I will not call it the best Disney Classic of all time, nor would I put it in my top 10.In summation, it was great to get this trip back through time, but I am very curious if there will be another film quite like this one.

Usually, when I see one of the better ones, I can pinpoint exactly what I like about it.  For Toy Story, it is the ability to relate to the characters.  In Tangled, for instance, it was a story so sad you couldn't help but root for the protagonist.  With Frozen, however, I can't put my finger on &#34;one reason&#34; why I liked it so much...it was kind of more of a &#34;package deal&#34;.For a basic plot summary, Frozen tells the story of two sisters born of royal blood, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell).  While very close as young sisters, the women drift apart in adulthood after an accident in which Elsa's ice-creating magical powers hurts Elsa.  Determined not to hurt anyone ever again, Elsa absconds the royalty and creates her own castle far into the wilderness.  The only problem?  She has left her hometown in a perpetual state of winter.  As such, young sis Anna sets out to find Elsa and set things right, along the way meeting up with mountain-man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and snowman-come-to-life Olaf (Josh Gad).Like I said, there is no one thing about this movie that really makes it stand out compared to previous Disney efforts.  It is just the combination of everything that make it such an enjoyable experience.  The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, humor abounds, the visuals are astounding, and the music is enthralling.  There never seems to be a lacking moment in the whole 104-minute spectacle.So, despite not being able to hang my hat on that &#34;one attribute&#34;, Frozen is primarily such an enjoyable experience because it has a little bit of everything.

The songs were fabulous, the characters were both heartwarming and funny, the plot was interesting, etc.  If you are one of the few that haven't seen it yet (like I was), go watch it!  :)",5,Took awhile to see it but loved it!,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,509,"['tried', 'see', 'once', 'movie', 'theater', 'was', 'sold', 'out', 'had', 'heard', 'friends', 'talk', 'how', 'children', 'loved', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'gotten', 'watching', 'Well', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'am', 'love', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'Disney', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'songs', 'were', 'fabulous', 'characters', 'were', 'heartwarming', 'funny', 'plot', 'was', 'interesting', 'etc', 'are', 'one', 'few', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'was', 'go', 'watch']",N/A
