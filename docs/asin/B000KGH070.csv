The familiar plot of the bionically engineered human is pulled off the shelf and given another workout; in this case it happens to be a beautiful female who has been crafted by a corporation to do its dirty work.One of the down sides of the extra effort put in to this one's design was a developing sense of self and a desire to be free of corporate constraints. When a discovery sends Pentan, played by Tracy Davis, on a mission to recover some key information from a rival corporation she decides to improvise on her assignment and do her own thing.During the course of her adventure Pentan begins to discover some new things about herself with the assistance of Captain Brickman who she hires to take her to the discovery which will change their lives. Her former employer, the evil Kuriyama Corporation, doesn't take well to her defection with key information and gives hot pursuit. The major part of the movie involves Pentan and Captain Brickman trying to find the discovery and stay alive in the meantime.Will they succeed or die in the effort; you'll have to watch it to find out.",3,For the Dedicated Sci-Fi Fan,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,1170,"['one', 'marginal', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'go', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'familiar', 'plot', 'bionically', 'engineered', 'human', 'pulled', 'off', 'shelf', 'given', 'workout', 'case', 'be', 'beautiful', 'female', 'who', 'been', 'crafted', 'corporation', 'do', 'dirty', 'work.One', 'down', 'sides', 'extra', 'effort', 'put', 'one', 'design', 'was', 'developing', 'sense', 'self', 'desire', 'be', 'free', 'corporate', 'constraints', 'When', 'discovery', 'Pentan', 'played', 'Tracy', 'Davis', 'mission', 'recover', 'key', 'information', 'rival', 'corporation', 'improvise', 'assignment', 'do', 'own', 'thing.During', 'course', 'adventure', 'Pentan', 'discover', 'new', 'things', 'assistance', 'Captain', 'Brickman', 'who', 'take', 'discovery', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'former', 'employer', 'evil', 'Kuriyama', 'Corporation', ""n't"", 'take', 'well', 'defection', 'key', 'information', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'major', 'part', 'movie', 'Pentan', 'Captain', 'Brickman', 'trying', 'find', 'discovery', 'stay', 'alive', 'meantime.Will', 'succeed', 'die', 'effort', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out']",Outerworld

1034127,AYIIGXIQWE9HY,B000KGH070,"D. Sitbon ""Raw Head Lex""","[36, 40]","This imaginative space sci fi adventure was originally called Star Quest which was aired on the Sci Fi Channel.  Now with improved special effects and tighter scenes it is renamed Outerworld.  But wait:  What if you're a fan of the original Star Quest untouched?  No problem there, because this DVD also contains the full version of the original Star Quest digitally remastered and color corrected.  So you can see and compare both films on one DVD.  You will see how the explosions look better, the ships flying are now done by CG giving them more realistic movements, there are more complicated scenes that never could have been done by models and the best part is the story flows better now.  So, if you're a fan of sci fi, the original Star Quest or just want to experience Outerworld for yourself, I highly recommend it.  Kuriyama's Promethean ship is a force to be reconded with as the genetically engineered superbeing Pentan (Tracy Davis) fights for her life and to stop the evil Kuriyama's coorporation gaining one of the most important scientific finds ever in human history.

""Outerworld"" was originally called ""Beyond the Rising Moon"", but in 2004 they renamed it ""Outerworld"", re-edited it, and put new CGI effects in it. The main feature on this disc is ""Outerworld"", but also includes the original ""Beyond the Rising Moon"" on the special features so you get both versions. Personally I prefere the original. The editing is much better on the original, the story's not as rushed, and most of the model shots I think look more realistic than the bad CGI effects they used for the updated version. But the new version does have some things to offer. Such as Robert's death that was never featured in the orginal, and the final battle which takes place in an asteroid feild. Originally there were no asteroids. And the spaceship explosion at the end is much more impressive than the one they had in the original. The thing about this DVD is that you get both versions.Pentan is a genetically engineered human that was created for corporate warfare. But when she gets tired of killing and being a slave to an evil corporation, she rebels against her emplorers, and an action-packed adventure across the stars begins.Although the acting is lacking in some areas, for the most part this was a great movie with a lot of action and a great plot.Highly recommended!",4,"A lot better than ""Blade Runner"", but not quite as good as ""Star Wars"".",1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,1383,"['take', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'combine', 'Robocop', 'Star', 'Wars', 'then', 'get', 'Outerworld', 'Outerworld', 'was', 'originally', 'called', 'Rising', 'Moon', '2004', 'renamed', 'Outerworld', 're-edited', 'put', 'new', 'CGI', 'effects', 'main', 'feature', 'disc', 'Outerworld', 'also', 'original', 'Rising', 'Moon', 'special', 'features', 'get', 'versions', 'Personally', 'prefere', 'original', 'editing', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'story', 'not', 'rushed', 'most', 'model', 'shots', 'think', 'look', 'more', 'realistic', 'bad', 'CGI', 'effects', 'used', 'updated', 'version', 'new', 'version', 'have', 'things', 'offer', 'Such', 'Robert', 'death', 'was', 'never', 'featured', 'orginal', 'final', 'battle', 'place', 'asteroid', 'feild', 'Originally', 'were', 'asteroids', 'spaceship', 'explosion', 'end', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'one', 'had', 'original', 'thing', 'DVD', 'get', 'versions.Pentan', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'human', 'was', 'created', 'corporate', 'warfare', 'when', 'tired', 'killing', 'being', 'slave', 'evil', 'corporation', 'emplorers', 'action-packed', 'adventure', 'stars', 'acting', 'lacking', 'areas', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'lot', 'action', 'great', 'plot.Highly', 'recommended']",Outerworld

I actually looked her up to see what other movies she was in and was saddened to find that this was about it for her.This movie may be ""bad"" compared to the mainstream sci-fi classics like Blade Runner and Star Wars, but it comes across a someone's labor of love that was done with little money and a lot of care.

The film is low budget so they could only afford amateur actors, amateur special effects, amateur fight scenes, etc. That is to say that you can't hold Outerworld, or other B films, to the same standards as big budget movies. What you need to do is to keep your expectations low and let the film speak for itself.I must say that I was  taken by Outerworld after about 5 to 10 minutes. Most films I want to turn off after 5 to 10 minutes but Outerworld has soul/spirit. By the end of the film, I found myself genuinely worried for Pentan, especially when she was in her space fighter and chose to take out the bad guys in order to guarantee her and Brickman's freedom forever. I thought, ""Oh my gosh, they are going to kill off her character here!"" Brickman's character also grew on me.
