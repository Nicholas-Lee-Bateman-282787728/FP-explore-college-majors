A well rounded script for anime. This is meant for adults so don't get this for your 4 year old. It's not meant for kids.,5,funny anime,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,261,"['anime', 'funny', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'ghosts', 'wierd', 'stuff', 'poltergiests', 'alchemy', 'aspect', 'kinda', 'wierd', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'rounded', 'script', 'anime', 'meant', 'adults', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', '4', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'meant', 'kids']","Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 10: Journey To Ishbal Episodes 37-40"

974919,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000ENUKVM,Sesho,"[1, 2]","The first episode on Volume 10 focuses on a more comedic aspect of Fullmetal Alchemist that has gradually dwindled from the anime but has been present in the manga of this title from the beginning. This abrupt switch in gears in Episode 37 which spotlights Colonel Mustang in a ghost hunting expedition right out of Scooby Doo doesn't mix at all with the more tragic bent of the show and comes off as a too little to late homage to the manga. Episode 38 follows Winry and the bookworm Sciezka as they wiretap the phone of King Bradley's secretary, a woman that was supposed to have died many years ago! The last two episodes go back to Ed and Al as they arrive at the ruins of Ishbal and learn about the role of the Chimera in that war from Marta, one of Greed's ex-minions that was crossed with a snake and is seeking revenge against the military establishment that killed all her friends.I thought the comedy episode was really weak. It's too late to bring in the laughs now as a bunch of lives touched with tragedy are coming to a meeting, and with some dark secrets of the past being revealed, the humor is even less welcome. After that throwaway, the other 3 episodes made up for the non-beginning. The writers of the show are starting to get to the humanity of the characters, most ironically, with the Homunculi, if that makes any sense. You get the sense that the characters paths are set, and they have to do what they have to do and not look back. Whether it's Scar, Ed, Al, Winry, Mustang, or the Homunculi, they all have a reason and a goal they are trying to achieve, even though some of their dreams will lead to the deaths of whole nations. Great show.I would also recommend the anime Scrapped Princess and Cowboy Bebop. Also the manga version of Fullmetal Alchemist.",4,SECRETS COME OUT,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,1782,"['first', 'episode', 'Volume', '10', 'focuses', 'more', 'comedic', 'aspect', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'gradually', 'dwindled', 'anime', 'been', 'present', 'manga', 'title', 'beginning', 'abrupt', 'switch', 'gears', 'Episode', '37', 'spotlights', 'Colonel', 'Mustang', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'expedition', 'right', 'Scooby', 'Doo', ""n't"", 'mix', 'more', 'tragic', 'bent', 'show', 'off', 'too', 'little', 'late', 'homage', 'manga', 'Episode', '38', 'Winry', 'bookworm', 'Sciezka', 'wiretap', 'phone', 'King', 'Bradley', 'secretary', 'woman', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'died', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'go', 'back', 'Ed', 'Al', 'arrive', 'ruins', 'Ishbal', 'learn', 'role', 'Chimera', 'war', 'Marta', 'one', 'Greed', 'ex-minions', 'was', 'crossed', 'snake', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'military', 'establishment', 'killed', 'friends.I', 'thought', 'comedy', 'episode', 'was', 'really', 'weak', 'too', 'late', 'bring', 'laughs', 'now', 'bunch', 'lives', 'touched', 'tragedy', 'are', 'coming', 'meeting', 'dark', 'secrets', 'past', 'being', 'revealed', 'humor', 'even', 'less', 'welcome', 'throwaway', 'other', '3', 'episodes', 'made', 'up', 'non-beginning', 'writers', 'show', 'are', 'starting', 'get', 'humanity', 'characters', 'most', 'ironically', 'Homunculi', 'sense', 'get', 'sense', 'characters', 'paths', 'are', 'set', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'back', 'Scar', 'Ed', 'Al', 'Winry', 'Mustang', 'Homunculi', 'have', 'reason', 'goal', 'are', 'trying', 'achieve', 'even', 'dreams', 'will', 'lead', 'deaths', 'whole', 'nations', 'Great', 'show.I', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'anime', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Also', 'manga', 'version', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist']","Fullmetal Alchemist, Volume 10: Journey To Ishbal Episodes 37-40"
