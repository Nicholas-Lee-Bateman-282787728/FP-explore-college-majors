572387,A2GPKC42QA6737,B000059H75,"Jeremy Garber ""urbanmenno""","[0, 0]","Much more than the possible teen exploitation fest the title and description might suggest. This film, directed by Seinfield's Jason Alexander, is actually a charming and realistic picture of a young Jewish boy in the 50s negotiating what it means to be a raging adolescent full of hormones, but also a young adult learning what kind of man he wants to be. Subtle in some parts and slapstick in others, the message is that sex is mysterious but our relationships with other people are way more mysterious than that. Ryan Merriman in the main role is especially excellent - the perfect fourteen-year-old boy. (He reminds me of my nephew. Just don't tell my sister.)",5,Just Looking for What It Means to Be a Man,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,664,"['Much', 'more', 'possible', 'teen', 'exploitation', 'fest', 'title', 'description', 'might', 'suggest', 'film', 'directed', 'Seinfield', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'actually', 'charming', 'realistic', 'picture', 'young', 'Jewish', 'boy', '50s', 'negotiating', 'what', 'be', 'raging', 'adolescent', 'full', 'hormones', 'also', 'young', 'adult', 'learning', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'be', 'Subtle', 'parts', 'slapstick', 'others', 'message', 'sex', 'mysterious', 'relationships', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'way', 'more', 'mysterious', 'Ryan', 'Merriman', 'main', 'role', 'especially', 'excellent', 'perfect', 'fourteen-year-old', 'boy', 'nephew', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'sister']",N/A

Though I had never heard of it-nor seen it, I thought I'd give it a shot!I was very pleased with my decision after viewing it.It was a very funny and heartwarming story that takes place in the 1950's. It re-creates that time and place quite well!The actors were very good and the story was also. It teaches us about life, love, sex and of course, married life!Most importantly, it was a wonderful movie with a blend of comedy and a touch of drama. Both make for a great film!I highly recommend that you see it if you haven't already!",5,A GREAT COMING OF AGE MOVIE!!,1012780800,"02 4, 2002",2002,587,"['recently', 'bought', 'video', 'used', 'rental', 'shop', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'it-nor', 'seen', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'decision', 'viewing', 'it.It', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'place', '1950', 'time', 'place', 'quite', 'well', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'life', 'love', 'sex', 'course', 'married', 'life', 'Most', 'importantly', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'blend', 'comedy', 'touch', 'drama', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'have', ""n't"", 'already']",N/A

It reminded me of growing up in the same era and having an unrequieted crush on a knock-down-gorgeous model 10 years my senior. Alexander handled the perinnial exploration of sexuality by budding teenagers with humor, sensitivity and a wise director's tongue-planted-firmly-in-cheek.

I wonder what else he has done. I was expecting a PORKYS type movie, but was surprised by the quality and realism. Usually I don't like profanity, but it is absolutely required in this movie. I was thinking. Ryan was asked by another male kid to join a sex club. The only other members were two girls.
