Great workout.  I have been through the Jillian scream fests and other fitness DVD's and found this program to be the most workable.  I am in my second week and have enjoyed every workout as presented in the guide.  I think what works for me is the length of the workouts.  I feel that I have really gotten a great workout and didn't have to spend 1hour or more to get there.  I also get bored VERY fast and actually have looked forward to working out.  Worth the $20.  I have not followed the food plan as I already eat pretty healthy and really just need to maintain my fitness level which is intermediate to advanced.  The instructor is very motivating without being goofy or screaming at you.  All and all I highly recommend this system.

I like that there are no pull ups, and no pull up bar is necessary. All you need is some weights and a swiss ball. The workouts from warm up to cool down are about 45 minutes. I love the swiss ball core workout DVD, and also the Tabata workout. I also like that Supreme 90 Day incorporates the use of the swiss ball in the strength training workouts to add some stability exercises into the mix. The downside to Supreme 90 Day is there is no website or online community support beyond a Facebook page (that I'm aware of) but it's a good solid program and I use it with other DVD workouts as part of my home workout program.",5,Great program at a terrific value.,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,742,"['first', 'thing', 'like', 'Supreme', '90', 'Day', 'price-', 'incredible', 'value', 'affordable', 'nearly', 'anyone', 'like', 'are', 'pull', 'ups', 'pull', 'up', 'bar', 'necessary', 'need', 'weights', 'swiss', 'ball', 'workouts', 'warm', 'cool', 'down', 'are', '45', 'minutes', 'love', 'swiss', 'ball', 'core', 'workout', 'DVD', 'also', 'Tabata', 'workout', 'also', 'like', 'Supreme', '90', 'Day', 'use', 'swiss', 'ball', 'strength', 'training', 'workouts', 'add', 'stability', 'mix', 'downside', 'Supreme', '90', 'Day', 'website', 'online', 'community', 'support', 'Facebook', 'page', ""'m"", 'aware', 'good', 'solid', 'program', 'use', 'other', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'part', 'home', 'workout', 'program']",N/A

1427020,A1F002ABWJAQMF,B004S2YN5O,Erika,"[4, 5]","Firstly, though I'm not unfamiliar with the exercise world, I did take quite the hiatus from it all for years due to chronic illness, then marriage, then laziness. I kept trying to begin routine workouts that I could do daily, that I would keep up with until I at least lost the extra ten pounds I've been lugging around. After failing to keep myself jogging daily, or weight training daily, or jump roping daily, or walking my dogs, etc etc, I knew I needed more to keep me going. Mind you, I was quite fit and had no problems with motivation in my early 20s - the good old days.I got this for Christmas last year and started the workouts in January. I must say, compared to other DVDs I've tried (Jillian Michaels, random yoga, Pilates, and mini-trampoline DVDs - Yes, I have tried it all) this set is the best! Reasons why I like this workout system:-The trainer is encouraging and motivating; He gets me to push myself hard, and he makes me WANT to keep up with the others in the video (I can't at this point, though)-The trainer motivates without being in your face and without being annoying (.....Jillian)-The exercises move at a quick pace - it keeps your heart rate up AND it makes the workout speed by, stays interesting, and I'm not wasting an extra 20 minutes of my day standing in the garage waiting for the next round to start (Those 20 minutes are best used watching Dexter or Seinfeld reruns, after all)-Nearly every workout includes abdominal work specifically-The cardio workout and Tabata Inferno are hard, and I feel pretty good afterwards-Most of the video models (male and female) have great physiques and it's pretty darn motivating to see their muscles and fitness levels-Warm up and cool down stretches precede and follow every workout-A meal plan and shopping guide comes in the kit (I haven't used it because I'm disillusioned and think I know what's good for me...)Things that bother me a wee bit:-During the warm up (It's the same on each disc), one of the models looks seriously TICKED OFF the entire time! You can see it in her face during close ups and also in the way she flops through the exercises, like a kid who is being forced to participate in a school production. It's very distracting to me because every warm up, I can't help but look for the angry expression and body language instead of focusing. Heck, you might consider buying this set just to see the angry warm up girl!-The one workout I don't enjoy too much is the Ultimate Ball routine. The ball I have is a little small compared to the ones used in the video, and I feel self conscious. Kidding, but it makes some of the exercises more difficult for me.-The trainer often uses the wrong names of the people in the video and announces the incorrect next exercise. He catches himself, but not before confusing either me or one of the folks in the videoAll in all, I quite like this workout set. I am only half way through it, and after a week long break and a 24 hour candy/dessert/steak/potato/butter binge in Orlando, I have not lost any weight. However, I can see small changes in my body - my stomach has something going on, though not sure what. My legs look a bit different, and my arms look more serious, according to my sister.My advice to anyone who buys this - Make sure to do it 6 days a week so you don't allow yourself to start making excuses to miss it AND eat somewhat healthily, cause otherwise you're delaying results.",4,30 years old - Been lazy and out of shape for 5 years,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,3434,"['Firstly', ""'m"", 'not', 'unfamiliar', 'exercise', 'world', 'did', 'take', 'quite', 'hiatus', 'years', 'due', 'chronic', 'illness', 'then', 'marriage', 'then', 'laziness', 'kept', 'trying', 'begin', 'routine', 'workouts', 'could', 'do', 'daily', 'would', 'keep', 'up', 'least', 'lost', 'extra', 'ten', 'pounds', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lugging', 'around', 'failing', 'keep', 'jogging', 'daily', 'weight', 'training', 'daily', 'jump', 'roping', 'daily', 'walking', 'dogs', 'etc', 'etc', 'knew', 'needed', 'more', 'keep', 'going', 'Mind', 'was', 'quite', 'fit', 'had', 'problems', 'motivation', 'early', '20s', 'good', 'old', 'days.I', 'got', 'Christmas', 'last', 'year', 'started', 'workouts', 'January', 'must', 'say', 'compared', 'other', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'random', 'yoga', 'Pilates', 'mini-trampoline', 'DVDs', 'Yes', 'have', 'tried', 'set', 'best', 'Reasons', 'why', 'like', 'workout', 'system', '-The', 'trainer', 'encouraging', 'motivating', 'push', 'hard', 'WANT', 'keep', 'up', 'others', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'point', '-The', 'trainer', 'motivates', 'being', 'face', 'being', 'annoying', '..Jillian', '-The', 'exercises', 'move', 'quick', 'pace', 'heart', 'rate', 'workout', 'speed', 'stays', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'not', 'wasting', 'extra', '20', 'minutes', 'day', 'standing', 'garage', 'waiting', 'next', 'round', 'start', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'best', 'used', 'watching', 'Dexter', 'Seinfeld', 'reruns', '-Nearly', 'workout', 'abdominal', 'work', 'specifically-The', 'cardio', 'workout', 'Tabata', 'Inferno', 'are', 'hard', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'afterwards-Most', 'video', 'models', 'male', 'female', 'have', 'great', 'physiques', 'pretty', 'darn', 'motivating', 'see', 'muscles', 'fitness', 'levels-Warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'stretches', 'precede', 'follow', 'workout-A', 'meal', 'plan', 'shopping', 'guide', 'kit', 'have', ""n't"", 'used', ""'m"", 'disillusioned', 'think', 'know', 'what', 'good', 'bother', 'wee', 'bit', '-During', 'warm', 'up', 'same', 'disc', 'one', 'models', 'seriously', 'TICKED', 'entire', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'face', 'close', 'ups', 'also', 'way', 'exercises', 'kid', 'who', 'being', 'forced', 'participate', 'school', 'production', 'very', 'distracting', 'warm', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'look', 'angry', 'expression', 'body', 'language', 'instead', 'focusing', 'Heck', 'might', 'consider', 'buying', 'set', 'just', 'see', 'angry', 'warm', 'up', 'girl', 'one', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'Ultimate', 'Ball', 'routine', 'ball', 'have', 'little', 'small', 'compared', 'ones', 'used', 'video', 'feel', 'self', 'conscious', 'Kidding', 'exercises', 'more', 'difficult', 'me.-The', 'trainer', 'often', 'wrong', 'names', 'people', 'video', 'incorrect', 'next', 'exercise', 'not', 'confusing', 'one', 'folks', 'videoAll', 'quite', 'workout', 'set', 'am', 'only', 'half', 'way', 'week', 'long', 'break', '24', 'hour', 'candy/dessert/steak/potato/butter', 'binge', 'Orlando', 'have', 'not', 'lost', 'weight', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'small', 'changes', 'body', 'stomach', 'something', 'going', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'legs', 'look', 'bit', 'different', 'arms', 'look', 'more', 'serious', 'according', 'sister.My', 'advice', 'anyone', 'who', 'Make', 'sure', 'do', '6', 'days', 'week', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'start', 'making', 'excuses', 'miss', 'AND', 'eat', 'somewhat', 'healthily', 'cause', 'otherwise', ""'re"", 'delaying', 'results']",N/A
1427021,A1YS5EZCF21PBS,B004S2YN5O,F. Ali,"[7, 7]","I am an advanced exerciser (Cathe Friedrich dominates my fitness library) and I came across this product while researching workouts by BeachBody, and was pretty quick to buy it considering the price. For $20 you get 10 dvds, a nutrition guide and a calendar so you know which workouts to do every day. That is an insanely good deal!The dvds you get include:-Chest & Back-Shoulders & Arms (this includes biceps and triceps)-Legs-Back & Bi's-Chest, Shoulders & Tri's-Total Body  (not as thorough as I would have expected)-Core Dynamics-Ultimate Ball (core workout)-Cardio Challenge-Tabata Inferno (cardio)You basically do 1 dvd per day, 6 days per week. You get 1 rest day, and the rotation changes a bit every few weeks.A few cons: the packaging is pretty flimsy; I ended up tossing it out and putting the dvds in separate sleeves. Re: the workout itself, it's very much a personal trainer-style format, meaning, the instructor spends most of the time talking/explaining moves and walking around while others do the workout, rather than doing it himself. This may not be a thing for some people, but personally I like instructor/class formats where they're working out with everyone else. There's also not a whole lot of emphasis on form, so I recommend keeping a close eye on the participants and watching their form if you're new to some of these moves.Overall though, I think these dvds are very good quality. They're very well-made and the workouts are challenging, provided you choose the right weights for yourself, which in the end is the most important thing. The core dvds (Core Dynamics and Ultimate Ball) are my favorites, and I love how challenging Tabata Inferno is. While I'm not terribly impressed with the weightlifting dvds (they're not bad at all, just not anything extraordinary) I did come across a few new moves that I had never tried before, and that's saying something because I work in the fitness industry! :)I can't say much about the nutritional guide because I haven't been following it. That said, while still maintaining my regular eating habits but following the workout program strictly, my weight has been about the same (not really trying to lose weight though) and my muscle mass seems to be about the same as well (already pretty toned to begin with); however I've noticed some difference in my abs, which I'm happy about. Tom Holland (the trainer/instructor) does abs in pretty much every dvd which I think is great, and is probably why I've seen such a difference. I do think though that if I had followed the nutritional guide, I would have seen additional differenceWith all that said, I would definitely recommend this dvd set. It's cheap, and if you only end up liking 2 or 3 dvds of the 10 that you get, you'll still have gotten your money's worth. It's challenging, and like I said, a workout that actually challenges you is important. Finally, as a busy grad student, this dvd set has been great for me because the workouts aren't super long (40 minutes on average...) and it allowed me to take a break from all the workout planning and hitting the gym every single day. It's been nice to just look at my calendar to see what dvd I'm supposed to do, pop it in and be done in less than an hour.Hope this review helped for anyone who's on the fence about this product!",5,great value,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,3310,"['am', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'fitness', 'library', 'came', 'product', 'researching', 'workouts', 'BeachBody', 'was', 'pretty', 'quick', 'buy', 'considering', 'price', '20', 'get', '10', 'dvds', 'nutrition', 'guide', 'calendar', 'know', 'do', 'day', 'insanely', 'good', 'deal', 'dvds', 'get', 'include', '-Chest', 'Back-Shoulders', 'Arms', 'biceps', 'triceps', '-Legs-Back', ""Bi's-Chest"", 'Shoulders', ""Tri's-Total"", 'Body', 'not', 'as', 'would', 'have', 'expected', '-Core', 'Dynamics-Ultimate', 'Ball', 'core', 'workout', 'Challenge-Tabata', 'Inferno', 'cardio', 'basically', 'do', '1', 'dvd', 'day', '6', 'days', 'week', 'get', '1', 'rest', 'day', 'rotation', 'bit', 'few', 'weeks.A', 'few', 'cons', 'packaging', 'pretty', 'flimsy', 'ended', 'up', 'tossing', 'putting', 'dvds', 'separate', 'sleeves', 'Re', 'workout', 'very', 'much', 'personal', 'trainer-style', 'format', 'meaning', 'instructor', 'most', 'time', 'talking/explaining', 'moves', 'walking', 'around', 'others', 'do', 'workout', 'rather', 'doing', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'thing', 'people', 'personally', 'like', 'instructor/class', 'formats', 'where', ""'re"", 'working', 'out', 'everyone', 'else', 'also', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'emphasis', 'form', 'recommend', 'keeping', 'close', 'eye', 'participants', 'watching', 'form', ""'re"", 'new', 'moves.Overall', 'think', 'dvds', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'quality', ""'re"", 'very', 'well-made', 'workouts', 'are', 'challenging', 'provided', 'choose', 'right', 'weights', 'yourself', 'end', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'core', 'dvds', 'Core', 'Dynamics', 'Ultimate', 'Ball', 'are', 'favorites', 'love', 'how', 'challenging', 'Tabata', 'Inferno', ""'m"", 'not', 'terribly', 'impressed', 'weightlifting', 'dvds', ""'re"", 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'anything', 'extraordinary', 'did', 'come', 'few', 'new', 'moves', 'had', 'never', 'tried', 'saying', 'something', 'work', 'fitness', 'industry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'nutritional', 'guide', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'following', 'said', 'still', 'maintaining', 'regular', 'eating', 'habits', 'following', 'workout', 'program', 'strictly', 'weight', 'been', 'same', 'not', 'really', 'trying', 'lose', 'weight', 'muscle', 'mass', 'be', 'same', 'well', 'already', 'pretty', 'toned', 'begin', 'however', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'difference', 'abs', ""'m"", 'happy', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'trainer/instructor', 'abs', 'pretty', 'much', 'dvd', 'think', 'great', 'probably', 'why', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'difference', 'do', 'think', 'had', 'followed', 'nutritional', 'guide', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'additional', 'differenceWith', 'said', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'set', 'cheap', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'liking', '2', '3', 'dvds', '10', 'get', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'gotten', 'money', 'worth', 'challenging', 'said', 'workout', 'actually', 'important', 'Finally', 'busy', 'grad', 'student', 'dvd', 'set', 'been', 'great', 'workouts', 'are', ""n't"", 'super', 'long', '40', 'minutes', 'average', 'allowed', 'take', 'break', 'workout', 'planning', 'hitting', 'gym', 'single', 'day', 'been', 'nice', 'just', 'look', 'calendar', 'see', 'what', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'do', 'pop', 'be', 'done', 'less', 'hour.Hope', 'review', 'helped', 'anyone', 'who', 'fence', 'product']",N/A

Gives time for you to setup and get water.  Funny how there were different people in the warm up section then the actual workout section.  Concentrate on the set of excercises he explains are coming up and demonstrates.  Please pay attention to technique and form.  Pace yourself and ignore the people in the background.  The goal is to breathe through the circuits and do each move the best way you can safely and only the number of times you can do now.  If the stretching towards the end is not enough I suggest holding the moves for a 10 seconds more than the instructor.  You will need that time to recover and get the tension out of the muscles.  Have water, weights, mat, and optional workout ball on hand depending on which DVD you are doing.  This may be used as a set of workouts on the days you are not doing some of your favorites, like Jillian Michaels.  Doing any type of physical excercise every day even if you are tired, do not want to workout, feel tired/ week...whatever the reason, just do it!  How else will you lose the weight and/ or tone???

1427023,A3FSPEXJFOPHJY,B004S2YN5O,"Glasgowgal ""Glasgowgal""","[8, 8]","I had never heard about this workout program until I read a little blurb about it in Fitness magazine.  They mentioned that it was about $20.00 and along the lines of P90X.  I always wanted to try P90X, but didn't want to spend that kind of money.  Supreme 90 fit my price range.I am a big fan of Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner workouts.  I thought they worked you hard, but nothing like this.  Every workout, I am drenched in sweat.  I usually get bored pretty quickly with workouts and keep moving on to find something that will provide a good workout and a challenge.  This program does both.I know a few people have posted that they didn't like doing the same warm-up and cool down no matter what body part you are working that day.  I didn't find a problem at all with this.  I don't get to workout until after work, so doing the warm-up loosened up my whole body after sitting at a desk all day.  As for the cool down, the stretches feel absolutely wonderful even if you didn't work a particular body part.  You pretty much feel like Jello when you're done.Tom Holland is a great instructor.  He is very informative and supportive.  He doesn't chatter through the whole workout and encourages you to push yourself and do your best.  Once in a while he does get confused as to what exercise is next, but that is no biggie.  We're all human, though the people performing the workouts I think are super-human!  Tom encourages you to pause the video if they are going to fast for you.  I've had to do that several times, but I am getting better at keeping up.I'm on Day 15 of this workout and look forward everyday to something different and challenging.

1427024,A2IUKTMKP9SRGI,B004S2YN5O,go bucks,"[1, 1]","this workout system is really terrific.  The price is amazing.  Prior to this program, I worked out 6 days a week and just rotate between my favorite dvd's.  I didn't intend to really do the 90 day system but rather just put the ones I liked in the rotation.  I've heard not to do a full body workout every day but rather focus on upper body, then lower body, etc. to avoid injury.  I just could never feel really good about that routine because I never felt I got a truly good workout just working one part of the body.  But once I started this system, I did feel the workouts were tough enough and decided to try the program to see if these would do more for me.  I'm only about 25 days in so I can't yet comment on the final result.  I do think my arms are more toned and sculpted.  I learned a little from the meal plan but am not following it. Most of these dvd's are pretty darn hard.  Some not quite as much - but I add at least a quick mile run if the workout didn't make me work up a sweat.  I always feel my muscles got a good workout.  The only one I don't like is ball, and I just substitute one of my other dvd's on that day.  The legs one is only 20 minutes (not counting warm up and cool down) and it is a killer!  I had no idea 20 minutes could be that long!!!  Tabata is good in that it really works you hard for 4 minutes, then you get a 1 minute break as he shows you the upcoming exercises.  The breaks make it do-able.  Cardio is hard too.  The warm up being the same for all except tabata is totally fine with me.  Frankly I don't know why they do a different one for tabata since it's all the same warm up exercises just in a different order.  I do wish the cool downs differed for each dvd since you've worked out different parts of the body, so a focus on stretching those muscles would be a little better.  The instructor is inspiring.  The moves aren't complicated.  The people doing the work out aren't all in sync which is great - you feel you can do your best without getting ahead or behind.  The best part of this system is that my husband started working out with it too.  My other dvd's were a little too female oriented for him.  This one has both men and women working out and just amping up the weight makes it more male appropriate.  He's really into it too and tells me he feels better and has more energy.  I can't believe the price!!!  This is so totally worth the price several times over.

I read the reviews on Supreme 90, so I decided to give it a try. I've tried the DVD's a couple of times, but Tom Holland moves too fast for me to follow. He SAYS to work at your own pace, but if you don't keep up you'll find yourself looking for the remote to pause it pretty often. Also, I found some of the moves are done too fast. Sometimes you're working with weights on the floor, then you're popping up to some jumping moves, then back on the floor- I found it to move too fast for me to follow. A while ago I learned that even if you're using light weights form is ALL. No, I'm not a trainer- just someone who's researched a lot on working out, and spoken with trainers. I'm 47, and I know my lower back can get a 'twinge' if I move too fast with weights. Yup, you guessed it- I tried keeping up with Tom & the bunch, was using light dumbbells, moved a bit too fast and ended up twinging it. It's nothing really serious, though. My point is, whether it's light or heavy weights, form is #1, but what seems to be the main idea of the program is to move at a fast pace, then change exercises.

I have tried all three workout systems and I thought it might be helpful to my fellow Amazonians to compare them. First, for Supreme:SUPREME PROS:1. The best price for a 90 day system I've found. Most 90 day systems are very expensive (including P90X).2. The workouts are short-around 30 minutes. I lose motivation with long workouts.3. Tom focuses on proper form.4. It doesn't have one of those obnoxious timers at the bottom of the screen. To me, that makes an already unenjoyable activity seem much longer.5. It includes a nutrition guide with daily meal plan.6. He gets down to business right away. There is no wasted time in the videos.7. Minimal equipment required. All you need is a stability ball and hand weights. However, you really need both in order to get the most out of the program.SUPREME CONS:1. The music is very annoying. It reminds me of, ahem, certain adult films my husband watches.2. The assistant exercisers are stone faced and silent throughout each DVD. They look miserable. It's bizarre.3. The warm up and cool down is the same on every video. That doesn't bother me, though.Some people say that this plan is a cheap imitation of P90X. I don't see any resemblance at all, save the 90 day aspect. The exercises are completely different, the meal plan is less restrictive, the workouts are half as long, and the program seems more suited to both genders than P90X, which seems more suited to men.P90 X:PROS:1. I find Tony Horton very funny, although many people don't. It made the workouts a little easier.2. I gained strength quickly.3. It is a very challenging regimen, so it never got too easy for me.CONS:1. Workouts too long.  1-1 1/2 hours just seemed to drag, and unfortunately, a lot of it was filler because of Tony's incessant chatting.2. Timer at the bottom-a lot of people enjoy this, but it isn't my thing. It made an already long workout drag.3. DVDs expensive. For people on a budget, this can be a dealbreaker.JILLIAN MICHAELS:I've bought most of her DVDs except Body Revolution and a couple of others.PROS:1. You can buy her videos separately, allowing you to pick and choose and save $$$.2. Minimal equipment required.3. Many modifications available.4. A lot of variety in different DVDs.5. Most of her workouts were customizable by difficulty.6. Short workouts. They are all between 20-40 minutes.CONS:1. I don't like the way she always discourages rest during workouts. If a person is out of shape or very tired, rest is important, IMO.2. She does not always demonstrate good form (ie Shred It with Weights).3. She repeats the same exercises over and over in different videos. I got very tired of plank exercises.4. The quality of her videos has diminished greatly over time. With TBL, her expensive website, her ineffective supplements that led to a lawsuit, her video game, and her web interviews, I am convinced greed is now her primary motivator, not the welfare of overweight/out of shape people. Although that is her right, I don't want to support such an individual financially.UPDATE: After working out to the Supreme system for a few weeks, I had to kick it back down to a three star rating. I guess maybe I get bored with DVDs quickly, but Tom Holland (the instructor's) talk on the DVDs has become irritating. He talks constantly and says the same two words repeatedly: ""Squeeze (whatever muscle)"" and ""Sally"" (the name of the female assistant.) Perhaps it is the fact that I am doing the same DVDs in a rotation that makes this intolerable. I'm sure the DVDs would be fine on mute, but I have trouble remembering the order of exercises.",3,Supreme vs. P90X vs. Jillian Michaels,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",2013,3669,"[""'m"", '36', 'year', 'old', '5', '3', 'tall', 'woman', '15', 'pounds', 'overweight', 'who', 'pretty', 'fit', 'have', 'tried', 'three', 'systems', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'helpful', 'fellow', 'Amazonians', 'compare', 'First', 'Supreme', 'SUPREME', 'PROS:1', 'best', 'price', '90', 'day', 'system', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Most', '90', 'day', 'systems', 'are', 'very', 'expensive', 'including', 'P90X', '.2', 'workouts', 'are', 'short-around', '30', 'minutes', 'lose', 'motivation', 'long', 'workouts.3', 'Tom', 'proper', 'form.4', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'obnoxious', 'timers', 'bottom', 'screen', 'already', 'unenjoyable', 'activity', 'seem', 'much', 'longer.5', 'nutrition', 'guide', 'daily', 'meal', 'plan.6', 'down', 'business', 'right', 'away', 'wasted', 'time', 'videos.7', 'Minimal', 'equipment', 'required', 'need', 'stability', 'ball', 'hand', 'weights', 'However', 'really', 'need', 'order', 'get', 'most', 'program.SUPREME', 'CONS:1', 'music', 'very', 'annoying', 'ahem', 'certain', 'adult', 'films', 'husband', 'watches.2', 'assistant', 'exercisers', 'are', 'stone', 'faced', 'silent', 'DVD', 'look', 'miserable', 'bizarre.3', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'same', 'video', ""n't"", 'bother', 'though.Some', 'people', 'say', 'plan', 'cheap', 'imitation', 'P90X', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'resemblance', 'save', '90', 'day', 'aspect', 'exercises', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'meal', 'plan', 'less', 'restrictive', 'workouts', 'are', 'half', 'long', 'program', 'more', 'suited', 'genders', 'P90X', 'more', 'suited', 'men.P90', 'X', 'PROS:1', 'find', 'Tony', 'Horton', 'very', 'funny', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'made', 'workouts', 'little', 'easier.2', 'gained', 'strength', 'quickly.3', 'very', 'challenging', 'regimen', 'never', 'got', 'too', 'easy', 'me.CONS:1', 'Workouts', 'too', 'long', '1-1', '1/2', 'hours', 'just', 'seemed', 'drag', 'unfortunately', 'lot', 'was', 'filler', 'Tony', 'incessant', 'chatting.2', 'Timer', 'bottom-a', 'lot', 'people', 'enjoy', ""n't"", 'thing', 'made', 'already', 'long', 'workout', 'drag.3', 'DVDs', 'expensive', 'people', 'budget', 'can', 'be', 'dealbreaker.JILLIAN', 'MICHAELS', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'most', 'DVDs', 'Body', 'Revolution', 'couple', 'others.PROS:1', 'can', 'buy', 'videos', 'separately', 'allowing', 'pick', 'choose', 'save', '.2', 'Minimal', 'equipment', 'required.3', 'Many', 'modifications', 'available.4', 'lot', 'variety', 'different', 'DVDs.5', 'Most', 'workouts', 'were', 'customizable', 'difficulty.6', 'Short', 'workouts', 'are', '20-40', 'minutes.CONS:1', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'always', 'rest', 'workouts', 'person', 'shape', 'very', 'tired', 'rest', 'important', 'IMO.2', 'not', 'always', 'demonstrate', 'good', 'form', 'ie', 'Shred', 'Weights', '.3', 'same', 'different', 'videos', 'got', 'very', 'tired', 'plank', 'exercises.4', 'quality', 'videos', 'diminished', 'greatly', 'time', 'TBL', 'expensive', 'website', 'ineffective', 'supplements', 'led', 'lawsuit', 'video', 'game', 'web', 'interviews', 'am', 'convinced', 'greed', 'now', 'primary', 'motivator', 'not', 'welfare', 'overweight/out', 'shape', 'people', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'support', 'individual', 'financially.UPDATE', 'working', 'out', 'Supreme', 'system', 'few', 'weeks', 'had', 'kick', 'back', 'down', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'guess', 'maybe', 'get', 'bored', 'DVDs', 'quickly', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'instructor', 'talk', 'DVDs', 'become', 'irritating', 'constantly', 'same', 'two', 'words', 'repeatedly', 'Squeeze', 'muscle', 'Sally', 'name', 'female', 'assistant', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'am', 'doing', 'same', 'DVDs', 'rotation', 'intolerable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'DVDs', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'mute', 'have', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'order', 'exercises']",N/A

1427034,ADS6Y2663M0W0,B004S2YN5O,Little Mom,"[19, 19]","Like many people I was intrigued with P90X.  I considered getting that program but I was a little leery for two reasons.  First, I am the mom of 2 teenagers and the time commitment was daunting.  Secondly, some of the exercises (like pullups) looked too hard for me.  When I read about this program in a Fitness magazine, I rushed to see the Amazon reviews and I must add my accolades to the crowd.  I've been doing this program for about 3 weeks now and I already see a difference in overall definition.  I recently lost about 10 lbs through mostly diet.  You could never see my definition partly because of the layer of fat covering my muscles.  I am a regular exerciser and was one of these people who thought, ""I guess I don't sweat"".  Wrong!  I was not working out hard enough before, and not in the right way.  The circuit exercises are very effective.  These workouts are challenging but doable for the most part.  There are only a couple of exercises thus far I cannot do, and I am easily able to modify them.  (the ""clapping pushup"" for example, I just do a regular pushup.)  And I am in my late 50's!  These workouts leave you energized at the end.  I cannot say enough good things about this program - the price is unbelievable for the quality.  As others have mentioned, the packaging is flimsy, but you can always buy DVD covers.  You can definitely change this workout to fit your particular needs.  If you are really buff like the people in the DVD, you can up your weights.  If you are a beginner, do less, use less weights or even no weights.  This is the real deal - the workouts go fast and I am not bored.UPDATE - September 25, 2012 - I'm at the end of my third go-around on this program, and it still rocks. It speaks well of a program that I have kept up with this over a year.  Just keep following Tom's advice and do what you can 100%.

My husband and I have done Chalean Extreme, P90x, and Insanity and were looking for a weight training system to do as a hybrid with Insanity. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of P90x and got very bored with Tony Horton and his DVD's and I also felt that they were way too long. Anyways, we did the first workout yesterday and I am totally impressed!  They are set up great and they aren't low budget which is what you would expect for $10. The trainer is really good and motivating and is great about showing you how to modify the moves without the ball which is something that we were worried about. It does go very fast so we did have to hit pause once or twice but over all I loved it. There were some great moves that I haven't seen in other videos and the warmup was fast paced and got my heart rate up. I am looking forward to doing them and I am feelng a little sore today. Always a good sign.Update 8/22/2012 - I have added all of these DVD's into my rotation of Insanity and they continue to impress me with the intensity and the results.

P90X is very nice, much higher end versus this and it's obvious from the get-go but the workouts themselves are outstanding.There are a couple of issues here and there where Tom says the wrong thing as far as what exercise is next but you get over that, the music is not great but just play your own. The one girl in the warm-up section does look like she would rather be anywhere but there, she looks absolutely miserable. The warmup and cooldown are basically the same throughout but you learn to adjust to whatever you're doing that day, at least that's what I do.The workouts, at least for me work for me better and differently than P90X. I like the pacing, albeit there are times when it does go really quickly, as in the chest and back workout, that one you will have to hit pause no doubt. I like that the pacing overall is faster as I feel like I get a great balance of cardio and strength whereas P90X is much more strength based, a great workout itself but just not exactly what I was wanting.The people in the workouts are all in amazing shape, assuming all fitness professionals. Some are so ripped, you have to almost do a double take.I really like the inclusion of the stability ball and honestly glad that the back workouts aren't pullups.

For &lt;$20, I decided to go for it.  Just watching a few disks scared me- ah oh- I'm going to hurt myself, i.e., pull my back out, pull a muscle, sprain a joint or tear something; however, Tom Holland encourages one to perform at their pace, weight level, modification, progress it as able, but to give it your best.The program consists of 10 dvd's each running between about 25-35 minutes: chest/back, ultimate ball, tabata inferno, shoulders/arms, cardio challenge, legs, total body, core dynamics, back/bi's, chest/shoulders/tri's;  there's the usual warm-up and cool down with each disk each running about 4 minutes; a sheet listing the 90 days of specific workouts, a manuel by Tosca Reno with OK foods, meal plans for 28 days, and one can go on line for further info or blog.  One can purchase an additional ab program for a few bucks, but it's not needed.Tom Holland directs the quick changing routines with usually 3-4 very fit individuals working with you.  I think he does a super job without yelling or making one feel inadequate.  He stresses form, increasing the weights, and a lot of core(some on every dvd).  One can also turn off his vocals under special features.One needs a set of dumbells and an exercise ball(but he shows what to do w/o one).After a few days of puttin' along, using light weights and pacing myself, I started to turn around.  I could keep up better, push myself harder and get a better pump without risk of injury.  After a week, definite improved muscle strength, some definition, sleeping like a baby, much better posture and endurance.  I started looking foward to hitting the program, watching my diet more closely, drinking lots of water, and dumping the fast food.It's basically a mind game with oneself no matter what regimen you chose out there, and a good diet is absolutely essential.

I decided to try to Supreme 90 Day, as it was a great price and the exercises looked sound.Some of the workouts leave me dripping more sweat than if I just did a 6 or 7 mile run. They are very challenging, but the exercises change frequently enough that the time passes rather quickly. I began to notice changes in my body after the first week. I thought that my legs were in great shape from running, but the exercises left me sore, which let me know that they were making me stronger and leaner. And I love that you don't need a ton of equipment, just a few weights and an exercise ball (though you could do the workouts without the ball). I don't have a big house and don't want a ton of equipment around.The trainer has a good mix of encouraging you to push yourself while not pushing you too far that you would get injured or be in a lot of pain. I would definitely recommend this program. My time is limited just like most people, and when I work out, I want a pounding workout that will make me drip sweat and give me results. I've tried the dance based programs and they just were not intense enough. I wouldn't recommend this program to someone who has isn't in at least moderately good shape (as the workouts are very challenging) or anyone who isn't interested in taking their body to the next level of fitness.UPDATE: I wanted to update my review since I have now completed this program and the Insanity Program. While I still think that Insanity is great, I think that this program might be a little better for the following reasons: First, this program is much easier on the knees than Insanity. It includes weights and is a better workout if you are looking for shaping muscles or getting cut. Insanity, however, is a better cardio program. Supreme 90 day, however, has a few good cardio workouts. After doing Insanity and then coming back to them, they seemed so much easier, but one of the things I like about these workouts is that they are shorter. I know I can get a good workout in even if I have only 40 minutes.

I never thought I could get a thorough workout it less than an hour, but these workouts have convinced me that I can.Why I love these workouts:**They're tough. My heart rate is up there for every workout, even the core ones.**Tom Holland is a great instructor.  I'd love to have him as my own trainer.  He's tough, yet motivating.**Constant change keeps me interested.  Since you're doing something different every day, I don't get bored with these. This set includes cardio, core and weights.**The focus on core work.  I know it's important to work the core, but I don't like doing so.  This series has you working your core in every workout.**The all-inclusive nature of the program.  There's a nutrition plan, compiled by Tosca Reno, plus online web support.**The workout crew is all very fit and very motivating.  I'd love to look half as good as the women in these DVDs.  Okay, so that's a pipe dream, but it's fun to imagine.**The price.  I had a coupon, so the entire set cost me all of $16.00.  Most of the single DVDs in my collection cost more than that!Some things to note about these workouts:**The warm-up and cool-down are the same for each workout.  This can get a little tiring after a while.**The pace is frantic.  Tom keeps telling us to go at our own pace, but it's hard to do so when the cast is going very fast.**These aren't appropriate for beginners. Even though easier modifications are shown, because of the fast pace, you really have to focus on your form.  Tom doesn't give a lot of form pointers.  I've worked out for years one-on-one with personal trainers, so I can maintain good form.**The DVD case is cardboard and very flimsy.**The rotation, as designed, seems a recipe for overtraining.**The warm-ups aren't long enough for me.I've modified the rotation as follows:**I do 20 minutes of very easy cardio to start.**In Weeks 4, 8 and 12, I put an extra day of yoga in between each workout, so my body has more chance to recover.In spite of the ""things to consider,"" I highly recommend this set to anyone wanting a tough workout that works!  Even if you only do one or two DVDs from this set, it's worth the purchase.",5,"Tough, yet fun workouts that get the job done",1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,2530,"['First', 'little', ""'m"", 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'who', 'completed', 'several', 'rounds', 'Beachbody', 'P90X', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'STS', 'Series.Is', 'Supreme', '90', 'copy', 'cat', 'version', 'P90X', 'based', 'same', 'principle', 'muscle', 'confusion', 'as', 'well', 'principle', 'clean', 'eating', 'similar', 'different', 'love', 'workouts', 'are', 'tough', 'pack', 'lot', '30-40', 'minutes', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'get', 'thorough', 'workout', 'less', 'hour', 'workouts', 'have', 'convinced', 'can.Why', 'love', 'workouts', '**They', ""'re"", 'tough', 'heart', 'rate', 'there', 'workout', 'even', 'core', 'ones', '**Tom', 'Holland', 'great', 'instructor', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'own', 'trainer', 'tough', 'yet', 'motivating', '**Constant', 'change', 'interested', ""'re"", 'doing', 'something', 'different', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'set', 'cardio', 'core', 'weights', '**The', 'focus', 'core', 'work', 'know', 'important', 'work', 'core', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'doing', 'so', 'series', 'working', 'core', 'workout', '**The', 'all-inclusive', 'nature', 'program', 'nutrition', 'plan', 'compiled', 'Tosca', 'Reno', 'online', 'web', 'support', '**The', 'workout', 'crew', 'very', 'fit', 'very', 'motivating', ""'d"", 'love', 'look', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'women', 'DVDs', 'Okay', 'pipe', 'dream', 'fun', 'imagine', '**The', 'price', 'had', 'coupon', 'entire', 'set', 'cost', '16.00', 'Most', 'single', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'cost', 'more', 'things', 'note', 'workouts', '**The', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'are', 'same', 'workout', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'tiring', 'while', '**The', 'pace', 'frantic', 'Tom', 'telling', 'go', 'own', 'pace', 'hard', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'cast', 'going', 'very', 'fast', '**These', 'are', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'beginners', 'Even', 'easier', 'modifications', 'are', 'shown', 'fast', 'pace', 'really', 'have', 'focus', 'form', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'give', 'lot', 'form', 'pointers', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'out', 'years', 'one-on-one', 'personal', 'trainers', 'can', 'maintain', 'good', 'form', '**The', 'DVD', 'case', 'cardboard', 'very', 'flimsy', '**The', 'rotation', 'designed', 'recipe', 'overtraining', '**The', 'warm-ups', 'are', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'me.I', ""'ve"", 'modified', 'rotation', '**I', 'do', '20', 'minutes', 'very', 'easy', 'cardio', 'start', '**In', 'Weeks', '4', '8', '12', 'put', 'extra', 'day', 'yoga', 'workout', 'body', 'more', 'chance', 'recover.In', 'spite', 'things', 'consider', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'tough', 'workout', 'Even', 'only', 'do', 'one', 'two', 'DVDs', 'set', 'purchase']",N/A

I mainly wondered if it was good as P90X, and if the exercises were different.I'm in my 3rd month, and I can honestly say this program rocks. I've noticed some big differences in my body. The workouts themselves are shorter..maybe around 35-40 minutes..but that's mainly because they go from exercise to exercise without taking any breaks. You'll get a cardio workout just from that.For those of you who have P90X, there are some significant differences. I would say 85% of the exercises done here are not done on P90x. Just about all the cardio DVD's use weights, whereas P90X doesn't. You also use weights on the chest exercises, whereas in P90x you mianly do a variety of pushups. There is also no pull up bar, but a wide variety of back exercises that use dumbbells. Also, Supreme 90 Day makes use of the stability ball. Lots of differences.The cardio is killer..especially Tabata Inferno.If there are any downsides, I would say that you probably will need the hexagon or adjustable dumbbells to do these DVD's since there are generally no pauses between exercises. p90x is an awesome program, but this one is as well.

Chest & Back (32:30)Warmup (4:19): The warmup includes ab work (the core) & is (at first) like a mini-workout.  At over 4 minutes, all of the DVDs except Tabatha Inferno has this warmup.Workout (22:14): At over 22 minutes, they move fast on this first DVD.Cool-down (5:57): These are stretches.  All of the 10 DVDs have the same cool-down.2. Ultimate Ball (40:49)Warmup (4:19):Workout (30:33): This uses the large Swiss ball.  I just did it without the ball.Cool-down (5:57):3. Tabata Inferno (43:42)Warmup:  It is only on this DVD that the warmup is included in the main workout.Workout (37:45):  I hate this one. This is long and tough. This includes moderate and tough aerobics, with some weight training.  The exercises include jumping variations, core work, and the circuits never seem to end.Cool-down (5:57):4. Shoulders & Arms (43:05)Warmup (4:19):Workout (32:49):Cool-down (5:57):5. Cardio Challenge (41:22)Warmup (4:19):Workout (31:06):  This is my favorite.  Moderate weights are used to boost calorie burn.  In general, you alternate 30 seconds of aerobics, followed by 30 seconds of rest, followed by 30 seconds of using moderate weights in an aerobic fashion, followed by 30 seconds of rest, and then repeat the same pattern.Cool-down (5:57):6. Legs (33:17)Warmup (4:19):Workout (22:51):  This is not only leg work. There is ab (core) work.Cool-down (5:57):7. Total Body (33:33)Warmup (4:19):Workout (23:17):Cool-down (5:57):8. Core Dynamics (28:22)WarmUp (4:19):Workout (18:06):  At just over 18 minutes, this is the shortest workout.Cool-down (5:57):9. Back & Bi's (56:38)Warmup (4:19):Workout (46:22):  This is the longest workout, at over 46 minutes.Cool-down (5:57):10. Chest, Shoulders, & Tri's (45:18)Warmup (4:19):Workout (34:52):Cool-down (5:57):The main workouts (excluding the warmups and the cool-downs) vary from about 18 minutes to about 46 minutes, with many close to 30 minutes, so these are relatively short workouts.The workouts use dumb-bells and a large Swiss ball. You need moderate to medium weight dumb-bells, but you can do the exercises without the ball.  I did not use the ball, although I do have a bench.~~~~~This 10 DVD set provides excellent instruction on using dumb-bells in a programmed and well structured sequence.  This program is fairly intense and it might take a little while to build up, especially if you are a beginner.  This may be better suited for someone with exercise experience or it may considered an intermediate DVD.All the talent, (men and women demonstrators), are extremely fit and sometimes go fast, on many of the exercises, especially push-ups.  After quite a few months, I find that I can go fast on push-ups too.  On the jumping (plyometrics), I walked in place (slow or fast) or stepped side to side, instead of doing the jumping.  Walking is a lot easier if you have knee or feet issues.Tom Holland is the instructor and he is pleasant, affable and knowledgeable.",5,Excellent workout instruction,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,2986,"['Here', 'are', '10', 'DVDs', 'time', 'outlines.1', 'Chest', 'Back', '32:30', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'warmup', 'ab', 'work', 'core', 'first', 'mini-workout', '4', 'minutes', 'DVDs', 'Tabatha', 'Inferno', 'warmup.Workout', '22:14', '22', 'minutes', 'move', 'fast', 'first', 'DVD.Cool-down', '5:57', 'are', 'stretches', '10', 'DVDs', 'have', 'same', 'cool-down.2', 'Ultimate', 'Ball', '40:49', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'Workout', '30:33', 'large', 'Swiss', 'ball', 'just', 'did', 'ball.Cool-down', '5:57', ':3', 'Tabata', 'Inferno', '43:42', 'Warmup', 'only', 'DVD', 'warmup', 'included', 'main', 'workout.Workout', '37:45', 'hate', 'one', 'long', 'tough', 'moderate', 'tough', 'aerobics', 'weight', 'training', 'exercises', 'include', 'jumping', 'variations', 'core', 'work', 'circuits', 'never', 'seem', 'end.Cool-down', '5:57', ':4', 'Shoulders', 'Arms', '43:05', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'Workout', '32:49', 'Cool-down', '5:57', ':5', 'Cardio', 'Challenge', '41:22', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'Workout', '31:06', 'favorite', 'Moderate', 'weights', 'are', 'used', 'boost', 'calorie', 'burn', 'general', 'alternate', '30', 'seconds', 'aerobics', 'followed', '30', 'seconds', 'rest', 'followed', '30', 'seconds', 'using', 'moderate', 'weights', 'aerobic', 'fashion', 'followed', '30', 'seconds', 'rest', 'then', 'repeat', 'same', 'pattern.Cool-down', '5:57', ':6', 'Legs', '33:17', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'Workout', '22:51', 'not', 'only', 'leg', 'work', 'ab', 'core', 'work.Cool-down', '5:57', ':7', 'Total', 'Body', '33:33', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'Workout', '23:17', 'Cool-down', '5:57', ':8', 'Core', 'Dynamics', '28:22', 'WarmUp', '4:19', 'Workout', '18:06', 'just', '18', 'minutes', 'shortest', 'workout.Cool-down', '5:57', ':9', 'Back', 'Bi', '56:38', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'Workout', '46:22', 'longest', 'workout', '46', 'minutes.Cool-down', '5:57', ':10', 'Chest', 'Shoulders', 'Tri', '45:18', 'Warmup', '4:19', 'Workout', '34:52', 'Cool-down', '5:57', 'main', 'workouts', 'excluding', 'warmups', 'cool-downs', 'vary', '18', 'minutes', '46', 'minutes', 'many', 'close', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'relatively', 'short', 'workouts.The', 'workouts', 'use', 'dumb-bells', 'large', 'Swiss', 'ball', 'need', 'moderate', 'medium', 'weight', 'dumb-bells', 'can', 'do', 'exercises', 'ball', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'ball', 'do', 'have', 'bench.~~~~~This', '10', 'DVD', 'set', 'excellent', 'instruction', 'using', 'dumb-bells', 'programmed', 'well', 'structured', 'sequence', 'program', 'fairly', 'intense', 'might', 'take', 'little', 'while', 'build', 'up', 'especially', 'are', 'beginner', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'suited', 'someone', 'exercise', 'experience', 'may', 'considered', 'intermediate', 'DVD.All', 'talent', 'men', 'women', 'demonstrators', 'are', 'extremely', 'fit', 'sometimes', 'go', 'fast', 'many', 'exercises', 'especially', 'push-ups', 'quite', 'few', 'months', 'find', 'can', 'go', 'fast', 'push-ups', 'too', 'jumping', 'plyometrics', 'walked', 'place', 'slow', 'fast', 'stepped', 'side', 'side', 'instead', 'doing', 'jumping', 'Walking', 'lot', 'easier', 'have', 'knee', 'feet', 'issues.Tom', 'Holland', 'instructor', 'pleasant', 'affable', 'knowledgeable']",N/A

I was lifting weights 3 or 4 days a week, eating mostly healthy, and running a couple of miles a week. But the P90X commercials caught my attention, and this similar program at just $20 caught my wallet. So I bought it an got started. I was amazed. These workouts drove me into the ground in just 30 minutes. They were far harder than my lifting in the gym. I was dripping with sweat, breathing hard, and my muscles were drained. Better than I had hoped for.I also changed my diet as recommended by their small booklet. I got serious about 6 meals a day, two of them being shakes focusing on protein, fiber, and complex carbs. With this plan I am not hungry and have easily eliminated most of the junk food from my diet. I don't even miss it.My body turned rock hard and the little fat that I had melted away. I was determined to workout almost every day, getting in 6 workouts a week instead of my old routine of 4. In 90 days I had lost 10 pounds and shrunk 2"" in my wait. I thought that was great. But I kept on using the routines. At 180 days I have now lost 20 pounds and 4"" off my waist.
