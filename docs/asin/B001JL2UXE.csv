Some people youve never heard of, or whose presence is questionable (Kim Fowley) pontificate, some in typical fan-boy style, but the movie is so information rich that their blather is tolerable. Some of the musicians (Mothers) interviewed are: drummers Jimmy Carl Black (the indian of the group) and Art Tripp, woodwind player Bunk Gardner, and keyboardist Don Preston. Notably absent in the interviews is Frank Zappa himself. His absence though shifts the focus to the Mothers themselves and it becomes their story. The amount of history, music and fantastic archival footage presented makes this documentary a must see for Zappa and Mothers fans. Even those folks who arent fans or know nothing of the Mothers might become engrossed in the story, its a fairly compelling one and told well enough.",4,A flawed but very interesting bit of history,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,922,"['Very', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'many', 'original', 'Mothers', 'incredible', 'archival', 'footage', 'people', 'youve', 'never', 'heard', 'presence', 'questionable', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'pontificate', 'typical', 'fan-boy', 'style', 'movie', 'so', 'information', 'rich', 'blather', 'tolerable', 'musicians', 'Mothers', 'interviewed', 'are', 'drummers', 'Jimmy', 'Carl', 'Black', 'indian', 'group', 'Art', 'Tripp', 'woodwind', 'player', 'Bunk', 'Gardner', 'keyboardist', 'Don', 'Preston', 'Notably', 'absent', 'interviews', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'absence', 'shifts', 'focus', 'Mothers', 'story', 'amount', 'history', 'music', 'fantastic', 'archival', 'footage', 'presented', 'documentary', 'must', 'see', 'Zappa', 'Mothers', 'fans', 'Even', 'folks', 'who', 'arent', 'fans', 'know', 'nothing', 'Mothers', 'might', 'become', 'engrossed', 'story', 'fairly', 'compelling', 'one', 'told', 'well', 'enough']",N/A
1206382,A2N8NLRSICWPZL,B001JL2UXE,P. Baum,"[60, 63]","In 1967 and 1968 (when I was ""losing status at the high school"") I first heard the Mothers on their brilliant albums ""Absolutely Free"" and ""We'reOnly In It for the Money.""  The words and music of Frank Zappa influenced the way I think more than the Beatles, Bob Dylan or over 18 years ofeducation (?) So when I read about the release of this DVD, I had to get it immediately! The only thing disappointing about it (though it is not surprising) is that there are only snippets of the MOI onstage.  (What I would give for a complete '67 Mothers performance at NY's Garrick Theatre!)  But the good news is that those who tell the story of the original Mothers do a very good job, with the contributions of formerMothers Bunk Gardner, Jimmy Carl Black, Artie Tripp and Don Preston being particularly valuable (too bad they couldn't have gotten Roy Estrada, Ian Underwood, Billy Mundi or Ray Collins.)  An in-depth analysis of the Mothers' mid to late-Sixties albums from ""Freak Out"" to ""Uncle Meat"" isvery well done, with lots of newly revealed information and anecdotes.One of the music critics states that this was the best group of musicians that Zappa ever assembled.  Well J.C. Black was no Terry Bozzio and Don Preston was no George Duke or Tommy Mars, but, in spirit, maybe they were after all.  To this day, I feel that Zappa's most memorable andiconoclastic music was done with the original Mothers - one critic even suggests that Zappa's music since the late-Sixties was basically a recycling of the ideas he expressed on those great records.  That may be going a bit too far, but those first five or six Mothers albums will always be the ones I go back to first.  And the members of Frank's band were important components in making the albums and performaces so groundbreaking.  These guys were real characters and added so much to the Mothers' output.  Especially touching are the words of Jimmy Carl Black (particularly since he passed away recently.)  Jimmy Carl clearly loved Frank Zappa and his creativity.  But he also makes clear that Zappa was often very demanding and difficult to work with.  And after some 35 years,he is still very hurt that Frank broke up the band at a time when the members interviewed say that the band was peaking.  But he also says that he is still buzzed about playing with the ""best rock and roll band there ever was.""  And about that, he just might be correct.  I would recommend this to all Zappa fans, especially the ones whose first exposure to Frank Zappa was ""Don't Eat the Yellow Snow"" or ""Dinah-Moe Humm.""  This DVD offers an excellent history lesson into the first years of a musical genius.",4,Very good history of Zappa's best period,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,2642,"['1967', '1968', 'when', 'was', 'losing', 'status', 'high', 'school', 'first', 'heard', 'Mothers', 'brilliant', 'Absolutely', 'Free', ""We'reOnly"", 'Money', 'words', 'music', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'influenced', 'way', 'think', 'more', 'Beatles', 'Bob', 'Dylan', '18', 'years', 'ofeducation', 'when', 'read', 'release', 'DVD', 'had', 'get', 'immediately', 'only', 'thing', 'disappointing', 'not', 'surprising', 'are', 'only', 'snippets', 'MOI', 'onstage', 'What', 'would', 'give', 'complete', 'Mothers', 'performance', 'NY', 'Garrick', 'Theatre', 'good', 'news', 'who', 'tell', 'story', 'original', 'Mothers', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'contributions', 'formerMothers', 'Bunk', 'Gardner', 'Jimmy', 'Carl', 'Black', 'Artie', 'Tripp', 'Don', 'Preston', 'being', 'particularly', 'valuable', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'Roy', 'Estrada', 'Ian', 'Underwood', 'Billy', 'Mundi', 'Ray', 'Collins', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'Mothers', 'mid', 'late-Sixties', 'albums', 'Freak', 'Out', 'Uncle', 'Meat', 'isvery', 'well', 'done', 'lots', 'newly', 'revealed', 'information', 'anecdotes.One', 'music', 'critics', 'was', 'best', 'group', 'musicians', 'Zappa', 'ever', 'assembled', 'Well', 'J.C.', 'Black', 'was', 'Terry', 'Bozzio', 'Don', 'Preston', 'was', 'George', 'Duke', 'Tommy', 'Mars', 'spirit', 'maybe', 'were', 'day', 'feel', 'Zappa', 'most', 'memorable', 'andiconoclastic', 'music', 'was', 'done', 'original', 'Mothers', 'one', 'critic', 'even', 'Zappa', 'music', 'late-Sixties', 'was', 'basically', 'recycling', 'ideas', 'expressed', 'great', 'records', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'first', 'five', 'six', 'Mothers', 'albums', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'ones', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'members', 'Frank', 'band', 'were', 'important', 'components', 'making', 'albums', 'performaces', 'so', 'groundbreaking', 'guys', 'were', 'real', 'characters', 'added', 'so', 'much', 'Mothers', 'output', 'Especially', 'touching', 'are', 'words', 'Jimmy', 'Carl', 'Black', 'particularly', 'passed', 'away', 'recently', 'Jimmy', 'Carl', 'clearly', 'loved', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'creativity', 'also', 'clear', 'Zappa', 'was', 'often', 'very', 'demanding', 'difficult', 'work', '35', 'years', 'still', 'very', 'hurt', 'Frank', 'broke', 'up', 'band', 'time', 'when', 'members', 'interviewed', 'say', 'band', 'was', 'peaking', 'also', 'still', 'buzzed', 'playing', 'best', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'there', 'ever', 'was', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'correct', 'would', 'recommend', 'Zappa', 'fans', 'especially', 'ones', 'first', 'exposure', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'was', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Eat', 'Yellow', 'Snow', 'Dinah-Moe', 'Humm', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'history', 'lesson', 'first', 'years', 'musical', 'genius']",N/A
1206383,A255E1L105V4MU,B001JL2UXE,Robert Carlberg,"[0, 0]","Jimmy Carl Black (R.I.P.) states in his opinion the '60s MoI were the best band in the world, period.  Every night they played a different show, with a repertoire of over 300 songs and no set list.  In between the regular songs they'd perform skits and lampoon the news of the day, then spontaneously burst into a song without planning.  Playing together constantly -- six days per week, up to three shows per day -- then rehearsing excessively when they weren't on stage -- made this 8-to-10-piece ensemble preternaturally tight.  Bunk, Ray, Roy, Ian, Motorhead, Don, Artie, Billy, Jim and Frank WERE one hell of a live band (1964-1969), no matter how much Frank slagged them in later years.This disc of contemporary interviews (with surviving members) and period clips of the band performing make Jimmy's point abundantly clear.  For many of us the ""classic lineup"" was the best lineup, because for us the MoI were much more than just ""Frank's band,"" they were characters and geniuses in their own right.  As proven by the subsequent reunions as ""The Grandmothers"" (without Frank) they could tear up a stage long after Frank unceremoniously dumped them.""This film is not authorised by the estate or family of Frank Zappa"" which is why it is the true story, warts and all, instead of one of the bowdlerized histories being peddled by Gail.

King ""Sam King""","[4, 4]","I remember, a young lad of 16, living in rural Canada, picking up a copy of Absolutely free based entirely on its weird looking cover and....it literally changed my life. Being an outsider myself, I finally found a group of people I could identify with. Musically, Zappa of this period was, yes shocking, but more than that, it was an original work which the beatles' Sgt pepper could only dream of being. I soon recognized that this guy, Zappa, was a serious musician. And...who the Hell is ""Edgar varese""? This led me to get into music seriously, eventually studying formally and becoming a music teacher. Absolutely free is where it started for me.This DVD provides a good overview of the period of these formative albums. particularly interesting were the interviews with Jimmy Carl Black. My only regret is, because it is not an ""official release"" there were no interviews with Frank himself. Also, it would have been interesting to get Clapton's take on his participation (words) on ""We're only in it for the money"".They say one can never go back to one's youth.
