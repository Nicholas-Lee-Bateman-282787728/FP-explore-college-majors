However there are so many well-done, blooper shows out there now that are more refined.  I bought this to introduce WM to my kids (ages 6-10), whom I am just getting into skiing.  Problems: 1.) They rarely laughed 2.)There were some inappropriate moments (2nd scene has bikini races, ""Family that skis...B1t@hes at each other"") and 3.) the two films share a lot of material so watched back to back is a little boring.  Sorry Warren, but I think my next ski-film $ will be going to Greg S...I was hoping to show the kids somthing to get them excited about skiing the next day and I think all I did was remind them how old I am.",3,Dated,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,731,"['used', 'love', 'Warren', 'Miller', 'movies', 'grew', 'ski', 'town', 'were', 'video', 'stores', 'shelf', 'However', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'well-done', 'blooper', 'out', 'there', 'now', 'are', 'more', 'refined', 'bought', 'introduce', 'WM', 'kids', '6-10', 'whom', 'am', 'just', 'getting', 'skiing', 'Problems', '1', 'rarely', 'laughed', '2', 'were', 'inappropriate', 'moments', '2nd', 'scene', 'bikini', 'races', 'Family', 'skis', 'B1t', '@', 'hes', 'other', '3', 'two', 'films', 'share', 'lot', 'material', 'so', 'watched', 'back', 'back', 'little', 'boring', 'Sorry', 'Warren', 'think', 'next', 'ski-film', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'Greg', 'S', 'was', 'hoping', 'show', 'kids', 'somthing', 'get', 'excited', 'skiing', 'next', 'day', 'think', 'did', 'was', 'remind', 'how', 'old', 'am']","Warren Miller's Bloopers, Blunders and Bailouts"

I picked this up to watch in the apartment and the bar during the ski trips.  Perfect for both venues.  Although we'll be skiing Europe and many of the people in the bar won't understand the narration, it really doesn't matter.  It's the agony of defeat that comes across best in these videos.  Thrills and spills a-plenty.The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that much of the material in Skiing Bloopers comes from Winter Bloopers 3.  And what doesn't come from Winter Bloopers 3 really isn't that hysterical, except for the sumo skiers.  Yep, you read that right!But this entire disk isn't made for deep thought, so pick it up and enjoy it for the entertainment value.
