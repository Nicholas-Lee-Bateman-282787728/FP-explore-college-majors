And you do need different singers while going from She's Leaving Home(a fantastic performance by Zander) to Mr. Kite. But while Zander is in McCartney's league as a vocalist, Ian Ball leaves a lot to be desired. Lovely Rita and When I'm 64 would have come off a lot better if sung by Zander as well.

Amith (kndy),"[3, 4]","With the re-release of the Beatles album and of course the Beatles Rock Band video game, I was surprise to see that Cheap Trick released an album with their interpretation of the classic songs from the Beatles eighth album ""Sgt. Pepper's Lone Hearts Club Band"" and a few songs from the Beatles 17th album ""Abbey Road"".  Having grown up with Cheap Trick playing in my household during the 70's and 80's, I was definitely curious about checking out this album and seeing how the band was able to pull of those classic hits.The band which consists of Robin Zander (lead vocalist/rhythm guitar), Rick Nielsen (lead guitar/vocals), Tom Petersson (bass and vocals) and Bun E. Carlos (Drums) teamed up with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra to do their rendition the Beatles classic songs from the album and for the most part, did a pretty good job.  But most importantly, they add their own personal style to the music but yet keeping the soul of the original song in tact.  Not once during the album did I cringe, the performances were quite solid and overall, ""Sgt. Pepper Live"" is an enjoyable live album.Robin Zander does a great job at vocals and the music by the band and to hear their slight musical twists to the original songs are pretty solid.  From Petersson's bass playing on ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", the harmony for ""With a Little Help from My Friends"", the awesome dynamics of the band in ""A Day in the Life"" and of course, the New York philharmonic gel'ing with the band on ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and the other tracks was absolutely fantastic!Overall, for Cheap Trick fans, ""Sgt. Pepper Live"" is just an entertaining album of a rock band doing their own musical rendition and cover of popular Beatles tracks but also, bringing that excitement to their national and upcoming International tour.

Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[3, 3]","Cheap Trick's fans have compared them to The Beatles for decades, but the band members themselves gently scoff at the notion.  But there is perhaps no better American band than Cheap Trick to pull of a Beatles tribute of this magnitude  (except maybe for a Beatles tribute band, of which there are several, but it wouldn't be the same as this kind of tribute).For a band whose members all hover somewhere around the age of 60, these card-carrying AARP members are one of the tightest and most solid bands still rockin'.  Vocalist Robin Zander truly is the man of a thousand voices, and he and the boys do a near-perfect note-for-note rendering of a classic album.  You never forget it is The Beatles and you never forget it is Cheap Trick.  The mesh is seamless.Joan Osborne joins as a back-up vocalist and takes lead on ""Lovely Rita"".  Despite another reviewer's dissatisfaction with that, I thought it was very well done.The band is backed by an orchestra not quite as large as the one that backed them at the Hollywood Bowl in L.A. when they did this show before, but it is ample enough to get the job done.  The fellow who engineered the original Sgt Pepper album back in the 60's was a participant in this project as well, and the band testifies that it makes all the difference.Following the album's last track, the band does the medley that closes the ""Abbey Road"" album, and it is just as stellar and precise as the material from SPLHCB.The running time is short, but the disc price is low.

That fact is certainly not lost on Cheap Trick who has always worn their love of The Beatles close to the vest.  That said, it still takes some ""big ones"" to perform an almost by the note tribute concert to that landmark.  In lesser hands this would pale, but in the world of latter day Cheap Trick it simply is a joy.  With impressive accompaniment by stellar guests and no less than the string section of the New York Philharmonic the performance nears sheer perfection.  A few things stand out.  First, there is Robin Zander's immaculate vocal performance.  Robin has a fantastic range and feel for Beatlesque pop and he is ""spot-on"" here.  Is there a guitar lick that Rick Neilsen can't replicate?  Probably not, at least it isn't in evidence here as he layers meaty six-string goodness throughout.  With all the perfection in the production what stands out is Tom Peterssen's bass playing focusing on the genius of Paul McCartney.  While the bass is seen as an integral part of the rhythm section, McCartney's melodic playing frequently played out as a lead instrument plying the melody as well as tasty flourishes.  Peterssen's bass playing brings this into acute focus.  This concert is both a fitting celebration of what is, perhaps, the greatest rock album of the 20th century as well as a testament to the greatness of Cheap Trick.

The performances on the audio version alone had floored me, particularly ""She's Leaving Home,"" and ""Good Morning Good Morning""; to paraphrase another reviewer on here, Zander's vocal on the former gave me chills. The aggression that he and the rest of the band lend to ""Good Morning"" just about took my head off!That's the deal: All of the members of CT DO take small liberties with the actual parts originally played by the Beatles. What they accomplish, BRILLIANTLY, is capturing the spirit (or, as Tom Petersson says in the DVD interviews, the ""essence"") of these classic (in the most literal sense of the word) songs.Joan Osborne does a GOOD job with ""Lovely Rita'; I'm not sure that Zander couldn't have done it just as well. One of the other guests, Rob Laufer, leads an astonishing rendition of ""Within You Without You'; I don't imagine it being done any better by anybody, anywhere.The things that have me feeling like I've just seen the Dead Sea Scrolls are 1) Robin Zander's voice, and 2) Bun E. Carlos' drumming. Each is a revelation on the CD, but SEEING Zander achieve such intensity in his voice with seeming effortlessness is a thing of beauty. I have seen him/CT perform live before, and felt the same way. Bun E's groove & power surprised me; I had underestimated him as a drummer.I would not ignore the value of Geoff Emerick's contribution to this project. Carlos' drums SOUND like Ringo's, particularly on the ""Abbey Road"" medley. Most of the original ""Sgt. Pepper"" effects and mixes are there, and noticeable to anyone who has studied the music. At least 3 out of the 4 band members acknowledge Mr. Emerick's importance in the interviews.Whether one buys the CD, DVD, or both, this is money well-spent, and ALL proceeds go to prostate cancer research - I wish that the band could find a sponsor, and take this thing on the road.",5,Nothing short of stunning.,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,2032,"['Honestly', 'exaggeration', 'CD', 'DVD', 'had', 'been', 'Wish', 'List', 'time', 'got', 'CD', 'day', 'ago', 'listened', 'decided', 'DVD', 'was', 'must', 'performances', 'audio', 'version', 'alone', 'had', 'floored', 'particularly', 'Leaving', 'Home', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Good', 'Morning', 'paraphrase', 'reviewer', 'here', 'Zander', 'vocal', 'former', 'gave', 'chills', 'aggression', 'rest', 'band', 'lend', 'Good', 'Morning', 'just', 'took', 'head', 'deal', 'members', 'CT', 'DO', 'take', 'small', 'liberties', 'actual', 'parts', 'originally', 'played', 'Beatles', 'What', 'accomplish', 'BRILLIANTLY', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'Tom', 'Petersson', 'DVD', 'interviews', 'essence', 'classic', 'most', 'literal', 'sense', 'word', 'songs.Joan', 'Osborne', 'GOOD', 'job', 'Lovely', 'Rita', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Zander', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'other', 'guests', 'Rob', 'Laufer', 'astonishing', 'rendition', ""'"", 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'being', 'done', 'better', 'anybody', 'anywhere.The', 'things', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'Dead', 'Sea', 'Scrolls', 'are', '1', 'Robin', 'Zander', 'voice', '2', 'Bun', 'E.', 'Carlos', 'drumming', 'revelation', 'CD', 'SEEING', 'Zander', 'achieve', 'such', 'intensity', 'voice', 'seeming', 'effortlessness', 'thing', 'beauty', 'have', 'seen', 'him/CT', 'perform', 'live', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'Bun', 'E', 'groove', 'power', 'surprised', 'had', 'underestimated', 'drummer.I', 'would', 'not', 'ignore', 'value', 'Geoff', 'Emerick', 'contribution', 'project', 'Carlos', 'drums', 'SOUND', 'Ringo', 'particularly', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'medley', 'Most', 'original', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'effects', 'mixes', 'are', 'there', 'noticeable', 'anyone', 'who', 'studied', 'music', 'least', '3', '4', 'band', 'members', 'acknowledge', 'Mr.', 'Emerick', 'importance', 'interviews.Whether', 'one', 'CD', 'DVD', 'money', 'well-spent', 'ALL', 'proceeds', 'go', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'research', 'wish', 'band', 'could', 'find', 'sponsor', 'take', 'thing', 'road']",N/A

Special mention needs to go to Tom Petersen's bass-playing which, to me, was perhaps the most impressive part of the whole concert - he really had his work cut out for him doing Paul's bass parts from that album and he did not disappoint! The end song/encore of ""Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End"" was superb, especially Bun E.'s drum solo. One observance: I thought Rick's guitar sound on ""Good Morning Good Morning"" and ""SPLHCB (Reprise)"" was too soft - it didn't have the sting of the original guitars on The Beatles' classic but I think he was simply trying not to duplicate the record. That aside, this was a great concert with Robin in fine voice, and the backing band and full orchestra doing an awesome job.

1267301,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B002G1WPGS,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[13, 13]","Cheap Trick has never shied away from their love of The Beatles. From the early cover of ""Day Tripper"" to making ""Magical Mystery Tour"" to lone new cut on their original Greatest Hits CD, Robin Zander, Tom Peterssen, Bun E Carlos and Rick Nielsen could knock 'em out like nobody's business. But to recreate the landmark Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album as a live (for charity) event, played from start to finish? That takes some Ernie Ball strings of steel.The surprise is just how well Cheap Trick pulls this off. From the instantly familiar power of the opening chords to the fun Abbey Road encore medley, the band starts strong, works it hard and finishes solid. Guest performers Joan Osborne gives a twist to ""Lovely Rita,"" and Rob Laugher channeling George Harrison for ""Within You Without You"" is one of many highlights here. The recreation of George's sitar here is jawdroppingly good.The band and their pals all look like they're having a blast doing this, but they're taking it dead serious, too. Geoff Emerick, The Beatles' original engineer, was brought in for the sound. The NY Philharmonic fleshes out the orchestral parts (along with Zander's vocals, you'll get goose bumps during ""She's Leaving Home""). Almost all the musical intricacies of the original album are brought out (at least the ones that aren't sound effects, anyways), and Tom just flat-nails McCartney's bass parts. The camerawork is well done, with only minor moments of short-attention span editing. Suprisingly, there's almost no between song patter. Instaed, the band includes a bonus featurette where each trickster talks about the influence of ""Sgt Pepper"" on the Cheap Trick world.""Sgt Pepper Live"" could have been a train wreck of pigpile proportions, but Cheap Trick makes it work. The songs are faithfully Beatles, but the sound is unmistakably Cheap Trick. For a band that has long been out of the limelight (their 16th studio album,The Latest, is way better than you'd expect), ""Sgt Pepper Live"" avoids the pratfall of sounding like a cover band and shows that rock and reverence aren't always mutually exclusive.",4,Their production will be second to none,1260576000,"12 12, 2009",2009,2115,"['Cheap', 'Trick', 'never', 'shied', 'away', 'love', 'Beatles', 'early', 'cover', 'Day', 'Tripper', 'making', 'Magical', 'Mystery', 'Tour', 'lone', 'new', 'cut', 'original', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'CD', 'Robin', 'Zander', 'Tom', 'Peterssen', 'Bun', 'E', 'Carlos', 'Rick', 'Nielsen', 'could', 'knock', 'out', 'nobody', 'business', 'recreate', 'landmark', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Lonely', 'Hearts', 'Club', 'Band', 'album', 'live', 'charity', 'event', 'played', 'start', 'finish', 'Ernie', 'Ball', 'strings', 'steel.The', 'surprise', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'off', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'power', 'opening', 'chords', 'fun', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'encore', 'medley', 'band', 'strong', 'hard', 'finishes', 'solid', 'Guest', 'performers', 'Joan', 'Osborne', 'twist', 'Lovely', 'Rita', 'Rob', 'Laugher', 'channeling', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Within', 'one', 'many', 'highlights', 'here', 'recreation', 'George', 'sitar', 'here', 'jawdroppingly', 'good.The', 'band', 'pals', 'look', ""'re"", 'having', 'blast', 'doing', ""'re"", 'taking', 'dead', 'serious', 'too', 'Geoff', 'Emerick', 'Beatles', 'original', 'engineer', 'was', 'brought', 'sound', 'NY', 'Philharmonic', 'out', 'orchestral', 'parts', 'Zander', 'vocals', ""'ll"", 'get', 'goose', 'bumps', 'Leaving', 'Home', 'musical', 'intricacies', 'original', 'album', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'least', 'ones', 'are', ""n't"", 'sound', 'effects', 'anyways', 'Tom', 'just', 'flat-nails', 'McCartney', 'bass', 'parts', 'camerawork', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'minor', 'moments', 'short-attention', 'span', 'editing', 'Suprisingly', 'almost', 'song', 'patter', 'Instaed', 'band', 'bonus', 'featurette', 'where', 'trickster', 'talks', 'influence', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'world', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Live', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'train', 'wreck', 'pigpile', 'proportions', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'work', 'songs', 'are', 'faithfully', 'Beatles', 'sound', 'unmistakably', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'band', 'long', 'been', 'limelight', '16th', 'studio', 'album', 'Latest', 'way', 'better', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'Live', 'pratfall', 'sounding', 'cover', 'band', 'rock', 'reverence', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'mutually', 'exclusive']",N/A

Pepper"" full-album replay (CD also available) is a very good document of the NY benefit concert staging of the same show that I saw in LA at the Hollywood Bowl around 2 years ago (I think the only difference was that we had Aimee Mann at the LA show).  The DVD only runs about 65 minutes (including the 15 minute interview with the band, the whole Sgt. Pepper album performance and the excellent ""Golden Slumbers"" medley from Abbey Road to finish the live segment) but the price is pretty fair.  Sound is good (Geoff Emerick co-produced this, and had personally engineered several of the tribute shows, including the one I saw); picture is good, but as with a lot of stuff these days, the edits are too MTV-fast style, which gets distracting.  The band is in fine form, with good support - horns and string sections, Ian Ball from Gomez is quite good on the couple of tunes he sings lead/co-lead on; Joan Osborne sings lead on ""Lovely Rita"" (a woman singing to a woman?), and Rob Laufer turns in a vocal that is nearly a dead ringer for George, on ""Within You, Without You"" (which I never really cared for on the original LP, but his vocal and tabla/strings on this are so good live, that it had me reconsidering).  I'd have preferred a DVD shot at the Hollywood Bowl show/series that I attended (which had the Hollywood Bowl band - it was an awesome show) but this one from the Waldorf Astoria in NY is very good (and it benefits Michael Milken's prostate cancer charity, so it's for a good cause).",4,nice document of the NY show (I saw the LA-Hollywood Bowl one),1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,1530,"['DVD', 'Cheap', 'Trick', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'full-album', 'replay', 'CD', 'also', 'available', 'very', 'good', 'document', 'NY', 'benefit', 'concert', 'staging', 'same', 'show', 'saw', 'LA', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'think', 'only', 'difference', 'was', 'had', 'Aimee', 'Mann', 'LA', 'show', 'DVD', 'only', '65', 'minutes', 'including', '15', 'minute', 'interview', 'band', 'whole', 'Sgt', 'Pepper', 'album', 'performance', 'excellent', 'Golden', 'Slumbers', 'medley', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'finish', 'live', 'segment', 'price', 'pretty', 'fair', 'Sound', 'good', 'Geoff', 'Emerick', 'co-produced', 'had', 'personally', 'engineered', 'several', 'tribute', 'shows', 'including', 'one', 'saw', 'picture', 'good', 'lot', 'stuff', 'days', 'edits', 'are', 'too', 'MTV-fast', 'style', 'distracting', 'band', 'fine', 'form', 'good', 'support', 'horns', 'string', 'sections', 'Ian', 'Ball', 'Gomez', 'quite', 'good', 'couple', 'tunes', 'lead/co-lead', 'Joan', 'Osborne', 'sings', 'lead', 'Lovely', 'Rita', 'woman', 'singing', 'woman', 'Rob', 'Laufer', 'vocal', 'nearly', 'dead', 'ringer', 'George', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'original', 'LP', 'vocal', 'tabla/strings', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'live', 'had', 'reconsidering', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'DVD', 'shot', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'attended', 'had', 'Hollywood', 'Bowl', 'band', 'was', 'awesome', 'show', 'one', 'Waldorf', 'Astoria', 'NY', 'very', 'good', 'benefits', 'Michael', 'Milken', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'charity', 'good', 'cause']",N/A
