The story focuses on an innocent young girl who chooses to become an anchoress and how she is treated by the church, the local villagers, and the local reeve (estate manager for a lord) and her innocence and mixed pagan/christian faith.  It is a slow moving story, but it is a rich one.",4,Innocence and Faith in a Time of Change,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,478,"['interesting', 'tale', 'mediaeval', 'christian', 'religious', 'practice', 'anchorites', 'place', 'England', 'period', 'when', 'shift', 'paganism', 'christianity', 'took', 'place', 'story', 'innocent', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'become', 'anchoress', 'how', 'treated', 'church', 'local', 'villagers', 'local', 'reeve', 'estate', 'manager', 'lord', 'innocence', 'mixed', 'pagan/christian', 'faith', 'slow', 'moving', 'story', 'rich', 'one']",N/A

It also does a fair job of representing some pagan views.  This puts everything into a down to earth (no pun intended) perspective of religions view of real life (or lack thereof). It demonstrates many problems that have still not been dealt with by western churches.,5,Humanity and religious dogma,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,443,"['very', 'good', 'good', 'work', 'representing', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'viewpoint', 'women', 'feminine', 'God', 'lack', 'thereof', 'regard', 'Christianity', 'also', 'fair', 'job', 'representing', 'pagan', 'views', 'everything', 'down', 'earth', 'pun', 'intended', 'perspective', 'religions', 'view', 'real', 'life', 'lack', 'thereof', 'many', 'problems', 'have', 'still', 'not', 'been', 'dealt', 'western', 'churches']",N/A

No doubt at that period in time in Feudal Europe, there was a lot of suspicions about the way people displayed themselves. There was also a lot of ignorance as well as stupidity.  As good example of this was when the Mother who hard a difficult time accepting the mixture of Religion as well as local witchcraft ended up being murdered by the towns people by being thrown down a well as they considered her a witch. The Bishop as well as the local Priest added to more ignorance. The acting was relatively OK. The Black and White exposure actually added a lot of interest.

Christine Carpenter (Natalie Morse) is entranced and obsessed with the Virgin Mary. To the dismay of her pagan herbalist mother (Brenda Bertin) and Reeve (Gene Bervoets) who had designs on her, she opts to become an anchoress, being walled up in confinement.  Christine quickly becomes a celebrity offering her divine advice through a window of hope.The priest (Christopher Eccleston) while initially happy becomes irate over Christine's disobedience and visions contrary to teachings. Christine sees Mary's hair as being braided as wheat dressed in a red robe, like an apple. There is a clash between the pagan and Christian worlds.The film is riddled with symbolism and it is an art film.
