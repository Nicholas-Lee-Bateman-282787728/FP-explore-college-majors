It gets boring after three episodes, as the characters repeat the same sentences all over again. Nothing moves they just sit and think. The whole relationship with an alien teacher seem so weird and untrue. Love hina has more comedy moments. I have better things to do then watch this show, let-along buying the collection DVD.",2,"I hate alien teachers, their just stupid",1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,411,"['one', 'worst', 'series', 'ever', 'plot', 'very', 'infantile', 'sadly', 'unfunny', 'boring', 'three', 'episodes', 'characters', 'repeat', 'same', 'sentences', 'over', 'again', 'Nothing', 'moves', 'just', 'sit', 'think', 'whole', 'relationship', 'alien', 'teacher', 'seem', 'so', 'weird', 'untrue', 'Love', 'hina', 'more', 'comedy', 'moments', 'have', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'then', 'watch', 'show', 'let-along', 'buying', 'collection', 'DVD']",Please Teacher

I love the Pocky packaging on the DVD  box and the cd was a huge let down. well not really I didn't expect much from it any way but it would have been nice to have the full length opening and closing themes from the OST. There were some great tracks laid down for this show. I also carried over well into English and the voice actors were great. I ate it up. Please more!,5,Great Show way out there,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,425,"['love', 'show', 'thanks', 'show', 'lovePocky', 'love', 'Pocky', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'box', 'cd', 'was', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'full', 'length', 'opening', 'closing', 'themes', 'OST', 'were', 'great', 'tracks', 'laid', 'down', 'show', 'also', 'carried', 'over', 'well', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'great', 'ate', 'up', 'Please', 'more']",Please Teacher
936231,A10U58PHFDK81C,B000B5XP0G,The Anime  Adict,"[11, 12]","Please Teacher is the best romance comedies to come out since Love Hina. The show is about Kie  who has a slight problem. He has a condition where in he enters into a state of suspended animation whenever he is stressed or depressed. One time his condition hits so hard that he was in that state for three years. Though by the end of the second ep you may think this is just a gimmik to allow him to marry his teacher, I'll get to that, its not really and is used quiet skillfully threw out the series. Meet Meazuhoe an alien, who has come to earth to observe our civilization. Kie finds out Meazuho's secret and one thing leads to another until finally they end up married. I know what your thinking porn coming. Your wrong for the most part. This is actually a sweet series that though is does have its perverted moment, especially the last ep, is actually quiet innocent. The touching story, perviness aside, about a guy with a unquic condition that ends up getting married to a complete stranger and how they fall in love. I found myself actually liking the characters and caring about them. When something sad happened I actually felt sad as well. No character is left out in the cold and each has a reason for being the way they are. The animation is some of the best I've seen, the music is wonderful and the story worth listening. This series is so good that its hard to describe just how good it is. Simply if your wondering about buying this series or not if you want heart stopping action or ground shattering mysteries or ultra pervfest then keep going. If you are looking for a good love story with slight perviness that is enjoyable with more then a few laughs and gets you actually feeling about the characters and can watch with your girl then buy this one. Also out of the three possible collections buy this one, yes it's not the cheapest but it comes with the soundtrack for the series for free, filled of good music, as well as post cards and other extras.",5,Wish school was this much fun,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,1976,"['Please', 'Teacher', 'best', 'romance', 'comedies', 'come', 'out', 'Love', 'Hina', 'show', 'Kie', 'who', 'slight', 'problem', 'condition', 'where', 'state', 'suspended', 'animation', 'whenever', 'stressed', 'depressed', 'One', 'time', 'condition', 'hits', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'state', 'three', 'years', 'end', 'second', 'ep', 'may', 'think', 'just', 'gimmik', 'allow', 'marry', 'teacher', ""'ll"", 'get', 'not', 'really', 'used', 'quiet', 'skillfully', 'threw', 'out', 'series', 'Meet', 'Meazuhoe', 'alien', 'who', 'come', 'earth', 'observe', 'civilization', 'Kie', 'out', 'Meazuho', 'secret', 'one', 'thing', 'finally', 'end', 'up', 'married', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'porn', 'coming', 'wrong', 'most', 'part', 'actually', 'sweet', 'series', 'have', 'perverted', 'moment', 'especially', 'last', 'ep', 'actually', 'quiet', 'innocent', 'touching', 'story', 'perviness', 'aside', 'guy', 'unquic', 'condition', 'up', 'getting', 'married', 'complete', 'stranger', 'how', 'fall', 'love', 'found', 'actually', 'liking', 'characters', 'caring', 'When', 'something', 'sad', 'happened', 'actually', 'felt', 'sad', 'well', 'character', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'reason', 'being', 'way', 'are', 'animation', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'music', 'wonderful', 'story', 'worth', 'listening', 'series', 'so', 'good', 'hard', 'describe', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'Simply', 'wondering', 'buying', 'series', 'not', 'want', 'heart', 'stopping', 'action', 'ground', 'shattering', 'mysteries', 'ultra', 'pervfest', 'then', 'keep', 'going', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'slight', 'perviness', 'enjoyable', 'more', 'then', 'few', 'laughs', 'actually', 'feeling', 'characters', 'can', 'watch', 'girl', 'then', 'buy', 'one', 'Also', 'three', 'possible', 'collections', 'buy', 'one', 'not', 'cheapest', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'free', 'filled', 'good', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'post', 'cards', 'other', 'extras']",Please Teacher

The storyline may seem a little discrete from time to time, and the last episode didn't quite seem to fit the rest (the rating of its contents has dramatically elevated towards an M than the earlier ones), but nontheless, this anime series is very entertaining.The CD contains 23 tracks and the music is soothing.Other than the featured media, the package itself contains quite a few art work items, and even the DVD covers are double-sided (yes, please make sure to pull them out of the plastic envelopes and check the hidden sides).But I would suggest you to shop around. Amazon is a bit overpriced.
