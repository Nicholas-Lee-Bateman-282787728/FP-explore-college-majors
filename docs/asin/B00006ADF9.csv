708800,A2217AS45LH3SP,B00006ADF9,Carlo Thomas,"[0, 0]",Gian Carlo Menotti's THE MEDIUM is  one of the great operatic/musical dramas.  The performance off Marie Powers is spell binding!  Anna Maria Alberghetti sings with a pure sweetness that touches your heart.  I have viewed this many times and each time  I have enjoyed the masterful performance of  the entire cast.

708801,A20JM5CT4QK67Y,B00006ADF9,Jay Fenton,"[1, 1]","I remember seeing a 16mm print of this in college in the late 60's, only that version was a minute or two under an hour. The timing was exactly what a performance of the opera would be.  I didn't know at the time that additional footage was shot and used. I was a bit disappointed in the soundtrack which sounded a bit tinny and echo-y to me. I remember thinking that in a movie we should have really good sound, even in 1951. Sound after all can be re-recorded with modern equipment that enhances the fidelity, but I suppose the date of the print I saw was done before that technique came into wider use. The sound on this DVD is identical to the one on that 16mm print.  Somehow I remember the picture being sharper, but maybe that's just my aging memory. The added footage on the DVD was interesting, but the shorter version I saw seemed tighter and more satisfying.  In any event, I guess we're lucky to have anything on this title, but from my perspective today the presentation seems like pure film noir.  Thank God someone preserved material on this very unique film.",5,"A Tale of Two ""Mediums""",1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1074,"['remember', 'seeing', '16mm', 'print', 'college', 'late', '60', 'only', 'version', 'was', 'minute', 'two', 'hour', 'timing', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'performance', 'opera', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'additional', 'footage', 'was', 'shot', 'used', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'soundtrack', 'sounded', 'bit', 'tinny', 'echo-y', 'remember', 'thinking', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'sound', 'even', '1951', 'Sound', 'can', 'be', 're-recorded', 'modern', 'equipment', 'fidelity', 'suppose', 'date', 'print', 'saw', 'was', 'done', 'technique', 'came', 'wider', 'use', 'sound', 'DVD', 'identical', 'one', '16mm', 'print', 'Somehow', 'remember', 'picture', 'being', 'sharper', 'maybe', 'just', 'aging', 'memory', 'added', 'footage', 'DVD', 'was', 'interesting', 'shorter', 'version', 'saw', 'seemed', 'tighter', 'more', 'satisfying', 'event', 'guess', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'have', 'anything', 'title', 'perspective', 'today', 'presentation', 'pure', 'film', 'noir', 'Thank', 'God', 'someone', 'preserved', 'material', 'very', 'unique', 'film']",N/A

The order arrived very quickly and I have watched and again loved the music.  It's a very dark, short opera and Marie Powers is amazing as the Medium.  The most beautiful songs are sung by a very young Albergetti who is lovely as Monica.  I've always had a lump in my throat when Monica sings for Toby who is mute.

The soundtrack had to be remarried to a better print of the film than has ever been seen, though he didn't explain the horizontal ghosting.  I'm definitely going to buy a copy, even if it's not entirely satisfying.As to why there's no audio commentary, Menotti told his biographer that the whole film was essentailly improvised--and what an inspired improv.  Much of the rest of the book commentary was about how he had to direct Powers's every gesture to keep her from camping it up.  I suspect he has little more to say about the film, leaving it forever an enigma.",5,update,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,901,"['talked', 'president', 'VAI', 'said', 'Menotti', 'described', 'efforts', 'quot', 'miracle', 'quot', 'way', 'DVD', 'will', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'given', 'available', 'materials', 'was', 'not', 'mastered', 'VHS', 'previous', 'VHS', 'release', 'apparently', 'was', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'old', 'SP', 'VHS', 'tape', 'good', 'print', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'be', 'remarried', 'better', 'print', 'film', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'horizontal', 'ghosting', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'going', 'buy', 'copy', 'even', 'not', 'entirely', 'satisfying.As', 'why', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Menotti', 'told', 'biographer', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'essentailly', 'improvised', 'what', 'inspired', 'improv', 'Much', 'rest', 'book', 'commentary', 'was', 'how', 'had', 'direct', 'Powers', 'gesture', 'keep', 'camping', 'suspect', 'little', 'more', 'say', 'film', 'leaving', 'forever', 'enigma']",N/A
