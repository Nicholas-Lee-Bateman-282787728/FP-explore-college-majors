It just shows how un sympathetic coaches and the higher above can be. The girl becomes bulemic/anerexic and this happens all the time. The body can't starve. Young girls don't understand this. I felt it was a good movie to watch.,5,"worth watching, with a sad story, based on truth",1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,350,"['movie', 'really', 'sad', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'celebrity', 'professional', 'athlete', 'based', 'what', 'saw', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'un', 'sympathetic', 'coaches', 'higher', 'can', 'be', 'girl', 'bulemic/anerexic', 'time', 'body', 'ca', ""n't"", 'starve', 'Young', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A

Andy is a pefectly healthy girl with ambitions to become an olympic gymnist.  She begins to reach for this goal, with the help of a new coach.

I found it disappointing that even though many people were saying how she was ""too thin"". The only thing different about her was the makeup on her face to make her appear gaunt and malnourished.Overall the movie was okay but I could only watch it once.",3,It Was Okay,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,451,"['had', 'bought', 'movie', 'DVD', 'Dying', 'be', 'thin', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch.Perfect', 'Body', 'girl', 'athlete', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'world', 'eating', 'disorders', 'found', 'disappointing', 'even', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'saying', 'how', 'was', 'too', 'thin', 'only', 'thing', 'different', 'was', 'makeup', 'face', 'make', 'appear', 'gaunt', 'malnourished.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'could', 'only', 'watch', 'once']",N/A
831751,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,B0002EJ7K8,Frodo,"[41, 43]","This film was shown as mid-day movie on a weekday when I was sick from work. Usually the movies shown in that particular timeslot are incredibly shocking and simply make you want to fall asleep.Convinced this was just another one of those movies I held very low expectations for this film. However, what started out as a boring afternoon in bed, turned into a compelling two hours that gripped me and drew me in. ""Perfect Body"" was no ordinary fill-in movie, but a beautifully crafted tale which scarily enough is very truthful to the ways of many teenagers in real life.Andy is thrilled when she is given the chance to build from her talents as a gymnist and is set on the road towards the olympics. but her first training session starts off with every girl's nightmare: she is weighed infront of the whole class and critisised for being ""overweight"". the pressure of wanting to be the best overwhelmes Andy and she begins starving herself and exercising compulsively - convinced that this is the only way to achieve success. As her eating disorder worsens, it consumes Andy, and has an impact on her relationships with her boyfriend, friends and parents. Andy must stop punishing her body before it's too late to turn back the clock.Amy Jo Johnson is simply captivating as Andy. She captures the wrath of her athletic alter-ego stunningly and puts on a totally believable performance. Throughout the film you can noticably see her character transform from a healthy, happy teenager to a physically sick teenager. Her skin becomes pale and dry and even her hair begins to fall out.There are several gymnastic sequences as well which add as a bonus. The routines are beautifully filmed.And obviously it is aimed to send a very important message to everyone: it doesn't matter how you look outside, so you shouldn't change youreself to fit in with the crowd.At the end of the day, this is no ordinary drama about teenaged angst, but a reality check. This behaviour in teenaged girls is really happening. ""Perfect Body"" takes us through the long and painful journey of a girl who goes too far.Excellent!",5,a powerful film,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,2101,"['film', 'was', 'shown', 'mid-day', 'movie', 'weekday', 'when', 'was', 'sick', 'work', 'Usually', 'movies', 'shown', 'particular', 'timeslot', 'are', 'incredibly', 'shocking', 'simply', 'make', 'want', 'fall', 'asleep.Convinced', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'held', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', 'However', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'boring', 'afternoon', 'bed', 'turned', 'compelling', 'two', 'hours', 'gripped', 'drew', 'Perfect', 'Body', 'was', 'ordinary', 'fill-in', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'tale', 'scarily', 'enough', 'very', 'truthful', 'ways', 'many', 'teenagers', 'real', 'life.Andy', 'thrilled', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'build', 'talents', 'gymnist', 'set', 'road', 'olympics', 'first', 'training', 'session', 'girl', 'nightmare', 'weighed', 'infront', 'whole', 'class', 'critisised', 'being', 'overweight', 'pressure', 'wanting', 'be', 'best', 'overwhelmes', 'Andy', 'starving', 'exercising', 'compulsively', 'convinced', 'only', 'way', 'achieve', 'success', 'eating', 'disorder', 'worsens', 'Andy', 'impact', 'relationships', 'boyfriend', 'friends', 'parents', 'Andy', 'must', 'stop', 'punishing', 'body', 'too', 'late', 'turn', 'back', 'clock.Amy', 'Jo', 'Johnson', 'simply', 'captivating', 'Andy', 'wrath', 'athletic', 'alter-ego', 'stunningly', 'totally', 'believable', 'performance', 'film', 'can', 'noticably', 'see', 'character', 'transform', 'healthy', 'happy', 'teenager', 'physically', 'sick', 'teenager', 'skin', 'becomes', 'pale', 'dry', 'even', 'hair', 'fall', 'out.There', 'are', 'several', 'gymnastic', 'sequences', 'well', 'add', 'bonus', 'routines', 'are', 'beautifully', 'filmed.And', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'send', 'very', 'important', 'message', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'matter', 'how', 'look', 'outside', 'should', ""n't"", 'change', 'fit', 'crowd.At', 'end', 'day', 'ordinary', 'drama', 'teenaged', 'angst', 'reality', 'check', 'behaviour', 'teenaged', 'girls', 'really', 'happening', 'Perfect', 'Body', 'long', 'painful', 'journey', 'girl', 'who', 'too', 'far.Excellent']",N/A
