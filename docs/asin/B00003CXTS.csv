Unlike many other black / white relationship movies (where the black character moves into a white environment, and we get the white environment's objections to the relationship), this movie shows us the black environment's point of view. Sarah has to adjust to a mostly black environment, for instance. We also get to hear why many black girls won't like seeing one of their 'best guys' dating a white girl.

537726,AYSWADHW28S1A,B00003CXTS,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","I like dance movies. In some (but definitely not all) ways, I think film is better than real life for watching dance, because the camera can bring you closer to the performer and capture the full emotional depth of the performance.Unfortunately, the actual dance performances in ""Save the Last Dance"" (at least the ones by the main character, and especially her climactic dance sequence) were surprisingly flat. I couldn't help but compare the dancing to the much-better White Nights (ASIN 6302862949, sadly not on DVD), Flashdance (ASIN B00005JKG5) or the equally-flawed performances in Fosse (ASIN B00005UQ8F). Of course, in Flashdance, they cheated by having a professional dancer replace Jennifer Beals in the dance sequences, but still, Julia Stiles just doesn't sell the moves, and I kind of wish they had pulled a Flashdance-style substitution for some of the dance sequences.As to the rest of the movie, this was definitely a better-than-average teen flick, though the interracial relationship politcal stuff was a bit heavy handed.

537727,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXTS,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Dancing has become a cinematic phenomenon as of late, with films like `Stomp the Yard' and `You Got Served' being churned out of the movie machines like bunnies from the womb, but sadly just about every one of these so called dance films lacks in every department but the dance moves.  Sure these young actors (if you can call them that) can cut a rug but the storylines and overall acting in these productions are downright awful.  Rewind back a few years though and you'll find that not every dancing film is entirely lacking.  In 2001 MTV put out a film called `Save the Last Dance', a film that did quite well and still to this day holds up against the onslaught of inferior copycat films.  What these films lack `Save the Last Dance' embraces.  Sure it has its share of hang ups and set backs for I'm not saying it's perfect but it tries much harder than the films of late and it provides a decent and well rounded script with characters we can care about.The film follows ballet dancer Sara Johnson as her life is upended by the sudden death of her mother.  To make matters worse Sara blames herself for her mother's death (she died racing to watch her daughter audition for Juilliard) and swears never to embrace ballet again.  She is forced to move in with her father following the death and this changes her life drastically.  Her father is a bit less well off then her mother was and Sara lacks much respect for him.  She also must change schools, and being the proper white girl that she is she finds it very difficult to adjust to a predominantly all black school.  That is until she meets Chenille and her brother Derek.  Chenille welcomes Sara into her circle and shows her the ropes, making her feel comfortable instead of out of place and Derek eventually makes his way into her heart and helps her find her love of dance once again.The film, while focusing on the dancing, spends equal time fleshing out the characters on the screen.  The cast is an impressive list of young stars, and I think this is another reason this film is far superior to the dance movies of late.  Instead of casting rising musical talents like Chris Brown as the lead this film has a solid cast of young actors who know how to act.  Sean Patrick Thomas is great as Derek.  He embodies his character extremely well, balancing the misplaced loyalty to his childhood friend Malakai with his determination to make his life better than would be expected.  I also really liked Bianca Lawson's performance as Derek's ex-girlfriend Nikki.  She had that perfect mixture of kattyness and sexuality.And what ever happened to Julia Stiles?  This movie should have made her a star.  I mean sure, I understand that Jessica Alba is physical perfection but the sheer fact that she gets more work than Stiles is a sin against humanity.  As Sara Julia brilliantly delivers emotion after emotion and elevates the film.  I really want to see more of this girl.  But when speaking of the cast there is one name and one name only that resonates forever with me.  Kerry Washington.  As Chenille she is effortlessly entertaining and completely memorable, best in show.  Washington is on the top of my list of my favorite young actors who I crave to see more of.  She has so much talent, so much potential.The film is not without its low points.  It is a tad bit predictable, well not a tad, and it does fall into the same clich&eacute;d stereotypes that most films of this nature come into.  Prejudice is addressed, but I actually felt the way it was broached here was a bit refreshing.  It expressed a real concern for the African American community, at least in those city areas, and I felt it was dealt with nicely.  It broaches many concerns of people in those types of communities, whether it be gang violence or single parent families.  This has all been done before.  Regardless it never takes away from the entertainment value of the film.  I still love this film to this day and watch it regularly.  Sure, it's no Oscar winner but it should have served as a foundation for the dancing films that followed.

The racial stuff about black and white relationships. I liked the acting, both Julia Stiles and her leading man, Sean Patrick Thomas. The rest of the cast all did a good job, too. I think the weakness of the film was that the hip hop music and dancing is just not very interesting. There wasn't a single memorable song on the soundtrack. I like the ballet sequences and Julia's contemporary dance for her Julliard audition, but the dancing in the club was very lackluster. You got the feeling that dance was something that was important to their community, something that they enjoyed, but it wasn't that great to watch it. I liked the scenes where Sean Patrick Thomas was showing Julia the latest dance styles though because I needed the explanations to understand what the h they were doing. I wasn't seeing it in Steps, the dance club where they would go.Comparisons: In Saturday Night Fever, the Disco Dancing sequences in the club were exciting. The Bee Gees music was very memorable and in fact the tunes were bona fide hits. STLD songs were throwaways, and dance scenes were not all that.Both STLD and Flashdance end with a similar dance audition. I think I liked the Julia Stiles audition dance better than Jennifer Beals' but again, throughout the film, the dance sequences and music were much better in Flashdance. If you look at Jennifer's dance to Maniac on the Dance Floor, she is really just running in place with close-ups on her rear. But it works. Julia Stiles is no J Lo in the back end department.8 Mile was not a dance movie, but it did have rap music. 8 Mile presented a much more solid case for rap than STLD did for Hip Hop. The sound track for 8 Mile was outstanding, with breakout songs from 50 Cent, and some of Eminem's best stuff ever. ""Lose Yourself"" was a really good song. It didn't win a Grammy but I think it did win an Oscar. Fact checkers? I am thinking that happened because at the time I wondered why the Grammies had no love for Eminem when the Oscars did.In some ways this was about being the only White Girl in a Black High School, or at least about having to fit in at a new High School. There is even the obligatory scene where she goes to the cafeteria and has to figure out where to sit, sits with the nerds, and has to be rescued by Sean Patrick Thomas' sister. Flashback to Mean Girls and maybe even Clueless? Fact Checkers? I had that feeling of Deja Vu all over again, and I bet there are more examples of this type of situation in teen films.The Black Swan also had ballet as one of the major themes, but in that Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis both really put a lot of time and effort into learning ballet and preparing for their roles. Julia Stiles did OK, though, but not even close to Nat and Mila.I must say that I think the character of her father was largely wasted. He was supposed to be a jazz musician, therefore he lived in the Black part of Chicago, where of course, the Blacks all support jazz clubs by vigorously staying home in droves or hanging out at Steps. It was a very poorly thought out excuse to get Julia Stiles into the hood. But as long as we had her father supposedly a trumpet player, we could have had her go and listen to him play at least once, or perhaps take Sean Patrick Thomas out to hear him and meet her dad. It makes me mad that jazz is ignored when such a fuss is made over mediocre Hip Hop music. Do these kids even know who Miles Davis is? Sad.So, The Bottom Line is that it was an OK but not great movie. I might have been comparing apples to oranges, but the weakest aspect of STLD was the lackluster Hip Hop music, and if there is any great genius of Hip Hop out there, STLD was a wasted opportunity to showcase him or her, and both could have benefited from that collaboration.",3,Julia?

537743,A2DZ73ZOTXXZEJ,B00003CXTS,Dani Goodnight,"[2, 2]","Ballet is tricky. It is, after all, 'high art', not instantly accessible or naturally multiplex-enticing. So it is wonderful that the makers of Save the Last Dance had the guts and intelligence to take the ballet - one of the key narrative and character hooks of the film - seriously. (Unlike the makers of last year's Billy Elliot, supposedly the story of a ballet-dancing hopeful, who were clearly so ashamed of ballet that they gave it virtually no screen time, replacing it with lamely choregraphed tap and, worse, bouncing up and down to hits of the 70s.)Indeed, the makers of Save the Last Dance take everything seriously. For an MTV teen/romantic drama/whatever this film has a gravity I didn't expect. The two hour run-time gives them time to explore the personal worlds the leading characters inhabit, while never using a scene where a line or a look would do. On that count, it's potentially the least patronising, and least slick, story-telling I've seen for months. What no long scenes with characters explaining the plot to each other? And no huge tear-jerking 10 minute death scene for the mother?And with the time they've saved, we get to see dancing. Perhaps somewhat over-edited dancing (we forgive you, MTV) but since when has a recent musical had such quiet but perfect dance numbers as the scenes where Derek teaches Sara? Equally, Sara's final audition piece looks convincing as a ballet/hip-hop meld, rather than the expected hip-hop sugar to help the 'boring stuff' go down.But getting the ballet right made me nervous that the makers would fall down elsewhere. The acting? Well, the central two roles are impeccably and untrickily acted by Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas, with uniformly strong support from the rest of the cast. The writing? The dialogue is pleasingly untalky, short on cliche and long on making every word count, while the plotting is happily old-fashioned in its tendency to give time and attention to airing debate and tying up loose ends. And for once in a long long while, a soundtrack used for texture rather than telling us precisely what we should be feeling for every millisecond of the film.And the final message? Well, in any other movie it would be Derek who 'dances his way out of the ghetto' via ballet (hello Billy Elliott), and Julia Stiles would be off to be the surgeon. So the mere fact that the dancer and the surgeon are the other way round is refreshing. Plus, surprise!, a Hollywood film with a central, natural, black/white couple who sleep together without political fanfare, but do make certain people uncomfortable. It's a film that basically ducks very little, while labouring nothing. And that's what you get for having the courage to take high art seriously on screen.

I also felt the way she did when moving to the city, though my area is DEFINATLY not as rough as Sara [Julia Stiles]'s was.  I thought the acting was done well (Julia was originally a trained Shakesperean Actress) and the Cheoreography was *excellent*  Here is a little fact you might not know: Did you know she isn't actually doing the ballet in the film?  If you notice, the camera never shows her FULL body when she is standing up to tippy toe, just shots of her feet and then her upper body, which was very well done 'cause I didn't even notice (and maybe you won't either!).  Needless to say her Acting was very well done and newcomer Sean Patrick Thomas wasn't too shabby as well.  The club scene just makes one wanna get up and dance.

The whole story is amazing, and there are so many sub-plots; teenage pregnancy, drugs, parent problems, (i.e. splitting, and death,) moving, and relationship.

537756,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B00003CXTS,Furiae,"[8, 9]","First off, I feel compelled to explain my rating system.  I don't hold all movies to the same standard.  Rather, I rate based on whether I feel the movie has achieved its goal or not.  With this in mind, Save The Last Dance has done very well in being a feel-good dance movie that caters to the young generation without at the same time alienating anybody else who doesn't necessarily fit into the MTV mold.I think this movie succeeds at being a little of everything; it's hip, it's accessible, it's got comedy and drama, exciting dance routines, it showcases fine acting talents, and, most of all, it's never corny (cliched at times, yes, but not corny).  I think the biggest success of this film was that it incorporated elements of both black and white cultures in a way that was entertaining without being disrespectful.  It's highly watchable -- I watched it with my entire family and we all enjoyed it immensely.Sean Patrick Thomas steals the show as Derek, the male lead.  He makes a charismatic performance as the young man from the 'hood trying to get into medical school.  His character called for someone who could believably play 1) a boy who grew up in south side and 2) someone intelligent and well-read enough to get into Georgetown to study medicine.  Whether he's hanging out with his friends who aspire to become thugs or debating literature in the classroom, Sean Patrick Thomas pulls off both very believably, which is really what makes his character fly.Julia Stiles, on the other hand, plays the firecracker Sarah who was an aspiring ballerina until the untimely death of her mother, which causes her to move in with her father who lives on the wrong side of the tracks.  Julia Stiles sparkles in this movie, and it was delightful to see her and Thomas play off each other.Each of the supporting cast was well cast, as well.  The dancing, too, was hip, exciting, and well-choreographed.  The dances were well-orchestrated exclamation marks to scenes.  MTV doesn't over-reach in this film and that's what made it work.  They knew what they wanted and they did it well.The genius of this film is the good balances it achieves between so many aspects.  It's cool without alienating non-high schoolers, it's dramatic without being sappy, and it resorts to cliches at times without being corny.  That, combined with the dances and the acting, make this movie a rock-solid feel-good crowd-pleaser.  It's unfair to judge a crowd-pleaser to bio-epics and Oscar-winning dramas and say the former isn't a good movie.  There are different types of movies, and this is one of the better feel-good movies I've seen in a while.",4,Terrific feel-good movie,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,2635,"['First', 'feel', 'compelled', 'explain', 'rating', 'system', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'movies', 'same', 'standard', 'Rather', 'rate', 'based', 'feel', 'movie', 'achieved', 'goal', 'not', 'mind', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'being', 'feel-good', 'dance', 'movie', 'young', 'generation', 'same', 'time', 'alienating', 'anybody', 'else', 'who', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fit', 'MTV', 'mold.I', 'think', 'movie', 'being', 'little', 'everything', 'hip', 'accessible', 'got', 'comedy', 'drama', 'exciting', 'dance', 'routines', 'fine', 'acting', 'talents', 'most', 'never', 'corny', 'cliched', 'times', 'yes', 'not', 'corny', 'think', 'biggest', 'success', 'film', 'was', 'incorporated', 'elements', 'black', 'white', 'cultures', 'way', 'was', 'entertaining', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'highly', 'watchable', 'watched', 'entire', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'immensely.Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'show', 'Derek', 'male', 'lead', 'charismatic', 'performance', 'young', 'man', ""'hood"", 'trying', 'get', 'medical', 'school', 'character', 'called', 'someone', 'who', 'could', 'believably', 'play', '1', 'boy', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'south', 'side', '2', 'someone', 'intelligent', 'well-read', 'enough', 'get', 'Georgetown', 'study', 'medicine', 'hanging', 'out', 'friends', 'who', 'aspire', 'become', 'thugs', 'debating', 'literature', 'classroom', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'very', 'believably', 'really', 'what', 'character', 'fly.Julia', 'Stiles', 'other', 'hand', 'firecracker', 'Sarah', 'who', 'was', 'aspiring', 'ballerina', 'untimely', 'death', 'mother', 'move', 'father', 'who', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'movie', 'was', 'delightful', 'see', 'Thomas', 'play', 'off', 'other.Each', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'well', 'cast', 'well', 'dancing', 'too', 'was', 'hip', 'exciting', 'well-choreographed', 'dances', 'were', 'well-orchestrated', 'exclamation', 'marks', 'scenes', 'MTV', ""n't"", 'over-reach', 'film', 'what', 'made', 'work', 'knew', 'what', 'wanted', 'did', 'well.The', 'genius', 'film', 'good', 'balances', 'so', 'many', 'aspects', 'cool', 'alienating', 'non-high', 'schoolers', 'dramatic', 'being', 'sappy', 'cliches', 'times', 'being', 'corny', 'combined', 'dances', 'acting', 'make', 'movie', 'rock-solid', 'feel-good', 'crowd-pleaser', 'unfair', 'judge', 'crowd-pleaser', 'bio-epics', 'Oscar-winning', 'dramas', 'say', 'former', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'different', 'types', 'movies', 'one', 'better', 'feel-good', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while']",N/A

This is one movie that really grasps the realities and pressures of life. The school setting isn't overdone at all--the person who wrote the script really had a firm handle on what the school and teenage experience is. Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas are remarkable in their roles as Sara and Derek, two high school students who come from different racial backgrounds, but share the same love. Sara is forced to move to a nearly all-black neighborhood, where she must stay with her father because her mother has died in a car accident. (The parents are divorced.) Sara was a ballet dancer, but her mother's sudden death led her to toss her dreams on a shelf and attempt to ignore them. Surprisingly, Sara almost instantly finds a niche in her new predominantly black high school. She meets a sweet girl named Chenille (well portrayed by Kerry Washington) who clearly has her fair share of problems, but is a continuously good friend to Sara. Chenille's brother Derek also plays a big role in Sara's life. The two of them don't get along at first, but it isn't long before they find a common attraction to one another and slip into a relationship. It is Derek who helps Sara come to terms with why she gave up ballet, and it is Derek who supports her and encourages her to start dancing again. With Derek's tireless love to hold her up, Sara experiences emotional healing. Derek and Sara are obviously willing to face the challenges of their black man/white girl relationship with strength and courage, but opposite opinions of friends and family threaten to pull them apart. Now it's up to Sara and Derek to search their souls, examine their love for each other, and work to keep this relationship in existence. Throughout the film, both Sara and Derek face challenges other than the ones that come from their relationship; these challenges could affect their own lives, as well as the lives of their friends. This is just a really touching movie that really got to me. Although it seems a little unrealistic that Sara fit in her new school so quickly, there is nothing about this movie that is trash. It really addresses the issues that arise when two people from different races want to be together. This is a problem that we see in everyday life, and it was very powerful to see it come alive in a movie like this. ""Save the Last Dance"" has all the right stuff. It's funny, touching, and an altogether powerful illustration of the youth of today.",5,One of my favorite movies ever! =),1009670400,"12 30, 2001",2001,2548,"['Wow', 'pretty', 'much', 'first', 'thing', 'think', 'when', 'movie', 'awesome', 'one', 'movie', 'really', 'realities', 'pressures', 'life', 'school', 'setting', ""n't"", 'overdone', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'really', 'had', 'firm', 'handle', 'what', 'school', 'teenage', 'experience', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'are', 'remarkable', 'roles', 'Sara', 'Derek', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'come', 'different', 'racial', 'backgrounds', 'share', 'same', 'love', 'Sara', 'forced', 'move', 'nearly', 'all-black', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'must', 'stay', 'father', 'mother', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'Sara', 'was', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'mother', 'sudden', 'death', 'led', 'toss', 'dreams', 'shelf', 'attempt', 'ignore', 'Surprisingly', 'Sara', 'almost', 'instantly', 'niche', 'new', 'predominantly', 'black', 'high', 'school', 'sweet', 'girl', 'named', 'Chenille', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'who', 'clearly', 'fair', 'share', 'problems', 'continuously', 'good', 'friend', 'Sara', 'Chenille', 'brother', 'Derek', 'also', 'big', 'role', 'Sara', 'life', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'first', ""n't"", 'long', 'find', 'common', 'attraction', 'one', 'slip', 'relationship', 'Derek', 'who', 'Sara', 'come', 'terms', 'why', 'gave', 'up', 'ballet', 'Derek', 'who', 'start', 'dancing', 'again', 'Derek', 'tireless', 'love', 'hold', 'up', 'Sara', 'emotional', 'healing', 'Derek', 'Sara', 'are', 'obviously', 'willing', 'face', 'challenges', 'black', 'man/white', 'girl', 'relationship', 'strength', 'courage', 'opposite', 'opinions', 'friends', 'family', 'threaten', 'pull', 'apart', 'Now', 'up', 'Sara', 'Derek', 'search', 'souls', 'examine', 'love', 'other', 'work', 'keep', 'relationship', 'existence', 'film', 'Sara', 'Derek', 'face', 'other', 'ones', 'come', 'relationship', 'challenges', 'could', 'affect', 'own', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'lives', 'friends', 'just', 'really', 'touching', 'movie', 'really', 'got', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'Sara', 'fit', 'new', 'school', 'so', 'quickly', 'nothing', 'movie', 'trash', 'really', 'issues', 'arise', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'races', 'want', 'be', 'together', 'problem', 'see', 'everyday', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'see', 'come', 'alive', 'movie', 'Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'right', 'stuff', 'funny', 'touching', 'altogether', 'powerful', 'illustration', 'youth', 'today']",N/A

This movie deals with these issues in such a great realsitic way and I'll recommend anyone to buy it. The fusion of the classical and hip hop culture is amazing and the cast plays their roles so well. Also with the DVD is the usual extras. It has the making of the film and music video (which is very interesting), the music video itself, interviews with cast and crew members, film trailer and deleted secnes.

But the film certainly touched on all of the key issues.Thomas Carter's (Haywood from the White Shadow) direction was flawless.  The films pacing was smooth while it certainly boiled with intensity in the spots where it was needed.  The only other thing I personally would have liked would for there to have been some integration with some of Ms. Stile's father's jazz tunes.  To integrate that with the ballet and hip hop would have sent an even more powerful message than just the ballet hip hop combo.Ms Stiles is a talented actress but I can't say as much for her dancing talents.  Though she is certainly to be commended to even be credible as both a ballet dancer and flo..in' wit some hip hop.  But her ballet was somewhat stilted and her hip hop although technically correct she lacked the flavor that really is hip hop.  (She had the steps down but didnt' have the flow)  Great dancers don't look like they're trying to dance.

In this movie, Sara begins the movie giving up her dream of going to the Julliard school of ballet after her mother died in a car accident while Sara was auditioning. Due to the mother's death, Sara had to move in with her father on Chicago's south side. Most of the plot is fairly predictable from there, but the predictability does not detract too much from the movie's timeliness or relevance. In the movie, several issues are raised including single mom teenage parenthood, interracial dating, and a little bit of gang warfare. While the issues brought up are certainly relevant, some of the situations throughout the movie are somewhat idealistic, like an after-school special on TV. In addition, the story ends with at least a few loose strings.The DVD is great, as it includes some deleted scenes that help tie the story up a bit more neatly.

537777,A26IJ3A2TRQZAO,B00003CXTS,Kayla,"[36, 39]","Save The Last Dance is quite a bit smarter, and more entertaining, than the majority of what some people call teenybopper flicks.  Much of this is due to the performances of Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas.  I know Thomas only from a small role in Cruel Intentions (one of my guilty pleasures from 1999), but Stiles always seems to bring an added depth to her movies, from 10 Things I Hate About You to Hamlet.  This movie's no different.  She's the protagonist, the heart and soul of the movie, and she doesn't disappoint.Stiles is Sarah Johnson, a suburban teen whose life is torn apart when her mother is killed in a car accident en route to her daughter's ballet recital.  Sent to live with her estranged father Roy (Terry Kinney), a down-on-his-luck jazz musician, she is forced to adapt to her new environment -- inner city Chicago.  There she enrolls in a school in which she is pretty much the only color.  She makes friends with Chenille Reynolds (Kerry Washington), a single mother, and her brother Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), a smart kid who is at a crossroads in life.  She also makes enemies with Nikki (Bianca Lawson), who wants Derek all to herself, and Malakai (Fredro Starr), Derek's best friend and convicted criminal, who's swiftly descending into a life of crime.  Needless to say, a relationship develops between Sarah and Derek, and they help each other: he gets her involved in dance again, and she opens his mind to the possibilities of life outside the hood.Save The Last Dance is more realistic than many of its counterparts.  The high school looks like a real high school.  The dance club is more like a dance club; ie, some people dance, some don't, and nobody breaks out into a quasi-Busby Berkeley style group dance number.  And the actors make their characters seem like real people.  Director Thomas Carter and screenwriters Duane Adler and Cheryl Edwards bring up a number of issues that make the movie more than just another teen flick.  If you're a romantic, the ending will leave you with a huge smile on your face, and perhaps even choke you up.

Her mother dies and she must move from her country town to Chicago to live with her father (Terry Kinney). She finds herself plunged into an alien environment. She's at a high school where the student population is perhaps 95% black, which doesn't trouble her, but she gets a quick introduction to the higher crime rate in a big city - metal detectors at the school entrance... A girl called Chenille (Kerry Washington - excellent performance) looks out for her. The real problem comes when she accompanies her new friends to the local dance club - she discovers that she had no idea of how to dance like they do. Derek Reynolds (Sean Patrick Thomas) takes pity on her, and starts teaching her. This starts some real antagonism between Sara and Nikki (Bianca Lawson); Nikki was already in her face, and now Sara's cosying up to the man she wants.Derek's best friend Malakai (Fredro Starr) is heading in a different direction - he's just out of jail, and shows every sign of heading back again. Derek wants to become a doctor, and his marks are good enough. Malakai doesn't like the idea of Derek getting close to Sara - it is never completely clear whether this is because of her colour, or because she is encouraging him away from gang-related stuff.Hmm, maybe the director's right about the interracial romance - a lot of the tensions relate to it. Or maybe it's just about race - Sara gets some strange looks simply from being white in a predominantly black neighbourhood.Sara is not the archetypal wimp - she is perfectly happy to stick up for herself.

537784,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXTS,Lawyeraau,"[33, 36]","This is a well acted, somewhat sanitized and idealized story of a talented teeage girl who, on the cusp of achieving her dream, loses everything, only to find it again in a way no one would have predicted. It is a story about attaining one's dreams and the process by which they may become a reality. This is a well acted, though predictable, coming of age tale that can be enjoyed by young and old alike.Here, the talented Julia Stiles plays the role of Sara, a teenager who happens to be a talented ballet dancer. Auditioning for the famous Julliard School, while angry at her single parent mother for being late to her audition, she fumbles her audition. She finishes, only to discover that her mother, in her haste to make Sara's audition, died in a tragic car accident on her way. Blaming herself for her mother's death, Sara gives up ballet.Her pleasant life suddenly snatched from her, Sara is forced to go live with her estranged dad, Roy, wonderfully acted by Terry Tinney. A down and out jazz musician who lives on Chicago's tough south side, Roy does the best he can to make up for lost time. Sara, seemingly undaunted by her seamy new surroundings, enters a predominantly black high school, where she is befriended by fellow student, Chanelle, a single mom with a hunky, intelligent brother, Derek, played by Sean Patrick Thomas, who is well cast in the role. Bound for Georgetown University, Derek hopes to one day become a doctor.Through her blossoming relationship with Derek, Sara begins to dance again. It is through his encouragement and nurturing that she regains the confidence to follow her dream and audition once again for Julliard. It is also through his commitment to Sara that Derek finds the courage to tell his gangsta wanna be friend that he wants no further involvement in his friend's nefarious activities, before it is too late for him.Sara's audition is a show stopping dance routine that is the icing on this enjoyable, coming of age film. It is a testament to hope and to the power of love.",4,TO DREAM THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM...,1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,2025,"['well', 'acted', 'somewhat', 'sanitized', 'idealized', 'story', 'talented', 'teeage', 'girl', 'who', 'cusp', 'achieving', 'dream', 'everything', 'only', 'find', 'again', 'way', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'predicted', 'story', 'attaining', 'one', 'dreams', 'process', 'may', 'become', 'reality', 'well', 'acted', 'predictable', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'young', 'old', 'alike.Here', 'talented', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'role', 'Sara', 'teenager', 'who', 'be', 'talented', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'Auditioning', 'famous', 'Julliard', 'School', 'angry', 'single', 'parent', 'mother', 'being', 'late', 'audition', 'audition', 'only', 'discover', 'mother', 'haste', 'make', 'Sara', 'audition', 'died', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'way', 'Blaming', 'mother', 'death', 'Sara', 'up', 'ballet.Her', 'pleasant', 'life', 'suddenly', 'snatched', 'Sara', 'forced', 'go', 'live', 'estranged', 'dad', 'Roy', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Terry', 'Tinney', 'down', 'jazz', 'musician', 'who', 'Chicago', 'tough', 'south', 'side', 'Roy', 'best', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'lost', 'time', 'Sara', 'seemingly', 'undaunted', 'seamy', 'new', 'surroundings', 'predominantly', 'black', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'befriended', 'fellow', 'student', 'Chanelle', 'single', 'mom', 'hunky', 'intelligent', 'brother', 'Derek', 'played', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'who', 'well', 'cast', 'role', 'Bound', 'Georgetown', 'University', 'Derek', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'doctor.Through', 'blossoming', 'relationship', 'Derek', 'Sara', 'dance', 'again', 'encouragement', 'nurturing', 'confidence', 'follow', 'dream', 'audition', 'once', 'again', 'Julliard', 'also', 'commitment', 'Sara', 'Derek', 'courage', 'tell', 'gangsta', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'friend', 'further', 'involvement', 'friend', 'nefarious', 'activities', 'too', 'late', 'him.Sara', 'audition', 'show', 'stopping', 'dance', 'routine', 'icing', 'enjoyable', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'testament', 'hope', 'power', 'love']",N/A

I was interested in the trailers, but I never got around to watching it. 12 years later, I decided to buy the DVD. What a waste of $10...There are so many movies in which black people are portrayed as ignorant thugs. As a black male, this makes me upset. I thought that this movie would be different. After all, the lead character gets accepted to one of the most prestigious schools in the nation. Unfortunately, I was wrong.I won't summarize the plot since several people already did that. After Sara arrived in the ""urban"" school in Chicago, she was befriended by Chenille. Of course, Chenille had a kid while she was in high school and she spoke in Ebonics. Anyone who has watched Kerry Washington's other movies knows that she is an intelligent and articulate woman. The way they portrayed her character was just wrong.At first, Derek was Sara's academic rival but they eventually hooked up. What didn't make sense was that Chenille was initially ok with their relationship, but later on in the movie, she complained about a white girl ""stealing"" an intelligent black guy. And even though Nikki clearly started the fight with Sara, Chenille blamed Sara.Derek's friend was this thug (of course) named Malakai. They both stole money from a liquor store when they were kids, but Derek got away. Malakai didn't snitch on his friend. I wish the movie explained how Derek went from basically committing a felony to attending an elite college. They could've at least showed him studying for the SAT.This movie made an interracial relationship a bigger deal than it is. They acted like Sara Johnson was the only white girl in the entire city of Chicago. She was experiencing blatant reverse racism. And every black character besides Derek was a stereotypical caricature.The movie was good up until the scene where Derek and Sara had sex in her apartment. Afterwards, it just became stupid and fell apart. The dance scenes and songs were great. I really wanted to like this movie, but it only perpetuated negative stereotypes about African-Americans.

She is forced to live with her father, a stranger who has played no role in her life since leaving her and her mother. To do this, she must move from her middle class white world to urban Chicago, where her blond hair and ballet training do little to help her blend in with her new peers.But Sara is no wallflower, and finds a place for herself in her new school and community.

The dance scenes aren't the main part of the movie, there's racial issues being heavily focused on, and teenage pregnancy. Sean Patrick Thomas does well in his role of Julia Stiles' boyfriend in the movie, but often, he comes across as being more of the tough guy, rather than the love interest.There aren't many boring scenes in this movie, and it's pretty much fast paced, with anything that could be seen as too tedious, condensed quite neatly.The music is pretty cool, although I wouldn't recommend buying the soundtrack unless you're totally into your 'slammin'' hip-hop music. Not really my kind of style really.

I am a great lover of dance movies; they really inspire me and keep me going to dance class!Not every dance movie is good, but this one sure is.It is interesting to see the roles reversed for once: instead of seeing a teenager from a minority group trying to fit in with the white kids, we see a white kid thrust into a world she probably never dreamed of being in.The way the kids at the predominantly black school react to the girl seems pretty realistic and understandable.But then you've got the dancing, and boy is it hot! Mostly we see a bunch of funky kids getting down and dirty at the local club, Steps, (obviously not named after the cheesy English pop group) their attitude showing in their moves. Makes you wanna get out there with them. Then Julia Stiles' character (damn I can't remember her name... Sarah?) enhances her talent for ballet by inheriting some of that raw passion, and attitude, which I believe is what dancing is all about!Hip hop is the best style of dance, so I just adored seeing so much of it in a film, which was intertwined with a great story.

However, when her mother dies in a car crash she goes to live with her father and becomes one of the only white people at her new school, forgetting about ballet altogether.  Feeling an outsider at first she befriends the popular Chenille and becomes interested in her brother Derek.  Before long Sara and Derek are seeing each other and her old love of ballet is reawakened, influenced by the hip-hop and rap that her friends listen to.Although the romance and the reawakening of Sara's dream is obvious enough, it is its refusal to skirt the tricky issues not often dealt in teen movies.  Chenille's baby, the estranged father and arguments concerning race are all in there alongside the beautiful faces, dancing, fighting and kissing.  It's true that it's a distinctly average movie on several levels but it should be credited by giving a realistic interpretation of teenage life amidst racial tension.  For example, the inevitable fight between Sara and Derek takes place not so much because of Derek's ex (Bianca Lawson - Kendra from `Buffy The Vampire Slayer'), but because of the friction that Sara causes with Derek's friends and family.  It may all lead to a sappy conclusion but it's a rare teen move that will show a shoot-out and a mother still at school.",3,Teen movie free of clich&eacute;s,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",2002,1364,"['Save', 'Last', 'Dance', 'movie', 'Sara', 'who', 'win', 'place', 'Julliard', 'do', 'ballet', 'However', 'when', 'mother', 'car', 'crash', 'live', 'father', 'one', 'only', 'white', 'people', 'new', 'school', 'forgetting', 'ballet', 'altogether', 'Feeling', 'outsider', 'first', 'popular', 'Chenille', 'becomes', 'interested', 'brother', 'Derek', 'long', 'Sara', 'Derek', 'are', 'seeing', 'other', 'old', 'love', 'ballet', 'reawakened', 'influenced', 'hip-hop', 'rap', 'friends', 'listen', 'romance', 'reawakening', 'Sara', 'dream', 'obvious', 'enough', 'refusal', 'skirt', 'tricky', 'issues', 'not', 'often', 'teen', 'movies', 'Chenille', 'baby', 'estranged', 'father', 'arguments', 'concerning', 'race', 'are', 'beautiful', 'dancing', 'fighting', 'kissing', 'true', 'distinctly', 'average', 'movie', 'several', 'levels', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'giving', 'realistic', 'interpretation', 'teenage', 'life', 'racial', 'tension', 'example', 'inevitable', 'fight', 'Sara', 'Derek', 'place', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Derek', 'ex', 'Bianca', 'Lawson', 'Kendra', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'friction', 'Sara', 'Derek', 'friends', 'family', 'may', 'lead', 'sappy', 'conclusion', 'rare', 'teen', 'move', 'will', 'show', 'shoot-out', 'mother', 'still', 'school']",N/A

Sara had hopes of studying dance at Juillard, but her dream dies with the death of her mother. She accepts her new life with quiet stoicism and resignation, but is awaken by Hip Hop dancing and her new friends. With the help of her boyfriend who is determined to become a pediatrician, Sara winds up following her dream of studying dance at Juillard. Although the plot is predictable, the characters are fully dimensional and realistic, which makes for an interesting movie for teenagers and adults alike. Stiles' Hip Hop dancing was not quite convincing, although she makes a good effort. At times her body language conveyed a self-consciousness, making me feel like she wasn't quite comfortable with this dance form. Alas, that must mean her solo dance sequences were done by a dance double. It's a feel-good story but with enough real-life situations thrown in to prevent it from becoming saccharine, such as the drive-by shootings, a single mom's struggles with an errant father, the explicit language that nobody hasn't already heard a zillion times before. If this movie was a true depiction of inner city high school life, language and situations would be a lot rawer and more violent. But true-life realism wasn't the goal of this film.

They have a nice chemistry, if they had a chance to do more together than this lame, cliche ridden script.  If I were black, though, I'd find this movie offensive as it portrays the majority of black characters as hopelessly tied to failure, except for the one shining light who works his way out of the ghetto and of course, merits a white girl.  The ending is embarassingly ""flashdance"".  The only thing that saved the movie from one star was that I was afraid it would be even more predictable, that the shining light, with his dream in reach,  would get snuffed out in gang violence all in the name of noble friendship, while the girl, inspired by his bootstrappiness, goes on to get her dream.

Maynard,"[3, 7]","Both Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas put in a five-star performance in a film, which is clearly a cut and paste job from popular films of the past.  The story begins by wandering badly, shooting convoluted subplots that lead the viewer nowhere.  Several times I turned this movie off and walked away from it.  Usually I won't waste my time on a flick that doesn't get moving; but, having seen Julia Stiles in past films, I kept returning for another go.  Finally, one hour into the film, a thread takes shape and Stiles gets to show her exceptional talent for drama; it's a talent she owns, no doubt about that.  Thomas also does a great job in support of Stiles, and a handful of scenes ring true and clear.  To me, those scenes were the whole movie.  I'll watch it again, but only after I fast-forward to the one-hour mark.What intrigues me is the opportunity this film missed: it should have explored further, the romantic relationship between Derek (Thomas) a black high school student and Sara (Stiles) one of the few white female students in Derek's school.  In their roles, they depict two very intelligent students who have fallen in love, but the treatment of their relationship is shallow and lacks depth.The resources were there to do something great.  Was it the screen writer the director, or both --- who yank the viewer around for an hour and then get a thread going, only to weave it through boring cliches.  Fortunately, both Stiles and Thomas have great futures in store for them and I hope that soon, they'll be offered roles that challenge their strengths to the limit.

Bauer,"[1, 1]","I thought it was light, enjoyable, entertaining and relaxing. what movies are all about. its boy meets girl, growing-up, music, dance, romance, race relations, inferiority, making it and a happy ending. Sarah was a girl from the mid-west who was a serious student of ballet. Her mother dies in a car accident on the way to see her perform. Sarah feels guilty, drops dancing and has to go live in the inner city of Chicago with her estranged father. She is now the only white kid in an all black high school. She starts a relationship with a black male student (Sean Patrick Thomas) who is a better dancer than she is but hip hop. Sarah has tons more self-confidence and social skills than any high school girl I can possibly imagine. and her boy friend has got more handle on life than a dozen old wise men. its not realistic and who cares! Both are every likeable and lovable. Sarah (Jula Stiles) is a nice sight to behold with a personality to match. Apparently she has been acting as a child was 21 when the movie was made. I wonder how many viewers will notice the paradox/irony when they see the tenement that Sarah lives in with her father compared to the very nice middle class apartment that Sarah's black girl friend (Chenille Williams) lives in. It is Sarah's black friend who (with hostility) insists black and white are two separate worlds. I couldn't help thinking that the chains that bind her in slavery and second class citizenship exist only in her own mind. I think this is what the different condition of their apartments was partially underscoring. But on the other hand! It looks like the black students have a tough row to hoe to get of the dysfunctional environment they live in; whereas, I feel I am speaking for most viewers whn I say we assume Sarah's journey onward and upward through life will be one enchanted",3,Wonderfull,1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,1838,"['thought', 'was', 'light', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'relaxing', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'growing-up', 'music', 'dance', 'romance', 'race', 'relations', 'inferiority', 'making', 'happy', 'ending', 'Sarah', 'was', 'girl', 'mid-west', 'who', 'was', 'serious', 'student', 'ballet', 'mother', 'car', 'accident', 'way', 'see', 'perform', 'Sarah', 'guilty', 'drops', 'dancing', 'go', 'live', 'inner', 'city', 'Chicago', 'estranged', 'father', 'now', 'only', 'white', 'kid', 'black', 'high', 'school', 'relationship', 'black', 'male', 'student', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'who', 'better', 'dancer', 'hip', 'hop', 'Sarah', 'tons', 'more', 'self-confidence', 'social', 'skills', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'boy', 'friend', 'got', 'more', 'handle', 'life', 'dozen', 'old', 'wise', 'men', 'not', 'realistic', 'who', 'are', 'likeable', 'lovable', 'Sarah', 'Jula', 'Stiles', 'nice', 'sight', 'behold', 'personality', 'match', 'Apparently', 'been', 'acting', 'child', 'was', '21', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'notice', 'paradox/irony', 'when', 'see', 'tenement', 'Sarah', 'father', 'compared', 'very', 'nice', 'middle', 'class', 'apartment', 'Sarah', 'black', 'girl', 'friend', 'Chenille', 'Williams', 'Sarah', 'black', 'friend', 'who', 'hostility', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'two', 'separate', 'worlds', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'chains', 'bind', 'slavery', 'second', 'class', 'citizenship', 'exist', 'only', 'own', 'mind', 'think', 'what', 'different', 'condition', 'apartments', 'was', 'partially', 'underscoring', 'other', 'hand', 'black', 'students', 'have', 'tough', 'row', 'hoe', 'get', 'dysfunctional', 'environment', 'live', 'whereas', 'feel', 'am', 'speaking', 'most', 'viewers', 'whn', 'say', 'assume', 'Sarah', 'journey', 'onward', 'upward', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'enchanted']",N/A
