1665377,A39UREQDCH188B,B00E8N314C,R. East,"[0, 0]",I had never heard of Mr. Jobrani but thought I would take a chance and am glad I did. I started by wondering if other countries would find or understand American humor funny but being an Iranian Immigrant he delivers it very well. Understanding their humor he does bits on each of the countries in that part of the world and as it turns out we can all find humor in  each other. I had been looking for a good comedy part and some  I couldn't finish but found this .which was really good. I would highly recommend to others.,4,Good Entertainment,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,523,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'Mr.', 'Jobrani', 'thought', 'would', 'take', 'chance', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'started', 'wondering', 'other', 'countries', 'would', 'find', 'understand', 'American', 'humor', 'funny', 'being', 'Iranian', 'Immigrant', 'very', 'well', 'Understanding', 'humor', 'bits', 'countries', 'part', 'world', 'out', 'can', 'find', 'humor', 'other', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'good', 'comedy', 'part', 'could', ""n't"", 'finish', 'found', '.which', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'others']",Maz Jobrani: I Come In Peace

The only thing that detracted is that I watch so many of his youtube clips that I already knew a number of the jokes. But otherwise, this was really good.Some of his impromptu humor is every bit as good as his planned jokes though.
