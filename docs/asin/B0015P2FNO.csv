1150489,A3HYCGZ5CKCZIH,B0015P2FNO,"G. T. Howell ""neogalahad""","[15, 17]","Based on the novel by Robert Whitlow, The List is a suspense story about a young lawyer named Renny and his involvement with a secretive investment brotherhood known as The Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.  As he tries to escape the financial and spiritual domination of this mysterious group, he falls in love with a young woman named Jo, and learns some lessons about the power of prayer along the way.When I reviewed the novel (also a two-star effort IMO), my primary peeves were the fact that the story's middle was bogged down by Renny & Jo's romance, and that Renny's ""conversion"" to Christianity was a very weak presentation of the Gospel.  I was curious to see if these flaws would be addressed with a more tightly-written screenplay.  The answer is both yes and no.The book-to-screen translation did eliminate the saggy middle of the novel, but I think they actually cut too much, boiling Renny and Jo's love story down to one or two brief scenes.  The story as told here seems rushed; the slow parts of the book are tightened up, but everything else got curtailed too, even the good parts.  Frankly, if I hadn't read the book I'm not sure how much of the story I would have grasped.  Perhaps budgetary restraints made them keep the film short, but the resulting screenplay only hits the highlights of the book.Though I hardly thought it possible, Renny's ""conversion"" is even weaker here than in the book.  He just sits in a church, crying and staring at a statue of Jesus.  There's no Gospel at all!  There are some good spiritual lessons about the power of faith and prayer, but the choppy storytelling weakens the effectiveness of the message.The production values are excellent, and the performances are good as well, especially the actress who plays Mama A.  The overall casting was excellent, too.  I did wish that the motivations of the villainous Desmond had been made clearer; sometimes he seems to want to help Renny, but then he turns around and stabs him in the back.  Also, unlike the book, the movie ends with his fate unresolved!  The source of his supernatural abilities is never made clear either -- he just seems like a bad guy with some kind of unexplained spooky power.Bottom line, despite a good cast and production values, the sketchy storytelling make The List a movie to scratch from YOUR list.",2,Scratch this off your list,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,2333,"['Based', 'novel', 'Robert', 'Whitlow', 'List', 'suspense', 'story', 'young', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Renny', 'involvement', 'secretive', 'investment', 'brotherhood', 'known', 'Covenant', 'List', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Ltd.', 'escape', 'financial', 'spiritual', 'domination', 'mysterious', 'group', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Jo', 'lessons', 'power', 'prayer', 'way.When', 'reviewed', 'novel', 'also', 'two-star', 'effort', 'IMO', 'primary', 'peeves', 'were', 'fact', 'story', 'middle', 'was', 'bogged', 'down', 'Renny', 'Jo', 'romance', 'Renny', 'conversion', 'Christianity', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'presentation', 'Gospel', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'flaws', 'would', 'be', 'addressed', 'more', 'tightly-written', 'screenplay', 'answer', 'yes', 'no.The', 'book-to-screen', 'translation', 'did', 'eliminate', 'saggy', 'middle', 'novel', 'think', 'actually', 'cut', 'too', 'much', 'boiling', 'Renny', 'Jo', 'love', 'story', 'down', 'one', 'two', 'brief', 'scenes', 'story', 'told', 'here', 'rushed', 'slow', 'parts', 'book', 'are', 'tightened', 'up', 'everything', 'else', 'got', 'curtailed', 'too', 'even', 'good', 'parts', 'Frankly', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'grasped', 'Perhaps', 'budgetary', 'restraints', 'made', 'keep', 'film', 'short', 'resulting', 'screenplay', 'only', 'highlights', 'book.Though', 'hardly', 'thought', 'possible', 'Renny', 'conversion', 'even', 'weaker', 'here', 'book', 'just', 'church', 'crying', 'staring', 'statue', 'Jesus', 'Gospel', 'are', 'good', 'spiritual', 'lessons', 'power', 'faith', 'prayer', 'choppy', 'storytelling', 'effectiveness', 'message.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'well', 'especially', 'actress', 'who', 'Mama', 'A', 'overall', 'casting', 'was', 'excellent', 'too', 'did', 'wish', 'motivations', 'villainous', 'Desmond', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'clearer', 'sometimes', 'want', 'help', 'Renny', 'then', 'around', 'stabs', 'back', 'Also', 'book', 'movie', 'fate', 'unresolved', 'source', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'just', 'bad', 'guy', 'kind', 'unexplained', 'spooky', 'power.Bottom', 'line', 'good', 'cast', 'production', 'values', 'sketchy', 'storytelling', 'make', 'List', 'movie', 'scratch', 'YOUR', 'list']","List, The"

It starts out like a John Grisham novel, makes a sharp left into Stephen King territory, and ends up being a commercial for TV evangelism. Described as a ""supernatural thriller"" it lacks thrills.Renny Jacobson is the ""104th lawyer out of 104"" at his Firm. His estranged father dies, leaving Renny nothing of his $22,000,000 fortune. Nevertheless, Renny's father leaves instructions regarding ""The List"" and ""The Covenant of South Carolina."" Not long after, Renny is invited to a Board Meeting of this mysterious group, which turns out to be the Original Good Ol' Boys Club.So far, so good. The old men of the Covenant, all descendants of a group that spirited away the Confederacy's precious metals, consider themselves the Masters of The World. Renny really doesn't fit in. Neither does Renny's friend, another young new member. Neither does Renny's girlfriend, the last daughter of her family line, mistakenly invited because the Covenant members thought she was a ""Joseph"" not a ""Josephine"". In short order, ""Jo"" is kicked out of the group and falls ill. Renny's friend dies of an apparent heatstroke during a Civil War re-enactment.This is where THE LIST derails. It soon turns out that the Chairman of the Board has dark arcane powers and is using them to rearrange the world to his liking. Renny soon finds himself disbarred, broke, and friendless. In desperation, he turns to his (African-American) Nanny for help. Suddenly, THE LIST espouses Muscular Fundamentalist Christianity as an anodyne to the ills caused by the Covenant members. All this drama fizzles at the endpoint, with Renny shouting, ""It's over!"" and stalking out of the Boardroom.Thank God it's over.THE LIST markets itself to a general audience, so I felt rather offended to be force-fed a Bible Studies course when I wasn't expecting one. I already went to Sunday School, thanks, and the corny melange of elements that make up this milquetoast tale of Good versus Evil didn't do credit to either. And, in the end, Renny's still broke and unemployed while the Covenant lives on. What's the moral?",1,"""The List is all about power!""

1150493,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0015P2FNO,Mark Turner,"[7, 8]","Not to be confused with THE BUCKET LIST, THE LIST is a movie about conviction and faith. At the same time, it's a thriller in the John Grisham mode that plays its cards straight through to the very end.Young Renny Jacobson (Chuck Carrington) is a young lawyer with hopes for the future. While working, he receives news of his father's sudden death. Taking a few days off, he heads home to learn of his father's legacy. It's not at all what he expected.Renny learns that his father has left his entire estate to charity, leaving little more than a mystery for Renny to filter through to find his true inheritance. A key to a small deposit box containing a tape and a book are just the beginning. Renny follows clues that lead him to a group of gentlemen who form what is called the Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd.On his way there Renny encounters Jo Johnston (Hilarie Burton), a young lady on the way to the same meeting. With her car broken down, she catches a ride with Renny to the meeting of this organization.They arrive to be greeted by Desmond Larochette (Malcolm McDowell), the head of the group who oozes with Southern grace. Treated royally, they are offered a chance to rest before the big meeting that night.At dinner they discuss very little about the group as well as terms of joining. Once dinner finishes, they let Jo know that they had no idea she was a woman and that this is an all male club. Stripped of her mysterious inheritance and defended by Renny, Jo is asked to leave the meeting and Renny learns the truth about the group.The gentlemen of Covenant List are all highly placed members of their communities. A member of each of the families represented has been a part of the Covenant since its inception 140 years earlier. And the secret behind ""the List"" is more about power than it is about mere wealth.Power struggles between members manipulating Renny from the beginning do little more than strip him of what was potentially a vast fortune. Determined to claim what is his and to set things straight, Renny does little more than play into the hands of these southern gents, in the process placing himself and Jo in grave danger.But the power offered here is not simply an earthly one. Metaphysical moments bring us to the fact that more than earthly solutions are powered by ""the list"". And in searching for answers, Renny finds more than his will tested. He discovers his faith not only tested but brought forth to give him more power than the list could ever have.Does he confront the members of the Covenant? Does he straighten things out? Does he save Jo? All is revealed by the films end.There is much to like about THE LIST. For one, the story involves more than simple good guy bad guy themes, instead focusing on the results of falling for temptation. The lire of power and wealth can be great, but they grant things only found here on earth and less on a spiritual plain. Renny's quest for answers results in more than wealth.That being said, the film does offer a slower pace than most, at times causing the viewer to reach for the remote to find out just how much time is left of the film. The story may be good, the execution done well, but that doesn't increase the pace.The acting is top notch, with McDowell offering one of his best performances. It's sad to see an actor of McDowell's stature reduced to the B-grade horror films he's done of late. This movie gives him a chance to shine once more, exuding a calm, cool and calculating bad guy.Other supporting roles are well done by all involved. Perhaps the weakest link acting wise here is lead actor Carrington. His southern accent at times seems over the top and his subtleness is greatly lacking. But he does show potential. As for Burton, she's become somewhat of a star in her own right in the TV series ONE TREE HILL. Having never watched the show she was a new face to me in this film where she did a fine job.All in all THE LIST is not the greatest movie to come along in a while. It does offer something that few films do these days which is a moral and a message based on faith that seems to be nearly non-existent in movies these days. Let's hope it garners enough interest that more films like these are made.",4,CHECK YOUR LIST,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,4224,"['Not', 'be', 'confused', 'THE', 'BUCKET', 'LIST', 'THE', 'LIST', 'movie', 'conviction', 'faith', 'same', 'time', 'thriller', 'John', 'Grisham', 'mode', 'cards', 'straight', 'very', 'end.Young', 'Renny', 'Jacobson', 'Chuck', 'Carrington', 'young', 'lawyer', 'hopes', 'future', 'working', 'news', 'father', 'sudden', 'death', 'Taking', 'few', 'days', 'off', 'home', 'learn', 'father', 'legacy', 'not', 'what', 'expected.Renny', 'father', 'left', 'entire', 'estate', 'charity', 'leaving', 'little', 'more', 'mystery', 'Renny', 'filter', 'find', 'true', 'inheritance', 'key', 'small', 'deposit', 'box', 'containing', 'tape', 'book', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'Renny', 'clues', 'lead', 'group', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'form', 'what', 'called', 'Covenant', 'List', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Ltd.On', 'way', 'Renny', 'encounters', 'Jo', 'Johnston', 'Hilarie', 'Burton', 'young', 'lady', 'way', 'same', 'meeting', 'car', 'broken', 'down', 'ride', 'Renny', 'meeting', 'organization.They', 'arrive', 'be', 'greeted', 'Desmond', 'Larochette', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'head', 'group', 'who', 'Southern', 'grace', 'Treated', 'royally', 'are', 'offered', 'chance', 'rest', 'big', 'meeting', 'dinner', 'discuss', 'very', 'little', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'terms', 'joining', 'Once', 'dinner', 'finishes', 'let', 'Jo', 'know', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'woman', 'male', 'club', 'Stripped', 'mysterious', 'inheritance', 'defended', 'Renny', 'Jo', 'asked', 'leave', 'meeting', 'Renny', 'truth', 'group.The', 'gentlemen', 'Covenant', 'List', 'are', 'highly', 'placed', 'members', 'communities', 'member', 'families', 'represented', 'been', 'part', 'Covenant', 'inception', '140', 'years', 'earlier', 'secret', 'List', 'more', 'power', 'mere', 'wealth.Power', 'struggles', 'members', 'manipulating', 'Renny', 'beginning', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'strip', 'what', 'was', 'potentially', 'vast', 'fortune', 'Determined', 'claim', 'what', 'set', 'things', 'straight', 'Renny', 'little', 'more', 'play', 'hands', 'southern', 'gents', 'process', 'placing', 'Jo', 'grave', 'danger.But', 'power', 'offered', 'here', 'not', 'simply', 'earthly', 'one', 'Metaphysical', 'moments', 'bring', 'fact', 'more', 'earthly', 'solutions', 'are', 'powered', 'list', 'searching', 'answers', 'Renny', 'more', 'will', 'tested', 'faith', 'not', 'only', 'tested', 'brought', 'forth', 'give', 'more', 'power', 'list', 'could', 'ever', 'have.Does', 'confront', 'members', 'Covenant', 'straighten', 'things', 'out', 'save', 'Jo', 'revealed', 'films', 'end.There', 'much', 'like', 'LIST', 'one', 'story', 'more', 'simple', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'themes', 'instead', 'focusing', 'results', 'falling', 'temptation', 'lire', 'power', 'wealth', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'grant', 'things', 'only', 'found', 'here', 'earth', 'less', 'spiritual', 'plain', 'Renny', 'quest', 'answers', 'results', 'more', 'wealth.That', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'offer', 'slower', 'pace', 'most', 'times', 'causing', 'viewer', 'reach', 'remote', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'left', 'film', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'execution', 'done', 'well', ""n't"", 'increase', 'pace.The', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'McDowell', 'offering', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'sad', 'see', 'actor', 'McDowell', 'stature', 'reduced', 'B-grade', 'horror', 'films', 'done', 'late', 'movie', 'chance', 'shine', 'once', 'more', 'exuding', 'calm', 'cool', 'calculating', 'bad', 'guy.Other', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'involved', 'Perhaps', 'weakest', 'link', 'acting', 'wise', 'here', 'lead', 'actor', 'Carrington', 'southern', 'accent', 'times', 'top', 'subtleness', 'greatly', 'lacking', 'show', 'potential', 'Burton', 'become', 'somewhat', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'TV', 'series', 'ONE', 'TREE', 'HILL', 'Having', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'new', 'face', 'film', 'where', 'did', 'fine', 'job.All', 'LIST', 'not', 'greatest', 'movie', 'come', 'along', 'while', 'offer', 'something', 'few', 'films', 'do', 'days', 'moral', 'message', 'based', 'faith', 'be', 'nearly', 'non-existent', 'movies', 'days', 'Let', 'hope', 'garners', 'enough', 'interest', 'more', 'films', 'are', 'made']","List, The"

It is, in fact a mix of Christian drama, occult/supernatural horror and romance. And the combination doesn't work. It doesn't work as a thriller because it completely lacks suspense.The supernatural elements don't work because there's no understandable logic to them and they only appear towards the end of the movie, with no hint beforehand that there was anything supernatural about the secret society that Renny, the main character, has joined. And speaking of Renny, he's just not a very nice guy who spends most of his time whining about money. It's hard to identify with or care for him very much. And Chuck Carrington is not a very good leading man.And while the movie tries to be an inspirational movie, there's almost no character development that feels convincing. Usually in such movies, we get to follow the character's change of heart. In ""The List"", Renny just suddenly appears to have become a Christian for no particular reason, and the same goes for the romance. We don't see Renny and Jo fall in love; they're just suddenly a couple.All in all, the movie is much too boring. It's very slow and never made me interested.
