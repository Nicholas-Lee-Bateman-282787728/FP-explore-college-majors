This is a great game of wits between two antagonists. What would you do? This question has been asked if you had the power. Well you know what has been said that complete power corrupts completely. I have seen most of the anime series on Adult Swim I was happy to see that they used the same English voice actors from the anime for the English language dub. They did compress this a bit but it plays out well with Death Note II the Last Name as a part II this really had too much to it to put it in just one movie I would suggest that you get both films at the same time for a complete viewing experience. Well you know what I thought I highly recommend this to any and everyone this really is a great film ,buy it rent it whatver,U have to see this!I just bought this after i watching this Masterpiece for my collection to Keep for sure!

1157818,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0017SVH5Q,Carl Manes,"[0, 0]","After hacking into the police database, a young law student is horrified to see that the legal system is failing, and its criminals are being released without charge. Angered, he sets out to confront the criminals himself, but instead, he finds a mysterious notebook lying in the street: the Death Note. Amongst other rules, the book claims that any person whose name is written within its pages will be struck dead in seconds. Light is amused with the idea, and writes down the name of a murderer he saw on the television before going to sleep. The next day, Light awakens to the news that the same man was discovered dead from a heart attack. Realizing that he has the power of the gods in his hands, Light sets out to cleanse the world of evil using the book, but his ego quickly consumes him, and he begins killing anyone that threatens to oppose him. Now, a resourceful computer hacker that goes by the name of ""L"" has teamed with the police in order to expose the wayward vigilante and bring him to justice.Based on the popular Japanese manga of the same name, DEATH NOTE is a high-powered parable that demonstrates how absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is told through an exciting murder mystery where there is no clear hero or villain. Light Yagami is noble at heart, but by superseding the court system and acting as judge, jury, and executioner, he has become that which he hates. L, on the other hand, seems to have the same fundamental beliefs in justice, but his true motives and intentions are never revealed in this first act. The deep philosophical questions that are raised by the Death Note reflect on society's views of good and evil, justice and immorality.Tatsuya Fujiwara, who is best known for his lead in BATTLE ROYALE, captures the duality of Light's character perfectly. He is sincere in his nobility, but his ego prevents him from giving up his new found powers since he has become consumed with winning the battle of wits against L. This causes him to compromise his own ethics by killing the innocent police detectives that have gotten too close to the truth. Kenichi Matsuyama plays opposite of Fujiwara as L, whose odd appearance and awkward mannerisms make him a strange but interesting choice as the supposed hero. Each of their intricately-laid traps and foiled attempts to draw one another out into the open drives the mystery and suspense as they enter into a deadly game of cat and mouse.Shusuke Kaneko has done an excellent job adapting the popular series on to the big screen, allowing DEATH NOTE to take #1 in the box offices in Japan upon its release and making it one of the strongest Japanese exports in years.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,Death Note,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,2689,"['hacking', 'police', 'database', 'young', 'law', 'student', 'horrified', 'see', 'legal', 'system', 'failing', 'criminals', 'are', 'being', 'released', 'charge', 'Angered', 'out', 'confront', 'criminals', 'instead', 'mysterious', 'notebook', 'lying', 'street', 'Death', 'Note', 'Amongst', 'other', 'rules', 'book', 'person', 'name', 'written', 'pages', 'will', 'be', 'struck', 'dead', 'seconds', 'Light', 'amused', 'idea', 'down', 'name', 'murderer', 'saw', 'television', 'going', 'sleep', 'next', 'day', 'Light', 'news', 'same', 'man', 'was', 'discovered', 'dead', 'heart', 'attack', 'Realizing', 'power', 'gods', 'hands', 'Light', 'out', 'cleanse', 'world', 'evil', 'using', 'book', 'ego', 'quickly', 'killing', 'anyone', 'oppose', 'Now', 'resourceful', 'computer', 'hacker', 'name', 'L', 'teamed', 'police', 'order', 'expose', 'wayward', 'vigilante', 'bring', 'justice.Based', 'popular', 'Japanese', 'manga', 'same', 'name', 'DEATH', 'NOTE', 'high-powered', 'parable', 'how', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'told', 'exciting', 'murder', 'mystery', 'where', 'clear', 'hero', 'villain', 'Light', 'Yagami', 'noble', 'heart', 'superseding', 'court', 'system', 'acting', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'become', 'L', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'same', 'fundamental', 'beliefs', 'justice', 'true', 'motives', 'intentions', 'are', 'never', 'revealed', 'first', 'act', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'Death', 'Note', 'reflect', 'society', 'views', 'good', 'evil', 'justice', 'immorality.Tatsuya', 'Fujiwara', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'lead', 'BATTLE', 'ROYALE', 'duality', 'Light', 'character', 'perfectly', 'sincere', 'nobility', 'ego', 'giving', 'up', 'new', 'found', 'powers', 'become', 'consumed', 'winning', 'battle', 'wits', 'L.', 'compromise', 'own', 'ethics', 'killing', 'innocent', 'police', 'detectives', 'have', 'gotten', 'too', 'close', 'truth', 'Kenichi', 'Matsuyama', 'opposite', 'Fujiwara', 'L', 'odd', 'appearance', 'awkward', 'mannerisms', 'make', 'strange', 'interesting', 'choice', 'supposed', 'hero', 'intricately-laid', 'traps', 'foiled', 'attempts', 'draw', 'one', 'open', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'enter', 'deadly', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse.Shusuke', 'Kaneko', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'adapting', 'popular', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'allowing', 'DEATH', 'NOTE', 'take', '1', 'box', 'offices', 'Japan', 'release', 'making', 'one', 'strongest', 'Japanese', 'exports', 'years.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Death Note

1157820,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0017SVH5Q,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Based on the manga and anime series that has captured the attention of viewers worldwide, ""Death Note"" the live action film makes its way to the US on DVD.""Death Note"" is an adaption of the popular manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata and stars Tatsuya Fujiwara (known for his work in the popular ""Battle Royale"" films), directed by Shusuke Kaneko (known for the 2006 hit film ""Gamera"") and the theme song ""Dani California"" by the popular band RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS.The film focuses on Light Yagami (Fujiwara), an intelligent student who wants to work in criminal law and follow his father's footsteps and catch criminals. But one day after hacking into the police department's computer system, Fujiwara is just sickened to know that the police has released criminals who should be incarcerated. One night, Yagami discovers a notebook called ""Death Note"" that has specific rules:-The human whose name is written in this note shall die.-This note will not take effect unless the writer has the person's face in theirmind when writing his/her name. Therefore, people sharing the same name willnot be affected.-If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the person's name,it will happen.-If the cause of death is not specified, the person will simply die of a heartattack.-After writing the cause of death, details of the death should be written in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.-This note shall become the property of the human world, once it touches theground of (arrives in) the human world.-The owner of the note can recognize the image and voice of its original owner,i.e. a god of death.-The human who uses this note can neither go to Heaven nor Hell.Anxious to test this book out, Light writes the name of a criminal, thinking that the book is a joke. That is until the person's name that was written actually dies. Thus Light finds a way to get justice and does what he can to rid the world of all evil and become ""the God of the new world"". He also meets the owner of the Death Note, a shinigami (God of Death) named Ryuk, who is fascinated by Light of his ways of killing the criminals but the way his mind works.Light who uses the name ""Kira"" starts writing the names of criminals in the Death Note and each die by heart attack and thus causing a frenzy in the media and the police force who now need to go after the person killing the criminals. But Kira is not your average criminal, as he is quickly generating a large fandom of people who support Kira's goal of eliminating criminals.Of course, the police force led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami, has no idea of how to go after this criminal but unbeknownst to them is a mysterious person that goes by the name of L. An intelligent detective who has an unorthodox way of catching criminals and so far, has been very succesful with his cases worldwide.The cat and mouse chase has begun as L goes after Kira and Kira realizes his greatest enemy is L and thus the battle begins.The film stars an all-star cast with ""Battle Royale"" actor Tatsuya Fujiwara as Light Yagami, Kenichi Matsuyama who starred in films ""Linda Linda Linda"" and ""NANA"" as the mysterious detective L.Joining the two is one of Japan's most popular actress, Asaka Seto as Naomi Misora, a former FBI agent who's fiance is killed by Kira. Model and actress Yu Kashii as Light's girlfriend Shiori Akino. Shigeki Hosokawa as FBI Agent Raye who is hot on the trail of catching Kira, actress Erika Toda who plays the character of pop star Misa Amane and Takeshi Kaga, best known for the host of the original ""Iron Chef"", who plays the role as Light's father and head of police, Soichiro Yagami.VIDEO & AUDIO:The film is featured in 169 anamorphic widescreen and was originally shot in 35mm (1:85:1 ratio). My main interest was to see how the CGI would be for the shinagami Ryuk. And how that would translate on film and was quite pleased with the 3D character as it looks exactly like it does in the anime and manga series.As for audio, the film is featured in both English and Japanese via digital 5.1 and 2.0 stereo. I typically dislike English dubbing of Asian language films but what brought a smile to my face was that VIZ used the original voice actors of the anime series (which had great English dub work) on this series. So, for those who are fond of Brandon Swaile's Light, Alessandro Juliani's L, Brian Drummond's Ryuk, Shannon Chan-Kent as Misa and the other English dub voice actors will be happy to know that they did the English dub for the live film. That surprised me and definitely major kudo points for Viz Media for keeping things consistent in the voice acting.SPECIAL FEATURES:Special features include a director's interview and the trailer to the film. Plus there is a trailer for the anime series and ""Viz Pictures presents"". The features are quite short but it was great to see an interview with director Shusuke Kaneko addressing the challenge the staff had to adapt the manga series to a live action film and what changes that had to be made.I would have liked to see all features together as one featurette and a ""play all"" command but that's a minor quirp but nevertheless, I'm just happy there are special features on the DVD.I was extremely pleased with the live version of the film. I expected that there would be slight deviations from the original manga and anime series because there is only so much you can pack into a two hour movie.But even with the slight changes, everything worked out. The pacing was well done, the CGI of Ryuk was well done. But those changes from the original series is what gives the film it's own life.Unlike the manga and anime series, Naomi Misora (Seto) has a slightly different role, as does Shiori Akino (Kashii) that plays a major pivotal role early in the series of how demented Light has become, even with a followup comment by Ryuk. Fantastic!But the plus for this film was the talent involved. Tatsuya Fujiwara is such an impressive actor that it was great to see him take on the role of Light Yagami. To see Fujiwara's acting show the believable and caring Light Yagami evolve into the killer known as Kira was just fantastic. Kenichi Matsuyama as L was also well done.But of course, the addition of other talents such as Asaka Seto. She's such a popular TV drama and film star that it was great to see her as the vengeful Naomi Misora and it's great to see Mr. ""Iron Chef"" Takeshi Kaga as Soichiro Yagami.I was extremely pleased with the first live action film and the treatment it has received on DVD. I enjoyed watching it in Japanese but watching it again with the voice actors of the original anime series. Again, I'm not fond with English dubbing for a lot of Asian films but VIZ was smart in utilizing the voice actors for the anime series on this live film. Well done!I highly recommended this DVD!

This movie was very well done. The suspense and drama are both there. The guys they got to play L and Light fit the roles perfectly. Also if you don't want to read the subtitles the english dub uses the same voice actors that were in the anime. The plot digresses a bit form the anime.

1157828,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B0017SVH5Q,Mir,"[1, 1]","I totally was expecting a subpar adaptation of the excellent anime series (first manga) DEATH NOTE, which, for those unfamiliar with the storyline, involves the vigilante-justice use of a death god's notebook by a brilliant student, and his self-corruption while using it as he tries to evade justice in the hounding form of a sugar-addict Gothy detective genius.The anime was loads of fun, with cool music and excellent visuals. The manga was fun. And, hoorah, the film is terrific. I was not disappointed (except for the fact that there is an especially spoiled boy quality in the face/manner of the actor who plays Light Yagami, the death note wielder, that I found particularly annoying in spots, and effective in others.)The story is told across two DVDs (this is the first part of the total story, which deviates in places from the other tellings). This one shows how Light Yagami obtains the notebook from the death god (shinigami) Ryuk (or Ryuuk or Ryuku, as I've seen various spellings). Ryuk is a blast to look at in all the media, and works really well in the film while still retaining his weirdness (especially the face). REM is also effectively rendered, btw, in the second dvd/flick. The young actor who portrays L is delightful in his portrayal of the unusual mannerismss and broody but low-key playful demeanor of the brilliant (and somewhat ruthless) detective who hides his name from Light. Were I a teen, I'd have a massive-crazy crush on him and his ruminative, sweets-loving self. As a middle-aged woman, I allow myself a minor crush. :)The action moves at a good pace and the increasingly tense challenges that L and Light offer to each other are fun to watch--even knowing where the story goes. The two young actors work well against each other.Be sure to see the conclusion in the second flick. It's equally enjoyable and resolves beautifully (and differently from the anime). I ordered the third live-action film (not part of the original storyline) just to see L again, despite the less than wonderful reviews. You can probably skip the third, but do not miss this one and the follow-up, DEATH NOTE II: The Last Word.

Like the beginning of the series Light has what most would consider worthwhile intentions punishing the truly guilty and wicked of the world but as the saying goes absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The way Light later kills some innocent people later in the movie shows that he's not above abusing the note book for his own gains and in turn is no longer a champion of justice but just a serial killer with a megalomaniac mentality.  Then you have the police working in conjunction with L to stop Kira and his agendas as well as bring him to justice.  The movie is what you expect if you seen the series and even if you have never seen the series the movie still gives you the beginning pretty well so you can follow whats happening easily.  If you want to hear it dubbed they got all the voice actors from the series to do this movie as well so no worries on that part.  So if you like the series you'll definitely like the movie as well.

Well, here you go: ""Death Note"" has now been quite successfully adapted as a two-part series of live action films.  I put off watching them for some time out of fear that the story would be butchered, but -while neither are brilliant films- I'd have to say that I'm impressed by how closely the films were able to match the original storyline while adding some new flourishes that can only be seen as improvements.  As long as expectations aren't too high, I think most will be pleased by this version of the story that every Japanophile knows by heart by now.The film opens with a single black notebook falling from the sky, landing on the nighttime pavement during a rainstorm.  Next, we see criminals performing violent acts and/or getting set free before their names are scrawled across the screen; seconds later, they drop dead.  The news reports speak of ""Kira"", an invisible force that is delivering judgement on criminals that are escaping punishment and running rampant.  Some people say Kira is a monster, some say he's a savior as the crime rate continues to fall.  It is then we meet Light Yagami; a college student with a genius intellect, a loving family, a beautiful girlfriend, and a notebook that kills anybody whose name is written within it's pages.  ""Death Note"" is the same as it ever was, a story about means versus ends, civil rights versus civil order, the line between good and evil, and the true meaning of justice.  This movie's best feature is it's respect for the original story.  This is what every film adaptation should strive to be.In spite of all the goodness, there are major bumps on the road to adapting a first-rate anime to live action.  First off, this is obviously a serious live-action film; one that involves supernatural creatures known as ""shinigami"", the Gods of Death.  These creatures are essentially perfect CG reproductions of their respective manga/anime counterparts.  Ryuk (Light's shinigami who we meet in this film) is extremely distracting whenever he is onscreen as he appears to have just stepped out of a videogame into the real world.  He's my favorite character from the anime (along with Misa, who is introduced here and co-stars in the sequel), but in this film he's an annoyance at times.  There are some things that just don't translate well to live action and CG anime characters are one of them.  L, the mysterious and bizarrely eccentric detective sent to bring Kira to justice is a unique character and the true hero of the story adn the actor portraying him does a fine job, but his kooky mannerisms come off as rather cartoonish when you watch a real person ape them.  These are all minor issues that can and probably should be swept aside considering the difficulty of faithfully adapting an anime as popular as this one to film.  But people who are not already fans of ""Death Note"" will almost certainly be put off by these things so they have to be taken into account.  And if anybody can tell me how the Red Hot Chili Peppers factor into the vibe of these films, do share.  ""Dani California"" just seems like an odd choice for a theme song is all;  especially when there is so much great music on theDeath Note Tribute Music Soundtrack.All-in-all fans should be more or less pleased with this film, whose exceptional faithfulness to the source material should be commended.  But there are a lot of peope who will likely be put off from this movie the second Ryuk flies in in all his 2nd-rate CG glory.  The end of tis one leads into the sequel which is actually better and offers a new and superior conclusion to the already brilliant story of the manga/anime.  So have no fear ""Death Note"" fans; this one gets more right than most feature film adaptations.  However, I can't really recommend it to the average filmgoer.

1157839,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0017SVH5Q,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[24, 24]","Death Note is based on the popular manga (Japanese Comic) and loosely based on the anime series of the same name. I've never read the comic but I saw the anime series on imported dvd, and I have to say the Live-action version, Death Note and Death Note the Last Name does the franchise justice. This series is one of the best I've seen from Japan in a while. I will review both films because one movie while phenomenal and definitely can stand on its own, the story is very much linked together.Plot synopsis loosely derived from the DVD cover:In ""Death Note"", Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the role of Light Yagami, a genius law student who picks up the ""Death Note"" and uses it to ""cleanse"" the world of evil. Upholding justice obsesses him and he envisions himself as a god in the crime-less utopia he plans to create. As criminals continue to die in unexplainable ways, people start saying that it must be the work of a ""messiah"", of whom they call Kira. L, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, works for the International Criminal Police Organisation (ICPO) and is deployed to solve the Kira mystery.In ""Death Note 2: The Last Name"", the story continues as Light devises a plan to be part of the Kira Task Force headed by L. While the two geniuses are busy dealing with each other, a second Death Note drops into Earth. Rem, a Shinigami (Death God), brings the second notebook and Misa Amane (Erika Toda), a pop star and Kira worshipper, comes into possession of it. Becoming a Kira herself, she accepts the offer to have the 'Eyes of the Death' which will enable her to know the name of any person without being told.As Misa and Light work together to get rid of L, a new character, Kiyomi Takada (Nana Katase), comes into the picture as the third Kira. With the disclosure of the new rules of the Death Note, the mystery becomes more complex, with a satisfying storyline and a completely unpredictable finale.That's just scratching the surface, as Light continues to experiment with the capabilities of the book, as well as to internalize all the rules to call upon some serious manipulation of the rules to work to his advantage. Power corrupts absolutely--What would a human being do with the power of life and death?Man has no right to play GOD.This film reflects why imperfect human beings should not hold such power, men are fallible, vulnerable to desires and vanity. You see an almost accurate telling of one person's corruption and descent into madness, and how a genius can seem stupid. It also tries to reflect on the different views of a society and how a small ""nudge"" in the wrong (or right)direction by a government or individual can affect how things are seen by its people. The issue of capital punishment is also explored in both films. Some may say that the film also contains a social commentary.The battle of wits between L and Light Yagami is definitely one to watch; as the two geniuses struggle to stay one step ahead of the other. It is rather curious that such a complex match-up of intelligence also proves that the two are actually two sides of the same coin but on opposing sides. L is pretty much a charming if eccentric presence as the sugar-loving detective. I didn't know that sugar does provide energy for the brain until I observed him gulp down significant amounts of candy and dessert. The thing that proves Light Yagami quite dangerous is the fact that he believes that he is doing the right thing and whatever steps he has taken may seem cruel, it is justified. When one believes his cause his just, one becomes more determined than the common opponent.Death Note is smart storytelling, the plot twists and thrills are non-stop, each scene has a relevance to the next. The thrills/suspense are more CEREBRAL than visual with a very solid structure. The direction by Shusuke Kaneko effectively promotes intense energy and never lets up on the suspense, further accentuated by its twists and turns. Upon watching these two films, keep in mind that this is Fantasy-horror, the ""Death Gods"" have that manga/anime look, they may have that cartoonish look, but they look almost exactly like in the comic. Story-wise, it is pretty intense, it is genre-busting, battle of wits thriller that involves the supernatural world. (Although some anime films do surpass other films in terms of plot) I will stop here, since with this film, the less you know, the better it would be.Death Note 1 & 2 really caught my attention. This is intelligent storytelling and for the most part, kept me on the edge of my seat. It made a good transition from comic to film. The two dvds are very much worth every penny!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

1157840,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B0017SVH5Q,Zack Davisson,"[17, 18]","""Death Note"" was a much better flick than I was expecting. It was a huge hit in Japan, and because I had never read the original manga, I had avoided it thinking I wouldn't get the entire story. My loss, as it turns out.The cat-and-mouse detective game mixed with the fantasy elements of the gods of death and their magical books makes for an interesting story. The two main characters, ""L"" and Light, are an intense duo, and like the best of this genre of film it is hard to decide who to root for. Light (Tatsuya Fujiwara, ""Battle Royale""), known by the general public as the hero/murderer ""Killer"", is the holder of the Death Note, and has the power to kill anyone on Earth just by writing their name. A hardcore and brilliant student of criminal justice, he uses his power to erase the vermin of the world, serial killers, child rapists and gangsters. For the most part, his actions are praised, but he is still a murderer in the eyes of the law, and needs to be brought down. On his side is the Ryuuk, a Japanese god of death who gave Light the Death Note in order to keep himself entertained. Hunting him down in ""L"" (Ken'ichi Matsuyama, ""Linda,Linda, Linda""), a young, oddball genius with a penchant for sweets who keeps his name hidden in order to protect himself from the powers of the Death Note. L hunts Light, and Light hunts L, and it is never clear who is the person a step ahead, and who is the fly falling into the web.Director Shusuke Kaneko, who cut his teeth on Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman flicks, managed to keep the story close enough to the manga to please the fans while making it complete enough that newcomers don't feel that they are only getting a part of the picture. The CG animated Ryuuk stands out at first, but soon becomes a natural part of the storyline, and Kaneko's familiarity with the special effects learned from the monster films did him good service. All of the actors do a great job, particularly Fujiwara and Matsuyama as L and Light, who carry the movie on the strength of their performances.""Death Note"" was a great enough film that it had me running to pick up the sequel, which actually makes a single film ""Kill Bill""-style, as well as checking out the manga and the spin-off flick ""L:Change the World"".
