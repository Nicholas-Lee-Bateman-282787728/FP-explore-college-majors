That's a paraphrase.The quote is essential to this unique doc, about the sudden rise and precipitous fall of producer Robert Evans, and his current reassurgance. The quote is apt because, in narrating his own life story we get one of the three truths, and that truth is quite entertaining.Director's Nanette Burstein & Brett Morgen use none of the standard doc interviews, no filmed footage, and little archived stuff, but mostly stills and pans of various environments that Evans lived in.I value the doc for a character study and a history of Hollywood from someone who was in the trenches. It's one-sidedness is it's best and worst part. No Ali McGraw, no Coppola, no Nicholson, no Polanski, no Gulf+Western folks, etc. Evans is a hell of a showman, and a distinctly engrossing figure, from his look to his attitude to his wisdom.But Dustin Hoffman ends up stealing the film, at the last minute, over the credits, with a hilarious imitation, filmed during Marathon Man, one of several gag reels filmed in Evan's honor during the making of the 1976 film.",4,Unique doc about memorable Hollywood player,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,1239,"['opening', 'quote', 'Kid', 'Stays', 'Picture', 'are', 'three', 'truths', 'tale', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Truth', 'none', 'are', 'wrong', 'memory', 'serves', 'differently', 'paraphrase.The', 'quote', 'essential', 'unique', 'doc', 'sudden', 'rise', 'precipitous', 'fall', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'current', 'reassurgance', 'quote', 'apt', 'narrating', 'own', 'life', 'story', 'get', 'one', 'three', 'truths', 'truth', 'quite', 'entertaining.Director', 'Nanette', 'Burstein', 'Brett', 'Morgen', 'use', 'none', 'standard', 'doc', 'interviews', 'filmed', 'footage', 'little', 'archived', 'stuff', 'mostly', 'stills', 'pans', 'various', 'environments', 'Evans', 'lived', 'in.I', 'value', 'doc', 'character', 'study', 'history', 'Hollywood', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'trenches', 'one-sidedness', 'best', 'worst', 'part', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'Coppola', 'Nicholson', 'Polanski', 'Gulf+Western', 'folks', 'etc', 'Evans', 'hell', 'showman', 'distinctly', 'engrossing', 'figure', 'look', 'attitude', 'wisdom.But', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'up', 'stealing', 'film', 'last', 'minute', 'credits', 'hilarious', 'imitation', 'filmed', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'one', 'several', 'gag', 'reels', 'filmed', 'Evan', 'honor', 'making', '1976', 'film']",N/A

It was a great juxtaposition:  the young lion Evans on screen vs. the Evans in the flesh who had a serious stroke a couple of years back.  Its obvious that he's fought a tough road to recovery.It was also obvious that the release of 'Kid' was an important milestone for him.  As the film shows, Evans has been a battler all his life, so why stop now?  It's this atttitude that has brought him a whole new generation of fans.The movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.  When Evans' book was released in the early 90s, the print edition had no real impact.  The audio edition, however, was a sensation.  Narrated by Evans himself in his unmistakable gravelly baritone, the tapes became a cult sensation, passed around Hollywood like a forbidden, guilty pleasure.The film simply takes those original recordings and uses them as the soundtrack.  The majority of the images are compiled, amazingly enough, from photos of Evans' career, enhanced through some eye-popping innovation:  somehow, the filmmakers have turned the photos into 3-D like montages which appear to burst through the screen.  Combined with Evans' voice, it's a truly unique viewing experience.What makes the narration so compelling is Evans ability to do both sides of the various conversations he recounts, whether it's ex-wife and muse Ali McGraw, Jack Nicholson, Francis Ford Coppola or, most notably, then-Gulf &amp; Western CEO and conglomerater Charlie Bludhorn.  The Bludhorn imitation stands out.  Think Henry Kissinger as a modern-day robber baron and you get the idea.Of course, you're getting Evans' view here, and Evans' view alone, unencumbered by rebuttal.  In Evans' retelling, Coppola was headed into the abyss with 'The Godfather' until Bobby set him straight and gave him the appropriate vision.  Somehow, I think Coppola and Mario Puzo might have had a bigger hand in that than what Evans' imagination leads him to believe.  But you don't see this movie seeking the truth, just Robert Evans' version of it.

756600,A24M2KN27MDEXO,B00009PY57,bill_the_great,"[0, 0]","The Kid Stays in the Picture is a glitzy peek into Hollywood in the 70's as seen through the eyes of one of its prime movers: Robert Evans.  You may not have heard the name Robert Evans, but you've definitely seen movies he's produced: Rosemary's Baby, The Godfather and Chinatown are just the tip of the iceberg as far as his career goes.The documentary has a unique, but somewhat flawed, style.  The directors put up many of Mr. Evans' personal photographs (enhanced with 3D effects), TV and movie footage and have Evans himself narrate the entire movie (his narration is taken from book-on-tape version of his biography).  The period of his life covered from his discovery in a Beverly Hills swimming pool to his meteoric rise to fame to becoming persona non grata in Hollywood and back to acceptance in Tinseltown.  Evans' cool self-assesment provides a facinating look into one of the most volatile and creative decades in Hollywood history.  The only problem is that because Evans is the only person narrarating, the perspective, although very interesting, is somewhat limited.  Evans himself does not bore for a second in the film though.  His warbly barritone is almost hypnotic.I caught this movie by accident on HBO one afternoon, and I was thoroughly pleased with what I saw.  It was more compelling than most documentaries that are out on the market.

756601,AJDQ5EBQNDGLF,B00009PY57,Bob L,"[8, 8]","Maybe the most engaging documentary ever made. Brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the giants of the movie industry, producer Robert Evans. Giving magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that I could only describe as psychedelic.Being a film fanatic for the last 43 years I was shocked and ashamed to find that I had not heard of Robert Evans. In all my reading of credits over the years I had somehow missed his name. I had remembered seeing William Castle's name at the beginning of Rosemary's Baby but not Evan's. Then, at finding out that he was the driving force behind Love Story, The Godfather, The Godfather Pt.2, Chinatown and one of my personal favorites The President's Analyst and that he was a big reason why those movies were so good, well I was just dumbfounded. And these are just a fraction of the films he's produced.Of course he didn't start as a producer. He had been in women's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours as the reason why women wear pants today. While lounging around a pool one day he was discovered by Norma Shearer, lauching his career into show biz. It seems he knows everybody and I mean everybody.After watchng this extraordinary film I called my father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing personality. I queried, ""Have you ever heard of Robert Evans?"" anxiously awaiting a ""No"" so I could tell him all about this amazing show biz entity. He replied, ""You mean Bob Evans."" Yes indeed, it seems he knows EVERYBODY. My father had come across him in his days as a buyer for Macy's. I asked, ""Do you know what he does now?"" ""He's some sort of movie director or something now, isn't he."", Dad answered. I bought him the audiobook.Evans narrates both the documentary and the audiobook, both which are drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name. His voice is almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his prowess. He also lent his voice to the short-lived, hysterically irreverent cartoon series Kid Notorious that still airs on Comedy Central.All in all, whether you know Evans or not this is a fascinating, beautifully made film about a producer whose achievements are (IMHO) greater than Thalberg's. The story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends and it goes on and on. This is a must see for anyone interested in Tinseltown. PS:I don't usually care for the added features but these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the documentary are alone worth the price of the disc. What a hoot and more proof that he knows everybody. Ask your dad.

756602,A2CZPM110DW516,B00009PY57,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[6, 7]","There was a time, still basking in the innocence of childhood, when I tended to see film stars as possessing a perfection that we mortals lacked. But that was also a time when we didn't know much about the stars other than what was on the screen. Movie fans had to rely on the puff pieces in Photoplay that had more in common with press agentry than journalism.Now, in an age when celebrities are covered around the clock by a &quot;news&quot; media desperate to hang on to a dwindling audience, every rock is upturned and the snakes beneath them are crawling out, hissing uncontrollably as we watch in horror. When I think of Hollywood now, I remember the scene in &quot;The Shining&quot; when Jack Nicholson enters a bathroom to see a stunningly beautiful woman emerge from the tub. He embraces her only to be shocked that the woman is actually a withered old hag, and a dead one at that.The movies are make-believe, but more and more it looks like the people who make them are make-believe, too. The starstruck audience has let withered old hags, dead in all but the literal sense, con us into believing they are great beauties. The biggest star and the devoted fan seem to be kindred spirits, both of them living vicariously through a carefully constructed image to give meaning to an otherwise empty life.Robert Evans seems like a combination of both the star and the starstruck fan. Never a &quot;star&quot; in the traditional sense, Evans toiled behind-the-scenes, but like a ventriloquist who's jealous that the dummy gets all the laughs, he could never keep his permanently tanned mug out of the spotlight. On the surface, this fallen Hollywood kingpin's life looks like one to envy, but it's all so lacking substance that it might as well be the gateway to hell. Evans strikes me as the epitome of the man who had everything that money can buy, but desperately needed more to fill a void that only seemed to grow with success. I find his story, as told in this one-sided documentary, more depressing than entertaining, although I admit it's the latter, as well.If everything you know about the period covered in this film comes from Evans, you'd wonder why the Hollywood sign hasn't been replaced with a statue in his image. Inexplicably chosen to head Paramount Pictures in the late Sixties, after bombing out as an actor in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and such drek as &quot;The Fiend Who Walked the West,&quot; he takes credit for saving the studio with box-office hits like &quot;Love Story&quot; and &quot;The Godfather.&quot; No doubt Evans played a role in the studio's resurgance, but he takes more credit than he seems to deserve, claiming he convinced Francis Ford Coppola to add &quot;texture&quot; to the gangster movie that Evans insists the director saw as little more than a shoot-em-up B movie. But if Coppola thought so little of &quot;The Godfather&quot; and its potential, why would he work so hard to cast Marlon Brando against Paramount's objections at a time when Brando's reputation as the world's greatest actor meant nothing next to the string of bombs he starred in throughout the Sixites?For that matter, can Evans rightfully claim he &quot;produced&quot; any of the films made under his reign as Paramount's top gun? The producer's credit for &quot;The Godfather&quot; went to Al Ruddy, who accepted the Oscar when the film was named Best Picture. In his book, Evans claims Ruddy was merely &quot;appointed,&quot; but it's hard to imagine a man of Evans's monumental ego not seizing credit especially if it rightfully belonged to him. As for the other hits that saved the magic mountain, &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; was produced by William Castle, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; was produced by Howard Koch, &quot;Love Story&quot; was produced by Howard Minsky, and on and on and on with Evans never earning an on-screen credit for anything until &quot;Chinatown.&quot;But Evans wasn't content to be the head of a studio with the power to greenlight a project. He wanted to be a star! Hence his weird biography (in which every conversation sounds like it came from a 30's gangster movie) and this so-called documentary.This &quot;documentary,&quot; like the book it's based on, is fascinating  for all the wrong reasons. It's meant to be some kind of tribute to Evans and his success, but it simply exposes him as the vainest of empty shells. The Kid stays in the picture all right, but only by vandalizing the true portrait with ego, half-truths, and lies.",4,...but what of the frame?,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,4494,"['was', 'time', 'still', 'basking', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'when', 'tended', 'see', 'film', 'stars', 'possessing', 'perfection', 'mortals', 'lacked', 'was', 'also', 'time', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'stars', 'other', 'what', 'was', 'screen', 'Movie', 'fans', 'had', 'rely', 'puff', 'pieces', 'Photoplay', 'had', 'more', 'common', 'press', 'agentry', 'journalism.Now', 'age', 'when', 'celebrities', 'are', 'covered', 'clock', 'quot', 'news', 'quot', 'media', 'desperate', 'hang', 'dwindling', 'audience', 'rock', 'upturned', 'snakes', 'are', 'crawling', 'out', 'hissing', 'uncontrollably', 'watch', 'horror', 'When', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'remember', 'scene', 'quot', 'Shining', 'quot', 'when', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'bathroom', 'see', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'emerge', 'tub', 'only', 'be', 'shocked', 'woman', 'actually', 'withered', 'old', 'hag', 'dead', 'one', 'that.The', 'movies', 'are', 'make-believe', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'are', 'make-believe', 'too', 'starstruck', 'audience', 'let', 'withered', 'old', 'hags', 'dead', 'literal', 'sense', 'con', 'believing', 'are', 'great', 'beauties', 'biggest', 'star', 'devoted', 'fan', 'seem', 'be', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'living', 'vicariously', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'image', 'give', 'meaning', 'otherwise', 'empty', 'life.Robert', 'Evans', 'combination', 'star', 'starstruck', 'fan', 'Never', 'quot', 'star', 'quot', 'traditional', 'sense', 'Evans', 'toiled', 'behind-the-scenes', 'ventriloquist', 'who', 'jealous', 'dummy', 'laughs', 'could', 'never', 'keep', 'permanently', 'tanned', 'mug', 'spotlight', 'surface', 'fallen', 'Hollywood', 'kingpin', 'life', 'one', 'envy', 'so', 'lacking', 'substance', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'gateway', 'hell', 'Evans', 'strikes', 'epitome', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'everything', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'desperately', 'needed', 'more', 'fill', 'void', 'only', 'seemed', 'grow', 'success', 'find', 'story', 'told', 'one-sided', 'documentary', 'more', 'depressing', 'entertaining', 'admit', 'latter', 'well.If', 'everything', 'know', 'period', 'covered', 'film', 'Evans', ""'d"", 'wonder', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'sign', ""n't"", 'been', 'replaced', 'statue', 'image', 'Inexplicably', 'chosen', 'head', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'late', 'Sixties', 'bombing', 'out', 'actor', 'quot', 'Sun', 'Also', 'Rises', 'quot', 'such', 'drek', 'quot', 'Fiend', 'Who', 'Walked', 'West', 'quot', 'credit', 'saving', 'studio', 'box-office', 'hits', 'quot', 'Love', 'Story', 'quot', 'quot', 'Godfather.', 'quot', 'No', 'doubt', 'Evans', 'played', 'role', 'studio', 'resurgance', 'more', 'credit', 'deserve', 'claiming', 'convinced', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'add', 'quot', 'texture', 'quot', 'gangster', 'movie', 'director', 'saw', 'little', 'more', 'shoot-em-up', 'B', 'movie', 'Coppola', 'thought', 'so', 'little', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'potential', 'why', 'would', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'cast', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Paramount', 'objections', 'time', 'when', 'Brando', 'reputation', 'world', 'greatest', 'actor', 'meant', 'nothing', 'next', 'string', 'bombs', 'starred', 'Sixites', 'matter', 'can', 'Evans', 'rightfully', 'quot', 'produced', 'quot', 'films', 'made', 'reign', 'Paramount', 'top', 'gun', 'producer', 'credit', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'went', 'Al', 'Ruddy', 'who', 'accepted', 'Oscar', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'named', 'Best', 'Picture', 'book', 'Evans', 'Ruddy', 'was', 'merely', 'quot', 'appointed', 'quot', 'hard', 'imagine', 'man', 'Evans', 'monumental', 'ego', 'not', 'seizing', 'credit', 'especially', 'rightfully', 'belonged', 'other', 'hits', 'saved', 'magic', 'mountain', 'quot', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'quot', 'was', 'produced', 'William', 'Castle', 'quot', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'quot', 'was', 'produced', 'Howard', 'Koch', 'quot', 'Love', 'Story', 'quot', 'was', 'produced', 'Howard', 'Minsky', 'Evans', 'never', 'earning', 'on-screen', 'credit', 'anything', 'quot', 'Chinatown.', 'quot', 'Evans', 'was', ""n't"", 'content', 'be', 'head', 'studio', 'power', 'greenlight', 'project', 'wanted', 'be', 'star', 'Hence', 'weird', 'biography', 'conversation', 'came', '30', 'gangster', 'movie', 'so-called', 'documentary.This', 'quot', 'documentary', 'quot', 'book', 'based', 'fascinating', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'meant', 'be', 'kind', 'tribute', 'Evans', 'success', 'simply', 'vainest', 'empty', 'shells', 'Kid', 'picture', 'right', 'only', 'vandalizing', 'true', 'portrait', 'ego', 'half-truths']",N/A

Legendary producer Robert Evans (""The Godfather"", ""Chinatown"") provides the voiceover for this overview of his career with a bemused, world-weary delivery recalling William Holden in ""Sunset Boulevard"" (this guy's life story could easily eat up an entire season of the E! network's ""True Story"" episodes). Evans has a knack for recounting immensely compelling, almost mythic backstage tales that manage to be hilarious and harrowing all at once. His candor and self-deprecating charm is so disarming that you'll find yourself leaning into the screen at times as if you were sitting in a quiet bar catching up with an old friend (the man is definitely a ""closer""). Directors Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein do a masterful job blending film clips, stills and subtly moody shots of Evans' gothic Hollywood mansion. Anyone who claims to be a ""film buff"" would be doing themselves a disservice if they miss this one. Be sure to watch the credits for a funny and priceless ""home movie"" clip featuring Dustin Hoffman doing an uncanny, riotously profane Evans impression (Hoffman supposedly based his character in ""Wag The Dog"" on long-time pal Evans).",5,Hollywood Babylon Redux,1031097600,"09 4, 2002",2002,1284,"['Forget', 'Player', 'Kid', 'Stays', 'Picture', 'most', 'audacious', 'unapologetic', 'revealing', 'look', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'Legendary', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'Godfather', 'Chinatown', 'voiceover', 'overview', 'career', 'bemused', 'world-weary', 'delivery', 'recalling', 'William', 'Holden', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'guy', 'life', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'eat', 'up', 'entire', 'season', 'E', 'network', 'True', 'Story', 'episodes', 'Evans', 'knack', 'recounting', 'immensely', 'compelling', 'almost', 'mythic', 'backstage', 'tales', 'manage', 'be', 'hilarious', 'harrowing', 'once', 'candor', 'self-deprecating', 'charm', 'so', 'disarming', ""'ll"", 'find', 'leaning', 'screen', 'times', 'were', 'sitting', 'quiet', 'bar', 'catching', 'up', 'old', 'friend', 'man', 'definitely', 'closer', 'Directors', 'Brett', 'Morgen', 'Nanette', 'Burstein', 'do', 'masterful', 'job', 'blending', 'film', 'clips', 'stills', 'subtly', 'moody', 'shots', 'Evans', 'gothic', 'Hollywood', 'mansion', 'Anyone', 'who', 'be', 'film', 'buff', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'disservice', 'miss', 'one', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'credits', 'funny', 'priceless', 'home', 'movie', 'clip', 'featuring', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'doing', 'uncanny', 'riotously', 'profane', 'Evans', 'impression', 'Hoffman', 'supposedly', 'based', 'character', 'Wag', 'Dog', 'long-time', 'pal', 'Evans']",N/A

A unique,brilliant and volatile force of nature that Hollywood doesn't produce anymore.  His story is the stuff that dreams and nightmares are made of.  And if you stay with this picture you'll see both and then some. From a short mediocre acting career to the heights of movie moguldom at Paramount, its a warts and all look at Evans' Hollywood narrated by the man himself.THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE manages to be both entertaining and educational.  Profound and profane and hardly suitable for ""This Is Your Life"" as so many legends from old Hollywood were remembered.  Evans gets his iconic life interlocked with the very iconic movies he created.  ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Love Story"", ""The Godfather"" to ""Chinatown and ""The Cotton Club"", to name just a few.  Paramount Pictures was the first Hollywood studio to be bought by a conglomerate. For Evans it was perfect timing, as he tells it in the picture but even better and more to the point, as documented in Gus Russo's book ""Supermob"" (also available on Amazon).  It wasn't just perfect timing, but having the right friend to recommend you to the powers that be.  He's briefly mentioned in the picture, but when it comes to power inside of Hollywood and out of it, Sidney Korshak is the man who takes care of business.  But thats another story.The producers could have easily found a thousand people to talk about Bob, but then that would have made it just another routine fluffy biography.

If you're a film-buff of a particular stripe (one at least somewhat caught up in Hollywood lore) this may be the film for you. If, like many people, you enjoy at least some Hollywood product but are not particularly fascinated by its machinations, then it may be one you can pass up. Me, well, I'm kinda in between.

Narrated by Evans himself and illustrated with interviews, movie clips, publicity photos and paparazzi footage, ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" traces the career of this iconic Hollywood producer from his serendipitous introduction to the film industry in the 1950's to his return to Paramount pictures in the 1990's after a long estrangement. Robert Evans' already had a successful career and great prospects with Evan Picone's fashion house when he was discovered poolside by Norma Shearer and immediately asked to play the part of her late husband in the film ""Man of a Thousand Faces "". That kind of incredible, but double-edged, luck would come to characterize Evans' film career and his life. He became a magnet for controversy when Ernest Hemingway demanded that Evans be removed from his second film role, that of Pedro Romero in the film adaptation of Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"". Producer Darryl Zanuck disagreed, however, and declared, ""The kid stays in the picture!"" to all who would oppose him. Thus, Zanuck gave Robert Evans the title for his future autobiography and a new goal: to become a producer. Robert Evans tells us the story of his surprising meteoric rise to the head of Paramount pictures in 1967, then the 9th most successful studio in Hollywood, and how he transformed Paramount into Hollywood's premier studio. Among the most entertaining stories from that ""Second Golden Age"" of Hollywood, the 1970's,  are Evans' search for a director for Mario Puzo's book ""The Godfather"" and his insistence that Francis Ford Coppola make the film longer, and his battle of wills with Frank Sinatra to get Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" finished. Evans speaks honestly of his marriage to actress Ali MacGraw and the legal troubles which ended his tenure at Paramount and left him in financial ruin in the 1980's. Movie buffs and fans of Hollywood lore will enjoy ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"".

That one covered the first golden age of American Film.  The second golden age happened because a young Jewish businessman from New York ran into silent film legend Norma Shearer at a Beverley Hills hotel, and then was propelled into acting.  He played the Spanish matador in The Sun Also Rises, a film based on Ernest Hemingway's book.  This led to a minor film career that went poof in the fifties, so the young man bought rights to a few novels for peanuts: you know, The Godfather, Love Story, Marathon Man, and Serpico.  The next thing he knew, he was running Paramount Pictures and dating every beautiful woman in California.  He also discovered cocaine in the 80's and at the same time, a distant association with a murdered producer tarnished his image, so that he couldn't work in this town again.  Then he got his job back and made more pictures.  This all happened to Robert Evans.

756621,A35KFRFSHMC0QJ,B00009PY57,Robert DeRose,"[1, 2]","There is a scene in the middle of Brett Morgan and Nanelle Burnstein's documentary, ""The Kid Stays In The Picture"" which illustrates why its fascinating subject, film producer Robert Evans, has earned his notorious reputation in Hollywood and has been able to survive there for decades.The year is 1969. The United States is not only fighting a war overseas but is in the middle of a major culture war at home. The movie business is a state of disarray.  Evans, in charge of film production at Paramount Studios, is called by the company chiefs to fly to New York for a meeting.  Rumor has it that not only will Evans and others lose their jobs but Paramount Studios may shut down altogether. Prior to the meeting, Evans has an idea.  He hires director Mike Nichols(""The Graduate"")to film a five minute ""advertisment"".  The ad simply consists of Evans talking to the camera and expounding, as only Evans can, why the future of Paramount should not only continue but why it will it return as a powerhouse in Hollywood. Deceptively straighforward and simple, Evans sways the executives to keep Paramount's gates open and the rest, as they say, is show business history.""The Kid Stays In The Picture"" is a documentary based on Evans' book of the same title.  The film is narrated by Evans in a voice that can only be described as undescribable.  Evans tells his story, for the most part, chronologically beginning in New York where Evans and his brother, as young adults, were involved in the production of women's clothing.  Having childhood ties to the movie business, Evans was discovered(or some would say rediscovered)while swimming in a pool in Beverly Hills.  From there, he got a role opposite James Cagney in ""The Man With 1,000 Faces."" He appeared in two more feature films before it became clear that he didn't have a promising acting career ahead of him.  Having always a desire to be behind the camera, Evans moved ahead, made some very smart moves, and ended up being picked by Paramount head Charles Bludhorn to be the top film producer for the studio.It becomes clear that Evans' rise to the top of the industry is not only due to his take charge and gutsy personality but also his uncanny future vision.  At the same time Evans was beginning his career at Paramount in the the mid to late 60's, the youth movement across the country was in full bloom.  There was clearly a ""new guard"" vs ""old guard"" mentality in Hollywood thatwas emerging.  Unlike a lot of producers at the time, Evans was smart enough to find and attract the young writers, directors and actors who began to make up the ""New Hollywood"" in the late 60's and early 70's. With movies like ""The Godfather"", ""Love Story""(he ended up marrying star Ali McGraw), ""The Odd Couple"", and ""Chinatown"", Evans moved Paramount from last to first in annual ticket sales.If Evans' story had stopped in 1975, he would have already been a legend in Hollywood.  Unfortunately, in Hollywood, what goes up always comes down, and Evans was no exception. Admitting that prior to the 70's, he rarely drank, Evans tells his story of how he became one of many cocaine victims during the decade and was, ultimately, shunned by Hollwood for years.  To make matters worse, by the time the mid- 80's rolled around, Evans' name was being conected to a drug related murder in which he was never a suspect.All these details are told with fascinating intensity by Evan as he narrates his life story over a surreal montage of still vintage photos and videos.  One of things I love about this movie is how honest Evans is with himself.  Yes, he may seem cocky or pompous, however, there is a very clear self-depreciating attitude thought out the film as well.  He is also not afraid to have some of his contempt(justified or not)spill forward. His famous conflicts with director Francis Ford Coppola are now Hollywood folklore and are documented here(when receiving his Academy Award at the Oscars for ""The Godfather"", Coppola ""forgot"" to thank the producer).After viewing the ""The Kid Stays In The Picture"", I began to wonder why I loved it so much.  I grew up in the 80's and 90's and I didn't really know much about Evans until I read Peter Biskind's masterpiece, ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"".  That book, along with this film, records an incredible age in Hollywood that exisited in the late 60's and 70's.  An age  where the films that were produced were films bursting energy and creativity which we have not seen since that time. Producers, directors, actors and other involved wanted to make money but they also wanted to make smart, cutting edge films that didn't always conform.  Today, with marketing at the center of the creative element in today's films, conforming is now the desired result. ""The Kid Stays In The Picture"" recalls a brief period of time in Hollywood when that wasn't so.Note: Watch the credits of this movie.

756622,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00009PY57,Robert Moore,"[2, 2]","This could also have been entitled ""The Comeback Kid.""  Though the initial purpose of this documentary on the life and career of famed producer Robert Evans was perhaps to act as a nice coda to a colorful riches to rags story, in fact it has served to put Evans back in the public eye and revive his career as a producer.  Only five years ago Evans was largely a forgotten man, but today he has a number of projects underway.  No doubt this is in part due to having his various legal problems behind him, but clearly his memoir, which was then made into this documentary, played a major role.THE KID STAYS IN THE PICUTRE is not your typical documentary.  For one thing, the only person who talks to the camera is the subject of the film.  This is hardly a mea culpa or apologia.  It is more of a warts and all self-affirmation of everything Evans has experienced in his career.  Much is left out.  There is surprisingly little detail on his love life excepting his romance with Ali McGraw, which was clearly the dominant relationship of his life.  But there is a frank acknowledgment of many errors made combined with an attitude that could be summed up, ""Well, I made a mess, but at least it was my mess.""The heart of the film concerns Evans's triumphs as a producer.  Certainly few producers not named Weinstein have been involved in so many remarkable films.  ROSEMARY'S BABY, LOVE STORY, THE GODFATHER, CHINATOWN, MARATHON MAN, and THE COTTON CLUB are only a few of the many films he was involved on.  There are many fascinating stories about many of these, though for me the most fascinating was the behind the scenes footage taken during the filming of ROSEMARY'S BABY.  Another great moment is the short film that Evans made for the corporate powers that be who wanted to pull the plug on THE GODFATHER.Almost as important as Evans as a character in the film is his beautiful home.  There is shot after shot of the grounds and the film finally ends with the only contemporary shot of Evans in the documentary, showing him sitting inside simply being Robert Evans.  If the film has a nadir, it comes when Evans was forced to sell his beloved home to a wealthy foreigner.  When he wanted to repurchase the home the man wouldn't agree to do so.  But Evans's friend Jack Nicholson took matters in his own hands and flew to visit the man, literally getting on his knees to beg him to sell the house back to Evans.  He relented and one of the most touching moments in the movie was the camera zooming in on the welcome home card that Nicholson wrote Evans.All in all, film fans will find this to be an interesting and highly entertaining documentary.  Evans has had a colorful life, making his share of mistakes, suffering his share of both really great and truly awful luck, but sticking it out.  And partly because of this film, the kid did manage to stay in the picture, and his name will unquestionably appear on a few more films in the years to come.",4,An entertaining exploration of a fascinating Hollywood personality,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,2956,"['could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'entitled', 'Comeback', 'Kid', 'initial', 'purpose', 'documentary', 'life', 'career', 'famed', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'was', 'perhaps', 'act', 'nice', 'coda', 'colorful', 'riches', 'rags', 'story', 'fact', 'served', 'put', 'Evans', 'back', 'public', 'eye', 'revive', 'career', 'producer', 'Only', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'Evans', 'was', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'man', 'today', 'number', 'projects', 'underway', 'No', 'doubt', 'part', 'due', 'having', 'various', 'legal', 'problems', 'clearly', 'memoir', 'was', 'then', 'made', 'documentary', 'played', 'major', 'role.THE', 'KID', 'STAYS', 'IN', 'THE', 'PICUTRE', 'not', 'typical', 'documentary', 'one', 'thing', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'camera', 'subject', 'film', 'hardly', 'mea', 'culpa', 'apologia', 'more', 'warts', 'self-affirmation', 'everything', 'Evans', 'experienced', 'career', 'Much', 'left', 'out', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'detail', 'love', 'life', 'excepting', 'romance', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'was', 'clearly', 'dominant', 'relationship', 'life', 'frank', 'acknowledgment', 'many', 'errors', 'made', 'combined', 'attitude', 'could', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'Well', 'made', 'mess', 'least', 'was', 'mess', 'heart', 'film', 'concerns', 'Evans', 'triumphs', 'producer', 'Certainly', 'few', 'producers', 'not', 'named', 'Weinstein', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'so', 'many', 'remarkable', 'films', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'CHINATOWN', 'MARATHON', 'MAN', 'THE', 'COTTON', 'CLUB', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'many', 'films', 'was', 'involved', 'are', 'many', 'fascinating', 'stories', 'many', 'though', 'most', 'fascinating', 'was', 'scenes', 'footage', 'taken', 'filming', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'great', 'moment', 'short', 'film', 'made', 'corporate', 'powers', 'be', 'who', 'wanted', 'pull', 'plug', 'THE', 'GODFATHER.Almost', 'as', 'important', 'Evans', 'character', 'film', 'beautiful', 'home', 'shot', 'shot', 'grounds', 'film', 'finally', 'only', 'contemporary', 'shot', 'Evans', 'documentary', 'showing', 'sitting', 'inside', 'simply', 'being', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'film', 'nadir', 'when', 'Evans', 'was', 'forced', 'sell', 'beloved', 'home', 'wealthy', 'foreigner', 'When', 'wanted', 'repurchase', 'home', 'man', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree', 'do', 'so', 'Evans', 'friend', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'took', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'flew', 'visit', 'man', 'literally', 'getting', 'knees', 'beg', 'sell', 'house', 'back', 'Evans', 'relented', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'moments', 'movie', 'was', 'camera', 'zooming', 'welcome', 'home', 'card', 'Nicholson', 'wrote', 'Evans.All', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'interesting', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'documentary', 'Evans', 'had', 'colorful', 'life', 'making', 'share', 'mistakes', 'suffering', 'share', 'really', 'great', 'truly', 'awful', 'luck', 'sticking', 'out', 'partly', 'film', 'kid', 'did', 'manage', 'stay', 'picture', 'name', 'will', 'unquestionably', 'appear', 'few', 'more', 'films', 'years', 'come']",N/A

756624,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00009PY57,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""The Kid Stays in the Picture,"" a documentary about famed movie producer and studio head Robert Evans, begins like ""The Great Gatsby,"" a film Evans produced in 1974.  To the wistful strains of ""What'll I Do?"" playing in the background, the camera glides lovingly over the furnishings, pictures and memorabilia that adorn Evans' Bel Air mansion and estate.  The comparison is an apt one, for, like Gatsby, Evans was a wunderkind, a handsome young go-getter who knew early on the kind of life he wanted to lead and who willed himself to attain it.  With a combination of good looks, charm, ambition and just a bit of plain old-fashioned good luck, he managed to go from being a mediocre movie actor to becoming the head of Paramount Studios in the course of a mere decade.  And what a decade it was!  Evans had a major hand in not only lifting Paramount from ninth to first place among Hollywood's major studios, but in bringing such films as ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""True Grit,"" ""Love Story,"" ""Chinatown"" and, of course, ""The Godfather"" to movie screens everywhere.""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is a dream-come-true for hardcore cinephiles, providing a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into one of the true Golden Ages of Hollywood filmmaking.  Evans' story is, in fact, the story of that time, for truly he hobnobbed with virtually every one of the key players responsible for that era.  Evans' tale follows a fairly conventional arc for men of his type: the ambitious kid with dreams of larger-than-life glory achieves meteoric success in the entertainment business only to have his ambitions dashed on the shores of rampant egotism, overconfidence and drug addiction.  In fact, Evans' life would make perfect fodder for a film of its own, as this documentary and the positive response to it demonstrates.  Evans himself narrates the film, and although he tends to be a bit easier on himself than an outsider might have been, he is still willing to chastise himself when he feels it's called for and to render some rather startlingly unflattering assessments of certain major players on the Hollywood scene.  He is, also, however, utterly devoted to those he feels have stuck by him through good times and bad, and he is not averse to lavishing praise on others when it is due.  One objection to Evans' narration is that he doesn't always speak with the utmost clarity, sometimes making what he says come out garbled and incomprehensible.As a piece of filmmaking, ""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" offers a kaleidoscopic array of stills, film clips and reenactments that reflect the temper and mood of the time.  Directors Brett Morgan and Nanette Burstein obviously pored through a wealth of material on the subject, culling from it a comprehensive, streamlined and fast-moving narrative that grips the audience with its humor, its sadness and its tribute to the indomitableness of the human spirit.  For if Evans' story is about anything, it is about how important it is for each individual to achieve his dreams and how equally vital it is for that same person, once he has fallen down, to pick himself up off the floor so that he can continue pursuing that dream.""The Kid Stays in the Picture"" is a wonderful time capsule for those who love movies.

756625,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00009PY57,Samuel McKewon,"[7, 9]","&quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot; is a pull-no-punches chronicle of Hollywood producer Robert Evans' rise and fall in the movie business; narrated by Evans himself with one of the better voices you've ever heard, it either interests you or it doesn't, that interest directly proportional to one's fondness and intellectual investment in the movie business itself.Evans was on his way to becoming an Evan Piccone pants mogul in the 1960s when Norma Shearer spotted him by a Beverly Hills pool and insisted he be cast as her husband, Hollywood mogul Irving Thalberg, in the Lon Chaney biopic, &quot;The Man with 1,000 Faces.&quot; He got the role, and later kept a plum role as the bullfighter in &quot;The Sun Also Rises,&quot; despite the protests of Ernest Hemingway and Ava Gardner, when studio chief Daryl Zanuck visited the set, watched Evans perform a scene and said, &quot;The kid stays the in picture.&quot; From that moment forward, Evans didn't want to be the kid. He wanted to be Zanuck.And Zanuck he would become for Paramount Studios, which, at the time he took it over, was well behind giants 20th Century and MGM, not to mention six others. But Evans bought a book, &quot;Rosemary's Baby,&quot; and found a director, Roman Polanski, that put the studio closer to the Hollywood epicenter. Paramount became the epicenter a few years later when a 30-year-old actress, Ali MacGraw, presented Evans with a project, &quot;Love Story,&quot; and, later, her hand in marriage. It touched off a classic movie run that included &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Chinatown&quot;The &quot;rise&quot; portion of the film is its best, as Evans recalls the beautiful, mercurial MacGraw in their first meetings - &quot;for a hippee,&quot; Evans says, &quot;she sure was comfortable in my pool&quot; - through her affair with Steve McQueen, for whom she walked from roles in &quot;Chinatown&quot; and &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; Soon after, Evans opted out of Paramount for his own producing deal and fared well through the 1970s before, in, 1979, becoming a coke addict, getting arrested for trying to buying pharmaceutical grade in 1980, then producing a boondoggle in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; 1984 - which also deep-sixed director Francis Ford Coppola's career as an important movie director. By late 80s, Evans was broke, out of the house he'd owned for 20 years, admitting himself a mental hospital and beginning a comeback that led to another producing deal with Paramount, albeit with movies a cut below Academy Award fare.Directors Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen don't exactly use a camera, but compile archive footage, photo stills and cutouts to create a running stream of images, a motion picture collage of sorts, under (and sometimes over) Evans' narration. Only occasionally do the directors interject images that tell the story beyond Evans' words - in one case, as Evans describes his mental hospital stay, scenes from Paramount rush forth in an interesting commentary about the weight of prominent history on a fallen giant.&quot;Kid&quot; suffers from this approach, too - it would have been nice to see a Coppola interview, or a Polanski interview, or, if it could have been swung, a few minutes with the reclusive MacGraw. Evans doesn't hide from his foibles, but it is difficult, until Dustin Hoffman channels him in a spoof during the credits, to understand just what Evans could be like; if the imitation is to be believed - and it is - the laconic narrator is not exactly what he seems. Other times, Evans just lies - he says &quot;Chinatown&quot; won every award there was to win, when in fact, as good as it was, the movie played second fiddle to &quot;The Godfather, Part II.&quot;  The advantage of Evans' narration is clear; the lack of balance negates some of it.Yet the documentary's speed and directness puts it a cut above the typical A&amp;E Biography material. Evans is droll, wise and regretful; he speaks like a man who tasted the top, and, not unlike the John Huston character in &quot;Chinatown,&quot; would very much trade his respectability for a taste again.",3,The rise and fall of a Hollywood Kid.,1065052800,"10 2, 2003",2003,4113,"['quot', 'Kid', 'Stays', 'Picture', 'quot', 'pull-no-punches', 'chronicle', 'Hollywood', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'rise', 'fall', 'movie', 'business', 'narrated', 'Evans', 'one', 'better', 'voices', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'interests', ""n't"", 'interest', 'directly', 'proportional', 'one', 'fondness', 'intellectual', 'investment', 'movie', 'business', 'itself.Evans', 'was', 'way', 'becoming', 'Evan', 'Piccone', 'pants', 'mogul', '1960s', 'when', 'Norma', 'Shearer', 'spotted', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'pool', 'insisted', 'be', 'cast', 'husband', 'Hollywood', 'mogul', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'biopic', 'quot', 'Man', '1,000', 'Faces.', 'quot', 'got', 'role', 'later', 'kept', 'plum', 'role', 'bullfighter', 'quot', 'Sun', 'Also', 'Rises', 'quot', 'protests', 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'when', 'studio', 'chief', 'Daryl', 'Zanuck', 'visited', 'set', 'watched', 'Evans', 'perform', 'scene', 'said', 'quot', 'kid', 'picture.', 'quot', 'moment', 'forward', 'Evans', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'kid', 'wanted', 'be', 'Zanuck.And', 'Zanuck', 'would', 'become', 'Paramount', 'Studios', 'time', 'took', 'over', 'was', 'well', 'giants', '20th', 'Century', 'MGM', 'not', 'mention', 'six', 'others', 'Evans', 'bought', 'book', 'quot', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'quot', 'found', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'put', 'studio', 'closer', 'Hollywood', 'epicenter', 'Paramount', 'became', 'epicenter', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'when', '30-year-old', 'actress', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'presented', 'Evans', 'project', 'quot', 'Love', 'Story', 'quot', 'later', 'hand', 'marriage', 'touched', 'off', 'classic', 'movie', 'run', 'included', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'quot', 'Chinatown', 'quot', 'quot', 'rise', 'quot', 'portion', 'film', 'best', 'Evans', 'beautiful', 'mercurial', 'MacGraw', 'first', 'meetings', 'quot', 'hippee', 'quot', 'Evans', 'quot', 'sure', 'was', 'comfortable', 'pool', 'quot', 'affair', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'whom', 'walked', 'roles', 'quot', 'Chinatown', 'quot', 'quot', 'Great', 'Gatsby.', 'quot', 'Soon', 'Evans', 'opted', 'Paramount', 'own', 'producing', 'deal', 'fared', 'well', '1970s', '1979', 'becoming', 'coke', 'addict', 'getting', 'arrested', 'trying', 'buying', 'pharmaceutical', 'grade', '1980', 'then', 'producing', 'boondoggle', 'quot', 'Cotton', 'Club', 'quot', '1984', 'also', 'deep-sixed', 'director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'career', 'important', 'movie', 'director', 'late', '80s', 'Evans', 'was', 'broke', 'house', ""'d"", 'owned', '20', 'years', 'admitting', 'mental', 'hospital', 'beginning', 'comeback', 'led', 'producing', 'deal', 'Paramount', 'movies', 'cut', 'Academy', 'Award', 'fare.Directors', 'Nanette', 'Burstein', 'Brett', 'Morgen', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'use', 'camera', 'compile', 'archive', 'footage', 'photo', 'stills', 'cutouts', 'create', 'running', 'stream', 'images', 'motion', 'picture', 'collage', 'sorts', 'sometimes', 'Evans', 'narration', 'Only', 'occasionally', 'do', 'directors', 'interject', 'images', 'tell', 'story', 'Evans', 'words', 'one', 'case', 'Evans', 'mental', 'hospital', 'stay', 'scenes', 'Paramount', 'rush', 'forth', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'weight', 'prominent', 'history', 'fallen', 'giant.', 'quot', 'Kid', 'quot', 'suffers', 'approach', 'too', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'Coppola', 'interview', 'Polanski', 'interview', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'swung', 'few', 'minutes', 'reclusive', 'MacGraw', 'Evans', ""n't"", 'hide', 'foibles', 'difficult', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'spoof', 'credits', 'understand', 'just', 'what', 'Evans', 'could', 'be', 'imitation', 'be', 'believed', 'laconic', 'narrator', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'Other', 'times', 'Evans', 'just', 'quot', 'Chinatown', 'quot', 'award', 'was', 'win', 'when', 'fact', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'movie', 'played', 'second', 'fiddle', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II.', 'quot', 'advantage', 'Evans', 'narration', 'clear', 'lack', 'balance', 'negates', 'it.Yet', 'documentary', 'speed', 'directness', 'cut', 'typical', 'A', 'amp', 'E', 'Biography', 'material', 'Evans', 'droll', 'wise', 'regretful', 'man', 'who', 'tasted', 'top', 'not', 'John', 'Huston', 'character', 'quot', 'Chinatown', 'quot', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'trade', 'respectability', 'taste', 'again']",N/A

756628,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00009PY57,Shashank Tripathi,"[3, 3]","The casual viewer of the life of Bob Evans, a man who spent most of his working life as a successful Paramount Pictures executive and creative producer would say that he was the kind of man who could accidentally fall into a cesspool and emerge with two fistfuls of cash.That casual observer would be correct. Evans was born connected, good looking and charismatic. What the casual observer might not know, however, is that Evans is also visionary, intelligent, hard working and committed. His sharp dress and looks belie his New York City vulgar idiom, something that shaped his overall persona.This beautifully realized memoir is a must- see for any Hollywood aficionado. Evans narrates it in a natural, unaffected way, one can imagine, the way he would tell you across an intimate dinner table, making you wince and chuckle along the way. His few miscalculations in life, notably marrying a working female actor (something we are warned not to do) and getting into the drug scene, albeit briefly, when it was in vogue and thus falling prey to the voracious media monster, can easily be forgiven. The man, after all, gave us much more than we could possibly have given back to him, many years of top-flight entertainment. We leave this Kid in his picture saluting him and wishing him well, especially those of us who are ebb-tide filmmakers some miles outside of the inner circle.

756629,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00009PY57,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Based on his book, this film traces the rise and fall of a Hollywood player Robert Evans, who was behind the critically acclaimed films like ""Godfather"" ""Chinatown"" and others.  If you have read the book already, the surprise you get from this unique and not-so-objective documenatary may not be so big.  Still, it is irresistible to know some bits of inside stories of Hollywood, and some footages are really fascinating, as I tell you later.As you know, Robert Evans (most recently co-produced Kate Hudson hit ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"") is a Hollywood mogul who started his career as, most fittingly, an actor who played Irving Thalberg in ""Man of a Thousand Faces.""  But what he really wished for was something better than the unstable status of handsome idol star; he wanted something more powerful, which means the role of producer.Recollecting the days of chasing his career in Tinsel Town, Robert Evans talks about many episodes; about Mia Farrow's behaviors toward her (then) husband Frank Sinatra during the shooting of ""Rosemary's Baby""; his meeting with Ali MacGraw and parting with her; and his devastivating experience about ""The Cotton Club.""  If you like this kind of gossip or inside stories, you might have already heard them.  (For example, William Castle was first supposed to direct ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but Evans wanted Polanski.)  Still, I admit I was drawn into the incredible world as he remembers.The highlight of the film is, to me, the follwing two; one is a short film made especially for pursuading the execs of the Gulf and Western not to dump Paramount Picture.  Here you can see Evans himself ""pitch"" in front of a camera (directed by Mike Nichols!), and tells the merit of keeping the present course, promising a hit movie next Christmas, which, eventually, was to be ""Love Story.""  The other comes during the end credit of the film, in which you can see young Dustin Hoffman (around the time of ""Marathon Man"") impersonate Evans (the footage shot at Evans' home Woodland), which is very, very funny.You may say the narration, all provided by Evans himself, has some tone of self-absorption.  And you are probably right.  But he has lived a life that deserves that glorification (for good or worse), so let's not talk about it.The director team Brett Morgan and Nanette Burnstein skillfully uses the vintage clips of films, photos, and TV footages.  The photos are allowed to move, as if in animation, so the film sometimes looks like photo montage you have seen in surrealism art movement.  Though there are no interviews specially prepared for this occasion, the film is very intersting and rivetting to see, and it's not bad to know some of Jack Nicholson's surprising and tender side (and that crazy photo).",5,Very Fascinating Account of a Hollywood Producer,1066608000,"10 20, 2003",2003,2747,"['Based', 'book', 'film', 'rise', 'fall', 'Hollywood', 'player', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'who', 'was', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'films', 'Godfather', 'Chinatown', 'others', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'already', 'surprise', 'get', 'unique', 'not-so-objective', 'documenatary', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'big', 'Still', 'irresistible', 'know', 'bits', 'inside', 'stories', 'Hollywood', 'footages', 'are', 'really', 'fascinating', 'tell', 'later.As', 'know', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'most', 'recently', 'co-produced', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'hit', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'Hollywood', 'mogul', 'who', 'started', 'career', 'most', 'fittingly', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'Man', 'Thousand', 'Faces', 'what', 'really', 'wished', 'was', 'something', 'better', 'unstable', 'status', 'handsome', 'idol', 'star', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'powerful', 'role', 'producer.Recollecting', 'days', 'chasing', 'career', 'Tinsel', 'Town', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'talks', 'many', 'episodes', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'behaviors', 'then', 'husband', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'shooting', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'meeting', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'parting', 'devastivating', 'experience', 'Cotton', 'Club', 'like', 'kind', 'gossip', 'inside', 'stories', 'might', 'have', 'already', 'heard', 'example', 'William', 'Castle', 'was', 'first', 'supposed', 'direct', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Evans', 'wanted', 'Polanski', 'Still', 'admit', 'was', 'drawn', 'incredible', 'world', 'highlight', 'film', 'follwing', 'two', 'one', 'short', 'film', 'made', 'especially', 'pursuading', 'execs', 'Gulf', 'Western', 'not', 'dump', 'Paramount', 'Picture', 'Here', 'can', 'see', 'Evans', 'pitch', 'front', 'camera', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'merit', 'keeping', 'present', 'course', 'promising', 'hit', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'eventually', 'was', 'be', 'Love', 'Story', 'other', 'end', 'credit', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'young', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'time', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'impersonate', 'Evans', 'footage', 'shot', 'Evans', 'home', 'Woodland', 'very', 'very', 'funny.You', 'may', 'say', 'narration', 'provided', 'Evans', 'tone', 'self-absorption', 'are', 'probably', 'right', 'lived', 'life', 'glorification', 'good', 'worse', 'so', 'let', 'not', 'talk', 'it.The', 'director', 'team', 'Brett', 'Morgan', 'Nanette', 'Burnstein', 'skillfully', 'vintage', 'clips', 'films', 'photos', 'TV', 'footages', 'photos', 'are', 'allowed', 'move', 'animation', 'film', 'sometimes', 'photo', 'montage', 'have', 'seen', 'surrealism', 'art', 'movement', 'are', 'interviews', 'specially', 'prepared', 'occasion', 'film', 'very', 'intersting', 'rivetting', 'see', 'not', 'bad', 'know', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'surprising', 'tender', 'side', 'crazy', 'photo']",N/A
