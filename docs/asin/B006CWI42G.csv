1514661,A2VQX04OZU0TWI,B006CWI42G,R. Vincent,"[0, 0]","Have a Little Faith captures the essence of the book by Mitch Albom. It juxtaposes the lives of two men who superficially have nothing in common: an aged, revered Rabbi Albert Lewis and a former ex-con turned Pentecostal minister, Reverend Henry Covington. Laurence Fishburne, Bradley Whitford, and Martin Landau shine in their roles as the rabbi, the seeker, and the reverend. The film is honest and warm without being wanly sentimental. The cast and the director let the story share its message of love amidst despair and hope in the midst of loss without contrivances or false steps. This film warmed my soul.",5,"A prayer for hope, faith, and kindness",1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,612,"['Have', 'Little', 'Faith', 'essence', 'book', 'Mitch', 'Albom', 'lives', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'superficially', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'aged', 'revered', 'Rabbi', 'Albert', 'Lewis', 'former', 'ex-con', 'turned', 'Pentecostal', 'minister', 'Reverend', 'Henry', 'Covington', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'shine', 'roles', 'rabbi', 'seeker', 'reverend', 'film', 'honest', 'warm', 'being', 'wanly', 'sentimental', 'cast', 'director', 'let', 'story', 'share', 'message', 'love', 'amidst', 'despair', 'hope', 'midst', 'loss', 'contrivances', 'false', 'steps', 'film', 'warmed', 'soul']",Have a Little Faith (Hallmark Hall of Fame) DVD
1514662,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B006CWI42G,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 3]","The movie's title is about faith, but it is more of a story about how we touch each others life and how we are interconnected. Mitch (Bradley Whitford) is a scab sports writer for the Detroit Free Press. While at home in New Jersey,  Mitch is asked by his 82 year old rabbi (Martin Landau) to write his eulogy. This forces Mitch to spend time with the rabbi who touches his life.Mitch is then inspired (or perhaps feels guilty) to do the cliche pretentious thing and sleeps in a crowded homeless shelter to know what it is like to feel poor and homeless. Mitch thinks he can do more than just write about sports. He meets  Henry Covington, a preacher in a poor church trying desperately to save a dying community. Henry (Laurence Fishburne) has a past of crime and drug dealing but following an epiphany has come to God.The film has many inspirational lines and events. In fact it had so many as it became bogged down with goodness. Fishburne gives us a great performance as does Landau. Bradley Whitford as Mitch left me cold. Mitch has zero personality. He was a Jew with no sense of humor. He lacked decent character development although he was in nearly every scene. This is one of the problems with Hallmark productions: When in doubt go lame and drippy.I saw the film more about determination and desire to help others as the ""faith"" aspect was light, almost to the point of being politically correct.",4,WHAT'S YOUR GLORY?,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,1407,"['movie', 'title', 'faith', 'more', 'story', 'how', 'touch', 'others', 'life', 'how', 'are', 'interconnected', 'Mitch', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'scab', 'sports', 'writer', 'Detroit', 'Free', 'Press', 'home', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Mitch', 'asked', '82', 'year', 'old', 'rabbi', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'write', 'eulogy', 'Mitch', 'spend', 'time', 'rabbi', 'who', 'life.Mitch', 'then', 'inspired', 'perhaps', 'feels', 'guilty', 'do', 'cliche', 'pretentious', 'thing', 'sleeps', 'crowded', 'homeless', 'shelter', 'know', 'what', 'feel', 'poor', 'homeless', 'Mitch', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'write', 'about', 'sports', 'Henry', 'Covington', 'preacher', 'poor', 'church', 'trying', 'desperately', 'save', 'dying', 'community', 'Henry', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'past', 'crime', 'drug', 'dealing', 'following', 'epiphany', 'come', 'God.The', 'film', 'many', 'inspirational', 'lines', 'events', 'fact', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'became', 'bogged', 'down', 'goodness', 'Fishburne', 'great', 'performance', 'Landau', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Mitch', 'left', 'cold', 'Mitch', 'zero', 'personality', 'was', 'Jew', 'sense', 'humor', 'lacked', 'decent', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'nearly', 'scene', 'one', 'problems', 'Hallmark', 'productions', 'When', 'doubt', 'go', 'lame', 'drippy.I', 'saw', 'film', 'more', 'determination', 'desire', 'help', 'others', 'faith', 'aspect', 'was', 'light', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'politically', 'correct']",Have a Little Faith (Hallmark Hall of Fame) DVD
