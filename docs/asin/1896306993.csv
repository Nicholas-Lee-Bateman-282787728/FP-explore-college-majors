I did not get in on the names of who was in it, and I wondered who that great looking, gorgeous man was who played Lucias.  Well,  many years later I'm watching another movie with this great looking,  gorgeous man in it and find out his name is Hugh Grant.  The man is a great  actor.The story is a romance set back in the days of King Charles II of  England.  Hugh Grant was, of course, the hero of the story.  The heroine of  the story, I cannot remember her real name, played Panthea Vine, the damsel  in distress, who is saved by the highwayman (Hugh Grant).  He takes her  back to her home after killing the man who forced her to marry him.  He  knew the way to her home without her telling him.  She later realizes this  must be her cousin Lucias who is suspected of being the legendary  &quot;Silver Blade&quot;.This movie has its group of meanies, too.  Emma  Samms is a spoiled, egotistical, but beautiful woman who wants Lucias.  He  turns her down right away, which really ticks her off.  Another meanie is  Oliver Reed who plays Cromwell, a well known buzzard back in that time in  history.My brother thought he wasn't going to like this movie, but when  he got into it he couldn't leave it.  He jumped right up out of his seat  when he thought the jailers were going to chop of Panthea's head with an  ax.This is a great movie and everyone who loves romance should get it.

When the king's jealous mistress Barbara Castlemaine (Emma Samms) discovers the romance, she decides to send them both to the gallows.

195604,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,1896306993,CodeMaster Talon,"[28, 29]","This wonderful '80's cheesfest features Emma Samms, Lysette Anthony, and Hugh Grant, speaking in a very weird, strangled manner that is apparently meant to be sexy.Based on a novel by the immortal Barbara Cartland, the story follows the insipid adventures of the equally insipid Panthea Vine, orphaned heiress and milk sop extraordinaire. We watch as she endures a VERY quick marriage to an evil tax collector (about half hour before he is fortuitously disposed of), meets the hunky, Robin Hood-esque Silver Blade (""Thank you, thank you, Silver Blade!""), prances around the court of King Charles II, makes a powerful enemy (Samms, paying the rent), solves a family mystery and finally winds up fending for her life while being tried for treason.It's all very silly, and highly entertaining if you're in the proper frame of mind. Other reviewers mention the hammy acting and ridiculous dialogue, but for me that's part of the fun. Rent it if you like costume romances, enjoy laughing at bad movies, or want to feel superior to the bunch of hapless Hollywood stars forced to say things like ""My lord Chancellor is like all you men, simply a big belly surrounded by self-esteem!""If you do see it, watch for the moment when Silver Blade challenges Panthea's husband to a duel.

I can jusify this, because I have made it a practice to watch every film about the three musketeers ever made (including the awful Disney thing with Tim Curry). I guess I should have been warned by Barbara Cartland's name on the cover.Why it is Dumb: It's the Reformation. The Royalists have won. Hugh Grant's character runs around as a highwayman trying to root out Parliamentarian plots that might unseat King Charles II. HOW?! He's a highwayman. He robs stagecoaches. He's not going to have any idea of what plots are going on. Surely, get a job at court and maybe engage in some espionage?Anyway, its pretty clear here that Royalist equals GOOD and Parliamentarian equals EVIL. I don't want to pick sides, but I do know that Charles I did bring the whole civil war on himself by being  difficult, and that Charles mark 2 wasn't the perfect monarch either. Not saying they were EVIL mind, just not really GOOD.

Actually, she should have put that in.OK, so this is supposed to be a romance of the 'sweet' variety, not a genuine look at the reign of Chuck 2. The romance sucks as well.

I love her books; I'm awed at the way she was able to weave a tale out of the smallest, and at times little known, historical facts.  So to those who don't care for romance fiction, pass this DVD up.  Fellow fans, make a place for this on your shelf(and ignore the awful, and anachronistic, packaging)...Based on BC's novel ""Cupid Rides Pillion(aka ""The Secret Heart"")"", ""The Lady and the Highwayman"" is set in Restoration England, just prior and during the reign of Charles II(Michael York).  One of his supporters is the dashing Lucius(Hugh Grant), aka the notorious, heroic highwayman, 'Silver Blade.'  Our heroine is lovely Lady Panthea Vyne(Lysette Anthony), whom a masked Lucius rescues after she is forced to wed(Ian Bannen in a marvelously hissable performance).When Charles returns to power Lucius continues his undercover support of the king, and Panthea has become a member of the royal court.  Unfortunately, she offends Lady Barbara Castlemaine(Emma Samms), the king's mistress, who, fearing possible competition, schemes to exile or eliminate Panthea.  Further complicating matters, an oily cousin of Panthea's(Christopher Cazenove)seeks Panthea's family estate, and the title and wealth that goes with it...and Panthea's hand in marriage.This is one of the Lord Lew Grade/Gainsborough Pictures collection of several Barbara Cartland tales, and done with(I think)more respect to BC and her fans than the first non LLG production, ""The Flame Is Love.""  Costumes and sets are sumptuous, and the acting is fine throughout, with no winks to the audience.I own this on VHS and DVD, and I think the color transfer on the DVD is superior to VHS, which looks a little smeary.Definitely add this to your collection!",5,"Bravo, Barbara!",1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,1755,"['am', 'HUGE', 'Barbara', 'Cartland', 'fan', 'love', 'books', ""'m"", 'awed', 'way', 'was', 'able', 'weave', 'tale', 'smallest', 'times', 'little', 'known', 'historical', 'facts', 'So', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'romance', 'fiction', 'pass', 'DVD', 'up', 'Fellow', 'fans', 'make', 'place', 'shelf', 'ignore', 'awful', 'anachronistic', 'packaging', 'Based', 'BC', 'novel', 'Cupid', 'Rides', 'Pillion', 'Secret', 'Heart', 'Lady', 'Highwayman', 'set', 'Restoration', 'England', 'just', 'prior', 'reign', 'Charles', 'II', 'Michael', 'York', 'One', 'supporters', 'dashing', 'Lucius', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'notorious', 'heroic', 'highwayman', 'Blade', 'heroine', 'lovely', 'Lady', 'Panthea', 'Vyne', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'whom', 'masked', 'Lucius', 'rescues', 'forced', 'wed', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'marvelously', 'hissable', 'performance', '.When', 'Charles', 'power', 'Lucius', 'undercover', 'support', 'king', 'Panthea', 'become', 'member', 'royal', 'court', 'Unfortunately', 'Lady', 'Barbara', 'Castlemaine', 'Emma', 'Samms', 'king', 'mistress', 'who', 'fearing', 'possible', 'competition', 'exile', 'eliminate', 'Panthea', 'Further', 'complicating', 'matters', 'oily', 'cousin', 'Panthea', 'Christopher', 'Cazenove', 'Panthea', 'family', 'estate', 'title', 'wealth', 'Panthea', 'hand', 'marriage.This', 'one', 'Lord', 'Lew', 'Grade/Gainsborough', 'Pictures', 'collection', 'several', 'Barbara', 'Cartland', 'tales', 'done', 'think', 'more', 'respect', 'BC', 'fans', 'first', 'non', 'LLG', 'production', 'Flame', 'Is', 'Love', 'Costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'sumptuous', 'acting', 'fine', 'winks', 'audience.I', 'own', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'think', 'color', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'superior', 'VHS', 'little', 'smeary.Definitely', 'add', 'collection']",The Lady and the Highwayman

195630,A2L7WYA5OENV03,1896306993,Reticuli,"[0, 0]","This clearly went over the heads of the British and Australian critics at the time, as their reviews either show them not taking TV movies seriously or being just plain stupid.  Comparing Grant's hair to Duran Duran?  You know they didn't have hair gel or electric clippers back then, right?  Or not knowing what a Lady of the Queen's Bedchamber was?  Seriously?  A noblewoman getting that is on her way up.  It's a contrast between one woman who catches a break after being nice & genuine, versus a wench who schemes through marriage, seduction, and false accusations.I liked how the charges are just a slight twist on the real story that gets people screaming ""conspiracy to murder!""  And it's not a remake of `Robin Hood' when in the film they use the term in its general reference, as was the style of the day: `A Robin Hood'.  The standout here is the dialog and fairly amazing performances from some of the smaller parts.  Even the players in the bit parts are trying to make it real.  I will admit it could have used some instances of the lead actually helping to dress the Queen, or something related to her new status... other than attending parties.It's hard to tell for certain, but the costumes, production design, and lighting is probably very well done.  Same thing for the Michelle Pfeiffer flick also on the disk this came on: Power, Passion, and Murder (actually Great Performances, Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson).  That one looked almost like its style was inspired by David Lynch... similar casting, too.  Both transfers are absolutely abysmal, though.  They appear a transfer, from a transfer, from a broadcast beta tape in its last legs.  Horrible.  In fact, Power Passion Murder also had a weird video camera-like motion quality to it that was either from actually filming it on video (hard to believe considering there's a film within the film shot on film in that one) or the result of rather good PAL to NTSC conversion (it doesn't look like bad old BBC conversions).  PPM was so awful looking I couldn't even watch it, so I skipped to The Lady and the Highwayman/SilverBlade.Both these, apparently made-for-TV period/costume movies deserve to have their rights owners acquire the original conformed negative (or master interpositive, if there were opticals done, as probably in PPM) and the original stereo downmix master tapes (I doubt the multitracks still exist for a surround transfer) and get these telecined to Bluray.  Now it's just muddy picture and droning muddy sound.  Saying they're ""dated"" is unfair, as I suspect a lot more sweat & heart was put into them than people assume.  If anything's dated, it's someone referencing Duran Duran's hairstyles to criticize a period film.",3,Too Smart For the 80s?,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",2010,2732,"['clearly', 'went', 'heads', 'British', 'Australian', 'critics', 'time', 'reviews', 'show', 'not', 'taking', 'TV', 'movies', 'seriously', 'being', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Comparing', 'Grant', 'hair', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'hair', 'gel', 'electric', 'clippers', 'back', 'then', 'right', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'Lady', 'Queen', 'Bedchamber', 'was', 'Seriously', 'noblewoman', 'getting', 'way', 'up', 'contrast', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'break', 'being', 'nice', 'genuine', 'versus', 'wench', 'who', 'marriage', 'seduction', 'false', 'accusations.I', 'liked', 'how', 'charges', 'are', 'just', 'slight', 'twist', 'real', 'story', 'people', 'screaming', 'conspiracy', 'murder', 'not', 'remake', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'when', 'film', 'use', 'term', 'general', 'reference', 'was', 'style', 'day', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'standout', 'here', 'dialog', 'fairly', 'amazing', 'performances', 'smaller', 'parts', 'Even', 'players', 'bit', 'parts', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'real', 'will', 'admit', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'instances', 'lead', 'actually', 'helping', 'dress', 'Queen', 'something', 'related', 'new', 'status', 'other', 'attending', 'parties.It', 'hard', 'tell', 'certain', 'costumes', 'production', 'design', 'lighting', 'probably', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Same', 'thing', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'flick', 'also', 'disk', 'came', 'Power', 'Passion', 'Murder', 'actually', 'Great', 'Performances', 'Tales', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'Natica', 'Jackson', 'one', 'looked', 'almost', 'style', 'was', 'inspired', 'David', 'Lynch', 'similar', 'casting', 'too', 'transfers', 'are', 'absolutely', 'abysmal', 'though', 'appear', 'transfer', 'transfer', 'broadcast', 'beta', 'tape', 'last', 'legs', 'Horrible', 'fact', 'Power', 'Passion', 'Murder', 'also', 'had', 'weird', 'video', 'camera-like', 'motion', 'quality', 'was', 'either', 'actually', 'filming', 'video', 'hard', 'believe', 'considering', 'film', 'film', 'shot', 'film', 'one', 'result', 'rather', 'good', 'PAL', 'NTSC', 'conversion', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'old', 'BBC', 'conversions', 'PPM', 'was', 'so', 'awful', 'looking', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'so', 'skipped', 'Lady', 'Highwayman/SilverBlade.Both', 'apparently', 'made-for-TV', 'period/costume', 'movies', 'deserve', 'have', 'rights', 'owners', 'acquire', 'original', 'conformed', 'negative', 'master', 'interpositive', 'were', 'opticals', 'done', 'probably', 'PPM', 'original', 'stereo', 'downmix', 'master', 'tapes', 'doubt', 'multitracks', 'still', 'exist', 'surround', 'transfer', 'get', 'telecined', 'Bluray', 'Now', 'just', 'muddy', 'picture', 'droning', 'muddy', 'sound', 'Saying', ""'re"", 'dated', 'unfair', 'suspect', 'lot', 'more', 'sweat', 'heart', 'was', 'put', 'people', 'assume', 'anything', 'dated', 'someone', 'referencing', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'hairstyles', 'criticize', 'period', 'film']",The Lady and the Highwayman
