To help her run the ranch, she hires Fred Carter (Stephen Boyd), a handy man. A handsome, but taciturn fellow who has known much tragedy, Fred works hard for her. Robbie Sharron (Dennis Holmes), the woman's son, resents him, and when he learns that his mother is planning to marry him to quell ugly rumors in town, the youth is most unhappy. After the wedding, the stepfather treats the boy harshly, not out of cruelty, but because he wants to prepare the boy to survive the tough life ahead"".Nice Drama, filmed in Cinemascope and looks very good on this DVD-R product, which contains in stereo a isolated track of the score by Hugo Friedhofer.Picture Quality is very good. Doesn't have any damages. Soundtrack is in stereo.Doesn't contains any subtitles.Like very much Stephen Boyd since his most famouse role as Messala in ""Ben Hur"".",4,Great Drama,1318896000,"10 18, 2011",2011,910,"['Story', 'Mary', 'Sharron', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'lost', 'husband', 'forest', 'fire', 'help', 'run', 'ranch', 'Fred', 'Carter', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'handy', 'man', 'handsome', 'taciturn', 'fellow', 'who', 'known', 'much', 'tragedy', 'Fred', 'hard', 'Robbie', 'Sharron', 'Dennis', 'Holmes', 'woman', 'son', 'when', 'mother', 'planning', 'marry', 'quell', 'ugly', 'rumors', 'town', 'youth', 'most', 'unhappy', 'wedding', 'stepfather', 'boy', 'harshly', 'not', 'cruelty', 'prepare', 'boy', 'survive', 'tough', 'life', 'ahead', '.Nice', 'Drama', 'filmed', 'Cinemascope', 'very', 'good', 'DVD-R', 'product', 'stereo', 'isolated', 'track', 'score', 'Hugo', 'Friedhofer.Picture', 'Quality', 'very', 'good', 'Does', ""n't"", 'have', 'damages', 'Soundtrack', 'stereo.Does', ""n't"", 'subtitles.Like', 'very', 'much', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'most', 'famouse', 'role', 'Messala', 'Ben', 'Hur']",Woman Obsessed
1444425,A1AIFP9PXJ5MJ2,B0056ZKX24,John A. Malagrin,"[1, 1]","The move has two great, long gone, actors; i.e., Steven Boyd and Susan Hayward. Hayward plays a woman on the frontier land where her husband is killed fighting a forest fire as a ranger. she has a small son and the farm that she then tries to save, but becomes too much for her when all of a sudden, in answer to her flyers, Boyd shows up to lend a helping hand. Her son, Robby likes Boyd at first, but later, as Boyd and Hayward become romantically involved and then married, Robby turns against Boyd.  Animosity grows between Hayward and Boyd as tension grows between the boy and her husband. She turns Boyd away from her bedroom and wants to separate from him, but he forcibly take her, sexually, and she becomes pregnant.Early, in the movie, Boyd had saved both Hayward and Robbie from freezing to death in a blizzard, but that doesn't help now. Hayward starts to miscarriage the baby and collapses, and Boyd drives the wagon thru heavy torrential rains to get to the doctor far away, and carries her in his arms over the last 5 miles to get there. Robbie hides in the woods, and when he returns to the farm house and cannot find his mother, he thinks Boyd had killed his mother.The Doctor saves Hayward's life but informs her that much of the fault of the difference between her son and Boyd is the fault of her son and her. Boyd, meantime goes back to the woods to find the son because Hayward is worried about him.What happens in the conclusion I leave to the buyer of this DVD as it is tense and exciting and the ending is powerful. The movie has a blizzard, a forest fire, great open country scenery, great acting, and the involvement of a quicksand that is instrumental to the story.",5,Romantic Drama,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,1693,"['move', 'two', 'great', 'long', 'gone', 'actors', 'i.e.', 'Steven', 'Boyd', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Hayward', 'woman', 'frontier', 'land', 'where', 'husband', 'killed', 'fighting', 'forest', 'fire', 'ranger', 'small', 'son', 'farm', 'then', 'save', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'sudden', 'answer', 'flyers', 'Boyd', 'up', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'son', 'Robby', 'Boyd', 'first', 'later', 'Boyd', 'Hayward', 'become', 'romantically', 'involved', 'then', 'married', 'Robby', 'Boyd', 'Animosity', 'Hayward', 'Boyd', 'tension', 'grows', 'boy', 'husband', 'Boyd', 'away', 'bedroom', 'separate', 'forcibly', 'take', 'sexually', 'pregnant.Early', 'movie', 'Boyd', 'had', 'saved', 'Hayward', 'Robbie', 'freezing', 'death', 'blizzard', ""n't"", 'help', 'now', 'Hayward', 'miscarriage', 'baby', 'collapses', 'Boyd', 'wagon', 'thru', 'heavy', 'torrential', 'rains', 'get', 'doctor', 'far', 'away', 'arms', 'last', '5', 'miles', 'get', 'there', 'Robbie', 'woods', 'when', 'farm', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'mother', 'Boyd', 'had', 'killed', 'mother.The', 'Doctor', 'Hayward', 'life', 'much', 'fault', 'difference', 'son', 'Boyd', 'fault', 'son', 'Boyd', 'meantime', 'back', 'woods', 'find', 'son', 'Hayward', 'worried', 'him.What', 'conclusion', 'leave', 'buyer', 'DVD', 'tense', 'exciting', 'ending', 'powerful', 'movie', 'blizzard', 'forest', 'fire', 'great', 'open', 'country', 'scenery', 'great', 'acting', 'involvement', 'quicksand', 'instrumental', 'story']",Woman Obsessed
1444426,A1N4OFD1OGTVFI,B0056ZKX24,Mr. Dudley J. Tate,"[1, 1]","""Woman Obsessed"", based on the novel ""The Snow Birch"" by John Mantley,was made into a movie in 1959 and the main stars were:Susan Hayward as Mary SharronStephen Boyd as Fred CarterBarbara Nichols as Mayme RadzevitchDennis Holmes as Robbie SharronTheodore Bikel as Dr R.W. GibbsI am at a loss as to why the movie was titled ""Woman Obsessed"".  MarySharron was certainly not obsessed.  She was just doing what all goodmothers would do - protecting her young son Robbie from the verbalabuse of an over-zealous step-father.  If anyone was obsessed, it was herson Robbie who as time went on and for good reasons, disliked his newstep-father more and more and eventually does his best to get rid of him.The recent marriage between Mary and Fred starts off well but thingsbegin to deteriorate rapidly when Fred declares Robbie to be a cowardbecause the boy fainted at the sight of blood whilst being forced byFred to watch the skinning of a deer that Fred had just shot.  Fredhates cowards due to an unfortunate incident in his family years earlierwhen his brother failed to act and save the life of Fred's wife becausehe was afraid.  Since then, Fred has hated all cowards and declaresthat he himself is not a coward and that he is afraid of nothing.That of course is about to change through the efforts of young Robbie.Fred's unforgiving ways disrupts the family unity and creates tensions withhis wife and Robbie.  His wife disapproves of her husband's abnormalactions and sides with her son.In retaliation, Robbie deliberately lures his step-father into a mud pit fromwhich he is unable to escape.  Continually sinking down into the mud tohis demise, he pleads with the boy for help, proving that he himself is infact a coward and afraid to die.All ends well with Fred finally coming to his senses and realizing that noteveryone including himself is perfect and that he should display moretolerance with his step-son.This movie has all that is necessary to make it an intelligent and convincingreal life drama.  There is a strong cast who perform well with Susan Haywardand Stephen Boyd at their usual best and young Dennis Holmes is outstandingas Robbie.  He is truly believable.""Woman Obsessed"" was filmed entirely in the great outdoors with manyspectacular scenes and is in its original theatre presentation of cinemascope,color and stereo sound.  Who could ask for more?This DVD is a limited edition of 3,000 units, so if you want one then grab it nowbefore they are gone.Highly recommended.",5,Woman Obsessed,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,2491,"['Woman', 'Obsessed', 'based', 'novel', 'Snow', 'Birch', 'John', 'Mantley', 'was', 'made', 'movie', '1959', 'main', 'stars', 'were', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Mary', 'SharronStephen', 'Boyd', 'Fred', 'CarterBarbara', 'Nichols', 'Mayme', 'RadzevitchDennis', 'Holmes', 'Robbie', 'SharronTheodore', 'Bikel', 'Dr', 'R.W', 'GibbsI', 'am', 'loss', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'titled', 'Woman', 'Obsessed', 'MarySharron', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'obsessed', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'goodmothers', 'would', 'do', 'protecting', 'young', 'son', 'Robbie', 'verbalabuse', 'over-zealous', 'step-father', 'anyone', 'was', 'obsessed', 'was', 'herson', 'Robbie', 'who', 'time', 'went', 'good', 'reasons', 'disliked', 'newstep-father', 'more', 'more', 'eventually', 'best', 'get', 'rid', 'him.The', 'recent', 'marriage', 'Mary', 'Fred', 'off', 'well', 'thingsbegin', 'deteriorate', 'rapidly', 'when', 'Fred', 'Robbie', 'be', 'cowardbecause', 'boy', 'fainted', 'sight', 'blood', 'whilst', 'being', 'forced', 'byFred', 'watch', 'skinning', 'deer', 'Fred', 'had', 'just', 'shot', 'Fredhates', 'cowards', 'due', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'family', 'years', 'brother', 'failed', 'act', 'save', 'life', 'Fred', 'wife', 'becausehe', 'was', 'afraid', 'then', 'Fred', 'hated', 'cowards', 'not', 'coward', 'afraid', 'course', 'change', 'efforts', 'young', 'Robbie.Fred', 'unforgiving', 'ways', 'disrupts', 'family', 'unity', 'tensions', 'withhis', 'wife', 'Robbie', 'wife', 'disapproves', 'husband', 'abnormalactions', 'sides', 'son.In', 'retaliation', 'Robbie', 'deliberately', 'step-father', 'mud', 'pit', 'fromwhich', 'unable', 'escape', 'Continually', 'sinking', 'down', 'mud', 'tohis', 'demise', 'boy', 'help', 'proving', 'infact', 'coward', 'afraid', 'die.All', 'ends', 'well', 'Fred', 'finally', 'coming', 'senses', 'realizing', 'noteveryone', 'including', 'perfect', 'should', 'display', 'moretolerance', 'step-son.This', 'movie', 'necessary', 'make', 'intelligent', 'convincingreal', 'life', 'drama', 'strong', 'cast', 'who', 'perform', 'well', 'Susan', 'Haywardand', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'usual', 'best', 'young', 'Dennis', 'Holmes', 'outstandingas', 'Robbie', 'truly', 'believable', 'Woman', 'Obsessed', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'great', 'outdoors', 'manyspectacular', 'scenes', 'original', 'theatre', 'presentation', 'cinemascope', 'color', 'stereo', 'sound', 'Who', 'could', 'ask', 'more', 'DVD', 'limited', 'edition', '3,000', 'units', 'so', 'want', 'one', 'then', 'grab', 'are', 'gone.Highly', 'recommended']",Woman Obsessed
