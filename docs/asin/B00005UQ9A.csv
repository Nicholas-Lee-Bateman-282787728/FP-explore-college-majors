It was filmed in Boston, and as a life time Massachusetts resident, I loved seeing our fair city in yet, another of the handful of films actually filmed here.It is a city that looks beautiful on film.Lawrence is playing his usual role of the petty thief who dances and talks way through the film.  ....I do usually like Danny Devito, but I don't know what he was thinking here.  His character, Max, has a few funny moments, ....Lawrence robs Devito, and Devito is in the house when it happens.  He steals the ring Lawrence is wearing.

Martin Lawrence, who is normally a funny guy, just isn't on his game in this flick.  Danny DeVito is better, but the material doesn't give him much with which to work.There is a lot of talent wasted on stereotype bits that are more insulting than comical.  William Fichtner's flamingly effeminate detective would only be funny to homophobes.  John Leguizamo's Arab imitation is less humorous now than it might have been before September 11.The only really funny bit in the film is a strictly visual gag by Stephanie Clayman as the sign language interpreter.  Without virtue of a solitary line of dialogue, she single handedly produces all the most hilarious moments in the film.This film is a dud.  I rated it 3/10.

Martin as well as Danny Devito(who should have known better than to go along with this tedious movie) are not funny.
