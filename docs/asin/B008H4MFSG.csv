I like a wide variety of comedians, from the raunchy to the relatively ""clean-cut"".  Jim Gaffigan has always fit well into the latter category, never really using too much profanity and never being heavily controversial.  As a result, most of his jokes are ""cute"" - they're funny, but never really make you fall off your chair laughing.  After sharing his DVD's with friends, I've often gotten replies such as, ""That guy sucks"" or ""Incredibly boring...""  I can understand that he's not everyone's cup of tea.Mr. Universe however is probably one of the funniest Gaffigan specials I've ever seen.  His delivery is no different than usual - he starts off with the feminate ""whisper"" voice that has become a staple in his specials.  Most of it is still observational humor, but this time he seems to prod just a smidge deeper into the ""typical human psyche.""  I was laughing hysterically at some of his jokes, and even my wife agreed that this show was much funnier than his usual.If you're a Gaffigan fan already, you'll love this special.  A few of his jokes are reused from older material, but not much, and he continues to build on those original ideas with new material.I would also recommend this to the fans of ""blue collar"" comedy - most of this material is clean and can be shared with older children and in-laws without having to feel nervous.Very well done, Jim.

His favorite topics are perfectly quotidian: fast food, which he craves; exercise, which he avoids; hotels, where he spends a lot of time; and kids, of whom he has four. Watch the brief video clips featured on this page to get a sense of Gaffigan's entertaining routines.Using a rubbery face, a collection of odd voices, and the persona of a laconic, overweight schlub, he exaggerates everyday situations, stretching and distorting them until they snap and his audience bursts into laughter. I don't know how he keeps from being sued by the many corporations he mocks, like Disney and McDondald's and Domino's and Subway, but he somehow gets away with it. And fortunately sperm whales cannot file suit against a human being.A remarkable thing about Gaffigan is that he can be delightfully droll without working blue. There's nothing offensive about his routines, and very few swear words, so you can watch his special with your family. While not always memorable, his insights are consistently amusing.
