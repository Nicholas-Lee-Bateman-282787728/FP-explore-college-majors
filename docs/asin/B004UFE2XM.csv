When I found out that there was a Japanese series, I was like ""WOW!"". So I went ahead & bought Transformers: Headmasters. First of all, the artwork is impressive. The disc arragement is okay.My only problem is that you have to rely on the subtitles to know what is being said since the spoken language is all in Japanese. It would have been nice to have an English language selection. Hearing Optimus Prime speaking Japanese, just doesn't sound the same.Still this isn't a bad addition for the avid Transformers collector.

1428037,A2STSWXXID216E,B004UFE2XM,"BOOTA-san ""BOOTA-san""","[21, 23]","I have to rate this release as a 5-Star for several reasons:1. The great price and for the fact that it's not a bootleg.2. If this is the 'weakest' series of the Japanese ""trilogy"", then I hope Shout Factory releases the other two sets (Headmasters; Super God Masterforce; Victory), the storytelling and action is excellent.3. Even for an 80's 'toon, and not remastered from its original film, it has held up brilliantly; much moreso than the U.S. counterparts in my opinion.4. It doesn't belittle: adult wars - check; actual robot destruction/dismemberment and 'game over' - check; extremely mild language (I wouldn't even consider it profanity) - check.It's basically what you wanted to see as a kid.  I was hesitant to watch the release at first.  It sat on my player for over a month.  Not because it's a Japanese release and has no English Dubs -- I watch all of my anime with Subs, but because it's from the 80's.  Don't get me wrong; I'm crazy about TF G1, mainly the 1st and 2nd seasons.  After re-watching the 3rd and 4th seasons; good grief those did not age well -- the U.S. storytelling for the later seasons is mediocre; some plots and animation made my eyes roll.  It was actually painful to watch; especially the distant planets and the attention focused moreso on the annoying characters (aliens and humans) rather than the robots.The later U.S. releases remind me of the new live-action films.  Love everything about the robots; highly dislike the annoying human characters (although the 1st movie still remains the most watchable).  However, I don't mind a re-telling.  I don't mind liberties.  I enjoy a little shake-up.The detail and animation of the Japanese ""Rebirth"" story, to me, is hands above the 4th season of the U.S.  Whereas, in the U.S. cartoon... you might count 10-15 different 'bots; I basically lost count at 40 in the first episode of ""Headmasters"".  I understand cartoons are the main push to sell the latest series of the toyline; but it's nice to see so many older 'bots in the Japanese cartoon.  Also, the tape cassette wars and the amount of combiner 'bots in just the first 5 episodes is outstanding; I was shocked; it made me drivel.  I could not stop watching the series, and the episodes fly by.The cartoon action usually takes place in several locations and on several planets; there is a great voice-over/subtitles narrater to keep you up to track on the story and the whereabouts of the 'bots -- much more in depth than the U.S. cartoons (which did not take advantage of such tools and storytelling; and watered down adult themes); you'll know what I mean once viewing a few shows.  It is action paced and I'll state it again, the animation and battles are noncomparable.  I instantly wanted to watch the release again, which means an instant 'keeper' and 'winner' in my book.  And I'm very picky.  I wasn't born in the 80's, so I'm not a fan of CG 'toons such as Beast Wars/Machines, Energon, etc.  So I heavily rely on these cel-shaded 'toon releases.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

When I was a kid, I would get a few bootleg episodes on VHS with VERY VERY poor dubbing.  It was so goofy sounding that it made the show stupid.  But as a kid, I didn't care, I just wanted to see Scorponok and Sixshot and etc in cartoon form.  Now everyone who hasn't seen the series yet will get the same opportunity.  Whats even better is that these are the original Japanese voices with English subtitles.I do enjoy the DVD and think they did a good job.  However, the subtitling is hard to read at times because it is in a white font, and I think yellow would have probably worked better.The series continues after season 3 of the US series, and skips Rebirth.  It's not the best TF series made, but it's good.  Most would agree that Masterforce is the best.  There will be a box set released soon with Masterforce, and Victory along with Headmasters.The quality of the DVD is fantastic and looks as good as it did when it was broadcasted.  If you are a fan, or just curious about the foreign TF universe, you owe yourself a favor and must pick this up.I give the series 4 stars out of 5, but Shout!

1428040,A2QGFZCM6RIX7P,B004UFE2XM,"Felix A. Mackay ""Felix""","[2, 5]","Years ago, when I was growing up watching the original G1 series on TV, I heard rumors from my friends at school that apparently Transformers continued after ""The Rebirth"" but that it only aired in Japan. I later learned that this was because Transformers was actually an American cartoon that Sunbow did by contracting Japanese animation firms (I believe TOEI was the main one). --(people feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)--. Some episodes were animated by Hanna Barbera also. I believe the american series was also aired in Japan with Japanese voice actors, but after sales of the toys declined in America, they sold the franchise to Takara (?). And then the Japanese took full control of the series from that point on.So anyway, I HAD seen the first episode of the Japanese series a few years ago (badly translated as ""The Four Soldiers From The Sky""... It was one of those that were dubbed with English (UK) voice actors and it was TERRIBLE !! ... So bad was it that although the quality of the animation was great, I just could not watch more than one episode.But here I am, having given the show a second chance as this time it's proberly released by SHOUT! Factory (who can be credited for doing an amazing job so far). This time it's presented with the original Japanese audio and a NEW (and proper) translation into english with subtitles. And boy is it surprisingly different...Now the story is somewhat clearer and a lot of things make more sense to me since I finally understand that when the Japanese did their Headmaster series, they scrapped the American season 4 all together (The Rebirth) and started THEIR story right after the end of season 3 (The Return of Optimus Prime). -- In other words, if you really want to understand what's going on, as a North American fan, you have to pretend The Rebirth never existed (which is all good by me).I give this product 4 stars not for the product itself (which I would give 5 stars to), but actually because of the lack of vision of executives back in the days who could have (and should have) simply imported the show from Japan and asked Peter Cullen, Frank Welker and company to re-dub the show in ""American""... When you think about it, it would have cost them much less money then producing the show themselves, and it would have boosted their toy sales... (They did it years later for shows like Pokemon)...All this to say, if you're a fan of G1 Transformers, I REALLY recommend this purchase !

A big game hunter that hunts machines? And season 3, went between silly and serious at extremes. Coupled with bad production, seems to everyone's least favorite season. Unless you count season 4(all 3 episodes of it)which American decided to kill the series with the worst story possible. Transformers that left Cybertron during the wars and set up on a new planet and advance their technology. The Headmasters were born. It's that simple, and it's way better than sticking living people inside the Transformers heads. That is done much better in Masterforce (which hopefully sees release from Shout also). Also they do not try to copy american g1 writing. They aren't trying to steal an idiotic invention every other episode, or find some pwoerful artifact just to be abandoned at the end of every episode. The whole season is one long story, like a serial comic pretty much. Where each episode is a chapter, you can't just jump into the middle of the season and start watching. It's gotta start from the start.Galvatron, fed up with constant failure recruits a couple Headmasters from the Master planet. Fortress Maximus and 4 other Headmasters track them down to stop them and end up joining the Autobots. The tone of the show is a little funny at first but slowly gets more serious and the disasters are of epic proportions. Also Optimus Prime dies along with many other Autobots. Even planets are not spared. We get to watch the death of Galvatron, and Scorponok, the Largest Decepticon headmaster, assume the role of leader. The show gets pretty brutal at times and is probably not for kids.The animation is way better than American, though the voice acting could use a complete redux. If you can tolerate the voice acting, then you are in the clear to enjoy the series. The score is nothing like what you've heard in the American series. It sounds like MSX Computer Konami music. It actually makes me feel like it is 1987 when I watch it, which is one of the coolest parts of the series for me.

Factory is giving the US Transformers fans what the others have never come through on. Glad to see this series is finally getting its long over do region 1 release. I have seen some of the episodes on Youtube and it seems to be a very cool continuation of where the series in the US ended (for whatever reason, rather it was just the declining poularity at the time or the rumors that these episodes were shipped from Japan to be aired in the US but would end up being destroyed in some type of fire. Either way it was ended with the Rebirth (Season 4) series).Without spoiling too much I thought the concept was just as cool as having the Humannoids as the head and as guns in Rebirth. The only difference is that the these robots are ones who left Cybertron during the Great War to live in peace. While on the planet they picked for their home they designed bigger robot bodies and then they became the heads of those bigger bodies. You will see a lot of new characters as well as some of the older characters from the first three seasons of The Transformers. Like Transformers: The Movie, this series is another transition from earlier characters to the focussing on the newest characters which were the newest toyline at the time.All in all I have liked what I have seen of the series so far on sites like Youtube and can't wait to get this and see the entire series. With this release and the re-release of Beast Wars I hope Shout! Factory sticks with it and we get a region 1 release of the remaining Japanese series (Masterforce and Vitory for G1, Beast Wars Second and Beast Wars Neo for Beast Wars) as well as the one shot episode for Transfomers: Zone.I recieved the DVD this week. Shipping was prompt, the only knock I give it is that it was not packaged too great. It was loosely put in an oversized envelope and look like it had been moving around in shipment. It seems Amazon is a little hit or miss anymore with their packing of the items for shipment. Other than that the set was fine, none of the plastic inside or out was broken, no loose DVDs inside and no scratches or anything on the DVDs.As for the episodes, this is a lot better than finding and watching these on Youtube.

At the end of the 3rd season the public was left with a sappy mix of a series ending. The three episode ending through in lots of new characters (i.e. toys) and a barely there plot. This series is the continuation prior to this terrible ending.This series picks up after Optimus Prime has come back and saved the world from the ""hate virus"" of previous episodes. Its set in the far distant future of 2011! The Decepticons are back and ready to kick some Autobot butt! This series focuses on the Headmasters as well as the other special combiner teams. For the first time the public gets to see all the combiner teams mixing it up in battle.The opening and closing credit songs leave a lot to be desired but are basically standard Japanese anime songs. The animation is the same as the original series so that is great for fans. The story writing is bit more adult than the previous series but nothing that would turn off kids. The series is in Japanese but is subtitled.

1428048,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B004UFE2XM,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","First off, let me say that any Transfan is still going want to at least check this out.  How much they'll enjoy depends on them, but I'm sure they'll find some good episodes here.  If you haven't seen this, stop reading this since there will be spoilers.  Anyways, Japan decided to start producing their own Transformers shows & made a trilogy, & while the later shows are precisely one third of my top 6 Transformers series, this first one falls to 7th at best.  It's not bad for a first effort, but it isn't as good as the seasons before or after it.  This did give some improvements on the old series like Transformers can be killed on TV (This isn't always a good thing though.  Optimus Prime died again, & Ultra Magnus' death wouldn't get him into silicon Valhalla.), and the cassette animal Transformers can talk now, which is what they should have done in the American series.  The first 5 episodes are good, but after that the series gets a little spotty.  The 2 part stories suck (Cybertron & Mars get destroyed) except for the one that introduced the Targetmasters.  There are about 20 or so decent episodes, with some really good ones that force me to keep the set.  My favorites were Battle to the Death on the Planet Beehive, The Head Formation of Friendship (these 2 were like those awesome season 2/3 episodes where they go to another planet & meet an alien culture), & my favorite of all The Emperor of Destruction Vanishes under an Iceberg (Galvatron dies!  Woohoo!).  There are probably others but I can't think of any right now.  The main problem is that it's the same characters over & over again.  This wasn't bad in Masterforce because it made sense that the cast was that small since they were stuck on Earth for the most part.  Here it spans galaxies but wherever we go it's always the Headmasters fighting each other.  I do really like Fortress Maximus' portrayal here though.  He was a good leader, & the Master Sword is pretty cool.  Whenever he transforms & uses it, it reminds me of Voltron.  But the last episode is ultimately unsatisfying.  Sixshot turns good because of Daniel?  Fortress Maximus is caught in Scorponok's grip & is released by the Autobots holding hands in a circle & channeling their friendship?!  The American shows were never this silly!Still, like I said, this is a decent set.  All Transfans should try this.  It's hardly the best, but it's not the worst Japanese Transformers show (that would be Beast Wars II, though even that had its moments).  I assure you, Masterforce & Victory (seasons 5 & 6) are much better than this.  Don't believe me?

1428054,A1HRSV96CROOBL,B004UFE2XM,"Zachary W. Dyer ""Steeljaw""","[0, 0]","Transformers: Headmasters is the first part in a loosely tied togethor trilogy of Japanese Transformers cartoons that served as a follow up to the third season of the Generation One cartoon. Instead of airing the three part finale The Rebirth in Japan, Takara decided to branch off and produce it's own series. Headmaster's is the first and is easily recognised as the most in common with the original American cartoon.The overall story of Headmasters is relatively basic each episode is mostly self contained with an occasional two parter. The Autobots continue the fight against the Decepticons while throughout the narrative new characters are introduced while older characters are phased out. The characterization and writing can vary, where a lot of the plots have a western feel gradually as the new cast becomes more dominant the anime influences in characters begin to show a lot more. I find viewing this with subtitles to actually work better for me when it comes to this, where if I heard this writing in an english cartoon it would probably irritate me to hear so many redundant sentences and repeating of dialog. However when you read it and hear the lines spoken in Japanese it sounds better and actually keeps my attention.The subtitles are not without errors, occasionally words are mispelled or names are wrong but over all you can see a lot of care was put into the writing. As other reviewers have mentioned dialog is written to match the older cast quite well. Grimlock for example still speaks in his ""Me Grimlock"" attitude. Of note though is where subgroups and minor characters are concerned they sometime go unnamed or get an alternative name. For example the Cassette-bots and Cassette-cons have been given the subgroup name ""Deployers"" which is actually a group from the Beast Machines toyline. The Deployers were beasts who transformed into weapons for the larger figures not unlike Targetmasters. Another example would be the autobot clones Fastlane and Cloudraker who feature prominently in one episode but are never named. Whether this is true in the actual dialog or not I can't be sure as I don't speak Japanese, but as far as subtitles go they are only refered to as ""Autobot Clones"". These are minor complaints as most of these guys are not main characters or are phased out over the course of the show.The DvD's themselves are of nice quality, the boxart depicts ChromeDome fighting SixShot, both are very prominent in the series and especially in Chromedome's case are very much main characters.One minor issue is on the episode listings. The inside artwork has the episodes listed according to the disks that they are on, however they are misprinted as each disc has an additional episode from the start of next disc, leaving the list completely wrong by the final disc. It's a minor complaint and doesn't detract at all from the set but it is worth noting if you're like me and don't use the play all function.The disc Menu's are really well done, nice CGI graphics that enhance the experience with the fantastic theme music from The Headmaster's cartoon running in the background. In the episode menu you're treated to a nice graphic of a 3d wire frame image of a character. What's odd though is not every character is from Headmaster's. For example disc one's menu is of Super Ginrai from Super God Masterforce, but Disc 2 is ChromeDome from Headmasters. I have not yet watched Shout Factory's release of Masterforce but I wouldn't be surprised if the menu system is reused.Another interesting note is the episodes themselves, during some of them an alternate opening sequence is used where a lot of the Decepticons are shadowed over. I cannot recall why this was done originally but it's neat to see both versions of the credits used.Overall this is a great value. You get a fantastic rendering of some rare episodes for a very reasonable price, I think a nice fan documentary discussing the differences of the series would've been great, but instead you get a small art gallery. Still for $20 bucks (at least at the time I purchased it) I felt like I was getting more then my money's worth just for the fact that I got a high quality release of a rare series in it's entirety.",4,Well worth the price,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,4218,"['Transformers', 'Headmasters', 'first', 'part', 'loosely', 'tied', 'togethor', 'trilogy', 'Japanese', 'Transformers', 'cartoons', 'served', 'follow', 'up', 'third', 'season', 'Generation', 'One', 'cartoon', 'Instead', 'airing', 'three', 'part', 'Rebirth', 'Japan', 'Takara', 'decided', 'branch', 'off', 'produce', 'own', 'series', 'Headmaster', 'first', 'easily', 'recognised', 'most', 'common', 'original', 'American', 'cartoon.The', 'overall', 'story', 'Headmasters', 'relatively', 'basic', 'episode', 'mostly', 'self', 'contained', 'occasional', 'two', 'parter', 'Autobots', 'continue', 'fight', 'Decepticons', 'narrative', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'older', 'characters', 'are', 'phased', 'out', 'characterization', 'writing', 'can', 'vary', 'where', 'lot', 'plots', 'have', 'western', 'feel', 'gradually', 'new', 'cast', 'more', 'dominant', 'anime', 'influences', 'characters', 'begin', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'find', 'viewing', 'subtitles', 'actually', 'work', 'better', 'when', 'where', 'heard', 'writing', 'english', 'cartoon', 'would', 'probably', 'irritate', 'hear', 'so', 'many', 'redundant', 'sentences', 'repeating', 'dialog', 'However', 'when', 'read', 'hear', 'lines', 'spoken', 'Japanese', 'better', 'actually', 'keeps', 'attention.The', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'errors', 'occasionally', 'words', 'are', 'mispelled', 'names', 'are', 'wrong', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'care', 'was', 'put', 'writing', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'dialog', 'written', 'match', 'older', 'cast', 'quite', 'well', 'Grimlock', 'example', 'still', 'Me', 'Grimlock', 'attitude', 'note', 'though', 'where', 'subgroups', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'sometime', 'go', 'unnamed', 'get', 'alternative', 'name', 'example', 'Cassette-bots', 'Cassette-cons', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'subgroup', 'name', 'Deployers', 'actually', 'group', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'toyline', 'Deployers', 'were', 'beasts', 'who', 'transformed', 'weapons', 'larger', 'figures', 'not', 'Targetmasters', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'autobot', 'clones', 'Fastlane', 'Cloudraker', 'who', 'feature', 'prominently', 'one', 'episode', 'are', 'never', 'named', 'Whether', 'true', 'actual', 'dialog', 'not', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Japanese', 'as', 'far', 'subtitles', 'go', 'are', 'only', 'refered', 'Autobot', 'Clones', 'are', 'minor', 'complaints', 'most', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'phased', 'out', 'course', 'show.The', 'DvD', 'are', 'nice', 'quality', 'boxart', 'ChromeDome', 'fighting', 'SixShot', 'are', 'very', 'prominent', 'series', 'especially', 'Chromedome', 'case', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'main', 'characters.One', 'minor', 'issue', 'episode', 'listings', 'inside', 'artwork', 'episodes', 'listed', 'according', 'disks', 'are', 'however', 'are', 'misprinted', 'disc', 'additional', 'episode', 'start', 'next', 'disc', 'leaving', 'list', 'completely', 'wrong', 'final', 'disc', 'minor', 'complaint', ""n't"", 'detract', 'set', 'worth', 'noting', ""'re"", 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'play', 'function.The', 'disc', 'Menu', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'nice', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'enhance', 'experience', 'fantastic', 'theme', 'music', 'Headmaster', 'cartoon', 'running', 'background', 'episode', 'menu', ""'re"", 'treated', 'nice', 'graphic', '3d', 'wire', 'frame', 'image', 'character', 'What', 'odd', 'though', 'not', 'character', 'Headmaster', 'example', 'disc', 'one', 'menu', 'Super', 'Ginrai', 'Super', 'God', 'Masterforce', 'Disc', '2', 'ChromeDome', 'Headmasters', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'watched', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'release', 'Masterforce', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'menu', 'system', 'reused.Another', 'interesting', 'note', 'episodes', 'alternate', 'opening', 'sequence', 'used', 'where', 'lot', 'Decepticons', 'are', 'shadowed', 'can', 'not', 'recall', 'why', 'was', 'done', 'originally', 'neat', 'see', 'versions', 'credits', 'used.Overall', 'great', 'value', 'get', 'fantastic', 'rendering', 'rare', 'episodes', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'think', 'nice', 'fan', 'documentary', 'discussing', 'differences', 'series', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'instead', 'get', 'small', 'art', 'gallery', 'Still', '20', 'bucks', 'least', 'time', 'purchased', 'felt', 'was', 'getting', 'more', 'then', 'money', 'worth', 'just', 'fact', 'got', 'high', 'quality', 'release', 'rare', 'series', 'entirety']",Transformers Japanese Collection: Headmasters
