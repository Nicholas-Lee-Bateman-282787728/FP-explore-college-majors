I was loving it until it was almost over at which point she promptly turned it off. There were five minutes left but before I could complain she insisted that she refuses to see the end of the movie. She told me I could borrow the tape and watch it on my own time. Confused, I took the tape home and went to bed, thinking that it had been a very good movie. Later that week I went back and watched the last five minutes and I now understand why she insisted on turning it off. The ending is TERRIBLE. It's like the director made a great movie and then in the ending he felt guilty and decided that he had to throw some morals in. It ruined the movie. So watch this movie, enjoy it, think about all the wild hedonistic adventures you had in college, and then turn it off before it goes bad.",4,Wild Hedonistic Playful College Adventures,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,864,"['friend', 'mine', 'video', 'watched', 'lazy', 'Sunday', 'night', 'was', 'loving', 'was', 'almost', 'point', 'promptly', 'turned', 'off', 'were', 'five', 'minutes', 'left', 'could', 'complain', 'insisted', 'see', 'end', 'movie', 'told', 'could', 'borrow', 'tape', 'watch', 'own', 'time', 'Confused', 'took', 'tape', 'home', 'went', 'bed', 'thinking', 'had', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Later', 'week', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'insisted', 'turning', 'off', 'ending', 'TERRIBLE', 'director', 'made', 'great', 'movie', 'then', 'ending', 'felt', 'guilty', 'decided', 'had', 'throw', 'morals', 'ruined', 'movie', 'So', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'think', 'wild', 'hedonistic', 'adventures', 'had', 'college', 'then', 'turn', 'off', 'bad']",N/A

While Eddy is serious, clean, quiet and shy, Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) is a messy, girl chasing little boy. The manage to find a way to live together, when Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) moves into the other room in the suite - since her college record says she's a guy, not a girl. Stuart is attracted to Alex, while she's attracted ot Eddy, which soon discovers that not only is he gay, but he's attracted to Stuart... Sensing that sex would make their life together tough, they vow to avoid having it with one another (even though they scare all other suitors), and become close friends - so close, this friendship excludes every one else... But, they break their promise and have sex, in unlikely forms, and the 'Threesome' eventually break up...This movie is more than sex and sexual discovery - it's also about friendship and its boundries. As Eddy, our narator, sees it, the Threesome meant to him more than sex - he feels that he developed true friendship with Stuart and Alex. At the end of the movie, he wonders how people as close as they all were during that year in college can lose their connection with one another. In the alternate ending scene (which is included in the DVD with or without Andrew Fleming's commentary) we can see how people who were close as can be can't have a conversation without uncomfortable silences a couple of years later... Eddy feels he still wanted this friendship even when Alex and Stuart were running away from it, and the only one who felt comfortable enough to admit he wants and needs it... Ths situation in the movie was taken to an extreme, but I think that looking back, most of us had friendships like that - close, but when they ended for the wrong reasons you had nothing to say to each other...",4,Can't happen in real life but still fun!,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2064,"['chances', 'anything', 'happening', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'pretty', 'slim', 'movie', 'minor', 'point', 'me.Eddy', 'wonderful', 'Josh', 'Charles', ""'Dead"", 'Poets', 'Society', 'wonder', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'dorms', 'only', 'get', 'roommate', 'hell', 'who', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Eddy', 'serious', 'clean', 'quiet', 'shy', 'Stuart', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'messy', 'girl', 'chasing', 'little', 'boy', 'manage', 'find', 'way', 'live', 'together', 'when', 'Alex', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'other', 'room', 'suite', 'college', 'record', 'guy', 'not', 'girl', 'Stuart', 'attracted', 'Alex', 'attracted', 'ot', 'Eddy', 'soon', 'discovers', 'not', 'only', 'gay', 'attracted', 'Stuart', 'Sensing', 'sex', 'would', 'make', 'life', 'together', 'tough', 'vow', 'avoid', 'having', 'one', 'even', 'scare', 'other', 'suitors', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'so', 'close', 'friendship', 'one', 'else', 'break', 'promise', 'have', 'sex', 'unlikely', 'forms', ""'Threesome"", 'eventually', 'break', 'up', 'movie', 'more', 'sex', 'sexual', 'discovery', 'also', 'about', 'friendship', 'boundries', 'Eddy', 'narator', 'Threesome', 'meant', 'more', 'sex', 'developed', 'true', 'friendship', 'Stuart', 'Alex', 'end', 'movie', 'how', 'people', 'as', 'close', 'were', 'year', 'college', 'can', 'lose', 'connection', 'one', 'alternate', 'ending', 'scene', 'included', 'DVD', 'Andrew', 'Fleming', 'commentary', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'close', 'can', 'be', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'conversation', 'uncomfortable', 'silences', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Eddy', 'feels', 'still', 'wanted', 'friendship', 'even', 'when', 'Alex', 'Stuart', 'were', 'running', 'away', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'admit', 'Ths', 'situation', 'movie', 'was', 'taken', 'extreme', 'think', 'looking', 'back', 'most', 'had', 'friendships', 'close', 'when', 'ended', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'had', 'nothing', 'say', 'other']",N/A

Anchored by three dynamic performances, the film hits upon many universal truths in its exploration of these three characters and the unique bond that they form.Threesome hits upon ideas that reflect growing up in the Gen X era. The styling, the music, the attitudes, the angst, the exploration of sexuality, the notion of wanting to be either an academic or a slacker, the portrait of college life, it all really hits home and resonates with those who grew up in that era.Nothing about the film feels fake or artificial. It all feels effortless. It rings of emotional honesty and truth. Viewers get a good sense of who the characters are and what makes them tick. Part of the Gen X movement was that sense of alternative fun, but after awhile the party ended and everyone had to grow up. Threesome reflects being part of the Gen X movement. However, a lot of what is being said can relate to people of all different kinds of generations.Threesome has an honesty, a matter of fact approach to it. The characters aren't always perfect. They makes mistakes, but they are real. That realness is what makes Threesome special and gives it a layer of dimensionality that's missing in other mainstream fare.

163832,A111JO8Q4DSUZH,0800137531,"D. Recio, SJ","[10, 10]","Threesome (1994), despite some lapses into puerile humor, remains a thoughtful film about college life. While films like Reality Bites (1994) focus more on the trials of life after college, Threesome ventures into the lives of three students who meet during their third year of school. Eddy (Josh Charles), a transfer student, finds himself assigned to room with a likeable yet Neanderthal-esque, Stuart (Stephen Baldwin), whose primary focus in life includes cutting corners, drinking, and conquering hapless women. As a result of a bureaucratic error, Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) finds herself assigned to the same suite as Eddy and Stuart. Initially, Alex avoids her two male neighbors until she realizes their friendship might be worth greater consideration.Threesome is a drama/comedy which will appeal more to a Generation X audience that went to college during the late 80's through the 90's. The comedy in Threesome is quirky and irreverent, offering an honest portrayal of young adults as they explore their own academic concerns while managing the tricky balance of dorm life, the latter an easier pastime given the freedoms that come with living away from home. Fleming allows us to see how three disparate characters could be drawn into a kind of physical attraction resembling something out of Sartre's No Exit. Yet, he allows each of them enough character development so that their complexities surface with relative ease as they come to know one another better.Eventually, Threesome is about friendship and not sex. The moral in Threesome is that sex can complicate friendships and when all of them are faced with a difficult situation towards the end of the film, it is no surprise that the dilemma which leaves them reeling is enough to sever the closeness which they shared at the outset. Threesome does not idealize friendship as if it were something permanent and stable, but offers a candid look at relations in which people can find mutuality and intimacy in short periods and that unforeseen circumstances which bring people together can be enough to provoke exploration.",4,Funny and Poignant Look at College Life,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,2090,"['Threesome', '1994', 'lapses', 'puerile', 'humor', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'college', 'life', 'films', 'Reality', 'Bites', '1994', 'focus', 'more', 'trials', 'life', 'college', 'Threesome', 'ventures', 'lives', 'three', 'students', 'who', 'meet', 'third', 'year', 'school', 'Eddy', 'Josh', 'Charles', 'transfer', 'student', 'assigned', 'room', 'likeable', 'yet', 'Neanderthal-esque', 'Stuart', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'primary', 'focus', 'life', 'cutting', 'corners', 'drinking', 'conquering', 'hapless', 'women', 'result', 'bureaucratic', 'error', 'Alex', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'assigned', 'same', 'suite', 'Eddy', 'Stuart', 'Initially', 'Alex', 'two', 'male', 'neighbors', 'friendship', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'greater', 'consideration.Threesome', 'drama/comedy', 'will', 'appeal', 'more', 'Generation', 'X', 'audience', 'went', 'college', 'late', '80', '90', 'comedy', 'Threesome', 'quirky', 'irreverent', 'offering', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'young', 'adults', 'explore', 'own', 'academic', 'concerns', 'managing', 'tricky', 'balance', 'dorm', 'life', 'latter', 'easier', 'pastime', 'given', 'freedoms', 'come', 'living', 'away', 'home', 'Fleming', 'see', 'how', 'three', 'disparate', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'drawn', 'kind', 'physical', 'attraction', 'resembling', 'something', 'Sartre', 'No', 'Exit', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'complexities', 'surface', 'relative', 'ease', 'come', 'know', 'one', 'better.Eventually', 'Threesome', 'friendship', 'not', 'sex', 'moral', 'Threesome', 'sex', 'can', 'complicate', 'friendships', 'when', 'are', 'faced', 'difficult', 'situation', 'end', 'film', 'surprise', 'dilemma', 'reeling', 'enough', 'sever', 'closeness', 'shared', 'outset', 'Threesome', 'not', 'idealize', 'friendship', 'were', 'something', 'permanent', 'stable', 'candid', 'look', 'relations', 'people', 'can', 'find', 'mutuality', 'intimacy', 'short', 'periods', 'unforeseen', 'circumstances', 'bring', 'people', 'together', 'can', 'be', 'enough', 'provoke', 'exploration']",N/A

These three people would be absolutely obnoxious in real life but in a movie they are hilarious. There were some things I didn't like though. The gay guy gets dragged through the mud through the whole movie. He's so desperate to have sex that he does it with a girl. He gets rejected by the guy he is in love with. He actually does get to have sex with that guy but the girl is in between them. It would have been nice if he could have had a more intimate moment with the person he loved. Also, the ending was very depressing for me. They all go off in different directions in life and they're all sad. Even the alternate ending, which the DVD provides, is depressing. This movie is GREAT but if I were to watch it again I would stop it when it got near the end and then make up my own ending in my mind.

163839,A27RUG27Y2HHIL,0800137531,Pessimystica,"[8, 11]","This is one of my favorite movies that I can watch over & over, & is just simply hilarious.  Immediately you're introduced to the roommate Stuart's male antics, & I thought Baldwin played the part really well.  How could you forget his disgusting confession to Eddie, ""I just love the smell of her ..."", or him bragging ""Sex...is like pizza...even if it's bad, it's still pretty good!!""  Alex is one of those confused, yet pretentious characters you want to hate, yet end up relating to at the same time, like when she's whining about guys ""who don't give a ... about me"".  So many people want certain qualities in a person in relationships, but then the people they go after are really nothing what they really want...like scary Larry :)  And who couldn't relate to her insecurities, like whining about being fat...even though she's far from it, or warning Eddie not to toy with her emotions.  Eddie, the narrator, is basically just an intellectual who happens to be confused about his sexuality, and often seems to be in deep thought, even when he's not saying anything outloud or to himself.  And I think college, being the ultimate place for self-discovery (if you go to it anyway), couldn't be a better place to set his search.The relationship of Stuart, Eddie & Alex hits me at home, reminding me of the close friendships I've had being inclusive, inhibiting outsiders, making fun of those not in the club cuz they don't get the joke, etc.  Like in the middle of the movie, you meet Stuart's cutesy, air-headed date, & though you feel kinda sorry for her because you wouldn't wanna be made fun of like the way they treated her, you know that most people have done that sort of thing before.  There's also various public scenes displaying their behaviour, & they seem to have no care or remorse for what others think...which brings another good point...they don't CARE what you think of them!!Their relationship gets, as expected, twisted at the end with the threesome, & I think if you were considering doing this (who hasn't at least thought about it at one point), & were concerned with feelings of the persons involved, the shattered friendship afterwards might actually make you think twice.  Then at the end, Eddie reflects by noting how some people are so important one minute, & then gone the next...which is so true.  Even after the 1st time I saw this movie when I was a freshman in college shortly after it came out on video (how ideal, huh?), I got a sense of some points & morals put in the movie, but also set in a very funny & entertaining atmosphere.  Though it does deal a lot with sexual issues, I think it focuses more with personal relations.I dunno what's not to like about this movie, unless it's too sexual for your preference...want more sex, just see American Pie, but Threesome at least goes beyond just sex.  Some of the humor just goes over some people's heads, I think...it's either funny to some people or it isn't...you either get the joke or you don't!!  But if you ask me, it's funny as hell.  And I also agree with another reviewer, you have to be open-minded to appreciate this, or at least allow yourself to be open-minded (like I think I was when I first saw it).  I've seen this countless number of times, but you could probably tell this already...I could quote LOTS more, lol.  It's always good & funny the next time I see it, & also leaves you with a few things to think about too...isn't that what a good movie is about?
