In some sense, ""Capitalism"" shows Michael Moore's allegiance to a country he loves.  Generally, Moore (and his work) is one you will either love or hate... there is no middle ground.  This movie is not his best work, but it is still stirring and somewhat informative.  Some might say it is one-sided, and others will agree.  The examples presented are extreme and engaging, but maybe it is what we need to motivate ourselves to do what we can to get out of the hole we are in right now.  Capitalism works, and it works for the many, but capitalism works well only for the few.  I probably will not recommend this movie as a ""must-see.""

1315806,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0030Y11O2,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","First, although this documentary was just released last year it already has a dated feel to it, as governmental regimes have changed but not the greedy profit motive that drives the capitalist economy and which the twin governmental parties of capitalism, Republican and Democratic, each in their way, serve. Moore's main object at the time, I assume, was to take advantage, easy advantage as the case turned out, of the villainous characters that ran the capitalist government under President Bush, under whose regime all economic hell broke loose. That was then, and this is now though. The easily interchangeable cast of characters now look remarkable the same, the wars the same, unemployment still at modern day highs, Wall Street bonuses obscene, Congress still  under the thumb (as Moore, in his great film-making capacity, really captures)  under new ""go to"" guy Obama. Sure, plenty of people had (and still have) plenty of illusions in Obama so Brother Moore was not alone, although some of the others had enough sense not to film their glee for the world to see and  thus have to shield their faces from public view  when the inevitable shoe fell.Second, one of the central motifs here is Moore's notion that this country can turn itself around by going back to some form of Rooseveltian ""New Deal (his Second Bill Of Rights). But his big push is for social and political action by the ""little people."" (Called by Moore, and others, the middle class, although it is really called the working class, brother, at least from the film footage interviews from such towns as Detroit and Cleveland. There is nothing wrong with calling a thing by its right name, okay?) Moore makes several plugs (including at the end) for people to ""do something.""  Unfortunately, such a vague statement in politics can be turned on you. In a racist-tinged, anti-immigrant, starve public services (part of which is directed at those same two groups) ""Age of the Tea Party"", political action by the ""little people"" is not always without a program, a socialist program, the kind of clarion call to action that he was looking for. So political programmatic clarity, always in short supply with Moore, is a must.Finally, although I didn't notice it as much on the first viewing Moore's worldview is informed by an almost Catholic Workers movement-like (formed in the old Great Depression days by  Dorothy Day and others, and later included followers like the Berrigan brothers and many ex-priests and ex-nuns) sensibility. Now, as I, perhaps, have mentioned before Dorothy Day was revered in my childhood home, especially by my devout, pious poor mother. So I can thus sense, as that spark also drove part of my own social education, the origins of  the quest for justice in Moore's work, if not for his conclusions. But Brother Moore that was long ago, and I was just I kid.

His breakout movie wasRoger & Me,which showed how Big Business was hurting workers and communities at GM in Flint, Michigan. ""Capitalism"" is about the current economic crisis, so it's more wide-reaching. Michael Moore is a convincing documentarian. Yes, his work is definitely biased, but he's persuasive.""Capitalism"" discusses how the banks have robbed the poor and enriched the rich. Of course, Moore lavishes praise on Cuba, Venezuela, and socialist countries. He seems to be blind to the real abuses in those countries. In Cuba, political dissidents are jailed. Here, Moore can freely criticize George W. Bush. Moore also brings in his Catholic background. He rightly bashes the prosperity gospel.

1315808,A1QG13XG3EO2CX,B0030Y11O2,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","In this film Moore takes on the financial industry and the recent financial/banking fiasco. He does his usual job of trying to put an individual human face on larger issues. He shows a few families that have had their homes foreclosed on and talks to them. He also goes through a few other corruption stories that have been in the news recently and tries to tie them all together to show how the profit motive has caused people to act improperly. He then goes into a long discussion of the issues on wall street, the economic factors that led to it, and the bailouts, which he portrays as a government gift to the bankers. On the whole he tries to tie all the negatives he portrays to one central theme - unfettered capitalism.As is usual for Moore he raises some good points, but isn't really interested in showing all sides of the issue. If you are sympathetic to the point of view that Moore is representing then you will probably come out of this movie more convinced in your position. If you go into this movie opposed to the ideas Moore is showing you will probably not be convinced.The best part of the DVD (IMHO) were actually the extras. Most of them are longer and uncut conversations that Moore has with various people including Chris Hedges (NY Times), Elijah Cummings (congressman from MD), Michael Pollan (The omnivore's Dilemma), and Father Dick Preston (his childhood pastor who makes a few appearances in the film). There are also stories on two employee owned businesses. Because they're unedited they are much more thoughtful conversations and are a more free of the general moviemaking editorial process.

A lot of the stuff is biased and one sided. For instance, we see a foreclosed family getting evicted but there has to be more to the story. What did they do with the money they got from the bank using their home as collateral? He seems to pick out the worst of society and then blames it on the government. For instance, the closed factories of Flint Michigan are shown. Who told GM to build Hummers and gargantuan beasts of steel that fall apart and nobody wants to buy? He should visit a Toyota factory in Tennessee or a Honda factory in Ohio where they are building quality cars that people actually want to buy and have no regrets about. This DVD is entirely one sided but it has a lot of Roger Moore humor to get a point across. It's obvious he hates George Bush and Ronald Reagan but doesn't mention that it was Bill Clinton who deregulated the banks so they can essentially do Casino gambling with our money. I'm no fan of big business or the banks but both sides of the story needs to be portrayed for fairness.

Capitalism  describes vividly and funnily at times through eloquent images of decent hardworking Americans and authoritative testimonies by academic, political and church representatives how predatory and immoral financial capitalism has replaced productive capitalism , ruining millions of families in the process and the real economy.All this happened  whilst scores of Wall Street crooks and criminals became rich beyond belief thanks to the banking/financial deregulation they and their accomplices in Washington pushed through the White House particularly under Clinton's presidency. The same people who orchestrated and benefited from this financial looting have been appointed by Obama to resolve the problem they created!! So much for a President who promised change but is obviously in the service of his oligarch friends/supporters instead of serving the interests of the American people including the millions who trusted him! Except for Madoff no criminal prosecution has been initiated by Obama's Justice Department against any of the dishonest banksters and regulators who benefited from this latest financial bubble.Particularly compelling are the testimonies (Special features of the DVD) of Harvard Prof. E.Warren, Prof. W.

He researched this one quite well, talking to people whose farms and homes have been foreclosed, walking with his father over the empty ground where his father's 33-year job in a factory had taken place. He tried to get a real answer to the question ""What is a derivative?"" from both traders and academic economists. He documented the door and window factory that was closed by Bank of America, occupied by its workers because they hadn't gotten the pay they were owed, and then opened again as a co-op by those same workers. He toured the bakery in California which is a very successful co-op, and in fact I remember their bread fondly. He also went to the big Wall Street banks and asked for our money back, wrapping the entire block in a ""crime scene"" yellow tape.Sure, some of the things he does are stunts, done for the publicity rather than for any serious impact. But that publicity IS serious impact. And interestingly, a majority of the 700 billion bailout has indeed been payed back by now.One important point that may not have been made as clearly as it needed to be was the war over words that is tied up in the financial crisis. For too long, we developed a duck-and-cover mentality at the very mention of the word Socialism, let alone Communism. It's time we developed a healthy skepticism about Capitalism, too. The fact is, any of these ""economic theories"" which are touted as THE solution or THE problem are dangerous in their distilled form.What we need, really, is pragmatism. Perhaps if we started capitalizing it and writing scholarly journal articles about it, that would help. But we need to look at each proposed change for its intended and unintended consequences, what alternatives might work better, how compromise might be reached. If we can't really fix the health care system without a single payer plan like Medicare for all, as I believe to be the case, then let's not be put off by the label ""socialized medicine.""",4,The Unique Political Humor of Michael Moore,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1976,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'again', 'researched', 'one', 'quite', 'well', 'talking', 'people', 'farms', 'homes', 'have', 'been', 'foreclosed', 'walking', 'father', 'empty', 'ground', 'where', 'father', '33-year', 'job', 'factory', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'tried', 'get', 'real', 'answer', 'question', 'What', 'derivative', 'traders', 'academic', 'economists', 'documented', 'door', 'window', 'factory', 'was', 'closed', 'Bank', 'America', 'occupied', 'workers', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'pay', 'were', 'owed', 'then', 'opened', 'again', 'co-op', 'same', 'workers', 'toured', 'bakery', 'California', 'very', 'successful', 'co-op', 'fact', 'remember', 'bread', 'fondly', 'also', 'went', 'big', 'Wall', 'Street', 'banks', 'asked', 'money', 'back', 'wrapping', 'entire', 'block', 'crime', 'scene', 'yellow', 'tape.Sure', 'things', 'are', 'stunts', 'done', 'publicity', 'rather', 'serious', 'impact', 'publicity', 'serious', 'impact', 'interestingly', 'majority', '700', 'billion', 'bailout', 'indeed', 'been', 'payed', 'back', 'now.One', 'important', 'point', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'as', 'clearly', 'needed', 'be', 'was', 'war', 'words', 'tied', 'up', 'financial', 'crisis', 'too', 'long', 'developed', 'duck-and-cover', 'mentality', 'very', 'mention', 'word', 'Socialism', 'let', 'alone', 'Communism', 'time', 'developed', 'healthy', 'skepticism', 'Capitalism', 'too', 'fact', 'economic', 'theories', 'are', 'touted', 'solution', 'problem', 'are', 'dangerous', 'distilled', 'need', 'really', 'pragmatism', 'Perhaps', 'started', 'capitalizing', 'writing', 'scholarly', 'journal', 'articles', 'would', 'help', 'need', 'look', 'proposed', 'change', 'intended', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'what', 'alternatives', 'might', 'work', 'better', 'how', 'compromise', 'might', 'be', 'reached', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fix', 'health', 'care', 'system', 'single', 'payer', 'plan', 'Medicare', 'all', 'believe', 'be', 'case', 'then', 'let', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'label', 'socialized', 'medicine']",N/A

But I was so moved by this the urge to add my thoughts was undeniable.When I first became interested in America and its history I thought very little of the country.  Then my attitude changed and I became a flag waver.  No I would like to wave the flag, but my view is clouded by what I've seen wrong with the country and the ignorance, stupidity and hyporacy of the elected officials and the voters who put them where they can do the most harm.  My fear is we will get the result we vote for.  Why should I care?  My time on this earth is growing very short, but there are people who are important to me and I don't want them to suffer because of the idiots who seem to have all the energy and wealth needed to rule our government.I believe in the inevitability of revolution.  No group of people will support a government which neglects their human needs forever.  What I fear is who will lead and begin this revolution.  It looks very much like it will be the extreme right wing who demand the return to the good days of the past when America was great and the dhining city on the hill offering a beacon to the rest of the world.  Sounds great if you know nothing of the ""good old days of moral values and the benefits of capitalism.""  Does communism work? No. For the same reason that Christianity does not work.  It is against human nature.  No one is willing to support the common good if it will cost him.  This is the same reason capitalism doesn't work.  It is a religion that recognizes and uses the basic flaws in human nature that keep us from being as human as we shouid be.  A newspaper columnist once said, ""The trouble with the beautiful people is they are neither.""  This is the problem with the cpoitalist:  he is neither beautiful nor human.I normally don't look at tthis type of show because it depresses me to realize there are many problems that I can do nothing about.  There are many error of judgement that I cannot ecducate about.  When the radical right ""leaders"" advocate secession I say ""let them go.""

Michael Moore is very effective at showing to full effect the horrors he feels are taking place.  But sadly he is also over the top and has become a voice in many people's opinion not worth listening to if you don't agree to some degree with this opinion.  Many are saying here that CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY is not about parties Republican or Democrat but rather about capitalism, democracy and the awful state of the economy and how we got there.He starts off showing happy living in the 50s where families had one income and all survived well.  But as some got richer and those with less lived wanting more and greed and want got involved the whole dynamic changed.  While watching this film it is easy to believe that everything shown is 100% fact and that it is the reasons given that are the only ones to explain society's breakdown.  It is of course more complicated than that.  The film is long at 2 hours and climaxes at the economic crisis at the end of Bush's preidency and the bailout of large corporations.  This was one of the worst times in history and deserves such strong attention but when Moore says it didn't need to happen is this fact or his opinion.  I am a Democrat and believe that there are definite moral, value and economic differences between the left and the right.  But this film which claims to be bias free is in my opinion a strong letter of blame to the republicans and tries to show the democrats as the saviors.  Angels sing and the earth parts when he shows Obama becoming president.  And then when centering on a Democrat the tone changes.I believe much of what Moore says is true but I do not believe answers are so easy to find.  I certainly do not believe in stereotypes of republicans and democrats and that all republicans are to blame for all that is wrong with the country and the economy.  Different agendas certainly are part of the two parties platforms but all democrats are not innocent victims.  At the same time this documentary is hugely important to view.  It raises life altering questions that concern us all and will keep you thinking for a long time.  But you must remember the film is one man's opinion and the information he researched is used to stress the opinions he has.  There is always another side to every story and sadly he leaves this part out.  It is sad that his message is so anti right wing for I don't blame any republican for seeing this as just a smear campaign.

And they are typically so big I can't imagine one person would.

1315817,A3NO9TSFVL1ZJD,B0030Y11O2,Bosco Hoggins,"[8, 10]","I have been a big Michael Moore fan in the past and have seen most of his movies as well as most, if not all, of TV Nation and The Awful Truth. In most all of these efforts it was really refreshing to see Moore as a fearless scrapper trying desperately to speak truth to power; of particular merit was Roger & Me, where Moore presented in blistering clarity the disparity between GM's upper management and its work force. Other notable efforts include Fahrenheit 911 and Sicko (you can kinda take or leave Bowling for Columbine and The Big One.) It's important that we have people willing to do this and I generally applaud his efforts, even in the areas that I do not necessarily agree.However, the whole point is that it must be TRUTH that is spoken and that is where this effort goes off the rails. I saw Capitalism: A Love Story last night and was really taken aback by how far Mr. Moore went beyond advocacy documentary into outright distortion.A couple of notes on this:(i) A huge segment of the film is spent on TARP and what is called repeatedly the ""Bank Bailout"". However, in none of this coverage was it disclosed or mentioned: (a) TARP to financial institutions was a loan, not a gift, which required payment with substantial interest; (b) most major FIs did not want the TARP funds and many took it over objection; (c) TARP recipients were required to post collateral (convertible warrants) against the TARP funds; (d) all major TARP financial institutions (other than AIG and Regions) have, in fact, paid back the TARP funds; and (e) the government made a profit on TARP to FIs.(ii) Who has the government not recouped TARP funds from? You guessed it - the auto industry (Chrysler, GM, and GMAC). It kind of ruins Mr. Moore's thesis that the pension obligations of all those salt-of-the-earth folks back in Flint were a major contributor to TARP non-repayment.(iii) Throughout the film, foreclosures are blamed exclusively on banks and FIs; Mr. Moore makes a show of making ""citizen's arrests"" and covering banks in crime scene tape. However, the reality is really a lot more complicated than that banks tricked or otherwise defrauded people out of their homes. There is a little segment regarding how some banks induced homeowners into leveraging equity in their homes, but beyond that not a whole lot of analysis. In reality, home prices actually did rise throughout the 2000's, due in no small part to historically low interest rates. Homeowners acted perfectly rationally in leveraging the excess equity in their homes, as long as home prices continued to rise or even to stabilize at the higher levels. It was the collapse of the real estate bubble that hammered so many homeowners, not fraudulent loans. One could make the argument that banks should have advised more caution than they did, but again that's not what Mr. Moore is arguing. To say that banks defrauded homeowners on a large scale is just incorrect.(iv) The section on Dead Peasant insurance seemed pretty dishonest to me. The whole idea about companies taking out life insurance on its employees is that a company is materially affected when key employees die and needs to have some kind of risk mitigant against this. An analogy would be if in days past, a business has a key piece of equipment or capital (say a factory); if the company loses that factory unexpectedly, it will need immediate money to get back on track after the loss. Today, human capital (especially at higher levels) is really the key investments of modern corporations. If a company loses a key employee, it will (a) lose all of the resources that it invested in developing the employee; (b) lose all of the specific knowledge, plans, strategies, etc. that person had; and (c) have to find and develop someone new quickly. It is not fraudulent at all to want to plan ahead for this kind of expense and buying insurance on an employee really does not implicate a fraud at all (there is no trickery or detrimental reliance). However, Mr. Moore depicts this practice (quite strongly) as fraud on the employee's family and as attempts by companies to profit off the deaths of their employees.(v) There is a strong implication that the crash of an airline flight causing 50 deaths (I think it was Comair Flight 191, but am not sure) was a result of financial hardships put on its pilots. This naked assertion is back up only by the fact that the pilot and co-pilot had discussed financial matters earlier in the flight and that the co-pilot had a second job in a restaurant. This was a pretty weak thread to hang the whole argument that pilots are paid too little on.  Even if one agrees with that pilots should be paid more (and I find some merit to the argument), this seems like a pretty weaselly way to frame the question.(vi) The Black-Shoals Formula is shown on the screen with Mr. Moore explaining that the formula was specifically designed to be too complicated for everyday investors to understand. Absolutely factually inaccurate. BSF was created to model (imperfectly) the pricing of fairly simple concepts (rights to buy and sell as specific prices in the future called put and call options). It was created by academics to approximate the best way to price existing instruments, not to confuse or mislead anyone.Also, not really an inaccuracy, but.... While complex derivatives are pretty hard to explain, calls and puts are not. Mr. Moore presents these basic ideas like they are so complex not even experts can explain them.ConclusionSo, at the end of the day, would I recommend this movie? Probably not. If you are already pretty knowledgeable about TARP and the financial crisis, the lapses in fact and analysis will probably be too striking for you to enjoy the film. If not, you will need to go in understanding that you should beware that you will be mislead in some areas and that you should probably consult a counter-point to balance out some of the misperceptions presented.",2,Moore has done a lot better,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,5951,"['have', 'been', 'big', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'fan', 'past', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'as', 'well',

1315819,ARK5SAGVLW3FY,B0030Y11O2,bunnyrabbit4,"[2, 3]","Michael Moore's ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is an important film. Detractors will point out every chink in his thinking and try to make the point that because of what he didn't say, his film is dead wrong and he is one of those mindless socialists just waiting to add paying your neighbor's house note to paying your neighbor's healthcare. They will reduce his words to a few mistakes and call it a day.  After all, he says the American dream is dead, capitalism is evil and we would be better off if we owned our companies and worked directly for ourselves without stockholders. No one wants to hear that.Schools don't teach about the flaws in our capitalist system or about the control of wealth by an ever shrinking class, but this is the result of long term capitalism.  They don't teach us that we are part of a global economy either. All that is way too complex and certainly not something you are going to get in a five minute quasi news package offered by your favorite news/entertainment network. Besides, the capitalism of today with its complex financial investment tools is far different from the original ideal of free market values. The capitalism that Moore explores in great historical detail has grown so large that it makes its own rules, controls government and engages in immoral conduct while waving the flag of God and country.Moore's movie shines a light on the real people and places being affected by a greed driven system, such as a woman who learned that her husband's corporation had taken out a million dollar life insurance policy on him. Interesting in light of what we know about the killer effects of stress. The movie goes on to list many companies that engage in this practice and they include all the biggies, even Walmart!One of the most moving parts of the film for me was watching ""Sully"" the pilot who ditched his plane into the Hudson River, talk about how his pay had been cut 40% over the last few years and his pension terminated. It went on to say that most new pilots make between 16 and 20K and take second jobs to make ends meet. Stewards used to make more than that! What is happening? Where is the money going?Moore gives us something in this film that the news media never does, a true historical background to our financial dilemma. We never get the ""real"" history of an event from the news. No one wants to sit that long. The event is usually traced back to the last Republican or Democrat involved and that person becomes the fall guy. The viewers are happy to see their side win and the topic is dropped. That kind of ignorance is what has placed us where we are today. Moore shows us that the roots go much deeper. Our governmental ""experts"" are not chosen from the best and brightest minds but from the corporations with the most to lose if things don't go their way. Key committee chairs receive special ""loans"" that never show up as campaign contributions. There is a ""system"" in place that does not change from one political party to the next.Moore can be sarcastic and silly at times and initially may have put too much faith in Obama (a stance he has since backed off of).  Still, he asks the right questions and the answers aren't pretty. There is no easy solution to the problems we face and there is no one party or candidate who can make things right. As he advocates, we are going to have to wake up and make our voices heard. Regardless of your party affiliation...watch this film. Every economic and governmental system has a weakness.

I happen to love the man, because he is a filmmaker that goes after the bad guys with no sympathy or compromise - the way it should be. You can't be nice or make deals with people whose policies kill human beings. Moore has gone after them over and over with, for example, ""Bowling for Columbine ""(2002), ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" (2004), ""Sicko"" (2007), and he does it again with the fascinating and powerful ""Capitalism: A Love Story.""The film is really a compendium of many stories put together, all of them providing evidence of the destructive nature of the capitalist system. Moore immediately makes the connection and establishes similarities between the rise and fall of ancient Rome with the United States under George Bush II. From then on, Moore visits some folks that have been evicted from their homes due to the current mortgage crisis created by Wall Street, showcasing one fellow -- a vulture -- that sells homes from evicted people, and who says that he ""got the desire to get advantage of other misfortunes,"" claiming that ""this is straight capitalism."" Moore traces back the crisis to 1980, when Wall Street and corporate U.S.A. got in sync thanks to the Ronald Reagan administration, laying the foundations for the culture of short-term profits and massive lay-offs.  He goes on to use examples in the airline and insurance industries, where these practices are actually costing lives. At one point, Moore says that if Jesus comes back, he will say, ""Sorry, I can not heal your pre-existing condition.""  The film takes us to current times, showing how government financial deregulation created the current financial catastrophe, and how this situation let us to September 15, 2008, when the meltdown of our financial system occurred. Moore also connects these problems to all the Goldman-Sachs executives that have had influence in the White house. But Moore also gives hope, providing us with examples of people fighting back, like the companies in which the employees are the owners, and how people can affect Washington lawmakers with their votes.""Capitalism: A Love Story"" hits you in the gut. There is a lot of information here to think about, and to maybe take action. This is what Michael Moore asks, and this is really all we can do. The DVD is loaded with extras, such as ""The Omnivore's Dilemma? It's Capitalism,"" ""How to run the place where you work,"" ""NY Times Pulitzer Prize Winner Chris Hedges on the Killing Machine Known as Capitalism,"" ""The Banks Kick them Out, Max kicks them back in,"" and much, much more.

They are moderately interesting and you do feel bad for the victims. But as an indictment of the entire capitalist system they fall far short. I think some sharper editing could have produced a tighter and more effective filmThe second half picks up steam as Moore discusses the bank bailout, unions and the way that Reagan and both Bushes managed to ""rig the game"" in favor of the wealthy and powerful. He does attempt to offer a vision of a more just and equitable America, particularly in his discussion of FDR's ""Second Bill Of Rights""(which was never passed by Congress).

I think it's a good thing that the left has an agitator that goes around making lots of noise and raising a fuss, and it helps that he is pretty entertaining. It doesn't help that he often gets in the way of his own message.To an extent he gets in the way in this movie, which starts off well and has an incredibly powerful message. We see families being made homeless because of a combination of their greed and naivete abetted by lenders who went out of their way to cover-up possible fees and problems with the loans. We also see Wall Street people at a loss to explain credit default swaps, and see government people talking about how horribly run the bailouts were (which, to be fair, do seem to have largely prevented the economy from totally dying). We also see a worker's uprising at Republic Windows and Doors (and, oddly, don't see anything of Blagojevich's appearance at said uprising), and generally we get a message that, ""these rich people will screw you and will keep screwing you until you force them to stop.""This is a good, valid and powerful message, as well as being 100% accurate. They have the money, but we have the vote and can put a stop to this nonsense any time we choose. We just have to choose to do so.We also hear about other countries, most notably Germany and Japan, where the workers and government control a great deal of what business does. These are countries that have routinely beat us in the marketplace and do so while having a great many more restrictions on them than companies here do.But where the movie fails is towards the end, when Moore feels the need to do one of the cute little stunts his movies are so famous for. In ""Sicko"" he took 9/11 rescue workers to get medical care in Cuba. In this movie he goes to Wall Street and plays ""innocent schlub number 114"", as he tries to get money back from the investment banks and puts crime scene tape all over the place.This adds an extra fifteen minutes or so to the movie and really doesn't serve much of a purpose. It also gets in the way of the central message of the film.Moore is right that unfettered capitalism is a horribly evil system, and one that we're totally in love with as a concept. We go out of our way to remove regulations as much as possible and then act surprised when bad things happen. Capitalism is a great, wonderful system when it's very, VERY heavily regulated. With that regulation you get the economies of places like Germany and Japan. Without it, you get what we've had for the last couple years.A final note: over the end credits we have a lounge version of ""The Internationale"".

1315827,A24F1UX8ZT5IXY,B0030Y11O2,C.J. Hustwick,"[5, 8]","First of all, I do not believe that America has a ""love affair"" with Capitalism. We have a volatile, love-hate relationship with it. Capitalism has been the engine that has driven America's unprecedented global superpower status, and enabled millions of people to thrive in this country. It is, however, highly imperfect and susceptible to gross abuse without stringent regulation. So I'm about 40% in agreement with Michael Moore. However, I do not believe in the oversimplification that capitalism ceaselessly ""robs"" from people, more that left unchecked, it can abuse the hell out of the little guy and fatten the wallets of the elite -- as had happened here for the past few decades.Moore once again proves that he is a talented, sensationalist filmmaker, utilizing an impressive array of footage to make a points of varying veracity and potency.  Is our culture in the gutter? Yes. Are bankers more often than not evil predators? I would say so. Does Moore provide a wildly uneven and unfocused, at times brilliant but at times utterly facile spectacle of faux-journalism? I think you know the answer. But this time around, his subject is so heinous, the villains so vile, that it works better than usual.""Capitalism: A Love Story"" begins with a chilling comparison of the decline and fall of Rome and the United States in the 21st Century. I'd say it's highly accurate. He moves on to describing the collapse of the middle class, a solid and damning summation of Reaganomics. It's backed up by solid data, graphs, and should leave very few wondering as to the reasons behind Reagan's idolatry by the far right.The film then enters its most compelling section -- where Moore assembles a gallery of some of the most heinous examples of how Capitalism is destroying the America we love. From a ""Clockwork Orange"" private correctional facility, to the deplorable state our airline pilots find themselves in, to the single most horrifying revelation of the film: the practice by Blue Chip corporations betting on the very mortality of its employees to gain equity. It is sick and twisted, where we begin to enter into some truly disturbing ramifications of the unbridled free market.From there, it's on to Christianity. There are some interesting arguments to made here as well, about Jesus being much more of a socialist than Reaganomicist. Moore interviews a number of church elders who are willing to go on camera and denounce capitalism, but unfortunately does not get anybody like Rick Warren to defend the validity of the wealthy, prosperous Christian life. This is an issue up for huge debate and is not cut & dry. Oversimplification abounds and he started losing me.We circle back then to the macroeconomic realm, focusing on Greenspan, Paulson, Geithner, Bush -- the whole enchilada of the financial meltdown of '08. Moore covers a lot of what we already know, rightfully lambasting lawmakers and elected officials for being wholly complicit and derelict in their duties. I knew this already, but of course this has the extra Moore touch of calling it a financial ""coup d'etat"" and all the rest. He makes many good points, but seems at a loss to even acknowledge the potential systemic failure of the system, the need to shore up the markets, or to give credence to any of Ben Bernanke's very compelling reasoning. In fact, Bernanke is barely mentioned. It's cherry-picked, shallow, and superficial. Michael Moore even has a hard time understanding what a basic stock option is. Come on. I'd rather listen to Eliot Spitzer on the subject any day.And as many people have pointed out, individuals do have the right NOT to buy a mortgage that they cannot afford. Let's get some balance here. I utterly dismiss these ""Roger & Me"" portions of the film.The final thesis? That Capitalism is society run amuck, that it is evil, and that it must be replaced by ""Democracy"".  Michael, you're not fooling anyone -- you want socialism and it's okay to say it. I firmly believe we can have a hybrid system that retains the profit motive, free enterprise, yet gives to the working class of this country more safeguards for their prosperity -- as was envisioned by FDR. But I doubt Roosevelt ever would have said that Capitalism is ""inherently evil, and you cannot regulate evil."" Even if you grant the first portion of that statement, you have to disagree with the second. We regulate evil all the time -- it's how the world does not fall into chaos. The real problem comes when you attempt to fashion wholly unrealistic socialist or communist utopias and deny that it is man himself that is capable of evil under any system of economics or government. The irony which utterly escapes Moore is that Capitalism at least regulates this propensity, when properly implemented and regulated: read Adam Smith.  We've just had a bunch of pigs at the trough.",3,"Capitalism is not inherently evil, but greed is.",1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,4846,"['First', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'America', 'love', 'affair', 'Capitalism', 'have', 'volatile', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'Capitalism', 'been', 'engine', 'driven', 'America', 'unprecedented', 'global', 'superpower', 'status', 'enabled', 'millions', 'people', 'thrive', 'country', 'however', 'highly', 'imperfect', 'susceptible', 'gross', 'abuse', 'stringent', 'regulation', ""'m"", '40', '%', 'agreement', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'oversimplification', 'capitalism', 'ceaselessly', 'robs', 'people', 'more', 'left', 'unchecked', 'can', 'abuse', 'hell', 'little', 'guy', 'fatten', 'wallets', 'elite', 'had', 'happened', 'here', 'past', 'few', 'decades.Moore', 'once', 'again', 'talented', 'sensationalist', 'filmmaker', 'utilizing', 'impressive', 'array', 'footage', 'make', 'points', 'varying', 'veracity', 'potency', 'culture', 'gutter', 'Yes', 'Are', 'bankers', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'evil', 'predators', 'would', 'say', 'so', 'Does', 'Moore', 'provide', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'unfocused', 'times', 'brilliant', 'times', 'utterly', 'facile', 'spectacle', 'faux-journalism', 'think', 'know', 'answer', 'time', 'around', 'subject', 'so', 'heinous', 'villains', 'so', 'vile', 'better', 'usual', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'chilling', 'comparison', 'decline', 'fall', 'Rome', 'United', 'States', '21st', 'Century', ""'d"", 'say', 'highly', 'accurate', 'describing', 'collapse', 'middle', 'class', 'solid', 'damning', 'summation', 'Reaganomics', 'backed', 'up', 'solid', 'data', 'graphs', 'should', 'leave', 'very', 'few', 'wondering', 'reasons', 'Reagan', 'idolatry', 'far', 'right.The', 'film', 'then', 'most', 'compelling', 'section', 'where', 'Moore', 'gallery', 'most', 'heinous', 'examples', 'how', 'Capitalism', 'destroying', 'America', 'love', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'private', 'correctional', 'facility', 'deplorable', 'state', 'airline', 'pilots', 'find', 'single', 'most', 'horrifying', 'revelation', 'film', 'practice', 'Blue', 'Chip', 'corporations', 'betting', 'very', 'mortality', 'employees', 'gain', 'equity', 'sick', 'twisted', 'where', 'begin', 'enter', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'ramifications', 'unbridled', 'free', 'market.From', 'there', 'Christianity', 'are', 'interesting', 'arguments', 'made', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Jesus', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'socialist', 'Reaganomicist', 'Moore', 'number', 'church', 'elders', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'camera', 'denounce', 'capitalism', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'get', 'anybody', 'Rick', 'Warren', 'defend', 'validity', 'wealthy', 'prosperous', 'Christian', 'life', 'issue', 'up', 'huge', 'debate', 'not', 'cut', 'dry', 'Oversimplification', 'started', 'losing', 'me.We', 'circle', 'back', 'then', 'macroeconomic', 'realm', 'focusing', 'Greenspan', 'Paulson', 'Geithner', 'Bush', 'whole', 'enchilada', 'financial', 'meltdown', ""'08"", 'Moore', 'lot', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'rightfully', 'lambasting', 'lawmakers', 'elected', 'officials', 'being', 'wholly', 'complicit', 'derelict', 'duties', 'knew', 'already', 'course', 'extra', 'Moore', 'touch', 'calling', 'financial', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'rest', 'many', 'good', 'points', 'loss', 'even', 'acknowledge', 'potential', 'systemic', 'failure', 'system', 'need', 'shore', 'up', 'markets', 'give', 'credence', 'Ben', 'Bernanke', 'very', 'compelling', 'reasoning', 'fact', 'Bernanke', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'cherry-picked', 'shallow', 'superficial', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'even', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'basic', 'stock', 'option', 'Come', ""'d"", 'rather', 'listen', 'Eliot', 'Spitzer', 'subject', 'day.And', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'individuals', 'do', 'have', 'right', 'NOT', 'buy', 'mortgage', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'Let', 'get', 'balance', 'here', 'utterly', 'dismiss', 'Roger', 'Me', 'portions', 'film.The', 'final', 'thesis', 'Capitalism', 'society', 'run', 'amuck', 'evil', 'must', 'be', 'replaced', 'Democracy', 'Michael', ""'re"", 'not', 'fooling', 'anyone', 'want', 'socialism', 'okay', 'say', 'firmly', 'believe', 'can', 'have', 'hybrid', 'system', 'profit', 'motive', 'free', 'enterprise', 'yet', 'working', 'class', 'country', 'more', 'safeguards', 'prosperity', 'was', 'envisioned', 'FDR', 'doubt', 'Roosevelt', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'Capitalism', 'inherently', 'evil', 'can', 'not', 'regulate', 'evil', 'Even', 'grant', 'first', 'portion', 'statement', 'have', 'disagree', 'second', 'regulate', 'evil', 'time', 'how', 'world', 'not', 'fall', 'chaos', 'real', 'problem', 'when', 'attempt', 'fashion', 'wholly', 'unrealistic', 'socialist', 'communist', 'utopias', 'deny', 'man', 'capable', 'evil', 'system', 'economics', 'government', 'irony', 'utterly', 'Moore', 'Capitalism', 'least', 'regulates', 'propensity', 'when', 'properly', 'implemented', 'regulated', 'read', 'Adam', 'Smith', ""'ve"", 'just', 'had', 'bunch', 'pigs', 'trough']",N/A

It is a scathing indictment of how our increasingly flawed Capitalist system is often used to line the pockets of special interests (including large banks), and how real Americans suffer as a by-product of this.  Lobbyists and special interests have hijacked Washington, and whored themselves to large corporations, and the twin political parties of Capitalism have blurred the lines and differences between them.  It seems that true Democracy is dying in America, and that it doesn't matter whether one votes for 'tweedledee' or 'tweedledum' (Repubs or Dems).  The rich are getting richer, job security (if you have a job to begin with) has fallen by the wayside, and our unsustainable healthcare system is derailing, with millions precluded from getting the care they need.

1315831,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B0030Y11O2,Craig Whittle,"[5, 11]","CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORYSTARRING: Michael Moron... I mean MooreWRITTEN BY: Michael MooreDIRECTED BY: Michael MooreRated: RGenre: DocumentaryRelease Date: 02 October 2009There is perhaps nothing that helps sustain the value of your own personal opinion more, than hearing an opposing one; or better yet an ignorant opposing one. This was exactly the case for me, after watching my first Michael Moore film ever; Capitalism: A Love Story.I very much love the saying `keep your friends close and your enemies closer.' I'm not saying Moore is my enemy, but as we have vastly different views from one another, I will from here-out see all of his films. I enjoy learning and understanding the opposing side's opinion in any conflict every bit as much as I do hearing others that share the same beliefs as me.I thought this film was decent as a documentary, but that does not mean that I agreed with Moore's ridiculous message. He's a brilliant filmmaker, and he goes to great lengths to get his point across and puts a lot of time and effort into his project. I respect that. There are far too many people that complain about an issue to the point of mental and physical exhaustion, and yet do nothing about it. At least Moore is making movies with hopes of evoking a change. Even if you don't agree with him, you can still appreciate his passion to be heard and at times his intentions seem to come from a good place.Michael Moore is a funny and somewhat intelligent guy. I particularly liked the joke he made in reference to the receding hair line of a rich executive. His film was well narrated with interesting and innovative dialogue voiced by Moore himself. It was also filled with probably the most impressive collection of archive footage I have ever seen. It was not a cheap film to make in the least bit. Which the thought of, led me to some pretty interesting discoveries about him on google.I don't like that Moore wants to change America, but I do like that the reason (he claims) for wanting to, is for the benefit of others; not himself. Personal benefit is Moore's biggest objection to capitalism and I can see why. Where his film fails to sell his objection to me, are in two huge conflicts with the film itself. The first of which being what I mentioned in the previous paragraph, in regards to my google discoveries; they completely contradict his self righteous claims. Moore is a huge capitalist himself!According to google, he lives in a million-dollar apartment in New York and keeps another million-dollar beachfront house in Michigan for vacations. Oh, and he sends his child to a private school! Here are a couple fun quotes from Moore, ""I'm a millionaire, I'm a multi-millionaire. I'm filthy rich. You know why I'm a multi-millionaire? `Cause multi-millions like what I do. That's pretty good, isn't it?"" And there is also, ""I'm a hypocrite. I admit it. I'm not 100% consistent."" - all on google.The second gaping flaw in Moore's philosophy of capitalism is found in his interpretation of the word. Along with several others interviewed by Moore in the documentary, he believes that capitalism is evil, wrong and should be eliminated from our country's lifestyle.At one point, a man being interviewed actually believed and tried to convince us that capitalism is unjust in an ice cream scenario. He basically said that if one man is selling ice cream, and a man in competition with him is also selling ice cream, and if that second man's ice cream happens to be better that the first guy's - then the first guy will go out of business. Well no kidding! What are we supposed to buy a bad product from someone just to keep them in business? Give me a break! Where is the logic in this thinking?Capitalism is not evil or wrong. Much like many other things in life, its taken advantage of by evil and or selfish people. Saying that capitalism is evil and wrong, is no different than saying the same thing about our traffic laws. People speed and run red lights in this country everyday, causing death and serious bodily harm to others. Does this mean we need to eliminate traffic laws because certain individuals choose to disobey them? Of course not. Or you can take it a step further and say that Catholicism is evil and wrong because priests have taken advantage of the sacred trust the religion has granted them, by molesting children who confide in them. Just because there are individuals who screw it up for everyone else, does not mean that it's the system that's flawed.Despite what Moore believes or depicts in his film, capitalism is one of the things our great nation was founded on, and is one of many freedoms that make it the best country on the planet. Let's take a trip back to high school for a moment, and I'll refresh you with the word's definition according to [...]: Capitalism - an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.Should the rich give to the poor? Yes. But should they be forced to? No; that would be socialism. Is our country perfect? No; but what country is? And we are still the best. I've said it more than once already, but I'll say it again - we are the best! Would it be nice if everyone had healthcare across the nation? Absolutely. But where are all of these trillions of dollars going to come from? And should we force Americans to have healthcare when the vast majority are against this plan? Should we threaten them with jail time if they fail to adhere to the government policy regarding healthcare? No; this is called communism. The government has more than enough control, as it is.One topic Moore takes the time to point out in the film is that airline pilots make less than $20,000 a year. Um, I thought this sounded absurd, and it is absurd. Go ahead and google what pilots make. While some may start out at a low wage, the majority are sittin' pretty to say the least. Moore is a liar. None of the things he depicts in this film are backed up by any substantial evidence other than his word, and sarcastic voice-over. He's a child with a giant microphone, and a lot of idiots are holding onto his every word as if it were the word of Christ and its scary.At one point, Moore actually tires to justify a pilot killing a plane full of people in an accidental crash-landing, because he was stressed out due to his low wage, thus being unable to focus. What? So are people working at fast food chains supposed to be let off the hook if they kill hundreds of people via food poisoning due to their pitiful hourly wages? No! No one is forcing them, or the pilots for that matter, into this line of work. This is America; the land of opportunity for God's sake! Come on Moore!Rather than focus on the facts, Moore is pre-determined with shoving propaganda down our throats. The root-word of documentary is document right? Thought so. Watch how he refers to Germany and Japan in reference to World War II. Where was he going with this?  Did he forget Pearl Harbor? The Holocaust? Much like ignorant people who live in a country, but fly the flag of another country and parade it around downtown, slamming the country they currently reside in; Moore is equally offensively moronic. If these other countries are so great - why don't these people live there? Hello?However, as upsetting as these people make proud Americans, in a strange way it's a beautiful compliment to our nation; because it is more than fair that Moore and his league of morons can deface her. It's their God given right to express their opinions, as is it for Moore to make this film.This is America after all, and we are the good guys. In one of several other countries that he has yet to move to after bashing his own, Moore would have been slaughtered for what he's done here.

1315832,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B0030Y11O2,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[8, 9]","Controversial documentarian Michael Moore has taken on some important news topics over the past two decades but perhaps none has affected every American more than the financial meltdown of Wall Street in 2008 as depicted in Capitalism: A Love Story.  Done in his customary style of news clips, interviews, and enactments, he has fashioned a convincing indictment of greedy bank executives while being engaging and at times enlightening.He points out a startling fact: We used to be one income family, Wall Street and corporate profits were guided by sound principles, and our country had no business competition.  It's a kind of history lesson courtesy of Moore as he also notes parallels between the demise of Wall Street and that of the Roman Empire, a comparison not without merit.His thesis is that since President Ronald Reagan came into office, the influence of Wall Street has increased to the point that, while Congress and the U.S. Treasury have promoted financial deregulation, many of them have direct links to financial giants such as Goldman Sachs.  It would seem on surface to be a major conflict of interest, and that is the point.  A handful of CEO's have benefited from running the country as a corporation and costing millions of jobs and livelihoods.Moore ties news stories to an increasing pattern of corporate greed.  There is a juvenile facility in Pennsylvania financed by taxpayer money and corrupt public officials.  There are college students beholden to banks with student loans, and we witness news reports of a recent plane crash in Buffalo, New York, for what appears to be the lack of funds for safety issues.  Then there is the surprising practice of businesses like Wal-Mart that take out life insurance policies on its employees and collecting on the benefits.  By contrast, he does show examples of companies owned by workers that operate efficiently and at a profit.  His point is there can be win-win situations.As Wall Street sold `derivatives', a risky form of corporate gambling, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that Americans tap the equity in their homes, and thus came the refinance boom for banks and a new found wealth for the masses-or was it?  Using a home like a bank was a formula for financial disaster as the housing industry collapsed with foreclosures and the banking industry fell too.  Moore makes his point with footage of actual foreclosures as sheriffs evict homeowners, and the cruelty is not only losing a home but in the cottage industry that has taken advantage of this agonizing process.  Added to this is the preferential treatment that CEO's gave to each other and many lawmakers regarding mortgage approvals.  The question that keeps being asked by Moore and others is `where were the regulators' in all this?As Congress debated on how to repair the economy with a bailout of as much as $700 billion of taxpayer money, Wall Street used media abetted fear to manipulate lawmakers.  It was a politics of fear.  But not everyone was buying into the fear.  Some members of Congress were brave enough to tell a sobering tale of a lack of oversight versus corporate bonuses being fed by the bailout.Moore shows that some people are fighting back.  A new President (Obama) ushers in the potential for change.  People are fighting foreclosures and forcing banks to prove chain of title.  The laid off workers at Republic Doors refused to exit the factory, and with media coverage and a supportive President, Bank of America caves in and agrees to pay the workers what is owed to them.  This event is not without precedent as Moore points out in 1936, workers at a GM Flint, Michigan plant also fought back.  In an ironic, fascinating piece of history of what might have been, President Franklin Roosevelt proposed but never lived to see a second Bill of Rights which would address virtually every important concern for Americans including health care, education, and financial security.Then Moore makes this observation based on a private corporate memo that says 1% of the population in this country has 95% of the wealth but that the other 99% have an equal vote and the power to make changes (yet still hope to be part of the rich).  It is this equal vote that scares the corporate powers.  His conclusion is that the only hope for this country is for democracy to work.Some things don't come off well in the film; Moore appears to be grandstanding when he rents an armored car to make a citizen's arrest of the CEOs of Wall Street and get back the public's money.  He even takes crime scene tape to cordon off bank doors.  Also, an interview with actor Wallace Shawn seems a bit out of place. Wouldn't an interview with an industry insider have worked better?  You may not agree with everything Moore espouses, but some of the information should cause anyone to research the facts and draw their own conclusions.  If you are a fan of his previous films Sicko or Fahrenheit 9/11, then you will appreciate Capitalism: A Love Story.",4,CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY and the Politics of Fear,1258156800,"11 14,

While Moore has had a sharper focus in his other films -- gun control, the Bush administration, the plight of laid-off autoworkers -- this film looks at the big picture.Let's be frank. If you're right of center, you're not going to like this movie. Moore is left wing all the way, and that's fine with me. He stacks the deck in his films (and this one is no exception), but not unfairly. You're seeing the unadulterated truth about capitalism here, and it sure isn't pretty. There are winners and there are losers -- lots of them -- and this film consists primarily of their stories. I have to confess that it makes me feel guilty to own holdings in some of the companies that are rightfully chastised here, and I did make some changes in my portfolio as a result. So I guess Moore is having some effect, with me anyway.There are oodles of extras. so if you've already seen the film, there's still a good reason to buy the DVD.

1315835,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B0030Y11O2,Dave,"[26, 63]","I have seen other Michael Moore films that subvert the truth to support his opinion.  He is a most dishonest man making very dishonest movies.  In this movie, capitalism is a name of a system that causes unfair things to happen to people.  These unfair things are not a result of capitalism but rather because life in general is not fair.  Capitalism is a method of allocating resources based upon their best economic value and return.  Another way of saying this is that capitalism places money where it is most efficiently and beneficially used.  It is not perfect because nature is not perfect, nor is man.  Capitalism and its market based system of resource allocation is indifferent to whether an individual is wealthy or poor.  It is economically blind as it relates to you or me.  However, capitalism, as a free market system, does need to be regulated to assure that it is generally performing reasonably well as a system.  Our capitalist system requires continued monitoring to assure its viability.  Without regulation it does not work in everyone's best interest and with over-regulation, the same unfavorable result can occur.All societies require laws to protect one person from another.  Such laws are generally very clear when they deal with physical harms caused by a person to another.  But our laws are not clear when dealing with economic equality because they cannot alter the charater or talents of an individual when compared to another.  Some people are going to be richer and some poorer.  There is no way to guarantee equality, nor should there be, unless we will be satisfied with no competition, no growth, no new ideas, no technolgical advancement or no improvements in medical care, among many other advancements that are caused by people who are smarter or work harder than others.  Our tax laws compensate substantially for economic differences among people and their ability or willingness to improve our overall well being, but there can never be an assurance of economic equality so long as one person is smarter or works harder than another.  Our tax laws actually limit the proclivity of such virtues.  It seems that Michael Moore would like to criminalize differences among people.  How can you say to a young person that he or she better not be too smart or work too hard becaused it may result in another person having less, or feeling inferior to you.  Mr. Moore's films are very critical but never suggest answers to what he says are problems.  If you are critical but have no alternatives to offer, then you are part of the problem.What Michael Moore is suggesting is that our system is bad because it does not confer the same level of economic security to all people.  I do not know how much Mr. Moore makes from his films taking advantage of our inequality, but I suspect his message of inequality does not apply to him.  Mr. Moore makes his money by making others disatisfied with their lives and gives them an excuse to be disatisfied.  For this, I believe his film making does a tremendous disservice to our society.  If I had to choose a word to describe him, it would be ""liar"" for not telling the whole truth.  His films are lies for the same reason.",1,This film has nothing to say about capitalism,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,3200,"['have', 'seen', 'other', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'subvert', 'truth', 'support', 'opinion', 'most', 'dishonest', 'man', 'making', 'very', 'dishonest', 'movies', 'movie', 'capitalism', 'name', 'system', 'unfair', 'things', 'happen', 'people', 'unfair', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'result', 'capitalism', 'rather', 'life', 'general', 'not', 'fair', 'Capitalism', 'method', 'allocating', 'resources', 'based', 'best', 'economic', 'value', 'return', 'way', 'saying', 'capitalism', 'places', 'money', 'where', 'most', 'efficiently', 'beneficially', 'used', 'not', 'perfect', 'nature', 'not', 'perfect', 'man', 'Capitalism', 'market', 'based', 'system', 'resource', 'allocation', 'indifferent', 'individual', 'wealthy', 'poor', 'economically', 'blind', 'However', 'capitalism', 'free', 'market', 'system', 'need', 'be', 'regulated', 'assure', 'generally', 'performing', 'reasonably', 'well', 'system', 'capitalist', 'system', 'continued', 'monitoring', 'assure', 'viability', 'regulation', 'not', 'work', 'everyone', 'best', 'interest', 'over-regulation', 'same', 'unfavorable', 'result', 'can', 'occur.All', 'societies', 'require', 'laws', 'protect', 'one', 'person', 'Such', 'laws', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'clear', 'when', 'deal', 'physical', 'harms', 'caused', 'person', 'laws', 'are', 'not', 'clear', 'when', 'dealing', 'economic', 'equality', 'can', 'not', 'alter', 'charater', 'talents', 'individual', 'when', 'compared', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'richer', 'poorer', 'way', 'guarantee', 'equality', 'should', 'there', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'competition', 'growth', 'new', 'ideas', 'technolgical', 'advancement', 'improvements', 'medical', 'care', 'many', 'other', 'advancements', 'are', 'caused', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'smarter', 'work', 'harder', 'others', 'tax', 'laws', 'compensate', 'substantially', 'economic', 'differences', 'people', 'ability', 'willingness', 'improve', 'overall', 'well', 'being', 'there', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'assurance', 'economic', 'equality', 'so', 'long', 'one', 'person', 'smarter', 'harder', 'tax', 'laws', 'actually', 'limit', 'proclivity', 'such', 'virtues', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'would', 'like', 'criminalize', 'differences', 'people', 'How', 'can', 'say', 'young', 'person', 'better', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'smart', 'work', 'too', 'hard', 'becaused', 'may', 'result', 'person', 'having', 'less', 'feeling', 'inferior', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'critical', 'never', 'suggest', 'answers', 'what', 'are', 'problems', 'are', 'critical', 'have', 'alternatives', 'offer', 'then', 'are', 'part', 'problem.What', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'suggesting', 'system', 'bad', 'not', 'confer', 'same', 'level', 'economic', 'security', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'films', 'taking', 'advantage', 'inequality', 'suspect', 'message', 'inequality', 'not', 'apply', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'money', 'making', 'others', 'disatisfied', 'lives', 'excuse', 'be', 'disatisfied', 'believe', 'film', 'making', 'tremendous', 'disservice', 'society', 'had', 'choose', 'word', 'describe', 'would', 'be', 'liar', 'not', 'telling', 'whole', 'truth', 'films', 'are', 'same', 'reason']",N/A

He shows us images of people being kicked out of their homes that the bank has foreclosed on.  Very emotional, yet we are given very little detail as to what circumstances led to these individuals losing their home. The banks were wrong for issuing home loans to unqualified borrowers, however equal blame must be assessed to the people that signed the contract for a loan on a house they obviously couldn't afford and a federal government that guaranteed these loans in the guise of ""Everyone has the right to own a home"".Newsflash: You do not have the right to own a home if you can't afford it.He rightfully demonstrates examples of low life individuals who take advantage of the system.  One such example shows 2 judges that were taking money from a private company that actually runs the local junvenille hall.  The ""incarceration rate"" went up as a result of this, even for relatively minor offenses.  Yes this is disgusting, however how is the representative of all capitalism?And so it is with this ""documentary"".  Moore shows us one off examples of obvious greed and complete disregard for humanity and then expects us to conclude that these examples are the norm for all capitalists.  His solution?  We should switch to the European socialist model.  Yes that will solve everything.  Because Europe is doing so well with this system, well except for Greece and Spain, but don't worry yourself with those countries, it's just a temporary glitch until the TRUE socialism can take root.Finally his display of Obama winning the election as some sort of populist victory is laughable at best.

Are we in for a civilizational clash between ""capitalist"" special-interest dollars buying pioliticans' votes, versus ""democracy's"" populist one-person-one-vote?

1315846,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0030Y11O2,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","Yes, you read the review title rightly. After taking a few classes at my local college for fun, I was forced to drop them due to deaths in my family. And oh, yes ... also, I had been stricken with my 3rd multiple sclerosis attack in two years. I was there on a federal Pell Grant. Crazed, I called my senator and my representative. Each office responded, ""How the heck can you default on a grant?""Next thing I knew, the Department of Education was demanding ""repayment"" (LIE) on ""the defaulted loan"" (SUPER-LIE) ""because a grant becomes a loan after a certain period"" (PANTS-ON-FIRE). Refusing to pay, I was 'on the lam' for nearly 8 years. For $229.00. In the end, it was Bush the Tyrant and his $300 tax hand-out that saved me. What the Lord Government Giveth, the Lord Government Taketh Away.Stupid and self-serving, I know, but I sadly thought of that 8-year nightmare when I saw CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY. Moore's expose may be uneven and a bit too irreverent instead of being more educational...but it resonates and I think students should watch this carefully. Especially students at school on grants.What had been a personal ""closed-off experience"" turns out to be our whole country's problem, and I have published this in other places before: our problem is the greed of the rich.Moore exposes this with his usual facility, and as he says at the end of the film, he is tired of fighting it alone--he looks rather tired, and seems sapped of his usual verve. I do not blame him, for at certain points in this film Moore seems on the verge of...something. Tears? Tantrum? I still don't know, but I was with him all the way.Like Rep. Bernie Saunders clearly states about himself in Moore's interview, I too am a Social Democrat, though I am ashamed right now to say I'm anything. Reagan, of course, was the president who started all this domestic terrorism on the average person; Clinton did not shirk from his duties toward the rich; Baby Bush as we know wrecked this nation with a savagery that has yet to be matched. If I have any beef with this film, it is the clear stumping for President-Obama-as-Savior.I don't know that he will save all that much, let alone the entire nation. Hell, FDR couldn't do it, and he is the prez who sent the National Guard to protect some striking employees against the business owners.Still I must strongly recommend this excellent documentary to all and sundry. You don't need to be a socialist. You don't need to abandon false dreams of capitalism: just make them happen better, make them true, not false. Moore says ""we must replace capitalism with democracy."" What he means is we must make capitalism much more democratic...the work must be there, and the workplace, all democratic instead of tyrannical.Moore failed to point out that, rather than face the wrath of the American poor, businesses kept moving jobs and production overseas at record paces. What shocked me most horribly is the plutocratic mentality in government and finance; they have even christened themselves the aristocracy, calling all others ""peasants"".FDR's proposal of a Second Bill of Rights, promising opportunity, work, health care, education, everything good for everyone equally, was drowned in WWII. No one has had the cojones to resurrect FDR's biggest, most beautiful plan. Instead we totter on the brink of a disaster similar to the one FDR faced right before WWII.Today with the economy in some sort of horrid purgatory in which the poor are tormented while the rich wait it out, in which companies take secret life insurance policies out on their employees (called ""Dead Peasant"" policies payable to the employer), in which people lose their homes because they've been conned by the banks....what was I saying?? Oh yes: Hurricane Katrina. Who did she leave hurting the most? Think about that.Moore could do with a little less religion in the film. In such cases, I admire the moral reach, but Moore doesn't have the right to make that reach here. He's supposed to be discussing our ruined capitalism, not what Jesus would think of it. And frankly I don't care what the religions think about capitalism! Catholic priests denouncing capitalism! Soldiers and defenders of the richest and most abusive religion on earth!Moore's best moments are the interviews with the common folk, those victimized masses who speak volumes with their tears and cries of despair. He is also at his best when he's filming the power of the people, because as he says, the government and big banks are scared to death of the people.Watch and learn.

1315850,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B0030Y11O2,Erik North,"[5, 6]","Throughout his entire career as both an author of very left-leaning missives and a writer/director of subversive documentaries, Michael Moore has been a friend to many, and an enemy to just as many.  Whether it was with ROGER AND ME, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, or SICKO, Moore has shown that he has the power to enlighten or enrage.  And the same holds true for his latest missive, CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY.In CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, he goes a step further by putting the argument out there that our system of Capitalism is intrinsically evil.  If he is at all wrong in his assumption, the huge financial storms that rocked both America and the world at large in 2007 and 2008 prove that it isn't by much.  And he offers mountains of evidence to prove his point: a family loses a Peoria, Illinois farmhouse that has been in their possession for forty years due to unforeseen financial circumstances; workers at a Chicago construction firm are out of a job because Bank of America has foreclosed on them.  And this is really the tip of the iceberg.  During the 128 minute running time of CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY, Moore dissects how that economic concept that has held America's economy in place for so long got out of control, and how the warnings about greed overtaking the system were ignored for the love of money, thanks to the ascension of Ronald Reagan to the presidency, and the beginnings of a trend where there was collusion between our elected representatives and big, faceless, indifferent mega-corporations.  Regulatory rules were tossed out the window in the belief, swallowed whole by the American people during the Reagan and Bush Sr. eras, that wealth would trickle down from the top, a theory known then, as now, as ""trickle down economics.""  Of course, we know now, all too late it would seem, that this was largely smoke and mirrors, for while the richest 5% of Americans got wildly inappropriate tax cuts or tax breaks, the poor and middle class got The Shaft.In a unique twist, Moore, left-leaning though he is, even goes to expose the people within the Clinton Administration who either worked in the Wall Street world either prior to coming into, or after leaving, his administration.  This is more fair-and-balanced than one might anticipate from Moore, and far superior that anything that Fox News could ever conjure up on a good day.But Moore, good as he is at raising the ire of Americans through his traditional populist rage, also shows us how people can get together and make it very difficult for the corporations to do business in the predatory way that they had been doing it for three decades.  The employees of the Chicago construction firm decide to barricade themselves in their place of employment until Bank of America caves in, which is what happens.  Displaced residents of a foreclosed home in Miami call the bluffs of both the foreclosure agent and their own police department; they too win.  And with all the hoopla that was thrown about by the McCain/Palin GOP presidential ticket and the backwater idiot named Joe The Plumber about how much Barack Obama was somehow a socialist, it shows how the American people at large won, by declaring that they wanted the era of unbridled greed to come to a permanent end, and declaring it where it does the most good--at the Ballot Box.There are, of course, the usual publicity gags that Moore performs to make his points, the very ones that make him the Right's favorite whipping boy: confronting security guards at the most corrupt mega-banks by driving up to their corporate offices in a Brink's armored truck; surrounding the A.I.G. building in New York City with yellow crime scene tape.  But the points he makes are serious, and worthy of consideration.  The plain truth of the matter is that, under a government-and-business collusion, capitalism in America has gone so far off the rails and cost what was once the richest and most powerful nation in history its prestige, and cost millions of hard-working Americans their jobs, and even their lives.I don't know that Capitalism should be dismantled altogether, nor do I think it can be, at least not so easily as Moore suggests.  But without resurrecting regulations that protect average people in the future from the kinds of predatory loan practices that caused the near-collapse of our economy, Capitalism may yet have to be put on the ash heap of history.",5,Economic Armageddon Through The Eyes Of Michael Moore,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,4417,"['entire', 'career', 'author', 'very', 'left-leaning', 'missives', 'writer/director', 'subversive', 'documentaries', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'been', 'friend', 'many', 'enemy', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'was', 'ROGER', 'AND', 'ME', 'BOWLING', 'FOR', 'COLUMBINE', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'SICKO', 'Moore', 'shown', 'power', 'enlighten', 'enrage', 'same', 'true', 'latest', 'missive', 'CAPITALISM', 'LOVE', 'STORY.In', 'CAPITALISM', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'step', 'further', 'putting', 'argument', 'there', 'system', 'Capitalism', 'intrinsically', 'evil', 'wrong', 'assumption', 'huge', 'financial', 'storms', 'rocked', 'America', 'world', 'large', '2007', '2008', 'prove', ""n't"", 'much', 'mountains', 'evidence', 'prove', 'point', 'family', 'Peoria', 'Illinois', 'farmhouse', 'been', 'possession', 'forty', 'years', 'due', 'unforeseen', 'financial', 'circumstances', 'workers', 'Chicago', 'construction', 'firm', 'are', 'job', 'Bank', 'America', 'foreclosed', 'really', 'tip', 'iceberg', '128', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'CAPITALISM', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'Moore', 'how', 'economic', 'concept', 'held', 'America', 'economy', 'place', 'so', 'long', 'got', 'control', 'how', 'warnings', 'greed', 'overtaking', 'system', 'were', 'ignored', 'love', 'money', 'thanks', 'ascension', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'presidency', 'beginnings', 'trend', 'where', 'was', 'collusion', 'elected', 'representatives', 'big', 'faceless', 'indifferent', 'mega-corporations', 'Regulatory', 'rules', 'were', 'tossed', 'out', 'window', 'belief', 'swallowed', 'whole', 'American', 'people', 'Reagan', 'Bush', 'Sr.', 'eras', 'wealth', 'would', 'trickle', 'top', 'theory', 'known', 'then', 'now', 'trickle', 'economics', 'course', 'know', 'now', 'too', 'late', 'would', 'seem', 'was', 'largely', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'richest', '5', '%', 'Americans', 'got', 'wildly', 'inappropriate', 'tax', 'cuts', 'tax', 'breaks', 'poor', 'middle', 'class', 'got', 'Shaft.In', 'unique', 'twist', 'Moore', 'left-leaning', 'even', 'expose', 'people', 'Clinton', 'Administration', 'who', 'worked', 'Wall', 'Street', 'world', 'either', 'prior', 'coming', 'leaving', 'administration', 'more', 'fair-and-balanced', 'one', 'might', 'anticipate', 'Moore', 'far', 'superior', 'anything', 'Fox', 'News', 'could', 'ever', 'conjure', 'up', 'good', 'day.But', 'Moore', 'good', 'raising', 'ire', 'Americans', 'traditional', 'populist', 'rage', 'also', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'get', 'together', 'make', 'very', 'difficult', 'corporations', 'do', 'business', 'predatory', 'way', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'three', 'decades', 'employees', 'Chicago', 'construction', 'firm', 'decide', 'barricade', 'place', 'employment', 'Bank', 'America', 'caves', 'what', 'Displaced', 'residents', 'foreclosed', 'home', 'Miami', 'call', 'bluffs', 'foreclosure', 'agent', 'own', 'police', 'department', 'too', 'win', 'hoopla', 'was', 'thrown', 'about', 'McCain/Palin', 'GOP', 'presidential', 'ticket', 'backwater', 'idiot', 'named', 'Joe', 'Plumber', 'how', 'much', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'was', 'somehow', 'socialist', 'how', 'American', 'people', 'large', 'won', 'declaring', 'wanted', 'era', 'unbridled', 'greed', 'come', 'permanent', 'end', 'declaring', 'where', 'most', 'good', 'Ballot', 'Box.There', 'are', 'course', 'usual', 'publicity', 'gags', 'Moore', 'performs', 'make', 'points', 'very', 'ones', 'make', 'Right', 'favorite', 'whipping', 'boy', 'confronting', 'security', 'guards', 'most', 'corrupt', 'mega-banks', 'driving', 'up', 'corporate', 'offices', 'Brink', 'armored', 'truck', 'surrounding', 'A.I.G', 'building', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'yellow', 'crime', 'scene', 'tape', 'points', 'are', 'serious', 'worthy', 'consideration', 'plain', 'truth', 'matter', 'government-and-business', 'collusion', 'capitalism', 'America', 'gone', 'so', 'far', 'rails', 'cost', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'richest', 'most', 'powerful', 'nation', 'history', 'prestige', 'cost', 'millions', 'hard-working', 'Americans', 'jobs', 'even', 'lives.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Capitalism', 'should', 'be', 'dismantled', 'altogether', 'do', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'least', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'Moore', 'resurrecting', 'regulations', 'protect', 'average', 'people', 'future', 'kinds', 'predatory', 'loan', 'practices', 'caused', 'near-collapse', 'economy', 'Capitalism', 'may', 'yet', 'have', 'be', 'put', 'ash', 'heap', 'history']",N/A
1315851,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B0030Y11O2,Eugene Chamson,"[24, 33]","Once again, Michael Moore has made a film which entertains and moves us, while making us think about important issues. And he deserves praise for highlighting the perversions and inequities in our system.  Unfortunately, his scapegoating of the entire free enterprise system and his proposed solution of ""Democracy"" do not rise above the level of demagoguery.Like his other movies, ""Capitalism"" is not so much a documentary as it is a propaganda piece masquerading as a documentary.  In its zeal to make a point, the film rambles through a series of emotional anecdotes and provocative scenes.  It is at best incomplete and at worst incorrect in its analysis and conclusions.  Moore clearly knows little about what true capitalism is or should be, but it makes a convenient scapegoat for things he doesn't like in our society.While watching the film, I kept thinking of the commonly misquoted expression ""Money is the root of all evil"".  But the true quote is ""The LOVE of money is the root of all evil.""  It's a distinction that many, including Mr. Moore miss.  The thesis of this film is that Capitalism equates to Greed which leads to the repression of the poor by the rich and is therefore Evil.  But the examples the film gives us are actually the result of the corruption of the system rather than the system itself.The ideal of capitalism is not greed, but rather enlightened self-interest.  Greed is the perversion of that self-interest and it often leads to corruption.  And it is the results of that corruption that Moore rails against and that we should be justifiably angry about.  For example, it's hard to disagree with Moore that it is unconscionable that banks that receive billions in taxpayer bailouts should be foreclosing on homes that they sold toxic loans to.  But this is not the fault of capitalism, but rather the result of the system derailed through excessive corporate greed, power and government corruption.In a true capitalist system, government's role is to ensure fair competition and open markets where individuals and firms acting freely and in their own self-interest lead to results that produce the most efficient allocation of resources, or ""the greatest good for the greatest number"".  And indeed capitalist systems have produced societies with unsurpassed standards of living.  The problem is that the system tends to get corrupted, in one of two ways.In the first way, the one so well illustrated in this film, ""winners"" amass enough wealth and power to be able to control and corrupt the system designed to keep them in check.  This can lead to lead a backlash, which this film advocates, and the second type of corruption of the capitalist system, the seizing of resources from the rich and redistribution of wealth.  Moore euphemistically refers to this ""solution"" as ""Democracy"", but it is really his version of socialism.For me, the biggest irony of the film is that while the atrocities it details are not really examples of capitalism so much as it's corruption, the film itself is a wonderful example of the benefits of capitalism.  Moore, a man from humble origins, has been able to apply his talents and hard work to create a film which others choose to produce and distribute, and we choose to pay to see.  To the extent the film succeeds, the marketplace rewards Moore, giving him the resources to produce more films and distribute them more widely.  As a society we are better off as a result.  And in that sense, the film's success is the best argument against it's anti-capitalist message.",3,"One and a Half Cheers for ""Capitalism""",1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,3545,"['Once', 'again', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'made', 'film', 'making', 'think', 'important', 'issues', 'praise', 'highlighting', 'perversions', 'inequities', 'system', 'Unfortunately', 'scapegoating', 'entire', 'free', 'enterprise', 'system', 'proposed', 'solution', 'Democracy', 'do', 'not', 'rise', 'level', 'demagoguery.Like', 'other', 'movies', 'Capitalism', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'documentary', 'propaganda', 'piece', 'masquerading', 'documentary', 'zeal', 'make', 'point', 'film', 'series', 'emotional', 'anecdotes', 'provocative', 'scenes', 'best', 'incomplete', 'worst', 'incorrect', 'analysis', 'conclusions', 'Moore', 'clearly', 'little', 'what', 'true', 'capitalism', 'should', 'be', 'convenient', 'scapegoat', 'things', ""n't"", 'like', 'society.While', 'watching', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'commonly', 'misquoted', 'expression', 'Money', 'root', 'evil', 'true', 'quote', 'LOVE', 'money', 'root', 'evil', 'distinction', 'many', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Moore', 'thesis', 'film', 'Capitalism', 'Greed', 'repression', 'poor', 'rich', 'therefore', 'Evil', 'examples', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'result', 'corruption', 'system', 'rather', 'system', 'itself.The', 'ideal', 'capitalism', 'not', 'greed', 'rather', 'enlightened', 'self-interest', 'Greed', 'perversion', 'self-interest', 'often', 'corruption', 'results', 'corruption', 'Moore', 'rails', 'should', 'be', 'justifiably', 'angry', 'example', 'hard', 'disagree', 'Moore', 'unconscionable', 'banks', 'receive', 'billions', 'taxpayer', 'bailouts', 'should', 'be', 'foreclosing', 'homes', 'sold', 'toxic', 'loans', 'not', 'fault', 'capitalism', 'rather', 'result', 'system', 'derailed', 'excessive', 'corporate', 'greed', 'power', 'government', 'corruption.In', 'true', 'capitalist', 'system', 'government', 'role', 'ensure', 'fair', 'competition', 'open', 'markets', 'where', 'individuals', 'firms', 'acting', 'freely', 'own', 'self-interest', 'lead', 'results', 'produce', 'most', 'efficient', 'allocation', 'resources', 'greatest', 'good', 'greatest', 'number', 'indeed', 'capitalist', 'systems', 'have', 'produced', 'societies', 'unsurpassed', 'standards', 'living', 'problem', 'system', 'get', 'corrupted', 'one', 'two', 'first', 'way', 'one', 'so', 'well', 'illustrated', 'film', 'winners', 'amass', 'enough', 'wealth', 'power', 'be', 'able', 'control', 'corrupt', 'system', 'designed', 'keep', 'check', 'can', 'lead', 'lead', 'backlash', 'film', 'second', 'type', 'corruption', 'capitalist', 'system', 'seizing', 'resources', 'rich', 'redistribution', 'wealth', 'Moore', 'euphemistically', 'solution', 'Democracy', 'really', 'version', 'socialism.For', 'biggest', 'irony', 'film', 'atrocities', 'details', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'examples', 'capitalism', 'so', 'much', 'corruption', 'film', 'wonderful', 'example', 'benefits', 'capitalism', 'Moore', 'man', 'humble', 'origins', 'been', 'able', 'apply', 'talents', 'hard', 'work', 'create', 'film', 'others', 'choose', 'produce', 'distribute', 'choose', 'pay', 'see', 'extent', 'film', 'marketplace', 'rewards', 'Moore', 'giving', 'resources', 'produce', 'more', 'films', 'distribute', 'more', 'widely', 'society', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'result', 'sense', 'film', 'success', 'best', 'argument', 'anti-capitalist', 'message']",N/A

Through a backdoor agreement involving the president and the president-to-be, an agreement was reached to inject $700 billion of tax money in the criminal banks.In the meantime, people have lost their houses, and are still losing them, at a flabbergasting rate of every 7.5 seconds !  Moore makes an important point when showing how the middle class lived 30 to 40 years ago : one wage-earner was enough to support a whole family, own a house, have a car, take yearly vacations, have health care, could rely on a pension, etc.  This model looks from a distant past, although it was part... of our childhood !  Wages have been in steady decline since the 80's, and pensions and health care have been privatized.  In the process, the middle class is virtually ruined.Citibank calls what's left of the US democracy a ""plutonomy"".  Following their definition this is an economy ""powered by and for the benefit of the wealthy"".  Following the same memo, the top 1 % of the American households has more wealth than the bottom 95% combined.  Moore also highlights the fact that this memo considers ""the most potent and mayor threat is societies demanding a more ""equitable"" share of the wealth"".If the economic system fails and if the democracy is not working at all, then maybe it's time to go back to the essence of honest business and real democracy.  One of the solutions highlighted by Michael Moore are cooperatives, where the pay is fairly distributed, and decisions are made together.  As complementary reading, I would recommend John Abram'sCompanies We Keep (Revised & Expanded): Employee Ownership and the Business of Community and Place.The Extras on this DVD - with some interesting interviews - highlight another solution : CSA (community supported agriculture).

1315860,AEGLLY9CXWXX3,B0030Y11O2,"Halifax Student Account ""a-beautiful-idea""","[4, 5]","I really enjoyed this documentary, it was optimistic, funny and, most impressively, very brave in daring to question the prevailing orthodoxy of our times. This drives stupid people crazy, which is unfortunate as it's the stupid people who need to see this. Michael Moore is a heroic individual who knows how to make entertaining but serious documentaries. There is nothing `simplistic' or `Chomsky for children' about old Moore's documentaries. Those who think so just don't understand the genre or are struggling with ideas. All you people out there who are angry at Michael Moore for daring to make a 2 hour documentary, or being too fat, or wearing a baseball cap, or living in a huge mansion; well you really need to choose your evil empire with more wit. Rupert Murdoch, to take one example, has a much vaster footprint on the world than poor little Michael Moore, so aim your spears over there.Come on guys; give the man a chance, because what he says he says extremely well. Michael Moore is really sticking his neck out in going for the jugular with his `capitalism is evil' message. As well as senators and `normal' people, Moore interviews catholic priests and cardinals who actually agree with him. However, these guys has don't hold much moral weight these days, but never mind hey, because capitalism is really evil, amoral, nasty, brutal (ad your favourite expletive), so we'll let them off.This documentary lifted my spirits for a few days and ignited my utopian spark which had lain dormant for eons. Moore has a point when he argues that capitalism is just plain wrong. We may indeed dress it up with a, ""hey it reflects human nature"", malarkey, but still, life is not easy and we are the only species tending the garden, so what's our beef? No wonder there is so much sadness is in world. Capitalism is amoral, raving mad and completely bonkers isn't it? Those who say there is no alternative lack imagination, as do we all. But just because we lack the imagination doesn't mean that our ignorance is the right path. The worship of money has always been frowned upon. Let me remind you what Jesus said; this is from the gospel of Thomas; Jesus said, ""A grapevine has been planted outside of the Father, but since it is not sound, it will be pulled up by its root and destroyed."" I used to think that this meant organized religion, but it can be applied to capitalism. So the grapevine is the beast we find ourselves trapped under; trapped for lack of an alternative or just our rubbish human nature. I got this idea from Max Weber. Weber thought that we are forever trapped inside the `belly of the beast'. The beast is a infinitely ravenous consuming engine that ruins the planets finite resources and wastes human ingenuity by chewing up our leisure time, and excreting the good bits into profits for the minority. This is the terrible logic capitalism.Way back in the day, Jesus threw out the money lenders. We should get together and cheerfully sort out our own money lenders. Viva the Kingdom! Deep down I still believe all this, but I wonder if Michael Moore still believes? What I mean is this, are the many reasonable, and on ball, or is all this raving on about 'the machine' just masturbation for very clever people? As George Orwell says, when you put it into words it sounds reasonable; it's when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it becomes an act of faith.Moore must realize this, that is, that there are no people tuned into his way of thinking and that capitalism seems to be meta-stable. You may think you can push it over, but you realize that the walls are mile thick and the foundations go four hundred feet underground. This is why capitalism managed to bounce back from the 2008 crash and why the vicious ""smash the poor"" and ""we are all in this together"" onslaughts (I'm writing from the U.K were the new UNELECTED Tory party is in the process of ravaging the less well off until the pips squeak!) will go unchallenged by the many.In his book, Stupid White Men, Michael gives an example of how distracted otherwise intelligent people really are. Your typical sports fan can give your an articulate and penetrating lecture on the vicissitudes of the player transfer market but at the same time profess to finding economics and politics boring (Chomsky also gives this example). I read somewhere that the advert channel was the most watched program in America, enough said! So as the majority march to the sports stadiums and prostrate themselves in front of Simon Cowell and his pair of tits, the class-conscious rich are getting ready to let rip on the unsuspecting (as is now happening in the U.K).We are forever distracted by the slings and arrows of the entertainment industries, by the machinery of lottery jackpots which bleed our spirits dry by defining our poverty with the eternal carrot and sports that more and more start to look like corporations rather than our local team. As a result, we take our all too human eyes off the capitalist ball. This is what Michael Moore is say (but in a less pessimistic tone, this is Moore's great talent) and I suspect that he knows that he is preaching to the converted. This is why at the end of the documentary he tells the audience that he can't carry on doing this truth telling on his own. Are the masses watching? Will they take the batten?At the end of the program Moore wraps police crime scene tape around a bank whilst shouting ""citizen's arrest"" through a mega phone. I enjoyed this part because it was very funny. But it was very telling that no security guards bothered coming out and no police showed up (to speak to Moore). It is like the banks and corporations are so confident of their control that they allow Michael Moore his free speech because, by now, Michael Moore is part of the fixtures and fittings or the furniture of dissent.Terence McKenna calls this the 5 percent rule. As long as any school of descent remains below 5 per cent of the population, then no money is spent to destroy it. They allow the white noise, or interference in the circuitry, to go unchallenged; as long as only 5 percent take part in the chaos. That is all left wing anger really is to them; noise in the social circuitry, and people like Michael Moore are held up as an example of how free capitalism is because he is allowed to win Oscars and make lots of money . McKenna says that people who worry about all this stuff are an intellectual but alienated minority. So this is all the philosopher ever achieves; alienation.We are thus alienated by a system that humiliates us and bleeds our spirits dry. Only when the sleeping multitudes managed to tear themselves away from the merry-go-round of self gratification, will we be able to enact change. Michael Moore must realize this. Capitalism is like a wobbly palace, beautiful to look at but extremely unstable. Yes indeed, very very unstable (this is why the left always have the best analysis of what is wrong with the system), her foundations though are solid as granite, which is paradoxical isn't it? Why are the foundations of capitalism so stable then? The foundations are being held together you see, vigilantly and stoically, not by the masters, but by the docility of the overworked and the underpaid. So the overworked and underpaid have to awaken first. Michael Moore probably knows this and that is why he is so entertaining.",5,Listening up and moaning still!

1315863,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B0030Y11O2,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[16, 20]","After several books and movies, the verdict is finally in on Michael Moore: He stirs up the pot, pitches a ""one man hissy fit,"" jumping up and down for media attention like the signifying monkey, and then laughs all the way to the bank as he moves on to the next moneymaking project.With ""Roger Rabbit,"" that warned about the impending Detroit meltdown, which occurred on schedule as he had predicted: no one in the U.S. moved a muscle and we all watched Detroit sink to the bottom of lake Michigan. In ""Bowling with Columbine,"" where with great skill (if lacking subtlety and finesse), he exposed the machination of the gun merchants and their protectors the heavy-handed gun lobbyists. One thought there would be a great national outcry and a final serious move against the gun lobbyists and the weak kneed Congress that continues to cower under their threats, yet not a peek out of the still comatose American public. Then, just as our senior citizens were chartering caravans of buses across the border into Canada to purchase the same drugs being charged ten times as much to them in the U.S., came ""Sicko:"" a devastating critique of the ""sickness for profit"" system (that we call our national healthcare system), but again, not a solitary growl from the sleeping giant known as the American public?Now we have ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" perhaps the renegade filmmaker's best yet. It is a documentary about how both our present President and Congress are ""wholly owned subsidiaries"" of Goldman and Sachs, and about how the Congress and the last President hijacked the economy under a false scare that they themselves had conjured up (with ""credit default swaps"" and other nonsensical financial derivatives). This carefully engineered economic meltdown was only different in scope from the ones they had engineered about a decade before: first in the Keating-McCain scandal and then in the Burt Lance-Jimmy Carter BCCI scandal.It was also about now they and their lobbyist's friends continue to screw the nation in both the front (with the Obama bailout) and in the rear (with offshore tax dodges, insurance policies on employees, tax cuts obscene salaries and golden parachutes for themselves but low wages for everyone else, outsourcing, etc.) but all in the name of all our most cherished patriotic symbols. Never has there been a more thorough and devastating critique of the way the American middle class, the American farmer, and the American homeowner, have been screwed by the greedy money-hungry ""drive-by"" criminals running the Congress and Wall Street. Yet, I am going to go out on a limb and predict that nothing will happen as a result of this fine film, either.Why is it the case that when Michael Moore tells the unvarnished truth about what is happening right before our own eyes, no one seems to care? It can't just be that they don't like Moore's brand of politics, because the nation is divided right down the middle between liberals and conservatives (excuse me, between ""progressives"" and conservatives), so that can't be the underlying reason. It also can't be that Michael is just another capitalist himself with a capital ""C."" The movie (and Moore) avowedly are not against capitalism, just against the kind of ""vampire capitalism"" and unregulated ""casino capitalism"" being perpetrated against the American people today by the Wall Street crowd.I believe the reason goes much deeper and suggests that we are now ""in a fix"" we may never be able to extricate ourselves from.The grid of parallel fault lines making up the sectors that divide the country have now been Balkanized to the max. There are no more ways remaining by which we further can be divided as a people. As a result, the U.S. has become virtually ungovernable. And this is exactly what the greedy criminal Plutocrats (with their Congressional and Presidential lap dogs) have been angling towards, since FDR's New Deal. They have achieved their goal. There is no longer a ""common good,"" only ""special interests."" And whose interests are the most special of all? Guess? All the real democrats (little ""D"") hate each other's guts and would rather see the country fall they yield one narrow ideological point to another side. All the Balkanized sectors are at right angles to each other. There is no overlap. It's a multidimensional zero-sum game in every direction.That basically is where our democracy is today, and that's very sad. In the mean time, we elected Obama as the change candidate (that is to say, we elected him only to get rid of the village idiot) and he has distinguished himself by showing us how to ""duck and dodge"" all of the issues that divide us. What else can the poor guy do, become a real leader, god forbid? Did we forget, that that is not what he promised, he didn't promise leadership, just change. Well, how does that saying go: If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, smells like a duck, and ducks like a duck, it is, as Reverend Wright said: Just another Chicago politician. But as Hillary reminded us, he can give a good speech? I am beginning to dislike Obama as much as I disliked Bush, and I am a black man.Oh, we already know what will happen should ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" begin to really threaten to gain traction. The Plutocrats will circle the wagons and roll out their first line of defense, the racist rightwing media pundits like Limbaugh, Beck and Dobbs. Should the concerned and aware American public then began to wake up and see through this emotional smoke screen (which they rarely do) there still will be graft to spread around like cow manure to our ""morally challenged"" Congressmen, most of whom have yet to see a bag of money or a campaign contribution they could refuse. As a last resort, they will saturate the executive office with a revolving door list of ""who's Who"" in the world of how to screw the American people. And failing that, they can always find somewhere else to start another false war of necessity.Unless we get up off our duffs, and Obama starts showing some real leadership, we are definitely looking at a one-term Obama Presidency, and then four years of another conservative village idiot, maybe even Sarah Palin.

Obama, aka: Barry Soetoro, someone very familar with the Constitution has never even provided acceptable proof of US citizenship, such a certified copy of his birth certificate with doctor's signature like every other person has to provide. There is good reason to believe that he was not even legally eligible to be a US Senator, much less the US President.  How much help will he be when/if proved to be a complete fraud and puppet?I urge Michael Moore to get away from the old left/right paradigm and look at the facts regardless of political party.  We need people in office who still defend the US Constitution and will work to comply with it, not abuse it over and over again.If you have watched HBO's ""ROME"", you can see what the USA is becoming with tyrants cloaking their actions in the name of the ""republic"" with all sorts of political games, propaganda, martial law, wars, circuses, parades, and murder. Some playing to the ""noblemen"" and others to the common ""plebs"" in order to maintain their power. It is looking far too familar.Like many other activists today, Mr. Moore seems to have no real practical solutions after exposing some true criminals.

Kindel,"[3, 4]","I had previously considered ""Bowling For Columbine"" to be Michael Moore's masterpiece; but after watching ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" I must relegate that earlier work to second place.  ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is a truly exceptional piece of work, superbly crafted and outstandingly effective; it strips the mask off Capitalism so leisurely and non-chalantly, yet so completely, that only the most die-hard proponents of that monstrously overrated economic system can still claim to accept it at face value or see it as anything other than the most insidious and pervasive system of exploitation of the poor by the rich ever devised.  Above all else, it lays bare once and for all the simple-minded notion of ""Free Market.""  As Mr Moore shows, this ""Free Market"" is bought and paid for lock-stock-and-barrel by the super rich; the ""market"" is no more ""free"" than the gold bars languishing in a bank vault.It is, in fact, precisely the banks that Mr Moore uses as his wedge to pry open the capitalistic bag of tricks being foisted continually on an unsuspecting and uninformed public.  While he presents the ""Bank Bailout"" as the enormous fraud it actually was, he goes beyond that to present the entire spectrum of capitalistic activities as one big fraud after another.  He makes perfectly clear what the public once understood then quickly forgot as they became more affluent; namely, that it was the labor movement and not the largesse of the rich that created the middle class.  Now that the labor movement is all but dead, the real nature of the American people's relationship to the capitalistic paradigm is beginning to reveal itself once again. And it isn't pretty.Mr Moore's ""Achilles Heel"" as a filmmaker has always been a tendency to overplay the pathos inherent in the anecdotal stories of people who have been stripped of their livelihood, their homes and their dignity by the system.  I credit him, this time, with knowing when to stop short of languishing too long on the pathos, focusing instead on the larger picture of thousands, even millions, of people getting stuck permanently with the short end of the big ""trickle down"" stick because of their foolish but carefully sublimated belief that they, too, can become as rich as the super rich.This documentary achieves one other, ironic if unintended, goal: it gives the lie to documentarian Alex Jones' spurious contention that Michael Moore is a dupe of the bankers.  Jones contends that, because Moore did not suscribe to the idea that ""911"" was an inside job in his ""Farenheit 911,"" he is ipso facto a pawn of the bankers.  Far from being a pawn, though, Michael Moore, in his ""Capitalism: A Love Story,"" deals more expeditiously with the bankers than all of Alex Jones' films put together - and does so without straying into the realm of pure conjecture.  Which is precisely why Moore has managed to preserve his credibility, whereas Jones - an equally gifted documentarian - has all but squandered his.",5,The Real Deal,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,2977,"['had', 'previously', 'considered', 'Bowling', 'Columbine', 'be', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'masterpiece', 'watching', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'must', 'relegate', 'earlier', 'work', 'second', 'place', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'piece', 'work', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'outstandingly', 'effective', 'mask', 'Capitalism', 'so', 'leisurely', 'non-chalantly', 'yet', 'so', 'completely', 'only', 'most', 'die-hard', 'proponents', 'monstrously', 'overrated', 'economic', 'system', 'can', 'still', 'claim', 'accept', 'face', 'value', 'see', 'anything', 'other', 'most', 'insidious', 'pervasive', 'system', 'exploitation', 'poor', 'rich', 'ever', 'devised', 'else', 'bare', 'once', 'simple-minded', 'notion', 'Free', 'Market', 'Mr', 'Moore', 'Free', 'Market', 'bought', 'paid', 'lock-stock-and-barrel', 'super', 'rich', 'market', 'more', 'free', 'gold', 'bars', 'languishing', 'bank', 'vault.It', 'fact', 'precisely', 'banks', 'Mr', 'Moore', 'wedge', 'pry', 'open', 'capitalistic', 'bag', 'tricks', 'being', 'foisted', 'continually', 'unsuspecting', 'uninformed', 'public', 'Bank', 'Bailout', 'enormous', 'fraud', 'actually', 'was', 'present', 'entire', 'spectrum', 'capitalistic', 'activities', 'one', 'big', 'fraud', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'what', 'public', 'once', 'understood', 'then', 'quickly', 'forgot', 'became', 'more', 'affluent', 'namely', 'was', 'labor', 'movement', 'not', 'largesse', 'rich', 'created', 'middle', 'class', 'Now', 'labor', 'movement', 'dead', 'real', 'nature', 'American', 'people', 'relationship', 'capitalistic', 'paradigm', 'beginning', 'reveal', 'once', 'again', ""n't"", 'pretty.Mr', 'Moore', 'Achilles', 'Heel', 'filmmaker', 'always', 'been', 'tendency', 'overplay', 'pathos', 'inherent', 'anecdotal', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'livelihood', 'homes', 'dignity', 'system', 'credit', 'time', 'knowing', 'when', 'stop', 'short', 'languishing', 'too', 'long', 'pathos', 'focusing', 'instead', 'larger', 'picture', 'thousands', 'even', 'millions', 'people', 'getting', 'stuck', 'permanently', 'short', 'end', 'big', 'trickle', 'down', 'stick', 'foolish', 'carefully', 'sublimated', 'belief', 'too', 'can', 'become', 'as', 'rich', 'super', 'rich.This', 'documentary', 'achieves', 'one', 'other', 'ironic', 'unintended', 'goal', 'lie', 'documentarian', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'spurious', 'contention', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'dupe', 'bankers', 'Jones', 'Moore', 'did', 'not', 'suscribe', 'idea', '911', 'was', 'inside', 'job', 'Farenheit', '911', 'ipso', 'facto', 'pawn', 'bankers', 'Far', 'being', 'pawn', 'though', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'more', 'expeditiously', 'bankers', 'Alex', 'Jones', 'films', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'straying', 'realm', 'pure', 'conjecture', 'Which', 'precisely', 'why', 'Moore', 'managed', 'preserve', 'credibility', 'whereas', 'Jones', 'equally', 'gifted', 'documentarian', 'squandered']",N/A

Alvi,"[1, 2]","The picture Michael Moore paints with this movie will already be quite familiar to anyone who's really been paying attention to what's been happening in the US and looking at the evidence objectively.As Moore notes, our current US version of capitalism has become severely compromised because people in certain domains (finance, health care, defense, media, very large corporations, etc.) have been able to implement schemes which rob the public wealth, and they've used their resulting concentrated wealth to powerfully manipulate our government in ways that enable perputation or expansion of those schemes.If the public was able to regain control of the government, these schemes could be shut down and our society could become much more equitable and even prosperous, but the question is how to break the hegemony.  Moore urges rebellion by the masses, but I have to admit that I'm not too optimistic about the prospects for that happening or being effective, though I don't really have any better ideas to offer myself.Where Moore somewhat errs is that he oversimplifies things.  The problem isn't the broad and diverse category of socioeconomic systems called ""capitalism"" but rather the particular corrupted version of capitalism which we currently have.  And indeed, Adam Smith himself was well aware of the dangers of corruption and pointed them out clearly in his writings.A related problem is the format of the movie.  Moore does succeed in putting a human face on economic suffering, and thereby elicits emotions which can stir us to action.  But he also paints with a broad brush which leaves out important details and reveals bias.  As a result, while this movie can effectively preach to the choir, I'm not sure that it will be convincing to people who are new to Moore's viewpoint (or opposed to it), so that may ironically undermine Moore's aim of stirring action on a mass scale.But in the end, Moore is mostly correct in his assertions, this story needs to be told, and it's OK for the story to be told from different angles (such as this movie), so I recommend this movie to anyone who cares about the future of our country.

Pilots with their wings, who are on food-stamps to survive? It's one of the many case studies in this movie, which is about the recent plunge in our economy and its wide-ranging effects. It also asks the sensitive question of what happened to all that bail out money? Very dramatic and by my example, you can see that it is also sometimes hard to believe. But the director of this film, Mr. Micheal Moore, is never boring, even if he can be too dramatic (in bowling for Columbine, Charleston Heston is made to be seen as too villanous).

I've done quite a bit of reading, and I've never once heard that the rich were taxed 90% during the gilded age (quite frankly, there was no income tax before World War I), and that this money was used to build up America's middle-class through public expenditures in education and health care.  I've never heard about FDR's second Bill of Rights, one that guaranteed economic security to America's middle-class (wouldn't that make America socialist?).Of course, hypocrisy and credibility issues have always shadowed Moore's career.

We often watch documentaries about going to war over oil or religion in america or the incorporation of water rights or patenting of plants by large companies, and we both find them interesting but there are some I am more likely to watch by myself, like a Michael Moore dvd, because as mentioned above, he dislikes Michael Moore.That is the basic problem AND hook of any Michael Moore dvd. On the one hand he is annoying and can make you sympathize with the ""bad guys"" he is harassing simply because he is harassing them and it can be really obnoxious and get in the way of the message of his film, but on the other hand, it makes his films more memorable and himself as a director more memorable, so it all stands out in the mind afterward. The other problem is that he's not converting anyone to his POV. Either you think that way already, or you don't. I agree with most of what he says, because I already agreed before the movie, and my bf thinks it's all ridiculous and because of the biased way MM portrays everything, he is completely closed to listening to anything MM has to say. (A third problem is that MM looks distractingly and disturbingly like my mom.)My favorite part of this movie was how MM makes you think about capitalism. It's something we take for granted, but is it REALLY the best way for us to live? He shows us other countries as better models and seems to be saying those countries being destroyed by war seems to have been a good thing because now they have been built up to be better than before. So is he saying if someone bombed the bejesus out of the US would we be better off in the long run because we could rebuild better than before? Another point he makes is that we don't want to raise taxes for the wealthy or constrain them in any way because we tend to believe that one day we will be one of the very wealthy ourselves. It's only when that dream is completely shattered that we start to fight back.As usual, MM has a lot of good points to make here, but I kept waiting for them to be drawn together in a cohesive whole at the end, with a conclusion that felt satisfying or hopeful or like *I* could do something, but that never happened. It just kind of...ended.After the dvd was over, my bf and I stayed up late, in bed, talking...or arguing even...on our different points of view about the movie. Neither one of us convinced each other of anything, it just pointed out some of our different fundamental life views and made us go to sleep grumpy and exhausted.

Going in, you have to realize that Moore has an agenda and his goal is to persuade you to see his vision. He does this primarily with his creative use of the camera, dramatic music, and showing heart wrenching scenes of despair. What makes him a good filmmaker is that he also digs deeper into the issues. While some of these issues are well known (1% of the world having most of the wealth, record corporate earnings partly achieved by massive layoffs, stagnation of wages), further issues such as the poor wages of airline pilots, credit default swaps, and company insurance policies on their employees while listing themselves as the beneficiary are far more disturbing. Moore plays both the political card and morality card to the hilt throughout, especially with his anti-George Bush stance. The examples of justice such as the Chicago factory workers fighting to get the money owed to them when their company closed provide a nice touch and show what can happen when you unite and fight for what's right.

It is funny from the beginning to the end, yet ""delightfully serious"" at the same time (note the paradox).  It is very unfortunate that this movie did not get the acclaim that it should have.  More people should see it. It opens our minds and our hearts to the fact that capitalism is at the bottom of all this.  Right in front of our eyes ""capitalism"" says that profit is more important than human need.  How could this be?  Is it more important for someone to make a profit or to give a needed operation to a sick child?  Moore's attention to fundamental Judaic-Christian-Islamic values ultimately, that emphasize duties to one another and to ""do things to the least of these"" is noteworthy and refreshing.  It is as if such fundamental spiritual wisdom has become lost.  How unfortunate!

The movie could have been enhanced if Mr. Moore then spoke about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which to a large degree is a legacy of Roosevelt's Four Freedoms.

1315879,A19K46GITRI5Y2,B0030Y11O2,Joyce,"[1, 2]","Capitalism: A Love Story is Michael Moore's best.  I kept applauding throughout  the film.  Moore's argument is less with capitalism than with capitalism's most egregious excesses in the U.S., mainly the greed of the banking industry and the gambling on Wall Street.  His ideal is not the end of private ownership, but more cooperatively owned businesses where everyone shares the wealth and makes collective decisions.  With clips from Ronald Reagan's old movies and days in office, Moore colorfully shows how Reagan's policies began our current economic decline.  The funniest moments are when Moore asks several bankers to explain what derivatives are.  All fumble and stumble.  Of course, derivatives themselves aren't funny.  For example, they  might involve bets placed on the expectation that folks will default on their mortgages  Perhaps the most horrifying account in the movie is of a judge who was paid for each  juvenile he sent to privately owned detention centers.  He happily  sent large numbers, many for trivial offenses.  Another horrifying moment is the segment on ""dead peasant"" insurance.  (Yes, that is what it is called.)  This is the insurance which companies (like WalMart) take out on their employees, making them more valuable  to the company dead than alive.  The heroine of the film is Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) who advised her constituents not to move if a bank foreclosed and to demand that the bank produce a copy of their mortgage.  In many cases, the banks can't.  The most encouraging moment is about the workers who protested Bank of America's refusal to pay wages earned.  The workers won.  My favorite image is of Moore using bright yellow police-crime-scene tape to block off the Stock Exchange.  I cheered!  The most inspiring moment is a clip of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, not long before his death,  proposing his Second Bill of Rights for Americans, calling for the right to homes, jobs, education, and health care.  What a tragedy that he did not live to carry out its passage!  But it is there for us to carry out.

1315883,A3M9ULK9QECAMX,B0030Y11O2,K.I.B.,"[74, 93]","Let me take the moment to give you TWO THINGS about this movie that made me take TWO STARS away from the five-star review it could of received...but first, let me make a disclaimer about Mr. Moore:The last time I considered myself a ""liberal"" was for about a semester in college when I was interning under a ""liberal"" professor.  Prior to that I was always conservative-minded...and pretty much still am, every college student goes through some sort of liberal phase.  That being said, I think Michael Moore has always made great movies.  Even though I don't agree with gun control, universal health care, or socialism, I still feel his films have provided an education on government and corporate corruption that a mass audience can enjoy while being enlightened.  Moore's solutions are always a little too idealistic for my tastes, but I'm glad he has been there for 20+ years to be an agent of critical thinking to the general public.That being said, here is what I DISLIKED about ""Capitalism: A Love Story"".  (I am not going to talk about what I liked or agreed with in the film, because that was pretty much everything except for what I am about to mention).First, I take a star away because this film seems to try to be anti-capitalism when it's real target is NOT capitalism but corruption WITHIN capitalism.  Wal-Mart taking out life insurance policies on employees, privatized penal systems, and job-loss due to outsourcing are not default results of capitalism.  These are examples of the greed and violation that occurs when capitalism leads to single entities having too much power.  However, if it were not for capitalism, well, lets just say Michael Moore might have to show his movies after midnight in very private places to very select audiences.Next, and this is the BIGGEST flaw of ""Capitalism"", I take a star away because of the severe [...]that Barrack Obama gets in the last third of this movie.  I am not sure what the future holds for President Obama's legacy, but I do know that it is absolutely ludicrous to call a guy a saint before he has done a single thing.  Also, take a look at guys like Paulson and Geitner...they still have jobs under Obama, don't they?  In fact, aren't they more powerful under Obama?  Read the news, day after day you'll see that Mr. Obama is putting more and more power in the hands of Wall Street cronies and the Federal Reserve.I feel that Michael Moore is terribly mistaken in putting so much trust into the man who would be president.  The reality is that Barrack Obama and the Democratic party are a different face to the same beast that employed George Bush and Bill Clinton.  Powerful bankers, corrupt judges, lobbyists, greedy globalists...the presidents have carried out the bidding of these schmuck's since Kennedy was assassinated.

I open with this quote since it reminds me so much of the reaction to Michael Moore's films:  so often reviews of his films open with an ad hominem attack on Moore himself.  (I've frequently seen this happen first-hand; I've taught _Bowling for Columbine_ in my college classes so that we can talk about issues of school violence, and my students want to attack Moore before they have even watched the film.) He is one of those filmmakers who polarizes his viewers, and his detractors want to shoot him down, without giving his ideas a fair listen.If you're open to Moore's messages, his newest film is worth a listen.  This documentary is about our capitalist society, but it's also an expose about the criminal activity that our corporations have engaged in, and towards which our government has turned a blind eye.  Most compelling, though, are the accounts and interviews of the average families who have been so affected by the last few years of recession.  Seeing these families lose their homes is hard to watch, and the connections that Moore makes between the Wall Street fat cats and the very real consequences that their actions have had on the average American family is distressing.If you're open to the message, this film is worth seeing.",4,Interesting and thought-provoking,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,1499,"['film', 'Guise', 'Violence', 'Media', 'Crisis', 'Masculinity_', 'Jackson', 'Katz', 'anti-violence', 'educator', 'activist', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'kill', 'messenger', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'face', 'squarely', 'implications', 'message', 'open', 'quote', 'so', 'much', 'reaction', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'so', 'often', 'films', 'open', 'ad', 'hominem', 'attack', 'Moore', ""'ve"", 'frequently', 'seen', 'happen', 'first-hand', ""'ve"", 'taught', '_Bowling', 'Columbine_', 'college', 'classes', 'so', 'can', 'talk', 'issues', 'school', 'violence', 'students', 'want', 'attack', 'Moore', 'have', 'even', 'watched', 'film', 'one', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'viewers', 'detractors', 'want', 'shoot', 'down', 'giving', 'ideas', 'fair', 'listen.If', ""'re"", 'open', 'Moore', 'messages', 'newest', 'film', 'listen', 'documentary', 'capitalist', 'society', 'also', 'expose', 'criminal', 'activity', 'corporations', 'have', 'engaged', 'towards', 'government', 'turned', 'blind', 'eye', 'Most', 'compelling', 'are', 'accounts', 'interviews', 'average', 'families', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'affected', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'recession', 'Seeing', 'families', 'lose', 'homes', 'hard', 'watch', 'connections', 'Moore', 'Wall', 'Street', 'fat', 'cats', 'very', 'real', 'consequences', 'actions', 'have', 'had', 'average', 'American', 'family', 'distressing.If', ""'re"", 'open', 'message', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
1315888,A11ED8O95W2103,B0030Y11O2,"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2""","[5, 15]","""Irony"" is too tame a word to describe the experience of hearing a really rich filmmaker narrating in soft, soothing tones as he describes why the ""rich"" are bad.  Making a lot of money by getting childish leftists to hate their own culture seems to be what Moore does best, and here he almost becomes a parody of himself, if anyone is paying attention.But for those who weren't paying attention, here are some observations.First, Moore never really defines ""capitalism"" in this movie.  He just teaches why it is bad.  Why didn't he define it first?  I'm guessing that he is counting on the childish leftists to bring their own definition to the film.  They know capitalism is bad, and they just need to know why.So, what better way then to narrate them through a number of stories of ""bad thing"" happening, with little context or back story or history, and in each case purr in the chidrens' ears about how bad the big mean capitalist is.  Ooooh look children, these people got hurt.  Ooooh look children, there's the capitalist.  He's bad, isn't he children.Anyway, without wasting too much time on this example of transparently obvious propaganda, here are a few counterpoints.First, Moore did enlighten me to some bad stuff I didn't know about.  The corporations taking out life insurance policies on their employees being the worst to me, but I hardly think that this is motivated by ""capitalism"" but rather by greed and laws that allow it to happen.  The laws need to be changed, that's all.Second, Nobody is forcing pilots to fly passenger planes for $20,000 a year (or whatever).  Anyone bright enough to fly an airplane can get a job doing something else for more money.  So, they need to quit and go do something else.Third, Jesus said things that sound ""capitalist"" too, such as when He said that to him who has, more shall be given, and to he that has not, even what he thinks he has shall be taken from him.  Ooooh children, Jesus sounds ""capitalist"" there.  That wasn't in the movie!  Shocked I am!Cherry picking Jesus' words to make Him sound like He's on your side is as old as it is wrong, but it never ends.  There is no special place in Hell for ""the rich"".  Paul commanded the rich to be generous, not to become poor.  I do wonder if there might be a special place for those who twist Jesus' words for financial gain.  Hmmmmm.Fourth, do you know why the AIG bigwigs weren't on the tops of their roofs screaming for help after Hurricane Katrina?  Do you?  Well, like myself, and I'm guessing you, they didn't buy houses below sea level next to an ocean where it was known for many years that the area could not withstand a major hurricane. But the hurricane happened!  Just another reason to hate the capitalist!  Anyone thinking out there?Anyway, I could go on but I've wasted enough time already.  Time to leave my private property and drive to the privately owned company I work for.

All it is is letting people behave without restriction in an economy (just as Free speech is letting people speak without restriction.)Second is that, likeChurchillsaid about democracy, it is the ""worst form of government except for all those others that have been tried from time to time.""And these are two issues that prevent me giving this film the full 5 stars. Yes - it is a compelling critique and makes a number of good points (e.g. about Pilots being paid less that $20,000 a year & Dead Peasants insurance), but Moore really fails in some of his thinking.Several examples, the first being foreclosures. Though foreclosures have become far too commonplace in the US, Moore does not make this clear in his film, but instead goes on the offensive against the very idea that people can be turned out of their homes for not paying their bills. Yes - it is cruel to throw people out at short notice, but not throwing non-payers out *ever* is also bad. Surely there is a balance, but this is nowhere made clear.Second, Moore makes out that socialism is an alternative system, rather than just being an adaptation of what is already there. Systems that go for pure socialism tend to have little ability to generate Wealth and so fail (even Fidel Castro has begun admitting this recently). Again, its a balancing act, and not one system vs another.Third, Moore has big issues with lay-offs and even makes the false correlation that General Motor's lay-offs in the 80's lead to bankrupcy in the 2000's. Truth is that big companies have to lay-off people to stay competitive and, even if fat-cat bonuses could be trimmed, that wouldn't mean that you should good money after bad and keep loss-making plants open.Anyways, aside from those issues, I really enjoyed this film and found it refreshing to see someone stand up for the principles of Roosevelt and Liberal democracy.In an ideal World, all of Moore's ideas would be implementable and Heaven might dawn on Earth. As things are, there are only a few ideas of his that hit home, but these all have great potency.For instance, Why does America not have more workers cooperatives? Why not tax the 1% richest more? And, most importantly, how dare the rich claim that their accumulation of wealth is in line with the teachings of Christ?And since few others are offering alternative arguments like Moore's (with the exception of the slightly crazyZeitgeist, the sadly overlookedThe Corporationand the immortalBill Hicks), then I do recommend all and sundry to watch this film.The day that the World gains a newKarl Marx(with a moral compass and a dash of self-affacing humour) will surely be a good day for all...",4,"Patchy, but the Best in its Field",1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,2813,"['One', 'problem', 'Capitalism', 'misapprehensions', 'people', 'have', 'about', 'it.Firstly', 'not', ""'system"", 'something', 'Moore', 'mistake', 'calling', 'letting', 'people', 'behave', 'restriction', 'economy', 'just', 'Free', 'speech', 'letting', 'people', 'speak', 'restriction', 'Second', 'likeChurchillsaid', 'democracy', 'worst', 'form', 'government', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'tried', 'time', 'time', 'are', 'two', 'issues', 'prevent', 'giving', 'film', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'Yes', 'compelling', 'critique', 'number', 'good', 'points', 'e.g', 'Pilots', 'being', 'paid', 'less', '20,000', 'year', 'Dead', 'Peasants', 'insurance', 'Moore', 'really', 'thinking.Several', 'examples', 'first', 'being', 'foreclosures', 'foreclosures', 'have', 'become', 'far', 'too', 'commonplace', 'US', 'Moore', 'not', 'make', 'clear', 'film', 'instead', 'offensive', 'very', 'idea', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'homes', 'not', 'paying', 'bills', 'Yes', 'cruel', 'throw', 'people', 'out', 'short', 'notice', 'not', 'throwing', 'non-payers', 'out', '*ever*', 'also', 'bad', 'Surely', 'balance', 'nowhere', 'made', 'clear.Second', 'Moore', 'out', 'socialism', 'alternative', 'system', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'adaptation', 'what', 'already', 'there', 'Systems', 'go', 'pure', 'socialism', 'tend', 'have', 'little', 'ability', 'generate', 'Wealth', 'so', 'fail', 'even', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'begun', 'admitting', 'recently', 'Again', 'balancing', 'act', 'not', 'one', 'system', 'vs', 'another.Third', 'Moore', 'big', 'issues', 'lay-offs', 'even', 'false', 'correlation', 'General', 'Motor', 'lay-offs', '80', 'lead', 'bankrupcy', '2000', 'Truth', 'big', 'companies', 'have', 'lay-off', 'people', 'stay', 'competitive', 'even', 'fat-cat', 'bonuses', 'could', 'be', 'trimmed', 'would', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'good', 'money', 'bad', 'keep', 'loss-making', 'plants', 'open.Anyways', 'aside', 'issues', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'found', 'refreshing', 'see', 'someone', 'stand', 'up', 'principles', 'Roosevelt', 'Liberal', 'democracy.In', 'ideal', 'World', 'Moore', 'ideas', 'would', 'be', 'implementable', 'Heaven', 'might', 'dawn', 'Earth', 'things', 'are', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'ideas', 'hit', 'home', 'have', 'great', 'potency.For', 'instance', 'Why', 'America', 'not', 'have', 'more', 'workers', 'cooperatives', 'Why', 'not', 'tax', '1', '%', 'richest', 'more', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'dare', 'rich', 'claim', 'accumulation', 'wealth', 'line', 'teachings', 'Christ', 'few', 'others', 'are', 'offering', 'alternative', 'arguments', 'Moore', 'exception', 'slightly', 'crazyZeitgeist', 'sadly', 'overlookedThe', 'Corporationand', 'immortalBill', 'Hicks', 'then', 'do', 'recommend', 'sundry', 'watch', 'film.The', 'day', 'World', 'gains', 'newKarl', 'Marx', 'moral', 'compass', 'dash', 'self-affacing', 'humour', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'good', 'day']",N/A

So instead of a system that uses incentive to get people to work harder to make something of themselves, Moore would be happier if we all just tossed what we made into a pot and dispersed it equally to everyone. An easy thing to believe while being paid the amounts of money he gets.Moore uses several tactics that have worked for him before. The first is making fun of the stereotypical American family with mom, dad and the kids all living idyllic lives. He treats this as if it is a thing of the past, the good old days ruined now by corporate America.His next tactic is to label a bad guy, which in Moore's world are corporate big wigs. Their only concern seems to be making money for the company that they are in charge of, which is actually what they are paid to do. In Moore's eyes this should be about making money for the workers instead of the stockholders who invested money in the company to begin with.Then again he never notes that there are more pieces to the puzzle than he lists. Not mentioned are unions that got their employees more money/benefits that the company has to pay resulting in less money to go towards employees resulting in cut jobs or the state of the economy which would raise or lower the costs of goods, etc. But these aren't important to Moore who has an axe to grind, facts be damned!Moore pulls out his best trick several times: tugging at the heartstrings of the viewer. He does so here using his own father, walking with him down a broken sidewalk where the plant his father once worked in now stands demolished. When he asks his father what he remembers most, what his best memories of working there were he responds ""The people"".He also takes us to meet people who have been evicted from their homes. I have a great sympathy for anyone in this position. But Moore uses them, making them look like poor innocents who have been mistreated. With the exception of one family who fell on hard times, he never explains why they were forced into this position or even if the bank tried to work with them. Cue violins, pass the tissues.I will grant that documentaries are supposed to come with the film maker's point of view. But Moore has done such a shoddy job of avoiding numerous facts while using outlandish ones to support his ideas that it's become hard to take him seriously. He also tends to attempt to advance his ideas using emotions rather than facts. Toss in the fact that he's biting the hand that feeds him and you have to wonder why he continues or why those companies would give him money.Your politics and beliefs will skew the way you look at this film. At one time I was a big Moore fan, loved ROGER & ME (before I found out about the short cuts and alterations of truth contained in it), loved his TV series and thought Moore stood for something. The more I look deeper into the man and his films, the more I discover that he's less for telling the truth, for getting to the bottom of things and more about pushing an agenda. I was taught that documentaries were to promote and objective look at a topic with perhaps a slight tilt towards the beliefs of the film maker. In Moore's case we get all the film maker's beliefs and little objectivity.With several web sites taking the time to point out the twisting of facts and outright lies told in Moore's past films, one has to wonder just how much he's done so on this one. In this film he avoids the fact that greed, not capitalism, is the heart of the problem. And there is greed on both sides of the issue.Perhaps the only thing different about this film than others Moore has done is who he attacks. This time around he doesn't limit those to Republicans but goes after both sides. Chances are this will result in fewer people taking him seriously. Then again with the box office returns on this film, I think that's been demonstrated already.For a fair and objective observation on the topic, pass this one by. If you think capitalism is terrible though, you'll love it. And if you are a die hard Moore fan, you'll get what you are looking for.",1,MORE MOORE,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,4600,"['time', 'year', 'again', 'when', 'world', 'up', 'spring', 'air', 'world', 'alive', 'Well', 'exception', 'release', 'new', 'film', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'Talk', 'downer', 'Nothing', 'fresh', 'here', 'rather', 'more', 'Moore', 'ranting', 'how', 'terrible', 'country', 'millions', 'dollars', 'make', 'movies', 'fewer', 'fewer', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'see.CAPITALISM', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'anything', 'What', 'basically', 'down', 'Moore', 'view', 'capitalism', 'evil', 'idea', 'should', 'be', 'abolished', 'replaced', 'socialism', 'So', 'instead', 'system', 'incentive', 'get', 'people', 'work', 'harder', 'make', 'something', 'Moore', 'would', 'be', 'happier', 'just', 'tossed', 'what', 'made', 'pot', 'dispersed', 'equally', 'everyone', 'easy', 'thing', 'believe', 'being', 'paid', 'amounts', 'money', 'several', 'tactics', 'have', 'worked', 'before', 'first', 'making', 'fun', 'stereotypical', 'American', 'family', 'mom', 'dad', 'kids', 'living', 'idyllic', 'lives', 'thing', 'past', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'ruined', 'now', 'corporate', 'America.His', 'next', 'tactic', 'label', 'bad', 'guy', 'Moore', 'world', 'are', 'corporate', 'big', 'wigs', 'only', 'concern', 'be', 'making', 'money', 'company', 'are', 'charge', 'actually', 'what', 'are', 'paid', 'do', 'Moore', 'eyes', 'should', 'be', 'making', 'money', 'workers', 'instead', 'stockholders', 'who', 'invested', 'money', 'company', 'begin', 'with.Then', 'again', 'never', 'are', 'more', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'Not', 'mentioned', 'are', 'unions', 'got', 'employees', 'more', 'money/benefits', 'company', 'pay', 'resulting', 'less', 'money', 'go', 'towards', 'employees', 'resulting', 'cut', 'jobs', 'state', 'economy', 'would', 'raise', 'lower', 'costs', 'goods', 'etc', 'are', ""n't"", 'important', 'Moore', 'who', 'axe', 'grind', 'facts', 'be', 'damned', 'Moore', 'out', 'best', 'trick', 'several', 'times', 'tugging', 'heartstrings', 'viewer', 'so', 'here', 'using', 'own', 'father', 'walking', 'down', 'broken', 'sidewalk', 'where', 'plant', 'father', 'once', 'worked', 'now', 'demolished', 'When', 'father', 'what', 'most', 'what', 'best', 'memories', 'working', 'were', 'people', '.He', 'also', 'meet', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'evicted', 'homes', 'have', 'great', 'sympathy', 'anyone', 'position', 'Moore', 'making', 'look', 'poor', 'innocents', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'mistreated', 'exception', 'one', 'family', 'who', 'fell', 'hard', 'times', 'never', 'why', 'were', 'forced', 'position', 'even', 'bank', 'tried', 'work', 'Cue', 'violins', 'pass', 'tissues.I', 'will', 'grant', 'documentaries', 'are', 'supposed', 'come', 'film', 'maker', 'point', 'view', 'Moore', 'done', 'shoddy', 'job', 'avoiding', 'numerous', 'facts', 'using', 'outlandish', 'ones', 'support', 'ideas', 'become', 'hard', 'take', 'seriously', 'also', 'attempt', 'advance', 'ideas', 'using', 'emotions', 'rather', 'facts', 'Toss', 'fact', 'biting', 'hand', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'why', 'companies', 'would', 'give', 'money.Your', 'politics', 'beliefs', 'will', 'skew', 'way', 'look', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'big', 'Moore', 'fan', 'loved', 'ROGER', 'ME', 'found', 'out', 'short', 'cuts', 'alterations', 'truth', 'contained', 'loved', 'TV', 'series', 'thought', 'Moore', 'stood', 'something', 'more', 'look', 'deeper', 'man', 'films', 'more', 'discover', 'less', 'telling', 'truth', 'getting', 'bottom', 'things', 'more', 'pushing', 'agenda', 'was', 'taught', 'documentaries', 'were', 'promote', 'objective', 'look', 'topic', 'perhaps', 'slight', 'tilt', 'beliefs', 'film', 'maker', 'Moore', 'case', 'get', 'film', 'maker', 'beliefs', 'little', 'objectivity.With', 'several', 'web', 'sites', 'taking', 'time', 'point', 'out', 'twisting', 'facts', 'outright', 'lies', 'told', 'Moore', 'past', 'films', 'one', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'done', 'so', 'one', 'film', 'fact', 'greed', 'not', 'capitalism', 'heart', 'problem', 'greed', 'sides', 'issue.Perhaps', 'only', 'thing', 'different', 'film', 'others', 'Moore', 'done', 'who', 'time', ""n't"", 'limit', 'Republicans', 'sides', 'Chances', 'are', 'will', 'result', 'fewer', 'people', 'taking', 'seriously', 'Then', 'again', 'box', 'office', 'returns', 'film', 'think', 'been', 'demonstrated', 'fair', 'objective', 'observation', 'topic', 'pass', 'one', 'think', 'capitalism', 'terrible', ""'ll"", 'love', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'Moore', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'get', 'what', 'are', 'looking']",N/A

1315893,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0030Y11O2,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story is quite a documentary! Although I don't agree with every last thing Moore believes, I have to admire his ability to make a documentary that is entertaining, poignant at times and informative (well, informative from his point of view). Moore's general premise, as you might know by now, is that capitalism stinks and he desperately tries to prove that all throughout the movie, stopping at practically nothing to make his point. For example, his interviews with priests are very well positioned in the film to influence his audience; and even if you don't agree with him I think the interviews with the priests are presented nicely. Moore also uses some pretty silly antics along the way; he wants to drive home his point in such a way that the audience won't forget his message anytime soon. Look for him to cordon off a bank building in downtown Manhattan as a crime scene!There's so much in this film that I scarcely know where to begin. For one, after the financial crash of 2008 Moore interviewed Congressmen and women who had to vote on a huge government bailout of big business with practically no time or advance notice whatsoever to review the bailout terms before voting. We learn that Congress initially voted against the bailout at least partly because it was unpopular with many constituents; and then Moore explores why the Congress was pressured by both political parties to vote again just days later, this time in favor of the bailout.One aspect of the film that definitely hit home for me was the topic of how greedy big banks routinely tricked people into taking out sub-prime mortgages on their homes without advising them of how the interest rates go dramatically skyrocket after an initial period of time; and the footage we get of the struggle one family in Miami, Florida goes through to keep their home was poignant. The segment about airline pilots being paid so little saddened me; and it was interesting and even slightly amusing to see Moore trying to understand how derivatives work on Wall Street. There's also time devoted to a Chicago factory worker's strike when they were laid off without pay or severance. We also learn how the federal government was changed possibly forever by the influence of big business and Wall Street; this process mostly started during the Reagan administration.There's so much more; it may seem as if I've given it all away but I assure you that I haven't.The DVD comes with several bonus features which expand on Moore's views in this film.Overall, Capitalism: A Love Story was Michael Moore's way to call it as he sees it when the topic is capitalism. This is a film most people are going to either love or hate because Moore's opinions run all through the film and people will either agree with him or disagree with him. Of course, there will be a third group of people like myself who agree with most of what he says but not quite all of it.",5,"revealing, opinionated and poignant",1347840000,"09 17, 2012",2012,2948,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'quite', 'documentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'last', 'thing', 'Moore', 'have', 'admire', 'ability', 'make', 'documentary', 'entertaining', 'poignant', 'times', 'informative', 'well', 'informative', 'point', 'view', 'Moore', 'general', 'premise', 'might', 'know', 'now', 'capitalism', 'stinks', 'desperately', 'prove', 'movie', 'stopping', 'practically', 'nothing', 'make', 'point', 'example', 'interviews', 'priests', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'positioned', 'film', 'influence', 'audience', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'think', 'interviews', 'priests', 'are', 'presented', 'nicely', 'Moore', 'also', 'pretty', 'silly', 'antics', 'way', 'drive', 'home', 'point', 'such', 'way', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'message', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Look', 'cordon', 'off', 'bank', 'building', 'downtown', 'Manhattan', 'crime', 'scene', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'scarcely', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'one', 'financial', 'crash', '2008', 'Moore', 'interviewed', 'Congressmen', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'vote', 'huge', 'government', 'bailout', 'big', 'business', 'practically', 'time', 'advance', 'notice', 'whatsoever', 'review', 'bailout', 'terms', 'voting', 'learn', 'Congress', 'initially', 'voted', 'bailout', 'least', 'partly', 'was', 'unpopular', 'many', 'constituents', 'then', 'Moore', 'why', 'Congress', 'was', 'pressured', 'political', 'parties', 'vote', 'again', 'just', 'days', 'later', 'time', 'favor', 'bailout.One', 'aspect', 'film', 'definitely', 'hit', 'home', 'was', 'topic', 'how', 'greedy', 'big', 'banks', 'routinely', 'tricked', 'people', 'taking', 'out', 'sub-prime', 'mortgages', 'homes', 'advising', 'how', 'interest', 'rates', 'go', 'dramatically', 'skyrocket', 'initial', 'period', 'time', 'footage', 'get', 'struggle', 'one', 'family', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'keep', 'home', 'was', 'poignant', 'segment', 'airline', 'pilots', 'being', 'paid', 'so', 'little', 'saddened', 'was', 'interesting', 'even', 'slightly', 'amusing', 'see', 'Moore', 'trying', 'understand', 'how', 'derivatives', 'work', 'Wall', 'Street', 'also', 'time', 'devoted', 'Chicago', 'factory', 'worker', 'strike', 'when', 'were', 'laid', 'off', 'pay', 'severance', 'also', 'learn', 'how', 'federal', 'government', 'was', 'changed', 'possibly', 'forever', 'influence', 'big', 'business', 'Wall', 'Street', 'process', 'mostly', 'started', 'Reagan', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'may', 'seem', ""'ve"", 'given', 'away', 'assure', ""haven't.The"", 'DVD', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'expand', 'Moore', 'views', 'film.Overall', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'was', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'way', 'call', 'when', 'topic', 'capitalism', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'Moore', 'opinions', 'run', 'film', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'agree', 'disagree', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'third', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'agree', 'most', 'what', 'not', 'quite']",N/A

Laying the blame in both political camps, Moore finds America reeling from foreclosures, joblessness and spending more money than they can afford by extending credit. Examining our Nation's belief in the free market, participation in free enterprise and competition, Moore suggests that our greed will and has become our downfall, which is evident by the collapse of the housing industry (increase foreclosures), the car industry (GM), and the downward spiral of our economy. And while it is clearly a societal dilemma Moore places the blame squarely on our shoulders. After all, it is our fault that we are in the predicament that we are.

He brings up the example of Jonas Salk, who selflessly worked to create a polio vaccine. Wonderful. If everyone was so unselfish and dedicated, maybe we could be communists.He also brings up examples of companies who operate more like a co-op. I love the idea. Are there many entrepeneurs who would risk their fortunes to start a company, in which there isn't the promise of gargantuan return? I doubt it. I wish that weren't the case, but it is.People look out for themselves and their families. Is that good or bad? I don't know. But it's reality. It's the result of eons of evolution.Why would I take a huge risk to start a business that could fail and potentially cost me tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars? Is it because I'm like Jonas Salk, and will work tirelessly and without thought of myself, because I believe so strongly in my widget? No, it's because having more personal wealth is a good thing. It means I can travel more. I can give my kids a better education. I can retire without worrying about whether I live long enough to outlast my money.And as a byproduct, others would benefit from my wealth. That's right, economics isn't about one pie that stays the same size, and being wealthy means I take a bigger piece of the pie, leaving others with less. Wealthy people make the pie bigger, so that everyone gets more.I don't dismiss the examples shown in the movie...they are the unfortunate results of selfishness gone bad.

Moore examines the difference between individual vs. corporate welfare and makes the argument that if the government's going to bail people out, they should be doing so from the bottom-up instead of the top-down.  Moore also explores his Catholic faith and argues as to whether or not Jesus would be supporting the values of the political party that invokes His name the most.Now, I'm completely against gun control (if you ask me, gun control is using both hands), but I lovedBowling for Columbinebecause it was entertaining and I considerFahrenheit 9/11to be his ""magnum opus.""  This film was more ""slapstick"" than those previous releases (as well asSicko) but still does make a valid point:  We live in a country where those with nothing can be thrown out on the streets while those who advocated and lobbied for both predatory lending practices and tax laws that are wildy unfavorable to the working class can be entitled to billions of dollars from the government and million-dollar ""golden parachutes"" from their employers without fear of penalty.  Those who favor Keynesian economics will love this film while fans of Laissez-faire economics will say ""Hey, the govt. was overinflated to begin with; just because the Neo-conservatives were wrong doesn't mean left-based policies are right.""The operative concept here is critical thinking.  One one hand, this country is in a recession because there was a war launched on the middle class... but the guy who made the film openly complained about his German-engineered (and Mexican-manufactured) automobile inStupid White Menwhile crying that Michigan was destroyed by the loss of manufacturing jobs in the automotive sector.

As a cure, however, Communism was worse than the disease, yet some of the worst capitalistic ills were still removed.  The corruption that often comes with big wealth has never gone away, but, as Michael Moore contends in his documentary, Capitalism:  A Love Story, it is more ruinous now than ever.The problems (as Moore presents them) are linked to the excessive ties between business and government, particularly (but not solely) under Reagan and Bush, Jr.  This resulted in a number of financial disasters, most significantly in 2008 when economic collapse seemed imminent.  But was there really the danger of collapse, or was it just another scheme by Goldman, Sachs, et al?For those familiar with Moore's narrative style, this movie will fit right in with other works such as Sicko and Farenheit 911.  Much as Moore is good at illustrating his points (often with humor), he has his flaws too.  For one thing, he meanders a lot and some of his most compelling issues - like companies taking life insurance policies out on employees and children being sent to institutions by a judge more interested in kickbacks than justice - are not followed through on very thoroughly.  Moore also tends to hold ""the people"" completely innocent (if a bit naive), ignoring the fact that many of them were spending money they shouldn't have.The movie presents Obama as the President who may turn things around, a promise that seems still up in the air right now.

1315910,A3CNM18PWKI1Z9,B0030Y11O2,Olga Bezhanova,"[4, 5]","First of all, I have to say that whatever you feel about his ideology, Michael Moore knows how to make good documentaries. Every frame offers a perfect conjunction of text and accompanying image. The documentary is as engaging as a good mystery film. This is simply very high-quality film-making.Most of the things Moore narrates are sadly familiar to all of us: foreclosures, businesses failing, unemployment, economically devastated areas that look worse than anything you can find in many third-world countries, the useless and horribly unfair bailouts, the back room deals by Paulson, Geithner, Bush and Co, Obama getting bought out by the same crowd of vile criminals the second he gets close to presidency. We have seen all this unfold, and it's impossible not to recognize that everything Moore shows is true. Many instances in the movie are touching and sad, while many others are hilarious (For example, Moore says after rereading the US Constitution: ""The Constitution doesn't mention capitalism. But it does talk about 'welfare' and 'union'. Wait, welfare and union? That sound like a very different -ism!"")Now, after all I have said in praise of Capitalism: A Love Story, I have to say that I disagree with Moore's central premise, which is capitalism is bad and it should be substituted by something better, namely democracy. I'm sure Moore understands extremely well that you can't substitute one with another since democracy is a political system and capitalism is an economic one. He uses the word ""democracy"" in order to avoid saying the word that scares the regular movie-going people, namely ""socialism.""To support his view that socialism is better, Moore tells a story of a business owned by all its workers together. Every decision is made jointly by the workers in a democratic-style voting process. I'm glad this system works for the company Moore describes in the movie. However, this could never work on a larger scale. If anything, a smooth running of his business is a huge exception. I, for one, do not want to run my place of work. It's not my job and I don't want it to be my job. Some people are good at being managers, organizers, and the leaders of people. Other people are not. Working collectively on a shared project is an impossible burden for some people. There is no doubt in my mind that not having one actual owner will bankrupt an absolute majority of businesses very soon.The reality that Moore doesn't address is that the current economic system in the US is not really capitalist. In many ways, it is eerily similar to the Soviet economy. In the Soviet Union, huge amounts of government money would go to bail out companies that could not survive on their own. If there were a real capitalism in the US, Goldman Sachs would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. The way capitalism works is that if you are inept enough to bankrupt your company, you are pushed off the market by more capable competitors. Goldman Sachs has long been completely incapable of an honest win over anybody else. They are kept in place by a complex system of Soviet-style handouts. This is as contrary to capitalism as anything can possibly be.In spite of disagreeing with Moore's ideas, I'm giving the movie five stars simply because nobody makes documentaries of such a high quality as he does.",5,Beautifully Made,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,3315,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'feel', 'ideology', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'how', 'make', 'good', 'documentaries', 'frame', 'perfect', 'conjunction', 'text', 'accompanying', 'image', 'documentary', 'as', 'engaging', 'good', 'mystery', 'film', 'simply', 'very', 'high-quality', 'film-making.Most', 'things', 'Moore', 'narrates', 'are', 'sadly', 'familiar', 'foreclosures', 'businesses', 'failing', 'unemployment', 'economically', 'devastated', 'areas', 'look', 'worse', 'anything', 'can', 'find', 'many', 'third-world', 'countries', 'useless', 'horribly', 'unfair', 'bailouts', 'back', 'room', 'deals', 'Paulson', 'Geithner', 'Bush', 'Co', 'Obama', 'getting', 'bought', 'out', 'same', 'crowd', 'vile', 'criminals', 'second', 'close', 'presidency', 'have', 'seen', 'unfold', 'impossible', 'not', 'recognize', 'everything', 'Moore', 'shows', 'true', 'Many', 'instances', 'movie', 'are', 'touching', 'sad', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'hilarious', 'example', 'Moore', 'rereading', 'US', 'Constitution', 'Constitution', ""n't"", 'mention', 'capitalism', 'talk', ""'welfare"", ""'union"", 'Wait', 'welfare', 'union', 'sound', 'very', 'different', '-ism', 'Now', 'have', 'said', 'praise', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', 'have', 'say', 'disagree', 'Moore', 'central', 'premise', 'capitalism', 'bad', 'should', 'be', 'substituted', 'something', 'better', 'namely', 'democracy', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Moore', 'extremely', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'substitute', 'one', 'democracy', 'political', 'system', 'capitalism', 'economic', 'one', 'word', 'democracy', 'order', 'avoid', 'saying', 'word', 'regular', 'movie-going', 'people', 'namely', 'socialism', 'support', 'view', 'socialism', 'better', 'Moore', 'story', 'business', 'owned', 'workers', 'together', 'decision', 'made', 'jointly', 'workers', 'democratic-style', 'voting', 'process', ""'m"", 'glad', 'system', 'company', 'Moore', 'movie', 'However', 'could', 'never', 'work', 'larger', 'scale', 'anything', 'smooth', 'running', 'business', 'huge', 'exception', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'run', 'place', 'work', 'not', 'job', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'job', 'people', 'are', 'good', 'being', 'managers', 'organizers', 'leaders', 'people', 'Other', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'Working', 'collectively', 'shared', 'project', 'impossible', 'burden', 'people', 'doubt', 'mind', 'not', 'having', 'one', 'actual', 'owner', 'will', 'bankrupt', 'absolute', 'majority', 'businesses', 'very', 'soon.The', 'reality', 'Moore', ""n't"", 'address', 'current', 'economic', 'system', 'US', 'not', 'really', 'capitalist', 'many', 'ways', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Soviet', 'economy', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'huge', 'amounts', 'government', 'money', 'would', 'go', 'bail', 'out', 'companies', 'could', 'not', 'survive', 'own', 'were', 'real', 'capitalism', 'US', 'Goldman', 'Sachs', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'bankrupt', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'way', 'capitalism', 'are', 'inept', 'enough', 'bankrupt', 'company', 'are', 'pushed', 'market', 'more', 'capable', 'competitors', 'Goldman', 'Sachs', 'long', 'been', 'completely', 'incapable', 'honest', 'win', 'anybody', 'else', 'are', 'kept', 'place', 'complex', 'system', 'Soviet-style', 'handouts', 'as', 'contrary', 'capitalism', 'anything', 'can', 'possibly', 'be.In', 'spite', 'disagreeing', 'Moore', 'ideas', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'simply', 'nobody', 'documentaries', 'high', 'quality']",N/A

Rios,"[31, 39]","i saw Capitalism by Michael Moore and this movie really hit a nevre.It's not just about Republicans or Democrats, it's about crooks on both sides of the issue. All are accountable in this current and ongoing financial mess.From Hannity's God-Ronald Regan himself, to Clinton and W, this was a never ending cycle not so much of capitalism, but of greed overall.Banks, Corporations, and money running this country. The Treasury department full of AIG people allowing fellow competition to fail while fattening their own pockets and that of their friends.All are accountable. This movie really hits home when you see every day people being jived by the very people designed to take care of them. People loosing their homes and being thrown into the streets, one Congress-woman fired up with all the shenanigans going on while at the same time, leading Democrats are making back door deals with Bush and the Republican parties not for the betterment of the country, but for their own re-election.The outcry became, do nothing, jobs are lost, economy collapses. So in their own personal survival greed, the Congress reached across the board and bailed the very banks who brought us to the brink of economic armageddon, only to see those banks payout their own bonuses before anything else.In the true world of Capitalism, if you fail, you fail. Nobody bails out homeowners who lose their homes and are thrown into the street. Capitalism in reality is survival of the fittest, and yet here, when the Banks and mortgage companies failed, the Congress, not the people, bailed them out.Moore's film is not only the best of his films i've ever seen, but it's also the most frustrating to watch knowing what happened.",5,very good....and very upsetting,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,1706,"['i', 'saw', 'Capitalism', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'movie', 'really', 'hit', 'nevre.It', 'not', 'just', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'crooks', 'sides', 'issue', 'are', 'accountable', 'current', 'ongoing', 'financial', 'mess.From', 'Hannity', 'God-Ronald', 'Regan', 'Clinton', 'W', 'was', 'never', 'ending', 'cycle', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'capitalism', 'greed', 'overall.Banks', 'Corporations', 'money', 'running', 'country', 'Treasury', 'department', 'full', 'AIG', 'people', 'allowing', 'fellow', 'competition', 'fail', 'fattening', 'own', 'pockets', 'friends.All', 'are', 'accountable', 'movie', 'really', 'home', 'when', 'see', 'day', 'people', 'being', 'jived', 'very', 'people', 'designed', 'take', 'care', 'People', 'loosing', 'homes', 'being', 'thrown', 'streets', 'one', 'Congress-woman', 'fired', 'up', 'shenanigans', 'going', 'same', 'time', 'leading', 'Democrats', 'are', 'making', 'back', 'door', 'deals', 'Bush', 'Republican', 'parties', 'not', 'betterment', 'country', 'own', 're-election.The', 'outcry', 'became', 'do', 'nothing', 'jobs', 'are', 'lost', 'economy', 'collapses', 'So', 'own', 'personal', 'survival', 'greed', 'Congress', 'reached', 'board', 'bailed', 'very', 'banks', 'who', 'brought', 'brink', 'economic', 'armageddon', 'only', 'see', 'banks', 'payout', 'own', 'bonuses', 'anything', 'else.In', 'true', 'world', 'Capitalism', 'fail', 'fail', 'Nobody', 'out', 'homeowners', 'who', 'lose', 'homes', 'are', 'thrown', 'street', 'Capitalism', 'reality', 'survival', 'fittest', 'yet', 'here', 'when', 'Banks', 'mortgage', 'companies', 'failed', 'Congress', 'not', 'people', 'bailed', 'out.Moore', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'films', 'i', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'most', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened']",N/A
1315912,A1118PDWF1TE0C,B0030Y11O2,Oshram,"[0, 2]","It can be difficult even reviewing a Michael Moore film, because people tend to have a strong reaction to the man's very name, let alone his work. Objectivity can be difficult, because Moore is not exactly subtle with his political and social stances, or really with much of anything else. In that regard Capitalism is much like his other works, in that he employs a mixture of historical footage, personal interviews, grandstanding publicity stunts and loaded voice-overs to make his points. I suspect much of how one responds to Moore's work greatly depends upon how close one's politics are to the filmmaker's. Fortunately for me, mine line up almost a hundred per cent.Moore's target this time is to attempt to answer the question, ""what the hell went wrong with America?"" And the answer is, to distill a two-hour movie down to a single word, greed. He traces the unleashing of the greed culture (spurred on by guess which president, and no, it's not Nixon?) through its development in the last three decades, all culminating with the damage it's doing the country now. As with all Moore pieces, he also shows some small pockets of brave citizens doing their part to resist the tide of corporate greed and inhumanity, and like his other works his most effective scenes are where he interviews the victims (a family who is paid a thousand dollars to clean out their own foreclosed home make especially troublesome watching).There's little I can add in the way of an actual review - most people are aware of how Michael Moore makes films and what his agenda is, save that here (like in his book Dude, Where's My Country?) he's trying to wake people up into action. How successful that will be, I don't know; we are after all largely a nation of dead-eyed suburbanites who, to quote 1776, would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor. And no doubt there are (predominantly) conservatives who are pooh-poohing this film and waving their Tea Party signs while they scream about encroaching socialism; but if your brain isn't completely closed to logic and reason and you wondered why America's in such a dismal state, well, this movie will explain it to you simply and clearly. Rarely have I seen such a direct distillation of what is wrong with this nation so straightforwardly expressed; if I had any say, I'd make this film required viewing. That might expose some people to ideas that don't conform to their belief system, I guess, but if even one person has his mind opened by watching this film, then Moore has done his job. But, just like most Moore films, the people who really need to see it never will simply because it has his name on it.",5,Possibly Moore's Best Work Ever,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,2693,"['can', 'be', 'difficult', 'even', 'reviewing', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'film', 'people', 'tend', 'have', 'strong', 'reaction', 'man', 'very', 'name', 'let', 'alone', 'work', 'Objectivity', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'Moore', 'not', 'exactly', 'subtle', 'political', 'social', 'stances', 'really', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'regard', 'Capitalism', 'much', 'other', 'works', 'mixture', 'historical', 'footage', 'personal', 'interviews', 'grandstanding', 'publicity', 'stunts', 'loaded', 'voice-overs', 'make', 'points', 'suspect', 'much', 'how', 'one', 'Moore', 'work', 'greatly', 'how', 'close', 'one', 'politics', 'are', 'filmmaker', 'Fortunately', 'mine', 'line', 'up', 'almost', 'hundred', 'cent.Moore', 'target', 'time', 'attempt', 'answer', 'question', 'what', 'hell', 'went', 'wrong', 'America', 'answer', 'distill', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'down', 'single', 'word', 'greed', 'unleashing', 'greed', 'culture', 'spurred', 'guess', 'president', 'not', 'Nixon', 'development', 'last', 'three', 'decades', 'culminating', 'damage', 'doing', 'country', 'now', 'Moore', 'pieces', 'also', 'small', 'pockets', 'brave', 'citizens', 'doing', 'part', 'resist', 'tide', 'corporate', 'greed', 'inhumanity', 'other', 'most', 'effective', 'scenes', 'are', 'where', 'victims', 'family', 'who', 'paid', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'clean', 'out', 'own', 'foreclosed', 'home', 'make', 'especially', 'troublesome', 'watching', 'little', 'can', 'add', 'way', 'actual', 'review', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'how', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'what', 'agenda', 'save', 'here', 'book', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Country', 'trying', 'wake', 'people', 'up', 'action', 'How', 'successful', 'will', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'largely', 'nation', 'dead-eyed', 'suburbanites', 'who', 'quote', '1776', 'would', 'rather', 'protect', 'possibility', 'becoming', 'rich', 'face', 'reality', 'being', 'poor', 'doubt', 'are', 'predominantly', 'conservatives', 'who', 'are', 'pooh-poohing', 'film', 'waving', 'Tea', 'Party', 'signs', 'scream', 'encroaching', 'socialism', 'brain', ""n't"", 'completely', 'closed', 'logic', 'reason', 'wondered', 'why', 'America', 'such', 'dismal', 'state', 'well', 'movie', 'will', 'explain', 'simply', 'clearly', 'Rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'direct', 'distillation', 'what', 'wrong', 'nation', 'so', 'straightforwardly', 'expressed', 'had', 'say', ""'d"", 'make', 'film', 'required', 'viewing', 'might', 'expose', 'people', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'conform', 'belief', 'system', 'guess', 'even', 'one', 'person', 'mind', 'opened', 'watching', 'film', 'then', 'Moore', 'done', 'job', 'just', 'most', 'Moore', 'films', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'never', 'will', 'simply', 'name']",N/A

1315916,A3AY9OT5NG38O0,B0030Y11O2,political idiot,"[9, 14]","I put off watching this DVD until last weekend because I wanted to wait for it to come out on DVD.As far as documentary making goes this film it is an incoherent mess.  To be fair, Moore has never been a top drawer documentary film maker -he never claimed to be one.  I cut him a lot of slack most of the time because some of his stuff is entertaining, but this one is especially sloppy.  I think his hate for the America we now have resulted in some poor decision making.  While I agree with his dislike of the America we have become, my discomfort comes from a very different place.  Most annoying is the silly charge upon GM head quarters and the cartoonish antics like the crime tape stuff.  Enough already.Ultimately Moore's unsupported thesis is that socialism provides a more democratic and fair economic system and that the European model of a government controlled economic, medical, and social security system should be adopted in the US.Oddly enough, as if to present balance, he has his actor friend Wallace Shawn at the beginning the film describe why a classic economic reading of free market capitalism is superior (not a panacea mind you) to socialism.  In short, a free capitalist market is the most efficient and democratic way to determine demand for goods and services --not a government bureaucracy which leads to waste, corruption, inequity, and in many cases throughout history, genocide.  I appreciated that concise few minutes of the film even if it was only offered as a nod to fair documentary journalism.  Unfortunately Moore never returns to the theory and its clear validation through the American experience.All Moore proceeds to do for the next ninety minutes is claim capitalism is evil by illustrating the seemingly endless collusion of corrupt government officials and corporate CEOs.  The basic tenant of Moore's argument (and all pro-socialists) is that free market capitalism is a zero sum game i.e. for every winner there is a loser.  That is simply not true and a great myth perpetrated by all socialists in an effort to support their beliefs.  All of Moore's ""zero sum"" examples illustrated problems associated with big government, political corruption, and theft among the elite.  He offered ZERO proof that capitalism or free markets are the problem.  It becomes painfully clear very early on in the film that Michael Moore (as many reviews on this thread also demonstrate just reading their reviews) has no idea what free market capitalism IS!In a cloud of ignorance so thick you can smell the stink, Michael Moore spends most of the film telling us all what we already know: that big government programs like the trillion dollar TARP bailout of big corporations was evil...Gee Michael, NO KIDDING!!  But the corrupt tentacles that connect the US Treasury to Goldman Sachs and all over Congress have nothing to do with capitalism or free markets.  It is called cronyism and corruption -things birthed naturally from big government!In the end, Michael Moore fails to produce one single piece of evidence to prove that free market capitalism is the evil he wants it to be.  If Moore had refocused his effort on the real evil (big government) and re-titled his documentary then he would have been taken more seriously.  Unfortunately all Moore can do in the end is prop up a dusty old socialist democrat Bernie Sanders and extol him as the man with the answers to all of our problems.  Moore goes further down the rabbit hole and laments the death of high paying union jobs and benefits.  He then puts the cherry on top of the socialist soda with the ""hero of the stupid,"" FDR, as his proof that democratic socialism works.  Are you kidding me?  FDR and LBJ created the welfare state.  Social Security and Medicare are massive Ponzi failures for everyone except a few early recipients who paid little and are getting great returns.  Future generations will get NOTHING.  We are now paying severely for these and other welfare policies by way of misinterpretation of Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution, AKA the General welfare clause.  BTW, just for the record, every modern Republican president has failed to address these issues as well -proving that all politicians are just one party united by corruption driven to steal from you and me in an effort to eliminate rights and liberties and enrich themselves.Like any high school dropout filmmaker, Moore lacks the critical thinking skills necessary to put together a truly interesting documentary.  He offers only false cause and effect fallacies and one side of the low hanging fruit known as emotional arguments.  He provides absolutely no analysis of the killing machine he so wants to emulate --the massive unemployment and unsustainable debt in socialist Europe, the inhumane living conditions, practices, and policies of communist Cuba and Venezuela, and of course the natural extension of Soviet and Chinese communism that produced mass genocide.  At one point Moore limply holds up Japan as an example of a well oiled government/private symbiosis.  Oooppps, wrong again Michael.  Japan has been in a massive recession since the late nineties and their government pension system is failing faster than ours.Sorry Michael, free market capitalism may have a few problems and may need a little tweaking here and there, but it is by far the most advancing, egalitarian, and humane economic system ever tried.  Lastly, let's just look at the facts: the countries with the freest markets are the most advanced.  Countries with the least free markets are third world countries.Bottom line: Michael Moore has failed to make a documentary that any thinking person can take seriously.  Moore offers no new model or new ideas, just a retread of old silly socialist myths.  This film is an obtuse mosaic that fails to make any real point other than government corruption is everywhere.  For that you need only to read the newspaper every day.  Two stars only for the kernel of truth Moore stumbled upon but didn't develop.

This time, he's addressed the economic crisis in America and the battle between Wall Street and Main Street. While some may disagree with his flamboyant presentation, Moore takes dry subjects and adds interest and humanity. Is the film slanted, yes; however, in the places where Moore states factual numbers, those statements are verifiable. For example, the top 1% of the wealthiest have more assets than the other 99%.Unfortunately, that top one percent wants to keep it that way and they have so far had the means to do so.  The key topic of this film is unrestrained capitalism resulting in unrestrained greed. As Machiavelli stated, ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely.""Some examples of capitalistic misuse of power:Privatization for profit:  The concept of private versus public goods is detailed very well in the case of a juvenile detention center which was privatized in Wilkes Barre, PA. Taxpayers ended up spending $58M for the detention center.  Due to collusion between juvenile judges and the private owners of the center, youths had less than 5 minutes before the bench prior to sentencing for months in detention. Key to this is that neither a judge nor probation worker determined when the kids were to be released--that was left up to an employee of the center who answered to no one but their private sector boss.""Dead Peasant"" insurance:  In these instances, major employers take out life insurance policies on their employees to the extent that their 'human resources' are worth more to them dead than alive.In addition to cases like these, Moore discusses the bailouts, unique work situations and how the people of Main Street are taking back their own power.Moore states his case for the people Main Street in a cogent, compassionate, and entertaining fashion.

Knox,"[2, 4]","Michael Moore's CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY begins with a clip from the trailerfor Herschell Gordon Lewis' infamous BLOOD FEAST, which warns the audience ofwhat they are about to see. But, what you will see in this movie will botheryou far more than any campy gorefest could- that is, if you have half a brain,and care at all about what happens to America and its citizens.CAPITALISM shows how Big Business has run roughshod over The Rest Of Us,and has been, for the last thirty-odd years, aided and abetted by our oldpals, The U.S. Government. And, lest you think that only the right wing is inMoore's crosshairs, he makes it clear that Democrats AND Republicans areequally to blame for facilitating The Swindling of America.My favorite moment in the average Moore film is The Big Confrontation, inwhich Moore has cornered someone who is clearly a swine, and knows it, andknows that we all know it, but puts on airs of respectability anyway. I'lladmit to taking a great deal of pleasure in watching such swine squirm. InCAPITALISM, however, you don't really see that. Mr. Moore is so well-knownnowadays that no one with any guilty secrets will deign to talk to him.So, this movie employs more interviews with various people who are close tothe problem- even the Catholic Church puts in its two cents' worth. And, asalways, Moore's use of clips from divers sources in order to illustrate hispoint is masterful and frequently very amusing.This DVD has a whole movie's worth of special features, and they are worthseeing, as they expand upon various persons and situations that are coveredin the main movie. Included is a 1979 TV speech by then-President Carterthat actually could have been made yesterday...it's just that relevant.If you can watch CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY and not find yourself Mad As HellAnd Not Going To Take It Anymore, you either have a case of Terminal TunnelVision, or you are actually part of the problem.

Yes, Moore does make some good (and valid) points here and there, but it's a ""borderline"" documentary . . . . for the most part, capitalists either are unwilling to talk to Moore or, perhaps, pro-capitalism interviews may have been left on the editing room floor.  As a result, Moore's film does not provide a well balanced view point; instead, it manipulates the emotions of its audience by focusing on some of those people who Moore believes have been victimized by the capitalistic system.The DVD, from Anchor Bay, is well produced.  In addition to the feature film, there are 80 minutes of additional material, mostly ""talking heads"" speaking about the evils of capitalism, which appear to have been filmed simultaneously with the movie, but it's obvious that most of these extra segmants would have dragged the pace of the film down and their inclusion as extras on the DVD appears to be a good choice.

I get it - it's a metaphor. It's a lousy metaphor... and it goes south from there.A 1950s education reel follows, narrating the history of the Roman Empire. When mention of despots, embarrassment, etc. are mentioned, the film quickly chops in film footage of Cheney and/or George W. Bush. I will say one thing for Moore (actually, I will say several)... he isn't hiding how he feels.This is a sheep feed film. This is the type of film you show to sheep who already buy into the message - it's the perfect diet of 'hate the establishment' with a side order of 'the man is putting us down' and a heaping helping of socialism. It's a great film to indoctrinate young, impressionable minds that are hypnotized into thinking they're thinking for themselves, when all they are doing is being good zombie goons for the left.From the first four minutes of the film, I started getting nauseated... probably vertigo induced from non-stop eye rolling on my part.Next, we see well-edited video of foreclosures... anyone can be sympathetic. Your heart pounds as the sheriff bangs on the door and finally breaks the doorjamb to force the former owners out of the house. You think of how terrifying it would be to be forced out of your home. This is not Nazi Germany where the government comes to your house and relocates you because of your heritage or political stance - this is America.

Bad things happen to good people, but only 8 minutes into the movie a man proposes that those with little will have to rise up to take what belongs to those who are affluent. Look out, Michael Moore, they're gonna come after your millions, too!While it's sad to see people lose everything - material things, anyway, there are consequences to actions. If you lose a job and can't find one, you can live on your savings while you look for other avenues to survive instead of waiting until they are coming to kick you out. The people here have lots of things they spent money on - things they didn't necessarily need, money that went to dust catchers instead of savings. Now they pout and whine about how people are taking advantage of them instead of picking themselves up by their bootstraps and taking advantage of our capitalistic way of life - where the world is your oyster if you will simply work and work hard.Moore says, ""this is capitalism: a system of giving and taking - mostly taking."" Moore is certainly free to his opinion, even if it's asinine.Moore either suffers from the delusion or simply exploits it... the delusion that capitalism and greed are synonyms. Clearly by Moore's figure, he is one that never got the concept of ""eat the meat and spit out the bones."" He's gone beyond throwing the baby out with the bath water - he wants to hold the baby under until it drowns, decomposes and finally is indistinguishable from the bathwater. He blames America's success because America obliterated the competition in the bombings of Germany and Japan during World War II. A reminder to Moore - America was dragged into the war. Had American not ended the war, Moore would be speaking German or Japanese right now, and not enjoying the freedom that capitalism offers him.The recurring motif is - every time some one becomes successful in America, a kitten dies.The greed of corporate America is Ronald Reagan's fault, too... just in case you missed the memo.When highlighting the corruption by a crooked judge and entrepreneur, who both went to prison for committing their crimes, Moore states that capitalism defeated democracy. No - criminals broke the law and innocent people were hurt. The criminals exploited the system, and innocent people were hurt. That's life. Capitalism is not the villain here.What's sad is that Moore is an able filmmaker. In this film, he exposes a jaw-dropping scam in which companies take out life insurance policies on their employees without their knowledge or consent... yet he links this as a problem with capitalism. This is like blaming ice cream companies for obesity. The problem is corporate greed and malfeasance. I'd like Moore to make a film just on this one scam - he could really blow the lid off this problem and expose it to the light - but no, he would rather demonize the American way of life because he is blinded by his hatred for Bush, Reagan and anyone other than him making obscene profits.... unless of course, they're paying 90% in tax.Moore is an apt storyteller, even if his stories are only 10% truth.Big shock... in the end, the Messiah of this tale is B. Hussein Obama. Remember Obama's discussion with Joe the Plumber, in which he says he wants to ""spread the wealth""? The same conversation that Obama later tap-danced around? Moore shows it as a virtue - that socialism (whether or not you call it that or not) is the cure for the disease he calls capitalism. Taking the role of John the Baptist is FDR.What I'm always fascinated with is why these rabid socialists today, like Moore, choose to live here instead of living in North Korea, China. Cuba or Ethiopia. Oh yeah - it's because socialism has turned those countries in to heaps of starving nothing. No innovation, no food, and no freedom. The neo-commies like Moore want the God-less Utopia that socialism promises (but never delivers), but without giving up on THEIR freedom to say what they want, without giving up on iPods and other innovations that capitalism gives them, without giving up an infrastructure of highways, sewage control. They want all the promises that socialism claims to offer, but they want the freedom capitalism gives them ... even though the two are incompatible.In the end, Moore states in his narration, ""I refuse to live in a country like this... and I'm not leaving."" Be afraid. Be very afraid. There are others that buy into this drivel and they vote (sometimes more than once) and sit on juries.",1,Self-indulgent whine-fest of America hating,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,6321,"['Michael',

1315935,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B0030Y11O2,Steffan Piper,"[4, 6]","There really isn't much more to say once you see this film. You should be mad and actually downright on the verge of taking up arms and forming community 'groups' for lack of a better term to do something about some of this, but ...you won't.And that's the saddest reality and the most painful message in all of this. Add in that the folks that Michael Moore is talking about have successfully turned his name into a symbol of the ultimate pariah making this very clear message even harder to be acknowledged, injested and acted upon.The infrastructure that Moore is reporting upon used to run in fear that this kind of information would be privvy to the mainstream media, but these days they've already figured where everybody stands, how much stomach most people have to fight and by keeping everyone hard at work, it'll make it harder for them to seek out the barest amount of respect in the world for themselves and their families. They know that - for you - the viewer, it's just more consumable media that you'll entertain yourselves with so that you can sleep in a numb haze at night and forget that this place is really in for darker times in the near short term.I read most of the negative reviews of this film and it really is hard to nay-say the information or try to GOP coat-tail and uphold the 'dead peasant' insurance policies, the massive lay-off's during economic booms and the out-right unethical looting that took place by Wall Street ... unless of course you're Tucker Carlson or some other emotionally detached human being with a huge trust-fund or just grossly uneducated in common sense or basic ecomonics.The fact that this film has been out for some time and a lot of people have never even seen it, or wanted to see it, should be an indication as to what's really going on around us. Yes, I finally included myself in this.There's a scene where a little dog is jumping up and down at the dinner table hoping for some food scraps from their owner to fall their way and Moore equates those folks struggling for their vision of the American Dream to be that dog, and the bankers and corporations are the people looking at the dog and doing everything they can to keep the dog in its place. Quite fitting and quite simple.It doesn't matter how you feel about Michale Moore, because you should put that aside and watch this film. You'll learn that he, too, is an American and his father worked in an American factory his whole life giving Michael and his siblings the ideal American life. Michael started his life in film-making by trying to document what went on in the Automobile industry during the Reagan years and which now, has come full circle and fully played itself out - and in the worst possible scenario imaginable.This is a really difficult film to watch because Ronald Reagan isn't the hero, Jimmy Carter becomes the  voice of doom, the death of FDR becomes the turning point in American History for the worst, Bill Clinton sets up some of the pieces of the puzzle that makes the nightmare possible and George Bush just doubles down on all of it multiplying our troubles ad infinitum. This is not a happy film and you're left to just hate the situation and all those involved and there is no answer at the end. This whole thing goes down like Henry V, but with a horrible outcome where Scroop, Grey and Westmoreland actually succeed in selling out the country for loose coin.The film is like the Chimes at Midnight.

Moore is an American film maker, author, and liberal political commentator.This film focuses on the financial crisis of (2007 to 2010) and the recovery stimulus.  It examines the current economic order in the United States and capitalism in general.(Capitalism is an economic system where the means of production and distribution are privately owned and operated for profit.)General topics covered in this film include:(1) Wall Street's ""casino mentality""(2) for-profit prisons(3) Goldman Sachs' influences in Washington, DC.  (Goldman Sachs is a very financially successful global investment banking and securities firm)(4) the poverty level wages of many workers.  (Example: why do we have an economic system ""that allows a pilot to be paid less than a manger at Taco Bell?"")(5) the large number of home foreclosures. (A foreclosure is a legal procedure that may require forced sale of property.)(6) the consequences of ""runaway greed.""There is even a religious component to this documentary.  Here, Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a sin and if Jesus would be a capitalist!!Yes, this film has Moore's sometimes corny humour but I feel this film will leave viewers with much to ponder and debate.Be sure to watch the end credits.  Interspersed between them are facts and quotes.  My two favourite quotes are:(1) ""I sincerely believe...that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.""  (Thomas Jefferson, 1816)(2) ""It's class warfare, my class is winning but they shouldn't be."" (Warren Buffet, world's richest person, 2007)This documentary has grossed over sixteen million dollars as of the date of this review.Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2010) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has several interesting extras.In conclusion, this is an unforgettable and sometimes shocking documentary.  Moore concludes at its end that ""Capitalism is evil.""  I DISAGREE.

1315941,A2ICYTQK3ZCX0Z,B0030Y11O2,The Great Rocky Hill,"[232, 267]","""Capitalism"" opens with disclaimer from some old film, and then segues into scenes from police videos of people robbing banks and convenience stores. Moore likes to make comparisons. In this case he wants to show us who the real thieves are, and they don't tend to be desperate drug addicts wearing hoodies.To me that's what Moore's latest film is: a cinematic treatise on crime. Moore uses his excellent skills as an editor to piece together films in a manner that makes you want to scream ""Where does he find this stuff?"" to paint a telling picture of what America is: a plutocracy. And yes, Mike uses that word and wants us all to learn it, even providing a definition straight out of a textbook.What Moore also excels at is humanizing crises and the class war by showing us just who's affected by these forces and why. We're shown people, real people being thrown out of their homes, being pushed out of their jobs, being paid meager salaries to do dangerous, complicated work, and being informed that companies profited from the deaths of their loved ones through something called ""dead peasant insurance.""He even speaks to various clergy to try and find any sort of modern moral justification for capitalism. He can't. One priest even goes as far as to state flatly that ""Capitalism is radically evil.""Yeah.Speaking of all things radical, Moore puts himself on the line by trying to raid the offices of financial institutions, implores us to do the same, and backs that strategy up by showing current examples of how dissent and popular revolt can turn the tables on the gluttons in power, even if those victories are as small as one family being allowed to stay in their foreclosed home and window factory workers given severance payments after a long sit-in.However, what ""Capitalism"" isn't is a mere bleeding-heart piece that is all emotion. Mike tends to do his homework. And that's what makes him a firebrand. The evidence is laid bare for the viewer to see.There are some who would call Michael Moore and his documentaries ""anti-American."" He's even told by one Wall Streeter to ""stop making movies"" when trying to get an accurate definition of what are called ""derivatives.""  Although I would definitely call Moore a subversive, I challenge anyone to find an ounce of hatred towards America in this piece. No, Michael Moore loves America, but his America is made up of those who toil and have little or nothing. His America is being looted by people that can only be described as white-collar sociopaths who would be selling heroin or whoring out young girls had they not been brought up in wealthy families.You also get a generous serving of Michael's trademark humor to make it all go down easier. It has been said that the best way to take the powerful down a peg or two is by poking fun at them, and Moore doesn't just poke at them, he runs them through with swords of bitingly comedic steel.If I had one gripe about ""Capitalism"" it would be that there was so much more ground that could have been covered. That's why I feel that a sequel is in order as well as a prequel since Moore rather glosses over earlier American history. But I suppose that's what he have Howard Zinn for.Yes, this is a paramount polemic against capitalism and dare I say FOR socialism. Even Bernie Sanders gets some facetime.As someone who has been identifying as a socialist for years, I can say that it only reinforced my belief that the free market is unsustainable, as if my personal experience as an American worker hasn't been enough to do so. Demons lurk in the details though, and Moore not only shines a light of veracity on them, he also splashes them with holy water, as any left-leaning Catholic such as Moore would.Christ wasn't a capitalist sympathizer, something Moore also shows us, and neither is Moore himself. So why should you be? It's not in your best interests to be one. Think of this as an intervention by way of motion picture for your friends and family who are thoroughly in love with an abusive spouse that is all take and no give.Talk about a great candidate for an ABC Sunday Night Movie. If I could hold screenings for ""Capitalism"" I would. It needs to be seen by far more people than any action/adventure blockbuster.Thanks for makin' the devils hiss, Mike.

As the film progresses and we're shown numerous examples of families thrown out of their houses, factory workers laid off without warning, and taxpayers shelling out billions to bail out banks, it becomes apparent that capitalism itself isn't to blame, but rather the avaricious few who abuse the policies and corrupt those in power. As it exposes the guilty further lining their pockets, it also offers plenty of hope, emphasizing the minor and major rebellions that prove that change is just around the corner. And for many frightened CEO's, so is Michael Moore, with his intimidating microphone and a demand for answers.No stranger to tackling the big issues, documentarian Michael Moore takes on capitalism and the reasons behind America's recent economic ""meltdown"". Beginning in Rome and bringing us up to date with the recession, the purported evils of capitalism are compared to everything from vultures to Vegas casinos, and its negative impact blamed for death profiteering, predatorial bank lending, and the eventual downfall of democracy. But with the depressing realizations of a good system gone wrong, Moore invokes his trademark brand of clever humor, creative editing, and a little grandstanding pizzazz.Michael Moore has reached a point of notoriousness that unfortunately prevents his opposition from ever seeing his material. Sadly, only those who admire his political viewpoints are likely to see Capitalism: A Love Story, and those who despise his ostentatious methods will avoid it outright. While his style of documenting facts is slanted at best, the way he edits his films is fascinating and highly entertaining. Instilled with plenty of humor, the largely depressing topics become resoundingly more absorbable, and are unquestionably important. Grand, thundering music highlights his focal points, frequently increasing the hilarity or aiding in the finger-pointing. At times it's thrilling, tear-jerking, comedic, and thought-provoking, but always educational.Capitalism is essentially the pursuit of the American Dream and it didn't set out to be evil. It was a good intention that only spiraled downward when it started to negatively control democracy. The rich want to stay rich, so the poor have no choice but to stay poor. Too bad the rich control the government and getting a piece of the wealth pie requires deciphering the foreign language of Wall Street. Moore presents many stances on democracy, socialism, taking advantage of others' misfortunes, profit motives, free enterprise, employers profiting on the deaths of their workers, propaganda, the Senate Housing Committee's failure to police mortgage scams and other white collar crimes, and bail outs, but ultimately the real villain is self-indulgence, consumption and greed.

1315944,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0030Y11O2,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 4]","Michael Moore seems to have sixth sense ability when he makes each of his films. Each new movie hits the multiplexes in a timely fashion, tapping into the zeitgeist surrounding what the story is attempting to explore, what the filmmaker wants to make the public aware of. With ""Capitalism: A Love Story"", Moore releases a film about the financial collapse of the United States while the collapse is still going on, while everyone is still feeling the affects of the meltdown. This should surely attract more than a few curious filmgoers and will hopefully expand Moore's ardent and loyal fan base.That said, I didn't love ""Capitalism"". It's a good film, an interesting story, but it fails to connect with the viewer in the same way his other films, ""Bowling for Columbine"", ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" or ""Sicko"" connect.It is a mistake to call Moore a documentarian. He explores various aspects of an idea, usually political, presenting various 'human interest' stories to support his thesis. He can't get anyone with an opposing viewpoint to talk to him because his tactics are too well known. I really think he is more of a film essayist.Given that his films follow more or less the same formula most broadcast news programs cover, it seems more than a little ironic when these same programs attack him for bending the truth. Can any news program be called ""fair and balanced""? Can any news program go into any significant depth when they are so concerned with presenting 'human interest' stories about little kids flying in runaway balloons or in showing video of cats flushing toilets.If you have seen any previous Moore films, this film, which also marks the 20tth anniversary of the release of his first film ""Roger & Me"", will seem familiar. Moore interviews various common folk involved in the larger picture he is trying to portray. These folks are victims and their stories often tug at our heartstrings. He also tries to interview politicians, business executives, lawmakers, anyone who is involved at a higher level. He actually gets a couple of elected officials to talk to him on camera, but these people are sympathetic to the cause. These interviews are mixed in with archival footage, news footage, charts, graphics and more all designed to help bolster Moore's arguments. And because Moore can't get anyone at a higher level to talk to him (with the exception of Charlton Heston in ""Bowling for Columbine"") he usually includes a few 'stunts' designed to create laughter in the audience.There are two things that really make the best Michael Moore films stand out. First, his interviews with the common folk involved usually are so heart wrenching we leave the theater infuriated and ready to act. These people have been dumped on, big time, by circumstances beyond their control. In ""Capitalism"", we watch as a couple have to deal with being evicted from the wife's family property. The husband and some family members hastily box their belongings and stuff them into a truck. They don't have anywhere to go, but they are leaving a property that has been in the wife's family for decades. Then the sheriff shows up to evict them. But the husband explains that they are supposed to have thirty days to pack up. The sheriff is confused and makes some calls.We also watch as another family goes through the eviction process. Moore's cameras are inside their house as we hear them talk and watch multiple sheriffs' deputies pull up to the house. Then, the pounding on the doors begins. The man of the house calls the sheriff and tells him they will leave, but they have to come in and get them, there are also four people in the house. Soon, the doors come down.These are powerful moments, but he doesn't really show anyone else or any other affect of this financial crisis on the common man, on the people of ""Main Street"".Another thing Moore always does well is to introduce us to people we never knew existed. In ""Capitalism"", we meet a real estate agent who works in Florida. He owns a company called Condo Vultures and tells us about the people who are vultures, buying up foreclosure properties for pennies on the dollar to resell it later at a profit. As he talks about what he does, he seems to have slight scorn and contempt for the people he works for. We watch as he shows two different condos to the same guy. But as we watch, we can't help but realize that this guy is capitalizing off of the vultures, making money when they do. Yet, he doesn't seem to realize his affect on society.Moore is also good at uncovering facts and little pieces of information that tend to make the viewer's blood boil. This is where ""Capitalism"" falters. As an avid ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"" fan, most of the shocking material Moore 'uncovers' has already been covered by Jon Stewart and ""Saturday Night Live"". For instance, in the original TARP bill was making its way through Congress, then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson included a provision in his very short bill preventing anyone from reviewing his decisions and bringing criminal action against him. This bill, thankfully, did not pass.""Capitalism: A Love Story"" is sure to get your blood boiling, by reiterating much of the information you probably already know. But because Moore doesn't provide anything new or startling, anything revealing or telling, the film doesn't seem as memorable as his previous works.Also, the stunt moments seem both oddly placed and a little sophomoric. Moore drives an armored truck up to some of the banks that received bail out money and takes a large bag (marked with a huge dollar sign no less) and demands out money back. Since he can't get in the buildings, he interacts with security guards who are simply doing as they were told. Considering they probably make about $7 per hour, these people are not the criminals. So the joke seems a little lost. Yet, Moore tries to milk it, tries to get some sort of response out of them.Later, he returns and starts to string crime scene tape across the whole of Wall Street. That is a better idea; a more telling statement, but it seems almost lost as the film is coming to an end.",4,"3 1/2 - Not Moore's Best, But Still Interesting",1255824000,"10 18,

1315945,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B0030Y11O2,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[4, 7]","But there was much less entertainment value in the subject matter.The story starts with people losing their homes--some of them in the famlies for generations--to foreclosure. Moore narrates this film more than showing himself doing some of the more outrageous maneuvers for which is is justifiably famous. He describes first that refinancing was marketed as the way to go. You need some money for a vacation? For some needs around the house? Refinance. But the fine print issued by those lending the money was really fine. And people found themselves with an affordable mortgage which grew, and grew, until the home owner simply couldn't afford it any more. Than s/he lost the home. (In an early case, there were four members of a family in their house. Seven cars from the sheriff's dept. came by to evict the residents!)There has been quite a lot of controversy over such ""sub prime"" loans. We tend to look at the person who took out the loan as irresponsible if not completely stupid for having bought into something they couldn't afford. Moore cites a study which indicates that 80 percent of the problem was the responsibility of those (wealthy) who made the loans, not those who got the loans.And there's more. He talked with a number of homeowners whose spouses died in the meantime. That was a kind of supplement to his film ""Sicko."" Bills become impossible to pay; a family member is sick and the sickness therefore goes untreated and the victim dies simply for lack of money.Further still, it seems some of our country's major employers--not fly-by-night outfits but some of the wealthiest corporations in history--also had taken out life insurance policies on their employees who were ill. So, not only did the employee die because of lack of ""resources,"" but his or her employee made a lot of money off the employee!How low CAN one go?The story then proceeds into that period late in the Bush administration. After Jimmy Carter told us we need to care for ourselves, and perhaps make a sacrifice or two, Reagan rode into town and deregulated everything. I particularly liked the scene where Don Regan, Reagan's chief of staff and CEO of one of the most powerful corporations in history, told Reagan he had to speed up his speech (which had begun to drag.) By the time Bush II was in office, the system was in the process of falling apart.The film was astute in pointing out issues that the ""MSM"" didn't: There was Democratic resistance to the bail-out, and at first it didn't pass. But then pressure was put on leading Democrats and some of the wealthiest among us had the US taxpayer cover up for their blunders. Afterwards, the taxpayer also covered their execs' private, luxury jets, their bonuses. You have to see it to believe it.It's hard to do the film justice in mere words. It's important that you see the film. I gave it only 4-stars partly because I expected it to be a tad more ""entertaining."" One of Michael's techniques that he uses astutely in this film--and entertainingly--is to attempt citizen's arrests of the CEOs of many of the investment firms we've bailed out. He wraps a crime scene tape around I think it was AIG at the end--to the dismay of the employees and security staff of the company. Of course it's completely symbolic, but funny, and he makes his point very clearly.And Moore had some credible sources. One was responsible for the S&L; disaster a few years ago. Some of the others I admire. For instance, Micheal talked to Catholic priests, the one who married him and his wife, and the other who married his brother and his wife. Then he talked with Bishop Tom Gumbleton. As I know as least one of those individuals, I admire their stance. But I also admit that Micheal cherry-picked them. He could have found priests (I know some of them too!) who'd naively defend the US system as if it were instituted by God himself.Also, I'm not sure how a critique of ""capitalism"" itself is the answer. I'm as far from a ""capitalist"" as could be, have been critical of it since way before Reagan was elected. But I'm not absolutely sure that capitalism is the problem so much as abuse of that system. There are individual responsibilities too, especially the greed to which Michael refers. And, as he points out early in the film, that's something into which many if not most of us have bought. We still think that soon we'll make it to so taxes be damned!It is important, however, that people see this film--especially those less inclinded to criticize today's economy (including, if not especially, the bail-out). My wife comes from a conservative or at least indifferent family. She was moved by the suffering that individual Americans are enduring because of that greed. And Moore does a fabulous--and still somewhat entertaining--dimension to that which we all need to witness.",4,"Not as ""entertaining"" as his earlier films",1254528000,"10 3, 2009",2009,4818,"['was', 'much', 'less', 'entertainment', 'value', 'subject', 'matter.The', 'story', 'people', 'losing', 'homes', 'famlies', 'generations', 'foreclosure', 'Moore', 'film', 'more', 'showing', 'doing', 'more', 'outrageous', 'maneuvers', 'justifiably', 'famous', 'first', 'refinancing', 'was', 'marketed', 'way', 'go', 'need', 'money', 'vacation', 'needs', 'house', 'Refinance', 'fine', 'print', 'issued', 'lending', 'money', 'was', 'really', 'fine', 'people', 'found', 'affordable', 'mortgage', 'grew', 'grew', 'home', 'owner', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'more', 'Than', 'lost', 'home', 'early', 'case', 'were', 'four', 'members', 'family', 'house', 'Seven', 'cars', 'sheriff', 'dept', 'came', 'evict', 'residents', 'been', 'quite', 'lot', 'controversy', 'such', 'sub', 'prime', 'loans', 'tend', 'look', 'person', 'who', 'took', 'out', 'loan', 'irresponsible', 'not', 'completely', 'stupid', 'having', 'bought', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'Moore', 'study', '80', 'percent', 'problem', 'was', 'responsibility', 'wealthy', 'who', 'made', 'loans', 'not', 'who', 'got', 'loans.And', 'more', 'talked', 'number', 'homeowners', 'spouses', 'died', 'meantime', 'was', 'kind', 'supplement', 'film', 'Sicko', 'become', 'impossible', 'pay', 'family', 'member', 'sick', 'sickness', 'therefore', 'untreated', 'victim', 'simply', 'lack', 'money.Further', 'still', 'country', 'major', 'employers', 'not', 'fly-by-night', 'outfits', 'wealthiest', 'corporations', 'history', 'also', 'had', 'taken', 'out', 'life', 'insurance', 'policies', 'employees', 'who', 'were', 'ill', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'employee', 'die', 'lack', 'resources', 'employee', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'employee', 'How', 'low', 'CAN', 'one', 'go', 'story', 'then', 'period', 'late', 'Bush', 'administration', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'told', 'need', 'care', 'perhaps', 'make', 'sacrifice', 'two', 'Reagan', 'rode', 'town', 'deregulated', 'everything', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Don', 'Regan', 'Reagan', 'chief', 'staff', 'CEO', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'corporations', 'history', 'told', 'Reagan', 'had', 'speed', 'up', 'speech', 'had', 'begun', 'drag', 'time', 'Bush', 'II', 'was', 'office', 'system', 'was', 'process', 'falling', 'apart.The', 'film', 'was', 'astute', 'pointing', 'out', 'issues', 'MSM', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'Democratic', 'resistance', 'bail-out', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'pass', 'then', 'pressure', 'was', 'put', 'leading', 'Democrats', 'wealthiest', 'had', 'US', 'taxpayer', 'cover', 'up', 'blunders', 'Afterwards', 'taxpayer', 'also', 'covered', 'execs', 'private', 'luxury', 'jets', 'bonuses', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'it.It', 'hard', 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'mere', 'words', 'important', 'see', 'film', 'gave', 'only', 'partly', 'expected', 'be', 'tad', 'more', 'entertaining', 'One', 'Michael', 'techniques', 'astutely', 'film', 'entertainingly', 'attempt', 'citizen', 'arrests', 'CEOs', 'many', 'investment', 'firms', ""'ve"", 'bailed', 'out', 'crime', 'scene', 'tape', 'think', 'was', 'AIG', 'end', 'dismay', 'employees', 'security', 'staff', 'company', 'course', 'completely', 'symbolic', 'funny', 'point', 'very', 'clearly.And', 'Moore', 'had', 'credible', 'sources', 'One', 'was', 'responsible', 'S', 'L', 'disaster', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'others', 'admire', 'instance', 'Micheal', 'talked', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'one', 'who', 'married', 'wife', 'other', 'who', 'married', 'brother', 'wife', 'Then', 'talked', 'Bishop', 'Tom', 'Gumbleton', 'know', 'least', 'one', 'individuals', 'admire', 'stance', 'also', 'admit', 'Micheal', 'cherry-picked', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'priests', 'know', 'too', 'who', ""'d"", 'naively', 'defend', 'US', 'system', 'were', 'instituted', 'God', 'himself.Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'critique', 'capitalism', 'answer', ""'m"", 'far', 'capitalist', 'could', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'critical', 'way', 'Reagan', 'was', 'elected', ""'m"", 'not', 'absolutely', 'sure', 'capitalism', 'problem', 'so', 'much', 'abuse', 'system', 'are', 'individual', 'responsibilities', 'too', 'especially', 'greed', 'Michael', 'refers', 'out', 'early', 'film', 'something', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'have', 'bought', 'still', 'think', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'make', 'so', 'taxes', 'be', 'damned', 'important', 'however', 'people', 'see', 'film', 'especially', 'less', 'inclinded', 'criticize', 'today', 'economy', 'including', 'not', 'especially', 'bail-out', 'wife', 'conservative', 'least', 'indifferent', 'family', 'was', 'moved', 'suffering', 'individual', 'Americans', 'are', 'enduring', 'greed', 'Moore', 'fabulous', 'still', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'dimension', 'need', 'witness']",N/A

In this masterpiece of a film, Michael Moore sheds light on big business and its quest for even greater wealth at the expense of working people. Moore traces the roots of capitalism back many decades, and how the door for deregulation was swung open by our 40th president (Ronald Reagan). Despite warnings by the 39th president (Jimmy Carter), the culture of corruption was cemented and appears here to stay. As usual, Moore tells a sad story in a humorous way, and goes as far as yellow-taping a building as a crime scene. He also interviews airline pilots who are receiving food stamps, and how people's dignity has been crushed as a result of huge pay cuts. Finally, he shows how sophisticated trading schemes allow the rich to make billions of dollars on Wall Street, and how the housing market collapsed, and the resulting taxpayer-funded bailout.

When he's on, as in his award-winning 1989 breakthrough film &#34;Roger and Me,&#34; his righteous outrage produces brilliant social commentary. When he's off, as in &#34;Fahrenheit 911,&#34; he comes across with self-righteous anger that fails to find a coherent message. But he's always interesting and fun to watch when he doesn't diverge from the path of reason into ideological crankery. The 2009 film &#34;Capitalism: A Love Story&#34; is one of his more restrained and hence better efforts. Tapping into popular outrage over the 2009 U.S. economic crash, Moore deftly elucidates and dispenses with the economic self-delusions that got us into the problem int he first place. In fact, this film may well be Moore's best, and could even be seen as a sequel to &#34;Roger and Me&#34; inasmuch as it revisits a lot of the same places (Flint, Michigan) and themes of his first major film, explicitly acknowledging it as its forefather. But Moore has gone further here, revealing more of himself than ever before, particularly his Catholic upbringing and conscience as instigators of his passion to fix our broken economic system. He assembles an impressive parade of priests and religious figures here to back up his social justice message, but he also shows his strengths as a grassroots filmmaker by telling the stories of hardworking American families who have lost homes to foreclosure due to the selfish overreaching of corporate power brokers that infects our current system from the top-down. His factual analysis of how the interest rate system preys on the simple and innocent through mathematical shell games is particularly inspired. This film is not to be missed if you want to understand more of the roots of our current U.S. economic woes -- and how a Catholic conscience inspires one to redress injustices.",5,"Moore's Catholic conscience meets ""Roger and Me""",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1870,"['filmmaker', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'hit', 'miss', 'When', 'award-winning', '1989', 'film', '34', 'Roger', 'Me', '34', 'righteous', 'outrage', 'brilliant', 'social', 'commentary', 'When', 'off', '34', 'Fahrenheit', '911', '34', 'self-righteous', 'anger', 'find', 'coherent', 'message', 'always', 'interesting', 'fun', 'watch', 'when', ""n't"", 'diverge', 'path', 'reason', 'ideological', 'crankery', '2009', 'film', '34', 'Capitalism', 'Love', 'Story', '34', 'one', 'more', 'restrained', 'hence', 'better', 'efforts', 'Tapping', 'popular', 'outrage', '2009', 'U.S.', 'economic', 'crash', 'Moore', 'deftly', 'economic', 'self-delusions', 'got', 'problem', 'int', 'first', 'place', 'fact', 'film', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'Moore', 'best', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'sequel', '34', 'Roger', 'Me', '34', 'inasmuch', 'lot', 'same', 'places', 'Flint', 'Michigan', 'themes', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'explicitly', 'acknowledging', 'forefather', 'Moore', 'gone', 'further', 'here', 'revealing', 'more', 'ever', 'particularly', 'Catholic', 'upbringing', 'conscience', 'instigators', 'passion', 'fix', 'broken', 'economic', 'system', 'impressive', 'parade', 'priests', 'religious', 'figures', 'here', 'back', 'up', 'social', 'justice', 'message', 'also', 'strengths', 'grassroots', 'filmmaker', 'telling', 'stories', 'hardworking', 'American', 'families', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'homes', 'foreclosure', 'due', 'selfish', 'overreaching', 'corporate', 'power', 'brokers', 'current', 'system', 'top-down', 'factual', 'analysis', 'how', 'interest', 'rate', 'system', 'preys', 'simple', 'innocent', 'mathematical', 'shell', 'games', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'want', 'understand', 'more', 'roots', 'current', 'U.S.', 'economic', 'woes', 'how', 'Catholic', 'conscience', 'one', 'redress', 'injustices']",N/A
