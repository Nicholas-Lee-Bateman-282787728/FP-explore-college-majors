1010726,AJELZ0FE42N2I,B000H6SXZQ,Island Cook,"[2, 9]","We are great fans of Martin Clunes and own all seasons of Doc Martin. This earlier TV series is pretty bad and we struggle to get through every episode. While Martin Clunes is outstanding in other shows and productions, his Doc Martin character would rather drink a bottle of blood than to suffer through this bad TV series.How do we hate you? Let me count the ways: 1. Crude, off-color sexual and toilet humor 2. Boring episodes 3. Weak characters 4. Poor writing 5. Low quality production videos. etc, etc.There are no subtitles and sound quality is so poor it is difficult to hear their low-class, tastless jokes. It is imporssible to fast forward to the beginning of each show, you must see all the previews and titles before the show starts. Then if you make the mistake of going back to the episode or main menu, you have to start all over again sequencing through all the introductory material and titles.How he got better roles later in life is a mystery as this should have been a career-ender.",1,Mr. Clunes Acting Badly,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,1003,"['are', 'great', 'fans', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'own', 'seasons', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'earlier', 'TV', 'series', 'pretty', 'bad', 'struggle', 'get', 'episode', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'outstanding', 'other', 'shows', 'productions', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'character', 'would', 'rather', 'drink', 'bottle', 'blood', 'suffer', 'bad', 'TV', 'series.How', 'do', 'hate', 'Let', 'count', 'ways', '1', 'Crude', 'off-color', 'sexual', 'toilet', 'humor', '2', 'Boring', '3', 'Weak', 'characters', '4', 'Poor', 'writing', '5', 'Low', 'quality', 'production', 'videos', 'etc', 'are', 'subtitles', 'sound', 'quality', 'so', 'poor', 'difficult', 'hear', 'low-class', 'tastless', 'jokes', 'imporssible', 'fast', 'forward', 'beginning', 'show', 'must', 'see', 'previews', 'titles', 'show', 'Then', 'make', 'mistake', 'going', 'back', 'episode', 'main', 'menu', 'have', 'start', 'over', 'again', 'sequencing', 'introductory', 'material', 'titles.How', 'got', 'better', 'roles', 'later', 'life', 'mystery', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'career-ender']",Men Behaving Badly: The Complete Collection

Martin Clunes is absolutely brilliant and the rest of the cast- tops as well! He has just developed into an actor I want to watch in anything he chooses to do - because it is going to knock your socks off.,5,Men Behaving Badly,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,339,"['One', 'funniest', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'come', 'UK', 'just', 'discovered', 'series', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'rest', 'cast-', 'tops', 'well', 'just', 'developed', 'actor', 'want', 'watch', 'anything', 'do', 'going', 'knock', 'socks', 'off']",Men Behaving Badly: The Complete Collection
