1164351,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0019M7KSI,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 3]","""Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe"" Collection Three highlights some of the best (or worst, depending on your viewpoint) episodes of the popular Discovery Channel show. The affable, smart, and funny Rowe is definitely not afraid to get his hands dirty, and I especially appreciate how he never condescends to any of the workers regardless of how seemingly menial or disgusting the task at hand is.This two-DVD set contains twelve episodes and over twenty separate jobs that range from unsanitary to dirty and scary to unbelievably terrifying. Some of my favorites are ""Bridge Painter and Space Crawler Technician"" (outrageously scary and unfathomably dirty, respectively,) ""Vomit Island Worker,"" a job that proves that things that are beautiful at a distance aren't necessarily so appealing close up, ""Alligator Egg Collector"" (just awful in every way,) ""Odor Eater"" (where Mike learns his nose is ""damaged goods,"") and ""Mud Mineral Excavator and Rice Plantation Worker,"" where absolutely nothing goes as planned.Rising above all those jobs though is what may be the most positively revolting job of the entire series. Of course I refer to ""Slime Eel Fisherman."" If you have not seen this episode, buy this set immediately and watch it. Make sure that you are not eating while doing so. I had no idea that creatures like this existed, much less that there was profit to be made in fishing for these things. (They are exported to Korea where they are viewed as a delicacy.) One of the fishermen notes that a single eel can make a gallon of slime easily. Mike does the math that they have thousands of slime eels on the boat, and therefore thousands of gallons of eel mucus. If you want a disgusting job, this one's for you.""Dirty Jobs"" is always educational and supremely entertaining. Mike Rowe is the perfect host for the show, and whatever his salary is, it isn't enough for what he goes through to get these segments. This is a great set and a great value. Get it today and get dirty!",5,"""There's Just No Way This Is Going To End Well."" - Mike Rowe",1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,1979,"['Dirty', 'Jobs', 'Mike', 'Rowe', 'Collection', 'Three', 'highlights', 'best', 'worst', 'depending', 'viewpoint', 'episodes', 'popular', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'show', 'affable', 'smart', 'funny', 'Rowe', 'definitely', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'how', 'never', 'workers', 'regardless', 'how', 'seemingly', 'menial', 'disgusting', 'task', 'hand', 'is.This', 'two-DVD', 'set', 'contains', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'twenty', 'separate', 'jobs', 'range', 'unsanitary', 'dirty', 'scary', 'unbelievably', 'terrifying', 'favorites', 'are', 'Bridge', 'Painter', 'Space', 'Crawler', 'Technician', 'outrageously', 'scary', 'unfathomably', 'dirty', 'respectively', 'Vomit', 'Island', 'Worker', 'job', 'things', 'are', 'beautiful', 'distance', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'so', 'appealing', 'close', 'up', 'Alligator', 'Egg', 'Collector', 'just', 'awful', 'way', 'Odor', 'Eater', 'where', 'Mike', 'nose', 'damaged', 'goods', 'Mud', 'Mineral', 'Excavator', 'Rice', 'Plantation', 'Worker', 'where', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'planned.Rising', 'jobs', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'positively', 'revolting', 'job', 'entire', 'series', 'course', 'refer', 'Slime', 'Eel', 'Fisherman', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episode', 'buy', 'set', 'immediately', 'watch', 'Make', 'sure', 'are', 'not', 'eating', 'doing', 'so', 'had', 'idea', 'existed', 'much', 'less', 'was', 'profit', 'be', 'made', 'fishing', 'things', 'are', 'exported', 'Korea', 'where', 'are', 'viewed', 'delicacy', 'One', 'fishermen', 'single', 'eel', 'can', 'make', 'gallon', 'slime', 'easily', 'Mike', 'math', 'have', 'thousands', 'slime', 'eels', 'boat', 'therefore', 'thousands', 'gallons', 'eel', 'mucus', 'want', 'disgusting', 'job', 'one', 'Dirty', 'Jobs', 'always', 'educational', 'supremely', 'entertaining', 'Mike', 'Rowe', 'perfect', 'host', 'show', 'whatever', 'salary', ""n't"", 'enough', 'what', 'get', 'segments', 'great', 'set', 'great', 'value', 'Get', 'today', 'get', 'dirty']",Dirty Jobs: Collection 3
