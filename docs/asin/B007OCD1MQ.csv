Just recently saw old STP videos and live videos and I was blown away. Then I heard about the Live in the Windy City dvd, I purchased it and was impressed. You can tell Scott's years of drug abuse has caught up with him but he still sings well and still has the crazy energy as he did in the 90s.

Probably one of the best of 100's of concerts I'd seen.  It was obvious at that concert he was high on something.  Even though Slash from GNR was playing guitar.  Scott was the show.  In STP concert I think he was clean and just went thru the montions.  I hate to say this but the guy is much better lead stoned then sober.

The gig in question was probably one of the very last ones with Scott Weiland as their frontman (and chief songwriter). Scott's drug habits started to damage the band many years ago and since he was never able to kick definitely those habits, he was expelled the year after this show was recorded.
