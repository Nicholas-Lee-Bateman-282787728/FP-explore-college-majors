Ever since ""The Aviator"", he(in my opinion) has shaken off the persona that he still acts like that golden-haired boy from ""Titanic"".But I have watched him grow with every moviemaking feat,and with ""J.Edgar"",he lands a knockout punch in evoking hoover's mannerisms and posture,as well as the man's voice(to some extent).Clint Eastwood's biopic is not a masterpiece,but it is masterful.His direction is unhurried,and he does manage to not make Hoover an All-American good guy,taking quick but hard looks at his abuses of power.Anyone who thinks Dicaprio still can't act,or who have strong animosities toward Hoover period- should leave their opinions at the door and give this film a decent viewing or two. One of the things that surprised me about ""J.Edgar"" was that it was not longer,compared to ""Malcolm X"",""JFK"",and ""Nixon"".But I was not dissapointed,and the rest of the cast was impressive,particularly The Great Judi Dench as Hoover's mother.All in all,Eastwood's portrait of the very secretive and very troubled public figure is a tremendous acheivement,not just as a biopic but as a period piece as well.Leonardo should strive for more roles like this,but I am assured that he's well on his way as a dramatic actor.",5,"""J.Edgar""-Powerful,Pivotal,and Riveting.",1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,1285,"['Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'get', 'better', 'film', 'Ever', 'Aviator', 'opinion', 'shaken', 'off', 'persona', 'still', 'golden-haired', 'boy', 'Titanic', '.But', 'have', 'watched', 'grow', 'moviemaking', 'feat', 'J.Edgar', 'knockout', 'punch', 'evoking', 'hoover', 'mannerisms', 'posture', 'as', 'well', 'man', 'voice', 'extent', '.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'biopic', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'masterful.His', 'direction', 'unhurried', 'manage', 'not', 'make', 'Hoover', 'All-American', 'good', 'guy', 'taking', 'quick', 'hard', 'looks', 'abuses', 'power.Anyone', 'who', 'Dicaprio', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'who', 'have', 'strong', 'animosities', 'Hoover', 'period-', 'should', 'leave', 'opinions', 'door', 'give', 'film', 'decent', 'viewing', 'two', 'One', 'things', 'surprised', 'J.Edgar', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'longer', 'compared', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'JFK', 'Nixon', '.But', 'was', 'not', 'dissapointed', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'impressive', 'particularly', 'Great', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Hoover', 'mother.All', 'Eastwood', 'portrait', 'very', 'secretive', 'very', 'troubled', 'public', 'figure', 'tremendous', 'acheivement', 'not', 'just', 'biopic', 'period', 'piece', 'well.Leonardo', 'should', 'strive', 'more', 'roles', 'am', 'assured', 'well', 'way', 'dramatic', 'actor']",N/A
1518038,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B006OFN0BQ,Acute Observer,"[1, 3]","J. Edgar, 2011 filmThis film begins with a quote and a picture of a building. The voice warns us against Communism. Hoover wants to tell his story from the beginning. In 1919 A. Mitchell Palmer was Attorney-General. A bomb explodes outside a home at 11pm. Targets of Bolshevik Communism! Hoover's eyes were opened! [Hoover's father was sent to a mental asylum, his family did not get a pension, and a teen-aged Hoover became the breadwinner of the family.] Hoover has an indexing system to quickly locate facts about people. [His first government job was at the Library of Congress; he went to law school at night.] ""My work comes first."" The story of Hoover's early days continues. They need proof to deport a foreigner. But what about a citizen? In Centralia Washington a man shoots at military veterans. There is a strike in Chicago! The deportation of Emma Goldman set a precedent.[There was a recession after the War.] There is a raid in Paterson (""Silk City""). [The dim lighting hides the events.] ""Enough."" Nearly 4,000 were arrested and 500 deported. The agents involved in this raid lost their jobs. [The election of a Republican meant new patronage jobs.] Harlan Fiske Stone appointed Hoover as Acting Director of the Bureau of Investigations. Hoover wants a more professional organization. Agents would be lawyers and accountants, and obey the 18th Amendment. [""Loyalty"" may be the opposite of ""professionalism"".] In the 1930s Deputy Sheriffs were hired if they were good with a gun, but they don't tell you this. A personal introduction led to Clyde Tolson's hiring. [No mentions of Hoover's Masonic lodge.] Can they create a `confidential file' on powerful people? We see how he uses these secrets to influence RFK! Hoover chooses fine suits to be well-dressed and impress people. In 1930 (the Great Depression) there was the Kansas City Massacre, where police were killed to free a gangster. Hoover warned about ""Public Enemies"".""The Most Famous Man of the 20th Century""? The Lindbergh Baby was kidnapped in 1932. Lindbergh trusted the local police rather than the FBI. Hoover asked for a Central Registry for Fingerprints, and armed agents who could make arrests. Hoover had a file on Eleanor. Lindbergh put his trust in criminals to solve the kidnap. [These had ""lines of information"".] Questioned Document Examiner Osborne identified ransom notes. J. F. Condon delivered the ransom money to a man in a cemetery. Hoover meets the new President and gets new powers to investigate without a warrant! Tolson is the new #2 man. The discovery of a child's body tells about the missing baby.Hoover sought scientific experts in various fields to staff the FBI Lab. ""But did he ever make an arrest personally?"" No. We see Hoover's jealousy against Melvin Purvis. So Hoover goes on actual raids to arrest criminals. [Does the president of General Motors work on an assembly line?] Hoover obtains a letter from Lorena Hickok to Mrs. FDR! Hollywood movies popularize G-Men. Shirley Temple kisses Hoover in public. We hear about a ""daffodil"". The ransom money is traced back to store owners in the Bronx. There is a license plate number. Hauptmann was arrested, they had forensic agents for the trial. Hoover is first to learn about the shooting of JFK, and he calls RFK.Hoover attended a racetrack. [Did he get tips on fixed races?] Hoover spends week-ends in New York. [He collected on an expense account but was not charged!] How real is that argument with Tolson? Tolson had a stroke, Hoover needs to lose weight. Hoover plans to attack a Nobel Peace Prize winner with an anonymous letter. [Didn't he use a top agent for this?] We see the trial of Hauptmann again. [Did he do it alone?] Hoover sees MLK as the ""greatest domestic threat""! The scene of Hoover putting on a dress is unbelievable! The election of Hoover marks a new era. [and a threat to Hoover's power]. Hoover wants his private files destroyed when he is gone. Nixon wants more wiretapping, he is a menace to Hoover. Is it time to retire? Did Hoover grab the glory from other agents? Tolson tells the truth about Hoover![The ending seems worse than the rest of the movie, but that seems to be deliberate.] ""Goodnight."" Miss Gandy gets a phone call and goes about her business. Nixon is told about Hoover's death. ""I want those {expletive deleted} files!"" [But he didn't get them!] Nixon delivers a tribute. [What was he really like? Read ""Nixon's Darkest Secrets"".] Gandy shredded the ""Private and Confidential Files"" and their contents will never be known. ""Only a few misfiled items have ever surfaced."" Clyde Tolson inherited Hoover's estate. They are buried in the Congressional Cemetery, in separate plots. ""The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover"" was a better movie and history. Curt Gentry's biography is the better book. There are books that question the guilt of Hauptmann. At least one other tried to defraud the Lindberghs by making a false claim for the ransom money. The dark tones of many of the scenes detracts from the story. This movie is an argument for an age and term limit.Like other Eastwood films this movie runs on too long with too little. It could use better editing. Or it could have included more historical scenes from Hoover's life. From the Civil War to the 1930s the Secret Service (as its name implies) was in charge of Counter-Intelligence. Their investigation of Teapot Dome led to the conviction of a Senator and Congressmen. Congress retaliated by cutting their budget and reassigning Counter-Intelligence to the FBI. Hoover realized the way to protect himself and his agency was to gather up the dirty secrets of Sentors and Congressmen to forestall any attacks. Business as usual? FDR loved to hear dirty secrets gathered by Hoover (so did LBJ). Hoover's powers were mostly gained while FDR was in office.",2,Some Events in Hoover's Life,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",2012,5815,"['J.', 'Edgar', '2011', 'filmThis', 'film', 'quote', 'picture',

Somehow, though, the final product managed to be less than the sum of its parts. So what was the problem? There are a few. While the actors all offered up top notch performances, poor lighting and subpar makeup took away from the aesthetics of the film, while a confusing narrative and humdrum storytelling diminished any impact it might have otherwise had. As far as biopics go, you'll certainly learn a little bit about Mr. Hoover from J.

Here, Eastwood delivers again in `J.Edgar', a biopic that follows the career of the man who created what is now known as the Federal Bureau of Investigations; J. Edgar Hoover.I can't speak for the accuracy of the history or how they portrayed the man, I'm sure some things were embellished for the sake of drama, but as a film, Eastwood has crafted a compelling and engaging movie. I was fascinated at seeing how the FBI started out as a powerless bureau and Hoover crafted it into the law enforcement organization it is today, not to mention make headway into forensics investigations.Watching Hoover himself, and his complicated relationships with the people around him, was an emotional rollercoaster as things unfolded on screen, I found myself rooting for J. Edgar one minute and absolutely hating him the next to pitying him later on, and sometimes all at the same time as well. If you're looking for anything about Hoover's cross-dressing, you'll be sorely disappointed, it is only briefly touched on here, but the bulk of the movie is about the FBI.Leonardo DiCaprio is captivating as the very much flawed titular character and Armie Hammer is equally strong as Hoover's right-hand man, Clyde Tolson. Naomi Watts doesn't let the film down either as Hoover's personal assistant and Judi Dench as Hoover's mother. But, really, all the actors go a tremendous job at getting us into these characters.`J. Edgar' is worth a watch if not the purchase, if there was one thing that bothered me about the movie it's that it does jump back and forth a lot between time periods, it's like one moment you're in the 1920's the next, it's the 1960's, it can be a bit confusing in some parts, other than that, this is a great movie manages to keep you engaged for it's 137 minute run-time.The disc includes `J.

That's what the filmmakers chose to make this bio-pic by aiming at the relationship between Hoover and Clyde Tolson, his right-hand man. And while it's essentially accurate, it still does not make for compelling viewing. We like our movie heroes to be people we can root for, but the Hoover on show here is very bipolar. So we never really decide if we like or dislike anything about him. This Clint Eastwood directed vehicle was scripted by a very young man, so maybe that's one of the problems. I also wish they had included some extras of the real Hoover so we could at least make a direct comparison. Leo diCaprio seems to get Hoover's intensity, sexual ambiguity and ambition in droves. They also manage to encapsulate almost 50 years of one man's career into just over two hours.

1518052,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B006OFN0BQ,Brian Driver,"[0, 1]","""J. Edgar"" was a well acted historical piece attempting to cover a complicated subject that, when all was said and done, left me feeling it was less than the sum of its parts.  To put it more simply, it was everything I thought it would be...but I wish it would have been just a little bit less.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular figurehead, ""J. Edgar"" intrigued me from the start.  Certainly the film would discuss the birth of the FBI, and J. Edgar Hoover's fanatical protection and promotion of that institution, of his pioneering a national fingerprint system, and his hatred of communism.  Would it also tackle his secret files full of blackmail material on political enemies, and his supposed homosexuality and cross-dressing?And the answer is YES to all those things...and that's almost a shame.  There is SO much information here that the film tends to be exhaustive AND exhausting at the same time.  Eastwood has always been a meticulous director, nurturing his characters and his subjects, and perhaps he might have been wise to be a little less so, to have cut a bit more here and there.  The film is almost two hours and twenty minutes, and I was actually pleased to see the feller die...I was that tired.Eastwood's screenplay was written by Dustin Lance Black (""Milk""), and their decision to tell their tale in a dual present/past fashion through cuts and flashbacks will probably draw some criticism, and may have been partly responsible for my feeling that the story went on a little too long.  Cutting between the two tales was a bit jarring at times, and often frustrated me more than drew me in.Whether DiCaprio will be honored by any acting nominations will remain to be seen.  I felt he was good, though a little uncharacteristically wooden.  While he covered the man from 1919 to 1972, and did a decent job showing the man aging, I think as much credit should go to the makeup department as it should to him.  For instance, I did not feel his voice aged anywhere near as much as his body did, and it bothered me.On the other hand, there are three supporting characters who I thought were remarkable.  The first and second were Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson, Hoover's confidante and (apparently) all-but-sexual partner; and Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy, his extremely loyal and supportive secretary.  I found them to be credible and well played, especially Hammer as his meticulous, caring, loving friend.  Whether their relationship was indeed one of only implied sexuality I am not sure, but both Eastwood's coy directing and Hammer's capable acting give few specifics as to how far their relationship indeed went.And I have saved the best for last: Judy Dench is pure magic as Hoover's domineering mother, a thoroughly unlikable woman who created a stunted man maniacally driven to please her, though he almost never can.  I would be extremely surprised if the Dame does not win an acting award for this role.There is a telling scene near the start where J. Edgar, who is using his full first name (John) at the time, is buying his very first tailored suit as the newly established head of the FBI, and he is told that another John Hoover is a credit risk...would there be some way he could distinguish himself?  Whether this scene is fully factual or not it works, and the notion of entitling the film as such serves to establish just who Hoover was, the man who invented himself AND the FBI.",4,"J.

1518053,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,B006OFN0BQ,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[4, 7]","From the moment I heard that Clint Eastwood was working on this film I became eager for the release. I was particularly eager to see how Leonardo Dicaprio would handle both the role, and Eastwood's direction. Hoover the man was a controversial character full of personal peccadillos both documented and heavily speculated upon. With such a vast amount of conflicting information available, I was deeply intrigued to see the manner in which the data would be presented. His paranoia was legendary, as were his interactions and fundamental mistrust of several of the presidents under which he served.I didn't read much in the way of reviews either here at Amazon or in the media prior to viewing the film - I even eschewed watching the trailer - because I wanted to meet the film at ""face value"" as I had many of Eastwood's other directorial efforts. My opinions of the movie are therefore my own, and not based on the praise and/or criticisms of others that have viewed the movie.On the plus side, Eastwood doesn't sensationalize the allegations of homosexuality and cross dressing that would have made Hoover an easy target for exploitation. Such matters are presented in a manner that manages to make their possibilities a very realistic conclusion to be drawn, but doesn't accept them as fact. The one kiss that takes place with Hoover's longtime ""partner"" is rejected by J Edgar who demands that such a thing never be done again. Unlike ""Milk"" in which the viewer is constantly bombarded with the protagonist's sexuality, in J. Edgar the sexual inclinations are present as a part of the man, but not the driving focus of his life.It is a delicate balance, but largely handled in a deft manner in the film.On the negative side of the ledger however, is the overall bleak nature of the production. The colors are a dull pallette of greys and drab hues, which leaves the eye little stimulation to help with the slow pacing of the story. Eastwood also jumps back and forth frequently, choosing to relate the story in more flashbacks than necessary instead of presenting Hoover's life in a linear manner. As a result of these two filmaking decisions, the viewer almost has to work too hard to maintain interest and keep track of the flow of the narrative.For people who lived through the Hoover years, or have taken even a cursory glance at the man's Wiki bio, there are few surprises here. In fact, to the movie's detriment, it is likely that many viewers will already know more about the man than is presented. I have enjoyed virtually all of Eastwood's prior directorial efforts, but this one was just too slow and dry for my taste. I was also pulled out of the film several times by the makeup. I'm not usually bothered by such things, but at times the methods used to artificially age the main characters was so caky-looking I kept expecting to see chunks of it break off.Overall, this is a very average biopic, but a surprisingly poor film when compared to the past efforts of almost all those involved in the project both in front of, and behind the camera. It represents a rare but fairly large weakness in Eastwood's almost perfect directorial resume.",3,"Big names, minor disappointments",1330905600,"03 5, 2012",2012,3158,"['moment', 'heard', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'working', 'film', 'became', 'eager', 'release', 'was', 'particularly', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'would', 'handle', 'role', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'man', 'was', 'controversial', 'character', 'full', 'personal', 'peccadillos', 'documented', 'heavily', 'speculated', 'vast', 'amount', 'conflicting', 'information', 'available', 'was', 'deeply', 'intrigued', 'see', 'manner', 'data', 'would', 'be', 'presented', 'paranoia', 'was', 'legendary', 'were', 'interactions', 'fundamental', 'mistrust', 'several', 'presidents', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'much', 'way', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'media', 'prior', 'viewing', 'film', 'even', 'eschewed', 'watching', 'trailer', 'wanted', 'meet', 'film', 'face', 'value', 'had', 'many', 'Eastwood', 'other', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'opinions', 'movie', 'are', 'therefore', 'own', 'not', 'based', 'praise', 'and/or', 'criticisms', 'others', 'have', 'viewed', 'movie.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Eastwood', ""n't"", 'sensationalize', 'allegations', 'homosexuality', 'cross', 'dressing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Hoover', 'easy', 'target', 'exploitation', 'Such', 'matters', 'are', 'presented', 'manner', 'make', 'possibilities', 'very', 'realistic', 'conclusion', 'be', 'drawn', ""n't"", 'accept', 'fact', 'one', 'kiss', 'place', 'Hoover', 'longtime', 'partner', 'rejected', 'J', 'Edgar', 'who', 'thing', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'again', 'Milk', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'bombarded', 'protagonist', 'sexuality', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'sexual', 'inclinations', 'are', 'present', 'part', 'man', 'not', 'driving', 'focus', 'life.It', 'delicate', 'balance', 'largely', 'handled', 'deft', 'manner', 'film.On', 'negative', 'side', 'ledger', 'however', 'overall', 'bleak', 'nature', 'production', 'colors', 'are', 'dull', 'pallette', 'greys', 'drab', 'hues', 'eye', 'little', 'stimulation', 'help', 'slow', 'pacing', 'story', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'back', 'forth', 'frequently', 'choosing', 'relate', 'story', 'more', 'flashbacks', 'necessary', 'instead', 'presenting', 'Hoover', 'life', 'linear', 'manner', 'result', 'two', 'filmaking', 'decisions', 'viewer', 'almost', 'work', 'too', 'hard', 'maintain', 'interest', 'keep', 'track', 'flow', 'narrative.For', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'Hoover', 'years', 'have', 'taken', 'even', 'cursory', 'glance', 'man', 'Wiki', 'bio', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'here', 'fact', 'movie', 'detriment', 'likely', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'already', 'know', 'more', 'man', 'presented', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'virtually', 'Eastwood', 'prior', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'slow', 'dry', 'taste', 'was', 'also', 'pulled', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'makeup', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'bothered', 'such', 'things', 'times', 'methods', 'used', 'artificially', 'age', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'so', 'caky-looking', 'kept', 'expecting', 'see', 'chunks', 'break', 'off.Overall', 'very', 'average', 'biopic', 'surprisingly', 'poor', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'past', 'efforts', 'almost', 'involved', 'project', 'front', 'camera', 'rare', 'fairly', 'large', 'weakness', 'Eastwood', 'almost', 'perfect', 'directorial', 'resume']",N/A
1518054,A1GB0HW46Y2EB,B006OFN0BQ,Bruce G. Taylor,"[3, 5]","A film about a controversial and prominent figure in American history should have been more compelling than this one directed by Clint Eastwood.  Leonardo Di Caprio seems to have become less convincing an actor as he has aged.  I thought he was really fine in ""This Boy's Life"" and quite good in ""The Departed"" and ""Gangs of New York""-- less so in ""Shutter Island"" and ""Inception,"" the latter not making a whole lot of sense to me and I like science fiction.  In ""The Aviator"" and ""J. Edgar"" he seems to be portraying the same  type of  character with a sort of one-note performance particularly in the latter.I found the supporting cast to be very engaging -- Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy, his secretary and perhaps Edgar's ""second wife"" and Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson, his lifelong friend and companion.  As always Judi Dench was excellent in a relatively brief performance as Hoover's mother.  This picture did not draw me in as did Oliver Stone's ""Nixon,"" a very intense and rather creepy film having stunning editing.  The makeup used for the aged Hoover and  particularly Tolson made them look like corpses.There aren't, I suppose, many films or recordings documenting Hoover's visage and voice -- I'm not really certain what he looked like.

What it does seem to emphasize is how weird he was, how a momma's boy who never married had an obsession with everyone else's sexual orientation because he himself was confused of his own.This movie shows the personal side of Hoover.  The movie spares any naked scenes between J Edgar Hoover and his long-time confidante Clyde Tolson; the closest is reveals is a fight scene at 1:34 hours and a few hand-holding seconds. For the remainder of the movie the focus is on Hoover's quirky obsessions with Martin Luther King Jr, the Kennedys, and the personal relationship between Hoover and Tolson that seemed to crumble in its later years.  It also shows how Hoover often falsified or exaggerated reports to make him seem like the nation's perfect crime fighter when in fact others did that job for him.The acting is fine by all the starring casts.  DiCaprio does an outstanding job and so does Naomi Watts as his personal secretary Helen Gandy.  Armie Hammer rounds out the main characters as Clyde Tolson.What I did find distracting is the director's constant going back and forth between the young and the old Hoover.  Director Clint Eastwood also seems to have a preference of using side lighting that makes the other half of a person's face disappear into deep shadows, something he also used in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" with piano music accompanying the somber scenes.The movie flows at times as if Hoover is dictating his life to his personally-appointed biographer.  The make-up on ""Tolson"" also makes him look like a corpse, whereas Hoover himself is aged well.There is emphasis on the botched Lindbergh kidnapping case, obsession with the Roosevelts (both Franklin and Eleanor) and later MLK.  Not enough was devoted to Hoover's dealings with the mafia of the 1930s, and nothing is mentioned about the FBI files of Vietnam War protesters.So, watch this with the above caveats.  This movie shows more of the personal side of Hoover and touches only on the many bizarre and above-the-law tactics Hoover employed to gather information on anyone he seemed treasonous against America.  Presidents both feared and admired him, and that is evident in the alleged quote Nixon said upon learning of Hoover's death, a quote I can't post here because Amazon will refuse to post my review.",4,Too much back and forth,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,2424,"['will', 'have', 'disagree', 'many', 'one-star', 'reviewers', 'who', 'say', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'Hoover', 'private', 'sexual', 'lives', 'not', 'What', 'seem', 'emphasize', 'how', 'weird', 'was', 'how', 'momma', 'boy', 'who', 'never', 'married', 'had', 'obsession', 'everyone', 'else', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'was', 'confused', 'own.This', 'movie', 'personal', 'side', 'Hoover', 'movie', 'naked', 'scenes', 'J', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'long-time', 'confidante', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'closest', 'reveals', 'fight', 'scene', '1:34', 'hours', 'few', 'hand-holding', 'seconds', 'remainder', 'movie', 'focus', 'Hoover', 'quirky', 'obsessions', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr', 'Kennedys', 'personal', 'relationship', 'Hoover', 'Tolson', 'seemed', 'crumble', 'later', 'years', 'also', 'how', 'Hoover', 'often', 'falsified', 'exaggerated', 'reports', 'make', 'seem', 'nation', 'perfect', 'crime', 'fighter', 'when', 'fact', 'others', 'did', 'job', 'him.The', 'acting', 'fine', 'starring', 'casts', 'DiCaprio', 'outstanding', 'job', 'so', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'personal', 'secretary', 'Helen', 'Gandy', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'out', 'main', 'characters', 'Clyde', 'Tolson.What', 'did', 'find', 'distracting', 'director', 'constant', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'young', 'old', 'Hoover', 'Director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'also', 'have', 'preference', 'using', 'side', 'lighting', 'other', 'half', 'person', 'face', 'disappear', 'deep', 'shadows', 'something', 'also', 'used', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'piano', 'music', 'accompanying', 'somber', 'scenes.The', 'movie', 'times', 'Hoover', 'dictating', 'life', 'personally-appointed', 'biographer', 'make-up', 'Tolson', 'also', 'look', 'corpse', 'whereas', 'Hoover', 'aged', 'emphasis', 'botched', 'Lindbergh', 'kidnapping', 'case', 'obsession', 'Roosevelts', 'Franklin', 'Eleanor', 'later', 'MLK', 'Not', 'enough', 'was', 'devoted', 'Hoover', 'dealings', 'mafia', '1930s', 'nothing', 'mentioned', 'FBI', 'files', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'protesters.So', 'watch', 'above', 'caveats', 'movie', 'more', 'personal', 'side', 'Hoover', 'only', 'many', 'bizarre', 'above-the-law', 'tactics', 'Hoover', 'employed', 'gather', 'information', 'anyone', 'seemed', 'treasonous', 'America', 'Presidents', 'feared', 'admired', 'evident', 'alleged', 'quote', 'Nixon', 'said', 'learning', 'Hoover', 'death', 'quote', 'ca', ""n't"", 'post', 'here', 'Amazon', 'will', 'refuse', 'post', 'review']",N/A

1518062,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B006OFN0BQ,C. Sawin,"[2, 4]","I can't recall knowing much of anything about J. Edgar Hoover before seeing this film. Other than recognizing the name, everything else was pretty much a mystery. I suppose that's why it was so intriguing; controversy is always interesting. Here is this man that became known for his incredibly strict standards, his loyalty to his work, his rise to the top of law enforcement, and basically helped the way crimes are solved and prosecuted evolve to what we're familiar with today who basically had confidential files on every major player he'd ever been in contact with, was completely clueless when it came to the opposite sex, and may or may not have been homosexual.The film begins during the Palmer Raids of late 1919 and early 1920 and covers everything up to Hoover's death in 1972. We constantly jump back in forth in time as an older J. Edgar (Leonardo DiCaprio) is narrating his version of his life and the younger version of J. Edgar in the 30s as he rose to the top of the Bureau of Investigation and formed the FBI. The way the film transitions between the early 1930s and 1972 and the way these transitions are edited is part of the film's charm. It already has this kind of filter on it; the one that seems to have become associated with most of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts. Everything looks kind of semi-drained of its color and is kind of hazy. It looks the way you'd imagine the past if somebody was telling you a story and they cued a flashback or something.The unfortunate thing is the film has something really intriguing at its core, but it's presented so blandly. There's a huge explosion early on in the film, gangsters, gunfire, and a dead body among other things but it's all spread out amongst rather underwhelming dialogue. DiCaprio becomes incredibly emotional in the final half hour or so, but he seems to be holding back the rest of the time. Other than portraying a different accent, he seems to just be going with the flow while the same can be said for Naomi Watts. While DiCaprio does pull it together later on, Armie Hammer practically acts circles around him the entire time. His facial expressions are what give away just how much he enjoys being in the company of J. Edgar and his portrayal of an older man with health problems is practically spot-on. Judi Dench also has quite a few memorable scenes as J. Edgar's mother Anna Marie. Keep a particular eye out for the ""Daffy"" conversation between her and J. Edgar.The make-up effects are easily a shoe-in to win an Oscar this year. Not only are they fantastic, but trying to think of worthy competition is almost impossible. X-Men: First Class perhaps? Either way they did a phenomenal job here. The subtle sex jokes became increasingly awkward as the film progressed. However, that was more than likely its purpose. There is also one of the most oafish kiss scenes in cinematic history included in here. While watching J. Edgar, I couldn't help but think of David Fincher's Zodiac. It was mostly in the way both films seemed to ease you into conversations and reactions revolving around what interested you in the film to begin with rather than throwing you headfirst into the subject (The Zodiac Killer and J. Edgar's private life respectively). The flaw with that comparison is that Zodiac is still more interesting than J. Edgar.J. Edgar comes off as longwinded and fairly boring the majority of the time. There is a fascinating story buried within its roots, but somewhere between pen and paper and the big screen a bland representation of what it once was became the movie we know today. Leonardo DiCaprio almost seems to hold back most of the film while Armie Hammer manages to outshine him at every turn and shows how ridiculously talented he really is. J. Edgar isn't downright awful, but it isn't great either. Even though they only played a minor role, J. Edgar manages to be the lamest and dullest film featuring gangsters I've ever seen.",2,Bland and underwhelming,1320883200,"11 10, 2011",2011,3948,"['ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'knowing', 'much', 'anything', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'seeing', 'film', 'Other', 'recognizing', 'name', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'mystery', 'suppose', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'intriguing', 'controversy', 'always', 'interesting', 'Here', 'man', 'became', 'known', 'incredibly', 'strict', 'standards', 'loyalty', 'work', 'rise', 'top', 'law', 'enforcement', 'basically', 'helped', 'way', 'crimes', 'are', 'solved', 'prosecuted', 'evolve', 'what', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'today', 'who', 'basically', 'had', 'confidential', 'files', 'major', 'player', ""'d"", 'ever', 'been', 'contact', 'was', 'completely', 'clueless', 'when', 'came', 'opposite', 'sex', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'homosexual.The', 'film', 'Palmer', 'Raids', 'late', '1919', 'early', '1920', 'covers', 'everything', 'up', 'Hoover', 'death', '1972', 'constantly', 'jump', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'older', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'narrating', 'version', 'life', 'younger', 'version', 'J.', 'Edgar', '30s', 'rose', 'top', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'formed', 'FBI', 'way', 'film', 'transitions', 'early', '1930s', '1972', 'way', 'transitions', 'are', 'edited', 'part', 'film', 'charm', 'already', 'kind', 'filter', 'one', 'have', 'become', 'associated', 'most', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directorial', 'efforts', 'Everything', 'kind', 'semi-drained', 'color', 'kind', 'hazy', 'way', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'past', 'somebody', 'was', 'telling', 'story', 'cued', 'flashback', 'something.The', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'film', 'something', 'really', 'intriguing', 'core', 'presented', 'so', 'blandly', 'huge', 'explosion', 'early', 'film', 'gangsters', 'gunfire', 'dead', 'body', 'other', 'things', 'spread', 'out', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'dialogue', 'DiCaprio', 'incredibly', 'emotional', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'be', 'holding', 'back', 'rest', 'time', 'Other', 'portraying', 'different', 'accent', 'just', 'be', 'going', 'flow', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'DiCaprio', 'pull', 'together', 'later', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'practically', 'circles', 'entire', 'time', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'what', 'give', 'away', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'being', 'company', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'portrayal', 'older', 'man', 'health', 'problems', 'practically', 'spot-on', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'mother', 'Anna', 'Marie', 'Keep', 'particular', 'eye', 'Daffy', 'conversation', 'J.', 'Edgar.The', 'make-up', 'effects', 'are', 'easily', 'shoe-in', 'win', 'Oscar', 'year', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'fantastic', 'trying', 'think', 'worthy', 'competition', 'almost', 'impossible', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'perhaps', 'way', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'here', 'subtle', 'sex', 'jokes', 'became', 'increasingly', 'awkward', 'film', 'progressed', 'However', 'was', 'more', 'likely', 'purpose', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'oafish', 'kiss', 'scenes', 'cinematic', 'history', 'included', 'here', 'watching', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Zodiac', 'was', 'mostly', 'way', 'films', 'seemed', 'ease', 'conversations', 'reactions', 'revolving', 'what', 'interested', 'film', 'begin', 'rather', 'throwing', 'headfirst', 'subject', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'private', 'life', 'respectively', 'flaw', 'comparison', 'Zodiac', 'still', 'more', 'interesting', 'J.', 'Edgar.J', 'Edgar', 'off', 'longwinded', 'fairly', 'boring', 'majority', 'time', 'fascinating', 'story', 'buried', 'roots', 'somewhere', 'pen', 'paper', 'big', 'screen', 'bland', 'representation', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'became', 'movie', 'know', 'today', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'almost', 'hold', 'back', 'most', 'film', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'outshine', 'turn', 'how', 'ridiculously', 'talented', 'really', 'J.', 'Edgar', ""n't"", 'downright', 'awful', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'Even', 'only', 'played', 'minor', 'role', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'be', 'lamest', 'dullest', 'film', 'featuring', 'gangsters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

1518064,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B006OFN0BQ,DanD,"[17, 21]","Let's face it: J. Edgar Hoover is one of the more controversial figures of the 20th Century.  He was the top lawman in the nation, but he often resorted to unsavory tactics to bring down the bad guys (and kept files on a bunch of the ""good"" guys whose views he distrusted, such as JFK and Martin Luther King, Jr.).  He was a complex human being: hero and villain at the same time, insecure but powerful, distrusting even of his own emotions.  No one film could ever capture such a figure.J. EDGAR tries.  It really does.  Dustin Lance Black's (MILK) script is solid, if not quite eventful.  Despite such a volatile central figure, the closest thing to a climactic moment comes between Hoover and his rumored lover, Clyde Tolson; that would be great, if this were a film about Hoover's possible homosexuality, but it isn't.  Nor is it a film about Hoover's political subterfuge.  Or the founding of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  It's a film about all of that, which means it ends up, really, being a film about none of it.  It tries encompassing too much, and in the end, it's as though everyone involved unanimously agreed that Hoover was far too complex for that.  So they settled for something a little watered-down.That's not to say this film doesn't have its merits.  It's another solid piece of filmmaking from director Clint Eastwood.  It's not in his ""great"" category (say, UNFORGIVEN or MYSTIC RIVER); it's more like INVICTUS, which was undeniably good but otherwise unremarkable.  Likewise, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a layered performance at the titular character; it's not his best, either, but it's worth watching.  The best moments of the film come from the inferiority Hoover feels from interacting with others, namely Judi Dench as his mother, Armie Hammer as Tolson, and Naomi Watts as trustworthy secretary Helen Gandy.  It is in these moments that J. EDGAR shows glimmers of what it could have been.  Unfortunately, each relationship could easily have been its own film, and that's not even brushing the various political angles.  As is, J. EDGAR is a film that tries to do too much--but at least you know you have a solid, dependable crew behind at the helm.",3,"Well-acted and well-made, but never as gripping as it should be.",1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,2182,"['Let', 'face', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'one', 'more', 'controversial', 'figures', '20th', 'Century', 'was', 'top', 'lawman', 'nation', 'often', 'resorted', 'unsavory', 'tactics', 'bring', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'kept', 'files', 'bunch', 'good', 'guys', 'views', 'distrusted', 'such', 'JFK', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'Jr.', 'was', 'complex', 'human', 'being', 'hero', 'villain', 'same', 'time', 'insecure', 'powerful', 'distrusting', 'even', 'own', 'emotions', 'one', 'film', 'could', 'ever', 'capture', 'such', 'figure.J', 'EDGAR', 'really', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'MILK', 'script', 'solid', 'not', 'quite', 'eventful', 'such', 'volatile', 'central', 'figure', 'closest', 'thing', 'climactic', 'moment', 'Hoover', 'rumored', 'lover', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'were', 'film', 'Hoover', 'possible', 'homosexuality', ""n't"", 'film', 'Hoover', 'political', 'subterfuge', 'founding', 'Federal', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'film', 'up', 'really', 'being', 'film', 'none', 'encompassing', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'everyone', 'involved', 'unanimously', 'agreed', 'Hoover', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'complex', 'settled', 'something', 'little', 'not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'merits', 'solid', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'great', 'category', 'say', 'UNFORGIVEN', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'more', 'like', 'INVICTUS', 'was', 'undeniably', 'good', 'otherwise', 'unremarkable', 'Likewise', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'layered', 'performance', 'titular', 'character', 'not', 'best', 'either', 'worth', 'watching', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'come', 'inferiority', 'Hoover', 'feels', 'interacting', 'others', 'namely', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'mother', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'Tolson', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'trustworthy', 'secretary', 'Helen', 'Gandy', 'moments', 'J.', 'EDGAR', 'glimmers', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Unfortunately', 'relationship', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'own', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'brushing', 'various', 'political', 'angles', 'J.', 'EDGAR', 'film', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'least', 'know', 'have', 'solid', 'dependable', 'crew', 'behind', 'helm']",N/A

I thought it was fascinatingwhich is why I purchased the blu ray dvd of this movie.The fact that J Edgar Hoover came up with the card catalog system inthe Library of Congress was interesting. Before the internet and computers,that saved countless minutes for millions of students searching for a book toresearch on in the future.  This was used in every library in every State. Everyoneshould be grateful for that. The movie showed why he was fearful and strictwhen it came to enforcing the law. Anarchists and communists were thoughtto be a threat to the country. In the case of the anarchists in the early 1900s,they were a major part of history that has been virtually forgotten. The bombingsand threats to those in power can be seen clearly in the movie because of the anarchists.The shooting of the veterans parade and killing of World War I soldiers by anarchists hiddenon top of buildings, should be a parable on todays world.Nothing really changes, it just comes and goes, sometimesin circles. The idea of the movie is that he took it too far. A case can be made thathe didn't. The Bay of Pigs is overlooked in the movie and the wars in Korea and Southeast Asia.  Notto mention the countless interventions in middle and south america or latin america.Clearly the government and the citizens also took the threats seriously. Yet, the moviedoesn't seem to go into this subject and seems to focus solely on the actions of one man,clearly taken out of context in the movie.  I'm not sure if they were trying to make him look bad or what.They could have showed more of his accomplishments in the later years I believe.  J Edgar Hoover had nothing to do with these typesof wars or interventions during the 1950s up to the early 1970s. He just secured the country from within, whichis what the FBI was suppose to do. So what exactly haschanged you may ask. Other than it seems to have gotten more bloated and powerfulin regards to the law than it has ever been, with each new threat towards us from any country or any one person.Maybe we can look upon this movie and notconjure up these thoughts but to look at it from the perspective of J Egar Hoover.

1518070,A30E2YL894IX7Y,B006OFN0BQ,D. Doppes,"[7, 9]","Clint Eastwood's latest masterpiece covers the highs and lows of J Edgar Hoover's rise to power. Clint has been on a serious roll for several years now. And we can add this film towards the top of his directing resume. There is so much ground to cover in J Edgar's life and career its impossible to cover everything. This is where many people feel this film came up short. Well for over 2 hours, Mr. Eastwood has crafted an entertaining look at a complex figure in our nations history. There are some areas that he chose not to explore too deeply - and that was probably a wise move.J Edgar's career is not the only focus in the film. His relationships with his mother as well as his number 2 man- Clyde Tolson are also part of the fabric of this film. He is so close to his mother and values her opinions that he lives with her for much of his younger years. And you can sense that when the time comes when he will be without his mother, it will be very difficult on Edgar. He also developes a very close relationship with his number 2 man. This relationship is put to the test in several scenes, as both men struggle with their feelings. Mr.Toloson, although questioned by Edgar about his loyalty is always there for Edgar. He loves Edgar very deeply and the feeling is mutual. But Mr.Tolson's feelings run a little deeper and exposes this more when Edgar mentions that he wants to marry a woman. Its one of the more powerful scenes in the movie.The film follows Edgar from his early investigations into communist radicals in the 1919/1920 era until the Nixon administration comes to Washington. In the early days Edgar has many new ideas that he has to put into place to make the bureau stronger and able to conduct the type of work that he feels is right to get the job done. There is opposition. His ideals and suggestions meet resistance. But in the end ideas like finger printing and crime lab work win out. When America cheers on the mobsters on the big screen, Edgar is trying to end their rein on the streets. In his mind he is making all the arrests and he adores the attention of cleaning the streets of thugs. But is this reality? The Lindberg kidnapping is covered very well here. Where the crime scene and evidence from the crime scene showcase Edgar's beliefs in solving cases. The cops appear to be sloppy and often overlook key pieces of evidience. The film follows Edgar through the Kennedy era and civil rights with Dr.King. There certainly wouldn't be enough time in a movie like this to explore everything. But the events are touched on with the right amount of attention for each moment in history.This is Leonardo Dicaprio's finest acting performance. I haven't seen every one of his films, but I have seen almost all of them. He plays this role so well and with conviction. I can think of no other actor that could have done a better job. This isn't just a role about a man in a particular time period. He has to play Edgar through several decades. And he pulls this off quite well. I was very impressed with him in this movie.  Armie Hammer is also excellent as Clyde Tolson. Another great performance that won't be forgotten. I felt like his performance was very strong as Mr.Tolson was in his declining years. He played the part of a frail man with a stroke very well. He had the mannerisms down for this type of decline. Naomi Watts does a nice job as Mr.Hoover's secretary. She devotes her life to the bureaus work and has to put up with Edgar's decisions in sometimes difficult circumstances. And like Mr.Tolson, Miss Gandy is reliable in every situation- especially the end. And the makeup for this film was great. They did a stellar job of creating these characters as they age through the years.I give this  4 1/2 stars. It would be great to have seen a little more, but most people wouldn't enjoy a movie much longer than this one. Edgar held secret files on presidents and other powerful figures- and for over 2 hours our minds were entertainedThe BLu Ray also comes with a nice little feature on J Edgar the man from those involved with the film. Eastwood, Dicaprio and several others comment on the different sides to J Edgar- good and bad. And what his place in history might have been if things were different. Definately worth checking out.",5,When morals decline and good men do nothing- Evil flourishes,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,4281,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'latest', 'masterpiece', 'highs', 'lows', 'J', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'rise', 'power', 'Clint', 'been', 'serious', 'roll', 'several', 'years', 'now', 'can', 'add', 'film', 'top', 'directing', 'resume', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'cover', 'J', 'Edgar', 'life', 'career', 'impossible', 'cover', 'everything', 'where', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'film', 'came', 'up', 'short', 'Well', '2', 'hours', 'Mr.', 'Eastwood', 'crafted', 'entertaining', 'look', 'complex', 'figure', 'nations', 'history', 'are', 'areas', 'chose', 'not', 'explore', 'too', 'deeply', 'was', 'probably', 'wise', 'move.J', 'Edgar', 'career', 'not', 'only', 'focus', 'film', 'relationships', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'number', '2', 'man-', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'are', 'also', 'part', 'fabric', 'film', 'so', 'close', 'mother', 'opinions', 'much', 'younger', 'years', 'can', 'sense', 'when', 'time', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'mother', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'Edgar', 'also', 'very', 'close', 'relationship', 'number', '2', 'man', 'relationship', 'put', 'test', 'several', 'scenes', 'men', 'struggle', 'feelings', 'Mr.Toloson', 'questioned', 'Edgar', 'loyalty', 'always', 'Edgar', 'Edgar', 'very', 'deeply', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'Mr.Tolson', 'feelings', 'run', 'little', 'deeper', 'more', 'when', 'Edgar', 'mentions', 'marry', 'woman', 'one', 'more', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'movie.The', 'film', 'Edgar', 'early', 'investigations', 'communist', 'radicals', '1919/1920', 'era', 'Nixon', 'administration', 'Washington', 'early', 'days', 'Edgar', 'many', 'new', 'ideas', 'put', 'place', 'make', 'bureau', 'stronger', 'able', 'conduct', 'type', 'work', 'right', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'opposition', 'ideals', 'suggestions', 'meet', 'resistance', 'end', 'ideas', 'finger', 'printing', 'crime', 'lab', 'work', 'win', 'out', 'When', 'America', 'cheers', 'mobsters', 'big', 'screen', 'Edgar', 'trying', 'end', 'rein', 'streets', 'mind', 'making', 'arrests', 'attention', 'cleaning', 'streets', 'thugs', 'reality', 'Lindberg', 'kidnapping', 'covered', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'Where', 'crime', 'scene', 'evidence', 'crime', 'scene', 'showcase', 'Edgar', 'beliefs', 'solving', 'cases', 'cops', 'appear', 'be', 'sloppy', 'often', 'overlook', 'key', 'pieces', 'evidience', 'film', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy', 'era', 'civil', 'rights', 'Dr.King', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'time', 'movie', 'explore', 'everything', 'events', 'are', 'touched', 'right', 'amount', 'attention', 'moment', 'history.This', 'Leonardo', 'Dicaprio', 'finest', 'acting', 'performance', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'conviction', 'can', 'think', 'other', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', ""n't"", 'just', 'role', 'man', 'particular', 'time', 'period', 'play', 'Edgar', 'several', 'decades', 'off', 'quite', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'movie', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'also', 'excellent', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'great', 'performance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'forgotten', 'felt', 'performance', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'Mr.Tolson', 'was', 'declining', 'years', 'played', 'part', 'frail', 'man', 'stroke', 'very', 'well', 'had', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'type', 'decline', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'nice', 'job', 'Mr.Hoover', 'secretary', 'life', 'bureaus', 'work', 'put', 'up', 'Edgar', 'decisions', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'Mr.Tolson', 'Miss', 'Gandy', 'reliable', 'situation-', 'especially', 'end', 'makeup', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'did', 'stellar', 'job', 'creating', 'characters', 'age', 'years.I', 'give', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'more', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'much', 'longer', 'one', 'Edgar', 'held', 'secret', 'files', 'presidents', 'other', 'powerful', 'figures-', '2', 'hours', 'minds', 'were', 'entertainedThe', 'BLu', 'Ray', 'also', 'nice', 'little', 'feature', 'J', 'Edgar', 'man', 'involved', 'film', 'Eastwood', 'Dicaprio', 'several', 'others', 'comment', 'different', 'sides', 'J', 'Edgar-', 'good', 'bad', 'what', 'place', 'history', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'things', 'were', 'different', 'Definately', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A
1518071,A178M2RQGZBU9L,B006OFN0BQ,Dean,"[2, 2]","I have to say that I enjoyed this film overall. J. Edgar Hoover is a difficult subject to approach as a film, he was a man liked by almost no one, and feared and loathed by many, which makes him difficult to use as a sympathetic character, and indeed most of the time he's not. J. Edgar Hoover was also a man very much caught up in his own myth, and the film does a good job of showing that. Leonardo DiCaprio does a very good job of bringing the character to life, though I suspect the real J. Edgar was an altogether stiffer and more opaque person. The director (wisely, probably) chose not to delve to deeply into Hoover's alleged homosexuality, choosing to portray him as a celibate closeted gay man, sharing a close friendship with another obviously gay man, but never ""consummating"" it. Given how little is really known of Hoover's private life, this was probably the prudent choice for this part of the film. The film does a very good job of capturing the style and look of the time accurately, the clothes, cars, interiors, lighting, it's all very authentic looking. We are removed enough from the Hoover era at this point where for most people he's a relatively enigmatic character at this point, far removed from the ""G-man"" hero he wanted to be remembered as, and also far removed from the fearsome trampler of rights and prolific spy and wiretapper who was so feared and reviled while he was in power.

1518078,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B006OFN0BQ,Doug Park,"[7, 8]","As others have mentioned, ""J. Edgar"" is more of a character study than a straightforward biography or documentary, and there are times when ""soap opera"" might be a better term. The general picture it paints is one of an ultra-neurotic buffoon, albeit one with a few admirable qualities. Although Hoover may have been a hard guy to completely like or admire, it just seems the creators had some issues with their subject that show through a bit too obviously. Also, the way the film reverberates between public (Hoover's formation of the FBI, Communist subversives, kidnapping of the Lindbergh's baby, etc) and private life (his close relationship with his overbearing mother, awkwardness with most other women,workaholism,cross-dressing and apparent latent homosexuality, etc) gives it a patchy feeling. Granted, coverage of both areas is necessary, and they are not easy ones for a director to synthesize. Nevertheless, some bad choices were made here regarding what to include and what not to. There is nothing, for example, on the prosecution of the Rosenbergs or the FBI's role during the Vietnam War years. I, for one, would have liked to see more on such areas and less on Hoover's family life (or lack thereof) and his relationship with his right-hand man, Clyde Tolson.Despite the long time-span it covers, ""J. Edgar"" is smooth enough to follow, and Hoover's conflicting qualities--e.g., insistence on professional conduct and limitations of the Bureau's jurisdiction, yet, defiance of his own standards by becoming a sort of Rona Barrett of Washington--are often quite intriguing. Still, a linear biography told from a more distant and objective third person perspective might have worked better as the structure of this film.Most of the acting is tepid, but Judi Dench and Naomi Watts both give admirable performances as the two important women in Hoover's life (though I agree, the make-up is terrible).",3,The Story Just Isn't Complete,1348790400,"09 28, 2012",2012,1914,"['others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'straightforward', 'biography', 'documentary', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'soap', 'opera', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'term', 'general', 'picture', 'one', 'ultra-neurotic', 'buffoon', 'one', 'few', 'admirable', 'qualities', 'Hoover', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'guy', 'completely', 'admire', 'just', 'creators', 'had', 'issues', 'subject', 'show', 'bit', 'too', 'obviously', 'Also', 'way', 'film', 'public', 'Hoover', 'formation', 'FBI', 'Communist', 'kidnapping', 'Lindbergh', 'baby', 'etc', 'private', 'life', 'close', 'relationship', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'awkwardness', 'most', 'other', 'women', 'workaholism', 'cross-dressing', 'apparent', 'latent', 'homosexuality', 'etc', 'patchy', 'feeling', 'Granted', 'coverage', 'areas', 'necessary', 'are', 'not', 'easy', 'ones', 'director', 'synthesize', 'Nevertheless', 'bad', 'choices', 'were', 'made', 'here', 'regarding', 'what', 'include', 'what', 'not', 'nothing', 'example', 'prosecution', 'Rosenbergs', 'FBI', 'role', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'years', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'such', 'areas', 'less', 'Hoover', 'family', 'life', 'lack', 'thereof', 'relationship', 'right-hand', 'man', 'Clyde', 'Tolson.Despite', 'long', 'time-span', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'smooth', 'enough', 'follow', 'Hoover', 'conflicting', 'qualities', 'e.g.', 'insistence', 'professional', 'conduct', 'limitations', 'Bureau', 'jurisdiction', 'yet', 'defiance', 'own', 'standards', 'becoming', 'sort', 'Rona', 'Barrett', 'Washington', 'are', 'often', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'Still', 'linear', 'biography', 'told', 'more', 'distant', 'objective', 'third', 'person', 'perspective', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'structure', 'film.Most', 'acting', 'tepid', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'give', 'admirable', 'performances', 'two', 'important', 'women', 'Hoover', 'life', 'agree', 'make-up', 'terrible']",N/A

Yet part of the brain knows it is participating in make believe -- otherwise we would be psychotic. This suspension of disbelief is not automatic, however. The responsibility of the medium is to present its subject matter with as much realism as possible to assist the viewer's imagination. So a film that takes place in the 1930s will have old cars and old clothing, etc., to lend authenticity and facilitate the suspension of disbelief. The job of the actors is to perform their craft with such transparency that the audience can believe in the authenticity of the characters. Spencer Tracy, when asked for his definition of good acting, replied, ""Never let them catch you doing it.""My beef with J. Edgar is that Leonardo DiCaprio with globs of make-up does not J. Edgar Hoover make. And I wonder: Why do some of Hollywood's best directors make this same mistake? In The Aviator, superb director Martin Scorsese asked my imagination to accept this same Leonardo as Howard Hughes. I have enjoyed DiCaprio in a number of lighter roles (e.g., he was fine in Titanic) but as Hughes? Not a chance. Incredible miscasting, Mr. Scorsese, shame on you. And shame on Clint Eastwood, who has turned in so many wonderful films, for slinging a ton of make-up on this boyish actor and asking him to inhabit the skin of a character who is as un-boyish as you can get, namely Hoover. The result is a film that lacks a credible center.Instead of portraying Mr. Hoover as the monster that he was, J. Edgar is a film about a momma's boy who is a paranoid clown. Eastwood attempts to dramatize important events in the history of the FBI and what he delivers is light comedy. A good example is Eastwood's treatment of the homosexual relationship between Hoover and his aide, Clyde Tolson: The two men are alone in a hotel suite. Hoover admits having had an affair with Dorothy Lamour (the thought of which is hilarious in its own right) and he and Tolson wind up on the floor in a mock fight that is reminiscent of the Three Stooges. Another example is Hoover's penchant for firing anyone who tries to upstage him, which becomes nothing more than a silly motif. In another scene, Eleanor Roosevelt is exposed for having an affair with a woman. This kind of intrusion into the private lives of individuals, an example of Hoover's vindictiveness, made me laugh instead of feeling disgust for Hoover.Much of the film is delivered in flash-back. Unfortunately Mr. DiCaprio's acting as a young Hoover is the same as his acting as an older Hoover with the exception of the make-up. His side-kick Tolson fares even worse in this regard. His make-up is a left-over from a Mummy film. At one point, Tolson faints and Hoover shouts, ""Get a doctor!"" I turned to the person sitting next to me and said, ""Get a make-up artist!"" In terms of Hoover's character and what made him tick, I learned nothing from this screenplay except for a few broad strokes, e.g., Hoover's obsession with his mother. The intense, dangerous bulldog that I think of when I conjure up a portrait of J. Edgar Hoover was nowhere to be found.On top of all this, the pacing of the film is geriatric. My friend kept falling asleep and I had to nudge her several times. The one aspect that kept me awake was the story of the Lindbergh kidnapping, which should have been the subject of the film rather than this shallow look at a complex public figure.",2,Hoover as quaint clown doesn't cut it,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3529,"['magic', 'films', 'stage', 'plays', 'audience', 'belief', 'system', 'two', 'hours', 'observing', 'reality', 'part', 'brain', 'participating', 'make', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'psychotic', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'not', 'automatic', 'however', 'responsibility', 'medium', 'present', 'subject', 'matter', 'as', 'much', 'realism', 'possible', 'assist', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'film', 'place', '1930s', 'will', 'have', 'old', 'cars', 'old', 'clothing', 'etc.', 'lend', 'authenticity', 'facilitate', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'job', 'actors', 'perform', 'craft', 'such', 'transparency', 'audience', 'can', 'believe', 'authenticity', 'characters', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'when', 'asked', 'definition', 'good', 'acting', 'replied', 'Never', 'let', 'catch', 'doing', 'beef', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'globs', 'make-up', 'not', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'make', 'wonder', 'Why', 'do', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'directors', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'Aviator', 'superb', 'director', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'asked', 'imagination', 'accept', 'same', 'Leonardo', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'DiCaprio', 'number', 'lighter', 'roles', 'e.g.', 'was', 'fine', 'Titanic', 'Hughes', 'Not', 'chance', 'Incredible', 'miscasting', 'Mr.', 'Scorsese', 'shame', 'shame', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'turned', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'films', 'slinging', 'ton', 'make-up', 'boyish', 'actor', 'asking', 'inhabit', 'skin', 'character', 'who', 'as', 'un-boyish', 'can', 'get', 'namely', 'Hoover', 'result', 'film', 'credible', 'center.Instead', 'portraying', 'Mr.', 'Hoover', 'monster', 'was', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'film', 'momma', 'boy', 'who', 'paranoid', 'clown', 'Eastwood', 'attempts', 'dramatize', 'important', 'events', 'history', 'FBI', 'what', 'light', 'comedy', 'good', 'example', 'Eastwood', 'treatment', 'homosexual', 'relationship', 'Hoover', 'aide', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'alone', 'hotel', 'suite', 'Hoover', 'having', 'had', 'affair', 'Dorothy', 'Lamour', 'thought', 'hilarious', 'own', 'right', 'Tolson', 'wind', 'up', 'floor', 'mock', 'fight', 'reminiscent', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'example', 'Hoover', 'penchant', 'firing', 'anyone', 'who', 'upstage', 'nothing', 'more', 'silly', 'motif', 'scene', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'exposed', 'having', 'affair', 'woman', 'kind', 'intrusion', 'private', 'lives', 'individuals', 'example', 'Hoover', 'vindictiveness', 'made', 'instead', 'feeling', 'disgust', 'Hoover.Much', 'film', 'delivered', 'flash-back', 'Unfortunately', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'acting', 'young', 'Hoover', 'same', 'acting', 'older', 'Hoover', 'exception', 'make-up', 'side-kick', 'Tolson', 'fares', 'even', 'worse', 'regard', 'make-up', 'left-over', 'Mummy', 'film', 'one', 'point', 'Tolson', 'faints', 'Hoover', 'Get', 'doctor', 'turned', 'person', 'sitting', 'next', 'said', 'Get', 'make-up', 'artist', 'terms', 'Hoover', 'character', 'what', 'made', 'tick', 'learned', 'nothing', 'screenplay', 'few', 'broad', 'strokes', 'e.g.', 'Hoover', 'obsession', 'mother', 'intense', 'dangerous', 'bulldog', 'think', 'when', 'conjure', 'up', 'portrait', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'was', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found.On', 'top', 'pacing', 'film', 'geriatric', 'friend', 'kept', 'falling', 'asleep', 'had', 'nudge', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'aspect', 'kept', 'awake', 'was', 'story', 'Lindbergh', 'kidnapping', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'film', 'rather', 'shallow', 'look', 'complex', 'public', 'figure']",N/A

Clint Eastwood, 2011, 126 mins.) is one of the highlights of film - and one of the finest 'biopics' ever crafted. It is always my pleasure and honor to be able to say, after watching an Eastwood film, that it is among the finest I've ever seen. This film is no exception.The movie is precisely a biopic of the FBI director (and essentially its founder), really no more and no less. Do not let anyone tell you a pitch-perfect biography is easy for a director to do. In recent films, the couple of pathetic appearances by lousy bit-players in the role of Hoover only added to the need for this film.Done partly from flashbacks and partly from an elderly Hoover's own narration - as he dictates his memoires about finding and arresting Baby Lindbergh's kidnapper - the film deftly flashes backward and forward in time, leading us from the start of his dictation, flashing back to his start as director of the Bureau of Investigation.It continues in this way, back-and-forth, showing every detail as most Hoover students know it. Nothing is over-the-top, as Eastwood is a man of subtleties. Even Deputy Director Clyde Tolson (the gorgeous Armie Hammer), who was as close to a spouse as Hoover ever had, is beautifully and quietly portrayed. Dame Judi Dench as Hoover's mother is sparkling and convincing. Every actor in this film is breathtaking - whether shown only for seconds, such as Manu Intiraymi (STAR TREK VOYAGER) as the infamous Alvin Karpis, or shown constantly like the eternal presence of Hoover's faithful secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts).Leo DiCaprio is no slouch here. While the makeup is Oscar-worthy and I can't imagine Oscar skipping over the achievement, it is DiCaprio at his finest. Perhaps above and beyond his finest. There is a mean, snotty, Jon Voigt-like quality in his aged Hoover; the youthful Hoover is just nervous and goofy enough to be believable to those of us who remember him when he was a younger man.I believe DiCaprio has an Oscar in the can for this; likewise Eastwood.

1518085,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B006OFN0BQ,Erik North,"[1, 2]","In the history of America during the 20th century, few people were as revered, admired, feared, and hated (sometimes all at once) as J. Edgar Hoover, the mercurial, often-paranoid man who ruled over the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1924 until his death in 1972.  In his time, he saw the expunging of Communist subversives, the destruction of Depression-era gangsters like John Dillinger, and an ability to keep tabs and files on people in high places in the U.S. government, including all the presidents and attorneys general that he held sway over, not to mention even ordinary citizens whom he felt were disloyal to American values.  But there was that one personal secret of his that he definitely did not want getting out, which would have destroyed the image he had built up of himself as the toughest law enforcement chief there was.  All of Hoover's aspects, savory and unsavory alike, are shown in great detail by director Clint Eastwood in J. EDGAR, one of the great biopics of recent vintage.Told largely in flashbacks that span the first indications in 1919 of a Bolshevik revolution threatening America, to 1972, when Hoover died, J. EDGAR stars Leonardo DiCaprio in a mesmerizing performance as the tough-as-nails FBI man who prided himself of getting rid of the rotten elements in American society, and ordering his bureau and his agents to live up to his professional standards of loyalty and patriotism.  Both Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black depict the great things Hoover's FBI did, but they don't whitewash the fact that he was also a shameless, unapologetic huckster and salesman at boosting the FBI image at home and abroad, sometimes even boosting his own image by taking credit for certain big FBI catches (capturing the killer of Charles Lindbergh's baby; the killing of Dillinger) that he was never even present at--and, of course, the fact that his relationship with his close aid Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) was, how shall we say, more than merely professional.  Eastwood, more content now to be behind the camera than in front of it, gets a great performance out of DiCaprio, as well as solid turns by Naomi Watts (as Hoover's long-time secretary Helen Gundy), Dame Judi Dench (as his mother Annie), and Jessica Hecht as the notorious subversive Emma Goldman, most of them unrecognizable, including DiCaprio, under all the prosthetics and make-up, but still able to deliver the goods.As a director, Eastwood proved long ago, going all the way back to his directing debut PLAY MISTY FOR ME in 1971, that he was more than just Dirty Harry or the Man With No Name, that he was a director of offbeat and extremely challenging projects, whether or not he was also on the other side of the camera as an actor.  Recent films of his like CHANGELING, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, INVICTUS, HEREAFTER, and MILLION DOLLAR BABY proved this; and J. EDGAR does as well.  This is a film to be appreciated, not only for its detail, but also for giving us an unvarnished glimpse into a man who, regardless of how one feels about him, changed the face of American law enforcement forever, sometimes for the best, and yet just as often for the worst.",5,"America's Top G Man--Warts (Lots Of Them) And All, Courtesy Of Eastwood",1321315200,"11 15, 2011",2011,3173,"['history', 'America', '20th', 'century', 'few', 'people', 'were', 'revered', 'admired', 'feared', 'hated', 'sometimes', 'once', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'mercurial', 'often-paranoid', 'man', 'who', 'ruled', 'Federal', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', '1924', 'death', '1972', 'time', 'saw', 'expunging', 'Communist', 'subversives', 'destruction', 'Depression-era', 'gangsters', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'ability', 'keep', 'tabs', 'files', 'people', 'high', 'places', 'U.S.', 'government', 'including', 'presidents', 'attorneys', 'general', 'held', 'sway', 'not', 'mention', 'even', 'ordinary', 'citizens', 'whom', 'felt', 'were', 'disloyal', 'American', 'values', 'was', 'one', 'personal', 'secret', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'getting', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'destroyed', 'image', 'had', 'built', 'toughest', 'law', 'enforcement', 'chief', 'there', 'was', 'Hoover', 'aspects', 'savory', 'unsavory', 'alike', 'are', 'shown', 'great', 'detail', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'J.', 'EDGAR', 'one', 'great', 'biopics', 'recent', 'vintage.Told', 'largely', 'flashbacks', 'span', 'first', 'indications', '1919', 'Bolshevik', 'revolution', 'threatening', 'America', '1972', 'when', 'Hoover', 'died', 'J.', 'EDGAR', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'tough-as-nails', 'FBI', 'man', 'who', 'prided', 'getting', 'rid', 'rotten', 'elements', 'American', 'society', 'ordering', 'bureau', 'agents', 'live', 'up', 'professional', 'standards', 'loyalty', 'patriotism', 'Eastwood', 'screenwriter', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'depict', 'great', 'things', 'Hoover', 'FBI', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'whitewash', 'fact', 'was', 'also', 'shameless', 'unapologetic', 'huckster', 'salesman', 'boosting', 'FBI', 'image', 'home', 'abroad', 'sometimes', 'even', 'boosting', 'own', 'image', 'taking', 'credit', 'certain', 'big', 'FBI', 'catches', 'capturing', 'killer', 'Charles', 'Lindbergh', 'baby', 'killing', 'Dillinger', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'present', 'course', 'fact', 'relationship', 'close', 'aid', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'was', 'how', 'shall', 'say', 'more', 'merely', 'professional', 'Eastwood', 'more', 'content', 'now', 'be', 'camera', 'front', 'great', 'performance', 'DiCaprio', 'as', 'well', 'solid', 'turns', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Hoover', 'long-time', 'secretary', 'Helen', 'Gundy', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'mother', 'Annie', 'Jessica', 'Hecht', 'notorious', 'subversive', 'Emma', 'Goldman', 'most', 'unrecognizable', 'including', 'DiCaprio', 'prosthetics', 'make-up', 'still', 'able', 'deliver', 'goods.As', 'director', 'Eastwood', 'proved', 'long', 'ago', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'directing', 'debut', 'PLAY', 'MISTY', 'ME', '1971', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'Man', 'Name', 'was', 'director', 'offbeat', 'extremely', 'challenging', 'projects', 'not', 'was', 'also', 'other', 'side', 'camera', 'actor', 'Recent', 'films', 'CHANGELING', 'LETTERS', 'FROM', 'IWO', 'JIMA', 'INVICTUS', 'HEREAFTER', 'MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'BABY', 'proved', 'J.', 'EDGAR', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'be', 'appreciated', 'not', 'only', 'detail', 'also', 'giving', 'unvarnished', 'glimpse', 'man', 'who', 'regardless', 'how', 'one', 'changed', 'face', 'American', 'law', 'enforcement', 'forever', 'sometimes', 'best', 'yet', 'just', 'as', 'often', 'worst']",N/A

1518096,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006OFN0BQ,Grady Harp,"[1, 3]","J. EDGAR is a cinematic accomplishment of the first order! From the screenplay (Dustin Lance Black) as acted by a host of consummate actors and directed with extreme sensitivity by Clint Eastwood, the sum of the parts is an extraordinary achievement in presenting a portrait of one of the strangest men in history.  The manner in which the life and deeds and personality are woven together presents as full an image of a man of contradictions, a man who planned to have his personal files destroyed after his death in order to maintain the iconic image he so desperately desired, is nothing short of a work of dedicated investigation on parts of everyone involved.  And electing to tell this story through the ever-changing  chameleon aspects of this bizarre man by shifting from youth to old age in a constant parenthetical manner was a stroke of genius.The rise of young John Edgar Hoover from a mother-favored child, through the emotional conflicts this mother worship produced, through the sightings of incidents suggestive of early 'Bolshevik' interference/threat in this country that Hoover focused on in his usurping power as the head of the newly formed Federal Bureau of Investigation, provides a background from which we can observe the morphing of this obsessed man.  The act of staging press conferences around the Lindbergh case and the capture of the big criminals of the day were manipulated to give Hoover supreme power to investigate 'threatening people of interest' by wire taping, spying, etc. But all of this runs parallel to the personal story of Hoover's private sexual life.  From his living with his mother until her death, to his incompetent attempt to force himself on the woman who would be his secretary throughout his career, to his bonding with Clyde Tolson who he chose to be his assistant and never was far from his side, to his final hours when Tolson though suffering from the residuum of a stroke was the only person Hoover could trust as Richard Nixon planned his destruction.Each of the incidents that highlighted Hoover's long career as founder and head of the FBI is presented well, but it is the de-mystification of Hoover the vulnerable man beneath the tyrannical faade that makes this film so extremely powerful. That is due to the script and the direction, of course, but it is also due in large part to the brilliant portrayal of this enigmatic beast of a pathetic man by Leonardo DiCaprio: he remains credible throughout and moves through the aging process and intermittent flashbacks to his younger days with complete ease and credibility.  Likewise the performances of Judi Dench as his strange mother ('I'd rather my son be dead than be a daffodil' - her term for 'gay'), of Naomi Watts as his secretary who thwarts Hoover's initial awkward physical advances to become his lifelong supporter, and of Armie Hammer as Hoover's love interest Clyde Tolson acted with such a full range of emotion and subtlety that he is completely credible - these key roles are all of Oscar caliber as supporting roles.Eastwood's careful casting of actors for the roles of Charles Lindbergh (Josh Lucas), Eisenhower (Gunner Wright), Franklin Roosevelt (David A. Cooper), Harlan Fiske Stone (Ken Howard), Robert Kennedy (Jeffrey Donovan), Colonel Schwarzkopf (Dermot Mulroney), Bruno Hauptmann (Damon Herriman), Richard Nixon (Christopher Shyer), and Haldeman (Larkin Campbell) gives the audience the opportunity to catch glimpses of the people influenced by Hoover without stooping to caricatures.But in the end it is the slow dissection of the relationship between Hoover and Tolson that is the most powerful element of this film.  The audience is left with little doubt that these men were, in truth,  lovers without the expected obvious stereotypical activities and conversations.  It is an act of greatness on the parts of all involved, and for this reason probably more than any other aspect of this huge film, this biopic deserves to be in the lineup for Best Picture of the Year.

However, the movie is a huge disappointment. It's too long, bloated and homoerotic. I mean homoerotic in that it's heavily implied that Hoover and Tolson were lovers (which was probably true), or that at the very least shared a mutual attraction for each other that went beyond friendship. A lot of scenes had either both of them holding hands and whispering heavy innuendo to each other, and one scene had Tolson kiss Hoover when Hoover mentioned that he'd been intimate with a woman. One scene is enough to imply their sexual perversion or mutual attraction to each other...and it CAN BE DONE DISCREETLY, instead of the shockingly overt manner in which it was portrayed (Hoover saying pathetically that he loved Tolson after the latter stormed out is the only example I can think of where a person's sexual preference can be implied without anything else).Rated R (a kiss between two men, two uses of a vulgar term for a gay person, a sexual situation between a female & a male via very suggestive sounds & shadows, one use of the f-word and some violence).",1,"Long, Bloated & Erotic...",1351036800,"10 24, 2012",2012,1262,"['1st', 'Note', 'saw', 'movie', 'XFinity', 'Demand', '2nd', 'Note', 'Amazon', 'deleted', 'original', 'review', 'have', 'lightly', 'edited', 'it.I', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'interested', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'directed', 'However', 'movie', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'too', 'long', 'bloated', 'homoerotic', 'mean', 'homoerotic', 'heavily', 'implied', 'Hoover', 'Tolson', 'were', 'lovers', 'was', 'probably', 'true', 'very', 'least', 'shared', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'other', 'went', 'friendship', 'lot', 'scenes', 'had', 'holding', 'hands', 'whispering', 'heavy', 'innuendo', 'other', 'one', 'scene', 'had', 'Tolson', 'kiss', 'Hoover', 'when', 'Hoover', 'mentioned', ""'d"", 'been', 'intimate', 'woman', 'One', 'scene', 'enough', 'imply', 'sexual', 'perversion', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'other', 'CAN', 'BE', 'DONE', 'DISCREETLY', 'instead', 'shockingly', 'overt', 'manner', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Hoover', 'saying', 'pathetically', 'loved', 'Tolson', 'latter', 'stormed', 'out', 'only', 'example', 'can', 'think', 'where', 'person', 'sexual', 'preference', 'can', 'be', 'implied', 'anything', 'else', '.Rated', 'R', 'kiss', 'two', 'men', 'two', 'uses', 'vulgar', 'term', 'gay', 'person', 'sexual', 'situation', 'female', 'male', 'very', 'suggestive', 'sounds', 'shadows', 'one', 'use', 'f-word', 'violence']",N/A

1518107,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B006OFN0BQ,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[39, 49]","I will be short on this film because it probably is one of the best by Clint Eastwood.First the actors. They have to cover a whole life and it starts in their early twenties and ends in their late seventies with diseases and death. It is not only a question of special makeup effects but it is a question of deportment, behaviour, rhythm, flexibility, credibility at any age in their facial expressions and their language. It takes time, a lot of training and great talent to do that. If it were easy they would all do it. Very few actually can.Second the institutional subject. The creation of the FBI. Its transformation from a semi-clandestine agency to a scientific, well trained and very effective and diligent institution. The film is clear how difficult it was to get laws passed and finances granted by Congress. Some of the arguments were opportunistic and some were logical, but they all had only one aim: to get what it needs to become the best. J. Edgar Hoover was in a way irritating in his way to serialize the action of the FBI for the nascent mass-media that the radio and the cinema were becoming. He was extremely disturbing in his umbilical ego-centeredness or ego-centricity. But that was him and the actor is able to render this cold, calculated and very tense character who had a problem with public elocution and had managed to overcome it with an extremely strict discipline.That leads to his action and his vision of the FBI. He was extremely authoritative and manipulative. He never took no for an answer and for him one no was always a disguised and hidden yes. He accumulated information on all the people he could one day depend on, politicians, congressmen and justices or judges, to blackmail them if necessary. He generally had his way and one of his major failures was with Martin Luther King that he could not blackmail into refusing the Nobel Peace Prize. The film is at times on the very verge of being embarrassing, though it only speaks of dead figures because it is dealing with rumors on Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Richard Nixon and a few others. I am not even sure some of the information is not frankly false.But Clint Eastwood is a patriot and he shows the patriotic side of the character with insistence and weight, to the point of reaching bigotry at times, for example on the subject of racism. He built the FBI in the fight against the anarchist and communist movement in the 20s and 30s, against the gangsters of the 20s and Prohibition, against the Germans in the 30s too, without specifying the political innuendo of the national reference in 1934 among Americans questioned by the FBI about someone who had a German accent. No nuance. Clint Eastwood gives his matter raw and uncooked at all.But Clint Eastwood reaches beyond these elements to capture the real personal and intimate dimension of his character. And here he is not using innuendo and allusions. J. Edgar Hoover's relation with his direct deputy is seen as a sentimental relation on the side of the deputy and an emotional relation on the side of J. Edgar Hoover himself. The tremendous condemnation of any gay orientation by his mother creates in him a tremendous struggle due to his attachment to his mother. The truth will come at the very end with a friendly even paternal kiss to his deputy on the night before dying. He will explain how he recruited him because he needed someone and he knew that young man needed a strong paternal figure that he accepted to be.Of course the revelation of the love of that young man for his boss is dramatized by Clint Eastwood, and maybe even too much because that was the intimate and private life of two men who did not reveal anything in public, far from it. But it is done with such delicacy, tenderness. J. Edgar Hoover appears in the film as having compensated the absence of a father figure and the presence of a strong authoritarian mother figure on his side, by playing that father figure with his direct deputy who needed such a father figure. The compensated lack of J. Edgar Hoover became the satisfaction of the need of his deputy. So much alike and yet so different.That personal touch in this film makes the film a lot more fascinating because it speaks of something that may happen to anyone: love is the only thing that survives in life and is stronger than even hatred as J. Edgar Hoover explains as he is climbing the stairs to his bedroom for the very last time in his life.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,"No excuse, no escape: this is a masterpiece",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,4507,"['will', 'be', 'short', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'Clint', 'Eastwood.First', 'actors', 'have', 'cover', 'whole', 'life', 'early', 'twenties', 'ends', 'late', 'seventies', 'diseases', 'death', 'not', 'only', 'question', 'special', 'makeup', 'effects', 'question', 'deportment', 'behaviour', 'rhythm', 'flexibility', 'credibility', 'age', 'facial', 'expressions', 'language', 'time', 'lot', 'training', 'great', 'talent', 'do', 'were', 'easy', 'would', 'do', 'Very', 'few', 'actually', 'can.Second', 'institutional', 'subject', 'creation', 'FBI', 'transformation', 'semi-clandestine', 'agency', 'scientific', 'well', 'trained', 'very', 'effective', 'diligent', 'institution', 'film', 'clear', 'how', 'difficult', 'was', 'get', 'laws', 'passed', 'finances', 'granted', 'Congress', 'arguments', 'were', 'opportunistic', 'were', 'logical', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'aim', 'get', 'what', 'become', 'best', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'was', 'way', 'irritating', 'way', 'serialize', 'action', 'FBI', 'nascent', 'mass-media', 'radio', 'cinema', 'were', 'becoming', 'was', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'umbilical', 'ego-centeredness', 'ego-centricity', 'was', 'actor', 'able', 'render', 'cold', 'calculated', 'very', 'tense', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'problem', 'public', 'elocution', 'had', 'managed', 'overcome', 'extremely', 'strict', 'discipline.That', 'action', 'vision', 'FBI', 'was', 'extremely', 'authoritative', 'manipulative', 'never', 'took', 'answer', 'one', 'was', 'always', 'disguised', 'hidden', 'yes', 'accumulated', 'information', 'people', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'depend', 'politicians', 'congressmen', 'justices', 'judges', 'blackmail', 'necessary', 'generally', 'had', 'way', 'one', 'major', 'failures', 'was', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'could', 'not', 'blackmail', 'refusing', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize', 'film', 'times', 'very', 'verge', 'being', 'embarrassing', 'only', 'dead', 'figures', 'dealing', 'rumors', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'John', 'Fitzgerald', 'Kennedy', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'few', 'others', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'information', 'not', 'frankly', 'false.But', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'patriot', 'patriotic', 'side', 'character', 'insistence', 'weight', 'point', 'reaching', 'bigotry', 'times', 'example', 'subject', 'racism', 'built', 'FBI', 'fight', 'anarchist', 'communist', 'movement', '20s', '30s', 'gangsters', '20s', 'Prohibition', 'Germans', '30s', 'too', 'specifying', 'political', 'innuendo', 'national', 'reference', '1934', 'Americans', 'questioned', 'FBI', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'German', 'accent', 'nuance', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'matter', 'raw', 'uncooked', 'all.But', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'elements', 'capture', 'real', 'personal', 'intimate', 'dimension', 'character', 'here', 'not', 'using', 'innuendo', 'allusions', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'relation', 'direct', 'deputy', 'seen', 'sentimental', 'relation', 'side', 'deputy', 'emotional', 'relation', 'side', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'tremendous', 'condemnation', 'gay', 'orientation', 'mother', 'creates', 'tremendous', 'struggle', 'due', 'attachment', 'mother', 'truth', 'will', 'come', 'very', 'end', 'friendly', 'even', 'paternal', 'kiss', 'deputy', 'night', 'dying', 'will', 'explain', 'how', 'recruited', 'needed', 'someone', 'knew', 'young', 'man', 'needed', 'strong', 'paternal', 'figure', 'accepted', 'be.Of', 'course', 'revelation', 'love', 'young', 'man', 'boss', 'dramatized', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'maybe', 'even', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'intimate', 'private', 'life', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'reveal', 'anything', 'public', 'far', 'done', 'such', 'delicacy', 'tenderness', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'film', 'having', 'compensated', 'absence', 'father', 'figure', 'presence', 'strong', 'authoritarian', 'mother', 'figure', 'side', 'playing', 'father', 'figure', 'direct', 'deputy', 'who', 'needed', 'father', 'figure', 'compensated', 'lack', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'became', 'satisfaction', 'need', 'deputy', 'So', 'much', 'alike', 'yet', 'so', 'different.That', 'personal', 'touch', 'film', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'fascinating', 'something', 'may', 'happen', 'anyone', 'love', 'only', 'thing', 'life', 'stronger', 'even', 'hatred', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'climbing', 'stairs', 'bedroom', 'very', 'last', 'time', 'life.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
1518108,AQ01Q3070LT29,B006OFN0BQ,James McDonald,"[3, 6]","Rated ""R"". Running Time: 2 hours, 16 min.The adult life of J. Edgar Hoover is dramatized in this movie as we see him as the Appointed Director of the Bureau of Investigation. The movie jumps around through his life from 1919 to 1972. In 1921, he became the Deputy head of the Bureau of Investigation.  He had no wife, no girlfriend, practically no social life, and so, the Attorney General promoted him to Appointed Director in 1924.  J. Edgar became obsessed with wanting to solve crimes, including the disappearance of the Charles Lindbergh baby case. He believed that ""information was power"" and used wire-tapping. The organization he created was the introduction of fingerprint files, crime labs and agents. He also kept personal and confidential files on several people and anyone that was after him, he wanted them investigated and a file started on them. He wanted agents to photograph them.J. Edgar kept his personal life very private. This movie depicts his speculated personal life as having a relationship with Clyde Tolson, his FBI Associate Director for nearly 40 years. Whatever went on behind closed doors of their homes will never be known, however in the end, Hoover left his entire estate to Tolson.Leonardo Dicaprio as ""J. Edgar Hoover"", Gunner Wright as ""Dwight Eisenhower"", David A. Cooper as ""Franklin Roosevelt"", Jeffrey Donovan as ""Robert Kennedy"", Josh Lucas as ""Charles Lindbergh"", Emily Alynlind as ""Shirley Temple"", Jamie LaBarber as ""Ginger Rogers"", Christopher Shyer as ""Richard Nixon"".Also in the cast: Naomi Watts, Judi Dench, Ken Howard.Option of Language: English, French.Option of Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.I did not care for the color processing of this movie. My television made it look awful.Note: J. Edgar Hoover served under eight Presidents of the United States from 1924-1972, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover (no relation), Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon.  He had power that no other FBI head will ever have.He probably would have loved the Internet which didn't gain speed until 1995, 100 years after his birth.Other movies:The Private Files Of J.

Edgar Hoover"" gave me a better idea of why Harry Callahan emerged during the recent Repulican National Convention, and why he did the whole bit with an empty chair.  Clint Eastwood sees a sort of purity in monsters that is not in fact present.For anyone who watched this movie without knowing a whole lot about just who J. Edgar Hoover was should, before crying too many tears for him, check outOfficial and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar HooverandMasters of Deceit.  Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent, and underrated, I think, of portraying Hoover's vulnerabilities (closet homosexual, an incestuous overdependent), the list could go on and on, but at no point does Eastwood reveal that behind this man of ""high standards"" and ""excellence"" was also a murderer.  The man who may have found some human understanding in Clyde Tolson, his second hand man (played by Armie Hammer with a touch too much of soft soap) also invented one of the most vicious, racist, and destructive programs ever to emerge from the U.S. Government: Cointelpro.  He had Fred Hampton, a Black Panther in his early twenties, murdered like a dog in his sleep.  He wanted to assassinate Martin Luther King with a passion, but there's no evidence that he had enough power to do it at that particular point in history.What we see on the screen is a young, ambitious, slightly neurotic young man who wants to make his mark on the world and who is absolutely obsessed with control.  We see an old man who was still living in the Cold War.  We see his ""accomplishments"", if you want to call them that: the creation of the FBI, fingerprinting, etc etc.  Was Eastwood also secretly sad that Hoover never had a chance to get involved in racial profiling?The performances from Naomi Watts and Judi Dench are phenomenal.  I didn't see any problem with the makeup, as some other viewers had.  I had a big problem, though, with having to look through the eyes of Clint Eastwood regarding this particular monster.  Even his destruction of Emma Goldman's lifeAnarchism and Other Essays,Living My Lifeis given a sympathetic treatment.Some parts are funny because you get to watch Hoover jump up and down in front of the mirror whining about how he can't dance with women.  The amusement factor only lasts so long, though, and I question where the heart of old Clint is these days.If Hoover had been raised in Nazi Germany, he would have been Rudolph Hess if not the man with the small mustache.

It's hard not to respect his dedication and singular focus which made his FBI into a national institution, and it's hard not to feel sorry for this man couldn't love (because of a strong-willed mother who refused to accept his sexual orientation) and thus couldn't be loved.

By keeping secret files on the powerful men, including the presidents, who funded the organization, he was able to remain the director until his death in 1972.Leonardo DiCaprio expertly portrays the man in J. Edgar, a film directed by Clint Eastwood.The film largely covers the period from Palmer Raids, through the solving of the  Lindbergh kidnapping. It also ventures into the rumors that John Edgar was gay, and in a long term relationship with Clyde Tolson, an associate director of the FBI.He also, apparently, had a flair for cross-dressing most likely brought on by his over bearing mother, Anne Marie (Judi Dench - M from the later James Bond films). When J.Edgar runs out of a nightclub because a woman asks him to dance - he's met by an outraged mother. She tells him she would rather have a dead son than a ""daffodil"" for a son.However, Hoover was paramount in the discovery of modern crime-fighting techniques like marking money given to the kidnappers, handwriting analysis and fingerprinting.He was possessed by communism, seeing conspiracy around every corner. He also had a tendency to take credit for bringing down big name gangsters, with the outlandish tales showing up in comic books.J.

1518117,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B006OFN0BQ,jjceo,"[2, 2]","A young J. Edgar (Leonardo Dicaprio) works in the Department of Justice.  He is an intelligent young man who excels at organizing data and seeing into what needs to be done to gather data to track radicals, communists and criminals.  Law enforcement at that time was archaic at best and databases on people did not exist or if they did they were only on a local basis.One evening the Attorney General of the US, several Senators, Federal Judges and prominent politicians' homes were bombed in 8 different locations at the same time.  J. Edgar is at the scene of his boss's home bombing shortly after it occurs collecting evidence. It leads to the arrest of communist radicals trying to subvert the American government.J. Edgar worked on a project to organize the library in Washington DC and he wanted to create the same type of data gathering and logging as he had helped use to set up the library.  He was among the first to push for fingerprinting and tracking of radicals and criminals.  The federal law enforcement agency at that time was weak and considered a joke.  They were not allowed to issue warrants, carry guns, arrest anyone or deport anyone.  At a very young age J. Edgar was appointed to be the head of the Bureau of Investigations and he basically set up the FBI and its investigative arms.  He believed in scientific investigative data and set up the famous FBI labs.He got what he wanted partially because he has gathered data files on presidents, congressmen, politicians and famous people.  He uses the dirt he has gathered to coerce those people to pass laws or to finance whatever he deems is necessary to move the FBI to his agenda...This is a very good storyline and follows some of the facts of history fairly well.  It is a tale of a driven paranoid man who trusts no one.  Most successful people are paranoid and he is no different.  He has his private secrets that finally begin to come out but everyone in power is terrified of his secret files.  I found it difficult to understand how the issues of J. Edgar's possible homosexual behavior became such a major part of this film. Unproven allegations seem to fit into Hollywood's eagerness to include such items into this film.  They wouldn't have had the courage to do this movie when he was alive!This movie is well acted by the entire cast.  I do think that one thing that hurt this movie's rating is that all of the actors are young and they wind up portraying the actual characters even up into their old age.  The old age special makeup is a bit overdone and you can't hardly help yourself but think that this is really a 30 year old person playing someone in their 60s and 70s.Despite that fact my wife and I enjoyed the movie and the acting.  The storyline is good but a bit dark in nature as J. Edgar was a cynical and paranoid man but that is part of what made him ideal for this job in America's troubled times.

1518118,A6KNR46BDWOJU,B006OFN0BQ,JJ,"[4, 5]","This is why Leonardo DiCaprio is probably the finest actor in the last decade, his acting has become a level of perfection that few ever achieve.The life of J Edgar Hoover portrayed by by DiCaprio is magnificent, he is perfectly suited for this role as he was in the Aviator portraying the unbalanced Howard Hughes. I've seen him grow from Whats Eating Gilbert Grape to the basketball diaries, then to roles such as Marvins room into epics such as the Titanic and titles like Gangs of New york and shutter Island. He never ceases to amaze me in every single performance including this absolutely magnificent role of one of Americas most controversial figures. If anyone but DiCaprio was cast for this I really don't know how I would feel about the film but I will say that it was an intriguing movie that opened my eyes to a man I knew little about.First I'm going to point out that this is a film on the life of a man shrouded with conspiracy and deceit. This film is not an exciting thrill ride but rather an in depth look at a dangerous man with secrets enough to secure a lifetime in an office he built. DiCaprio portrays Hoover as he did Hughes, with a complete immersion in the role itself. In short he makes this movie magnificent. I don't know how he does it but if it was anyone but DiCaprio I may have hated the film but I really don't know because I loved all the cloak and dagger political intrigue hoover seemed to be a master at. I've never seen a film put together like this which keeps my belief that both DiCaprio and Eastwood are masters at their craftsI have read the reviews and I really had to make the choice. Do I ignore a film with this duo? or Do I take the plunge as I did Aviator, Shutter Island, and Inception? I take the plunge and it pays off big, I will add this to my collection. This is a very complicated film to review because so many people are rating it horribly but you have to understand that it is a political cloak and dagger movie. I LOVE cloak and dagger movies and I have always been intrigued in how the F.B.I came to be and how it exercised so much influence. Now I have my answer, It was J Edgar Hoover and he was the keeper of some of the darkest secrets in Americas history..Go into this one expecting it to be a slow grind, a grind of character building coupled with some very sinister twists and turns. This man could walk into the office of some of the most powerful men in our governments history and exercise complete control of events in his favor. It was so interesting that I really didn't mind that it was a slow grind but If you need constant action and cannot sit through a slow movie then you should avoid this movie like the plague. I've seen all of DiCaprio's and Eastwood's works both on and behind the camera. I will tell you it is nothing short of a great movie experience, especially if you ever wanted to know the true inner workings of the F.B.I 's gritty past from humble beginnings to complete power and control. All in the span of hoovers reign of an unprecedented 48 years causing them to limit the term of service to ten years unless higher authority approves it. This should tell you that you are in for some real incite into this mans life and I have really learned much from this film. I will confess that I didn't know much but this has given me incite to expand my knowledge base on the life of HooverThe way the film is built is also very well done. Many people are saying that DiCaprio is ill fit to play this role as a young man but the thing is it is a flashback story set in the form of hoover explaining his life thus jumping from present to past. That being said He was perfect for the role as he played a young man as much as he did an elderly man. DiCaprio excels at these roles as he is able to transition perfectly into a very paranoid ocd type character. He played an elderly man quite well I should add and this film has shown me just the depth that DiCaprio can go in his versatility as an actor. His performance is nothing short of amazing otherwise I wouldn't be able to even attempt a review on this film.If you are a DiCaprio fan then this is something that you should see and as a Clint Eastwood fan you should see this as well if only to see how far he can really go into his talent behind the camera. Be warned that I did say it was slow so if you hate political intrigue and cannot stand slow character and story development then you should stay away from this title as you will probably be very disappointed (Hence the really bad reviews). If you have an open mind and a depth to your movie interests then I suggest at least renting it before completely dismissing it per the majority of the reviews.Well done, as good as it gets for both respected starsThanks for reading, I hope you enjoy the film",5,This is DiCaprio at his finest!

1518126,A24CASOMWGS87I,B006OFN0BQ,"Juan Camaney ""Book Hunter""","[5, 7]","First, I must start by saying that I'm not an uncoditional fan of either Clint Eastwood or Leonardo DiCaprio. I find many Eastwood films excessively solemn and on the service of somewhat melodramatic material (like the overrated Mystic River). As for DiCaprio, although his seriousness and commitment to acting has never seemed in doubt, he has seemed somewhat lightweight or miscast in many of his role.But this time, and despite being ignored by the Academy, Eastwood and DiCaprio, aided by a superb script by Dustin Lance Black, have stricken gold. DiCaprio has probably never had a role as demanding as this and Eastwood brings out the best in him.And the material perfectly suits Eastwood autumnal, melancholic tone this time, as we are talking about an American Epic, and the history of one of the most powerful men in the history of the United States. One of the most rewarding aspects of Eastwood's history films (as with Flags of Our Fathers), is that the director makes you take a fresh point of view. At this point in history, Hoover is equated in most of our minds with power mad, cross dressing, closeted bad guy, and then the movie reminds you of the man's instrumental role in building the FBI; yes, his tactics were nasty and he always took all the credit, but he helped bring crimefighting to a whole new level. The movie does a good balancing act of showing Hoover the Brilliant Man and Hoover the monster, if maybe at the end the portrayal might feel a little too sympathetic or apologetic. This would be more directed at Hoover the person, than at Hoover the politician, who is shown blackmailing several presidents and wiretapping Martin Luther King.When it comes to his personal life, the movie stirred quite a bit of controversy, as some people felt that the fact that Hoover was most likely a closeted homosexual could have been show more forcefully, and that it was just suggested; in fact the movie seemed to me quite clear on the subject.DiCaprio immerses completely in the role, and we finally can forget Leo the pretty boy, and watch the actor: awkard around women, smitten by a handsome new colleague, ferocious and bombastic speaking in public, shameless in playing hardball with people like RFK. It is an amazing performance and probably the best by an American actor in 2011.

The number of new things I learned surprised me, and I really enjoyed the movie as a result.  I am sure that a real J.

They could have easily made this into a gossipy feeling movie, and they nimbly avoided that pitfall.I thought the acting was good, particularly DiCaprio.  While I have always been a DiCaprio fan, I think this has to be one of the finest examples of his work.  You could easily forget it was him beneath all the makeup.

I feel he understood the character well, and I doubt anyone could have done a better job with the role.Overall, I think the movie captures all sides of J. Edgar as he really was.

1518144,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B006OFN0BQ,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[4, 4]","Throughout an illustrious directing career Clint Eastwood has delivered outstanding movies such as Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby, for which he has won five Academy Awards, for best Picture, Best Director, and including the Irving Thalberg Life Achievement Award. My personal favorite of all his directed movies is Gran Torino.The actors who have worked with him have been blessed with Oscar: Gene Hackman for Unforgiven, Tim Robbins and Sean Penn for Mystic River, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank for Million Dollar Baby.When I heard Clint Eastwood was doing a movie about Hoover, I admit I was somewhat excited, although it would be a challenging movie to do.I wondered would it deal with the relationship with the Kennedys, conspiracy theories, Hoover's alleged homosexuality, and alleged crossdressing, if it would deal with the entire career, if it would dare to show him in all his unpleasantness and darkness.If Hoover were alive today, I think he would be horrified at this movie. Undoubtedly, no such movie could have been made while he was alive.J Edgar deals with the entire span of J Edgar's career and makes brave choices in portraying the relationship between he and his No 2, Colson. The screenplay was written by same person who wrote the screen play for Milk.Leonardo DiCaprio making his first movie apart from Martin Scorsese in 12 years does an outstanding job in the title role, as does Arnie Hammer in the role of Colson. Naomi Watts plays Hoover's long time secretary to whom he proposes early in the movie, and Judi Dench plays his domineering and controlling mother.We see certain conflicts, and Hoover's use of Machivellian tactics in pursuing communists, upholding his position as head of the FBI through investigating the high ranking politicians who proved a threat. Whatever one thinks about Hoover one has to acknowledge some brilliance particuarly in organising, popularising the use of fingerprinting evidence, organising a national criminal database leveraging the Lindbergh tragedy to increase his own powers, and creating a highly respected investigative organisation.It was interesting to see how he was able to use propaganda to boost the reputation of the FBI. At one time the gangsters seemed to hold sway in the public consciousness as heroes, until the FBI's machine gun toting G men replaced them. We also see Hoover's vanity and narcissism in full display, and his racism particularly towards Martin Luther King.The Hoover story unfolds with Hover dictating his memoirs to a succession of agents. Why would he not use his secretary for this? It seems he wishes to tell his story to these people for vanity, and to promote himself as a legendary icon.In reality, Hoover was a temple of secrets, and probably the least likely person you could imagine would write his own memoirs. Although, he secretly tape recorded JFK, and MLK for exmaple, his relationship with Colson could possibly have ended his career if the true nature of the relationship became public. It's well known for example that Hoover did not allow women agents, nor did he hire African Americans. Yet, we have him dictating his memoirs at one point to an African American agent.One of the challenges with the story was the lack of a continuous protagonist, he mostly does battle with entities rather than individuals, such as communism and organised crime. By the 1960s apparently, he got soft on organised crime, while Bobby Kennedy got hard. Yet we have only two scenes in the movie with Bobby Kennedy.Another difficulty is the excessive use of makeup on several of the actors. With DiCaprio it's fine, but with Naomi Watts, and Arnie Hammer they wear bloodshot contact lenses which was over the top and unnecessary, and distracting. Old people do not necessarily have bloodshot eyes.I thought the performances by both DiCaprio and Hammer were deserving of Oscar recognition, though neither were nominated.While Clint Eastwood has probably brought me more enertainment than anyone as both an actor and director, I am not as staunch a supporter of this movie as the others in recent years such as Changeling, Gran Torino, and Invictus. Nevertheless I give it 4 stars because I think it was a very challenging movie to do well.I hope this was helpful.",4,Fidelity.  Bravery.

1518147,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B006OFN0BQ,Mark Turner,"[1, 4]","I was looking forward to seeing the movie J. EDGAR. I was never a fan of the man it was about, but with all the information brought out over the years about the secretive man who managed to create perhaps the most effective law enforcement organization ever I thought there should be a great story to be told here. There still is but this isn't the movie that does so.For those who don't know the name, J. Edgar Hoover was the creator of and the driving force behind the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for decades. Not only was he the man responsible for putting the bureau together, he ran it when America was under attack by subversives, during the depression when criminals seemed more famous than those tracking them and later on when the FBI took on the Mafia at the behest of Attorney General Robert Kennedy.The film takes us through the various stages of Hoover's life from his early start at working for the Attorney General when the first outcry of radical attacks came. Still living at home Hoover was heavily influenced by his mother (played here by Judi Dench). It was her desire to see her son reinvigorate the Hoover name once again in Washington and he eventually did so.We watch as Hoover moves back and forth through time as he narrates passages of his memoirs to a subordinate taking us to those times when events actually happened. Along with these memories we get a chance to see Hoover for who he was as well, especially the man who witnessed so many politicians attempt to use the bureau for political reasons that he established a series if private files he kept on any and all people in power to use against them should they stand in his way. Had that been the main force behind the story here it would have been much more interesting.Instead writer Dustin Lance Black and director Clint Eastwood seem more interested in the seedier side of Hoover's life. In doing so the story of the man behind the FBI becomes a love story more than anything else. And that love story revolves around the tabloid fed stories about Hoover being gay and involved with his trusted friend Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). There is little doubt according to some that they were involved but why make that the focus especially when stating in so many press releases that it wasn't?The story that develops here does come through in the idea that Hoover became obsessed with his ideas that Communists were attempting to subvert the country that he loved; that more than anything portrays him as the patriot that he was, a man who loved his country above all else. But rather than show that yes, there were subversives who attempted to overthrow this country that were caught, it appears there were more civil rights violations going on that deserved more coverage. Granted Hoover was wrong on many of these occasions, but to display one side without the other seems disingenuous.We never see scenes of Hoover and Tolson in locked embrace or in bed together but much is made of their affection for one another. There is one brief heated kiss but that's all. Perhaps that was a gesture towards the fact that what went on behind closed doors was only known for certain to Hoover and Tolson themselves. But the longing for one another takes up more than half of the screen time seen here and for me made the picture more boring than anything.Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job portraying Hoover throughout the various ages seen here. While some would credit the make up artists for much of that portrayal, more goes into it than that. How a man walks, how he talks, how he carries himself in various stages of life bring out the character being portrayed and DiCaprio displays that here.Hoover was an interesting man. His change from law defender to law breaker is interesting. His efforts to create the best crime fighting organization is interesting. His love life is not. I have yet to fathom the desire of Hollywood and their goal to dismantle each and every hero we have in our past. They seem determined to talk less about the accomplishments made by everyone from Thomas Jefferson to Hoover and more inclined to talk about the salacious details of their lives. Perhaps they've become influenced by the commercials that once ran for THE ENQUIRER that said ""Enquiring minds want to know"". I for one do not. I'm much more appreciative of movies that cover all bases and spend less time on dirt.",3,SOME SECRETS SHOULD STAY THAT WAY,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4402,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'J.', 'EDGAR', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'man', 'was', 'about', 'information', 'brought', 'out', 'years', 'secretive', 'man', 'who', 'managed', 'create', 'perhaps', 'most', 'effective', 'law', 'enforcement', 'organization', 'ever', 'thought', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'here', 'still', ""n't"", 'movie', 'so.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'was', 'creator', 'driving', 'force', 'Federal', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'FBI', 'decades', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'man', 'responsible', 'putting', 'bureau', 'together', 'ran', 'when', 'America', 'was', 'attack', 'subversives', 'depression', 'when', 'criminals', 'seemed', 'more', 'famous', 'tracking', 'later', 'when', 'FBI', 'took', 'Mafia', 'behest', 'Attorney', 'General', 'Robert', 'Kennedy.The', 'film', 'various', 'stages', 'Hoover', 'life', 'early', 'start', 'working', 'Attorney', 'General', 'when', 'first', 'outcry', 'radical', 'attacks', 'came', 'Still', 'living', 'home', 'Hoover', 'was', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'mother', 'played', 'here', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'was', 'desire', 'see', 'son', 'reinvigorate', 'Hoover', 'name', 'once', 'again', 'Washington', 'eventually', 'did', 'so.We', 'watch', 'Hoover', 'back', 'forth', 'through', 'time', 'passages', 'memoirs', 'subordinate', 'taking', 'times', 'when', 'events', 'actually', 'happened', 'memories', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Hoover', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'man', 'who', 'witnessed', 'so', 'many', 'politicians', 'attempt', 'use', 'bureau', 'political', 'reasons', 'established', 'series', 'private', 'files', 'kept', 'people', 'power', 'use', 'should', 'stand', 'way', 'Had', 'been', 'main', 'force', 'story', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting.Instead', 'writer', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'seem', 'more', 'interested', 'seedier', 'side', 'Hoover', 'life', 'doing', 'so', 'story', 'man', 'FBI', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'love', 'story', 'revolves', 'tabloid', 'fed', 'stories', 'Hoover', 'being', 'gay', 'involved', 'trusted', 'friend', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'little', 'doubt', 'according', 'were', 'involved', 'why', 'make', 'focus', 'especially', 'when', 'stating', 'so', 'many', 'press', 'releases', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'here', 'come', 'idea', 'Hoover', 'became', 'obsessed', 'ideas', 'Communists', 'were', 'attempting', 'subvert', 'country', 'loved', 'more', 'anything', 'patriot', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'country', 'else', 'rather', 'show', 'yes', 'were', 'subversives', 'who', 'attempted', 'overthrow', 'country', 'were', 'caught', 'were', 'more', 'civil', 'rights', 'violations', 'going', 'deserved', 'more', 'coverage', 'Granted', 'Hoover', 'was', 'wrong', 'many', 'occasions', 'display', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'disingenuous.We', 'never', 'see', 'scenes', 'Hoover', 'Tolson', 'locked', 'embrace', 'bed', 'together', 'much', 'made', 'affection', 'one', 'one', 'brief', 'heated', 'kiss', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'gesture', 'fact', 'what', 'went', 'closed', 'doors', 'was', 'only', 'known', 'certain', 'Hoover', 'Tolson', 'longing', 'one', 'up', 'more', 'half', 'screen', 'time', 'seen', 'here', 'made', 'picture', 'more', 'boring', 'anything.Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'Hoover', 'various', 'ages', 'seen', 'here', 'would', 'credit', 'make', 'up', 'artists', 'much', 'portrayal', 'more', 'How', 'man', 'walks', 'how', 'how', 'various', 'stages', 'life', 'bring', 'out', 'character', 'being', 'portrayed', 'DiCaprio', 'displays', 'here.Hoover', 'was', 'interesting', 'man', 'change', 'law', 'defender', 'law', 'breaker', 'interesting', 'efforts', 'create', 'best', 'crime', 'fighting', 'organization', 'interesting', 'love', 'life', 'not', 'have', 'yet', 'fathom', 'desire', 'Hollywood', 'goal', 'dismantle', 'hero', 'have', 'past', 'seem', 'determined', 'talk', 'less', 'accomplishments', 'made', 'everyone', 'Thomas', 'Jefferson', 'Hoover', 'more', 'inclined', 'talk', 'salacious', 'details', 'lives', 'Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'become', 'influenced', 'commercials', 'once', 'ran', 'THE', 'ENQUIRER', 'said', 'Enquiring', 'minds', 'want', 'know', 'one', 'do', 'not', ""'m"", 'much', 'more', 'appreciative', 'movies', 'cover', 'bases', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'dirt']",N/A

1518156,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B006OFN0BQ,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[3, 3]","A tale about J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) which takes the stance he was a repressed homosexual. Historians and people who knew Hoover vary in their opinions so you can believe what you wish but sometimes there seems to be an agenda involved rather than an attempt to seek out the truth. Hollywood wanted something controversial for a character that is probably unknown to the standard male moviegoers under 30 so I suspect that might be one of the reasons they went in this direction.But that said this is a good tale about the man which starts with him working in the Department of Justice when some anarchists were quite extreme and tried to kill off important politicians and government workers, including the boss of Hoover, Attorney General Alexander Mitchell. Yes, it's true that an anarchist by the name Luigi Galleani tried to mail a bomb to him that would detonate upon being opened. Fortunately for Mitchell the bomb was discovered and defused. Anyway, I felt that setting down this disturbing incident gave an interesting perspective as to why Hoover was so mistrusting of any groups that deviated from the norm. Some anarchists in those days were basically like the terrorists today and the Palmer Raids (basically the deportation of said anarchists and other suspicious left wing types) may have very well been justified back in that period. Just do a bit of Wiki research on anarchists to see all the people they tried to kill in America.Said incident also explains in his later years why he was unwilling to see Martin Luther King as somebody peacefully trying to change the world better socially but it could also be that outright racism towards African Americans was perfectly acceptable. That said, the movie doesn't have issue with showing his flaws in violating the privacy of others (not so much of a legal right back then as it is today) and collecting dirt on Presidents and other powerful people so as to maintain control and his job position. The outcome of the Lindbergh kidnapping was accurate and back then it was named ""The Crime of the Century"". Hoover is shown to dramatize or outright lie about the truth if it made him look good (evidence for this is unknown to me per some online research). Overall, I would say this movie did a commendable job in showing the good and bad of J.

Leonard DiCaprio was especially impressive, and so was Armie Hammer (the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network"") as his longtime companion. Their scenes were heartwrenching. The American historical aspects of the movie were fascinating, but confusing. I admit I knew almost nothing about Hoover or the FBI before the movie. After watching it, I'm not sure if I learned anything, since I don't know how much of it is true or not, a la an Oliver Stone movie. I am interested in the subject now, and will read more about the man who started the FBI.That said, I'm surprised Clint Eastwood let the dark lighting get through the final cut. Was the darkness supposed to be ""arty""? Symbolic of how ""shady"" these times were, you were never sure of what you were seeing, truth or half truth, etc.? Whatever, it was annoying. At times I literally could not see enough of each face to have identified the actor moments later in a lineup.

1518164,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,B006OFN0BQ,Muzzlehatch,"[1, 1]","Anybody who knows me at all probably knows that I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan - though I have never been and all-worshiping one. Clint's stumbled plenty of times in his long career, and he's quite capable of turning out a film that leaves me cold (see both ""Changeling"" and ""Trouble With the Curve"" among recent films that didn't do it for me). And though the story on this one was certainly interesting, I can't say I've been super-impressed with Leonardo DiCaprio up to this point. The reviews in general weren't so great, but many of the comments from reviewers and friends I trust have been better. And then again, I loved ""Hereafter"", which also got mixed responses. So...cautious optimism going in, at best.So I'm pleased to report that ""J. Edgar"", though it certainly isn't perfect and has a few significant problems, succeeded far beyond my expectations. If DiCaprio never gives another great performance in his career, he should be remembered for his thoughtful, enormously emotional and painful portrait of this rigid, more-tightly-wound-than-should-be-possible, permanently adolescent autocrat. The Hoover created by the actor, director, and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black is unquestionably a closeted gay (or bisexual) man, let's get that out of the way first; but he is the product of a conservative God-fearing mother, a society in which there's only one acceptable kind of sexuality and behavior, and he's ambitious and needs to be in power and control of everything, including himself. The film manages one of the most difficult feats imaginable - creating a thoroughly unpleasant and largely amoral character, and then proceeding to make him likable and sympathetic - something which will I'm sure be a turn-off for many viewers who either want a straight-arrow Hoover or a simple villain. This isn't anything like either, but rather a small, hypocritical and fearful man who can only find love in his work and an apparently sexless companionship with his closest lieutenant; someone who acts out of the pettiest of spites and ruins lives - because as a hollow shell of power surrounding a void of fear and self-doubt it's the only thing he can do to make a life for himself. Controlling and spying on others becomes his way to live the life he can't let himself have, so it's no wonder that spying on sex lives and an obsession with race (the rumors of Hoover's partially African origins are explored only slightly and rather subtly here) become defining characteristics.The film proceeds mostly in the form of flashbacks, as an aged Hoover recounts his triumphs to a series of stenographers in the 1960s, taking credit for much of the work on the Lindbergh kidnapping case, and the victories against gangsters in the 1930s. We see early on how a 24-year-old Hoover becomes obsessed with finding new techniques to defeat crime, using fingerprinting and forensics before they became de rigeur, and starting his lifelong crusade against Communism at the same time. One idea the film explores over and over is that the man always wanted to simplify things - always believed in easy answers, in a black and white yes/no world, and this of course becomes a great irony when we look at his complex, deceit-filled private life; and he also, from the first, was a man willing to take credit for others' ideas. Even when it came to dress, Hoover the fashion-plate got his sense of style from his assistant/companion Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer, just as good as DiCaprio), and when he admires the fireplace in Attorney General Robert Kennedy's office, it's no surprise that we later see an identical model installed in his own.Much of the film is built on rhyming scenes like the Kennedy one, sometimes several minutes or an hour or more apart, sometimes built as abrupt transitions, such as an elevator ride taken by the elderly Hoover and Tolson that ends with the 30-year-younger pair getting off the same elevator. Far from being just cinematic flash (not really something Eastwood is known for), these serve to emphasize the lifelong metastasis of the man - 48 years in the same job, living with his mother until her death, keeping the same office for virtually his whole career. 48 years, and though the powerful man is old and withered, he is at the end in almost the same place he began, frozen by his own fears and secrets and emptiness. Three times we see him look out his window, past the Capital, down Pennsylvania Avenue, and we hear cheers - but they are not for him. These scenes reminded me of the way in which Sergio Leone told ""Once Upon a Time in America"", and in fact there's a moment early on in ""J. Edgar"" where Eastwood's music seems to quote Morricone's score for that film, just for a second. It could be a coincidence, but whether it is or not, both films at their hearts are films of regret and unrequited love over decades of a lifetime, and both are, at the end, almost unbearably sad.I do have some issues with the film; though they aren't major for me I suspect both might be bigger problems for others. One is the cinematography; it's by Eastwood's regular DP Tom Stern, and it's mostly in that muted washed out look that we also saw in ""Million Dollar Baby"" (where I thought it was pretty appropriate) and even moreso in ""Letters From Iwo Jima"". I suppose in a way it reflects the bleak, colorless world that Hoover lived in, emotionally, but it often just looked dull to me. I wondered at first if it was the poor projection when I saw it theatrically, but having seen the film now again on DVD, it remains an issue for me. The second area is the period of young Hoover's life; it would I think help strengthen the story, the character, if there was a little more exploration here; then again, one gets the sense that Hoover had little nostalgia beyond his powerful love for his mother (Judi Dench), and little interest in or patience for children (except when they could help his image, as a brief photo-op with Shirley Temple attests). His life was the FBI, and so perhaps it is appropriate that that's what we see of it, and even Tolson, and Hoover's career-long faithful secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts - fine, though the role isn't as much as it perhaps could be) are often just sprockets in that mechanism.A lot of people obviously are disliking this; it's a very divisive film for both those who hate Hoover the autocrat (too sympathetic) and those who admire him but don't want to deal with his (possible) sexuality.  And there are always complaints about Eastwood's un-flashy style, and about DiCaprio.  And of course, being a film about real history, any liberties taken will be too many for a lot of folks. Too bad I say. What the filmmakers have crafted here is both a sad portrait of a fairly pathetic - if very powerful - man, and one of cinema's great stories of unrequited, repressed love.  Whether it is ""real"" or not seems beside the point to me; the emotional power of the film resides in what is on the screen, not on what we think we know about the real people who we're seeing in artistic reflection and imagination.",5,A masterpiece of emotional repression,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,7082,"['Anybody', 'who', 'probably', ""'m"", 'big', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'fan', 'have',

EDGAR in Clint Eastwood's film of that name, nor that the other supporting performances are equally well-played by a fine cast. I never found the age make-up and prosthetics used to give DiCaprio a remarkable resemblance to the older Hoover a distraction, as others have claimed. His brisk, authoritative manner barking orders while riddled with a personality that covered a whole range of eccentricities, is nothing short of brilliant. All of the main facets of Hoover's life while in office stick pretty much to the truth in the script.But the film's basic flaw is that there's almost too much to tell about Hoover and not enough time to give any of the material more than a surface look. And the fact that the story is going back and forth in time holds up the momentum when it comes to the segments dealing with the Lindbergh kidnapping. What should have reached the peak of intensity in the story is muffled by the fact that the script spaces the event amid a period of other happenings, all of which take away a strong enough focus on ""the trial of the Century.""Eastwood's direction of the players is so strong that this flaw doesn't really matter in the end. He gets across a full illumination of the kind of man Hoover was, despite all the complexities stemming from his attachment to a dominating mother (Judi Dench) and made even more apparent by his singular attachment to his fellow co-worker at the FBI (Armie Hammer) as Clyde Tolson. Scenes between DiCaprio and Hammer reach a peak moment in their physical struggle as Hammer reacts violently to Hoover's admission of getting ""serious"" with Dorothy Lamour.Many personalities of the '30s and '40s are impersonated from time to time, the least convincing being the child actress chosen to represent Shirley Temple, who adored the F.B.I. Aside from blonde ringlets, she in no way resembles that child star in looks, speech or manner. Much closer are Ginger Rogers and Anita Colby. Nixon is played by an actor considerably more handsome than the original and Josh Lucas only makes an acceptable Charles Lindbergh.But whatever casting flaws there are, all of the main supporting roles are very capably entrusted to the right people. Naomi Watts does a fine job as Helen Gandy and Judi Dench is likewise admirable as Annie Hoover. In the end, though, it's a good film that might have been great with a tighter script.And certainly, DiCaprio can look forward to an Oscar nomination for Best Actor of 2011.

1518168,A2198O25QYUPXE,B006OFN0BQ,Nicholas R.W. Henning,"[5, 10]","""J. Edgar"" is a biographical drama film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Hoover.There is no doubt that there are aspects of Hoover's life and career that are highly concerning and controversial. However, this film focuses too heavily on the negative facets, and the lack of balance in this movie damages its credibility.I don't dispute that Hoover was at times unethical and egotistical but who really knew him? His mother, Clyde Tolson, and Helen Gandy were the qualified experts of Hoover, yet it doesn't appear that their superior knowledge of his demeanour, idiosyncrasies, life and career philosophy have been captured sufficiently for the purpose of accurately representing Hoover. All of these people are now deceased and without their input any interpretation of Hoover can only be considered as partially complete.Hoover does deserve some credit for the centralisation of laws and regulations by pushing for them to be federally binding, and it certainly makes sense for example that the deaths of federal officials fall within the FBI's jurisdiction, which was one of Hoover's later contributions. In the film Hoover was given some credit for the Federal Kidnapping Act following the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr. He is also given credit for embracing enhanced methodologies for crime scene investigation.The quality of acting is highly commendable and does to some extent offset what is an underrepresented narrative.Nicholas R.W.

There's more internal conflict than drama.  DeCaprio does a superb job portraying the former F.B.I. founder.Hoover has been credited as one of the founders of forensic science and for that matter stealing the credit for many findings from his own agents. Through his clever manipulation of people and the press; he got the results that benefited his image in history.I can't say it was a well paced movie. It was very slow in some instances. It's one of those movies you can watch a few times to understand the subtle motivations of the characters. Like J. Edgar Hoover, the movie is a very complex back and forth journey through different periods in his life. We see that his mother was very power hungry. She indoctrinated her son into believing he would be a great leader someday.  Hoover came from a very well to do background.  It didn't stop him from becoming a ruthless leader of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Eastwood shows us the good, bad and the very ugly of a man that changed the face of America.We get to see how he kept files and destroyed them throughout his fifty years.  Presidents feared him and wanted to see him gone.  It wasn't until the Nixon administration that he passed away while still serving in office. There was a very pivotal and poignant  scene where he orders his secretary to destroy all of his files.  You can see the loyalty he inspired with his secretary of over fifty years.

Edgar Hoover.Eastwood delivers a dark brooding, and rather objective look at one of the most controversial and polarizing figures in America. While the story itself may not be overly compelling, it does offer explanations behind some of the motivations that made up the man, John Edgar Hoover. The cinematography was a crucial element in creating and maintaining throughout a sense of secrecy, brooding, alienation, as well as distance.  The chronology is disparate and effective:  at times we see Hoover dictating his memoirs to an array of journalists and then we are taken back to the time in question, all the while framed in this overcast mood that fits the film and its subject matter perfectly.  As a matter of fact, the manner in which this was filmed constitutes, to me, the biggest indication of Eastwood's opinion one way or the other - Hoover was a dark man with some even darker secrets.J.Edgar's homosexuality as well as his proclivity for cross-dressing are only suggested and are handled with the utmost sensitivity.  There is one scene which strongly implies his helplessness with his desires to cross-dress that was simply quite touching.  And the relationship between Hoover and Tolson was beautifully written.  No, I did not come away feeling empathy/sympathy for Hoover at all; neither were any of my perceptions surrounding him challenged in the least.  I did leave the film however with surely a more heightened sense of his humanity.This could NOT have been accomplished however, were it not for the positively riveting performance by Di Caprio.  This guy can just ACT, okay? The other supporting players were equally excellent, most notably, Judi Dench who played his overbearing mother, Naomi Watts as his faithful secretary, Helen Gandy, and Armie Hammer, as Hoover's lifelong companion, Clyde Tolson.  Some of the movie's most compelling scenes involved these three and all three gave powerhouse supporting performances to match Di Caprio.I highly recommend as yet another excellent outing from a very good director.",5,Another Gem From Eastwood!!!,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2157,"['are', 'expecting', 'ridicule', 'vilification', 'even', 'justification', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'movie', 'watch', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover.Eastwood', 'dark', 'brooding', 'rather', 'objective', 'look', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'polarizing', 'figures', 'America', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'overly', 'compelling', 'offer', 'explanations', 'motivations', 'made', 'up', 'man', 'John', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'cinematography', 'was', 'crucial', 'element', 'creating', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'secrecy', 'brooding', 'alienation', 'as', 'well', 'distance', 'chronology', 'disparate', 'effective', 'times', 'see', 'Hoover', 'dictating', 'memoirs', 'array', 'journalists', 'then', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'time', 'question', 'while', 'framed', 'overcast', 'mood', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'perfectly', 'matter', 'fact', 'manner', 'was', 'filmed', 'constitutes', 'biggest', 'indication', 'Eastwood', 'opinion', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'Hoover', 'was', 'dark', 'man', 'even', 'darker', 'secrets.J.Edgar', 'homosexuality', 'as', 'well', 'proclivity', 'cross-dressing', 'are', 'only', 'suggested', 'are', 'handled', 'utmost', 'sensitivity', 'one', 'scene', 'strongly', 'helplessness', 'desires', 'cross-dress', 'was', 'simply', 'quite', 'touching', 'relationship', 'Hoover', 'Tolson', 'was', 'beautifully', 'written', 'No', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'empathy/sympathy', 'Hoover', 'were', 'perceptions', 'surrounding', 'challenged', 'least', 'did', 'leave', 'film', 'however', 'surely', 'more', 'heightened', 'sense', 'humanity.This', 'could', 'NOT', 'have', 'been', 'accomplished', 'however', 'were', 'not', 'positively', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'guy', 'can', 'just', 'ACT', 'okay', 'other', 'supporting', 'players', 'were', 'equally', 'excellent', 'most', 'notably', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'played', 'overbearing', 'mother', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'faithful', 'secretary', 'Helen', 'Gandy', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'Hoover', 'lifelong', 'companion', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'movie', 'most', 'compelling', 'scenes', 'involved', 'three', 'three', 'gave', 'powerhouse', 'supporting', 'performances', 'match', 'Di', 'Caprio.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'yet', 'excellent', 'outing', 'very', 'good', 'director']",N/A

I don't care what people think about Inception, he doesn't have the chops to play serious roles!!!To the elite few that watch the history channel(H2), J.

So someone like JFK couldn't fire him because as we know he loved women. I can't imagined what would've happened to Clinton if this idiot was alive in the 1990s.

1518180,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B006OFN0BQ,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[181, 202]","A scene at a clothing store in which John Edgar Hoover is told he has bad credit finds him telling them that they are incorrect, they must be speaking of another John Hoover. They ask if he is indeed John Hoover and he says yes but adds that he signs his name different ways, not usually just plainly as John Hoover but with his middle name or E initial included (his mother did always call him Edgar). The shop owner then tells Hoover to open up a new account and sign it with one name and to go by that name. John takes the application form and writes J. Edgar Hoover.To me this scene is symbollic of the larger film. J. Edgar Hoover is a film about a man who, like many of us, had many sides and aspects that composed who he was. He was greatly conflicted about which side he should portray publicly and stumbled rather awkwardly in his younger years, illustrated wonderfully in the film, until finally deciding that J. Edgar Hoover was who he was going to be. That was the side he was going to live publicly and the person he was going to be, right or wrong, with full conviction. The rest of the film shows us the consequent problems, struggles and complications that follow from this choice.I was concerned that this film wouldn't live up to my expectations, others have been rating it rather ordinary and others negatively, few seem really excited about it after having viewed it. In a way I can see where they are coming from. It is a long film with dark moody colors, almost as if Eastwood wanted it to be black and white, and a lot of dialogue that moves quite fast without much regard for helping the audience along or spelling things out. All that aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and while it didn't blow my mind or leave me with any great revelations about my own life it was a great movie experience and had me thinking and entertained the entire time I was watching it.I'm not sure where all the more negative or critical reviews are coming from, perhaps people have high standards from Eastwood and expected something groundbreaking, perhaps they just expected something different, but after all the negative or ho-hum opinions I had heard about this film I was pleasantly surprised and recommend it for fans of drama or biopics. I especially recommend it for those like myself who have been waiting for a more compelling film this movie-going season.Perhaps I enjoyed it more because I have seen a truly terrible line of recent films in cinemas, Jack and Jill being the latest before seeing this (that movie was awful, so awful. I thought it would be bad but in an over the top funny way, it was just bad). So maybe my enjoyment was raised during this film because other recent films have left me underwhelmed and bored or wanting my money back. I haven't seen an excellently crafted film in theaters since The Help and haven't even thought one merited repeat viewings since the surprise that was 50/50. This film didn't knock me out but I will definitely watch it again and will likely even buy it on Blu-ray because I want it to be part of my collection and think it will become more engaging upon future viewings.People are complaining about the old age make up, it never bothered me once despite other reviewer comments making me more critical than usual. People say there are many impersonations of presidents and such that are distracting, the only one that felt as much to me was Richard Nixon's brief appearance towards the end because it was so over the top. People say it drags, but I was never wanting for it to hurry or speed along, I was always compelled with what was on screen. There are complaints that the broken narrative is confusing and jumps too much, it's fairly straightforward with only two timelines occuring. Hoover in his old age is dictating his past for a manuscript and both these timelines are otherwise chronological and move forward with one another. People say there is no real message or overriding theme to speak of, I think deeper digging and repeat viewings will find them more well constructed than others are giving credit right now. Most of all though, even if some find merit to these criticisms I don't find that any of them would keep the film from being enjoyable as a whole.This film may be getting less positive reviews because people thought it could have been so many things that it isn't. In the end I feel Eastwood and the writer picked a direction and identity for the film and much like J. Edgar they decided to move forward with full conviction. It is what it is and any negatives don't outweigh all the positives it brings in my opinion, but everyone will judge the film differently I suppose, much like everyone has different opinions on J. Edgar Hoover the man.It may also help me that I'm very interested in history and this time period. Also in how institutions such as the FBI got built up and came to be (the film does an excellent job at explaining how the bureau slowly found ways to gain power and independence). Anyways, give this film a chance, I give it five stars because I may not have LOVED the film but I did love the experience of watching it, if that makes sense.",5,Choose one name and go by

1518184,A1DPP8TXDCHCDN,B006OFN0BQ,"R. L. Huff ""An old reader""","[4, 6]","Clint Eastwood's gung-ho flag-wavery butts head-on against historical fact in  this one.  But before ripping it a new orifice I'll mention the film's better aspects.Leonardi DiCaprio made a valiant effort portraying a man who took pains to be humanly unknowable.  J. Edgar's homosexuality, as well as his other psycho-sexual hangups, were handled with dignity and pathos: no silly tutu tripping, as per Oliver Stone. These were doubtless key to the man's character as the All-American Javert.  And the attention to period detail was meticulous. This gave it my second star.The real problem is in Eastwood's presentation of Hoover's worldview as if it were a necessary - or even credible - response to the reality of his times.  Slice and dice it any way you try, but the real J. Edgar was a true fascist; a racist, power-mad opportunist and blackmailer, as ugly a character as anyone he railroaded to prison. Or possibly worse: what longterm damage did Emma Goldman or Alvin Karpis really do to the institutions of the American Republic?Hoover's publicity-seeking as ""Mr. G-Man"" is taken to task well enough.  But other inconvenient facts are dealt with as cavalierly as in his files.  The 1919 bombers were not ""Bolshevik-Communists,"" but Italian-American anarchists.  There was no rooftop sniper at Centralia: this was just an excuse for drunken veterans to march on a local IWW hall and lynch its occupants, murdering one in the city jail.  The steel strike of that same year was not led by ""the Communists,"" but by the United Steelworkers, with Hoover's Bureau as corporate strikebreaker. Eastwood delights in nasty little digs at two liberal icons, JFK and Eleanor Roosevelt, via unexamined tidbits of slander from Hoover's ""secret files.""  In these scenes you see his smear tactics in operation.  Yet the audience is left with this disinformation intact as ""proof"" of J. Edgar's skill at police sleuthing.  The Director's files contained so much nonsense as to be worthless.  Their only value lay in Hoover's authority to make them true because he said so, and ruin lives and reputations thereby.In the same disingenuous manner does the scriptwriter and director sidestep Hoover's role as the American Beria from 1938 on: first as ""smasher"" of ""fifth columnists,"" then as the cold war arm of HUAC.  We hear Hoover denigrate Joe McCarthy as an ""opportunist"" - talk about pots and kettles!  It wasn't the KGB who fed McCarthy and Cohn the tainted meat for their public cannibalism.  Hoover's own coddling of the Mafia complements his war on Rev. King and the SCLC.  But the civil rights movement was one elephant that couldn't be sidestepped, even by Clint Eastwood.  This final crusade against the public opinion that served him so well finally discredited Hoover and his Bureau of Inquisition.  Top it off with his moral blackmailing, while hiding his own ""inadequacies,"" and you have a dark portrait of the typical hypocrite-persecutor.Eastwood no doubt thinks he's offered an impartial portrait - judging by his remarks in the special feature interview - presenting the Director as a basically honest American patriot whose virtue became his vice.  Hoover in fact coined a new political type, as ""flaggot.""  He magnified, and outrightly invented, enemies to justify his ever-expanding powers, using his files as a cocked gun at the head of anyone who might threaten him.

I was especially interested in this film, about a quirky public figure who did much good and much damage.  I read a bio of JEH that traced his rise as a pioneering law enforcer of genius to his decline as an old-fashioned hack who had outlived not just his usefulness but his time.  It is absolutely true what they say about him, that he should have retired a hero in 1940, but instead he held onto power and abused it and the nation.  He was corrupted by the power that he held for far too long and became a political player whose methods can only be described as manipulative and even evil.That story is complex and difficult to tell because of the subtleties that must be addressed.  JEH was from a time so removed from ours it is hard to imagine, when anarchists and bolsheviks were a great ""threat"", homosexuality was not discussed, and the existence of organized crime was denied.  JEH has an impossibly strange accent and 19C mores, an anachronism waiting to happen.  To be honest, Di Caprio only partially carries this off in spite of being a first-rate talent - his accent is not believable and he ages unrealistically.I enjoyed this, but will not buy it as I won't want to watch it again.  It is a relatively weak film experience.  While not spectacular or of typical hollywood hyperbole, I did not get much of a sense of history or public purpose.  Eastwood refuses to sensationalize or speculate on JEH's sexuality and rightly so.

1518189,A1SBRISKS7PH7U,B006OFN0BQ,Rob,"[4, 5]","Eastwood's excellent film is a typical example of his preference for working within genre while at the same time creating refreshing variations on its basic themes. J Edgar comes on like a standard issue biopic as an elderly Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) dictates his memoirs to a succession of young agents about the founding of the FBI and its early triumphs under his leadership. But late in the game Eastwood and writer Dustin Lance Black spectacularly pull the rug out from under us by having Hoover's close friend and confidante Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) declare that everything we've seen thus far has been a pack of lies. The question then becomes why and it's here that the point of Eastwood's film becomes clear. This isn't actually a biopic at all, it's really a tale of unrequited love, of Edgar's unrequited love, and of what happens when that love is denied and has to find another outlet.I've never been a fan of DiCaprio but I must concede that here he gives a compelling and sympathetic performance as J Edgar in a time period spanning the best part of five decades and it's a testament to the humanism of both the script and his performance that as monstrous as the character often is we never entirely lose our sympathy for a man whose loving instincts (his date with the young woman who ultimately becomes his lifelong secretary is an absolute hoot) are crushed by a domineering mother (Judi Dench) and the strictures of the time which made an open (and not necessarily physical) same sex relationship impossible. As the object of Edgar's affections Armie Hammer upstages the star with a touchingly heartfelt performance as Clyde Tolson and there are brief but strong supporting performances from Judi Dench as Mother and Naomi Watts as Edgar's loyal secretary Helen Gandy.For all its epic sweep - we see the young Edgar fighting communists in the early 1920's and his involvement in the Lindbergh kidnapping of the 30's - and the beautifully conceived flashback/forward structure (at one point the elderly Hoover and Tolson shuffle into a lift only to emerge from it as their younger dynamic selves 40 years earlier), the way these events are yoked to Edgar's psychology make this an almost suffocatingly interior film. Fatalistic, wreathed in shadows and unreliable memories, suffused with loss and shot through with a haunting, melancholy feel, it's a long way from your standard Hollywood biopic.At one point in Edgar's self-aggrandizing version of history a young black agent asks him which is more important, the organisation or the man who founded it. Edgar's reply is that there's no difference between the two and that's the tragedy of J Edgar. That prevented from developing a loving relationship he gave his all to the FBI with himself as its only permitted star. The result for Edgar was power, fame and fear, but never love. When Melvin Purvis shot John Dillinger, Hoover was so enraged at the prospect of the man's fame that he had him sidelined instantly. The film reveals that Hoover appears to have co-operated with Hollywood and commercial interests quite happily just so long as he was the beneficiary.One especially memorable moment has Edgar humiliated before a senate committee as one wily politician demands to know in light of Hoover's endorsement of umpteen commercial properties (everything from G-man movies to cereal boxes) how many arrests he's actually made (the answer: none). This comes as a real shock since up to this point we had no idea Edgar was so involved in promoting his own image. Eastwood is in his element here. The theme of image vs reality is one of the perennial themes of his work and runs through the likes of Flags of Our Fathers, Unforgiven, Invictus and many more.Of the wiretappings, illegal recordings and secret files Edgar amassed the film implicitly suggests that it was Edgar's own inability to express his love toward Tolson that fueled his abuse of power - his attempted blackmail of Robert Kennedy, President Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, his hatred of longhairs, progressives, communists, blacks, hippies - all projections of his own tormented desires.One thing I particularly liked is the way that as Edgar gradually succumbs to his demons it's Tolson who becomes the voice of his conscience. In a key scene he warns Edgar away from an attempted blackmail of Martin Luther King. Ultimately it's too late to save Edgar but as the man ascends the stairs to his bedroom for the last time in his life there's a recognition from him that of all the things in the world, love is the strongest and most enduring of all. It's a very moving moment and topped in the scene following as Tolson weeps for the man he loved.This could be, in another director's hands (Oliver Stone for example,) incredibly salacious but Eastwood directs with real sensitivity - the attraction between Hoover and Tolson is instant and magnetic but avoids being exploitative or prurient. Indeed the 'was-J Edgar-gay?' question is much more open to interpretation here than you might suppose. This is about love, it's not about being gay and it most emphatically is not about sex. There's also a lovely nod towards those rumours about Edgar's supposed fondness for cross-dressing. The production values and sense of period are utterly believable and a remarkable achievement on a budget of some $35 million.J Edgar got a lukewarm reception from viewers and critics - liberals disliked its even-handed portrait of J Edgar while conservatives resented the implication that Hoover may have been gay and most viewers had little to no interest in an obscure historical figure - but the intelligent and perceptive script, the powerhouse performances and Eastwood's direction, mean, I suspect, that the reputation of J Edgar will only grow as the years go by. This is the kind of intelligent, mature film that Hollywood has all but given up making and if it wasn't for Eastwood's clout it likely never would have gotten made. Cautiously recommended then but don't go in expecting some standard Hollywood biopic. It really isn't that.",5,"Love, frustrated",1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,6075,"['Eastwood', 'excellent', 'film', 'typical', 'example', 'preference', 'working', 'genre', 'same', 'time', 'creating',

1518191,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B006OFN0BQ,Roger J. Buffington,"[5, 6]","I had grave doubts that this movie would come off.  The subject matter, the life of J. Edgar Hoover, is notoriously complex and other attempts in the past to put it on the big, or the little, screen have not come off well.  Nor did I see how Dicaprio could pull off the role of J. Edgar Hoover.  It did not seem like a good fit to me.  However, I am glad to be wrong.  Dicapiro does a truly stellar job in the role of J. Edgar Hoover.  I quickly found myself forgetting that it was Dicaprio playing a role -- that was J. Edgar Hoover up on the screen.  The storyline in this film is very accurate as far as the facts go.  One inaccuracy, which I suppose Hollywood could not resist, was the notion that there was at least a tiny romantic spark between Hoover and Miss Helen Gandy, his personal assistant.  There is no factual basis for this assumption that I know of.My main criticism of the film is that it appears to focus overmuch on the relationship between Clyde Tolson and Hoover.  Tolson, of course, was Hoover's number two man at the Bureau and lifelong friend.  I am imagining that this film accurately depicts the relationship between the two men; many biographers agree with this film that the relationship between the two was more than friendship.  I simply thought that the film focused excessively on this aspect of Hoover's life rather than other more interesting aspects.  I would have liked to have seen even more depictions of Hoover blackmailing American politicians and exercising the unwholesome excessive power that he wielded in American political life for decades.  There is a fair amount of that in this film, but more would have been better.  Hoover's feud with the CIA is another avenue that could have been explored more. Just my opinion.This is a solid film that captures at least in part the life of a complex man who history is still in the process of judging.  Recommended.

Edgar Hoover. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to my expectations. The story was very choppy, bouncing back and forth from Hoover's early years to just before his death. A senior Hoover is giving his memoirs, and talking about his glory days. I would have loved to get a deeper insight into Hoover's psyche and have had more depth into the forming of the FBI and his political ideals. Instead, we're only shown a Hoover who rants against the Bolsheviks (Communists), and his forming of the FBI seemed to be set on fast-forward. There were brief glimpses of the take down of several infamous mobsters, a lengthy investigation into the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, and too much time spent on Hoover's private life.It felt like the screen writer read through Hoover's Wikipedia entry and had to mention every single allegation about his private life. Which was pretty ridiculous since Hoover kept his private life private and certainly didn't discuss it in any memoir. I wouldn't have minded a brief look at his private life, but I wanted to see more of a concentration on his work as that was his priority in life. The social drama was very slow and drawn out. Though, the political drama was much too rushed and not explained well.The saving grace of the film was the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio did an amazing job as both young and old Hoover. He was pure perfection in the role. There were a slew of other famous faces in brief cameo appearances, each bringing their talent but never over-shadowing.

In the early decades of the 20th century this was a silly question as ""detectives"" were unaware of such basic forensic science as fingerprinting and everyone agreed that a man's private affairs remained private.J. Edgar Hoover, the subject of Clint Eastwood's biopic, may have done more than anyone to create our modern America. Leonardo DiCaprio takes on this most difficult of roles in Eastwood's dark and detailed ""J. Edgar,"" a movie that somehow adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Hoover's legend just sits there, taunting the filmmaker. At 29, he took over the Bureau of Investigation and ruled like a czar for the next 48 years.In the movie's most successful scenes, Hoover builds the Bureau on science and zeal, fueled by his boundless ambition and the power of secrets. No agent could steal the limelight from Hoover, a true glory hound (all in the interests of promoting the Bureau, he claimed). Even though the Bureau nabbed notorious criminals and ""solved"" the Crime of the Century (the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby), Hoover had no signature triumph or even a definitive foe. But he did fight and win innumerable power struggles with eight presidents. No one dared cross him. There is story enough for a good miniseries, much less a feature film.Then there is the juicy stuff about Hoover that you have probably heard, like his cross-dressing and sexual orientation. Eastwood gamely but respectfully explores Hoover's unorthodox private life. Young Hoover is an oddball, raised by a domineering mother (Judi Dench) and living with her well into his adult years. Hoover takes a young Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) on an early date to the Library of Congress to show off the card file system he created ... and proposes. She rejects him firmly, and he responds by making her his lifelong personal secretary. Hoover also forms a lasting relationship with fellow agent Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer, in an under-appreciated performance) that is so close that the rumors of homosexuality seem like a foregone conclusion. The truth is much more complex. Mother, Gandy, and Tolson all loved Hoover in their way, but each relationship brought with it clearly defined boundaries.Eastwood has made a handsome movie (the period cinematography by Tom Stern is appropriately grim and dark) that ticks off all the major points of the Hoover story. But ultimately Hoover defies us all and remains a frustrating, unsatisfying subject to the end. Put ""J. Edgar"" next to other biopics that aimed high and missed -- ""Amelia"" and ""Hoffa"" are also on this list. ""J. Edgar"" may not miss by much, but if Hoover demanded anything, it was perfection.Extras on the ""J. Edgar"" DVD are limited to language options and a short film, ""A Complicated Man,"" in which the cast and Eastwood discuss the Hoover enigma.

Edgard Hoover started the federal bureau of investigations that he had the noblest of intent, however as we now know he is better remember for his deceit, corruption and questionable behavior than anything else. Producer-director Clint Eastwood wants to change that image somewhat in his new film by apologizing at best and excusing at worst the behavior of Hoover. When in truth, a powerful dramatic film exposing his faults by showing his noble ambitions to start with could be an interesting film and easily should have been when this talent pool came together on this particular film. Alas, if I only had a dime for every great missed opportunity I've spotted 1in cinema.As it stands the movie J.EDGAR still unfolds well enough on the screen, the performances are great, Leonard Di Caprio does well in the title  role despite the script lacking depth or warmth for his character. Armie Hammer under plays the role of Clyde Tolson as to never steal the spotlight. Judi Dench is masterful as always as Edgar's mother, dominating Leo in every scene as to allow us to fully feel the role she must have played in Hoover's real life. The period production details are flawles, this is always one of my favorite things in the movies, I love the feel of going back in time, much more than the feeling of purely fantastic worlds such as Narnia or middle Earth.All this this under Eastwood's direction keeps the movie watchable, and even at has moments of greatness, but other things seem to constantly distract the viewer. The make-up effects, which I believe were Oscar nominated, serve as the largest of these nuisances simply because of the movies misguided structure which has the elderly Hoover telling his story to a writer, so we see a lot of Leo in unconvincing old man getup. If you see the film, notice that he resembles a cross between Jack Nicholson and Truman Capote, or at least Toby Jones playing Truman Capote. This serves as a constant distraction, but Hammer's make-up is far worst.  We also get a lot of cliche dialogue, especially in Di Caprio's voice overs, at one point he informs us that those who forget the past, well, at least he let's us fill in the blank. This script by the way is from the Oscar winning writer ofMilk, he just seems to have gotten lazy here. The lighting is very somber and doesn't help to make the characters any more likable when our tolerance for these people are generally wanting.The way the movie handles Hoover's personal life, i.e the relationship with Clyde Tolson, is handle with kid cloves. As is the awkward, but sensible way Eastwood deals with the allegations of J. Edgar's cross dressing, the scene is played out in sort of a touching way. Still, the most interesting parts of Hoover's life seems to be barely touched upon or skipped over all together, this may be partially explained by a late scene in the film when Clyde Tolson tongue lashes Edgar for telling ""exaggerations and blatant lies"" in his autobiography, which the movie had already dramatized as if fact. Then the film ends abruptly, pretty much the same way the whole movie had played out, matter-of-factly and unconvincing.",3,lacking in depth and warmth,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,3168,"['am', 'sure', 'when', 'J.', 'Edgard', 'Hoover', 'started', 'federal', 'bureau', 'investigations', 'had', 'noblest', 'intent', 'however', 'now', 'know', 'better', 'remember', 'deceit', 'corruption', 'questionable', 'behavior', 'anything', 'else', 'Producer-director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'change', 'image', 'somewhat', 'new', 'film', 'apologizing', 'best', 'excusing', 'worst', 'behavior', 'Hoover', 'When', 'truth', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'film', 'exposing', 'faults', 'showing', 'noble', 'ambitions', 'start', 'could', 'be', 'interesting', 'film', 'easily', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'talent', 'pool', 'came', 'together', 'particular', 'film', 'Alas', 'only', 'had', 'dime', 'great', 'missed', 'opportunity', ""'ve"", 'spotted', '1in', 'cinema.As', 'movie', 'J.EDGAR', 'still', 'well', 'enough', 'screen', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Leonard', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'well', 'title', 'role', 'script', 'lacking', 'depth', 'warmth', 'character', 'Armie', 'Hammer', 'role', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'never', 'steal', 'spotlight', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'masterful', 'as', 'always', 'Edgar', 'mother', 'dominating', 'Leo', 'scene', 'allow', 'fully', 'feel', 'role', 'must', 'have', 'played', 'Hoover', 'real', 'life', 'period', 'production', 'details', 'are', 'flawles', 'always', 'one', 'favorite', 'things', 'movies', 'love', 'feel', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'much', 'more', 'feeling', 'purely', 'fantastic', 'worlds', 'such', 'Narnia', 'middle', 'Earth.All', 'Eastwood', 'direction', 'movie', 'watchable', 'even', 'moments', 'greatness', 'other', 'things', 'seem', 'constantly', 'distract', 'viewer', 'make-up', 'effects', 'believe', 'were', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'serve', 'largest', 'nuisances', 'simply', 'movies', 'misguided', 'structure', 'elderly', 'Hoover', 'telling', 'story', 'writer', 'see', 'lot', 'Leo', 'unconvincing', 'old', 'man', 'getup', 'see', 'film', 'notice', 'cross', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'least', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'playing', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'constant', 'distraction', 'Hammer', 'make-up', 'far', 'worst', 'also', 'get', 'lot', 'cliche', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'voice', 'overs', 'one', 'point', 'who', 'forget', 'past', 'well', 'least', 'let', 'fill', 'blank', 'script', 'way', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'writer', 'ofMilk', 'just', 'have', 'gotten', 'lazy', 'here', 'lighting', 'very', 'somber', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'characters', 'more', 'likable', 'when', 'tolerance', 'people', 'are', 'generally', 'wanting.The', 'way', 'movie', 'Hoover', 'personal', 'life', 'i.e', 'relationship', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'handle', 'kid', 'cloves', 'awkward', 'sensible', 'way', 'Eastwood', 'deals', 'allegations', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'cross', 'dressing', 'scene', 'played', 'out', 'sort', 'touching', 'way', 'Still', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'Hoover', 'life', 'be', 'barely', 'touched', 'skipped', 'together', 'may', 'be', 'partially', 'explained', 'late', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'tongue', 'lashes', 'Edgar', 'telling', 'exaggerations', 'blatant', 'lies', 'autobiography', 'movie', 'had', 'already', 'dramatized', 'fact', 'Then', 'film', 'abruptly', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'whole', 'movie', 'had', 'played', 'out', 'matter-of-factly', 'unconvincing']",N/A

The script set out to find a fence right in the middle of the two historic forces. One believes Mr Hoover should be canonized, the other side would like to hang,draw and quarter him.So from there you research and research again, and remove the splinters from the derriere and tell it how it was.Just as Louis B Mayer removed Thalberg from his position of power at MGM, so too did Hoover on numerous occasions remove rightful FBI operatives from the limelight when catching notorios criminals,and took on the glory himself.He victimised any FBI agent suspected of homosexuality and drove them out of the Bureau. Yet he was one himself.He befriended underworld figures through the horse track, had no compunction about betting large amounts on ""fixed"" races,and was always reimbursed if a race didn't finish how it was supposed to. Hoover's hand didn't go into his pocket too often. It was because he compromised himself in this way, that he would never agree to any crack down on the very people who were lining his pockets. His refusal to acknowledge the existence of the Mafia was laughable.Clyde Tolson joined the FBI in 1928 and three years later became Hoover's second in charge. Tolson and Hoover virtually lived together,lunched daily together,and always holidayed together each year. Hoover had the bugging devices in place to blackmail anyone in a position to remove him from his Directorship of the FBI.This was touched on in the movie,when Hoover asks his secretary Helen Gandy to destroy his secret files on prominent Americans,plus all accompanying tapes should anything ever happen to him - which she did. He blackmailed LBJ,JFK,Monroe,Nixon,and in 1964, he wiretapped Dr Martin Luther King. He even had a wiretap on Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt,taken in a hotel room with Joe Lash, who was an advisor to FDR.The evilness of Hoover, which knew no bounds - was skated over by Eastwood. Because of the inability of Preidents to stare down Hoover - he kept his job. For this reason, a closer investigation of Hoover's activities should have been essential to the making of this movie. For some reason, it didn't happen that way.And the movie suffered irreparably because of it.",2,The Great Whitewash,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,2482,"['admire', 'respect', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'words', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'growth', 'actor', 'mounting', 'approval.The', 'outstanding', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'give', 'poor', 'performance', 'great', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Edgar', 'mother.So', 'where', 'was', 'mish-mash', 'script', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'fence', 'right', 'middle', 'two', 'historic', 'forces', 'One', 'Mr', 'Hoover', 'should', 'be', 'canonized', 'other', 'side', 'would', 'like', 'hang', 'draw', 'quarter', 'him.So', 'research', 'research', 'again', 'remove', 'splinters', 'derriere', 'tell', 'how', 'was.Just', 'Louis', 'B', 'Mayer', 'removed', 'Thalberg', 'position', 'power', 'MGM', 'so', 'too', 'did', 'Hoover', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'remove', 'rightful', 'FBI', 'operatives', 'limelight', 'when', 'catching', 'notorios', 'criminals', 'took', 'glory', 'himself.He', 'victimised', 'FBI', 'agent', 'suspected', 'homosexuality', 'drove', 'Bureau', 'was', 'one', 'himself.He', 'befriended', 'underworld', 'figures', 'horse', 'track', 'had', 'compunction', 'betting', 'large', 'amounts', 'fixed', 'races', 'was', 'always', 'reimbursed', 'race', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'how', 'was', 'supposed', 'Hoover', 'hand', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'pocket', 'too', 'often', 'was', 'compromised', 'way', 'would', 'never', 'agree', 'crack', 'down', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'lining', 'pockets', 'refusal', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'Mafia', 'was', 'laughable.Clyde', 'Tolson', 'joined', 'FBI', '1928', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'became', 'Hoover', 'second', 'charge', 'Tolson', 'Hoover', 'virtually', 'lived', 'together', 'lunched', 'daily', 'together', 'always', 'holidayed', 'together', 'year', 'Hoover', 'had', 'bugging', 'devices', 'place', 'blackmail', 'anyone', 'position', 'remove', 'Directorship', 'FBI.This', 'was', 'touched', 'movie', 'when', 'Hoover', 'secretary', 'Helen', 'Gandy', 'destroy', 'secret', 'files', 'prominent', 'Americans', 'accompanying', 'tapes', 'should', 'anything', 'ever', 'happen', 'did', 'blackmailed', 'LBJ', 'JFK', 'Monroe', 'Nixon', '1964', 'wiretapped', 'Dr', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'even', 'had', 'wiretap', 'Mrs', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'taken', 'hotel', 'room', 'Joe', 'Lash', 'who', 'was', 'advisor', 'FDR.The', 'evilness', 'Hoover', 'knew', 'bounds', 'was', 'skated', 'Eastwood', 'inability', 'Preidents', 'stare', 'down', 'Hoover', 'kept', 'job', 'reason', 'closer', 'investigation', 'Hoover', 'activities', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'essential', 'making', 'movie', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'movie', 'suffered', 'irreparably']",N/A

He is one of my top seven favorite actors, and I am among the group of people that felt that DiCaprio was robbed of an Oscar this year (for his role in Wolf of Wall Street). Leonardo Di Caprio carefully plays both the good and shadowy aspects of J. Edgar&#8217;s lifelong career in the FBI. The film shows how his mother had a strong influence on his professional and personal demeanor (played by Judi Dench). The positive side of him that the movie showed was through the Lindbergh kidnapping incident where he showed determination to track down whoever was responsible for the kidnapping. One of the incidents in the movie that showcases the shadowy side of Hoover is shown through how he reacts to Martin Luther King Jr. accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Naomi Watts plays the role of Helen Gandy, Hoover&#8217;s personal secretary. Arnie Hammer plays the role of Clyde Tolson, a man who initially became FBI clerk and is listed to have eventually been promoted to Associate Director of FBI. The end of the J.

This may be some kind of deliberate artistic cinematic technique, but to my mind it simply makes ""J. Edgar"" a real chore to watch and to try to figure out what's going on in the gloom.

There are fake accents. There are wildly varying volume levels. Fortunately, there are also subtitles. If I hadn't turned them on, I wouldn't have understood at least half of the dialogue--and no, there's nothing wrong with my hearing. Again, is this artsy technique or just sloppy filmmaking? I really don't know, but I do know that the crappy sound took a lot away from the movie.As far as content, I think ""J.

It also touches on his homosexuality, but doesn't focus on it except for one scene (man kiss).Leonardo DiCaprio played J.Edgar similar to how he played Howard Hughes. The script brings out the complexity of Hoover as both a genius patriot and a blackmailing diabolical man. It shows him as reluctant to spy on reporters for Nixon and someone who disliked Joe McCarthy. An interesting movie for any history buff.

1518220,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B006OFN0BQ,The Peripatetic Reader,"[4, 4]","Clint Eastwood is probably a better director than actor, and this movie proves it. J. Edgar is a masterful rendering of the life of J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI, a political figure far removed from today's public's memory, and we're all the better for it. For those who are not familiar with the person, J. Edgar Hoover was a vain, vile, heartless, media-mongering mama's boy, a paranoid control-freak who had no regard for the Bill of Rights or to anyone he perceived to be a ""danger."" He had the appearance of a bulldog, but as Groucho Marx would say, that would be insulting to bulldogs. He exerted his influence by digging up dirt about public figures, all in the name of national security. Yes, he had the goods on everyone in those files of his. He wreaked much damage to the constitutional fabric of this country, and would order a wire tap at a moment's notice (sound familiar?)on anyone he perceived to be a threat and, as put more fittingly by the Clyde Tolson figure in this movie, someone whose memory will be reviled by history.All these adjectives accurately describe Hoover the man and are brilliantly and brilliantly depicted in this film. For those of us who did not have the honor of living while J.Edgar was with us, probably the most titillating subject the film could portray would be the issue about his sexuality. Eastwood could have covered the subject in several ways, either by showing Hoover as (1) cross-dresser, as some maintain; (2) a closet case; or (3) an indignant clod incapable of having any genuine affection, of whatever variety. Eastwood handled the subject with understatement, but all these possibilities are alluded to, but understated. A more flagrant portrail would have diminished the legitimacy of this moviue, and Eastwood wisely decided for understatement. In an interesting twist, he makes Hoover the victim of Tolson's own aggression, ironic for a person who had so little regard for anyone or any thing which did not conform to his own standards, whatever in heaven's name that might jhave been.Eastwood is underrated as a director. Think of Invictus and Gran Torino. His use of flashbacks and flash forwards didn't work in Flags of Our Fathers. In J.Edgar Eastwood he successfully makes use of these devises, and the flashbacks and flash forwards aid in showing Hoover's fragmented, messed up personality. DeCaprio's depiction of this hated person is equally masterful. This is the first movie in modern memory where he melds into Hoover's character and the viewer can forget that this is Leonardo DiCaprio on the screen playing a movie character, a satsifying and good piece of acting.Eastwood again wisely is not judgmental in his depiction. The events of Hoover's life are shown pretty much as they unfolded. It effectively showed how Hoover blackmailed politicians from whom he sought favor. For example, by that time Hoover sought to stay in his position as director during Kennedy's administration. He did so by requesting Robert Kennedy inform the President that he had reports of JFK's affairs and that they could be ""damaging"" to the President's reputation.For non-Baby Boomers, Eastwood's movie should be watched to get an idea of what life was like before Bush and Cheney. For the Baby Boom generation this movie is old news, and reminds us all what a self-righteous hypocrite the man really was in life. Perhaps the real message of this movie is not very much has changed.",5,Five Stars !,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3453,"['Clint', 'Eastwood', 'probably', 'better', 'director', 'actor', 'movie', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'masterful', 'rendering', 'life', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'first', 'director', 'FBI', 'political', 'figure', 'far', 'removed', 'today', 'public', 'memory', ""'re"", 'better', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'person', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'was', 'vain', 'vile', 'heartless', 'media-mongering', 'mama', 'boy', 'paranoid', 'control-freak', 'who', 'had', 'regard', 'Bill', 'Rights', 'anyone', 'perceived', 'be', 'danger', 'had', 'appearance', 'bulldog', 'Groucho', 'Marx', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'insulting', 'bulldogs', 'exerted', 'influence', 'digging', 'up', 'dirt', 'public', 'figures', 'name', 'national', 'security', 'Yes', 'had', 'goods', 'everyone', 'files', 'wreaked', 'much', 'damage', 'constitutional', 'fabric', 'country', 'would', 'order', 'wire', 'tap', 'moment', 'notice', 'sound', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'perceived', 'be', 'threat', 'put', 'more', 'fittingly', 'Clyde', 'Tolson', 'figure', 'movie', 'someone', 'memory', 'will', 'be', 'reviled', 'history.All', 'adjectives', 'accurately', 'describe', 'Hoover', 'man', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'brilliantly', 'depicted', 'film', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'honor', 'living', 'J.Edgar', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'titillating', 'subject', 'film', 'could', 'portray', 'would', 'be', 'issue', 'sexuality', 'Eastwood', 'could', 'have', 'covered', 'subject', 'several', 'ways', 'either', 'showing', 'Hoover', '1', 'cross-dresser', 'maintain', '2', 'closet', 'case', '3', 'indignant', 'clod', 'incapable', 'having', 'genuine', 'affection', 'variety', 'Eastwood', 'handled', 'subject', 'understatement', 'possibilities', 'are', 'alluded', 'understated', 'more', 'flagrant', 'portrail', 'would', 'have', 'diminished', 'legitimacy', 'moviue', 'Eastwood', 'wisely', 'decided', 'understatement', 'interesting', 'twist', 'Hoover', 'victim', 'Tolson', 'own', 'aggression', 'ironic', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'so', 'little', 'regard', 'anyone', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'conform', 'own', 'standards', 'whatever', 'heaven', 'name', 'might', 'jhave', 'been.Eastwood', 'underrated', 'director', 'Think', 'Invictus', 'Gran', 'Torino', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Flags', 'Fathers', 'J.Edgar', 'Eastwood', 'successfully', 'use', 'devises', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'aid', 'showing', 'Hoover', 'fragmented', 'messed', 'up', 'personality', 'DeCaprio', 'depiction', 'hated', 'person', 'equally', 'masterful', 'first', 'movie', 'modern', 'memory', 'where', 'Hoover', 'character', 'viewer', 'can', 'forget', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'screen', 'playing', 'movie', 'character', 'satsifying', 'good', 'piece', 'acting.Eastwood', 'again', 'wisely', 'not', 'judgmental', 'depiction', 'events', 'Hoover', 'life', 'are', 'shown', 'pretty', 'much', 'unfolded', 'effectively', 'showed', 'how', 'Hoover', 'blackmailed', 'politicians', 'whom', 'sought', 'favor', 'example', 'time', 'Hoover', 'sought', 'stay', 'position', 'director', 'Kennedy', 'administration', 'did', 'so', 'requesting', 'Robert', 'Kennedy', 'inform', 'President', 'had', 'reports', 'JFK', 'affairs', 'could', 'be', 'damaging', 'President', 'reputation.For', 'non-Baby', 'Boomers', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Bush', 'Cheney', 'Baby', 'Boom', 'generation', 'movie', 'old', 'news', 'what', 'self-righteous', 'hypocrite', 'man', 'really', 'was', 'life', 'Perhaps', 'real', 'message', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'changed']",N/A

President Nixon has been rightly criticized for thinking and acting as if ""the President"" is above the law.  The same was true of Hoover.Hoover was lucky to have three people devoted to him -- his mother, his secretary Ms. Gandy, and Clyde Tolson.  Hoover lived with his mother until she died.  His basic character apparently could partially be explained by the dynamics of his relationship with his mother.  Ms. Gandy preferred to be married to her job rather than to Hoover though she loyally served Hoover until he died.  Hoover's 40 years plus relationship with Clyde Tolson is perhaps even more fascinating and determinative.  Director Eastwood purposely left the Hoover-Tolson relationship ambiguous.  It seems clear that Tolson loves and admires Hoover, but not as clear how Hoover feels about Tolson except Hoover needs Tolson by his side.  Whether any of that involved sex is not clarified.At first glance the idea of this movie might seem boring, but in actuality it was fascinating to watch this flawed man with his obsession about Communism remain in power while eight Presidents came and went.

JFK, LBJ, or Nixon, most likely. And they'd be wrong. During all their turns as chief executive, only one man had all of them quaking in their boots.J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is dictating his autobiography to a young FBI agent and this provides the sequence of events for the film. The beginning of his relationship with long-time secretary and confidant Helen Gandy (played by Naomi Watts), the creation and growth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and those prominent cases that helped to garner press coverage for the Bureau and Hoover specifically. Chief among those is the Lindbergh kidnapping. But we find out later during a private moment between Hoover and his deputy, Clyde Tolson (played by Armie Hammer) that his recollections are usually embellished and occasionally flat-out lies. And while the relationship of Hoover and Tolson has been the subject of much speculation, the film does little to explore it.If you read and remember my review of Water for Elephants, than you know I hate Leonardo DiCaprio. That hatred, however, has not stopped me from enjoying several of his movies in the theater and purchasing them on DVD. The Aviator, Blood Diamond, and, most recently, Inception to name a few. I also enjoy Clint Eastwood's work as both a director and an actor despite serious missteps like True Crime and Blood Work. And while I've never liked Hoover, I was anxious to see this film on his life. When you start off intending to make a film about a paranoid, power-mad, cross-dresser with a penchant for blackmail and who is alleged to have had an affair with his second-in-command, ending up with a dull finished product is practically an accomplishment and that's what happened.

This time the film is written by Dustin Lance Black (Oscar winner for ""Milk"") and directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the most respected film directors living today. Despite his assured direction and the impressive production designs, however, ""J. Edgar"" is a missed opportunity for a more insightful drama about the man who reigned over the bureau (if you count the Bureau of Investigation preceding FBI) nearly half a century.""J. Edgar"" starts with Hoover in the early 1960s, dictating the early history of FBI to a writer. He recounts how everything started back in 1919, when Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer was nearly killed by a bomb attack. Then the film moves back and forth between the two times, each of which represents two different phases of the man's life.I see the point the filmmakers are trying to make, but the film's too complicated narrative structure does not help in telling the important incidents (like the Lindbergh kidnapping), which are frequently interrupted without any good reasons. As to the relationship between Hoover and Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), not much is very interesting, as the latter as a character is not fully fleshed-out. The same can be said about his secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts), and his mother Anna Marie (Judi Dench).Leonardo DiCaprio (nominated for Golden Globe but ignored by Academy Award) delivers a solid performance, but his portrayal of the aged Hoover, in spite of the special aging make-up, doesn't convince.

1518227,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B006OFN0BQ,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Once upon a time, Clint Eastwood was a right-wing Republican who churned out revenge fantasies about vigilantes who breathlessly enjoyed taking the law into their own hands. In these 'ancient' times, J. Edgar Hoover may have been one of Eastwood's heroes. As Hollywood has changed quite a bit since then, Eastwood instinctively realized that if he didn't change with the times, he could barely survive in a new politically correct world. Given the new exigencies, Eastwood could no longer ignore all of Hoover's bad behavior, including the iconic FBI director's paranoia and abject pettiness. Fortunately for Mr. Eastwood, he found the perfect politically correct screenwriter in Dustin Lance Black, who could mitigate Hoover's bad points by not only focusing on his private life as a closeted, repressed homosexual but also turning him into a tragic figure who was scarred by a manipulative and overbearing mother.Mr. Black does far worse in depicting Hoover's public persona than his private one. In Citizen Kane-like fashion, narration and a series of flashbacks are utilized to tell Hoover's story. But unlike Kane, which is told from multiple points of view, Hoover's story comes from Hoover himself, who is seen dictating his memoirs in his office to various FBI agents during the 60s and early 70s. The flashbacks for the early period begin in the early 20s when Hoover recounts his stint as a young lawyer in the Justice Department and how he became involved in that Department's crusade against so-called radicals and subversives, initiated by Attorney General Palmer in 1919 (whose home is shown dramatically firebombed in the beginning of the film).Black has great difficulty in dramatizing the Director's early career and we see one dubious scene of Hoover participating in a raid where radicals are eventually deported. More interesting is Hoover's obsession with details in the scene where he reveals his new card catalog system at the Library of Congress to his secretary-to-be, Helen Gandy. Black addresses Hoover's pettiness in taking all the credit for the G-men's heroics including his most egregious conduct in that regard, the demotion of Agent Purvis, responsible for the take down of John Dillinger. Black alludes to all of this but we never see the conflict with Purvis successfully dramatized. So desperate for drama, Black spends a good deal of time dissecting the Lindbergh kidnapping, which Hoover was only tangentially involved in. But even the Lindbergh scene fails to flow as Black interrupts the action by cutting back to events from the 60s. Josh Lucas is totally wrong as Lindbergh, as not only doesn't he look like him, but has no dialogue that conveys the famed aviator's dynamism.Jeffrey Donovan looks a lot more like Robert Kennedy and manages to get the accent right but Hoover's whole conflict with the Kennedy's is reduced to Bobby telling J. Edgar in essence, ""times have changed"". Even more sketchy is Hoover's treatment of Martin Luther King. Because we see everything from Hoover's point of view and never meet any of the Civil Rights era characters he opposes, his egregious conduct seems muted. Eastwood must resort to cheap shots such as having Hoover listen to a salacious tape (presumably of a MLK tryst), and receiving a phone call at the same time, right after JFK is shot.Eastwood and Black are on more solid ground in attempting to humanize Hoover by providing insight into his private life. Since little is known of what went on behind 'closed doors', a screenwriter is obligated to take dramatic license and speculate as to the events that could have unfolded. Eastwood does well in not showing Hoover as sexually aggressive and actually not initiating a sexual encounter with his long term confidante, Clyde Tolson, who he appointed his associate director at the FBI. In Dustin Lance Black's view, it was Tolson who was the sexual aggressor, and fashions a scene where Hoover rebuffs Tolson after he kisses him following Hoover's revelation that he might have had a sexual encounter with the screen actress, Dorothy Lamour. For a good part of the film, Black depicts Tolson as a toady, picking out his wardrobe at expensive stores and indulging Hoover in his forays at the racetrack. Only after Tolson falls victim to a stroke does he seem to muster the courage to confront Hoover, criticizing him for his selfish behavior and paranoid outlook (Tolson's critique is illustrated in the 'correct' flashback where Hoover no longer receives credit for arresting all those criminals he claimed to have taken down personally). Tolson here is really Black's conscience speaking, and whether Tolson would have turned on Hoover in that way, I have no idea. What's missing is any sense of Tolson's intellectual life and ultimately he's little more than an entertaining stereotype of a closeted gay man.DiCaprio does a decent job depicting a control freak Hoover minus the Kane-like gyrations at the end. Armie Hammer's Tolson is entertaining (sans the bad makeup job as the elderly Tolson) but Naomi Watts has little to do as the secretary. Judi Dench is excellent as the demented mom.Like Orson Welles, Eastwood falters in attempting to turn Hoover into a tragic figure who didn't really like himself. Welles unfairly criticized William Randolph Hearst by speciously linking 'Rosebud' (Kane's childhood keepsake, a sled) to a miserable childhood. Hoover's mother's dress (the one he puts on after she dies) is perhaps Eastwood's 'Rosebud'--the dress also symbolizes Hoover's inability to escape his attachment to his mother and her disparagement of his sexuality which he must suppress (the mother's 'daffodil' comment is the last straw!).But perhaps Eastwood and Black's interpretation is all wrong. Perhaps Hoover actually did like himself and didn't have an inferiority complex due to his overbearing mother. If that's the case, Hoover should be seen as far more maniacal than Eastwood lets on here. All the harm that Hoover did can no longer be chalked up to a 'bad childhood'.",3,Hoover's mother's dress may be Eastwood's 'Rosebud',1321056000,"11 12, 2011",2011,6069,"['***', 'review', 'may',

1518234,AP3B615GM191G,B006OFN0BQ,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","Though most definitely an interesting subject, the trouble with adapting the life of J. Edgar Hoover to the big screen is that he was such a secretive person.  Very few people (most of which took the secrets to their grave) knew the ""true story"" of J. Edgar, leaving much up for interpretation.  Thus, whether you not you perceive this as a good film will largely depend on your faith in director Clint Eastwood.For a basic plot summary, ""J Edgar"" focuses on, well, the life of the former FBI director (played by Leonardo DiCaprio).  From his relationship with his mother (Judi Dench) and a complicated friendship with his ""number two man"" Clyde Tolson (Arnie Hammer), Eastwood paints a portrait of Hoover while also describing the events that took place to create the modern FBI and intelligence-gathering as we know it.This movie works primarily because it is such an interesting subject.  J. Edgar is a fascinating character study in his own right, while the story of the FBI is even more compelling.  I knew relatively nothing about either subject going in, and was surprised at nearly every turn.The film's ""intangibles"" are also solid.  Eastwood is his usual masterful self, providing both the framework and the music for the piece.  The acting is top-notch and really succeeds in putting viewers inside the time period.The only thing holding this movie back, potentially, was the fact that some of the character arcs were left incomplete (whether intentionally or not I can't say).  For example, I never felt as if I really understood Hoover's relationship with his mother, despite the fact that much time was devoted to the pair on-screen.  To me, the ""FBI stuff"" was what really stole the show.All in all, ""J Edgar"" is a worthwhile view for history buffs and is just a solid movie overall.  I trust Eastwood in presenting a decent version of the facts at hand, and thus I was able to enjoy the experience.
