Its 2+ hours float by and you'll learn more than you'd ever expect--if you're not already a Greek scholar that is.

547747,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,B00004R8UQ,bixodoido,"[16, 18]","This title is somewhat of a misnomer.  In reality, this film focuses mainly on the city state of Athens, and pays little attention to the rest of Greece.  This is part of the ongoing Empires series of PBS.  In a little less than three hours, this film manages to document the history of Athens from the founding of the city&#65533;s democracy to the execution of Socrates and the dawn of the philosophical age of Greece.This film is very well done, and superbly filmed. It also does an excellent job of detailing the events on which it focuses.  The only complaint I have is that it is too short, and as such is forced to skip large periods in the history.  This creates a number of gaps in the story, which are difficult to fill in if you are not at least modernly familiar with Athens&#65533; history.  Also, most of the detailed coverage ends with the death of Socrates, with the age of Plato, Aristotle, and the philosophers being only briefly summarized.Despite this flaw, this documentary is a good one.  Liam Neeson, who narrates the film, is a perfect fit for the part and does a great job.

547749,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00004R8UQ,Charles Ashbacher,"[3, 4]","At the end of the episode of the original Star Trek series titled ""Who Mourns for Adonais"", Captain Kirk laments having to destroy the power source of the being that calls himself Apollo. He states how the Greeks have given us so much, which is an understatement. The concepts of democracy, scientific thought, abstract mathematical thought, zoology and much of philosophy can all be directly traced back to the ancient Greeks.While this tape mentions those things, the main focus is the history of the city-state of Athens, its rise to glory against the mighty Persian forces to their utter defeat by Sparta. When historians engage in historical ""What-if"" speculations, one of the speculations commonly engaged in are the consequences of an Athenian defeat. Quite likely more than any other thing, it would have changed the course of political, economic, scientific and mathematical history.In only a few decades, Athens rose to the level of a mighty commercial empire, engaging in trade with places all over Europe, Africa and Asia. This led to a flowering of the arts, culminating in the building of the spectacular Parthenon. However, it took only approximately a decade for all of this to be destroyed. A failed strategy in their war with Sparta, the scapegoating and execution of generals by the political class and the resort to mob rule all combined to lead to an utter defeat. In this defeat, there was a rise to power. The philosopher Socrates was the last scapegoat and with his death, we see the rise of the greatest intellectual flowering ever seen.All of this is explained in great detail, after seeing the remnants of the buildings of ancient Athens, both my wife and I vowed to visit Greece.

547754,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B00004R8UQ,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[213, 227]","The title of this DVD is not altogether accurate.  If the writers had been interested in choosing a title which had veracity, the DVD would have been called &quot;Athenians, Crucible of Civilization.&quot;  For it is the Athenians, not the Greeks in general, which this documentary focuses on.  Lacedamon, the other Superpower in Greece, as well as minor city states such as Corinth and Attica, are only mentioned in passing.  Even then, the purpose for speaking of these places is almost always just to point out how they related to Athens.Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  It is true that Athens was a watershed for western culture with its impressive contributions to political ideology, art, literature, theatre, architecture, philosophy, science, polemic techniques and so much more.  All of these above topics were shunned by the people of Sparta, and the rest of the city states in Greece paled in comparison, insofar as these fields are concerned,  when compared to the grandeur of the ostentatious Athenians.One place in which this preference for Athens is taken too far, however, is in the treatment of the Persian War.  There were four major battles in this war;  Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis &amp; Plataea.  Only Marathon and Salamis are noted in this work;  Thermopylae and Plataea are not cited at all.  Apparently, the reason for this is that Marathon &amp; Salamis were the two battles where the Athenians faced the Persians alone [at least for the most part;  there were some allied ships sprinkled into the mix @ Salamis].  At Plataea they squared off against the Persians shoulder-to-shoulder with the Spartans and other Greeks.  The Athenians were not involved @ Thermopylae at all.  Persons who are unfamiliar with Greek history would be likely to walk away from this presentation thinking that there were only 2 major battles in the Persian War, and the Athenians deserve all the credit for saving Greece.  That is a skewed understanding of history, and as such, not a good thing.The biggest oversight of the DVD resides in its chapter on the battle of Marathon.  We are told that after his 140 mile jaunt to Sparta, the messenger Pheidippides' plea for help was refused by the Laconians.  That is very, very, very misleading.  The Lacedamons did NOT intentionally hang their Athenian brethren out to dry in the face of the Persian invasion of Marathon.  Rather, it was due to religious protocal which prevented the Spartan army from setting out right away.  Here is the passage in Herodotus which details the Lacedamons' answer to Pheidippides:&quot;...the Spartans wished to help the Athenians, but were unable to give them any present succour, as they did not like to break their established law.  It was then the ninth day of the first decade;  and they could not march out of Sparta on the ninth, when the moon had not reached the full.  So they waited for the full of the moon.&quot;  (Herodotus, &quot;Histories,&quot;  Book VI [Erato], p. 342, trans:  George Rawlinson)When the Spartans did send their army, they arrived @ Marathon within an astonishing 3 days.  Unfortunately, by then, the fighting was already over &amp; the Athenians had earned a glorious (not to mention improbable) victory.  So, the Laconians congratulated the Athenians and headed home.  The (mostly Ivy league) historians who put this documentary together should have known better than to omit these facts.By now you're probably thinking that I have nothing but bad stuff to say about this work, right?  Well, no, that's not quite true;  I've said all the negative things I am going to say (after all, I did give it 5 stars, right?).  Now it's time to detail why I loved this DVD so much.First of all, what the DVD does cover, it covers very well.  The major epochs of Athens are detailed down thru the ages until the end of the Peleponnesian War.  The work goes over such diverse subjects as the role of women in ancient Athens, the tactics and tools of warfare and the paradigms of pottery &amp; architecture.  Also, the lives of such great men as Themosticles, Pericles and Socrates are  scrutinized extensively.  As an added bonus the narrarator is none other than the venerable Liam Neeson, and the score is nearly movie-soundtrack calibre.Despite my criticisms, I would highly recommend this DVD to all persons who have any interest at all in Greek history and / or the foundations of western thought.",5,"Not perfect, but very good",993340800,"06 24, 2001",2001,4422,"['title', 'DVD', 'not', 'altogether', 'accurate', 'writers', 'had', 'been', 'interested', 'choosing', 'title', 'had', 'veracity', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'quot', 'Athenians', 'Crucible', 'Civilization.', 'quot', 'Athenians', 'not', 'Greeks', 'general', 'documentary', 'Lacedamon', 'other', 'Superpower', 'Greece', 'as', 'well', 'minor', 'city', 'states', 'such', 'Corinth', 'Attica', 'are', 'only', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'Even', 'then', 'purpose', 'speaking', 'places', 'almost', 'always', 'just', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'related', 'Athens.Now', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'true', 'Athens', 'was', 'watershed', 'western', 'culture', 'impressive', 'contributions', 'political', 'ideology', 'art', 'literature', 'theatre', 'architecture', 'philosophy', 'science', 'polemic', 'techniques', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'topics', 'were', 'shunned', 'people', 'Sparta', 'rest', 'city', 'states', 'Greece', 'paled', 'comparison', 'insofar', 'fields', 'are', 'concerned', 'when', 'compared', 'grandeur', 'ostentatious', 'Athenians.One', 'place', 'preference', 'Athens', 'taken', 'too', 'far', 'however', 'treatment', 'Persian', 'War', 'were', 'four', 'major', 'battles', 'war', 'Marathon', 'Thermopylae', 'Salamis', 'amp', 'Plataea', 'Only', 'Marathon', 'Salamis', 'are', 'noted', 'work', 'Thermopylae', 'Plataea', 'are', 'not', 'cited', 'Apparently', 'reason', 'Marathon', 'amp', 'Salamis', 'were', 'two', 'battles', 'where', 'Athenians', 'faced', 'Persians', 'alone', '[', 'least', 'most', 'part', 'were', 'allied', 'ships', 'sprinkled', 'mix', '@', 'Salamis', ']', 'Plataea', 'squared', 'off', 'Persians', 'shoulder-to-shoulder', 'Spartans', 'other', 'Greeks', 'Athenians', 'were', 'not', 'involved', '@', 'Thermopylae', 'Persons', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'Greek', 'history', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'walk', 'away', 'presentation', 'thinking', 'were', 'only', '2', 'major', 'battles', 'Persian', 'War', 'Athenians', 'deserve', 'credit', 'saving', 'Greece', 'skewed', 'understanding', 'history', 'such', 'not', 'good', 'thing.The', 'biggest', 'oversight', 'DVD', 'resides', 'chapter', 'battle', 'Marathon', 'are', 'told', '140', 'mile', 'jaunt', 'Sparta', 'messenger', 'Pheidippides', 'plea', 'help', 'was', 'refused', 'Laconians', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'misleading', 'Lacedamons', 'did', 'NOT', 'intentionally', 'hang', 'Athenian', 'brethren', 'out', 'dry', 'face', 'Persian', 'invasion', 'Marathon', 'Rather', 'was', 'due', 'religious', 'protocal', 'prevented', 'Spartan', 'army', 'setting', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'Here', 'passage', 'Herodotus', 'details', 'Lacedamons', 'answer', 'Pheidippides', 'quot', 'Spartans', 'wished', 'help', 'Athenians', 'were', 'unable', 'give', 'present', 'succour', 'did', 'not', 'break', 'established', 'law', 'was', 'then', 'ninth', 'day', 'first', 'decade', 'could', 'not', 'march', 'Sparta', 'ninth', 'when', 'moon', 'had', 'not', 'reached', 'full', 'waited', 'full', 'moon.', 'quot', 'Herodotus', 'quot', 'Histories', 'quot', 'Book', 'VI', '[', 'Erato', ']', 'p.', '342', 'trans', 'George', 'Rawlinson', 'When', 'Spartans', 'did', 'send', 'army', 'arrived', '@', 'Marathon', 'astonishing', '3', 'days', 'Unfortunately', 'then', 'fighting', 'was', 'already', 'amp', 'Athenians', 'had', 'earned', 'glorious', 'not', 'mention', 'improbable', 'victory', 'So', 'Laconians', 'congratulated', 'Athenians', 'headed', 'home', 'mostly', 'Ivy', 'league', 'historians', 'who', 'put', 'documentary', 'together', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'omit', 'facts.By', 'now', ""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', 'have', 'nothing', 'bad', 'stuff', 'say', 'work', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'quite', 'true', ""'ve"", 'said', 'negative', 'things', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'did', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'right', 'Now', 'time', 'detail', 'why', 'loved', 'DVD', 'much.First', 'what', 'DVD', 'cover', 'very', 'well', 'major', 'epochs', 'Athens', 'are', 'detailed', 'down', 'ages', 'end', 'Peleponnesian', 'War', 'work', 'such', 'diverse', 'subjects', 'role', 'women', 'ancient', 'Athens', 'tactics', 'tools', 'warfare', 'paradigms', 'pottery', 'amp', 'architecture', 'Also', 'lives', 'such', 'great', 'men', 'Themosticles', 'Pericles', 'Socrates', 'are', 'scrutinized', 'extensively', 'added', 'bonus', 'narrarator', 'none', 'other', 'venerable', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'score', 'nearly', 'movie-soundtrack', 'calibre.Despite', 'criticisms', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'persons', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'Greek', 'history', '/', 'foundations', 'western', 'thought']",The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization VHS

547756,A26HFSVLAGULIM,B00004R8UQ,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[4, 5]","IN A NUTSHELL:This fascinating documentary from the series titled 'Empires' is 'The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization', narrated by Liam Neeson and released by PBS HOME VIDEO. With a subject as gigantic as early Greek civilization, and with only 170 minutes [including special features] to cover it in, it was inevitable that this film's focus be somewhat limited. The focus here is clearly on early Athenian civilization and how democracy arose from its earlier roots, which seemed not to be headed toward a future as the first major democracy.From there, the film illustrates how the leaders of Athens were confronted with a political situation which created democracy out of necessity as the common people claimed ownership of their society by literally taking it back from a dictator who had turned tyrant.The important historic figures in the wars with Persia and Sparta are highlighted and tactics as well as the rise and fall of armies and navies are shown in detail. Athens' growth as an international trade mecca, their wealth to build a navy via the discovery of a large vein of silver and much more is covered generously.So of course is Pericles, and the age he ushered in which ended after his untimely death in 429 B.C. which led to a very poor outcome in the Peloponnesian War but a new beginning for Athens out of the ashes.OK THERE IS A LOT HERE ABOUT ATHENS AND ITS WARS BUT THERE IS MORE TOO:The beginning of the Greek culture, and philosophy which comprised the very soul of ancient Greece only began to come to fruition as its marshal and imperial goals were in ruin. Socrates, who is examined in depth in this film, ushers in a new era as he is glorified for dying for his principles after the Athenians climactic defeat to Sparta, with Persian aid, in the neverending Peloponnesian War [431-404 B.C.]. In fact, Socrates was executed [399 B.C.] for causing a moral and spiritual decay that allegedly was a primary cause of the loss of the Peloponnesian War by Athens [according to his accusers]. Rather frivilous charges against Socrates, but his execution cemented him in history and he became a new kind of hero that was not associated with violence or making war for glory --- but for thinking, self-examination, and enlightenment!IN THE END:  A GOOD PLACE TO START IN STUDYING EARLY GREEK CIVILIZATIONYes, most of this film focuses on Athens and battles between Athens and Persia and the Peloponnesian War. But these events shaped what came after it significantly. Philosophy, Art, Drama, Science, Pottery, Women, International Trade, and more is examined, but with the exception of Socrates specifically, everything not pertaining to war seems secondary, and Athens is the only Greek City-State, [though admittedly the most important historically] that is examined in any degree of detail.SPECIAL FEATURES:Their are 4 additional scenes, but they are not narrated by Liam Neeson. They are titled, 'The Hoplites - Greek Soldiers', 'The Women', 'Delphi', 'The Theatre'. Each segment is about 4-5 minutes and do add something to the program. I found the program titled 'The Hoplites' the most interesting because it seemed to have concrete details included from solid historic and archeological evidence.BOTTOM LINE: VERY INTERESTING BUT LIMITED ESSENTIALLY TO ATHENSThe renaissance that followed Socrates death is not fully examined, and since this seems to be at the core of the entire film I do feel a little let-down that the fleshing out of the enlightened age that Socrates ushered in was not delved into. I also wish there was more about the other City-States in Greece rather than an occasional passing reference to them as they pertained to life in Athens.Though not without its faults, this was still a very compelling video to view and is recommended to anyone wishing to find out more about early Greek civilization or ancient history in general.",4,A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON ATHENS & ITS BATTLE HISTORY BUT A FASCINATING & WELL DONE DOCUMENTARY,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,3879,"['IN', 'A', 'NUTSHELL', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'series', 'titled', ""'Empires"", ""'The"", 'Greeks', 'Crucible', 'Civilization', 'narrated', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'released', 'PBS', 'HOME', 'VIDEO', 'subject', 'as', 'gigantic', 'early', 'Greek', 'civilization', 'only', '170', 'minutes', '[', 'including', 'special', 'features', ']', 'cover', 'was', 'inevitable', 'film', 'focus', 'be', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'focus', 'here', 'clearly', 'early', 'Athenian', 'civilization', 'how', 'democracy', 'arose', 'earlier', 'roots', 'seemed', 'not', 'be', 'headed', 'future', 'first', 'major', 'democracy.From', 'there', 'film', 'how', 'leaders', 'Athens', 'were', 'confronted', 'political', 'situation', 'created', 'democracy', 'necessity', 'common', 'people', 'claimed', 'ownership', 'society', 'literally', 'taking', 'back', 'dictator', 'who', 'had', 'turned', 'tyrant.The', 'important', 'historic', 'figures', 'wars', 'Persia', 'Sparta', 'are', 'highlighted', 'tactics', 'as', 'well', 'rise', 'fall', 'armies', 'navies', 'are', 'shown', 'detail', 'Athens', 'growth', 'international', 'trade', 'mecca', 'wealth', 'build', 'navy', 'discovery', 'large', 'vein', 'silver', 'much', 'more', 'covered', 'generously.So', 'course', 'Pericles', 'age', 'ushered', 'ended', 'untimely', 'death', '429', 'B.C', 'led', 'very', 'poor', 'outcome', 'Peloponnesian', 'War', 'new', 'beginning', 'Athens', 'ashes.OK', 'THERE', 'LOT', 'HERE', 'ABOUT', 'ATHENS', 'ITS', 'WARS', 'BUT', 'THERE', 'IS', 'MORE', 'TOO', 'beginning', 'Greek', 'culture', 'philosophy', 'comprised', 'very', 'soul', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'only', 'began', 'come', 'fruition', 'marshal', 'imperial', 'goals', 'were', 'ruin', 'Socrates', 'who', 'examined', 'depth', 'film', 'ushers', 'new', 'era', 'glorified', 'dying', 'principles', 'Athenians', 'climactic', 'defeat', 'Sparta', 'Persian', 'aid', 'neverending', 'Peloponnesian', 'War', '[', '431-404', 'B.C.', ']', 'fact', 'Socrates', 'was', 'executed', '[', '399', 'B.C', ']', 'causing', 'moral', 'spiritual', 'decay', 'allegedly', 'was', 'primary', 'cause', 'loss', 'Peloponnesian', 'War', 'Athens', '[', 'according', 'accusers', ']', 'Rather', 'frivilous', 'charges', 'Socrates', 'execution', 'cemented', 'history', 'became', 'new', 'kind', 'hero', 'was', 'not', 'associated', 'violence', 'making', 'war', 'glory', 'thinking', 'self-examination', 'enlightenment', 'THE', 'END', 'GOOD', 'PLACE', 'TO', 'START', 'IN', 'STUDYING', 'EARLY', 'GREEK', 'CIVILIZATIONYes', 'most', 'film', 'Athens', 'battles', 'Athens', 'Persia', 'Peloponnesian', 'War', 'events', 'shaped', 'what', 'came', 'significantly', 'Philosophy', 'Art', 'Drama', 'Science', 'Pottery', 'Women', 'International', 'Trade', 'more', 'examined', 'exception', 'Socrates', 'specifically', 'everything', 'not', 'pertaining', 'war', 'secondary', 'Athens', 'only', 'Greek', 'City-State', '[', 'admittedly', 'most', 'important', 'historically', ']', 'examined', 'degree', 'detail.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'are', '4', 'additional', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'narrated', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'are', 'titled', 'Hoplites', 'Greek', 'Soldiers', 'Women', ""'Delphi"", 'Theatre', 'segment', '4-5', 'minutes', 'do', 'add', 'something', 'program', 'found', 'program', 'titled', ""'The"", 'Hoplites', 'most', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'have', 'concrete', 'details', 'included', 'solid', 'historic', 'archeological', 'evidence.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'VERY', 'INTERESTING', 'BUT', 'LIMITED', 'ESSENTIALLY', 'TO', 'ATHENSThe', 'renaissance', 'followed', 'Socrates', 'death', 'not', 'fully', 'examined', 'be', 'core', 'entire', 'film', 'do', 'feel', 'little', 'let-down', 'fleshing', 'enlightened', 'age', 'ushered', 'was', 'not', 'delved', 'also', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'other', 'City-States', 'Greece', 'rather', 'occasional', 'passing', 'reference', 'pertained', 'life', 'Athens.Though', 'not', 'faults', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'compelling', 'video', 'view', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'early', 'Greek', 'civilization', 'ancient', 'history', 'general']",The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization VHS

547758,AOPPHDPD830VJ,B00004R8UQ,"Holy Olio ""holy_olio""","[49, 58]","As noted by a number of reviewers, this DVD should have been called ""The Athenians"".  The program suffers from a lack of detail despite its narrow focus.The program uses shots of (I guess) live models standing stock still, in order to provide some kind of image of various characters from Athenian history who are profiled.  The classical Athenians are portrayed as backstabbing turncoats, but still, the characters come and go for the most part without any kind of before and after history.  Socrates is an exception, but literally everyone knows that story already, so no new ground is covered.Themistocles, the genius behind Athens' naval victory over the Persians, was ""ostracized"" after his success -- a sign that the ""democracy"" of Athens was really just another fascist oligarchy -- and eventually wound up living in honor among his former enemies, the Persians.  His ostracism is mentioned, but his ultimate fate in the Persian Empire is not.  It would have taken an additional five or ten seconds.The same can be said about the actions of another estranged Athenian, one who gave Sparta the key to success against Athens.  Perhaps another ten or twenty seconds would have sufficed.At one point during the war, Sparta sued for peace.  The ""democratic"" government of Athens refused to parley.  And as it imposed more and more tribute on the so-called Delian League, more and more of the tributary towns dumped Athens or even jumped to the Spartan side.The ""democracy"" existed just long enough to start a major war with a view to a swift victory, then turn down the victory, and even widen the war, suffering a major defeat in the process, and eventually losing everything.We see almost nothing regarding other Greek cities, even Sparta, the city on which Athens made war.  The pretext for the war arose from something else entirely, and was the result of something Sparta did (as well as its political system), but this is not discussed in the video.The video ""The Spartans"" [B0000C508X] deals strictly with the Greek city of Sparta, with an entire ""episode"" on the Peloponnesian War.  Despite its focus on a single city, ""The Spartans"" does a better job of giving a real picture of life and politics in classical Greece.  If you get ""The Greeks"", be sure to get ""The Spartans"" in order to see more of the picture, including important details of their struggle with Athens that are omitted from ""The Greeks"".I do not agree that there was a lot to Sparta.  It wasn't a sophisticated place at all.  Besides the oppressive social structure, the mandatory buggery, the racism / elitism, the eugenics program, the enslavement of its neighbors for centuries, the employment of women as baby machines, and its defeat of Athens, followed by its defeat at the hands of its neighbor, there's little to know about Sparta.  But boy, what an interesting and frightening story.The Persians dealt piecemeal with the Greeks as much as possible.  That strategy worked in Anatolia and elsewhere.  The Greek city-states managed some major defeats of the Persians alone or by alliances, but on the other hand savaged each other using the Persians either as a pretext (the Delian League) or as an ally (Sparta, in the denouement of the Peloponnesian War).  None of this is explained in the DVD, and again, it wouldn't have added significantly to the length.""The Greeks"" is a little on the repetitive side, and heavy on irrelevant modern graphics, possibly because it was intended for school aged viewers.  The narrator's voice comes off as a little pompous in my opinion, and the soundtrack is ponderous.  It's worth having around as an introduction to the city of Athens, provided this isn't the only thing in your video library.

547760,A1LVHR5OO45L5V,B00004R8UQ,JAG 2.0,"[0, 0]","As part of the ""Empires"" series, this DVD, ""The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization"" tells the story of Hellas as the classical Greeks called their land.The DVD focuses on four men and the eras they represented. Beginning with Cleisthenes, who is viewed as the ""father"" of Greek democracy, the video tells the story of how the small farming village began and how it evolved into a democracy. It does tell the story of the tyrants and rebellion against Athens' early rulers and the part played by Cleisthenes who, though he was a nobleman, chose to side with the common freeman and develop the system of government that was the forerunner of all democracies.The video then turns a spotlight on Themistocles and the struggle against the mighty Persian empire. The video tells of the first incursion culminating in the battle of Marathon - a signal victory for the Hellenes. It shows the part played by Themistocles in the preparation for the coming, larger struggle with Persia which Themistocles correctly foresaw. Covers the battle of Salamis where the fruits of Themistocles' preparations for war ripened in the form of an effective navy of triremes that formed the core of Greek strength at sea.The DVD then moves on to the parallel lives of two men: Pericles and Socrates. Pericles was the noble who convinced Athenians to create the great works of art and architecture which showed that Athens was an up-and-coming player on the world stage as well as his decision to make war on Sparta and her allies. Socrates, living at the same time, was the rational, logical examiner of everything he saw. The DVD introduces the viewer to some of the Greek advancements in science and mathematics which would form the core of western ideals on science and logical thought.The DVD does deal with Athens' decline and defeat in the Peloponnesian war. It examines some of the mistakes made by Athenian leadership and how the Sicilian venture sealed their fate.Though this is generally a good video, I have some very sharp criticisms. Firstly, the video tells that before the battle of Marathon, Athens had sought help from Sparta only to be refused. This is wrong! The Spartans told the Athenians that they would come to their aid when their religion permitted them to march. As a point of fact, the Spartan army reached Athens the day after the battle after force marching 140 miles in only three days - an amazing feat for the time.Secondly, Pericles gets off pretty easy for his imperial ambitions for Athens and championing making war on Sparta. Not only was it hubris, but it was an offensive act of an ""imperial"" leader interested in glory and empire. This is the antithesis of the democracy that fights for homeland and people. He was the one who convinced Athenians to abandon their farms and homes to ""hide"" behind their impenetrable walls of the city thus making them dangerously crowded - just the conditions for plague and disease to run rife. If the Athenians had fought the Spartans on their own soil - even in a defeat - the Spartans would not have imposed the harsh peace that they later did impose after years of war and destruction when attitudes could only harden toward an enemy.Thirdly, the DVD focuses entirely on Athens, rather than the Classical Greek civilization, politics and culture in general. The many contributions in these areas by other city-states are ignored completely. The Spartans, with their radically different culture, could have been the counterpoint to the culture of other Greeks, Athenians as well as others.In short, I think this DVD is well-made, richly filmed with good re-enactments and cinematography but missing the boat on many points of fact.

547764,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00004R8UQ,magellan,"[4, 6]","As much as I respect PBS for their many quality programs, this video isn't one of them. I agree with a couple of previous writers here that the information density is very low, with many inexplicable omissions for anyone who knows anything about Greek history--and I don't claim to be an expert--but I know the basics. The educational level and intended audience of this video seems to be about junior high school level.For example, it's mentioned that Athens went to war with Syracuse one time, but no mention is made of really why; it was actually the completely wacko idea of the Greek general and traitor Alcibiades, one of the most colorful military commanders in all of Greek history, and even of the world, and yet no mention is made of that fact. Also, no mention is made of the fact that Athens was oddly enough attacking another democracy like themselves, not an oligarchical dictatorship like Sparta, with whom they had much more serious ideological issues. All that's said is that the Greeks invented politics and democracy and yet very little is actually said about important political and historical points like this.The philosopher Socrates gets a good deal of play, but most of that is describing how ugly he was! What about his philosophy and what he actually taught? Very little is said of that--just that he was the most famous philosopher ever. At least they could have mentioned that Socrates's philosophy marked the beginnings of the influential concept of humanism, that ""man is the measure of all things,"" and how that idea has influenced western civilization ever since. And no mention is made of his famous student Plato, without whose famous dialogs we would know almost nothing about Socrates.To give some credit, the trial of Socrates is described in some detail, and what he said in his defense, and how that offended the jury, who voted for his death. But very little is actually said of the accusations and charges that actually landed him in such trouble, which were ""...the corruption of the young, and making the worse seem the better cause..."" The only thing that's mentioned is Socrates's famous quote about being a social gadly and critic during the trial, which doesn't explain what the actual charges were and why he was such a threat to the establishment.I could go on, but I think you get the picture. There are a few useful tidbits of information, certainly, but as I and others have said, the signal to noise ratio is pretty low. I think the Greeks themselves would have given this one the thumbs down.For a better video on Greek history, check out the History Channel offerings, ""The Last Stand of the 300,"" and ""The Rise and Fall of the Spartans,"" etc. Not only are they better from an information standpoint, but the realistic battle re-enactments are truly impressive to watch. As a long time martial arts instructor who has taught Hollywood actors martial arts for their movies, I was impressed with the quality and realism of the action, given the many extras involved, and how long it takes to train people.

And then I saw this review:5.0 out of 5 stars Interesting both to me and my 10 years old son, December 22, 2013ByM. Kraeva &#34;Amazone&#34; (USA) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)This review is from: The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization (Amazon Instant Video)We watched this movie with my son, and he did not want to stop watching. The movie is well made. It explains what happened in Ancient Greece (about 500BC), in particular in Athens.I have posted on Youtube my critique of this insidious 3 part series (search &#34;The Greeks critique&#34; & you'll find them, by 'Jackie TwoSticks')The creators of The Greeks were looking into the future, to the young people whose parents or teachers wanting to their kids to learn about ancient Greece. The production is VERY handsome and slick, and easy to understand.But it is a character assassination of Socrates, the Persians, and the arts. The treatment of Socrates is masterful: he is one of the greatest minds ever, the documentary tells us, but the script makes a mockery of Socrates mind and thought, setting him in a &#34;drunken dinner party&#34; and as the voice over tells of his greatness the visuals linger on spilled wine, bones from the meal and assorted garbage.I spent many many hours looking at this and doing research. What surprised me most was seeing that the documentary was deeply enmeshed with several members and affiliates of the Project for a New American Century (PNAC). This group of &#34;neo-cons&#34; were, when the documentary was filming, hoping for a &#34;new Pearl Harbor&#34; (their language) and were already planning the wars of the 21st century: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and ... IRAN! Wow.So this handsome, 3 part documentary was a nice vehicle to further their poisonous ideas, and I'm sure it was in their clever minds to look down the road, to the young people of the future, and how those young minds could be nudged into, or receive confirmation of several important ideas that fuels the Empire: the no-class status of women/prostitutes; the value and glory of war especially against tyrants like the Persians; the very over-rated value of the mind: the real message is that Socrates (and all 'thinkers') are ugly, ridiculous idiots, and the arts, too, are ridiculous, little better than modern slasher movies. Even the Parthenon is limned as fine but a huge burden on taxpayers and for what? To glorify a heathen goddess who is not much different than a prostitute.My capsule summary may sound a tad overblown but if you take the trouble to view the critique you'll see that my reasoning and analysis is sound, and you'll educate yourself in the tricks of the propaganda trade.",1,Subtle propaganda,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,2763,"['was', 'busy', 'just', 'now', 'project', 'needed', 'check', 'date', 'Greeks', 'was', 'produced', 'then', 'saw', '5', 'stars', 'Interesting', '10', 'years', 'old', 'son', 'December', '22', '2013ByM', 'Kraeva', '34', 'Amazone', '34', 'USA', 'See', 'reviews', 'REAL', 'NAME', 'review', 'Greeks', 'Crucible', 'Civilization', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'watched', 'movie', 'son', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'stop', 'watching', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'what', 'happened', 'Ancient', 'Greece', '500BC', 'particular', 'Athens.I', 'have', 'posted', 'Youtube', 'critique', 'insidious', '3', 'part', 'series', 'search', '34', 'Greeks', 'critique', '34', ""'ll"", 'find', 'TwoSticks', 'creators', 'Greeks', 'were', 'looking', 'future', 'young', 'people', 'parents', 'teachers', 'wanting', 'kids', 'learn', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'production', 'VERY', 'handsome', 'slick', 'easy', 'understand.But', 'character', 'assassination', 'Socrates', 'Persians', 'arts', 'treatment', 'Socrates', 'masterful', 'one', 'greatest', 'minds', 'ever', 'documentary', 'script', 'mockery', 'Socrates', 'mind', 'thought', 'setting', '34', 'drunken', 'dinner', 'party', '34', 'voice', 'tells', 'greatness', 'visuals', 'linger', 'spilled', 'wine', 'bones', 'meal', 'assorted', 'garbage.I', 'spent', 'many', 'many', 'hours', 'looking', 'doing', 'research', 'What', 'surprised', 'most', 'was', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'was', 'deeply', 'enmeshed', 'several', 'members', 'affiliates', 'Project', 'New', 'American', 'Century', 'PNAC', 'group', '34', 'neo-cons', '34', 'were', 'when', 'documentary', 'was', 'filming', 'hoping', '34', 'new', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', '34', 'language', 'were', 'already', 'planning', 'wars', '21st', 'century', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'Libya', 'Syria', 'IRAN', 'Wow.So', 'handsome', '3', 'part', 'documentary', 'was', 'nice', 'vehicle', 'further', 'poisonous', 'ideas', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'clever', 'look', 'down', 'road', 'young', 'people', 'future', 'how', 'young', 'minds', 'could', 'be', 'nudged', 'receive', 'confirmation', 'several', 'important', 'ideas', 'fuels', 'Empire', 'no-class', 'status', 'women/prostitutes', 'value', 'glory', 'war', 'especially', 'tyrants', 'Persians', 'very', 'over-rated', 'value', 'mind', 'real', 'message', 'Socrates', ""'thinkers"", 'are', 'ugly', 'ridiculous', 'idiots', 'arts', 'too', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'little', 'better', 'modern', 'slasher', 'movies', 'Even', 'Parthenon', 'limned', 'fine', 'huge', 'burden', 'taxpayers', 'what', 'glorify', 'heathen', 'goddess', 'who', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'prostitute.My', 'capsule', 'summary', 'may', 'sound', 'tad', 'overblown', 'take', 'trouble', 'view', 'critique', ""'ll"", 'see', 'reasoning', 'analysis', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'educate', 'tricks', 'propaganda', 'trade']",The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization VHS

And as others have pointed out, it tries to include all of Greece, while in fact staying fairly close to Athens.  I was also less than thrilled with the fact that when discussing one of their selected &quot;great men&quot; of Greece, the camera zooms in and holds on an actor standing like a living statue.

To be more precise, this is not a documentary on Greek history but Athenian history.  It presents Athenian history in a very favorable light, one I'm sure that a Greek historian would take issue with. While glorifying Athenian democracy, it does not mention that this democracy was a dictatorship to those surrounding city-states. Sparta is presented in a stereotypical war society with no depth or character and Argos is the only other mentioned city. I can understand that in 165 minutes not every aspect can be covered, but the glorified Athenian view was a little thick.I also felt this presentation lacked the fullness that it could have had. Taking into consideration that this was made in 2000, it still lacked a depth of digital recreation. It also did not fully exploit dramatic recreation. Instead, it relies upon storytelling while panning to a single shot of a stationary dressed up actor covered in some strange gold-like substance.What was positive about this presentation was Liam Neeson's narration.

As a student of Greek and Roman history, philosophy and culture, this presentation came off to me as laughable. Don't get me wrong, a few hours is understandably a short period of time to review essentially Athenian culture/history (this is not really about Greece, or Hellenistic culture--just Athens). If man is the measure of all things...this documentary is the measure of a very few things, and not quite adequately either...However, along with the insane lack of substance and actual information (covered in other reviews) -- the focus of the presentation is limited and slanted to a populist, post-modernist approach to history. Very careful words are chosen to show us why this ahem...""democracy""...was quite wonderful...and laid the groundwork for the wonderful ideas to come...except that this was a dictatorship, at best based on Mob Rule + Elite Rule. As a foundation for a Republic with enshrined individual rights, Greece is the great beginning...but that's not the focus here.The biggest laugh I had was essentially attributing Socrates, not as a precursor, but as THE Father of Reason. Sorry but Socrates is the father of Modern (not ancient) Skepticism and a lot of other lousy ideas that if put into practice, would have made this dvd impossible. And Aristotle??? Haha -- the film says that he studied what? Zoology and Biology? Oh, true of course. They cover him for about 8 seconds. But the insane lack of focus on the most important thinker in our whole of human history...not even a segment on him??? Insane. Yes, it's like as if someone from a historical revisionist society decided to root their political philosophy in Ancient Athens and created a little fable, leaving out history, people, ideas, etc.--to make their truth conform to reality. Why would that be? What does Aristotle represent to modern scholars? Hmmmm. Kind of easy to figure that out...sadly.There is a subtle and not so subtle slant to this whole presentation, with its moving music, unnecessary close-ups of half naked actors (enlarged pores and all), that aims to undermine the actual ""heroic"" achievement of the Greeks that it purports to highlight. That achievement is the concept of the Rational, Heroic, Political INDIVIDUAL. The modern man. The modern world. The West. Not based on Mob Rule. Not based on questioning everything. Not based on Group Rights or as Hitler or Stalin might put it...the Volk or ""the people"". The Greeks were at their best ""individualists"". But modern scholars take aim at the individual, and focus instead on what they wished ruled the world...the un-thinking masses...History my friends...History...not Man.If you know nothing of the ancient world, and the TV is your primary educator, or if you enjoy modern Marxist interpretations of facts through the lens of ""the people"", you will enjoy this presentation. If on the other hand, you have a working brain and know that the entire presentation could not have existed without the very ideas/facts/history that it leaves out, you will walk away annoyed and disappointed.But at least I learned that Socrates was ugly.

It is appropriate to have covered the contributions of Pericles and Themistocles to ancient Athens but what we really admire about ancient Greece isn't the military glory (the Tartars and Attila the Hun could have taught them a thing or two !)___rather it is in the dramas of Sophocles &amp; Euripedes ,in the spiralling mysticism of Plato , the iridescent rationalism of Aristotle and the sublime majesty of Phidias's as manifested on the Parthenon frieze. It is in the intellectual and artistic realm that no civilisation ,before or since, can hold a candle to the ancient Greeks and the glaring deficiency of this documentary lies in giving short shrift to this aspect of the ancient Greek civilisation .I would have given it five stars but for this omission .",4,Worthy effort but leaves a lot to be desired,980035200,"01 21, 2001",2001,1468,"['two', 'half', 'hour', 'documentary', 'impressive', 'effort', 'part', 'PBS', 'give', 'viewer', 'glimpse', 'glory', 'was', 'ancient', 'Greece', '.It', 'good', 'job', 'covering', 'facets', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'cover', 'battles', 'Marathon', 'Salamis', 'Paleponnesian', 'war', 'fairly', 'detailed', 'vignettes', 'statesmen', 'amp', 'generals', 'Cleisthenes', 'Themistocles', 'Pericles', 'etc', 'glaring', 'weakness', 'documentary', 'WHAT', 'IT', 'OUT', '.After', 'enduring', 'legacy', 'Athens', 'western', 'civilisation', 'not', 'wars', 'fought', 'wealth', 'accumulated', 'treasure', 'trove', 'philosophy', 'democracy', 'drama', 'poetry', 'sculpture', 'left', 'behind', 'appropriate', 'have', 'covered', 'contributions', 'Pericles', 'Themistocles', 'ancient', 'Athens', 'what', 'really', 'admire', 'ancient', 'Greece', ""n't"", 'military', 'glory', 'Tartars', 'Attila', 'Hun', 'could', 'have', 'taught', 'thing', 'two', 'dramas', 'Sophocles', 'amp', 'Euripedes', 'spiralling', 'mysticism', 'Plato', 'iridescent', 'rationalism', 'Aristotle', 'sublime', 'majesty', 'Phidias', 'manifested', 'Parthenon', 'frieze', 'intellectual', 'artistic', 'realm', 'civilisation', 'can', 'hold', 'candle', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'glaring', 'deficiency', 'documentary', 'giving', 'short', 'shrift', 'aspect', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'civilisation', '.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'omission']",The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization VHS
