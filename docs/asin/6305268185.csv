457245,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305268185,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Growing up on live action dog films was one of the highlights of my childhood.  Films like &#8216;Old Yeller&#8217;, &#8216;Milo & Otis&#8217; and &#8216;Benji&#8217; were on constant rotation in my house, namely because my father loved dogs and so he was always in the mood to watch them with me.  &#8216;Benji&#8217; is one of those films that appealed to me I think more as a child than it does to me as an adult (whereas &#8216;Old Yeller&#8217; is the type of film that has continued to grow with me into adulthood) but there is no denying the impact that this furry little canine had on me then and the nostalgia of it all still gets me today.  The themes here are surprisingly fleshed out really well, and the action, which is centered on Benji and shot from his perspective, is remarkably focused.  I think director Joe Camp deserves a heap of praise for not only working so well with an animal, but for never compromising his vision because it may have been easier to do so.  I&#8217;m always fascinated with directors can get so much out of animals, and Camp&#8217;s direction is truly what anchors this beloved family film.",4,Growing up Benji&#8230;,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,1134,"['Growing', 'up', 'live', 'action', 'dog', 'films', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'childhood', 'Films', '8216', 'Old', 'Yeller', '8217', '8216', 'Milo', 'Otis', '8217', '8216', 'Benji', '8217', 'were', 'constant', 'rotation', 'house', 'namely', 'father', 'loved', 'dogs', 'so', 'was', 'always', 'mood', 'watch', '8216', 'Benji', '8217', 'one', 'films', 'appealed', 'think', 'more', 'child', 'adult', 'whereas', '8216', 'Old', 'Yeller', '8217', 'type', 'film', 'continued', 'grow', 'adulthood', 'denying', 'impact', 'furry', 'little', 'canine', 'had', 'then', 'nostalgia', 'still', 'today', 'themes', 'here', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'really', 'well', 'action', 'centered', 'Benji', 'shot', 'perspective', 'remarkably', 'focused', 'think', 'director', 'Joe', 'Camp', 'heap', 'praise', 'not', 'only', 'working', 'so', 'well', 'animal', 'never', 'compromising', 'vision', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'easier', 'do', 'so', '8217', 'always', 'fascinated', 'directors', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'animals', 'Camp', '8217', 's', 'direction', 'truly', 'what', 'beloved', 'family', 'film']",N/A

457252,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305268185,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[46, 49]","I have wanted to review this 1973 family classic for a very long time now, but it has been extraordinarily difficult to review something and someone who was a truly vital part of my childhood.  Some of my earliest memories are of this loveable little dog.  When the 25th anniversary edition of the film came out in 1998, I finally had the chance to reacquaint myself with my dear old friend, and it was a truly moving experience.  All these years later, Benji remains the ultimate family movie experience.  It can be quite a sad and touching experience, as well, and my emotional attachment to it has kept me from reviewing it for far too long already.  The children (and adults) of every generation need to be acquainted with this film; Benji is the great American dog who has rightly been called America's Most Huggable Hero.  I absolutely treasure this film from my childhood, and I want all children to feel the love this movie expresses and epitomizes.The story of this movie is almost as extraordinary as the film itself.  Everybody laughed at Joe Camp when he described the movie he wanted to make.  This man who had never even made a movie or worked with animals before was committed to writing, producing, and directing a film told from the viewpoint of a dog.  There would be no dubbed voices telling the audience what the dog was thinking; the dog himself would communicate his feelings through his demeanor and facial expressions.  Even Frank Inn, Benji's owner, thought the idea was crazy when Camp came to him looking for a dog who could act.  It just so happened, though, that Camp spotted Benji and immediately knew he had found his star.  Benji was already an older dog who had retired from a distinguished seven-year career on the television show Petticoat Junction.  Frank Inn, the man who had rescued Benji from the pound many years earlier, didn't know it, but Benji's greatest performance was yet to come.In a way, the story of the movie is rather simple.  Benji is a stray who is loved by folks all over the neighborhood, yet the place he calls home is a lonely, abandoned house.  Every day, he follows the same routine: he first heads to the Chapman house to be fed and loved by young Cindy and Paul (whose father will not allow them to keep a stray dog), then he is off to chase a neighboring cat (whose owner is played by Frances ""Aunt Bee"" Bavier), wake up old Bill (Petticoat Junction buddy Edgar Buchanan) at the caf&eacute;, entertain a police officer, and rummage for food in the park.  One special day, Benji meets a cute little white dog in the park, and the two of them become inseparable.  Then disaster strikes; Benji's home is invaded by strangers who kidnap Cindy and Paul and hold them hostage there.  Benji goes all over town trying to tell his human friends where the children are, but no one will listen to him.  If he is to save the children he loves as well as his new friend Tiffany, he is going to have to come up with a way to make the humans understand him.The last twenty minutes of this film are among the most powerful cinematic moments I have ever witnessed.  Benji turns in one of the greatest performances of all time.  Laugh if you will, but I consider Benji's performance one of the ten greatest performances of all time - that includes human as well as animal actors.  Two scenes in particular reveal the depth of Benji's acting skills.  I cannot describe what happens here without giving away important plot details, but it sends tears pouring down my cheeks no matter how many times I watch it.  You can literally read Benji's thought process and intense emotions on his face.  While it may not be manly to admit, I actually sob during these climactic scenes.  To be honest, I cry many times throughout this movie.  I am one of those people who love animals more than people, really, and I can't stand to see an animal sad or hurt.  Benji's loneliness at the beginning of the movie touches me deeply, and his joyful relationship with his new little friend Tiffany moves me beyond words.  The later scenes, though, include one traumatic moment that almost breaks my heart when it happens.Obviously, I could sing praises to Benji all day.  This is one of the greatest movies of all time; there really is no other movie like it.  Joe Camp succeeded fabulously in telling this story from Benji's point of view.  Even the most minor human characters express feelings that go far beyond mere words, and the music, while certainly evocative of the early 1970s era, complements and intensifies every scene perfectly.  (The theme song I Feel the Love, sung by Charlie Rich, won a Golden Globe award and was nominated for an Academy Award.)  In closing, I must mention the fact that Benji was as much a hero in real life as he was in this feature film.  This vintage American ""mutt"" whom Frank Inn rescued from an animal shelter as a puppy really left an impressive mark on this world.  He and owner Frank Inn literally toured the world, bringing joy to untold numbers of children.  More importantly, he indirectly saved the lives of thousands of dogs waiting and hoping to be adopted from animal shelters.  I love Benji as if he were my very own dog; he was a ray of sunlight in my childhood and he remains a true hero to me still.  I dearly hope that today's children can get to know and love this dog and this movie as much as I do.",5,The greatest family movie of all time,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,5384,"['have', 'wanted',

So said Cosmopolitain magazine, and a number or Amazon reviewers, including one who made this film out to be Oscar worthy.  A true masterpiece ?  I'm sorry, people, but you are nuts. And no, I'm not going to criticize it for the production values - that would be too easy.  A good film can survive a low budget.  This is just not a good film.Yes, the dog is amazing.  Smarter than any dog I've ever seen, for sure.  And cute.  But that's it.  Most of the movie consists of Benji running around.  The music is straight from seventies porn.  The acting is atrocious.  There is a scene where a little dog gets kicked so hard we are led to believe it is dead.  And Benji keeps flashing back to this scene and other violent scenes.  The kids are kidnapped and gagged, and it's not funny like in No Deposit No Return, it's just creepy.  Of course in the end everything turns out fine, like you knew it would.  Although I heard the dog was depressed and wouldn't eat for weeks after seeing the opening night show at Grumman's.The only reason I give it two stars is for the dog - if you could mute out all the talking and just watch the dog, it might be ok for about a 30 minute edited version.  Just goes to show what passed for film in the early seventies.As for the reviewers who mentioned Christopher Walken and John Mellencamp - you did not see the same movie we are discussing (Benji).Recommended only for people who are really into little dogs and could watch them for hours.

457260,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6305268185,James D. Leverton,"[1, 1]","Joe Camp's ""Benji"" (1974) is a classic in the truest sense of the word.  Starring one of the most incredibly expressive canine actors of all time, ""Benji"" is a wonderful family film for kids (and adults) of all ages.  In fact, it is hard to imagine anyone not liking this timeless film.The Benji of the title is a stray dog who has seemingly been adopted by everyone in the small town in which he resides.  In the extended opening sequence, Benji makes his morning rounds, where he greets all his human friends, each of whom have a different name for him.  But it is obvious his heart belongs to the Chapman children, Paul and Cindy (Allen Fiuzat and Cynthia Smith), and their housekeeper Mary (Patsy Garrett).  Unfortunately, their father, Dr. Chapman (Peter Breck), won't allow them to keep him.  Still, Benji has a full and carefree life with all his friends, and even takes care of and romances a lost female pooch he finds one day.  Then things take a turn for the worse when kidnappers show up in the old, abandoned house he calls home.  And who should they have kidnapped, but Benji's beloved Paul and Cindy, and it's not long before Benji realizes it's up to him to save the day.What makes ""Benji"" work so well is that the dog who plays Benji (Higgins) is so expressive he is seemingly able to convey thought, so there is no need for any corny voice over work for the audience to understand exactly what Benji is up to at any time during the movie.  Also, Camp films the vast majority of the film from Benji's viewpoint, so the audience actually sees and understands everything as Benji would.  It doesn't hurt that the darned dog is so adorable and easy to root for.  He is given able support by his human costars, whose performances are uneven but perfectly suitable for the proceedings.But then again, it's useless to even discuss performance or production values in a film like this.  The important thing is will it entertain children and the answer is a resounding ""yes!""  Better yet, unlike much of the dreck that passes as children's fare these days (with the exception of the ""Shrek"" films and the Pixar stuff) adults will be as entertained as their children.  And even though things take a sinister turn and one of the kidnappers is a sadistic, dog-kicking creep, there is nothing here that is unsuitable for even the youngest child, and parents can rest assured that everything ends happily.If ever a film deserved a possessive credit, then it's Joe Camp's ""Benji,"" since Camp wrote, produced, directed and practically released it on his own since in 1974 no studio in Hollywood would release it.  Therefore, Camp deserves all the credit for creating one of the best family films of the past thirty years, with an invaluable assist by Higgins' trainer, the remarkable Frank Inn.  Both men became minor celebrities after the release of ""Benji,"" and followed it up with a less successful, but still entertaining, sequel named ""For the Love of Benji"" that takes place in Greece.  And ""Benji"" even can be called an ""Academy Award Nominee"" in that it's bouncy theme song, ""I Feel Love"", sung by Charlie Rich, was nominated for a Best Song Oscar.In all, you cannot go wrong with ""Benji.""  It appears to have been re-released on DVD thanks to the new ""Benji"" movie that opened a couple of weeks ago.  This is good news since it is very hard to find, so snatch it up while you have a chance.  Even though there are no extras and only fullscreen versions available (why oh why?), its picture and sound quality are stellar and it ranks as a good buy regardless.  Your kids will love you for it. **** (out of *****)",4,Wonderful family film for kids of all ages.,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,3622,"['Joe', 'Camp', 'Benji', '1974', 'classic', 'truest', 'sense', 'word', 'Starring', 'one', 'most', 'incredibly', 'expressive', 'canine', 'actors', 'time', 'Benji', 'wonderful', 'family', 'film', 'kids', 'adults', 'ages', 'fact', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'not', 'liking', 'timeless', 'film.The', 'Benji', 'title', 'stray', 'dog', 'who', 'seemingly', 'been', 'adopted', 'everyone', 'small', 'town', 'extended', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Benji', 'morning', 'rounds', 'where', 'human', 'friends', 'whom', 'have', 'different', 'name', 'obvious', 'heart', 'Chapman', 'children', 'Paul', 'Cindy', 'Allen', 'Fiuzat', 'Cynthia', 'Smith', 'housekeeper', 'Mary', 'Patsy', 'Garrett', 'Unfortunately', 'father', 'Dr.', 'Chapman', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'keep', 'Still', 'Benji', 'full', 'carefree', 'life', 'friends', 'even', 'care', 'romances', 'lost', 'female', 'pooch', 'one', 'day', 'Then', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'kidnappers', 'show', 'up', 'old', 'abandoned', 'house', 'home', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'Benji', 'beloved', 'Paul', 'Cindy', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'Benji', 'up', 'save', 'day.What', 'Benji', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'dog', 'who', 'Benji', 'Higgins', 'so', 'expressive', 'seemingly', 'able', 'convey', 'thought', 'need', 'corny', 'voice', 'work', 'audience', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'Benji', 'up', 'time', 'movie', 'Also', 'Camp', 'films', 'vast', 'majority', 'film', 'Benji', 'viewpoint', 'audience', 'actually', 'everything', 'Benji', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'darned', 'dog', 'so', 'adorable', 'easy', 'root', 'given', 'able', 'support', 'human', 'costars', 'performances', 'are', 'uneven', 'perfectly', 'suitable', 'proceedings.But', 'then', 'again', 'useless', 'even', 'discuss', 'performance', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'important', 'thing', 'will', 'entertain', 'children', 'answer', 'resounding', 'yes', 'Better', 'yet', 'much', 'dreck', 'children', 'fare', 'days', 'exception', 'Shrek', 'films', 'Pixar', 'stuff', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'entertained', 'children', 'even', 'things', 'take', 'sinister', 'turn', 'one', 'kidnappers', 'sadistic', 'dog-kicking', 'creep', 'nothing', 'here', 'unsuitable', 'even', 'youngest', 'child', 'parents', 'can', 'rest', 'assured', 'everything', 'happily.If', 'ever', 'film', 'deserved', 'possessive', 'credit', 'then', 'Joe', 'Camp', 'Benji', 'Camp', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'practically', 'released', 'own', '1974', 'studio', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'release', 'Therefore', 'Camp', 'credit', 'creating', 'one', 'best', 'family', 'films', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'invaluable', 'assist', 'Higgins', 'trainer', 'remarkable', 'Frank', 'Inn', 'men', 'became', 'minor', 'celebrities', 'release', 'Benji', 'followed', 'up', 'less', 'successful', 'still', 'entertaining', 'sequel', 'named', 'Love', 'Benji', 'place', 'Greece', 'Benji', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nominee', 'bouncy', 'theme', 'song', 'Feel', 'Love', 'sung', 'Charlie', 'Rich', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Song', 'Oscar.In', 'all', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'Benji', 'have', 'been', 're-released', 'DVD', 'thanks', 'new', 'Benji', 'movie', 'opened', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'good', 'news', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'so', 'snatch', 'up', 'have', 'chance', 'Even', 'are', 'extras', 'only', 'fullscreen', 'versions', 'available', 'why', 'oh', 'why', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'stellar', 'good', 'buy', 'regardless', 'kids', 'will', 'love', '****', '*****']",N/A

This was one of my favorite childhood movies (here i go on my dog movies again) and am now proud to own it on DVD. We rented it many times as kids, but it was older and hard to find on VHS. So glad Goodtimes has released it to DVD.If you haven't see it yet, this is a must see to add to your family movie list. While it obviously takes place in the 70's, it also meshes a small town feel of various styles and influences making an exact time period hard to pinpoint (a quality which i love about movies that gives them a timelessness.) Tho not specifically stated, with the kids relatively thick southern accents, among other things, it appears to take place in Texas. The movie was actually filmed in various locations in Texas. Both kids were in real life (surprise) actually from Texas.Adorable kids Paul and Cindy Chapman, of a widowed and doctor father, find love and support in kind housekeeper Mary and dog Benji. Benji finds plenty of adventures of his own with the lovable locals around a small town, and a girlfriend, a little toy dog whom he ends up protecting with his life.Meanwhile, a group of petty criminals, 3 guys and a gal, find a hideout in an old, abandoned house on the outskirts of town that's supposedly haunted. Becoming aware that Dr. Chapman's into ""money"", the group kidnap the two kids for a ransom. Can Benji save the day while protecting his girlfriend AND his two young masters?Look for a line up of much loved familiar faces with Frances Bavier  as the ""cat lady"" (Aunt Bee from Andy Griffith) Edgar Buchanan as the local diner owner (Uncle Joe from Petticoat Junction and Green Acres), Tom Lester as the unwilling member of the criminal crew (Eb from Green Acres and Uncle Jake from ""Gordy""), Deborah Walley as the criminal girlfriend, (Julia ""Pink of Perfection"" Carey from Summer Magic) and Herb Vigran as Lt. Samuels (with a mile long list of TV credits including the ""Oh, Please Mr."" man on the Brady Bunch episode where the kids collect trading stamps as well as I Love Lucy apperances.)The musical theme ""I Feel Love"" is sung by country music star Charlie Rich. A streetwise, bluesy theme is presented for Benji's adventures around town.I especially liked Patsy Garret's role as the motherly Mary, she does an excellent job and her performance is genuine. I can tell she'd be just as nice in real life as her portrayal of Mary.This is just a timeless movies that needs to be shared by young and old alike!! 5 Stars!!!",5,Benji!,1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,2529,"['Awww', 'what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'Benji', 'little', 'dog', 'will', 'melt', 'heart', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'movies', 'here', 'i', 'go', 'dog', 'movies', 'again', 'am', 'now', 'proud', 'own', 'DVD', 'rented', 'many', 'times', 'kids', 'was', 'older', 'hard', 'find', 'VHS', 'So', 'glad', 'Goodtimes', 'released', 'DVD.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'see', 'yet', 'must', 'see', 'add', 'family', 'movie', 'list', 'obviously', 'place', '70', 'also', 'small', 'town', 'feel', 'various', 'styles', 'influences', 'making', 'exact', 'time', 'period', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'quality', 'love', 'movies', 'timelessness', 'Tho', 'not', 'specifically', 'stated', 'kids', 'relatively', 'thick', 'southern', 'accents', 'other', 'things', 'take', 'place', 'Texas', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'various', 'locations', 'Texas', 'kids', 'were', 'real', 'life', 'surprise', 'actually', 'Texas.Adorable', 'kids', 'Paul', 'Cindy', 'Chapman', 'widowed', 'doctor', 'father', 'find', 'love', 'support', 'kind', 'housekeeper', 'Mary', 'dog', 'Benji', 'Benji', 'plenty', 'adventures', 'own', 'lovable', 'locals', 'small', 'town', 'girlfriend', 'little', 'toy', 'dog', 'whom', 'up', 'protecting', 'life.Meanwhile', 'group', 'petty', 'criminals', '3', 'guys', 'gal', 'find', 'hideout', 'old', 'abandoned', 'house', 'outskirts', 'town', 'supposedly', 'haunted', 'Becoming', 'aware', 'Dr.', 'Chapman', 'money', 'group', 'kidnap', 'two', 'kids', 'ransom', 'Can', 'Benji', 'save', 'day', 'protecting', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'young', 'masters', 'Look', 'line', 'much', 'loved', 'familiar', 'Frances', 'Bavier', 'cat', 'lady', 'Aunt', 'Bee', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'local', 'diner', 'owner', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'Petticoat', 'Junction', 'Green', 'Acres', 'Tom', 'Lester', 'unwilling', 'member', 'criminal', 'crew', 'Eb', 'Green', 'Acres', 'Uncle', 'Jake', 'Gordy', 'Deborah', 'Walley', 'criminal', 'girlfriend', 'Julia', 'Pink', 'Perfection', 'Carey', 'Summer', 'Magic', 'Herb', 'Vigran', 'Lt.', 'Samuels', 'mile', 'long', 'list', 'TV', 'credits', 'including', 'Oh', 'Please', 'Mr.', 'man', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'episode', 'where', 'kids', 'collect', 'trading', 'stamps', 'as', 'well', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'apperances', 'musical', 'theme', 'Feel', 'Love', 'sung', 'country', 'music', 'star', 'Charlie', 'Rich', 'A', 'streetwise', 'bluesy', 'theme', 'presented', 'Benji', 'adventures', 'town.I', 'especially', 'liked', 'Patsy', 'Garret', 'role', 'motherly', 'Mary', 'excellent', 'job', 'performance', 'genuine', 'can', 'tell', ""'d"", 'be', 'just', 'nice', 'real', 'life', 'portrayal', 'Mary.This', 'just', 'timeless', 'movies', 'be', 'shared', 'young', 'old', 'alike', '5', 'Stars']",N/A

Benji himself is from that show as well. And to think dreamy Peter Breck, Nick Barkley from The Big Valley, played the father of two children who wanted to keep Benji but whose father said no. Two adorable children had been feeding Benji under the table with the help of the housekeeper splendidly played by Patsy Garretty. Enter a pampered pooch, a lovely Maltese the housekeeper named Tiffany, and you have romance in the air. My trouble was the movie was geared toward a younger crowd so at times it was a pit silly, but the acting both of humans and canines was top-notch. Oh, and there was a neighborhood cat who was chased up a tree by Benji, much to her owner's indignation. But when the dog turned up missing, she was upset her pussy was being ignored.
