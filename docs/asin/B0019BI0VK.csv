A friend of mine had given Little Einstein rave reviews so we ordered this set for our nearly three year old and she really likes them.  She couldn't go along with the interactive parts (asking the viewers questions or having them clap or raise their arms)but seems to enjoy watching it none the less.  The longer episodes (like Firebird's resuce) gets a little boring, they must have been scraping bottom for content.  I do love the classic music changed into kids songs and the use of art in the background.  The music does get stuck in your head and is usually the more annoying ones.  My husband and I like to watch these less than Disney Classic movies but it's a nice change of pace for our older daughter.",4,Great for Little Einstein and Baby Einstein fans,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,811,"['were', 'transition', 'one', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'movies', 'kids', 'watch', 'friend', 'mine', 'had', 'given', 'Little', 'Einstein', 'rave', 'reviews', 'ordered', 'set', 'nearly', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'along', 'interactive', 'parts', 'asking', 'viewers', 'questions', 'having', 'clap', 'raise', 'arms', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'none', 'less', 'longer', 'episodes', 'Firebird', 'resuce', 'little', 'boring', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'scraping', 'bottom', 'content', 'do', 'love', 'classic', 'music', 'changed', 'kids', 'songs', 'use', 'art', 'background', 'music', 'get', 'stuck', 'head', 'usually', 'more', 'annoying', 'ones', 'husband', 'like', 'watch', 'less', 'Disney', 'Classic', 'movies', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'older', 'daughter']",Disney Little Einsteins Fall 20 3-Pack: My Favorite Adventures Collection

1162810,AX1Z5RQ1LWMM2,B0019BI0VK,j-rob-82,"[1, 1]",My kids aren't the most patient but they can set through Little Einsteins which is great.  My three year old is autistic and we see her repeating some of the things they do that require interaction.  Its kind of like Dora with the amount of interaction which is very nice to have.  She can't speak back to them when they speak to her but if she could talk I know she would.  My other daughter loves all three episodes as well and being almost two we find her interaction and talking back refreshing.  I know if my kids were doing this review they would give it five stars.  I personally am glad I made this purchase of the three pack to see my kids enjoy them all the way through.,5,My Kids Set Through It,1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,680,"['kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'most', 'patient', 'can', 'set', 'through', 'Little', 'Einsteins', 'great', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'autistic', 'see', 'repeating', 'things', 'do', 'require', 'interaction', 'kind', 'Dora', 'amount', 'interaction', 'very', 'nice', 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'back', 'when', 'speak', 'could', 'talk', 'know', 'would', 'My', 'other', 'daughter', 'three', 'episodes', 'well', 'being', 'almost', 'two', 'find', 'interaction', 'talking', 'back', 'refreshing', 'know', 'kids', 'were', 'doing', 'review', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'personally', 'am', 'glad', 'made', 'purchase', 'three', 'pack', 'see', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'way']",Disney Little Einsteins Fall 20 3-Pack: My Favorite Adventures Collection
