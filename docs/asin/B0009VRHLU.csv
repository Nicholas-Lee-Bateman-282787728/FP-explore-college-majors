Ryan ""Merribelle""","[12, 28]","Normally, if a comedian gets a whiff of early success, he can't seem to stop himself from milking it for all it's worth, ad nauseum.  Dave Chappelle, on the other hand, is that rarity in showbiz that doesn't seem interested in outproducing the demand for his material.  The unfortunate results of that are what we see in For What It's Worth, which I believe to be a desperate attempt by DCS Inc. to feed Dave's comedy-starved fans anything they can get their hands on.I am one of those comedy-starved fans.  After seeing this dvd, I am starting to lose hope that Dave will ever be back to favor us with top new material.As usual, Dave is comfortable and uninhibited in front of his live audience.  There are some laugh out loud moments here.  There are also plenty of long stretches without a chuckle. Mostly I sat squirming just a bit as I waited for the next LOL moment. Yes I know it's hard to believe, but Dave's typical genius failed many times.  It may have been due to his choice of subjects; among other things,  Michael Jackson molesting kids, how to seduce a monkey,  and Kobe Bryant. Even the great DC was unable to wring humor out of that stuff.  Then again, if all that sounds hilarious to you I stand corrected.The lone special feature of ""left of center - mini-moments with Dave"" was an unremarkable series of outtakes from his practice session, filmed left of center.  Pass.Don't waste your money buying this Dvd, but it might be worth a rental if you're really hard up next Friday night.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",3,Please come back Dave....we really miss you...,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,1527,"['Normally', 'comedian', 'whiff', 'early', 'success', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'stop', 'milking', 'worth', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'other', 'hand', 'rarity', 'showbiz', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interested', 'outproducing', 'demand', 'material', 'unfortunate', 'results', 'are', 'what', 'see', 'What', 'Worth', 'believe', 'be', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'DCS', 'Inc.', 'feed', 'Dave', 'comedy-starved', 'fans', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'am', 'one', 'comedy-starved', 'fans', 'seeing', 'dvd', 'am', 'starting', 'lose', 'hope', 'Dave', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'back', 'favor', 'top', 'new', 'material.As', 'usual', 'Dave', 'comfortable', 'uninhibited', 'front', 'live', 'audience', 'are', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'long', 'stretches', 'chuckle', 'Mostly', 'sat', 'squirming', 'just', 'bit', 'waited', 'next', 'LOL', 'moment', 'Yes', 'know', 'hard', 'believe', 'Dave', 'typical', 'genius', 'failed', 'many', 'times', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'due', 'choice', 'subjects', 'other', 'things', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'molesting', 'kids', 'how', 'seduce', 'monkey', 'Kobe', 'Bryant', 'Even', 'great', 'DC', 'was', 'unable', 'wring', 'humor', 'stuff', 'Then', 'again', 'hilarious', 'stand', 'corrected.The', 'lone', 'special', 'feature', 'left', 'center', 'mini-moments', 'Dave', 'was', 'unremarkable', 'series', 'outtakes', 'practice', 'session', 'filmed', 'left', 'center', 'Pass.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'buying', 'Dvd', 'might', 'be', 'rental', ""'re"", 'really', 'hard', 'up', 'next', 'Friday', 'night.-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",Dave Chappelle - For What It's Worth

He starts to degrade into things like shaving his testicles, some not-so-funny spiels on notorious trials, infamous kidnappings, sex with monkeys, George Washington, and just a rambling of things that just aren't nearly on the same level as his acclaimed Killing Them Softly.The ""George Washington"" part is a terrible bomb, because Chappelle refers to his writing of the Declaration of Independence, which is, of course, a few decades earlier than his death, and Washington had nothing to do with that, as any half-educated person would know. Although he goes on to mention that he was a slave owner while also quoting the document, nothing can really make up for the fact that it isn't really nitpicking to be off about something so critical (Washington had nothing to do with the Declaration, of course). Then he goes onto some basic themes about race relations, none of which is really profound.The rest is very meh. Nothing after the first half is all that funny or original. He touches on such common comedy issues without any real edge, and it drags. It's really a shame, but it just falls apart the more it goes on.This is definitely no Killing Them Softly. It starts strong, but just starts to break down as it goes on, and Chappelle seems gradually more tired as it goes on.

914025,A8T0UKQJD5RSX,B0009VRHLU,Critical Reviewer,"[2, 26]","I love comedy. I've been watching stand up comedy, comedians, doing comedy since I was 14 years old (I'm 32 now). Even with my slightly biased preference for male black comedians, I have to digress and say that Chappelle is a mediocre, at best above average, stand up talent. I saw his stand up act, forgot what it was called already -- pretty forgettable, on DVD several years ago and thought he was just okay. He had some funny bits about cops sprinkling crack on people, but overall I wasn't laughing so hard I couldn't see.This stand up act confirms my assessment that Dave Chappelle is great at doing sketch comedy on his TV shows, but his stand up material just doesn't fly. I think it has partly to do with the fact that the material on his show is co-written by his good friend, Brennan, and fellow actors on the show. There were some funny parts on his stand up act. I thought the middle segue about Jah Rule, talking at his old high school, getting stoned with white folks was pretty hilarious. The s*#! streak on his shirt was plain out riotous. But, almost 80 percent of his act was just amusing at best, forgettable for the most part.I would say the funniest s*#! I have heard in recent years is Dave Attell's Skanks for the Memories. I had it playing on the CD player on my drive home from Santa Cruz, and it was NON STOP hardcore laughing the whole 60 minutes. There were times when I was laughing so hard, I couldn't see and almost drove off the road! That dude is PURE talent. Another great act that I saw recently was on Jamie Foxx's Def Jam Comedy DVD's. His name is Lavelle Crawford, and that fat black bastard had me rolling so hard, I had to stand up cause I was laughing so damn hard! Even Jamie Foxx's last stand up act in Oakland was unbelievable. His bit about Bill Clinton had me cramped over laughing so hard! Although, his first stand up release on DVD totally sucked.Anyways, Dave, go back to doing your TV show. Your stand up isn't so hot.",3,Dave Chappelle is a mediocre stand up talent,1126051200,"09 7, 2005",2005,1970,"['love', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'comedians', 'doing', 'comedy', 'was', '14', 'years', 'old', ""'m"", '32', 'now', 'Even', 'slightly', 'biased', 'preference', 'male', 'black', 'comedians', 'have', 'digress', 'say', 'Chappelle', 'mediocre', 'best', 'above', 'average', 'stand', 'up', 'talent', 'saw', 'stand', 'up', 'act', 'forgot', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'already', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'DVD', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'had', 'funny', 'bits', 'cops', 'sprinkling', 'crack', 'people', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'could', ""n't"", 'see.This', 'stand', 'up', 'act', 'confirms', 'assessment', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'great', 'doing', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'TV', 'shows', 'stand', 'up', 'material', 'just', ""n't"", 'fly', 'think', 'partly', 'do', 'fact', 'material', 'show', 'co-written', 'good', 'friend', 'Brennan', 'fellow', 'actors', 'show', 'were', 'funny', 'parts', 'stand', 'up', 'act', 'thought', 'middle', 'segue', 'Jah', 'Rule', 'talking', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'getting', 'stoned', 'white', 'folks', 'was', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 's*', 'streak', 'shirt', 'was', 'plain', 'out', 'riotous', 'almost', '80', 'percent', 'act', 'was', 'just', 'amusing', 'best', 'forgettable', 'most', 'part.I', 'would', 'say', 'funniest', 's*', 'have', 'heard', 'recent', 'years', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'Skanks', 'Memories', 'had', 'playing', 'CD', 'player', 'drive', 'home', 'Santa', 'Cruz', 'was', 'NON', 'STOP', 'hardcore', 'laughing', 'whole', '60', 'minutes', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'almost', 'drove', 'off', 'road', 'dude', 'PURE', 'talent', 'great', 'act', 'saw', 'recently', 'was', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Def', 'Jam', 'Comedy', 'DVD', 'name', 'Lavelle', 'Crawford', 'fat', 'black', 'bastard', 'had', 'rolling', 'so', 'hard', 'had', 'stand', 'up', 'cause', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'damn', 'hard', 'Even', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'last', 'stand', 'up', 'act', 'Oakland', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'bit', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'had', 'cramped', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'first', 'stand', 'up', 'release', 'DVD', 'totally', 'Dave', 'go', 'back', 'doing', 'TV', 'show', 'stand', 'up', ""n't"", 'so', 'hot']",Dave Chappelle - For What It's Worth

Chappelle covers the allegations against Michael Jackson, why every black man must have an alibi, smoking marijuana with American Indians, black celebrities, and of course, sex with monkeys.  The material isn't the best we've heard from him (in fact there is a bit of a stretch between some laugh out loud moments), but he is at his best when satirizing race differences, and later on when he discusses the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case and how she could have handled things differently compared to a little heard kidnapping case around the same time involving a young, black girl in Philadelphia.  All in all, For What It's Worth is full of some great comedic moments in a triumphant return to standup comedy for Chappelle, and fans will definitely want to check this out, but the DVD itself is a rip off at it's list price because there's hardly any Special Features here at all.",4,Dave back to doing what he does best: standup,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,1167,"['demise', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'smash', 'hit', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'comedian', 'Dave', 'Chappelle', 'what', 'made', 'comedy', 'star', 'standup', 'What', 'Worth', 'finds', 'Chappelle', 'San', 'Francisco', 'hour', 'long', 'comedy', 'special', 'where', 'feelings', 'certain', 'subjects', 'be', 'known', 'Chappelle', 'allegations', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'why', 'black', 'man', 'must', 'have', 'alibi', 'smoking', 'marijuana', 'American', 'Indians', 'black', 'celebrities', 'course', 'sex', 'monkeys', 'material', ""n't"", 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'fact', 'bit', 'stretch', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'best', 'when', 'satirizing', 'race', 'differences', 'later', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'Smart', 'kidnapping', 'case', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'things', 'differently', 'compared', 'little', 'heard', 'kidnapping', 'case', 'same', 'time', 'involving', 'young', 'black', 'girl', 'Philadelphia', 'What', 'Worth', 'full', 'great', 'comedic', 'moments', 'triumphant', 'return', 'standup', 'comedy', 'Chappelle', 'fans', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'rip', 'off', 'list', 'price', 'hardly', 'Special', 'Features', 'here']",Dave Chappelle - For What It's Worth

Don't get me wrong, I love Chapelle's irreverent,somewhat juvenile, High School humer, but I can only take so many Crack, farting, masterbating and weed jokes.The same type of material that seemed to have worked so well in ""Killen Them Softly"" just seems to fail so badly in this stand up act.One of if not the worst joke he said all night was when he was talking about having Botox surgery...on his balls...to get the wrinkles out.When he said that I just shook my head in total embarassment and disbelief.Embarassment because that was actually supposed to be the punchline, disbelief,because that was acually supposed to be the punchline.Okay their were a few funny parts, in fact the joke he made about Kobe Bryant playen for his freedom was damn funny.Also the joke he made about telling young black kids to rap or play basketball if they want to make it out of the ghetto. But those jokes were few and far between. If your looking for something funny from Chapelle as far as his stand-up act, I highly recommend ""Killen Them Softly"".
