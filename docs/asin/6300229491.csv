224384,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300229491,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 3]","You know, I think The Violent Years is actually a pretty decent film, despite its over handed commentary on the whole juvenile delinquency craze that swept through Hollywood in the 1950s.  It's hard to believe, but filmmakers actually used to make films with messages, exhorting viewers to straighten up and fly right - or else, this could happen to you: kids with no respect for anyone, committing crimes just for the kicks, man, etc.  Of course, the effectiveness of such movies can be called into question - but more on that below.As for the film, witness one stone-faced young blonde with impeccable sweater-wearing skills and a lust for thrills.  She leads a gang of buxom hooligans on a crime spree that escalates from gas station holdups to a physical attack on a young man (probably the highlight of the poor dope's entire life, truth be told) to fencing stolen goods to Communist-inspired vandalism to murder.  Poor Paula Parkins (Jean Morehead) has been forced to grow up with rich parents who don't spend enough time with her, always out working or organizing charity events.  Naturally, she has to rebel - and her parents, despite all of their money, are somehow incapable of buying a clue.  Paula is a bad, bad girl, and it's only a matter of time before she discovers why living dangerously is in fact dangerous.I could go into all the crimes they stuff into this one film, but that doesn't get to the heart of this movie.  The whole point of The Violent Years is to lay the blame for juvenile delinquency squarely on the parents.  Certainly, Paula's parents share some of the blame for their daughter's actions, since they were always too busy to talk to her or make sure she was really the good girl they thought her to be, but The Violent Years pins all the blame on Ma and Pa.  Weren't these films targeted at young audiences?  What good did it do to lay all blame for juvenile delinquency on the parents?  Sure, judge, I robbed that store and shot a man in cold blood - but we all know I'm not to blame; it was those rotten parents of mine.  Fortunately, Paula does pay the price for her crimes in this film, but she never takes responsibility for her own actions.Well, maybe the big ending will help convince all those kids in the audience not to make juvenile delinquents out of themselves, even if they have bad parents.  Uh, no - it doesn't.  What you get is an exceedingly long and boring speech from a judge whose monotone could put kids to sleep by the thousands on the night before Christmas.  As it turns out, none other than Ed Wood wrote the script for The Violent Years, and that does a lot to explain the judge's big speech at the end, which has him mandating a return to God and the rehabilitation of the whole woodshed industry.  It's a good and valid message, but the excessive moralizing and seemingly endless length of the whole speech robs it of any real effectiveness.To sum up, I think The Violent Years is a pretty good, albeit campy, film with an important message, but I think the message is directed at the wrong audience and thus fails to accomplish its obvious goal of curbing juvenile delinquency.",4,"Good message, wrong audience",1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,3144,"['know', 'think', 'Violent', 'Years', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'film', 'handed', 'commentary', 'whole', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'craze', 'swept', 'Hollywood', '1950s', 'hard', 'believe', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'used', 'make', 'films', 'messages', 'exhorting', 'viewers', 'straighten', 'up', 'fly', 'right', 'else', 'could', 'happen', 'kids', 'respect', 'anyone', 'committing', 'crimes', 'just', 'kicks', 'man', 'etc', 'course', 'effectiveness', 'such', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'question', 'more', 'below.As', 'film', 'witness', 'one', 'stone-faced', 'young', 'blonde', 'impeccable', 'sweater-wearing', 'skills', 'lust', 'thrills', 'gang', 'buxom', 'hooligans', 'crime', 'spree', 'gas', 'station', 'holdups', 'physical', 'attack', 'young', 'man', 'probably', 'highlight', 'poor', 'dope', 'entire', 'life', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'fencing', 'stolen', 'goods', 'Communist-inspired', 'vandalism', 'murder', 'Poor', 'Paula', 'Parkins', 'Jean', 'Morehead', 'been', 'forced', 'grow', 'up', 'rich', 'parents', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'always', 'out', 'working', 'organizing', 'charity', 'events', 'Naturally', 'rebel', 'parents', 'money', 'are', 'somehow', 'incapable', 'buying', 'clue', 'Paula', 'bad', 'bad', 'girl', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'why', 'living', 'dangerously', 'fact', 'dangerous.I', 'could', 'go', 'crimes', 'stuff', 'one', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'heart', 'movie', 'whole', 'point', 'Violent', 'Years', 'lay', 'blame', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'squarely', 'parents', 'Certainly', 'Paula', 'parents', 'share', 'blame', 'daughter', 'actions', 'were', 'always', 'too', 'busy', 'talk', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'girl', 'thought', 'be', 'Violent', 'Years', 'blame', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Were', ""n't"", 'films', 'targeted', 'young', 'audiences', 'What', 'good', 'did', 'do', 'lay', 'blame', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'parents', 'Sure', 'judge', 'robbed', 'store', 'shot', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'blame', 'was', 'rotten', 'parents', 'mine', 'Fortunately', 'Paula', 'pay', 'price', 'crimes', 'film', 'never', 'responsibility', 'own', 'actions.Well', 'maybe', 'big', 'ending', 'will', 'help', 'convince', 'kids', 'audience', 'not', 'make', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'even', 'have', 'bad', 'parents', 'Uh', ""n't"", 'What', 'get', 'exceedingly', 'long', 'boring', 'speech', 'judge', 'monotone', 'could', 'put', 'kids', 'sleep', 'thousands', 'night', 'Christmas', 'out', 'none', 'other', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'wrote', 'script', 'Violent', 'Years', 'lot', 'explain', 'judge', 'big', 'speech', 'end', 'mandating', 'return', 'God', 'rehabilitation', 'whole', 'woodshed', 'industry', 'good', 'valid', 'message', 'excessive', 'moralizing', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'length', 'whole', 'speech', 'robs', 'real', 'effectiveness.To', 'sum', 'think', 'Violent', 'Years', 'pretty', 'good', 'albeit', 'campy', 'film', 'important', 'message', 'think', 'message', 'directed', 'wrong', 'audience', 'thus', 'fails', 'accomplish', 'obvious', 'goal', 'curbing', 'juvenile', 'delinquency']",Violent Years VHS

For you fans, this one is a keeper, in a hilarious &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; sort of way. The plot is typical Wood fare and the actors struggle bravely to keep up with the speed of the film running through the camera. Rich spoiled babes stick up gas stations, rip the clothes off good gals and force rich guys to do their bidding. I wonder which part of Ed's brain brought this premise to paper. It's one of those &quot;do you know where your children are?&quot; horror stories. I give this debacle four stars because despite the subject manner, lack of decent actors, script, props and...for that matter...plot...Ed Wood followed his dream.  He got his films made.

When I saw the cover to the DVD featuring the chick with the tight sweater and torpedo mammaries I was interested, when I turned it over and saw the name ""Ed Wood"", I was sold. I knew I was in for a treat.This film is inept and terrible, but as entertaining as a decent film. That was the genious of Ed Wood. Most bad movies are a chore to sit through, but Ed's movies are even worse than the worst of bad movies, but you cannot stop watching, laughing, and enjoying yourself. The Violent Years will never reach the levels of Plan 9 from Outer Space, but this is a damn fine film if you are an Ed Wood fan.Paula is a 25 year old teenager who doesn't get any attention from her parents. Her father is so busy running his newspaper that he can only get poor Paula a brand new watch for her birthday year after year!! And her mother is so wrapped up in her charity work that she never has time for mother/daughter heart to heart chats. So what is a poor teenage girl in 1956 supposed to do? Naturally she starts up a gang and goes on a crime spree.They stick up gas stations, force girls to strip off their pretty sweaters at gunpoint, and rape men at lovers lane. But the grand finale of their crime spree is a hoot that must be seen to be believed.They have a 'contact' who has a 'contact' that will pay good money for school vandalism. Why you ask? Paula asks also which is the most intelligent thing she does throughout the movie. The contact tells her never mind and not to ask questions. This is good advice for this film, don't ask questions, just go with it. So off they go to their high school to take revenge on their hated teacher and get paid for doing it.Well classroom destruction in 1956 is a little different than the Columbine massacre. One girl actually ERASES the blackboard! The horror!! Desks are overturned as well, and the teachers desk calandar is ripped in half. Oh the humanity! After a window is broken (the horror), the cops show up and a shootout ensues. The cops are out on the street hiding behind their police cars firing at the girls who are returning fire from the classroom. One girl is shot and has a final line so unforgettable and stupid you'll find yourself hitting the &lt;&lt; button just to hear it again. Another girl gets shot outside during their escape. But watch how this escape goes. The girls are moving so slow and they are practically right in front of the cops when they get in their car! They even drive their car right past the cops and the getaway car passes by the parked cop car by inches. It is so ridiculous you'll laugh your hiney off and wonder if there was a way the scene could possibly be worse!Of course everyone who gets shot never has a bullet hole in their clothes, a drop of blood spilled, or even a look of pain on their faces.Well poor Paula is actually pregnant (and unmarried! The HORROR!!!!) She dies in childbirth and the baby becomes a ward of the state.One of the unsung highlights of this film is the judge. His mundane speeches that could never actually be spoken by a human being in real life will have you rolling with laughter.

One of the girls, after being blasted with a shotgun, announces, ""It wasn't supposed to be like this,"" before lying down gently with no visible signs of damage whatsoever.  After running out of the school, the girls stop directly in front of the cops and chat long enough for another girl to be shot down as well.

A judge refuses to grant Paula's parents custody of the child and further punishes them by reading a speech so long and pointless that even he seems to be dozing off by the end.

224391,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6300229491,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 9]","""The Violent Years"" is a camp classic with the emphasis on the camp.  This 1956 film scripted by the legendary bad movie director Ed Wood (the film is actually directed by William Morgan) begins with four young hellions walking disdainfully by a blackboard on which the rules of propriety have been written.  Meanwhile, a narrator intones: ""This is a story of violence, of violence born in the uncontrolled passions of adolescent youth and fostered by this generation of parents, those who, in their own smug little world of selfish interests and confused ideas of parental supervision, refuse to believe today's glaring headlines.""  There is Georgia (Theresa Hancock), Geraldine (Joanne Cangi), Phyllis (Gloria Farr), and the leader of the pack, Paula Parkins (Jean Moorhead).  Paula's parents are too busy to have heart to hearts with their little girl anymore and so she and the other gals start up a gang so they can rob gas stations, attacks young men at Lover's Lane, and mainly having as much fun as they can on the road to Hell.Now, as you have come to expect with any film bearing the Ed Wood label, the dialogue is horrible, the acting is nonexistent, and the lecture the judge gives Paula's parents at the end of the film is an absolute hoot, all of which speaks to the appeal of this film.  It is so bad that you keep munching on the popcorn through all the pajama parties, heavy petting, murder, mayhem, dope rings, and the baby born in jail to keep your jaw from laying on the floor.  On this Rhino video the 70-minute film is sandwiched by the commentary of former teenage thrill kitten Mamie Van Doren (star of such classics as ""Untamed Youth,"" ""High School Confidential,"" and ""Girls Town"") who makes a series of lame jokes.  But the theme songs for ""Teenage Theater,"" which both starts and ends the tape, sets the stage for this camp classic and gets you in the proper mood.  This is not a first tier Ed Wood film but it is still enjoyably bad and you can make up your own crude jokes and barbs even if, like me, you missed this particular turkey on ""MST3K.""",4,A quartet of leather-jacketed delinquent devil-dolls...,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,2075,"['Violent', 'Years', 'camp', 'classic', 'emphasis', 'camp', '1956', 'film', 'scripted', 'legendary', 'bad', 'movie', 'director', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'film', 'actually', 'directed', 'William', 'Morgan', 'four', 'young', 'hellions', 'walking', 'disdainfully', 'blackboard', 'rules', 'propriety', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Meanwhile', 'narrator', 'intones', 'story', 'violence', 'violence', 'born', 'uncontrolled', 'passions', 'adolescent', 'youth', 'fostered', 'generation', 'parents', 'who', 'own', 'smug', 'little', 'world', 'selfish', 'interests', 'confused', 'ideas', 'parental', 'supervision', 'refuse', 'believe', 'today', 'glaring', 'headlines', 'Georgia', 'Theresa', 'Hancock', 'Geraldine', 'Joanne', 'Cangi', 'Phyllis', 'Gloria', 'Farr', 'leader', 'pack', 'Paula', 'Parkins', 'Jean', 'Moorhead', 'Paula', 'parents', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'have', 'heart', 'hearts', 'little', 'girl', 'anymore', 'so', 'other', 'gals', 'start', 'up', 'gang', 'can', 'rob', 'gas', 'stations', 'attacks', 'young', 'men', 'Lover', 'Lane', 'mainly', 'having', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'can', 'road', 'Hell.Now', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'film', 'bearing', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'label', 'dialogue', 'horrible', 'acting', 'nonexistent', 'lecture', 'judge', 'Paula', 'parents', 'end', 'film', 'absolute', 'hoot', 'appeal', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'keep', 'munching', 'popcorn', 'pajama', 'parties', 'heavy', 'petting', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'dope', 'rings', 'baby', 'born', 'jail', 'keep', 'jaw', 'laying', 'floor', 'Rhino', '70-minute', 'film', 'sandwiched', 'commentary', 'former', 'teenage', 'thrill', 'kitten', 'Mamie', 'Van', 'Doren', 'star', 'such', 'classics', 'Untamed', 'Youth', 'High', 'School', 'Confidential', 'Girls', 'Town', 'who', 'series', 'lame', 'jokes', 'theme', 'songs', 'Teenage', 'Theater', 'starts', 'tape', 'stage', 'camp', 'classic', 'proper', 'mood', 'not', 'first', 'tier', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'film', 'still', 'enjoyably', 'bad', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'crude', 'jokes', 'barbs', 'even', 'missed', 'particular', 'turkey', 'MST3K']",Violent Years VHS
