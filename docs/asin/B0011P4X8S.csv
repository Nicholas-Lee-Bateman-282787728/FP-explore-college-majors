Mostly faithful to the book, the film tries its best to capture the gut wrenching emotional drama of the story and its unforgettable characters, and it succeeds in doing so to a large extent.SLASS (Slightly Longer Attention Span Summary)1. Amir is a boy who lives in Kabul (prior to the Soviet invasion) with his wealthy widowed father. He has a vivid imagination, and is working on writing a story2. He is an introverted child who is bullied by other boys, and never defends himself. He wants desperately to be accepted by his father, who sees him as a weakling.  In simple language, Amir is a wuss.3. His loyal companion and friend is a servant boy named Hassan4. Hassan wields a mean slingshot and isn't afraid to use it. He is devoted to Amir.  Not having had the opportunity to go to school, he can't read or write, but makes up for it with his courage and commitment.5. Both boys are good at the sport of kite fighting. Hassan is especially good at retrieving kites that have been cut away during the competition, having a sixth sense where they are going to land.6. An incident occurs where Amir wusses out yet again. This changes the boys' relationship forever.7. When the Soviets come calling, Amir and his father have to leave rather quickly, eventually ending up in California. A family friend named Rahim Khan keeps an eye on the house.8. Amir grows up and lives his life (partly shown)9. Hassan grows up and lives his life (not shown)10. Rahim Khan calls from Pakistan, giving Amir a chance to prove whether he does, in fact, have a backbone.11. Amir digs deep12. His return to kite flying brings new hopeFor the parts of the movie where the actors speak Dari Persian, there are subtitles in English.  Otherwise, it's in English, and I didn't find this to be a problem.  It would have been impossible for the film to bring out some of the trauma and inner turmoil that make the novel so memorable, and some of the more brutal and tragic scenes have been trimmed, so for the full experience you really need to read the book, if you haven't already.With excellent acting by the two young men playing Amir and Hassan, this is a movie you won't forget in a hurry.  Highly recommended - but walk with your hankie or a pack of tissues.Amanda Richards, April 15, 2008",5,No country for young men,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,2456,"['Whether', ""'ve"", 'read', 'best-selling', 'first', 'novel', 'Khaled', 'Hosseini', 'not', 'haunting', 'movie', 'will', 'drain', 'emotions', 'moisten', 'eyes', 'bring', 'out', 'goose', 'bumps', 'Mostly', 'faithful', 'book', 'film', 'best', 'capture', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'emotional', 'drama', 'story', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'doing', 'so', 'large', 'extent.SLASS', 'Slightly', 'Longer', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', '1', 'Amir', 'boy', 'who', 'Kabul', 'prior', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'wealthy', 'widowed', 'father', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'working', 'writing', 'story2', 'introverted', 'child', 'who', 'bullied', 'other', 'boys', 'never', 'desperately', 'be', 'accepted', 'father', 'who', 'weakling', 'simple', 'language', 'Amir', 'wuss.3', 'loyal', 'companion', 'friend', 'servant', 'boy', 'named', 'Hassan4', 'Hassan', 'mean', 'slingshot', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'use', 'devoted', 'Amir', 'Not', 'having', 'had', 'opportunity', 'go', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'write', 'up', 'courage', 'commitment.5', 'boys', 'are', 'good', 'sport', 'kite', 'fighting', 'Hassan', 'especially', 'good', 'retrieving', 'kites', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'away', 'competition', 'having', 'sixth', 'sense', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'land.6', 'incident', 'where', 'Amir', 'out', 'yet', 'again', 'boys', 'relationship', 'forever.7', 'When', 'Soviets', 'come', 'calling', 'Amir', 'father', 'have', 'leave', 'rather', 'quickly', 'eventually', 'ending', 'up', 'California', 'family', 'friend', 'named', 'Rahim', 'Khan', 'eye', 'house.8', 'Amir', 'up', 'life', 'partly', 'shown', '9', 'Hassan', 'up', 'life', 'not', 'shown', '10', 'Rahim', 'Khan', 'Pakistan', 'giving', 'Amir', 'chance', 'prove', 'fact', 'have', 'backbone.11', 'Amir', 'deep12', 'return', 'kite', 'flying', 'brings', 'new', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'actors', 'speak', 'Dari', 'Persian', 'are', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Otherwise', 'English', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'problem', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'film', 'bring', 'out', 'trauma', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'make', 'novel', 'so', 'memorable', 'more', 'brutal', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'trimmed', 'so', 'full', 'experience', 'really', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'already.With', 'excellent', 'acting', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'playing', 'Amir', 'Hassan', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'hurry', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'walk', 'hankie', 'pack', 'tissues.Amanda', 'Richards', 'April', '15', '2008']",N/A

Yet, it is also a story of tragedy and betrayal and hidden secrets.  The net result is a thoroughly entrancing and sad tale that tugs at the emotions of the viewer.  I, for one, was certainly moved to tears.  The story resonated with me like few others in recent years.The cast is one of unknowns.  No big Hollywood names here.  The setting is Afghanistan although the filming took place in far western China.  A beautiful and exotic setting.  Stupendous mountains rising from dusty plains.  Awe inspiring!  The story itself was equally majestic.The takeaways from the film for me was the need for friends to be true.  Life is short and mistakes can create a lifetime of consequences.  It also reinforced for me the insanities that come with religious bigotry.  In the twentieth century at least has there been a more evil group of religious fanatics than the Taliban?

1132056,A2XFA2HIIKS5G2,B0011P4X8S,Bentley,"[2, 2]","""I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid, overcast day in the winter of 1975.""- Amir (the narrator in The Kite Runner)For me, the movie The Kite Runner was like an abbreviated Greek epic fraught with all of the demons and obstacles which must be overcome to atone for one or another tragic flaws.  These imperfections cause internal suffering and conflict for our beloved hero.  The hero has to endure some protracted personal suffering and soul searching before being allowed to embark on a course of action which will cleanse his soul ridding him of a tempest which seems to thwart his every attempt to survive or complete himself.  Such is the fate of Amir; not a Greek tragic hero; but simply an Afghani 12 year old boy when we meet him.The film has many scenes in Farsi with English subtitles which may be difficult for some to accustom themselves to; but more disturbing might be some of the allusions and images of child rape and sexual slavery (although very delicately handled); nonetheless included as powerful symbols of the film.Aside from the above, the story deals with two young boys who grew up in Afghanistan; one privileged (Amir) and one not (Hassan).  Their two very different lives and paths develop into a storyline which reveals how different their past, present and future would be.  The movie also evaluates friendships of all kinds: friendship of the boys themselves, of their fathers (Baba and Ali), of Baba (Amir's father) and that of Rakim Khan and of Baba and other Afghanis who find themselves in a foreign land which is never like the dust of Kabul. Once most of them were rich and well established and now all have found themselves in a different strata of society in a strange new country.  Baba seemed to like the idea of America; but not the place itself.  To his way of thinking even the flies were in a hurry.Themes relating to conflicts and tensions between fathers and sons were examined as well as themes of betrayal and redemption.  How does one forgive others and probably most difficult: how does a person forgive oneself.Amir, the privileged Pashtun son of Baba, finds himself in the unenviable position of desiring love from his father at a very early age and seeking the affirmation of that love throughout his life; most likely the result of his mother dying in childbirth.  This constant feeling of being unworthy causes him to feel and act unworthy of his truly noble spirit which seemed at times to be camouflaged by his bratty and selfish behavior.  His boyhood friend was a Hazara and lived a very different life than Amir; Hassan was Amir's closest friend as well as being his devoted servant; however, what causes much of the tempest within Amir was that Hassan possessed many of the qualities that Amir's father Baba seemed to quietly admire in Hassan.. other than those qualities of excellence shown in his own son Amir.  This, of course, disturbed Amir and brought out the worst in him.Amir felt in retrospect that somehow while growing up, he aspired to cowardice and really did not know why.  The story tells the outcome of these two different ways of life and different choices and gives at least one of the characters (Amir) a way out of the darkness and a way to redeem himself; most importantly for his own personal salvation.The book which I read when it originally was released and the audio read by Hosseini himself were terrific and memorable.  You would be hard pressed to not be moved by this tale.  The movie, however, did not follow the book to the letter nor did some of its major plot sequences especially after the meeting with the town bully, his old nemesis Assef.  I was a little disturbed by this detour; but still found the movie to be well done, memorable and very worthwhile.This is as much a story of life and love as it is of death and separation; as  much a story of hope and salvation as it is of war and devastation.  There are so many parallels in this story; that lead you back to your own life and how you handle your own friendships, your own loyalties and how in the end you not only have to forgive others; but most importantly yourself.  You come away from watching the movie with a message that we indeed might all be flawed; and that we cannot be too hard on ourselves.  Hosseini has put a human face to the turmoil suffered by the country of Afghanistan and its people.The acting was superb; I enjoyed all of the cast especially the actors playing the young boys (Amir and Hassan).  They did a stupendous job and captured these characters' inner essence perfectly.The movie succeeds where others would have failed in discussing very sensitive cultural and moral topics and delivers a moving, heart felt story.

Spanning two continents, multiple family generations, and many decades, this film touches on a myriad of items including friendship, love, loss, and, ultimately, redemption.It's prime mover is young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi), a native Afghan boy who often plays with the hired help; mainly young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), a Hazara boy who's family is supposedly inferior to the ruling Afghans. But the two form a bond of friendship based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), closeness in Amir's house, and, of course, kite flying.But bad times are on the way for the city of Kabul. The communists are invading and Amir and Hassan have separated due to an impossibly brutal act of prejudice by an Afghan boy against Hassan. The two may never see each other again.Amir's father races to get himself and his son out of Afghanistan, eventually finding their way to America. Here the two set up a gas station and live hand to mouth by selling at niche markets. And as Amir's father gradually becomes ill, a new revelation will strike to the heart of Amir; one that he cannot ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul.A study of friendship, war, and reconciliation, The Kite Runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema. The story is never inappropriately spoken in English whenever we're in a foreign country, and only broken English whenever we're in America. This was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism.The acting was on-par with the best you'll see, too. Particular note must be made of Homayoun Ershadi who plays Baba, Amir's ailing father and strong patriarch. Also lead Khalid Abdalla as the older Amir is played well, especially when returning to Kabul to find it in ruin; quite the contrast from when he'd left.The cinematography of Afghanistan during Amir's escape and ultimate return are nothing short of breathtaking, with snow-capped peaks that will cause your mouth to slacken (I'm not sure exactly which mountain range they used in the film, but wherever it was I want to go there and film it myself!)But it isn't the cinematography nor the acting of one or two people that makes this film a success.

Erland,"[6, 6]","Note: Presented in English Dari, Pashtu, Urdu and Russian.Synopsis: Amir and Hassan are two young boys and best friends growing up in Afghanistan prior to the coming of the Taliban. When one boy, Amir and his Father leave for America all contact with Hassan is lost until many years later when both have grown and married. Amir is beckoned to return to his Homeland on a very specific and dangerous mission. It's something he must do not only for the sake of his childhood friendship, but his only chance to forgive himself for a wrong committed against  Hassan before his departure. If Amir succeeds he will finally be free of the pain and guilt he has carried with him ever since.The '07 film `Kite Runner' is a touching but somewhat uneven tale that spends too much time developing the storyline in the first part of the film and then rushing through the second half. Amir's life threatening mission in Afghanistan is accomplished much too quickly and easily creating an unrealistic atmosphere to the story and short-circuiting any build-up of drama or tension. Be that as it may, the filmmaker and authors desired message is successfully delivered to the viewer and one is left with a better appreciation of Afghanistan and its people.What really made the film for me was the role of Amir's Father played by Homayoun Ershadi. His strength, courage and adhence to a strict code of ethics is superbly portrayed. Sometimes we need to be reminded that such honorable people exist in cultures that have all to frequently become synonymous with distrust, hatred and terrorism in the American mindset.",4,"""It's A Dangerous Thing Being Born"" ~ Honor, Friendship And Brotherhood",1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,1598,"['Note', 'Presented', 'English', 'Dari', 'Pashtu', 'Urdu', 'Russian.Synopsis', 'Amir', 'Hassan', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'best', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'Afghanistan', 'prior', 'coming', 'Taliban', 'When', 'one', 'boy', 'Amir', 'Father', 'leave', 'America', 'contact', 'Hassan', 'lost', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'have', 'grown', 'married', 'Amir', 'beckoned', 'return', 'Homeland', 'very', 'specific', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'something', 'must', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'sake', 'childhood', 'friendship', 'only', 'chance', 'forgive', 'wrong', 'committed', 'Hassan', 'departure', 'Amir', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'free', 'pain', 'guilt', 'carried', 'ever', 'since.The', ""'07"", 'film', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'touching', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'tale', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'storyline', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'then', 'rushing', 'second', 'half', 'Amir', 'life', 'threatening', 'mission', 'Afghanistan', 'accomplished', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'easily', 'creating', 'unrealistic', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'short-circuiting', 'build-up', 'drama', 'tension', 'Be', 'may', 'filmmaker', 'authors', 'desired', 'message', 'successfully', 'delivered', 'viewer', 'one', 'left', 'better', 'appreciation', 'Afghanistan', 'people.What', 'really', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'role', 'Amir', 'Father', 'played', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'strength', 'courage', 'adhence', 'strict', 'code', 'ethics', 'superbly', 'portrayed', 'Sometimes', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'such', 'honorable', 'people', 'exist', 'cultures', 'have', 'frequently', 'become', 'synonymous', 'distrust', 'hatred', 'terrorism', 'American', 'mindset']",N/A

Mom""","[0, 0]","This was about my only chance to see this movie, as it opened and shut - if indeed it ever showed in my home town - with the alacrity of a clam between high and low tide. Nothing could be more out of the mainstream than a subtitled movie, starring unknown and/or foreign actors, in the harsh high country of Afghanistan during the relatively idyllic period before the Soviet invasion, and under the joyless and hypocritical rule of the  Taliban, who turned the place into sort of religious concentration camp, full of rules against practically every normal human recreation or amusement and enforced them with murderous severity.It begins with images of kites, dancing in a clear blue sky - an image that is repeated over and over, as the story runs from the near present of a talented young writer, a member of the Afghan Diaspora. Amir is happily married, has just received a box of copies of his first book (only another writer can truly appreciate what that means - the first printed copies of your own words!) and a message from an old family friend, telling him that he must return to Afghanistan. But first he returns in memory to his privileged childhood in Kabul, to adventures with his best friend Hassan, the son of one of his fathers' servants. Hassan is his perfect foil in being boldly confident,  where Amir is rather timid and shuns confrontations. But Hassan loves the stories that Amir creates, and Amir cheers on Hassan's skill in kite-flying completion - and they both adore action movies, having memorized lines from Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson - although Hassan is startled to learn that Charles Bronson is not, in fact Afghani - he's only dubbed that way. Amir's father is loving and indulgent of his son, and his friendship with Hassan. When that friendship is fractured, first by an ugly encounter with a street bully and by Amir's guilt-ridden reaction to it, Amir's father is distressed. But events overtake the personal. The Russians invade, and Amir and his father flee, smuggled out concealed in the hold of a tanker-truck.Twenty years later, Amir returns to Kabul, to discover secrets in the rubble of that quiet and prosperous place that he knew with the eyes of childhood. It is heartbreakingly changed from what he remembered: women are forced to wear veils and executions by stoning are carried out at half-time in a soccer match in the sports stadium. Men must wear beards, and western clothes are forbidden, and so is the flying of kites. There is nothing left except memories, his intention of rescuing Hassan's orphaned son and to redeem himself, discovering secrets in the rubble of the town that he once knew so well.The story develops in beautiful, pitch-perfect detail, and the performances from the actors are outstanding, especially Homayoun Ershadi as Amir's father:  even on the run, and in illness and poverty he remains a man of unfailing grace and strength.",5,Pitch-perfect Detail in Storytelling,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,2913,"['was', 'only', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'opened', 'shut', 'indeed', 'ever', 'showed', 'home', 'town', 'alacrity', 'clam', 'high', 'low', 'tide', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'mainstream', 'subtitled', 'movie', 'starring', 'unknown', 'and/or', 'foreign', 'actors', 'harsh', 'high', 'country', 'Afghanistan', 'relatively', 'idyllic', 'period', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'joyless', 'hypocritical', 'rule', 'Taliban', 'who', 'turned', 'place', 'sort', 'religious', 'concentration', 'camp', 'full', 'rules', 'practically', 'normal', 'human', 'recreation', 'amusement', 'enforced', 'murderous', 'severity.It', 'images', 'kites', 'dancing', 'clear', 'blue', 'sky', 'image', 'repeated', 'over', 'story', 'near', 'present', 'talented', 'young', 'writer', 'member', 'Afghan', 'Diaspora', 'Amir', 'happily', 'married', 'just', 'received', 'box', 'copies', 'first', 'book', 'only', 'writer', 'can', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'what', 'first', 'printed', 'copies', 'own', 'words', 'message', 'old', 'family', 'friend', 'telling', 'must', 'return', 'Afghanistan', 'first', 'memory', 'privileged', 'childhood', 'Kabul', 'adventures', 'best', 'friend', 'Hassan', 'son', 'one', 'fathers', 'servants', 'Hassan', 'perfect', 'foil', 'being', 'boldly', 'confident', 'where', 'Amir', 'rather', 'timid', 'shuns', 'confrontations', 'Hassan', 'stories', 'Amir', 'Amir', 'cheers', 'Hassan', 'skill', 'kite-flying', 'completion', 'adore', 'action', 'movies', 'having', 'memorized', 'lines', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Hassan', 'startled', 'learn', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'not', 'fact', 'Afghani', 'only', 'dubbed', 'way', 'Amir', 'father', 'loving', 'indulgent', 'son', 'friendship', 'Hassan', 'When', 'friendship', 'fractured', 'first', 'ugly', 'encounter', 'street', 'bully', 'Amir', 'guilt-ridden', 'reaction', 'Amir', 'father', 'distressed', 'events', 'overtake', 'personal', 'Russians', 'invade', 'Amir', 'father', 'flee', 'smuggled', 'out', 'concealed', 'hold', 'tanker-truck.Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Amir', 'Kabul', 'discover', 'secrets', 'rubble', 'quiet', 'prosperous', 'place', 'knew', 'eyes', 'childhood', 'heartbreakingly', 'changed', 'what', 'remembered', 'women', 'are', 'forced', 'wear', 'veils', 'executions', 'stoning', 'are', 'carried', 'out', 'half-time', 'soccer', 'match', 'sports', 'stadium', 'Men', 'must', 'wear', 'beards', 'western', 'clothes', 'are', 'forbidden', 'so', 'flying', 'kites', 'nothing', 'left', 'memories', 'intention', 'rescuing', 'Hassan', 'orphaned', 'son', 'redeem', 'discovering', 'secrets', 'rubble', 'town', 'once', 'knew', 'so', 'well.The', 'story', 'beautiful', 'pitch-perfect', 'detail', 'performances', 'actors', 'are', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'Amir', 'father', 'even', 'run', 'illness', 'poverty', 'man', 'unfailing', 'grace', 'strength']",N/A

Amir and Hassan are 12 year old boys who share a love of kites. They are the best of friends despite the fact that Hassan is from the lower class and is a Hazarai ethnic minority while Amir is a Pashtun from the upper class. The two boys are often harrassed by a group of bullies. But Hassan is able to ward them off with his trusty slingshot. Later, when Hassan is serving as the ""kite runner"" for Amir, he is brutally beaten and raped by these same bullies. Amir has a chance to intervene but instead he runs away. It is Amir's guilt over his cowardly act that drives the plot of the rest of the movie.The child actors who played Amir and Hassan are outstanding. Hassan, in particular, just exudes charm and bravery. Amir's father, Baba, is also an interesting character. He is a secularist and humanitarian who despises both the Communist invaders and the Muslim extremists who end up fighting for control of Afghanistan. I wish the film had provided a bit more substance and depth in its examination of the class and ethnic tensions that divide the country. But this is reallly a movie more about friendship, betrayal, guilt and redemption than politics.I'm usually not one for sentimental stories. But I found this movie to be emotionally moving and effective, the lady next to me in the theater was balling her eyes out.

1132073,A30AO422P01XK0,B0011P4X8S,Daniel Mackler,"[1, 3]","What I loved:Great acting (brilliant, in fact), an incredible entrance to a world I know little about (Afghanistan in the 1970s), often excellent storytelling, and an overall sense of trying to grow up and right past wrongs.What I hated (strap yourself in):1) The son--Amir, the main character--never blames his father for being a rejecting brute, because Amir doesn't ever allow himself to explore his father's brutality.  The writers/directors also fail to explore this to any sufficient degree.  As the result, Amir comes across as a weak, intrinsically flawed coward, selling out and rejecting his loyal best friend of childhood--Hassan.  There was nothing but the barest acknowledgement that Amir was entirely set up to behave this way by his father.  In many ways his father loved and admired Hassan more, and emotionally rejected and shamed Amir because of it.  Amir was desperate for his father's love, and had no emotional choice but to brutally reject Hassan for it.2) The father had so many powerful opportunities to get closer to Amir, and to explore Amir's pain, and yet utterly failed to do so, and instead just drove his own wedge of rejection in deeper--all the while blaming Amir for his cowardice.  The director and writer failed miserably to elucidate this in a way that accomplishes anything other than laying most of the blame at Amir's feet--blaming the child and exonerating the parent.  Same old ugly lie that society's thrives on.3) The father is presented as a brave hero.  Yet what is really brave about rejecting your own son?  The father takes a bold move by standing up to a brutal Russian soldier who wants to rape a young Afghan woman, and the father is nearly killed for it.  But is this true heroism?  What about his obligation to protect his son, and be a real father to him?  Had the soldier killed the father (which nearly happened), Amir, who was motherless, would have had no parent, and would likely have died--if only emotionally.  Had the father really been brave he would have fought for his son fully, and fought the demons within himself that prevented him from being a more nurturing, respectful parent.4) Instead of confronting his brutal father, Amir (and the director) confronts the Taliban--making them the ultimate bad-guy.  Yeah, they're horrible--but it's always easier to blame an evil regime than a lousy parent.5) Many of the scenes of Afghanistan in the year 2000 were CHEESY.  I'm no expert on the Taliban, but this film struck me as over-the-top.  Okay, we all know the Taliban can be brutal and primitive and anti-women, but it felt unnecessary to present their leaders as pedophiles as well.  And the movie totally lost me when the main character and the boy take on the Taliban with simply a slingshot and ""courage.""  It went from being a deep movie that strived for something real into something more befitting Harrison Ford.  (And don't get me wrong--Harrison Ford can be great, but when I want to watch Harrison Ford I watch ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Star Wars."")",3,Complex movie:  I loved it and hated it,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,3022,"['What', 'loved', 'Great', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'incredible', 'entrance', 'world', 'know', 'little', 'Afghanistan', '1970s', 'often', 'excellent', 'storytelling', 'overall', 'sense', 'trying', 'grow', 'up', 'right', 'past', 'wrongs.What', 'hated', 'strap', ':1', 'son', 'Amir', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'father', 'being', 'rejecting', 'brute', 'Amir', ""n't"", 'ever', 'allow', 'explore', 'father', 'brutality', 'writers/directors', 'also', 'fail', 'explore', 'sufficient', 'degree', 'result', 'Amir', 'across', 'weak', 'intrinsically', 'flawed', 'coward', 'selling', 'out', 'rejecting', 'loyal', 'best', 'friend', 'childhood', 'Hassan', 'was', 'nothing', 'barest', 'acknowledgement', 'Amir', 'was', 'entirely', 'set', 'up', 'behave', 'way', 'father', 'many', 'ways', 'father', 'loved', 'admired', 'Hassan', 'more', 'emotionally', 'rejected', 'shamed', 'Amir', 'Amir', 'was', 'desperate', 'father', 'love', 'had', 'emotional', 'choice', 'brutally', 'reject', 'Hassan', 'it.2', 'father', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'powerful', 'opportunities', 'get', 'closer', 'Amir', 'explore', 'Amir', 'pain', 'yet', 'utterly', 'failed', 'do', 'so', 'instead', 'just', 'drove', 'own', 'wedge', 'rejection', 'deeper', 'while', 'blaming', 'Amir', 'cowardice', 'director', 'writer', 'failed', 'miserably', 'elucidate', 'way', 'accomplishes', 'anything', 'other', 'laying', 'most', 'blame', 'Amir', 'feet', 'blaming', 'child', 'exonerating', 'parent', 'Same', 'old', 'ugly', 'society', 'thrives', 'on.3', 'father', 'presented', 'brave', 'hero', 'what', 'really', 'brave', 'rejecting', 'own', 'son', 'father', 'bold', 'move', 'standing', 'up', 'brutal', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'who', 'rape', 'young', 'Afghan', 'woman', 'father', 'nearly', 'killed', 'true', 'heroism', 'What', 'obligation', 'protect', 'son', 'be', 'real', 'father', 'Had', 'soldier', 'killed', 'father', 'nearly', 'happened', 'Amir', 'who', 'was', 'motherless', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'parent', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'died', 'only', 'emotionally', 'Had', 'father', 'really', 'been', 'brave', 'would', 'have', 'fought', 'son', 'fully', 'fought', 'demons', 'prevented', 'being', 'more', 'nurturing', 'respectful', 'parent.4', 'Instead', 'confronting', 'brutal', 'father', 'Amir', 'director', 'Taliban', 'making', 'ultimate', 'bad-guy', 'Yeah', ""'re"", 'horrible', 'always', 'easier', 'blame', 'evil', 'regime', 'lousy', 'parent.5', 'Many', 'scenes', 'Afghanistan', 'year', '2000', 'were', 'CHEESY', ""'m"", 'expert', 'Taliban', 'film', 'struck', 'over-the-top', 'Okay', 'know', 'Taliban', 'can', 'be', 'brutal', 'primitive', 'anti-women', 'felt', 'unnecessary', 'present', 'leaders', 'pedophiles', 'well', 'movie', 'totally', 'lost', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'boy', 'take', 'Taliban', 'simply', 'slingshot', 'courage', 'went', 'being', 'deep', 'movie', 'strived', 'something', 'real', 'something', 'more', 'befitting', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'when', 'want', 'watch', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'watch', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Star', 'Wars']",N/A

1132078,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0011P4X8S,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[10, 15]","While Marc Forster's adaptation of Khaled Hosseini's ""The Kite Runner"" faithfully and enjoyably follows the book's storyline, it does so without the benefit of many of the novel's acclaimed multi-layered and nuanced techniques.  Alas, it is always difficult to translate a work of literature to that of film yet happily, the story of the two children takes off at the start with the refreshing lift of one of the fighting kites shown to perfection in the kite flying sequences.  Unfortunately, that sense of reaching for the sky comes to a screeching halt once the boys split and the film's momentum slows while relaying the immigrant experience in America.  Even the climatic ending bores somewhat; what works in a book seems contrived in a film that filters days of reading into 120 minutes on celluloid.Nevertheless, the potential for the film to speak volumes over a cultural abyss certainly is palpable even while viewing just the trailer.  Despite the obvious charms of the two children, the strong performance by Homayoun Ershadi as the intellectual communist and mullah-hating Baba, the digitally enhanced ballet of the fighting kites, and the sometimes soaring panoramic view of the white capped mountains rising above the frenetic energy of pre-Communist Kabul, ""The Kite Runner"" fails on some level of detail that is difficult to pinpoint, yet strangely obvious due to its absence.  Even with the spectacular alliance of lovely sets, wonderfully unknown actors and a tale of delayed coming of age, the overall depiction achieves a slightly unpolished ambiance that suggests, ever so sadly more Lifetime Movie Channel tension than Academy Award nuance.As the adult Amir, actor Khalid Abdalla misses the mark somewhat---he doesn't convey the demonstrative depth indigenous to a man tortured by a childhood hallmarked by countless acts of cowardice. The film's Amir seems hesitant as well he should, overwhelmed as a child by the outspoken nobility of his father, Baba---a definitive hard act to follow as exemplified by a passion ignited scene where Baba almost stupidly yet heroically defies a Russian soldier while defending the honor of a lower caste Afghan wife.Child actor, Zekiria Ebrahimi, with his dark chocolate eyes fluctuating between conflicting emotional states of camaraderie, jealousy, guilt and learned superiority, elicits well-deserved pity and disappointment from the audience.  We cringe at his uncertainty, understanding his sense of failure in the knowledge that his father recognizes and approves of the stubborn manliness of his Hazara servant, Hassan, played to perfection by the adorably stoic Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada more so than he does the sensitive yet underhanded nature of his own son.  Amir's lies shift beautifully within the dark liquidity of his eyes like the kites that duel against the backdrop of the Hindukush system of mountains and we are mesmerized by the deep sadness that lies within their depths.  The film's childhood segment succeeds in seducing us with its colorful charm and its wealth of story background.However, once Amir transitions from Kabul to California and childhood to manhood, he and the film loose ground.  The deep-rooted inferiority blatantly exhibited by the child just doesn't appear inherent to the adult actor's emotional repertoire. Amir's mature uncertainty seems to stem from a nebulous source: perhaps if it formulated from angst derived from his desire to be a writer, his immigrant adaptation to an American environment or more simply his change of social station, we would nod our heads in mutual understanding.Whatever the case, once the story leaves the quaint environs of Kabul, the film seems to flounder; the unfolding of the crisis highlighted by the chemistry between the two boys dwindles even when Amir returns to his homeland to find the son of his one time friend.  Only the strong insistent thread provided by Homayoun Ershadi (Baba) weaves through this portion of the film reminding us of the ideal Afghanistan and the real intent of the film.And like Afghanistan, we cannot forget the character Hassan--who acts as a metaphor of sorts for the persistent nature of a country that even after invasion remains distinctly steadfast and loyal in its view of the role it plays.  Even in death Hassan rises again like the phoenix, his spirit embodied by his son--he epitomizes his homeland tired of communist invaders, Taliban fanatics and caste discrimination.  This relationship between Hassan and his country although played with isn't explored.  The similarities between Hassan and Baba should be underlined to keep the idealistic Afghanistan alive during the immigrant portion of the film.Bottom line:  ""The Kite Runner"" has much in its favor, however, its segments and performances offer an uneven depiction of a young Afghan's struggle to assuage a major event defining a troubled childhood.  Visually pleasing and culturally fascinating, this trial by fire develops into an improbable tale of coincidence and loose threads that eventually tie up into a pleasing little bundle of bittersweet reckoning. Performances of note include Homayoun Ershadi and Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada.  Recommended with caution -beware the rather sensitive treatment of child rape and sexual slavery- which no matter how delicately treated still disturbed this reviewer, as well it should.Diana Faillace

1132082,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0011P4X8S,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Can a film be too faithful to the book upon which it is based? Judging from the time-spanning 2007 adaptation of Khaled Hosseini'shuge 2003 seller, the answer is rather ironically ""yes"". Like many, I was enthralled by the book, an impressive first effort by the Afghan-American writer/physician. So obviously were director Marc Forster (Stranger Than Fiction) and screenwriter David Benioff (Troy), who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story within the film's 127-minute running time. Yet, the seamless tapestry of heartfelt events in Hosseini's novel often comes across as episodic and truncated because Forster and Benioff are sincerely trying hard to remain true to the full scope of the story within the time constraints. Part of the challenge is how Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to provide literary, then-and-now symmetry to what is essentially a three-act story, a technique that can come across as somewhat contrived onscreen.However, the filmmakers do the most important things right, specifically giving the viewer an intimate look into a hidden culture heretofore conveyed through CNN news reports, ensuring authenticity by having characters speak in the Dari Persian dialect of the Afghan language, and capturing the emotional entanglements of the complex narrative. The first part of the movie is set in 1978 Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and the eventual takeover of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of an affluent businessman named Baba, and the devoted Hassan, the son of his father's servant. Connected by their mutual love of kite running, the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably. Unable to find the courage that comes so naturally to his father, Amir is crippled by guilt for not having rescued Hassan from an unspeakable act performed by a trio of local bullies. Forster makes especially palpable the ethnic tensions between the Hazara and the Pashtun in Afghanistan.Upon the 1979 invasion by Soviet troops, Amir and Baba flee to the U.S. where the story picks up their story nine years later in Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan &eacute;migr&eacute;s. Baba is reduced to working in a gas station and operating a flea market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and marries. This is the film's least interesting passage since Benioff's treatment gives short shrift to ancillary characters like Amir's wife Soraya and most critically, Amir is portrayed by necessity as a reticent young man with a downward cast toward his self-esteem. The final section flashes forward twelve years where Amir, upon publication of his first book, is summoned back to Taliban-dictated Afghanistan to rescue Hassan's son from the Taliban, as a means to atone for his cowardice years earlier. There is true suspense and fear generated in this portion of the story as shocking revelations and old acquaintances come back to haunt Amir during his journey.A British actor of Egyptian heritage, Khalid Abdalla (the lead hijacker inUnited 93) has the central role of Amir as an adult, a challenging role since he has to convey a constant sense of shame and diminished self-worth until the end. The other professional actors fare better - Shaun Toub (Tony Stark's savior Yinsen in the current Iron Man) as Baba's business partner Rahim Khan, who holds the key to the truth; Atossa Leoni quietly affecting as Soraya; and best of all, Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi who brings pride and dignity to Baba. Three young non-professionals were recruited from Kabul's school system to play the key child roles, and all are quite good. Zekeria Ebrahimi is up to the challenge of the toughest part as young Amir, and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is poignant as Hassan's nearly catatonic son Sohrab. But it's the sad-eyed, moon-faced Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada who will break your heart as the young Hassan, especially in the devastating pomegranate-throwing scene. It's fair to say his performance is on par with the young Enzo Staiola's in Vittorio de Sica's classicBicycle Thieves.The technical aspects are well done, in particular, Roberto Schaefer's clean cinematography (western China convincingly substitutes for Afghanistan), Alberto Iglesias' evocative score, and even the CGI effects showcasing the kites in turbulent flight. The 2008 DVD has a solid set of extras beginning with an insightful commentary from Forster, Hosseini, and Benioff, although some of their dialogue seems rather forced. There are two featurettes included - the first is the 14-minute ""Words from the Kite Runner"", which focuses on Hosseini's connection to the story and the development of the novel, and the second is the 25-minute ""Images from the Kite Runner"", a more standard behind-the-scenes look at the production.  Rounding out the extras are the original theatrical trailer, a few previews, and a PSA from Hosseini on how to help the Afghans during their current time of need.",4,Cinematic Adaptation of Hosseini's

Still remember the phrase that coming to America from Afghanistan was like ""lifting a person from the certainty of turmoil to dropping this person in the turmoil of uncertainty.""While the book opened our eyes to yet another human struggle for freedom, opportunity and the pursuit of happiness, the DVD brought the story to life.The characters are much like those imagined while reading the book and the story still shares the struggle and emotional turmoil lived by the families. This is the story of Amir, the son of a business man from Kabul, and a servant boy by the name of Hassan. The boys grow up experiencing the simple joys of life, involved in the adventures of running kites and sharing stories of past generations, learning a way of life that comes to an abrupt end.The choices made by Amir define his character as a coward, disloyal to the best friend he shall ever have. While I don't want to give the story away, the writer and the producer weave an amazing web of unspeakable betrayal that keeps viewers engaged in the struggle of Amir to redeem and find forgiveness for the sins of the past.This quest for redemption brings him back to Afghanistan to rescue the son of his friend Hassan. His country is now under Taliban rule, and through the story we learn about his war destroyed native land. Don't miss it, learn from the author the great lessons that in order to live and confront life... we should not keep secrets, however painful these are, and we should delve on our past to fully understand who we are... where we come from, and the choices made by our ancestors.

If the film was in English, a lot of the realism would be lost and the story wouldn't have been as effective.The two young boys who were chosen to play the role of Amir and Hassan were well-cast. The characters are best friends living in a household where Amir is the son of the rich owner of the house and the Hassan is the son of the house keeper; the class differences become an important factor in the story. The boys appear to have an inseparable friendship, they go to the cinema together and fly kites in competitions. An event occurs (I don't want to ruin the film for those who haven't seen it) in which Amir's strength of character and loyalty is tested. His actions, or lack there-of, will severely affect the friendship between the boys and they will never be the same again.

All actors, directors and artists, have the right to convey their art in their own way.  While your tastes and theirs may differ, afford them that one courtesy.That being said...I must say that this was an excellent movie.I loved its quiet dignity.  All the beautiful emotions of the human spirit were evocatively portrayed with such emotional subtlety in this well-written, well-acted but uplifting drama.Viewing through the eyes of an  Afghani, we see his childhood as he remembered it.  The tender friendship between him and his best friend Hassan are as realistic as any 11-year-old boy could have flying a kite or reading a story he had put together.  Like all boys, they had dreams, pleasures, uncertainties and great hobbies.  It would be great to see more films like this rather than a slew of movies about middle easterners as terrorists as seems to be the trend lately in Hollywood films.Male-figures in Amir's life played a strong role in shaping him as a man.  I like this.  It reminds us we are human through our interaction with others.  No person is born a lone wolf or solo hero as often is told in modern American stories.  The relationship between Amir and his father is wonderfully portrayed. His father is not a  man who's afraid to stand up for what's right and deeply wishes his own son were the same.  You watch as Amir quietly struggles to find the same courage in himself, but the love between them is as close and endearing as ever.Some people will become easily bored by this film because it isn't glossy or fast-paced.

Olmedo,"[1, 1]","I read both of Khaled Hosseini's books about Afghanistan, ""The Kite Runner"" and ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"", and I was really looking forward to seeing the movie version of the ""The Kite Runner"". It was actually a very good movie, and quite true to the events in the book. The child actors were quite good, and Homayoun Ershadi in the role of Baba (Amir's father) was excellent. He played a very complex role -- a man of honor with a secret, a father who does not fully understand how his son feels about him, and a refugee from his country who refuses to let hardship and fear compromise his beliefs.The movie is very beautifully shot, and the contrast between the Kabul of Amir's childhood and what it looks like after years of war is stunning.On the downside, I felt that the close relationship between the two young boys was never really established well enough in the film. I realize that this is probably due to time constraints -- there are always sacrifices a director must make when trying to tell the story while keeping a film a reasonable length. But the problem here is that Amir's betrayal of his friend ends up seeming somewhat less sigificant, and the impact this has Amir's life going forward is a very important part of the story.I also thought the director could have chosen to explore parts of the story that were told to Amir later in the book, like Hassan's life in Afghanistan after Amir left, in a more visual way. This was probably purposely omitted in the book, since it's told from Amir's perspective -- I'm convinced that the author wants us to feel the same ""loss"" of connection to that world that Amir experienced. However, I thought the movie might have satisfied this curiousity a bit more for the audience -- I saw this as a missed opportunity to provide a more rich texture within the film.I would certainly recommend this movie, but I have a much higher recommendation to anyone reading this review to actually pick up these great books, and really enjoy the rich storytelling. Overall, I think they will have a much more satisfying experience than watching this film adaptation. I know it's cliche, but while the movie is quite good in it's own right, I think it had trouble living up to the high expectations of readers.",4,"A good movie, but for real enjoyment, read the books...",1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,2256,"['read', 'Khaled', 'Hosseini', 'books', 'Afghanistan', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'Thousand', 'Splendid', 'Suns', 'was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'version', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'quite', 'true', 'events', 'book', 'child', 'actors', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'role', 'Baba', 'Amir', 'father', 'was', 'excellent', 'played', 'very', 'complex', 'role', 'man', 'honor', 'secret', 'father', 'who', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'how', 'son', 'feels', 'refugee', 'country', 'who', 'let', 'hardship', 'fear', 'compromise', 'beliefs.The', 'movie', 'very', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'contrast', 'Kabul', 'Amir', 'childhood', 'what', 'years', 'war', 'downside', 'felt', 'close', 'relationship', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'established', 'well', 'enough', 'film', 'realize', 'probably', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'are', 'always', 'director', 'must', 'make', 'when', 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'keeping', 'film', 'reasonable', 'length', 'problem', 'here', 'Amir', 'betrayal', 'friend', 'up', 'seeming', 'somewhat', 'less', 'sigificant', 'impact', 'Amir', 'life', 'going', 'forward', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'story.I', 'also', 'thought', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'explore', 'parts', 'story', 'were', 'told', 'Amir', 'later', 'book', 'Hassan', 'life', 'Afghanistan', 'Amir', 'left', 'more', 'visual', 'way', 'was', 'probably', 'purposely', 'omitted', 'book', 'told', 'Amir', 'perspective', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'author', 'feel', 'same', 'loss', 'connection', 'world', 'Amir', 'experienced', 'However', 'thought', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'satisfied', 'curiousity', 'bit', 'more', 'audience', 'saw', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'provide', 'more', 'rich', 'texture', 'film.I', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'have', 'much', 'higher', 'recommendation', 'anyone', 'reading', 'review', 'actually', 'pick', 'up', 'great', 'books', 'really', 'enjoy', 'rich', 'storytelling', 'Overall', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'watching', 'film', 'adaptation', 'know', 'cliche', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'own', 'right', 'think', 'had', 'trouble', 'living', 'up', 'high', 'expectations', 'readers']",N/A
1132093,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B0011P4X8S,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[2, 4]","A very powerful adapation of the novel but (predictably and understandably) without nearly the punch that the book provided. The screening was sold out and we had to resort to those awful front row seats I so despise. But after a few minutes of figuring out how to position myself without my neck snapping off, while trying to read the subtitles, I settled in just fine for the rest of the ride.Performances by the entire cast are wonderful, making the characters from the page come alive in a way that matched my perception of them from the page.  A particularly exciting new find is Scottish Egyptian actor, Khalid Abadalla as the adult Amir (who's only other film role was one of the terrorists in United 93).  His major role debut as Amir is rather amazing, almost everything from this character coming through in his eyes, etched onto his face and telling body language.  This is an actor to watch out for in the future.Also unknown to me was Homayoun Ershadi who, as Baba, struck absolutely every note perfectly. Here was the fierceness, the love, the myriad complexities of a larger than life personality reduced in his station in life, but who hangs on to his pride. I can only imagine how many Babas shared similar fates at the hands of the Russians, and then the Taliban.The screenplay leaves out many of the horrors told in the book, but remains mostly faithful with very few changes.  I believe the dropping of several key scenes to be a mistake which would have increased the emotional impact and aided in the understanding of the harrowing conditions experienced by all of the characters, while not unduly lengthening the running time. The departure of Hassan and his father, while touching here, is, in the novel, absolutely shattering, and I recall how when reading it, I fell completely apart.  In the film, their departing feels merely a minor downer.  Additionally, the escape from Kabul, which takes dozens of pages in the novel, on screen lasts for perhaps a minute.The controversial rape scene, the fulcrum on which the central story turns, was done as tastefully as possible, its real horrors showing up in the repercussions and aftermath of it and its victim, Hassan's silence.Both Afghani boys, Zekeria Ebrahimi as Amir, and Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada as Hassan, gave galvanizing, understated and entirely riveting performances. I now fully understand why the producers rejected the thousands of American child actors who auditioned, and took the risk of using these two beautiful children. Both performances were devoid of any Hollywood ""forced talent"" feel that too often mars (at least for me) the performances of so many Hollywood child actors.There are no big budget special effects, no big names, yet the film is filled with magic and hope and a glimpse into the horrors millions of Afghanis have faced for far too many decades.Alberto Iglesias's soundtrack is a must have for me. The music plays an important part in setting the tone, as a soundtrack always should, but never overwhelms the storytelling, or even threatens to. It's mixture of Middle Eastern and Western neo-classical was beautiful, and the song (in English) sung when Amir visits a Mosque, in Kabul, to pray for the first time, gave me gooseflesh and got me pretty weepy. Powerful stuff.As we left the auditorium, almost no one else moved and seeing their faces head on couldn't help notice that most of those still seated were wiping away tears.It isn't perfect, but young German/Swiss filmmaker, Marc Foster, in his 4th big picture continues on a roll: Monster's Ball, Stranger Than Fiction, and Finding Neverland, seems to be the kind of movie maker I enjoy most: a great storyteller.",4,The Kite Runner Soars,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,3681,"['very', 'powerful', 'adapation', 'novel', 'predictably', 'understandably', 'nearly', 'punch', 'book', 'provided', 'screening', 'was', 'sold', 'out', 'had', 'resort', 'awful', 'front', 'row', 'seats', 'so', 'despise', 'few', 'minutes', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'position', 'neck', 'snapping', 'off', 'trying', 'read', 'subtitles', 'settled', 'just', 'fine', 'rest', 'ride.Performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'wonderful', 'making', 'characters', 'page', 'come', 'alive', 'way', 'matched', 'perception', 'page', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'new', 'find', 'Scottish', 'Egyptian', 'actor', 'Khalid', 'Abadalla', 'adult', 'Amir', 'who', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'role', 'was', 'one', 'terrorists', 'United', '93', 'major', 'role', 'debut', 'Amir', 'rather', 'amazing', 'almost', 'everything', 'character', 'coming', 'eyes', 'etched', 'face', 'telling', 'body', 'language', 'actor', 'watch', 'out', 'future.Also', 'unknown', 'was', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'who', 'Baba', 'struck', 'absolutely', 'note', 'perfectly', 'Here', 'was', 'fierceness', 'love', 'myriad', 'complexities', 'larger', 'life', 'personality', 'reduced', 'station', 'life', 'who', 'pride', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'many', 'Babas', 'shared', 'similar', 'fates', 'hands', 'Russians', 'then', 'Taliban.The', 'screenplay', 'out', 'many', 'horrors', 'told', 'book', 'mostly', 'faithful', 'very', 'few', 'changes', 'believe', 'dropping', 'several', 'key', 'scenes', 'be', 'mistake', 'would', 'have', 'increased', 'emotional', 'impact', 'aided', 'understanding', 'harrowing', 'conditions', 'experienced', 'characters', 'not', 'unduly', 'lengthening', 'running', 'time', 'departure', 'Hassan', 'father', 'touching', 'here', 'novel', 'absolutely', 'shattering', 'recall', 'how', 'when', 'reading', 'fell', 'completely', 'apart', 'film', 'departing', 'feels', 'merely', 'minor', 'downer', 'Additionally', 'escape', 'Kabul', 'dozens', 'pages', 'novel', 'screen', 'lasts', 'perhaps', 'minute.The', 'controversial', 'rape', 'scene', 'fulcrum', 'central', 'story', 'turns', 'was', 'done', 'as', 'tastefully', 'possible', 'real', 'horrors', 'showing', 'up', 'repercussions', 'aftermath', 'victim', 'Hassan', 'silence.Both', 'Afghani', 'Zekeria', 'Ebrahimi', 'Amir', 'Ahmad', 'Khan', 'Mahmidzada', 'Hassan', 'gave', 'galvanizing', 'understated', 'entirely', 'riveting', 'performances', 'now', 'fully', 'understand', 'why', 'producers', 'rejected', 'thousands', 'American', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'auditioned', 'took', 'risk', 'using', 'two', 'beautiful', 'children', 'performances', 'were', 'devoid', 'Hollywood', 'forced', 'talent', 'feel', 'too', 'often', 'least', 'performances', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'child', 'are', 'big', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'big', 'names', 'yet', 'film', 'filled', 'magic', 'hope', 'glimpse', 'horrors', 'millions', 'Afghanis', 'have', 'faced', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'decades.Alberto', 'Iglesias', 'soundtrack', 'must', 'have', 'music', 'important', 'part', 'setting', 'tone', 'soundtrack', 'always', 'should', 'never', 'overwhelms', 'storytelling', 'even', 'mixture', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'Western', 'neo-classical', 'was', 'beautiful', 'song', 'English', 'sung', 'when', 'Amir', 'Mosque', 'Kabul', 'pray', 'first', 'time', 'gave', 'gooseflesh', 'got', 'pretty', 'weepy', 'Powerful', 'stuff.As', 'left', 'auditorium', 'almost', 'one', 'else', 'moved', 'seeing', 'head', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'most', 'still', 'seated', 'were', 'wiping', 'away', 'tears.It', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'young', 'German/Swiss', 'filmmaker', 'Marc', 'Foster', '4th', 'big', 'picture', 'roll', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'be', 'kind', 'movie', 'maker', 'enjoy', 'most', 'great', 'storyteller']",N/A
1132094,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0011P4X8S,Grady Harp,"[71, 88]","Khaled Hosseini's THE KITE RUNNER was one of those first novels that captured both public interest and the hearts of the many who read this story of childhood unconditional love and redemption set against three stormy decades in Afghanistan.  Though Hosseini was approached about the story's adaptation to the screen soon after the novel was published, there seems to have been a rush to get the visual form of the poetic novel before the audience, a journey besieged by unsuspected political  intervention and criticism by the Afghan government.  But after seeing the film, this intrigue heightens the intent of those involved in translating the book to film - writer David Benioff and director Marc Forster.People may argue both sides of whether or not the dialog be in Afghan languages (Dari, Pashtu,Urdu) with English subtitles or be in English throughout: the choice of using both languages is severely hampered by the decision to place the Afghan translations in an overlay on the screen while the English subtitles are place off the viewing field.  A small point, perhaps, but one that makes the first viewing of the film difficult to follow visually.  As far as the actors are concerned, the two young lads who were chosen to portray Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada) are perfect: closest of friends living in a household where one (Amir) is the son of the master of the house and the other (Hassan) is the son of the grounds and house keeper - a factor that serves to underline class differences that will later become increasingly poignant.  The boys are inseparable, reading stories together and flying kites in competitions - each lad specializing in one of those pastimes.  But disaster crumbles the boys' victory in the kite flying contest when Hassan is beaten and raped  by the town bullies while Amir cowardly runs for safety, deserting his friend.  Suddenly the Russians invade and that change factors into the need for Amir and his father to move to America where Amir is educated and becomes a writer. Twenty years pass.  After the fall of Afghanistan to the Russians and subsequently to the Taliban, Amir (now actor Khalid Abdalla) receives a telephone plea from Hassan's father to return to Kabul. Amir, now married and a successful writer, feels the need to return to amend for his past omission as well as to assuage Amir's fears.  When he arrives in Kabul he encounters  a war torn country he no longer recognizes, discovers past secrets as to his and Hassan's true identities, and sets out on a journey to bring closure to a childhood love and promise.  It is a touching tale of redemption and the strongest echo of the magic of the novel.THE KITE RUNNER as both novel and film will appeal to all audiences sensitive to scars that wars leave on children and adults alike.  For this viewer the film lacks the intensity of the book in that the time spent with the childhood of the two boys feels secondary to the personal journey of the adult Amir.  But that is not to say the film is less powerful in the end: the story is one that leaves an imprint on the audience that last long past the ending credits.

I specify Americans only because, as one myself, I am all too familiar with our overall ignorance of the actual people living and dying in the Middle East, despite the war going on there.  While this film doesn't depend on that, since it's a story that in many ways could take place anywhere, it does provide a great inside look at the many layers of the Afghan culture and the challenges they face every day.Above and beyond that, this is also simply a very well told, well acted, and skillfully directed film.  The keenly nuanced performance of Khalid Abdalla is exceptional throughout, as are the performances of all the main characters.  There is some explicit violence, so keep that in mind if you intend to show it to your family, but that's also a key part of what the protagonist is striving to overcome, so there's no getting around it.So...why buy the DVD instead of just renting it?  Well, mostly because the Special Features on this DVD are exceptional.  While a lot of movie DVDs show ""behind the scenes"" activities, the nature of this story lends itself to a lot of terrific back story reflecting0 the Afghan culture they are trying to capture in the film, as well as showing and discussing areas where the actual filming took place and the cultural challenges involved in that.

The story is pretty much the same except, as with most adapted screenplays, some parts from the book are taken out to keep the movie from being too long. I think there is one dramatic part that happens towards the end of the novel that wasn't shown in the movie (I don't want to say what part that is just in case you haven't read it), but all the other major parts from the novel are in the movie. Also, if you've read the book closely, then you can probably understand a lot of what goes on in the movie without the subtitles--even if you don't know a word of Farsi.I really do think the movie was great. In fact, even though I knew what was going to happen, the violent parts of the movie were still shocking to me. However, there is just something impressive about the novel that the movie lacks. It could be because the novel was just so well-written that a movie couldn't have done it justice, at least not perfectly.

But I enjoyed the movie and it came across to me as a complete story on its own. It is also a very timely story, what with all that is going on in the world today. It was interesting to see the contrasts with the movie starting a couple decades back.The kids playing Amir and Hassan were excellent. Not that I could understand the words, but the acting seemed sincere and well-done. I was just horrified at the Hassan attack scene and Amir running away, and that it led to the ruin of their friendship. They had been so inseparable it seemed they would be friends for life. How could you not run in and at least attempt to save your friend? Or at least not attempt to patch up your friendship later? Well, you have to remember he was just a little boy, and keep watching the movie from there. It was very disturbing though.The movie redeemed itself from there. Amir tried to move on with his life. He also tried to redeem himself. I thought it was a shame we never got to see more of Hassan. He was a very strong character and could have accomplished things. The ending was good. Kind of sad, but the best that could have happened under the circumstances.The kite flying scenes were beautiful. Exciting even! I never knew you could do all that with a kite. I was a bit disappointed to see in the special features that they used CGI kites instead of real kites. Always taking the easy way out these days.It would be nice if the movie had stated it was not in English. The trailer showed no non-English scenes and the back of the DVD says it IS in English.

Still, I found the movie extremely low-key and (for a movie that includes several graphic assaults) directed without much passion. The story revolves around two boys -- master and servant -- who grow up in the same Kabul household. Bookish Ali and Hassan, his devoted friend and servant, often play together in the streets of Kabul. Competitive kite flying -- in which the object is to cut the string of one's opponent's kite -- is a favorite pastime. Hassan is Ali's kite runner -- the boy who runs after the fallen trophies. One day, Hassan is attacked by a group of older boys while Ali watches, too frightened to come to his friend's aid. Ali's sense of shame only compounds the sense of unworthiness laid down by his father's dismissiveness. After the Soviets invade the country in 1976, the boys are separated for years, until a phone call urges Ali back to his home country.The basic plot of the ""Kite Runner"" is exciting and harrowing, and has been captured adequately in this adaptation. Readers of the book, like my wife, will not be pleased with how much of the story's richness has been left out of the movie. I didn't mind this as much, not having read the book, but I did note the movie's sluggish pace and set-piece feel. While Hassan was played superbly by Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada, the quiet and slightly-built Homayoun Ershadi was miscast Ali's powerful father. The film did try to replace the missing plot details with visuals of the Afghan countryside, but these were not especially inspiring or instructive. However, the effects used to render the flight of the fighting kites were eye-catching.Not a bad film, but definitely one you should skip in lieu of the book.",3,Flaccid adaptation of a great story,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,1799,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'so', 'had', 'expectations', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'would', 'compare', 'book', 'Still', 'found', 'movie', 'extremely', 'low-key', 'movie', 'several', 'graphic', 'assaults', 'directed', 'much', 'passion', 'story', 'around', 'two', 'boys', 'master', 'servant', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'same', 'Kabul', 'household', 'Bookish', 'Ali', 'Hassan', 'devoted', 'friend', 'servant', 'often', 'play', 'together', 'streets', 'Kabul', 'Competitive', 'kite', 'flying', 'object', 'cut', 'string', 'one', 'opponent', 'kite', 'favorite', 'pastime', 'Hassan', 'Ali', 'kite', 'runner', 'boy', 'who', 'fallen', 'trophies', 'One', 'day', 'Hassan', 'attacked', 'group', 'older', 'boys', 'Ali', 'watches', 'too', 'frightened', 'come', 'friend', 'aid', 'Ali', 'sense', 'shame', 'only', 'sense', 'unworthiness', 'laid', 'down', 'father', 'dismissiveness', 'Soviets', 'invade', 'country', '1976', 'boys', 'are', 'separated', 'years', 'phone', 'call', 'Ali', 'back', 'home', 'country.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'exciting', 'harrowing', 'been', 'captured', 'adequately', 'adaptation', 'Readers', 'book', 'wife', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'pleased', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'richness', 'been', 'left', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'much', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'did', 'note', 'movie', 'sluggish', 'pace', 'set-piece', 'feel', 'Hassan', 'was', 'played', 'superbly', 'Ahmad', 'Khan', 'Mahmidzada', 'quiet', 'slightly-built', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'was', 'miscast', 'Ali', 'powerful', 'father', 'film', 'did', 'try', 'replace', 'missing', 'plot', 'details', 'visuals', 'Afghan', 'countryside', 'were', 'not', 'especially', 'inspiring', 'instructive', 'However', 'effects', 'used', 'render', 'flight', 'fighting', 'kites', 'were', 'eye-catching.Not', 'bad', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'should', 'skip', 'lieu', 'book']",N/A

I read the book a year and a half ago, which sets me up perfectly to enjoy an on-screen adaptation of the book (My recipe for success in this area?  Read book.  Love book so much that I want more.  Let time pass -- at least a year -- so that the details of the book have softened in my mind.  Watch movie.).It truly is a beautiful movie -- the type that plays out wonderfully in high-definition format. There are also some great special features, including interviews with the director and the author of the book, which I enjoyed. Khaled Hosseini is even featured in the commentary on the movie (that I haven't watched yet), which shows his active role in adapting his book to the screen.He's pleased with the movie. Yes, there is a lot cut out, but there are no significant changes, so even book purists will probably be pleased with this movie.There are even elements that play out better on screen. Somehow Hassan's loyalty seems more real and less archetypical.  I am physically reminded of Amir's youth at the time he makes the regrettable decisions.If you've avoided this story because of its difficult content, I recommend this movie to you.

Based on the acclaimed bestselling novel by Khaled Hosseini, the film is epic in scope, spanning a number of decades, continents, and cultures, and yet it remains intimate and personal in terms of its characters and their stories.  It is spectacularly photographed, sensitively directed, hauntingly scored, and impeccably acted by a brilliant cast whose performances are meticulously nuanced.  Even the opening credit sequence is fascinating, foreshadowing through calligraphy the differences in Western and Middle Eastern culture that will be a subtheme of the movie.The story opens in 21st century San Francisco, where a young man from Afghanistan (the charismatic Khalid Abdalla as Amir) has just published his first novel.  In flashbacks, he recalls his childhood in Afghanistan, and particularly his relationship with his best friend Hassan, the child of his father's oldest friend and live-in servant.  The two boys (played by Zekeria Ebrahemi and Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada, both of whom turn in performances of amazing depth) are eventually driven apart by an act of childish cowardice by the young Amir.  They lose contact all together after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, at which time Amir and his father (Homayon Ashadi in a wonderfully understated performance) flee to Pakistan and then eventually to America.  Years pass, and then, finally, the adult Amir is provided with an opportunity to redeem himself.

Happily, Marc Forster (who also directed ""Finding Neverland"", ""Monster's Ball"", and is currently set to direct the 22nd James Bond film) and company satisfied even the most demanding members of the audience, as ripples of gentle laughter gave way to surpised gasps and finally to unsentimental tears as the story unfolded.

I kind of feel sorry for the American Troops over there who have to put up with living in such a backwater. So then we have two boys named Hassan and Amir. One is a rich spoiled kid and the other is a peasant. Bad things often happen to poor  people  and this movie is no exception. Poor little Hassan gets raped by this bully who  is either a child molester or a homsoexual or both. Then  Amir runs away  instead of defending him. What are good friends for may I ask? Then Amir can't stand to be around Hassan anymore because he is a constant  reminder  of what a  coward  he really is. Then the movie turns into some sort of existential common man search for meaning, salvation and redemption and Hassan is living in America by that  time and  goes back to his crappy homeland for forgiveness or God knows what.By this point of the movie I couldn't care less. Then  he tries to adopt a kid and gets  beaten up which he enjoys cos it makes him feel better. This part of the movie only makes sense of you can understand the concept of guilt riden masochism . Then by golly gee it all works out for Amir in the end and he gets to fly his kite with some local kids.

I didn't know people were still allowed to tell stories like this. Rich, complex, completely rooted in history and experience yet personal, and a completely human and fully participatory protagonist. Add to that a plot twist followed by a good old fashioned surprise ending and epilogue (counterbalanced by a prologue) and you've got a tale of the satisfying, old fashioned kind. In this case, there's also a strong screen play, with six critical events in the story happening, like clockwork, every 20 minutes. It's the sort of attention to pacing that makes the great Persian Epic of the Kings (Shahnamah) that they boys read from in the movie work, and it makes modern story telling work as well. So, enough with the 'it's not like the book' and 'it's in a foreign language.' It isn't a book; it's is a great film story, told simply, straighforwardly. And criticizing a movie for being in a foreign language, or in black and white, or filmed on a set instead of on location is like criticizing a book for being divided into chapters or printed in sans serif type on white paper--it's the way the creative artists in question have chosen to tell the tale.

1132119,A3F9VH8916IA40,B0011P4X8S,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[36, 39]","Khaled Hosseini's novelThe Kite Runneris one of the most moving books of the modern era, a story that has touched the lives of countless millions across the world. Published in over 30 countries, The Kite Runner is at the same time one of the most touching and heartbreaking stories ever written and an educational read which will open your eyes to the history and culture of a country few can even find on a map. It is, needless to say, a fascinating read which opens the reader's eyes to the beauty and devastation which is Afghanistan.When I heard that there was a film adaptation coming out based on this magnificent novel I had my doubts on whether or not it could actually be done. The book isn't heavy on action or suspense; instead most of the depth and the meat of the story is told though exposition, in the mind of the main character and would be extremely difficult, if not down right impossible, to film. The strength of the story lay in its rich three-dimensional characters which are very hard to transfer from the pages of a book to the big screen.For what it is the movie adaptation of The Kite Runner really isn't that bad a film. I'm not sure how someone who has never read the book would react to this film because quite frankly I am in love with Hosseini's writing. The film may actually be quite entertaining for one who isn't familiar with the book, and if that is the case by all means to not allow this review to damper your desire to pick up a copy of this movie, but for someone who has invested time and energy (both very well spent) on reading the book and getting to know the characters the film adaptation will seen bland, unemotional, and lacking the depth and heart which made the book such an epic masterpiece. Although for the most part the dialogue stays true to the book, it cuts parts out which should have stayed in. for instance when Baba is confronting the Russian soldier in the book he cries out ""war doesn't negate decency"" but that is only half of what he said, the whole quote goes, ""war doesn't negate decency, it demands it."" It's a very subtle difference but it does change the meaning of the scene.There is also a lot left out of the film which, in my opinion, should have made their way in one way or another. If you haven't read the book you have no idea that Assefs mother is from Germany and that his hero is Adolph Hitler, even his famous brass knuckles which are such terrifying symbol in the book are left out completely. Hassan's cleft lip is gone, Ali's crippled right leg left on the cutting room floor. The film moves so fast though the flashbacks in the beginning, where the emotional impact is felt the most in the novel, that all depth is sucked right out of it. The characters aren't fully developed, their motivations left unexplored and unexplained.The film simply goes too fast to be able to explore the depth of the characters in a way they deserved. Too many details about the characters are left out, too many important events skimmed over, too little detail poured into explaining everyone's motivations. The friction between the different ethnic groups, the Pashtuns and the Hazara's, so vital to the message of the book, is used as nothing more then a plot device and no attempt is made to educate the public on just what these groups are. Honestly how many people know what the difference is? And yet without knowing the history of these groups and their backgrounds the story looses a lot of its driving force.Not to say this film doesn't have its high points. No matter how much time and effort a writer pours into his or her story they can never match the detail that a simple picture can bring. Seeing Afghanistan in ruins, the burnt out tanks, the men hanging from trees as warnings, the berka clad women being stoned to death in the most brutal of ways, brought a new light to Hosseini's novel, and for that I thank this film. Being able to see the nation of Afghanistan outside of news footage of the war and one bad Rambo movie brought new light to that nation's peril. But the most fascination aspect of this movie are, of all things, the kits from which the novel and film get their names. the scenes with the boys and later with Amir as an adult flying kites were moving, spectacular, and haunting all at the same time. Who knew seeing a kite flying majestically in the sky could be so moving?If you haven't read the book, you may like, nay maybe even love this film, but for those of you who have, like me, this movie will feel watered down, rushed, and lacking the same depth and emotion as the brilliant novel. Its still a good movie, don't get me wrong, but there is simply too much left out. I've always thought The Kite Runner was an un-filmable book, it simply is too deep to recreate in a satisfactory way on the big screen. If you haven't read the book, go for it, if you have then get ready for a disappointment.Replay value; moderate.",3,For You a Thousand Times Over,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,4931,"['Khaled',

1132133,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0011P4X8S,Linda Linguvic,"[80, 84]","I read this book a few years ago and loved it.  And, frankly, I was worried that the filmmakers might ruin the movie.  That silly worry of mine sure was wrong though.  I know it doesn't seem possible, but the movie was even better than the book.  I think that it was because the act of reading allowed me to put the book down and pick it up at a later time.  The movie, however, is right there, in your face, and doesn't give the viewer any reprieve from the compelling plot or the constant tension.  I knew the story of course, and during one of the crucial scenes I found myself crying real tears even before one particular awful scene happened.  And then I watched it in horror in full living color, knowing what would happen next and understanding that there were no easy answers.This is the story of a friendship between two boys in Afghanistan.  It starts in the 1970's before the Communists and before the Taliban.  Life was complex enough then even without the awful politics which came later.  Amir was the only son of a wealthy businessman and rather shy.  Hassan was the son of a servant and of a lower class social group. Amir and Hassan shared a deep friendship despite the social differences between them and were a team in one of the big events in their town - a kite flying contest.  At the very moment of victory though, there is a tragic act of aggression against Hassan which changes the relationship between the two boys forever.  Each of the boys suffers in his own way.  For Amir, it affects his life forever.  All of this is set against an historical background of Afghanistan when it was secular and modern, especially for the upper classes.  Women were free to go around unveiled.  Books of all kind were available, although, shamefully, boys like Hassan were not taught to read.Then the world turned topsy turvy.  Amir and his father had to flee for their lives and wound up in California.  Amir marries, becomes a writer.  And then, now, twenty years later, he receives a call from his father's friend who has fled to Pakistan.  ""You must come back"" is the message.  This is the time of the Taliban.  Life is horrible in Afghanistan.  But Amir, now a man, is given the opportunity to do an heroic act.  How this all plays out is scary and uplifting and real.  I was sitting at the edge of my seat in the movie theater even though I knew how it would all turn out.I loved this film.  The casting was excellent.  Filmed in California and China, all of the actors seemed to be Afghanistani  and the dialog was in Dari, Pashtu, Urdu and Russian as well as English.  I particularly liked the performance of Homayoun Ershadi who played the father with wisdom and strength even when his fortune was reversed and he worked at a convenience store in California and sold merchandise at a flea market on weekends.  There is a sense of authenticity throughout.  Mostly, though, it was the theme that drove the film, a universal theme of sin and redemption and how a person can have a second chance to go from cowardice to courage.I live in New York City and the film opened in one of the art theaters.  This might mean that it may never go mainstream.  If this is true, it is a shame.  The film was a winner all the way.  Yes, it is disturbing and might just haunt your dreams.  Clearly, it is for adults only too.  In spite of all the horror though, it ends with an inspiring and uplifting note.  Don't miss this very important film.  I give it my very highest recommendation.",5,Courage in the face of adversity and a second chance at redemption.

There is no political message, just a human one. Since it begins in a country which is mostly Muslim, there would be a tendency to treat the principles as less than they are. How much does the average American actually know about Afghanistan? The treatment this film received, in telling the story which was first released as a book, is exceptionally informative. The caste system is placed alongside center stage, so that one can see the effect it has in Afghan Society (prior to the Soviet invasion). The system also caused the barbarity seen during Taliban rule.The story of the two principles, is one of love, faithfulness, betrayal and redemption. I would caution readers to not look too far for more information to this story, except to read the book the film is based on.

1132139,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0011P4X8S,Mark Baker,"[14, 19]","Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) and Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada) are two boys growing up in 1970's Afghanistan.  Even though Hassan is the son of Amir's family servant, the two are close friends.  They even make a great team in the annual kite tournament, and Hassan has shown a remarkable talent for chasing the fallen kites.Tragedy strikes the boys during the winter of 1978, however, when Amir witnesses the neighborhood bullies performing an unspeakable act on Hassan.  Racked with guilt, Amir withdraws from Hassan.When the Soviets invade Afghanistan, Amir and his Baba (Homayoun Ershadi) move to San Francisco.  As an adult, Amir (now played by Khalid Abdalla) has managed to put his past behind him.  Until a phone call brings it all back.  What will he do now?When I finally read the novel this movie is based on, I found it rather slow and predictable.  I thought I might enjoy the movie better since it would have to streamline the plot.  In the end, I was glad I read the book first since the movie glosses over several events that really set things up early on.  There was enough there to make the movie work, but the complex themes of relationships, regret, forgiveness, prejudice, and revenge don't come across as strongly as they could.  One key plot point near the end is completely absent.  While it would have added extra time to an already two hour movie, it makes the last 10 or 15 minutes needlessly confusing.That's not to say I wasn't impacted emotionally.  The further into the movie I got, the more I cared about the outcome.  I even found myself fighting back tears a couple times.The movie is almost all in Farsi with English sub-titles.  Even when the setting moves to San Francisco, at least half of the scenes are sub-titled.  Once or twice, the lines moved so quickly I couldn't keep up, but it didn't bother me otherwise.The cast of relative unknowns is wonderful.  Personally, I find the boys fine but wooden, like they were reciting lines with little emotion behind them.  But that could easily be because I was too busy trying to read the sub-titles to watch them too closely.The kite flying scenes are magical.  While obviously computer generated, they are more elaborate then I expected and brought a smile to my face.The movie handles the tough scenes with grace.

1132142,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0011P4X8S,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 6]","The Kite Runner is a moving story about two young boys of different classes who get along great as brothers would. The two youths, named Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi as the young Amir; Khalid Abdalla as the grown up Amir) and Hassan, play together and fly kites in the sky, one of the few pastimes for children in Afghanistan in the late 1970s. Look also for an excellent performance by Homayoun Ershadi as Baba, Amir's father and Atossa Leoni as Soraya, the woman Amir eventually marries.Over time in Afghanistan it becomes abundantly clear that Amir is jealous of Hassan because Hassan gets so much moral support and affection from Amir's father. Hassan and his father live in Baba's home and Hassan's father is a servant to Baba and Amir.Over time, older kids do Hassan a great deal of bodily harm that is not at all pleasant; they are bullies who, like many people living in Afghanistan at the time, believe that Hassan is from a lower class of person and therefore it doesn't matter if they abuse him--he deserves it in their eyes. Amir could have helped Hassan when Hassan is badly harmed but instead Amir runs away like a coward. Amir eventually gets rid of Hassan and Hassan's father by making it look like Hassan stole a watch from Amir. This terrible deed slowly but surely sets things up for a situation in which a grown, mature Amir needs to rid himself of his guilt and redeem himself by doing a good and wonderful deed for Hassan's son.When the former Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in 1979, Amir and his father must leave the country at once to avoid being killed by the Communists. They eventually wind up in America; but Hassan and his father remain in Afghanistan.Years pass--and then Amir gets a phone call to come to Pakistan because things aren't going well. Amir goes there right away to help; and he wants to meet Hassan's son anyway.Yes, Amir does go to Afghanistan. However, I won't provide any plot spoilers for you. What happens if Amir finally meets Hassan after all these years? What about Hassan's son--and his other relatives back in Afghanistan? Watch the movie and find out!Unfortunately, the plot development drags and the first hour could have been cut by a good fifteen minutes or even twenty minutes. They take too much time to merely establish that Amir's family is wealthy and that the boys are very good friends. The kite running scenes are beautiful, however. The action in the movie doesn't truly begin until the last half hour of this two hour film; and that disappoints me.The cinematography works wonders especially in the kite flying scenes; and the choreography is marvelous in wedding scenes and more.The Kite Runner is a rather good film; but be prepared to check your watch once or twice during the first hour of the movie. The acting is excellent and indeed everything else is terrific; but The Kite Runner could have been more powerful with a tighter editing job.I highly recommend this film for people interested in moving stories involving relationships over many years; and the movie so often requires subtitles (about 90% of the way) that I would probably classify this as a foreign film. In addition, people of Afghan and Pakistani descent and their relatives may want to see this film.",3,a good film--but the first half needs editing,1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,3239,"['Kite', 'Runner', 'moving', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'different', 'classes', 'who', 'get', 'along', 'great', 'brothers', 'would', 'two', 'youths', 'named', 'Amir', 'Zekeria', 'Ebrahimi', 'young', 'Amir', 'Khalid', 'Abdalla', 'grown', 'up', 'Amir', 'Hassan', 'play', 'together', 'fly', 'kites', 'sky', 'one', 'few', 'pastimes', 'children', 'Afghanistan', 'late', '1970s', 'Look', 'also', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'Baba', 'Amir', 'father', 'Atossa', 'Leoni', 'Soraya', 'woman', 'Amir', 'eventually', 'marries.Over', 'time', 'Afghanistan', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'Amir', 'jealous', 'Hassan', 'Hassan', 'so', 'much', 'moral', 'support', 'affection', 'Amir', 'father', 'Hassan', 'father', 'live', 'Baba', 'home', 'Hassan', 'father', 'servant', 'Baba', 'Amir.Over', 'time', 'older', 'kids', 'do', 'Hassan', 'great', 'deal', 'bodily', 'harm', 'not', 'pleasant', 'are', 'bullies', 'who', 'many', 'people', 'living', 'Afghanistan', 'time', 'believe', 'Hassan', 'lower', 'class', 'person', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'matter', 'abuse', 'eyes', 'Amir', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'Hassan', 'when', 'Hassan', 'badly', 'harmed', 'instead', 'Amir', 'away', 'coward', 'Amir', 'eventually', 'rid', 'Hassan', 'Hassan', 'father', 'making', 'look', 'Hassan', 'stole', 'watch', 'Amir', 'terrible', 'deed', 'slowly', 'surely', 'sets', 'things', 'up', 'situation', 'grown', 'mature', 'Amir', 'rid', 'guilt', 'redeem', 'doing', 'good', 'wonderful', 'deed', 'Hassan', 'son.When', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Afghanistan', '1979', 'Amir', 'father', 'must', 'leave', 'country', 'once', 'avoid', 'being', 'killed', 'Communists', 'eventually', 'wind', 'up', 'America', 'Hassan', 'father', 'remain', 'Afghanistan.Years', 'pass', 'then', 'Amir', 'phone', 'call', 'come', 'Pakistan', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'well', 'Amir', 'there', 'right', 'away', 'help', 'meet', 'Hassan', 'son', 'anyway.Yes', 'Amir', 'go', 'Afghanistan', 'However', 'wo', ""n't"", 'provide', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'What', 'Amir', 'finally', 'Hassan', 'years', 'What', 'Hassan', 'son', 'other', 'relatives', 'back', 'Afghanistan', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'plot', 'development', 'drags', 'first', 'hour', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'good', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'even', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'merely', 'establish', 'Amir', 'family', 'wealthy', 'boys', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'kite', 'running', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'however', 'action', 'movie', ""n't"", 'truly', 'begin', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'me.The', 'cinematography', 'wonders', 'especially', 'kite', 'flying', 'scenes', 'choreography', 'marvelous', 'wedding', 'scenes', 'more.The', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'rather', 'good', 'film', 'be', 'prepared', 'check', 'watch', 'once', 'twice', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'acting', 'excellent', 'indeed', 'everything', 'else', 'terrific', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'powerful', 'tighter', 'editing', 'job.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'moving', 'stories', 'involving', 'relationships', 'many', 'years', 'movie', 'so', 'often', 'subtitles', '90', '%', 'way', 'would', 'probably', 'classify', 'foreign', 'film', 'addition', 'people', 'Afghan', 'Pakistani', 'descent', 'relatives', 'may', 'want', 'see', 'film']",N/A

1132144,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,B0011P4X8S,Medusa,"[0, 1]","The movie tells the story of a childhood friendship in Afghanistan that is interrupted by a sad incident and explores the possibility of redemption and the correction of past mistakes.The scenery and direction of the movie are fascinating, aside from the extremely annoying subtitles which detracted from my enjoyment of the movie:1-They were light with a light back ground.2-They didn't last on the screen long enough to be read3-worst of all , the subtitles had some Islamic words that aren't English as the English translation. for example: an Afghani statement that meant God's willing was translated as inshallah which is the Arabic translation of the Islamic term: God's willing. Aren't subtitles intended to translate to a language the viewer understands? So how about the brilliant idea of writing God's willing instead of Inshallah.Finally, that mistake was fixed and later in the movie, Arabic and different Afghani words were actually translated into English.My initial problem with the story is not the idea of fear or occasional cowardliness or the possibility of redemption, but that the incident that inflicted such immense pain on one of the children is too graphic and cruel. I understand the concept of bullies and evil,  that art and movies should reflect negative aspects as well as positive ones. I can also understand the sexual feelings and curiosities that children might experience and I will understand if a movie focuses on that, but my problem was watching the sexual pain and humiliation inflicted on one child by another child.The sad incident that happen to one of the two friends was actually performed by other kids. Of course, a lot of attention was given in previous movies to sexual predators and evil killers, but the idea of kids inflicting sexual pain at the attacked target (whether it's another child or an animal or any being) is still beyond me.I think the reason movie directors do this far more now than in the past is because we have become immune to simple shocks and subtle implied barbarity. Some times, people need to be shaken in order to wake up.I admittedly confess that cruelty against children upsets me deeply, so I have to accept that scenes of brutality are needed to show the extent of the humiliation and savagery. I will try to be more open minded and focus on the moral issues and the idea of justice and redemption.Now, I'll move to my positive notes and they are actually many:1-I was drawn to continue watching the movie because with the development of the story, one can actually understand the corrupted character of the offensive bully involved in the rape incident, and the child hood incident becomes more convincing as we come to know the perpetrator.2-The actors were great, especially the father (Homayoun Ershadi), but his character seemed to be in conflict with the secret that was revealed later in the story.With a character that is so wise, truthful, and manly, I just find it hard to believe that he would leave Hassan behind and take only Amir. Granted, flaws should be over looked in great works like this movie, so for the great purpose of showing the Taliban's cruelty and immersing the viewer in the Afghani culture, a few plot contradictions must be forgiven.3-Most scenes of the Afghani emigrants were so touching and powerful in showing how all cultures are similar in some ways.The actual prayers in Arabic, the wedding scene, and the father in the bar made me cry and smile at the same time.4-The scenes in Afghanistan and the scenes of Taliban's cruelty were as close to the truth as possible. Showing the actions of this corrupted government was truly brave. Knowing how close this is to the truth should make us really admire this movie.The stoning scene, the child abuse, using religion to manipulate people's minds, covering up women in a humiliating way and depriving them from education are all a dictatorship's way of controlling people. I really hope that the viewers of this movie can be mature enough to separate the actions and beliefs.  Religions shouldn't be blamed for the bad actions of people, only people should be blamed for their bad actions.5-Finally, two powerful scenes that I can't get out of my head: the scene of the sexually abused child on the stairs talking about his feelings about the abuse, and the scene were the orphanage director was describing how he would give one child to be abused in order to have other kids saved.Despite all my objections, I have to admit that this movie is very strong, powerful, and shocking. I'm still shocked and drained emotionally over the experience of watching ""The Kite Runner"", but such is life. If one can't handle the truth, they should go to the circus instead of watching such a movie.",5,""" I feel like a tourist in my homeland""-Khalid Abdalla(Amir)",1223942400,"10 14,

1132151,A3G6N66V3T62YA,B0011P4X8S,MQu,"[1, 2]","This is an excellent movie based on a fantastic debut novel by khaled hosseini and it really is a must see, but as always, must read FIRST.One of the reasons I thought Hosseini was such a talented writer is because he manages to use a relatively steady and benign plot but somehow grip the reader from beginning to end. It is not a book with a classic immense climax/anti-climax, but instead, more of an informative and enlightning read that is continuosly filled with emotion and lets the imagination run wild.For me, an insight into the history of Afghanistan was also very interesting since it is a country I knew very little about; one that has been crippled with fighting for as long as I remember, first the Russians and then the Taliban who in combination have ruined a city (Kabul) that may one day have been a thriving centre of civilisation as we know it today. It certainly appears to have been one well before many other cities in the region. All that appears to be left are fond memories with those who were lucky enough to have experienced it. In very talented form by Hosseini, this book allows the reader a magical glimpse into such memories. This is where the strength of Hosseini shines.As with all movies based on books, the book clearly wins. I say this because I thought the film plot moved too quickly for my liking compared with the book where I read slowly and was totally absorbed throughout.Despite this, I would highly recommend the movie and still rate it as excellent at 5/5, but again stress that reading the book is a must.A good friend said to me that once I read this book, all other books thereafter will just feel so bland and pointless.

Very troubling what we see for these kids under the taliban and shiria law.What was sad for me that, in the extras, where the production folks talk about the movie, the director and the writer speak to the work of NGO's in Afganistan and how they need support.  That's true.BUT no mention and no credit to the United States military who HAVE stepped in and courageously cared enough to die for these people.

Zwick,"[1, 1]","Based on the prize-winning novel by Khaled Hosseini, ""The Kite Runner,"" written by David Benioff and directed by Marc Forster, is a moving account of a young boy (Zekeria Ebrahimi) growing up in pre-war Afghanistan.  The movie begins in 1978 on the eve of the Soviet invasion of that country and ends in 2000 as Amir (Khalid Abdalla), now a young man, is making a new life for himself as a published author in the Bay Area.The centerpiece of the story is the boy's father (Homayoun Ershadi), an Atticus Finch-type figure who tries to impart the values of dealing fairly with all people and of standing up for what one believes in to his son, a sensitive boy who seems ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent forces in the world.  In fact, the courage of the father is placed in juxtaposition to the cowardice of the son, the latter of whom refuses to intervene when his best friend, Hassan, the son of the servant of the family and a member of the lower-caste Hazara tribe, is brutalized by a group of racist bullies from the neighborhood.  Amir is condemned to suffer the guilt of not having defended his buddy - and of later rejecting him because of that guilt - for the rest of his life.The story is divided into two basic time periods: the years living in Kabul before the war forces Amir and his father to flee the country, and the post-war years in America when the country they left behind is being ruled by the iron-fisted Taliban regime.And it is on a return trip to Afghanistan as an adult that Amir is finally able to achieve redemption for what he allowed to happen to Hassan by performing the ultimate act of courage to help a fellow human being in trouble.Fine performances and the view the movie provides into the tragic history of a struggling nation more than compensate for the occasional choppiness of the storytelling and the stray implausibility that creeps into the narrative towards the end.",4,Touching story of one man's redemption,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,1915,"['Based', 'prize-winning', 'novel', 'Khaled', 'Hosseini', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'written', 'David', 'Benioff', 'directed', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'moving', 'account', 'young', 'boy', 'Zekeria', 'Ebrahimi', 'growing', 'up', 'pre-war', 'Afghanistan', 'movie', '1978', 'eve', 'Soviet', 'invasion', 'country', '2000', 'Amir', 'Khalid', 'Abdalla', 'now', 'young', 'man', 'making', 'new', 'life', 'published', 'author', 'Bay', 'Area.The', 'centerpiece', 'story', 'boy', 'father', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'Atticus', 'Finch-type', 'figure', 'who', 'impart', 'values', 'dealing', 'fairly', 'people', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'one', 'son', 'sensitive', 'boy', 'who', 'ill-equipped', 'deal', 'malevolent', 'forces', 'world', 'fact', 'courage', 'father', 'placed', 'juxtaposition', 'cowardice', 'son', 'latter', 'whom', 'refuses', 'intervene', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'Hassan', 'son', 'servant', 'family', 'member', 'lower-caste', 'Hazara', 'tribe', 'brutalized', 'group', 'racist', 'bullies', 'neighborhood', 'Amir', 'condemned', 'suffer', 'guilt', 'not', 'having', 'defended', 'buddy', 'later', 'rejecting', 'guilt', 'rest', 'life.The', 'story', 'divided', 'two', 'basic', 'time', 'periods', 'years', 'living', 'Kabul', 'war', 'forces', 'Amir', 'father', 'flee', 'country', 'post-war', 'years', 'America', 'when', 'country', 'left', 'behind', 'being', 'ruled', 'iron-fisted', 'Taliban', 'regime.And', 'return', 'trip', 'Afghanistan', 'adult', 'Amir', 'finally', 'able', 'achieve', 'redemption', 'what', 'allowed', 'happen', 'Hassan', 'performing', 'ultimate', 'act', 'courage', 'help', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'trouble.Fine', 'performances', 'view', 'movie', 'tragic', 'history', 'struggling', 'nation', 'more', 'compensate', 'occasional', 'choppiness', 'storytelling', 'stray', 'implausibility', 'narrative', 'towards', 'end']",N/A

If those viewers had bothered to watch the trailer or read a review they would have had the good sense to watch something else and let other possible viewers enjoy it.- Yes, the movie is partially in subtitles. Generally speaking, if a movie is set in a foreign country where English is not predominantly spoken, there will be some dialogue in the native tongue. I thought that was a no brainer.- Yes, the book might be better (as they usually are) but the movie should be judged on its own merit, not solely as compared to the novel. I am the first one to say if you liked the movie version you will LOVE the novel; I don't have to put down the film version to do so.- Yes, the movie has a scene that is disturbing to some. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you know that there is some controversy about the book and whether or not it is appropriate classroom reading material for minors. And if you know there is controversy, you should find out what that controversy is before viewing the movie.- Yes, the scenery was dry, dusty and barren for the most part. Again, if you know the movie is set in another country you should be aware that it does not share the same lush greenery as your backyard.Now that I have vented, I can get to what I liked about the picture. (lol)The main characters are best friends and also master and servant. The feeling that Hassan (servant) has to Amir (rich son) is a rare and pure love that is beyond that of a servant to his master, the love of a brother, or even the love of a best friend. It is a truly unconditional love that withstands hurt, anger, betrayal... I guess you could say Hassan is in love with Amir in a platonic way, so much so that he put Amir's well being above his own. The two boys are best friends just as their fathers have been since boyhood. But Amir's insecurity, jealousy and shame destroy the relationships. Soon afterward the Russian Communists invade Afghanistan and Amir and his father flee to Pakistan and then on to America. As an adult, Amir must return to his homeland to face his past and right a wrong.

Even more than that, the film is about redemption, friendship, survival and loss.  Theatrical adaption of Khaled Hosseini's novel is true to its original form.If you have read ""The Kite Runner"" you need to understand that it is nearly impossible to transfer the strength of Hosseini's novel's emotions onto the big screen.  The superb cast of the film does an excellent job though, transporting the viewer to Afghanistan of the old - pre-Soviet, pre-Taliban, pre-Al Qaida, and guides us through the country's survival of all the invaders.The story of Amir and Hasan, two friends of different backgrounds, one Pashtun and one Hazara, master and servant, privileged and oppressed, is a story of friendship that endures all that is negative about human character.  Amir made mistakes, and, years later, he gets a chance to repay his debt to Hasan.  Do we follow the path of the least resistance or do we take action?  This question can be applied to all of us, no matter our cultural background or upbringing.Although the novel is much more emotional and gripping, ""Kite Runner"" the movie delivers with a punch, and delivers the message squarely to all of us - do we take the chance to rectify the ills we have caused, do we take the chance to be good again?

Some scenes in modern Afghanistan are quite upsetting and at other times I found myself getting choked up at the events and emotions being portrayed on screen.

1132185,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B0011P4X8S,S. Schell,"[2, 3]","I want to start this review off by saying that I loved the novel that this film was based on so going into it, I expected it to disappoint me in some areas, as books are usually better than their film counterparts.  What I didn't expect was for its pervasive drama and tension to be depreciated by an extremely compressed reworking of the story and lackluster performances from its actors, a result of faulty casting and poor direction on the part of Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace).  ""The Kite Runner"", adapted from author Khaled Hosseini's critically acclaimed novel, is a disservice to his powerful story in that it lacks the proper quantity of elements needed for a great drama.The film begins with the travails of two Afghan boys from opposite sides of the tracks, Amir Qadiri a well-to-do Pashtun and his best friend Hassan a Hazara that is a servant in his household.  Both boys are avid kite fighters, a revered sport in Afghanistan that bestows great honor upon the boy whose kite outlasts all the others.  Despite their closeness, Amir harbors a mysterious disdain for Hassan, simultaneously admiring and loathing his honesty and loyalty.  He also harbors a silent resentment for his father's close relationship with him, withered and bitter from criticism over his propensity for reading and writing over sport.When he is the victor of a kite fighting championship one fateful day, he allows that resentment to prevent him from intervening on an unspeakable assault on Hassan by Assef, the district's resident bully.  Thereafter unable to look him in the eye, Amir's cowardice allows him to accuse Hassan of a crime he did not commit in order to expel him from his home.  Though Amir's father forgives Hassan for his trespasses (despite lecturing Amir on what a despicable crime theft is), Ali (Hassan's father) elects to pack their bags and leave, knowing full well the truth of events.From there, Amir and his father are forced to evacuate from Afghanistan when the Soviets invade the country, father and son making their way to American soil for a new life.  Graduating from college and publishing his first novel, Amir (Abdalla) begins living the life he always dreamed of but his past still haunts him and one lone day a phone call from Ramir Khan (Toub) opens the door to redemption.Much is lost of Hosseini's masterful tale from the film's cut-and-dry editing, Forster's desperation to fit 400 pages of a novel into 127 minutes of film effectively killing some of the story's greater moments as well as its overall impact.  Certain characters are excluded and there is a definitive lack of character development, a fault of David Benioff's elegant screenplay (he pulled direct quotes from the book quite often).  These are likely the result of time constraints and abridgment of Hosseini's in-depth storyline, a flaw that ends up providing a conclusion that is slightly contrary to the book's ending (which was extremely bittersweet).Forster barely coaxed any noteworthy performances from his actors, resulting in some of the most rigid and forgettable acting I've ever seen.  As the film's lead, Khalid Abdalla is responsible for carrying much of the film; he seems to have gone to the Keanu Reeves school of acting, his utterly flat delivery annulling much of the story's passion and intensity.  The child actors are abysmal - most of them appear to be just reciting their lines without even thinking about what they mean.  Particularly disappointing is the boy who plays Assef, a character who was a much more frightening creature in the novel than portrayed onscreen, a textbook example of a sociopath.  This film barely fleshes out his potent antagonism and it's incredibly disappointing.  The only exception is Shaun Toub as Ramir Khan, a close friend of the family who seems to have a better understanding of Amir than anyone else.""The Kite Runner"" also contains unnecessary and excessive subtitling, half the film spoken in three different dialects (Urdu, Dari, Pashtu).  These scenes could easily have been done in English and lost none of their impact and better actors might've been recruited as a result.One thing that can be appreciated about this film is its exquisite cinematography, principal photographer Roberto Schaefer's sweeping vistas of Afghanistan made possible by the beauteous Pamir Mountains of China, as well as select Chinese cities (Tashgarkan, Beijing, Xinjiang).Bottom line: Anyone who says that this movie was a good adaptation hasn't really read Hosseini's novel.  Though it's been made obvious by this review, I would not recommend this film over the book, a film that falls far short of the rich experience of reading Hosseini's gripping narrative.",3,Deflated Adaptation,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,4703,"['want', 'start', 'review', 'off', 'saying', 'loved', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'so', 'going', 'expected', 'disappoint', 'areas', 'books', 'are', 'usually', 'better', 'film', 'counterparts', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'pervasive', 'drama', 'tension', 'be', 'depreciated', 'extremely', 'compressed', 'reworking', 'story', 'lackluster', 'performances', 'actors', 'result', 'faulty', 'casting', 'poor', 'direction', 'part', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'adapted', 'author', 'Khaled', 'Hosseini', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'novel', 'disservice', 'powerful', 'story', 'proper', 'quantity', 'elements', 'needed', 'great', 'drama.The', 'film', 'travails', 'two', 'Afghan', 'boys', 'opposite', 'sides', 'tracks', 'Amir', 'Qadiri', 'well-to-do', 'Pashtun', 'best', 'friend', 'Hassan', 'Hazara', 'servant', 'household', 'boys', 'are', 'avid', 'kite', 'fighters', 'revered', 'sport', 'Afghanistan', 'great', 'honor', 'boy', 'kite', 'others', 'closeness', 'Amir', 'mysterious', 'disdain', 'Hassan', 'simultaneously', 'admiring', 'loathing', 'honesty', 'loyalty', 'also', 'silent', 'resentment', 'father', 'close', 'relationship', 'withered', 'bitter', 'criticism', 'propensity', 'reading', 'writing', 'sport.When', 'victor', 'kite', 'fighting', 'championship', 'one', 'fateful', 'day', 'resentment', 'prevent', 'intervening', 'unspeakable', 'assault', 'Hassan', 'Assef', 'district', 'resident', 'bully', 'Thereafter', 'unable', 'look', 'eye', 'Amir', 'cowardice', 'accuse', 'Hassan', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'order', 'expel', 'home', 'Amir', 'father', 'Hassan', 'trespasses', 'lecturing', 'Amir', 'what', 'despicable', 'crime', 'theft', 'Ali', 'Hassan', 'father', 'pack', 'bags', 'leave', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'truth', 'events.From', 'there', 'Amir', 'father', 'are', 'forced', 'evacuate', 'Afghanistan', 'when', 'Soviets', 'invade', 'country', 'father', 'son', 'making', 'way', 'American', 'soil', 'new', 'life', 'Graduating', 'college', 'publishing', 'first', 'novel', 'Amir', 'Abdalla', 'living', 'life', 'always', 'dreamed', 'past', 'still', 'one', 'lone', 'day', 'phone', 'call', 'Ramir', 'Khan', 'Toub', 'door', 'redemption.Much', 'lost', 'Hosseini', 'masterful', 'tale', 'film', 'cut-and-dry', 'editing', 'Forster', 'desperation', 'fit', '400', 'pages', 'novel', '127', 'minutes', 'film', 'effectively', 'killing', 'story', 'greater', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'overall', 'impact', 'Certain', 'characters', 'are', 'excluded', 'definitive', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'fault', 'David', 'Benioff', 'elegant', 'screenplay', 'pulled', 'direct', 'quotes', 'book', 'quite', 'often', 'are', 'likely', 'result', 'time', 'constraints', 'abridgment', 'Hosseini', 'in-depth', 'storyline', 'flaw', 'up', 'providing', 'conclusion', 'slightly', 'contrary', 'book', 'ending', 'was', 'extremely', 'bittersweet', '.Forster', 'barely', 'coaxed', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'actors', 'resulting', 'most', 'rigid', 'forgettable', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'lead', 'Khalid', 'Abdalla', 'responsible', 'carrying', 'much', 'film', 'have', 'gone', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'school', 'acting', 'utterly', 'flat', 'delivery', 'annulling', 'much', 'story', 'passion', 'intensity', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'abysmal', 'most', 'appear', 'be', 'just', 'reciting', 'lines', 'even', 'thinking', 'what', 'mean', 'Particularly', 'disappointing', 'boy', 'who', 'Assef', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'creature', 'novel', 'portrayed', 'onscreen', 'textbook', 'example', 'sociopath', 'film', 'barely', 'out', 'potent', 'antagonism', 'incredibly', 'disappointing', 'only', 'exception', 'Shaun', 'Toub', 'Ramir', 'Khan', 'close', 'friend', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'Amir', 'anyone', 'else', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'also', 'unnecessary', 'excessive', 'subtitling', 'film', 'spoken', 'three', 'different', 'dialects', 'Urdu', 'Dari', 'Pashtu', 'scenes', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'English', 'lost', 'none', 'impact', 'better', 'actors', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been', 'recruited', 'result.One', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'film', 'exquisite', 'cinematography', 'principal', 'photographer', 'Roberto', 'Schaefer', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'Afghanistan', 'made', 'possible', 'beauteous', 'Pamir', 'Mountains', 'China', 'as', 'well', 'select', 'Chinese', 'cities', 'Tashgarkan', 'Beijing', 'Xinjiang', '.Bottom', 'line', 'Anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'really', 'read', 'Hosseini', 'novel', 'been', 'made', 'obvious', 'review', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'book', 'film', 'far', 'short', 'rich', 'experience', 'reading', 'Hosseini', 'gripping', 'narrative']",N/A

The story takes place in Afghanistan and it does an excellent job of making you feel like you are really viewing a foreign country. I don't know how historically accurate it all may be, but it fooled me and that's good enough for me. There really aren't any ""action"" scenes. This movie is all about characters and story.As I said in the title, I'm viewing this movie having read the book a month or two ago. Overall, I think they did a good job of capturing all of the major plots from the book but there was quite a bit of material missing that helped you connect with each character. I watched the film with my girlfriend and at certain points I wondered if she really understood what the characters were feeling and I paused the movie to tell her about certain points that were made in the book to help her appreciate more what each character was thinking.Personally, I feel its unfair to compare a movie based on a book to the actual book because the book is almost guaranteed to be better and I don't believe that a story that works as a book will necessarily work as a movie. A movie also has to condense a lot of story into a very short time span that can be seen in one sitting, so thats a big disadvantage.Having said all of that, my girlfriend cried so the movie did touch her. It's difficult to assess how good the movie stands on its own because I knew the characters so well having read the book, so if you've read the book and want to re-live this story in a much shorter span than it would take to read the book over, then I think you'll love it.I'm giving it five stars, but I'm not looking at it as a stand-alone story or as an alternative to the book, but more as a partner to the book.",5,A Review Through the Eyes of Someone Who Read the Book First - A No Spoiler Review,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,1844,"['First', ""'ll"", 'promise', 'will', 'be', 'spoilers', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'general', 'review.The', 'Story', 'story', 'redemption', 'story', 'place', 'Afghanistan', 'excellent', 'job', 'making', 'feel', 'are', 'really', 'viewing', 'foreign', 'country', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'historically', 'accurate', 'may', 'be', 'fooled', 'good', 'enough', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'action', 'scenes', 'movie', 'characters', 'story.As', 'said', 'title', ""'m"", 'viewing', 'movie', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'month', 'two', 'ago', 'Overall', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'major', 'plots', 'book', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'material', 'missing', 'helped', 'connect', 'character', 'watched', 'film', 'girlfriend', 'certain', 'points', 'wondered', 'really', 'understood', 'what', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling', 'paused', 'movie', 'tell', 'certain', 'points', 'were', 'made', 'book', 'help', 'appreciate', 'more', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'thinking.Personally', 'feel', 'unfair', 'compare', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'actual', 'book', 'book', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'be', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'story', 'book', 'will', 'necessarily', 'work', 'movie', 'movie', 'also', 'condense', 'lot', 'story', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'one', 'sitting', 'so', 'big', 'disadvantage.Having', 'said', 'girlfriend', 'cried', 'so', 'movie', 'did', 'touch', 'difficult', 'assess', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'knew', 'characters', 'so', 'well', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'so', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'want', 're-live', 'story', 'much', 'shorter', 'span', 'would', 'take', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars', ""'m"", 'not', 'looking', 'stand-alone', 'story', 'alternative', 'book', 'more', 'partner', 'book']",N/A

1132189,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0011P4X8S,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","""The Kite Runner"" is epic in scope, telling the story of the Afghani Amir against political upheavals in his native country, his growing up, and eventual immigration to the United States.  The film is bookended by the present-day Amir (Khalid Abdalla), a successful writer, and is told as an extended flashback to Afghanistan before and during the Russian invasion.Young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi) grows up with his best friend, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada), who has been taken in by his wealthy father, Baba (Homayoun Ershadi).  Hassan is from a provincial tribe apart from the mainstream Muslim practitioners who would eventually become the ruling Taliban.  Though he is constantly bullied, Hassan is always ready to defend his timid friend Amir.After a brutal assault on Hassan, which Amir witnesses but is too frightened to come to Hassan's aid, the relationship between the two friends changes.  The country is shortly thereafter invaded by the Russians, and Amir and his family begin a frightening attempt to elude the invaders and get out of Afghanistan.Based on the novel by Khalid Hosseini, ""The Kite Runner"" is a captivating story about friendship, family, how war creates personal turmoil, and how events experienced at a young age follow one and mold him into the adult he becomes.  Director Marc Forster (""Monster's Ball,"" ""Finding Neverland"") structures his film like a three-act play.  The first third is the richest as he shows us the wonderful relationship of the two young friends, who become the reigning neighborhood kite-flying team.  Amir controls the kite, attempting to cut the string of other boys' kites.  When he succeeds, Hassan -- the kite runner -- darts through narrow streets to retrieve the stringless kite as a trophy.  The scenes of kite flying, enhanced by a bit of computer magic, metaphorically underscore the innocence and freedom of childhood.  This is the boys' life and joy.  The concerns of adulthood ae not theirs and some dark secrets are still well hidden.When the Russians invade Afghanistan, the film shifts into its second act and follows Amir and his father's escape from Afghanistan to Pakistan, their subsequent immigration to America, and Amir's coming of age.The final act brings Amir back to Taliban-run Afghanistan on a quest he must not avoid.  In this part of the film, there are several significant revelations made, both to Amir and the audience.The two young actors who dominate the early part of the film are extraordinary, and turn in extremely affecting performances.  Much of the success of the film is owed to them, since they beautifully connect with the viewer, elicit empathy, and involve us.  Rarely, from children this young, do we see such high-level, competent acting.  We never for a moment see the performances as anything but real.Ershadi, as Baba, is also exceptional.  Whether he is criticizing religious fanatics, cursing communism, watching his son compete successfully in kite flying, or imperiling his own life by standing up for the honor of a stranger, he conveys dignity, courage, and arrogance, as required, making his Baba a well developed, if flawed, character.Because the adult Amir is a low-key and laid back, Adballa succeeeds in the tough task of making us care about him.  His journey -- both emotional and physical -- changes him and is as enlightening for him as it is dangerous.  This Amir is not a hero in the usual Hollywood sense, but a man who comes to terms with demons of the past, attempts to exorcise them, and develops inner courage in the process.Rated PG-13 for strong thematic material, violence, and strong language, ""The Kite Runner"" is a gripping film that you won't easily forget.  Its subject matter is substantial and its background of war-torn 1970's Afghanistan and its unfolding story over many years give it a sweeping, epic feel.  It is impeccably directed, and its cast completely effective in portraying complex, multifaceted characters.",5,A Tale of Friendship and Political Upheaval,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,3957,"['Kite', 'Runner', 'epic', 'scope', 'telling', 'story', 'Afghani', 'Amir', 'political', 'upheavals', 'native', 'country', 'growing', 'up', 'eventual', 'immigration', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'bookended', 'present-day', 'Amir', 'Khalid', 'Abdalla', 'successful', 'writer', 'told', 'extended', 'flashback', 'Afghanistan', 'Russian', 'invasion.Young', 'Amir', 'Zekeria', 'Ebrahimi', 'up', 'best', 'friend', 'Hassan', 'Ahmad', 'Khan', 'Mahmidzada', 'who', 'been', 'taken', 'wealthy', 'father', 'Baba', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'Hassan', 'provincial', 'tribe', 'apart', 'mainstream', 'Muslim', 'practitioners', 'who', 'would', 'eventually', 'become', 'ruling', 'Taliban', 'constantly', 'bullied', 'Hassan', 'always', 'ready', 'defend', 'timid', 'friend', 'Amir.After', 'brutal', 'assault', 'Hassan', 'Amir', 'witnesses', 'too', 'frightened', 'come', 'Hassan', 'aid', 'relationship', 'two', 'friends', 'changes', 'country', 'shortly', 'thereafter', 'invaded', 'Russians', 'Amir', 'family', 'begin', 'frightening', 'attempt', 'elude', 'invaders', 'get', 'Afghanistan.Based', 'novel', 'Khalid', 'Hosseini', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'captivating', 'story', 'friendship', 'family', 'how', 'war', 'personal', 'turmoil', 'how', 'events', 'experienced', 'young', 'age', 'follow', 'one', 'mold', 'adult', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'film', 'three-act', 'play', 'first', 'third', 'richest', 'wonderful', 'relationship', 'two', 'young', 'friends', 'who', 'become', 'reigning', 'neighborhood', 'kite-flying', 'team', 'Amir', 'kite', 'attempting', 'cut', 'string', 'other', 'boys', 'kites', 'When', 'Hassan', 'kite', 'runner', 'darts', 'narrow', 'streets', 'retrieve', 'stringless', 'kite', 'trophy', 'scenes', 'kite', 'flying', 'enhanced', 'bit', 'computer', 'magic', 'metaphorically', 'innocence', 'freedom', 'childhood', 'boys', 'life', 'joy', 'concerns', 'adulthood', 'ae', 'not', 'theirs', 'dark', 'secrets', 'are', 'still', 'well', 'hidden.When', 'Russians', 'invade', 'Afghanistan', 'film', 'shifts', 'second', 'act', 'Amir', 'father', 'escape', 'Afghanistan', 'Pakistan', 'subsequent', 'immigration', 'America', 'Amir', 'coming', 'age.The', 'final', 'act', 'Amir', 'back', 'Taliban-run', 'Afghanistan', 'quest', 'must', 'not', 'avoid', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'significant', 'revelations', 'made', 'Amir', 'audience.The', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'dominate', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'turn', 'extremely', 'affecting', 'performances', 'Much', 'success', 'film', 'owed', 'beautifully', 'connect', 'viewer', 'elicit', 'empathy', 'involve', 'Rarely', 'children', 'young', 'do', 'see', 'such', 'high-level', 'competent', 'acting', 'never', 'moment', 'see', 'performances', 'anything', 'real.Ershadi', 'Baba', 'also', 'exceptional', 'criticizing', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'cursing', 'communism', 'watching', 'son', 'compete', 'successfully', 'kite', 'flying', 'imperiling', 'own', 'life', 'standing', 'up', 'honor', 'stranger', 'dignity', 'courage', 'arrogance', 'required', 'making', 'Baba', 'well', 'developed', 'flawed', 'character.Because', 'adult', 'Amir', 'low-key', 'laid', 'back', 'Adballa', 'tough', 'task', 'making', 'care', 'journey', 'emotional', 'physical', 'changes', 'enlightening', 'dangerous', 'Amir', 'not', 'hero', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'sense', 'man', 'who', 'terms', 'demons', 'past', 'attempts', 'exorcise', 'inner', 'courage', 'process.Rated', 'PG-13', 'strong', 'thematic', 'material', 'violence', 'strong', 'language', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'gripping', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'easily', 'forget', 'subject', 'matter', 'substantial', 'background', 'war-torn', '1970', 'Afghanistan', 'unfolding', 'story', 'many', 'years', 'give', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'feel', 'impeccably', 'directed', 'cast', 'completely', 'effective', 'portraying', 'complex', 'multifaceted', 'characters']",N/A
1132190,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B0011P4X8S,Timothy Kearney,"[1, 2]","Since THE KITE RUNNER has had a solid home on many bestseller lists for five years now, I'm not alone in saying that I loved Khaled Hosseini's gripping and engrossing novel. While it's almost clich&eacute; to say a book is better than a novel, in the case of THE KITE RUNNER, readers seemed to have personal experiences with the book and as so many book club members can attest, no one who reads the book has the same interpretation of it, or at least it seems that way. Like many people, I wondered if a movie version would do justice to this novel. Since the book is etched indelibly in my mind, I figured that while I'd enjoy the movie, I also assumed I'd be at least mildly disappointed with the movie version of the book. Much to my surprise, I found the film version moving, stayed close to the book's basic plot, and told a powerful story.The story begins in Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion. We meet two young children, Amir, a child born to privilege, and Hassan, the son of the family's servant. While Amir is loved by his father, he cannot help but notice that his father has an obvious affection for Hassan which causes resentment. Hassan is dutifully loyal to Amir, and remains so as long as the two live under the same roof, but events happen between the two that change things forever. The two are separated when Hassan and his father leave the household and the separation becomes permanent when Amir and his father flee Afghanistan. After living in the United States for twenty years and knowing the torment the people of Afghanistan have lived under for so long, Amir begins a journey to try as best he can to make amends for his childish, but cruel actions toward Hassan.Without a doubt the young the movie's greatest asset has to be the two endearing Afghani actors Zekeria Ebrahimi as the young Amir and Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada as the young Hassan. We see the genuine friendship that develops between the two as well as the rivalry, at least Amir's perception of Hassan as a rival that is pivotal to the story. The film does a good job at showing how two children raised in the same household can also be from two vastly different worlds. The film also does a wonderful job at portraying the Afghan custom of kite running and we feel the joy and exhilaration of this fierce competition. Some of the characters are somewhat one dimensional, most notably the character of Assef who is evil as a child and even more evil as an adult, but this is true to the book. Hosseni seems to have a number of one dimensional characters which keeps readers from being too distracted with the book's unfamiliar setting which allows readers to better appreciate the inner struggles of Amir. This does not work as well in the film version.

It is also about the tragedy that is Afghanistan and the plight of its people. For those who have yet to experience first hand the squalor and stench of a third world country, it is hard to imagine what it takes to survive, let alone face the day-to-day indignities of having to ask somebody for food, money, hope. Adding to the misery are the cruel, inhuman ways of the Taliban as they roam the streets of Kabul murdering anyone who catches their fancy.Against this backdrop, director Marc Forster weaves the story of Amir (Khalid Abdallah), an Afghan immigrant and his struggle to discover himself and atone for an act of cowardice that altered the lives of the people he cares for and loves.The movie opens in modern-day San Francisco. Amir's dream of becoming a famous writer becomes a reality as he celebrates the publication of his first novel. Even though he has achieved the American dream, there remains an emptiness in him. His father, a once powerful and influential figure in Afghanistan, is no more. There is only his wife, the beautiful Soraya (Atossa Leoni) and her parents. In flashbacks, he recalls the happy days of childhood he had in Afghanistan and how he spent these wonderful moments with his best friend, Hassan, the son of his father's oldest friend and live-in servant, Ali. He also recalls the Russian invasion and the coming of the Taliban and how they fled to Pakistan in order to get to America.When he receives the news that his father's oldest friend and confidant wants to see him, he travels to Pakistan. What he discovers there will rock the very core of his existence. But it is what he decides to do after that that will help him re-discover himself and finally find the peace of mind that has always eluded him.Based on the novel by Khaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner is a film that lets your heart soar and reminds you that there is still goodness in humanity, and that hope and redemption are available to those who are willing to make sacrifices.It is beautifully filmed, with a haunting musical score from the talented Alberto Iglesias and a stellar performance from the cast. The young boys, Amir and Hassan,  played by Zekeria Ebrahimi and Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada, are a revelation. They are simply perfect for their roles. Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Amir's father, Baba, gives an understated yet effective supporting performance. Also noteworthy are the songs of British singer, Sami Yusuf, which add to the authenticity and regional flavour of the film.It is not by all means a perfect movie. There are some moments when it seems unbelievable, and there is a deliberate intention to tug all the emotional strings.This year, there are a number of outstanding book-to-film adaptations, and while Atonement and There Will be Blood top the list, The Kite Runner is not far behind.",5,"Magnificent movie about friendship, betrayal and finding oneself",1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,2898,"['Kite', 'Runner', 'story', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'betrayal', 'redemption', 'also', 'tragedy', 'Afghanistan', 'plight', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'experience', 'first', 'hand', 'squalor', 'stench', 'third', 'world', 'country', 'hard', 'imagine', 'what', 'survive', 'let', 'alone', 'face', 'day-to-day', 'indignities', 'having', 'ask', 'somebody', 'food', 'money', 'hope', 'Adding', 'misery', 'are', 'cruel', 'inhuman', 'ways', 'Taliban', 'roam', 'streets', 'Kabul', 'murdering', 'anyone', 'who', 'fancy.Against', 'backdrop', 'director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'story', 'Amir', 'Khalid', 'Abdallah', 'Afghan', 'immigrant', 'struggle', 'discover', 'atone', 'act', 'cowardice', 'altered', 'lives', 'people', 'loves.The', 'movie', 'modern-day', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Amir', 'dream', 'becoming', 'famous', 'writer', 'reality', 'publication', 'first', 'novel', 'Even', 'achieved', 'American', 'dream', 'emptiness', 'father', 'once', 'powerful', 'influential', 'figure', 'Afghanistan', 'more', 'only', 'wife', 'beautiful', 'Soraya', 'Atossa', 'Leoni', 'parents', 'flashbacks', 'happy', 'days', 'childhood', 'had', 'Afghanistan', 'how', 'spent', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'best', 'friend', 'Hassan', 'son', 'father', 'oldest', 'friend', 'live-in', 'servant', 'Ali', 'also', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'coming', 'Taliban', 'how', 'fled', 'Pakistan', 'order', 'get', 'America.When', 'news', 'father', 'oldest', 'friend', 'confidant', 'see', 'Pakistan', 'What', 'there', 'will', 'rock', 'very', 'core', 'existence', 'what', 'do', 'will', 'help', 're-discover', 'finally', 'find', 'peace', 'mind', 'always', 'eluded', 'him.Based', 'novel', 'Khaled', 'Hosseini', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'film', 'heart', 'soar', 'reminds', 'still', 'goodness', 'humanity', 'hope', 'redemption', 'are', 'available', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'make', 'sacrifices.It', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'talented', 'Alberto', 'Iglesias', 'stellar', 'performance', 'cast', 'young', 'boys', 'Amir', 'Hassan', 'played', 'Zekeria', 'Ebrahimi', 'Ahmad', 'Khan', 'Mahmidzada', 'are', 'revelation', 'are', 'simply', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Homayoun', 'Ershadi', 'who', 'Amir', 'father', 'Baba', 'understated', 'yet', 'effective', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'songs', 'British', 'singer', 'Sami', 'Yusuf', 'add', 'authenticity', 'regional', 'flavour', 'film.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'unbelievable', 'deliberate', 'intention', 'tug', 'emotional', 'strings.This', 'year', 'are', 'number', 'outstanding', 'book-to-film', 'adaptations', 'Atonement', 'Will', 'be', 'Blood', 'top', 'list', 'Kite', 'Runner', 'not', 'far']",N/A

Spanning several decades of turbulent history, the movie paints a humanizing portrait of Afghanistan and its people rarely glimpsed in the U.S. Although neither had prior acting experience, its child actors Zekeria Ebrahimi and Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada play their roles as Amir and Hassan with touching conviction.Amir, a child of Afghanistan's privileged sector, betrays Hassan, his best friend and the son of the family servant, failing to return Hassan's unwavering loyalty. Years later, after Amir has left his homeland for the United States, he receives a phone call from an old friend, prompting him to embark on a painful journey back to a very different Afghanistan in search of redemption.Though the novel contains a far richer experience, including one particularly crucial scene that does not appear in the movie, the movie has its own advantages.
