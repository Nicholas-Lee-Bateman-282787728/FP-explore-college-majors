1102146,A2XA8FC1WH2QEZ,B000VKJ6UE,A. Batie,"[2, 4]","This is a good movie for the conservative religious to see, in hopes that it might show them the harm their narrow-minded views have, and how unchristian they are, but it's only mediocre at that.The best part of it is that you really feel the love Clifford feels for Brady, and you really do see how conflicted Brady is over his feelings.  Having grown up in rural america, though fortunately not in such a strongly religious household, the fear and denial are *very* real, and the two actors did a good job in their roles.I also commend the movie for not artificially contriving to hide body parts.  When the clothes come off, they come off just like they would for real, so what if you can see what you know is there?Lastly, though like all the messages this was relatively understated, they did hint at the fact that Brady was basically going through ""coming out"" as religious, though it would have been pretty obvious.  Denial goes both ways, and it's a good thing for those of us non-religious sorts to be reminded to treat those we disagree with with the same respect we expect and deserve.The main problems with the movie are:1.  It's too painful to watch the train wreck for someone who cares about the couple, and I don't think the message is strong enough to hit home the people who need it.2.  The long drawn out ""time passing"" scenes feel like they're there to make the movie full length without having to write real dialogue.  The short snippets that comprise scenes are marginal enough that this is probably a good thing.It wants to be ""Latter Days"" for mainstream Christians, but falls fairly short, unfortunately.",3,"""Latter Days"" for mainstream Christians...almost",1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,1629,"['good', 'movie', 'conservative', 'religious', 'see', 'hopes', 'might', 'show', 'harm', 'narrow-minded', 'views', 'have', 'how', 'unchristian', 'are', 'only', 'mediocre', 'that.The', 'best', 'part', 'really', 'feel', 'love', 'Clifford', 'Brady', 'really', 'do', 'see', 'how', 'conflicted', 'Brady', 'feelings', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'rural', 'america', 'though', 'fortunately', 'not', 'such', 'strongly', 'religious', 'household', 'fear', 'denial', 'are', '*very*', 'real', 'two', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'roles.I', 'also', 'commend', 'movie', 'not', 'artificially', 'contriving', 'hide', 'body', 'parts', 'When', 'clothes', 'come', 'off', 'come', 'off', 'just', 'would', 'real', 'so', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'know', 'there', 'Lastly', 'messages', 'was', 'relatively', 'understated', 'did', 'hint', 'fact', 'Brady', 'was', 'basically', 'going', 'coming', 'out', 'religious', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Denial', 'ways', 'good', 'thing', 'non-religious', 'sorts', 'be', 'reminded', 'treat', 'disagree', 'same', 'respect', 'expect', 'deserve.The', 'main', 'problems', 'movie', 'are:1', 'too', 'painful', 'watch', 'train', 'wreck', 'someone', 'who', 'couple', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'message', 'strong', 'enough', 'hit', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'it.2', 'long', 'drawn', 'time', 'passing', 'scenes', 'feel', ""'re"", 'make', 'movie', 'full', 'length', 'having', 'write', 'real', 'dialogue', 'short', 'snippets', 'comprise', 'scenes', 'are', 'marginal', 'enough', 'probably', 'good', 'thing.It', 'be', 'Latter', 'Days', 'mainstream', 'Christians', 'fairly', 'short', 'unfortunately']",Rock Haven

This is familiar territory to many, and Rock Haven is disturbingly accurate in its depiction of the conflict of faith vs. one's orientation.  There are many, many evangelical gay Christians out there who both love the Lord and fear that there is no way to reconcile sexuality with faith, living lives of inner conflict, shame, and repression.  This simple movie acknowledges their story, and yields not only relief that others are truly experiencing this conflict, but even gives some hope that God still cares.The movie is quite short on dialogue, and far too long on music. Many shots of beautiful coastal scenery create a pleasant texture to this film, but there still lacks a depth to the drama of this story that needs to be told and could have been told better.

The subject has not been tackled much in a movie yet (except for Latter Days and that was Mormon, not mainstream fundamentalist Christianity).The film has good intentions and for the most part is pretty good.  Sean Hoagland as Brady, the innocent, conflicted, Christian young man does well by his role and proves to be a very, very capable actor.  I was favorably impressed.  Much less though was the casting of Owen Alabado as Clifford, the ""much more experienced"" neighbor who Brady happens to fall for.  To me, these two have very little to no chemistry whatsoever, due to Alabado's pedestrian acting.  This may not be hhis fault entirely, however.  The direction is pedestrian and plodding.The actress who plays Brady's mother is stiff as well (again, probably due to the poor direction).  However, Kathryn Hecht as Clifford's mother nails her role as a ""New Agey Liberal"" mother.  She's quite good.The director himself cast himself as the pastor in this film but his acting is even worse than his directing.  It is downright horrible.  David Lewis has made a film to ponder about...being Christian and homosexual is a big issue and there were so many more avenues to be explored.  The thing that keeps the film going is Hoagland who rises above the script and directing deficiencies.There is a message to be gained by this type of plot but sadly, this film did not succeed in making it.

1102152,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000VKJ6UE,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[63, 69]","The plot of ""Rock Haven"" (2007) is simple and realistic, though far from original: is being gay an impossibility if you consider yourself a Christian as well?Brady is a shy, introspective 18 year old spending the summer before going away to college in a small coast town in Northern California.  He is there with his widowed mother, who is a devout Christian in the process of establishing a religious school for the local pastor.  Brady spends most of his time either reading the bible or staring off at the waves crashing on shore, until he meets a neighbor's free-spirited visiting son, 19 year old Clifford.  While we later find out that Brady had some early inklings that he was somewhat attracted to other boys, he never before felt drawn to anyone as he feels to Clifford, and the other boy makes it clear that the feeling is mutual.  Sensing his apprehensions and inexperience, Clifford lets their relationship develop slowly over the course of the summer, and, although he kids Brady about being a ""nerd"" in many of his interests, is careful not to express a conflict with his religious upbringing and convictions.A beautifully written story by director/writer David Lewis (""Under One Roof""), capably acted by a talented Bay Area cast.  While the basic plot is not original, and the story development somewhat predictable, it is told in a well-paced, sweet and romantic manner that lets the viewer feel the emotions experienced by the characters.  The one negative I must point out is Lewis' seeming obsession with numerous extended scenes of waves crashing on the beach (Waves wash out like past experiences, wash back to erase what was on the sand before, metaphor for life going on, new beginnings, yadda yadda yadda ... WE GET IT!  The ocean should not have more screen time than the actors!)  Other than that, the film is highly recommended at four stars out of five.DVD has deleted scenes, production stills and trailer.

The scenery is breath taking and makes a terrific backdrop for the scope of what the viewer is expecting to see. The acting is good, as is the casting. I expected a story about one young man's conflicting beliefs and desires and how he finds love in the maze of confusion and personal struggle. I wanted to see raw emotion, a love story, two young men finding happiness with each other in spite of their personal differences and backgrounds. But it was not to be in this film. The story ends in the most disappointing way I could have imagined. This is not a ""feel good"" movie, and there is little entertainment for the viewer. Not at all the review I had hoped of being able to leave for this one. TLA screwed up big time here.

Into this rather rigid atmosphere steps Clifford (Owen Alabado) and there is an immediate chemistry between the two young lads - Clifford being openly gay while Brady is so far back in the dark closet that Clifford's mere presence terrifies him. Clifford's mother (Katheryn Hecht) is a free spirit who deals comfortably with her son's feelings and tries to support Brady in his fear of sinning.  Brady's mother 'can't change the way she believes' (gay relationships are sinful) and tries to 'change' Brady by encouraging his attraction to a sweet well-meaning girl (Erin Daly) who just happens to understand Brady's needs more than he does!  The manner in which this conflict is approached and quasi-resolved is weak as written and directedby David Lewis (who also plays the role of the minister...), and the ending is unsatisfactory at best.The quality of acting is low on the scale but the sincerity is palpable.

1102161,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000VKJ6UE,J. Martin,"[5, 7]","I think Rock Haven is the best religion-vs-homosexuality movie so far, much better than the much more popular Latter Days. Rock Haven doesn't demonize the Christian parent or Christianity itself, as Latter Days does its Mormons, so anyone who prefers that kind of simplistic polarization would prefer Latter Days.I prefer the seemingly more complex world of Rock Haven, in which everybody is struggling and nobody has it easy, and in the end everybody changes for the better. I can't say it's any more realistic than Latter Days is, because they're both movies, but it certainly seems a lot more balanced.Not being a Mormon I can't say for sure, but maybe Mormonism really is that much more rigid than regular Christianity, and maybe the plight of gays within Mormonism is that much worse than it is for gay Christians. Maybe it actually is impossible to be both fully Mormon and fully gay, so that the hero of Latter Days HAS to escape his religion entirely to survive. But I know it's possible to be both fully and freely gay AND a committed, Bible-believing, born-again Christian--as Brady is in Rock Haven--because I'm doing that myself. Many Christian leaders want us to believe otherwise, but they're wrong.Rock Haven has some weak acting in secondary roles, but the three leads--Brady, Clifford, and Brady's mother--are very good. The screenplay is very good too, simple but intelligent, without any caricature or hysteria. And the movie is well put together for a director's first feature (I LIKE the shots of the ocean. It's beautiful). Even sex is handled better in Rock Haven than in Latter Days. There's a lot more nudity in Latter Days, but it's a strangely castrated nudity, showing a lot of everything except genitals, and that ends up feeling shameful.I recommend watching the deleted scenes on the Rock Haven DVD. The last one, called ""The Hardest Scene for the Director to Part With,"" is especially good.

And there begins that eternal tug of war between the enraptured heart and the ""rational"" mind -- a war of values.Brady's Catholic upbringing, foisted on him by his guilt-instilling mother, demands he renounce his natural yearnings and follow God's ""predestined"" path for ultimate salvation. At the end, despite the genuine sense of joy Brady feels in the arms of his reciprocating male lover, some misguided scriptwriter/director/producer decided -- much to the film's detriment -- that Brady abnegate his natural, sexual tendencies and look toward the Lord for some unspecified sense of deliverance...at which point ROCK HAVEN comes to a crashing, dead -- thoroughly unsatisfying! -- halt.At which point you might find yourself asking: Isn't it just a bit preposterous that a God of such incomparable majesty and intelligence would give a rat's ass as to whether one of His creations were sleeping, and experiencing intimacy, with what Catholic orthodoxy regards as an inappropriate (sinful!) choice?  Can anyone truly believe that such a Creator sits upon His golden throne in Heaven, hones in on this tiny dust speck of a planet called Earth and purrs with delighted contentment each and every time some guilt-ridden gay man (or woman) vainly attempts to renounce his or her natural -- *God-given!* -- tendency to fall in love with a member of the same sex?  Would a truly beneficent God condemn a man to eternal Hell (a concept, by the way, which I find monstrously absurd!) simply because his eyes discovered, and his body yielded to, the beauty he perceived in his own sex?  I find it inconceivable that an allegedly compassionate Jesus Christ could possibly harbor such hateful notions -- all ""evidence"" to the contrary notwithstanding.Forgive my unpardonable, overzealous outrage!

1102163,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B000VKJ6UE,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[3, 4]","......""Finding The One Who Helps You Find Yourself.""((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form. Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again). Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and your comments/reviews at various on-line sites. Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em). Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some of the ""near-Addictive"" as well). For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows below. Thanks for sticking with me so far.))So, Folks......first off, shall we play a little game of ""second-guess the Director?""  Uh.....no, no.....wait---just kidding.  After all, doin' the ""Monday morning Quarterbacxxxx, I mean, Director-ing"" thing would be taking too easy a way out.......especially if we're honest and admit that David Lewis did do right the biggest, most ""important-est"" thing.  What is that, you may ask?  Well, in the case of a gay romance, be it a comedy or otherwise, doing the right thing is finding and bringing together two male leads who've got ""C-H-E-M-I-S-T-R-Y"" with one another.  And in the case of Sean Hoagland and Owen Alabado, it's undeniably there---it's ""cutely"" there, I might add (a term which fittingly describes them and what we increasingly see them come across as).  While some leads grab you from the very beginning.......others grow on you.  These two are of the latter persuasion, but along the way they do hook you nevertheless.  Honestly, in the initial scenes I was thinking:  these two guys can't act, (particularly Sean's way of expressing himself---it grows on you), but before long they were reeling me in.  So, maybe this pair didn't have the acting ""chops"" to give us what a Cyrille Thouvenin and Stephan Guerin-Tillie gave us in ""Just a Question of Love,"" or even what a Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe happily bestowed upon us in ""Shelter,"" but what they have given us was real enough.  Thanks, Boys.Not to let Director Lewis off the hook completely, while others have already complained of over-numerous surfside and coastline ""nature"" scenes, as well as the big misstep of thinking he could effectively/believably play the minister role, I won't have to echo those thoughts.  BUT.......I do feel I have to add this:  in a religious community in which someone like ""Brady's mother"" would find herself comfortably at home, no way would I expect to find such a gay-understanding ""servant of the lord"" as Reverend Brown.  On the other hand, I also wouldn't expect to find in that ""little white-steepled church"" community a character such as Katheryn Hecht's ""out-there mother"" (Angie) either.  If any of you reading this think I'm wrong in my view of the ""unusual"" manner of the Reverend's coming across, please do make a Comment in that section, below.To me, much of this film pits religious indoctrination (read:  interpretation of the bible) vs. learning to be---and accepting---oneself.  Brady, finally, epiphanies (please let me make that a verb) that he can be who he is.......and still have his religion.  As he, in a closing scene, says to his mother:  ""I just want you to love me"".......then forgives her after she replies she can't change either.Lastly, for myself and others of you who are observant and find positive meanings in such things, I'd like to ask that you remember the place to which Brady finds his way in the film's final scene is that very same beach-side location at which he first encountered Clifford.  We are now sure with whom his thoughts remain.  Plus, this realization then reminds me most tellingly of a bit of conversation occurring the morning following their night of love making.  Laying in Clifford's embrace, Brady is asked by him:  ""How're you feeling?""  Very significantly, Brady's answer simply is:  ""Safe.""  (Can any of you think of a more meaningful response to one's lover in this situation?).PS--Oh, yeah, and who's to say that there isn't a good prospect of a ""reunion"" between a more accepting, ""reborn"" Brady and a Clifford---whose mother, after all, will still be needing a son's visits at her Rock Haven home?***This film is becoming ""Addictive."" ***Other such habit formers:  ""Brokeback

Whilst the movie, acting and script are disappointing within themselves what is most heartbreaking is the utter failure of its message. The movie attempts to explore one of the most complex and at times destructive components of human experience, being the influence of faith and the faithful (for want of a better description) on one's identity and sense of self. It merely scratches the surface of what is in reality a profound inner conflict, more accurately portrayed as war of conflicting emotions and which is capable of utter destruction. In order to do this successfully the movie would require a far better script, and actors capable of portraying such emotion without losing the audience.Rock Haven achieves none of this, and like drying paint is tedious to watch.

1102168,A3IQABCF9L5G9G,B000VKJ6UE,Mr. Film Guy,"[7, 9]","I confess I ordered this DVD with fear that this would be another poorly made ""first film"" with a poor script, poor direction and bad acting.****WRONG!*****  What I found instead was a well made, loving,  and powerful little film, which I have quite fallen in love with and have already viewed at least ten times (yes, it DOES hold up to repeat viewings, with little ""moments"" and subtleties yet to be discovered).Although this is a low budget independent effort, what it lacks in polish it more than makes up for in ""heart"".  It has some flaws, but they are very minor in comparison to the power and sincerety of the film as a whole.The story deals with a young religious man who, with his mom, has just moved to a small but beautiful coastal town, and his budding romance with the (very ""out"") boy who lives a couple of houses down.  That sounds very blah, but the film is enlivened by very sincere and professional performances by a really good cast (overall).Of course what makes it interesting is the religious angle.  This is a Bible-studying, sincerely dedicated boy--- not someone who is ""casual"" about his religion.  How will he reconcile his Bible viewpoint with his growing love for the dishy guy down the street?Another thing that makes ROCK HAVEN  ring truer than other films tackling these issues is that the boy and his mom --both devout Bible followers-- are not presented as religious bigots or hateful people, but just people who are mentally committed to a certain viewpoint.  Of course, those viewpoints are about to be tested!Also, the boy down the street is presented as open-minded and quietly confident in his gayness,  not as a gay crusader out to offend the Christians by being ""in-your-face"" all the time.  He is willing to at least try reading the Bible (when given one by the other boy), and he is willing to consider the possibility that God has brought the two together.  So, like the main character, his character also has an arc, is stretched, and grows over the course of the story as a result of his relationship with the religious boy.  In several ways, the film shows that he (at least to some degree) comes to respect the faith of his religious friend.To me, ROCK HAVEN is a sweet, heartfelt film which tackled some tough issues in a loving and peaceful way-- issues which often are not handled in that manner.  It is not a ""deep"" film; it doesn't offer a lot of answers.  But it does deal with the issues in a way that seems compassionate to both ""sides"", and at the same time, remains emotionally honest and truthful.The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but those who love a happy ending will find plenty of clear foreshadowing in the film to indicate what the REAL after-film ending to the story will be.  :-)  :-)ROCK HAVEN's  weak points are:  the performance by the filmmaker himself as the pastor (what was he thinking??  This is the ONLY weak performance in the film and, thankfully, is such a very minor role that it really does not hurt the film at all.  It is just a shame for that to be the only flaw in a film with otherwise top-notch performances); and a script which, though good, could have been stronger and tighter.Strong points are:  the casting and performances overall (with the one minor exception)  are strong, heartfelt, of completely professional calibre, and come across as sincere.  The romance between the two boys is palpable, including the best romantic slow-dancing scene since BEAUTIFUL THING (and in some ways even better than BT).  And, as mentioned, the film also has a beautiful scenic setting and ""sense of place"".The film is well directed (with the exception of a few times when the novice director crosses his stage line; however, since those scenes are usually two-people scenes this is not confusing).  ROCK HAVEN is very well edited (by the director).The romance between the main characters is palpable and sincere.  I hate it when kisses come off as stale because one or both actors is straight and cannot pull off a convincingly romantic gay kiss (a problem in many ""mainstream"" gay themed films).  But in ROCK HAVEN the kisses  seem SO real and SO uninhibited that one would swear that the two actors must be having an affair off screen.The film was shot in and around California's Bodega Bay and there is a lot of gorgeous costal scenery.  (Being a fan of Hitchcock's THE BIRDS I was interested to see the area on screen again).  However, although ROCK HAVEN is generally well directed and well edited, the director does slightly over use the scenic shots as transitions between scenes (better transitions should have been written into the script).  However, the scenery is **NOT** on screen more than the actors, as another reviewer joked (LOL); the over use of scenic shots is slight.The PLUS side of the scenic shots is that they lend the film has a real and palpable ""sense of place"" which is unusual for a first-time shot-on-video effort, and which gives the film a sort of casual reality and modest grandeur which raises it's production values considerably.Thematically, it is interesting to see how some of the character(s) hold on to their faith, and at the same time modify their views to accomodate the reality that presents itself, although the issues are presented in the context of a coming-of-age romance,  and not as a preachy ""issue oriented"" film.I've watched ROCK HAVEN over several times already and I think it's going to become one of my personal favorites.  It is very sweet and romantic.  Admittedly, it is not ""great cinema"" by a long shot, but it IS *several*  very BIG steps above most low-budget directorial first time efforts and is, in some respects (heart, locale, sincerety) a WHOLE LOT better than many gay-themed movies with big bucks and big Hollywood stars (IMO).Director David Lewis will be a talent to watch for in the future, as will the two lead actors, Sean Hoagland and Owen Alabado.This is one of those ""little films that could"".  It is a small film, with a big payoff.  I give it five stars because, although it does have it's flaws, they are minor in comparison to the beauty, sincerety, heart and power of this simple story well told.Also, suprisingly, it is lower priced than many similar films.  Why not give it a try?  You may fall in love with it, just as I did, much to my suprise!",5,POWERFUL  &  TOUCHING !,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,6311,"['confess', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'fear', 'would', 'be', 'poorly', 'made',

The scenery was spectacular and the storyline was the tops but it was sadly let down by the two main actors in my mind.Sean Hoagland is a good actor and looks the part but in this movie he was clearly too old for his role and if he had acted it more maturely he would have been credible but he tended to over act it tying to make his part a boy of 18 and in doing so he came over as if he was rather simple. This spoilt it for me completely.Owen Alabado I had never heard of and his acting in my eyes was dreadful from start to finish. Was he so obviously taken in with his own image that it reflected on his performance? He pranced and preened all the way through the movie and was not good at all. He was expressionless in most scenes which again was distracting. This is my opinion and I will not want to see any more movies by him - has he made any??To end, it could have been a top movie but was let down by the acting in my mind.

According to this film you embrace it and try to get someone you care for to embrace it also. I inadvertently lose respect for persons who subjugate themselves to the very thing that is destroying their lives without questioning or validating it's authenticity. Brady is gay and religious, uh-oh...now we have a problem, because in Brady's religion homosexuality is a ""sin"". Brady never questions what he should have in the first place, does God even exist, or is his religion the ""correct"" one since there are approximately 33,830 Christian denominations in the world (World Christian Encyclopedia - 2001). He ""feels"" close to God at ""Rock Haven"" because it's pretty. I wonder if he could find that feeling in areas that God seems to neglect.Religion adapts to it's environment, when the legitimacy of something becomes well known and evident (being gay is not a choice) religion evolves to embrace it so that religion will not be eradicated and lose it's control. Isn't it just possible that the idea of God is the cause of many problems in the world? That the naive ""child-like faith"" that many embrace as being a benefit is actually a curse, a detriment, and an avenue of control by religions, governments, corporations, institutions, and yes, even parents? Just like a little child who is paralyzed by fear ""believing"" that there is a monster in the closet, the constant threat of a disapproving God incapacitates ""believers"" to the point that reality is disregarded. However, even without this element the film seems like an after-school special with the ""special"" removed. The conflict in the film is like a paper-cut, annoying but bearable enough to disregard.

A young man and devout Christian, Brady, relocates with his mother to the seaside town of Rock Haven ... where his faith, and previous desire for other boys, are both put to the test when he finds himself attracted to (and falling for) a local young man named Clifford, who is both gay and unapologetic about it. Each both tries to teach the other about his side of the coin, even as the two grow closer and indeed a relationship beyond friends develops between them. But can faith win out over love - or are the two intertwined?

Living in the bible belt, as I do, I know that religion plays a huge part in how the gay youth experience accepting themselves, or never accepting who they are. The movie showed very well how much of a struggle it is for someone who is constantly told that being gay is an abominal sin, which will result in them going to hell. They have to learn to break away from that and accept what their heart tells them instead of what religions tell them.

This movie leaves the viewer with a feeling of sadness but also of satisfaction. Sadness because the two main characters separate, satisfaction because one of the main characters becomes a more open minded person and learns to accept himself, flaws and all.

1102181,A2IQUPNFOC79FT,B000VKJ6UE,Vegan Marcos,"[3, 5]","I recently had an opportunity to rent this movie and I'm glad that is was just a rental. I won't set up the story since that's already been done. You're here reading my review because you want a second, or a third opinion of what I liked or didn't like.First, the story was a genuinely sweet coming of age movie about a young man coming to terms with his sexuality and his faith. Sean Hoagland was ok in the role of Brady. However, as a Meisnerite actor (one who has studied the Sanford Meisner process), I can tell you that the performance of the two leads felt very staged. I almost felt as if a puppet show wouldn't be more entertaining. Both lead actors had trouble figuring out what to do when the had to speak or interact. For example, Brady goes over to Clifford's home and says that he ""has a gift for him"" after he sits on Clifford's bed. This whole scene appeared to be very difficult for both guys. The actor playing Clifford had no expression on his face after Brady made this statement. I found this same issue throughout the film with both leads. They both seemed to have trouble and tried, maybe too hard, to act. They didn't inhabit these charaters, they simply read the lines. If it weren't for the two mothers, Laura Jane Coles(Marty), Katheryn Hecht(Angie) and Clifford's friend, Erin Daily(Peggy), the movie might have been unbearable for me to watch.Beyond this, the story is a sweet one and I believe a triumph for David Lewis. I believe this was his first film and he got his point across in a very sweet way. However, I don't know if the wooden acting of the two leads was his fault or the actor's themselves. It's possible that Mr. Lewis, like a few directors, limited the creative freedom of his actors and limited them to simply reading the lines. However, most directors who want to work, or get their work noticed, realize that it's the work of fine actors that resonate with the audience first and the film itself later.Lastly, I do want to offer kudos, yes this review is not all bad, for the wonderful choice of location for this film. It was filmed close to San Francisco in Bodega Bay and the scenery was quite lovely! All in all, this movie was an ok movie and it is my hope that both actors have ""grown"" since this production. I did see promise in both actors and wish them much success but I would hope that they have each grown and are now doing more and acting less.Heck, if anyone say Linda Carter in the first season of Wonder Woman, then you know it's possible to grow as an actor. Just watch season one and then season two and you'll see an amazing transformation. Linda Carter stopped reading the lines of Wonder Woman and started living the character truthfully. When this happened Wonder Woman, for me, was far more believable.So, rent this movie but don't buy it. If you really want to see a ""Great"" coming of age, coming to terms movie, then go watch the brilliant film, Shelter! The acting was incredible, the story was great and everything worked. In fact, a friend of mine, who is gay, tells me that Shelter appears on multiple gay film lists in the top ten for best gay movies.",3,Movie was OK,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,3129,"['recently', 'had', 'opportunity', 'rent', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'just', 'rental', 'wo', ""n't"", 'set', 'up', 'story', 'already', 'been', 'done', ""'re"", 'here', 'reading', 'review', 'want', 'second', 'third', 'opinion', 'what', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'like.First', 'story', 'was', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'young', 'man', 'coming', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'faith', 'Sean', 'Hoagland', 'was', 'ok', 'role', 'Brady', 'However', 'Meisnerite', 'actor', 'one', 'who', 'studied', 'Sanford', 'Meisner', 'process', 'can', 'tell', 'performance', 'two', 'leads', 'felt', 'very', 'staged', 'almost', 'felt', 'puppet', 'show', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'lead', 'actors', 'had', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'when', 'had', 'speak', 'interact', 'example', 'Brady', 'Clifford', 'home', 'gift', 'Clifford', 'bed', 'whole', 'scene', 'appeared', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'guys', 'actor', 'playing', 'Clifford', 'had', 'expression', 'face', 'Brady', 'made', 'statement', 'found', 'same', 'issue', 'film', 'leads', 'seemed', 'have', 'trouble', 'tried', 'maybe', 'too', 'hard', 'act', 'did', ""n't"", 'inhabit', 'charaters', 'simply', 'read', 'lines', 'were', ""n't"", 'two', 'mothers', 'Laura', 'Jane', 'Coles', 'Marty', 'Katheryn', 'Hecht', 'Angie', 'Clifford', 'friend', 'Erin', 'Daily', 'Peggy', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'unbearable', 'watch.Beyond', 'story', 'sweet', 'one', 'believe', 'triumph', 'David', 'Lewis', 'believe', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'got', 'point', 'very', 'sweet', 'way', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'wooden', 'acting', 'two', 'leads', 'was', 'fault', 'actor', 'possible', 'Mr.', 'Lewis', 'few', 'directors', 'limited', 'creative', 'freedom', 'actors', 'limited', 'simply', 'reading', 'lines', 'However', 'most', 'directors', 'who', 'want', 'work', 'get', 'work', 'noticed', 'realize', 'work', 'fine', 'actors', 'resonate', 'audience', 'first', 'film', 'later.Lastly', 'do', 'want', 'offer', 'kudos', 'yes', 'review', 'not', 'bad', 'wonderful', 'choice', 'location', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', 'close', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bodega', 'Bay', 'scenery', 'was', 'quite', 'lovely', 'movie', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'hope', 'actors', 'have', 'grown', 'production', 'did', 'see', 'promise', 'actors', 'wish', 'much', 'success', 'would', 'hope', 'have', 'grown', 'are', 'now', 'doing', 'more', 'acting', 'less.Heck', 'anyone', 'say', 'Linda', 'Carter', 'first', 'season', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'then', 'know', 'possible', 'grow', 'actor', 'Just', 'watch', 'season', 'one', 'then', 'season', 'two', ""'ll"", 'see', 'amazing', 'transformation', 'Linda', 'Carter', 'stopped', 'reading', 'lines', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'started', 'living', 'character', 'truthfully', 'When', 'happened', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'believable.So', 'rent', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Great', 'coming', 'age', 'coming', 'terms', 'movie', 'then', 'go', 'watch', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Shelter', 'acting', 'was', 'incredible', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'everything', 'worked', 'fact', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'gay', 'Shelter', 'multiple', 'gay', 'film', 'lists', 'top', 'ten', 'best', 'gay', 'movies']",Rock Haven
