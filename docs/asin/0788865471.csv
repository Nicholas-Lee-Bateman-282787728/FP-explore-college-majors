84584,A21ZOGMPS0Y1OU,0788865471,Abbey and Emma's mommy,"[26, 30]","First off, my local grocery store obviously accidentally put this out early because I bought it today, 4 days before the release date.  So I bought it for my 1 yr old girl who loves, loves baby einstein.My review of it was it was ok.  I was pretty excited about it coming out thinking it was going to be great but like I said it was just ok.  I feel like it lacked visual colors that stimulate babies and toddlers.  It also didn't have alot of the cutesy things in the dvd that I always wonder where they get this stuff( like toys playing instruments, ect).  It mainly used alot of teenagers playing instruments, showing bands playing, and it used the puppets alot more that some of the other dvds.  I do think that a toddler watching this would definetly understand that music is something you can make and do, If it keeps their attention long enough.I liked the recent 'on the go' dvd alot more and so did my baby.",3,"Bought movie today, 4 days early....",1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,916,"['First', 'off', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'obviously', 'accidentally', 'put', 'out', 'early', 'bought', 'today', '4', 'days', 'release', 'date', 'bought', '1', 'yr', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'baby', 'einstein.My', 'review', 'was', 'was', 'ok', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'coming', 'out', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'great', 'said', 'was', 'just', 'ok', 'feel', 'lacked', 'visual', 'colors', 'stimulate', 'babies', 'toddlers', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'alot', 'cutesy', 'things', 'dvd', 'always', 'wonder', 'where', 'get', 'stuff', 'toys', 'playing', 'instruments', 'ect', 'mainly', 'used', 'alot', 'teenagers', 'playing', 'instruments', 'showing', 'bands', 'playing', 'used', 'puppets', 'alot', 'more', 'other', 'dvds', 'do', 'think', 'toddler', 'watching', 'would', 'definetly', 'understand', 'music', 'something', 'can', 'make', 'do', 'attention', 'long', 'enough.I', 'liked', 'recent', 'go', 'dvd', 'alot', 'more', 'so', 'did', 'baby']",N/A
84585,A2HUKDYPATWREE,0788865471,Albert E.,"[1, 1]","I had high hopes for what Disney could produce with Meet the Orchestra because we all know that when it comes to music, you can't start too young.  The educational value of this DVD was limited and I would characterize it mostly as entertainment.  It introduced the sight and sound (albeit synthesized) of the orchestral instruments.  That's nice, but it is nothing a baby wouldn't have to watch more than a few times to learn.For baby's musical development, my favorite baby DVD was Trebellina, which teaches notes pitch and tackles a number of instruments, instroducing them individually as well as together.  There is a lot there to challenge baby (and my kids found it pretty darn entertaining as well).

I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",4,AAP recommends no tv before 2,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1917,"[""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'children', 'video', 'means', 'buy', 'video', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'older', 'child', 'highly', 'recommend', 'compared', 'other', 'kids', 'videos', 'engaging', 'fun', 'educational', 'not', 'cartoon', 'animated', 'fast-paced.Having', 'said', 'have', 'beef', 'title', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'marketing', 'BABIES', 'imply', 'watching', 'videos', 'good', 'babies', 'are', 'NOT', 'videos', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'older', 'kids', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'babies', 'brains', 'research', 'found', 'out', '1', 'brain', 'wave', 'activity', 'babies', 'slower', 'when', 'watching', 'television', 'when', 'sleeping', '2', 'hour', 'television', 'baby', 'day', 'chances', 'acquiring', 'attention', 'deficit', 'disorder', 'increases', '10', '%', '3', 'hour', 'television', 'viewed', 'daily', '4', 'yrs', 'old', 'significant', 'odds', 'increase', 'being', 'bully', 'later', '4', 'consistent', 'heavy', 'television', 'viewing', 'more', '2', 'hrs', 'daily', 'early', 'childhood', 'can', 'cause', 'behavior', 'sleep', 'attention', 'problems.The', 'American', 'Academy', 'Pediatrics', 'television', 'children', '2', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'media', 'tv', 'videos', 'video', 'games', 'computers', 'daily', 'age', '2', 'think', 'important', 'parents', 'caregivers', 'be', 'aware', 'can', 'make', 'better', 'informed', 'choices', 'hope', 'people', 'limit', 'television', 'usage', 'babies', 'look', 'other', 'outlets', 'when', 'possible.For', 'looking', 'calm', 'babies', 'build', 'better', 'brains', 'recommend', 'baby', 'carriers', 'studies', 'show', 'infants', 'who', 'are', 'carried', 'extra', '3', 'hours', 'day', 'cry', '40', '%', 'less', 'effect', 'lasting', 'time', 'Frequently', 'held', 'babies', 'pick', 'up', 'verbal', 'skills', 'faster', 'develop', 'better', 'core', 'muscle', 'strength', 'balance', 'Also', 'learning', 'communicate', 'sign', 'language', 'can', 'reduce', 'frustration', 'tantrums', 'accelerate', 'language', 'development', 'promote', 'parent-child', 'bonding', 'infants', 'toddlers']",N/A
