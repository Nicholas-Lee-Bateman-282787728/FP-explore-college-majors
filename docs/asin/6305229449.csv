She has a little dragon with her, Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy), sent by her ancestors to protect her from danger.  Mushu is the highlight of the movie!  Though the lines are not quite as funny as what you'd expect them to be for Eddie Murphy, he is the best part of the show.Good movie.  The animation is wonderful. It's just not one of those movies that my family requests to watch very often at all.  It is at the back of the pile of Disney movies now - waiting to be requested again.

455077,A39GB8QKJDWKRK,6305229449,"A.C. ""toonstuff""","[4, 5]","The Huns are attacking China, and the wise and good Emperor has requested  that one man from each household join his army to protect the land.  Fa  Mulan's father, very conscious of the honor it is to serve the Emperor,  accepts this command, even though he is severely crippled.Knowing her  father will die if he goes to war, Mulan steals his armor and disguises  herself as a man, taking his place in the army.  Joined by the cute  Cri-Kee, her horse, Khan, and a has-been dragon spirit named Mushu, Mulan  attempts to bring honor to her family, her Emperor, and herself.The  Chinese theme of Mulan is played very strongly in the art, which is  reminiscent of Chinese watercolors.  The movie, though very stylized, has  the feeling of the classic Disney films.The characters of Mulan and her  sidekicks are descent people trying desperately to solve a very serious  problem.  The audience can really sympathize with them, and cheer for them,  and cry for them...The music is entertaining... More rock than  classical, but still with that Disney feel to it.  The musical numbers are  all well done and entertaining, and the score is wonderfully written.The  lead male character/love interest, a soldier with a lineage of service in  the army, is fairly flat...  There's not much to him other than his  single-minded goal of beating the Huns out of China.At some points,  Mulan does resort some fairly obvious pop humor, ala Aladdin, which breaks  the mood and reality of the story.  Some moments are played over the top,  comedy wise, and in general this does not help the movie.The movie ends  rather abruptly, though it is on a high note.  There isn't much time for a  resolution to the tale, and the viewer may be left wanting more.  (Maybe  that's good for Disney....)Overall Impression:  No question about it,  this is one Disney film that is worth owning.  The few bad points are far  outweighed by the good, and it is, as I have stated, a very entertaining  movie.Those of you with children...  There are some tense battle images  in this film.  On the flipside, Mulan is a good role model in that she  sacrifices her own desires to keep another person safe...

455079,A6NJ1GAUXC1JW,6305229449,A Customer,"[14, 85]","Mulan is the epitome of everything wrong with Disney right now.For starters, understand that Mulan is not so much a movie, as it is a ""product.""  First and foremost, the impetus behind Mulan is to generate maximum commerical consumption through endorsements of sugar-coated breakfast cereals, fast food, fruit snacks, and the launching of a whole line of toys, clothing, and other merchandise; the details and quality of the actual ""movie"" are ancillary and secondary concerns.While utilizing some remarkable animation, the film itself is as flimsy as the toys you get with the McDonald's Happy Meal.  Another example of shameful corporate pandering to politically correct and feminist ideology, Mulan fits perfect into the string of PC Nineties films released by Disney (Pocohontas, Hunchback, etc.,), in which everything ""western,"" ""Christian,"" ""male"" or ""traditional"" etc., is portrayed as bad, while its opposite, is of course, good.  For example, Mulan single-handedly (1) destroys the entire Hun army (2) saves the Emporer of China's life, and (3) armed with nothing but a hand fan, wastes the Hun leader - because ""Girls Kick Butt.""  Men, on the other hand, are portrayed throughout the film as fumbling, bumbling, nose-picking idiots who provide comic relief.The songs and lyrics - take ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" (a song intended to show us how ""dumb"" and ""chauvenistic"" men are) or ""Honor to Us All"" - are weak, canned, second-rate material fit for a Christopher Guest ""spoof-umentary"" of Walt Disney musicals in the vein of ""Second Wind,"" or ""Spinal Tap.""And for good measure, Disney had to make sure to throw in plenty of inappropriate sexual/body function/bathroom humor for a ""family"" film that still somehow garnered a ""G"" rating.  Lots of yucks are provided for example, in a story-line that could easily work in a soft-core flick as Mulan frolics in a lake with a bunch of nude men, herself naked.  While no nudity is actually shown, it is MORE than implied as the men prod her to join in a game of ""King of the Rock.""  Faithful sidekick Mushu saves the day, however, by biting one of the men's ""butts"" to create a diversion.  As Mulan makes her getaway, she proclaims that she never wants to see another naked man as long as she lives - but not before the entire chinese army parades past her in the buff on their way to the lake.  Nice.Of course, the antics in Mulan pale in comparison to the gross-out gags/inappropriate content in other ""family"" movies like Shrek, and later Disney films, Lilo & Stitch and Home on the Range.  However, its sad that Disney felt it had to compromise its art and include any of this kind of material in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator.And finally, the story.  Sheer Disney.  While trying to appear politically correct by using a non-Western story and characters, the film quite remarkably had the opposite effect.  It turned off Asian-American audiences in droves by its stereotypical and offensive portrayals of its Asian characters - complete with slanty eyes and buck teeth -, mindless and racist assumptions about Chinese culture, and an apparent inability to distinguish amongst Asian cultures throughout the movie (complete with Chinese chracters wearing Japanese style kimonos as they perform a Japanese tea ceremony and Huns - a Central Asian Turkic People - drawn like Mongol Hordes.  Oh well, I guess if you're Disney, ""all those asians look alike"" anyway...).The story of Mulan itself - a character from Chinese literature and folklore - was ""Disneyfied"" per usual to fit the Hollywood formula and social agenda of Disney, much to the dismay of those familiar with the REAL Mulan. In the end, Disney's shallow and crass attempt to ""embrace diversity"" was revealed for what it was.As long as Disney remains a soulless corporation, controlled by money-grubbing CEO's like Michael Eisner, who's only concern is maximizing profits, this is the best you can hope for.  Its no surprise that the only worthwhile thing to come out of Disney during its self-proclaimed rebirth, has been Fantasia 2000 - the pet project of Walt Disney's own son, Roy Disney, who incidentally was pivotal in trying to wrest the control of Disney from Eisner.Like I said, the animation is good stuff.  Watch it and be moderately entertained for an hour; laugh at Eddie Murphy's one-liners.

When I received this, I was so excited! And as a Chinese, I'm proud of Mulan and her heroic tale!I didn't expect the tableaux would be better, because the original ones were good enough. What I adored was many bonus features about the movie, espcially things in disc 2. I've never heard the French version soundtrack of ""Mulan"", and it was in disc 2. I listened to it and felt it was good but not so good as the original version. I loved ""Reflection"" Chinese version which was performed by CoCo. I've listened to CoCo's version before, because some of my friends loved her songs very much. I thought Jackie Chan's ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You"" was excellent too, and I'm a big fan of him!But my favourite part was the video record of the making of ""Mulan"". I was very excited to see this, because it seemed that Disney thought much of Chinese culture. The making of ""Mulan"" showed something we have never know about Mulan. And there was some photos of Chinese which was taken during the producing of ""Mulan"". To my amazement, I heard a poem about the heroic tale of Mulan which was written in Nan-Bei Dynasty, read in English! I couldn't help smiling when I heard this, all because of excitement and pride. I thought I would learn this English version by heart! I was so happy that this 2-disc special edition DVD showed Chinese culture and mien of people to the world!Through this 2-disc special edition DVD, I knew how Disney producers think about Chinese and our culture, and the world thinks much of China!

Since Disney is traditionally very big on old-fashioned girly girls, I was not at all certain how this story of a girl who dresses up in armor and passes herself off as a boy in order to join the Chinese army and fight the invading Huns would work out. Turns out it's really pretty good. The premise is that she donned her father's armor to save him from conscription since he was wounded in the service of the Emperor years before. It was clear he was unfit for duty, but the conscription officers demanded one man from every family, and Mulan had no brothers.She has two magical allies: a dragon (Eddie Murphy at his best) who was sent by her ancestors to protect and aid her, and a cricket given to her by her grandmother for good luck. Grandmother didn't know about the idea of going to war, of course; she had brought the cricket for good luck when Mulan was presented to the matchmaker. That didn't go well at all. But the cricket turns out to be pretty darn lucky anyway.My favorite part of the movie is the training camp, where the captain who is ruggedly handsome and the General's son is set the nearly impossible task of training the sorriest bunch of recruits you've ever seen. Mulan (called Ping as a boy) ends up being one of the best recruits, with courage, agility and cleverness more than making up for lack of bulk. Still, the company is really not ready when they are tricked into believing the general has called them to the front.No, I won't give any more away, except to say that there is a good bit of humor, lots of creativity and surprises, and the predictable part that Mulan becomes a hero and wins the romantic attention of the handsome captain.The dragon is a little guy, but arguably the best character in the whole movie.",4,Better Than I Expected,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1788,"['one', 'better', 'expected', 'Disney', 'traditionally', 'very', 'big', 'old-fashioned', 'girly', 'girls', 'was', 'not', 'certain', 'how', 'story', 'girl', 'who', 'up', 'armor', 'passes', 'off', 'boy', 'order', 'join', 'Chinese', 'army', 'fight', 'invading', 'Huns', 'would', 'work', 'out', 'out', 'really', 'pretty', 'good', 'premise', 'donned', 'father', 'armor', 'save', 'conscription', 'was', 'wounded', 'service', 'Emperor', 'years', 'before', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'unfit', 'duty', 'conscription', 'officers', 'demanded', 'one', 'man', 'family', 'Mulan', 'had', 'brothers.She', 'two', 'magical', 'allies', 'dragon', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'best', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'ancestors', 'protect', 'aid', 'cricket', 'given', 'grandmother', 'good', 'luck', 'Grandmother', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'idea', 'going', 'war', 'course', 'had', 'brought', 'cricket', 'good', 'luck', 'when', 'Mulan', 'was', 'presented', 'matchmaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'cricket', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'darn', 'lucky', 'anyway.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'training', 'camp', 'where', 'captain', 'who', 'ruggedly', 'handsome', 'General', 'son', 'set', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'task', 'training', 'sorriest', 'bunch', 'recruits', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Mulan', 'called', 'Ping', 'boy', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'recruits', 'courage', 'agility', 'cleverness', 'more', 'making', 'up', 'lack', 'bulk', 'Still', 'company', 'really', 'not', 'ready', 'when', 'are', 'tricked', 'believing', 'general', 'called', 'front.No', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'more', 'away', 'say', 'good', 'bit', 'humor', 'lots', 'creativity', 'surprises', 'predictable', 'part', 'Mulan', 'hero', 'romantic', 'attention', 'handsome', 'captain.The', 'dragon', 'little', 'guy', 'arguably', 'best', 'character', 'whole', 'movie']",Mulan VHS

455105,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6305229449,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","Mulan in many ways is probably one of the better ones that Disney made before making some really subpar fluff. Pocahontas was disappointing and Hercules was a bit too light-hearted to be taken seriously. Even with comic relief, Mulan wants to be taken seriously too and that's why it works. Not a classic really but still well made.Film's set in China with Mulan trying to impress the matchmaker to find a husband. Only things don't go so well, and things get worse when Mulan's ailing father is called into war with the Huns. Not wanting to risk her father's life, Mulan takes his armor and sword and rides off. Her family guardians don't want her to leave so they summon a dragon, only they get Mushu instead, a very tiny lizard-like wisecracker. Along for the ride is Cri-Kee, a lucky bug, to help save the Emperor.Disney was heavily starting to use CG more often and combining traditional animation and it's still impressive to see. Each Disney release usually has that one big action scene or animation showcase: the dance in Beauty and the Beast, stampede in Lion King and the Hydra fight in Hercules. Here we get an avalanche and it still looks cool. My only problem is there's not really enough wide shots, we're very close to it and would've been nice to see all of it.Eddie Murphy in many ways is like a more tolerable Robin Williams. They're both very manic and hyperactive comedic wise but Eddie's not as energetic, which is why Mushu works, he knows how to dial it down. The rest of the cast is quite good, including Ming-Wa, known from the Joy Luck Club and ER. The other cast you probably wouldn't recognize since it's not huge like James Woods or Mel Gibson, which works just fine.One thing that doesn't work with the film is the songs.

I'm refering to the profusion of westernised accents (especially Eddie Murphy's) and the songs.  I find them very jarring in the presence of  the beautifully rendered visuals of the Great Wall, Mulan's homestead, etc.For kids, at least for western kids, this is certainly not a fatal  flaw, but it does lower the enjoyment for me.  A movie like Aladdin seems  to do a better job presenting a west-friendly version of the culture,  rather than a parody thereof.Having complained about that, however, I  have to say this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Murphy's dragon  (forgetting the American slang) is highly entertaining, Mulan is a heroine  you want to cheer for, and the supporting characters are lovable.  The  villian is a little flat (especially when compared with my favourites,  Gaston and Jafar), but he is certainly menacing.  Maybe a bit too menacing  for really small children - this movie seems little intense for the really  young kids.The extras are not impressive, since they had to cram both  the letterbox and P&amp;S on the same disc.

One feels the figures stepped  right off those delicate and antiquated sheets of paper, and in essence, became timeless.Our story begins with the grim scenario of the Mongolian leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer)  and his troops  crossing over the newly constructed Great Wall of China to invade the country. The Emperor( Pat Morita) orders that conscriptions be formed by all Chinese men capable of serving.Elsewhere, in a lovely province, the farm girl who will make a difference is preparing for a meeting with the village matchmaker(Miriam Margoyles). We first meet young Fa Mulan( voiced by Ming Na and sung by Lea Salonga) as she employs the service of her dog, ""Little Brother"" ( Chris Sanders) in helping her feed the chickens in an innovative way that goes awry, resulting in her father Fa Zhou's (Soon Tek Oh) praying even harder for the success of his awkward daughter on that day. Her mother Fa Li(Freda Foh Shen), and Grandmother Fa(voiced by June Foray, and sung by Marni Nixon) help prepare her by helping to dress and presenting her with good luck charms, including the little cricket, Cri-Kee(Frank Welker), whose name, I somehow have reason to believe, isn't as Chinese as it sounds...Long story short, the visit with the matchmaker doesn't go well, and Mulan is in a funk about yet another failure despite her father's attempt to console her.Soon messengers reach the village calling for them men to join the army. When Fa sees that her father, who has served before is physically unable to re-enlist, she ignores the fact that women caught serving in the army will be executed, stops listening to the voices that tell her she is forgetting her place as a woman, and does what her heart tells her is right, cutting her hair, taking her father's armour, and riding off one rainy night to serve in his place.Pausing for a moment to find inspiration, and hoping for a guardian, Mulan will soon get her wish in the form of the little dragon Mushu( voiced by Eddie Murphy, without the ""gai pan""), who despite the objections of the First Ancestor ( George Takei), and the other ancestors due to a past failure, takes it upon himself to see Mulan through the battle, along with little  Cri-Kee  and Mulan's horse, Khan( also voiced by Frank Welker).What I found amusing about the ancestral tete-a-tete was that, having lived in Hawaii, with its large Chinese population they reminded me of people I knew when I was young.Mulan soon arrives at the Army camp where she encounters the other recruits, including the feisty one-eyed Yao ( Harvey Firestein), the joker, Ling (Gedde Wantanabe), and the  gentle giant, Chein-Po (Jerry Tondo).She also deals with the officious official Chi Fu (James Hong), but is impressed by the strong young commanding officer Shang(voiced by B.D Wong and sung by Donny Osmond), whose father General Li (James Shigeta) is facing combat elsewhere.While failing to make a good first impression, Mulan eventually inspires the men when she succeeds at the first test Shang gave the recruits.Soon, we follow the troops on marches through the beautiful countryside, and see the evil Shan-Yu and his forces drawing closer.Mushu and Cri-Kee either cover for Mulan, to prevent her from being exposed, or take matters into their own hands in altering the course of events.The climax of this story is a dramatic confrontation with the Mongols in the snowy mountains, where Mulan discovers a way to cut the strength from behind Shan-Yu when the power of his forces seems overwhelming.Wounded in battle after saving Shang's life, Mulan is soon discovered to be female. While Shang spares her as an act of reciprocity, he orders the troops to move out and he will have no more to do with her.But Mulan's work isn't finished yet: Having seen the Huns pop out of the snow, she hurries to warn the men, who soon realize they must follow her lead in order to defeat Shan-Yu. The finale is spectacular, and she who saves China pretty much saves the world--or at least most of it.What makes this a great story for children is that they see the imperfections of Mulan, Mushu, and Cri-Kee, but they can learn about perseverance in spite of past failures because these characters believe in themselves and their ability to do good.--A highly recommendable tale told with

The songs are highly unmemorable (as I sit here writing this, I can only remember the line, ""I'll make a man out of you,"" which is from the very worst song ever including in a Disney film.  By the way, will Disney ever have a ""training session"" that will last more than a couple minutes and that isn't put to a song? They did that to this movie, Hercules, Tarzan (who also grew into an adult instantaneously), and Beauty and the Beast (in that Belle changes her mind about the Beast during a song).  One more really bad thing about Mulan--Mushu is a total hinderance. I'm not just talking about his pop-culture mouth (which someone should have popped), but that he in fact causes more problems than he solves. Would it really be so much to ask if Mulan could have made the mistake that ""gave away our position,"" instead of having Mushu shoot off a rocket? At least that way, she's redeeming her own mistake, instead of someone elses, which gives no emotional payoff. Better yet, why not have the falcon find the line of troops--after all, that's what the falcon is for, right? It scouted earlier for the general's encampment and brought back the doll, remember?  Oh, and the cross-dressing thing at the end was a little too weird--a bit too Fushigi Yugi and not really very intelligent--do you honestly think that anybody would fall for that trick, even if they were really women (especially considering what the Monguls would have done).  The best parts of the movie were the references to Japanese cartoons (anime). When Mushu fries the feathers off of the falcon, it looks like a Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, but is just as likely a reference to the horseclaws from Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind (the director, apparently, is a devotee of Miyazaki). Another Nausicaa reference--the doll, which is similar to the one that Lord Yupa finds at the beginning of the Nausicaa movie (it crumbles, and Yupa says, ""Another village has died.""). Also, Mulan's hair is given incredible attention, which is not usually the case in Disney films (usually they're just pretty and blow in the wind). Just watch her hair when she bows in shame after they find out she's a she!  Beyond that, there is a good deal of emotional content, though once the possibility of execution is lifted (a life for a life), it is never mentioned again--even though the overseer, who really hated her, could have had her executed at a moments notice once she caught back up with them. And I'm sorry, but for all their knowledge and art, the Chinese were rather steadfast about their ways and about honor--they would not suddenly become so accepting of women, especially since they are still rather unaccepting of women.",5,Pretty Good,1222473600,"09 27, 2008",2008,2765,"['do', 'still', 'sing', 'sort', 'narration', 'emotions', 'songs', 'are', 'highly', 'unmemorable', 'sit', 'here', 'writing', 'can', 'only', 'remember', 'line', ""'ll"", 'make', 'man', 'very', 'worst', 'song', 'ever', 'including', 'Disney', 'film', 'way', 'will', 'Disney', 'ever', 'have', 'training', 'session', 'will', 'last', 'more', 'couple', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'put', 'song', 'did', 'movie', 'Hercules', 'Tarzan', 'who', 'also', 'grew', 'adult', 'instantaneously', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Belle', 'mind', 'Beast', 'song', 'One', 'more', 'really', 'bad', 'thing', 'Mulan', 'Mushu', 'total', 'hinderance', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'pop-culture', 'mouth', 'someone', 'should', 'have', 'popped', 'fact', 'more', 'problems', 'Would', 'really', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'ask', 'Mulan', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'mistake', 'gave', 'away', 'position', 'instead', 'having', 'Mushu', 'shoot', 'rocket', 'least', 'way', 'redeeming', 'own', 'mistake', 'instead', 'someone', 'elses', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'Better', 'yet', 'why', 'not', 'have', 'falcon', 'find', 'line', 'troops', 'what', 'falcon', 'right', 'scouted', 'earlier', 'general', 'encampment', 'brought', 'back', 'doll', 'remember', 'Oh', 'cross-dressing', 'thing', 'end', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'weird', 'bit', 'too', 'Fushigi', 'Yugi', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'intelligent', 'do', 'honestly', 'think', 'anybody', 'would', 'fall', 'trick', 'even', 'were', 'really', 'women', 'especially', 'considering', 'what', 'Monguls', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'references', 'Japanese', 'cartoons', 'anime', 'When', 'Mushu', 'feathers', 'falcon', 'Chocobo', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'series', 'just', 'as', 'likely', 'reference', 'horseclaws', 'Nausicaa', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'director', 'apparently', 'devotee', 'Miyazaki', 'Nausicaa', 'reference', 'doll', 'similar', 'one', 'Lord', 'Yupa', 'beginning', 'Nausicaa', 'movie', 'Yupa', 'village', 'died.', 'Also', 'Mulan', 'hair', 'given', 'incredible', 'attention', 'not', 'usually', 'case', 'Disney', 'films', 'usually', ""'re"", 'just', 'pretty', 'blow', 'wind', 'Just', 'watch', 'hair', 'when', 'shame', 'find', 'out', 'Beyond', 'good', 'deal', 'emotional', 'content', 'though', 'once', 'possibility', 'execution', 'lifted', 'life', 'life', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'even', 'overseer', 'who', 'really', 'hated', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'executed', 'moments', 'notice', 'once', 'caught', 'back', 'up', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'knowledge', 'art', 'Chinese', 'were', 'rather', 'steadfast', 'ways', 'honor', 'would', 'not', 'suddenly', 'become', 'so', 'accepting', 'women', 'especially', 'are', 'still', 'rather', 'unaccepting', 'women']",Mulan VHS

455120,ARNEUO7BF3J55,6305229449,E. David Swan,"[0, 3]","I've been a lifelong fan of Disney animated films but from 1995 on to 2012 I only saw a single Disney animation in the studio and unfortunately it was Mulan.  Mulan is generally considered a better than average Disney animation and it's certainly not the worst during the time period but I definitely left the theater disappointed. The story is pretty good and the animation is attractive and clean but overall it just is not a well done movie so let me list me reasons for not liking Mulan.1. Mulan. Disney is not known for its subtlety and Mulan herself is a perfect example. She joins the Chinese army trying to pass herself off as a man to replace her ailing father. That's fine but not only is she successful in her subterfuge but she excels to the level of ridiculous. By the end of the movie she's doing stunts and acrobatics more akin to what you might see from Batman.2. The cutesy sidekicks. Disney LOVES sassy sidekicks and Mulan gets not one, not two but THREE. There's a sassy horse, a sassy cricket and a sassy little dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.  The movie is only 87 minutes long and all these scenes with Mushu the dragon and Cri-kee the cricket really eat into the actual story and most are not funny.3. Mushu. The film is supposed to take place in ancient China so did they really need Eddie Murphy doing voice work sounding precisely like Eddie Murphy. Seriously?4. Shan Yu. The main Hun villain is just ridiculous. It's one thing to make him tough but again, Disney seems to know no constraints. He can survive an avalanche, is able to cleave through 3 foot thick pillars and can smash his body through the main support beam of the Emperors temple. He's less like a tough Hun and more like General Zod.5. Here is my biggest problem with the film by far. **SPOILER ALERT** Mulan manages to defeat the entire 2000 man Hun army single handedly. Let that sink in. SINGLE HANDEDLY as in with zero help. But when it is discovered that she is female, Captain Li Shang, who has throughout the movie been presented as an upstanding guy is literally ready to execute her but resists because besides taking out all the Hun's she also did an absurdly dramatic rescue to save his life. Instead she is simply banished. I don't doubt that ancient China was a very patriarchal society but this is absolutely absurd. She is only accepted in the end because she manages to save the Emperor. So because she was female she had to save China TWICE in order to gain approval. Ridiculous.6. The entire ending of the movie is silly. ** MORE SPOILER ALERT ** Mulan manages to kill all the Huns besides Shan Yu and his top five lieutenants who manage to sneak into the Imperial City. As the Emperor is preparing to reward  Li Shang for beating the Huns Shan Yu and his men snatch up The Emperor and dash into his palace lacking the doors behind them. The palace is absolutely monstrous but appears to be entirely empty. In fact the Emperor apparently has zero guards anywhere so it's up to Mulan, Li Shang and their three goofy friends one of which is voice by Harvey Fierstein to mount a quick rescue. From there on the whole thing is just a silly mess including Shan Yu inexplicably going into Super Yu mode.There is definitely stuff to like in this film and the few moments where Mulan is trying to hide her gender from her male comrades are done well. I love the skinny dipping scene. But Disney includes so much extraneous junk including scenes of Mulan's ghostly ancestors chatting and the stuff with Mushu and Cri-kee that the core story is just squeezed out.  The scenes of the Huns attacking are amazing right up until Mulan defeats them and then it just seems pointless. Mulan came between Hercules and Tarzan and although neither of those would make it into my Dinsey top ten they are a darn slight better than Mulan.",3,And Disney Thought This Would be Popular in China,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,3825,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'lifelong', 'fan', 'Disney', 'animated', 'films', '1995', '2012', 'only', 'saw', 'single', 'Disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'Mulan', 'Mulan', 'generally', 'considered', 'better', 'average', 'Disney', 'animation', 'certainly', 'not', 'worst', 'time', 'period', 'definitely', 'left', 'theater', 'disappointed', 'story', 'pretty', 'good', 'animation', 'attractive', 'clean', 'overall', 'just', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'so', 'let', 'list', 'reasons', 'not', 'liking', 'Mulan.1', 'Mulan', 'Disney', 'not', 'known', 'subtlety', 'Mulan', 'perfect', 'example', 'Chinese', 'army', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'man', 'replace', 'ailing', 'father', 'fine', 'not', 'only', 'successful', 'subterfuge', 'level', 'ridiculous', 'end', 'movie', 'doing', 'stunts', 'acrobatics', 'more', 'akin', 'what', 'might', 'see', 'Batman.2', 'cutesy', 'sidekicks', 'Disney', 'LOVES', 'sassy', 'sidekicks', 'Mulan', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'two', 'THREE', 'sassy', 'horse', 'sassy', 'cricket', 'sassy', 'little', 'dragon', 'voiced', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'movie', 'only', '87', 'minutes', 'long', 'scenes', 'Mushu', 'dragon', 'Cri-kee', 'cricket', 'really', 'eat', 'actual', 'story', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'funny.3', 'Mushu', 'film', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'ancient', 'China', 'so', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'doing', 'voice', 'work', 'sounding', 'precisely', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Seriously', '4', 'Shan', 'Yu', 'main', 'Hun', 'villain', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'one', 'thing', 'make', 'tough', 'again', 'Disney', 'know', 'constraints', 'can', 'survive', 'avalanche', 'able', 'cleave', '3', 'foot', 'thick', 'pillars', 'can', 'smash', 'body', 'main', 'support', 'beam', 'Emperors', 'temple', 'less', 'tough', 'Hun', 'more', 'General', 'Zod.5', 'Here', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'far', '**SPOILER', 'ALERT**', 'Mulan', 'defeat', 'entire', '2000', 'man', 'Hun', 'single', 'handedly', 'Let', 'sink', 'SINGLE', 'HANDEDLY', 'zero', 'help', 'when', 'discovered', 'female', 'Captain', 'Li', 'Shang', 'who', 'movie', 'been', 'presented', 'upstanding', 'guy', 'literally', 'ready', 'execute', 'because', 'taking', 'out', 'Hun', 'also', 'did', 'absurdly', 'dramatic', 'rescue', 'save', 'life', 'Instead', 'simply', 'banished', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'ancient', 'China', 'was', 'very', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'absolutely', 'absurd', 'only', 'accepted', 'end', 'save', 'Emperor', 'So', 'was', 'female', 'had', 'save', 'China', 'TWICE', 'order', 'gain', 'approval', 'Ridiculous.6', 'entire', 'ending', 'movie', 'silly', '**', 'MORE', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '**', 'Mulan', 'kill', 'Huns', 'Shan', 'Yu', 'top', 'five', 'lieutenants', 'who', 'manage', 'sneak', 'Imperial', 'City', 'Emperor', 'preparing', 'reward', 'Li', 'Shang', 'beating', 'Huns', 'Shan', 'Yu', 'men', 'snatch', 'up', 'Emperor', 'dash', 'palace', 'lacking', 'doors', 'palace', 'absolutely', 'monstrous', 'be', 'entirely', 'empty', 'fact', 'Emperor', 'apparently', 'zero', 'guards', 'anywhere', 'up', 'Mulan', 'Li', 'Shang', 'three', 'goofy', 'one', 'voice', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'mount', 'quick', 'rescue', 'there', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'silly', 'mess', 'including', 'Shan', 'Yu', 'inexplicably', 'going', 'Super', 'Yu', 'definitely', 'stuff', 'like', 'film', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'Mulan', 'trying', 'hide', 'gender', 'male', 'comrades', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'love', 'skinny', 'dipping', 'scene', 'Disney', 'so', 'much', 'extraneous', 'junk', 'including', 'scenes', 'Mulan', 'ghostly', 'ancestors', 'chatting', 'stuff', 'Mushu', 'Cri-kee', 'core', 'story', 'just', 'squeezed', 'out', 'scenes', 'Huns', 'attacking', 'are', 'amazing', 'right', 'up', 'Mulan', 'then', 'just', 'pointless', 'Mulan', 'came', 'Hercules', 'Tarzan', 'would', 'make', 'Dinsey', 'top', 'ten', 'are', 'darn', 'slight', 'better', 'Mulan']",Mulan VHS

As somebody who studies Asia, I think it's about time Disney ventured into Asia (with the exception of Jungle Book, I believe this is the first animated feature based on an Asian story). The story, in short, follows a Chinese woman who joins the army and helps stop a Hun invasion. Disney of course overplays the traditional Asian values theme (honor the ancestors, etc), but fortunately it never takes this to the point of being insulting towards Asian cultures. The story has a good balance between character and childish humor - at least for the first hour - so both adults and kids can enjoy it. I was disappointed with the second half, after the Chinese troops discover that Mulan is a woman. Rather than take that revelation and get some really interesting character development, the last half our of the film is a predictable fare of Mulan and her compatriots stopping the Huns with some wacky antics.

Now, I'm not saying that this automatically makes the film a complete failure. The animation is top-notch, with some beautiful scenery and a powerful action sequence. The drama really adds to the tension in some scenes. The music from Jerry Goldsmith is also a treat. But what really makes this a mediocre Disney film is the unnecessary comedy. Disney could have made this one of its more outstanding animated films, if it weren't for all that humor. Instead of it being a serious epic like Princess Mononoke, Mulan is more of an uneven display of drama and slapstick. All of this funny stuff is very out of place for such a powerful folk tale. Couldn't they have taken Mushu more seriously? Plus, the songs are very forgettable. ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" and ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" aren't in the same level as ""Be Our Guest"" and ""I Just Can't Wait to be King."" There are no memorable melodies and no decent lyrics, though ""Reflection"" is a slightly up there.So Mulan is basically a mixed bag. The stunning animation and the apparent drama are what's good about it. The unnecessary comedy and underwhelming songs are what's bad about it. It's too bad, really.

I ended up loving it!!  I thought it was a very good message about defying the norms of society and being yourself.  a very big step for Disney.  Eddie Murphey portrays the amusing Mushu dragon who helps Mulan on her way to join the army in honor of her grandfather, who is sick and cannot fight anymore. The songs are great...especially &quot;Reflection&quot; which has beautiful lyrics (also song brilliantly by Pop singer Christina Aguilera on the sountrack).  The animation is great, and very similar to my fav movie &quot;Pocahontas.&quot;  If you loved &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and didnt get to see &quot;Mulan&quot; in theatres, then I urge you to buy it. This in my opinion is the last great film in the wave of Disney musicals (beginning of course with a classic favorite Little Mirmaid). Now we have to put up with annoying stories of ape-boys and Aliens visiting Earth (yawn). So that said, I really reccomend &quot;Mulan.&quot;  I think she is a good role model for girls and in addition the story is great!

But her only problem is that she's too much of a tomboy to please the matchmaker, and she despairs of ever bringing honor to her family.When Mulan bravely goes into the army to fight the Huns in her aging father's place, she is protected by a bumbling-fumbling guardian dragon, Mushu...This movie has got to be the best one that Disney has ever made, aside from Toy Story 2.  There is a wonderful moral lesson in this movie, and is extremely enjoyable at any age.  The entire movie is filled with witty and funny lines, like when Mushu says to Mulan &quot;You're da man!  Well, sort of&quot; and &quot;Here's your breakfast.

Above all, &quot;Mulan&quot; is amusing, a good story, adn fast-paced.I enjoyed the music, which is rare for me. I also loved how feisty Mulan was.

And Mulan (and the more recent Wreck-it Ralph) is a reminder of how great they have been, at their best. The characteristics of great Disney animation? Starts with a superb story - just the right balance of being grounded in Chinese history, and also trying to speak to our more modern world, where women truly are trying to be treated as equals of men. Add to that exquisitely beautiful backgrounds and character work, which speaks to a long tradition of Chinese visual art, and then excellent voicing by everyone from Eddie Murphy to George Takei. And, here is the best test - if a film makes you cry, then it is really doing something, and this one does it for me a couple of times: first, when Mulan's father says &#34;the greatest honor is having you as a daughter&#34; and later, when Mulan brings honor home to the family.

It's a great presentation and it really holds up well. The music is in the strong Disney tradition, with vocal pieces developed by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel and the awesome soundtrack by the late Jerry Goldsmith. The story is well written, with characters the viewer can really feel for, particularly the main character Mulan. Finally, the film is a visual masterpiece that really draws the eye to its beauty and helps to tell the story. Possibly the film's only weak point is its villain --- Shan-Yu doesn't really have the same effect as some of the more well-developed Disney villains such as Jafar from ""Aladdin"" or Hades from ""Hercules.""I'm not any big, renowned film critic, so if I haven't sold you on the movie, perhaps I can at least give you a good run-down of the special features. Although the special features for the ""Mulan"" Special Edition DVD are not quite as numerous as those for the recent ""Aladdin"" release, they're just as good. The first disc contains songs / music videos and deleted scenes, as well as a tour of Mulan's World. The songs in this movie are very strong and the music videos are no exception. Some are better than others, but I definitely enjoyed them all. Jackie Chan's performance of ""Be a Man"" in Chinese was a great one to include. There are several deleted scenes, complete with commentary, as well as a deleted song that's fairly cool, but it's obvious wouldn't have worked with the movie. The Mulan's World feature has Mushu (Mark Moseley I would assume, since Eddie Murphy hasn't done the voice since the original feature) explaining various aspects of China. Since it's Mushu, there are plenty of jokes, of course, but I feel this actually really was quite well done as far as learning goes. Finally, the first disc includes a commentary track that gives a lot of insight into the making of the film, what things did and didn't work, and what some of the major people involved with the film liked. The second disc contains one more bonus song, ""Reflection"" in Spanish and a behind-the-scenes tour of the movie. Unlike the ""Aladdin"" behind-the-scenes featurette, this one has a bit more open feel. Each of the aspects from graphic design to music are in separate sections and you can select them to view at your leisure. You'll learn everything from how the movie was developed visually to the process of being it to other countries.This is definitely the complete package of what one would expect from a two-disc DVD set.

I'm glad I did not pay retail for the special edition, though! It has interesting facts, some creative insights, pre production art stills, and due credit given to the tiawanese crew member who contributed priceless cultural experience.I am not saying the second disk is bad, but it's not worth double the cost of the movie disk alone. I would have liked more depth about China, it's landscapes, buildings, and morals/values ... these were very briefly addressed, probably because the target audience is kids.I plan to buy the film for my collection. It's an overcomer theme that has a happy ending, like classic bedtime stories do. Not a fan of ""sophisticated"" plots and ""grey"" morality like newer stories present. I want clear cut good and evil, honorable heroes, wise leaders, and realistic emotions. Mulan has all of this. I recommend it for kids, and parents - homeschoolers in particular will find a lot to talk about afterwards.Unlike many films, it isn't stereotyped at all. It is not ""feminist"", ""patriarchal"", or any other ""ism"". Yay!Mulan makes hard choices and follows through them, despite personal risk. Such strength of character and love for others - social responsibility towards your family/troop/country - has largely disppeared from American culture. So sad! I hope quality media like this will inspire future leaders to have honor and courage as adults, to stand for their convictions, if not stand up to Huns.The negative was Mushu, the little dragon. I found him annoying more than funny, especially when he causes Mulan awkward, embarrassing situations - with no apology. Repeatedly. I don't enjoy watching others put in painful situations. He detracts from the cultural context - I think Khan should have trampled him some more! Good horse.Artistically, look at the character creation bonus feature and the stills. Rewatch the film.

While some of the comic relief is pained, Mulan herself is so lovingly rendered that she compensates for the groans.Mulan, the character, is animated by Mark Henn, one of the main animators behind the beautiful and timeless Disney heroines of the 90s.  Like Jasmine, Mulan's movements are feminine, lively, and nuanced, and show how much love he put into his work.  Her facial expressions are subtle but clear, showing both her intelligence and her girlish immaturity.  It is obvious why he was assigned to the animation of women over and over again; he is a master and considering how popular his Princesses are, I don't understand why he gets less love than Glen Keane.Equal to Henn's animation is Ming-Na's voice acting.  Her voice acting in Final Fantasy is too good; it only shows off the mediocrity of that animation.  Here, though, she brings sympathy and depth to the character.  Mulan to me is the perfect heroine.  Her goal was not true love, she would take it, yes, but her heart seeks respect and honor first.The plot is almost cloying but stops short at tender.  Songs like A Girl Worth Fighting For are forgettable at best, but both Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You, the song where Mulan climbs the pole and proves herself, are classics.  While sometimes irritating, Eddie Murphy's Mushu gets a few belly laughs.

The writers do an excellent job sticking to the story and the characters. The ""sidekick"" characters add to the story instead of distract which is a problem for a few of the recent animated films.What sets this story apart for me is that Mulan is selfless in the story and the themes of family, respect, tradition, and sacrafice take center stage. If you look at other heroes from not just animation but live action too, the main character's motivations are generaly selfish. Mulan puts her life on the line for her father and her country, not for love, or to be human, or rich or so many other selfish reasons we see so often. The morals and principles of this story are very clear and very powerful.I enjoyed every aspect of this film from start to finish and like many of the recent animated features in the past two decades this film is definately not just for children.Mulan will probably be the last great tradional cel animated feature from Disney for a long time. I know a lot of people enjoyed Tarzan and Lilo and Stitch, but Mulan is a notch above those titles. Unfortunately the traditional cel format has given way to the popular 3d animation features.

455156,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6305229449,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","I was impressed by this Disney film for so many reasons. Mulan has got to be one of the strongest Disney female characters that ever saw production, in the midst of a colorful and artistic film, that will resonate in your memory.Mulan sticks out in my mind for this reason. For once, we have a strong female lead, or at the least, stronger than most of them. She isn't counted among the Disney ""princesses"" line-up. She doesn't want for herself, and she seeks to look deeper within herself to discover her inner being. She isn't like Ariel, who wants to be someone else. She isn't like Jasmine, who sits in luxury, waiting to be swept off her feet by Prince Charming, just like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and almost any female character that Disney brings to life. And while she does share some traits among this list, she stands out because she does something that these do not. She uses her mind.Mulan, in fact, has more in common with male Disney leads than the female Disney leads. Mulan is a thinker, and a do-er. She's resourceful, like Aladdin. She is quick to act, like Eric (mermaid.) And she sacrifices herself for the sake of others, like Hercules. She also speaks her mind, even in a culture that does not allow such a thing. She doesn't waste time pining about ""will I ever find true love?"" Indeed, we see that she has an attraction to Shang (as he was her husband in the legends,) but we see her uncomfortable and unsure of meeting the Match-maker. She begs for her father's life when Chi-Fu came to the village. When you see her make her decision to take her father's place in the army, she does so out of her love for him, valuing his life above hers. She doesn't wish to become a man to see what it is like or for a change. Only to save his life. She later doubts herself and her reasons for going, but she did so because of her inner strengths, something other female Disney leads too often lack. (And it is these strengths that Shang is attracted to at the end.)This movie also has a simple, but very effective villain, Shan Yu. Though not as memorable as Jafar or Ursula, he is more effective and more menacing because he is not fantastic. By that, I mean that he is not magical, he holds no special power. The characters were well thought out and expertly drawn. Not enough songs were present for my liking, but those that were fit perfectly with the story, and the chance to hear the wonderful voice of Lea Salonga (Mulan's songs) is worth the price of this film alone.

When the Hun Army invades China, one man from every family is called to serve in the country's defense.  When her previously injured father is called to serve, Mulan seizes the opportunity for adventure and honor and takes his place.

Together they embark on a remarkable journey so save China and, perhaps, herself.  Will she succeed?  Will she be discovered by her commanding officer?  And will Mushu ever regain his position?Mulan is played by the talented and spirited Ming Nga (sp?) and Mushu by the hilarious and gifted Eddie Murphy.

Stevenson ""WIAPilot""","[79, 84]","I do not believe that I have EVER watched an animated film that taught more of the values that I would want future generations to learn from than MULAN.  I have watched this movie at LEAST 25 times and simply put - it is PROFOUND.The movie opens with Mulan getting ready to go to the ""Matchmaker.""  Although, she is a beautiful girl, she lacks the grace to make a good impression.  Devistated, she returns home. Her father tells her that ""like the cherry blossoms, her season has not come.""When China is invaded by the Huns, there is one line in the movie that is uttered by the emperor and it is SO insightful. The general in charge of the armies confidently announces that his men can handle this invasion.  However, the emperor issues a proclamation calling all available men because, ""sometimes a single grain of rice may be the deciding balance in tipping the scales.""  Or - ""one man may make a difference between conquest and defeat.""In this case, it turns out to be a woman!  I LOVE how Mulan interacts horribly with the men at first and how she is told to leave.  Mulan has to prove herself and she doesn't give up.Even after she is a hero, Mulan is disgraced when it is discovered that she is a woman.  She is shunned and yet when she must come to the rescue of China again, her comrades are loyal to her and listen to her ideas.Throughout the movie there are the different interactions of those who accept women for who they are and those who are stuck within stereotypes.Mulan is a cute and VERY funny movie with adorable songs.

In this tale, a young girl goes against tradition and takes her father's place in a great war with the Mongols by disguising herself as a young man.  The tale has been told before in various forms, but it works very well in this picture.The story gives girls a strong message of doing what you believe in or what is best, even though it may go against tradition or the majority's point of view.  In the end, Mulan not only gains the respect of her fellow soldiers, but of the entire empire of China.The action sequences are fairly intense, although there are really only two major battles.  The first is the brilliantly animated fight in the snowy mountains where the Chinese, outnumbered, take on a huge Mongol force lead by the sinister main villain whose name escapes my memory right now.  The second major conflict takes place in the emperor's palace and spills into the streets of the city.The characters in this film are all given proper introductions, though the main bad guy doesn't have many chances to develop.  All we really know is that he wants to take over the Chinese empire.  Ming-Na Wen provides the speaking voice for Mulan.  The rest of the character voices include B.D. Wong, Pat Morita and a hilarious Harvey Fierstein.  Of course, everyone focuses on the comic relief of Mushu(Eddie Murphy).  Murphy does a splendid job with the character, though I think he could have been given a little more room to expand on the character.  In all honesty, Mushu is almost as funny as Murphy's ""Donkey"" from the ""Shrek"" films.The songs in this film are pretty good.  ""Reflection"" is a rather good song that is performed by Mulan(singing voice provided by Lea Salonga).  The song is very inspiring.  My favorite song has to be ""Be A Man,"" however.  It just sounds great and reminds me of Elvis' ""GI Blues.""  You'd think the military would be an odd setting for musical numbers, but it works in both of these films.  Another excellent song is ""True To Your Heart,"" performed by Stevie Wonder and boy band 98 Degrees.  It's a very peppy, feel-good song that finishes off the film in great fashion.The DVD includes a number of special features.  From games to the obligatory ""Making Of"" featurette, it's all here.

""Kimberly""","[2, 2]","This movie is probably the last really good animated feature ever made- although not holding up to the classics such as Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King or the Pixar collaberations. But, this movie holds up the classic Disney tradition of good storytelling, animation, and moving music.Probably one of the last classicly animated movies. Mulan takes place in China just after the Huns invaded. With the Huns invasion the emperor of China asks one man for each family to serve in the army. Mulan a troubled girl who is trying to find her place in the world while, dealing with the fact that she dosn't fit in. Mulan continually humilates her family who she loves greatly. She feels as though she is a dissappointment-unable to find a husband. Well, when her father is asked to serve in the army Mulan can't stand the thought that she might lose him. She decides to disguise herself as a man and serve for him. When Mulan is discovered missing her dead family ancestors ask the help of Mushu-a wise cracking dragon to guard her. Mulan quickly finds herself having trouble in the army and in constant conflict with the guys. But, eventually becomes acceptted especially by Chang the head of the army. When, Mulan is injured her secret is revealed. Chang spares her life... but, when Mulan sees the Huns heading in the same direction of the army- it's up to her to warn the guys and save China from diaster. Only problem will anyone believe her now???With such memorable songs as ""Reflection"", ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You"", and ""True To Your Heart."" You'll find yourself singing along with the songs. I love the song ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You""- Donny Osmond has the most amazing voice. Les Miserables fans will be pleased that Lea Solgna sings the film version of ""Reflection."" I LOVE the bonus features such as the music videos especially the one with Jackie Chan(He was the Chinese voice for Chang) singing in Chinese ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You."" The quality on the DVD is better than the version I saw in theaters.I love this film and continually watch it over and over again. I especially like Chang in this film. I'll give it 4 stars-it's great but, it's not gonna be a classic such as Beauty & the Beast or the Lion KIng- I think the girls will like this film but, the little guys might not be into this as much.

Feeling that she will never be a credit to her family, Mulan gets her chance when an envoy arrives from the Emperor, China is being attacked by the Huns, and one man from every family must go to serve in the army.  Mulan doesn't want her frail father to have to go, so she steals his sword and armour and gallops off on her horse Khan in his place.The spirits of her ancestors send a somewhat undersized dragon (the voice of Eddie Murphy)to guard her. She bluffs her way into the army, struggles through the training process, and eventually succeeds in becoming a real soldier, winning the respect of her comrades and doing her bit to save the Empire.This is a wonderful film, with gorgeous animation, a thrilling plot,lots of humour, great characters and a superb score.  Mulan herself is an attractive and heartwarming heroine who keeps your interest and sympathy throughout.You feel like cheering when she manages to climb to the top of the pole and throw down the arrow, and there is a breathtakingly exciting scene where the Huns come sweeping down the snow-covered hill and she defeats them with a brilliant piece of strategy  The supporting characters are good too, Mulan's parents (unusually for a Disney film, she has a father as well as a mother)are very sympathetically portrayed, and she also has a feisty grandmother who has one of the best lines in the film, when she sets eyes on gorgeous Captain Shang and says ""Sign me up for the next war!""

455183,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6305229449,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 2]","Though Walt Disney Pictures has made many animated features, the vast majority are based on stories common in western cultures.  ""Mulan"" breaks new ground as an animated feature from a Chinese fable.  Mulan is a young girl who has taken her father's place in the military to fight invaders.  As with many countries, women were expected to remain at home and allow men to handle the fighting.  As this movie makes very clear, death was an expected punishment for a female impersonating a male warrior.  However, Mulan overcomes stereotypes and helps defend her country, and charms us along the way.This movie has an incredible cast.  Miguel Ferrer voices Shan-Yu, the leader of the invading Huns.  Miguel adds a sinister edge to his deep voice that enhances our dislike for the ruthless character of Shan-Yu.  Beautiful Ming-Na provides the voice of Mulan.  Ming-Na won an Annie Award for her voice portrayal of Mulan.  Eddie Murphy is perfect and funny as the dragon Mushu whose heart is bigger than his body or his brains.  The late Pat Morita is excellent as the voice of the Emperor of China.  Numerous other voice talents bring this movie to life.  Korean actor Oh Soon Tek voice Fa Zhou.  Veteran actor Miriam Margolyes voices the Matchmaker.  Matthew Laborteaux, Gedde Watanabe, James Hong, and numerous other stars make their appearances in this film.As with many Disney films, this movie includes several excellent songs.  Singing those songs are well known artists Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder, 98 Degrees, Donny Osmond and Lea Salonga.This movie captured more than the hearts and minds of viewers.  This movie also captured 14 awards and 13 award nominations, including a nomination for an Oscar.  This movie also has one of the highest box office totals of all time, ranking in the top 200 as of the date of this review.Walt Disney Pictures has had some mis-steps in movie productions as it seeks to regain the prominence in family films that it once had.  This movie placed Disney Pictures back in the spotlight as one of the premiere studios for making family films.  I believe that most families will enjoy this tale based on a Chinese fable.  Along the way perhaps members of the family will learn something about heroism and selflessness, and that girls and women have far greater capability than many, including themselves, give them credit.  This DVD is a necessity for any family's home film library.

455188,A3E832FY3AIKFT,6305229449,"Mark Clegg ""Nathan's Dad""","[5, 6]","Mulan was Disney's last animated grasp at a musical. Following this movie we have yet to have another Disney theatrical animated feature that features the characters singing songs Broadway-style. Strange considering that Disney were making animated musicals during the years when bursting into song in a film was not considered fashionable and, not long after Mulan was made, the musical came back into cinematic vogue. Still it seems that Disney pride them selves on being out of step with everyone else - even to their detriment. The songs in Mulan are wonderfully fitting and, although the score has nothing to seriously rival Be Our Guest or Circle of Life, numbers like Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You deserve a place in Disney's musical Hall of Fame.Mulan is not one of Disney's mordern greatest hits along the lines of The Lion King, The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Instead it sits with the likes of Hercules and Hunchback as one of those films that is great but didn't receive much publicity and box-office in comparison. Hopefully this extras-heavy package will rectify this somewhat and help it attain more than being a 'Disney Princess' movie (not being a six year old girl, I find the whole notion of the 'Disney Princess' drive rather cheapening to the characters involved - still it's good marketing).The package seems similar to the treatment that Alice in Wonderland got earlier this year (and that Disney keeps threatening to do with Lilo and Stitch, Pocahontas and Mary Poppins - but still no sign of them) with more scope due to the film's comparitive youth. The never-before-heard song will be interesting although it is doubtful it will appear fully animated and part of the finished film a la Human Again and Morning Report. More likely it will appear accompanied by stills like I'm Odd on the Alice DVD. Mushu the Dragon pops up on some extras but, since he hasn't been involved in the character since the original film, it is doubtful whether Eddie Murphy will be providing vocals. The audio commentary should be extremely interesting (they always are) as should the information supplied on China and it's customs (although they are sure to be child-friendly since they're hosted by an animated dragon!). For the adults and buffs there seems to be plenty of behind-the-scenes stuff although on some Disney DVD releases these are frustratingly short and undetailed - fingers crossed for this one. Digital Dim Sum also sounds very interesting.Since this is a double discer I'm sure we can expect the extra's quality to be similar to that of the Alice release although the heights of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and the upcoming Aladdin (which this seems to be an appetiser for) would be prefered. Just as long as we aren't fobbed off with one similar to the very disappointing Pinnochio 'Special Edition' released last year.",4,Bringing Honour to us all,1090713600,"07 25, 2004",2004,2888,"['Mulan', 'was', 'Disney', 'last', 'animated', 'grasp', 'musical', 'Following', 'movie', 'have', 'yet', 'have', 'Disney', 'theatrical', 'animated', 'feature', 'characters', 'singing', 'songs', 'Broadway-style', 'Strange', 'considering', 'Disney', 'were', 'making', 'animated', 'musicals', 'years', 'when', 'bursting', 'song', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'considered', 'fashionable', 'not', 'long', 'Mulan', 'was', 'made', 'musical', 'came', 'back', 'cinematic', 'vogue', 'Still', 'Disney', 'pride', 'selves', 'being', 'step', 'everyone', 'else', 'even', 'detriment', 'songs', 'Mulan', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'fitting', 'score', 'nothing', 'seriously', 'rival', 'Be', 'Guest', 'Circle', 'Life', 'numbers', 'Reflection', ""'ll"", 'Make', 'Man', 'Out', 'deserve', 'place', 'Disney', 'musical', 'Hall', 'Fame.Mulan', 'not', 'one', 'Disney', 'mordern', 'greatest', 'hits', 'lines', 'Lion', 'King', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Instead', 'likes', 'Hercules', 'Hunchback', 'one', 'films', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'much', 'publicity', 'box-office', 'comparison', 'Hopefully', 'extras-heavy', 'package', 'will', 'rectify', 'somewhat', 'help', 'attain', 'more', 'being', ""'Disney"", 'Princess', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'find', 'whole', 'notion', ""'Disney"", 'Princess', 'drive', 'rather', 'cheapening', 'characters', 'involved', 'still', 'good', 'marketing', '.The', 'package', 'similar', 'treatment', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'got', 'earlier', 'year', 'Disney', 'threatening', 'do', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'Pocahontas', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'still', 'sign', 'more', 'scope', 'due', 'film', 'comparitive', 'youth', 'never-before-heard', 'song', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'doubtful', 'will', 'appear', 'fully', 'animated', 'part', 'finished', 'film', 'la', 'Human', 'Again', 'Morning', 'Report', 'More', 'likely', 'will', 'appear', 'accompanied', 'stills', ""'m"", 'Odd', 'Alice', 'DVD', 'Mushu', 'Dragon', 'up', 'extras', ""n't"", 'been', 'involved', 'character', 'original', 'film', 'doubtful', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'will', 'be', 'providing', 'vocals', 'audio', 'commentary', 'should', 'be', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'always', 'are', 'should', 'information', 'supplied', 'China', 'customs', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'child-friendly', ""'re"", 'hosted', 'animated', 'dragon', 'adults', 'buffs', 'there', 'be', 'plenty', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'Disney', 'DVD', 'are', 'frustratingly', 'short', 'undetailed', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'one', 'Digital', 'Dim', 'Sum', 'also', 'very', 'interesting.Since', 'double', 'discer', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'expect', 'extra', 'quality', 'be', 'similar', 'Alice', 'release', 'heights', 'Lion', 'King', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Snow', 'White', 'upcoming', 'Aladdin', 'be', 'appetiser', 'would', 'be', 'prefered', 'Just', 'as', 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'fobbed', 'off', 'one', 'similar', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Pinnochio', 'Edition', 'released', 'last', 'year']",Mulan VHS

455190,A11A8GWG0IXBZH,6305229449,"Mark Hills ""Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!""","[0, 0]","Disney's Mulan tells the story of Fa Mulan (Ming Na Wen from the live action Street Fighter), a young Chinese woman who cannot bear the thought of her lame father going off to fight Huns, and so she impersonates Fa Zu's  non-existent son, Ping. The film opens with a breathtaking view of China's  Great Wall, built especially to keep the Huns at bay, but the builders  never foresaw  the development of the grappling hook. It is here me meet  Shan Yu, the Hun leader, and like a lot of Disney villains, he is  frighteningly competent and evil. And when he faces down a frightened  Imperial soldier who has managed to light a signal fire that alerts  positions up and down the wall then defiantly states, ""...now all of China  knows you are coming!""  Shan Yu is delighted!As the Huns approach,  Mulan is being paraded before the matchmaker-the woman who will find a  husband for her. Mulan's eagerness to succeed turns to disaster and she  humiliates her father, then again when the Imperial Army arrives looking  for conscripts, she demands that her father has already served. Her father  proudly exclaims that he will serve much to Mulan's grief-the scene is one  of the most memorable in the film. That night she sneaks out of her room  and dawns her Fa Zu's armor before cutting her hair. Stealing away into the  night, she exchanges the conscript notice with her hair comb then rides off  to join the Imperial Army.Mulan as Ping begins to suffer, mostly  because of the advice of Mushu (Eddie Murphy) -a little red dragon and  former temple guardian of the family shrine. She desperately tries to fit  in with the burly bunch of recruits and ""be a man"" under the watchful eye  of Captain Li Shang-who believes that `Ping' is ""unsuited for the rage of  war."", which forces Mulan to try even harder and in the process convinces  her fellow recruits to succeed until they complete basic training.Two of the more memorable scenes include the discovery of the devastated  village and the body of Li Shang's father-a memorable moment on a knoll  where Captain Shang mounts his father's helmet atop his sword. The second  is the spectacular battle sequence on a snowy mountain top. The CGI  sequence of thousands of Huns storming over the rise on horse back has the  same awesome feel as the stampeding wildebeests in Lion King.Mulan  scores big with us older folks and must admit my own ignorance in this,  because I have never read the original story and so do not know what Disney  has changed it. The songs, most notably ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and  ""True to Your Heart"" are upbeat and fun. The animation is excellent while  the character art takes a little getting used to, similarly as the art in  Hercules. The signature CGI are pieces are subtle and as the technology  improves are meshed even more seamlessly with the traditional animation  methods. The voice acting is up to the usual Disney standards and I only  wish that those companies producing English translations for Japanese anime  would take a cue from Disney and hire real actors to do character voices.  Of course, that doesn't mean I forgive Disney for getting Phil Hartman to  do the voice of Jiji the cat in Kiki's Delivery Service.",4,One of Disney's Best,957398400,"05 4, 2000",2000,3209,"['Disney', 'Mulan', 'story', 'Fa', 'Mulan', 'Ming', 'Na', 'Wen', 'live', 'action', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'young', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'thought', 'lame', 'father', 'going', 'off', 'fight', 'Huns', 'so', 'Fa', 'Zu', 'non-existent', 'son', 'Ping', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'view', 'China', 'Great', 'Wall', 'built', 'especially', 'keep', 'Huns', 'bay', 'builders', 'never', 'foresaw', 'development', 'grappling', 'hook', 'here', 'meet', 'Shan', 'Yu', 'Hun', 'leader', 'lot', 'Disney', 'villains', 'frighteningly', 'competent', 'evil', 'when', 'down', 'frightened', 'Imperial', 'soldier', 'who', 'managed', 'light', 'signal', 'fire', 'positions', 'wall', 'then', 'defiantly', 'now', 'China', 'knows', 'are', 'coming', 'Shan', 'Yu', 'delighted', 'Huns', 'approach', 'Mulan', 'being', 'paraded', 'matchmaker-the', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'find', 'husband', 'Mulan', 'eagerness', 'succeed', 'turns', 'disaster', 'father', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'looking', 'conscripts', 'father', 'already', 'served', 'father', 'proudly', 'will', 'serve', 'much', 'Mulan', 'grief-the', 'scene', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'night', 'room', 'Fa', 'Zu', 'armor', 'cutting', 'hair', 'Stealing', 'away', 'night', 'exchanges', 'conscript', 'notice', 'hair', 'comb', 'then', 'join', 'Imperial', 'Army.Mulan', 'Ping', 'begins', 'suffer', 'mostly', 'advice', 'Mushu', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', '-a', 'little', 'red', 'dragon', 'former', 'temple', 'guardian', 'family', 'shrine', 'desperately', 'fit', 'burly', 'bunch', 'recruits', 'be', 'man', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Captain', 'Li', 'Shang-who', 'Ping', 'unsuited', 'rage', 'war', 'Mulan', 'try', 'even', 'harder', 'process', 'fellow', 'recruits', 'succeed', 'complete', 'basic', 'training.Two', 'more', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'include', 'discovery', 'devastated', 'village', 'body', 'Li', 'Shang', 'father-a', 'memorable', 'moment', 'knoll', 'where', 'Captain', 'Shang', 'father', 'helmet', 'sword', 'second', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'sequence', 'snowy', 'mountain', 'top', 'CGI', 'sequence', 'thousands', 'Huns', 'storming', 'rise', 'horse', 'back', 'same', 'awesome', 'feel', 'stampeding', 'wildebeests', 'Lion', 'King.Mulan', 'big', 'older', 'folks', 'must', 'admit', 'own', 'ignorance', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'original', 'story', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'Disney', 'changed', 'songs', 'most', 'notably', ""'ll"", 'Make', 'Man', 'True', 'Your', 'Heart', 'are', 'upbeat', 'fun', 'animation', 'excellent', 'character', 'art', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'similarly', 'art', 'Hercules', 'signature', 'CGI', 'are', 'pieces', 'are', 'subtle', 'technology', 'improves', 'are', 'meshed', 'even', 'more', 'seamlessly', 'traditional', 'animation', 'methods', 'voice', 'acting', 'usual', 'Disney', 'standards', 'only', 'wish', 'companies', 'producing', 'English', 'translations', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'would', 'take', 'cue', 'Disney', 'hire', 'real', 'actors', 'do', 'character', 'voices', 'course', ""n't"", 'mean', 'forgive', 'Disney', 'getting', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'do', 'voice', 'Jiji', 'cat', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service']",Mulan VHS

It's about time!!!Next: I have to emphatically disagree with reviewer Bill Mydo below. -You will excuse me if I spend some little time defending this film against his critique; Mulan happens to be my favorite Disney animated movie, second only perhaps to Beauty and the Beast. Perhaps my being Chinese-American may have something to do with it, as does the fact that I strongly identify with the character's self-doubts. Still, I am fairly particular as to what I consider ""good art""; and it boggles and confounds me that anyone would fail to see the difference between this movie and, for example, Hunchback or Hercules.Yes, Disney's Mulan is very much a western/ American movie, made for western and American- not Asian- audiences. No, they ""didn't get it right""; or, not exactly. But I never expected them to, and I give them a good deal of credit for trying. They came quite a bit closer that I ever thought that they would. Nor do I find this movie overly feminist (no more than Snow White or Cinderella are ""chauvinist""). Mulan may be a strong female character, but she is not Aladdin's Princess Jasmine. Mulan is not defined by rebellion, nor by what she rejects. Instead she upholds her sense of honor as she struggles to find out who she is and where she fits in. Moreover, in a genre known for its blatant ad nauseum boy-meets-girl love themes, I truly appreciated the downplayed understatedness of the ""interest"" between Mulan and Captain Shang.As to the ""commercial"" aspect of the film; yes, it had its tie-ins and its merchandising. What Disney movie doesn't? But the real issue is the worth of the film itself, and on this I take exception to the review below. I believe there is more in it than Mr. Mydo gives credit for.The film does have its awkward moments. The scene with the match-maker and Mulan's first entrance into the army camp are both extremely painful to watch- I do not enjoy watching anyone be utterly humiliated- not even a cartoon character (and I do not believe that someone as bright as Mulan would fumble so badly over simply coming up with a new name). I also find it somewhat irksome that one minor character, Mushu the dragon, continually steals attention away from the movie's proper focus. And there are a number of jokes and visual gags that closely border on PG. I found this in somewhat poor taste in a kid's movie.But these faults are counterbalanced, and more than compensated for, by the scenes that really work. The opening ""brush painting"" of the Great Wall; Mulan's song (Reflections) and the ensuing scene of loving encouragement from her father; the scene where she decides to leave home; her heart-to-heart talk with Mushu at the abandoned camp in the mountains; the Imperial Palace where she is honored by the Emperor before all China... the sheer artistry of these scenes is breathtaking.When the Special Edition DVD is released, I intend to be first in line!",5,Well Worth Watching,1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,3054,"['First', 'kudos', 'Disney', '*finally*', 'including', 'MANDARIN', 'LANGUAGE', 'AUDIO', 'TRACK', 'original', 'DVD', 'had', 'French', 'Spanish-', 'Chinese', 'time', 'Next', 'have', 'emphatically', 'disagree', 'reviewer', 'Bill', 'Mydo', '-You', 'will', 'excuse', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'defending', 'film', 'critique', 'Mulan', 'be', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movie', 'second', 'only', 'perhaps', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Perhaps', 'being', 'Chinese-American', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'strongly', 'identify', 'character', 'self-doubts', 'Still', 'am', 'fairly', 'particular', 'what', 'consider', 'good', 'art', 'anyone', 'would', 'fail', 'see', 'difference', 'movie', 'example', 'Hunchback', 'Hercules.Yes', 'Disney', 'Mulan', 'very', 'much', 'western/', 'American', 'movie', 'made', 'western', 'American-', 'not', 'Asian-', 'audiences', 'No', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'not', 'exactly', 'never', 'expected', 'give', 'good', 'deal', 'credit', 'trying', 'came', 'quite', 'bit', 'closer', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'do', 'find', 'movie', 'overly', 'feminist', 'more', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'are', 'chauvinist', 'Mulan', 'may', 'be', 'strong', 'female', 'character', 'not', 'Aladdin', 'Princess', 'Jasmine', 'Mulan', 'not', 'defined', 'rebellion', 'what', 'Instead', 'sense', 'honor', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'where', 'Moreover', 'genre', 'known', 'blatant', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'boy-meets-girl', 'love', 'themes', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'downplayed', 'understatedness', 'interest', 'Mulan', 'Captain', 'Shang.As', 'commercial', 'aspect', 'film', 'yes', 'had', 'tie-ins', 'merchandising', 'What', 'Disney', 'movie', ""n't"", 'real', 'issue', 'worth', 'film', 'take', 'exception', 'review', 'believe', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Mydo', 'credit', 'for.The', 'film', 'have', 'awkward', 'moments', 'scene', 'match-maker', 'Mulan', 'first', 'entrance', 'army', 'camp', 'are', 'extremely', 'painful', 'watch-', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'anyone', 'be', 'utterly', 'humiliated-', 'not', 'even', 'cartoon', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'someone', 'as', 'bright', 'Mulan', 'would', 'fumble', 'so', 'badly', 'simply', 'coming', 'up', 'new', 'name', 'also', 'find', 'somewhat', 'one', 'minor', 'character', 'Mushu', 'dragon', 'continually', 'steals', 'attention', 'away', 'movie', 'proper', 'focus', 'are', 'number', 'jokes', 'visual', 'gags', 'closely', 'border', 'PG', 'found', 'somewhat', 'poor', 'taste', 'kid', 'movie.But', 'faults', 'are', 'counterbalanced', 'more', 'compensated', 'scenes', 'really', 'work', 'opening', 'brush', 'painting', 'Great', 'Wall', 'Mulan', 'song', 'Reflections', 'ensuing', 'scene', 'loving', 'encouragement', 'father', 'scene', 'where', 'leave', 'home', 'heart-to-heart', 'talk', 'Mushu', 'abandoned', 'camp', 'mountains', 'Imperial', 'Palace', 'where', 'honored', 'Emperor', 'China', 'sheer', 'artistry', 'scenes', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'released', 'intend', 'be', 'first', 'line']",Mulan VHS

Quebec,"[13, 17]","I'm an Asian-American adult male of Filipino-Chinese descent & I actually liked this movie!First, it has a positive message for young girls.  Mulan is a strong-willed (but not arrogant or overly aggressive), intelligent young woman who defies unjust ""traditions"" in order to save her country from invading hordes of ""Huns"" (Tartars/Mongols?) while at the same time, being compassionate & caring.  Her strength comes from her basic (& sometimes flawed) humanity, not from aggression (or trying to be ""perfect"") & that's what I liked about the character.  (For those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, in the story, her elderly father is ""drafted"" into the Chinese army & in order to save him from conscription, she masquerades as a man to serve in her father's place.)As far as Chinese history & culture is concerned, Disney gets the basic look of pre-Ching Dynasty China right.  (It's kind of hard to tell which Dynasty they're portraying, but it definately is before the Manchu conquest, since all of the men are sporting ""top-knots"", not pig-tails.)  The Chinese martial-arts (wushu or kung-fu not Japanese ""karate"") is also depicted accurately.  I also like the showing of the bamboo cannons, which the medieval Chinese armies did use.  (That's right.  Martial-arts movie fans often get the mistaken idea that the Chinese only used kung-fu & didn't use guns.  The fact is, the Chinese developed gunpowder & created the first guns ever!)Some Asian-americans have complained about the ""inaccuracies"" prevalent in Mulan.  To be sure, there are some modern references in Eddie Murphy's monologues, but remember, this is an animated comedy!  Also, if you were to watch any of the old Shaw Brothers kung-fu films depicting the same time periods, they are rife with historical inaccuracies!  (Nobody complains about those movies, because those films are made by Asians!)  And at least, Mulan makes an attempt at getting it reasonably ""right"" (much more than the old ""Kung-Fu"" tv series, which is way off!)  Mulan does depict Asians with dignity & nobility (while also showing real human flaws.)  It does not favor negative stereo-types & any negative press from the Asian-American community is un-deserved!  (Lighten up, guys!  It's a cartoon!)Lastly, the singing.  My own personal bias made me cringe at the songs!  (Sorry.  I'm not saying they're bad, it's just my own personal taste, that's all!)  In my opinion (and I know a lot of people won't agree with me), I think this animated movie would have been much better without the singing!  (But, as a marketing ploy, the singing & sales of the soundtrack make sense & I'm sure little kids liked the songs.)I definately recommend this movie.  I hope one day, this movie would be remade as a live action drama.  (Maybe with Zhang Zi-Yi from Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon in the title role?  If not, how about Lea Salonga, who sings in this movie, in the title role.  She'll need some kung-fu/wushu training first, but I think she'd be great!)Buy it!",4,"Not Bad, For A Kiddie Film",1012262400,"01 29, 2002",2002,3000,"[""'m"", 'Asian-American', 'adult', 'male', 'Filipino-Chinese', 'descent', 'actually', 'liked', 'movie', 'First', 'positive', 'message', 'young', 'girls', 'Mulan', 'strong-willed', 'not', 'arrogant', 'overly', 'aggressive', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'unjust', 'traditions', 'order', 'save', 'country', 'invading', 'hordes', 'Huns', 'Tartars/Mongols', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'compassionate', 'caring', 'strength', 'basic', 'sometimes', 'flawed', 'humanity', 'not', 'aggression', 'trying', 'be', 'perfect', 'what', 'liked', 'character', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'story', 'elderly', 'father', 'drafted', 'Chinese', 'army', 'order', 'save', 'conscription', 'man', 'serve', 'father', 'place', 'As', 'far', 'Chinese', 'history', 'culture', 'concerned', 'Disney', 'basic', 'look', 'pre-Ching', 'Dynasty', 'China', 'right', 'kind', 'hard', 'tell', 'Dynasty', ""'re"", 'portraying', 'definately', 'Manchu', 'conquest', 'men', 'are', 'sporting', 'top-knots', 'not', 'pig-tails', 'Chinese', 'martial-arts', 'wushu', 'kung-fu', 'not', 'Japanese', 'karate', 'also', 'depicted', 'accurately', 'also', 'showing', 'bamboo', 'cannons', 'medieval', 'Chinese', 'armies', 'did', 'use', 'right', 'Martial-arts', 'movie', 'fans', 'often', 'get', 'mistaken', 'idea', 'Chinese', 'only', 'used', 'kung-fu', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'guns', 'fact', 'Chinese', 'developed', 'gunpowder', 'created', 'first', 'guns', 'ever', 'Asian-americans', 'have', 'complained', 'inaccuracies', 'prevalent', 'Mulan', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'modern', 'references', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'monologues', 'remember', 'animated', 'comedy', 'Also', 'were', 'watch', 'old', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'kung-fu', 'films', 'depicting', 'same', 'time', 'periods', 'are', 'rife', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'Nobody', 'movies', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'Asians', 'least', 'Mulan', 'attempt', 'getting', 'reasonably', 'right', 'much', 'more', 'old', 'Kung-Fu', 'tv', 'series', 'way', 'Mulan', 'depict', 'Asians', 'dignity', 'nobility', 'also', 'showing', 'real', 'human', 'flaws', 'not', 'favor', 'negative', 'stereo-types', 'negative', 'press', 'Asian-American', 'community', 'un-deserved', 'Lighten', 'up', 'guys', 'cartoon', 'Lastly', 'singing', 'own', 'personal', 'bias', 'made', 'cringe', 'songs', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'re"", 'bad', 'just', 'own', 'personal', 'taste', 'opinion', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'agree', 'think', 'animated', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'singing', 'marketing', 'ploy', 'singing', 'sales', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'sense', ""'m"", 'sure', 'little', 'kids', 'liked', 'songs', 'definately', 'recommend', 'movie', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'remade', 'live', 'action', 'drama', 'Maybe', 'Zhang', 'Zi-Yi', 'Crouching', 'Tiger/Hidden', 'Dragon', 'title', 'role', 'not', 'how', 'Lea', 'Salonga', 'who', 'movie', 'title', 'role', ""'ll"", 'need', 'kung-fu/wushu', 'training', 'first', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'great', 'Buy']",Mulan VHS

The movie tells the story of Fa Mulan who is the young daughter of the great warrior Fa Zhou. Mulan thinks of herself as a disappointment to her family, but her father does not let on and cares a great deal for her. In the opening scene the Huns have just stormed the Great Wall of China and the Emperor of China has conscription notices sent out to each household informing them that one male from each household must join the army. Fa Zhou, who is in poor health, accepts the conscription on behalf of his household. Mulan knows that her father is unfit to join the army steal his sword and suit of armor and takes the family horse and rides away in the night to join the army. When the family finds out about this Grandmother Fa asks the Ancestors to watch after her. This wakes up the First Ancestor Fa who awakens Mushu to summon the rest of the Ancestors. First Ancestor Fa sends Musho to awaken the Great Stone Dragon, but in doing so Mushu accidently destroys the Great Stone Dragon. Mushu pretends that he is the Great Stone Dragon and sets out, along with Cri-kee, to help Mulan. Mulan disguise herself and a man (calling herself Ping) and tries her best to fit in but does not. It is not until she has proven herself that the camp finally accepts her.Mushu gives Chi-Fu phony orders to send the men on their first assignment. The men break camp and head up to meet General Li's army, but they arrive too late. The village is destroyed and all of the soldiers are killed. Captain Li Shang, General Li son, and his men all are that remain left to prevent the Hun invasion. It is Mushu that accidently sets off one of the rockets and alerts the Hun army. At battle breaks out and Ping uses the last rocket to start an avalanche that wipe outs nearly all of the Hun army. Ping is wounded in the battle and when the doctor mends her wounds it is revealed that Ping is a woman. Since Ping\Mulan saved Captain Li Shang life, Captain Li Shang spears her life and kicks her out of the army. Later that evening Mulan discovers not all the Huns were killed and several of the survived including the leader of the Huns Shan Yu.Back at the Imperial City Captain Li Shang and his men are welcome as heroes of China. Mulan tries to warn Captain Li Shang that Shan Yu and some of his men are still alive and are heading towards the Imperial City, but Captain Li Shang will not listen. Mulan, Mushu, and Cri-kee take matters into their own hands once the Emperor of China has been taken hostage. Mulan, Yao, Ling, Chien-Po, and Shang manage to sneak in the palace, distract and take out the guards, and rescue the Emperor of China. Shang and Mulan battle Shan Yu and Shan Yu meets his death when he is carry off by a rocket and into a munitions tower where there are other rockets. Mulan is a hero to all of China and heads home to her father. Mulan won several Annie Awards and grossed $304 million worldwide. The special effects in Mulan are great and Mulan gets an AAA+++.DVD FEATURESChapter SelectionsSet UpA) Spoken LanguagesB) CaptionsC) Version Widescreen or StandardD) Return To FilmE) Main MenuBonus MaterialA) Theatrical TrailerB) Reflection Music VideoC) True To Your Heart Music VideoD) Film Recommendationsa.

It's about battles against the will and the courage of a young woman who won't give up. It's Mulan, a movie that combining very elements -humor, love and hate-, creates an intelligent story that no one should miss.Based on a Chinese legend, Mulan is the tale of a young girl that doesn't fit in the rigid structures imposed for her traditional culture, as to how it should be the women's' rol in society An independent spirit sentenced to ""never bring honor to her family"" for adopting her own way of thinking and acting.In the time of Chinese feudalism, the Emperor, who has to confront an attack of Huns, commanded for the evil Shan Yu, orders to recruit a man for every family to take a place n the future war. Mulan's father, the only man in her family and very tied to traditions, accepts his duty without a doubt.And like her father, without too much thinking, Mulan decides to takes his place, turning herself into a man. She cuts her hair, steals her dad's war weapons and gets enlisted in the military calling herself ""Ping"". On the road she meets 2 cartoonish-y friends, a funny dragon called Mushu and a cricket called, Crikee (convenient). Both give the usual touch of comedy in this kind of movie.In military life, Mulan shows a defying and rigorous training, under the critic eye of her boss, Captain Shang. And she proves both intelligence and courage in the battlefield. Her search to defend her family name and to get approval of her way of thinking is told with great style.The animation is very nice, from scenes as impressive as the battle in the snow to the parade before the Imperial palace. Unusual camera angles are implemented, colors and textures are used with great delicacy, enriching the cinematography; the score is light and fresh.In Mulan, once again Disney tries to explore emotions and feelings like family love, duty, courage, honor, obedience, boldness, willpower and team work.

455208,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6305229449,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Based on a beloved Chinese legend, Mulan is a lovely, spirited, intelligent, outspoken, but less than graceful young girl growing up in ancient China. She has come of age, and it is time to be married off to a young man, but the village matchmaker does not believe it is possible. Speaking openly, even to men, and having poor serving skills, Mulan is simply not a proper young Chinese woman and will never bring her family honor. Her despair over dishonoring her family and her desire to freely embrace her true self must be cast aside, however, when the Emperor calls out for one male member of each Chinese family to join the army and help defend the land from the invading Huns. With her father too weak to last long in military service, Mulan is the only member of her family who is able to fight, but a woman joining the army is forbidden, and the penalty of deception is death! After she makes the dangerous decision to disguise herself as a man and fight in her father's place, Mulan's ancestors send a mighty dragon to bring her back before she causes her family further shame and embarrassment. But Mushu (Eddie Murphy), a much more miniscule dragon, takes his place and decides to help Mulan in her quest instead of bringing her home. In her guise as a male soldier, Mulan barely manages to keep her secret while training, marching, and fighting, but by the time her struggle is over, Mulan and those around her learn that she doesn't have to be a perfect bride or beauty to bring her family of honor.There's a lot of animosity towards the Disney animated features that have been released since ""The Lion King."" Many have said that ""The Lion King"" was the last great film of the Disney Renaissance that supposedly started with ""The Little Mermaid."" Not at all true. ""Mulan"" is a prime example. The story is powerful, emotional, and more real than anything Disney feature animation has tackled before, except maybe ""Pocahontas."" The film envelopes you in ancient Chinese culture, the music is fantastic, and the characters are believable, endearing, and beautifully played by their respective voice talents. Eddie Murphy, of course, is the big name tagged to this feature, playing a role that he seemed to be reprising in Shrek (but he's much funnier here). Much of the rest of the cast list reads like a Who's Who of Asian-American actors, from Pat Morita to James Hong, with the beautiful Ming-Na Wen as Mulan herself. And, while there IS a clear villain, the ferociously looming and eventually realized threat of Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns, the real conflict in this film is Mulan's struggle to discover herself and to prove her worth to her family, her people, and to herself.This 2-disc Special Edition does a nice job stepping things up from the previous Gold Collection release. Presented in anamorphic widescreen, Disc One features an informative audio commentary with directors and producer that gives you insight into the depths to which the filmmakers went to make ""Mulan"" culturally accurate. It also holds a Disneypedia Activity, a ""Fun Facts"" clip, and a nice collection of deleted scenes that include a cut song for Mushu. Disc One also has a collection of preview trailers for upcoming Disney releases, naturally, and a special ""Mulan 2"" sneak peak. There's also a ""Music and More"" section that provides us with 4 music videos. As expected, you get the 2 music videos from the previous release of Mulan: ""Reflection,"" in which the vocally stunning Christina Aguilera sings the lovely ""be yourself"" themed song while ironically dressed quite un-Christina-like, and ""True to Your Heart,"" where Nick Lachey leads ""98 Degrees"" through Chinatown as they stalk a hot girl and run into Stevie Wonder. Both make for some darn good tunes and interesting visuals. A 3rd video offering is the Mandarin version of ""I'll Make a Man Out of You,"" sung by Jackie Chan. This makes for interesting entertainment for us Chan fans. One wonders, though, why Donnie Osmond didn't get a video for the American version. It's definitely one of the best moments in the film (though there are many great moments). And, the last video is, you guest it, Raven. This time, Raven sings ""True To Your Heart"" off the ""Disneymania 2"" CD. Now, I know we all get annoyed when Disney tries to pass a commercial off as legitimate art, but I have to admit that I think she sings pretty good. Problem is, why don't they make an effort to do a decent video? How many recording booth videos is Disney Channel going to make?Disc 2 of the ""Mulan"" 2-disc Special Edition carries over the ""Music and More"" section for one more video. This time, we get the Spanish version of ""Reflection,"" sung by an uncredited vocalist whom I am informed is named Lucero. It's pretty much the same thing as the Aguilera video, but in Spanish. Sadly, there is no big ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette on ""Mulan,"" which is too bad since I'm sure there was one made for the Disney Channel. They really should include those on their DVD releases. In fact, it seems that most of the ""Backstage Disney"" (as it is called) section extra features have been shot after the fact. We don't get to see the sort of footage we used to see in behind the scenes Disney stuff, with animators hard at work and voice actors in the recording studio. In fact, the voice cast is tragically absent from this set. Now that is a true shame. Not so much as an interview. However, there is still plenty to see and do, plus, many sections thankfully include the good ol' ""Play All"" button. We are offered first a section called ""The Journey Begins,"" which includes a look into a trip to China that the filmmakers took for inspiration and preparation, a wonderful recitation (set to artwork) of the poem the film used as a basis, and two early presentation reels. Second is the ""Story Artists' Journey,"" which holds a featurette of filmmakers reflecting back on the film along with storyboard to screen comparisons. Next is a favorite of mine, the ""Design"" section, where we get to see all those neat art galleries. I love to see all the cute artwork of Disney girls evolving into their final forms. *drool* This section also houses three featurettes on art design, character design, and color. Good stuff! The ""Production"" section offers progressive demonstrations, a featurette on ""The Hun Charge"" computer effects, and a featurette on crowd computer effects. The ""Music"" section simply holds a brief featurette that could have been longer, but as it is, makes point to mention one of Mulan's best attributes, only using songs that fit story purposes. The final bit of extras are in a section called ""International Mulan."" There's a featurette on translating the film for the world audience, a multi-language reel, and a publicity art gallery.There are only two major blemishes to this lovely 2-disc DVD release. One is the aforementioned lack of voice cast presence among the extras. The other is the fact that there are no theatrical trailers for the film itself to be found. Even the previous Gold Collection release had a trailer. Other than that, this is an excellent release of a beautiful and touching new Disney Classic that should be in everyone's DVD library, particularly recommended for those sick of Princesses and looking for a very different type of ""Disney Girl.""

Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan...etc. Mulan especially had one of Disney's first strong female characters that wasn't a princess, or a peasent girl who ends up BECOMING a princess...etc. She wasn't deprived of love, or care, or anything, but she still was motivated to be strong. Mulan was a wonderful movie, especially for young girls, because even though Aurora, Snow White, Ariel, Belle and Pocohantas are good rolemodels, Mulan is more of the 'every girl' .

455210,A3T0OTH5072YRE,6305229449,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","Growing up this was one of my favorite Disney movies.  In fact, there was a time that I watched it every day for two weeks straight.  Drove my parents crazy but I was happy.  I just liked how Mulan was empowered, and not as flighty as the other Disney women.Mulan is the only child of her mother and father, and as a girl, it is up to her to make a good match and marry well to bring her family honor.  The problem is, Mulan just isn't cut out for that type of life.  She isn't graceful enough and just has more spirit than a proper girl should.  So after failing at the Matchmaker's, she decides to further deviate from the appropriate path when she steals her father's armor and army conscription and rushes away into the night to take his place.  But pretending to be a boy will be a lot harder than she thinks, and even worse, training is not progressing well and the Huns are in China.Mulan is a strong female character.  Which is great when you consider that a lot of the Disney girls aren't that strong and are only holding out for their prince's approval.  So well done on this one Disney.  Even her love interest, Shang, doesn't know she's a girl, so there isn't that usual mix of romance that is found within these  movies.  Although Shang is a pretty neat guy himself, and seems dedicated to the work he is doing.  Her friends are pretty goofy and provide comic relief.  But then again Mushu does too in his dragon guardian role.  And all of the voice actors were spot on in this movie, I thought the voices fit well to the characters.This movie is very colorful and I like that; I especially love the part with the Chinese paper dragon as I thought it was pretty and authentic.  It was standard animation, and honestly, with all the Pixar and CGI stuff Disney does now, I had begun to miss the plain cartoon feel of the older movies.  They just seem like classic Disney.  Picking the story of Mulan to use, was as I said before,  a brilliant stroke by Disney to get a strong character out there.  It was a neat story and watching Mulan grow during it was fun too.  I can say that as an adult the story felt a little rushed, but not nearly so much as some of the other Disney movies.The music was fantastic in this movie.  I can honestly say I know all the words to all the songs and was singing along to it.  There's just something catchy about them, especially the ""I'll make a man out of you"" song.  Nothing like that to get the blood pumping  (maybe even better than the Rocky theme), or maybe I'm the only one who feels that way.  Regardless, the composers did a good job on this one.  In fact, the only song I don't like is the one where they are marching into battle; I can't even remember the name of it because I choose to ignore it.Great movie, one of my favorites of the Disney line up.  Fantastic characters, fabulous music, and a good story.  Well worth watching by the entire family.Review by M.

455212,A3JDMYLKDL2ZHS,6305229449,MRT,"[0, 0]","I believe this is the only Disney film where the main heroine isn't beguiled by love of a man to feel complete.  Not only that, but she doesn't scream feminist antics all over the place (like the annoying Jasmine in Aladdin).  Mulan shows that duty, honor and love of family and country, are very important.  I love showing this film over and over to my daughter because of this.  The fact that Mulan grows from an insecure clumsy and demure girl, to the hero of China, is a great story in its unfolding.  I love the artistry of the film and how all the backgrounds and nature look like Asian watercolor artwork.  The music is great, especially ""Reflection"" (the radio version of this song put Christina Aguilera's name on the map), and is beautifully sung by Broadway star Leah Salonga.

She's a bit of a klutz around the house and when she goes for an evaluation by the all important, she makes a shambles of the whole process.  None of these actions are intentional, they just seem to happen to Mulan.The turning point comes when there is an invasion of China from the west and able bodied men are summoned to join the Army.  Mulan's father, though not really fit, feels he must answer the call as he has no sons to send to serve the emporer.  Mulan hears of this and she disguises herself and runs off to the Army.  Here she is still disastor prone but when the training is done and the crunch comes, she proves herself to be all too competent and courageous, ultimately gaining the thanks of the emporor himself.This film is extremely well crafted.  The villians are typcially dark, brooding and sinister.  You know as soon as you come across them in the opening scenes of the film that they will not be good for China.  Violence is more implied than actually scene or it is indirect such as an avalanche that Mulan creates to save her unit buddies as they prepare to be over run by the human wave crashing down on them.  Villages are over run but there is no on screen gore, more just wrecked homes and scattered childrens toys.  The weasely snitch from the royal court is extremely well done.  He soon reveals that he is more at home with palace intrigues than roughing it with the troops.I found this to be a good film and with some parental preparation, it should be able to be viewed by all children, not to mention adults.

The adorable, mischievous dragon (Mushu) has Eddie Murphy's voice and is perhaps the cutest animation I have ever seen. Watch for what guardian dragon Mushu does when he is trying to explain why he is not ""just"" a lizard. It will knock your funny socks off.Mulan is extremely beautiful and her facial expressions make you actually feel everything she is feeling emotionally. I was so amazed they could put so much feeling into an animated character. Her lovable and tenacious spirit is admirable. She also seems to always be getting into trouble and the slapstick humor is the best I have ever seen in a Disney movie. The ""lucky"" cricket is a kind of side kick for the dragon and is supposed to bring Mulan luck.This is based on an ancient Chinese legend in which a girl disguises herself as a soldier to protect her aging father so he doesn't have to go to war against the Hun army (the soldiers all look like wrestlers) which has come across the northern border. Mulan trains for war and proves herself quite capable of learning martial arts and excelling at all areas of military training.The movie has a rather ominous beginning, a hilarious center and a memorable ending. It is just perfect to say the least. Through the movie Mulan is always trying to be the perfect daughter. What her father says at the end of the movie is so beautiful and shows the unconditional love between parent and child.The main point to the movie is to allow children to become the person they are inside. To nurture their true gifts and to give them unconditional love. ""The children of our country materially have just about everything, but what they're often lacking is love and attention."" -Johann Christoph ArnoldIn the Chinese culture, honor is very important, so this aspect is very prominent throughout the movie.

455247,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,6305229449,Simon,"[1, 1]","Disney got it right with their re-telling of the Mulan legend. It's a far better historical drama than Pocahontas, less dependant on fluff than Hercules, no sugary songs to clear the gloom like in Hunchback, and more of an original concept than the recycled Tarzan. And for what it's worth from a Chinese person's perspective, the stereotypes aren't too bad. Sidekicks are a little cheesy, but the main characters are handled well.All this makes for a rocking good time with Mulan. You get a truly independent and proactive female lead, and a genie-like character in Eddie Murphy's Mushu. There's actually a nice sense of danger and tension in the mountain scenes, with some excellent computer work to show a huge invading army. The villain's less memorable here, but he's pure evil without remorse, and there are tastefully handled offscreen deaths to show he isn't kidding around (hey, it's a war story). Fun songs keep the movie light where appropriate, and the whole project has a -slightly- more mature edge while remaining strictly Disney and family-friendly.Great collection of extras in this set, including some deleted material, the original Christina Aguilera music video, and behind-the-scenes stuff. Also of interest is a Jackie Chan music video from the overseas promotions.

When the Huns invade China Mulan's father is called to fight, but due to his ill health Mulan sneaks away, disguises herself as a boy and learns to fight in his place. She is assisted along the way by one of her family guardians, a tiny red dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy, before he became better known as the voice of Donkey in `Shrek').This film has some nice touches and is animated very well. The voice cast is very good and the music isn't too saccharine or cheesy either. You always know with a Disney film how the story will go, I.e. independent main character wants to find their own way in life, but family loyalty and immaturity holds them back, they go away and learn a lesson fighting an evil character of some description (usually assisted by a cute side-kick), find love and learn lessons and then they come home to a big happy ending family reunion. There may be slight deviations from this from film to film, but this is generally how they tend to go and it is a formula that works.All in all I enjoyed this film, maybe more so than the previously mentioned `Pocahontas', and whilst it was relatively short, it was entertaining for the duration.",4,Mulan,1299888000,"03 12, 2011",2011,1349,"['highly', 'formulaic', 'Mulan', 'one', 'better', 'Disney', 'films', 'more', 'recent', 'years.Like', 'Pocahontas', 'film', 'female', 'protagonist', 'independent', 'free', 'spirited', 'When', 'Huns', 'invade', 'China', 'Mulan', 'father', 'called', 'fight', 'due', 'ill', 'health', 'Mulan', 'away', 'boy', 'fight', 'place', 'assisted', 'way', 'one', 'family', 'guardians', 'tiny', 'red', 'dragon', 'voiced', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'became', 'better', 'known', 'voice', 'Donkey', 'Shrek', '.This', 'film', 'nice', 'touches', 'animated', 'very', 'well', 'voice', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'music', ""n't"", 'too', 'saccharine', 'cheesy', 'either', 'always', 'know', 'Disney', 'film', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'go', 'I.e', 'independent', 'main', 'character', 'find', 'own', 'way', 'life', 'family', 'loyalty', 'immaturity', 'back', 'go', 'away', 'learn', 'lesson', 'fighting', 'evil', 'character', 'description', 'usually', 'assisted', 'cute', 'side-kick', 'find', 'love', 'learn', 'lessons', 'then', 'come', 'home', 'big', 'happy', 'ending', 'family', 'reunion', 'may', 'be', 'slight', 'deviations', 'film', 'film', 'generally', 'how', 'tend', 'go', 'formula', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'maybe', 'more', 'so', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Pocahontas', 'whilst', 'was', 'relatively', 'short', 'was', 'entertaining', 'duration']",Mulan VHS

455252,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6305229449,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 6]","Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook's ""Mulan"" helped break a string of misfires from the famed Disney animation studio.  It does not rank high in the pantheon of the Magic Kingdom's library of classics due to its weak songs and villains, but Disney's time-tested combination of a strong heroine, amusing animal sidekicks, and bumbling supporting characters works well enough once more to provide a good time.To help fend off the invading Hun army, a Chinese girl named Mulan (Ming-Na) changes her appearance to pass as a boy in order to take her father's place in the Emperor's army.  She suffers through the training for the new recruits but develops feelings for Shang (B.D. Wong), the captain in charge of her.  Soon Mulan is thrust into the heat of battle but with the help of a lucky cricket, a dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy), and some colorful comrades-in-arms, she manages to save the kingdom, preserve her family's honor, and find true love.The one glaring weakness of ""Mulan"" is its songs.  The musical score from Jerry Goldsmith is great but the individual songs are forgettable.  ""Reflection"" is the only song that you can hum along to.  All of the rest of them are lackluster and limp.  This is too bad because, as ""The Little Mermaid"" (1989), ""Beauty & the Beast (1991), ""Aladdin"" (1992), and ""The Lion King"" (1994) have proved, quality songs can greatly enhance one's enjoyment of a film.  Furthermore, the Huns are woefully underdeveloped as villains.  They are simply portrayed as one-dimensional thugs who show up to help push the story along.  Yet, the positives outweigh the negatives in the final count: the animation is great, Murphy provides ample comic relief, the film moves at a brisk pace, and Mulan herself is vividly defined.  Certainly the Chinese heroine makes a worthy addition to Disney's honor roll of characters.",3,"""You don't meet a girl like that every dynasty!""",1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,1842,"['Tony', 'Bancroft', 'Barry', 'Cook', 'Mulan', 'helped', 'break', 'string', 'misfires', 'famed', 'Disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'not', 'rank', 'high', 'pantheon', 'Magic', 'Kingdom', 'library', 'classics', 'due', 'weak', 'songs', 'villains', 'Disney', 'time-tested', 'combination', 'strong', 'heroine', 'amusing', 'animal', 'sidekicks', 'bumbling', 'supporting', 'characters', 'well', 'enough', 'once', 'more', 'provide', 'good', 'time.To', 'help', 'fend', 'off', 'invading', 'Hun', 'army', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'named', 'Mulan', 'Ming-Na', 'appearance', 'pass', 'boy', 'order', 'take', 'father', 'place', 'Emperor', 'army', 'training', 'new', 'recruits', 'feelings', 'Shang', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'captain', 'charge', 'Soon', 'Mulan', 'thrust', 'heat', 'battle', 'help', 'lucky', 'cricket', 'dragon', 'named', 'Mushu', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'colorful', 'comrades-in-arms', 'save', 'kingdom', 'preserve', 'family', 'honor', 'find', 'true', 'love.The', 'one', 'glaring', 'weakness', 'Mulan', 'songs', 'musical', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'great', 'individual', 'songs', 'are', 'forgettable', 'Reflection', 'only', 'song', 'can', 'hum', 'along', 'rest', 'are', 'lackluster', 'limp', 'too', 'bad', 'because', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '1989', 'Beauty', 'Beast', '1991', 'Aladdin', '1992', 'Lion', 'King', '1994', 'have', 'proved', 'quality', 'songs', 'can', 'greatly', 'enhance', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'Huns', 'are', 'woefully', 'underdeveloped', 'villains', 'are', 'simply', 'portrayed', 'one-dimensional', 'thugs', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'help', 'push', 'story', 'along', 'positives', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'final', 'count', 'animation', 'great', 'Murphy', 'ample', 'comic', 'relief', 'film', 'moves', 'brisk', 'pace', 'Mulan', 'vividly', 'defined', 'Certainly', 'Chinese', 'heroine', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Disney', 'honor', 'roll', 'characters']",Mulan VHS

While it's not quite The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, I'd still give Mulan five stars just for the powerfully dramatic story and the message that, if I had little girls, I'd definitely want them to get from this movie.However, ""Special Edition"" is not my preferred term for this DVD. Mulan's ""Special Edition"" got basically the same treatment that The Lion King's ""Platinum Edition"" got - crap. Sorry, but a bunch of featurettes do not equal a real, cohesive ""making-of"" documentary. And the lack of theatrical trailers, at one time the sole bonus feature of a DVD, is inexcusable. DVDs with little or NO bonuses often at least include a trailer. I wouldn't have even spent money, but the transfer is top notch, in anamorphic widescreen, and that was worth the $10 I was able to get it for at Wal Mart. (I'm pretty sure it's not that cheap anymore, it was a limited-time only sale.)I didn't quite expect Platinum Edition treatment, so it didn't disappoint me like when I found out the specs for The Lion King, as it WAS a Platinum Edition and should have been handled better. But even the current 2-disc Pocahontas 10th Anniversary Edition and the now OOP Sleeping Beauty 2-Disc Special Edition managed to recycle an old making-of documentary to go with the other little featurettes on various things AND managed to include 2-3 theatrical trailers.If you only care about the movie and not the bonuses, definitely buy this. It's the only version of the movie in print, and rightfully so as the picture and sound are top notch. However, if you also like DVDs with great bonuses, I can't fully recommend this DVD.

I recently bought the Special Edition DVD release and did not enjoy the movie, that's why I hardly even took the time to look at the bonus features.  Disney was trying to go beyond their usual and classical formula of weak and lonesome heroines in need to be rescued, and they did a fine job at that, but they also went very, very wrong in other very important parts.In order to make Mulan seem like a real heroine, or just to represent women in a more realistic way, they turned men into complete fools, absolutely brainless and dumb and that is where the film producers went extremely wrong.  Nowadays it seems that in lots of cartoons men are represented this way, as ugly, burping/spiting machines with no brains and shapeless bodies while women are represented as mature, intelligent, beautiful and reliable and this is simply not right.  But are all men in ""Mulan"" like that?  No, there's Shang, he seems like a fine representation of intelligence and bravery, until it goes overboard.  At one point, Shang held back his tears at a time in which it was very normal for any man to cry and I didn't like that, it makes you think that men are supposed to never show emotion or pain and that is not true and it really bothered me.  Other flaws in this movie included the very, very annoying voice of Eddie Murphy, although it seems that for once he is able to control his foul-mouth, which is somewhat nice.  Animation is sharp but the art to it is absolutely terrible, with the excuse of wanting to imitate Chinese art, the animators made the characters angular and sort of painful to watch.  It is also hard to care for the characters in this film since each of them seems highly flawed.It is a shame that whenever Disney wants to go to new heights or step out of their classical style, they fail completely.  However, the film still has its high points, as I said, the animation is elaborate and sharp and the music is pretty cool (Except for when Raven sings in some of the bonuses, ugh!).

This means that the picture was re-formatted so that it would appear to be in the 1:85:1 ratio, which trimmed off the edges of the picture as well as some of the top and bottom. True wide-screen always gives you MORE picture. It's extremely important to know the bars on the top and bottom are UNUSED space. Also,the original DVD release was NOT compatible with wide-screen televisions. I have viewed this disc up-scaled on a 50 inch HDTV and it looks glorious!Now, for the first time, Mulan is presented in it's ORIGINAL aspect ratio of 1:66:1. This is the ratio for other films like Aladdin and The Lion King. The wide-screen is entirely anamorphic so wide-screen TV owners can rejoice at not having to stretch out the picture or have unnecessary black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. The picture quality/resolution is quite pleasing on an HD Display as I said above. Clear, bright, vivid colors show through on a spotless transfer of the film taken directly from the original CAPS files in the Disney vault.The bonus features are very good. A wealth of material is presented on both Disc 1 and 2, making this truly worthy of the title ""Special Edition"". The features themselves are covered in other reviews, so I won't go into that. Just let me say that this is definitely a DVD release that no Disney or Mulan fan should pass up.Mulan: ""Can you stay for dinner?""

The visuals are stunning, the music is incredible and the story line is the best Disney has done.  The fact that Mulan is not a 'typical' Disney princess makes me enjoy this movie.  I'm a grown woman, but there are moments when I find myself tearing up.  The gang of three provide the right amount of humor.  Mushu is the only likable 'animal' character from Disney since Sebastian the crab from ""The Little Mermaid"".  What's best about this movie?  No dashing Princes swooping into the save the day!
