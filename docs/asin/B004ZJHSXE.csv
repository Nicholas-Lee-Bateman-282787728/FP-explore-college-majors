1434696,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B004ZJHSXE,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[3, 3]","Again in Season two (2) on two (2) discs with four (4 ) hour long episodes (plus a bonus feature that is most informative giving the importance of Garrow to the British legal system and giving much insight into the ""real"" Garrow),  this very  splendid British historical drama ""Garrow's Law"", shows how William Garrow (wonderfully and intently acted by Andrew Buchan) is trying to get justice for all in 18th century England including slaves that were only considered property not humans, lower class people and/or those looked down upon by the so-called gentry.  What a marvelous series--it is so well directed and acted recreating the era being depicted fabulously.  We get the broad picture of England's judicial system of the era that favored the aristocrats along with Garrow's attempts to make the system fairer for everyone.  At the same time, the real character of Garrow along with his personal struggles (one being his love of Lady Sarah Hill the wife of the very nasty and powerful Assistant Secretary played brilliantly by Rubert Graves) is shown in a very believable way--one really admires Garrow and his efforts to change the judicial system for the better.Season two (2) is very brilliant with wonderful scripts, great acting and marvelous recreation of the era--what gorgeous costumes. All four (4) episodes are really outstanding especially, to me, the second episode which deals with illegal love and Garrow continually being accused of adultery with Lady Sarah and suffering the ramifications thereof--really fabulous acting by all and tremendous writing on the subject of forbidden love.  It's a very touching  episode that I adored.  . I never knew that history could be so entertaining.  (By he way, the role of Lady Sarah is brilliantly played by Lyndsey Marshal--she is so good)  I can't wait until Season three (3).",5,Still fighting for justice for all,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,1841,"['Again', 'Season', 'two', '2', 'two', '2', 'discs', 'four', '4', 'hour', 'long', 'episodes', 'bonus', 'feature', 'most', 'informative', 'giving', 'importance', 'Garrow', 'British', 'legal', 'system', 'giving', 'much', 'insight', 'real', 'Garrow', 'very', 'splendid', 'British', 'historical', 'drama', 'Garrow', 'Law', 'how', 'William', 'Garrow', 'wonderfully', 'intently', 'acted', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'trying', 'get', 'justice', '18th', 'century', 'England', 'including', 'slaves', 'were', 'only', 'considered', 'property', 'not', 'humans', 'lower', 'class', 'people', 'and/or', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'so-called', 'gentry', 'What', 'marvelous', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'directed', 'acted', 'recreating', 'era', 'being', 'depicted', 'fabulously', 'get', 'broad', 'picture', 'England', 'judicial', 'system', 'era', 'favored', 'aristocrats', 'Garrow', 'attempts', 'make', 'system', 'fairer', 'everyone', 'same', 'time', 'real', 'character', 'Garrow', 'personal', 'struggles', 'one', 'being', 'love', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Hill', 'wife', 'very', 'nasty', 'powerful', 'Assistant', 'Secretary', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Rubert', 'Graves', 'shown', 'very', 'believable', 'way', 'one', 'really', 'Garrow', 'efforts', 'change', 'judicial', 'system', 'better.Season', 'two', '2', 'very', 'brilliant', 'wonderful', 'scripts', 'great', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'recreation', 'era', 'what', 'gorgeous', 'costumes', 'four', '4', 'episodes', 'are', 'really', 'outstanding', 'especially', 'second', 'episode', 'illegal', 'love', 'Garrow', 'continually', 'being', 'accused', 'adultery', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'suffering', 'ramifications', 'thereof', 'really', 'fabulous', 'acting', 'tremendous', 'writing', 'subject', 'forbidden', 'love', 'very', 'touching', 'episode', 'adored', 'never', 'knew', 'history', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'entertaining', 'way', 'role', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Lyndsey', 'Marshal', 'so', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', 'three', '3']","GARROW'S LAW, SERIES 2"
1434697,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004ZJHSXE,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[1, 1]","Quickly has become one of my favorite shows of all-time. Garrow's Law Series 2 confirmed as BEST HISTORICAL LEGAL DRAMA, tops Rumpole. Near perfection for late-18th century historical reproduction in sets, costumes, & dialogue. It's more realistic 1700s scenes than the true period. Stunning visual detail. The plots, cases, and people are from real British Old Bailey criminal court data- the beginning of justice. Sir William Garrow (1760-1840) initiated ""Innocent until proven guilty."" This TV series, accurately reveals him idealistic, rescuer for wrongly arrested. He's young, eager, belligerent, rash, arrogant, and a winner. Since Garrow was champion to the poor, this series gives viewers an accurate look at commoners' life. 18th century low class was often taken advantage of by aristocrats. Modern law has inherited much legal good begun by Garrow.Stellar returning cast and powerful portrayals:Andrew Buchan (Cranford) as barrister Wm Garrow could be played no better.Lyndsey Marshall (Being Human) plays Lady Sarah Hill, exquisite in acting as well as filling her period aristocracy costumes. Those hats!Alun Armstrong (Little Dorrit, New Tricks) plays the true-to-history character, John Southouse, Garrow's mentor, a solicitor (attorney).Michael Culkin (The Hours, Lolita) is Judge Buller, mostly ruthless.Rupert Graves (Forsyte Sage, Death at a Funeral-see the UK version) plays Sir Arthur Hill, Sarah's nasty spouse, now Asst. Sec. to the Admiralty.Aidan McArdle (The Duchess, Ella Enchanted) is another REAL historical figure, John Silvester, a proud, rich, barrister who constantly opposes Garrow.4 episodes each an hour, includes SUBTITLES, with multiple plots and one main plot carrying from 1 through 4. Bonus: behind the Scenes Photos, 6 text fimlographies, and a 22 minute SUBTITLED featurette on the real Garrow.1-133 slaves are thrown overboard & drowned. The slave ship, Zong, Captain is tried for fraud--not murder. Dialogue quotes: ""Cargo can't be murdered."" ""Blacks be goods and property."" Meanwhile, Sir Hill attacks Lady Sarah believing Garrow is the true dad to his wife's son. Sleaze lawyer Farmer (Anton Lesser-Little Dorrit, Lorna Doone) is secured and will appear in all four 2010 episodes.2-Army Captain Robert Jones (Andrew Scott-John Adams, Longitude) faces death on a sexual assault charge. His friend (Rachel Pickup-Victoria & Albert) runs a Molly-house, male brothel, and this becomes a ""Buggery"" (Homosexual) case of two centuries past. Sarah & Garrow must not meet due to Sir Hill's legal action against both. But can they?3-A Greenwich disabled sailors' hospital mistreats patients, but it is the dire conditions reporter, honest Capt. Baillie (Ron Cook-Little Dorrit, Diary of Anne Frank) who needs Garrow to defend. Complicating matters, Hill is Baillie's libel accuser, he being Garrow's own accuser in the ongoing legal situation of adultery.4-Garrow tried for adultery. Surprisingly, Silvester, Garrow's longtime adversary, is in the courtroom. Lives, love, fortunes, and careers hang on a verdict. The ending is suspenseful and quite open leaving much room for more trials and romance in the 3rd series of Garrow's Law, which IS being produced. It's a CRIME to have to wait.Of course there is a Garrow's Law: Series 1 that is equally compelling and worthy viewing.Series 1 & 2 now prove this drama on a 6 star level with Foyle's War, Upstairs/Downstairs, Pallisers, etc.",5,wonderful law drama with historical perfection,1333152000,"03 31, 2012",2012,3422,"['Quickly', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'all-time', 'Garrow', 'Law', 'Series', '2', 'confirmed', 'BEST', 'HISTORICAL', 'LEGAL', 'DRAMA', 'tops', 'Rumpole', 'Near', 'perfection', 'late-18th', 'century', 'historical', 'reproduction', 'sets', 'costumes', 'dialogue', 'more', 'realistic', '1700s', 'scenes', 'true', 'period', 'Stunning', 'visual', 'detail', 'plots', 'cases', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'British', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'criminal', 'court', 'data-', 'beginning', 'justice', 'Sir', 'William', 'Garrow', '1760-1840', 'initiated', 'Innocent', 'proven', 'guilty', 'TV', 'series', 'accurately', 'idealistic', 'rescuer', 'wrongly', 'arrested', 'young', 'eager', 'belligerent', 'rash', 'arrogant', 'winner', 'Garrow', 'was', 'champion', 'poor', 'series', 'viewers', 'accurate', 'look', 'commoners', 'life', '18th', 'century', 'low', 'class', 'was', 'often', 'taken', 'advantage', 'aristocrats', 'Modern', 'law', 'inherited', 'much', 'legal', 'good', 'begun', 'Garrow.Stellar', 'returning', 'cast', 'powerful', 'portrayals', 'Andrew', 'Buchan', 'Cranford', 'barrister', 'Wm', 'Garrow', 'could', 'be', 'played', 'better.Lyndsey', 'Marshall', 'Being', 'Human', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Hill', 'exquisite', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'filling', 'period', 'aristocracy', 'costumes', 'hats', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'New', 'Tricks', 'true-to-history', 'character', 'John', 'Southouse', 'Garrow', 'mentor', 'solicitor', 'attorney', '.Michael', 'Culkin', 'Hours', 'Lolita', 'Judge', 'Buller', 'mostly', 'ruthless.Rupert', 'Graves', 'Forsyte', 'Sage', 'Death', 'Funeral-see', 'UK', 'version', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Hill', 'Sarah', 'nasty', 'spouse', 'now', 'Asst', 'Sec', 'Admiralty.Aidan', 'McArdle', 'Duchess', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'REAL', 'historical', 'figure', 'John', 'Silvester', 'proud', 'rich', 'barrister', 'who', 'constantly', 'Garrow.4', 'hour', 'SUBTITLES', 'multiple', 'plots', 'one', 'main', 'plot', 'carrying', '1', '4', 'Bonus', 'Scenes', 'Photos', '6', 'text', 'fimlographies', '22', 'minute', 'SUBTITLED', 'featurette', 'real', 'Garrow.1-133', 'slaves', 'are', 'thrown', 'overboard', 'drowned', 'slave', 'ship', 'Zong', 'Captain', 'tried', 'fraud', 'not', 'murder', 'Dialogue', 'Cargo', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'murdered', 'Blacks', 'be', 'goods', 'property', 'Meanwhile', 'Sir', 'Hill', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'believing', 'Garrow', 'true', 'dad', 'wife', 'son', 'Sleaze', 'lawyer', 'Farmer', 'Anton', 'Lesser-Little', 'Dorrit', 'Lorna', 'Doone', 'secured', 'will', 'appear', 'four', '2010', 'episodes.2-Army', 'Captain', 'Robert', 'Jones', 'Andrew', 'Scott-John', 'Adams', 'Longitude', 'death', 'sexual', 'assault', 'charge', 'friend', 'Rachel', 'Pickup-Victoria', 'Albert', 'Molly-house', 'male', 'brothel', 'Buggery', 'Homosexual', 'case', 'two', 'centuries', 'Sarah', 'Garrow', 'must', 'not', 'meet', 'due', 'Sir', 'Hill', 'legal', 'action', 'can', '3-A', 'Greenwich', 'disabled', 'sailors', 'hospital', 'mistreats', 'patients', 'dire', 'conditions', 'reporter', 'honest', 'Capt', 'Baillie', 'Ron', 'Cook-Little', 'Dorrit', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'who', 'Garrow', 'defend', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'Hill', 'Baillie', 'libel', 'accuser', 'being', 'Garrow', 'own', 'accuser', 'ongoing', 'legal', 'situation', 'adultery.4-Garrow', 'tried', 'adultery', 'Surprisingly', 'Silvester', 'Garrow', 'longtime', 'adversary', 'courtroom', 'love', 'fortunes', 'careers', 'hang', 'verdict', 'ending', 'suspenseful', 'quite', 'open', 'leaving', 'much', 'room', 'more', 'trials', 'romance', '3rd', 'series', 'Garrow', 'Law', 'being', 'produced', 'CRIME', 'have', 'wait.Of', 'course', 'Garrow', 'Law', '1', 'equally', 'compelling', 'worthy', 'viewing.Series', '1', '2', 'now', 'prove', 'drama', '6', 'star', 'level', 'Foyle', 'War', 'Upstairs/Downstairs', 'Pallisers', 'etc']","GARROW'S LAW, SERIES 2"

1434700,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B004ZJHSXE,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","Another current British production, GARROW&#8217;S LAW is the story of William Garrow, the 18th-Century historical barrister who turned the legal profession on its ear. It was Garrow who coined the expression &#8220;innocent until proven guilty&#8221; and in this series Garrow is most certainly the champion of the underdog.A certain amount of artistic licence is acceptable in fleshing out an historical character like Garrow. Presenting him as being particularly drawn to unpopular causes is to be expected, though isn&#8217;t always successful.This four episode series sees Garrow take on such issues as the slave trade, which works well as drama, as well as a reminder that Garrow has contemporary relevance as a defender of human rights.Usually Garrow&#8217;s views and procedures as he undertook these courtroom battles are well-documented and the writers of the show are able to incorporate them into the scripts. This gives the program a certain authenticity which really serves the drama.However one episode goes a bit too far, in my view. During this period in history in the United Kingdom, sodomy was a serious offence, punishable by a severe prison sentence. An accusation of sodomy was sometimes used as a tool to blackmail individuals who might, in all likelihood, be entirely innocent. The subject was considered so distasteful at that time that court records were censored, thereby leaving out details of the accusation and only recording the fact that such a trial occurred, and its outcome.Historical records show that Garrow defended one such accused individual. From that scrap of information, the writers concoct an episode that essentially makes Garrow a champion of gay rights. While this is all acceptable to most contemporary mindsets, it is questionable in the context of an historical drama. It&#8217;s modernistic and unrealistic to show the couple engaging in a tender kiss inside a prison cell. In a solidly historical drama, modernism is obvious and out of place.Political correctness aside, this is the only aberration in an otherwise excellent set of episodes to further the series.The other main story arc is Garrow&#8217;s relationship with Lady Sarah Hill, which results in his being charged with &#8220;criminal conversation,&#8221; which was the 18th-Century euphemism for adultery.The strains of these circumstances test Garrow&#8217;s ability to focus on the other cases in his workload, including one involving a young child.Andrew Buchan is appropriately principled as Garrow, but it is especially appealing to see the great Alun Armstrong again as Garrow&#8217;s friend and mentor, John Southouse. Armstrong is also currently one of the principal cast members of &#8220;New Tricks&#8221;. His character couldn&#8217;t be more different in that show.GARROW&#8217;S LAW is an excellent series, only occasionally marred by striving to present an admittedly forward-thinking hero as just a little too much in synch with contemporary values. Still, there is much more to enjoy than there is to criticize.",4,Gets a bit bogged down in mid-series.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3044,"['current', 'British', 'production', 'GARROW', '8217', 'S', 'LAW', 'story', 'William', 'Garrow', '18th-Century', 'historical', 'barrister', 'who', 'turned', 'legal', 'profession', 'ear', 'was', 'Garrow', 'who', 'coined', 'expression', '8220', 'innocent', 'proven', 'guilty', '8221', 'series', 'Garrow', 'most', 'certainly', 'champion', 'underdog.A', 'certain', 'amount', 'artistic', 'licence', 'acceptable', 'fleshing', 'out', 'historical', 'character', 'Garrow', 'Presenting', 'being', 'particularly', 'drawn', 'unpopular', 'causes', 'be', 'expected', 'isn', '8217', 'always', 'successful.This', 'four', 'episode', 'series', 'Garrow', 'take', 'such', 'issues', 'slave', 'trade', 'well', 'drama', 'as', 'well', 'reminder', 'Garrow', 'contemporary', 'relevance', 'defender', 'human', 'rights.Usually', 'Garrow', '8217', 'views', 'procedures', 'courtroom', 'battles', 'are', 'well-documented', 'writers', 'show', 'are', 'able', 'incorporate', 'scripts', 'program', 'certain', 'authenticity', 'really', 'drama.However', 'one', 'episode', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'view', 'period', 'history', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'sodomy', 'was', 'serious', 'offence', 'punishable', 'severe', 'prison', 'sentence', 'accusation', 'sodomy', 'was', 'sometimes', 'used', 'tool', 'blackmail', 'individuals', 'who', 'might', 'likelihood', 'be', 'entirely', 'innocent', 'subject', 'was', 'considered', 'so', 'distasteful', 'time', 'court', 'records', 'were', 'censored', 'thereby', 'leaving', 'out', 'details', 'accusation', 'only', 'recording', 'fact', 'trial', 'occurred', 'outcome.Historical', 'records', 'show', 'Garrow', 'defended', 'one', 'such', 'accused', 'individual', 'scrap', 'information', 'writers', 'concoct', 'episode', 'essentially', 'Garrow', 'champion', 'gay', 'rights', 'acceptable', 'most', 'contemporary', 'mindsets', 'questionable', 'context', 'historical', 'drama', '8217', 'modernistic', 'unrealistic', 'show', 'couple', 'engaging', 'tender', 'kiss', 'prison', 'cell', 'solidly', 'historical', 'drama', 'modernism', 'obvious', 'place.Political', 'correctness', 'aside', 'only', 'aberration', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'set', 'episodes', 'further', 'series.The', 'other', 'main', 'story', 'arc', 'Garrow', '8217', 'relationship', 'Lady', 'Sarah', 'Hill', 'results', 'being', 'charged', '8220', 'criminal', 'conversation', '8221', 'was', '18th-Century', 'euphemism', 'adultery.The', 'strains', 'circumstances', 'test', 'Garrow', '8217', 'ability', 'focus', 'other', 'cases', 'workload', 'including', 'one', 'involving', 'young', 'child.Andrew', 'Buchan', 'appropriately', 'principled', 'Garrow', 'especially', 'appealing', 'see', 'great', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'again', 'Garrow', '8217', 'friend', 'mentor', 'John', 'Southouse', 'Armstrong', 'also', 'currently', 'one', 'principal', 'cast', 'members', '8220', 'New', 'Tricks', '8221', 'character', 'couldn', '8217', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'show.GARROW', '8217', 'S', 'LAW', 'excellent', 'series', 'only', 'occasionally', 'marred', 'striving', 'present', 'admittedly', 'forward-thinking', 'hero', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'synch', 'contemporary', 'values', 'Still', 'much', 'more', 'enjoy', 'criticize']","GARROW'S LAW, SERIES 2"

1434702,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B004ZJHSXE,lily t.,"[1, 1]","Season two of Garrow's law takes some personal turns, both in the stories of Garrow and Lady Sarah and in the courtroom.Initially, like the reviewer who gave the second season two stars, when confronted with the stories of the slaves and the homosexuals, I thought, oh here we are imposing post modernist thought on history. Not so, and just a bit of an internet search proves it. I found it so interesting I must share (forgive me for being such a nerd)  and begin by saying that all the cases presented in the series took place at the Old Bailey or other courts of law.Concerning episode 1, featuring insurance fraud, during which 'cargo' in the form of human beings from Africa is jettisoned off ship in the Caribbean for the value of its loss against market value of slaves.Antislavery sentiments began with the Enlightenment philosophers Rousseau and Montesquieu writing against the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In the 1780's the Abolitionist movement was in full swing and featured in the work of political economists such as Adam Smith and the active works of the Quakers. The American Revolution and the loss of the colonies caused the British to examine their own role in their Empire as the political debate focused on both freedom and enfranchisement. In 1787 The Society for Affecting the Abolition of Slaves was founded, and within it freed Africans played a most instrumental role.As for Homosexuality, events depicted in the second episode are accurate, though the details of the trials themselves were censored and are unavailable for detailed historical examination. Apparently London had a flourishing homosexual community, centered around 'Molly Houses', though until 1861 homosexual acts were punishable by death. Most of the cases brought to trial however were in incidental cases such as blackmail, since the actual act required witnesses to intimate details. From the 1690's onward, in successive waves, Societies for the Preservation of Manners actively pursued  homosexual men employing spies, provocateurs and thief takers -and one such large action took place in the 1770's.On the personal level, concerning  Garrow's own trial where he is accused of adultery with Lady Sarah, the laws of coverture under Common Law were as such (I'll cut and paste from Wikipedia for the sake of expediency): ' A feme sole had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name. A feme covert was not recognized as having legal rights and obligations distinct from those of her husband in most respects. Instead, through marriage a woman's existence was incorporated into that of her husband, so that she had very few recognized individual rights of her own.A married woman could not own property, sign legal documents or enter into a contract, obtain an education against her husband's wishes, or keep a salary for herself. If a wife was permitted to work, under the laws of coverture she was required to relinquish her wages to her husband. In certain cases, a wife did not have individual legal liability for her misdeeds, since it was legally assumed that she was acting under the orders of her husband, and generally a husband and a wife were not allowed to testify either for or against each other.'

The stories intertwine with Garrows own legal problems as he tries to defend his honor and love and against false charges of adultry. At least it wasn't a hanging offense. But other crimes like stealing and buggery still were. The tension is higher therefore during this season and the actors are all up to the challenge. Not only that we get a glimpse back into the brutal world of the 1700's , and the english system was far superior to most of the worlds courts at the time!, we also get very accurate historical sets as well.  This one looks great and has a extra in words about the true Garrow. What a man he was by any standards! We all owe him and thankfully this show is out there to familiarize us with this law reformer who coined the term 'innocent until proven guilty"". His influence can be felt in the U.S. as well as other countries as his cases were legendary in those days.  This show is well worth your time , as it moves fast and is engaging om many levels. Rupert Graves plays a excellent villian too. His insane jealousy causes him to lose his own son and that is just a part of how bad he is. Alun armstrong plays a tough lawyer too , he's always done a great job which is why it's great he's in here. (he's great in New Tricks"" too.)

When I started the first series, I was disturbed by the first courtroom scene as it seemed so chaotic.  But I kept with it and it turned out to be one great series. The chaos was how it was then, with the wealthy minor royals there for entertainment, and the poor and mostly innocent defendants being the entertainers. Although actually, at the time there was no true defense offered them.  They were murdered. Sent to death by purchased judges, and jurors who were probably purchased as well.
