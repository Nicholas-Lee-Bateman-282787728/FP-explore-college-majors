The first one, &quot;Tonin' Uptown&quot; is for your upper body, and the &quot;Tonin' Downtown&quot; is for...you guessed it, your lower body.  The tapes run around 30-40 minutes each and are easy enough for a beginner to do.  The music keeps you moving and let's face it...Richard Simmons is just pretty darn motivational!  It's hard not to give the exercise routine your best effort, even though he's just on tape!  Be forwarned--the toning rings are NOT included with the videos, but you can easily buy them at many discount stores.  The students in his class could be you and me...they aren't all drop-dead gorgeous looking models, and I appreciate that.  Instead of sitting at the computer, why don't you order this tape and get busy toning with Richard??",4,Great Way to Get in Shape!,996710400,"08 2, 2001",2001,841,"['tapes', 'are', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'two', 'tape', 'set', 'first', 'one', 'quot', 'Tonin', 'Uptown', 'quot', 'upper', 'body', 'quot', 'Tonin', 'Downtown', 'quot', 'guessed', 'lower', 'body', 'tapes', 'run', '30-40', 'minutes', 'are', 'easy', 'enough', 'beginner', 'do', 'music', 'moving', 'let', 'face', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'just', 'pretty', 'darn', 'motivational', 'hard', 'not', 'give', 'exercise', 'routine', 'best', 'effort', 'even', 'just', 'tape', 'Be', 'forwarned', 'toning', 'rings', 'are', 'NOT', 'included', 'videos', 'can', 'easily', 'buy', 'many', 'discount', 'stores', 'students', 'class', 'could', 'be', 'are', ""n't"", 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'looking', 'models', 'appreciate', 'Instead', 'sitting', 'computer', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'order', 'tape', 'get', 'busy', 'toning', 'Richard']",Tonin Uptown and Tonin Downtown VHS
501128,A1DU8G4KYPXP09,B00000G3CB,Anne Omniuss,"[17, 17]","This is a really fun toning video.  It has great music, fun sets and is really motivating.  It is divided into two sections.  Tonin' Uptown is an upper body workout and Tonin' Downtown is lower body and abs.  Each section  is about half an hour with its own warm up and cool down so you can just do  half if that's all you have time for.  This is a good video for a beginner  or intermediate exerciser.  Someone really fit would not find it very  challening at all.  My only complaint is that the toning rings could be a  little bit sturdier.  Mine are showing a lot of wear from so much use.",5,Fun Fun Fun,952387200,"03 7, 2000",2000,592,"['really', 'fun', 'toning', 'video', 'great', 'music', 'fun', 'sets', 'really', 'motivating', 'divided', 'two', 'sections', 'Tonin', 'Uptown', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'Tonin', 'Downtown', 'lower', 'body', 'abs', 'section', 'hour', 'own', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'just', 'do', 'half', 'have', 'time', 'good', 'video', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'Someone', 'really', 'fit', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'very', 'challening', 'only', 'complaint', 'toning', 'rings', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'sturdier', 'Mine', 'are', 'showing', 'lot', 'wear', 'so', 'much', 'use']",Tonin Uptown and Tonin Downtown VHS

Working with the rings was different and fun.  I enjoyed it, but I didn't feel I was getting the workout I wanted/needed.  Of the two sessions, I thought Downtown was harder, though maybe that's because my legs are in worse shape than my upper body.  After using this for a couple of months I felt like I wasn't making the progress that I wanted.  So I went searching for something more difficult.  I figure that as long as I'm taking the time to exercise, it should make a difference.  I recommend the following two DVDs for good strength training workouts:Get Ripped! with Jari Love: Slim & LeanandThe Trainer's Edge: Integrated Strength TrainingI recommend Tonin' Uptown and Tonin' Downtown for people just starting out.  Unfortunately, this only comes on VHS.

You could hurt yourself if  your wrists, shoulders, and knees aren't in the right position at the right  time. Other than that, these are fun routines and provide thorough toning.  I'm sorry to hear that the rings aren't included, but you can get them  through Richard's site as well as heavier rings, to which I just graduated.  The best part about the rings is that they're easy to travel with.
