905468,A2QTUGY93B1ABU,B0009H97IU,"Amazon Customer ""old rider""","[2, 2]","A great movie in its full uncut version, but this DVD is heavily edited.  As a result, you don't get the full range of the characters personalities, ie  Greg's "" I only take showers"" scene at Marcy's apartment,  and Linda's confession to her dead lover's dad that she is actually married to Greg and could he keep it quiet?  There were other cuts that tended to help explain the characters motives and actions.  I felt the plot twists were probably harder to follow as a result.  If you can find the full version, buy it.  It is a darkly funny and even romantic film. Don't buy this edited version.  4 stars for the full movie only.

This was a very good movie. Very suspensful,and believable. Just when you think somebody is busted ,they squirm away in a very believable manner. It's not all fake and contrived like all these movies these days. Everybody seems so calm and collected in movies, but not this one. And the most shocking thing about this movie is that it was made for TV in the UK. A TV movie ,that in my opinion is better than 90% of crap put out here.

She also works a part time gig as a waitress for a catering company. In the latter capacity, she's present at the surprise birthday bash thrown by Greg Brentwood (Michael Kitchen) for his wife Linda (Phyllis Logan) at their country house. During the festivities, from her vantage point in the kitchen, she observes Greg's business partner, Martin Shaps (Tom Knight), engage in a bit of surreptitious touchy-feely with Linda. The two are evidently more than just friends. Later, on the way back to the city with the rest of the catering crew, Marcey discovers that she's left her purse back at the Brentwood house. She returns at 2:00 AM to discover the place pretty much deserted except for Greg bent over Martin's dead body. Terrified, Burgess locks herself in a bathroom, and listens through the door as Greg explains the situation; Martin's death was an accident. And Linda had left earlier to spend the night with her sister after a Big Row over the expense of the party; the Brentwoods are financially strapped. When Marcey lets slip that she thinks Linda and Martin were lovers by mentioning the tactile incident, Greg is devastated. Believing Greg's story about his partner's death, and feeling sorry for the former, Burgess emerges from the loo to help plan body disposal.It would be unseemly to gush too much about ALIBI; there are problems. Marcey's motive for helping Greg out of a dodgy spot was never rationalized to my satisfaction. Sure, she obviously felt sympathy for the guy. But abet winkling away a corpse? Puhleeze! Perhaps she was compensating for having to deny petitioners benefits after listening to their hard luck stories all day/every day at the office. Also, the manner by which Martin's cadaver was eventually disposed wasn't completely thought out by the scriptwriters. Lucky for our two conspirators that Columbo wasn't on the local constabulary.The real treat is watching Sophie display a range of behavior from fear-induced hysteria to coldly rational problem solving characterized by an intelligent cleverness unexpected in a bureaucratic desk drone. Yup, Okonedo has a wealth of acting talent that makes me want to seek out any other Big Screen role that she's played. Kitchen is good also, but his Brentwood persona is very nearly that of the same actor's Inspector Foyle in the marvelous British miniseries FOYLE'S WAR, albeit a bit more of a whiny Sad Sack.ALIBI is the perfect film for that dinner before the telly.",4,Sophie O. before HOTEL RWANDA,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,2805,"['were', 'impressed', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', '2004', 'HOTEL', 'RWANDA', 'played', 'wife', 'beleaguered', 'hotel', 'manager', 'role', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'then', 'do', 'favor', 'view', 'ALIBI.Here', 'movie', 'made', 'British', 'telly', 'Sophie', 'Marcey', 'Burgess', 'regular', '9', '5', 'benefits', 'claims', 'verifier', 'also', 'part', 'time', 'gig', 'waitress', 'catering', 'company', 'latter', 'capacity', 'present', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'thrown', 'Greg', 'Brentwood', 'Michael', 'Kitchen', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Phyllis', 'Logan', 'country', 'house', 'festivities', 'vantage', 'point', 'kitchen', 'Greg', 'business', 'partner', 'Martin', 'Shaps', 'Tom', 'Knight', 'engage', 'bit', 'surreptitious', 'touchy-feely', 'Linda', 'two', 'are', 'evidently', 'more', 'just', 'friends', 'Later', 'way', 'back', 'city', 'rest', 'catering', 'crew', 'Marcey', 'left', 'purse', 'back', 'Brentwood', 'house', '2:00', 'AM', 'discover', 'place', 'pretty', 'much', 'deserted', 'Greg', 'bent', 'Martin', 'dead', 'body', 'Terrified', 'Burgess', 'bathroom', 'door', 'Greg', 'situation', 'Martin', 'death', 'was', 'accident', 'Linda', 'had', 'left', 'earlier', 'spend', 'night', 'sister', 'Big', 'Row', 'expense', 'party', 'Brentwoods', 'are', 'financially', 'strapped', 'When', 'Marcey', 'slip', 'Linda', 'Martin', 'were', 'lovers', 'mentioning', 'tactile', 'incident', 'Greg', 'devastated', 'Believing', 'Greg', 'story', 'partner', 'death', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'former', 'Burgess', 'loo', 'help', 'plan', 'body', 'disposal.It', 'would', 'be', 'unseemly', 'gush', 'too', 'much', 'ALIBI', 'are', 'problems', 'Marcey', 'motive', 'helping', 'Greg', 'dodgy', 'spot', 'was', 'never', 'rationalized', 'satisfaction', 'Sure', 'obviously', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'guy', 'abet', 'winkling', 'away', 'corpse', 'Puhleeze', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'compensating', 'having', 'deny', 'petitioners', 'benefits', 'listening', 'hard', 'luck', 'stories', 'day/every', 'day', 'office', 'Also', 'manner', 'Martin', 'cadaver', 'was', 'eventually', 'disposed', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'thought', 'out', 'scriptwriters', 'Lucky', 'two', 'conspirators', 'Columbo', 'was', ""n't"", 'local', 'constabulary.The', 'real', 'treat', 'watching', 'Sophie', 'display', 'range', 'behavior', 'fear-induced', 'hysteria', 'coldly', 'rational', 'problem', 'solving', 'characterized', 'intelligent', 'cleverness', 'unexpected', 'bureaucratic', 'desk', 'drone', 'Yup', 'Okonedo', 'wealth', 'acting', 'talent', 'want', 'seek', 'out', 'other', 'Big', 'Screen', 'role', 'played', 'Kitchen', 'good', 'also', 'Brentwood', 'persona', 'very', 'nearly', 'same', 'actor', 'Inspector', 'Foyle', 'marvelous', 'British', 'miniseries', 'FOYLE', 'WAR', 'bit', 'more', 'whiny', 'Sad', 'Sack.ALIBI', 'perfect', 'film', 'dinner', 'telly']",N/A

Any program with him in it will not disappoint you. This movie is no different. It has ""on the edge of your seat"" intensity, with exceptional acting, and a plot that will grab you and not let you go. If you are expecting to see a calm and collected Christopher Foyle in this film, he is not here.

After a while, you begin to realize that it's not all ""dead"" serious. There is dark humor around the edges, and the two protagonists become partners in a cover-up that keeps threatening to come unraveled.The man (Michael Kitchen) claims the death was accidental, though the body, it turns out, belongs to a man having an affair with his wife. The young woman (Sophie Okonedo), who has no reason to get involved, does anyway - and thereby hangs the tale. Paul Abbott, writer for the series ""Cracker,"" keeps the complications piling up as revelation follows revelation, and each of the characters gets into and out of one predicament after another. Kitchen, parodying all the grimaces and facial contortions of his likeably reticent detective Foyle (""Foyle's War""), gets to muddle on under the influence of a few too many Valium.
