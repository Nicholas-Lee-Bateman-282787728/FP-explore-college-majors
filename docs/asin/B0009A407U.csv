902830,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0009A407U,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[8, 8]","This volume features Tom Hanks' work on Saturday Night Live, from his first appearance on the ill-fated '85-'86 season through the late nineties, but the majority of the material deals with the Hartman-Lovitz years, my personal favorite cast. Hanks and Lovitz, in particular, are paired quite often, especially in their frequent ""Girl Watchers"" sketches and an audience interview segment with Lovitz asking Hanks who his favorite performer on the show was (and he doesn't stop until he hears Jon Lovitz). Some of the stuff is familiar--the Wayne's World represented here is the Aerosmith one, and that and ""Jew, not a Jew"" were available on the videotape. However, there are a LOT of sketches here that will likely not see the light of day again, like Hanks, Damon Wayans, and others playing stand-up comics who deliver every line in their lives like a stand-up act, the really funny ""Five-Timers"" sketch, which centers around an exclusive club where five-time hosts reside (with SNL poking a little fun at its rarefied image), and a sketch where Hanks plays a loving husband that occasionally fantasizes that his wife is dead. As far as these compilations go, this is one of the best I've seen, on the same level as Phil Hartman's and Eddie Murphy's, and certainly worth a buy. And for the person who left the message about there not being a ""Best of"" for Gilda Radner, or others, I agree, but then again, Hanks deserves a DVD more than Tracy Morgan and Chris Kattan, need I say more. I'm jumping off a building when they release The Best of Fred Armisen. Just kidding, it will hopefully never happen.

902831,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B0009A407U,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[3, 3]","Tom Hanks is one of ""Saturday Night's Live's"" most beloved and talented hosts. Each of his seven episodes have produced a lot of classic moments, most if not all of which are included on the dvd ""The Best Of Tom Hanks"".This dvd contains sketches from all seven of his hosting gigs between 1985 and 1996, as well as his appearance at the show's 25th anniversary special and a 2001 cameo special. The majority of the sketches are extremely funny. I especially enjoyed the Five Timers Club sketch and my personal favorite ""Mr. Short Term Memory"", which also featured a great performance by Phil Hartman. In fact, I enjoyed almost all of the sketches except for ""Tales Of Ribaldry"" and the one where he fantasises about his wife dying. I also agree that the Spartan Cheerleaders sketch was definitely a starring vehicle for Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri, but it's suffice to say that Hanks makes the most of his screen time.However, the funniest sketch is the dress rehearsal sketch is the funniest thing on the entire dvd. It's the ""Nude Beach"" sketch with the ""Penis Song"". The aired version with Matthew Broderick is slightly funnier than the one on here, but this one is still very funny.While it isn't perfect, this dvd is an excellent addition to the ""SNL"" catalogue.

902833,A2QZBDTO9F5J06,B0009A407U,"Jack Pripusich ""Doctor Pretorius""","[0, 0]","This DVD is a good opus from SNL. But it pales when compared to the Steve Martin or Chris Farley editions. Best moments are the  "" 5-time hosting club"" skit and the ""Aerosmith on Wayne's World""  event in which Hanks plays the roadie for the band. For me, it's the inclusion of Steve Martin, Paul Simon, Elliot Gould,  Aerosmith, etc. that seal those deals. While I appreciate Hanks' talent, I just don't find him that humorous. Sorry. I find the surrounding cast funnier across the board. Different strokes for different folks I guess.He is a very cooperative and engaging host...he blends well with the ensemble. He's a big star, and I do give him an ""A"" for effort. The extra feature spotlighting Sheri Oteri and Molly Shannon in a junior high production of Shakespeare with Hanks very good as director (an  unaired skit) is worth a look.

902834,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B0009A407U,James Duckett,"[6, 7]","Tom Hanks is by far one of the funniest hosts of the program.  There is so much material that they could choose from for a ""Best Of SNL"" and I'm shocked that was what they chose.  What gives?!?!??For one thing, there were three skits (Wayne's World Aerosmith,Spartan Cheerleaders, and Wilson the Volleyball) where Hanks is hardly even a part of the skit.  In fact, in the Wilson one he doesn't even have a line.  And many of the other skits had Tom Hanks as a small role.What I was hopeful of seeing was ""Mr. Short-Term Memory,"" which I think is one of his best reoccurring roles, but the one they chose was not his best one.  How disappointing!  Are his other ones being saved for another DVD?Anyways, most (not all) of the skits are fun and original.  Unfortunately, some of them are real duds.  I just wish they would choose better skits.  Better yet, let the fans of SNL choose for them.  Then we'd be getting better ""Best Of..."" DVDs.My top three favorites are:1) The Bean Cafe.  This was very creative.  And what makes it so funny is that not a single joke is told.2) The movie, Big, before some script changes were made.  There is one scene that shows several takes that is just plain hilarious.3) Mr. Belvedere Fan Club.  You might think you love Mr. Belvedere, but here are some people who are a little too obsessive about him.If you love Tom Hanks, you still need to check this DVD out.

Its almost as tragic as leaving off the ""Get off the shed"" sketch on the Will Ferrel DVD's.
