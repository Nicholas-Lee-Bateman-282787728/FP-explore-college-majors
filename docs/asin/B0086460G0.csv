1547123,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B0086460G0,"Been around this block, several times over","[4, 4]","I can understand the review by ""Pearls of Wisdom,"" but, as a guy of a certain age, my take on this film was a bit  different.  I have been through so much in my life, lost and gained so much, but I always knew there would be (in the words of another movie) a ""before"" and an ""after"" no matter what happened.  Well, these days my ""before"" is beginning to outweigh my ""after"" with a vengeance.  It seems every morning I get up to the ""after"" getting smaller and smaller, and the ""before"" getting exponentially larger and larger.  In other words, I now carry a very big ""before,"" and with little or limited ""after"" to do something about anything I might still wish (prior to ""getting my ticket punched"") to recapture or to alter about my ""before"".This seems the stealth message of this movie.  We never know how much time we've got left.  How often I've wanted to embrace and reassure the little boy going through so much in my childhood, to let him know that things will get better.  He went a lot of years alone and not at all sure about whether things would improve.  But he kept trying, and I'd like to let him know that the mature and relatively accomplished (at least pretty much close to as accomplished as he's ever going to get) version of himself would be there years later to successfully fly his banner.The trajectory of life is brutal, filled with wrong turns, missed opportunities, and aching regrets--and they pile up rapidly on the tail end of life.  The approach to the end is an inherently lonely journey, for one finds him/herself progressively ever more on his/her own as things begin to conclude.  I see the movie as basically about young people struggling to let the good within themselves out, while at the same time they find themselves simultaneously distracted by calls for the worst within themselves.  Will there be time to do it?  We can't all hold out very well against such pressure, but the girls in this movie seem to have stuck together in order to learn to do just that.We see them as mature women struggling with the struggles of mature women, suddenly thrust into a kind of rerunning the tapes of their youth.  Throughout the movie we find ourselves gaining a surprizingly deeper understanding of the core humanity of nostalgia in this process--something I was not able to permit myself in my youth (for then . . . I felt as if I would live forever).  Do buy the movie and watch it with a generous heart and an open mind that is not overly frightened by the existential anxiety that accompanies anyone undergoing life's trajectory.Please forgive the schmaltz of this review of this emotionally gripping tear-jerker masquerading as a comedy; but it's the Xmas season, I've got an ill 94 years old mother whose girlhood could easily have fit into the spirit of this movie, and I've experienced too many passings of key persons in my life (as did the ""protagonist"" in this movie).  How I wish there was still time to gather the scattered and disappeared strands of my youth!  That was the gift SUNNY sort of gave its members.",5,when a lot of one's lifetime has run its course,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,3056,"['can', 'understand', 'review', 'Pearls', 'Wisdom', 'guy', 'certain', 'age', 'take', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'different', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'lost', 'gained', 'so', 'much', 'always', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'words', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'Well', 'days', 'beginning', 'outweigh', 'vengeance', 'morning', 'get', 'up', 'getting', 'smaller', 'smaller', 'getting', 'exponentially', 'larger', 'larger', 'other', 'words', 'now', 'carry', 'very', 'big', 'little', 'limited', 'do', 'something', 'anything', 'might', 'still', 'wish', 'prior', 'getting', 'ticket', 'punched', 'recapture', 'alter', '.This', 'stealth', 'message', 'movie', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'time', ""'ve"", 'got', 'left', 'How', 'often', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'embrace', 'reassure', 'little', 'boy', 'going', 'so', 'much', 'childhood', 'let', 'know', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'went', 'lot', 'years', 'alone', 'not', 'sure', 'things', 'would', 'improve', 'kept', 'trying', ""'d"", 'like', 'let', 'know', 'mature', 'relatively', 'accomplished', 'least', 'pretty', 'much', 'close', 'as', 'accomplished', 'ever', 'going', 'get', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'years', 'later', 'successfully', 'fly', 'banner.The', 'trajectory', 'life', 'brutal', 'filled', 'wrong', 'turns', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'aching', 'regrets', 'pile', 'up', 'rapidly', 'tail', 'end', 'life', 'approach', 'end', 'inherently', 'lonely', 'journey', 'one', 'progressively', 'ever', 'more', 'his/her', 'own', 'things', 'begin', 'conclude', 'see', 'movie', 'basically', 'young', 'people', 'struggling', 'let', 'good', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'find', 'simultaneously', 'distracted', 'calls', 'worst', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'time', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'hold', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'such', 'pressure', 'girls', 'movie', 'seem', 'have', 'stuck', 'together', 'order', 'learn', 'do', 'just', 'that.We', 'see', 'mature', 'women', 'struggling', 'struggles', 'mature', 'women', 'suddenly', 'kind', 'rerunning', 'tapes', 'youth', 'movie', 'find', 'gaining', 'surprizingly', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'core', 'humanity', 'nostalgia', 'process', 'something', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'permit', 'youth', 'then', 'felt', 'would', 'live', 'forever', 'Do', 'buy', 'movie', 'watch', 'generous', 'heart', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'overly', 'frightened', 'existential', 'anxiety', 'anyone', 'undergoing', 'life', 'trajectory.Please', 'forgive', 'schmaltz', 'review', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'tear-jerker', 'masquerading', 'comedy', 'Xmas', 'season', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ill', '94', 'years', 'old', 'mother', 'girlhood', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'fit', 'spirit', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'too', 'many', 'passings', 'key', 'persons', 'life', 'did', 'protagonist', 'movie', 'How', 'wish', 'was', 'still', 'time', 'gather', 'scattered', 'disappeared', 'strands', 'youth', 'was', 'gift', 'SUNNY', 'sort', 'gave', 'members']",N/A

Outside of cuss words, the friendship was like a warm blanket. The leader of the group was likeable and admirable, as well as the strength that came out of the main character. The humor in the story was funny and made the movie fun. We both laughed a lot and then cried too, due to the painful situations. I wanted to recommend the story to more people, but the potty language would probably do more harm than good. The violence was inappropriate, but it was fun to see justice done.
