1114451,AFV2584U13XP3,B000XJD3GQ,,"[0, 0]","The series was a lot more entertaining than a lot of the reviews I've seen previously about it would give,  the series seems a mix of Love Hina and The irresponsible Captain Tylor with a lot more hilarity and well endowed girls than the aforementioned series.  The main character who has the worse luck any one can believe but seems to have a unique knack of catching the eyes of girls now seems to have caught the notice of a group of beautiful inter-planetary  police woman for what purpose is anyone's guess but with this series we pretty much know what.  The series does come in eight dvds and is put into a hard paper dvd case booklet but in all it wasn't that bad a packaging the case is pretty sturdy in my dvds were nicely held in place with no damages to them,  also some have complained about the subtitles to the series but after I and a few friends looked at the series we saw the subtitles were all right with hardly any mistakes put into them as one reviewer has said.  All I can say is that if you buy online from Ebay or from some other unknown or iffy seller you're not sure about or has no legalized proof that they're not selling a bootleg version there's a chance you'll get a bootleg version with wrong or crappy subtitles.  The animation is pretty good with great clarity from the set no distortions or lines to complain about and the soundtrack fits the series perfectly,  the voice cast for the Japanese crew did splendidly and the English voice cast were very good as well and the bonus extras while not the greatest aren't to bad either.  So for anime fans of harem animes, sci-fi animes, or comedy animes here's a pretty decent set to try out for your anime collection library....",5,A Romantic Comedy Sci-Fi Series Worth Getting,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,1707,"['series', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining', 'lot', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previously', 'would', 'give', 'series', 'mix', 'Love', 'Hina', 'irresponsible', 'Captain', 'Tylor', 'lot', 'more', 'hilarity', 'well', 'endowed', 'girls', 'aforementioned', 'series', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'worse', 'luck', 'one', 'can', 'believe', 'have', 'unique', 'knack', 'catching', 'eyes', 'girls', 'now', 'have', 'caught', 'notice', 'group', 'beautiful', 'inter-planetary', 'police', 'woman', 'what', 'purpose', 'anyone', 'guess', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'series', 'come', 'eight', 'dvds', 'put', 'hard', 'paper', 'dvd', 'case', 'booklet', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'packaging', 'case', 'pretty', 'sturdy', 'dvds', 'were', 'nicely', 'held', 'place', 'damages', 'also', 'have', 'complained', 'subtitles', 'series', 'few', 'friends', 'looked', 'series', 'saw', 'subtitles', 'were', 'right', 'hardly', 'mistakes', 'put', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'can', 'say', 'buy', 'Ebay', 'other', 'unknown', 'iffy', 'seller', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'legalized', 'proof', ""'re"", 'not', 'selling', 'bootleg', 'version', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'get', 'bootleg', 'version', 'wrong', 'crappy', 'subtitles', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'great', 'clarity', 'set', 'distortions', 'lines', 'complain', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'perfectly', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'crew', 'did', 'splendidly', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'bonus', 'extras', 'not', 'greatest', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'So', 'anime', 'fans', 'harem', 'animes', 'sci-fi', 'animes', 'comedy', 'animes', 'here', 'pretty', 'decent', 'set', 'try', 'out', 'anime', 'collection', 'library']",Tenchi Muyo GXP

Overall the storylines were ok and the ending was a little strange but hey this is Japanese anime.  The animation seemed to get a better toward the end of the series and others have made that same comment.  Yes, you do get to see Tenchi and the others in the series but they are basically not involved in the plot.  You really have to pay attention to all the Masaki Jurai family information they are supplying you at sporadic moments in each episode which will help when you watch the final season of Tenchi Muyo.

It drops the ball in so many levels of packaging that it's a shame.  First, the whole thing is paper, that's right cardboard paper.  No plastic, just paper with paper sleeves to protect the disk.  That does not work out too well, being out of the box, I got scratches.  There is no plastic to be found on this box set, to protect your DVD investment.  I am giving the show 5 stars, because it's funny and well done.  I would stay clear of this box set thou; I believe that they came out with another set, so buy the other.  This one is not worth the 44 dollars.  Also, 44 Dollars?  I bought this for 29.99 OFF OF AMAZON!!! So why the price jump?  So stay clear of this release, I have it, and it's fine.

Like having more of Tenchi grandmother from Tenchi Roy-oki series  in this series as well as a air head blond that remind me of Mishoshi but not positive if her not as I can can't seem to bring the character up in cast list I looked up on internet.  Was surprise when the main character of the series turn out to be a bad luck magnet guy name Seina since he looks so much like Tenchi himself in the box cover images.  The different Tenchi series always mention Galaxy Police it is nice to have a spin off series giving Tenchi fans what that part of the Tenchi  series is truly like.  I did have one problem with the series.  That being on the first disk when Senia meets his earth girl friend who knew him since childhood it is never explain what she's doing as a member of the galaxy police since before this Mishoshi and Kiyone were the only GP members on Earth. I know with name Masaki she related to Tenchi but there should of been more info given.  Unlike Seina who enters the academy she seems to of been a member for some time.  I was also strange having different pirate Ryoko in this series than the one living with Tenchi  The series has many great characters both human and alien looking and the series have new harem love nest for anyone getting board with Tenchi and the girls on earth.,5,great tenchi cross over,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1436,"['how', 'bad', 'Tenchi', 'Tokyo', 'was', 'was', 'concern', 'future', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'renewed', 'faith', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'having', 'more', 'Tenchi', 'grandmother', 'Tenchi', 'Roy-oki', 'series', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'air', 'head', 'blond', 'remind', 'Mishoshi', 'not', 'positive', 'not', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bring', 'character', 'up', 'cast', 'list', 'looked', 'up', 'internet', 'Was', 'surprise', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'series', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'luck', 'magnet', 'guy', 'name', 'Seina', 'so', 'much', 'Tenchi', 'box', 'cover', 'images', 'different', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'always', 'mention', 'Galaxy', 'Police', 'nice', 'have', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'giving', 'Tenchi', 'fans', 'what', 'part', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'truly', 'like', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'problem', 'series', 'being', 'first', 'disk', 'when', 'Senia', 'earth', 'girl', 'friend', 'who', 'knew', 'childhood', 'never', 'explain', 'what', 'doing', 'member', 'galaxy', 'police', 'Mishoshi', 'Kiyone', 'were', 'only', 'GP', 'members', 'Earth', 'know', 'name', 'Masaki', 'related', 'Tenchi', 'there', 'should', 'been', 'more', 'info', 'given', 'Seina', 'who', 'academy', 'been', 'member', 'time', 'was', 'also', 'strange', 'having', 'different', 'pirate', 'Ryoko', 'series', 'one', 'living', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'many', 'great', 'characters', 'human', 'alien', 'looking', 'series', 'have', 'new', 'harem', 'love', 'nest', 'anyone', 'getting', 'board', 'Tenchi', 'girls', 'earth']",Tenchi Muyo GXP

One day while at Tenchi's house Seina bumps into one of the Galaxy Police and is offered a chance to join, he eventually accepts this offer and begins his training at the Galaxy Police Academy!And yeah overall thats a very loose description, but I don't want to spoil too much, this is deffinantly a Tenchi title you want to watch & enjoy for yourself!  its arguably one of the most enjoyable spin-offs from the franchise so far, and the comedy while more prominent then other Tenchi series actually works to the shows advantage.
