I hadn't seen the third, animated, video.He loves Stuart so much we watch at least one of these several times a week. He is always talking about Stuart.The rest of us enjoy watching Hugh Laurie in a totally different character than House. All of the characters were well chosen, and the Stuart Little movies are great family entertainment.I like that a lot of these movies slip in references that adults can enjoy. As many times as I have now seen all three, I still have fun!",5,We Watch These Videos Almost Daily,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,576,"['originally', 'had', 'first', 'two', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'DVDs', 'got', 'grandson', 'recent', 'birthday', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'third', 'animated', 'video.He', 'loves', 'Stuart', 'so', 'much', 'watch', 'least', 'one', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'always', 'talking', 'Stuart.The', 'rest', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'totally', 'different', 'character', 'House', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'chosen', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment.I', 'lot', 'movies', 'slip', 'references', 'adults', 'can', 'enjoy', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'now', 'seen', 'three', 'still', 'have', 'fun']",Stuart Little Movie Collection
