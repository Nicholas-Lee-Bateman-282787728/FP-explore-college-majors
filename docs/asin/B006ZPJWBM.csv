However, as wonderfully talented he is, he is also a much flawed person as shown by his limited understanding of patriotism, defense of country and the drug problem in the world.  He has since backtracked from his 2011 public comments that 'American military actions in the Middle East brought 9/11 to America ... ', and he remains steadfast in his mistaken belief that all drugs should be legalized.  Perhaps he has an ageist 'right' to exhibit his ignorance by virtue of having reached the grand old age of 85 (this reviewer is 83 years young!), but I'm not so forgiving of someone who exemplifies the old adage that 'there's no fool as an old fool.""
