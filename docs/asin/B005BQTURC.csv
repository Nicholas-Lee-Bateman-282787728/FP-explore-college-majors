1452706,A2Q1IFUIJ8SWJE,B005BQTURC,kiki,"[18, 21]","""Go For It"" is your stereotypical, hip-hop dance movie. I have to admit, however cliche they may be, I tend to love these kinds of movies. However, this one just fell flat for me. Although the plot was the same as any other (girl loves to dance, girl falls for boy, girl has to overcome some huge obstacle to succeed), this movie didn't do it quite as well as others. It wasn't the acting or camerawork that I had a problem with: It was our so-called protagonist.It is rare that you encounter such a pessimistic, annoying, selfish character. She acted superior to everyone in her family, and said terrible, judgmental things to her parents. I thought it hypocritical for her to judge her family for not being educated or successful when clearly she was on the EXACT same path herself. It was almost if she expected to get out of her parents' house and make it big, not by hard work or determination, but simply because she thought that the world owed it to her. She had a family who loved her, and time after time she completely disregarded their feelings because she couldn't be bothered to care.Another issue that I had a problem with was the fact that the audience didn't really understand why her teacher took such an interest in her. She was rude and had a bad attitude. This teacher supported her, encouraged her to be something, and helped her apply into a dance school; all she did was complain and talk about how she didn't have time for this and didn't feel like doing that. (I don't see why not. The audience watched as she quit doing much of anything). She was completely unappreciative of the hard work her teacher put in for her, and was more than prepared to throw away a golden opportunity for NO reason whatsoever.The last issue that I had with this movie was the fact that we got to see her REALLY dance like once. Even when we did get to see her dance, she wasn't that good. However, the teacher was apparently an expert scout for talented dancers, because he was able to deduce that she had talent after seeing her dance for all of 2.5 seconds. By the final dance scene, I'd had enough and was hoping the protagonist would fall and break her ankle or something. She didn't deserve the spot at the dance school. She would have been perfectly content to work at a grocery store for the rest of her miserable life.IN CONCLUSION, if you like self-centered, annoying, hypocritical protagonists that can't dance, I would highly recommend this movie for you. I'm sure someone else will enjoy this movie and be able to overlook things I couldn't ignore. If you're not that someone, I would say skip this one.",2,I wish they HADN'T gone for it!,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,2620,"['Go', 'stereotypical', 'hip-hop', 'dance', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'however', 'cliche', 'may', 'be', 'tend', 'love', 'kinds', 'movies', 'However', 'one', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'plot', 'was', 'same', 'other', 'girl', 'loves', 'dance', 'girl', 'falls', 'boy', 'girl', 'overcome', 'huge', 'obstacle', 'succeed', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'camerawork', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'so-called', 'protagonist.It', 'rare', 'encounter', 'pessimistic', 'annoying', 'selfish', 'character', 'acted', 'superior', 'everyone', 'family', 'said', 'terrible', 'judgmental', 'things', 'parents', 'thought', 'hypocritical', 'judge', 'family', 'not', 'being', 'educated', 'successful', 'when', 'clearly', 'was', 'EXACT', 'same', 'path', 'was', 'almost', 'expected', 'get', 'parents', 'house', 'make', 'big', 'not', 'hard', 'work', 'determination', 'simply', 'thought', 'world', 'owed', 'had', 'family', 'who', 'loved', 'time', 'time', 'completely', 'disregarded', 'feelings', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'care.Another', 'issue', 'had', 'problem', 'was', 'fact', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'teacher', 'took', 'interest', 'was', 'rude', 'had', 'bad', 'attitude', 'teacher', 'supported', 'encouraged', 'be', 'something', 'helped', 'apply', 'dance', 'school', 'did', 'was', 'complain', 'talk', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'doing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'not', 'audience', 'watched', 'quit', 'doing', 'much', 'anything', 'was', 'completely', 'unappreciative', 'hard', 'work', 'teacher', 'put', 'was', 'more', 'prepared', 'throw', 'away', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'NO', 'reason', 'whatsoever.The', 'last', 'issue', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'got', 'see', 'REALLY', 'dance', 'once', 'Even', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'dance', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'However', 'teacher', 'was', 'apparently', 'expert', 'scout', 'talented', 'dancers', 'was', 'able', 'deduce', 'had', 'talent', 'seeing', 'dance', '2.5', 'seconds', 'final', 'dance', 'scene', ""'d"", 'had', 'enough', 'was', 'hoping', 'protagonist', 'would', 'fall', 'break', 'ankle', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'spot', 'dance', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfectly', 'content', 'work', 'grocery', 'store', 'rest', 'miserable', 'life.IN', 'CONCLUSION', 'like', 'self-centered', 'annoying', 'hypocritical', 'protagonists', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'else', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'be', 'able', 'overlook', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'ignore', ""'re"", 'not', 'someone', 'would', 'say', 'skip', 'one']",Go For It!

1452709,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B005BQTURC,S. Der,"[0, 0]","This movie was different than the rest of the dance movies I have seen. This movie doesn't make the dancing important as much as everything else is going on. The dancing is second or even third compared to Carmen's life problems.Carmen is a 19 year college student. She is supposed to have great dancing skills/talent, but the audience doesn't really get to see her dance.  What we do see is her doing a few steps about 3 or 4 times doing that in the whole movie. In her final performance we get to see her dance somewhat, but when we see it she really NOT that good. She just average dancer or even below average. The camera will cut in and out every time she moves 2 steps and slash in a whole the judes faces being amazed!?! Huh?In fact, we know how bad she really is by the judges asks her if she gots what it takes and she didn't say a thing. I'm thinking she doesn't know if she gots what it takes because she doesn't dance that much. We don't know if she gots what it takes because we don't see her dance before all this. So, what she does is not answers the judes and she just starts to dance. Shen she finishes her performance, we don't know what happened after? The movie just ends right there?!? Well, if I was the judge for her performance, I would say NEXT!!! Aww, better luck next time!Now, since Carmen can't dance, the movie was made more about Carmen's life than anything else. We get to see her go to school and get into fights with her teacher and students. We get to see her work at the grocery store. We get to see her fight with her family members everyday. We get to see her workout her problems with her friends and boyfriend. Does she ever dance then? Yup, she does. 2 steps every now and then. Most of the dancing is done by her crew members and other crews. And, when her crew dances, she not even in the battles. She just standing there and just watching her crew dance!This movie left out two important facts for the audience. The first was did Carmen make it into her dance school? Like I said before. The second thing is that Carmen had problems with her boyfriends and it seemed like she broek up because she wanted to go to her dance school in California. Now for some strange reason he just showed up before she did her big audition. I don't know how he even knew she had a big audition that day. I don't know how he even found out the time and place. Also, what does that mean? They are back together now? So, if she doesn't get into the school, they get back together? If she makes it, they stay broken up? We don't know because the movie never told us because the movie just ended at the end of her performance. So many questions, but no answers!I gave it 3 stars because I just like the actress. I've seen her in other tv shows and movies and I think she is beautiful. Otherwise, I would had gave this movie a 1 or 2 stars. I don't recommend this movie unless you like the actress.",3,Different than the rest - maybe too different,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2919,"['movie', 'was', 'different', 'rest', 'dance', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'dancing', 'important', 'as', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'going', 'dancing', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'compared', 'Carmen', 'life', 'problems.Carmen', '19', 'year', 'college', 'student', 'supposed', 'have', 'great', 'dancing', 'skills/talent', 'audience', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'see', 'dance', 'What', 'do', 'see', 'doing', 'few', 'steps', '3', '4', 'times', 'doing', 'whole', 'movie', 'final', 'performance', 'get', 'see', 'dance', 'somewhat', 'when', 'see', 'really', 'NOT', 'good', 'just', 'average', 'dancer', 'even', 'average', 'camera', 'will', 'cut', 'time', '2', 'steps', 'slash', 'whole', 'judes', 'being', 'amazed', 'Huh', 'fact', 'know', 'how', 'bad', 'really', 'judges', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'thing', ""'m"", 'thinking', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""n't"", 'dance', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'dance', 'So', 'what', 'not', 'answers', 'judes', 'just', 'dance', 'Shen', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'just', 'ends', 'right', 'there', 'Well', 'was', 'judge', 'performance', 'would', 'say', 'NEXT', 'Aww', 'better', 'luck', 'next', 'time', 'Now', 'Carmen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'more', 'Carmen', 'life', 'anything', 'else', 'get', 'see', 'go', 'school', 'get', 'fights', 'teacher', 'students', 'get', 'see', 'work', 'grocery', 'store', 'get', 'see', 'fight', 'family', 'members', 'everyday', 'get', 'see', 'problems', 'friends', 'boyfriend', 'ever', 'dance', 'then', 'Yup', '2', 'steps', 'now', 'then', 'Most', 'dancing', 'done', 'crew', 'members', 'other', 'crews', 'when', 'crew', 'dances', 'not', 'even', 'battles', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'just', 'watching', 'crew', 'dance', 'movie', 'left', 'out', 'two', 'important', 'facts', 'audience', 'first', 'was', 'did', 'Carmen', 'make', 'dance', 'school', 'said', 'second', 'thing', 'Carmen', 'had', 'problems', 'boyfriends', 'seemed', 'broek', 'up', 'wanted', 'go', 'dance', 'school', 'California', 'Now', 'strange', 'reason', 'just', 'showed', 'up', 'did', 'big', 'audition', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'even', 'knew', 'had', 'big', 'audition', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'even', 'found', 'time', 'place', 'Also', 'what', 'mean', 'are', 'back', 'together', 'now', 'So', ""n't"", 'get', 'school', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'stay', 'broken', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'never', 'told', 'movie', 'just', 'ended', 'end', 'performance', 'So', 'many', 'questions', 'answers', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'just', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'tv', 'shows', 'movies', 'think', 'beautiful', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'had', 'gave', 'movie', '1', '2', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'actress']",Go For It!
