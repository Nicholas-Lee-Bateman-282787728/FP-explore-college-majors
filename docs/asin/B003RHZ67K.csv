1360937,A2YNCP8VCVREDF,B003RHZ67K,"G. Canna ""Broadway is Life""","[1, 1]","Other reviewers found this movie disappointing, with an ending that made them feel like they wasted their time. Well, they completely missed the point of the film. It's a character study on race relations, meant to make you think. What would you have done had you been in Vaughn or Lena's situation? Would you have been able to see past the fact that the guy/girl you're traveling with is a member of the race that you have either been taught your entire life to hate and despise (Vaughn) or have an almost unconscious prejudice towards (Lena)? To be fair to the bad reviewers, the film is mischaracterized on Amazon as romance. It's not -- it's about two teens having opening their eyes to racial equality (in Lena's case, inequality) for the first time in their lives, and struggling to come to terms with their realizations.If you're thinking of watching this for coming-of-age romantic dreck, then don't. However, if you want to experience a remarkably well-written thought-provoking character study, then by all means watch ""Beneath Clouds"".

I've been spoiled by happy endings I guess. I didn't think it was a love story, at least not a romantic one. I suppose it does have a love your neighbor/do unto others kind of theme. It was slow moving and the actors weren't really all that good, but there is just something so refreshing about it.

1360939,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B003RHZ67K,N. Gregg,"[32, 41]","I think it's important to state right off that this movie script has the f-word in most every sentence/comment.  If that isn't off-putting enough, the movie is also very boring and bleak/depressing - and at the end you realize it was also completely pointless and that ""love story"" ain't happening.A waste of film - a waste of time.FULL STORY (if you really want it):The movie begins with Lena - a young white girl from a LOW income home - on her way home (from school?)  Her and her girlfriend are sitting at a bus stop where the girlfriend tells her she is pregnant. Lena tells her she'll never get out of this s-hole then. As Lena continues to wait, her younger brother and a friend ride up on bicycles, smoking cigarettes. A police car goes by and the boys ride off -- Lena arrives at home to see a police car with her brothers friend in back, the brother being loaded into it and the 2nd officer coming out of the house with an armful of cigarette cartons the boys had evidently stole.  She goes inside and her mom is at the kitchen table with empty beer bottles on it and the mom drinking from another.  Her husband (or boyfriend?) in the living-room watching tv.  She looks at her mom who says something to the effect that she needed a break from him anyways. They argue a bit. Lena goes to her room looks at a scrapbook of photos of her father and the next morning she sets off to find him, with only a vague idea he might be in Sydney.Next you meet Vaughn - a gang kid in what appears to be a youth prison work camp area. He is clearly full of hate for whites and has plenty of will to fight. His sister arrives to visit (probably the first time he's had a visitor in the 2-yrs he's been there) to tell him his mother (who had abandoned him when he was younger) is very sick and won't live much longer. He breaks out and finds himself at a bus stop -- where Lena (the only other person around) is because she just missed her bus due to being sick in the bathroom and getting out just in time to see her bus drive off without her back on it.Vaughn asks her which way to Sydney and she points, and he takes off walking in that direction. For whatever reason she decides to take a risk and follows him (since that's the direction she needs to go in as well and has nothing but some change in her pocket).The rest of the movie is them walking towards Sydney - hitchhiking when they can.  Not a lot of talking but a small bond of trust happens when Vaughn saves Lena as 2 men attempt to pull her into their car and drive off with her.  Eventually they share a little about themselves as they continue.As they walk, some gang friends of his drive by and pick them up. The car gets pulled over, 4 strapping youths vs 2 cops, they fight and drive off leaving cops in the road (who will surely be in pursuit again in a moment).  The friends drop him & Lena at his mom's and speed off.The house is a low income sty, and nobody is home. On the bed is an oxygen tank and a large stain of blood (like it was vomited up) and bits of lung??  He's too late.  Lena puts her hand on his shoulder in attempt of comfort and he tells her to leave. After having a few moments of anger alone he hears a police siren and runs out.  He catches up with her as she's about to get on what looks like an above-ground subway type system.  They tentatively hug for a moment, she gets on, he does not.  End of movie.This was a POINTLESS WASTE OF TIME. I'm sorry I wasted my time on it, but hopefully I have saved you from doing the same.",2,"A POINTLESS WASTE OF TIME - and ""f__k"" said e/o word",1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,3514,"['think', 'important', 'state', 'right', 'off', 'movie', 'script', 'f-word', 'most', 'sentence/comment', ""n't"", 'off-putting', 'enough', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'boring', 'bleak/depressing', 'end', 'realize', 'was', 'also', 'completely', 'pointless', 'love', 'story', 'ai', ""n't"", 'happening.A', 'waste', 'film', 'waste', 'time.FULL', 'STORY', 'really', 'want', 'movie', 'Lena', 'young', 'white', 'girl', 'LOW', 'income', 'home', 'way', 'home', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'sitting', 'bus', 'stop', 'where', 'girlfriend', 'pregnant', 'Lena', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 's-hole', 'then', 'Lena', 'wait', 'younger', 'brother', 'friend', 'ride', 'up', 'bicycles', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'police', 'car', 'boys', 'ride', 'off', 'Lena', 'home', 'see', 'police', 'car', 'brothers', 'friend', 'back', 'brother', 'being', 'loaded', '2nd', 'officer', 'coming', 'house', 'armful', 'cigarette', 'cartons', 'boys', 'had', 'evidently', 'stole', 'inside', 'mom', 'kitchen', 'table', 'empty', 'beer', 'bottles', 'mom', 'drinking', 'husband', 'boyfriend', 'living-room', 'watching', 'tv', 'mom', 'who', 'something', 'effect', 'needed', 'break', 'anyways', 'argue', 'bit', 'Lena', 'room', 'scrapbook', 'photos', 'father', 'next', 'morning', 'find', 'only', 'vague', 'idea', 'might', 'be', 'Sydney.Next', 'meet', 'Vaughn', 'gang', 'kid', 'what', 'be', 'youth', 'prison', 'work', 'camp', 'area', 'clearly', 'full', 'hate', 'whites', 'plenty', 'will', 'fight', 'sister', 'visit', 'probably', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'visitor', '2-yrs', 'been', 'there', 'tell', 'mother', 'who', 'had', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'very', 'sick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'live', 'much', 'longer', 'out', 'bus', 'stop', 'where', 'Lena', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'just', 'missed', 'bus', 'due', 'being', 'sick', 'bathroom', 'getting', 'out', 'just', 'time', 'see', 'bus', 'drive', 'back', 'it.Vaughn', 'way', 'Sydney', 'points', 'off', 'walking', 'direction', 'reason', 'take', 'risk', 'direction', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'nothing', 'change', 'pocket', 'rest', 'movie', 'walking', 'towards', 'Sydney', 'hitchhiking', 'when', 'can', 'Not', 'lot', 'talking', 'small', 'bond', 'trust', 'happens', 'when', 'Vaughn', 'Lena', '2', 'men', 'attempt', 'pull', 'car', 'drive', 'off', 'Eventually', 'share', 'little', 'about', 'continue.As', 'walk', 'gang', 'friends', 'drive', 'pick', 'up', 'car', 'pulled', '4', 'strapping', 'youths', 'vs', '2', 'cops', 'fight', 'drive', 'off', 'leaving', 'cops', 'road', 'who', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'pursuit', 'again', 'moment', 'friends', 'drop', 'Lena', 'mom', 'speed', 'off.The', 'house', 'low', 'income', 'sty', 'nobody', 'home', 'bed', 'oxygen', 'tank', 'large', 'stain', 'blood', 'was', 'vomited', 'up', 'bits', 'lung', 'too', 'late', 'Lena', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'attempt', 'comfort', 'leave', 'having', 'few', 'moments', 'anger', 'alone', 'police', 'siren', 'out', 'up', 'about', 'get', 'above-ground', 'subway', 'type', 'system', 'tentatively', 'hug', 'moment', 'not', 'End', 'movie.This', 'was', 'POINTLESS', 'WASTE', 'OF', 'TIME', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'wasted', 'time', 'hopefully', 'have', 'saved', 'doing', 'same']",Beneath Clouds
