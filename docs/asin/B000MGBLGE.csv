This is a great hip hop routine that Jamie breaks down in half-time a few times and then does each segment full tempo.  Then he adds on each move at half tempo, to full tempo and then ""connects the dots"" as he puts it, adding each segment together til you get the full dance.  It's a great workout and if you like hip hop, this one's for you.  I'm 66 and if I can do it, so can you!",5,This is Great!,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,472,"['just', 'found', 'shelf', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'tonight', 'WOW', 'great', 'hip', 'hop', 'routine', 'Jamie', 'breaks', 'down', 'half-time', 'few', 'times', 'then', 'segment', 'full', 'tempo', 'Then', 'move', 'half', 'tempo', 'full', 'tempo', 'then', 'dots', 'adding', 'segment', 'together', 'til', 'get', 'full', 'dance', 'great', 'workout', 'like', 'hip', 'hop', 'one', ""'m"", '66', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'can']",Jamie King- Rock Your Body
1046043,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B000MGBLGE,Colleen M. Schneider,"[0, 0]","I work out seven days a week doing a variety of workouts but dance videos are my favorites.  I do find though that after I master a dvd that sometimes I get bored quickly, so I tend to like ones that are challenging that I might not perfect after a couple tries.  This one fit the bill.  I have done it about 3 times now and I still have to work on the moves to do them as quickly as he does, and it will be quite a while until I feel like I have any kind of polish to the moves.  For me, this is fun and I like to be challenged.  Now, saying that, I would say this is not for everyone.  If you have had some dance training that is helpful.  None of the moves are overly complex, but the challenge comes in doing them up to tempo, which is fast.  I often have the moves when they are done slowly, but once they speed up I get that deer in the headlight look, so it takes a lot of concentration in order to do the moves at the quick pace, and as a teen I did take dance so I am used to doing a routine and learning quickly.There is a section that helps you with two of the more complex moves, but it is still a short intro.I would say if you don't like minimal instruction and feel like you have two left feet, this one won't be for you-too frustrating and may take longer than you would like to learn the moves.  If you love dance, have some background, natural talent or are super patient, then give it a go.  Jamie is fun, upbeat and cues well.Overall, I really like this one, but it will be a while before I can do all the moves fast and look good doing them, but that is all in the fun of it.",5,fast & fun....,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1596,"['work', 'out', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'doing', 'variety', 'workouts', 'dance', 'videos', 'are', 'favorites', 'do', 'find', 'master', 'dvd', 'get', 'bored', 'quickly', 'tend', 'like', 'ones', 'are', 'challenging', 'might', 'not', 'perfect', 'couple', 'tries', 'one', 'fit', 'bill', 'have', 'done', '3', 'times', 'now', 'still', 'have', 'work', 'moves', 'do', 'as', 'quickly', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'while', 'feel', 'have', 'kind', 'polish', 'moves', 'fun', 'like', 'be', 'challenged', 'Now', 'saying', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'everyone', 'have', 'had', 'dance', 'training', 'helpful', 'None', 'moves', 'are', 'overly', 'complex', 'challenge', 'doing', 'tempo', 'fast', 'often', 'have', 'moves', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'slowly', 'once', 'speed', 'up', 'get', 'deer', 'headlight', 'look', 'lot', 'concentration', 'order', 'do', 'moves', 'quick', 'pace', 'teen', 'did', 'take', 'dance', 'so', 'am', 'used', 'doing', 'routine', 'learning', 'quickly.There', 'section', 'two', 'more', 'complex', 'moves', 'still', 'short', 'intro.I', 'would', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'minimal', 'instruction', 'feel', 'have', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'you-too', 'frustrating', 'may', 'take', 'longer', 'would', 'like', 'learn', 'moves', 'love', 'dance', 'have', 'background', 'natural', 'talent', 'are', 'super', 'patient', 'then', 'give', 'go', 'Jamie', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'cues', 'well.Overall', 'really', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'while', 'can', 'do', 'moves', 'fast', 'look', 'good', 'doing', 'fun']",Jamie King- Rock Your Body
1046044,A11X1W2VW6WHPK,B000MGBLGE,Georgia C.,"[0, 0]","I am a HUGE fan of the Nike workouts that Jamie King choreographed a few years ago, so I was extremely pleased to see that he has his own DVD now. I had a blast doing this workout - it's about an hour and you really do not notice it. I was sweating and I have been running, even.The main complaint it seems around here is that Jamie goes a bit fast. I think that if you really concentrate, you will find that it's not THAT complicated (most of the time) and you do have a lot of repetition of the moves when you combine different parts of the routine after you learn each new part. I am not accusing anyone of being a fool, but it's just that when I work out I like to space out a little, and you cannot do that here. For one thing, you could hurt yourself, but you would also just miss out on how much fun it is. For certain notably complicated moves, Jamie has the option of watching a special section on the DVD that lets you learn it separately from the rest of the routine, which would solve a number of the concerns about speed.I have no objections towards music or the dancers.

1046045,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B000MGBLGE,Leanne,"[85, 85]","I bought this DVD after reading that it was Shape magazine's DVD of the month, and I just finished my second time doing it.  Overall, it's a great workout that is a lot of fun!Jamie King leads the workout, and he is accompanied by four back-up dancers.  Jaime has a lot of energy, and makes the workout fly by, which is always nice. The workout is broken down into six main sections:  a warm-up, rehearsal 1, rehearsal 2, dress rehearsal (where you put the two sections together slowly), the performance (where you put the two sections together more quickly in front of an ""audience""), and a cool down.In each of the two rehearsal sections, Jamie breaks down the choreography and makes it very esay to follow.  If you can't get a move, though, a great feature of the DVD is that in several places you can click on a sub-menu and go to the bonus section where Jamie breaks down the move even more slowly.One of the things that makes this workout so unique is that the workout is done on a stage with a DJ playing music.  During the dress rehearsal and performance sections, the dancers and Jamie also change into ""costumes"" and even do the routine in front of a live audience.  It really feels like you're a rock star while doing these sections of the workout!The DVD also has a bonus strength section and a section where Jamie breaks down the moves in more detail.  The first time I did this workout, I couldn't quite keep up with the nuances of the moves, but I can see progress and I can also see that I won't be bored with this DVD in the future.The last thing I wanted to say is that I was pleasantly surprised about how this workout got my heart rate up.  It's true that there are much harder cardio dance workouts out there, but I was definitely breaking a sweat -- and having fun while doing it!  Overall, it's a fun, very unique workout!",5,"Fun, fun, fun!",1179792000,"05 22, 2007",2007,1845,"['bought', 'DVD', 'reading', 'was', 'Shape', 'magazine', 'DVD', 'month', 'just', 'finished', 'second', 'time', 'doing', 'Overall', 'great', 'workout', 'lot', 'fun', 'Jamie', 'King', 'workout', 'accompanied', 'four', 'back-up', 'dancers', 'Jaime', 'lot', 'energy', 'workout', 'fly', 'always', 'nice', 'workout', 'broken', 'down', 'six', 'main', 'sections', 'warm-up', 'rehearsal', '1', 'rehearsal', '2', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'where', 'put', 'two', 'sections', 'together', 'slowly', 'performance', 'where', 'put', 'two', 'sections', 'together', 'more', 'quickly', 'front', 'audience', 'cool', 'down.In', 'two', 'rehearsal', 'sections', 'Jamie', 'down', 'choreography', 'very', 'esay', 'follow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'move', 'though', 'great', 'feature', 'DVD', 'several', 'places', 'can', 'click', 'sub-menu', 'go', 'bonus', 'section', 'where', 'Jamie', 'down', 'move', 'even', 'more', 'slowly.One', 'things', 'workout', 'so', 'unique', 'workout', 'done', 'stage', 'DJ', 'playing', 'music', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'performance', 'sections', 'dancers', 'Jamie', 'also', 'change', 'costumes', 'even', 'do', 'routine', 'front', 'live', 'audience', 'really', ""'re"", 'rock', 'star', 'doing', 'sections', 'workout', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'strength', 'section', 'section', 'where', 'Jamie', 'down', 'moves', 'more', 'detail', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'workout', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'keep', 'up', 'nuances', 'moves', 'can', 'see', 'progress', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bored', 'DVD', 'future.The', 'last', 'thing', 'wanted', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'workout', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'true', 'are', 'much', 'harder', 'cardio', 'dance', 'there', 'was', 'definitely', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'having', 'fun', 'doing', 'Overall', 'fun', 'very', 'unique', 'workout']",Jamie King- Rock Your Body

I liked this workout a lot, and I usually find most cardio hip-hop DVDs lame. It's ""organised"" like a dance class, with phrases learned at half-time then tempo, a dress rehearsal where you put it all together and then a performance where you run the whole thing through a few times. The choreography is cool, and once you know it you can put a lot more energy into it and have a fun workout. Sometimes they counted off the beat, but it's easy to ignore that if you can count. This isn't high-intensity like a Les Mills dance class, but for a day where you want a steady-state burn, this is a fun workout to try.
