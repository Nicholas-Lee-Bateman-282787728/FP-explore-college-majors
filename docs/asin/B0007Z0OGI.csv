In this made for TV movie, Ann-Margret plays Tula, an aging woman, who may be losing her eyesight...and her home.  Eight years a widow, Tula is reluctant to visit an eye specialist for surgery that might prevent her blindness.  She lives reclusively, and doesn't have room in her heart for anyone, not even the doctor who has his own special interest in her.  Her late husband's nephew and niece are conspiring to have Tula put in a nursing home so they can buy her property and turn it into a swank resort.  Tula's only visitor of late has been a young social worker who is doing an evaluation to determine her aptitude in living by herself.  Into her life comes a handsome young drifter and his precocious little daughter.  Tula takes them in as a handyman and offers them her guest house to live in.  This new influence in her life brings about a change in Tula, and this is where the movie's dramatic core rises.Ms. Margret is wonderful in this role, underplaying Tula beautifully, going from a rather dowdy old maid to a fine looking mature woman who fights for her home and for her new friends.  Gary Sandy is very good as the doctor who wants her to share life with him; Matthew Settle and Shanelle Woodley are fine as the fly by night dad and his fearful little girl; Hunter Tylo and Sean O'Bryan ooze smarmy greed as the vulture like relatives.A PLACE CALLED HOME is entertaining family fare and is an uplifting look at love and the human spirit.",5,A GLOWING MS.
