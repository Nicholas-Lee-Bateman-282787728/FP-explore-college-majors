From my presective, what I have learned...there is a lot things you can say. Why do you have to cuss? It really is not cute or funny at all. Do you notice a person saying the similar bad word over again? It is because he doesn't know what to say. Also he trying be funny. Rolling eye...

1469285,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIH86,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I'm torn with this film simply because I found it really, really funny and yet absolutely predictable, nothing new or special and somewhat forgettable.  When all was said and done, I forgot about this one rather quickly and yet I can't help but admit that I was thoroughly entertained while watching it.  The humor is high, even if the scenarios are ridiculously formulaic (you can guess every pairing and every outcome a mile away).Kevin Hart is the star of this show.  His brand of funny is effective in every frame here.  He lands every joke and plays up his part very well.  Sure, he's a stereotype (seriously, he's the token black guy in a black film) but it works.  He anchors the film, giving it a central force while the rest splinters all over the place.Not sure if the film makes a point other than that Steve Harvey's book doesn't really work.  I mean, you have the women and the men using it and then being offended that it was used and then falling in love on their own rights.  Still, there is some really funny dialog here, and the cast as a whole understands how to make this material work.  It reminded me a bit, in the staging, of `What to Expect When You're Expecting', except this one was actually funny (that movie was terrible).  So, if you want a familiar film with new laughs, check this one out.  I don't quite understand the influx of five-star reviews here (it's not THAT funny), but I can't say that I dislike this one.",3,Think for yourself...,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,1447,"[""'m"", 'torn', 'film', 'simply', 'found', 'really', 'really', 'funny', 'yet', 'absolutely', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'new', 'special', 'somewhat', 'forgettable', 'When', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'forgot', 'one', 'rather', 'quickly', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admit', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'watching', 'humor', 'high', 'even', 'scenarios', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'formulaic', 'can', 'guess', 'pairing', 'outcome', 'mile', 'away', '.Kevin', 'Hart', 'star', 'show', 'brand', 'funny', 'effective', 'frame', 'here', 'joke', 'up', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'Sure', 'stereotype', 'seriously', 'token', 'black', 'guy', 'black', 'film', 'film', 'giving', 'central', 'force', 'rest', 'splinters', 'place.Not', 'sure', 'film', 'point', 'other', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'book', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'mean', 'have', 'women', 'men', 'using', 'then', 'being', 'offended', 'was', 'used', 'then', 'falling', 'love', 'own', 'rights', 'Still', 'really', 'funny', 'dialog', 'here', 'cast', 'whole', 'how', 'make', 'material', 'work', 'reminded', 'bit', 'staging', 'What', 'Expect', 'When', ""'re"", 'Expecting', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'So', 'want', 'familiar', 'film', 'new', 'laughs', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'influx', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'here', 'not', 'THAT', 'funny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'dislike', 'one']",Think Like a Man

1469312,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005LAIH86,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 2009, comedian and game show host Steve Harvey wrote a book titled ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man"".  A number one New York Times bestseller, Harvey's book gave millions of women insight on how a man really thinks about love, intimacy and commitment.And for many men, the fact that their ""game"" was exposed to women, how would a man react and deal with it?Suffice to say, the ""what if?"" would eventually inspire writers Keith Marryman and David A. Newman (both wrote the Justin Timberlake/Mila Kunis 2011 film ""Friends with Benefits"") to write the 2012 romantic comedy, ""Think Like a Man"", directed by Tim Story (""Fantastic Four"" films and ""Barbershop"").The film which was budgeted at $12 million, would go on to earn $95 million in the box office (ending ""The Hunger Games"" four-week run at #1).VIDEO:""Think Like a Man"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1).  Picture quality is well-lit and the clarity is very good.  Skintones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and the lighting was well done.  I didn't notice any banding issues or see any use of excessive DNR while watching the film.  Closeups to overall detail was very good and the HD presentation of ""Think Like a Man"" was excellent!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Think Like a Man"" is presented with an English 5.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack.  Also, an English-Audio Descriptive Track, French, Spanish, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For a romantic comedy, the film is primarily a dialogue, front and center-channel driven soundtrack.  Dialogue is crystal clear and the music for the film is also well utilized for the surround channels. I heard no issues with the soundtrack during my viewing of the film.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese, Indonesian/Bahasa, Korean and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES""Think Like a Man"" comes with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (6:32) Featuring six deleted scenes total.Gag Reel - (5:58) Outtakes from ""Think Like a Man"".The Guy Code - (6:41) Producer Will Packer, director Tim Story and the cast talk about the film and its premise.Men vs. Women - (11:28) Director Tim Story talks about the casting of the men and women for the film.He Said, She Said - (5:20) The cast talk about the different interpretations between a man and a woman when it comes to dating and relationships.Comedy Behind the Scenes - (6:49) Director Tim Story talk about the cast and those who make people laugh in the film and on the set of ""Think Like a Man"".JUDGMENT CALL:I have a lot of single friends and I don't know many times we sit and discuss the mindset of women.  And in some cases, I know a good number of guys who rely on the teachings of books on how to get the women they want or how they can have an active social life with women.""Think Like a Man"" is quite interesting because the women are the ones who have dated or have had relationships with bad men, and they just want to find a good man to love and a man who can return that love right back.  So, they turn to Steve Harvey's popular book ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man"" to understand how a man thinks.And the men who have their game all set, are shocked to see how the women they are with, become more of a challenge to them, because they are not getting the easy sex that they want.Featuring an ensemble cast, each of the male characters are guys that many men can relate to.  From one who is a non-commiter but just wants to be in a longtime relationship, the player, the mama's boy and the one who is literally searching for himself by pursing a different career path.The storyline of ""Think Like a Man"" will surely be interesting to men who have been in the position of these guys who are looking to have fun with women.  But what happens when the women use Steve Harvey's book to the point of making sure these men don't get off that easy and have to prove their love to get anywhere.And what happens when the women see things turning for them for a positive but the men catch on that they are reading Steve Harvey's book and try to turn things around?It's a romantic comedy featuring an ensemble cast that showcases a ""Battle of the Sexes"" type of storyline, as men vs. women is the primary premise of this film.  But who will be making the changes necessary to find love?  The men or the women?The film is quite entertaining and comedian Kevin Hart is crazy as ever!  It made me wonder how much of the film was actually improvised because a lot of the dialogue was off-the-cuff and that is where Kevin Hart is in his element, when he gets to go all out and be crazy.But the casting for this film was well-done and each talent were able to portray the characters magnificently.  The chemistry in this film worked and for the most part, ""Think Like a Man"" is a popcorn romantic comedy that is just hilarious and fun because of the predicaments that the characters find themselves in.While a little long in duration, there were a good number of additional scenes that could have been cut but personally, I'm glad that Tim Story kept them in.  From the guys playing basketball against LA Lakers Metta World Peace and former LA Sparks player Lisa Leslie was hilarious!  You also get cameos by La La Anthony, Wendy Williams, Sherri Shepherd and also music star Chris Brown.  And of course, you have to showcase the man who's book inspired the film, Steve Harvey!As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality was fantastic and for lossless audio, for a romantic comedy, it's primarily dialogue and music-driven but it fits the film just right and both music and dialogue are crystal clear!  There are also a good number of special features included but would have loved to have heard an audio commentary with the cast.  That would have been crazy but fun at the same time!Overall, ""Think Like a Man"" is about relationship angst, the constant discussion of what a man and woman thinks and for those trying to get into a relationship, hope that one day you will find true love!  A hilarious romantic comedy that is just a lot of fun!  So, if you looking for a comedy to make you laugh but also a story that pokes fun at the dating scene, then definitely give ""Think Like a Man"" a chance!",4,(3.5 stars) If you looking for a comedy to make you laugh but also a story that pokes fun at the dating scene...,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,6164,"['2009', 'comedian', 'game', 'show', 'host', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'wrote', 'book', 'titled',

1469325,A2OKCS5234ZV7S,B005LAIH86,Flower,"[1, 1]","I treated myself to some me time and went to see this movie alone when it was showing in the theaters. Once on DVD I made the purchase for our movie library and we watched over and over. We (my husband and I) are still watching and this is going to make a great movie around the holidays.I love the truth about the mamma boy as many men still seek the attention and approval of their mothers and these type of men are hard to be with in relationships because they put their mothers first and don't seem to understand that their wife comes first. I like this part of the movie because it shows how even though men do this, their mothers have gone on with their lives and will continue to live even though the man is missing out on his wife, because he is so concerned about the cares of his mother and seeking her attention instead of seeking his wife. (remember the apples does not fall to far from the tree, even if it is mother/son). This type of relationship is unhealthy and has boundary issue. (remember when you marry you do marry the family, the myth that you don't is wrong).Other parts of the movie were great as well.. all parts of the movie will make you laugh, bring joy and make you think. This is at best a fun movie that will teach you some good lessons, and confirm a lot of things you may have been thinking.I like how it shows the different type's of men and their mindsets.. Most men say it gives all of their secrets away. Many older women that I have talked to about the movie have told me, been there did that and there is nothing new the movie can teach them because they have lived this and know many of the games men play.As for me, it was just great entertainment and pure fun to see this played out on the big screen. This movie will not disappoint even if you do know all of the games men play..Women should set standards and not lower their standards. As it is a man comes in knowing what he wants and what he is willing and going to do. He already knows what his intentions are. So I am glad this movie was made, because it will at least make women think and get them to think about standards, respect, and wanting more for them selves than to let just anyone walk over them. Women do deserve better treatment than the songs, and media give them.There may not be a perfect man, but at least you can be in a relationship and have your standards set and met.This movie shows you how men do sit around and talk about women, and what some minds sets are and how they choose you. This is a wake up call that puts a fun spin on relationships.I also love how the married man takes responsibility for his hanging out with the fellows and the responsibility he has to his family.. Many men don't do this and think that work, friends, mother, sister, brother come before his household (wife children). This was a great point in the movie to show how some men do know what their priority really is. Face it ""honor begins at home"" (Courageous movie).And men need to understand that they have to honor their household before anything and anyone else. This character shows that.To me Kevin Hart was not over the top like some have said... Men do cry and men do cry in the dark (check out the play men cry in the dark). Men have emotions as well, and many don't want to separate from their wives but will not admit to the truth and will act strong around their friends and blood family members, and even co workers.  So to me he played this part well and showed the truth to this issue.I love Gabrielle Union's role and part in this movie with the exception of the illicit substance. Great clean up role for her. This will help her to change her image as I like to see her in positive role and not the ones that show her taking other people's man. This will also show African American women the other options they have.It was nice to see some different actors (Kelly Rowland) and many others. And to see some of the same.. good mix of actors. And all of them played their role well.The book and movie are both great. This is pure fun sit back and relax and enjoy. You will learn some things, but still treat your relationship with real life and know that your spouse is human, this is just comedy.Other great movies to view along with this one: Undertaking Betty, Marriage Chronicles, She Devil, What My Husband Doesn't Know (play with Michelle Williams, Brian White),  Derailed with Clive Owens Jennifer Aniston, A Good man is hard to find,  Unfaithful with Richard Gere, What goes around comes around (play by David E Talbert, Cheaper to keep her (the play with Brian McKnight), Love me or Leave me (the play) War of the roses, and Everyday Black Man.Also the movie What Men Think (with Erica Giles, Bj Williams, Adam Rennie, and Natasha Noreiga) is really a great movie. If you watch noting else from the movie list above, watch this movie and Marriage Chronicles. Then work in the other movies from the above list. You will not be disappointed with Think like a man or any movies that I have listed.Other great books to read along with this movie and the book that goes with this movie are as follows:Black Pain: It Just Looks Like We're Not HurtingTerrie WilliamsLiving Well, Despite Catching Hell: The Black Woman's Guide to Health, Sex and HappinessMelody T. McCloud M.DWhy Black Men Love White Women: Going Beyond Sexual Politics to the Heart of the MatterRajen Persaud, Karen HunterHow to Love a Black ManRonn Elmore and How to Love a Black Woman by the same authorIs Marriage for White People?: How the African American Marriage Decline Affects EveryoneRalph Richard BanksThis movie and the above movies and books will make a great additions to your movie and book library!

Advertised like a Chick Flick, I was delighted to hear the most uproarious laughter was coming from the many men in the audience. This predictable, crowd-pleasing comedy is based on thrice-married Steve Harvey's best-selling book ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What Men Really Think About Love, Relationships, Intimacy and Commitment.""After scenes which establish five male stereotypes: Dreamer, Player, Commitment Phobe, Mama's Boy, and Divorc&eacute;, we then meet their female counterparts: Career Woman, Twice-burned Single, Wanna-be Wife, Single Mom, and Divorc&eacute;e. These women discover Mr. Harvey's best seller which gives them insight into how men think. They quickly modify their behavior, which enables them to ensnare their guys. This works fine until the men tumble to the scheme and decide to fight fire with fire.You should recognize many of these names:* Steve Harvey (""Madea Goes to Jail"") plays himself, a successful self-help author.* Michael Ealy (""For Colored Girls"") is an oft-employed dreamer. He's between jobs right now...* Taraji P. Henson (""Larry Crowne"") is the career woman. She wants a r&eacute;sum&eacute; along with long-term goals from any prospective date.* Romany Malco (""A Little Bit of Heaven"") is a smooth operator. It's fun to watch this guy in action.* Meagan Good (""Jumping the Broom"") is ready to try the ninety- day trial period...IF she can last that long!* Jerry Ferrera (""Entourage"") is an overgrown boy. Why give up that old couch and those video games when he has such a nice woman to support him?* Gabrielle Union (""Good Deeds"") has lived with her guy for years; she really wants to get married.* Terrence Jenkins (""Burlesque"") knows his mother will look out for him. She makes sure he doesn't date anyone who might not measure up to HER standards.* Regina Hall (""Death at a Funeral"") already has ONE boy to raise, she doesn't need a second one.* Kevin Hart (""Exit Strategy"") is the divorc&eacute;. He knows three rings: An engagement ring, a wedding ring, and suffer ring.* Wendy Williams (lots of TV) has all three of those rings (see above).Attractive stars, an intriguing premise and a funny script make for a rollicking PG-13 skirmish in the battle of the sexes.

Steve Harvey's logic misses in some places, but, even if it was some renowned Joe Blow, only the movie and book are important! It's like a better version of Two Can Play That Game and without the religious baggage of that said movie. So, it's better all around. It's a twisted romance flick where every character's romantic life matters a lot and adds value to the movie! There are couples with issues of doing the relationship thing again after divorce(which I don't agree with except for infidelity), a couple with commitment phobe issues, couples where guys don't routinely measure up(financially & dating wisely due to constantly getting the wrong guy), a happily married couple(where the woman isn't revealed), and a relationship where there is this almost unbelievable momma's boy & his momma complicating his relationship(s). Basically, Steve Harvey's book is a popular book among women and a lot of women in this social climate have it or have access to it. At least all of the unmarried couple's women use the book like kids with chocolate; this type of thing can happen rather quickly these days. Anyway, the women apply this book to their very real romance. Eventually, the guys discover what's going on. When they do, they secretly pact together and flip the script--hoping to easily make their relationships smooth(having all the answers to the test). Again, the women figure out what's going on by accident. They break it off, seeing what they are doing as classless and deceitful. They eventually work things out. That's the template, but the movie is more complex than that--as all things don't apply to all couples. Most of the guys are buddies, but the women either section off as friends or are acquaintances. There are not any lessons to be learned, bc how can anyone learn a lesson in a story where people take most of there romantic advice from a love doctor and his book?! But it gets a high rating bc all the work in this kind of soap operatic funneling to add the story and it's far more twisted than any other dating flick; plus, the powers that be really tried hard to please. Like a soap opera, not all characters are connected directly or indirectly. That's real life; many films with a lot of characters don't get this. Problems: Too much unnecessary bad language(over the top usage) esp. from Hart. Everyone ended up too true to form; they should have switched it up or at least changed the timing of everything. People are random and things don't work out that way. They could have still made it good by making sure everyone found happiness(in order to appease romance fans). This movie also has characters known as popular: G. Union, K. Hart, M. Good, and Good's friend looks a lot like Carmelo Anthony's wife; can't confirm anything, though. 4 out of 5.",4,More Lasting Than He Can Play That Game,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,3006,"['When', 'movie', 'neighborhood', '2', 'hrs', 'long', 'usually', 'something', 'say', 'Enemy', 'State', 'Titanic', '21', 'Good', 'Fellas', 'Casino', 'Dark', 'Blue', 'Harlem', 'Nights', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'etc', 'one', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'logic', 'misses', 'places', 'even', 'was', 'renowned', 'Joe', 'Blow', 'only', 'movie', 'book', 'are', 'important', 'better', 'version', 'Two', 'Can', 'Play', 'Game', 'religious', 'baggage', 'said', 'movie', 'So', 'better', 'twisted', 'romance', 'flick', 'where', 'character', 'romantic', 'life', 'matters', 'lot', 'value', 'movie', 'are', 'couples', 'issues', 'doing', 'relationship', 'thing', 'again', 'divorce', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'except', 'infidelity', 'couple', 'commitment', 'phobe', 'issues', 'couples', 'where', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'routinely', 'measure', 'up', 'financially', 'dating', 'wisely', 'due', 'constantly', 'getting', 'wrong', 'guy', 'happily', 'married', 'couple', 'where', 'woman', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'relationship', 'where', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'momma', 'boy', 'momma', 'complicating', 'relationship', 's', 'Basically', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'book', 'popular', 'book', 'women', 'lot', 'women', 'social', 'climate', 'have', 'have', 'access', 'least', 'unmarried', 'couple', 'women', 'use', 'book', 'kids', 'chocolate', 'type', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'rather', 'quickly', 'days', 'Anyway', 'women', 'apply', 'book', 'very', 'real', 'romance', 'Eventually', 'guys', 'discover', 'what', 'going', 'When', 'do', 'secretly', 'pact', 'together', 'flip', 'script', 'hoping', 'easily', 'make', 'relationships', 'having', 'answers', 'test', 'Again', 'women', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'accident', 'break', 'off', 'seeing', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'classless', 'deceitful', 'eventually', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'template', 'movie', 'more', 'complex', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'apply', 'couples', 'Most', 'guys', 'are', 'buddies', 'women', 'section', 'off', 'friends', 'are', 'acquaintances', 'are', 'not', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'bc', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'learn', 'lesson', 'story', 'where', 'people', 'take', 'most', 'romantic', 'advice', 'love', 'doctor', 'book', 'high', 'rating', 'work', 'kind', 'soap', 'operatic', 'funneling', 'add', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'twisted', 'other', 'dating', 'flick', 'powers', 'be', 'really', 'tried', 'hard', 'please', 'soap', 'opera', 'not', 'characters', 'are', 'connected', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'real', 'life', 'many', 'films', 'lot', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Problems', 'Too', 'much', 'unnecessary', 'bad', 'language', 'top', 'usage', 'esp', 'Hart', 'Everyone', 'ended', 'up', 'too', 'true', 'form', 'should', 'have', 'switched', 'up', 'least', 'changed', 'timing', 'everything', 'People', 'are', 'random', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'still', 'made', 'good', 'making', 'sure', 'everyone', 'found', 'happiness', 'order', 'appease', 'romance', 'fans', 'movie', 'also', 'characters', 'known', 'popular', 'G.', 'Union', 'K.', 'Hart', 'M.', 'Good', 'Good', 'friend', 'lot', 'Carmelo', 'Anthony', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'confirm', 'anything', 'though', '4', '5']",Think Like a Man

El-Hewie""","[3, 8]","After watching the Indian movie; Cocktail directed by Homi Adajania, I could clearly discern the shallowness of the American counter-part; Think Like a Man. In the American story, five naive parallel scenarios unfolded simultaneously. The dynamics of male-female interaction in those scenarios are analyzed in the context of a book author being interviewed on the TV show; Oprah Winfrey. So, the entire theme of the movie was merely demonstrating the examples proposed by the book author.In contrast, the Indian counter-part; Cocktail,relied on the most powerful effect of Indian culture to demonstrate the tragic consequences of sexual promiscuity of women versus the rewarding appeal of conservative, well-cultured women. In such cultural enriching drama, in Cocktail, the lasting impact of the drama was certain as the emotions, feelings, and consequences were all believable, real, and greater than fabricated comedy.Beside the poor taste of using book advertisement to sell movie tickets and books, the stereotyping of male-female relationships into limited number of scenarios coveys the wrong message that harassment and forcible demands could secure viable relationships. Almost all five scenarios are unlikely to take place in real life for many obvious reasons. First, all females were black, as well as the book author, which conveys the sense of limited racial mindset. Second, all women were more of abusers than victims of abusive males. One wife was beating up his husband, another woman dumped her boyfriend for a richer one without any good reason, another acted childishly with a better educated man for no reason other than the book author said so, yet another woman altered every thing the house to force her boyfriend to propose, and another woman kicked her boyfriend out of her house after spying on his personal phone calls.The only scenario that truly kept viewers laughing was the divorced husband who was being beaten up by his wife and who was a truly gifted comedian. The other four, despite being played by capable actors, could not remedy the poor taste of using the movie theater to advertise for a book author in blatant and improper manner.The lasting feeling left by this movie is the true loss of American values and families and the use of media to substitute the most precious cultural heritage of a nation by commercially driven enterprises.Mohamed F.

In it, Harvey describes how a woman could learn different types of men and determine if a potential relationship is right for her.The movie is based on four men and four women, the men being the different `types' the women need to think like in order to have successful relationships. I'm truly of two minds regarding this movie. For starters, it's very heavy-handed that it is based on the Steve Harvey book. I mean, there wasn't a book with a picture of Mario Puzo anywhere in the movie The Godfather, and Rhett didn't need to reference a book before telling Scarlett he didn't give a damn in Gone with the Wind, why couldn't a story be crafted without having extremely convenient and awkward-fitting cut-ins to Harvey mentioning segments of his book or the women saying things that begin with, ""Steve Harvey says..."" And by the way, this is a romantic comedy, to play Steve Harvey serious is a complete travesty. The man is an accomplished comedian and he was a bore.But maybe I'm being unfair. The Godfather and Gone with the Wind were two completely different kinds of movies from Think Like a Man. A comparison to a movie within its genre would be fair, right? How about, I dunno, say He's Just Not that Into You, starring everyone. That movie was based on the book by the same title, written by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo and made into a romantic comedy. But it didn't need to constantly hearken back to its source material as if seeking purchase in the minds of the people who'd read the book or wanted to. And as romantic comedies tend to go, He's Just Not That Into You was boring (in my opinion).Which brings me to my other mind on Think. Despite any preconceived notions I found myself laughing frequently throughout this movie. This is mostly due to the efforts of Kevin Hart, who plays Cedric, a man at the tail-end of divorce in the midst of three of his friends involved in budding romances. But Hart is more than just comedy relief. He's the movie's fulcrum and carries it off with a degree gravitas, despite going for the joke in nearly every scene. There's a palpable degree of juxtaposition between what Cedric is going through and what the other three men are experiencing, most apparent during his divorce party when the men are all thinking about their relationships and realizing how they are being manipulated.So not entirely liking or disliking the movie, the only other means I have to determine if it was a success in my mind is watchability. Would I watch this again? I rented it from Blockbuster, but I don't see myself renting it again (but that's probably more likely because I can get it from my library), but when this comes on HBO or Showtime, unless it's competing with boxing, I think I would.",3,Kevin Hart is the Greatest Actor on Earth,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,2954,"['wife', 'saw', 'movie', 'Think', 'Man', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'took', 'little', 'thoughts', 'culminate', 'movie', 'based', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'book', 'Act', 'Lady', 'Think', 'Man', 'published', '2009', 'Harvey', 'how', 'woman', 'could', 'learn', 'different', 'types', 'men', 'determine', 'potential', 'relationship', 'right', 'her.The', 'movie', 'based', 'four', 'men', 'four', 'women', 'men', 'being', 'different', 'types', 'women', 'need', 'think', 'order', 'have', 'successful', 'relationships', ""'m"", 'truly', 'two', 'minds', 'regarding', 'movie', 'starters', 'very', 'heavy-handed', 'based', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'book', 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'picture', 'Mario', 'Puzo', 'anywhere', 'movie', 'Godfather', 'Rhett', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'reference', 'book', 'telling', 'Scarlett', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'damn', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'story', 'be', 'crafted', 'having', 'extremely', 'convenient', 'awkward-fitting', 'cut-ins', 'Harvey', 'mentioning', 'segments', 'book', 'women', 'saying', 'things', 'begin', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'way', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'play', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'serious', 'complete', 'travesty', 'man', 'accomplished', 'comedian', 'was', 'bore.But', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'unfair', 'Godfather', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'were', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Think', 'Man', 'comparison', 'movie', 'genre', 'would', 'be', 'fair', 'right', 'How', 'dunno', 'say', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'starring', 'everyone', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'written', 'Greg', 'Behrendt', 'Liz', 'Tuccillo', 'made', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'constantly', 'hearken', 'back', 'source', 'material', 'seeking', 'purchase', 'minds', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'wanted', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'tend', 'go', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'was', 'boring', 'opinion', 'other', 'mind', 'Think', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'found', 'laughing', 'frequently', 'movie', 'mostly', 'due', 'efforts', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'who', 'Cedric', 'man', 'tail-end', 'divorce', 'midst', 'three', 'friends', 'involved', 'budding', 'romances', 'Hart', 'more', 'just', 'comedy', 'relief', 'movie', 'fulcrum', 'off', 'degree', 'gravitas', 'going', 'joke', 'nearly', 'scene', 'palpable', 'degree', 'juxtaposition', 'what', 'Cedric', 'going', 'what', 'other', 'three', 'men', 'are', 'experiencing', 'most', 'apparent', 'divorce', 'party', 'when', 'men', 'are', 'thinking', 'relationships', 'realizing', 'how', 'are', 'being', 'not', 'entirely', 'liking', 'disliking', 'movie', 'only', 'other', 'means', 'have', 'determine', 'was', 'success', 'mind', 'watchability', 'Would', 'watch', 'again', 'rented', 'Blockbuster', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'renting', 'again', 'probably', 'more', 'likely', 'can', 'get', 'library', 'when', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'competing', 'boxing', 'think', 'would']",Think Like a Man

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[24, 33]","The beginning of the film started off a little rocky to me mainly because the trailers showed so many good joking scenes so when they appeared in the film, I didn't really get to enjoy the laugh. Women complained about men. Men complained about women. I LOVE Kevin Hart and Michael Ealy, and I've just gotten more hip to Romany Malco after hearing him on ""The Breakfast Club"" (saw ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" but I couldn't have told you his name by heart up until that interview). And as much as I enjoy watching Taraji Henson act (her hair looked GREAT in the film), respect La La Anthony and Gabrielle Union, Regina Hall was who I wanted to see most on the women's side mainly because she was absolutely hilarious in the Style Magazine interview. Her comedic face and timing are way underrated and not taken advantage of in this film. But with that said, this turned out to be a great film for reasons I didn't expect.1) I had no idea Morris Chestnut was even in the film. (Spoiler alert: I have been on that Morris-Chestnut-date. It is the WORST so I buried my head reliving it while watching this movie.)2) Michael Ealy and Taraji Henson had some seriously juicy makeout scenes. They weren't as memorable as the one with Halle Berry in ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" but there was definitely tongue action involved. Two hot people in a hot scene made for great ""Oooh, look at them!"" moments.3) Kevin Hart (If I need to explain anything past his name, you need to do some comedic research. Everything about Kevin Hart in this movie was great.) And my gawd, his wife...I was NOT expecting her to be in the film either, but those two are almost equally nuts.4) Jerry Ferrara is someone I didn't know before this film and I probably wouldn't have put him and Gabrielle Union together, but those two were too cute on film. I got the impression he was shorter than her, but those two were the second most fun couple to watch.5) I was really impressed with Terrence J.'s acting. I saw ""Stomp the Yard 2"" and thought it was terrible, but in this movie, he did a great job. Jenifer Lewis is going to bring out anybody's personality when she's next to him, but Terrence J. held his own all by himself.6) The guest appearances from some major stars like Kelly Rowland, Chris Brown and Arielle Kebbel were fun to see. Kelly impressed me with her acting. I already knew Chris Brown was a very good actor. And I'm a HUGE ""The Vampire Diaries"" fan so anything with Arielle Kebbel in it is going to make me happy to see her. You'll also see some pop-up appearances from other popular comedians like Tony Rock, Bruce Bruce and Luenell.Steve Harvey wasn't kidding when he said some of everybody was in this film. There are cameos everywhere, but they all make sense. People are really playing parts, not just thrown in to say ""look, I'm a celeb and I'm in this movie, too."" Fellas will go for the comedy and the beautiful women (love Meagan Good's hair, too). Ladies will go to crack up laughing at Kevin Hart and point out which one of the women they are FROM Steve Harvey's book. Or, they'll applaud the guys for making fun of the book (there are two extreme sets of readers for this book). Either way it goes, it's a great film and I like the way it ended, including that Morris Chestnut date that was too close to home (for me).",4,Started off slow but picked up dramatically,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,3313,"['beginning', 'film', 'started', 'off', 'little', 'rocky', 'mainly', 'trailers', 'showed', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'joking', 'scenes', 'so', 'when', 'appeared', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'enjoy', 'laugh', 'Women', 'complained', 'men', 'Men', 'complained', 'women', 'LOVE', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Michael', 'Ealy', ""'ve"", 'just', 'gotten', 'more', 'hip', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'hearing', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'saw', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'told', 'name', 'heart', 'up', 'interview', 'as', 'much', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Taraji', 'Henson', 'act', 'hair', 'looked', 'GREAT', 'film', 'respect', 'La', 'La', 'Anthony', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'was', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'most', 'women', 'side', 'mainly', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Style', 'Magazine', 'interview', 'comedic', 'face', 'timing', 'are', 'way', 'underrated', 'not', 'taken', 'advantage', 'film', 'said', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'film', 'reasons', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect.1', 'had', 'idea', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'was', 'even', 'film', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'have', 'been', 'Morris-Chestnut-date', 'WORST', 'buried', 'head', 'reliving', 'watching', 'movie', '2', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'Taraji', 'Henson', 'had', 'seriously', 'juicy', 'makeout', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'memorable', 'one', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Eyes', 'Were', 'Watching', 'God', 'was', 'definitely', 'tongue', 'action', 'involved', 'Two', 'hot', 'people', 'hot', 'scene', 'made', 'great', 'Oooh', 'look', 'moments.3', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'need', 'explain', 'anything', 'name', 'need', 'do', 'comedic', 'research', 'Everything', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'gawd', 'wife', 'was', 'NOT', 'expecting', 'be', 'film', 'two', 'are', 'almost', 'equally', 'nuts.4', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'together', 'two', 'were', 'too', 'cute', 'film', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'shorter', 'two', 'were', 'second', 'most', 'fun', 'couple', 'watch.5', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'Terrence', 'J', 'acting', 'saw', 'Stomp', 'Yard', '2', 'thought', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Jenifer', 'Lewis', 'going', 'bring', 'out', 'anybody', 'personality', 'when', 'next', 'Terrence', 'J.', 'held', 'own', 'himself.6', 'guest', 'appearances', 'major', 'stars', 'Kelly', 'Rowland', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'were', 'fun', 'see', 'Kelly', 'impressed', 'acting', 'already', 'knew', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'actor', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'fan', 'anything', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'going', 'make', 'happy', 'see', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'pop-up', 'appearances', 'other', 'popular', 'comedians', 'Tony', 'Rock', 'Bruce', 'Bruce', 'Luenell.Steve', 'Harvey', 'was', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'when', 'said', 'everybody', 'was', 'film', 'are', 'cameos', 'everywhere', 'make', 'sense', 'People', 'are', 'really', 'playing', 'parts', 'not', 'just', 'thrown', 'say', 'look', ""'m"", 'celeb', ""'m"", 'movie', 'too', 'Fellas', 'will', 'go', 'comedy', 'beautiful', 'women', 'love', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'hair', 'too', 'Ladies', 'will', 'go', 'crack', 'up', 'laughing', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'point', 'out', 'one', 'women', 'are', 'FROM', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'book', ""'ll"", 'applaud', 'guys', 'making', 'fun', 'book', 'are', 'two', 'extreme', 'sets', 'readers', 'book', 'way', 'great', 'film', 'like', 'way', 'ended', 'including', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'date', 'was', 'too', 'close', 'home']",Think Like a Man

1469424,A1IUE52O75XPZS,B005LAIH86,teatime,"[0, 0]","This is a fluff movie that is fun to watch when you want to just sit back, enjoy, laugh a little, and take a break from life.  I found most of the characters likable, and Kevin Hart is adorable and really funny in this--every scene he's in is great.This film is based on the premise of male author of a self-help book ""Think Like a Man"" that if you understand the way men operate and know what to expect them to do next in the relationship, you can outwit them and trap them into a marriage. It's a ridiculous premise (that you can manipulate a person into marriage and that they are clueless enough to fall for it), but it's fun to watch anyway and I would totally watch it again.This is a battle of the sexes movie full of old cliches that are not necessarily true all the time for either sex.  So take everything negative and bombastic about stereotypes in dating and put those aspects into good-looking people and this is what you get.  I didn't like that for the sake of drama, they make the women so tough-skinned and hard-hearted. I don't care WHO you are, but if a kind man makes a serious effort to be a good man in a relationship, the woman will go with it! --she will not try to implode the relationship--that's hard to believe.  Since it is hard to find a good man who also happens to be into you, if we do find one, we're not going to be that stupid.  I do think though that men more frequently let good women slip through their fingers just because they won't settle down until their ready; they are just wired like that.  Most women I know are ready to settle down yesterday.Anyway, if you don't judge it and sit back, you will enjoy this predictable movie.  It's cute and likable and if you watch it with friends, you'll have lots to discuss afterwards.  As a latina woman I also really appreciated that african-american people in this film are portrayed as normal, educated, decent, classy, striving, mature, relaxed, and moderate.  This film could easily have replaced the cast with any ethnicity and it would have worked equally--so thanks to the film-makers for avoiding those negative stereotypes!

1469431,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIH86,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[2, 4]","Truth. Steve Harvey's so-called self help book, Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man is about as sharp in its insights as a dull butter knife. The only reason for the monumental success was a mention by Oprah, and she could push a book about dried poop to the best seller list. Described as the guide to helping women decode the supposedly complicated inner workings of the average guy's brain, the book is really a bunch of cliches given clever little nick names and written for those with the relationship acumen of the 40 Year Old Virgin. The film doesn't fall far from the tree, and is best taken as a simple rom-com with a bevy of incredible African-American talent taking advantage of a rarely given opportunity to shine.That's not to say that Think Like a Man is a film specifically targeted at African-Americans, because it isn't. One of the true joys is seeing people like Kevin Hart, Michael Ealy, and Regina Hall in a comedy with some universal truths. The never ending war between men and women on the field of love is something everyone can relate to, and the games we play are time tested and battle worn.Before the manipulation game begins, one has to get through an hour of Steve Harvey ego stroking, as the comedian pops up every couple of minutes, grinning like he stole somethin'(like your money if you bought his book) and mugging for the camera. The story centers on a close knit group of guys who all represent clearly stereotypes depicted in the book: there's the mamma's boy(Terrence J); the ""dreamer""(Michael Ealy); the Playa(Romany Malco); and the man child who won't commit(Jerry Ferrara). The men find themselves taken off guard by the release of Harvey's book, which has apparently been dropped from the heavens and written by the all-knowing hand of some love deity. Book stores can't keep it in stock, you can't even get it on Kindle, and women worship it like chocolate covered diamonds.Gabrielle Union, Taraji P. Henson, Regina Hall, and Meagan Good make up the ladies who use Harvey's words to try and transform their guys, even though they fit into neat little categories as well, like the ""90 Day Rule"" girl and the single mom. When any of the characters talk about the opposite sex, none of them say anything remotely new. If you saw Two Can Play That Game then it's much the same dynamic, with both sides working the other until all the scheming inevitably falls apart. What works best is when the guys are all together, especially during the hilarious basketball scenes, because we get to see the camaraderie and chemistry of the cast come together.Once Harvey steps aside, Kevin Hart takes over as the story's primary narrator, in what is the film's funniest, most endearing performance as the guy who most vehemently values his freedom after a brutal divorce. Think back to the way Chris Tucker blew our minds in Friday, and that's the impact Hart brings to the film. He zips in and out of every scene and when not acting like a complete fool he even shows a few moments of sincere emotional depth.Many of the connecting stories don't stretch beyond familiar territory, with the exception being Ealy and Henson's sexy courtship. She plays a high powered exec who expects her man to match her status and ferocious independence, while Ealy is a poor sous chef looking for his big break. They share some seriously hot moments that threaten to melt the screen.While not doing anything particularly new, Think Like A Man has enough raw talent to overcome a few flaws with the script and Harvey's burdensome armchair psychology.",3,Takes off once Harvey gets out of the way,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",2012,3560,"['Truth', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'so-called', 'self', 'help', 'book', 'Act', 'Lady', 'Think', 'Man', 'sharp', 'insights', 'dull', 'butter', 'knife', 'only', 'reason', 'monumental', 'success', 'was', 'mention', 'Oprah', 'could', 'push', 'book', 'dried', 'poop', 'best', 'seller', 'list', 'Described', 'guide', 'helping', 'women', 'decode', 'supposedly', 'complicated', 'inner', 'workings', 'average', 'guy', 'brain', 'book', 'really', 'bunch', 'cliches', 'given', 'clever', 'little', 'nick', 'names', 'written', 'relationship', 'acumen', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'film', ""n't"", 'fall', 'far', 'tree', 'best', 'taken', 'simple', 'rom-com', 'bevy', 'incredible', 'African-American', 'talent', 'taking', 'advantage', 'rarely', 'given', 'opportunity', 'shine.That', 'not', 'say', 'Think', 'Man', 'film', 'specifically', 'targeted', 'African-Americans', ""n't"", 'One', 'true', 'joys', 'seeing', 'people', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'comedy', 'universal', 'truths', 'never', 'ending', 'war', 'men', 'women', 'field', 'love', 'something', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'games', 'play', 'are', 'time', 'tested', 'battle', 'worn.Before', 'manipulation', 'game', 'get', 'hour', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'ego', 'stroking', 'comedian', 'up', 'couple', 'minutes', 'grinning', 'stole', 'somethin', 'money', 'bought', 'book', 'mugging', 'camera', 'story', 'centers', 'close', 'knit', 'group', 'guys', 'who', 'represent', 'clearly', 'stereotypes', 'depicted', 'book', 'mamma', 'boy', 'Terrence', 'J', 'dreamer', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'Playa', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'man', 'child', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'commit', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'men', 'find', 'taken', 'off', 'guard', 'release', 'Harvey', 'book', 'apparently', 'been', 'dropped', 'heavens', 'written', 'all-knowing', 'hand', 'love', 'deity', 'Book', 'stores', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'stock', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'Kindle', 'women', 'worship', 'chocolate', 'covered', 'diamonds.Gabrielle', 'Union', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'make', 'up', 'ladies', 'who', 'use', 'Harvey', 'words', 'try', 'transform', 'guys', 'even', 'fit', 'neat', 'little', 'categories', 'well', '90', 'Day', 'Rule', 'girl', 'single', 'mom', 'When', 'characters', 'talk', 'opposite', 'sex', 'none', 'say', 'anything', 'remotely', 'new', 'saw', 'Two', 'Can', 'Play', 'Game', 'then', 'much', 'same', 'dynamic', 'sides', 'working', 'other', 'scheming', 'inevitably', 'apart', 'What', 'best', 'when', 'guys', 'are', 'together', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'basketball', 'scenes', 'get', 'see', 'camaraderie', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'come', 'together.Once', 'Harvey', 'steps', 'aside', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'over', 'story', 'primary', 'narrator', 'what', 'film', 'funniest', 'most', 'endearing', 'performance', 'guy', 'who', 'most', 'vehemently', 'freedom', 'brutal', 'divorce', 'Think', 'back', 'way', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'blew', 'minds', 'Friday', 'impact', 'Hart', 'film', 'scene', 'when', 'not', 'acting', 'complete', 'fool', 'even', 'few', 'moments', 'sincere', 'emotional', 'depth.Many', 'connecting', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'familiar', 'territory', 'exception', 'being', 'Ealy', 'Henson', 'sexy', 'courtship', 'high', 'powered', 'exec', 'who', 'man', 'match', 'status', 'ferocious', 'independence', 'Ealy', 'poor', 'sous', 'chef', 'looking', 'big', 'break', 'share', 'seriously', 'hot', 'moments', 'threaten', 'melt', 'screen.While', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'particularly', 'new', 'Think', 'Man', 'enough', 'raw', 'talent', 'overcome', 'few', 'flaws', 'script', 'Harvey', 'burdensome', 'armchair', 'psychology']",Think Like a Man

However I watched this and it was pretty funny!

So instead of just the men making mistakes, we see that women make mistakes too, so it's kept in perspective.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***So even if you're a guy like me, you'll still enjoy this funny movie that also is kinda touching at the same time.Check it out!",4,Romantic but Funny!,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,908,"[""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'sweet.Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'like', 'action', 'adventure', 'violence', 'death', 'destruction', 'mayhem', 'However', 'watched', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'was', 'neat', 'see', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'act', 'when', 'other', 'gender', ""n't"", 'around', 'well', 'least', 'according', 'film-maker', 'how', 'act', '***SPOILERS***', '***SPOILERS***', '***SPOILERS***The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'antics', 'voice-over', 'work', 'narrator.We', 'have', 'different', 'types', 'men', 'women', 'as', 'usual', 'men', 'screw', 'up', 'what', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'women', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'instead', 'just', 'men', 'making', 'mistakes', 'see', 'women', 'make', 'mistakes', 'too', 'kept', 'perspective', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***So', 'even', ""'re"", 'guy', ""'ll"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'movie', 'also', 'kinda', 'touching', 'same', 'time.Check', 'out']",Think Like a Man
