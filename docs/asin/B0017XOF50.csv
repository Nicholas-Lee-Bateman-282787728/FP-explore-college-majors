1158161,A3ROE64EVHDTTV,B0017XOF50,"AMP ""Al""","[15, 19]","The Good Things*A great, varied assortment of comedic sketches that makes fun of many different aspects of modern-day society, culture, and politics.  Topics include such issues as terrorism, sexuality in pop music, corporate greed, and so on.*A few good parodies (most prominently, Steven Segal parodying himself!).*Also a good number of original sketches.*A few funny pieces of self-parody (ie, the scenes where film critics gather around and rate the movie).*There is a very slight story arc that ties in many of the sktis together into a bizzare finale, and ultimately presents some major themes about journalistic ethics and corporate greed (although these themes are not very strongly developed).The Bad Things*No characters to develop, no story to tell (but hey, it's sketch comedy, so who cares?).The Questionable Things*A fair amount of perversity.  Expect a lot of swear words and a little bit of graphicness.  Some may find it too crude, but I think it's just right.*Quite a bit of racey humor.This eighty-minute collection of skits is probably the funniest thing I have seen in a while.  The comedy is great, and presents enough satire to make it somewhat thoughtful.  There is some sickness to some of it, but it's nowhere near as bad as some other comedies out there (like ""Meet the Spartans"" or the ""Scary Movie"" series).  It may not be as funny as the Onion website, but I would say that this is comparable to ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Robot Chicken,"" or Monty Python's ""Meaning of Life.""The disc has okay video and sound quality.

1158163,A32Y55Z00QI12S,B0017XOF50,ARK,"[6, 10]","I first caught this movie in its cut, censored television viewing. I laughed so hard that tears came to my eyes. ""How did I miss this movie?"" I asked myself. ""This is great!"" So of course, I ordered the thing.But to my shock, I discovered that the televised version is actually superior to the ""Raw and Uncut"" version. Not only was the televised version funnier, it appeared to be an entirely different movie! The scenes are arranged in different orders, some of the skits are longer, or the shots are different--all to the film's detriment.Please don't get me wrong. Several of the skits are absolutely hilarious and made me laugh until my stomach ached. Just check out Proteus the Invincible, the racial stereotypes skit, and the skit where overcrowded prisons send prisoners to live with law-abiding American families. Much of what I love about the Onion--its irreverent humor, which lampoons everyone, regardless of belief, race, gender, what have you--remains on the mark.The thing that ends up crippling this movie is the sex. It's everywhere, and it's not funny--it's solely offensive. Let me add that sex humor can most certainly work, and that the problem is that a scriptwriter mistook shocking material for humor. The only place where including it made sense to me was the ""Britney Spears"" gag, and that was overdone to the point of nausea.By ""shocking,"" let me just give one example: there is a cartoon of a terrorist engaging in a variety of sexual acts with his 72 virgins, where very little is left to the imagination. This isn't humor. This is the equivalent of a child leaping up and screaming the ""F"" word in a crowded school bus. Said child's not doing it to be funny; he's doing it to show how very edgy and mature he is. But of course, we know this child is not edgy or mature, he's just disgusting and needs to be kicked. And the same is true of The Onion Movie. It takes no skill to be pointlessly crude. If I wanted this kind of humor I could read YouTube comments.If this kind of humor were limited to one or two places, or were tamer, or were even shared in smaller doses, it would be tolerable. But it isn't any of these things. It appears often and randomly, sometimes in the middle of otherwise laugh-out-loud skits. For example, the cartoon I just mentioned occurs in the middle of an instructional video for terrorists. The skit itself is hilarious. The erotic cartoon ends up destroying it. How on earth can I watch this with my friends and family? I can't! And that's half the fun of humor--sharing it with someone else, starting in-jokes, and the like!At the end of the movie, I felt disgusting. The parts of the movie that were worth watching were hopelessly entangled with the smutty parts. Now I greatly regret spending anything on this DVD.

1158164,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B0017XOF50,Boss Fan,"[21, 34]","You're better off just reading the paper""The Onion Movie"", shelved for 5 years - and now I see for relatively good reason - is finally on DVD, and I for one was happy to hear it was finally going to be released.  I find the paper humorous enough in its topical satire and nonsequiter parodies.  I also think their film and music critics are as balanced, informative, to the point and well-written, if not better than, many major media critics.  The fake-news, culure-skewing paper has a rabid following, too large to be considered a cult following, but still specialized enough that the community of readers make up something of an insiders-joke.  It is equal parts SNL style sketch comedy, National Lampoon political satire and Zucker Bothers pop culture parody; and surely at least part of the blueprint when Comedy Central was building ""The Daily Show"".Its fan base had reason to rejoice at the news that the creators of paper as fearless, biting and pointed as ""the Onion"" would turn their satire and dry-witted brand of comedy into a feature film.  After all, The Onion skewers crappy movies, lame comedies, and Hollywood horses*#t in general on a regular basis.  If any writers could rise above the mediocre in writing a script for a slapstick satire, surely it's these guys, right?Well, not so fast.  ""The Onion Movie"" is basically a riff on the ZAZ Team films of the 80s.  It is constructed like their ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" as a series of skits, loosely hung together by a unifying thread.  That thread here is a news journalist who reads off Onion headlines, which give way to various skits.  Some are parody movie trailers, some are faux pop star interviews, some are twisted human interest pieces, commercial parodies and political/world news jabs.  The joke is that corporate sponsors and Hollywood gossip-obsessed viewing audiences are ruining the news.This is a fairly decent jumping off point for a film of this type, but just like many of the skits and parodies within the film, the writers have come up with a decent thesis, but their execution is most often weak.  For instance, early on there is a bit about a bank robber holding up a bank not for money, but for a job.  That is a funny idea, and would even make for some decent satirical jabs at the economy, but the writers can only come up with predictable gags from there and the skit just limps to a ho-hum conclusion.  ""Cockpuncher"", the reoccurring Steven Seagal film trailer, is funny enough, but they don't really ""go for it"".  Its humor is pretty obvious and safe.  It seems there had to be more there with a title like that and the real Steven Seagal at your disposal.  There is a Britney Spears parody that falls victim to the same problem.  It's funny initially, but the writers just seem to have nowhere else to go with it.  It's funny enough as is (love the `teddy bear'), but not as funny as it could, or should, be.  None of this is any better than what you can catch on any given weekend on say SNL or any show of that nature, and there has been much sharper satire of similar themes on shows like ""South Park"" over the years.And some of it is downright bad.  There are some long, unfunny skits that go nowhere; like the 'rape game' or the white kid who acts black and then is mistaken for a black criminal.  The joke in these skits are clear, but the execution of those jokes are poor and unfunny.  It's too obvious where they are going from the get go and it takes them forever to get there.  Some of the race stuff is particularly disappointing because it seems thrown in, rather than developed into actual satirical commentary.All the gags and skits come full circle at the end in a sequence, that like the movie, is alternately funny, lame and disappointing (though a Rodney Dangerfield cameo is welcome, if only because he has been gone for a while now, its nice to see him in something new, filmed before he died).I was expecting much more from this movie.  I suppose if I were 12 again and was hanging out with some friends and we just happened to catch this on late night TV some night, we'd think it was a pretty great find.  It has the absurdity of the ZAZ films like ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" (a film I did initially see as a kid late one night not knowing what the heck it was), but none of that film's inspired wit.  If they were aiming at kids, then I suppose this move is a success, but for the Onion's core audience, and with their probably-high expectations to deliver something along the lines of the paper in terms of quality writing and social commentary, this film is a big misfire.  Plus, it's just not that funny.The next time the Onion's critics trash some drek like ""Meet the Spartans"" for being tired, uninspired and pointless, you know they have to feel a little dirty inside knowing this then is the film the paper they are writing such reviews in, begging for quality comedies from Hollywood, made as a testimate to what film comedy, apparently by their standards, should be.""The Onion Movie"" isn't awful, its juts incredibly mediocre It falls so far short of even the most minimalist of expectations Onion fans may have had for it, that it seems all the worse.  I found it funny that it is suggested this film be purchased with ""Meet the Spartans,"" a film the Onion (rightly) hated.  Having seen it now though, it all makes sense.",2,My how stupid some of you premature 5-Star reviwers are going to feel...,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,5346,"[""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'just',

But somehow the same crew needed five years to get a loosely-strung collection of MadTV-style sketches to the big (make that small) screen. This movie actually has a bit of useful plot, as veteran news anchor Norm Archer (Len Cariou) tries to stand up to corporate tie-ins during his newscasts, forced on him by young integrity-deficient hucksters in the home office.The state of the news business in the real world, exemplified by Norm's lonely struggle here, is a ripe source of social and political commentary, and it's already been done in major movie productions like ""The Insider."" Here, this little plotline does get some room to roam, though most of the movie is built on short sketch segments starring little-known actors (except Steven Seagal and Michael Bolton playing themselves and badly in need of real gigs). The sketches are mostly based on Onion headlines mentioned by Norm during his newscasts, and most are straight from old editions of the online newspaper.Reviewers seem to be arguing about the merits of the humor found in this film's comedy sketches, with disagreement over whether the incisive political satire blends well with the concurrent lowest-common-denominator perversity and cheesy pop culture references. Well that's the Onion for you, and the arguments over smarts vs. smut sure won't be resolved here. So the way to judge this film is on whether Norm's plotline and the various sketches are FUNNY. Some are hilarious but some just aren't. Some drive tired gags into the ground and a few are in really poor taste even for the Onion (e.g. the Alzheimer's march). We all know the Onion is hysterical for the thinking satire fan, so does the movie match up to the newspaper? Partially. But even some faithful Onion fans won't find this film to be worth the wait or the money.

It depends on your mood and your tolerance for what one character described as potty humor thinly disguised as satire.The opening of ""The Onion Movie,"" leads viewers to believe that it's simply going to be a series of sketches strung together. But there is a plot of sorts. Longtime anchorman Norm Archer (played by Len Cariou) is forced to wage a lonely battle against the corporate sponsors who insist on plugging their products (with a cute electronic penguin), while he is trying to cover Important Issues. The young 'uns at the station find his position rather quaint, if not downright idiotic. Among the plugs is one for a Steven Seagal movie parody, featuring the actor himself. Meanwhile Archer covers more hard-hitting news stories such as the college student who attempts to mediate international peace talks with the help of weed; a Britney Spears-like diva who insists that her R-rated videos have nothing to do with sex; one man's doomed quest to buy the most up-to-date computer; and little known ethnic stereotypes.Some of the sketches may make you cringe - there's one about a rape role playing game and one about Alzheimer's sufferers marching on Washington. I did like the one about the over-eager gamer who eventually gets transported to a fantasy world, and the athlete who overcomes both the loss of his legs and wrists to play professional ice hockey.

The Onion News is a news service that parodies modern news right down to the Horoscopes. Spoofing modern news with spoof news filled with humor and scatological references, The Onion News has been offering a scathing satire on the modern news experience for years. In 2003, they opted to make a movie filled with the same satire of the modern world you'd find in the newspapers. Apparently, though, due to poor test screenings the movie was shelved and finally released on DVD in 2008 rather than theatrically. So how does it stack up?The Onion Movie is mainly a group of skits, working as news stories, commercials, movie spots, etc. Behind the skits there's a working TV news report: The Onion News ""The World's Greatest News Source"". The Onion News has just been bought out by a global conglomerate who requires the news to plug their movies on the air. News anchor, Norm Archer, thinks this compromises the integrity of the news, and this leads to an interesting, and funny, confrontation at the end of the movie.The Onion Movie is a really funny movie with a few unfortunate down spots. It does a fairly good job of mixing the politically incorrect (Little Known Racial Stereotypes, Terrorist Training Video, etc.), with satire of celebrities (Melissa Cherry, a Britney Spears knock off who sings songs like: ""Take Me From Behind,"" and lyrics like, ""So, let me give you some affection - just below your waist"" which are apparently just about friendship because she's a virgin), and satire of society (News report: ""The internet went down for three hours this morning, plunging the nation into productivity. The outage, which caused major work startages from New York to California, prevented an estimated 120 million American employees from messing around on the web at work""). Also, there are some funny cameos including a spoof commercial hosted by Michael Bolton for a children's charity organization, but the best is Steven Segal as the Cockpuncher.While those skits work very well, and the majority of the rest do, some skits fall flat on their face. Skits like the Dean Martin Celebrity Roast spoof and the majority of a skit dealing with teenagers playing D&D; are just not funny. Also the plot, while inherently harmless and flimsy, adds quite a few deadspots to the movie taking away from the fun of many of the skits.The Onion Movie is definitely worth a watch though. While not as funny as I hoped it was funnier than I expected. Naturally, for those of you who know of The Onion, know to expect nudity and cursing, so this is not a movie to watch with your kids.

So doesn't it make sense that it would broaden its interest and invade the world of film?I love movies that offer glimpse into the world of TV and movies. Movies that spoof the whole gamut of trailers, ads, shows and features. Two of the best of these were THE GROOVE TUBE and KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. They used a combination of each genre they spoofed to make it seem as if you were watching the real thing only in some distorted universe. THE ONION MOVIE tries to do the same thing.Most of the film revolves around a news program hosted by the honorable anchorman Norm Archer (Len Cariou) who delivers all sorts of news items that make up a number of the onscreen jokes. News items like a recall on new safety harness equipment in cars that go around passenger's necks that instead decapitate the wearer upon impact. Yes, the humor here IS irreverent.Mixed in with the news is a series of commercials and clips, most notable for the newest Steven Seagal movie coming out, C**KPUNCHER. If only I hadn't seen the previews for this movie it would have been so much funnier. Segal plays this trailer with a straight face, taking a humorous look at himself in the process. Congrats to him for the willingness to do so.The second most prevalent story here involves an interview with teen pop sensation Melissa Cherry (Sarah McElligott) who keeps saying that there is nothing suggestive about any of her song lyrics or videos. This pretend innocence mimics that of pop stars like Britney Spears as Melissa's song ""Take Me From Behind"" that features a life sized stuffed teddy bear doing just that while she's on her hands and knees in bed proves she either has no clue what she's singing about or a plan to play innocent while doing the opposite.A storyline that runs through the news behind the news is seen from beginning to end. Having been bought out by a conglomerate called Global Tetrahedron, product placements are all over the news broadcast. Penguins walking at lower screen level while world news is reported to blatant placements of company products get the best of our intrepid anchorman who complains without success.One of the worst things about this film is its use of parts of the movie over and over and over again. The Seagal film and portions involving Melissa Cherry are seen from beginning to literally the end of the film. If you don't have enough original material to use why keep playing the same thing over and over to fill in time?The film offers a few laughs, many of which are seen in the trailer you may have caught on other Fox releases. But for the most part it seems pretty lame. With the Onion as popular as it is, you would expect more from a movie that its name is attached to. I read somewhere that this movie was made several years back and that they had been trying to keep it from seeing the light of day.
