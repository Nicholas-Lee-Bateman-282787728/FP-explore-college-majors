She watched it straight through the first time, sitting on my lap, and subsequently, when I do the signs for some of the words depicted as we watch the video, she enjoys it. Sometimes she walks right up to the screen to 'touch' something / someone she has seen. The video shows a sign and it is pronounced simultaneously, then other depictions of the person / object / activity are shown giving one the opportunity to practice (which is what I do with my daughter). The clips are very nicely done showing people, especially kids relating to each other and some animals, too.  The words are probably the best vocabulary to work on with small children, including: eat, drink, milk, potty, mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, girl, boy, cookie, more, please, thank you, sit, stand, sleep, etc.The tape has multiple speakers / signers presenting each word. I know nothing about American Sign Language, so I cannot critique the video from the perspective of quality. I can say that I generally consider the productions of Small-Fry to be top notch in terms of content and production quality, and this is a shining example. I really like the healthy diversity of the people shown, especially seeing kids signing.I know that there has been work done recently on the value attributed to teaching an infant to sign - which ostensibly aids them developmentally and provides a means for communicating before the child is able to talk. While it is a little bit too soon to judge based upon our experience with this video, I can't imagine a more engaging way to demonstrate the technique to young children. I am sure that my daughters will pick-up some sign language - just how much will depend on how much I practice it with them.",5,Excellent - educational &amp; engaging,983145600,"02 26, 2001",2001,1868,"['have', 'had', 'video', 'just', 'week', 'put', 'one', '14', 'm.o', 'daughter', 'morning', 'spend', 'one-on-one', 'time', 'together', 'watched', 'straight', 'first', 'time', 'sitting', 'lap', 'subsequently', 'when', 'do', 'signs', 'words', 'depicted', 'watch', 'video', 'Sometimes', 'walks', 'right', 'up', 'screen', ""'touch"", 'something', 'someone', 'seen', 'video', 'sign', 'pronounced', 'simultaneously', 'then', 'other', 'depictions', 'person', '/', 'object', '/', 'activity', 'are', 'shown', 'giving', 'one', 'opportunity', 'practice', 'what', 'do', 'daughter', 'clips', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'showing', 'people', 'especially', 'kids', 'relating', 'other', 'animals', 'too', 'words', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'vocabulary', 'work', 'small', 'children', 'including', 'eat', 'drink', 'milk', 'potty', 'mother', 'father', 'grandmother', 'grandfather', 'girl', 'boy', 'cookie', 'more', 'please', 'thank', 'sit', 'stand', 'sleep', 'etc.The', 'tape', 'multiple', 'speakers', '/', 'signers', 'presenting', 'word', 'know', 'nothing', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language', 'can', 'not', 'critique', 'video', 'perspective', 'quality', 'can', 'say', 'generally', 'consider', 'productions', 'Small-Fry', 'be', 'top', 'notch', 'terms', 'content', 'production', 'quality', 'shining', 'example', 'really', 'healthy', 'diversity', 'people', 'shown', 'especially', 'seeing', 'kids', 'signing.I', 'know', 'been', 'work', 'done', 'recently', 'value', 'attributed', 'teaching', 'infant', 'sign', 'ostensibly', 'developmentally', 'means', 'communicating', 'child', 'able', 'talk', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'soon', 'judge', 'based', 'experience', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'more', 'engaging', 'way', 'demonstrate', 'technique', 'young', 'children', 'am', 'sure', 'daughters', 'will', 'pick-up', 'sign', 'language', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'practice']",N/A

We are not an ASL household but we wanted him to learn to communicate earlier than he could learn to talk.  The show has always been on-demand from our cable service (in short segments).  Some reviewers here have commented that the show lacks excitement and wow factor.  This is true and is exactly the reason that we have continually watched it over and over again.  We deliberately avoided loud and obnoxious kids shows in favor of calmer educational and musical shows.  As a result, our son has always loved Talking Hands.  Don't get me wrong, he is a very energetic boy - loves climbing and running - but he still takes mellow breaks to sit and study (not just watch, you can see in his eyes that he is studying) each move and word of the Talking Hands video.  He even hums the theme song when it starts and stops.Here is an example of how he has used what he learned:  Our local grocery stores gives out free cookies to kids, and before our son could talk we'd ask him if he wanted to go to the store and get a cookie.  He quickly learned to do the sign for cookie to signal that he wanted to go.  Now he is two and is saying the words that he learned from watching Talking Hands so much.  He can speak and sign most of the words on the show (he doesn't seem to get the meaning of words like ""play"").  Both his signs and words are imperfect, but since baby and parent alike have learned together, we understand each other very well as a result.My (rather opinionated) advice would be to start your children early on this video and don't expose (assault) them with more exciting (ADHD inducing) alternatives.  ;-)  Of course every child is different, so your mileage may vary.  Also you must learn the signs along with your child and use them constantly.",5,Started Early and Loved It,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,1821,"['started', 'watching', 'Talking', 'Hands', 'when', 'son', 'was', 'infant', 'are', 'not', 'ASL', 'household', 'wanted', 'learn', 'communicate', 'earlier', 'could', 'learn', 'talk', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'on-demand', 'cable', 'service', 'short', 'segments', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'commented', 'show', 'excitement', 'wow', 'factor', 'true', 'exactly', 'reason', 'have', 'continually', 'watched', 'over', 'again', 'deliberately', 'avoided', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'kids', 'shows', 'favor', 'calmer', 'educational', 'musical', 'shows', 'result', 'son', 'always', 'loved', 'Talking', 'Hands', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'very', 'energetic', 'boy', 'climbing', 'running', 'still', 'mellow', 'breaks', 'sit', 'study', 'not', 'just', 'watch', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'studying', 'move', 'word', 'Talking', 'Hands', 'video', 'even', 'hums', 'theme', 'song', 'when', 'example', 'how', 'used', 'what', 'learned', 'local', 'grocery', 'stores', 'out', 'free', 'cookies', 'kids', 'son', 'could', 'talk', ""'d"", 'ask', 'wanted', 'go', 'store', 'get', 'cookie', 'quickly', 'learned', 'do', 'sign', 'cookie', 'signal', 'wanted', 'go', 'Now', 'two', 'saying', 'words', 'learned', 'watching', 'Talking', 'Hands', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'speak', 'sign', 'most', 'words', 'show', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'meaning', 'words', 'play', 'signs', 'words', 'are', 'imperfect', 'baby', 'parent', 'alike', 'have', 'learned', 'together', 'understand', 'other', 'very', 'well', 'result.My', 'rather', 'opinionated', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'start', 'children', 'early', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'expose', 'assault', 'more', 'exciting', 'ADHD', 'inducing', 'alternatives', 'course', 'child', 'different', 'so', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'Also', 'must', 'learn', 'signs', 'child', 'use', 'constantly']",N/A
564678,AIIYS49GV63VI,B0000524EH,Fulltime Nana,"[0, 0]","Having owned and used the Baby Einstein's DVD ""First Signs"" for my infant granddaughter, I was pleased to find this DVD using the ASL sign language.She is now a toddler, and ready to learn more signs. Already she knows quite a few signs at the tender age of 16 months. This DVD has a much clearer presentation of each sign than the Baby Einstein's version. Not only does it include basic words, but it also includes the alphabet and counting. A minor complaint is that I wished they did not use all CAPS in their words because it would aid the child in also learning to read each word as they ""sign"" it. Another plus is that the DVD is divided into chapters making it easier to present just one segment at a time. At the end of the DVD, it also presents a quiz testing the viewer's knowledge of the signs.

However, my baby loves watching scenes of other kids at play, and was as captivated by the kids in this video as she would be with any other, non-signing video.The video introduces about ten to twelve (maybe more?) VERY basic signs - mother, father, baby, on, off, love, etc, plus cookie (which I personally don't feel is necessary for a baby to learn).There IS a nice diversity of kids and adults shown - different races and differently-abled kids - though I didn't see hearing aids on any of them, which might have been a nice nod to the non-hearing community (I realize, however, that today's hearing aids are so tiny that they're hard to spot if you're not looking for them!)This is truly a video for hearing children, as many scenes rely on a voice-over of the word being taught with no visual cue as to the sign.  There are no animations (except one scene where six cookies appear in two rows) or anything else to break up the talking heads interspersed with video footage instructional format.  None of the glitz of the Signing Time videos, for example - this is a bare-bones vocab lesson in 45 minutes.Scenes of doggies at play are interesting for a baby, but would quickly grow tiresome for older children (I watched the video with my 11-year-old just because he'll watch anything, but I don't imagine even he would watch it twice willingly :-) ), or for any adults in the home.I got this out of our library as a starting point, and will probably watch it once with my baby - a few minutes at a time as it's a nice way to distract her when she's being changed.  I know she likes watching the other babies, and the animals... but for that, I could put on any kiddie video - making this one a redundant addition to our repertoire.Save your money; I'll keep searching and report back when I've found something better!",2,Not useful as a signing video,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1884,"['video', 'MAY', 'have', 'place', 'teaching', 'signs', ""n't"", 'However', 'baby', 'watching', 'scenes', 'other', 'kids', 'play', 'was', 'captivated', 'kids', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'non-signing', 'video.The', 'video', 'introduces', 'about', 'ten', 'twelve', 'maybe', 'more', 'VERY', 'basic', 'signs', 'mother', 'father', 'baby', 'off', 'love', 'etc', 'cookie', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'necessary', 'baby', 'learn', 'nice', 'diversity', 'kids', 'adults', 'shown', 'different', 'races', 'differently-abled', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'hearing', 'aids', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'nod', 'non-hearing', 'community', 'realize', 'however', 'today', 'hearing', 'aids', 'are', 'so', 'tiny', ""'re"", 'hard', 'spot', ""'re"", 'not', 'looking', 'truly', 'video', 'hearing', 'children', 'many', 'scenes', 'rely', 'voice-over', 'word', 'being', 'taught', 'visual', 'cue', 'sign', 'are', 'animations', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'six', 'cookies', 'appear', 'two', 'rows', 'anything', 'else', 'break', 'up', 'talking', 'heads', 'interspersed', 'video', 'footage', 'instructional', 'format', 'None', 'glitz', 'Signing', 'Time', 'videos', 'example', 'bare-bones', 'vocab', 'lesson', '45', 'minutes.Scenes', 'doggies', 'play', 'are', 'interesting', 'baby', 'would', 'quickly', 'grow', 'tiresome', 'older', 'children', 'watched', 'video', '11-year-old', 'just', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'even', 'would', 'watch', 'twice', 'willingly', 'adults', 'home.I', 'got', 'library', 'starting', 'point', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'once', 'baby', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'nice', 'way', 'distract', 'when', 'being', 'changed', 'know', 'watching', 'other', 'babies', 'animals', 'could', 'put', 'kiddie', 'video', 'making', 'one', 'redundant', 'addition', 'repertoire.Save', 'money', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'searching', 'report', 'back', 'when', ""'ve"", 'found', 'something', 'better']",N/A

The signs are:mother, father (daddy), baby, boy, girl, grandmother, grandfather, love, please, thank you, eat, drink, more, cookie, potty, help, socks, shoes, hat, open, close, stop, go, sit, stand, off, on, play, ball, car, bubbles, books, video.Here's an example of how it's done.  For the word ""mother"" a woman signs it 3 times, a boy signs it twice, a girl says, ""mama"" and signs it twice.  The little dark-skinned girl that does the signs and talks is just so adorable. The other people, for the most part, are looking at an angle away from the camera and it's a bit annoying.At the end of the video they have a review.  They say, ""Do you know what this sign is?"" and they show a person doing the sign.  The audio is off but you can see them move their mouth while they say the word.  It doesn't take a genius to read their lips and know exactly what word they are saying.  I don't know how effective of a sign review that is.I thought a few of the people doing the signs did them a little wrong.  I am no expert (we started signing with my daughter 9 months ago) but for ""bubble"", as an example, they have someone signing it and it looks like bubbles are bursting; which is correct.  But, then another lady will sign it and it looks like she is grabbing bubbles instead of popping them.  Your fingers should be together and your fingers burst out, like a bubble popping.  But that one signer has her fingers out and then brings them together as if she is grabbing the bubbles and not popping them.  Also, the sign ""boy"" wasn't done the best.  Some of the signers look like they are just closing and opening their fingers by their forehead.  They really should have moved their hand forward a bit while doing that.  It's just a little thing but it should be done correctly, in my opinion.If you really want some excellent signing videos definitely go with ""Signing Time"" and ""My Baby Can Talk"".  My baby is 18 months old and has been watching these since she was 9 months.  She now knows over 50 signs.  She loves those dvd's so much and watches them everyday.
