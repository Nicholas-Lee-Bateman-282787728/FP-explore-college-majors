To be perfectly honest I was originaly looking for another movie with a similiar title when I found it.  After reading the reviews though I thought it might be worth a look and I was right.  I won't get into the devlopement of the characters or anything like that, nor will I discus the sex scenes.  I will simply say that it was a fun if rather adult in subject matter movie that gave me a couple of good laughs.  The story seemed believable and the humor was a little more sophisticated and better thought out than most of the comedies we see today.  It is not a great masterpiece and I don't associate it as being anything ground breaking in the way of lesbian or homesexual rights.

514134,A2DKKWJFN0NZ10,B00002CGG9,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]",This is a great lesbian romantic comedy.  I am a gay man but enjoy this movie and have it in my collection.  It is about a young lady that is out on her own and has sub-leased/house sitting for a lady that is going out of town.  She starts finding interest in another young lady when she finds out her mom is leaving her dad and shows up on her doorstep with her younger brother.  The mother does not know that the daughter is gay.  You then follow these members of the family as they grow socially and within the family.  By the end of the movie it very heart warming.

One thing's for sure - the acting is REALLY bad! It in no way builds you up, it's like these 2 girls meet and BAM they're living together. The movie is basically about a young girl who's on her own and she meets a lesbian who rubs her the right way and they fall in love. The young girls mom finds out that her daughter is gay when she goes to visit and  realizes the're not just good friends. You dont feel the emotions that you would think you would while watching this move. But like I said - the acting wasnt that great. The scene where they're painting is the highlight of the movie.

514140,A1IXS35SD82NBK,B00002CGG9,Boris Alemand,"[5, 6]","Wow, so many 5 star reviews! I guess I'll give a different perspective and say: This movie is bad. Really bad. I missed the first few minutes of it, so I can't comment on the opening credits--maybe they were magnificent-- but the rest of it I have unfortunately watched--and it fails in every which way. I realize that I'm not the target audience, but I have to say--this is one of the most bland, humorless ""comedies"" I've ever seen. The drama: contrived and cheesy. And all those jokes about sex-toys... If it isn't funny the first time, it won't be any funnier the twentieth. Cliche sit-com characters with cliche sit-com problems.  I'm surprised they didn't include a laugh track.The men were all portrayed poorly. OK, its a lesbian movie, but does that mean that ALL the guys have to be scumbags or in the brother's case, bland as all get-out? The mom's husband--cheats with a younger woman. The transexual's father--disowns her.  The border patrol guy--puritanically gets offended by lesbian literature. The coffee-shop owner-- a cheapskate and goof-ball (who won't even pay 20 bucks for a really good portrait). And he's the least bad of the bunch. And all those skin-heads? Come on. In the real world, there may be a few isolated comments thrown around sometimes, but most people are polite and respectful. The constant hateful, violent harassment in this movie seems a tad exaggerated. I mean, firebombing?? (And the coffee-shop dude emerging from a gas explosion with just a facefull of soot--yeah right.) The brother--he has the gravitas of a tissue paper. His one moment to be a man is ""unmanned"" by yet another sex-toy gag. Anne-Marie MacDonald (the book store owner), who I like, is totally wasted.The only funny moment in the movie was when the mom was SHOCKED that ""Judy"" was actually ""Jeremy"". Really, she didn't notice that ""she"" used to be a he? I'd say it was obvious from about a mile away. The whole ""romance"" between Judy and the bookshop owner wasn't exactly convincing. Maybe I'm clueless, but if Judy likes girls, then why not remain a dude? I mean, its easier that way, right?The songs played in the nightclub were tiresome--with the exception of the one about Julie Christie. That one I actually liked. But the relief was short-lived. The music selection hit a new low with the song that played near the end--that wretched song ""Ice Cream"" by Sarah MacLachlan. If I never hear that song again in my life, I will count myself fortunate. I'm glad that ""Better than Chocolate"" is over and I never have to see it again.

514152,A2MZXLN9TLP1R4,B00002CGG9,GLBT,"[89, 96]","There's no shortage of mediocre gay/lesbian movies out these days, in which we follow the trials and tribulations of a group of friends (gay, lesbian, maybe an occasional trans) as they fall in and out of love and do a lot of dancing. ""Better than Chocolate"" is another one of those movies and it's okay for what it is, but I can't help wishing these movies would aim just a little bit higher.As with most films in this genre, there's the central love story, here a sort of instant-fall-in-love scenario between two women, both of whom are essentially nice, attractive, etc. The ""character flaw"" of one is that she lives on the road and always leaves when the going gets tough; the other one's ""flaw"" is that she hasn't told her mother that she's gay, yet, and hasn't really committed to her identity as a lesbian. So, they fall in love, the mother comes to stay with her daughter, hijinks ensue. There are a few subplots tossed in, the most interesting of which centers around the one transgender character who is hoping (in vain) that her parents have finally accepted her.The good things about this movie? Well, for one thing, there are a couple of truly erotic scenes between the two main characters, and well done erotica is a rarity in ANY genre of film. Also, there are a couple of song/dance routines that are performed by the main characters that are truly nifty. As a matter of fact, I wish they'd done more of that and less of the soap-opera-y stuff.Perhaps the biggest flaw in the film is just how predictable it all is. You know who's going to end up together, you know that the mother will eventually find out the truth and, after a bit of shell-shock, will accept her daughter as a lesbian, etc. There are no surprises.

It was very sudden how they got together, within a few weeks saying that they were in love. Maggie's mother Lily and her brother come and live with Maggie, which creates a problem for her. Maggie is not out to her mother and wants to live her life and still maintain to keep her sexuality a secret. She works in a bookstore with Francis and Carla, and their transgendered friend Judy is often around. The story is enriched because it involves many stories which fold together. Lily redefining herself and discovering herself again, Judy finding love with long time crush Frances, Maggie's brother beginning a relationship with Carla, and more. One of the subplots centers around censorship, which was a well used plot in the movie.

So, as much as I hate to admit it; that's really the only reason I rented this movie. A few other things I hate to admit is that this movie is actually kind of funny, while it's pretty stupid at the same time. Also, this movie has the plot, dialouge, and look of a straight-to-video movie and for all I know, it is. The movie is about Maggie (Karyn Dwyer), a dancer at some weird pseudo-gay club and a clerk at an independent bookstore. Maggie also happens to sleep in this bookstore.Anyway, Maggie's mother Lila (Wendy Crewson) calls her and tells her that she needs a place to move to and Maggie says she can stay with her. So, now she runs and abnormally quickly funds a small loft to rent. But, then just a couple of hours before her mother and brother Paul (Kevin Mundy) arriveMaggie meets Kim (Christina Cox). The two fall in love and move in together (all of this happening at an extraordinarily quick pace), right as Lila and Paul show up. Lila doesn't know Maggie is a lesbian, (Paul finds out rather quickly though) and Maggie prefers to keep it that way, so she doesn't tell her and tries to hide it. Problem is, it's hard to keep your sexual orientation private when you're having sex on a couch in a room where a curtain is a substitute for a door. Meanwhile, Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald) the lesbian owner of Maggie's bookstore has to fight with Canadian customs to get her ""obscene"" books over the border. Then there's the transgender Judy (Peter Outerbridge) vying for Frances affection while warming up to Lila.Surprisingly, Outerbridge is actually quite good at playing a transgender man and he certainly looks the part. But, the one redeeming thing about this movie is the Frances character, who acutally happens to be pretty funny. Overall, this is a low grade looking movie that is trying to send out a message that is overshadowed by lesbian sex scenes. And personally, if you want good scenes like that rent ""Mulholland Dr."" or ""Where the Truth Lies"".

The story is great - it deals with the pain and frustration of coming out (or just figuring out your sexuality), falling in love, losing the one you love, and standing up for what you believe in juxtaposed nicely with commentary on the role of family in ones' life, what constitutes a family, and how we can all become happy with our lives.  Quite a lot of themes for just one film.  And Better than Chocolate handles each of them fairly well, if only briefly.  The actresses portraying Kim, Lila, Judy and Frances are just wonderful.  Each of them brings dimension to characters that could easliy have been played in a very one-sided way.  They become human rather than just symbols or stock players to fill up Maggie's world.  The friendship that develops between Lila and Judy is one of the best parts of the film.  Maybe this is just me, but I find that Maggie is a totally unsympathetic character.  She's whiny and immature and even snotty at times.  I care the least about her of all the characters in the film.. which is unfortunate because this is really a film revolving around her and the way her relationships (and those of her friends and family) work.

514175,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00002CGG9,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[39, 45]","Canadian director Anne Wheeler's ""Better than Chocolate"" is a wonderful movie about gay women, but it is also moderately about larger issues, such as liberation and acceptance.Maggie, a sweetly innocent clerk at a lesbian bookstore appropriately called 10% Books, meets intimidating butch Kim one afternoon. After Kim's van is towed away, they move in together faster than you can say ""What the hell are you thinking?"" Unfortunately, Maggie's mother Lila and her teenage brother move in that same night, thanks to Lila's nasty divorce. What really complicates matters is that Maggie hasn't come out to her mother yet, and even when she tries, Lila tries to avoid the subject, like she knows what's coming and doesn't want to hear it. (Haven't we all been there?)Interwoven with this is a dramatic subplot about Judy, a male to female transsexual who's in love with the bookstore's owner Frances, who is always freaking out because custom's officers are holding a list of books she has ordered, claiming the books are obscene and cannot be sold.The end result is a sweet romantic comedy with a hint of drama, which realistically portraits the problems faced by the lesbian community and how not everyone is willing to accept them. A powerful scene has Judy harassed by another woman for using the ladies room, because she is a man. The woman attacks Judy and begins beating her with a purse, splashing her drink in Judy's face. This was a tragic and powerful moment that really affected me, making me realize how unaccepting people can be of anything that is slightly different. It is moments like this that really make the movie so much better than other lesbian films.The title ""Better than Chocolate"" does not refer to sex, but to love, which Lila is convinced she will never find again now that her husband has admitted he's been screwing his partner's wife for more than a year. Since love is doubtful and sex seems out of the question, Lila has turned to chocolate instead.This is a great movie that really makes you think. It's wonderfully witty, surprisingly charming, and incredibly funny. It's the feel-good-movie of the year that just so happens to be about lesbians. This is highly recommended...is it better than chocolate? Who knows.

More humourous is the sweetly awkward romance between the transgendered Judy and the uptight bookstore owner Frances, who is going through a censorship crisis with Canadian Customs.  There's the relationship between bisexual Carla and Maggie's younger brother, a classic case of an &quot;older&quot; woman teaching an eager young man about love. The theme of chocolate is cleverly woven into the story, with Carla uttering one of the best lines for bisexual gals in the film: &quot;Soft centers... hard centers...I like all the chocolates in the box!&quot; And then there is Maggie's whiny, chocolate-popping mother, Lila, (brilliantly played by Wendy Crewson) who is going through the trauma of divorce. Along the way Lila discovers her own autonomy and independence, along with her daughter's sexuality which she eventually embraces, thanks to her own sexual evolution (the box!) and her friendship with Judy.

Typically we can't, but we know it would be fun. Which can also be said for subletting from a sex toy touting feminist, being employed by a cranky yet endearing, shy, androgenous activist, and having business and sex lives full of performance art. And so many other things in this movie. Yeah, there are a lot of things going on, but if it's going to be the life so many young [girls dream of, what's wrong with packing it chock full of fun stuff?And doesn't part of every lesbian want to be like Maggie and Kim? They're both sexy enough to get us excited but average-looking enough to be believable. The mother and brother are out of touch enough to make us nervous but cool enough in the end to make us feel all warm and fuzzy. And that, in the end, is all ""Better than Chocolate"" does. And it does it phenomenally well.Bottom LineCuddles: *****Tissues: ***Hotness: ****Laughs:  ***Quality: ****Just buy it already",5,Ooey Gooey Goodness,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,1372,"['seem', 'be', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'BTC', 'carry', 'words', ""'murky"", ""'political"", 'sense', 'BTC-virgins', 'who', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'raving', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'okay', 'thought', 'less', 'spectacular', 'what', ""'ve"", 'dreamed', 'so', 'many', 'nights.Is', ""n't"", 'part', 'young', 'lesbian', 'run', 'away', 'work', 'live', 'bookstore', 'work', 'live', 'elaborately', 'painted', 'van', 'Typically', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'subletting', 'sex', 'toy', 'touting', 'feminist', 'being', 'employed', 'cranky', 'yet', 'endearing', 'shy', 'androgenous', 'activist', 'having', 'business', 'sex', 'lives', 'full', 'performance', 'art', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'going', 'going', 'be', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'young', '[', 'girls', 'dream', 'what', 'wrong', 'packing', 'chock', 'full', 'fun', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'part', 'lesbian', 'want', 'be', 'Maggie', 'Kim', ""'re"", 'sexy', 'enough', 'get', 'excited', 'average-looking', 'enough', 'be', 'believable', 'mother', 'brother', 'are', 'touch', 'enough', 'make', 'nervous', 'cool', 'enough', 'end', 'make', 'feel', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'end', 'Better', 'Chocolate', 'phenomenally', 'well.Bottom', 'LineCuddles', '*****Tissues', '***Hotness', '****Laughs', '***Quality', '****Just', 'buy', 'already']",N/A

A movie of many mini-dramas in one, but blended together so well it's an exhilirating rollercoaster of love, lust, and the bonds of family.We don't know anything about Maggie (Karyn Dwyer) before she comes to this ""interesting part of town"" other than she's left university to find herself, and BE herself.  She gets a phone call from her mother, who doesn't know she's a lesbian, and the fun begins.  Mother Lila, (Wendy Crewson) is divorcing her husband and with brother Paul (Kevin Mundy) in tow, needs a place to stay.  Maggie finds a loft as a sublet, but there is a snag.  After performing a lip synching at a club she's met the girl of her dreams.  Kim (Christina Cox) is staying with Maggie as well, now to keep the affair from Lila!  Kim is torn.  She wants Maggie to come out to her mother so they don't have to hide their relationship.  She wants Maggie to be able to openly declare her love for her, but Maggie is so afraid.  The fear ultimatly threatens to tear the two women apart.We meet Maggie's friends, her boss Frances (Ann-Marie MacDonald), her friend, a transexual named Judy (Jerry Outerbridge), her co-worker Carla (Marya Delver), and coffee shop owner Tony (Tony Nappo).  Frances is at war with Customs, as they continually threaten her livlihood by witholding shipments of books and videos for her store.  Carla is a bi-sexual free spirit who ""likes hard centers, soft centers, all the chocolates in the box"".  Judy, who is under the misundersanding that her father has forgiven her for becoming a transexual befriends Lila and starts bringing her around to Maggie's point of view.Inadvertantly, Maggie's friends begin introducing Lila and Paul to new and exciting experiences.  Maggie's fears of coming out to her mother are soon alieviated when Lila discovers her in bed with Kim and the conflict grows.  Amid gay bashing and hate crimes the outcome of the movie is perfectly tied up and delightful.

Frances (Anne-Marie Macdonald) is absolutely hilarious and steals the whole movie as the buttoned down comfy shoe wearing gay book store owner having ongoing fights with Customs over censorship. That the actress who plays her is normally a successful playwright not an actress is even more astounding. Wonderful.Kim is perfect as the cool drifter who woos Maggie and is the catalyst for everyone's lives changing, though really she does little herself to make it so. In essence she has little to do but react to every one else's drama. But she does this so well.Mercifully Peter Outerbridge's transgender Judy isn't a drag-queenesque caricature of woman like many men tend to play such roles - all high hair, sequins and excessive lippy. He instead does a stunning graceful performance as a man who believes he should have been born a woman - even more remarkable is the acting given he is normally a straight leading man who has never frocked up before in his life.If you are hesitating on whether to buy this, I have never seen anyone not take something away from it - it has something for everyone. Heck, the Germans released it as a mainstream movie in hundreds of commercial cinemas. You don't do that if the audience demographic is only selectively small or the movie too alternative.I only bought this for a friend but now I have fallen in love with this excellent quirky Canadian drama.
