442575,A3BRSTTSIVF4ZM,6304982275,"Buyer Bob ""Online Buyer""","[0, 0]","This movie is only slightly above average, and baits you into staying tuned with occasional references to brother/sister incest. Baits, but never really delivers.And the scene of just meeting a woman, and having instant sex in a nearby alley?  Hardly believable.1940's Chicago. Clothes are Period Correct. Vehicles are standard Period Loaner Vehicles that look sparkly new, and too clean. Background scenery is Period Correct. Music is somewhat 1940's jazzy.He is certainly no Dick Powell, as Detective Philip Marlowe, in Murder My Sweet, but the copycat effort is overly obvious. It doesn't work for Zane. He's too young. Too Handsome. And too over-confident. He doesn't even look right in the suits he wears.The supporting actresses fall slightly short of being believable as well.It is hard to dog any one characteristic as being completely off, however, the overall feel is the difference between a watch-once movie, and a keeper.NOW, for the BIG disappointments, which cost this movie an additional star in my rating:The movie, which I bought here on Amazon recently, is Region 2, which for me is no issue, since I have one ALL Region Up-scaling DVD player. For those of you with regular DVD players, this won't play on your machines.BUT, the issue I hated most, is the non-removable Dutch subtitles in bold white letters on the bottom of the picture, which sometimes takes up 1/5 of the screen. When you load the DVD disk, there are no menu's. You go straight to the movie, with the subtitles. The spoken language is English.If this movie were in the 10-20 dollar range, it might be worth a purchase. IF the Dutch subtitles were removable.",3,Don't Tease Me,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1645,"['movie', 'only', 'slightly', 'above', 'average', 'staying', 'tuned', 'occasional', 'references', 'brother/sister', 'incest', 'Baits', 'never', 'really', 'delivers.And', 'scene', 'just', 'meeting', 'woman', 'having', 'instant', 'sex', 'nearby', 'alley', 'Hardly', 'believable.1940', 'Chicago', 'Clothes', 'are', 'Period', 'Correct', 'Vehicles', 'are', 'standard', 'Period', 'Loaner', 'Vehicles', 'look', 'sparkly', 'new', 'too', 'clean', 'Background', 'scenery', 'Period', 'Correct', 'Music', 'somewhat', '1940', 'jazzy.He', 'certainly', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'Detective', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'Murder', 'My', 'Sweet', 'copycat', 'effort', 'overly', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'work', 'Zane', 'too', 'young', 'Too', 'Handsome', 'too', 'over-confident', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'right', 'suits', 'wears.The', 'supporting', 'actresses', 'fall', 'slightly', 'short', 'being', 'believable', 'well.It', 'hard', 'dog', 'one', 'characteristic', 'being', 'completely', 'however', 'overall', 'feel', 'difference', 'watch-once', 'movie', 'keeper.NOW', 'BIG', 'disappointments', 'cost', 'movie', 'additional', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'bought', 'here', 'Amazon', 'recently', 'Region', '2', 'issue', 'have', 'one', 'Region', 'Up-scaling', 'DVD', 'player', 'regular', 'DVD', 'players', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'machines.BUT', 'issue', 'hated', 'most', 'non-removable', 'Dutch', 'subtitles', 'bold', 'white', 'letters', 'bottom', 'picture', 'sometimes', 'up', '1/5', 'screen', 'When', 'load', 'DVD', 'disk', 'are', 'menu', 'go', 'straight', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'spoken', 'language', 'English.If', 'movie', 'were', '10-20', 'dollar', 'range', 'might', 'be', 'purchase', 'Dutch', 'subtitles', 'were', 'removable']","This World, Then The Fireworks VHS"
442576,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6304982275,"""flickjunkie""","[20, 22]","This is not a film for everyone. It is dark, sultry, twisted and self indulgent, and that doesn't have mass appeal nowadays unless Quentin Tarantino is directing and people are shooting each other in the face. It  is, however, a terrific piece of filmmaking and as a fifties period piece  it is surpassed only by films actually made in the fifties.It is the  story of brother and sister twins who were traumatized as children and turn  out quite screwed up as adults. There is the ever present hint of incest  looming in their relationship and they are both prone to lascivious  escapades. The story serves up a slice of their lustfully demented lives  together.You almost have to be over 50 to appreciate this movie or be  someone who likes old black and white films from that era. Director Michael  Oblowitz has recreated not just the look, but the feel of the period. Tom  Priestly, who went on to be the cinematographer on ""The Thomas Crown  Affair"" did a fantastic job with filters and lighting to give the film an  authentic fifties feel. The sets, props, costumes and music were all  meticulously accurate. The use of a first person narrative (the story was  narrated by Marty [Billy Zane]) was a very popular device in 40's and 50's  films (think Humphrey Bogart).Unfortunately, the film was more form than  substance since the story was a just meandering film noir libido ride.  Still, for fifties nostalgia buffs, this is a treat.Gina Gershon was  fabulous as Carol. She was sexy, seductive, and lewd while simultaneously  being vulnerable and fragile. I can't remember seeing her in a role better  suited to her talents, nor can I remember her giving a better performance.  Billy Zane was really wrong for this part. His acting was fine, but it  failed to capture the character considering the context of the period. Men  of this period were known for their strength and impassive response to  almost everything. Naturally this would always lead to a great scene marked  by a fit of anger somewhere in the film as the pressure became too great  for him to bear. Zane was too mercurial in his portrayal of this character.  He had the male sex thing down, but he came across as shrill and defensive  in a lot of scenes, very un-fifties.Sheryl Lee gave a terrific  performance as Lois, the sex crazed lady cop who becomes obsessed with  Marty. We may never hear from her again, but for one film she grabbed the  spotlight and ran with it. She was so desperately needy and shameless in  her appetite for Marty that it seemed she couldn't live unless she was  breathing the air he just exhaled.I gave this film a 7/10. It is a 10 as  far as filmmaking and period authenticity and the story was about a 5. If  you like film noir, unabashed lust and the fifties, this movie is a must  see.",4,Brilliant Period Piece,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,2793,"['not', 'film', 'everyone', 'dark', 'sultry', 'twisted', 'indulgent', ""n't"", 'have', 'mass', 'appeal', 'nowadays', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'directing', 'people', 'are', 'shooting', 'other', 'face', 'however', 'terrific', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'fifties', 'period', 'piece', 'surpassed', 'only', 'films', 'actually', 'made', 'fifties.It', 'story', 'brother', 'sister', 'twins', 'who', 'were', 'traumatized', 'children', 'turn', 'out', 'quite', 'screwed', 'up', 'adults', 'ever', 'present', 'hint', 'incest', 'looming', 'relationship', 'are', 'prone', 'lascivious', 'escapades', 'story', 'up', 'slice', 'lustfully', 'demented', 'together.You', 'almost', 'have', 'be', '50', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'era', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Oblowitz', 'recreated', 'not', 'just', 'look', 'feel', 'period', 'Tom', 'Priestly', 'who', 'went', 'be', 'cinematographer', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'filters', 'lighting', 'give', 'film', 'authentic', 'fifties', 'feel', 'sets', 'props', 'costumes', 'music', 'were', 'meticulously', 'accurate', 'use', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'story', 'was', 'narrated', 'Marty', '[', 'Billy', 'Zane', ']', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'device', '40', '50', 'films', 'think', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', '.Unfortunately', 'film', 'was', 'more', 'form', 'substance', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'meandering', 'film', 'noir', 'libido', 'ride', 'Still', 'fifties', 'nostalgia', 'buffs', 'treat.Gina', 'Gershon', 'was', 'fabulous', 'Carol', 'was', 'sexy', 'seductive', 'lewd', 'simultaneously', 'being', 'vulnerable', 'fragile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'role', 'better', 'suited', 'talents', 'can', 'remember', 'giving', 'better', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'was', 'really', 'wrong', 'part', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'failed', 'capture', 'character', 'considering', 'context', 'period', 'Men', 'period', 'were', 'known', 'strength', 'impassive', 'response', 'almost', 'everything', 'Naturally', 'would', 'always', 'lead', 'great', 'scene', 'marked', 'fit', 'anger', 'somewhere', 'film', 'pressure', 'became', 'too', 'great', 'bear', 'Zane', 'was', 'too', 'mercurial', 'portrayal', 'character', 'had', 'male', 'sex', 'thing', 'down', 'came', 'shrill', 'defensive', 'lot', 'scenes', 'very', 'un-fifties.Sheryl', 'Lee', 'gave', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Lois', 'sex', 'crazed', 'lady', 'cop', 'who', 'obsessed', 'Marty', 'may', 'never', 'hear', 'again', 'one', 'film', 'grabbed', 'spotlight', 'ran', 'was', 'so', 'desperately', 'needy', 'shameless', 'appetite', 'Marty', 'seemed', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'was', 'breathing', 'air', 'just', 'exhaled.I', 'gave', 'film', '7/10', '10', 'as', 'far', 'filmmaking', 'period', 'authenticity', 'story', 'was', '5', 'like', 'film', 'noir', 'unabashed', 'lust', 'fifties', 'movie', 'must', 'see']","This World, Then The Fireworks VHS"

Is this some perverse fun.""I was compelled to stop to watch this primarily because it's got two of my favorite bad girl actresses Gina (Showgirls/Bound) Gershon and Sheryl Lee in it, but to my greatest surprise, it turns out to be a Jim Thompson Noir, with cynical guy voice overs and the ""each scene is a painted cover of a pulp magazine"" type of cinematography. Billy Zane plays a drifting journalist whose relationships with everyone seems a bit unhinged, to say the least, and in his mind's eye maybe he becomes the hardboiled type that is usually part of the ""True Detective"" Noirs. You wonder does he have enough hold on reality?--Or is it just how the wicked thinks. Does his sister, Carol, have any grips onreality? Or is she out to settle some scores seeing after a brutal murder and a near gang rape when she was a kid? Like some of the reviewers below noted: this is not for everyone's taste, but if you love Thompson and ia a big fan of what one cable station is calling Neo Noirs, you will love this.
