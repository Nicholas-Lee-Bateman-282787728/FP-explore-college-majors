1021581,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000IOM1FU,calvinnme,"[40, 47]","Although this season has some excellent episodes, and overall is a five star season, we begin to see the start of some of the trends that eventually becomes the downfall of the series.""A Stash From the Past"" is one of the best episodes of the season. The scene with Jackie, Roseanne, and Dan all in the bathroom together is worth the price of admission alone. Also, the Halloween episode from this season is one of the better ones, with Darlene and David pretending to be broken up and seeing other people. Roseanne finally gets bested by a Halloween prank when she walks in on what appears to be Darlene in the aftermath of having brutally murdered David's new beau. ""Homeward Bound"" is also excellent with D.J. having taken up a new hobby - one that has him tying up the bathroom for excessive periods of time. Dan has a man-to-man chat with D.J. to let him know that what he is going through is typical for a boy his age, when D.J. decides to launch a volley of questions at Dan about his new hobby. A very uncomfortable Dan informs D.J. that although this is something that everyone does, it is also not something that people talk about.""The Driver's Seat"" finally goes into more needed detail about Roseanne's troubled childhood. D.J. steals the family car, and when he is found out, Roseanne reacts by spanking him in front of Dan and Jackie. Her remorse is great, and in probably the best scene between her and D.J. of the entire series, she tells him how sorry she is and how she was hit as a child. In the background, Leon has been adding to Roseanne's stress by trumping her in decision making over at the diner. Leon wound up a partner in the diner earlier in the season in ""The Mommy's Curse"" when Bev sold her shares to Leon to get back at Roseanne for telling her how her opinions really weren't appreciated at the diner.On a similar theme, we learn more about Dan's childhood. In fact, Dan learns more about Dan's childhood in ""Lies My Father Told Me"". Up to now, we had been led to believe that Dan's father, played by the wonderful Ned Beatty, was a somewhat selfish guy, a bit of a buffoon, and a man who enjoyed his life of traveling salesman to the point that he didn't care too much about the impact it had on his family. In this episode, Dan's mother goes to a mental hospital, and Dan blames this all on his father, gets drunk, and goes over to his father and Crystal's home slinging accusations, but Dan's father is not home. Roseanne retrieves Dan, and when he sobers up she tells him the truth about his mother, how she had mental problems even before she married Dan's father. Dan breaks down crying, having an impossible time of reconciling a lifetime of opinion with the actual truth - that his Dad took Dan's disdain all of these years so Dan would have no bad feelings toward his mother. Dan goes back to his father's house to patch things up, and fixing a toaster together and watching a football game, you get the feeling that Dan may be seeing his dad through different eyes for the first time and maybe this is the beginning of them mending fences. It was a truly great episode.One of the better long arcs of the season involves Darlene hiding the fact that David is with her in Chicago, rather than in Michigan with his mother. Although it isn't stressed, I think one of the sadder scenes involving David and Darlene is in ""Thanksgiving 93"" where the Conner holiday turns out to be a disaster. David and Darlene are in Darlene's spartan college apartment dining on macaroni and cheese when David asks Darlene if she misses being home for Thanksgiving, and she says ""not really"" in a very deadpan way. This brings reality to the proverb ""Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith"", given the huge fight that is taking place back at the Conner home.Now for the parts of the season that are not so great. It seems that this is the beginning of a trend in ""Roseanne"" where men tend to be disposable. For one, Jackie becomes pregnant via a one-night stand with one of Dan's coworkers - ""Fred"". Throughout the next two seasons in which Fred appears, the show doesn't bother to give him a background of any kind such as a family or even a last name. He seems to exist simply to give Jackie a child, to make that child legitimate via a brief-as-possible marriage, and then exit Jackie's life forever at the end of season seven because Jackie says so. Also, in seasons three and four, Mark Healey, now Becky's husband, was quite the rebel with distinct ideas about everything, and frequent clashes between himself and Roseanne. When Mark and Becky return home this season, Mark has been neutered for all intents and purposes. When Roseanne discovers all is not well in their marriage, Roseanne's first instinct is to get Becky to eject Mark, although she later retreats from that position. When in previous seasons he was pictured as a pretty able mechanic, this season Mark isn't even able to make passing grades in trade school, and can only get a job when Dan gives him one at the city garage.There is also the entry of ideas and themes in the Conner household that working-class people simply just don't do on a large scale. For instance, it is ludicrous to think that with two grown children- one of which is in college- and the third and youngest child in adolescence that two people who have had to work so hard just to keep their heads above water all their adult lives would entertain having a fourth child. At this stage of life - their early forties - the Conners would likely cheer the fact that their aging bones do not have to work quite so hard just to put food on the table and want to relax a bit. Their decision for a midlife-child is more typical of the 40-something occupants of the upper west side of Manhattan than small-town Illinois.In summary, season six is a very good season when grouped with the previous five. When grouped with the last three, season six is just the beginning of the end. In fact, I think that ""Roseanne"" would be better remembered if it had ended with this season and Jackie's wedding to Fred. The problems that begin to creep up in the show in this season would not seem so great if they hadn't had three more seasons to grow to fruition and ultimately into full blown disaster.",5,"A good

I am up to Season 6.I remember as I watched the series on TV, there was a point when the series lost sight of its mission: telling the story of a working class family struggling to pay bills, but always loving each other. Often times, the love was expressed in sarcastic humor, but the love and support for each other was  always apparent.At some point there was a change in the humor. It became vicious and destructive. The support and love became hidden. This change is apparent in Season 6. The characters are mean to each other and the laugh track turns cruelty into a spectator sport.On the positive side, the writing remains good and John Goodman is a very steady, very funny Dan Conner. Ironically, Roseanne Barr Arnold becomes more glamorous looking as the motorcycle business fails, and the Conners have no money to send Becky to college. These are real life tragedies. The peripheral characters are animated by talented actors. These characters are the truth-tellers: Nancy and David.In general everything intensifies in Roseanne VI:Roseanne becomes a first class shrew; she delivers her lines as a loud, spoiled teenagerJackie becomes increasingly neurotic, very withdrawn and almost paranoid.Dan has become resigned to the fact that he has no power in his marriage or his householdDarlene(my favorite character)is emotionally sadistic to anyone who shows her vulnerability.DJ has learned opportunism and bullying as a lifestyleNew Becky has left as old Becky and returned 6 inches tallerMark remains the moronic punkAll of them: A very intense lack of tolerance for each other.",3,A turn for the worse,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,1670,"['love', 'entire', 'series', 'Currently', 'am', 'watching', 'videos', 'season', 'season', 'am', 'up', 'Season', '6.I', 'remember', 'watched', 'series', 'TV', 'was', 'point', 'when', 'series', 'lost', 'sight', 'mission', 'telling', 'story', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'struggling', 'pay', 'bills', 'always', 'loving', 'other', 'Often', 'love', 'was', 'expressed', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'love', 'support', 'other', 'was', 'always', 'apparent.At', 'point', 'was', 'change', 'humor', 'became', 'vicious', 'destructive', 'support', 'love', 'became', 'hidden', 'change', 'apparent', 'Season', '6', 'characters', 'are', 'mean', 'other', 'laugh', 'track', 'cruelty', 'spectator', 'sport.On', 'positive', 'side', 'writing', 'good', 'John', 'Goodman', 'very', 'steady', 'very', 'funny', 'Dan', 'Conner', 'Ironically', 'Roseanne', 'Barr', 'Arnold', 'more', 'glamorous', 'looking', 'motorcycle', 'business', 'fails', 'Conners', 'have', 'money', 'send', 'Becky', 'college', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'tragedies', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'are', 'animated', 'talented', 'actors', 'characters', 'are', 'truth-tellers', 'Nancy', 'David.In', 'general', 'everything', 'intensifies', 'Roseanne', 'VI', 'Roseanne', 'first', 'class', 'shrew', 'lines', 'loud', 'spoiled', 'teenagerJackie', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'neurotic', 'very', 'withdrawn', 'almost', 'paranoid.Dan', 'become', 'resigned', 'fact', 'power', 'marriage', 'householdDarlene', 'favorite', 'character', 'emotionally', 'sadistic', 'anyone', 'who', 'vulnerability.DJ', 'learned', 'opportunism', 'bullying', 'lifestyleNew', 'Becky', 'left', 'old', 'Becky', 'returned', '6', 'inches', 'tallerMark', 'moronic', 'punkAll', 'very', 'intense', 'lack', 'tolerance', 'other']",Roseanne: Season 6

1021592,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000IOM1FU,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[20, 23]","Season six of Roseanne is probably the most rewarding season on DVD to date - the actors are finally established in their roles, the situations and scenarios are more polished and fleshed-out and the scripts are tighter than before (not to say that seasons 1 thru 5 are bad: quite the opposite, they're great, and I own them all - as should you!!).This season is notable for a number of reasons: it sees the beginnings of the considerable comedy talent of Sarah Chalke, a more likeable and accessible Becky than Lecy Goranson of previous seasons, the characters of Mark and David (particularly the latter) are given more screen time and better storylines, the nature of the relationship between Bev and her daughters becomes more multidimensional and more rewarding to watch, and the return of Leon makes for some hilarious one-liners.Actually, hilarity abounds in this season, which contains almost all of my favourite Roseanne moments: Bev's sex accident and her reaction to Dan and Fred's knowlege of it (an undeniable television comedy classic, fans!!), DJ discovering puberty (Darlene's line about this has stayed with me forever!!), Jackie's wedding to Fisher and the preceeding epsiode where everyone thinks she has a crush on Dan, Nana Mary's line to Fred about how he impregnated Jackie... and the list goes on and on.Similarly, the poignant moments in this season are much stronger and believable than before, with the most notable being in the episode ""Lies My Father Told Me"", where John Goodman's reading of a man coming to terms with his mother's mental illness is absolutely whole and very, very affecting.This is definitely a wonderful season of an outstanding television comedy, but take my advice: if you haven't got any of them yet, start with Season One. Unlike some of its TV Sitcom-to-DVD peers, the continuity in ""Roseanne"" is strong, and it'd be a shame not to know the background for some of the characters and stories in this excellent collection of episodes.Highly recommended.",4,Hee hee!,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,2004,"['Season', 'six', 'Roseanne', 'probably', 'most', 'rewarding', 'season', 'DVD', 'date', 'actors', 'are', 'finally', 'established', 'roles', 'situations', 'scenarios', 'are', 'more', 'polished', 'fleshed-out', 'scripts', 'are', 'tighter', 'before', 'not', 'say', 'seasons', '1', 'thru', '5', 'are', 'bad', 'quite', 'opposite', ""'re"", 'great', 'own', 'should', '.This', 'season', 'notable', 'number', 'reasons', 'beginnings', 'considerable', 'comedy', 'talent', 'Sarah', 'Chalke', 'more', 'likeable', 'accessible', 'Becky', 'Lecy', 'Goranson', 'previous', 'seasons', 'characters', 'Mark', 'David', 'particularly', 'latter', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'better', 'storylines', 'nature', 'relationship', 'Bev', 'daughters', 'more', 'multidimensional', 'more', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'return', 'Leon', 'hilarious', 'one-liners.Actually', 'hilarity', 'abounds', 'season', 'almost', 'favourite', 'Roseanne', 'moments', 'Bev', 'sex', 'accident', 'reaction', 'Dan', 'Fred', 'knowlege', 'undeniable', 'television', 'comedy', 'classic', 'fans', 'DJ', 'discovering', 'puberty', 'Darlene', 'line', 'stayed', 'forever', 'Jackie', 'wedding', 'Fisher', 'preceeding', 'epsiode', 'where', 'everyone', 'crush', 'Dan', 'Nana', 'Mary', 'line', 'Fred', 'how', 'impregnated', 'Jackie', 'list', 'on.Similarly', 'poignant', 'moments', 'season', 'are', 'much', 'stronger', 'believable', 'before', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'episode', 'Lies', 'My', 'Father', 'Told', 'Me', 'where', 'John', 'Goodman', 'reading', 'man', 'coming', 'terms', 'mother', 'mental', 'illness', 'absolutely', 'whole', 'very', 'very', 'affecting.This', 'definitely', 'wonderful', 'season', 'outstanding', 'television', 'comedy', 'take', 'advice', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'yet', 'start', 'Season', 'One', 'TV', 'Sitcom-to-DVD', 'peers', 'continuity', 'Roseanne', 'strong', ""'d"", 'be', 'shame', 'not', 'know', 'background', 'characters', 'stories', 'excellent', 'collection', 'episodes.Highly', 'recommended']",Roseanne: Season 6

Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[4, 7]","Usually after 5 seasons a show can lose it's luster, but Roseanne's sixth season was truly one of the best, and the Domestic Goddess Roseanne was at her most beautiful!!!! She should have been the poster child for what a person should look like after having multiple plastic surgeries, because she just looked so damn fabulous!!!I really enjoyed the new direction of the show, starting with more focuss on the adults instead of the kids all the time. This season definately challenged Roseanne to tackle some tough issues like child abuse( I think this subject will always be a heated debate due to the fine line of physical discipline and abuse)Roseanne seemed way too hard on herself, because she never hit DJ before and like Dan said he had it coming, considering what he had done.John Goodman also had a chance to shine this season when coming to grips with the truth behind his mother's mental illness. This episode was definately reminiscent of the way Norman Lear would do an episode of All in the Family when the scene would be so intense with emotion with no sound from a live audience and it forces you to really feel in the moment.This was definately a good mix of comedy and drama during season 6, where Roseanne, Dan, and Jackie was at their prime!!! My favorite episode would have to be when Jackie has her baby, because usually those kind of episodes are so stale with the panicked father to be in a bunch of chaos.Fortunately this episode was well written and brilliantly funny!!!!Eventhough most people think Roseanne's remaining seasons went downhill, I will still buy them because they are alot better than the trash that's on tv now!!!",5,AN OUTSTANDING SEASON!!!
