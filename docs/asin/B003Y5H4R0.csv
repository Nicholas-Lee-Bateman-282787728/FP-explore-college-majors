1371309,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B003Y5H4R0,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","I really enjoyed this movie.  However, my expectations were aligned with its reality, and this helped.  I think some people expect something different than what this actually is, and end up disappointed.  Let me set it straight to help you understand what to expect.IMHO, this movie is first and foremost a human movie about human emotions and struggle.  Yes, its about a crime family who commits terrible acts, but the focus is on the emotions and turmoil these individuals experience as they commit crimes and ultimately attempt to evade justice.  Perhaps the best part is the teenager boy who is essentially adopted by the crime family (headed by his grandmother) after his mother dies.  He presents the perfect study for this movie - he is almost completely numb to the world.  His mother ODs, he knows no real relationships, and barely has emotions.  How he changes, and comes to struggle with his sense of dedication to the family vs morality as the movie progresses is highly engaging.  Further, Guy Pierce plays the lead cop, somewhat reprising his LA Confidential role, perfectly.  He plays a bit of mental cat and mouse with the family, including the teen boy, as he tries to get the boy to expose his family's crimes.  Brilliant acting.Bottom line this movie is about drama.  Don't expect a lot of action scenes, or visceral violence.  Expect visceral emotions and outstanding character development and acting.Also, this is an australian film short, presumably, in australia with australian actors.  Unlike many aussie films I've seen, the production values on this one are outstanding. Its a high quality image, well done cinematography, etc.  Its probably outstanding on blu ray.Very highly recommended.",4,"Outstanding, Emotionally Palpable Movie",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,1716,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'However', 'expectations', 'were', 'aligned', 'reality', 'helped', 'think', 'people', 'expect', 'something', 'different', 'what', 'actually', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed', 'Let', 'set', 'straight', 'help', 'understand', 'what', 'expect.IMHO', 'movie', 'first', 'foremost', 'human', 'movie', 'human', 'emotions', 'struggle', 'Yes', 'crime', 'family', 'who', 'terrible', 'acts', 'focus', 'emotions', 'turmoil', 'individuals', 'experience', 'commit', 'crimes', 'ultimately', 'attempt', 'evade', 'justice', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'teenager', 'boy', 'who', 'essentially', 'adopted', 'crime', 'family', 'headed', 'grandmother', 'mother', 'dies', 'perfect', 'study', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'numb', 'world', 'mother', 'ODs', 'real', 'relationships', 'barely', 'emotions', 'How', 'struggle', 'sense', 'dedication', 'family', 'vs', 'morality', 'movie', 'highly', 'engaging', 'Further', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'lead', 'cop', 'somewhat', 'reprising', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'role', 'perfectly', 'bit', 'mental', 'cat', 'mouse', 'family', 'including', 'teen', 'boy', 'get', 'boy', 'expose', 'family', 'crimes', 'Brilliant', 'acting.Bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'drama', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'action', 'scenes', 'visceral', 'violence', 'Expect', 'visceral', 'emotions', 'outstanding', 'character', 'development', 'acting.Also', 'australian', 'film', 'short', 'presumably', 'australia', 'australian', 'actors', 'many', 'aussie', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'production', 'values', 'one', 'are', 'outstanding', 'high', 'quality', 'image', 'well', 'done', 'cinematography', 'etc', 'probably', 'outstanding', 'blu', 'ray.Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1371310,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003Y5H4R0,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","A film that truly oozes bravado and foams at the mouth with aggression, `Animal Kingdom' is just as the title would suggest; ferocious.  With an ample cast that sinks into every scene with intensity and complete control of their character and their purpose, there are few films that leave as lasting an impression as this Australian crime drama; certainly one of the best in its breed.  From the opening sequence (chilling was an appropriate word to describe it) to the epic finale, which is effectively anti-climactic in all its climactic glory, `Animal Kingdom' is a nearly flawless plunge into the slippery depths of grit, grime and survival.Opening with a heroin overdose, we are introduced to our protagonist; seventeen year-old J.  Being sheltered most his life from his mother's family, J is forced to acquaint himself with them now that his mother is, well, dead on the couch.  Taken in and nurtured instantly by his grandmother Smurf, J is welcomed and inducted into the Cody's life of crime.  As a near silent observer, J narrates with a coldness that adds to the emotional stagnancy of the Cody's way of life.  They compose themselves in an odd portrayal of familial affections, but the selfish tendencies betray their faade and show their true colors to all who dare pay attention.  As the Cody's life of crime starts to creep up on them, the FBI begins to close in around them, using violent actions in order to flush out the man they are really after; big brother Pope.  When they get their paws on J, panic sets in around the Cody family, and trust becomes somewhat of a fleeting commodity as Pope begins to plot against J in an effort to save his own skin.  With a kindly FBI agent attempting to help young J make the right choice, and a brooding family attempting to `shut him up', J is stuck between a rock and a hard place and must eventually go against his very nature to make the `right' decision for his own well-being; a decision that will shock you to your core.`Animal Kingdom' is one of those rare films that gets it.  It really understands how to layer everything in a way that makes this film a rarity and a true `find'.  It is engrossing and entertaining and unforgettable, all the while maintaining a sharp sense of poignancy that makes this an `important' film as much as it is a cinematically satisfying one.  It is bleak in moments and truly savage in others, but overall the film gives us a sick sense of hope in the future of young J.The characters truly bleed on the screen, each actor doing his utmost to develop these people before our very eyes.  Jacki Weaver is fantastic as Smurf, a woman whose faade of kindness is corroded by her self-serving sense of familial loyalty.  James Frenchville is also wonderful as J.  Purposfully vacant, Frenchville allows his character to simmer while the others around him combust, making his final decision all the more effective.  Ben Mendelsohn is superbly used as the chilling Pope; a performance that will take your breath away.For me though, the real star is director David Michod, who uses a keen eye for detail and a sharp sense of action oriented dramatics to keep hold of the tension and release the dogs so-to-speak, attacking the audience with a ferocity not often seen in cinema today.  Considering that this outstanding film is Michod's debut feature, I'd say that this guy's future is looking quite promising.",5,Grit your teeth and bare it...,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,3399,"['film', 'truly', 'bravado', 'foams', 'mouth', 'aggression', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'just', 'title', 'would', 'suggest', 'ferocious', 'ample', 'cast', 'scene', 'intensity', 'complete', 'control', 'character', 'purpose', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Australian', 'crime', 'drama', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'breed', 'opening', 'sequence', 'chilling', 'was', 'appropriate', 'word', 'describe', 'epic', 'finale', 'effectively', 'anti-climactic', 'climactic', 'glory', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'plunge', 'slippery', 'depths', 'grit', 'grime', 'survival.Opening', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'are', 'introduced', 'protagonist', 'seventeen', 'year-old', 'J', 'Being', 'sheltered', 'most', 'life', 'mother', 'family', 'J', 'forced', 'acquaint', 'now', 'mother', 'well', 'dead', 'couch', 'Taken', 'nurtured', 'instantly', 'grandmother', 'Smurf', 'J', 'welcomed', 'inducted', 'Cody', 'life', 'crime', 'near', 'silent', 'observer', 'J', 'coldness', 'emotional', 'stagnancy', 'Cody', 'way', 'life', 'compose', 'odd', 'portrayal', 'familial', 'affections', 'selfish', 'tendencies', 'betray', 'faade', 'show', 'true', 'colors', 'who', 'dare', 'pay', 'attention', 'Cody', 'life', 'crime', 'starts', 'creep', 'up', 'FBI', 'close', 'using', 'violent', 'actions', 'order', 'flush', 'out', 'man', 'are', 'really', 'big', 'brother', 'Pope', 'When', 'get', 'paws', 'J', 'panic', 'sets', 'Cody', 'family', 'trust', 'becomes', 'somewhat', 'fleeting', 'commodity', 'Pope', 'plot', 'J', 'effort', 'save', 'own', 'skin', 'kindly', 'FBI', 'agent', 'attempting', 'help', 'young', 'J', 'make', 'right', 'choice', 'brooding', 'family', 'attempting', 'shut', 'up', 'J', 'stuck', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'must', 'eventually', 'go', 'very', 'nature', 'make', 'right', 'decision', 'own', 'well-being', 'decision', 'will', 'shock', 'core.', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'really', 'how', 'layer', 'everything', 'way', 'film', 'rarity', 'true', 'find', 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'unforgettable', 'while', 'maintaining', 'sharp', 'sense', 'poignancy', 'important', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'cinematically', 'satisfying', 'one', 'bleak', 'moments', 'truly', 'savage', 'others', 'film', 'sick', 'sense', 'hope', 'future', 'young', 'J.The', 'characters', 'truly', 'bleed', 'screen', 'actor', 'doing', 'utmost', 'develop', 'people', 'very', 'eyes', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'fantastic', 'Smurf', 'woman', 'faade', 'kindness', 'corroded', 'self-serving', 'sense', 'familial', 'loyalty', 'James', 'Frenchville', 'also', 'wonderful', 'J.', 'Purposfully', 'vacant', 'Frenchville', 'character', 'simmer', 'others', 'combust', 'making', 'final', 'decision', 'more', 'effective', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'superbly', 'used', 'chilling', 'Pope', 'performance', 'will', 'take', 'breath', 'real', 'star', 'director', 'David', 'Michod', 'who', 'keen', 'eye', 'detail', 'sharp', 'sense', 'action', 'oriented', 'dramatics', 'keep', 'hold', 'tension', 'release', 'dogs', 'so-to-speak', 'attacking', 'audience', 'ferocity', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'cinema', 'today', 'Considering', 'outstanding', 'film', 'Michod', 'debut', 'feature', ""'d"", 'say', 'guy', 'future', 'looking', 'quite', 'promising']",N/A

I just wish the director could delves deeper into the mind of the grandson and deepen his perspectives around what is happening between the grandmother and his uncles. I keep on waiting for the characters to be fleshed out much more. But the film just merely touches the surface. It's like an unfinished movie.

1371312,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003Y5H4R0,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[4, 4]","Continuing my journey of late with Australian films (see my post on The Black Balloon), I just watched Animal Kingdom (2010) on Blu-ray this past week. Set and filmed in Melbourne, Australia, Animal Kingdom is a family crime drama along the lines of Heat (1995), The Town (2010), The Departed (2007), Point Break (1991), and Donnie Brasco (1999). But it's a unique take on the genre from an Australian point of view. It even brings a bit of The Sopranos into the mix. First time writer/director David Michd clearly brings his great love of crime dramas to bear with this story. While not as flashy and engaging as the classic movies I reference above, Animal Kingdom still brings a lot of interesting character study to the table. I give the film 3 stars out of 5.Newcomer James Frecheville plays 'J', a 17-year old teenager who is forced to live with his extended family due to the death of his mother from a drug overdose. Turns out his family is filled with criminals led by his sweet but sinister matriarchal grandmother Janine, played with interesting finesse by Aussie actress Jacki Weaver. J moves in with his grandmother and her 3 sons, J's uncles, played by Ben Mendelsohn, Luke Ford, and Sullivan Stapleton, who waste no time bringing J into the family business. Also part of this mix is Joel Edgerton, as a fellow bank robber and friend of Mendelsohn's character ""Pope"". Without giving too much of the story away, J goes through some growing pains as he deals with his new life in this different kind of family. As one of the detectives after Pope and the rest of his family, Guy Pierce's ""Leckie"" wants to save J from a life of crime under the control of his grandmother. But what does J want?Animal Kingdom is a fairly slow moving movie, spending a lot of time getting us into the inner familial workings and mindsets of this Melbourne crime family. We don't really see any of the crimes that this band of brothers normally commits, just a small retaliation against the police. While this is interesting, much like the typical modern crime drama, this is probably where I felt Animal Kingdom was the weakest. While bank robberies, drug deals, and other criminal acts have been shown over and over in movies and television shows, I think its because we as viewers like seeing the adrenaline rush and camaraderie that comes with those activities. It helps pick up the pace and give us stakes. Since Animal Kingdom basically lacks that adrenaline, it never really got me into the story to where I cared emotionally all that much about this crime family. Still, the Cody family is interesting and the actors do a great job of each representing their characters. Where I think a bank robbery or two would've helped is in tying these various characters together for me. Instead, we mostly watch the slow deterioration of each of them as the film goes on.The cinematography and production design both stand out on Animal Kingdom. I loved the house where the Cody's reside, and the various sets and locations all add flavor to the film. Probably the strongest part of the production is the music by composer Antony Partos. The score for this film has a deep haunting and eery feel that gives the movie depth and tone that really helps tell the story. There are two scenes where music is front and center, with no dialogue and just visuals, and both really worked for me on an emotional level. I just wish there was more of that throughout the film and in the characters. Emotion is one of the key ingredients of film, television, and any storytelling for that matter. While there's a fine line between too much and too little emotion, Animal Kingdom could have benefitted from a little more in my opinion. But overall, it's a well made Aussie Indie film that is definitely worth seeing on Blu-ray. Ironically, my favorite parts of the Animal Kingdom experience were listening to and watching director David Michd talk about the making of the film in the audio commentary and the special features. Michd is a very sharp and caring filmmaker whose depth of soul really comes through in his discussions of his craft. Hopefully he'll bring more of himself to his next film.",3,"Not Michael Mann's 'Heat', but an interesting Aussie take on the Crime Drama",1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,4174,"['Continuing', 'journey', 'late', 'Australian', 'films', 'see', 'post', 'Black', 'Balloon', 'just', 'watched', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', '2010', 'Blu-ray', 'past', 'week', 'Set', 'filmed', 'Melbourne', 'Australia', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'family', 'crime', 'drama', 'lines', 'Heat', '1995', 'Town', '2010', 'Departed', '2007', 'Point', 'Break', '1991', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', '1999', 'unique', 'take', 'genre', 'Australian', 'point', 'view', 'even', 'bit', 'Sopranos', 'mix', 'First', 'time', 'writer/director', 'David', 'Michd', 'clearly', 'great', 'love', 'crime', 'dramas', 'bear', 'story', 'not', 'flashy', 'engaging', 'classic', 'movies', 'reference', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'still', 'lot', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'table', 'give', 'film', '3', 'stars', '5.Newcomer', 'James', 'Frecheville', 'J', '17-year', 'old', 'teenager', 'who', 'forced', 'live', 'extended', 'family', 'due', 'death', 'mother', 'drug', 'overdose', 'out', 'family', 'filled', 'criminals', 'led', 'sweet', 'sinister', 'matriarchal', 'grandmother', 'Janine', 'played', 'interesting', 'finesse', 'Aussie', 'actress', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'J', 'grandmother', '3', 'sons', 'J', 'uncles', 'played', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'Luke', 'Ford', 'Sullivan', 'Stapleton', 'who', 'time', 'bringing', 'J', 'family', 'business', 'Also', 'part', 'mix', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'fellow', 'bank', 'robber', 'friend', 'Mendelsohn', 'character', 'Pope', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'J', 'growing', 'pains', 'new', 'life', 'different', 'kind', 'family', 'one', 'detectives', 'Pope', 'rest', 'family', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'Leckie', 'save', 'J', 'life', 'crime', 'control', 'grandmother', 'what', 'J', 'want', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'fairly', 'slow', 'moving', 'movie', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'getting', 'inner', 'familial', 'workings', 'mindsets', 'Melbourne', 'crime', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'crimes', 'band', 'brothers', 'normally', 'commits', 'just', 'small', 'retaliation', 'police', 'interesting', 'much', 'typical', 'modern', 'crime', 'drama', 'probably', 'where', 'felt', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'was', 'weakest', 'bank', 'robberies', 'drug', 'deals', 'other', 'criminal', 'acts', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'think', 'because', 'viewers', 'seeing', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'camaraderie', 'activities', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'give', 'stakes', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'basically', 'adrenaline', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'story', 'where', 'cared', 'emotionally', 'that', 'much', 'crime', 'family', 'Still', 'Cody', 'family', 'interesting', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'representing', 'characters', 'Where', 'think', 'bank', 'robbery', 'two', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'tying', 'various', 'characters', 'together', 'Instead', 'mostly', 'watch', 'slow', 'deterioration', 'film', 'on.The', 'cinematography', 'production', 'design', 'stand', 'out', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'loved', 'house', 'where', 'Cody', 'reside', 'various', 'sets', 'locations', 'add', 'flavor', 'film', 'Probably', 'strongest', 'part', 'production', 'music', 'composer', 'Antony', 'Partos', 'score', 'film', 'deep', 'haunting', 'eery', 'feel', 'movie', 'depth', 'tone', 'really', 'tell', 'story', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'music', 'front', 'center', 'dialogue', 'just', 'visuals', 'really', 'worked', 'emotional', 'level', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'film', 'characters', 'Emotion', 'one', 'key', 'ingredients', 'film', 'television', 'storytelling', 'matter', 'fine', 'line', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'emotion', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'little', 'more', 'opinion', 'overall', 'well', 'made', 'Aussie', 'Indie', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Blu-ray', 'Ironically', 'favorite', 'parts', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'experience', 'were', 'listening', 'watching', 'director', 'David', 'Michd', 'talk', 'making', 'film', 'audio', 'commentary', 'special', 'features', 'Michd', 'very', 'sharp', 'caring', 'filmmaker', 'depth', 'soul', 'really', 'through', 'discussions', 'craft', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'bring', 'more', 'next', 'film']",N/A
1371313,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B003Y5H4R0,Brian Maitland,"[0, 0]","This crime family drama set in Melbourne, Australia, lacks a focus. You'd think it wouldn't given the whole thing revolves around a super dysfunctional family of armed robbers unable to deal with the changing crime scene (one now where the money is in dealing drugs not robbing banks) in their community.What is wrong with the whole thing is it's obvious these criminals have been at this life a while yet they (SPOILER ALERTS start now) go and kill two policemen as a revenge killing. Surely, they realized the consequences of their actions. I just didn't get that move as this crime family is no organized Cosa Nostra at all.The other weak link is the lead actor. He walks around sloven shouldered and talks so monotone and what seems uninterested in his own fate as if he's a zombie. The kid is 17 years old and I get that but his performance is so low key it's all the wrong tone for this movie. Not that I want him ranting and whining like a typical teenage lunatic but the fact once he figures out that his girlfriend is murdered by these family members he ""trusted"" to some extent, he seems like an emotionless robot. He even goes over to her house and invites himself in for a bit of a cry in their bathroom. Really? It never occurred to the guy to run for the hills?Having said all that, the other performances are terrific. The matriarch who is the grandmother to the young lead, has probably the most incestuous kissing scenes in film history. It's downright creepy the way she kisses her sons and it's worse the way she off-handingly puts out a hit on her own grandson later in the story.There is a token Guy Pearce in this and his role is not all that major. I'm sure his moustache is just in it to sell the movie to a wider audience as he's the only ""name"" actor us on this side of the Pacific will recognize. He is very good in his role as a ""could be corrupt but we're not 100% sure"" cop.The use of silence in the movie does work and is the sign of a truly great director. Honestly, if they injected just a tad more life into the lead and tightened up the whole story, this is a five-star movie.Now the extras feature an over hour long look at how they put the movie together. I actually found that way more interesting and the director a really passionate guy about his work.

David Michod's Animal Kingdom is just such a film. On its face its an Australian crime drama but in its execution it is so much more. The film concerns the disintegration of a family of robbers in Melbourne as seen through the eyes of a seventeen year old family member.Despite being no saint herself, Julia Cody has shielded her seventeen year old son, Joshua ""J"" Cody (James Frecheville), from her Melbourne-based criminal relatives who they have not seen in years. After Julia dies in front of J's eyes from a self-inflicted heroin overdose, J, who is slightly detached from life, feels he has no choice but to contact his maternal grandmother, Janine ""Smurf"" Cody(Jacki Weaver), the family matriarch, for a place to live. Smurf rules the family with a borderline incestuous love over her three sons, the quietly menacing Andrew ""Pope"" Cody (Ben Mendelsohn), the hyperactive Craig Cody(Sullivan Stapleton), and the barely of age Darren Cody(Luke Ford). Pope and his best friend, Barry ""Baz"" Brown (Joel Edgerton), are armed robbers, with Darren their up and coming apprentice, while Craig is a mid level drug dealer. Melbourne's Armed Robbery Squad is after specifically Pope, who is hiding out. But when the standoff between the Codys and the Armed Robbery Squad is brought up a notch by the killing of Barry Brown, an all out war ensues, with some two police officers dead and J caught in the middle. The only grounding in J's life is his girlfriend, Nicky Henry. With the killing comes an investigation by Homicide Detective Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie(Guy Pearce), who knows the Codys are involved in some of those deaths. As Leckie tries to get J on his side, J has to figure out how best to get himself out from the middle, where he trusts neither side. J also wants to figure out how to exact what he considers justice in an all around bad situationThe film has a great script by Michod that feels natural and even better performances by Weaver and Mendelsohn. Putting all these things together this is a difficult but wonderful viewing experience. If you don't see many Australian films this is a great place to start.The Blu Ray I screened this on featured a great group of extras also.

Unfortunately, many artists today - in this case the director and writer David Michod - think their goal should be to show that ""everything in society is bad,"" but to do so with high technical polish. Can someone explain to me why is it that, with all the interesting adventures people have in life, crime is thought to be the only story dramatic enough for the movies?The acting is excellent, the photography is excellent, the production is excellent - but the content is unrelievedly depressing, negative and black. There is one heroine overdose death, four gunshot murders, one strangulation of an innocent teenage girl, corrupt police, and hints of incestuous sexual behavior in the first hour. And don't look for a happy ending either; the last act is a fifth gunshot murder. Oh, did I forget the psychopath? The cocaine abuse? The general air of fear and menace? After you watch this, you may want to get some counselling. Or perhaps go out to a movie.

They're quick and much of what happens tends to be underlined. This is not at all the case with ""The Animal Kingdom."" Much of what happens here builds tension by understating, not overstating, the events.Here's the scoop. You have a small family of hoods (brothers and cousins) who pull off mostly bank jobs. Mom likes being around her boys and supports them in what they do. Their jobs become increasingly more violent and the police are out in earnest to take them down. The police overstep their bounds and everything deteriorates from there.This feels very real. Nothing is too clever. The jobs are straight forward and the family seems no different than your next door neighbors. The police (though they perform one horrific act) do their due diligence in investigating and playing whatever cards they need to try and put the boys behind bars. Mum is one of the real interesting characters. She loves her boys and has been around the block a few times. She knows what she needs to do to set things right and get her boys off the hook.Guy Pearce and Joel Edgerton were the only two actors I knew and both do a fine job. Jacki Weaver is great as the mom and Ben Mendelsohn is good and creepy as the erstwhile head of the family. He delivers some lines which make you wonder how screwed up he might really be.

It is a frightening tale of crime and corruption, of one family of criminal sociopaths both pitted against and partnered by the police in Melbourne, Australia. Though the film wanders times, altering past and present in a manner that proves confusing to the whole, the impact in the end is stunning.Joshua ""J"" Cody (James Frecheville) narrates the film and we first meet this young 17-year-old sitting beside his mother who has just died from an overdose of  heroin. In a most detached way he calls his maternal grandmother Smurf (Jacki Weaver) and asks if she remembers him: his mother has been estranged from her family for years.  Smurf welcomes his call and complies with his desire to move to her home.  And what a home she runs!  Smurf's sons are sociopathic criminals on the run from the law (but also involved with the law in the illegal sale of drugs with bad cops). The worst offender is Pope (Ben Mendelsohn) who is the brains behind the crimes the family commits: he is also on medication for his mental challenge.  The other two brothers are drug-addled Craig (Sullivan Stapleton) and the strange very young Darren (Luke Ford). Pope's best friend in crime is  the rather tender Baz (Joel Edgerton) with whom J can relate.  J is thus thrust into the family he has not known and becomes reluctantly involved with the criminal shenanigans and killings of Smurf's boys. Smurf has a bizarre relationship with her 'gang' of sons, seemingly kind and protective but with a surprising evil side of her own.  As the story progresses J is caught between the family and the police - in the form of Investigator Leckie (Guy Pearce, in another memorable role) - and the story deals with how this contrasting set of circumstances molds the young J.There isn't a weak link in the cast and after viewing the film it is understandable why Jacki Weaver was nominated for an Oscar.  This is a different sort of crime drama and the flavor of the Australian setting adds immeasurably to the mood.

They also have another brother who apparently wandered in from the set for ""The Lovely Bones"" (rejected for the Stanely Tucci part).There is nothing suspenseful or sinister about this movie or clan of characters. The only tension is on the soundtrack; some pinched strings. These clowns never do anything. They are as threatening as the guys in ""Pineapple Express"".This movie is like a Marx Brothers comedy. The plots lines are dropped, the narrative flies all over the place, people say and do the dumbest things... you cant imagine. The main character is Harpo Marx; because he never speaks, he is mute. There is a ""cute"" brother (Zeppo), a ringleader (Groucho) and a follower (Chico)... and in this case an extra brother, the Pedophile.The first part of the movie concerns the family hiding the Pedophile from the police because they ""have the goods on him"". When the police close in in him, they turn and blast Groucho with red paintballs. The one they have been chasing, they let walk away. The Pedophile is so upset, he gets the other two brothers to blast a couple of cops with red paintball guns. The police then have no trouble bringing the Pedophile into the station but they let him go.Understand this: the whole movie so far has been about the police trying to apprehend this guy, they kill his brother instead (for no reason), they catch him and they let him go. Got it? Up to speed? Now the movie becomes about the police trying to use Harpo to testify against his brothers. Except: he doesn't really know anything. I mean, he really doesn't know anything. He is absolutely totally useless as a witness because... he doesn't know anything.It goes on and on with characters doing the dumbest things you don't really want to know. (This person is innocent so I will kill them. This person is trying to kill me, I will go visit them.) Jackie Weaver has gotten a lot of press about her role. Her character is cut from the same cloth as Rose Tyler's mom in Doctor Who (""sexy"", overweight, blond bimbo with raccoon eyes).

Liking great performances in interesting looking films, I purchased the dvd and was pleasantly surprised.  This is one terrific crime drama with equally terrific peformances.  Jacki Weaver not only deserved her Oscar nom but in my opinion should have taken home the Academy Award, she was that good.  The rest of the cast was impressive as well, but it was Ben Mendelsohn whom I thought was the real standout.  From the moment he appears on screen he catches your attention, and I for one was mesmerized by his performance as ""Pope,"" one of the more intriguing screen criminals in recent memory.  There's one particular favorite scene of mine, with an Air Supply music video playing over it, wherein Mendelsohn doesn't utter a word, and barely moves, yet terrifies with his mere presence and stare.  He is chilling here and throughout.  Aside from the performances I liked the fact that this was a crime drama that focused more upon the criminal family than the deeds they perpetrated which led to their reputation.  With one notable exception that sets off a violent chain of events, those deeds are not shown and I think the movie is the better for it.

1371337,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003Y5H4R0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","A surprisingly understated gem, Australia's ""Animal Kingdom"" is more adept at showcasing the psychological dissolution of a crime family than being a gung-ho action picture. In his choices, writer/director David Michod has produced a unique film that combines elements of a character study within the structure of a domestic drama. Placing that domestic drama inside a criminal family in flux, in decline and in desperation provides a slow build urgency to the film that causes the suspense to rise exponentially as the film proceeds. Effectively employing a moral ambiguity to his central protagonist, Michod creates a complex family unit that alternately protects its own or, if need be, devours the weakest. I loved the quiet intensity throughout and appreciated the thoughtful characterizations that made the ""Animal Kingdom"" an effective study of humans pushed to the edge.The film is centered around James Frecheville, a rather passive seventeen year old that comes to live with his grandmother (Jackie Weaver) when his mother overdoses. Unbeknownst to him, his mother has shielded him from a family that lives outside the limits of the law. Frecheville, however, seems content to play a marginal role within the family enterprise as it garners him acceptance and connectivity. As the police, led by Guy Pearce, start to close in on the various members of the group--a splinter starts to form that will eventually rend everyone apart. The further the film progresses, the larger the body count until everyone left is scrambling in desperation mode for survival. The film is exceedingly well acted. Weaver is cool and cheerful even at her most treacherous. Sullivan Stapleton is terrifically unhinged as Uncle Craig, Joel Edgerton is astutely level headed as Uncle Barry, and Luke Ford is surprisingly sympathetic as the over-his-head Uncle Darren. But aside from Weaver's subversive villainy, it's a manic Ben Mendelsohn that provides real menace throughout ""Animal Kingdom.""If anything keeps the film from being perfect, for me, it's the naive and passive Frecheville. He never elicited much sympathy or empathy and pairing him with a girlfriend who was equally foolish didn't help matters. In many ways, you know the young couple is doomed--but it merely seems like they brought it upon themselves with their patent refusal to acknowledge what is going on before their eyes. Still, ""Animal Kingdom"" packs a powerfully hard edge. The film is thoroughly entertaining and works as an intellectual thriller, not as a shoot-em-up. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of well placed violence in ""Animal Kingdom.""  The film, however, revels in the choices that people must make in extreme circumstances. And, in the end, it's all about survival instinct. I really loved this movie.

The traumatized, nearly-mute boy is quickly drawn into their brutal world and is soon helping them.  A kindly police detective tries to reach out to the boy, but Ben may already be beyond help.This Australian drama is gritty, grim, and very intense.  Watching this innocent boy getting sucked deeper and deeper into the crime world is depressing indeed.  The character-driven movie is very well-made; all the actors are frighteningly convincing.

But it should be 90 minutes long to have the visceral impact it wants to achieve. The close-ups start lingering a little too long, the fades last a little too long, and before I knew it I was thinking, this movie is a little too long. Which of course takes you out of the film's world, bleak though that world may be.The acting is good and sometimes great, especially from Jacki Weaver as the Oedipal granny, and it all rings quite true, depressingly so. But the bleakness gets a little much at points, and a little more grim humor might have leavened the loaf a bit. They marketed this as ""the Australian Goodfellas"", but it's never nearly that much fun. It's too realistic for that, to both its credit and detriment. There are some good surprises and tense moments, but the music over-telegraphs those at many points, and kind of intrudes on the film; transparently trying too hard doesn't really suit this material, especially when the performances are often surprisingly understated. Those performances are fun to watch, however.I also liked the ending a lot, very sharp and shocking and strangely satisfying in a very depressing way.The blu-ray transfer is good, but the film has a '70s crime flick look that really doesn't need hi-def.

1371340,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B003Y5H4R0,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","I was drawn to explore this film by Jacki Weaver's Oscar-nominated performance as Janine ""Smurf"" Cody.  She won the Australian Film Institute's Best Lead Actress Award and won supporting actress awards from the National Board of Review, Los Angeles & San Francisco Film Critics Associations.  At first, she seems like this goofy detached grandmother who has a penchant for kissing her sons on the lips.  By the closing frames where she's encouraging a hit on a family member with such startling calm and a final scene meeting with the detective played by Guy Pearce in the supermarket, we see how twisted and lethal the woman is.  Weaver plays the role with such an understated matter-of-factness that it is a breathtaking performance, well worth the recognition that has come her way.Writer/director David Michod's script worked extremely well for me, making me frequently squirm in my seat.  The violence happens with spring-loaded speed so startling that it makes each frame ominous as if the sky could fall at any time.James Frecheville plays the lead J.  His character is most notable for his impassive stare such as when he is more interested in a game show than his mother passed out next to him during the opening frames.  Later, J secludes himself in a bathroom for a moment and totally breaks down in tears, which shows range.Joel Edgerton who is currently filming ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" won a Best Supporting Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute for the film.  His character of Barry Brown is tough and lethal, yet wise and calculating.  We see him wish to turn over a new leaf, adopt a less risky lifestyle.  It's a very strong performance that brought to mind Heath Ledger's approach.I absolutely loved the jumpy uncle Craig Cody played by Sullivan Stapleton.  This guy is so hyper; he's just about to jump out of his skin throughout the whole film.  It was brilliantly played from his first to his last frame.Ben Mendelsohn won the Best Lead Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute for the paranoid and quietly sinister uncle Pope Cody.  His character is like watching a coiled snake about ready to unwind and strike at any moment.  His most interesting moment for me was when he breaks into the bathroom while J is taking a shower, yanks back the shower curtain and proceeds to talk to him, seemingly embarrassed to actually look at his naked nephew.Luke Ford plays the quietest uncle Darren Cody who Pope needles to find out if Darren is gay.  This subtle implication seems to grip his mother Smurf to assure she gets him out of prison.""The Animal Kingdom"" does not really shed any enlightenment from its characters, but is full of irony such as J's final kiss to his grandmother.  We see J has learned to survive in the animal kingdom.  While hardly pleasant, it is a stunning character-driven (rather than action-driven) crime drama that lingers with me after the final frames.

1371342,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003Y5H4R0,Mark Turner,"[3, 16]","More often than not major critics around the globe find some obscure movie to go on and on about, hailing it as the next big thing, praising the actors, writer, director and more. They talk about how if you see one movie then this is it. And more often than not they are completely off the mark hailing some of the most boring films ever made. Enter ANIMAL KINGDOM.The story revolves around Joshua ""J"" Cody (Jay Frecheville), a teenager who sits and watches TV as his mother dies of a heroin overdose. With nowhere else to go, J ends up with his grandmother Janine (Jacki Weaver). Also living in the same house are various uncles and cousins, all of whom are mixed up in the world of crime one way or another.The life of crime that this family has adopted has led to their being hounded by the police as well. The most feared and sought after among them is ""Pope"" (Ben Mendelsohn). While searching for him, the police routinely camp outside the homes of his family and friends. When all else fails, the kill one of his brothers and make it look as if he was armed.This action sets the ball in motion with Pope now seeking revenge. The character never seems to be as evil as the word around town about him is, but there is an undercurrent of menace about him. To even the score, Pope recruits other family members and they ambush a pair of uniformed officers and murder them which of course increases the vigor with which the police now want the Cody family.All the while J is more or less simply there when things happen. He was involved in nothing more than stealing the car used to ambush the police, but as a member of the family in this town he's presumed guilty with no chance of innocence. But when Det. Leckie (Guy Pearce) interviews him he sees an opening, a crack in the armor that is the Cody family. And even though it puts J's life on the line, he continues pushing until Pope is certain that J has talked.The inevitable reaction from Pope is to take out J, even if he is family. For this group the family is the center of all things and not to be taken lightly. J may not have talked out of turn, but the chance is there and Pope decides J must die. But the plan to do so fails and now J must choose between family and a chance to get out of this world of crime.As a few other films I've discussed recently, this one sounded good on paper. But the pacing is slow at best and the story feels like an hour long TV drama extended to feature length that offers nothing extra. You walk away from this movie thinking ""I want back that two hours of my life"".I'm sure that someone, somewhere thought the acting in this was great. I left thinking that it was lame and offered nothing. Nothing new, nothing old, just existing as if that was enough. Sorry, I want to be entertained at least somewhat when I sit down to watch a movie. But my guess is that I'm not the only one who felt that way after watching this.As I said from the start, critics have heaped high praise on this film. In so doing they've just confirmed my view on most major critics. They praise films that a) are pretentious and boring yet they don't want to seem to admit they are or b) they don't understand the film and rather than seem out of it, praise it instead.Speaking of not understanding a film, while this movie is Australian (a country that speaks English mind you) you'll be better off having the English subtitles run while watching. The accents are incredibly thick and the language at times seems to be Aussie slang. Just keep in mind that even with subtitles, this movie is incredibly boring.",2,ANIMAL PLANET IS LESS BORING,1295222400,"01 17, 2011",2011,3581,"['More', 'often', 'not', 'major', 'critics', 'globe', 'find', 'obscure', 'movie', 'go', 'hailing', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'praising', 'actors', 'writer', 'director', 'more', 'talk', 'how', 'see', 'one', 'movie', 'then', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'are', 'completely', 'mark', 'hailing', 'most', 'boring', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Enter', 'ANIMAL', 'KINGDOM.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Joshua', 'J', 'Cody', 'Jay', 'Frecheville', 'teenager', 'who', 'watches', 'TV', 'mother', 'dies', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go', 'J', 'up', 'grandmother', 'Janine', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'Also', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'are', 'various', 'uncles', 'cousins', 'whom', 'are', 'mixed', 'up', 'world', 'crime', 'one', 'way', 'another.The', 'life', 'crime', 'family', 'adopted', 'led', 'being', 'hounded', 'police', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'feared', 'sought', 'Pope', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'searching', 'police', 'routinely', 'camp', 'homes', 'family', 'friends', 'When', 'else', 'kill', 'one', 'brothers', 'make', 'look', 'was', 'armed.This', 'action', 'ball', 'motion', 'Pope', 'now', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'character', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'evil', 'word', 'town', 'undercurrent', 'menace', 'even', 'score', 'Pope', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'ambush', 'pair', 'uniformed', 'officers', 'murder', 'course', 'vigor', 'police', 'now', 'want', 'Cody', 'family.All', 'while', 'J', 'more', 'less', 'simply', 'when', 'things', 'happen', 'was', 'involved', 'nothing', 'more', 'stealing', 'car', 'used', 'ambush', 'police', 'member', 'family', 'town', 'presumed', 'guilty', 'chance', 'innocence', 'when', 'Det', 'Leckie', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'opening', 'crack', 'armor', 'Cody', 'family', 'even', 'J', 'life', 'line', 'pushing', 'Pope', 'certain', 'J', 'talked.The', 'inevitable', 'reaction', 'Pope', 'take', 'out', 'J', 'even', 'family', 'group', 'family', 'center', 'things', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'J', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'talked', 'turn', 'chance', 'there', 'Pope', 'J', 'must', 'die', 'plan', 'do', 'so', 'fails', 'now', 'J', 'must', 'choose', 'family', 'chance', 'get', 'world', 'crime.As', 'few', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'discussed', 'recently', 'one', 'sounded', 'good', 'paper', 'pacing', 'slow', 'best', 'story', 'feels', 'hour', 'long', 'TV', 'drama', 'extended', 'feature', 'length', 'nothing', 'extra', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'thinking', 'want', 'back', 'two', 'hours', 'life', ""'m"", 'sure', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'left', 'thinking', 'was', 'lame', 'offered', 'nothing', 'Nothing', 'new', 'nothing', 'old', 'just', 'existing', 'was', 'enough', 'Sorry', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'least', 'somewhat', 'when', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'guess', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'felt', 'way', 'watching', 'this.As', 'said', 'start', 'critics', 'have', 'heaped', 'high', 'praise', 'film', 'so', 'doing', ""'ve"", 'just', 'confirmed', 'view', 'most', 'major', 'critics', 'praise', 'films', 'are', 'pretentious', 'boring', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'seem', 'admit', 'are', 'b', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'film', 'rather', 'seem', 'praise', 'instead.Speaking', 'not', 'understanding', 'film', 'movie', 'Australian', 'country', 'English', ""'ll"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'having', 'English', 'subtitles', 'run', 'watching', 'accents', 'are', 'incredibly', 'thick', 'language', 'times', 'be', 'Aussie', 'slang', 'Just', 'keep', 'mind', 'even', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'boring']",N/A

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[3, 5]","Even though it's sometimes difficult to understand what the actors are saying because of their Australian accents, ANIMAL KINGDOM is, arguably, the best crime drama to come along since Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED (2006).[I also really like Ben Affleck's THE TOWN, so let's say that that's the best American crime drama since THE DEPARTED.]ANIMAL KINGDOM, the debut film from writer-director David Michod, employs a fresh approach to the genre, as Christopher Nolan's MEMENTO did in 2000, and it also features an uniquely compelling set of characters, cast with a superb group of actors who you would not expect to see in these kinds of roles.Newcomer James Frecheville stars as a stoic young man who, following the death of his mother from a drug overdose, goes to live with his grandmother  (Jacki Weaver, in a chilling, award-caliber performance).Granny, it seems, is a modern-day ""Ma Barker,"" heading up a notorious gang of bank robbers that include her three sons (Ben Mendelsohn, Sullivan Stapleton, Luke Ford) and their pragmatic friend (Joel Edgerton).  When some renegade cops blow one of their number away,  a virtual war  breaks out between the gang and the police, and Frecheville, basically a decent kid, is caught in the middle.  He soon discovers that he is not only a liability to his family, who fear he might squeal, but there are also crooked cops out there who want him dead.Guy Pearce co-stars as an honest cop, trying to help Frecheville make the right decision.ANIMAL KINGDOM is a film filled with surprising, often shocking, plot twists.  It is an instant classic of the genre.The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has audio commentary by Michod, a ""Making of"" featurette and a Q&A; with director and several cast members.

1371344,A1FG91CM8221X1,B003Y5H4R0,Miles D. Moore,"[42, 50]","""Animal Kingdom,"" David Michod's debut feature, is undeniably well-made and compelling, but it's strictly for people who thought ""The Departed"" was too optimistic. Seventeen-year-old Joshua Cody (James Frecheville), known as J, never had a chance, as ""Animal Kingdom"" makes plain from the opening shot. Once J's mother dies of a heroin overdose, he has nowhere to go but the home of his ""Grandma Smurf"" (Jacki Weaver) and uncles, a violent group of career criminals that makes ""White Heat"" and ""Bloody Mama"" look like ""Mary Poppins."" The Codys live in a seedy section of Melbourne in which police and crooks are essentially competing mobs, sometimes cooperating but more often taking hits out on each other. It's a true jungle, just as merciless as the Serengeti and far more corrupt.""Animal Kingdom"" is essentially the story of how J is sucked inexorably into a life of crime, enhanced by ominous music and portentous slo-mo camera effects. Ben Mendelsohn--playing J's Uncle Andrew, a/k/a The Pope--is absolutely terrifying. So is Weaver as the outwardly cheery but inwardly satanic Grandma Smurf, who will sacrifice anyone and anything to preserve the family business. ""Just because you don't want to do something,"" she remarks at one crucial point, ""doesn't mean it can't be done."" As for Frecheville, at the beginning he's reminiscent of Forrest Gump if Forrest had been played by the young Rupert Everett.

Seventeen-year-old Joshua ""J"" Cody (James Frecheville) is taken in by his slippery Grandma Smurf (Jacki Weaver) after his mother dies of a heroin overdose. Without anywhere else to turn, he falls into a life of crime with his psychopathic Uncle Pope (Ben Mendelson), drug-dealing Uncle Craig (Sullivan Stapleton), and reserved Uncle Darren (Luke Ford) to guide him. When police kill the family's close criminal associate Barry Brown (Joel Edgerton), Pope vows revenge, and things spin out of control.I have to say that I'm tired of movies that look bad. The ""cin&eacute;ma verit&eacute;"" style is not suitable for every film, and it is too much when every crime film and thriller is shot this way. ""Animal Kingdom"" looks bad. And there is a superfluous voiceover narration near the beginning that should have been left to the cutting room floor. But my criticism ends there. Jacki Weaver is diabolical as Grandma Smurf, and I love the way the audience discovers her true nature slowly. Guy Pearce has a supporting role as Det. Nathan Leckie, who befriends J and offers an alternative to a life of crime and prison. I like that this cop is well-intentioned but essentially nave. J, though not the brightest bulb himself, understands his position well and is left to navigate a corrupt world with limited resources.The DVD (Sony 2011): ""The Making of Animal Kingdom"" (15 min) interviews writer/director David Michod and producer Liz Watts about casting, and it interviews the cast about their roles and how they got them.

Films such as ""Wolf Creek"" and ""The Loved Ones"" prove that Australia can churn out some gritty, violent and disturbing films.  ""Animal Kingdom"" is no exception.  This movie is a powerhouse of great film making with intense performances, impeccable direction and a brilliant script.  You may find yourself thinking that you've seen this story before, but you've never seen it with the same intensity and emotion.""Animal Kingdom"" is at it's heart a coming of age story in a crime family.  Joshua, played by James Frecheville, is a 17 year old recently orphaned kid who's family is a mixture of drug dealers and bank robbers.  Joshua's mother dies in the beginning of the film from a drug overdose and the only option he has is to go live with his grandmother.  Jackie Weaver stunningly plays Janine 'Smurf' Cody, the matriarchal grandmother running everything.  As Joshua gets situated in his new home he begins to find he's in a very volatile situation.  One that he has to decide whether to be a part of or not.  A decision that will undoubtedly change his entire life.This film is akin to Scorcese's masterpieces ""Casino"", ""The Departed"" and ""Taxi Driver"".  Director, David Michd emulated these films yet certainly made ""Animal Kingdom"" his own.  As his first feature film, Michd made it seem easy.  The incredibly taut script left nothing to be desired.  As in the Scorcese films I mentioned, the script was the key ingredient to make this film such a brilliant piece of work.  Some crime drama's can get away with having a back story everyone knows, yet the script is sub par.  ""Animal Kingdom"" is not only fresh but being from Australia it's impact is that much greater to American audiences.Joel Edgerton made a lifelong fan for his performance here.  He was chilling yet completely sensitive to the plight of his family and that of his sibling Joshua.  Frecheville who plays Joshua, the scared orphan brother, is brilliant.  His transformation is a wonder to behold, his delivery and expressions brought out real emotion in the character.  The standout performance in this film has to be Jackie Weaver as Smurf the matriarch of the clan.  Writer/Director Michd wrote the part of Janine 'Smurf' Cody for Jackie Weaver in fact, thank God she accepted the role.  She has mentioned in the radio program ""Fresh Air"" that her interpretation of the character provide that all the children were fathered by different men (criminals most likely).  I think this allowed her to really dive into connecting to her kin in very different ways.  She is by far the highlight of the film for me.As a production the film succeeds.  It's slow but detailed progression really allows the viewer to become attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling at any given moment.

A bland young 17 year old kid has nowhere to go after his mom dies, so he goes to grandma's house. Sweet, huh? Grandma has a brood of killers, and nothing they do can upset her, even as they get killed off, and if little J gets in her way, she might get rid of him, too. Slow moving, but methodical, as written and directed by David Michod, the character of J is the center of all the mystery, a blank face mostly, waiting for a picture of life. Integrity is explored, as is deceit and contempt, both for the criminal society as well as law enforcement. Michod has crafted a fine film; some have compared it to Goodfellas, but the violence is minimal. It's an Australian perspective, to a very Australian situation. It doesn't make it less violent or insane; it simply takes a little more time to let it sink in. Jacki Weaver may win an Oscar as the innately evil grandma, but I'm glad her underplayed role was recognized. (Nothing as powerful as Mo'nique last year, another evil mom).

Zwick,"[2, 3]","Based on a true story, ""Animal Kingdom"" is a gritty, gripping crime-family saga set in Melbourne, Australia.Josh Cody is just seventeen when his mother dies of a heroin overdose, leaving him an orphan.  With no where else to go, he moves in with his maternal grandmother and his three thieving uncles who have rap-sheets a mile long and an ongoing antagonistic relationship with the local police.  When the cops shoot down one of the boys' cohorts (Joel Edgerton) in cold blood, the family retaliates in kind by taking out two officers on a routine call the men themselves have set up to trap them.Josh, who seems to be a decent if somewhat bewildered kid, suddenly finds himself caught between a family he doesn't feel particularly close to - but who are clearly all he's got -and the detectives on the case (led by Guy Pearce) who see him as a ripe candidate for turning state's evidence against the family.  The problem is that once Josh's grandmother and oldest uncle, Andrew ""Pope"" Cody (Ben Mendelsohn), get wind that Josh might indeed be spilling his guts to the cops, the family - who would normally be there to protect him - will literally stop at nothing to make sure he doesn't talk.The superbly naturalistic screenplay by director David Michod is distinguished by its utter lack of contrivance and melodrama and its willingness to go wherever it deems necessary at any given moment for the sake of the story (which is based on an actual crime family, the Pentingills).  The result is a movie that feels almost completely unscripted and, thus, immensely in tune with real life.  Josh's complex moral dilemma takes place in an unnerving world of antisocial antagonism and upside down values, where loyalty to family supersedes all else, yet where, paradoxically, if one dares to violate that code, ""justice"" is meted out swiftly, brutally and without a hint of sentimentality by the family itself.  As the title suggests, here is a world where the Darwinian law of the jungle demands that any potentially harmful member of the tribe be eliminated to maintain the viability of the group.The performances are brilliant throughout, with James Frecheville making a mark on our hearts as the taciturn Josh, who may appear to be passive and almost nave in the initial stages of the drama, but who demonstrates an impressive instinct for self-preservation when the situation calls for it.  Jackie Weaver is also astonishing as Janine Cody, the Ma Barker of the piece, a woman who seems at first to be little more than an observer and enabler of her sons' illegal activities, but who shows herself to be a steely-eyed and cold-hearted manipulator of events the moment her own family unit is threatened.Brilliant and compelling.",4,Quietly powerful and understated crime drama,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,2729,"['Based', 'true', 'story', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'gritty', 'gripping', 'crime-family', 'saga', 'set', 'Melbourne', 'Australia.Josh', 'Cody', 'just', 'seventeen', 'when', 'mother', 'dies', 'heroin', 'overdose', 'leaving', 'orphan', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'maternal', 'grandmother', 'three', 'thieving', 'uncles', 'who', 'have', 'rap-sheets', 'mile', 'long', 'ongoing', 'antagonistic', 'relationship', 'local', 'police', 'When', 'cops', 'shoot', 'down', 'one', 'boys', 'cohorts', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'cold', 'blood', 'family', 'kind', 'taking', 'out', 'two', 'officers', 'routine', 'call', 'men', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'trap', 'them.Josh', 'who', 'be', 'decent', 'somewhat', 'bewildered', 'kid', 'suddenly', 'caught', 'family', ""n't"", 'feel', 'particularly', 'close', 'who', 'are', 'clearly', 'got', '-and', 'detectives', 'case', 'led', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'see', 'ripe', 'candidate', 'turning', 'state', 'evidence', 'family', 'problem', 'once', 'Josh', 'grandmother', 'oldest', 'uncle', 'Andrew', 'Pope', 'Cody', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'get', 'Josh', 'might', 'indeed', 'be', 'spilling', 'guts', 'cops', 'family', 'who', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'there', 'protect', 'will', 'literally', 'stop', 'nothing', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'talk.The', 'superbly', 'naturalistic', 'screenplay', 'director', 'David', 'Michod', 'distinguished', 'utter', 'lack', 'contrivance', 'melodrama', 'willingness', 'go', 'necessary', 'given', 'moment', 'sake', 'story', 'based', 'actual', 'crime', 'family', 'Pentingills', 'result', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'unscripted', 'thus', 'immensely', 'tune', 'real', 'life', 'Josh', 'complex', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'place', 'unnerving', 'world', 'antisocial', 'antagonism', 'upside', 'down', 'values', 'where', 'loyalty', 'family', 'supersedes', 'else', 'yet', 'where', 'paradoxically', 'one', 'violate', 'code', 'justice', 'meted', 'out', 'swiftly', 'brutally', 'hint', 'sentimentality', 'family', 'title', 'here', 'world', 'where', 'Darwinian', 'law', 'jungle', 'potentially', 'harmful', 'member', 'tribe', 'be', 'eliminated', 'maintain', 'viability', 'group.The', 'performances', 'are', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Frecheville', 'making', 'mark', 'hearts', 'taciturn', 'Josh', 'who', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'passive', 'almost', 'nave', 'initial', 'stages', 'drama', 'who', 'impressive', 'instinct', 'self-preservation', 'when', 'situation', 'Jackie', 'Weaver', 'also', 'astonishing', 'Janine', 'Cody', 'Ma', 'Barker', 'piece', 'woman', 'who', 'first', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'observer', 'enabler', 'sons', 'illegal', 'activities', 'who', 'be', 'steely-eyed', 'cold-hearted', 'manipulator', 'events', 'moment', 'own', 'family', 'unit', 'threatened.Brilliant', 'compelling']",N/A

It's not that this movie is bad, it's just that it received such high acclaim, that I was expecting a whole lot more.The problem with this movie is that this foreign movie is...too foreign.I normally like foreign movies primarily because it is enjoyable to be entertained from a different cultural angle, perspective, and style. American mainstream movies fit it into expected patterns where the presentation is too routine (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is an excellent example of the successful,  ""different angle"" foreign movie).The story is about a wayward teenager, who's heroin-using mother passes away and he is forced to live with his grandmother and uncles, a destination even worse that the tragic place from where he comes from.In this film;1) The Australian accents were so strong, a lotof dialogue was not understandable;2) The editing was terrible;3) There was a lack of focus on the impact ofthe story on this violent, amoral family. Imean siblings, offspring and girlfriends,and police are savagely murdered and youreally do not see a normal reaction to sucha traumatic incident, ;4) There was a continuous brooding, ""doom andgloom"" aura which made viewing the filmponderous and5) I hated how the director presented thefilm. There were too much insinuations andnot enough focus on the conflicts that weregoing on.

1371355,AVN00ASBFTMN6,B003Y5H4R0,Smoking Ace,"[0, 2]","Daniel Michod's Animal Kingdom is a very impressive film. Not just for the fact that it is his first, but also for the fact that he has made an incredibly effective crime film with little actual crime . There are no bank robbery scenes, and save for a few killings, we are only to judge from these actor's performances that their pasts have not been pretty. Luckily for us, all of the acting here is utterly fantastic. I know that the Academy doesn't hand out awards for Ensembles, but this one would be a very special exception.  Jacki Weaver (Who came off as being so sweet in Picnic at Hanging Rock) is a mastermind here as Smurf. Her exterior exudes the likes of a warm grandmother, but we can see through her eyes (and a few later scenes)that there is something much darker swirling in her. Under her matriarchy lies Josh, played by James Frecheville, a teenager who seems to have become emotionally detached from the world. In the opening sequence he glances towards the tv while ""ambos"" try to save his overdosed mother. He is our eye into this world, and there is something extremely authentic and empathetic about him. When he narrates, he doesn't sound like an actor playing a teenager, but a lost kid thrown into a world he was never meant to be in. Although he doesn't say much, We care for what happens to him. He is surrounded by gruffed uncles Darren and Craig, and the almost friendly Baz who all give stellar performances.Later in the film we are introduced to Mendelsohn's sociopathic Andrew ""Pope"" Cody, and from there the film takes a downward spiral into hell. The film treads on a tight line of intensity that roars through the last half hour with unpredictable twists and turns. We never know who will come out alive or what Josh will have to do to overcome the adversities of his broken family, but we know it won't be easy. Not only do the performances here excell, but so do the script and direction. Seriously how hard is it to make a crime film these days without a single cliche slipping through? Very. Yet here it is, a film without your standard high anxiety bank robbing scene, two dimensional badguys, and cookie cutter cops. Just a film with realistic characters dealing with a soul shattering environment, where there really are no goodguys. Even the cops are seen here in a faded light where it is hard to find morality.  Earlier this year I saw Ben Affleck's The Town, and liked it alot. But I felt it had something missing, some aura of reality. (if that makes sense) I believe I found that  missing piece in Animal Kingdom. The film is what my title says: A gem. A gem worth buying.Pros: Great ensemble, direction, and script. I like the score alot too.Cons: Some will not like the thick aussie accents.

1371356,A382JTM7S9LGEC,B003Y5H4R0,surfergirl,"[2, 4]","*contains spoilers*Animal Kingdom, a suburban crime drama film, is up for a Golden Globe nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category. It has won several IF Awards (Australian Inside Film Award) in addition to receiving recognition at the Sundance Film Festival. One of the names you will recognize is Guy Pearce who has acted in several American movies - he plays the detective in this film who is trying to take down the crime family.Animal Kingdom covers the story of seventeen-year old Josh who is forced to return to his estranged grandmother's house for a place to live after his mother dies. Having spent the better part of his life shielded by his mother from the criminal elements in their family, Josh is now stuck right in the middle of it. He is thrust into the aptly-named ""animal kingdom"" of criminals versus cops, lies versus truth, and struggles to find his place in their world. Wanted by the police, the first uncle, Pope, is a sociopath and is the worst of the lot, terrifying in certain moments, especially after his partner Barry is murdered by vigilante police. The second uncle, Craig, is a drug dealer. And the third, Darren, the youngest (and just 2 years older than Josh), is being apprenticed into the armed robbery business by his older brothers. Josh's grandmother, who appears to be uninvolved in any actual ""dirty work"" in the beginning, runs the entire family with an iron fist, and her love for her sons is borderline incestuous. It only becomes clear nearing the end just how far she is willing to go for them and how much control she has over everyone. When Barry is murdered in cold blood by police, Pope and Craig retaliate in kind. Therein begins a police manhunt for Pope, and Josh becomes caught in the middle. He wants no part of the lawlessness but the question becomes - can he give up the only family he has to do so? In return for his testimony against Pope, Pope and Darren are jailed. Josh's grandmother decides to call in a few favors and is quite willing to sacrifice her grandson for her sons' freedom, especially for Darren, her baby. She doesn't care too much about Pope who is psychopathic, but she will do anything to save Darren. In an unexpected twist, Josh turns against the police to work with the defense and his uncles are freed. He is welcomed back into his grandmother's home, but his true motive for switching comes at the film's close when he shoots Pope in the head. In the end, this climactic, dramatic film is about survival, pure and simple, and epitomizes the battle between the weak and the strong...eat or be eaten.The film is very realistically portrayed, with the actors up front and center, leading up to some very tense moments throughout. A compactly-constructed story, Animal Kingdom takes place in Melbourne, Australia in the 1980's. Most of the tension comes from the dynamic and charged relationship between all the characters, including the major and peripheral ones, instead of any all-out actual action sequences which I think is a testament to the director's skill. There is no gratuitous sex or heavy violence taking away from the focus on its multi-layered and dangerous personalities. Instead, the film's darkness and danger come from the characters themselves, especially Pope whose psychotic nature is particularly horrifying when he calmly strangles Josh's girlfriend to tie up a loose end, and the grandmother whose matter-of-fact coldness to eliminate her own grandson is just as gruesome in its own way.Because the story is mostly told from Josh's perspective, you really get drawn into the world as well as into his own fears on who to trust, and his struggles to determine right from wrong. His shyness makes him a great foil for the other more edgy, nasty characters, and you end up taking the journey through his own nerve-wracking experience of it. The end is bittersweet because Josh loses some of his innocence and is forced to become part of that world, and even though it's by his own choice, it's both sad and triumphant.Animal Kingdom is an emotionally-fraught film that will leave you tied in knots, and although it does start slowly, I think that that build-up just adds to the intensity in the end. Very well-scripted and well-acted. Disturbing and raw, I would rate Animal Kingdom three and a half out of five stars.",3,Unexpectedly good film,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,4330,"['*contains', 'spoilers*Animal', 'Kingdom', 'suburban', 'crime', 'drama', 'film', 'up', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'category', 'won', 'several', 'IF', 'Awards', 'Australian', 'Inside', 'Film', 'Award', 'addition', 'receiving', 'recognition', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'One', 'names', 'will', 'recognize', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'acted', 'several', 'American', 'movies', 'detective', 'film', 'who', 'trying', 'take', 'down', 'crime', 'family.Animal', 'Kingdom', 'story', 'seventeen-year', 'old', 'Josh', 'who', 'forced', 'return', 'estranged', 'grandmother', 'house', 'place', 'live', 'mother', 'Having', 'spent', 'better', 'part', 'life', 'shielded', 'mother', 'criminal', 'elements', 'family', 'Josh', 'now', 'stuck', 'right', 'middle', 'thrust', 'aptly-named', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'criminals', 'versus', 'cops', 'truth', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'Wanted', 'police', 'first', 'uncle', 'Pope', 'sociopath', 'worst', 'lot', 'terrifying', 'certain', 'moments', 'especially', 'partner', 'Barry', 'murdered', 'vigilante', 'police', 'second', 'uncle', 'Craig', 'drug', 'dealer', 'third', 'Darren', 'youngest', 'just', '2', 'years', 'older', 'Josh', 'being', 'apprenticed', 'armed', 'robbery', 'business', 'older', 'brothers', 'Josh', 'grandmother', 'who', 'be', 'uninvolved', 'actual', 'dirty', 'work', 'beginning', 'entire', 'family', 'iron', 'fist', 'love', 'sons', 'borderline', 'incestuous', 'only', 'clear', 'nearing', 'end', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'willing', 'go', 'how', 'much', 'control', 'everyone', 'When', 'Barry', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'police', 'Pope', 'Craig', 'retaliate', 'kind', 'Therein', 'police', 'manhunt', 'Pope', 'Josh', 'becomes', 'caught', 'middle', 'part', 'lawlessness', 'question', 'can', 'give', 'up', 'only', 'family', 'do', 'so', 'return', 'testimony', 'Pope', 'Pope', 'Darren', 'are', 'jailed', 'Josh', 'grandmother', 'call', 'few', 'favors', 'quite', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'grandson', 'sons', 'freedom', 'especially', 'Darren', 'baby', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'Pope', 'who', 'psychopathic', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'Darren', 'unexpected', 'twist', 'Josh', 'police', 'work', 'defense', 'uncles', 'are', 'freed', 'welcomed', 'back', 'grandmother', 'home', 'true', 'motive', 'switching', 'film', 'close', 'when', 'shoots', 'Pope', 'head', 'end', 'climactic', 'dramatic', 'film', 'survival', 'pure', 'simple', 'battle', 'weak', 'strong', 'eat', 'be', 'eaten.The', 'film', 'very', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'actors', 'up', 'front', 'center', 'leading', 'up', 'very', 'tense', 'moments', 'compactly-constructed', 'story', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'place', 'Melbourne', 'Australia', '1980', 'Most', 'tension', 'dynamic', 'charged', 'relationship', 'characters', 'including', 'major', 'peripheral', 'ones', 'instead', 'all-out', 'actual', 'action', 'sequences', 'think', 'testament', 'director', 'skill', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'heavy', 'violence', 'taking', 'away', 'focus', 'multi-layered', 'dangerous', 'personalities', 'Instead', 'film', 'darkness', 'danger', 'come', 'characters', 'especially', 'Pope', 'psychotic', 'nature', 'particularly', 'horrifying', 'when', 'calmly', 'Josh', 'girlfriend', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'end', 'grandmother', 'matter-of-fact', 'coldness', 'eliminate', 'own', 'grandson', 'just', 'gruesome', 'own', 'way.Because', 'story', 'mostly', 'told', 'Josh', 'perspective', 'really', 'get', 'drawn', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'fears', 'who', 'trust', 'struggles', 'determine', 'right', 'wrong', 'shyness', 'great', 'foil', 'other', 'more', 'edgy', 'nasty', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'journey', 'own', 'nerve-wracking', 'experience', 'end', 'bittersweet', 'Josh', 'innocence', 'forced', 'become', 'part', 'world', 'even', 'own', 'choice', 'sad', 'triumphant.Animal', 'Kingdom', 'emotionally-fraught', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'tied', 'knots', 'start', 'slowly', 'think', 'build-up', 'just', 'intensity', 'end', 'Very', 'well-scripted', 'well-acted', 'Disturbing', 'raw', 'would', 'rate', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'three', 'half', 'five', 'stars']",N/A

Full of action and violence, for me its characters are what sets it apart.The characters of this dysfunctional crime family were riveting, complex, complicated, layered, yet realistic.  I really cared about this family of misfits and their attempt to navigate their world which is being turned upside down.  It is one of those rare movies that I wish would be continued so that I can continue to follow the development of these characters.  It has genuine surprises, including seemingly inexplicable violence which on second thought becomes so logical and sensible.It is amazing that Animal Kingdom is the first full-length movie directed by David Michd.  David Michd also wrote this tremendous original screenplay.  Hopefully we will be graced by this amazingly talented man.I originally bought Animal Kingdom because Guy Pearce is in it.  Guy is so talented with such a wide range.  I waited to watch it because I am not a fan of crime movies.  What a fool I was.  I had to wait until the credits to figure out which character Guy had played.  I did not recognize him.Another phenomenal actor, who is apparently considered a ""national treasure"" in Australia, and deservedly so, is Jacki Weaver who plays Janine 'Smurf' Cody, the matriarch, the grandmother of Joshua who is called ""J"" (played by first-timer actor James Frecheville), and the mother of three sons of varying ferocity, Andrew called ""Pope"", Craig, and Darren.  Jacki Weaver is indeed an amazing actress who gives a tremendous performance.  Jacki's ""Smurf"" is comforting, disarming, perhaps too close and familiar with her sons, and yet dangerous.And yet another phenomenal performance is given by Ben Mendelsohn who plays Andrew called ""Pope"" Cody.

1371362,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003Y5H4R0,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","""Animal Kingdom"" is a 2010 Australian crime drama about a young boy ""J,"" who has to make a tough decision to survive in Melbourne's underworld, where he finds himself trapped between two powers that may either protect or exploit (and even kill) him.When his mother died from overdosing, a 17-year-old boy Joshua ""J"" Cody (James Frecheville) moves in with the family of his estranged grandmother Janine (Jacki Weaver). Janine's three sons Andrew (Ben Mendelsohn), Craig (Sullivan Stapleton) and Darren (Luke Ford), with Andrew's old friend Barry (Joel Edgerton), are all involved in crimes in one way or another - armed robbery and drug dealing - and Melbourne police are looking for a chance to bring down the family members in a violent way.No wonder Quentin Tarantino selected ""Animal Kingdom"" as his third favorite film of 2010. Like his ""Jackie Brown,"" his underrated character-driven crime drama, the measured pace of ""Animal Kingdom"" eventually becomes the strength of the film, together with its grim and realistic atmosphere. You will slowly learn who is the strongest (and the most dangerous) one in this ""kingdom.""Guy Pearce appears as a police detective advising J to find his place. J's answer to the question will be revealed in the film's last ten minutes. Whether you may or may not like what you see in the final scene, watching the process to it is fascinating.",4,To Survive Animal Kingdom: Fascinating Crime Drama,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,1378,"['Animal', 'Kingdom', '2010', 'Australian', 'crime', 'drama', 'young', 'boy', 'J', 'who', 'make', 'tough', 'decision', 'survive', 'Melbourne', 'underworld', 'where', 'trapped', 'two', 'powers', 'may', 'either', 'protect', 'exploit', 'even', 'kill', 'him.When', 'mother', 'died', 'overdosing', '17-year-old', 'boy', 'Joshua', 'J', 'Cody', 'James', 'Frecheville', 'family', 'estranged', 'grandmother', 'Janine', 'Jacki', 'Weaver', 'Janine', 'three', 'sons', 'Andrew', 'Ben', 'Mendelsohn', 'Craig', 'Sullivan', 'Stapleton', 'Darren', 'Luke', 'Ford', 'Andrew', 'old', 'friend', 'Barry', 'Joel', 'Edgerton', 'are', 'involved', 'crimes', 'one', 'way', 'armed', 'robbery', 'drug', 'dealing', 'Melbourne', 'police', 'are', 'looking', 'chance', 'bring', 'down', 'family', 'members', 'violent', 'way.No', 'wonder', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'selected', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'third', 'favorite', 'film', '2010', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'underrated', 'character-driven', 'crime', 'drama', 'measured', 'pace', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'eventually', 'strength', 'film', 'together', 'grim', 'realistic', 'atmosphere', 'will', 'slowly', 'learn', 'who', 'strongest', 'most', 'dangerous', 'one', 'kingdom', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'police', 'detective', 'advising', 'J', 'find', 'place', 'J', 'answer', 'question', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'final', 'scene', 'watching', 'process', 'fascinating']",N/A
