If the plethora of Psychics and Mystics, dubious Editors or Authors weren&#8217;t the giveaway that the content was going to indeed be questionable, then all one had to do was wait long enough for Joan Collins to begin reciting (incorrectly) the particulars of her own English history, on two occasions she erroneously refers the late Duke of Windsor as King Edward VII; when he was in fact Edward VIII. One has to ask, did neither the Director nor Ms. Collins not catch the mistakes; or was it just that they simply did not have the budget to reshoot those portions, either way it speaks volumes for the integrity of this documentary.

Na na na na na.. There's a heavy emphasis here on interviews with Diana's faith healers, astrologists and acupuncturists. They offer very little insight. The interviews with Mike Walker of the National Enquirer are actually the best!  We haven't heard from him over and over, and he seems to have liked and understood Diana. He respected the adversarial relationship she had with the press, and admired the clever ways she pulled off end runs around the paparazzi.

This is by far the absolute WORST portrayal of one of the most amazing people that ever touched our world.  The people who talk about her include her psychic, astrologer and acupuncturist.  Her astrologer at one point is describing two dreams she had that could have been a ""sign"" that Diana was going to die.  What they talk about has been known for a long time and their descriptions are weak at that.  Last, if you are looking to see Diana in action, you will be disappointed.  They do not have anything live, just a set of well known photos shown over and over again.

1077005,A2J82ZGATKBBB8,B000QUCRGO,MaryEvelyn,"[5, 6]","As a fan of Diana, Princess of Wales, I have watched and read many topics on this amazing woman. This was another interesting look into Diana's world, hosted by Joan Collins. Of course we all know the stories that surround Diana but if you're like me...I can never get enough and this program was a wonderful tribute to the Princess. There are interviews with two of her main astrologers and two women I believe she trusted. Andrew Morton provides his expert knowledge on the princess and is believable when he says that he is certain that had Diana lived after that night in Paris,  she would NOT have continued her relationship with Dodi for much longer. Of course, Mohammed Al Fayed is also  part of this feature and he has generous things to say about Diana and still appears as obsessed as ever with his theory that Diana and Dodi were murdered by the Royal family to prevent the princess from marrying a Muslim. Al Fayed is a grieving father and I sympathize with him but I find some of his ""memories"" of Diana and Dodi's relationship a little delusional. Afterall, they had only been seeing one another for 11 days. I'm sure Dodi did buy Diana a gorgeous ring but those closest to her insist Diana would never have married Dodi. Diana loved her boys too much to make such an outrageous decision.Most of the video footage and photos are nothing new to the public, however, there is an incredible glimpse inside the home of Wallis Simpson and the abdicated King George VIII, Prince Edward. Al Fayed speculates that Diana and Dodi were going to live at the House of Windsor in France once they were married. Dodi's bereaved father claims the Princess and the playboy were going to announce their engagement THAT Monday....had they survived. I doubt this as do her closest confidantes. Andrew Morton, Penny Thornton and others give convincing and kind insights into the private and public life of one of the greatest, most beautiful and fascinating women of the 20th century.
