That being said, I was pretty excited to check this movie out since both are included.  I REALLY wanted to love this movie and honestly went into it with the intention of recommending it to everyone.  However, after finishing it, I just can't do that.  The major problem with this film is the timing.  I was well over half way through before the synopsis even began to play out.  Once it finally did become the movie I was hoping it to be, it was over.  They took FAR too much time building a backstory for the characters and once that was done, it was almost if they realized, ""Woah...we need to wrap this thing up!""  It was mostly 1:15 story telling, 15 minutes action.  Now for some movies that's perfectly fine, but going into this thinking it's a ACTION/SHOOT-EM-UP, it completely let me down.The movie follows Detective Bud Carter (Willem Dafoe) and his investigation into contract assassin, Jesse Weiland (Matt Dillion).  Without ruining anything (this is actually in the synopsis), Detective Carter eventually catches Jesse and turns him into a ""rat"" with the intentions of bringing down a massive crime syndicate.  Once the the organization discovers Jesse's betrayal, they off his family and Jesse seeks his revenge.  Sounds awesome, doesn't it?!  I thought so too!  Problem is, by the time Jesse's family is gone, there is only around 15 minutes of the movie left?  That killed it for me.  I was really amped up on watching a ""Death Sentence"" type movie, but sadly, that isn't what I got.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't a complete waste or loss.  For the most part it does keep you interested, but I just felt that there was so much more that could've been done to bring it up to the level that it should have been.  I can see myself watching it on cable TV at home on the weekend, but other than that.....Final Verdict:  PASS on this one.If you found my review to be helpful please let me know by clicking the ""yes"" button below so I feel like I'm doing something right.

1679090,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00GMV8JEA,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","It's always great to see an actor rise from what he once was to something far better. Such has been the case, at least for me, when I look at the career of Matt Dillon. He began as a teen heartthrob back in the seventies and at the time I was never quite fond of him. His acting always seemed the same to me, a sullen look and grin that became repetitive instead of showing acting ability. As he aged though, Dillon began to show that he did indeed have some acting chops. His roles became more adult in a good way rather than the sordid style some young actors take. His latest shows he still has plenty of great roles yet to come.BAD COUNTRY takes place in the seventies in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A huge crime syndicate runs almost every criminal enterprise in the county. Someone high up in the organization has the money and means to pay off judges, law enforcement and anyone who might stand in their way. Detective Bud Carter (Willem Dafoe) has had enough of it. He wants to take down the man at the top, bypassing the small fries that he always seems to get. A chance arrest of one of these men gives him that opportunity.Jesse Wieland (Dillon) has done tough time in prison in the past. Facing more time isn't anything he can't handle physically. But as a new father, married to a woman he loves (Amy Smart), he wants to be outside to raise his child. Carter offers him a chance to do so by becoming an informant, a man inside that will help him bring down the syndicate. At first Jesse turns down the offer. When the man outside has his drug using brother, also in prison, killed, Jesse decides to have his revenge.With the hope of taking on the syndicate now Carter is disappointed when the Feds jump onboard. Instead of a seasoned vet they send in a green attorney to head the investigation, a man on his first case. To say that the teams involved don't work well together is an understatement. The local police, the FBI and the ATF all want a piece of the action. It's the ineptitude of the Federal agencies that nearly bring the whole thing to a horrible collapse.Jesse works his way back into the syndicate headed by Lutin (Tom Berenger). While Lutin may try to appear to be a father figure of sorts to his crew he is indeed the most ruthless man living in Louisiana at the time. Jesse pulls off a jewel theft for him to start and then works up to buying illegal arms. When that deal goes bad due to one of his crew losing his temper, all hell breaks lose and the chances of the entire project are up in the air. Only Jesse can save this sting and in doing so will have to lay his life on the line.When you have an ensemble cast like this one, one of two things can happen. A single actor can chew up the scenery and spit it out making the entire cast look bad. Or they can work harmoniously to achieve a solid story and film that entertains and keeps your interest. The second is what happens here. Dafoe's portrayal of Carter displays a man desperate to make a difference but at the same time with enough heart to want to protect even a contract killer like Jesse when he's placed in harm's way. Dillon shows a man dealing with the mistakes of his past in the hope of redeeming himself. And Berenger, a great actor rarely given the roles he deserves these days, brings life to Lutin making him seem like an elder statesman of crime who is every bit as lethal when brought face to face with someone as he was when he was younger. Toss in Neal McDonough in a role unlike those he's played before and you have a great cast working at top form.While an entertaining and well done film, this is not what I would consider Oscar material. Instead it does the best thing a movie can do by telling a story and making you feel for the characters involved. Some could have had more development along those lines but the two leads make you want something good to happen their way. You want the bad guys to get their just deserts. By the last 30 minutes you beg for that to happen.So get ready to feel that southern humidity ooze out of your pores. Grab a sweet tea and set back. Know that bad times are coming for some and heroics from others. And finally sit back and enjoy the ride.",3,TROUBLE IN LOUISIANA,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,4189,"['always', 'great', 'see', 'actor', 'rise', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'something', 'far', 'better', 'Such', 'been', 'case', 'least', 'when', 'look', 'career', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'began', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'back', 'seventies', 'time', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'fond', 'acting', 'always', 'seemed', 'same', 'sullen', 'look', 'grin', 'became', 'repetitive', 'instead', 'showing', 'acting', 'ability', 'aged', 'though', 'Dillon', 'began', 'show', 'did', 'indeed', 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'roles', 'became', 'more', 'adult', 'good', 'way', 'rather', 'sordid', 'style', 'young', 'actors', 'take', 'latest', 'still', 'plenty', 'great', 'roles', 'yet', 'come.BAD', 'COUNTRY', 'place', 'seventies', 'Baton', 'Rouge', 'Louisiana', 'A', 'huge', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'almost', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'county', 'Someone', 'high', 'up', 'organization', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'judges', 'law', 'enforcement', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'stand', 'way', 'Detective', 'Bud', 'Carter', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'had', 'take', 'down', 'man', 'top', 'bypassing', 'small', 'fries', 'always', 'get', 'chance', 'arrest', 'one', 'men', 'opportunity.Jesse', 'Wieland', 'Dillon', 'done', 'tough', 'time', 'prison', 'past', 'Facing', 'more', 'time', ""n't"", 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'physically', 'new', 'father', 'married', 'woman', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'be', 'outside', 'raise', 'child', 'Carter', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'becoming', 'informant', 'man', 'will', 'help', 'bring', 'down', 'syndicate', 'first', 'Jesse', 'down', 'offer', 'When', 'man', 'drug', 'using', 'brother', 'also', 'prison', 'killed', 'Jesse', 'have', 'revenge.With', 'hope', 'taking', 'syndicate', 'now', 'Carter', 'disappointed', 'when', 'Feds', 'jump', 'onboard', 'Instead', 'seasoned', 'vet', 'send', 'green', 'attorney', 'head', 'investigation', 'man', 'first', 'case', 'say', 'teams', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'together', 'understatement', 'local', 'police', 'FBI', 'ATF', 'want', 'piece', 'action', 'ineptitude', 'Federal', 'agencies', 'nearly', 'bring', 'whole', 'thing', 'horrible', 'collapse.Jesse', 'way', 'back', 'syndicate', 'headed', 'Lutin', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'Lutin', 'may', 'try', 'appear', 'be', 'father', 'figure', 'sorts', 'crew', 'indeed', 'most', 'ruthless', 'man', 'living', 'Louisiana', 'time', 'Jesse', 'jewel', 'theft', 'start', 'then', 'up', 'buying', 'illegal', 'arms', 'When', 'deal', 'bad', 'due', 'one', 'crew', 'losing', 'temper', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'chances', 'entire', 'project', 'are', 'up', 'air', 'Only', 'Jesse', 'can', 'save', 'sting', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'have', 'lay', 'life', 'line.When', 'have', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'one', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'single', 'actor', 'can', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'spit', 'out', 'making', 'entire', 'cast', 'look', 'bad', 'can', 'work', 'harmoniously', 'achieve', 'solid', 'story', 'film', 'interest', 'second', 'what', 'here', 'Dafoe', 'portrayal', 'Carter', 'man', 'desperate', 'make', 'difference', 'same', 'time', 'enough', 'heart', 'want', 'protect', 'even', 'contract', 'killer', 'Jesse', 'when', 'placed', 'harm', 'way', 'Dillon', 'man', 'dealing', 'mistakes', 'past', 'hope', 'redeeming', 'Berenger', 'great', 'actor', 'rarely', 'given', 'roles', 'days', 'life', 'Lutin', 'making', 'seem', 'elder', 'statesman', 'crime', 'who', 'bit', 'lethal', 'when', 'brought', 'face', 'face', 'someone', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Toss', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'role', 'played', 'have', 'great', 'cast', 'working', 'top', 'form.While', 'entertaining', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'Oscar', 'material', 'Instead', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'telling', 'story', 'making', 'feel', 'characters', 'involved', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'development', 'lines', 'two', 'leads', 'make', 'want', 'something', 'good', 'happen', 'way', 'want', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'just', 'deserts', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'beg', 'happen.So', 'get', 'ready', 'feel', 'southern', 'humidity', 'pores', 'Grab', 'sweet', 'tea', 'set', 'back', 'Know', 'bad', 'times', 'are', 'coming', 'heroics', 'others', 'finally', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride']",N/A

(The same applies when I don&#8217;t like a film that everybody else seems to revere.)In this particular instance, I&#8217;m referring to BAD COUNTRY (2014), released onto Blu-Ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment and out of favor in just about every review I&#8217;ve read thus far.I&#8217;m not claiming that this picture, directed by Chris Brinker, doesn&#8217;t have faults, but as a tense, brutal crime drama, BAD COUNTRY it&#8217;s quite entertaining.  Supposedly based on a true story, the basic plot of the movie has been a prototype of the genre for decades.  It deals with a career felon who wants to change his life and, to do so, he agrees to become an undercover informant and help take down a major criminal organization.  What makes this version of the story rather unique is that, rather  than the action being set in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles, it takes place, for the most part, in the seedier parts of otherwise colorful Baton Rouge, Louisiana.Matt Dillon stars as a former hit man for crime kingpin Tom Berenger, who is arrested on a series of burglary charges and because of his past record, faces life in prison.  Wishing to start a new life with wife Amy Smart and his new baby son, Dillon makes a deal with cop Willem Dafoe to help him get Berenger, whose nefarious activities also are of interest to Federal authorities.The cast, which also includes Neal McDonough and Bill Duke, is first-rate, delivering compelling performances all around.  The script contains a fair amount of unexpected turns, and the gritty action sequences are well staged.  Overall, BAD COUNTRY is a pretty good picture, yet it certainly could have been better.At 95 minutes running time, several story elements in the movie remain sketchy.  Without overstaying its welcome, the screenplay could have included a bit more character development and, most importantly, more explanation as to the relationship between the various law enforcements agencies involved in the criminal investigation, as what is transpiring between them on screen is not always clear.  I also felt that, as well staged as it was, the final shootout and confrontation between Dillon and Berenger goes on a bit too long.Extras on the Blu-Ray disc include deleted scenes and a &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurette.

It's gritty, surprising and so damn entertaining; it is a movie I will purchase the DVD so I may watch it whenever I want to. I thought the end of the film was really great, it left you wondering whats more to the story without leaving you hanging waiting for a part 2; but it allows you to speculate the &#34;what if&#34; of the film. If you have watched the movie &#34;No Country for Old Men&#34; and loved it, you will love this movie too.Don Yesso's character I think was down played too much. I believe his character had a lot to contribute, and was short sighted. Don Yesso has a strong presence and the ability to pull off this character, in a sence I don't believe they gave Don enough in this role for his acting ability.There are some outstanding shoot-out scenes that were very fun, I am very critical when it comes to weapons and how they are used in movies; this was well done.Enjoy!",5,Bad Country is Bad A$$!,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,1355,"['movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'was', 'outstanding', 'believe', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'actor', 'movie', 'changed', 'opinion', 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'seeing', 'opening', 'credits', 'read', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'was', 'movie', 'first', 'thought', 'was', '34', 'movie', 'going', 'suck', '34', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'proved', 'wrong', 'acting', 'was', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'perform', 'have', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'friends', 'gritty', 'surprising', 'so', 'damn', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'will', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'may', 'watch', 'whenever', 'want', 'thought', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'left', 'wondering', 'whats', 'more', 'story', 'leaving', 'hanging', 'waiting', 'part', '2', 'speculate', '34', 'what', '34', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', '34', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', '34', 'loved', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'Yesso', 'character', 'think', 'was', 'down', 'played', 'too', 'much', 'believe', 'character', 'had', 'lot', 'contribute', 'was', 'short', 'sighted', 'Don', 'Yesso', 'strong', 'presence', 'ability', 'pull', 'off', 'character', 'sence', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'gave', 'Don', 'enough', 'role', 'acting', 'are', 'outstanding', 'shoot-out', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'fun', 'am', 'very', 'critical', 'when', 'weapons', 'how', 'are', 'used', 'movies', 'was', 'well', 'done.Enjoy']",N/A

From a lone snitch, a crime empire is taken down. Bud Carter (Willem Dafoe) is the local detective who has discovered the operation. With the ineffective help of the government and inside man Jesse (Matt Dillon), Carter struggles to do his job.Being based on a true story hampers some of the drama. There were plenty of shoot'em up scenes. I thought Dafoe and Dillon did great jobs in their roles, but somehow the local flavor of Louisiana didn't come through. The sound track needed to be taken to another level. We needed to see more of the crimes action. It is listed as a gritty crime action thriller.

Detective Bud Carter played with veteran zeal by, possibly the most reliable character actor in America, Willem Dafoe realises he is on to something big when a chance undercover operation leads to him being given the name of someone higher up the crime food chain. This is Matt Dillon playing white supremacist and life choice criminal, Jesse Weiland .He is at first a hard nut to crack but the ineptness of his underworld cronies soon leaves him with little option but to turn informant. That is when the whole thing starts moving inexorably towards the demise of one side or the other.This is a really well made film production wise with strong performances and convincing conviction from all the players most notably the two leads and Tom Berringer who owns nigh on every scene he is in. There are a couple of plot holes and incidents of what has to be called `poetic licence' but this is `based on' a true story and as my Granddad used to say `you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story and by jingo the makers have taken that to heart.  There is a fair amount of action, plenty of earthy language and enough plot to keep you hooked right from the very start, so long as you can suspend belief a few times - easily recommended for some `not to be taken seriously' viewing.",3,Yes this is flawed but actually quite a good watch for all that.,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,1353,"['Set', 'Baton', 'Rouge', '1983', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Detective', 'Bud', 'Carter', 'played', 'veteran', 'zeal', 'possibly', 'most', 'reliable', 'character', 'actor', 'America', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'something', 'big', 'when', 'chance', 'undercover', 'operation', 'being', 'given', 'name', 'someone', 'higher', 'crime', 'food', 'chain', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'playing', 'white', 'supremacist', 'life', 'choice', 'criminal', 'Jesse', 'Weiland', '.He', 'first', 'hard', 'nut', 'crack', 'ineptness', 'underworld', 'cronies', 'soon', 'little', 'option', 'turn', 'informant', 'when', 'whole', 'thing', 'moving', 'inexorably', 'demise', 'one', 'side', 'other.This', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'production', 'wise', 'strong', 'performances', 'convincing', 'conviction', 'players', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'leads', 'Tom', 'Berringer', 'who', 'nigh', 'scene', 'are', 'couple', 'plot', 'holes', 'incidents', 'be', 'called', 'poetic', 'licence', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Granddad', 'used', 'say', 'should', 'never', 'let', 'truth', 'get', 'way', 'good', 'story', 'jingo', 'makers', 'have', 'taken', 'heart', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'plenty', 'earthy', 'language', 'enough', 'plot', 'keep', 'hooked', 'right', 'very', 'start', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'suspend', 'belief', 'few', 'times', 'easily', 'recommended', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'viewing']",N/A

The fact that it is based on a true story helps too. This is however yet another movie that has a great cast but isn't a great movie.

If you are looking to be knocked off your feet, go watch Lawless, or Captain America, or 47 Ronin, or The Wolverine.  This is not a well-written, thrilling story.  It is a mediocre, realistic crime drama with a tone more like that of a TV movie.  The difference is that these characters are brought to life by acting heavyweights!  Even the smallest part is well-acted.  You will HATE the bad guys and admire the good ones.The worst part, in my opinion, is when our hero cop (Willem Dafoe), roughs up the corrupt lawyer (Neal McDonough), who physically is like a superhero.  Neal REALLY HAS TO ACT.  I laughed at that part, and it brought me out of the story.  You'll see why.The ending was not satisfying at all.  It made me feel like all of the risk our anti-hero (Matt Dillon) went through was for nothing.  The last scene is presented as if we should think it is a slick move, a bit of poetic justice--but frankly someone's head needed to be blown off.  It was NOT a clever ending, but a soft, weak-kneed portrayal of our ineffective justice system.This movie felt realistic.  It is worth watching if you have already seen all the better movies out.
