This is a story of a high school principal and a janitor.  Who would ever think the two would fall in love, but they do.  It causes an uproar in the community, but the principal stands her ground.  It's a fun movie to watch.

Unfortunately, the only VHS tape I ended up with was taped on SLP, and missed the first few minutes of the movie.  I just transferred it to DVD last night, and thoroughly enjoyed watching it again.I'm not sure if this love story really could happen in real life, but I hope it can! Christine Lahti is believable and endearing (and gorgeous - I wish I had those clothes!). While being well known as a musician, Ruben Blades has proven that he's an excellent actor with very diverse roles.I'd love to have a professional DVD of this movie.
