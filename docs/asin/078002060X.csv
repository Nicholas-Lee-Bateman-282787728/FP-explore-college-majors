24251,A2YZA0SRHMMEOO,078002060X,Carol Collins,"[10, 11]","An older black & white film about a southern family in the early 30s when success or failure depended on the elements (rain, drought) and the good will of neighbors.  It's a film about people and they don't make that kind of film anymore.  Nobody commits adultery, love scenes that didn't embarrass me (I'm not a Peeping Tom) there is no blood and guts (although it is threatened at one point) and the people work hard and are loyal, care about each other, and the ending is believable...not happy ever after...but more like it was...and is.  Scott acts one of the few parts  he has had who is sympathetic.  Betty Field was a great actress, as was Beulah Bondi. J. Carrol Naish played every ethnicity except his own (Irish) and this time he had no accent.  Scott was a also very accomplished actor.

As a youngster, I got to meet both of them when they were on the summer stock circuit on the East Coast.  They were outstanding and talented stage performers, and exceptionally, kind individuals.After appearing in ""The Mask of Dimitrios"" at Warner Bros., Scott's portrayal of Sam Tucker, cotton farmer, was one of his few, non-heavy roles in film that he was able to get away from Warner to complete.  Betty Field was also well-known for her wonderful performance in ""Of Mice and Men"" with Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney, Jr.Together, in ""The Southerner"", Scott and Field have a striking chemistry and are thoroughly convincing as husband and wife, loving parents, and struggling farmers.Apparently, Jean Renoir refused to become involved in the film production, unless he was allowed to the rewrite the screenplay, himself.  The film, in black and white, has an expressive, gritty, graphic quality, due to Renoir and cinematographer, French-born, Lucien Andriot.However, this particular, DVD version, has no support material and, no main menu.  It is solely the film, which should have been restored.  Having said that, we're lucky to have the film on DVD, at all.At the same time, I am also enjoying the (2006) biography, Zachary Scott:  Hollywood's Sophisticated  Cad by Ronald L. Davis.  It's a good read, and underscores Scott's struggles and frustration to become a complete, dramatic star in Hollywood.I almost wish, when Scott visited London, as a young man, that he would have remained there to continue his studies in Shakespeare.  Instead, he choose to quickly return to the New York stage, and eventually, seek his fortune in Hollywood.  I wonder, how far he would have been able to stretch his dramatic skills?",4,Part of cinematic history and underrated,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,1793,"['have', 'admit', 'am', 'fan', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'Betty', 'Fields', 'youngster', 'got', 'meet', 'when', 'were', 'summer', 'stock', 'circuit', 'East', 'Coast', 'were', 'outstanding', 'talented', 'stage', 'performers', 'exceptionally', 'kind', 'individuals.After', 'appearing', 'Mask', 'Dimitrios', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Scott', 'portrayal', 'Sam', 'Tucker', 'cotton', 'farmer', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'non-heavy', 'roles', 'film', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'Warner', 'complete', 'Betty', 'Field', 'was', 'also', 'well-known', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Mice', 'Men', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.Together', 'Southerner', 'Scott', 'Field', 'have', 'striking', 'chemistry', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'husband', 'wife', 'loving', 'parents', 'struggling', 'farmers.Apparently', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'refused', 'become', 'involved', 'film', 'production', 'was', 'allowed', 'rewrite', 'screenplay', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'expressive', 'gritty', 'graphic', 'quality', 'due', 'Renoir', 'cinematographer', 'French-born', 'Lucien', 'Andriot.However', 'particular', 'DVD', 'version', 'support', 'material', 'main', 'menu', 'solely', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'Having', 'said', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'have', 'film', 'DVD', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'also', 'enjoying', '2006', 'biography', 'Zachary', 'Scott', 'Hollywood', 'Sophisticated', 'Cad', 'Ronald', 'L.', 'Davis', 'good', 'read', 'Scott', 'struggles', 'frustration', 'become', 'complete', 'dramatic', 'star', 'Hollywood.I', 'almost', 'wish', 'when', 'Scott', 'visited', 'London', 'young', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'remained', 'there', 'continue', 'studies', 'Shakespeare', 'Instead', 'choose', 'quickly', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'stage', 'eventually', 'seek', 'fortune', 'Hollywood', 'wonder', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'stretch', 'dramatic', 'skills']",N/A

First, this is a Jean Renoir film and many think he is the best director ever, certainly in the top five. Second, this is a film most of us can identify with at some level. It's about wanting a piece of the American dream, about starting your own business (farm) and creating something based on your abilities and desires. It's about trying to beat the odds, the odds like nature, no money, opponents and limited resources to make it. It's about having faith in yourself and in a higher power that gives purpose and meaning to what you do. Is there justice in this world for those who work hard and live a moral and upright life? You may or may not think so after watching this film. It's another reminder of what makes this country so great are the opportunities that it gives; though not are all equal, they are there for those with the courage and perseverance to follow a dream. Though the film quality is a little poor and Beulah Bondi as Granny Tucker is a weak link in the movie, it is definitely worth watching this little slice of Americana.

A hard working and industrious farm worker, who longs for something of his own, becomes a sharecropper. The place is a broken down wreck, needing massive amounts of backbreaking work. The land is not his, and there's a decent chance that the owner will take advantage of this by selling the land out from under him. The farmer's evil neighbor is almost as poor as he is, and it turns out that his behavior is mostly about survival in this unforgiving place. . Clearly the original script must have been about the helplessness of people caught up in this system.But there seems to have been some kind of pressure on the director or writers, to moderate the story and make it less political. The owner does not do the worst.  The sharecropper's hopes are turned into something more like the American Dream, with the whole family pitching in to give the thing a go despite horrible luck. The viewer doesn't know what will happen. If the farmer owned the farm, we would know things would come round. As it turns out we get a sort of happy ending that doesn't quite let the sharecropper system off the hook.The movie is very entertaining.  It's really about the whole family, not just the father. The wife and granny in particular are endearing. 1930s poverty is realistically portrayed. Yes, it really was this bad.The Southerner was made by a Frenchman, and the mistakes made are downright odd. This American South looks and sounds quite a bit like 1930s New England, which still had working farms and migrant workers. Southern accents, black people and black culture are absent.
