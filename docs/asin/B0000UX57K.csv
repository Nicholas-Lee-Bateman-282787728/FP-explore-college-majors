The audio cd is good but the the DVD concert is worth the purchase alone. Chester Bennington's vocals are spot-on and jeez I don't know how he can sing, scream, and belt for two hours straight! He's an amazing frontman, and Mike Shioda never skips a beat with his rapping styles, I was really impressed. The band have a lot of staying-power as well. Every song this band plays sounds good and refreshing.

Tight, energetic, strong vocals, a real layered sound achieved instrumentally and with Mr Hahn's manual scratching, keyboards and occasional loop. The sound on the DVD and CD sounds great to me.

I felt like I was watching MTV cribs or something. Ridiculous. The cuts were so fast and jerky, it was hard to get a fix on anything. As a drummer, I like to check out the drummer and see what he's doing. It was just about worthless in that regard. The occasional drum shots lasted about a second.

784339,A3O930D1JAQEKV,B0000UX57K,ReaderInChicago,"[4, 5]","I always really liked Linkin Park, but this DVD was life-altering in my musical world.  I had just turned 42 years old when this came out and I'm a single mom of a teenager.  I have been into punk/alternative music since the early 1980's and my musical tastes have evolved with the genre up to and including now.  I'm not your typical Linkin Park fan.  It's funny when they refer to their fans as ""the kids"" because I'm clearly not ""a kid"" (though a kid at heart) and the two concerts I've seen since this DVD came out had lots of people my age, and not just parents bringing their kids (and since I was a parent bringing my kid-I'm really the bigger fan, though he also loves LP--I wonder how many other ""parents"" were like me, that is, attending the concert because they love LP too).But about this DVD in particular.  I saw a preview of the DVD at the theatre the evening before it was released.  I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY.  I simply could not believe how good they are.  I had purchased all three of their previous CDs as each was released, but I guess I never paid that close of attention to their music.  So I purchased the CD/DVD the next day as it was released.  I also pulled out all three of their other CDs from my CD collection and put them in my car with Live in Texas.  That was about a year ago.  I have listened to Linkin Park almost non-stop ever since.I honestly believe that Linkin Park is one of the best bands of all time.  The concept behind their music is so novel in comparison to other alternative bands.  Now some people say, well they sound like so-and-so, but it is the other bands that are copying LP, not the other way around (if you compare the chronologies of their CD releases, you will see what I mean).  A lot of people that give Amazon reviews rank songs in their CDs, but I find that impossible to do.  While there are one or two songs I don't like as much as the others (and I'm talking 1 or 2 out of ALL their songs, not per album), ALL of their songs are really great!If you like Linkin Park, but have never seriously listened to their music, I highly recommend this CD/DVD.
