1463697,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B005KBP07W,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[1, 1]","Michael and Daniel are a gay couple, who fled the urban craziness of New York City, and relocated to a small Connecticut town.  Michael is a teacher at a private high school, and working on a novel in his spare time,  while Daniel is establishing a reputation as a creative caterer.  They quickly make some gay and straight friends in the area, and are reasonably open about their sexuality to all.All hell breaks loose, when the parent of one of Michael's students charges that the teacher had made passes to the boy.  He is fired from his job, and shunned by most of the town.  When it comes out that there was a previous arrest in NYC - a matter of entrapment, that Michael never told to Daniel - it also threatens to ruin their relationship.  But Michael is most disappointed by the fact that the student doesn't confirm that nothing happened between them.Small town attitudes confusing homosexuality with pedophilia is far from an original concept for a story, and there is not really much new here.  As is usually the case, there is a secret that doesn't come out until the end, which explains the actions of the student.  The acting is first rate, especially Jason Butler Harner and Cheyenne Jackson as Michael and Daniel, respectively.  Production values seem above average, especially for a low budget indie.  My only beef is the story is nothing really new.

1463700,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005KBP07W,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[8, 12]","THE GREEN (2011, 93 minutes, not to be confused with the 2001 or 2009 films of the same title) is an independent film which has a strange, After School Special vibe to it. It sometimes works and often does not: the thing borrows too much from the worst Eurotrash films. While I desperately hope this is not the way the life of a gay couple is perceived, I can also see the great merit of the story - unnecessarily operatic though it might be. It was a tonic for me anyway, since I'd been casting about for a decent gay-themed film for a few years now.What a wait.Michael (Jason Butler Harner, a gaunt-faced bit player) and his stunning boyfriend of 15 years, Daniel (Cheyenne Jackson, best known from ""Glee"", ""30 Rock"" and his famous marriage to his real-life boyfriend), have moved to small-town Connecticut to escape NYC (to ""see green"", as Michael puts it, hence the brilliant title). Michael is a high school academy teacher and as yet I have no actual idea what Daniel does, beyond catering. When Michael is accused out of thin air of having an affair with a student (little-known newcomer Chris Bert, as Christopher Bert), all hell breaks loose.This is when the directing and story get a little out of control. Naturally there is nothing happening, and on the face of it this is just another stupid movie about an innocent teacher/student relationship that is horribly tarred with the brush of crime. What does matter here is that the teacher is gay, the boy is actually being molested by his mother's boyfriend, and Michael loses his boyfriend over an incredibly stupid 14-year-old incident.The acting is excellent. Michael the lead should have been played by someone else - Jared Leto comes to mind - but it is otherwise understandable what this film is trying to tell us. It is telling us that the road gay people must travel is not the beautifully finished highway the rest of America is travelling.My only wish is that it had been done on a grand scale, with a better story, and not so much fear on the producers' end. This film literally took me over a week to find on my pay-per-view, and that tells it all. It always leaves a bitter aftertaste, that fear and shame connected with gay-themed films. Perhaps that whole film really means to tell us only that.May I add that one thing about this film - the thing transcending mere film and storytelling yet is shown so well here - is the libel and slander endured daily by the gay community. Everyday, gay people are blindly libeled and slandered with accusations of rape, prostitution, child molestation/pedophilia, pornography, and even of being infected with AIDS (yes, that kind of false allegation is also libelous/slanderous).The fact that our gay teacher in the story is immediately suspected of attempting to seduce his student is exemplary of this overriding, horrific problem. The teacher here is immediately slandered, without hesitation or guilt. Unbelievably, even the teacher's boyfriend wishes to understand for sure that nothing is happening with the young student.Filmed on location in Connecticut. With the added talents of Julia Ormond, Illeana Douglas, Bill Sage, and Michael Godere (a/k/a Michael Goduti).",3,Life Hasn't Changed for Gay People,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,3186,"['GREEN', '2011', '93', 'minutes', 'not', 'be', 'confused', '2001', '2009', 'films', 'same', 'title', 'independent', 'film', 'strange', 'School', 'Special', 'vibe', 'sometimes', 'often', 'not', 'thing', 'too', 'much', 'worst', 'Eurotrash', 'films', 'desperately', 'hope', 'not', 'way', 'life', 'gay', 'couple', 'perceived', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'great', 'merit', 'story', 'unnecessarily', 'operatic', 'might', 'be', 'was', 'tonic', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'been', 'casting', 'decent', 'gay-themed', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'wait.Michael', 'Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'gaunt-faced', 'bit', 'player', 'stunning', 'boyfriend', '15', 'years', 'Daniel', 'Cheyenne', 'Jackson', 'best', 'known', 'Glee', '30', 'Rock', 'famous', 'marriage', 'real-life', 'boyfriend', 'have', 'moved', 'small-town', 'Connecticut', 'escape', 'NYC', 'see', 'green', 'Michael', 'hence', 'brilliant', 'title', 'Michael', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'yet', 'have', 'actual', 'idea', 'what', 'Daniel', 'catering', 'When', 'Michael', 'accused', 'thin', 'air', 'having', 'affair', 'student', 'little-known', 'newcomer', 'Chris', 'Bert', 'Christopher', 'Bert', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose.This', 'when', 'directing', 'story', 'get', 'little', 'control', 'Naturally', 'nothing', 'happening', 'face', 'just', 'stupid', 'movie', 'innocent', 'teacher/student', 'relationship', 'horribly', 'tarred', 'brush', 'crime', 'What', 'matter', 'here', 'teacher', 'gay', 'boy', 'actually', 'being', 'molested', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'Michael', 'boyfriend', 'incredibly', 'stupid', '14-year-old', 'incident.The', 'acting', 'excellent', 'Michael', 'lead', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'someone', 'else', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'mind', 'otherwise', 'understandable', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'tell', 'telling', 'road', 'gay', 'people', 'must', 'travel', 'not', 'beautifully', 'finished', 'highway', 'rest', 'America', 'travelling.My', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'grand', 'scale', 'better', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'fear', 'producers', 'end', 'film', 'literally', 'took', 'over', 'week', 'find', 'pay-per-view', 'always', 'bitter', 'aftertaste', 'fear', 'shame', 'connected', 'gay-themed', 'films', 'Perhaps', 'whole', 'film', 'really', 'tell', 'only', 'that.May', 'add', 'one', 'thing', 'film', 'thing', 'transcending', 'mere', 'film', 'storytelling', 'yet', 'shown', 'so', 'well', 'here', 'libel', 'slander', 'endured', 'daily', 'gay', 'community', 'Everyday', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'blindly', 'libeled', 'slandered', 'accusations', 'rape', 'prostitution', 'child', 'molestation/pedophilia', 'pornography', 'even', 'being', 'infected', 'AIDS', 'yes', 'kind', 'false', 'allegation', 'also', 'libelous/slanderous', '.The', 'fact', 'gay', 'teacher', 'story', 'immediately', 'suspected', 'attempting', 'seduce', 'student', 'exemplary', 'overriding', 'horrific', 'problem', 'teacher', 'here', 'immediately', 'slandered', 'hesitation', 'guilt', 'Unbelievably', 'even', 'teacher', 'boyfriend', 'understand', 'sure', 'nothing', 'happening', 'young', 'student.Filmed', 'location', 'Connecticut', 'added', 'talents', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'Michael', 'Godere', 'Michael', 'Goduti']",The Green

1463702,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005KBP07W,Grady Harp,"[30, 31]","THE GREEN (to satisfy many people's quandary about the name) refers to the luxuriant fields and trees of Connecticut: in this film it represents the haven for escaping the chaos of New York City to the quiet and civilized country.  Strike 'civilized', as this film is about anything but civilized behavior on the part of the townspeople where schoolteacher/writer Michael Gavin (Jason Butler Harner) and his longtime partner, locavore caterer Daniel (Cheyenne Jackson) move from the chaotic life of New York City to the gentility of the small Connecticut town.  Michael and Gavin are gay: Michael elects to keep his sexuality sub rosa in his new job as a teacher in a private high school, a 'don't ask-don't tell' adaptation, while Daniel simply goes about his catering business with his assistant Glenn (Michael Godere).  Michael makes a good friend with Trish (Illeana Douglas) who has a healthy outlook despite the presence of recurring cancer requiring chemotherapy.  Trish tries to warn Michael of the gossip in the school, but it is not until Michael attempts to defend a bright student Jason (Chris Bert) that the students and teachers and parents accuse Michael of inappropriate behavior with the shy Jason.Once the accusation is made the town escalates the situation, Jason runs away from home, and Jason's parents Leo (Bill Sage) and Janette (Karen Young) decide to go after Michael in court.  The men's friends Philip (Boris McGiver) and Bethanne (Mary B. McCann) attempt to help Michael but it becomes apparent that Michael need's a special lawyer - and that expert lawyer is Karen (Julia Ormond) who happens to be in a committed lesbian relationship. An old truth comes out: Michael had a prior arrest in NYC years ago for indecent exposure (police entrapment), but worse than for the case progress is the fact that Michael has never told Daniel about the incident, a fact that creates a serious schism between the two men.  There is a surprising truth that enters into the story that provides an ending few could anticipate and revealing any aspect of it would taint the experience of the new viewer.The brilliant script was written by Paul Marcarelli and the film is directed with great sensitivity by Steven Williford. The entire cast is first rate, but special kudos have been earned by Jason Butler Harner, Cheyenne Jackson, Illeana Douglas and Julia Ormond - each deserves careful consideration for awards.  But the power of this excellent film is the presentation of homophobia both on the part of the townspeople and students and faculty, but also in the way Michael has elected to lead his life: his own fear of his true identity is as much the cause of his downfall as the external forces.  There are many lessons to be learned form this film, but above all THE GREEN is an example of superb American independent film making at its best, presenting an excellent story in a sophisticated, mature, and reasonable manner.

1463705,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B005KBP07W,J. Martin,"[1, 1]","What's great about this movie is that it provokes serious thought and examination of prejudices and habitual reactions that may not be the truest response to a particular situation.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW.What bothers me most about this movie is that the teacher's inappropriate behavior toward the student is so much overshadowed by subsequent events - the overreaction of the townspeople and the uncovering of much worse abuse from another adult - that the teacher, in the end, comes out looking like a martyr and a hero. He was not a hero, and if he was a martyr it was only to his own egoism and delusional behavior.His relationship with the boy was inappropriate from the very beginning - he had an unhealthy obsession, a possessiveness, and a sense of entitlement to interfere in the boy's private life that no teacher ought to have for any student, of any sex. Behavior like that toward a child - particularly a child who was not his own - is always and unequivocally inappropriate and inherently abusive. When the abuser is a teacher, with all the emotional and spiritual power any teacher has over any student, particularly a child, the abuse is especially inexcusable.This movie masks the teacher's emotionally abusive behavior behind the other adult's physical abuse, so that he comes out smelling like a rose in contrast. The other abuser at least admitted the abuse when confronted; the teacher continued to insist - and probably believe - that he had done nothing wrong. That is outrageous.END OF SPOILERSCheyenne Jackson gives an exceptionally strong, intelligent performance as the teacher's boyfriend; the other actors vary from very good (Julia Ormond as the lawyer) to reliable (Bill Sage as the mom's boyfriend, and most of the other actors) to barely competent (Chris Bert as the kid).",3,"Provocative, unsettling (in a good way) movie about child abuse in various forms",1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,1807,"['What', 'great', 'movie', 'serious', 'thought', 'examination', 'prejudices', 'habitual', 'reactions', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'truest', 'response', 'particular', 'situation.POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS', 'FOLLOW.What', 'most', 'movie', 'teacher', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'student', 'so', 'much', 'overshadowed', 'subsequent', 'events', 'overreaction', 'townspeople', 'uncovering', 'much', 'worse', 'abuse', 'adult', 'teacher', 'end', 'out', 'looking', 'martyr', 'hero', 'was', 'not', 'hero', 'was', 'martyr', 'was', 'only', 'own', 'egoism', 'delusional', 'behavior.His', 'relationship', 'boy', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'very', 'beginning', 'had', 'unhealthy', 'obsession', 'possessiveness', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'interfere', 'boy', 'private', 'life', 'teacher', 'ought', 'have', 'student', 'sex', 'Behavior', 'child', 'particularly', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'own', 'always', 'unequivocally', 'inappropriate', 'inherently', 'abusive', 'When', 'abuser', 'teacher', 'emotional', 'spiritual', 'power', 'teacher', 'over', 'student', 'particularly', 'child', 'abuse', 'especially', 'inexcusable.This', 'movie', 'teacher', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'behavior', 'other', 'adult', 'physical', 'abuse', 'so', 'out', 'smelling', 'rose', 'contrast', 'other', 'abuser', 'least', 'admitted', 'abuse', 'when', 'confronted', 'teacher', 'continued', 'insist', 'probably', 'believe', 'had', 'done', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'outrageous.END', 'OF', 'SPOILERSCheyenne', 'Jackson', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'performance', 'teacher', 'boyfriend', 'other', 'actors', 'vary', 'very', 'good', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'lawyer', 'reliable', 'Bill', 'Sage', 'mom', 'boyfriend', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'barely', 'competent', 'Chris', 'Bert', 'kid']",The Green

1463715,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B005KBP07W,Robert Amsel,"[22, 31]","The movie deals with an openly gay high school teacher and his partner, living together in suburban New England. Suddenly, the teacher is accused of molesting one of his most promising students, and homophobia throughout the town takes off like a rocket.I really wanted to like this movie. I liked the directing. I like the acting. BUT there are several things in the film that are just so wrong I could not suspend my disbelief to the extent required. First of all, try falling about 15 feet off a porch roof and landing on your side and back. Then see if you can immediately jump up and sprint a few miles full-steam ahead in an attempt to catch a younger person who's running from you. You'll be lucky if you can stand up at all... or even walk. (Something similar happened to me, and I ultimately required hip replacement surgery.)Secondly, the molestation charge against the high school teacher becomes complicated when an earlier arrest in New York City resurfaces, adding fuel to the fire. Supposedly, the teacher was the victim of police entrapment in a public men's room near Washington Park in 1998. Here's the problem: in New York City, police entrapment in men's rooms ended in the 1970s under Mayor John Lindsay due to courts being clogged up with fabricated charges from a corrupt vice squad. Mayor Lindsay put a stop to this entrapment so that only a private citizen, not a cop, could lodge a complaint against another private citizen. (Had the writer chosen some place other than N.Y.C., he might have been able to get away with it.)Finally, there's the issue of why the student would allow his favorite teacher to take the rap but keep quiet regarding actual abuse that's been taking place. Also, the entire police investigation is murky and incredible. The teacher is even arrested before any statement is volunteered by the student involved in the alleged molestation. In real life, this just would not happen.Still, even with its flaws I would like to see more of the talented director, Steven Williford, and actors Jason Butler Harner, Cheyenne Jackson, Julia Ormond, and Ileana Douglas, but in something better... or, at least, better thought out.",2,Well meaning script but with serious problems,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,2169,"['movie', 'deals', 'openly', 'gay', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'partner', 'living', 'together', 'suburban', 'New', 'England', 'Suddenly', 'teacher', 'accused', 'molesting', 'one', 'most', 'promising', 'students', 'homophobia', 'town', 'rocket.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'liked', 'directing', 'acting', 'are', 'several', 'things', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'wrong', 'could', 'not', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'extent', 'required', 'First', 'try', 'falling', '15', 'feet', 'porch', 'roof', 'landing', 'side', 'back', 'Then', 'see', 'can', 'immediately', 'jump', 'up', 'sprint', 'few', 'miles', 'full-steam', 'ahead', 'attempt', 'catch', 'younger', 'person', 'who', 'running', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lucky', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'even', 'walk', 'Something', 'similar', 'happened', 'ultimately', 'required', 'hip', 'replacement', 'surgery', 'Secondly', 'molestation', 'charge', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'becomes', 'complicated', 'when', 'earlier', 'arrest', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'resurfaces', 'adding', 'fuel', 'fire', 'Supposedly', 'teacher', 'was', 'victim', 'police', 'entrapment', 'public', 'men', 'room', 'Washington', 'Park', '1998', 'Here', 'problem', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'police', 'entrapment', 'men', 'rooms', 'ended', '1970s', 'Mayor', 'John', 'Lindsay', 'due', 'courts', 'being', 'clogged', 'up', 'fabricated', 'charges', 'corrupt', 'vice', 'squad', 'Mayor', 'Lindsay', 'put', 'stop', 'entrapment', 'so', 'only', 'private', 'citizen', 'not', 'cop', 'could', 'lodge', 'complaint', 'private', 'citizen', 'Had', 'writer', 'chosen', 'place', 'other', 'N.Y.C.', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'Finally', 'issue', 'why', 'student', 'would', 'allow', 'favorite', 'teacher', 'take', 'rap', 'keep', 'quiet', 'regarding', 'actual', 'abuse', 'been', 'taking', 'place', 'Also', 'entire', 'police', 'investigation', 'murky', 'incredible', 'teacher', 'even', 'arrested', 'statement', 'volunteered', 'student', 'involved', 'alleged', 'molestation', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'happen.Still', 'even', 'flaws', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'talented', 'director', 'Steven', 'Williford', 'actors', 'Jason', 'Butler', 'Harner', 'Cheyenne', 'Jackson', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Ileana', 'Douglas', 'something', 'better', 'least', 'better', 'thought', 'out']",The Green

It realistically portrays the untold damage and suffering such an accusation brings to the innocent teacher and those around him.As an educator myself, I am fully cognizant of the perilously fine line that all compassionate teachers--especially male teachers--must be constantly aware of:  a line that separates acceptable, nurturing practices--care, support and affection--from inappropriate conduct.  It is a delicate balancing act that can lead to disaster for the instructor who crosses, or seems to cross, the line.There are many things about this movie I like.  The performances are uniformly fine.  With one major exception, the characters are likeable enough, neither saints nor sinners, but simply humans, with all the strengths and weaknesses that word implies.  The gay angle, while central to the story, is never overplayed.  It never degenerates into an us versus them story.  I particularly like the ending.  Rather than giving us a nice pat conclusion with all the loose ends neatly tied up and all the conflicts satisfactorily resolved, we are left with uncertainty.  Does the protagonist take up teaching again?  Does he repair the damaged relationship with his partner?  Does he return to the city he fled or does he remain where he thought he had found the green he was seeking?  It is a fine ending, because that is what life is like.

Harner and Jackson both turn in nuanced, nicely crafted portrayals of grown-up men in an adult relationship. These fellows are the East Coast preppy equivalent of Julianne Moore and Annette Benning as the same-sex couple leading the California good life in ""The Kids Are All Right:"" attractive, educated, tasteful house, nice cars--only the guys have a dog instead of children. Most all the performances in the film are v. good.  As the  private prep school teacher ensnared in a contemporary version of that perennially favorite New England pastime, a ritual witch hunt (the principle motif here, clearly announced in another context by one of his brighter students in an early classroom scene as grimly indicative of humans' true nature), Jason Butler Harner bears an eery resemblance to Willem Dafoe's kid brother. A surfeit of tight shots on his attractive mug reveals that Cheyenne Jackson makes extensive use of shaping his ample lips to create his character.The disappointing part is that given the actors' apparent desire to create credible queer characters, this is the least problematic script they could find in which to invest their considerable talents. The bad guy's part is so crudely sketched, and Bill Sage, the actor playing him, given so little opportunity to improve matters, it very nearly sinks the whole picture.  Then I happened to catch a few minutes of Sage doing identical mannerisms in a Law and Order episode on the tube and recognized that here was another example of a director relying on an actor's TV persona to do the water carrying.  Sorry. Doesn't work for people who don't watch much television. Too bad. In the hands of a better writer and/or more skilled director, this might have been a seriously good picture. (Well . . . that, and there remains that generous measure of self-righteous pomposity.)The GOOD part is that this is a real movie, as opposed to all the brain-dead gaysploitation flix, many having rightfully languished for decades without distribution, that have in the last year started abundantly proliferating like mold on stale sliced bread both here and on Netflix. It's worth noting that despite my quibbles about a weak script, The Green is so head and shoulders above that puerile drivel as to inhabit a different film universe entirely.
