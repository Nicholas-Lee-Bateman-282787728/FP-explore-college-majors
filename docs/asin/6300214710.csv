Nothing overt, but I do touch on the ending indirectly.]Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie:Q. Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him?A. So that the audience can identify with her, even though it turns out they're best friends.Q. Why does Ringwald's best friend disappear halfway through the movie?A. Because the actress died.  But that's no reason to keep the scenes she shot, with no explanation of the character's disappearance, and then scribble new material for Annie Potts' record shop supervisor as the new best friend in the second half of the movie.Q. Why does Spader look like he belongs in college, not high school?A. Because he was clearly too old for the part, although he was otherwise perfect.Q. Speaking of Spader, why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him?A. Plot point Hughes thought he had to have, but it's actually unnecessary.Q. Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald's perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful?A. Because audiences would presumably be repulsed by genuine poverty.  (It's also a mystery why she's so ashamed of it if she rejects the values of her snobby classmates so vehemently.)Q. Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie?A. Because the writer of the novelization knew what the only real logical ending was.  Hughes mistook gloss over substance again, as he did in &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; where Ally Sheedy's transformation from quirky indivualist to Barbie doll was supposed to be a good thing.Q. Why, if the characters' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true, does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun?A. Because cheap, easy laughs are excused by audiences raised on sitcoms and music videos.Q. Why, if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can?A. Don't ask me.Q. Why is the father played by Stanton such a weakling?A. It's required in any movie from the late 70s on where a child or teenager is the protagonist.  Has there been a parental figure in movies in the last 25 years as charming and authoritative as Ferris Bueller?Q. Why would anyone hire an actor whose idea of emoting is to press his lips together and bulge his eyes out?A. Ask Andrew McCarthy's agent.Can I recommend anything about this movie?  Yes.  Cryer is genuinely appealing in his best role.  The soundtrack still kicks.  And the climax (moments before the ending itself falls apart, when you think the right thing is about to happen, before it doesn't) is genuinely touching, because Duckie deserves happiness and Andy deserves Duckie.",2,Q&amp;A,978566400,"01 4, 2001",2001,2737,"['[', 'Spoiler', 'alert', 'Nothing', 'overt', 'do', 'touch', 'ending', 'indirectly', ']', 'Burning', 'questions', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'movie', 'Q', 'Why', 'Ringwald', 'appear', 'repulsed', 'Cryer', 'first', 'time', 'audience', 'can', 'identify', 'even', 'out', ""'re"", 'best', 'friends.Q', 'Why', 'Ringwald', 'best', 'friend', 'disappear', 'halfway', 'movie', 'actress', 'died', 'reason', 'keep', 'scenes', 'shot', 'explanation', 'character', 'disappearance', 'then', 'scribble', 'new', 'material', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'record', 'shop', 'supervisor', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'second', 'half', 'movie.Q', 'Why', 'Spader', 'look', 'college', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'was', 'clearly', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'was', 'otherwise', 'perfect.Q', 'Speaking', 'Spader', 'why', 'been', 'chasing', 'Ringwald', 'years', 'nothing', 'people', 'social', 'status', 'appeals', 'Plot', 'point', 'Hughes', 'thought', 'had', 'have', 'actually', 'unnecessary.Q', 'Why', 'are', 'supposed', 'think', 'Ringwald', 'perfectly', 'decent', 'house', 'trashy', 'shameful', 'audiences', 'would', 'presumably', 'be', 'repulsed', 'genuine', 'poverty', 'also', 'mystery', 'why', 'so', 'ashamed', 'values', 'snobby', 'classmates', 'so', 'vehemently.', 'Q', 'Why', 'novelization', 'Duckie', 'get', 'leading', 'lady', 'not', 'movie', 'writer', 'novelization', 'knew', 'what', 'only', 'real', 'logical', 'ending', 'was', 'Hughes', 'mistook', 'gloss', 'substance', 'again', 'did', 'quot', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'quot', 'where', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'transformation', 'quirky', 'indivualist', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'thing.Q', 'Why', 'characters', 'emotions', 'actions', 'are', 'supposed', 'ring', 'true', 'Potts', 'almost', 'customer', 'staple', 'gun', 'cheap', 'easy', 'laughs', 'are', 'excused', 'audiences', 'raised', 'sitcoms', 'music', 'videos.Q', 'Why', 'Cryer', 'Ringwald', 'are', 'same', 'grade', 'therefore', 'presumably', 'same', 'age', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'same', 'can', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'me.Q', 'Why', 'father', 'played', 'Stanton', 'weakling', 'required', 'movie', 'late', '70s', 'where', 'child', 'teenager', 'protagonist', 'Has', 'there', 'been', 'parental', 'figure', 'movies', 'last', '25', 'years', 'charming', 'authoritative', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Q', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'hire', 'actor', 'idea', 'emoting', 'press', 'lips', 'together', 'bulge', 'eyes', 'out', 'Ask', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'agent.Can', 'recommend', 'anything', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Cryer', 'genuinely', 'appealing', 'best', 'role', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'climax', 'moments', 'ending', 'falls', 'apart', 'when', 'think', 'right', 'thing', 'happen', ""n't"", 'genuinely', 'touching', 'Duckie', 'happiness', 'Andy', 'Duckie']",Pretty in Pink VHS

That said, the film is so generically 80's that it was almost like a breath of fresh air.  I relished in the dated quality of the film because it made it feel new and different.  Sadly, Ringwald is dull as a doornail and she really drags this film down a couple pegs.  I just couldn't invest in her because she bored me to tears.  Thankfully the rich supporting cast brought the film up, with Jon Cryer, James Spader and Annie Potts nailing their roles and grabbing our attention.  Cryer's take on `Try a Little Tenderness' was the film's biggest highlight, and Spader's perfected soullessness is fun to watch.  I felt like the script was really skeletal in parts, almost laughably so.  When Andie has this heart to heart with her dad about her mother leaving them, it felt so underwritten it was pathetic.  Still, the predictability factor doesn't hinder the smile on my face, it was the boring leads that did that.  It's funny to see what Cryer has become.  Ah, 80's nostalgia.

214979,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6300214710,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","Continuing on with my 80's movies reviews I started a month or so ago with ""Can't Buy Me Love"", comes this classic John Hughes/Molly Ringwald film from 1986, and directed by Howard Deutch. PIP comes at a time when Hughes'teen/high school work of the 80's would soon be coming, sadly, to an end. While there are a few other works of his in this vein that I prefer(Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club), that isn't to say PIP isn't worthy of being part of the best of the group. It is. It definitley is. And now, we get the ultimate DVD version of the film. There have been others on the market, but the ""Everything Dcukie"" edition is the one stop shopping for your Pretty In Pink needs. Let's move on....Perennial Hughes favorite Molly Ringwald, plays high school senior Andi Walsh, an intelligent girl with her own distinct style of clothing and way of life. She is not 'popular' at school and comes from the wrong side of the tracks, where she lives with her father(Harry Dean Stanton). She has her best friend Duckie(Jon Cryer, ""Two And A Half Men""), who loves her, a job at a cool record store(before CD's kids!), and a friend, Iona, who runs the place(played by the wonderful Annie Potts). Andi's life soon changes when rich and popular Blane(Andrew McCarthy)takes a shining to her, amidst the ridicule from his popular, cool friends, among them the loathsome Steff(James Spader). What is a girl to do?.For starters, this is a great cast. With Ringwald and McCarthy, you get some familiar faces that are not new to the teen/school genre, and many argue that this is the best film for each. Elsewhere, there is James Spader, who does a credible job as the despicable Steff. Even though Steff is the typical 80's/rich/super cool/mr. popular/slimeball, Spader really deserves some credit for not only bringing all of that to cinematic life, but for making it believeable. He is slime, and there is not one moment he is on screen that you don't feel it. He did a great job. Annie Potts is wonderful and adorable in her role, and she brightens the preceedings whenever she is on screen. Her and Andi have a great relationship as friends, and even though she is a bit older, there might be a 'mother-ly' connection Andi finds in her as well. Speaking of the parental unit, there is Harry Dean Stanton. He does a fine job, but is it me or does it seem just kinda weird to see him playing the warm dad in a teen friendly 80's comedy/drama?. No matter, he is still exceptional here. And, oh yes, this brings us to the character that Jon Cryer will forever be addressed as even when he is in his 80's. The one and only Duckie. Cryer has done some great comedic work on his sitcom, but Duckie is his best work. He's a great character, and Cryer really makes him come across as real and loveable, even when the character does and says some not so loveable things. Cryer is wonderful, and his dance in the record shop is classic. A great cast.But how is the rest of the movie?. Just as fun and enjoyable as it's wonderful cast!. The premise of the film may not be anything new, but hey, anything is good 10 times over if it is done well, with the right characters, the right writing, and the right actors to pull it off. PIP was lucky with John Hughes penning the script, so it's going to be better than an average 80's teen flick, and the characters were real and relatable. The movie really captures that feel and essence of certain hierarchy at high schools, the lesser individuals below them, and how they intertwine with each other and get along...or, not get along, as the case may be. The film and it's script ring very truthful in that area, and even though there may be some characters you expect to see in a movie such as this, the characters don't seem like cardboard rip-offs, but their own individual selves. The movie may have some romance and drama, but it also has a nice balance of humor, mostly from Duckie or at his expense, that feels natural. In fact, most of the movie feels natural, even though there will be some who will still question rich guy Blane's interest in Andi. As for how it all turns out, well, it could of gone either way. John Hughes wanted one thing, the director and producers wanted and expected the audience to want another thing. I liked the way the movie ended(even if Hughes didn't), but I will not spoil it for you if you have not seen it yet.The ""Everything Duckie"" edition has, well, everything you could want. Where to start?. There is a great selection of bonus material here, and you get over 90 minutes worth!. For starters, there is ""The First Time: The Making Of Pretty In Pink"", which is a nicely done documentary that is pretty self explanatory. A featurette on Ringwald called ""Prom Queen: All About Molly"". ""Volcanic Ensembles"" is a piece on, you guessed it, the wild fashion that is on showcase in the film. So very 80's, and that's why it's so cool. People tell their own stories of that special night in every senior's life with ""Prom Stories"". More goodies to come!. ""Favorite Scenes"" has cast and crew commenting on, well, their favorite scenes. You also get the original ending titled ""The Last Dance"". If that's not enough, there is also a featurette titled ""Zoids And Riches"", ""Wrap up: The Epilogue"", a photo gallery, and a commentary with director Howard Deutch. Surprisingly, since everything else is on here, there is no trailer for the film.""Pretty In Pink"" comes from that special, magical time known as the 80's. Before Miley, Jonas, and Britney, there was Ringwald, McCarthy, and Duckie. ""Pretty In Pink"" is a classic piece of 1980's John Hughes/teen comedy goodness. It holds a place alongside some of the more revered films of his and the times, but deserves a place nonetheless. It was nicely written, well acted, and deliverd an enjoyable viewing experience. All that and a truck load of special features?. How can it fail?!. It can't.

Her mother walked out on her and her father three years ago, so Andie has decided to change her role from being a daughter to a substitute wife. Her dad is a loser who's too lazy to get a job and every morning Andie wakes him, serves him breakfast, and nags about him having to find a job. Anyway, she has this screwed up friend name ""Ducky"" who is more annoying than funny and is in love with Andie. But Andie is in love with this rich guy at school named Blayne who isn't even hot.

214992,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6300214710,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[4, 6]","Molly Ringwald is pretty in pink, though she is gorgeous no matter what shade she wears. Andie Walsh in PIP is Molly's signature role. You'd think that a film titled Pretty in Pink would be all about the clothes, but apart from the pink prom dress she put together by combining two vintage dresses, I preferred her wardrobe from 16 Candles or The Breakfast Club. Besides, she was out dressed at every turn by Duckie (Jon Cryer) and Iona (Annie Potts).Duckie is her blatant admirer who rides by her house about 100 times a day on his bike. Does he ever park? No, he is more of a drive-by kind of guy. He appreciates her sense of fashion, because his own is even quirkier. They both like to work those hats.--------------------------Duckie: May I admire you again today?=============================================They have a close friendship, though it is obvious that Duckie wants more. ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" by The Smiths, and heard on the soundtrack, could serve as his anthem. Jon Cryer was a fabulous Duckie with all his ducks in a row. This is his best role, and the one he will be remembered for, apart from playing Alan Harper in the syndicated sit com Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen. He was such a cute kid. What happened?---------------------------Andie: So what do you want to drink?Duckie: Oh you know, beer, scotch, juice box... whatever.============================================Cryer had another great sit com but no one saw it, a great show about two architects called Partners that only lasted one season. Cryer was Bob (22 episodes, 1995-1996). Does anyone besides me remember this show?Besides out dressing Ringwald -- his tuxedo even trumps her pink dress at the prom -- Cryer and Potts almost steal the show with their romance. They nearly hijacked PIP and made it into the sequel to HAM (Harold and Maude).--------------------Duckie: You know what an older woman does for me?Iona: Changes your diapers?Duckie: Touch&eacute;.==============================Iona keeps Duckie at bay with her wisecracks, but after Duckie kisses Iona to make Andie jealous, Duckie and Iona almost hook up. This train derails when she starts dating a yuppie pet shop owner who arrives suddenly like some kind of deus ex machina.Annie Potts as Iona was the coolest vintage record store owner in Chicago since Rob Gordon in High Fidelity. She is a perpetual adolescent and surrogate mother/cool boss to Andie Walsh, always there for her with a quick quip or a shoulder to cry on. She is the perfect mixture of mother and best friend for a post-date recap:---------------------------------Andie: Well, not nothing. I mean, I kissed him...Iona: Anywhere interesting?===========================================Her unique fashion sense is all the stranger coming from someone who would play Interior Decorator Mary Jo Shively in 151 episodes of ""Designing Women"" from 1986-1993. Iona lives in a Chinese Restaurant converted into her humble abode with a lot of the original decor intact. Besides her outrageous clothes, she also has a passion for wigs that borders on the criminal. Indeed, she was in Ken Russell's Crimes of Passion, and one of her wigs looks like it was stolen from China Blue.Harry Dean Stanton was good as Andie's father, who is still not over Andie's mother leaving. Andie has to push him to get out of bed in the morning and look for a better job. She has taken over the parent role, in a way, and dishes out the tough love. Still, they have great rapport. Repo Man and Paris, Texas are the must-see Harry Dean Stanton roles.Andrew McCarthy was OK but not great as Blane, the richie who faced a lot of pressure when he tried to date a poorie. The issue was would he go against the grain and date Andie in spite of parental and peer pressure, but what did Andie see in Blane, anyway?-------------------Andie: You know you're talking like that just because I'm going out with Blane.Duckie: His name is Blane? Oh! That's a major appliance, that's not a name!=========================================I don't know about a major appliance, but Blane is kind of a tool. McCarthy and Ringwald were also together in Fresh Horses, where Molly is even poorer, and Ben Stiller is the rich friend who tries to steer him away from Ringwald. Fresh Horses focuses much more on McCarthy, with Ringwald's Jewell being a mysterious figure that may or may not be married. Is she a real Jewell or merely costume jewelry? In Fresh Horses, the gap between the two is much wider, and harder for McCarthy's character to bridge. He is studying to be an architect, but she is a backwoods yahoo. Even the test audiences felt that they shouldn't get together.James Spader was good in PIP as the rich jerk, Steff. Spader has a similar role to the one he played in PIP in The Rachel Papers, were he plays the rival for Ione Skye's affections. He makes a good jerk, but would later branch out to more sympathetic and complex roles, like the naive innocent under the Bad Influence of Rob Lowe. His break out role would have to be sex, lies, and video tape.John Hughes wrote Pretty in Pink but didn't direct it. Don't fall for that trick trivia question. Howard Deutch was the director, and it was Deutch's directorial debut. Since PIP is practically a sequel to 16 Candles it is fitting that Deutch would go on to direct three sequels for which he hadn't directed the original films (Grumpier Old Men, The Odd Couple II, & The Whole Ten Yards).The audience at the test screening didn't buy Duckie and Andie getting together at the end, so the studio made them change it. They had to call back the actors to reshoot, even though McCarthy had shaved his head for his next film. He had to wear one of Iona's wigs. Hughes wanted to keep his original ending, and later made Some Kind of Wonderful (1987), almost a remake of PIP, just so he could do the ending he wanted. Hughes wanted Ringwald to do SKOW, but she wisely refused to reprise her role yet again, resulting in a falling out and they never worked together afterwards.If Robert Downey Jr. had been cast as Duckie, it might have ended with Andie and Duckie getting together, because Downey, unlike Cryer, didn't give Molly a brotherly vibe. Downey Jr. is the only one I can think of who could have escaped the friend bag Duckie was stuck in. Anthony Michael Hall couldn't get out of his friend bag in 16 Candles, and he was offered the role of Duckie but wisely turned it down. Dweezil Zappa, who played Simon in PIP, was actually Molly's boyfriend at the time. Would the test audience have bought them as a couple?Besides Dweezil, keep your eye out for Gina Gershon and Andrew 'Dice' Clay. Clay is the bouncer at Trax, the night club where the PIP crew hang. If you are ever asked who the bouncer in Flashdance was, it wasn't the dice man, but Lee Ving, the singer of So Cal punk group Fear. I could have sworn it was Andrew.New Order, Echo & the Bunnymen, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, INXS, along with the title track by The Psychedelic Furs gave this film the quintessential 80's vibe, but it also used older songs like ""Copacabana (At the Copa)"" by Barry Manilow, ""Try a Little Tenderness"" by Otis Redding, and ""Cherish"" by The Association to its advantage.Pretty in Pink is a classic High School romance, and it also owns the 80's. Pretty in Pink is to the 80's what Reality Bites is to the 90's. It is a high point of the Hughes oeuvre, even if he didn't direct, but merely wrote it. I think the ending is fine, even if Hughes didn't. Besides Molly Ringwald being so pretty in pink, you also have Cryer and Potts. Who could ask for more?Crash(1996) ....

Who is taking whom, what will they wear, who loves whom, and who is whose true friend. This is about a group of teenagers, specifically one girl and her attempts to cop off with a rich boy. The insight into the American 'class system' will enlighten British viewers as there are closer comparisons with our own class system than might at first be obvious, although the American system seems to be based on money rather than anything else. Having said that, the 'can love exist between people from such different backgrounds' plot was hackneyed after Shakespeare did it with Romeo And Juliet, so by the time we get to 1984 we don't really care whether she gets him or the other guy. This is entertaining, yet examines the relationships of young-adulthood with a subtle intelligence.

""Pretty in Pink"" is a throwback to a whole other mindset that we have definitely lost nearly twenty years later.  What is it that we have lost?  In my opinion, in the films of today, we have lost a sense of innocence, we are no longer upbeat and it seems to me that many of the films pandered to teenagers and young twentysomethings are filled to the brim with cynicism and leave a sour taste in your mouth, once you have left the movie theatre.  I find myself saying, ""Did I really pay $7.50 for this?!""What makes ""Pretty in Pink"" so good is the great cast.  This is truly Molly Ringwald at her finest, cast as a high school senior from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" who is pursuing a romance with a classmate with seemingly all of the breaks (Andrew McCarthy).  Her best friend, ""Ducky,"" is masterfully played by Jon Cryer.  Ducky, of course, is interested in her on more than just a friend level, and feels threatened when this new guy with money and popularity comes around to woo his best friend.  Ducky has a combination of unusual fashion sense (where did he get those shoes?!), he's got that wonderful combination of gawky teenage vulnerability and stand-up comedy timing to match.  The strong cast, along with a great 80s soundtrack that will take you back, great direction and a great plot that challenges us to think about whether your class standing truly determines who you can love in the end makes the film both entertaining and intelligent.  This film should be a pre-requisite for young filmmakers and 1980s film buffs alike.",5,this makes me wish it was 1986 all over again!...,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,1600,"['.even', 'was', 'only', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'throwback', 'whole', 'other', 'mindset', 'have', 'definitely', 'lost', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'What', 'have', 'lost', 'opinion', 'films', 'today', 'have', 'lost', 'sense', 'innocence', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'upbeat', 'many', 'films', 'pandered', 'teenagers', 'young', 'twentysomethings', 'are', 'filled', 'brim', 'cynicism', 'leave', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'once', 'have', 'left', 'movie', 'theatre', 'find', 'saying', 'Did', 'really', 'pay', '7.50', 'What', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'so', 'good', 'great', 'cast', 'truly', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'finest', 'cast', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'pursuing', 'romance', 'classmate', 'seemingly', 'breaks', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'best', 'friend', 'Ducky', 'masterfully', 'played', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'Ducky', 'course', 'interested', 'more', 'just', 'friend', 'level', 'feels', 'threatened', 'when', 'new', 'guy', 'money', 'popularity', 'around', 'woo', 'best', 'friend', 'Ducky', 'combination', 'unusual', 'fashion', 'sense', 'where', 'did', 'get', 'shoes', 'got', 'wonderful', 'combination', 'gawky', 'teenage', 'vulnerability', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'timing', 'match', 'strong', 'cast', 'great', '80s', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'take', 'back', 'great', 'direction', 'great', 'plot', 'think', 'class', 'standing', 'truly', 'determines', 'who', 'can', 'love', 'end', 'film', 'entertaining', 'intelligent', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'pre-requisite', 'young', 'filmmakers', '1980s', 'film', 'buffs', 'alike']",Pretty in Pink VHS

215020,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,6300214710,Erica Anderson,"[5, 5]","John Hughes pretty much owns the '80s. His films to me are absolutely timeless. He had a real eye for teenagers and their high school experiences were like back in the Reagan era. ""Pretty in Pink"" definitely ranks as another classic from John Hughes. Once again we see Molly Ringwald as the protagonist Andie Walsh, the social outcast in her high school. Her best friends consists of Duckie (played by Jon Cryer) and Iona (Annie Potts). Andie lives with her father Jack Walsh (Harry Dean Stanton) who is an unemployed alcoholic. Like I said before, Andie is an outcast in her school. She dresses a lot differently from her classmates (as does Duckie). One day, Andie gets asked to the school dance by a rich classmate Blane (Andrew McCarthy) which does not sit well with Duckie who is secretly in love with Andie. Andie and Blane comes from two different worlds, Andie is from the wrong side of the tracks while Blane was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. The class issue becomes an issue when Blane's best friend who is played by the brilliant James Spader makes an issue out of it, with the intentions of driving a wedge between Andie and Blane. The '80s music fit perfectly with the film. James Spader and Jon Cryer really stole the show here. I especially loved James Spader's smarminess as he tries to sabotage the budding relationship between Andie and Blane. James really has a lot of screen presence and his performance in ""Pretty in Pink"" was a sure sign to tell for his future Emmy winning performance as Alan Shore on ""The Practice"".",5,Another classic John Hughes film,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,1549,"['John', 'Hughes', 'pretty', 'much', ""'80s"", 'films', 'are', 'absolutely', 'timeless', 'had', 'real', 'eye', 'teenagers', 'high', 'school', 'experiences', 'were', 'like', 'back', 'Reagan', 'era', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'definitely', 'classic', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Once', 'again', 'see', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'protagonist', 'Andie', 'Walsh', 'social', 'outcast', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friends', 'consists', 'Duckie', 'played', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'Iona', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'Andie', 'father', 'Jack', 'Walsh', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'who', 'unemployed', 'alcoholic', 'said', 'Andie', 'outcast', 'school', 'lot', 'differently', 'classmates', 'Duckie', 'One', 'day', 'Andie', 'asked', 'school', 'dance', 'rich', 'classmate', 'Blane', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'Duckie', 'who', 'secretly', 'love', 'Andie', 'Andie', 'Blane', 'two', 'different', 'worlds', 'Andie', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'Blane', 'was', 'born', 'silver', 'spoon', 'mouth', 'class', 'issue', 'issue', 'when', 'Blane', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'played', 'brilliant', 'James', 'Spader', 'issue', 'intentions', 'driving', 'wedge', 'Andie', 'Blane', ""'80s"", 'music', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'film', 'James', 'Spader', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'really', 'stole', 'show', 'here', 'especially', 'loved', 'James', 'Spader', 'smarminess', 'sabotage', 'budding', 'relationship', 'Andie', 'Blane', 'James', 'really', 'lot', 'screen', 'presence', 'performance', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'was', 'sure', 'sign', 'tell', 'future', 'Emmy', 'winning', 'performance', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'Practice']",Pretty in Pink VHS

You could not be an American teenager in the 80s without seeing these films. Pretty in Pink, though, was not the best of them. In fact the stars of the film were growing a little long in the tooth and this story was a little far fetched to be believable. Molly Ringwald plays a poor girl who lives on the ""wrong side of the tracks"". Her hobby is to design clothes and make them herself. Needless to say this makes her a bit of an outcast although she has her own sense of style. Her best friends are a dorky guy named Duckie (Jon Cryer) and a thrift shop owner (Annie Potts). By most standards, Ringwald's old car, her retro clothes and her overall ""way"" would be considered cool, but at her school she is an unknown freak. One day, however, magically, a very rich and very popular Blain (Andrew McCarthy) notices her and starts to pursue her. Naturally his friends make fun of him (particularly a very slimy James Spader) but he tries to ignore them. Eventually though he starts thinking of his reputation more than of her. She is heartbroken, but by the end of the film, at the prom, they hook back up again. And the rest is history. Of all the John Hughes pictures, this is the one you should not bother with unless you happen to want a marathon. There is almost nothing funny or poignant or even nostalgic about this film. Stick with 16 Candles and the Breakfast Club. (The Psychedelic Furs' song &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, used inappropriately here, is featured, and is probably the best thing about this movie).",2,CLASSES DON'T MIX,985564800,"03 26, 2001",2001,1606,"['came', 'tail', 'end', 'long', 'string', 'John', 'Hughes', 'teenager', 'movies', '1980s', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'American', 'teenager', '80s', 'seeing', 'films', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'though', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'fact', 'stars', 'film', 'were', 'growing', 'little', 'long', 'tooth', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'far', 'fetched', 'be', 'believable', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'hobby', 'design', 'clothes', 'make', 'Needless', 'say', 'bit', 'outcast', 'own', 'sense', 'style', 'best', 'friends', 'are', 'dorky', 'guy', 'named', 'Duckie', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'thrift', 'shop', 'owner', 'Annie', 'Potts', 'most', 'standards', 'Ringwald', 'old', 'car', 'retro', 'clothes', 'overall', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'cool', 'school', 'unknown', 'freak', 'One', 'day', 'however', 'magically', 'very', 'rich', 'very', 'popular', 'Blain', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'pursue', 'Naturally', 'friends', 'make', 'fun', 'particularly', 'very', 'slimy', 'James', 'Spader', 'ignore', 'Eventually', 'thinking', 'reputation', 'more', 'heartbroken', 'end', 'film', 'prom', 'hook', 'back', 'up', 'again', 'rest', 'history', 'John', 'Hughes', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'bother', 'happen', 'want', 'marathon', 'almost', 'nothing', 'funny', 'poignant', 'even', 'nostalgic', 'film', 'Stick', '16', 'Candles', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Psychedelic', 'Furs', 'song', 'quot', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'quot', 'used', 'inappropriately', 'here', 'featured', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'movie']",Pretty in Pink VHS

I liked the characters a great deal, and thought the cast was superb.  It's hard for me to pick out my favorite performance in this ensemble cast -- they all work so well together, and some of the supporting roles are better than the two headliners, Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy.  The other main character, Jon Cryer as the doormat boyfriend-wannabe Duckie, is charming, funny, and for me, a total heart-melter.Andi (Molly Ringwald) falls for Blaine (""That's not a name, that's a major appliance,"" says Duckie in one of many memorable one-liners), played charmingly by Andrew McCarthy.  It's the classic tale of the rich guy/girl and poor guy/girl falling in love and finding more obstacles against their relationship than they could have even imagined.  Nothing new here, but again, the performances, the music, the great 80's fashions, and the catchy dialogue make it far more interesting than it could have been.James Spader is deliciously detestable as McCarthy's best rich pal/enemy (how could Blaine not have seen what was driving his venom?), Harry Dean Stanton gives nuance as Andi's hopelessly heartbroken father, and Annie Potts just about steals the show as Andi's pretty older co-worker, wisecracking friend.  I was enjoying the movie shamelessly, then was so disappointed in the predictably easy, feel-good ending.  The writers, producers, and director all took the easy way out, and who can blame them?  They are in it to make money, not art.  It would have been better as a thoughtful indie movie with a more realistic ending, but then they probably couldn't have gotten all those A-list brat pack actors.

She's a self-confident high-school senior who dresses in handmade clothes, works in a record store, and lives in a modest home with her unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton). Times are tough for Andie in school, where she and her friends are tormented by the wealthy students who make up the majority of the student body, and where her worst fear is that she won't get invited to the senior prom. Her best friend, ""Duckie"" (Jon Cryer), talks matter-of-factly with her father about marrying Andie, but he never thinks of taking her to the prom--a social event that most of the poor kids avoid. To her surprise, she is asked to go to the dance by the charming Blaine (Andrew McCarthy), who's not as snobbish as the rest of his elitist friends.

I liked all the related John Hughes films that came out about this time with various collections of a larger group of actors called, at the time, the ""Brat Pack."" The story is a Cinderella/Romeo-n-Juliet-type theme set in the mid-80's where an unlikely romance is set up, then falters, then regains its strength at the end. Well, Romeo and Juliet died (Ooops! Sorry for the spoiler on that one!) and these characters didn't need to do that in order to be together, so I suppose this was a better ending.However, it's not as good as the ending that was originally intended. I'm with the crowd of critics who would have preferred the original ending, where Duckie and Andie hook up at the end, rather than Andie and Blaine. The alleged story behind the change of endings is that Molly Ringwald didn't like the original, realistic ending, insisting that teenage girls would prefer that Andie win her rich guy at last. If that's the case, she misread the demographic rather badly, and I'm annoyed that John Hughes would ignore his better sense and give in to a teenage girl's complaints.Andie's wardrobe I thought was a lot of fun. I'm curious about who really came up with her costumes; did Molly have any input? Another reviewer has criticized her wardrobe as looking like ""old women's clothing,"" and I think that's an understandable point of view to a modern-day viewer; she wore a lot of busy florals and frills and lace with granny boots. At the time, I saw it as being an off-shoot of the Madonna/Cyndi Lauper style: quirky and artistic compared to the standard ""preppie"" designer look that was the mainstream style then. OTOH, the prom dress Andie created at the end was an absolute nightmare; I don't know who came up with it, but compared to everything else Andie wore that she was supposed to have created, that horrible dress was completely ""out of character."" It was appalling and hideous. Whoever actually created it should have been shot. Or at least fired.Oddly, at the end, I found myself wanting a sequel; not one where Andie marries either Ducky or Blaine and lives happily-ever-after, but one where she goes to art/fashion-design school and becomes a talented and successful designer in New York or Paris or Milan. Or all 3. She would still have some significant hurdles to overcome -- students who don't have access to lots of money while attending a college or university of any kind generally do. I wanted to see someone else in my predicament (as it was then) struggle and sacrifice and work hard in order to realize their dreams.This was one of the movies where I first started to dislike the practice of using actors in their 20's to play characters in high school. James Spader is ultra-hot and sexy in this film and plays the snobbish, world-weary cynic, ""Steff,"" fabulously, but at NO POINT in the film does he EVER portray a believable 17-/18-yr-old boy. He looks and acts his real age: about 25. I'm never convinced at all that he's a realistic high school kid. Andrew McCarthy is worse. His face is actually showing signs of aging here, even as young as he was then, about 23. Jon Cryer at 21 was a little more believable as an 18-yr-old, and of course, Molly was a genuine 18-yr-old -- and LOOKED it. I understand that at least partly, the idea is to cast actors who look youthful but who are over 18 in order to avoid all the mandatory breaks and school time that are required for minor-age actors by law. OTOH, looking youthful doesn't necessarily mean looking young enough, and John Hughes had already worked around Molly Ringwald's and Anthony Michael Hall's ages in Sixteen Candles AND Breakfast Club without either film suffering for it, so why he would suddenly choose to cast a person who was a full 6 or 8 years older than his character is puzzling. (Judd Nelson also doesn't look 16/17 in Breakfast Club either, but that's another review.)Still, in spite of these missteps, the film is sweet and romantic for the mid-teen set.",4,Good Chick-flick for the mid-teen set WITH SPOILERS,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,4007,"['SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSI', 'liked', 'film', 'liked', 'related', 'John', 'Hughes', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'various', 'collections', 'larger', 'group', 'actors', 'called', 'time', 'Brat', 'Pack', 'story', 'Cinderella/Romeo-n-Juliet-type', 'theme', 'set', 'mid-80', 'where', 'unlikely', 'romance', 'set', 'up', 'then', 'falters', 'then', 'strength', 'end', 'Well', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'died', 'Ooops', 'Sorry', 'spoiler', 'one', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'order', 'be', 'together', 'suppose', 'was', 'better', 'ending.However', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', ""'m"", 'crowd', 'critics', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'original', 'ending', 'where', 'Duckie', 'Andie', 'hook', 'up', 'end', 'rather', 'Andie', 'Blaine', 'alleged', 'story', 'change', 'endings', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'did', ""n't"", 'original', 'realistic', 'ending', 'insisting', 'teenage', 'girls', 'would', 'prefer', 'Andie', 'win', 'rich', 'guy', 'last', 'case', 'misread', 'demographic', 'rather', 'badly', ""'m"", 'annoyed', 'John', 'Hughes', 'would', 'ignore', 'better', 'sense', 'give', 'teenage', 'girl', 'complaints.Andie', 'wardrobe', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', ""'m"", 'curious', 'who', 'really', 'came', 'up', 'costumes', 'did', 'Molly', 'have', 'input', 'reviewer', 'criticized', 'wardrobe', 'looking', 'old', 'women', 'clothing', 'think', 'understandable', 'point', 'view', 'modern-day', 'viewer', 'wore', 'lot', 'busy', 'florals', 'frills', 'lace', 'granny', 'boots', 'time', 'saw', 'being', 'off-shoot', 'Madonna/Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'style', 'quirky', 'artistic', 'compared', 'standard', 'preppie', 'designer', 'look', 'was', 'mainstream', 'style', 'then', 'OTOH', 'prom', 'dress', 'Andie', 'created', 'end', 'was', 'absolute', 'nightmare', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'compared', 'everything', 'else', 'Andie', 'wore', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'created', 'horrible', 'dress', 'was', 'completely', 'character', 'was', 'appalling', 'hideous', 'Whoever', 'actually', 'created', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'least', 'fired.Oddly', 'end', 'found', 'wanting', 'sequel', 'not', 'one', 'where', 'Andie', 'Ducky', 'Blaine', 'happily-ever-after', 'one', 'where', 'art/fashion-design', 'school', 'talented', 'successful', 'designer', 'New', 'York', 'Paris', 'Milan', '3', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'significant', 'hurdles', 'overcome', 'students', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'lots', 'money', 'attending', 'college', 'university', 'kind', 'generally', 'do', 'wanted', 'see', 'someone', 'else', 'predicament', 'was', 'then', 'struggle', 'sacrifice', 'work', 'hard', 'order', 'realize', 'dreams.This', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'first', 'started', 'dislike', 'practice', 'using', 'actors', '20', 'play', 'characters', 'high', 'school', 'James', 'Spader', 'ultra-hot', 'sexy', 'film', 'snobbish', 'world-weary', 'cynic', 'Steff', 'fabulously', 'NO', 'POINT', 'film', 'EVER', 'believable', '17-/18-yr-old', 'boy', 'real', 'age', 'about', '25', ""'m"", 'never', 'convinced', 'realistic', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'worse', 'face', 'actually', 'showing', 'signs', 'aging', 'here', 'even', 'as', 'young', 'was', 'then', 'about', '23', 'Jon', 'Cryer', '21', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'believable', '18-yr-old', 'course', 'Molly', 'was', 'genuine', '18-yr-old', 'LOOKED', 'understand', 'least', 'partly', 'idea', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'look', 'youthful', 'who', 'are', '18', 'order', 'avoid', 'mandatory', 'breaks', 'school', 'time', 'are', 'required', 'minor-age', 'actors', 'law', 'OTOH', 'looking', 'youthful', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'looking', 'young', 'enough', 'John', 'Hughes', 'had', 'already', 'worked', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'ages', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'AND', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'film', 'suffering', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'suddenly', 'choose', 'cast', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'full', '6', '8', 'years', 'older', 'character', 'puzzling', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'also', ""n't"", 'look', '16/17', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'review', 'Still', 'spite', 'missteps', 'film', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'mid-teen', 'set']",Pretty in Pink VHS

But, I just couldn't resist adding this to my Listmania list of ""my favorite movies""!!!I experienced my ""teen years"" during the mid 1980's, so of course I saw EVERY ONE of the Molly Ringwald movies when they came out - and I LOVED every single one!!!I often wonder what ever became of her - as she had quite a string of hit movies, and then just disappeared from the radar.  I honestly hope to see her again some day, as I always thought she was a really good actress...Anyway, ""Pretty in Pink"" is about a teenage girl living during the 1980's (you can tell by the ""great"" style of clothes) on the ""wrong side of the tracks"".  She lived with her father, who simply did not like to work, as her mother had left them some years earlier.She spends most of her time with her best friend ""Ducky"" - who's a really great guy, also from a ""working class"" family.  However, there are 2 REALLY rich, good looking guys who seem to be interested in her.  1 of them is a MAJOR jerk, and all he ever cares about is ""one thing"" (I'm sure you know what I mean), so she consistently turns him down - which makes him EXTREMELY ""pissed off"".  The 2nd guy seems to be a pretty nice guy, and she becomes enamored of him.Well, the ""nice guy"" finally asks her out & she says yes - only to be treated like trash by his friends.  But, they try to continue dating & he eventually asks her to the prom - & she says yes.Will he show up?  Will she be forced to go alone?  Who will she end up with - Ducky or the rich guy???  I don't want to ruin it for you in case you never saw the movie, but suffice it to say that you will ALWAYS remember the ending to this movie!!! (I don't know of anyone who doesn't, and many of them last saw it about 20 years ago!!!).I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage romance movies in general, or the Molly Ringwald gang in particular.  This is a great movie, and much of it will still make sense to today's teens.  In fact, if you grew up in the 80's, your kids might be around that age now, so you could watch it together - a family movie night...",5,Great Movie!!!,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,2302,"['have', 'just', 'pre-ordered', 'DVD', 'am', 'reviewing', 'contents', 'movie', 'saw', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'seen', '30', 'times', 'late', 'night', 't.v', 'then', ""'ll"", 'review', 'how', 'well', 'DVD', 'was', 'done', 'once', 'get', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'resist', 'adding', 'Listmania', 'list', 'favorite', 'movies', 'experienced', 'teen', 'years', 'mid', '1980', 'course', 'saw', 'EVERY', 'ONE', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'movies', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'LOVED', 'single', 'one', 'often', 'wonder', 'what', 'ever', 'became', 'had', 'quite', 'string', 'hit', 'movies', 'then', 'just', 'disappeared', 'radar', 'honestly', 'hope', 'see', 'again', 'day', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'actress', 'Anyway', 'Pretty', 'Pink', 'teenage', 'girl', 'living', '1980', 'can', 'tell', 'great', 'style', 'clothes', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'lived', 'father', 'who', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'mother', 'had', 'left', 'years', 'earlier.She', 'most', 'time', 'best', 'friend', 'Ducky', 'who', 'really', 'great', 'guy', 'also', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'However', 'are', '2', 'REALLY', 'rich', 'good', 'looking', 'guys', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'interested', '1', 'MAJOR', 'jerk', 'ever', 'one', 'thing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'consistently', 'down', 'EXTREMELY', 'pissed', 'off', '2nd', 'guy', 'be', 'pretty', 'nice', 'guy', 'enamored', 'him.Well', 'nice', 'guy', 'finally', 'out', 'yes', 'only', 'be', 'treated', 'trash', 'friends', 'try', 'continue', 'dating', 'eventually', 'prom', 'yes.Will', 'show', 'up', 'Will', 'be', 'forced', 'go', 'alone', 'Who', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'Ducky', 'rich', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'case', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'say', 'will', 'ALWAYS', 'remember', 'ending', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'many', 'last', 'saw', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'teenage', 'romance', 'movies', 'general', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'gang', 'particular', 'great', 'movie', 'much', 'will', 'still', 'make', 'sense', 'today', 'teens', 'fact', 'grew', 'up', '80', 'kids', 'might', 'be', 'age', 'now', 'could', 'watch', 'together', 'family', 'movie', 'night']",Pretty in Pink VHS

I really don't think I need to review the content of the movie- if you are reading this you have probably seen it!  I'm thrilled that Paramount has finally put this out on DVD.  But... and there is a BIG &quot;but&quot;....There are no extra goodies on this DVD.  The original ending (Molly Ringwald ends up with Duckie) is not here.  (Check it out: Andrew McCarthy looks COMPLETELY different in the last seen. His hair is longer, his skin is whiter, and he looks about 10 years older, even though the ending was filmed only several months after the principle shooting ended!)  That is a total missed opportunity that legions of Molly Ringwald/Brat Pack/John Hughes/80's teen flick fans have been waiting to see for years!  There's not even a theatrical trailer on this DVD!  I can understand that deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer- these things can get lost in the vaults over the years. But you simply cannot tell me that they couldn't dig up the video for OMD's &quot;If You Leave&quot; to put on here!Some commentary would have been great as well!  There are all sorts of things that the director could have discussed: OMD originally did a song for &quot;Pretty In Pink&quot; called &quot;Goddess Of Love&quot;.  When the ending of the movie changed, they recorded a new song (&quot;If You Leave&quot;)... &quot;Goddess Of Love&quot; ended up going on their &quot;Pacific Age&quot; album.  More trivia: Molly's favorite group at the time, The Rave-Up's, perform in the movie. (Their song wasn't on the soundtrack.)  Molly carries a notebook in &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; that has &quot;The Rave-Up's&quot; handwritten across it.Watch out for an early performance by Gina Gershon!  She barely has any lines- I think she's in about two scenes.  You won't miss those lips of hers.  Also look for Dweezil Zappa (as &quot;Simon&quot;).  Annie Potts practically steals the show in this pre-&quot;Designing Women&quot; performance.  Not to be missed!All in all... this is a great DVD. It's nice to see it letterboxed.

Great movie for a first date.Molly Ringwald, Guilty Pleasure, 1980's Suburbia""Pretty in Pink,"" along with ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"" are the three movies that made Molly Ringwald America's favorite prom date in the 1980's. Of the films associated with Ringwald (and the rest of the ""Brat Pack""), few are still enjoying any regular circulation now. What is sad is how most of the people who starred in these films and once enjoyed A-List status have fallen beneath the mainstream horizon. The interesting thing is the way these films portray an idealized, bittersweet suburban-princess ghetto that never existed but has become part of American mythology that still draws young people like moths to a flame. The films mentioned at the top of this review, along with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" could comprise a modern day ""golden age"" legend for exurban teens. ""Pretty in Pink"" was probably the most financially successful of Molly's follies (it wasn't the best or the funniest, that was ""Sixteen Candles"") and probably stands as a central monument for that last gasp of films that could unapologetically be about nothing at all and still make for good entertainment.

Whiny Molly Ringwald has by this time thoroughly worn out her welcome; her perpetual pout, her eye-rolling and her generally sour disposition are extremely grating, all the moreso because she is in virtually every scene!  The only interesting thing about Ringwald's ""performance"" is her ever-changing haircolor (throughout the movie, her hair goes from strawberry blonde to dark auburn to nearly chartreuse back to strawberry blonde, and so on.  At least SOMETHING changed; her expression never did!).Andrew McCarthy is the wimpiest ""romantic hero"" ever, and, like Molly, his expression never changes.  ""Must remain bland"" was surely his mantra throughout filming.Jon Cryer plays ""Ducky"" (did YOU go to high school with anybody who had a nickname like that???) like a spastic goofball.  James Spader is wasted in a one-note role as ""The Mean Snobby Guy.""  There's no end to the talent wasted in this film: Annie Potts and Harry Dean Stanton are also squandered in thankless, my-character-only-exists-to-showcase-Molly-Ringwald roles.As if all that's not annoying enough, Molly's character is the richest ""poor girl"" ever, with her own lilac-colored Kharman Ghia, an endless supply of funky vintage dresses, petticoats, sweaters, granny boots, and hats (if you think she picked all that swag up at Salvation Army, you're crazy), and her own phone complete with answering machine (no big deal now, but it was in the '80s).The cherry on top is the fact that the dress Molly cobbles together and ""triumphantly"" wears to Prom is ugly.  Ugly, ugly, UGLY.

""Pretty in Pink""  is part of John Hughes' oeuvre of '80s teen flicks, even though Hughes did not direct the film. Hughes wrote and produced; Howard Deutch makes his feature film debut directing. As was common with John Hughes films, the plot is simple and silly. The substance is supposed to be in the behavior. Unlike his other films, I think that Hughes achieved more with casting in ""Pretty and Pink"" than with dialogue or behavior, which accounts for its staying power. The film is a showcase of early work for a lot of big names.The plot is lifted straight out of Cinderella. Andie (Molly Ringwald) is a barely working class high school senior with a terminally unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton). She's responsible, ambitious, and doesn't let poverty stand between herself and a trendy wardrobe. She sews her own over-the-top '80s fashions. Andie's greatest wish is that dreamy rich boy Blane (Andrew McCarthy) will invite her to the prom, but the only rich boy who has paid her attention so far is Blane's rakish friend Steff (James Spader). Andie's eccentric friend since childhood, Duckie (Jon Cryer), pines after her, but seems destined to friend status.""Pretty and Pink"" doesn't resonate the way that many of John Hughes' teen movies did. I grew up poor and attended a rich high school, like Andie, but the way the characters interact in this movie doesn't ring true to me. It's a fairy tale. It's not a situation that people can relate to. The film's strength is its cast. Individually, the characters are appealing and interesting: Blane, the nice, handsome preppy. Steff, the licentious, handsome jerk. Annie Potts has a great role as Iona, Andie's colorful friend and employer. If the audience sympathizes with anyone, it is probably with Duckie, played to the hilt by Jon Cryer.Molly Ringwald was well-suited to most of her teen roles, but I'm not enthusiastic about her in this part. Ironically, the film was written for Ringwald, but somehow I just do not buy it. Andie seems contrived, and her emotions fall flat for me. It's also disappointing to see teens played by older actors. Molly Ringwald was the only real teenager. James Spader must have been about 25. But this is a memorable cast, nonetheless. Andrew Dice Clay has a cameo, and you can catch Gina Gershon, Dweezil Zappa, and Kristy Swanson in non-speaking roles. Cinematography is by the talented Tak Fujimoto. ""Pretty in Pink"" is fun, but you'll be thinking about the iconic characters and ignoring everything else.The DVD (Paramount 2006): The ""Everything's Duckie Edition"" is loaded with 8 featurettes, a Photo Gallery, and a feature commentary. Most of the featurettes include ""then and now"" interviews, taking footage from interviews with cast and crew in 1985 and in 2006. John Hughes is the only one not featured in any contemporary interviews. ""The First Time: The Making of Pretty in Pink"" (13 min) interviews director Howard Deutch, John Hughes, producer Lauren Shuler, and the cast about making the movie, the music, novice directorial mistakes, and the photography. ""Zoids and Richies"" (19 min) interviews cast and crew about characters and includes interesting stuff about casting.  ""Prom Queen: All About Molly"" (13 min) interviews Molly Ringwald et al about the character of Andie, her situation, her crush, etc.""Volcanic Ensembles"" (9 min) interviews costume designer Marilyn Vance and actors about the wardrobes. In ""Prom Stories"" (3 min), some cast and crew talk about their proms. ""Favorite Scenes"" (20 min) replays 8 memorable scenes from the movie followed by comments from the cast. ""The Lost Dance: The Original Ending"" (12 min) is about how and why the film's ending was changed. In ""Wrap Up: Epilogue"" (7 min), cast and crew comment on the film's enduring popularity.

Pretty In Pink, while it might have been Molly Ringwald's crowning achievement tied with Sixteen Candles, lives on in teen movie folklore and John Hughes's impressive resume, was anticlimatic.  The heroine doesn't end up with the lovable friend who had loved her from afar for years, but ends up with the rich guy.  Lucky for her the rich guy cares for her.  Rumor had it that the test audiences wanted her to end up with the rich guy and not the lovable Duckie.  *Sigh*  Well, the screwballs spoke and the producers listened.  We have Pretty In Pink still, but the ending brought it all down the drain.  So much for giving the people what they want.That was how I felt years ago.  Oh to be so young and foolish again!  I hadn't known love yet, and I hadn't known the pain of unrequited love as I do now.  Please let me point out to the world reading this that I am not a martyr who suffered so others can be happy, and I'm not a victim either although I've had my share of abusive and bad relationships.  If anything I've been very lucky, I've learned more about love than most people twice my age, if I can be so bold.  I identified the most with Duckie here, because just because you love someone doesn't mean that you are going to live happily ever after.  The love of my life and I are far apart, he choose to go another way, and I went another way as well.  But I will always love him.

You asked why does steph chase molly ringwald if he despises people who arent richie countryclub snot teens like him. Because although he is a snob he wanted molly ringwald. Remember at the beginning when he approached her at her car and said I'VE LIKED YOU FOR YEARS HOW COME WE NEVER WENT OUT"" And then blane comes along and dates her. Steph gives him a hard time because she rejected him and went for his best friend. Wouldn't you be upset? And at the end, blane said to steph, she thinks your sh*t and deep down you know she's right. You buy everything and you couldnt buy her that's why you're upset. And after steph's party when he threatened to end his friendship with blane if he continued dating ringwald and said that if money was even an issue would he treat his parents house like that. He was telling the truth. It had nothing to do with ringwald being on the other side of the tracks, it was because he liked her and she didnt feel the same, and blane ended up with her. Next, even though it does sound confusing that duckie cant get into a club with andy (ringwald) when he fell behind in high school you'd think that would make him older than her, but it depends on how early you started pre-school or if you went straight to kindergarden. Some seniors are 16 years old but most are 18, and some are 17. But it's just a movie. Any other questions. Don't pay attention to the questionaire guy that's his opinion nothing more. I had no idea andy's best friend (the blonde) died during the making of pretty in pink, so it never occured to me as being strange when suddenly the store clerk lady became andy's new best friend, i just thought she had more than one friend. So they did a nice job of covering that gap up.

She works at a small, but hip record store with her quirky, but older friend Iona (Annie Potts) and pals around with Duckie (Jon Cryer), her best friend who secretly loves her.  Andrew McCarthy is Blane the rich and popular boy who falls for Andie despite his friends, including the lecherous Steff (James Spader), balking at him for going out with poor white trash.  The film has a fairly formualmatic plot, but it is elevated above the simple story by wonderful performances by the three leads.  Ms. Ringwald is supremely sweet and you feel for her in her tough situation.  Mr. McCarthy is amiable as a someone caught between his feelings and friends and Mr. Cryer adds the perfect amount of comedy relief to his character.  Mr. Spader is also quite good in his role, but he seems too old to be a teenager and is just a little out of place.  The soundtrack to the film is first rate and the album peaked at number five on the charts.  This was the last big hit for Ms. Ringwald and the film marked her end as the teen queen of films.

The 3rd in 3 years, thus completing the 80's teen trilogy (""16 Candles"" in 1984, and ""The Breakfast Club"" in 1985). ""Pretty In Pink"" succeeds in several areas (Ringwald and Cryer are great together), but fails in comparison to the other 2 movies mentioned above. ""16 Candles"" was filled with bust-a-gut laughs with extremely memorable lines and characters (Long Duck Dong made this movie). ""The Breakfast Club"" was also filled with humor, but delt with several serious universal issues that teens deal with at the high school level (at school as well as at home). ""Pink"" deals with clashes between classes... a poor girl likes a rich guy and what happens along the way is what this movie is about. Not that there's anything wrong with that... but ""Pink"" just isn't in the same league as it's 2 predecessors. Molly Ringwald is basically the same kid you've seen before... just a tad more sad and depressed about who she is and the poor hand she's been delt in life. Jon Cryer's character (Duckie) is off the wall funny and just looking for acceptance by Ringwald (Andie) throughout the entire movie. Andrew McCarthy is the other co-star as the rich kid (Blain) daring to go across the tracks to tangle with Andie. The DVD has the restored movie - but, NO bonus features.

He simply took over whatever movie he was in and made it an instant classic. This movie had nothing going for it before they brough Andrew aboard with his total range. You had a complete nerd that was following around Molly Ringwald like a rotweiler follows a kid with a steak tied to his beltloop. Molly Ringwald isn't hot at all, which killed about 8 movies in about a four year period. I totally would have had some relations with Jennifer Conoli or Jami Gertz, but instead we were stuck with Ringbald. So you have a nerd, an ugly girl and a hot Annie Potts. She's yummy. The movie was going nowhere and kids were starting to get restless and then Andrew McCarthy decides to save this thing. He was dynamic as always with super cool facial expressions and great one liners like, ""You need to love yourself before I love yourself"". I could write 90 pages on how awesome McCarthy is, but let me simplify this thing. The original story had Ringdog ending up with Dorkie(or whatever the nerd's name is), but the movie producers understood that if a cool popular guy with money wants a girl, he gets that girl. I don't know why that is so hard for people to understand. I'm loaded and drop your groceries hot and if I want to go out with a girl, she goes out with me.

More than just teen angst,  the film develops the story around sacrificial love (Ringwald is the adult  in her single-parent home, nurturing her heart-broken, deadbeat father),  true love and true friendship.  No sex or violence, this is a great teen  film.

While I'm a HUGE fan of 80's teen movies (and 80's movies in general) this one definitely did next to nothing for me.The premise is simple: Molly Ringwald plays Andie, a high school senior who'll be graduating in a month. What sets her apart is the fact that she's poor and comes from a family of a lazy father and a mother who left them. Though she is poor, her home is typical middle class and her stylish clothing make her look a lot richer than she actually is, perhaps to hide the fact that she IS poor. Whatever. Her best friend Duckie is in love with her but doesn't want to ruin their friendship. Andie falls for a cute, but rich, guy at school (played by Andrew McCarthy). This new rich boy is envied and disliked by Duckie and is too much of a coward to stand up to his hoyty toyty rich best friend who doesn't wants to date Andie but is too much of a rich snob to snag her. He's mad so he tells his best friend to avoid her.Anyways, the typical senior prom happens at the end where Duckie realizes he only wants for Andie's happiness and she ends up chasing her crush out and kissing him and the movie ends.What's most annoying about this movie is the lameness of the characters. They just aren't very interesting. And when you think things are getting good, they do for a few minutes before the film drags along once again. This movie would've definitely been great if not for the complete lack of chemistry everyone involved had. Sure, there are tears and confusion, but you don't really care because these characters simply ACT OUT the script, you don't get the feeling at all that they're real people with real backgrounds. 99% of the time the ONLY interest they show in their lives is in their given situation. The ONLY time any character shows any type of human character is when Andie remakes her prom outfit because she's really into sewing and fashionable clothing. This doesn't add anything to the story except come in where it's handy. And even then it isn't handy cause the only reason she resewed her prom dress was cause her dad went out and bought one and said ""i know you may not like it, but i know you can do something with it."" she might as well have just gotten one herself she liked and that would've been the end of it.bottom line: a cookie cutter teen drama/comedy that starts nowhere, adds filler, and ends nowhere you care about.",2,Overrated and mostly empty teen drama (2.5),1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2465,"['Pretty', 'Pink', '80', 'teen', 'dramedy', 'may', 'have', 'FEW', 'worthy', 'moments', 'mostly', 'full', 'hot', 'air', ""'m"", 'HUGE', 'fan', '80', 'teen', 'movies', '80', 'movies', 'general', 'one', 'definitely', 'did', 'next', 'nothing', 'me.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Andie', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', ""'ll"", 'be', 'graduating', 'month', 'What', 'apart', 'fact', 'poor', 'family', 'lazy', 'father', 'mother', 'who', 'left', 'poor', 'home', 'typical', 'middle', 'class', 'stylish', 'clothing', 'make', 'look', 'lot', 'richer', 'actually', 'perhaps', 'hide', 'fact', 'poor', 'best', 'friend', 'Duckie', 'love', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'friendship', 'Andie', 'cute', 'rich', 'guy', 'school', 'played', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'new', 'rich', 'boy', 'envied', 'disliked', 'Duckie', 'too', 'much', 'coward', 'stand', 'up', 'hoyty', 'toyty', 'rich', 'best', 'friend', 'who', ""n't"", 'date', 'Andie', 'too', 'much', 'rich', 'snob', 'snag', 'mad', 'so', 'best', 'friend', 'avoid', 'her.Anyways', 'typical', 'senior', 'prom', 'end', 'where', 'Duckie', 'only', 'Andie', 'happiness', 'up', 'chasing', 'crush', 'kissing', 'movie', 'ends.What', 'most', 'annoying', 'movie', 'lameness', 'characters', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'interesting', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'getting', 'good', 'do', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'along', 'once', 'again', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'definitely', 'been', 'great', 'not', 'complete', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'everyone', 'involved', 'had', 'Sure', 'are', 'tears', 'confusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'simply', 'ACT', 'OUT', 'script', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'real', 'people', 'real', 'backgrounds', '99', '%', 'time', 'ONLY', 'interest', 'show', 'lives', 'given', 'situation', 'ONLY', 'time', 'character', 'type', 'human', 'character', 'when', 'Andie', 'prom', 'outfit', 'really', 'sewing', 'fashionable', 'clothing', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'come', 'where', 'handy', 'even', 'then', ""n't"", 'handy', 'cause', 'only', 'reason', 'resewed', 'prom', 'dress', 'was', 'cause', 'dad', 'went', 'bought', 'one', 'said', 'i', 'know', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'i', 'know', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'one', 'liked', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'end', 'it.bottom', 'line', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'teen', 'drama/comedy', 'nowhere', 'filler', 'nowhere', 'care']",Pretty in Pink VHS

Jon Cryer, Annie Potts, and Molly Ringwald never did better work: the young James Spader is marvelous sleaze, and a very fine actor, Harry Dean Stanton, plays Molly's dad as a man totally unmanned by his wife's having left him.  However, he ends up as the voice of wisdom (if less-than-standard grammar)in the movie: ""You can love someone, but it doesn't mean they'll love you back.""

He put Molly Ringwald with a brilliant cast that was amazing and he touched on the touchy subject of social class in High School very well.(May Contain Spoilers)Andie Walsh, (Molly Ringwald) lives with her unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton) in the wrong side of town. Andie is a very headstrong girl who isn't very well liked with any of her peers exept her friend Jenna and Duckie Dale, (Jon Cryer) the boy next door that would do anything for her. She and Duckie are often made fun of by the popular kids, especially Steff, (James Spader). But one popular guy Blaine, (Andrew McCarthey) has been secretly lusting after Andie.Andie works at Trax, a new wave music store with her older on the outside friend Iona, (Annie Potts) who advises Andie to go to her prom despite not having a date to enjoy it with. Blaine then comes in to buy an album and they talk briefly. In the computer lab next day at school, Andie realizes that she is falling for Blaine and vice versa. Blaine then breaks the social barrier to ask Andie out on a date, much to his buddy Steff's dismay. Andie's buddy Duckie doesn't approve either. Unfortunately, Andie and Blaine have to deal with the wrath of the student body for their relationship. Prom is coming up and the peer pressure suddenly gets to Blaine, leaving Andie dateless. Blaine decides to ignore all of his peers and goes back to Andie on prom night and after a little covincing from Duckie, Andie goes back to Blaine.Molly Ringwald has great acting skills and it really shows in this movie. Jon Cryer really puts on a great performance as Duckie and Andrew McCarthy, Annie Potts, James Spader and Harry Dean Stanton do a fantastic job in their roles. The superb acting makes this movie a must see.The ""Everything's Duckie Edition"" includes new interviews with the cast, a featurette about Molly and her work with John Hughes in the 80s, a featurette about the cast's prom stories and great archive footage from the making of the movie in 1985. The biggest flaw with this DVD is that the orignial ending where Andie and Duckie end up as a couple is not included. Instead, there is an interview on why the ending was cut. Other than that, Pretty in Pink fans should get this DVD.
