605040,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00005JLSB,A Customer,"[3, 3]","Summary:Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man in what he believes to be a very difficult situation - his father, Frank Abagnale, Sr. (Christopher Walken), is in trouble with the IRS and, as a result, his mother, Paula Abagnale (Nathalie Baye), is having an affair and wants a divorce.  Unable to handle the stress and not wanting to deal with the situation, Frank Jr. runs away from home.Unable to find a real job that will pay him what he needs, he turns to crime, but a type of crime that has some early roots in lessons learned by his father.  His crime spree begins as he realizes he can write people bad checks and get away with it.  However, the bad check scam only works for so long before people catch on.  Frank Jr. learns this rather quickly and, instead of continuing to write bad checks, turns to creating phony checks and cashing them at unwitting banks, realizing he can get away with it for much longer.His success at forging checks brings him to the attention of the FBI and their check fraud specialist, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  It is only through Carl's persistence that Frank Jr. is eventually caught, but not before Frank Jr. can try his hand at several other ploys.Building on his deceptiveness in the check forging scam, Frank learns that people very seldom actually check your references and as long as you look the part, they are willing to let you play it.  Frank takes advantage of this fact by getting a Pan-Am pilot's uniform and flying millions of free miles in the jumpseat of airplanes.  Once he becomes aware that Pan-Am is catching on he leaves the pilot business and forges the necessary credentials to become an emergency room supervising doctor that only requires him to make sure the residents under him take care of everything.  This job is short-lived however, and he trades it in for a job as a lawyer when he falls in love with a successful, New Orleans attorney's (Martin Sheen) daughter, Brenda Strong (Amy Adams (III)).He actually tries to adopt this life permanently, but his past catches up to him and eventually he has to flee to Europe to escape Carl, but to no avail.  Despite being caught after a multi-million dollar and several year crime spree, Carl eventually devises a plan to get Frank out of jail early and put him to work in the check fraud division at the FBI, where Frank Jr. eventually builds a very successful career.My Comments:I thought I was going to have a problem with this movie in the very beginning when Leonardo DiCaprio's name was before Tom Hanks's name in the opening credits, but I quickly realized that it was justifiable - this is not a Tom Hanks movie, it is a DiCaprio movie to the core and very good one at that.If the movie wasn't based on a true story (though embellished no doubt), it would fall into the absolutely unbelievable category of movies and I probably would not have given it as as good of a rating as I did.  Throughout the movie my wife and I were incredulous that something like this could actually have happened.  I haven't done enough research to actually discover what was real and what was embellished, but even if one-tenth of what happened in the movie was real this is still a fascinating story.  Of course, as with most movies where you are rooting for the criminal, it does kind of turn the tables on justice, but because this one is a real story where the criminal not only was caught but then turned around and began meting out justice to other criminals, you feel justified in rooting for him.  Also, despite any embellishments, the story was very solid - there were virtually no plot holes and very few if any gratuitous or wasted scenes.  This is a very tight movie.As for the acting, I think I am going to finally have to break down and give Leonardo DiCaprio some credit.  I also recently watched Gangs of New York and this guy has got it going right - he can play a very convincing number of roles.  DiCaprio was superb, hands down superb.  Also, the supporting cast, including Tom Hanks, were also very good.  There were only a few major names in the movie besides DiCaprio and Hanks, but major names weren't really necessary.  For the most part the acting in this film was very convincing.The only thing I might criticize about the movie was the opening credits.  They seemed wasted on silly animations that could have been used to introduce characters and cut down on the the movie time (this is a pretty long movie).This criticism carries over to the DVD menu structure because it uses a similar type of animation that is actually kind of difficult to read.  Other than this wasteful and silly decision, the movie was great.Overall, this is a wonderful movie.  The acting is very convincing and the story is impeccable.  I can't think of anything bad to say about this film.  It draws you in and stuns you with every twist and turn.  I highly recommend it.",5,Surprisingly good,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,4896,"['Summary', 'Frank', 'W.', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'young', 'man', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'situation', 'father', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Sr.', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'trouble', 'IRS', 'result', 'mother', 'Paula', 'Abagnale', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'having', 'affair', 'divorce', 'Unable', 'handle', 'stress', 'not', 'wanting', 'deal', 'situation', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'away', 'home.Unable', 'find', 'real', 'job', 'will', 'pay', 'what', 'crime', 'type', 'crime', 'early', 'roots', 'lessons', 'learned', 'father', 'crime', 'spree', 'can', 'write', 'people', 'bad', 'checks', 'get', 'away', 'However', 'bad', 'check', 'scam', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'people', 'catch', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'rather', 'quickly', 'instead', 'continuing', 'write', 'bad', 'checks', 'creating', 'phony', 'checks', 'cashing', 'unwitting', 'banks', 'realizing', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'much', 'longer.His', 'success', 'forging', 'checks', 'attention', 'FBI', 'check', 'fraud', 'specialist', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'only', 'Carl', 'persistence', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'eventually', 'caught', 'not', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'can', 'try', 'hand', 'several', 'other', 'ploys.Building', 'deceptiveness', 'check', 'forging', 'scam', 'Frank', 'people', 'very', 'seldom', 'actually', 'check', 'references', 'as', 'long', 'look', 'part', 'are', 'willing', 'let', 'play', 'Frank', 'advantage', 'fact', 'getting', 'Pan-Am', 'pilot', 'uniform', 'flying', 'millions', 'free', 'miles', 'jumpseat', 'airplanes', 'Once', 'aware', 'Pan-Am', 'catching', 'pilot', 'business', 'necessary', 'credentials', 'become', 'emergency', 'room', 'supervising', 'doctor', 'only', 'make', 'sure', 'residents', 'take', 'care', 'everything', 'job', 'short-lived', 'however', 'job', 'lawyer', 'when', 'love', 'successful', 'New', 'Orleans', 'attorney', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'daughter', 'Brenda', 'Strong', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'III', '.He', 'actually', 'tries', 'adopt', 'life', 'permanently', 'past', 'up', 'eventually', 'flee', 'Europe', 'escape', 'Carl', 'avail', 'being', 'caught', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'several', 'year', 'crime', 'spree', 'Carl', 'eventually', 'plan', 'get', 'Frank', 'jail', 'early', 'put', 'work', 'check', 'fraud', 'division', 'FBI', 'where', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'eventually', 'very', 'successful', 'career.My', 'Comments', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'very', 'beginning', 'when', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'name', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'name', 'opening', 'credits', 'quickly', 'realized', 'was', 'justifiable', 'not', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'DiCaprio', 'movie', 'core', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'true', 'story', 'embellished', 'doubt', 'would', 'fall', 'absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'category', 'movies', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'as', 'good', 'rating', 'did', 'movie', 'wife', 'were', 'incredulous', 'something', 'could', 'actually', 'have', 'happened', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'enough', 'research', 'actually', 'discover', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'what', 'was', 'embellished', 'even', 'one-tenth', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'was', 'real', 'still', 'fascinating', 'story', 'course', 'most', 'movies', 'where', 'are', 'rooting', 'criminal', 'kind', 'turn', 'tables', 'justice', 'one', 'real', 'story', 'where', 'criminal', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'caught', 'then', 'turned', 'around', 'began', 'meting', 'out', 'justice', 'other', 'criminals', 'feel', 'justified', 'rooting', 'Also', 'embellishments', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'were', 'virtually', 'plot', 'holes', 'very', 'few', 'gratuitous', 'wasted', 'scenes', 'very', 'tight', 'movie.As', 'acting', 'think', 'am', 'going', 'finally', 'have', 'break', 'down', 'give', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'credit', 'also', 'recently', 'watched', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'guy', 'got', 'going', 'right', 'can', 'play', 'very', 'convincing', 'number', 'roles', 'DiCaprio', 'was', 'superb', 'down', 'superb', 'Also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'major', 'names', 'movie', 'DiCaprio', 'Hanks', 'major', 'names', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'most', 'part', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'convincing.The', 'only', 'thing', 'might', 'criticize', 'movie', 'was', 'opening', 'credits', 'seemed', 'wasted', 'silly', 'animations', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'introduce', 'characters', 'cut', 'down', 'movie', 'time', 'pretty', 'long', 'movie', '.This', 'criticism', 'DVD', 'menu', 'structure', 'similar', 'type', 'animation', 'actually', 'kind', 'difficult', 'read', 'Other', 'wasteful', 'silly', 'decision', 'movie', 'was', 'great.Overall', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'story', 'impeccable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'bad', 'say', 'film', 'stuns', 'twist', 'turn', 'highly', 'recommend']",Catch Me If You Can

Which of the three is ""Frank William Abagnale"", the most daring confidence man under nineteen? He was caught in 1969 France and extradited to America. In 1963 his father Frank Sr. spoke at a Rotary dinner about his life. Later he got a loan from a bank but the family moved to an apartment. [Note the locks on the door.] Frank Jr. goes to a new high school, and impersonates the teacher of a French class! There is a surprise visitor at home, but Frank won't tell. His grandmother comes for a visit, his parents are divorcing. ""Everything will be ok."" ""Is it ok if I write you a check?"" Frank uses forged identification to pass a bad check (and failing). He studied the actions of airline pilots and learned their jargon. Next he orders a uniform. [Note the period automobiles on the street.] Frank has no problems in cashing checks or paying by check now. He forges another check.By knowing the jargon the ""Skywayman"" gets a free airplane ride as a deadhead. Frank learns the technical details of bank checking. He bought a used checkwriter machine to create authenticity. The MICR routing is in the numbers, a check from across the country won't be bounced for two weeks. Now the FBI is looking for him. His father has troubles with the IRS. An FBI team follows the forged checks to a motel; he is still there! There is a surprising meeting in the motel room. [There is unconscious humor here.] FBI agent Carl Hanratty has seen his face and can identify him. Later he buys new suits and meets a former model. ""How much would you pay?"" Frank has another check handy. On Christmas he makes a personal call to Carl Hanratty. ""You're gonna get caught."" A young waiter gives Carl a clue from a comic book - ""he's a kid"", his prints aren't in the system! They make a list of runaways and start a search. Frank's mother has a yearbook with his picture in it. ""$1.3 million.""Frank is living in an apartment in Atlanta. He goes to a hospital and meets a nurse. [Kindness can work with strangers.] ""You have really nice teeth."" ""I'm a doctor."" Frank's new forged identity is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. Frank Connors was at the top of his class. He watches TV movies about medical practice. But he has to answer an emergency call for a bloody accident. In NY Hanratty visits Frank Sr. and read the return address on a letter. [What, no mail cover?] Brenda tells about her past. Frank can help her, he meets her parents. ""That was beautiful."" [He can tell good stories.] ""The dog was dead."" Brenda's father wants the truth."" [Can a trial lawyer detect when a witness is lying?] Frank tells him the truth: he is nothing, really. How did he pass the bar exam in Louisiana?Frank is now an Assistant Prosecutor. But this time he gets his knowledge from a ""Perry Mason"" episode and makes a mistake. [""The Case of the Jealous Journalist"" was first shown on Sept. 2, 1961.] Frank visits his father and learns the news about his mother. He makes another call to Hanratty. ""Stop chasing me."" ""It's my job."" Hanratty knows ""he can't change his name now"". Men in dark suits crash the engagement party. Frank tells Brenda about his other names and identities. ""Why would you lie to me?"" Frank slips out by a window. At the airport Frank observes the watchers. Next he visits a college to impersonate an airline recruiter; it's a plan to escape surveillance! Frank flies to Europe and forges better checks with older equipment.But Hanratty surmises Frank is in France and living in his mother's village. ""That was really good, Carl."" Can Frank escape from an airplane in the air? Not for long. Frank got twelve years, to be served in isolation. ""Merry Christmas, Frank."" Afterwards Frank offers advice to Hanratty on detecting forged checks. He is offered a job to help them. There is a final scene in the airport. ""Nobody is chasing you."" ""How did he do it?""The words at the end said Frank helped the FBI capture some of the world's most elusive check forgers and counterfeiters, and is considered a foremost authority on bank fraud and forgery.

Abagnale, Jr.  Frank is a young adult who has decided to take the world by the horns and ride it until he's thrown...into jail.  This movie is Frank's story, adapted for the screen and adjusted slightly to be cinematically compelling.Frank learned the art of forging checks and took it to a new level.  In the process he flew thousands of miles for free posing as a pilot for Pan Am, cashing bad checks everywhere he went.  Electing to stay in one place for a while, he decides to try his hand at medicine and later law.  All the while, a determined FBI agent by the name of Carl Hanratty is on his trail and refuses to let up.For those of you who think that this is a bad film because the bad guy (Frank) &quot;gets away with it&quot; you should know that he spent years in jail in multiple countries for his crimes.

It is fun and exciting and engaging, but I find it also to be slightly forgettable.  It is one of those films that leaves no complaints while in the midst of enjoying it, but it isn't one that you're going to remember three days later.Make sense?The film tells the true story of con-man Frank Abagnale Jr., who by the time he was 21 had made a living at deceiving and `stealing' from the government.  He was a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, all the while never being any of those things.  He was, simply put, a genius.  Carl Hanratty was the FBI agent who was on his tail for years, never quite getting close enough to catch him (well, eventually), always one step behind.One thing to describe this film is `jovial'.  It is a happy fun film.  Within the restraints of the genre it works nicely.  It does lack the `human' element that could have really set this film apart (and made it more memorable).  While the film remains exciting and entertaining it lacks that gut punch that could have made this movie `mean something', and in the end it would have completed it.  That said, happy is what happy does, and happy does a lot for this film.  Not only is the plot rather boisterous, but the performances are all just so delightful.  Leonardo DiCaprio captures the suave and childlike adorableness of Frank Jr. rather remarkably.  A lot of my cinephile friends consider this one of his best performances.  I kind of agree, since it really capitalizes on everything that makes him such an endearing actor.  This is a far better performance than his confused turn in `Gangs of New York', which was released the same year.  Tom Hanks is perfectly matched here, for he really understands how to play up the genre here.  As many know, I am not a gigantic fan of Mr. Hanks, so for me to praise a performance takes a lot from me.  But, as anyone who knows me knows, I consider his lighthearted `non-baity' work to be his best (see `Big' and `That Thing You Do' for examples).  Christopher Walken may not be the most jovial character in the bunch (and he does insert the films only `human' element) but he nails his character.Also, look for Amy Adams in a scene stealing supporting role!All in all, `Catch Me If You Can' delivers a very strong and very likable experience.

I read the book that this is based on, and that may have been my problem. I was expecting too much. I am not a fan of Leo, but I do quite enjoy Chris Walken, I think he is great in this role.  However the movie tends to be a slow plodding homage to the era when the events take place.  The story of how a 18 year old kid turned into the one of the greatest non violent con men in American history seems to take a backseat to Steven Spielberg's infatuation with the era.  What is missing is the breezy carefree attitude that Mr. Abagnale expressed so easily in the book.  The film tries to hard to be moralistic.  I guess I was just expecting more when such a talented group of film makers and actors too on a great book like this.About the DVD:  I got this DVD for my birthday and watched disc one almost immediately, and was left disappointed, it took a few months for me to dig this out and take a look at disc two.

Here his character Frank evolves and resonates with fragility, bravado, wit and pathos.  Tom Hanks's Carl likewise is no one-dimensional cop, but a fully formed individual whose apparent staleness is deceptive and simultaneously revealing--his work is his life, and yet he expresses care for his duaghter and, ultimately, for Frank.""Catch Me"" entertains on many levels and proves rewatchable--for me a mark of all great films.  Other reviewers have commented that the film is not deep and epic and enduring as are some of Spielberg's other works.  I respond that Carl and Frank developed a unique and believable relationship whose complexity and universality combine to produce subtle import and audience identification surpassing the shallow feel-good wrap-up lesser films pander to their audiences.  The film's true-story aspect played only a minor role for me, as the story was of a boy needing stability and love, and of a man lost to his own family redeeming himself through this particular case.Oh, and don't invite Carl Hanratty to tell jokes at your next party. ""Knock, knock.""Who's there is a compelling story, the truth of which only serves to buttress a well-outfitted period chase film bent on revealing to its audience a pursuit of belonging and identity.  Matt Damon in ""The Bourne Identity"" sought to regain an identity he had lost.  Here DiCaprio and Hanks aim to assemble identities and connections they have never had.This fine film definitely lives a step above the action genre or shallower ""buddy"" ventures.

You will definitley leave the theater after this 2 hour + film very satisfied, with a smile on your face to boot. That is how incredibly enjoyable and fun this movie is. Right from the cool opening credits down to the last minute, it is nothing but a fun, entertaining ride for the viewing audience. Everybody knows that this is a true story based on the life experience of a real man, Frank William Abagnale, Jr. I haven't read the book, so I can't quite comment on how truthful it is, or what it leaves out. What a life. He was a 16 year old kid who was dealt with a upsetting blow in his family life, and it sent him on the run. If you haven't read the book, I won't say what causes this. Frank now finds himself on his own, with nowhere to go, and no one to do it with. Thus begins the cons. Frank becomes one of the best con men ever. He went on to impersonate an airline pilot(as Frank Taylor), and then a doctor(under the name Frank Connors), and then onto being a lawyer. He even took the bar exam and passed. In a few funny scenes, Frank is seeing watching tapes of ""Perry Mason"", ""Dr. Kildare"", and ""Dr. No"", all after taking on these new identities, to get a hang of just what exactly he is doing. All of this before he turned 19 years old. Hot on his trail is FBI agent Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks. The chase scenes between the two are extremely fun. How he slips away, which sets the cat and mouse game back in action, is great. Once caught, Frank is asked to work with the FBI helping out check fraud, under the supervision of Hanratty of course. This is unlike any Spielberg film I've seen. Different. All Frank wanted was a family. He loved his mother, but it seemed he had a closer, more loving bond with his father, Frank William Abagnale, Sr., who is played by the always fantastic Christopher Walken. The scenes they have together are all wonderful. Some of the best moments in the film. Frank wanted his parents. That's all. Once you get get past the fact of all the incredible things he has done, impersonated, and gotten away with, you start to remember that he is just a 16 year old kid, scared to death, and wanting a home, with a mother and father, to go too. This is what also makes his relationship with Hanratty so interesting too. He is chasing him. He's around. When he is caught and in Carl's care, it is apparent that Carl has been somewhat of a father figure to him. These two relationships with Frank and his father and Frank with Carl are very interesting to watch. The identities and all that are great fun, but it's these storylines that are fascinating to watch. The actors here are all great. Leonardo DiCaprio has proved that he is a great actor, and he is far more than just the king of world idol from ""Titanic"". For all the fronts he puts up, you see down deep that he is a scared young kid. He did a wonderful job. Tom Hanks shines too. But then again, when doesn't he?. Hanratty is a real man of course, and Tom makes it seem so on the screen. A harried man just trying to do his job. Walken is great as I've already said earlier. Martin Sheen also appears in a small role, as does James Brolin, and an uncredited Jennifer Garner from ""Alias"". John William's score is zippy and whimsical and it takes you right into the time. A nice piece of work. The film also looks amazing. They got great colors and the look and feel of the 60's down pat. It is a fantastic looking film. While it may appear to be light and shallow(Amazon's wrong)at first, you got to look beyond that and see what's really going on. This is something Spielberg has always been a master at. This is, pure and simple, one of the most entertaining and enjoyable films of the year.

FBI Agent Carl Handratty (Tom Hanks) had his first face to face encounter with Abagnale when Abagnale was imprisoned in France in 1969, after several years attempting to capture him. After being arrested and place on the plane Abagnale begins telling his story to Handratty which leads Spielberg to get tricky and start flashback #2. (Confused? I was at first). This starts the real story of Frank's escapades at Xmas 1963 with Frank watching his father Frank Sr (Christopher Walken) receive a doctorate. As it turns out Dad was also the one who taught Jr the art of scamming: The earliest example is when Frank successfully poses as a substitute French teacher at his own school! Of course along the way he assumes the identities of a Doctor, Lawyer and Pediatrician conning his way to immense wealth and throwing Hanratty off his trail numerous times- even posing as a Secret Service agent trying to help Hanratty!But then as happens in life, Frank meets a wonderful girl and falls in love so soon he is grappling with the idea of telling her the truth about who he really is; and then risking being arrested and being separated from the woman he loves.Sure, the story is pretty basic; but CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is still a highly enjoyable and fascinating movie which manages to maintain viewer interest for its full two hours plus running time.

They take an intriguing premise, a 16 year old runs away from home after his parents seperate and becomes one of the most notorious check forgers in U.S. history, and turns it into a very watchable film.  Spielberg wisely keeps the pace breezy and avoids some of the darker aspects of Frank's life (although it is hinted at in several powerful scenes between DiCaprio and Walken, especially the one set in a New York bar), setting the tone for an extremely entertaining &quot;coming-of-age&quot; movie from the swingin' 60's.  It's a great story told with vibrant actors, colors, wardrobe etc. that bring to life the era in which they took place.  The only downside of the film is that the ending is very disjointed from the overall pacing of the film.  Its like your cruising along the highway at a pretty good clip and someone neutral drops your car.  Although the ending turns out to have great redemptive value for the character and I was glad when Abignale finally turned himself around, Spielberg could've had a more direct way of coming to that conclusion that is more in-line with the overall tone of the picture.

And they appear to be a well off functional family. Later, a financial crisis hits, and their living standards are reduced drastically. He still loves both his parents, but we can see that he is starting to lean towards his father. After he realizes that they are getting divorced, he can't handle it and runs away. A gem of comedy from Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is when he tries to make Frank Jr's decision as to who he will live with easier: ""Frank, just put my name down.""After this tragic beginning, the comedy kicks in. Frank Jr. goes from being financially wrecked to financially stuffed. First he impersonates a pilot. At this point, the FBI agent Tom Hanks comes in. While the movie leads us into cheering for Frank Jr., it does NOT make the mistake of allowing us to hate the Tom Hanks character. (We are also permitted a moment of sympathy for him when he realizes his team is not exactly an 'elite squad.') Tom Hanks and Frank Jr. cross, but Frank Jr. avoids capture. (This is when Frank Jr. starts taunting Tom Hanks with telephone calls.)Frank Jr. then goes on to impersonate a doctor. At this point tensions are released. Tom Hanks has lost thew trail; and Frank Jr. meets a woman who he may want to spend his life with. A small unbelievable element here is that Frank Jr. and she jump ship just when Tom Hanks has picked up the trail again.Moving on, Frank Jr. decides it is time to impersonate a lawyer now. At this point he is tired from running, but too late he realizes that you can't just steal $4,000,000. and call a truce. It is worth noting that if Tom Hanks had not seen Frank Jr's face, Frank Jr. may have had a chance to go back to a normal life.The deception is understandably starting to wear Frank Jr. down, and in a comical manner, he slips under the FBI agents and makes his way to Europe. If I say much more, I'll probably ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it.I'll just say it is an interesting end with elements of both sorrow and reconciliation.

605084,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JLSB,Caleb Williams,"[2, 2]","Catch Me If You Can is one of those true story movies that achieves a rarity. It gives you a really interesting and intense film while still keeping its feet on the ground and not going overboard or off track with the initial story.This film is based around the true life of Frank Abagnale Jr. who became known as an expert impostor, who managed to con Pan Am airlines out of millions of dollars by impersonating a pilot, a doctor and a legal prosecutor. In the movie it generally keeps to the core roots of Franks story and the man himself was even involved in the making of the movie.The film is set out from his teenage days and shows a young man who has a talent of confidence. This confidence allows him to fit into any role he's presented with and at the start of the movie we see him impersonating a teacher, which ultimately gets him into trouble. He's a kid who idolises his father, a man who's in serious trouble with the IRS and is being cheated on by his wife, Franks mother. Frank Jr's parents split and Frank runs away to Manhattan with just $25 in his checking account. Determined to clear his Fathers losses and repair his parents marriage, Frank becomes one of the biggest con artists ever known to the United States. The film then turns into a cat & mouse chase between Frank & FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, but what starts as a felon being chased by a cop turns into a father & son type relationship.The film itself is just incredible, the settings and the script are just superb and have a certain style and confidence very rarely seen in movies these days. It has real life situations taking place that to some would seem utterly unbelievable, yet the film makers display these situations with such a confidence (Due to them being true situations and all) that it's pulled off without it detracting from the film itself.There's one scene in particular which I'm thinking about and it's a point in which Carl actually manages to find Frank and get into his Motel room while Frank is still there. At this stage in the film Carl is unaware of what Frank looks like and Frank, with his sheer exuberance manages to convince Carl, with no proof what so ever, that he's the man who's caught Frank and had him arrested moments earlier. Taken in by his confidence, Carl believes the story and allows Frank to leave the room and ultimately escape. Of course to most people this would seem utterly ridiculous but the way it's put together in the film, it works perfectly.A very good movie that is a masterpiece in my eyes and unfortunately overlooked by many.

605089,A2FS38D943KX12,B00005JLSB,chefdevergue,"[0, 1]","The Spielberg canon can pretty much be divided into two categories.  On the one hand, there is the escapist, fantasy Spielberg (ET, Close Encounters, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park), where the movies are enormously entertaining but leave the viewer without any real insights.  On the other hand is the more recent serious Spielberg (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) which present serious topics & stunning character studies, but are at times so intense and raw as to be unwatchable.  The second category forced the film industry finally to acknowledge Spielberg as one of the great filmmakers of his time, rather than a commercially successful lightweight.After finally being taken seriously, Spielberg faced the new challenge of making a film which bridged the categories, one that was both entertaining and thought-provoking.  He has largely succeeded with ""Catch Me if You Can.""To me the film was largely a study of the character of two men, the elder and younger Frank Abagnale.  The father (in one of the best performances by Christopher Walken I have ever seen) imparts to his son the philosophy that ""if you act successful, you will be perceived as successful.""  Despite a lifetime of defeats and setbacks, Abagnale Sr. always keeps his chin and plays the part of a man who has the upper hand in life.  Appearance is everything.Abagnale Jr. takes this philosophy to its logical extreme.  Play the part, and you will become the part.  As long as he had the nerve to be deceive people into thinking he was a pilot, a doctor, or a lawyer, then that was exactly what he was, despite having no skills (although he did pass the bar exam) in those fields.It is interesting that the movie viewer is almost encouraged to indulge in moral relativism and root for Abagnale Jr. as he practices this massive deception, as well as massive fraud.  Will basically lying to every person he meets, Abagnale Jr. also embarks on a fraudulent check scheme of an almost unimaginable scale, passing nearly $2.5 million in bad checks.  But one is left with the impression that it isn't a crime until you get caught, especially if the crime is executed with such virtuosity.The one character in the film who sees Abagnale Jr. for the criminal he is, is Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is portrayed a bloodless pedant bereft of any humor.  The one man who represents authority, and is able finally to bring an end to Abagnale Jr.'s crime spree comes off as being rather unsympathetic to the viewer.You can't help but hope that Abagnale Jr. doesn't get caught.  The chase that unfolds is absolutely fascinating, and the sheer nerve that is displayed is awe-inspiring.  I suspect that most of us have an inner con man that is fighting to get out, but we are too chicken to risk the consequences.Enjoy ""Catch Me if You Can,"" and let your inner con man live vicariously through the film.",4,Good character study but still very entertaining,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,2867,"['Spielberg', 'canon', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'be', 'divided', 'two', 'categories', 'one', 'hand', 'escapist', 'fantasy', 'Spielberg', 'ET', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'where', 'movies', 'are', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'leave', 'viewer', 'real', 'insights', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'recent', 'serious', 'Spielberg', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'present', 'serious', 'topics', 'stunning', 'character', 'studies', 'are', 'times', 'so', 'intense', 'raw', 'be', 'unwatchable', 'second', 'category', 'forced', 'film', 'industry', 'finally', 'acknowledge', 'Spielberg', 'one', 'great', 'filmmakers', 'time', 'rather', 'commercially', 'successful', 'lightweight.After', 'finally', 'being', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Spielberg', 'faced', 'new', 'challenge', 'making', 'film', 'bridged', 'categories', 'one', 'was', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'largely', 'succeeded', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'film', 'was', 'largely', 'study', 'character', 'two', 'men', 'elder', 'younger', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'father', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'imparts', 'son', 'philosophy', 'act', 'successful', 'will', 'be', 'perceived', 'successful', 'lifetime', 'defeats', 'setbacks', 'Abagnale', 'Sr.', 'always', 'chin', 'part', 'man', 'who', 'upper', 'hand', 'life', 'Appearance', 'everything.Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'philosophy', 'logical', 'extreme', 'Play', 'part', 'will', 'become', 'part', 'As', 'long', 'had', 'nerve', 'be', 'deceive', 'people', 'thinking', 'was', 'pilot', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'then', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'having', 'skills', 'did', 'pass', 'bar', 'exam', 'fields.It', 'interesting', 'movie', 'viewer', 'almost', 'encouraged', 'indulge', 'moral', 'relativism', 'root', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'practices', 'massive', 'deception', 'as', 'well', 'massive', 'fraud', 'Will', 'basically', 'lying', 'person', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'also', 'fraudulent', 'check', 'scheme', 'almost', 'unimaginable', 'scale', 'passing', 'nearly', '2.5', 'million', 'bad', 'checks', 'one', 'left', 'impression', ""n't"", 'crime', 'get', 'caught', 'especially', 'crime', 'executed', 'such', 'virtuosity.The', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'who', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'criminal', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'portrayed', 'bloodless', 'pedant', 'bereft', 'humor', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'authority', 'able', 'finally', 'bring', 'end', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'crime', 'spree', 'off', 'being', 'rather', 'unsympathetic', 'viewer.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hope', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'chase', 'absolutely', 'fascinating', 'sheer', 'nerve', 'displayed', 'awe-inspiring', 'suspect', 'most', 'have', 'inner', 'con', 'man', 'fighting', 'get', 'out', 'are', 'too', 'chicken', 'risk', 'consequences.Enjoy', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'let', 'inner', 'con', 'man', 'live', 'vicariously', 'film']",Catch Me If You Can
605090,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,B00005JLSB,"""chick_flick""","[0, 0]","""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of former con artist, Frank Abagnale Jr., directed by Steven Speilberg.PLOT SUMMARY: In ""Catch Me..."", Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Frank Abagnale Jr., a teenager of the 60's who's life abruptly changes when his parents (played by Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye), get a divorce. His father was being investigated by the FBI, and Frank, not wanting to have to choose between living with his mother or father, took off. Now on the run, Frank needed money. He had no previous job experience or college education. So what did he do? He changed his name, forged checks, and disgused himself as a co-pilot for a Pan Am jet, became a lawyer, and a doctor--all without licenses! After investing over $2.5 million, he eventually got the FBI's attention...one particular FBI agent however, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), did and risked everything to catch Frank and put him to justice.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: ""Catch Me If You Can"" was clever, witty, and a quirky film. It was fast-paced with excellent, Oscar-worthy performances delivered (especially by DiCaprio and Hanks--who, by the way, made a terrific dueo team) by the entire cast. The screenplay, written by Jeff Nathanson, was wonderful. The humor is solid, though I don't really know if it is actually a ""full-fledge comedy""...you probably won't be laughing all the way through. Steven Speilberg has yet to disappoint me with his work. With each and every film he does, he continues to impress and entertain me. Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life story is indeed extraodinary; what amazes me most is HOW he became the most successful con artist BEFORE he turned twenty-one years old. All of that is revealed in the film, which you must go and see by the way. All I can say is that I will definitely by the DVD when it comes out--hopefully, it will have some great bonus features, as Speilberg always remembers to add onto the DVDs of his films.I highly recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"".Score:100/100A+",5,Catch this film if you can!,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,1986,"['Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'former', 'con', 'artist', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Speilberg.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'teenager', '60', 'who', 'life', 'abruptly', 'when', 'parents', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'get', 'divorce', 'father', 'was', 'being', 'investigated', 'FBI', 'Frank', 'not', 'wanting', 'have', 'choose', 'living', 'mother', 'father', 'took', 'off', 'Now', 'run', 'Frank', 'needed', 'money', 'had', 'previous', 'job', 'experience', 'college', 'education', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'changed', 'name', 'forged', 'checks', 'disgused', 'co-pilot', 'Pan', 'Am', 'jet', 'became', 'lawyer', 'doctor', 'licenses', 'investing', '2.5', 'million', 'eventually', 'got', 'FBI', 'attention', 'one', 'particular', 'FBI', 'agent', 'however', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', 'risked', 'everything', 'catch', 'Frank', 'put', 'justice.MY', 'OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'was', 'clever', 'witty', 'quirky', 'film', 'was', 'fast-paced', 'excellent', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'delivered', 'especially', 'DiCaprio', 'Hanks', 'who', 'way', 'made', 'terrific', 'dueo', 'team', 'entire', 'cast', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Jeff', 'Nathanson', 'was', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'solid', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'actually', 'full-fledge', 'comedy', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'laughing', 'way', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'yet', 'disappoint', 'work', 'film', 'impress', 'entertain', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'life', 'story', 'indeed', 'extraodinary', 'what', 'most', 'HOW', 'became', 'most', 'successful', 'con', 'artist', 'turned', 'twenty-one', 'years', 'old', 'revealed', 'film', 'must', 'go', 'see', 'way', 'can', 'say', 'will', 'definitely', 'DVD', 'when', 'out', 'hopefully', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'bonus', 'features', 'Speilberg', 'always', 'add', 'DVDs', 'films.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', '.Score:100/100A+']",Catch Me If You Can

From the trailer, I was expecting IN LIKE FLINT, THE PINK PANTHER, JAMES BOND... something quick witted, colorful and frantic, but instead it was slow.  It had some snazzy parts.  In fact, it had some really good parts, but I couldn't help thinking that this movie was more suited for a CBS sunday movie or LIFETIME NETWORK.Before seeing the movie, I was expecting to see an OSCAR contendor or something.  After seeing the movie, I will be really disappointed if it is.  In fact, now I'm thinking CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND is the real TRUE STORY movie to see.CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a true story and it's an interesting story.  The acting is great.  I don't think anything different of DICAPRIO or HANKS.  They're both top notch performers.  In fact, if anybody deserves any acknowledgement in this movie, it's CHRIS WALKEN.  He's outstanding in it.  Maybe a best supporting actor here.Although, the movie was a let down, should have just waited for it to come out on video.  A good movie, but not what I expected and not the kind of movie I wanted to see.",3,HOPING FOR SNAPPY AND GOT DROOPY,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1430,"['was', 'pretty', 'psyched', 'CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'before', 'came', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'psycho', 'DICAPRIO', 'TITANIC', 'fans', 'anything', 'opinion', 'real', 'star', 'TITANIC', 'was', 'JAMES', 'CAMERON', 'trailers', 'looked', 'snappy', 'snazzy', 'hip', 'little', 'movie', 'SPIELBERG', 'charge', 'Come', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss.I', 'think', 'did', 'though.It', 'nothing', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'was', 'expecting', 'IN', 'LIKE', 'FLINT', 'THE', 'PINK', 'PANTHER', 'JAMES', 'BOND', 'something', 'quick', 'witted', 'colorful', 'frantic', 'instead', 'was', 'slow', 'had', 'snazzy', 'parts', 'fact', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'parts', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'suited', 'CBS', 'sunday', 'movie', 'LIFETIME', 'NETWORK.Before', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'OSCAR', 'contendor', 'something', 'seeing', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'now', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'CONFESSIONS', 'A', 'DANGEROUS', 'MIND', 'real', 'TRUE', 'STORY', 'movie', 'see.CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'true', 'story', 'interesting', 'story', 'acting', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'different', 'DICAPRIO', 'HANKS', ""'re"", 'top', 'notch', 'performers', 'fact', 'anybody', 'acknowledgement', 'movie', 'CHRIS', 'WALKEN', 'outstanding', 'Maybe', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'here.Although', 'movie', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'waited', 'come', 'out', 'video', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see']",Catch Me If You Can

The story is based on the late teen years of Frank Abagnale, who committed check fraud to an incredible degree and kept taking on different false identities and jobs around the U.S.  It must have been quite a challenge to put this remarkable story into a movie format.  Though I wanted to see more of the complex details of how he pulled off his impersonations, I think that would have been very hard to do and still keep the movie flowing quickly.  There are many suspenseful moments and a lot of interesting tension in the relationships Frank has with his family, girlfriends, employers and fellow employees, and with his FBI nemesis (Tom Hanks).  I like it that director Spielberg used the symbolism of a tumbling washer at a laundromat to signify a love affair Frank is having, rather than nudity.  The movie did not need all the bad language, though (which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5).  The irony is excellent at the end when Frank gets out of prison by working for the FBI in the department of ""check fraud"", and you see him through the window blinds, sitting in an office, the prison he's created for himself!

605098,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JLSB,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 0]","Ever since putting out Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg's been sort of hit-and-miss. From likable outings like Minority Report to Munich to sort-of-okay ones such as A.I and The Terminal. Catch Me If You Can, a film similar in tone to the Terminal is a bit more accessible and it's interesting all the way through. But interesting doesn't mean great through and through and the film suffers from what I call a ""perfectly too long script"" where the film can't really be cut down but you wish it had been.The film centers on real-life con artist Frank Abagnale Jr. who successfully impersonated an Airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and receiving the checks priviledged to such prestigious careers. Of course people aren't too happy and on the case is FBI man Carl Hanratty, an expert on bank fraud. But there's more to Frank than just writing bad checks as he has some family issues that he needs to have taken care of and the desire to keep running.This is kind of a hard Spielberg film to like because it's more a sum-of-its-parts kind of film than looking at individual achievements. All his films, from E.T to Close Encounters to Jaws and Jurassic Park always had some memorable image or a musical theme or something. In this case, it's more acting that shines through. From Leonardo DiCaprio bringing in a great turn as Frank to the one who should've gotten the Oscar, Christopher Walken. Only real problem is Frank's chaser, Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. He plays it with an awful accent and at times you can't even tell what kind of character he's supposed to be.Where the film doesn't really fail but just sort of stumbles is in its pace. This is a film where looking back it's hard to tell what could be cut since a lot of it is important to establishing characters and motivations yet it just feels too long, like a movie you want to trim down but you wouldn't even know where to start. But tonally the film feels just right from its almost sugary atmosphere to the chase music. It's nice to see John Williams NOT to something that sounds like Star Wars all the time). It's not even close to being Spielberg's worst (look to 1941 for that) but not really Spielberg's best but it's still a nice little movie.If you're expecting another classic, look elsewhere.

So their will be a number of readers who won't like what I going to say, but every man has a right to his opinion, so here goes.Based on a true story, ""Catch Me..."" is the tale of con-man, Frank Abignale, Jr. who over a 5-6 year period posed as a pilot, doctor and deputy prosecutor as he bilked over $4 million dollars in ""salary"" from Pan Am, a medical hospital and the city of New Orleans.  Frank's story is basically a sad one that Director Steven Spielberg portrays accurately.  So accurately in fact, that the movie is rather depressing to watch.  The son of a con-man, young Frank learned the ways of his father quite well and spent a number of years just trying to get his father's approval and his parents back together.FBI agent Hanratty (Hanks) spends the entire movie on the trail of young Frank coming oh-so-close, but almost always finding himself one step behind.  Speilberg seems to takes considerable poetic license in portraying both Hanks and the FBI as modern day Keystone Kops who never quite get the job done!  I can't imagine that the real FBI bungled the chase as much as Speilberg portrayed.It's hard to believe that this movie was just a ""mudder"" with the outstanding cast that it had. (But then again, look at the cast of ""Nothing But Trouble"" and explain to me why that ensemble allowed themselves to be associated with THAT celluloid dog!!)You just can't get much better than Tom Hanks, Chris Walken and Martin Sheen and each of them seemed to be oddly out of place in this film.  Leonardo Dicaprio does a credible job as young Frank, but even he seems stunted somewhat by Speilberg's heavy-handed direction.Well...maybe I am a little hard on the film, but I did go into it with very high expectations.  So rather than completely ignore it, the viewer should probably pony up the cash to rent it (I wouldn't buy it) and make his or her own qualified judgement.

I know the feeling: When I was kid I managed to pass myself off as twins for my whole seventh grade year and once invented a religion I had several people actually interested in. People believed me, because I believed me. Stern parental lectures eventually cured me of this tendency, but poor real-life con-artist Frank Abagnale had no such luck. ""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on his life from the age of 15 to the age of 19, during which he flew Pan Am as a co-pilot, was the Supervising Doctor in a Georgia ER, and Assistant Prosecuter in the State of Louisiana.  The fact that he did not actually attend school for any of the above occupations had no effect on his activities whatsoever. He also forged checks to the tune of almost three million dollars; his forging so flawless even old time master forgers were in awe. And when it all finally came to an end, as of course it had to, he even managed to turn the end into a kind of triumph.The film is based on Frank's autobiography, with Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale. He is absolutely terrific, radiating a kind of giddy joy he hasn't shown us in a long time. His Frank is good-hearted, good-natured, charming, but most importantly, fearless . People believe him, because he believes him.  My favorite scene with him comes early: Starting a new school, Frank walks into his first class and on a complete whim pretends to be the substitute teacher. He is cheerfully holding parent-teacher conferences and planning field trips when he is finally found out.Co-star Tom Hanks does a solid job in the role of the determined FBI agent who chased Frank obsessively for years. Tracking him down evolves into a kind of thrilling chessgame for the two of them, and there is a great running gag about their always talking on Christmas Eve. (The agent is at work because he has no outside life, and Frank calls him because he has no one else to call.) Dicaprio also has a strong chemistry with Walken, who plays Frank's father and subtle enabler.The direction of Speilberg is typically superb, and the snazzy art direction and playful score contribute to the overall excellence. Chalk up another for the master.In conclusion, all I can say is that this is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and certaining the funnest. I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied and happy, and, I admit, a little envious. Frank Abagnale led quite a life. He paid for it in the end, but still.

605103,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00005JLSB,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 4]","Frank Abignale is a con artist without really trying to be.  Fleeing from his parents' divorce at the age of 16, he observes how much respect a Pan Am pilot gets from a hotel concierge and the young ladies.  He therefore gets his hands on a uniform, passes off a few bad cheques, and is on his way to fame, fortune, girls, and free air travel.That's about all there is to this immensely enjoyable, funny, and lighthearted film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the con artist, Christopher Walken as his father, and Tom Hanks as an FBI agent trying to track him down.  The performances are all excellent, as you might expect from the cast.  John William's score is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but its &quot;jazz fusion&quot; feel sets the perfect tone for Abignale's ad lib life of deception.Some have complained that the characters are a little shallow and the adventure superficial - this is unfair, as the movie doesn't mean to be anything but a light-hearted romp.  It is unfairly overlooked, I think, because of the principle filmmakers' other projects that were released the same year: Spielberg's controversial A.I. and critical and commercial hit Minority Report, DiCaprio's multi-Oscar nominated Gangs of New York, and Hanks' multi-Oscar nominated Road to Perdition.  However, for pure enjoyment, this film beats all the above hands-down.This DVD edition has a second disc filled with short subjects on casting, music, and technical information that is informative and interesting.  As usual for Spielberg, there is no audio commentary, which continues to be a disappointment, but the rest of the extras are very good.",4,"Immensely enjoyable film, good (not great) DVD edition",1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,1620,"['Frank', 'Abignale', 'con', 'artist', 'really', 'trying', 'be', 'Fleeing', 'parents', 'divorce', 'age', '16', 'how', 'much', 'respect', 'Pan', 'Am', 'pilot', 'hotel', 'concierge', 'young', 'ladies', 'therefore', 'hands', 'uniform', 'few', 'bad', 'cheques', 'way', 'fame', 'fortune', 'girls', 'free', 'air', 'travel.That', 'immensely', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'lighthearted', 'film', 'starring', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'con', 'artist', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'father', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'FBI', 'agent', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'might', 'expect', 'cast', 'John', 'William', 'score', 'somewhat', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'quot', 'jazz', 'fusion', 'quot', 'perfect', 'tone', 'Abignale', 'ad', 'lib', 'life', 'deception.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'characters', 'are', 'little', 'shallow', 'adventure', 'superficial', 'unfair', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'anything', 'light-hearted', 'romp', 'unfairly', 'overlooked', 'think', 'principle', 'filmmakers', 'other', 'projects', 'were', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Spielberg', 'controversial', 'A.I', 'critical', 'commercial', 'hit', 'Minority', 'Report', 'DiCaprio', 'multi-Oscar', 'nominated', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'Hanks', 'multi-Oscar', 'nominated', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'However', 'pure', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'above', 'hands-down.This', 'DVD', 'edition', 'second', 'disc', 'filled', 'short', 'subjects', 'casting', 'music', 'technical', 'information', 'informative', 'interesting', 'usual', 'Spielberg', 'audio', 'commentary', 'be', 'disappointment', 'rest', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'good']",Catch Me If You Can
605104,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,B00005JLSB,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[2, 2]","Catch Me If You Can (2002), dir. Steven SpielbergWith: Leonardo DiCaprio,  Tom Hanks.Spielberg, aided by the talents of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, made an entertaining two-hour plus movie that, despite a slightly moralistic twist, is, in his words, &#65533;pure unadulterated fun.&#65533;  Catch Me If You Can must not be seen as a serious movie, but it does make a few ironic points,  if you are not too entertained to notice them. Its a cat-and-mouse structure,  comedic tone, movie, with light moments, a few (too few, given the subject) serious ones, with suspense galore&#65533;and Spielberg is just as much of a master of suspense as the old master (Hitchcock), whom Spielberg often imitates.Comedy, satire, the American ethos: an unhappy youngster, a mom who flirts, a semi-drunk dad, and a young man who goes astray; he is smart, ingenious and discovers early that the easiest way to make money is to dupe people. So he pretends to be a school teacher, a pilot in PANAM, a phony doctor, and even a lawyer. He forges checks with uncanny ability, showing how easy it is to cash a phony check if you are charming and convincing. In tight situations, he uses ready wit&#65533;reminding us of his prototype, Huck Finn (who extricated himself from tight situations by lying readily). Of course, he has his way with women, for Abagnale (a real person) is somewhat of a Don Juan, though not for amorous reasons. This man wants to deceive for the sake for deceiving. He makes money, but rarely uses it. He is out there for the thrills, and also because he is essentially a loner, though the movie never gives him sufficient pause to introspect. He always hurries, between tight situations Thus the quick pacing, which keeps us entertained, if nothing else.This actually is the point of the entire movie. We do not have much time to think. The young conman is constantly in peril, and manages to slip away just by the breadth of a hair. Tom Hanks is somewhat heavy-handed at first, slow to catch up with the youngster&#65533;s quicker wit. But sooner than later he gets the point&#65533;and closes in. He tells him (the two are on the phone several times), it&#65533;s like Las Vegas: you win a few, but in the end it&#65533;s the house that wins. And Hanks, in fact, is good in this, almost a supporting role. He is a surrogate father, and, if the movie makes a moral point, he does fulfill that role.Though based on real life, and real life-events, this movie barely escapes being a shallow escapade. If it has a moral, it is a surface one: those out there be aware of imposters. It&#65533;s incredibly easy to cash false checks; charming young people are not what they appear. If you are a woman, be extra careful next time you see someone resembling Leo DiCaprio, or anyone like him. If you are an FBI agent, don&#65533;t be so clumsy with your first attempts to catch a crook. If you are an ordinary American, look around you for phonies&#65533;they can be anywhere, including inside your family.This is the stuff Hollywood makes, and, if anything, Spielberg is first and foremost a Hollywood man&#65533;and a good salesman of his products to boot (DreamWorks). Never mind pretensions of art in his movies. This is not the guy/director who will make an art movie, even if his wildest dreams came true. That task is for the likes of John Sayles (have you seen Sunshine State?) or Martin Scorsese, who will venture into the wilderness of art movie making with Travis Bickle or Jesus (or Nicholas Cage)&#65533;all this to satisfy his mania for discovering true people in true places. Spielberg plays the big game: he wants a guaranteed success in his screens versions of truth.To be fair, the movie does take some pains to explore the depths of naivet&eacute; people will fall into, or the lengths to which they go to be deceived. It&#65533;s like a national affliction: we Americans like to be conned, whether it&#65533;s the money that&#65533;s taken from us by corporate wizards (witness ENRON), by taxes (never mind Bush&#65533;s tax cuts), funeral parlors, drug industries (legal or illegal), or charming youths. Do you want to be an air pilot? Just wear the uniform and come to the job with an assured smile. Do you want to get your PH.D. in 24 hours? Just look at your unsolicited e-mail. That&#65533;s how easy and painless it is.From that standpoint the movie wins. It warns the wise and cautions the nave. It gives a lesson to the dispirited and the despairing, teaching that anything is possible&#65533;including forging non-existing checks. Win a million the easy way. It teaches the bad ways of the American way. If you are a thief once, don&#65533;t give up. The FBI will shelter you and offer you a job (and get you out of jail) if you can help catch more thieves. You are in the right country, where winning is the name of the game. In a deliciously twisted ironic comment, Tom Hanks warns the young escapee that if he wants to &#65533;blow&#65533; his secure job for a cheap thrill of escaping once again, he has fifty years/time waiting for him; a warning to the wise (and unwise), for Caprio/Abagnale for once goes where common sense beckons: to a bright future, catching more thieves, and, more importantly, inventing security devices for banks. That has netted him millions.

The title implies a bouncy cat and mouse thriller, which to some degree, it is.  But it is just as much a character study of a forger/con artist and his pursuer, a dogged treasury agent.  There is a somber tone to the film that suggests that the con artist, Frank Abignale Jr., is not so content with the choices he has made despite the apparent riches of his profession.  In contrast, the agent, Carl Hanratty, is equally lonely as a result of a recent divorce, which is probably why he plunges himself so wholeheartedly in his work.  As Frank Jr., this may be the best work that Leonardo DiCaprio has ever done.  As Agent Hanratty, Tom Hanks imbues the character with steely determination and dignity where the character could just as well have been portrayed as a bumbler.

605113,A103KNDW8GN92L,B00005JLSB,David Hugaert,"[0, 0]","""Catch Me If You Can"" is one motion picture which asks one question in particular: If you were to toss a (bank or cashier's) check on the floor, would it bounce, or would it make a soft thud, and remain motionless afterward? As to the answer to the above two-part question, both aftermaths are correct...well...sort of. Although this is a motion picture which features a fine main and supporting cast (featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen in adequate roles), the film's plot seems to drag in certain places, making some scenes appear to be both drawn-out and boring (the ""thuds""). Overall, the main theme for the most part makes for an interesting teleplay between DiCaprio's and Walken's main characters (one of a number of ""bounces""). In this film, Walken portrays a ""freelancer"" named Frank Abagnale, Sr., who, in the past, was charged with tax evasion, leaving him in severe financial dire straits, amounting to a huge debt. His son Frank Jr. (DiCaprio) contrives on a scheme to cover his father's financial losses, so he cooks up a batch of fake identities, ranging from a doctor to a co-pilot (including everything in between) and writes several bad checks in the process (yet more ""bounces"". Get it? A virtual play on words!) FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (played by Tom Hanks) is assigned this case, and the wheels are set in motion. Agent Hanratty does everything in his power to attempt to catch this clever teenaged fugitive, but it seems as if he gets closer and closer to catching the forgerer, DiCaprio's character is criss-crossing the country. The few minor perks as to how the forgerer changes identities in this movie are quite amusing and hilarious (which I won't reveal for spoiler's sake), and these are essential to the film's main storyline, which makes ""Catch Me If You Can"" a mostly fluid and interesting movie, to say the least. However, due to the fact this is a two hour and twenty minute feature, means that some scenes appear to be tedious and tiresome, making the storyline hard to follow in certain places. But, Steven Spielberg should be given the utmost credit for making the directorial (and theatrical) aspect of this movie work. Despite some of the above minor inconveniences, this is a film that's definitely worth checking out, so be sure and ""catch it if you can"" (either at your local theater or soon to be released on VHS or DVD format) today!",4,The fine art of check forging...,1041120000,"12 29, 2002",2002,2415,"['Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'one', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'question', 'particular', 'were', 'toss', 'bank', 'cashier', 'check', 'floor', 'would', 'bounce', 'would', 'make', 'soft', 'thud', 'remain', 'motionless', 'afterward', 'answer', 'above', 'two-part', 'question', 'aftermaths', 'are', 'correct', 'well', 'sort', 'motion', 'picture', 'fine', 'main', 'supporting', 'cast', 'featuring', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'adequate', 'roles', 'film', 'plot', 'drag', 'certain', 'places', 'making', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'drawn-out', 'boring', 'thuds', 'Overall', 'main', 'theme', 'most', 'part', 'interesting', 'teleplay', 'DiCaprio', 'Walken', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'number', 'bounces', 'film', 'Walken', 'freelancer', 'named', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Sr.', 'who', 'past', 'was', 'charged', 'tax', 'evasion', 'leaving', 'severe', 'financial', 'dire', 'straits', 'amounting', 'huge', 'debt', 'son', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'DiCaprio', 'scheme', 'cover', 'father', 'financial', 'losses', 'up', 'batch', 'fake', 'identities', 'ranging', 'doctor', 'co-pilot', 'including', 'everything', 'several', 'bad', 'checks', 'process', 'yet', 'more', 'bounces', 'Get', 'virtual', 'play', 'words', 'FBI', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'assigned', 'case', 'wheels', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'Agent', 'Hanratty', 'everything', 'power', 'attempt', 'catch', 'clever', 'teenaged', 'fugitive', 'closer', 'closer', 'catching', 'forgerer', 'DiCaprio', 'character', 'criss-crossing', 'country', 'few', 'minor', 'perks', 'how', 'forgerer', 'changes', 'identities', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'amusing', 'hilarious', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'spoiler', 'sake', 'are', 'essential', 'film', 'main', 'storyline', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'mostly', 'fluid', 'interesting', 'movie', 'say', 'least', 'However', 'due', 'fact', 'two', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minute', 'feature', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'tedious', 'tiresome', 'making', 'storyline', 'hard', 'follow', 'certain', 'places', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'utmost', 'credit', 'making', 'directorial', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'movie', 'work', 'above', 'minor', 'inconveniences', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'catch', 'can', 'local', 'theater', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'format', 'today']",Catch Me If You Can
605114,A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ,B00005JLSB,David M. Lovin,"[0, 0]","After a couple of heavyweight superdramas in the 90's (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), Steven Spielberg gives us this real life portrait of Frank Abegnale, Jr, a young man from a broken home who managed to elude the FBI for years and write millions of dollars in bogus checks.  The real Frank Abegnale was on hand as a consultant to make sure events were accurate.Interesting how this movie is done.  Spielberg starts out by showing us Frank in a prison in France, obviously caught for something.  We learn what that is very quickly, but we know from the start that Frank's journey will eventually leave him behind bars.  From there we see him as a young man being raised by his parents in New York, and we see where he gets the ability to impersonate.  After a school bully runs him into some lockers, he walks into a French class and seeing no teacher there, he begins instructing the class.  It just so happens that the bully is also part of the class.He's busted for that, and his father (Christopher Walken) is almost proud of his son's ability to lie.  Just wait.  From there, Frank becomes a pilot, lawyer, doctor, all with no experience, just an ability to fake ID badges and sweet talk people.  All the time, he is being chased by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) the agent who eventually gets him.So, does the story end there?  Not really.  The last act is an interesting one and ties the film up nicely.  This film is a bit overlong, but not dull at all, and will make you feel good in the end.  Overall, not nearly as effective as some of Spielberg's earlier work, but very good nonetheless and it has its place in my DVD case.",4,"A lighter, fluffier Spielberg",1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,1650,"['couple', 'heavyweight', 'superdramas', '90', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'real', 'life', 'portrait', 'Frank', 'Abegnale', 'Jr', 'young', 'man', 'broken', 'home', 'who', 'managed', 'elude', 'FBI', 'years', 'write', 'millions', 'dollars', 'bogus', 'checks', 'real', 'Frank', 'Abegnale', 'was', 'hand', 'consultant', 'make', 'sure', 'events', 'were', 'accurate.Interesting', 'how', 'movie', 'done', 'Spielberg', 'out', 'showing', 'Frank', 'prison', 'France', 'obviously', 'caught', 'something', 'learn', 'what', 'very', 'quickly', 'know', 'start', 'Frank', 'journey', 'will', 'eventually', 'leave', 'bars', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'being', 'raised', 'parents', 'New', 'York', 'see', 'where', 'ability', 'impersonate', 'school', 'bully', 'lockers', 'French', 'class', 'seeing', 'teacher', 'there', 'instructing', 'class', 'just', 'so', 'bully', 'also', 'part', 'class.He', 'busted', 'father', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'almost', 'proud', 'son', 'ability', 'lie', 'Just', 'wait', 'there', 'Frank', 'pilot', 'lawyer', 'doctor', 'experience', 'just', 'ability', 'fake', 'ID', 'badges', 'sweet', 'talk', 'people', 'time', 'being', 'chased', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'agent', 'who', 'eventually', 'him.So', 'story', 'end', 'there', 'Not', 'really', 'last', 'act', 'interesting', 'one', 'film', 'up', 'nicely', 'film', 'bit', 'overlong', 'not', 'dull', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'end', 'Overall', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'Spielberg', 'earlier', 'work', 'very', 'good', 'nonetheless', 'place', 'DVD', 'case']",Catch Me If You Can

605116,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00005JLSB,David Von Pein,"[3, 4]","Everything about Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a joy.  From the terrificly-retro John Williams musical score, to the fine acting performances, to the vibrant colors that saturate every scene in the film, to the clever animated title sequence, right on through to the enormously fine-tuned 1960s period detail that we see throughout the movie.The sets and the colors used in this film truly make you feel you're back in the mid-1960s.  I only caught one very small error in this ""period"" flavoring of the movie, and that is a short clip shown of a Boeing 767 jetliner landing. The 767 didn't first fly until 1981.  Everything else lands the viewer directly in the middle of the '60s.The story of one of the granddaddies of all check-forgers, Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., is told here by Mr. Spielberg at a very brisk and viewer-friendly pace; and, even though the picture clocks in at a fairly-lengthy 2 hours and 21 minutes, it never becomes tedious or wears out its welcome.  It seems fresh at every turn.A marvelous film with brilliant attention to period detail, and a first-rate DVD to boot!  The 2-Disc DVD features multiple featurettes on the making of the film, with an ample dose of information provided by Mr. Spielberg himself.I love the ""look"" and the feel of this film, and the way Director Spielberg uses his camera to tell the story...such as utilizing a high overhead shot looking down on a crowded street teeming with people, one of which is our subject, Mr. Abagnale, who stands out significantly by his merely donning his newly-acquired bright white Pan Am pilot's cap. ... There's another scene where Spielberg chooses to frame his actor (Tom Hanks) in the upper right corner of the screen, shooting him while we gaze over the shoulder of another actor in the foreground. ... And another grandiose Spielberg-like moment comes in the corridor of a fancy hotel, where nothing but the turning of a shoe tells the desire of a would-be femme fatale.And the video transfer to disc is eye-popping!  The colors are very bold and lifelike. Just perfect.This DVD offers three different Main Menus, based on each of the three primary ""fake occupations"" that Mr. Abagnale engages in.""Catch Me If You Can"", the movie and the DVD, is a class act all the way.",5,Don't Let This DVD Outrun You...Catch It Now!,1060992000,"08 16, 2003",2003,2272,"['Everything', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'joy', 'terrificly-retro', 'John', 'Williams', 'musical', 'score', 'fine', 'acting', 'performances', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'saturate', 'scene', 'film', 'clever', 'animated', 'title', 'sequence', 'right', 'enormously', 'fine-tuned', '1960s', 'period', 'detail', 'see', 'movie.The', 'sets', 'colors', 'used', 'film', 'truly', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'back', 'mid-1960s', 'only', 'caught', 'one', 'very', 'small', 'error', 'period', 'flavoring', 'movie', 'short', 'clip', 'shown', 'Boeing', '767', 'jetliner', 'landing', '767', 'did', ""n't"", 'first', 'fly', '1981', 'Everything', 'else', 'viewer', 'directly', 'middle', ""'60s.The"", 'story', 'one', 'granddaddies', 'check-forgers', 'Frank', 'W.', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'told', 'here', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'very', 'brisk', 'viewer-friendly', 'pace', 'even', 'picture', 'fairly-lengthy', '2', 'hours', '21', 'minutes', 'never', 'tedious', 'out', 'welcome', 'fresh', 'turn.A', 'marvelous', 'film', 'brilliant', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'first-rate', 'DVD', 'boot', '2-Disc', 'DVD', 'multiple', 'featurettes', 'making', 'film', 'ample', 'dose', 'information', 'provided', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'love', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'way', 'Director', 'Spielberg', 'camera', 'tell', 'story', 'such', 'utilizing', 'high', 'overhead', 'shot', 'looking', 'down', 'crowded', 'street', 'teeming', 'people', 'one', 'subject', 'Mr.', 'Abagnale', 'who', 'out', 'significantly', 'merely', 'donning', 'newly-acquired', 'bright', 'white', 'Pan', 'Am', 'pilot', 'cap', 'scene', 'where', 'Spielberg', 'frame', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'upper', 'right', 'corner', 'screen', 'shooting', 'gaze', 'shoulder', 'actor', 'foreground', 'grandiose', 'Spielberg-like', 'moment', 'corridor', 'fancy', 'hotel', 'where', 'nothing', 'turning', 'shoe', 'desire', 'would-be', 'femme', 'fatale.And', 'video', 'transfer', 'disc', 'eye-popping', 'colors', 'are', 'very', 'bold', 'lifelike', 'Just', 'perfect.This', 'DVD', 'three', 'different', 'Main', 'Menus', 'based', 'three', 'primary', 'fake', 'occupations', 'Mr.', 'Abagnale', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'movie', 'DVD', 'class', 'act', 'way']",Catch Me If You Can
605117,A3K7WDRNIMB49W,B00005JLSB,"D. Bell ""Imzadi""","[0, 1]","I am not and have never been a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I must admit that he did a good job conveying the inner workings of the mind of Frank Abignale, who was started on the path to being ""The Great Pretender"" by a football-playing jerk as he went from his exclusive Prep school to a public school.  He very successfully posed as the substitute French teacher and, from all accounts, did a very good job at it until they caught him.  When his family broke up, he was on his own and living by his wits.  He did a great job of it, too, including passing the Louisiana State Bar Exam, especially considering his youth, which makes me assume his IQ was extremely high.Tom Hanks is the Javert (or Lt. Gerard) to DiCaprio's Jean Valjean (or Richard Kimble), obsessed with capturing this fraud artist.  I thought he took it too seriously and, to be honest, I did not like him for about 3/4 of the movie.  Too many of the attempts to capture Abignale were pure overkill.  He had never been at all violent nor had physically harmed anyone, yet on several occasions hordes of armed men attempted (and failed) to capture him.  When he was finally incarcerated, no one took into account the total lack of violence that surrounded his career.Of the supporting players, Christopher Walken was sympathetic, even pathetic, as Frank's father who cannot face reality and is the primary cause of Frank's life of crime.  I did not find Martin Sheen at all believable as Frank's fiancee's father.  My husband thought Frank's mother was a witch, but I found some sympathy for a woman married to a loser who refused to try to help himself so she made a new happier life, although I can't forgive her infidelity to her husband while they were still married.This film is much more reminiscent of the television show The Pretender than of Les Miserables or The Fugitive.

605118,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JLSB,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[23, 31]","The trailers and the graphics used to promote &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; make this movie seem like a light-hearted, cartoonish chase movie, but it's much more serious than that.  Director Spielberg delves into the psychology of a real-life con artist and impersonator, teenager Frank Abagnole Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who runs away from a broken home and must rely on his wits, albeit illegally, to keep himself afloat.  As Frank's cons get more and more bold and skilled, the FBI agent on his tail, Hanratty (Tom Hanks), scrambles to outwit him.  The two form a unique relationship of the hunter and the chased, with Frank toying with Hanratty in scene after scene. What Frank doesn't expect is to find the love of his life and a close-knit family so unlike his own that he wants to remain in their midst.The best performances are the smaller supporting roles:  Christopher Walken as Frank Sr. and Martin Sheen as Frank Jr.'s father-in-law.  Di Caprio does a solid job with his part as a baby-faced, sweet-talking impersonator, but he rarely lets the complicated emotions surface.  Likewise, Tom Hanks is good as the agent obsessed with capturing Frank, but he doesn't add any magic to the role.  The soundtrack, with its cartoonish chase theme, helps lighten the film.&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is a cross between &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Matchstick Men.&quot;  Frank's scams are often comically clever, but there is a dark underside to his story.  Its the darkness that creates the bond between Frank and the audience, as it's difficult not to feel for a young man who feels unloved and powerless.

605119,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005JLSB,Deborah Earle,"[1, 4]","At the time of this stylish thriller's release in the theatres, a reformed Frank Abagnale spoke at a university in the town where I live. The subject of hs discussion was protection against fraud.While I was unable to attend that lecture, I did have the pleasure of watching Stephen Spielberg's interpretation of his earlier life on the big screen, and while the film dragged in some areas, and was inconsistant with the book on which it was based, it was entertaining.Leonardo Di Caprio plays the young Frank, who sees his once tranquil home life shatter as his father(Christopher Walken in a performance worthy of the Oscar nonimation he received for it) falls on hard times, and his glamourous, wartime child-bride French mother(Nathalie Baye) responds to their decline in status by having an affair with her husband's smug best friend (James Brolin).In real-life, Frank had four siblings, and their responses to the break-up of their parents' marriage would have provided an interesting facet to the story had they been included. In truth, Frank's father was an honest man who made the mistake of letting his namesake get away with one illegal stunt, which helped get the ball rolling as far as Frank's life of crime was concerned, and there was a difference of a few years between the time of the Abagnale's separation and divorce.This fast-paced film speeds along to the beginning of Frank's life of crime after he runs away from home, but keeps jumping ahead periodically to the end of his incarceration in France, and his escort home by the no-nonsense Fed, Carl Handratty, an actual composite character, played by a rather blank Tom Hanks with a Bostonian accent.The film captures the look and feel of the 60s in the  fashionable colors, costumes, make-up, pillbox hats, and hair-dos, a well as in the naivete of those who Frank cons along the way. One supposes that the vast array of international crimes he committed have helped to make the world a more cynical place, however he may work to atone for them.We follow his adventures in passing himself off as a pilot, a doctor, and attorney, and feel irritation when Handratty fails at his first attempt to catch him, although Frank's slickness in talking his way out of an arrest is amusing.Jennifer Garner has a cameo as a pin-up girl turned call girl as she recreates an incident that actually took place at a Governor's mansion instead of a swank hotel. Her half-smile as she asks Frank how much he would pay if she were beings sold downstairs speaks volumes about how far she's fallen in life.Kudos must be given to John Williams' musical score which is hip, snazzy, and highly reminiscent of the music that accompanied many a 1960s spy and/or detective flick. There is something comical about that recurring note pattern played whenever Hanratty hits on a major clue that brings him further to catching his unsub.The Christmastime phone calls between Frank and Carl never took place. But they symbolized the lonliness and desire for connection Abagnale described.We reach a significant moment in the story when Frank meets Brenda Strong (a vulnerable Amy Adams)at a hospital in Atlanta, and passes himself off as a doctor. As he begins to spend time with her, he learns the young candy striper has been estranged from her parents in Louisiana, after they forced her to terminate a pregnancy.To improve her standing with her parents and elude capture from the police, our young con artist decides to ""become"" a lawyer after dining with the Strongs (Martin Sheen and Nancy Lenehan)  settles in with them for a while and proposes to Brenda. He is deeply moved by the Strong's closeness as a couple.There is one more meeting with his own father, and one more Christmastime phone call before Handratty and his men re-fuel the chase, forcing the young con-artist to leave behind a devastated Brenda the night of their engagement party.Fleeing to Florida, he waits for Brenda to join him as she promised when he fled. But when it appears that she is part of a sting operation, Frank drives away and cooks up the most impressive of his schemes when he recruits students from a Women's College into a phony stewardess training program, and dressed once again in his pilot's uniform, goes through the airport's lobby undetected by the Feds who are too distracted by the pretty girls to notice their man. I had to admit it was a riot when Frank's plane takes off just in time for Handratty and his men to realize that they had just missed him. It's the most fun scene in the movie!Eventually, the long arm of the law catches up to Frank and the scenes of his last moments of freedom are filled with pathos.The film ignores his incarceration in Sweden, but recreates  his last attempt to escape before doing time in an American prison, although not altogether accurately. But his recoiling from the image of his mother's new life, in which she appears to have erased all traces of her previous one is indelible.Gradually, the young inmate displays his talent for detecting fraudulent checks, much to the delight of his captors.The ex-convict who stood before an audience at my alma mater  had raised three sons who were very well-behaved largely because they couldn't have pulled any stunts that their father hadn't already invented.This one-time ""prodigal son"" wanted those in attendance of his lecture to know that he didn't want them to walk away envying him his experiences because there was also a lot of despair in his life on the run. He would prefer to be remembered for having turned his life around and raised a fine family, proving that even the least desirable characters can change.",4,A Sinner Who Changes His

He worships no one so much as his own father, although the images Frank JR glimpses through his rose-colored glasses aren't so much reality as they are the landscape his father has created for him to see.So, when his parents split early on in the movie, after his father's troubles with the IRS finally bring their family finances crashing down, Frank Jr is asked to choose--his mother or his father, and it's an impossible choice (which any child of divorced parents certainly feels in this moving scene.)  Frank's choice? He takes off running, hence the title and it's initial confrontation, though Frank's as haunted and hounded by FBI Agent Henratti (sp?), played by Tom Hanks as he is his heartbreaking childhood.Frank proceeds to run from one end of America to the other, criss-crossing in a trail of bank fraud, check kiting and the like (he's a ""paper hanger"", in the words of Hanks' character.)But as the story unfolds, and it's certainly great entertainment to watch DiCaprio's Abagnale foil society, financial instituions and school bullies, it's as much about the elusive things he's running *toward* as the past he's running from.

It's simply a lot of fun--a great story, well told--and succeeds on almost every level that film attempts. The characters are multi-dimensional, intriguing and all sympathetic; the pacing is seat-of-the-pants; the direction is artful, but never at the expense of the story; the music another gem from John Williams (and uncharacteristic of his normal brassy fare); the acting is superb (and I hope that given this, The Aviator, and others that people will finally admit the sizable talent of the often unfairly hated DiCaprio); and the plot is a gem.One aspect that I love is how DiCaprio's character is an awful con-man, reprehensible by every measure, and yet is just so very daring and intelligent that he demands our respect and admiration (and, sometimes, jealousy). Also, in his relationships with his parents (featuring a great turn by the normally out-of-control Christopher Walken), the policeman chasing him, his would-be wife and others, we see the real human being, inside, his dreams, hopes and failures. In the end, we care.Finally, the movie gets style points for its retro-60's opening sequence and theme, and the subtle points that you may just miss on a first viewing (for instance, DiCaprio tracing handcuffs while talking on the phone to the police).

Perhaps it's because Abagnale is so carefree, so youthful, and so exuberant, and thus appeals to that almost innocent youthfulness that never fully leaves us, no matter how old we are.

This is based on the real life story of the life of Frank Abagnale, Jr.  A con man who impersonated an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer, all before the age of 21.  He came by it honestly because his father was a businessman and con artist, who helped teach him everything he knew.Leonardo DiCaprio is boyishly handsome, engaging and diabolical as Frank Abagnale, Jr.  Due to an unfortunate turn of events in his life (which I won't elaborate on, to spoil the plot), the young man turns to a life of pulling con job after con job, at just age sixteen.  Not only does he manage to make close to $2.5 million, but he finds love, fame and notoreity in the public eye, all the while eluding the advances of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI investigator hot on his trail.This film is intelligent, original and just superb (from the very engaging title credits, down to the intriguing conclusion).

605142,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00005JLSB,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[2, 2]","Being a stickler for realism, the coming attractions of this movie had no appeal for me as I beheld the boyish face Leonardo Decaprio in a Pan Am uniform of a first officer, knowing intimately that gray hair and a cane was almost a prerequisite for that airline's cockpit personnel. Imagine my surprise as the story came to TV and I found myself enjoying one scene after another.Decaprio plays, Frank Abagnale Jr., a modern day Ferdinand Waldo Demara, with a twist. He makes emotional attachments along the way as he starts conning and defrauding very early in life, at about the same time that his father and mother start to separate.Chasing Frank is a stuffy, Catholic, typical, white-shirted FBI Agent named Carl Hanratty who seems outwitted by his prey at every turn, as he comes up one step behind. Frank's greatest caper, along with passing forged Pan Am checks is puddle-jumping on other airlines while pretending to be a Pan Am pilot. Ever the ladies' man he meets stewardesses and hookers whom he cons as if it is was the most natural thing in the world. But our Frank isn't content with being a mere pilot.Faking diplomas from Harvard, he passes himself off as a doctor where he works in a hospital emergency room directing other interns to take care of the patients. Just to round out his curriculum vitae, he decides it would be nice to be a lawyer as he woos a prosecutor's daughter. With two weeks of study, he passes the bar exam in Louisiana. The only problem is that darned FBI agent Hanratty won't give up coming after him.He seems to be the perfect candidate for a psychopath. His happy home is broken by his father's financial and business misfortune, His mother leaves his father for the father's lawyer, and Frank takes pity on the father who thinks the government is after him for everything. It is obvious he worships a man who is a failure, but still does everything he can to gain his approval.Steven Spielberg's direction is as upbeat as the movie's tempo and dialogue. The viewer may develop a fondness for the pursuer and the pursued. There is a happy ending for both of them.The real Frank Abagnale had a cameo appearance in this movie, playing one of the French police that captured Abignale in France.The End (almost)Sometimes real life turns out to be even more interesting than the fiction, and this was no different. I was more than interested in the man who reminded me of ""The Great Imposter,"" Ferdinand Waldo Demara.The real Frank Abagnale Jr. made his first con against his father. He asked his father for a credit card so he could date the many women he admired. In order to get the cash, he used the card, told the garage to keep the batteries, sets of tires and gasoline, resell them, and give him cash.He served time in more jails than is shown in the movie. He served time in Sweden, six months in French jails and a few years in federal penitentiaries where he escaped from one pretending to be a prison inspector.In addition to being a ""doctor"" and ""lawyer,"" Frank faked credentials to gain a teaching assistant job at Columbia University in New York.Frank's fortune changed after he was fired from one job after another when a background check revealed his prison record. He approached one bank with an offer. He would give them a lecture on detecting bank fraud. They wouldn't have to pay him if they didn't like it. If they did, they would pay him $500 AND tell other banks about his work. He ended up making millions.He currently lives and works in Tulsa, OK, and is still good friends with Special Agent Joe Shaye (known in the movie as Carl Hanratty).",5,Catch This Movie if You Can,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,3603,"['Being', 'stickler', 'realism', 'coming', 'attractions', 'movie', 'had', 'appeal', 'beheld', 'boyish', 'face', 'Leonardo', 'Decaprio', 'Pan', 'Am', 'uniform', 'first', 'officer', 'knowing', 'intimately', 'gray', 'hair', 'cane', 'was', 'almost', 'prerequisite', 'airline', 'cockpit', 'personnel', 'Imagine', 'surprise', 'story', 'came', 'TV', 'found', 'enjoying', 'one', 'scene', 'another.Decaprio', 'plays', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'modern', 'day', 'Ferdinand', 'Waldo', 'Demara', 'twist', 'emotional', 'attachments', 'way', 'conning', 'defrauding', 'very', 'early', 'life', 'same', 'time', 'father', 'mother', 'start', 'separate.Chasing', 'Frank', 'stuffy', 'Catholic', 'typical', 'white-shirted', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'named', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'who', 'outwitted', 'prey', 'turn', 'up', 'one', 'step', 'behind', 'Frank', 'greatest', 'caper', 'passing', 'forged', 'Pan', 'Am', 'checks', 'puddle-jumping', 'other', 'airlines', 'pretending', 'be', 'Pan', 'Am', 'pilot', 'Ever', 'ladies', 'man', 'stewardesses', 'hookers', 'whom', 'was', 'most', 'natural', 'thing', 'world', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'content', 'being', 'mere', 'pilot.Faking', 'diplomas', 'Harvard', 'off', 'doctor', 'where', 'hospital', 'emergency', 'room', 'directing', 'other', 'interns', 'take', 'care', 'patients', 'Just', 'round', 'out', 'curriculum', 'vitae', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'be', 'lawyer', 'prosecutor', 'daughter', 'two', 'weeks', 'study', 'bar', 'exam', 'Louisiana', 'only', 'problem', 'darned', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Hanratty', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'coming', 'him.He', 'be', 'perfect', 'candidate', 'psychopath', 'happy', 'home', 'broken', 'father', 'financial', 'business', 'misfortune', 'mother', 'father', 'father', 'lawyer', 'Frank', 'pity', 'father', 'who', 'government', 'everything', 'obvious', 'man', 'who', 'failure', 'still', 'everything', 'can', 'gain', 'approval.Steven', 'Spielberg', 'direction', 'as', 'upbeat', 'movie', 'tempo', 'dialogue', 'viewer', 'may', 'develop', 'fondness', 'pursuer', 'pursued', 'happy', 'ending', 'them.The', 'real', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'had', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'movie', 'playing', 'one', 'French', 'police', 'captured', 'Abignale', 'France.The', 'End', 'almost', 'Sometimes', 'real', 'life', 'out', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'fiction', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'man', 'who', 'reminded', 'Great', 'Imposter', 'Ferdinand', 'Waldo', 'Demara.The', 'real', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'made', 'first', 'con', 'father', 'asked', 'father', 'credit', 'card', 'could', 'date', 'many', 'women', 'admired', 'order', 'get', 'cash', 'used', 'card', 'told', 'garage', 'keep', 'batteries', 'sets', 'tires', 'gasoline', 'resell', 'give', 'cash.He', 'served', 'time', 'more', 'jails', 'shown', 'movie', 'served', 'time', 'Sweden', 'six', 'months', 'French', 'jails', 'few', 'years', 'federal', 'penitentiaries', 'where', 'escaped', 'one', 'pretending', 'be', 'prison', 'inspector.In', 'addition', 'being', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'Frank', 'faked', 'credentials', 'gain', 'teaching', 'assistant', 'job', 'Columbia', 'University', 'New', 'York.Frank', 'fortune', 'changed', 'was', 'fired', 'one', 'job', 'when', 'background', 'check', 'revealed', 'prison', 'record', 'approached', 'one', 'bank', 'offer', 'would', 'give', 'lecture', 'detecting', 'bank', 'fraud', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', 'would', 'pay', '500', 'AND', 'tell', 'other', 'banks', 'work', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'millions.He', 'currently', 'Tulsa', 'OK', 'still', 'good', 'friends', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Joe', 'Shaye', 'known', 'movie', 'Carl', 'Hanratty']",Catch Me If You Can

605146,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00005JLSB,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 1]","The story is true. Frank Abagnale Jr. was a young man who, before turning 21, forged numerous checks and became one of the biggest con men in the United States. Catch Me If You Can is, of course, loosely based on his life and work, but it's still entertaining and fascinating to watch. Normally, I'm not a fan of Spielberg, but he's done a really good job with recreating the 50's and 60's. The costume and set designers should be given equal credit with their excellent work. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a believable performance as Abagnale himself, while Tom Hanks is brilliant as the Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who is willing to stop this man from creating more fake checks and assuming more fake identities. Christopher Walken does what he does best, even if he doesn't seem to fit the role as Frank's father. Nathalie Baye as Frank's mother is very convincing, probably even more convincing than DiCaprio. Martin Sheen is also a nice addition to the supporting cast.Keep in mind, though, that this is not a serious hard-hitting biography, but rather, a comedy-drama that doesn't really take itself seriously. It's good for laughs, and it does its job well. The only problem is that it's a bit too long, and it could have been slightly shortened.

Not that I was expecting it to be horrible, but I definitely was not expecting anything truly entertaining. I am not much of a Leonardo diCaprio fan, so I am skeptical anytime I see one of his films. However, he did very well in his role, and conveyed both the excitement and anxiety of being someone in his position (pretending and always on the run to be one step ahead of the law).

605148,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B00005JLSB,Erik North,"[6, 6]","CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, the latest opus so far from the cinema's greatest living director Steven Spielberg, is a highly inventive crime caper movie based on real life.Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Frank Abagnale, a kid from Long Island who ran away from a broken home and worked his way to riches by impersonating everyone from airline pilots to doctors to lawyers and forging checks to the tune of $4 million during a three-year spree in the 1960s.  Tom Hanks, reliable as always, portrays Carl Hanratty, the FBI man hot on his trail from coast to coast who eventually tracks him down in France.  The process by which DiCaprio is able to manage not only to forge checks but also his own identity is done with considerable wit and humor; and the cat-and-mouse game between him and Hanks closely resembles Hitchcock at his prime.Spielberg obviously identified with Abagnale and his saga, since the director himself told some pretty tall tails in his youth to break into Hollywood, including lying about his age.  As a result, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, like a lot of Spielberg's work, has a deep personal resonance to it.  But Spielberg also devotes time to Hanks' FBI agent's dilligence in pursuing the elusive Abagnale.  The film's witty title sequence, made to look like the film itself was actually made in the early 1960s, and John Williams' jazzy score (in the manner of Henry Mancini's great film scores from the 60s), prove to be the icing on the cake.Long and deliberately paced but never dull, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of the best films of 2002, and yet another great movie in the Spielberg canon.",5,Making A Dishonest Living,1041033600,"12 28, 2002",2002,1596,"['CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'latest', 'opus', 'so', 'far', 'cinema', 'greatest', 'living', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'highly', 'inventive', 'crime', 'caper', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'life.Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'kid', 'Long', 'Island', 'who', 'ran', 'away', 'broken', 'home', 'worked', 'way', 'riches', 'impersonating', 'everyone', 'airline', 'pilots', 'doctors', 'lawyers', 'forging', 'checks', 'tune', '4', 'million', 'three-year', 'spree', '1960s', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'reliable', 'always', 'portrays', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'FBI', 'man', 'hot', 'trail', 'coast', 'coast', 'who', 'eventually', 'down', 'France', 'process', 'DiCaprio', 'able', 'manage', 'not', 'only', 'forge', 'checks', 'also', 'own', 'identity', 'done', 'considerable', 'wit', 'humor', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'Hanks', 'closely', 'Hitchcock', 'prime.Spielberg', 'obviously', 'identified', 'Abagnale', 'saga', 'director', 'told', 'pretty', 'tall', 'tails', 'youth', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'including', 'lying', 'age', 'result', 'CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'lot', 'Spielberg', 'work', 'deep', 'personal', 'resonance', 'Spielberg', 'also', 'time', 'Hanks', 'FBI', 'agent', 'dilligence', 'pursuing', 'elusive', 'Abagnale', 'film', 'witty', 'title', 'sequence', 'made', 'look', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'made', 'early', '1960s', 'John', 'Williams', 'jazzy', 'score', 'manner', 'Henry', 'Mancini', 'great', 'film', 'scores', '60s', 'prove', 'be', 'icing', 'cake.Long', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'never', 'dull', 'CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2002', 'yet', 'great', 'movie', 'Spielberg', 'canon']",Catch Me If You Can

But, the reproaches that could be made to his precedent movies, the extravagance and the Hollywood tendency from these projects, are no longer there. With `Catch me if you can', we can see another facet of Steven Spielberg. He tends to be just like a young director whose exploring new approaches, but with a lot of experience: the cast is perfect, the cinematographer is very good and the well trained compositor (John Williams) has the intelligence of producing new themes.Where Spielberg hit the point is in his total mastering of the Abagnale / Hanratty pursuit which, instead of being made in an epileptic manner, works more on the psychological level of the relationship. This pursuit shows the research of a missing father by a missed child who has no other way to prove his existence than to play with the law. Di Caprio shows, once again, his abilities to act the different facets of the tormented teenager, even if for an actor who is almost in his thirties it's maybe the time to change.

Abagnale Jr. doesn't come across as an inveterate rogue--he is cold-blooded, but not a mean bastard (unlike Mr. Ripley, for instance.) Why are we on his side? Maybe because he does more harm to the system (that we probably wouldn't mind getting screwed sometimes) than to defenseless individuals, to whom he is actually quite considerate.

I have read Mr. Abagnales book and it is truly an amazing story. The screenwriter did a very good job of turning what could have been just one escapade after another into a thoughtful story of a young, smart, highly sensitive boy who was traumatized by his parents divorce, ran away when forced to choose between his two parents, and got caught up in a web of deception which took on a life of its own. Spielberg had to leave a lot of the details of the story out of the movie in order to more fully explore the motivations of the characters.

605175,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JLSB,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 5]","In this film Steven Spielberg wants to entertain us with a simple plot, a simple situation, a great chase around the world. He wants to entertain us with two characters who are highly attractive. The young man who becomes a criminal because his father is harrassed by the IRS and whose wife is stolen away by his best friend can easily become a symbol of fighting back, resilience, rebellion, intelligence against a system that tries to crush all those who may be antisocial, or just appear to be antisocial. The second character of the cop who is chasing this young man is just as attractive. Divorced, having lost wife and daughter, abandoned and isolated in his personal life, living the life of a hermit, of a monk of the law against crime, he easily becomes a father substitute to the young man and chases him with real paternal care and even maybe love. This relation between the criminal and the cop is amazingly reassuring. The young criminal becomes a hero because he attacks the economic system and is more intelligent than the businessmen and CEOs of this system. The cop becomes a hero because he is not viciously chasing a criminal he is ready to kill if necessary, but he chases him to protect him against his own desire to fool the system, and to give him the opportunity to really become  social  by using his talent and his intelligence against the criminals who attack the system. This will lead me to the conclusion on this point : this film is in a way a denunciation of the economic and political system that tries to destroy its opponents by all means available, including in their private life, due to a total lack of ethics on the side of the proponents of this system. Why does our system produce such a phenomenal highjacking of intelligence into crime ? But the film also has another interest. Leonardo Di Caprio reveals himself as able to impersonate many characters and personalities in this film and this is the proof that he is improving and developing. He is able to become, in the near future, a good and even great actor, provided his body and face are put aside and his acting talent is emphasized.

605179,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B00005JLSB,Jason N. Mical,"[22, 25]","Steven Spielburg's second 2002 film is a dinosaur.  It's an anachronism.  It belongs to the time period in which it's set, a more innocent America where Charles Manson had not brought violence to the wealthy and Vietnam was still a winnable (and profitable) war.  It's Catch Me If You Can, the story of con man Frank Abagnale, Jr., who may very well be the world's foremost expert on forgery and fraud.  If that doesn't sound like a complimentary introduction, fear not; Catch Me a film's film and a throwback to the cinema of yore, when audio and video combined to make an experience rather than an assault on the senses.Imagine a mixture of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and To Catch a Thief.  Catch Me has the slow pacing and careful cinematography of Hitchcock at his finest, and Spielburg has forsaken his recent effects-laden shots for straightforward storytelling.  Every individual shot is deliberately framed, with a care for detail not usually seen outside of a Lynch film.  There are no explosions to distract the eye from character interaction, and the overall effect is that of an effortless and immersive film.Leonardo DiCaprio, in one of his best (and best-developed) roles since Gilbert Grape, plays Frank Abagnale, a teenager growing up outside of New York.  His father (played by Christopher Walken) is being investigated by the IRS, and Frank Jr.'s idyllic American life full of apple pie, WWII vets marrying their sweethearts, and large-finned cars is about to come crashing down.  When he finds that what he's left with isn't to his liking, Frank embarks on a career of impersonation and fraud.  He passes himself off as an airline pilot, a Harvard-educated doctor, an assistant prosecutor, and a recruiter for an airline stewardess program - all before his 19th birthday.  When he starts passing bad checks - to the tune of four million dollars - he attracts the attention of straightlaced FBI Agent Tom Hanks, who manages to avoid his Hanks persona in favor of actual acting.Catch Me is a character story, told through a series of events in Abagnale's life.  It's funny at times, but the portrait that develops is of a sad, lonely, and almost pathetic child who runs and hides because he doesn't know what else to do.  Hanks is like an automaton, relentless in his pursuit, and his grip on Abagnale only grows tighter with each narrow escape.  It's not a deep meditation on a philosophical subject, or an artistic look at some overused postmodern clich&eacute;.  Catch Me aims to entertain, nothing more, and succeeds admirably.Without effects, a blazing soundtrack, and fast-paced action to drive the story, Spielburg ekes the most from Hanks and DiCaprio without resorting to hammy overacting.  This, combined with the easygoing plot and fantastic camerawork, lend Catch Me an unusual amount of verisimilitude for a modern film: it's something to lose yourself in, where you no longer think ""I'm watching a movie.""  That is an accomplishment worthy of note.Final Grade: A-",5,A Throwback to an Earlier Time,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,2999,"['Steven', 'Spielburg', 'second', '2002', 'film', 'dinosaur', 'anachronism', 'time', 'period', 'set', 'more', 'innocent', 'America', 'where', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'had', 'not', 'brought', 'violence', 'wealthy', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'still', 'winnable', 'profitable', 'war', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'story', 'con', 'man', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'who', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'world', 'foremost', 'expert', 'forgery', 'fraud', ""n't"", 'sound', 'complimentary', 'introduction', 'fear', 'not', 'Catch', 'Me', 'film', 'film', 'throwback', 'cinema', 'yore', 'when', 'audio', 'video', 'combined', 'make', 'experience', 'rather', 'assault', 'senses.Imagine', 'mixture', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'Mad', 'World', 'Catch', 'Thief', 'Catch', 'Me', 'slow', 'pacing', 'careful', 'cinematography', 'Hitchcock', 'finest', 'Spielburg', 'forsaken', 'recent', 'effects-laden', 'shots', 'straightforward', 'storytelling', 'individual', 'shot', 'deliberately', 'framed', 'care', 'detail', 'not', 'usually', 'seen', 'Lynch', 'film', 'are', 'explosions', 'distract', 'eye', 'character', 'interaction', 'overall', 'effect', 'effortless', 'immersive', 'film.Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'one', 'best', 'best-developed', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'teenager', 'growing', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'father', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'being', 'investigated', 'IRS', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'idyllic', 'American', 'life', 'full', 'apple', 'pie', 'WWII', 'vets', 'marrying', 'sweethearts', 'large-finned', 'cars', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'When', 'what', 'left', ""n't"", 'liking', 'Frank', 'career', 'impersonation', 'fraud', 'off', 'airline', 'pilot', 'Harvard-educated', 'doctor', 'assistant', 'prosecutor', 'recruiter', 'airline', 'stewardess', 'program', '19th', 'birthday', 'When', 'passing', 'bad', 'checks', 'tune', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'attention', 'straightlaced', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'avoid', 'Hanks', 'persona', 'favor', 'actual', 'acting.Catch', 'Me', 'character', 'story', 'told', 'series', 'events', 'Abagnale', 'life', 'funny', 'times', 'portrait', 'sad', 'lonely', 'almost', 'pathetic', 'child', 'who', 'hides', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'do', 'Hanks', 'automaton', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'grip', 'Abagnale', 'only', 'tighter', 'narrow', 'escape', 'not', 'deep', 'meditation', 'philosophical', 'subject', 'artistic', 'look', 'overused', 'postmodern', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Catch', 'Me', 'aims', 'entertain', 'nothing', 'more', 'admirably.Without', 'effects', 'blazing', 'soundtrack', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'drive', 'story', 'Spielburg', 'most', 'Hanks', 'DiCaprio', 'resorting', 'hammy', 'overacting', 'combined', 'easygoing', 'plot', 'fantastic', 'camerawork', 'lend', 'Catch', 'Me', 'unusual', 'amount', 'verisimilitude', 'modern', 'film', 'something', 'lose', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'think', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movie', 'accomplishment', 'worthy', 'note.Final', 'Grade', 'A-']",Catch Me If You Can
605180,A2EY1BJK2ETC37,B00005JLSB,Jason W. Qualls,"[0, 0]","Based on the 1980 memoir by Frank Abagnale, this film follows most of the life of one of the most notorious impostors of all time. As Abagnale (played by the surprisingly amiable Leonardo DiCaprio) assumes the identities of various professionals such as an airline pilot, a lawyer, and a pediatrician, he's pursued by FBI detective Carl Hanratty (played by Tom Hanks and his ludicrously phony Boston accent).  Eventually, Abagnale is caught and, with the help of Hanratty, he sees the light and puts his gift of deceit to good use by helping the FBI crack future cases of con-artistry.Performances are adequate, at the least. DiCaprio consistently juggles between innocence and trickery, and he is both believable in the beginning as a 16-year-old and in the end as his character endures true adulthood. Most definitely his best performance since &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape?&quot; Two-time Oscar-winner Hanks definitely could have done better, considering his credentials as well as his past performances. It was by no shade of the imagination bad, though, and at times one almost forgets his absurd attempt at a dialect. Christopher Walken, though, probably delivers the best performance as Abagnale's emotionally struggling father, despite his limited screen-time.&quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; captures the candy-colored fantasy that was the '60s, but it's not free of at least some appropriately bleak moments.

He is a little boy lost who makes the best of things when his father (Christopher Walken, in one of his typically quirky and unique performances...is that guy crazy or what???)--the only hero he has--goes under finacially and emotionally. Walken is forced into giving up his house, business, and French war trophy chippy of a wife in one fell swoop all because of ""the damn IRS--they are after me all the time!"" he claims.The truth is, he overstretched himself, probably because his immigrant wife wanted a nice house, a Cadillac, all those things that Americans wanted in the post WWII years.When their little American dream is shattered, Leo has to choose between parents when the divorce papers are being signed. Unwilling to do this because he loves them both, he gets up and runs out of the house at the tender age of 16.  Making the best of things out on the street, he uses his wits to carve out a new life for himself, embellishing the con games his father taught him, bumping them up to a way larger scale. Vastly intelligent, he is able to figure out how to impersonate a pilot, a James Bondian glamor type with a ""little silver sports car"", a pediatrician and a lawyer all before the age of 19.He does it for the money, but more than that..he does it for his beloved, failing in health, ne'er do well, but good hearted dad. He is immature enough, for all his con man ways, to think that money can put his family back together again.  He wants his dad to get his mother back, so they can all return to the way things were.  In the long run, it turns out he is just a kid, a devoted son, who idolizes his father through thick and thin.So that is what drives Frank(Leo).What drives Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks, who generously ""gives"" the movie to Leo, which does them both a service in this case), the FBI agent who relentlessly and unglamorously pursues Frank throughout his conman career? Carl is driven by the emptiness at the core of his life, too.  His family is broken, just like Leo's. The two make quite a pair. Their relationship is understandable, and touching, as you will see.  All anyone wants is a little love I guess, and someone to come home to.

Overall, the movie's art-director deserves an award for the recreation of the 1960's style, complete with those bright monochrome shirts worth hundreds of dollars now.  The biggest award for this captivating story, though, snatched the real Frank Abagnale Jr. He did it through those bank fees we pay now every time we're forced to write a real check (whose security features he, very likely, helped design) instead of easily pasting one up from fancy stationary, decals and John Doe's surrender to the force of blinding looks. All of the above he managed to use himself running one of the greatest laser-printer-free scams of the 20th century that leaves our eyes wide open and our jaws dropped.  This movie is like a chess-game puzzle printed in a newspaper: we know who will win but we are intrigued by the strategy and the ultimate chase. It is never high-speed, but just like a chess-game, develops move by move. As viewers, we are more likely to side up with the con artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) than with his FBI hunter (Tom Hanks).  Abagnale Jr. doesn't come across as an inveterate rogue--he is cold-blooded, but not a mean bastard (unlike Mr. Ripley, for instance.) Why are we on his side? Maybe because he does more harm to the system (that we probably wouldn't mind getting screwed sometimes) than to defenseless individuals, to whom he is actually quite considerate.

And it's Hanks, working with the alacrity of Barnaby Jones and the acumen of Inspector Clousseau that's to blame. No recording devices, 3 agents at the party, no effective police backups, a literal crawl up the stairs at the party, a complete lack of aggressiveness, the ridiculous escape from Miami, all seem to point to a deliberate lengthening of the film.

605190,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JLSB,Joe Sherry,"[1, 3]","A Film by Steven SpielbergCatch Me If You Can is based on the 1980 memoir by Frank Abagnale.  We are told at the very beginning that this movie is inspired by the book, which means that there are changes in both the events of the book as well as the characters.  All this means is that the filmmakers chose to tell a slightly different story than was Abagnale presented in the book.  It doesn't make the movie any less truthful.This is the story of con man Frank Abagnale, Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio).  The movie starts with Abagnale in a French prison and being released into the custody of FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Throughout the film we switch back between Abagnale conning and running from the law to Abagnale and Hanratty talking on the plane.  It offers a nice change of pace as well as a continued questioning of how Abagnale got caught.We flash back to Abagnale before he leaves home.  He is devoted to his father (Christopher Walken), and is deeply hurt by the divorce and the court requirement that he make the choice of which parent he wants to live with.  Instead, Abagnale chooses neither and runs away to New York City.  Thus begins his life of the con (though there is a suggestion that he had been doing some check/credit card conning before he runs away).  Surprisingly, the movie strays from focusing on Frank Abagnale himself but spends just as much (or more) time on Carl Hanratty and the hunt to catch Abagnale.Hanratty is a somewhat geeky FBI Agent.  He is very serious and very devoted to his job of catching check frauds like Abagnale.  He is good at his job, but Abagnale leads Hanratty on a long chase over most of the country (and the world) before ending in France.  The film shows as Hanratty discovers more clues as to where Abagnale is, but never quite manages to catch up to him.  There is the yearly Christmas Eve phone call from Abagnale to Hanratty (because both end up alone on Christmas).We do get to see some of the cons that Frank Abagnale pulls off, but we never quite see his preparation or learn the reason why Abagnale is conning.  It takes something away from an otherwise excellent movie.I would recommend this movie as I thought it was quite good, but if I had to choose between Abagnale's book and the movie, I would take the book any day of the week.",4,excellent movie with great performances,1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,2306,"['Film', 'Steven', 'SpielbergCatch', 'Me', 'Can', 'based', '1980', 'memoir', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'are', 'told', 'very', 'beginning', 'movie', 'inspired', 'book', 'are', 'changes', 'events', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'filmmakers', 'chose', 'tell', 'slightly', 'different', 'story', 'was', 'Abagnale', 'presented', 'book', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'less', 'truthful.This', 'story', 'con', 'man', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'movie', 'Abagnale', 'French', 'prison', 'being', 'released', 'custody', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'film', 'switch', 'back', 'Abagnale', 'conning', 'running', 'law', 'Abagnale', 'Hanratty', 'talking', 'plane', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'as', 'well', 'continued', 'questioning', 'how', 'Abagnale', 'got', 'caught.We', 'flash', 'back', 'Abagnale', 'home', 'devoted', 'father', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'divorce', 'court', 'requirement', 'make', 'choice', 'parent', 'live', 'Instead', 'Abagnale', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Thus', 'life', 'con', 'suggestion', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'check/credit', 'card', 'conning', 'away', 'Surprisingly', 'movie', 'focusing', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'hunt', 'catch', 'Abagnale.Hanratty', 'somewhat', 'geeky', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'very', 'serious', 'very', 'devoted', 'job', 'catching', 'check', 'frauds', 'Abagnale', 'good', 'job', 'Abagnale', 'Hanratty', 'long', 'chase', 'most', 'country', 'world', 'ending', 'France', 'film', 'Hanratty', 'more', 'clues', 'where', 'Abagnale', 'never', 'quite', 'catch', 'up', 'yearly', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'phone', 'call', 'Abagnale', 'Hanratty', 'end', 'up', 'alone', 'Christmas', '.We', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'cons', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'never', 'quite', 'see', 'preparation', 'learn', 'reason', 'why', 'Abagnale', 'conning', 'something', 'away', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'movie.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'had', 'choose', 'Abagnale', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'take', 'book', 'day', 'week']",Catch Me If You Can
605191,A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX,B00005JLSB,John,"[8, 8]","Those are perhaps the best three words to describe what Catch Me If You Can is, but it's not limited to that.When I first heard of this movie, I had low expectations to say the least.  The plot didn't seem like it was up to Spielberg standards, and at the time I didn't hold much respect for DiCaprio as an actor.  Of course, I was proven completely wrong.This was the most entertaining movie I have seen all year.  Never for one single second did my eyes vear from the screen.  My thoughts did not wander for even a single moment.  I was mesmerized by Frank William Abagnale Jr.'s life's tale.  It is truly amazing.  Once you think that he can't top himself, he does.  I don't want to reveal anything about the ending (even though it's not one of those big ""surprise ending"" movies) because it is so much better if you don't know.  I guarantee you will be laughing out loud at the irony of the end.But that won't be the only time you laugh - this movie is hilarious throughout!  From the beginning where he impersonates a substitute teacher on the spur of the moment (which ends up lasting a whole week, when he is caught he was in the middle of planning a field trip), to all the ways he eludes FBI Agent Carl Handratty, to the afore-mentioned ending.  It is sprinkled with so many jokes and gags that you will think it is a comedy......but there is also a serious dramatic edge.  The other main plotline that the movie revolves around is Frank's family.  When his parents divorce he is 16 years old, and that is when he runs off and starts his life of crime.  It is clear that this plays a key role in Frank's life.  Throughout his crimes, it becomes obvious he is trying to reclaim the loving life he had when his parents were still together.Overall, Frank Abagnale's life is quite a ride.  I have to admit, I personally envy him a little.  He manages to live the high life as a criminal, and more than get away with it afterwards.  I thought that this movie was more consistantly entertaining than the OTHER blockbuster, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which is quite slow through the middle.  Catch Me If You Can was such an entertaining, fun, and hope-filled journey that not only can I easily see myself buying the DVD and watching it innumerable times, but I also plan on seeing it AGAIN this coming weekend.  This will be one of the very few occasions that I have seen a movie twice while it is still in the theaters, and that is saying quite a lot because most movies aren't even worth the cost to see once (Analyze That) let alone twice in the same week.See this movie for a fun time, but expect to feel some heavy emotions.",5,"Uplifting, Funny, Entertaining",1041292800,"12 31, 2002",2002,2639,"['are', 'perhaps', 'best', 'three', 'words', 'describe', 'what', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'not', 'limited', 'that.When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'say', 'least', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'up', 'Spielberg', 'standards', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'much', 'respect', 'DiCaprio', 'actor', 'course', 'was', 'proven', 'completely', 'wrong.This', 'was', 'most', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'Never', 'one', 'single', 'second', 'did', 'eyes', 'vear', 'screen', 'thoughts', 'did', 'not', 'wander', 'even', 'single', 'moment', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'Frank', 'William', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'life', 'tale', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Once', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'top', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'anything', 'ending', 'even', 'not', 'one', 'big', 'surprise', 'ending', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'irony', 'end.But', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'time', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'beginning', 'where', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'spur', 'moment', 'up', 'lasting', 'whole', 'week', 'when', 'caught', 'was', 'middle', 'planning', 'field', 'trip', 'ways', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Carl', 'Handratty', 'afore-mentioned', 'ending', 'sprinkled', 'so', 'many', 'jokes', 'gags', 'will', 'think', 'comedy', 'also', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'edge', 'other', 'main', 'plotline', 'movie', 'around', 'Frank', 'family', 'When', 'parents', 'divorce', '16', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'life', 'crime', 'clear', 'key', 'role', 'Frank', 'life', 'crimes', 'obvious', 'trying', 'reclaim', 'loving', 'life', 'had', 'when', 'parents', 'were', 'still', 'together.Overall', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'life', 'quite', 'ride', 'have', 'admit', 'personally', 'envy', 'little', 'live', 'high', 'life', 'criminal', 'more', 'get', 'away', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'consistantly', 'entertaining', 'OTHER', 'blockbuster', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Two', 'Towers', 'quite', 'slow', 'middle', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'was', 'such', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'hope-filled', 'journey', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'buying', 'DVD', 'watching', 'innumerable', 'times', 'also', 'plan', 'seeing', 'AGAIN', 'coming', 'weekend', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'occasions', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'still', 'theaters', 'saying', 'quite', 'lot', 'most', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'cost', 'see', 'once', 'Analyze', 'That', 'let', 'alone', 'twice', 'same', 'week.See', 'movie', 'fun', 'time', 'expect', 'feel', 'heavy', 'emotions']",Catch Me If You Can

605193,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,B00005JLSB,"John ""MovieAddict""","[14, 18]","""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.There's no real plot to go into, as I have already given it to you. Other than telling you that the film opens when Frank is sixteen and runs away from home after his parents (Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye) have a messy divorce, you pretty much have the setup for a light, fluffy, and altogether fun film.Frank is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and the man hot on his trail, agent Carl Hanratty, is played by Tom Hanks. There isn't really a Carl Hanratty in real life, but it adds to the story. Frank, on the run, actually starts to become friends with Hanratty, who realizes Frank is just an adolescent and does not realize the eventual outcomes of what he is doing. Hanratty sort of adopts Frank, even after he is caught and thrown in a French prison. He helps him get transferred to an American prison, and then even gets him a job in the FBI for spotting fraudulent checks.I read Frank William Abagnale, Jr.'s true-crime memoir, which was released a few decades ago. It differs from the film at times, and it isn't always as light-hearted as the film is. But in terms of pure, fluffy fun at the movies, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a sure-fire hit. At times it seems to stray a bit too far off the path of realism, unlike the book, but that's part of the fun, really.The film is entirely watchable, and doesn't try to become an epic. Steven Spielberg creates a real dazzler here; it is effortlessly watchable and even at two and a half hours long, it doesn't become overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and, unlike most critics, I thought Tom Hanks did a great job in his role.I especially like how Spielberg captured the image of the '60s so well here, and John Williams' score fits the part of the film very well. And as for the cast, they are all matched perfectly to their characters. I especially liked Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale, Sr., who steals every scene he is in. His performance was worthy of its Oscar nom.If you just want to sit back and relax, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is the perfect film for you.

In the process, he passed phony checks totaling millions of dollars. Tom Hanks plays Carl Hanratty, the nerdy FBI agent out to bust young Frank.This is probably the best acting performance by DiCaprio since TITANIC, which isn't saying much, and Hanks has done better. However, both actors apparently had a lot of fun with their roles here, and it's that energy that makes CATCH ME IF YOU CAN a film worth watching. Also, Christopher Walken is wonderful as the enigmatic Frank Abagnale, Sr., whose business and marriage is ruined by the IRS, which is pursuing him for reasons left largely unspecified. And, while it was never clear to me whether the Old Man clearly understood the extent of his son's mischief, the occasional sly grin and whisper in the ear seemed to indicate that he admired and envied his boy's larcenous spirit and adventurous lifestyle.This film is a flight into nostalgia for those of us old enough to remember the days when commercial air travel still had &eacute;lan, when pilots were heroes, and when the politically correct ""cabin attendants"" were elegant ""stewardesses"".  There's one comic scene involving Frank, Carl and an in-flight chocolate &eacute;clair that pointedly recalls that coach fare used to be more than an apple and bagged peanuts.CATCH ME IF YOU CAN drags a little by the end, and the lesson of the epilog might be that crime pays.

605198,AR2DE47VCY1C8,B00005JLSB,"Joseph H Pierre ""Joe Pierre""","[1, 2]","This movie purports to be about an actual person, Frank Abagnale, Jr., who posed more or less successfully as an airline pilot, teacher, physician, lawyer, and Secret Service agent (not in that order) before he turned 21.It begins in a television studio, with three people all claiming to be the real Frank Abagnale, leaving the audience to judge who the real one is, but never returns to that sequence, and doesn't finish it.I remember seeing just such a TV show years ago, which showed just such an imposter, but whose name I've forgotten.  I remember that he posed as a surgeon in the Canadian Navy, where he actually removed an apprendix successfully, and as a professor at St. Martin's college outside Olympia, Washington.I don't remember all of the other details or parts he played, but I suspect that he was the trigger character for this movie.  If so, this was highly fictionalized, although the original story was supposedly written by Abagnale himself (the real con man).Steven Spielberg produced and directed Catch Me If You Can, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing a 17-year-old as the lead whose mother and father are splitting up, and eventually divorce.  The mother is cheating on his father, depicted as a romantic loser by Martin Sheen.  The FBI agent that is tailing Abagnale is very well portrayed by Tom Hanks.  DiCaprio, Sheen, and Hanks all turn in good peformances.The impostor that I saw on the TV show I later heard dropped out of sight, and apparently went back to his old tricks.  In the movie, Abagnale was sentenced to do 12 years in federal prison for bouncing a couple of million bucks worth of bad checks, but then was hired by the FBI to help them catch other ""paper hangers.""The denouement stated that Abagnale eventually was married, had children, and was living ""happily ever after.""It sounds too much like the character I saw on TV to be coincidental, but that guy was not a 17-year-old. More like in his forties, and not all that good-looking. Maybe Abagnale was a ""copy cat.""As another reviewer has said, Spielberg does not sufficiently delve into to details of how Abagnale pulled off his impersonations (it all looks far too easy), nor his motivation.All in all, it was an entertaining film.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books",4,"Good entertainment, but less than factual",1065398400,"10 6, 2003",2003,2321,"['movie', 'be', 'actual', 'person', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'who', 'posed', 'more', 'less', 'successfully', 'airline', 'pilot', 'teacher', 'physician', 'lawyer', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'not', 'order', 'turned', '21.It', 'begins', 'television', 'studio', 'three', 'people', 'claiming', 'be', 'real', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'leaving', 'audience', 'judge', 'who', 'real', 'one', 'never', 'returns', 'sequence', ""n't"", 'finish', 'it.I', 'remember', 'seeing', 'just', 'TV', 'show', 'years', 'ago', 'showed', 'just', 'such', 'imposter', 'name', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'remember', 'posed', 'surgeon', 'Canadian', 'Navy', 'where', 'actually', 'removed', 'apprendix', 'successfully', 'professor', 'St.', 'Martin', 'college', 'Olympia', 'Washington.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'other', 'details', 'parts', 'played', 'suspect', 'was', 'trigger', 'character', 'movie', 'so', 'was', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'supposedly', 'written', 'Abagnale', 'real', 'con', 'man', 'Spielberg', 'produced', 'directed', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'playing', '17-year-old', 'lead', 'mother', 'father', 'are', 'splitting', 'up', 'eventually', 'divorce', 'mother', 'cheating', 'father', 'depicted', 'romantic', 'loser', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'FBI', 'agent', 'tailing', 'Abagnale', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'DiCaprio', 'Sheen', 'Hanks', 'turn', 'good', 'peformances.The', 'impostor', 'saw', 'TV', 'show', 'later', 'heard', 'dropped', 'sight', 'apparently', 'went', 'back', 'old', 'tricks', 'movie', 'Abagnale', 'was', 'sentenced', 'do', '12', 'years', 'federal', 'prison', 'bouncing', 'couple', 'million', 'bucks', 'worth', 'bad', 'checks', 'then', 'was', 'hired', 'FBI', 'help', 'catch', 'other', 'paper', 'hangers', 'denouement', 'stated', 'Abagnale', 'eventually', 'was', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'was', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'saw', 'TV', 'be', 'coincidental', 'guy', 'was', 'not', '17-year-old', 'More', 'forties', 'not', 'good-looking', 'Maybe', 'Abagnale', 'was', 'copy', 'cat', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Spielberg', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'delve', 'details', 'how', 'Abagnale', 'pulled', 'off', 'impersonations', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'motivation.All', 'was', 'entertaining', 'film.Joseph', 'Joe', 'Pierreauthor', 'Handguns', 'Freedom', 'care', 'maintenanceand', 'other', 'books']",Catch Me If You Can

Perhaps I was so struck by the movie because I went in without having read any reviews, and I knew only little of the plot. So I went in without a biased opinion, and with an open mind, and was treated to the nicest movie I've caught since Lord of the Rings.Leonardo Dicaprio brings in his best performance here, in my opinion. He was a little off at first, but as the story delved more into his character, I believed him to be Frank Abagnale. With this being a true story, I was in awe at how much Frank actually got a way with. Sure, the movie may have exagerrated, but the situations Frank put himself into and got himself out of were absolutely crazy. Also how Dicaprio showed Frank's descent from fully confident in his dealings to being on the run and in fear from Tom Hanks' character Carl Hanratty was priceless. Speaking of Tom Hanks, he's so awesome. I've always liked him, but this movie made him high on my list of top actors. His subtle one liners were great, and the Knock Knock joke has become classic to me. A surprise to me was Christopher Walken. I'm used to seeing him play the villian or a devious character, but here he showed heart and range. Great actor. Another nice addition was Amy Adams.Everyone knows this, but Steven Spielberg is a directing genuis. He makes setting the tone for any type of feeling seem so easy. I'd feel like I was making an understatement if I said ""Great directing.""I'm continually saying good things about Catch Me If You Can, and it's because I honestly can't think of a bad thing.

SOUTH,"[1, 2]","Zzzzzzzzzzzz...that was my reaction to the New Year's Eve showing I saw of ""Catch Me If You Can"", and I wasn't the only one in the audience who had trouble staying awake.One of the main flaws with this film is its structure.  By starting the movie by showing us what is essentally the happy ending first (juvenile criminal Frank Abagnale all-grown up on the ""To Tell the Truth"" show, followed by a more-recent flashback being rescued by agent Handratty from a French prison), we can pretty much figure out the whole plot right at the outset, so the best director Spielberg can do for the remainder of a very long film is to distract us.  Granted this is done with superb acting and awesome photography of 1950's-60's scenery and costumes, but all it amounts to is a distraction nonetheless.I found the repeated Christmas phone calls and outrageous coincedences simply too much to swallow.  Spielberg IS one of my favorite directors of all time, but even his most far-out sci-fi epic was written more believably than this.There are glaring continuity problems in ""Catch Me..."" that have continued to sneak into SS's films starting with ""Artificial Intelligence"" when a character is shown in a perfectly dry, pressed shirt after rescuing his son from a swimming pool; and in ""Minority Report"" when the weather changes from a torrential rainstorm to a brilliantly sunny day in the next frame.  In ""Catch Me"" we have an absurd chasm between two Kitty Carlisle voice-overs in the opening scene, and later, a wine-stain on beige carpet moves very obviously between shots.

That's good, because the viewer can concentrate in the actors' performance. And that's this movie's main feature.The story, as everyone may already know, is about Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who left home as a sixteen-year-old and became one of the most successful criminal of all times. What is most interesting, Abagnale was an intelligent felon, his crimes were related to fraudulent checks, identities, etc; he didn't have to murder or kidnapp anyone to be part of FBI's top 10 wanted list.Abagnale Jr is played by Leonardo diCaprio, acting in a very loose and comfortable way, at times serious, at other times charming, according to the script. Tom Hanks proves his capacity at playing another different character: Carl Hanratty is boring, fatty, charmless, lonely and yet you like him anyway. The duo's relationship is very well portraied in screen. Another good thing is that Christopher Walken's back to a good role as Leonardo diCaprio's father.This is nice entertainment, and the best part is that it was reportedly an easy and fast film to make, and based on a true story. There are some obvious fictious parts in the movie, but that's for script's sake, so it doesn't ruin the story.Grade 8.7/10",5,No-special-effects-Spielberg,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,1305,"['Catch', 'can', 'maybe', 'Spielberg', 'first', 'movie', 'not', 'featuring', 'special', 'effects', 'Duel', 'good', 'viewer', 'can', 'concentrate', 'actors', 'performance', 'movie', 'main', 'feature.The', 'story', 'everyone', 'may', 'already', 'know', 'Frank', 'W.', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'who', 'left', 'home', 'sixteen-year-old', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'criminal', 'times', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'Abagnale', 'was', 'intelligent', 'felon', 'crimes', 'were', 'related', 'fraudulent', 'checks', 'identities', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'murder', 'kidnapp', 'anyone', 'be', 'part', 'FBI', 'top', '10', 'wanted', 'list.Abagnale', 'Jr', 'played', 'Leonardo', 'diCaprio', 'acting', 'very', 'loose', 'comfortable', 'way', 'times', 'serious', 'other', 'times', 'charming', 'according', 'script', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'capacity', 'playing', 'different', 'character', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'boring', 'fatty', 'charmless', 'lonely', 'yet', 'like', 'anyway', 'duo', 'relationship', 'very', 'well', 'portraied', 'screen', 'good', 'thing', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'back', 'good', 'role', 'Leonardo', 'diCaprio', 'father.This', 'nice', 'entertainment', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'reportedly', 'easy', 'fast', 'film', 'make', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'are', 'obvious', 'fictious', 'parts', 'movie', 'script', 'sake', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'story.Grade', '8.7/10']",Catch Me If You Can

605210,A2BRSYSJO4L7VV,B00005JLSB,"Ken ""KC Music Fan""","[9, 9]","Having seen Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes in The Aviator(a role which I think will win him an Oscar), I checked out the DVD of Catch Me If You Can.  Leo plays con artist Frank Abagnale Jr., who in the '60s successfully passed himself off as several other people, among them airline pilot Frank Taylor, Secret Service man Barry Allen, and doctor-turned-lawyer Frank Connors, and wrote fraudulent checks totaling millions of dollars while he was using his various identities.  As Frank Connors, Frank Abagnale Jr. was a doctor, a prosecutor, and an Attorney General candidate for the state of Louisiana.  As the movie(which is based on Frank's memoirs) shows, Frank pulled off his act so successfully that it was four years before the FBI caught him.  He was finally apprehended in France, where the bogus checks were printed.  After getting out of prison, as seen in the movie, Frank went to work for the FBI's Check Fraud Unit, where his supervisor was Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who pursued him.  Tom Hanks plays Carl, the FBI man, and Christopher Walken has a fine performance as Frank's father, Frank Sr.  Martin Sheen also is solid, playing Frank's future father-in-law, Roger Strong.  Frank proposes to Roger's daughter, Brenda(Amy Adams), whom he meets while working as a doctor, but Frank abruptly runs out of his engagement party when he realizes that Carl and his fellow FBI agents are after him and that he couldn't get rid of his Frank Connors identity if he stayed married.  Soon after, when he's conducting another ruse, this time training stewardesses, Frank flies off to France, where Carl catches him.  In the movie, Frank escapes briefly after Carl brings him back to New York, but he is again caught, this time outside his mother's home.  The movie doesn't give us just one reason why Frank turned to crime, but we get a few clues:  his dad's problems with the IRS, the breakup of his parents' marriage(which resulted in his running away from home), and his need to make money really fast in order to survive.  Also, Frank's mom, Paula(Nathalie Baye), as depicted in the film, did a little manipulating herself--for instance, she told Carl that she'd help pay the checks Frank had bounced.  The movie also is a redemption story.  Carl, who is wrestling with his own personal problems(his own divorce, not having seen his daughter), becomes a sort of father figure to Frank--and, as stated earlier, he ends up being Frank's supervisor at the FBI.  While Carl uses a ruse to get Frank to open up to him(giving Frank permission to call his father while, unknown to both of them, Frank Sr. had died), he eventually earns Frank's trust.  As the ending shows, in real life Frank helped the FBI crack numerous check fraud cases and formed a lasting friendship with Carl.  To the impatient movie watcher, Catch Me If You Can seems overly long(two hours and 21 minutes, not including the extras), which I think drags it down to ""only"" a four-star rating.  However, I think producer-director Steven Spielberg wanted the movie to be a character study of Frank and not just another Star Wars-type action flick--and in this regard, he does well.  Leo's portrayal of Frank--the charming con artist who at the same time is very human--is believable, and Tom Hanks gives a commanding yet sympathetic performance as Carl.  The bonus material on the second disc is excellent.  In addition to interviews with cast and crew members and the story of how the movie was made, the material includes Frank Abagnale Jr.'s own discussion of how he became a con artist, his various occupations, how he was apprehended, and how his work with the FBI influenced banking practices.  Frank himself served as a consultant on this movie, and his input helped give the film its early '60s authenticity.  This movie has a great story with some interesting characters.

605218,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLSB,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 0]","The problem with ""Catch Me If You Can"" depends on whether you are vexed with the director or the starring actors.  If you go the Dawson Leery route and are a fan of Steven Spielberg then it seems the complaint is that this film is no ""E.T.,"" ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Schindler's List.""  But if you are a fan of Tom Hanks then the complaint would be that this is not a ""Philadelphia,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" or ""Cast Away.""  The idea that Spielberg and Hanks, who worked together on ""Saving Private Ryan,"" would spend there time on this trifle seems to be too much for some fans to take.  But then Leonardo DiCaprio, who has seen little sign of the critical success (""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"") or box office success (""Titanic"") of his earlier days is probably just happy to have had movies with Spielberg and Martin Scorsese out at the same time.  Okay, so ""Catch Me If You Can"" is not a great film.  It is a very good film and that puts all the parties concerned ahead of the game given the standard fare from Hollywood.The story might not be about life and death, but it is certainly compelling.  Young Frank W. Abagnale Jr (DiCaprio) runs away from home rather than deal with the divorce of his parents and has to live by his wits and the checkbook in his back pocket.  It turns out his wits are pretty good and he is not only able to pass millions of dollars worth of bad checks, but pass himself off as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Doggedly pursuing him is F.B.I. agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who knows that Frank is really a beggarman and thief.  Actually, we know that Frank will get his man, because that is how the film opens, and it is as Hanratty is bringing Frank back to the United States from France that the story is revealed.""Catch Me If You Can,"" based on Abagnale's biography, is the story of an engaging rogue who uses his charm and aforementioned quick wits to get himself out of one sticky situation after another.  The man had panache, which is exemplified when he has to get through the Miami airport despite the fact Hanratty has F.B.I. agents at every other line.  The movie is not really a primer for a life of crime since Abagnale's did his con man act in the Sixties and technology has advanced well beyond his effective use of a bathtub full of water and model airplanes to make thousands of dollars.In addition to the questions regarding how Frank does it and how Hanratty catches him, there is the relationship between the two men as well as the relationship between Frank and his father (Christopher Walken), from whom he gets his charm and sense of larceny.  It is when the film operates on this level that ""Catch Me If You Can"" becomes another classic Spielberg film, at least in the sense of the constant theme of symbolic fathers and sons, even if it never gets churned into real butter.This is an enjoyable film even if it does not fall into the category of joining other Spielberg, Hanks, and DiCaprio films that you have in your video library for convenient repeat viewing.  There is a bonus disc with the DVD version, which only has 75 minutes worth of extra material, mostly about the real Frank Abegnale Jr. (maybe when Spielberg has to put kids through college or something he will break down and start doing commentary tracks so I can get enjoy a course in filmmaking in the comfort of my own home).  If you really are insulted by Spielberg and Hanks doing this project, just wait until next year's ""Terminal.""

605228,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JLSB,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 1]","Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, a natural born con-man, and a real person.  At first Frank is merely an imposter.  However, as the movie progresses Frank begins to find out how easy it is to write bad checks and to forge documents that are his entry into jobs such as doctor, lawyer and even jet pilot.  Eventually, the forgeries begin running into millions of dollars, and Frank risks making a mistake that will cause someone's death.Two events lead to Frank's eventual undoing.  First, Frank falls in love.  As with all great con men, falling in love is nearly always a precursor to doom, as we have previously discovered in movies such as ""The Music Man"" and ""The Distinguished Gentleman"".  Once a con man falls in love, he begins to care, and once he begins to care, eventually he realizes that there are other things in life besides being a con man.  The other event is a chance meeting with Tom Hanks, playing FBI agent Carl Hanratty.  Once Tom Hanks is on the trail of Frank, he doesn't let go for the rest of the movie, eventually tracking him down and catching him.One of the problems with the movie is that it is a little difficult to understand Frank's motivations.  Frank was put into a situation in his life where he felt he was in an untenable situation.  Further, he was extremely intelligent.  Frank didn't really think about becoming an imposter and writing bad checks, it just happened, and being successful as an imposter and at getting money by writing bad checks then created a lifestyle that in many ways Frank enjoys.  However, if you have not been faced with the kind of emotional stress Frank faced, it may be difficult to understand why Frank did what he did.Another problem is with Tom Hanks.  Tom plays a character similar to the character he played in ""Dragnet"".  In some ways Carl Hanratty appears to be a stereotype.  However, I can imagine that in the 1960s check fraud was not a high-profile and glamorous job in the FBI, instead relegated to nerdy types better suited for doing research than for breaking down doors and pulling guns.  If you consider the kinds of people that historically have systematically written bad checks for large sums of money, these people are often intelligent and well-organized, and it requires a special skill to find these people.  Carl Hanratty was perfect for the job, though initially somewhat naive.I was reminded of ""The Great Imposter"" starring Tony Curtis as I watched this movie.  I was fascinated by the story of Ferdinand Demara, who typically impersonated doctors.  Both that movie and this one have their strong points, but I give the nod to this movie for greater entertainment value, assuming you can get through the occasionally confusing first half of the movie.I am not a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan.  However, Leo is a perfect fit as Frank Abagnale.  In my opinion this role may be one of Leo's best performances, in the same league as his performance in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"".  At the very least Leo should have gotten a nomination by someone for his acting in this movie, which was very good.Creating a movie such as this is a difficult task.  It is sometimes difficult for a modern audience to put itself into an era that, while not so very long ago, is very different from what they have experienced.  Further, it may also be difficult to understand the motivations of someone like Frank.  Director Steven Spielberg tries very hard to accomplish both tasks.  In the first part of the movie, I struggled somewhat trying to put the pieces together and follow the rapidly evolving plot, and sometimes had to pick up answers from later in the movie, but I felt overall the effort and the ending was worth the wait; 4 stars for a very entertaining movie about a challenging subject.",4,Very Entertaining and Intelligent Story,1052352000,"05 8, 2003",2003,3778,"['Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'natural', 'born', 'con-man', 'real', 'person', 'first', 'Frank', 'merely', 'imposter', 'However', 'movie', 'Frank', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'easy', 'write', 'bad', 'checks', 'forge', 'documents', 'are', 'entry', 'jobs', 'such', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'even', 'jet', 'pilot', 'Eventually', 'forgeries', 'begin', 'running', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Frank', 'risks', 'making', 'mistake', 'will', 'cause', 'someone', 'death.Two', 'events', 'lead', 'Frank', 'eventual', 'undoing', 'First', 'Frank', 'love', 'great', 'con', 'men', 'falling', 'love', 'nearly', 'always', 'precursor', 'doom', 'have', 'previously', 'discovered', 'movies', 'such', 'Music', 'Man', 'Distinguished', 'Gentleman', 'con', 'man', 'love', 'care', 'once', 'care', 'eventually', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'life', 'being', 'con', 'man', 'other', 'event', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Once', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'trail', 'Frank', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'rest', 'movie', 'eventually', 'tracking', 'down', 'catching', 'him.One', 'problems', 'movie', 'little', 'difficult', 'understand', 'Frank', 'motivations', 'Frank', 'was', 'put', 'situation', 'life', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'untenable', 'situation', 'Further', 'was', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'Frank', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'becoming', 'imposter', 'writing', 'bad', 'checks', 'just', 'happened', 'being', 'successful', 'imposter', 'getting', 'money', 'writing', 'bad', 'checks', 'then', 'created', 'lifestyle', 'many', 'ways', 'Frank', 'However', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'faced', 'kind', 'emotional', 'stress', 'Frank', 'faced', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'Frank', 'did', 'what', 'did.Another', 'problem', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Tom', 'character', 'similar', 'character', 'played', 'Dragnet', 'ways', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'be', 'stereotype', 'However', 'can', 'imagine', '1960s', 'check', 'fraud', 'was', 'not', 'high-profile', 'glamorous', 'job', 'FBI', 'instead', 'relegated', 'nerdy', 'types', 'better', 'suited', 'doing', 'research', 'breaking', 'down', 'doors', 'pulling', 'guns', 'consider', 'kinds', 'people', 'historically', 'have', 'systematically', 'written', 'bad', 'checks', 'large', 'sums', 'money', 'people', 'are', 'often', 'intelligent', 'well-organized', 'special', 'skill', 'find', 'people', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'was', 'perfect', 'job', 'initially', 'somewhat', 'naive.I', 'was', 'reminded', 'Great', 'Imposter', 'starring', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'fascinated', 'story', 'Ferdinand', 'Demara', 'who', 'typically', 'impersonated', 'doctors', 'movie', 'one', 'have', 'strong', 'points', 'give', 'nod', 'movie', 'greater', 'entertainment', 'value', 'assuming', 'can', 'get', 'occasionally', 'confusing', 'first', 'half', 'movie.I', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'fan', 'However', 'Leo', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'opinion', 'role', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'Leo', 'best', 'performances', 'same', 'league', 'performance', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'very', 'least', 'Leo', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'nomination', 'someone', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good.Creating', 'movie', 'such', 'difficult', 'task', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'modern', 'audience', 'put', 'era', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'long', 'ago', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'have', 'experienced', 'Further', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'difficult', 'understand', 'motivations', 'someone', 'Frank', 'Director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'very', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'tasks', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'struggled', 'somewhat', 'trying', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'follow', 'rapidly', 'evolving', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'had', 'pick', 'up', 'answers', 'later', 'movie', 'felt', 'overall', 'effort', 'ending', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', '4', 'stars', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'challenging', 'subject']",Catch Me If You Can

It's got humor sprinkled throughout and when you see what the ending tells you - you'll walk out of the theatre in amazement.The story is that of 16 year-old played by Leonardo DiCaprio (Titanic, Gangs of New York) who cons his way into the airline business, medical field and in the Legal profession. His learns the scheming ways from his father who is brilliantly played by Christopher Walkin (The Dead Zone, America's Sweethearts).Now, the FBI catches on to forged checks and sees a pattern develop and then assigns Tom Hanks (Apollo 13, Castaway, Splash) to try and track him down and incarcerate himSpielberg directed this one with a little flair and a lot of attention to detail. It has humorous moments and a lot of interesting facets on the FBI, their procedures and what a clever boy can really do.As a result of his worldly travels he ends up falling in love and the kicker of it all is the ending when you read the text on the screen that tells you what happened to these two men and what their doping today.

And entertain it did!Reviewers of the movie are at odds, either giving it high praise, when they recognize that it is just there to entertain the filmgoer, or calling it dreadful, when they expect every Spielberg movie to be a momentous event of special effects and storytelling. &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; is based on the life of a con man, who pulled his crimes as a teenager, and then reformed for the rest of a long life.  The story engrosses the watcher, and Spielberg gives the film a light touch, a terrific cast, and fits it all into the eerily real culture of the 60's everyday life with costumes (wardrobe is outstanding), period sets, and a general feeling of wonder (Remember &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;?) that was the true 60's feel, devoid of momentous political events and the inevitable strife caused by war.DiCaprio is featured as an odd duck, an obsessive compulsive trapped in escalating acts designed to make his father feel that his life is successful.  He shows some great naivete, especially in the scene criticized by many with Jennifer Garner, and displays the genial and engaging manner that the real Frank must have had to get away with what he did.Hanks is another believable work obsessive compulsive who chases him down and forms the nucleus of the nonviolent criminal teams that solve financial crimes in this country every day.  Bringing Frank to the FBI feels a little unbelievable, but it DID happen, and it was based on Hanratty's understanding and faith in not only the genius, but also the need of Abagnale to outsmart the world.  I'm sure it was a hugefinancial success for law enforcement in the real world.Many seem surprised at the fine flair that Christopher Walken displays as Frank's father, but Walken's career is full of moments like these, where he has flashes of a true craftsman, then does an over the top performance in his next role...kind of a roller coaster ride with this fine performer, you never know what to expect.The audience clapped in the film I saw, enjoyed the music, had a great time...now that's entertainment!  Catch Me If You Can blends light comedy with a background edge of why things turn out the way they do when families dissolve.

The FBI is following him, particularly Carl Handratty, who works in the fraud department and doesn't have much for a sense of humor.

He was the only child of his parents and his father (Christopher Walkin) made a decently living from owning a store.All that came crashing down around him when the IRS came calling demanding more money.  As things got more and more dire, his mother (Nathalie Baye) filed for divorce.  Suddenly forced to choose between his two parents, Frank took off instead with the clothes on his back and a checkbook with a balance of $25.Even though Frank was only 16 at the time, he was also brilliant.  He quickly figured out how to cash checks for more then he had.  That led to forging checks, which led to taking jobs as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor, all without even a high school diploma.But things weren't all fun and games.  FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) was on his tale.  Can Carl catch Frank?The movie starts out rather slowly.  Watching Frank begin his life of crime is only interesting for a little while, but it takes much longer then it should.Once Carl really gets into the picture and the two start their cat and mouse games the tension really picks up.  And it is hard to know who to root for, Frank to get away or Carl to capture him.  The two actors do a great job of making their characters real and sympathetic.The movie is based on a true story.  Since this is Hollywood, that means take with a shaker of salt.  But it is still interesting to think of a teen really being able to pull this off.  Naturally, with the advent of computer banking and added security, he'd have to work much harder to even think of pulling all this off today.This movie starts as a slow character study but builds into a chase movie with heart.

I then rented the DVD to see the whole movie  --  and I couldn't believe how tedious the first portion was. If I had originally watched the movie from the beginning, I don't think I would have survived to where it got going. Rumor has it that Spielberg didn't wholeheartedly want to direct this film, and I think it shows.But it's still a 5/5, because when it's good, it's very good. You get fascinated about this genius con-artist, you can't help pulling for him, and you become interested enough to wonder about a lot of things. I couldn't resist googling the heck out of it afterwards, to find out more about what has become of the guy, to find out how closely the movie followed the actual story (answer: pretty closely but with some poetic license), and most especially to try to find out what became of that nurse that he got engaged to (who coincidentally has the same name as one of the actresses on ""Desperate Housewives"").Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks do well and are very good together, but it doesn't seem that the movie uses either one quite to the fullest; it's kind of like having Alex Rodriguez play 3rd base, which of course can have its points.Anybody else notice how much Hanks seems like Dan Aykroyd in this movie? The role actually has some resemblances to Aykroyd's part in ""Ghostbusters,"" although of course this role is more serious and complex. Also.....anybody else catch the resemblance between DiCaprio's final scene with the nurse and his final scene with Kate Winslet in ""Titanic""? I would guess that this was intentional; it almost had to be.My DVD had a defect at the very end: A final portion, lasting maybe a couple of minutes, got clipped off. I don't know if this was just one defective disc or if it's something systematic.

605246,A1HFIKNWLABJIN,B00005JLSB,"mark ""weeping_guitar""","[19, 30]","Steven Spielberg has crafted what may be his most purely fun, breezy film that is quite unlike his pictures as of late, or really ever. It feels effortless in it's creation as do the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio as our young rouge and Tom Hanks as the FBI agent assigned to track him down. Casting DiCaprio as Frank Abagnale was a stroke of pure genius as he can capture the essence of both age 17 and 27 with ease. It helps that Spielberg's team has perfectly not only re-created the look, but the feel and sound of the 1960s with ease. From the creative animated opening title sequence to the final frame, everything feels natural to the time it portrays. John Williams once again completes Spielberg by returning to his jazz roots with a soundtrack that captures the film and it's mood perfectly.Frank Abagnale was obsessed with labels; not what they were for, but how they were perceived. Frank not only impersonated a pilot, doctor, and lawyer before his 25th birthday along with cashing millions of dollars in fraudulent checks, but got away with it. Why, because he made sure he was perceived the right way, had the right label. The 1960s America was much more trusting than today's and Frank couldn't have taken much more advantage of it. He was able to get information at ease, nobody questioning him why he wanted to know the detailed workings of both the airline and banking industry other than out of curiosity.Spielberg would naturally be attracted to this project. It's a well documented fact that Spielberg grew up in a broken home and it had a vast impact on him as does Frank's parents divorce on him. More importantly, Spielberg was a bit of an impersonator himself as a teen. He snuck into a film lot as a teenage and pretended he worked there, I believe even having his own office. A couple years later he got a job there, at least an official one.Frank Abagnale Jr.'s real love was for his parents and when their love isn't there anymore, his whole world crashes down on him. He was in awe of his father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken). They had the ideal life as Frank married the French sweetheart he found at the end of the war and he takes glory in reciting their story over and over. Walken gives a fantastic performance as Frank Sr., who gets in trouble with the IRS and his family forced to move from their comfy suburban home to a small apartment in the city. Frank's mother leaves them for a more successful man and instead of confronting his problem, Frank runs from it. He first starts cashing bad checks to live, but soon finds out he can get much farther when he remakes his image from a down and out runaway teen to an up and coming pilot. This was the jet-set age and flight was a relatively new thing and once Frank sees how high pilots are held in  the public's view he knows exactly what to do.But the key is that he still feels like he's a teenager playing a game and doesn't come across as urgent or uptight so he's relatively cool when confronting those in a position to break his scam.  His charm throughout is his best weapon and he's a dead-eye shooter with it. He hardly has to lift a finger to get information out of people and takes advantage of their trust in either his youth or look. He effortlessly moves from one scam to the next once the previous one feels threatened by either the occupation or the government who is catching up to him or usually just boredom of the same old gag getting old.Carl Hanratty (Hanks) seems to understand the mind of his prey. Hanks plays the character well and it's nice to see him in a role that can play off his freewheeling, humorous side. Hanratty  has many close calls with Frank, the first where Hanratty had him in the same room but was fooled like so many before him. At first Abagnale loves it and relishes his near escape, until he realizes the only person he can have a truthful conversation with is Hanratty, which Hanratty uses to his advantage. He's closing in and Frank has to become that much more on his toes, which he takes as a challenge and meets it for the most part, but does become that much more frazzled.The interplay between Hanks and DiCaprio is really fun to watch. They push each other to embrace their own characters that much more and it's a joy to view. DiCaprio's fun, charming Frank is the perfect balance to Hank's boring, straight-edged Carl. They soon become each other's only true conversation partner as Hanratty starts getting calls from Frank and he calls Frank's bluff and tells him straight out ""you didn't have anyone else to call!"". Hanratty is getting too close and Frank has to run, but he has nowhere to go for the most part. It's no longer a game and he's coming to see himself as a criminal, not a kid, and wants to get caught but at the same time can't let himself stop playing the game.I was really impressed by DiCaprio's performance; same with Hanks. Both of them, along with director Steven Spielberg, seem effortless in their performance and the film comes across effortless to watch. The story flows well and you end up feeling for not only our lovable criminal, but also our plain federal agent, who ends up the only one who really cares for Frank, even after all the frustration he's brought him. The end may drag a bit, but it's doesn't take anything away from the film and the time isn't really wasted. John Williams provides a nice jazzy score to compliment what's on screen. A perfect holiday film that isn't out to blow you away, take to you a foreign land, or change your world, but to simply entertain the hell out of you and it succeeds perfectly in that department.",5,Catch This Movie,1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,5623,"['Steven', 'Spielberg', 'crafted', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'purely', 'fun', 'breezy', 'film', 'quite', 'pictures', 'late',

605247,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00005JLSB,Martin Asiner,"[2, 4]","It is not often that I get to see a movie that has so many preconceived ideas eminating from other and similar films as well as an effective use of nostalgia carefully mixed with psychological undertones.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN brings to mind Tony Curtis as Ferdinand Waldo Demarra of THE GREAT IMPOSTER.  However, in Curtis' case, his quest for identity was vaguely undefined as he sloughed his skins more for the sheer joy of it than for any other ostensible purpose.  Leonardo DiCaprio made it clear early on that his own quest was based on a need to restore his moral universe, one in which was threatened by the dissolution of his parents' marriage.  DiCaprio, as Frank Abagnale,Jr, idolized his parents.  When they danced, the joy in his eyes was unmistakable.  It was when they stopped dancing, that the world of marital discord intruded.  Christopher Walken, as Frank's con man father, gives a powerful performance as a smooth talking yet ineffective businessman whose only success in life was to have married a desirable Frenchwoman some twenty years earlier.  It is Walken's constant harping of his landing her that, over the years, became the central mantra for his son's life.  In the young Frank's eyes, his mother became a symbol of all that was noble and beautiful, and if it were a lack of money and success that doomed his father to lose her, then it became his own mission in life to reconnect them.  All of the scams that Frank Jr. pulled off are seen not as to enrich his own wallet, but to act as the glue to reestablish the natural order of things.  DiCaprio's most touching scenes are the most easily overlooked. In a restaurant, he is dressed as a co-pilot, treating his father to a fancy meal.  During the conversation, in front of his father's astonished eyes, he casually pushes the keys to a brand new Cadillac parked just outside.  ""Take them, Dad,"" he pleads, ""won't Mom be impressed.""  There are many scenes like that which allow Frank to make it clear that his crimes of theft and forgery mask a talent that under different circumstances might have allowed him to be in  the flesh those fake uniformed superficial entities that now register in the mind as the prototypical demi-gods that ruled the television screens of the 60s.Tom Hanks, as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, registers as a sort of combination of pseudo-father figure whose respect Frank wishes with a more than subtle undertone as Frank's Dr. Richard Kimble to Carl's Detective Gerard.  But unlike that fugitive, this one plays his escapes with style and a sense of not wishing to blend in.  Where Dr. Kimble sought work as dishwashers, Frank Abagnale flew only in the highest stratospheres of our cultures.  Not only did he want the job of pilot, doctor, and lawyer, he wanted their badge and uniform too. This connection of Carl Hanratty as father-confessor and father-surrogate slowly accrues its own kinetic energy until by the film's end, the bond between Frank and Carl was at least as strong as the one that Frank tried so hard to forge with his own father.  By the time the closing credits roll, Frank shows that the simple respect that one human being can feel for another can be enough to turn around a life that for a few short years seemed headed for a tragedy that this film thankfully avoided.

605248,A8TZ88OM8YOLW,B00005JLSB,MartyHansen,"[3, 4]","The storyline seems highly implausible on the surface; a seventeen-year-old boy runs away from home and impersonates an airline pilot, a pediatrician, and a district attorney - and is chased by the FBI for passing millions of dollars in bad checks.  And why cast Leonardo DiCaprio, a pretty face, in the lead role if you want this film to be believable?But the movie, `Catch Me If You Can,' works surprisingly well; and not just because Leonardo uses his disguise to obtain sex from unsuspecting stewardesses; and not just because he cons a high-priced hooker into giving him a night's worth of pleasure - in exchange for an over-the-amount cashier's check - in which he even makes a profit on the deal!No, this feature is remarkably heart-warming because Leonardo (as Frank Abagnale Jr., a real person) is motivated, despite his sophistication, by a young boy's desire to help his father financially - in the secret hope that he might somehow bring his parents back together.Christopher Walken plays an outstanding role as Frank Abagnale Sr., Leonardo's father in the film.  The relationship they share is special; and Walken presents the elder Abagnale with extreme dignity, even as his life spirals irreversibly downhill.Tom Hanks (as Inspector Hanratty) is the nerdish FBI agent who obsesses over catching Leonardo, and eventually does.  But the movie reaches a seemingly poignant conclusion when Leonardo discovers, after he is apprehended, that his father has died without ever regaining his stature; and that his mother has remarried (and has had another child) - forever dashing his dreams of recapturing they joy they once shared together as a family.  Frank's life then encounters a fortuitous twist - which leads to a surprisingly happy conclusion!If you've ever loved your dad, or suffered through your own parent's break up, I'm sure you'll find this film to be exceptionally moving.  The outrageous cons are actually just for kicks.

605252,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005JLSB,Matthew Gladney,"[13, 16]","""Catch Me If You Can"" is the dramatization of the semi-true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a man who, during the 1960s, managed to con his way from woman to woman, and locale to locale. Abagnale lived his life of deceit all before the age of 20. There have been some liberties taken with the story (isn't that always the case with film?), but you get the overall picture of what his life was like at the time. It makes for an interesting, engaging movie. This will not be a deep, meaningful 2 hours you spend, watching this film, but it will be enjoyable.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale Jr., a teenager living at home with his mother and father, living what seems to be, by all intents and purposes, a 'normal' life. Then we begin to see the layers of the family's life come apart and unravel. Frank Sr., played with subtle depth by Christopher Walken, is being hounded by the IRS. He has lost all of the family's money. Then, the mother sees fit to find her comfort elsewhere, if you know what I mean. The family falls apart. Frank Jr., unable to handle this, runs away. And thus begins the main thrust of ""Catch Me If You Can"".Frank Jr.'s role model growing up was his father, who we can infer from his IRS troubles wasn't the most proper businessman on the face of the planet. Frank Jr. follows in his footsteps. He runs the gamut, from check forgery to false identities. The junior Frank criss-crosses the nation, finding a woman in every city, and prosperity at every turn (all through deceit, of course). FBI agent Carl Hanratty, played with hilarious deadpan by Tom Hanks, is constantly on Abagnale's trail, but always seems to be a step behind.This doesn't feel like a Steven Spielberg movie and, though I hardly ever thought I'd be saying this, that is a good thing. At times, Spielberg's hand can be a tad heavy over the atmosphere of a film, and this particular tale needs to be let free to just simply tell its story. And it is. The movie flows effortlessly from scene-to-scene, plot point-to-plot point, and it's a good, smooth ride. Tom Hanks does the most perfect portrayal of a thick-rimmed glasses, stuffy personality 'suit' that you could hope for. Leonardo DiCaprio, though about ten years older than the part he plays, still looks boyishly handsome, and once again gives us a strong, confident performance. He just gets better with each role he undertakes, and he already started out as the best of his generation. Christopher Walken deserves accolades for his role as Frank Abagnale Sr. There are so many scenes where he simply simmers with complexity. One scene, in particular, filled me with so much sympathy for the character that I immediately thought 'he needs to get an Oscar nomination for this'.""Catch Me If You Can"" won't change your life. It isn't some profound piece of film such as ""Schindler's List"", or ""Saving Private Ryan"". No, Spielberg has left that behind, for the moment, and instead has given us a solid, well-structured, appealing chase film that doesn't feel like a chase film. And the opening credits are some of the most creative I've seen in a long time - a fun blend of sixties jazz and cartoon frolic. John William's score is also excellent. There isn't much to *not* recommend about this film.

605253,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLSB,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","""Catch me if you Can"" is an entertaining movie directed by that proverbial icon, Steven Spielberg. Call it Spielberg Lite. Perhaps exhausted by his last two films - the deeper and more controversial ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Minority Report"", Spielberg chose to helm this screen version of the true life story of Frank Abagnale, who in the 1960s successfully posed as an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer. He also wrote millions of dollars in bad checks. What makes the story even more interesting is the fact that Frank was in his late teens when all of this happened.A Spielberg project usually involves stellar talent. Here we have Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale, Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent who relentlessly pursues him, and Christopher Walken as Abagnale's father.The movie truly is a lot of fun. It makes a hero of sorts out of an amoral protagonist, but Hollywood has a grand tradition of doing this - think George Clooney in ""Ocean's Eleven"", for example. After all, it is sometimes gratifying to root for a character who operates outside of the system. My only problem with ""Catch me if you Can"" is this: In Spielberg Lite, the director's tendency to manipulate becomes glaringly apparent. It's all the same heart-sting pulling maneuvers he has been using since ""ET"" twenty years ago, and I find the tactics a bit tiresome.

Not even a trailer, not something I would have expected from a Steven Spielberg film. Mind you, he's probably waiting until everyone's bought it, and then will release a special edition, director's cut, or some nonsense. I was very disappointed that there was no extras. I hate DVDs like that.I was a bit unsure about this movie, but I ended up really enjoying it. I wasn't keen on the very 1960s credits at the start, and the film seemed a bit overlong, but not in a tedious way. It's the only one of Leonardo DiCaprio's films I've liked since Titanic, and that's saying something. He does so well in this movie! He manages to look really young (thanks to a very dodgy haircut) and then looks older, and really gaunt at one point. It was all very well done, and it was a very subtle aging.It's a very intriguing film, finding out how people fake cheques, etc. How he managed to get away with it for as long as he did is shocking. And I LOVED the whole relationship between Tom Hanks & Leonardo, it was a very strange relationship, but at the same time, interesting. It's the way Tom Hanks starts off chasing him, and towards the end they end up being friends - and they're still friends to this day according to the end of the film.The end of the film bothered me a bit, it seemed awfully sluggish compared to the rest of it. Thankfully, both actors manage to almost rescue the film, and keep it going, and keep you watching. With different actors, it might have failed. And there's a whole host of supporting actors, including Christopher Walken (fabulous as ever), and a very strange role starring Jennifer Garner! It was quite a shock to see her, and it was a very small role, which didn't quite seem to fit in with the rest of the film. What happened to the cheque that he gave her? It only took her a day to film - what an easy life eh? She must have been paid a fair bit, just for a couple of minutes screen time.A highly recommended film, which will have you smiling right the way through, and will definitely get you in the mood to read the book.

He's a pathological liar; how can we like someone who has stolen over 4 million dollars, and doesn't know how to live HIS life?""  In spite of Leonardo diCaprio's smooth performance, I didn't find myself feeling sorry for his character. Since this is based on a true story, other things became evident:  the ineptness of the FBI in the pursuit of this con artist; the gullibility of hundreds of people who could accept this baby-faced boy as a doctor, lawyer, co-pilot; Steven Spielberg still knows how to make a movie great even when it's subject matter isn't.  With that said, you should enjoy the capers of this brilliant young man as he goes from life to life and ultimately ends up becoming a millionaire by helping the government find others like himself.  Hmm..crime might pay?  Christopher Walken is very good in his Oscar nominated role as Leo's father, a con man in his own right; Jennifer Garner pops up in a brief role as a very high class hooker; Amy Adams is fine as Leo's love interest and almost bride; Martin Sheen shines as Amy's romantic father; and of course, two time Oscar winner Tom Hanks shows why he's one of the finest actors of our generation in his role as the fiercely determined, if somewhat ineffective, Carl Handratty.

605260,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JLSB,Michael Crane,"[1, 1]","""Catch Me if You Can"" is a smart and occasionally funny film that shows you that sometimes the most outrageous stories are the ones that are true.  Yes, this was inspired by a true story.  How close to the facts it stayed is unknown to me, but what is known is that this was a film that kept me intrigued and in awe from start to finish.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale Jr.; a young and bright kid who can con with the best of them.  How he got there is that he has learned from the best, his father.  Things get shaky when his parents are undergoing investigations from the IRS and his mother wants to get a divorce.  Not knowing what else to do, Frank runs away and tries his best to make it on his own by doing what he does best: con.  Posing in many different occupations such as an airline co-pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer triggers a cat/mouse chase conducted by FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks).  The movie keeps your attention throughout and leaves you unsure of what's going to happen next.I loved everything about this movie.  It was ten times better than I thought it would've been, mainly because the trailers do mislead you (as many have said) into thinking that you're going to be seeing a whacky chase comedy with all sorts of shenanigans and mishaps.  Well, yes it is a funny movie at times, but I don't think I would really label it as a comedy.  A lot of the things that happen in the film are actually heartbreaking and sad.  So be aware of that when you decide to buy a ticket for this one.The performances were more than ingenious.  Tom Hanks is as great as ever and really takes his role to the limit while DiCaprio also proves to be a fabulous actor as well, and also is able to show us there is life after ""Titanic.""  Everybody else was really great in the film, especially the great Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. (your eyes never leave his sight when he's on the screen).Stephen Spielberg does an outstanding job of orchestrating this wildly unpredictable film.  It doesn't always have to be sci-fi this or aliens-that when it comes to his films.  He's able to expose the heart of the story with ease in this film, not cheating us out of anything at any point during the entire movie.  I wished he'd do more films like these because he's really good at it.  Although I do love some of sci-fi films like ""Minority Report,"" I think his more realistic films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" is when you get to see his true and unique talent at its absolute best.""Catch Me if You Can"" was a pleasant surprise for me.  I did not plan on liking it as much as I did, which in itself is a pretty neat quality of the film.  Just remember that this isn't supposed to be a ""dead-on"" comedy.  There are funny and amusing moments, but some of the things you will see are actually sad in some cases.  Still, this is a very well-made movie with top notch performances that definitely deserve recognition.  Very worth your time.",5,Now You See Him...

Leonardo DiCaprio plays Abagnale, a young con artist who successfully masquerades as an airline pilot (among other professions) and passes off forged checks in the course of his travels. Tom Hanks portrays the nerdy but dedicated FBI agent who relentlessly pursues young Abagnale.""Catch Me"" opens with a great, atmospheric animated sequence that is perfectly complemented by John Williams' score. The movie as a whole is an excellent blend of suspense, human drama, and laughs. Although the film deals with some very serious themes, the tone is largely light and fun. Abagnale conducts his scams during the 1960s and the film makes superb use of period music, film, clothing, and cars: it's great fun to look at and listen to.The performances, script, and direction are first rate. The story is told in a very effective non-chronological fashion. DiCaprio shines in this lead role; he brings a nice mix of charm, brains, and boyish enthusiasm to the character. Hanks' likeable character is an excellent foil for DiCaprio's. Special mention should be made of Christopher Walken's witty yet touching performance as young Abagnale's father.

605263,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JLSB,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[0, 1]","It is very hard for a director to make a truly great film today but it is even harder for a director to make two great films in one year. One director who is trying to do this is already known to be one of the greats: Steven Spielberg. Spielberg, who in years past brought us such classics as Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T., earlier this year directed the critically praised Minority Report. Unfortunately the film seemed to gather more media attention over the box office battle it had with Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch more then anything else. Now after directing box office draw Tom Cruise, Mr. Spielberg hopes to breathe new box office life into the ailing career of Leonardo DiCaprio by having star opposite Oscar winning actor, Tom Hanks. Will the experiment work and show that Spielberg still has the directing spark he had many years ago or will this be one of the few flaws in his career?The film follows the amazing and emotionally driven life of Frank Abagnale Jr. from his late childhood to the present day. At the beginning of the film, Frank Abagnale Jr. lives a normal life with his parents in a beautiful home but things quickly change. When his father runs into trouble with the IRS, the family is forced to move into a small apartment. This leads to Frank's mother cheating on her husband and eventually his parents divorce. Frank, alone and confused, can't handle this anymore and runs away from home. But things begin to look up as Abagnale makes a decent living for himself by disguising himself as an airline pilot and thus being declared the James Bond of the skies. Unfortunately Frank can't keep the job for long as his must keep moving so that a FBI agent named Carl Hanratty can't catch him. Hanratty is a very serious and determined man who will do anything just to place the cuffs on this little criminal mastermind. The plot for Catch Me If You Can, which is based on a true story, was very well done though it felt weighted in moments. There were several sequences that probably weren't necessary for the feature while the ending came off as being too long and flat compared to the rest of the film.All characters in the film were based on real life people and the cast does a magnificent job of presenting a delightful true life film. It wasn't much of a stretch for Leonardo DiCaprio, who takes the lead role as Frank Abagnale Jr., to play the ladies man but it has been quite some time since he played such a young character as the one he plays here. Frank Abagnale Jr. is a confused, lonely young man who continues the chase with Agent Hanratty not because he loves it but that he needs it. He needs the cat and mouse game with Agent Hanratty as well as the conversations he has with over the phone on Christmas to fill the void he is missing with his family. Quite surprisingly DiCaprio pulls off being a young character and shows great acting ability expressing this character. Agent Hanratty may not be an Oscar winning performance for Tom Hanks but does seem to be a role that he has a lot of fun with. Christopher Walken is fabulous as Frank Abagnale Sr. and really plays off Leonardo DiCaprio in the conversations the two characters have together. It is a shame that his character us not given as good of a send off as he should have had but it is not such a big deal. And Jennifer Garner, as gifted an actress as she may be, seems pointless in this film as her character doesn't really do anything overall for the feature.Overall, Catch Me If You Can is another good offering from the creative directing genius of Steven Spielberg but certainly isn't one of his greatest and not even close to the creativity of Minority Report earlier this year. The film is certainly a great diversion from the usual dramatic fares but Catch Me seems too slow and flat in portions of the feature. Besides those squabbles, everything else seems to click especially from the cast with the exception of Jennifer Garner's character, which has more to do with her character not really doing anything and not her acting ability. Catch Me If You Can is a nice film, though, for people to relax in without having to waste a very long time with or being too blown away with elaborate special effects. Catch this film, if you can.

605265,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JLSB,Miles D. Moore,"[5, 6]","It's easy to see ""Catch Me if You Can"" as Spielberg Lite. Certainly it's ridiculous to compare it with such grave, portentous films as ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and it doesn't call for a fraction of the technical wizardry of ""E.T."" or the Indiana Jones flicks. Nevertheless, in its sprightly elegance and moments of unexpected poignancy, ""Catch Me if You Can"" is as fine a movie as Spielberg has ever made. The themes of home and belonging are crucial to Spielberg--""E.T. phone home"" could be the epigraph to his entire career. Beneath the cat-and-mouse game played by teenage con man Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is an intense longing on the part of both men for human connection, which they find unexpectedly in each other. Setting the action on successive Christmases was a master stroke, casting in bas relief the essential loneliness of both men. ""Catch Me if You Can"" would make a great double bill with Spielberg's first feature, ""The Sugarland Express,"" another film about an epic police chase and the need for home.  Of course you probably won't think about any of this while watching the movie; you'll be too busy laughing at DiCaprio's chutzpah and Machiavellian cleverness, and at Hanks' grumpy, Sad Sack attempts to trap him. The two leads, of course, are wonderful--DiCaprio in particular plays his role the way Yo-Yo Ma plays his cello--but the standout is Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr., shedding his usual creepy persona in a moving portrayal of a man whose essential optimism is slowly ground into the dirt. Frankly, the film could stand to lose about 15 minutes at the end, but it's built up so much good will up to that point that most audiences won't mind.

FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) doggedly pursues Frank as he successfully impersonates an air line pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer, living the life of a playboy and cashing ingeniously forged checks all along the way.""Catch Me If You Can"" was directed by Stephen Spielberg and, along with Minority Report, signifies a revival of Spielberg's directing talent after fifteen years of mediocre-at-best filmmaking. This film is fairly light fare, but it is immensely entertaining, funny, touching, and impeccably cast. Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a perfect fit for Leonardo DiCaprio, and is probably his best role since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". Tom Hanks seems to have abandoned his typically saccharine roles this year -much to his credit- and puts in a wonderful performance as sympathetic geeky G-man Carl Hanratty (along with a terrific showing in ""Road to Perdition""). Christopher Walken was the only actor to receive an Oscar nomination for ""Catch Me If You Can"". His performance as Frank Abagnale, Sr., our protagonist's down-and-out father, deserved the honor. Frank Jr.'s awkward combination of admiration and pity for his father seems to have been a key motivator in his illustrious life of crime, and Christopher Walken really helps us understand that.The real Frank Abagnale, Jr. is a successful security consultant these days, protecting businesses from white collar crime. He cooperated with and bascially likes the film, but is quick to point out that ""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on his biography of the same name that was written about 25 years ago. Mr. Abagnale says that some aspects of his experiences were exaggerated in that book and some have been altered for the movie as well. Whatever the inaccuracies, Frank Abagnale, Jr.'s immense intelligence, ambition, and guts are the most striking elements of the film. It's the rarity of finding all of these qualities in such abundance in one person that make Frank's character so fascinating, and make him one of cinema's most lovable antiheroes.I highly recommend ""Catch Me If You Can"" for its great performances and its extremely entertaining story of an ingenious con man and his noble pursuer...made all the more interesting because the story is largely true.",5,Immensely Entertaining.

605267,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JLSB,Mitch Weaver,"[1, 2]","Catch Me If You Can is based on the true life story of one of the most successful con artists in history - Frank Abagnale Jr. ( Leonardo Dicaprio). Frank is able to assume several different identities including a Secret Service agent, an airline pilot, a doctor, and a history professor to cash more than $2.5 million in fraudulent checks in the United States, as well as 26 other countries.  Carl Hanratty ( Tom Hanks) is the lead FBI agent in the Checks Fraud division that is tracking Abagnale, and is determined to take him down no matter what. ""Catch Me If You Can"" takes us on an exciting and extremely entertaining cat and mouse chase between the two men.""Catch Me If You Can"" is without a doubt the best film I have seen in the last couple of years. The film's screenplay was an extremely accurate adaptation of the book that was written by Frank himself. The story was absolutely perfect to bring to the big screen, simply because of how successfull Frank was. He managed to accomplish everything before he was 19. The overall direction from Stephen Spielberg was amazing. The film is paced extremely well, and even though it is almost 2 1/2 hours running, the film never seems long or drawn out. The set designs were also extremely authentic, and Spielberg was able to get the best performances possible out of the actors.The overall cast was just great in this movie. Each actor was the perfect choice for their particular role. I am not a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. But I must admit, that he turned in an outstanding performance and captured the true essance of Frank Abignale Jr. He is cunning, intelligent, and witty. This let him play the different identities of lawyer, teacher, doctor, etc, so convincingly. Tom Hanks was brilliant as Carl Hanratty. He will amaze you with the determination he gives in tracking Abignale. Hanks will also make you laugh because of his Boston accent, and also because of how extremely naive he can be at times. At one point, Abignale is able to convince Carl that he is a Secret Service agent working on the case. Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Jennifer Gardner ( TV's ""Alias""), and the rest of the cast put in top notch performances as well. Finally, the film is extremely fun to watch and down right hillarious. I was laughing for the majority of the film, and I actually had a good time watching Frank from one moment to the next.""Catch Me If You Can"" was easily the best film of 2002. The film provides - an extremely authentic portrayal of Frank Abignale Jr.'s life, wonderful performances, masterful directing from Spielberg, and non-stop laughs. Not to mention the DVD has some pretty good extras as well.

Of course, with his check bouncing the FBI gets involved and one of their best, Tom Hanks character, has to find Leo.

I would agree to an extent with the Amazon reviewer who claimed this film to be ""shallow"", but then I think that was the whole point.  Spielberg's big successes over the last decade have been the likes of `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan'; very thought heavy, serious films, I think on this one he just wanted to relax and make a movie that would entertain.  And there's nothing wrong with that, after all, doesn't he deserve to more than anyone else?It is the films three leading performances that make the film such a joy to watch.  Leonardo Di Caprio very much suits the role of the conman Frank Abagnale  and delivers a better performance than he does in `Gangs of New York'.  The underrated Christopher Walken is also superbly witty as Abagnale's father, and as FBI agent Hanratty, Tom Hanks is as brilliant as ever.  And to top it all off, there is a cameo from the beautiful Jennifer Garner.I have to admit, the film did start very lightly, and I thought this movie was going to be a real flop, but thankfully I was proved wrong.  After fifteen or so minutes, it really got going, and stayed at that level for the rest of the film.  Most of the joy from the film came from watching Abagnale perform and get away with feigning as someone he isn't.I would say that this was my favourite movie of 2002, and I preferred it to Spielberg's last film `Minority Report'.

Tom Hanks plays geeky FBI Agent and nemesis to Di Capprio's devil-may-care con-kid (not really a con-man, since Dicapprio's character starts doing all these crazy things at the age of seventeen).  It is effortless and free as the story uhnfolds, not answering a whole lot of questions that might pop up.  Hmmmm.  Being that this is ""Based On A True Story"" does make it a bit more interesting.  All in all...a good weeknight sitdown movie.  Something to watch after a heart-attack MNF game to take the edge off the day.  Nothing extra-extra-special here.  Certainly not Speileberg's best effort.  But DiCapprio shines and so does Tom Hanks and that makes up for some lackluster script strains.  The fact that this guy actually impersonated a pilot, a doctor, and a state prossecutor as well as floated over $4 million in bogus checks in the mid-to-late 60's is very impressive.Dig it!",4,Spielberg Can't Go Wrong ...

Doyle ""film buff""","[1, 1]","There's a lot to like in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN--the handsome production values, the unobtrusive John Williams score, the performances by a first-rate cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Charlie Sheen, Christopher Walken) and the fact that it's based on the amazing story of a young man who fooled authorities with forgeries and impersonations over a long period of time.Makes me recall the Tony Curtis film, THE GREAT IMPOSTER ('61), which told the same sort of amazing story with a lot more exuberance. Somehow events never seem quite so extraordinary in the way that they unfold in this reenactment of a true story. Only a few times does the urgency of DiCaprio's escape from the man chasing him really involve the audience.Don't ask me why--but there's not enough punch to the proceedings and perhaps this is where John Williams with his ""nice"" score fails to take the drama seriously. Instead of accompanying the more gripping moments with dramatic bursts of music, he instead goes for a quieter, sophisticated sound closer to the bland '60s sound of cocktail music. Somehow this deadens the impact or seriousness of the crimes being depicted and gives the whole movie a bland quality that is out of place. I never thought I'd be criticizing a John Williams score for being bland but so be it.The performances can't be faulted--Tom Hanks is especially good as the F.B.I. man and DiCaprio does a highly competent job as the misguided youth. Christopher Walken makes the father an interesting character.Nevertheless, it IS an amazing story--this man had to be brilliant to pull off what he did--in an age where counterfeit checks and IDs are scrutinized as carefully as they are most of the time, it seems highly unlikely that such a ruse could happen in the light of today's heightened high security--or is it??",4,Good entertainment--but should have been better...,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1812,"['lot', 'like', 'CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'handsome', 'production', 'values', 'unobtrusive', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'performances', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'fact', 'based', 'amazing', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'fooled', 'authorities', 'forgeries', 'impersonations', 'long', 'period', 'time.Makes', 'recall', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'film', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'IMPOSTER', 'told', 'same', 'sort', 'amazing', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'exuberance', 'Somehow', 'events', 'never', 'seem', 'quite', 'so', 'extraordinary', 'way', 'unfold', 'reenactment', 'true', 'story', 'Only', 'few', 'times', 'urgency', 'DiCaprio', 'escape', 'man', 'chasing', 'really', 'involve', 'audience.Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'not', 'enough', 'punch', 'proceedings', 'perhaps', 'where', 'John', 'Williams', 'nice', 'score', 'take', 'drama', 'seriously', 'Instead', 'accompanying', 'more', 'gripping', 'moments', 'dramatic', 'bursts', 'music', 'instead', 'quieter', 'sophisticated', 'sound', 'closer', 'bland', 'sound', 'cocktail', 'music', 'Somehow', 'impact', 'seriousness', 'crimes', 'being', 'depicted', 'whole', 'movie', 'bland', 'quality', 'place', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'criticizing', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'being', 'bland', 'so', 'be', 'it.The', 'performances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'especially', 'good', 'F.B.I', 'man', 'DiCaprio', 'highly', 'competent', 'job', 'misguided', 'youth', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'father', 'interesting', 'character.Nevertheless', 'amazing', 'story', 'man', 'had', 'be', 'brilliant', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'did', 'age', 'where', 'counterfeit', 'checks', 'IDs', 'are', 'scrutinized', 'as', 'carefully', 'are', 'most', 'time', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'ruse', 'could', 'happen', 'light', 'today', 'heightened', 'high', 'security']",Catch Me If You Can

I have to admit that the film was kind of long (that is what you would expect from a Steven Spielberg film), but it really didn't matter just as long as the film was good, and man was it ever! The performances from Leonardo DiCaprio (""Titanic"") and 2-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks (""Cast Away"") just couldn't be better! The true-life story of ""Catch Me If You Can"" focuses on Frank Abagnale, Jr. (DiCaprio), a teen growing up outside of New York. His father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken in an outstanding performance) is being investigated by the IRS for maybe some back taxes and such. And the lives of Frank Jr., Frank Sr., and Frank's mother/Frank's wife, Paula (Nathalie Baye) take a turn for the worse. When Frank Jr. finds out that his whole life is in a bit of a shambles, he does the unthinkable...he embarks on a journey of impersonation and fraud by becoming a doctor, a lawyer, and an airline pilot. Not to mention that Frank has also cashed some fraudulent checks, in which the banks lost $4 million in the process...and he did it all before his 19th birthday. This case has attracted the attention of an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty (Hanks), who is determined to bring Frank to justice...if he can catch Frank first! The direction of Steven Spielberg was just as outstanding as when he directed ""Minority Report"" and the ""Indiana Jones"" films! The scenes in ""Catch Me If You Can"" were hilarious, especially the scenes when Leo's character outsmarts Hanks' character throughout the film, such as when Frank hires some ""stewardesses"" to escort him throughout the airport without being caught by Frank and his FBI boys. In conclusion, ""Catch Me If You Can"" has great performances from 2 celebrated actors, a great supporting cast (Christopher Walken, Amy Adams, Nathalie Baye, James Brolin, and Jennifer Garner), lots of humor, powerful storytelling, and a great soundtrack! Whenever people see ""Catch Me If You Can"", I just hope that they can get by with Tom Hanks' JFK-like accent in the movie, I know that I did!

It starts at Christmas of 1963, Frank is a 15 year-old kid who lives with his mom and dad who are happily married, but things changes when his father goes out of business because his company is under investigation by the governement. The family goes to live in an apartment in a poor neighborhood. Frank changes school and when he arrives at his new school, he passes himself as the teacher. Then his mother, who is having an affair with a friend of her husband, decides to divorce. The lawyer ask Frank to choose if he is going to live with his mother or his father. He decides to run away with his check book that his father gave to him for his 16th birthday. When he gots nothing left in his account, he starts giving bad checks. Then, he sees a pilot on the street and it gives him the idea to become a pilot. He starts by going to Panam and pretend to be a kid making a report for his school paper. He gets information on how to become a pilot and the identification he needs. Then, he calls to the company and says that he lost his suit on the plane and asks where he can get another one. He gets his suit and the guy only ask him for his Pilot number, so he gots the suit and he starts cashing checks around the USA in different banks.  Meanwhile, F.B.I. Investigator Carl Henratty is on the trail of Frank, so Frank changes his name and profession, He meets a girl he likes and ask her to marry him, she accepts and he becomes a lawyer working for her father. But, he made a mistake because he can no longer change his name if he is married, because she would not stay married to a crook. So, Frank goes to Europe and spends a couple of years there before being caught around Christmas of 1967. Then, he goes to jail in France for 2 years and goes back to the United States around Christmas of 1969. He is sentenced to 12 years in jail and stays friend with Carl Henratty who while visiting Frank in 1970, discovers that Frank could work for the F.B.I. Finally, in 1974, Carl convinces the F.B.I. to release Frank from jail and make him work for the governement for the rest of his sentence. Since then, Frank has been paid millions of dollars from the governement for having captured some the best crooks in the world and he designed some checks for banks around the world.

605285,A3DYIGOLWS5CNS,B00005JLSB,Niel Rishoi,"[5, 5]","This is one of the best, most purely enjoyable efforts from all concerned - producer/ director, stars.  It is a movie about a criminal, but so hilariously charming, you actually find yourself rooting for the anti-hero, Frank Abagnale.  Spielberg hits the bulls-eye in his presentation and laying out of the movie: there is a pure, giddy, adolescent gleefulness in how Di Caprio's Frank carries out his comically nefarious schemes and swindles. It's a movie for the kid in all of us: how many of us have not dreamt that we'd (as teenagers) liked to have scammed our way through scores of money, beautiful adult women, and take on some of the world's most illustrious professions with insolent ease? And not getting busted by mom and dad?Caprio exhibits so much skill and charm in his role, that we actually look forward to what new outrageous scheme he will conjure up next. This is one of Caprio's most dexterous and instinctive performances: his likability is much more believable and lacking the contrivances of his Titanic character.

605286,A295OPF6HX7XFP,B00005JLSB,Oldest & Wisest,"[3, 6]","I read the book ""Catch Me If You Can"" by Frank Abagnale at least 20 years ago and found it one of the most entertaining books I've ever read, all about the fascinating exploits of a teenage con man who managed to pass himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, an attorney, while managing to steal millions of dollars by forging checks.  So when I heard that no less than Stephen Spielberg was going to make a movie out of it, I was really looking forward to seeing it.Big disappointment.  First, there is the problem with the miscasting of the main character.  In his book, Frank Abagnale specifically states that one of the reason that people were willing to accept a teenager as an authority figure like a pilot or an attorney was being he was unusually large and tall for his age.  This is not a description of Leonardo DiCaprio, a little pixie, who must be at least in his late 20s now, but could still pass for a high school freshman.  If Leo tried to make somebody think he was any kind of a professional person, the only logical response would from them be to say, ""Aren't you going to say 'Trick of Treat?'""Second, this book cried out to be filmed as a gay romp, showing us the great life Frank gained with his lies and stolen money, until that point when the forces of the law inevitably caught up with him and he was severely punished.  In the book, Frank never indicates that he felt at all ambivalent about what he was doing until he was arrested.Not so in the movie, where we are presented with a portrayal of Frank as a tortured soul bearing the great psychological burden of having parents who got divorced (along with half the other kids in the US) which drove him to commit these crimes.  (By the way, the book never portrayed his father as a con man either, so the like father, like son dynamic depicted on screen is another complete fabrication.)  Why does someone lie and steal?  Duh!  To get the nice things in life without having to work for them, idiot.In short, this movie is a massive missfire.  Too bad, it could have been something special.Nice opening titles, though.  Very clever.  Just parodied on a SIMPSONS episode, by the way.",2,Read the book?

605287,A2VK365XEVCYC8,B00005JLSB,One More Option,"[2, 6]","Spielberg's most recent films have emphasized ethical questions. This movie looks at some of these questions and more:- Is it ethical or healthy to ask a child to choose one parent as more primary and beloved than another?  The boy is asked to ""just pick one"" of his parents to have primary custody of him.  This tears him apart and faced with the choice of choosing only one as primary, he runs.- When your real parents do not provide you with solutions that make sense, is it okay to choose other father figures who do make sense?  When Frank Abagnale, Jr. finally encounters a man who loves him more like a father should, is it okay for Frank to choose to emulate him more than he emulated his own father?- Why would a man like FBI Agent Carl Hanratty care so much about someone who wasn't even a friend or family member?- Who should you honor?  How should you act?  How should you pursue wealth?  These are key questions this movie explores.The cognitive framework of ""No slave can serve two masters, for he will either love one and hate the other, or hate the one and love the other"" is a foundational concept for some people.  It is a concept followed to support their religious, patriotic, and military exclusive loyalties.  This type of thinking scares me and misleads others.  The irony is that slaves don't serve one master. Any society that supports slavery ends up requiring slaves to serve many masters.  Slaves are subservient to most any member of the preferred class.  Further, slaves get very little discretion as to who they are allowed to love and who they are allowed to hate.  Those choices are dictated for them.The ""No slave can serve two masters"" is a principle discussed originally in relation to the pursuit of wealth.  On its face, it suggests that a person cannot act like a slave in relation to the pursuit of wealth.  If they are a slave to God, then they must hate the pursuit of wealth. This makes no sense to me.  As if slaves had too many advantages already.  Now they're not supposed to even love the pursuit of wealth?  Wealth can be defined as a state of being rich; prosperous; affluent.  Wealth generally means that you have worked hard to protect your family by storing up resources and making alliances, reducing their susceptibility to hunger and desperate circumstances.  The pursuit of wealth is usually a healthy thing for poor people to pursue.  We all balance many competing interests.  And to pursue one interest does not mean you have to hate all the other interests that may compete with the one interest.  That type of thinking destroys relationships, progress, and health.Adam was supposedly kicked out of Eden because he sought knowledge beyond what ""God"" told him to consider - he ate from the tree of good and evil, the tree of knowledge.  I gotta tell ya - most days, I follow Eve's tempations and try another fruit.  I think both Frank Abagnale Jr. and Steven Spielberg do too.  Pick a cliche a day to refine away.When people are no longer treated like slaves, nor expected to act like slaves, things improve.  Whenever I hear concepts based on ""No slave can serve to masters"" thinking patterns, I remember my parents.  Unlike Frank Abagnale Jr., I had extraordinary parents.  They divorced when I was a toddler.  They NEVER asked me to love one of them more than the other.  By both of their words and actions, they taught me two principles:  A good parent, when asked to love one family member as more primary than another, declines that offer.  A good parent communicates equal love to all their children.  Maybe a slave can't serve two masters who have different and conflicting priorities, but a beloved child sure can.  Children can sometimes find ways to love both, ways that adults have trouble finding.  Both in the movie and in life, Frank Abagnale Jr. eventually found ways to love and honor both his parents and the strange and unusual FBI agent Carl Hanratty.",5,"Ethics of Love, Loyalty and Honor",1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,3929,"['Spielberg', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'emphasized', 'ethical', 'questions', 'movie', 'questions', 'more', 'ethical', 'healthy', 'ask', 'child', 'choose', 'one', 'parent', 'more', 'primary', 'beloved', 'boy', 'asked', 'just', 'pick', 'one', 'parents', 'have', 'primary', 'custody', 'apart', 'faced', 'choice', 'choosing', 'only', 'one', 'primary', 'When', 'real', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'solutions', 'make', 'sense', 'choose', 'other', 'father', 'figures', 'who', 'do', 'make', 'sense', 'When', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'finally', 'man', 'who', 'more', 'father', 'should', 'okay', 'Frank', 'choose', 'emulate', 'more', 'emulated', 'own', 'father', 'Why', 'would', 'man', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'someone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'friend', 'family', 'member', 'Who', 'should', 'honor', 'How', 'should', 'act', 'How', 'should', 'pursue', 'wealth', 'are', 'key', 'questions', 'movie', 'cognitive', 'framework', 'slave', 'can', 'serve', 'two', 'masters', 'will', 'love', 'one', 'hate', 'other', 'hate', 'one', 'love', 'other', 'foundational', 'concept', 'people', 'concept', 'followed', 'support', 'religious', 'patriotic', 'military', 'exclusive', 'loyalties', 'type', 'thinking', 'scares', 'others', 'irony', 'slaves', 'do', ""n't"", 'serve', 'one', 'master', 'society', 'slavery', 'up', 'requiring', 'slaves', 'serve', 'many', 'masters', 'Slaves', 'are', 'subservient', 'most', 'member', 'preferred', 'class', 'Further', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'discretion', 'who', 'are', 'allowed', 'love', 'who', 'are', 'allowed', 'hate', 'choices', 'are', 'dictated', 'them.The', 'slave', 'can', 'serve', 'two', 'masters', 'principle', 'discussed', 'originally', 'relation', 'pursuit', 'wealth', 'face', 'person', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'slave', 'relation', 'pursuit', 'wealth', 'are', 'slave', 'God', 'then', 'must', 'hate', 'pursuit', 'wealth', 'sense', 'slaves', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'advantages', 'already', 'Now', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'even', 'love', 'pursuit', 'wealth', 'Wealth', 'can', 'be', 'defined', 'state', 'being', 'rich', 'prosperous', 'affluent', 'Wealth', 'generally', 'have', 'worked', 'hard', 'protect', 'family', 'storing', 'up', 'resources', 'making', 'alliances', 'reducing', 'susceptibility', 'hunger', 'desperate', 'circumstances', 'pursuit', 'wealth', 'usually', 'healthy', 'thing', 'poor', 'people', 'pursue', 'balance', 'many', 'competing', 'interests', 'pursue', 'one', 'interest', 'not', 'mean', 'have', 'hate', 'other', 'interests', 'may', 'compete', 'one', 'interest', 'type', 'thinking', 'destroys', 'relationships', 'progress', 'health.Adam', 'was', 'supposedly', 'kicked', 'Eden', 'sought', 'knowledge', 'what', 'God', 'told', 'consider', 'ate', 'tree', 'good', 'evil', 'tree', 'knowledge', 'got', 'ta', 'tell', 'ya', 'most', 'days', 'follow', 'Eve', 'tempations', 'try', 'fruit', 'think', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'do', 'too', 'Pick', 'cliche', 'day', 'refine', 'away.When', 'people', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'treated', 'slaves', 'expected', 'act', 'slaves', 'things', 'improve', 'Whenever', 'hear', 'concepts', 'based', 'slave', 'can', 'serve', 'masters', 'thinking', 'patterns', 'remember', 'parents', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'had', 'extraordinary', 'parents', 'divorced', 'when', 'was', 'toddler', 'NEVER', 'asked', 'love', 'one', 'more', 'other', 'words', 'actions', 'taught', 'two', 'principles', 'good', 'parent', 'when', 'asked', 'love', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'more', 'primary', 'offer', 'good', 'parent', 'communicates', 'equal', 'love', 'children', 'Maybe', 'slave', 'ca', ""n't"", 'serve', 'two', 'masters', 'who', 'have', 'different', 'conflicting', 'priorities', 'beloved', 'child', 'sure', 'can', 'Children', 'can', 'sometimes', 'find', 'ways', 'love', 'ways', 'adults', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'movie', 'life', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'eventually', 'found', 'ways', 'love', 'honor', 'parents', 'strange', 'unusual', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty']",Catch Me If You Can

605289,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00005JLSB,Patrick L. Randall,"[2, 3]","December is typically the time of year that movie studios release all of their 'serious' movies just in time to be considered for Oscar nominations.  While this invariably leads to wealth of excellent films to see, most of them are exactly 'fun' to watch.  ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a welcome break from the dour natures of the films this time of year and is a very entertaining viewing experience.  In fact, if it were not for the Academy of Motion Pictures disdain for comedies and multi-genre films (this would qualify is a 'dramedy'), ""Catch Me..."" might have a shot at a few Oscars, too.""Catch Me If You Can"" tells the real-life story of one of the most unlikely, accomplished con artists in U.S. History, Frank Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio).  Abagnale was responsible for impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor, an assistant attorney general, a history professor, and forging $2.5 million in counterfeit checks.  The real kicker is that he did all this before he even reached the age of 18!  Ironically, Abagnale currently is one of the most sought after experts by banks and business when it comes to check fraud and developing methods to guard against it.  Although there are likely some embellishments to enhance the dramatic value of this movie, ""Catch Me..."" by and large sticks closely to facts of the story.In the movie, Abagnale (DiCaprio) first realizes his gift for the con when, at a new school, he takes advantage of a substitute teacher's tardiness and impersonates being a teacher, himself.  It's not important that he didn't have that much greater knowledge over the class material than they other students.  What was important was that he had the charisma and charm to make the rest of the class think he did.  A key scene early in the movie takes place when Abagnale's parents are called to the principal's office because the school found out about Frank's scam.  Instead of coming down hard on Frank, his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (played with understated grace by Christopher Walken), jokes with his son about it and almost seems proud of it.  Frank Sr., unfortunately, is one of those lost souls in life, who seems to have the perfect American family, but is really more of a loser who is watching all he worked for come unraveled (a failing business and a failing marriage).  Frank Sr. seems proud of Frank Jr. because the younger has the ability to actually pull off the scams that the older tries and fails to do.  It's a very telling moment, because it foreshadows the motivation for the path in life Frank Jr. would take because Frank Sr. chose to be a cheerleader rather than a father.After his parents divorce, Frank Jr. decides to run away and use his 'skill' to make a living.  This is where ""Catch Me..."" takes the audience on a long journey through the various professions and scams of Abagnale's mentioned above.  To be able to fund his 'adventures', Frank uses his intelligence and charm to discover all manner of ways to get false checks cashed.  As he becomes more adept at this task, he also attracts the attention of FBI Check Fraud division and agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).  Abagnale begins to move across the country and pick up new professions while managing to stay one step ahead of, but still in contact with, agent Hanratty.  The irony of Hanratty's pursuit of Abagnale is that Hanratty understands Frank better than Frank does, at least in terms why he is doing these scams.  In trying to stop Frank and help him rehabilitate himself, Hanratty becomes the father figure that Frank Sr. never was.""Catch Me If You Can"" is simply one of those funs movies that make the movie going experience worthwhile.  Hanks plays agent Hanratty well as somewhat clumsy, stodgy, and determined pursuer.  Walken gives what could (and should) be an award-winning performance as Frank Sr.  The true pleasant surprise here, though, is Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Jr.  After years of self-important behavior and an almost total disappearance from big screen in the aftermath of ""Titanic's"" massive hype machine, it's nice to see DiCaprio back as a likable character in a good role.  He has probably learned his lessons about what fame can do and, combined with his role in ""Gangs of New York"", has likely signaled a return to the successful acting career many people expected of him from his earliest days.  In concert with the other fine performances, DiCaprio helps make ""Catch Me If You Can"" a cinematic treat.",4,Catch this movie if you can!,1043193600,"01 22, 2003",2003,4474,"['December', 'typically', 'time', 'year', 'movie', 'studios', 'release', ""'serious"", 'movies', 'just', 'time', 'be', 'considered', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'invariably', 'wealth', 'excellent', 'films', 'see', 'most', 'are', 'exactly', ""'fun"", 'watch', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'welcome', 'break', 'dour', 'natures', 'films', 'time', 'year', 'very', 'entertaining', 'viewing', 'experience', 'fact', 'were', 'not', 'Academy', 'Motion', 'Pictures', 'disdain', 'comedies', 'multi-genre', 'films', 'would', 'qualify', ""'dramedy"", 'Catch', 'Me', 'might', 'have', 'shot', 'few', 'Oscars', 'too', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'tells', 'real-life', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'unlikely', 'accomplished', 'con', 'artists', 'U.S.', 'History', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'played', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'Abagnale', 'was', 'responsible', 'impersonating', 'airline', 'pilot', 'doctor', 'assistant', 'attorney', 'general', 'history', 'professor', 'forging', '2.5', 'million', 'counterfeit', 'checks', 'real', 'kicker', 'did', 'even', 'reached', 'age', '18', 'Ironically', 'Abagnale', 'currently', 'one', 'most', 'sought', 'experts', 'banks', 'business', 'when', 'check', 'fraud', 'developing', 'methods', 'guard', 'are', 'likely', 'embellishments', 'enhance', 'dramatic', 'value', 'movie', 'Catch', 'Me', 'large', 'sticks', 'closely', 'facts', 'story.In', 'movie', 'Abagnale', 'DiCaprio', 'first', 'gift', 'con', 'when', 'new', 'school', 'advantage', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'tardiness', 'being', 'teacher', 'not', 'important', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'greater', 'knowledge', 'class', 'material', 'other', 'students', 'What', 'was', 'important', 'was', 'had', 'charisma', 'charm', 'make', 'rest', 'class', 'think', 'did', 'key', 'scene', 'early', 'movie', 'place', 'when', 'Abagnale', 'parents', 'are', 'called', 'principal', 'office', 'school', 'found', 'out', 'Frank', 'scam', 'Instead', 'coming', 'down', 'hard', 'Frank', 'father', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Sr.', 'played', 'understated', 'grace', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'jokes', 'son', 'almost', 'proud', 'Frank', 'Sr.', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'lost', 'souls', 'life', 'who', 'have', 'perfect', 'American', 'family', 'really', 'more', 'loser', 'who', 'watching', 'all', 'worked', 'come', 'unraveled', 'failing', 'business', 'failing', 'marriage', 'Frank', 'Sr.', 'proud', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'younger', 'ability', 'actually', 'pull', 'off', 'scams', 'older', 'tries', 'fails', 'do', 'very', 'telling', 'moment', 'motivation', 'path', 'life', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'would', 'take', 'Frank', 'Sr.', 'chose', 'be', 'cheerleader', 'rather', 'father.After', 'parents', 'divorce', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'run', 'away', 'use', ""'skill"", 'make', 'living', 'where', 'Catch', 'Me', 'audience', 'long', 'journey', 'various', 'professions', 'scams', 'Abagnale', 'mentioned', 'above', 'be', 'able', 'fund', ""'adventures"", 'Frank', 'intelligence', 'charm', 'discover', 'manner', 'ways', 'get', 'false', 'checks', 'cashed', 'more', 'adept', 'task', 'also', 'attention', 'FBI', 'Check', 'Fraud', 'division', 'agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Abagnale', 'move', 'country', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'professions', 'managing', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'still', 'contact', 'agent', 'Hanratty', 'irony', 'Hanratty', 'pursuit', 'Abagnale', 'Hanratty', 'Frank', 'better', 'Frank', 'least', 'terms', 'why', 'doing', 'scams', 'trying', 'stop', 'Frank', 'help', 'rehabilitate', 'Hanratty', 'father', 'figure', 'Frank', 'Sr.', 'never', 'was', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'simply', 'one', 'funs', 'movies', 'make', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'worthwhile', 'Hanks', 'agent', 'Hanratty', 'well', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'stodgy', 'determined', 'pursuer', 'Walken', 'what', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'award-winning', 'performance', 'Frank', 'Sr', 'true', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'here', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'performance', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'years', 'self-important', 'behavior', 'almost', 'total', 'disappearance', 'big', 'screen', 'aftermath', 'Titanic', 'massive', 'hype', 'machine', 'nice', 'see', 'DiCaprio', 'back', 'likable', 'character', 'good', 'role', 'probably', 'learned', 'lessons', 'what', 'fame', 'can', 'do', 'combined', 'role', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'likely', 'signaled', 'return', 'successful', 'acting', 'career', 'many', 'people', 'expected', 'earliest', 'days', 'concert', 'other', 'fine', 'performances', 'DiCaprio', 'make', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'cinematic', 'treat']",Catch Me If You Can

It had everything:  crime, a suave leading man, a FBI manhunt, and a story not found in school-issued history books.  Sure, some liberties were taken under the name of ""artistic license"", but I'm willing to let that go.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who embarks on a multi-million-dollar fraud spree across the United States and Europe.  All the while, he is pursued by serious, hard-working FBI agent and check fraud expert Carl Hanratty, played by Tom Hanks.  But this cat and mouse game is only half of this movie's fun as, while he is passing fake checks, Frank impersonates, among other things, an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.  He also seduces various women, including the then-unknown Amy Adams, who plays a nurse in a Georgia hospital who becomes Frank's fianc&eacute;e for a time.  Seriously, how can having Amy Adams in a film ever be a bad thing?  Well, Miss Adams stands among many fine talents in this film, including Christopher Walken, who steers clear of any comedy in this film and performs quite naturally even without it, and Martin Sheen, who, like Amy Adams, can do no wrong in my eyes, though it is nice to see him actually making an effort to do no wrong and succeeding in that venture.  In fact, none of the cast go wrong in this film.  Even characters who we see on the screen for five minutes or less are enjoyable to watch and that just adds to how worthwhile this film is.  As for the changes made to the truth under ""artistic license"", I'm just gonna overlook those and give this film my praise and full recommendation.

605293,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00005JLSB,Ping Lim,"[1, 2]","This movie is not a standard &quot;cop catches a thief&quot; story.  I don't think Steven Spielberg wants us to dislike or hate the thief and that, we want justice to be done towards the end by having the cop getting the culprit.  Rather, he shares with us Leonardo's character's family background, about his parent's divorce, about a young innocent boy that is forced to grow up too fast to fend for himself.  All along, Leonardo's character has a affectionate relationships with his father (played convincingly by the ever brilliant Christopher Walken) &amp; there is a tell-tale sign in the movie that his X-factor is passed on by his father.  Maybe, Leonardo's character enjoys acting different characters so that he can escape from reality &amp; that, he wants to make a lot of money to justify to his parents that they don't need to worry about financial security anymore &amp; that they needn't have to worry about the very thing that separates them at the first place.  That's why in the end, all we have for Leonardo's character is utmost sympathy.  Sympathy is what Tom Hank's character gives Leonardo's character &amp; maybe, that's why they share this chemistry or bond that can be read in between the lines.  It's refreshing to see Martin Sheen NOT playing US President for a change.  A truly enjoyable movie to watch &amp; an affirmation of Steven Spielberg's versatility in directing different genres of movies.

605294,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00005JLSB,P Magnum,"[2, 2]","After his dark, sci-fi work on A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, Steven Spielberg returns to more lighter fare with the engaging and entertaining Catch Me If You Can.  The film is based on the true story of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., who by the age of nineteen passes himself off as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer and cashes over four million dollars worth of fraudulent checks.  The film is told in a flashback style, opening with Frank being extricated from a French prison and brought back to the U.S. to face charges and bounces back and forth between his trip home and his exploits in the previous few years.  Leonardo DiCaprio is perfectly cast as Frank.  His boyish good looks and charm work to his advantage as the young con man.  Mr. DiCaprio gives a multi-layered performance as beneath the surface Frank is really a young man who is devastated by his parents divorce and wants only to please his father and see his parents back together again.  Mr. DiCaprio has never been better and it is certainly the equal of his Oscar nominated performance in What&#65533;s Eating Gilbert Grape.  Tom Hanks gives yet another superb performance as the dogged FBI agent Carl Hanratty who tracks Frank across the US and eventually to France where he finally captures him.  Mr. Hanks plays Carl as a by-the-numbers agent, who shows no outward mercy to Frank, but has compassion for the kid because of his situation.  Christopher Walken is excellent as well as Frank&#65533;s father, who loses everything to the IRS because of a fraud investigation.  His contempt towards the government as they strip away everything in his life is both hilarious and heartbreaking.  Mr. Walken received a deserved nomination as Best Supporting Actor in 2002.  There are other good performances by Amy Adams as a girl who Frank becomes engaged to, Martin Sheen as her father, Nathalie Baye as Frank&#65533;s French mother and Jennifer Garner has a bizarre cameo as a model who propositions Frank for an evening of pleasure.  While these performances are all since, they are mere sidebars to the triangle between Frank, Carl and Frank&#65533;s father.  The cat and mouse hunt between Frank and Carl is tension filled and briskly paced.  Mr. Spielberg keeps the action moving and he never lets you up for air.  The film has been criticized for not diving deeper into what made Frank do what he did or get in the mechanics of fraud, but that&#65533;s not the point of the film.  It is the chase between the two leads.  You know that Frank will eventually get caught, but where, when and how will it happen.  Mr. Spielberg does gloss over some issues and the film does take some liberties, most notably that is no real Carl Hanratty.  Frank did have a main contact at the FBI, but there was a large team of investigators who tracked and caught him.  But the role of Carl is needed in the film as the chase becomes personal and the emotional focus of the film.  All in all, Catch Me If You Can is perfectly crafted film, full of lively performances, a sharp script and crisp direction.  This film yet again shows why Mr. Spielberg is among the greatest directors of this or any generation.",5,Cash This Check,1052438400,"05 9, 2003",2003,3174,"['dark', 'sci-fi', 'work', 'A.I', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'more', 'lighter', 'fare', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Frank', 'W.', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'who', 'age', 'nineteen', 'passes', 'off', 'pilot', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'cashes', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'worth', 'fraudulent', 'checks', 'film', 'told', 'flashback', 'style', 'opening', 'Frank', 'being', 'extricated', 'French', 'prison', 'brought', 'back', 'U.S.', 'face', 'charges', 'bounces', 'back', 'forth', 'trip', 'home', 'exploits', 'previous', 'few', 'years', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Frank', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'charm', 'work', 'advantage', 'young', 'con', 'man', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'multi-layered', 'performance', 'beneath', 'surface', 'Frank', 'really', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'devastated', 'parents', 'divorce', 'only', 'please', 'father', 'see', 'parents', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'Mr.', 'DiCaprio', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'certainly', 'equal', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'What', '65533', 's', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'yet', 'superb', 'performance', 'dogged', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'who', 'Frank', 'US', 'eventually', 'France', 'where', 'finally', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'Carl', 'by-the-numbers', 'agent', 'who', 'outward', 'mercy', 'Frank', 'compassion', 'kid', 'situation', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'Frank', '65533', 's', 'father', 'who', 'everything', 'IRS', 'fraud', 'investigation', 'contempt', 'government', 'strip', 'away', 'everything', 'life', 'hilarious', 'heartbreaking', 'Mr.', 'Walken', 'received', 'deserved', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', '2002', 'are', 'other', 'good', 'performances', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'girl', 'who', 'Frank', 'engaged', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'father', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'Frank', '65533', 's', 'French', 'mother', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'bizarre', 'cameo', 'model', 'who', 'Frank', 'evening', 'pleasure', 'performances', 'are', 'are', 'mere', 'sidebars', 'triangle', 'Frank', 'Carl', 'Frank', '65533', 's', 'father', 'cat', 'mouse', 'hunt', 'Frank', 'Carl', 'tension', 'filled', 'briskly', 'paced', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'action', 'moving', 'never', 'up', 'air', 'film', 'been', 'criticized', 'not', 'diving', 'deeper', 'what', 'made', 'Frank', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'mechanics', 'fraud', '65533', 'not', 'point', 'film', 'chase', 'two', 'leads', 'know', 'Frank', 'will', 'eventually', 'get', 'caught', 'where', 'when', 'how', 'will', 'happen', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'gloss', 'issues', 'film', 'take', 'liberties', 'most', 'notably', 'real', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Frank', 'did', 'have', 'main', 'contact', 'FBI', 'there', 'was', 'large', 'team', 'investigators', 'who', 'tracked', 'caught', 'role', 'Carl', 'needed', 'film', 'chase', 'personal', 'emotional', 'focus', 'film', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'film', 'full', 'lively', 'performances', 'sharp', 'script', 'crisp', 'direction', 'film', 'yet', 'again', 'why', 'Mr.', 'Spielberg', 'greatest', 'directors', 'generation']",Catch Me If You Can

Frank takes his father's con-man lifestyle and turns it up to eleven, partly to run away from trouble, and partly to give his dad his Cadillac back. Life has been unfair to him--he's lost his business, his reputation and his wife. Except that as Frank spends 4 years fleeing an exuberantly filmed ticker tape parade of phony checks, he realizes that his dad was the cheater. You don't want to see it because he's so loving, but his dad charmed and manipulated the world before it ever had a chance to be fair.Frank is chased by the FBI throughout the movie, but his conflicts are all internal: the excitement of lying and the longing to be honest; the joy of creativity and the loneliness of living a lie.(Frank and Agent Handratty, both alone in the dark on Christmas Eve, when Frank tells him honestly where he is, and Handratty says, ""you don't have anyone else to call."")People watch this movie and say they loved it--but not because it was any good! Those people are wrong. This is one of the best movies ever made. Every performance is filled with charm and sincerity. The score is lively and clever but never manipulative. The cinematography is drop dead gorgeous. This movie is hosed down in light and color. It's like light and color making out for two and a half hours.Mostly, the power of this movie comes from the fact that Frank grows up while pretending to be a grownup, so all his intense coming-of-age moments are tinged with nostalgia even as he's experiencing them for the first time. No one is surprised that Spielberg does that with perfect sincerity. You might be surprised that he also makes it funny.Also, that era in the sixties that we all know was corrupt and broken inside, just underneath its veneer of side parts and big cars? That's put across with honesty, yet without any cynicism or irony.

Indeed, much like themajority of day traders on the stock markets), their luch willeventually catch up with them, in terms of the odds the long term.A major weakness in this movie, is the dated time frame in which theactivity was perpetrated, coupled with a lack of discernment in thechoice of the soundtrack, (chosing stereotypical, cheesy numbers fromthe 60's and 70's). There is also a flawed filming technique, camerawork by the Director, that not everyone will agree with. In fact, ET,Jurassic Park showed horrifically poor filming and presentation, yetthey made a ton of cash, were crowed pleasers and major attractions.Another downfall is the script, and its flawed tendency to makecomedy and clownish characterizations of a very serious matters thataffect the financial markets, human lives, entire industries andmarkets, which is counterfeiting, impersonation of other people, manyof wheom laugh all the way to the bank.Aside from those aspects, I won't hold it against the director, torelease a movie that exceeds 2 hours vs. the standard 90 mins,considering the difficulty in telling the story contained in thebook, encompassing a number of real life, biographical aspects.It's clear that the cast was exceptional, played by Di Caprio whobrings plenty of world class acting, as does Martin Sheen, ChrisWalken, raising the movie up a notch or two in quality.Reverting to the filming, there are just too many blurred, unsharp,poorly selected lighting situations for this aspect to passunnoticed, or unannoying, suggesting a TV-like technique by thetechnicians. The DVD transfer was not a real wide-screen release thatviewers were expecting, either. Also, the filming angles are much toopredictable, yet the movie does redeem itself in the odd momentsfrom its comical moments, that will show a split reaction.The final surprise, is the rhetorical matter of how someone can taketens of millions, and after 10 years or more, have nothing to showfor, as all has vanished in thin air.",3,"The cast is exceptional with a counterfeiting, identity theft script",1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2230,"['CATCH', 'ME', 'IF', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'movie', 'partly', 'rehabilitation', 'ofaddicts', 'check', 'counterfeiting', 'identity', 'theft', 'similar', 'acts', 'sosuceeding', 'reforming', 'what', 'may', 'see', 'character', 'flaw', 'ofindividuals', 'who', 'are', 'compelled', 'behavior', 'Indeed', 'much', 'themajority', 'day', 'traders', 'stock', 'markets', 'luch', 'willeventually', 'catch', 'up', 'terms', 'odds', 'long', 'term.A', 'major', 'weakness', 'movie', 'dated', 'time', 'frame', 'theactivity', 'was', 'perpetrated', 'coupled', 'lack', 'discernment', 'thechoice', 'soundtrack', 'chosing', 'stereotypical', 'cheesy', 'numbers', 'fromthe', '60', '70', 'also', 'flawed', 'filming', 'technique', 'camerawork', 'Director', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'agree', 'fact', 'ET', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'showed', 'horrifically', 'poor', 'filming', 'presentation', 'yetthey', 'made', 'ton', 'cash', 'were', 'crowed', 'pleasers', 'major', 'attractions.Another', 'downfall', 'script', 'flawed', 'tendency', 'makecomedy', 'clownish', 'characterizations', 'very', 'serious', 'matters', 'thataffect', 'financial', 'markets', 'human', 'lives', 'entire', 'industries', 'andmarkets', 'counterfeiting', 'impersonation', 'other', 'people', 'manyof', 'wheom', 'way', 'bank.Aside', 'aspects', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'director', 'torelease', 'movie', '2', 'hours', 'standard', '90', 'mins', 'considering', 'difficulty', 'telling', 'story', 'contained', 'thebook', 'encompassing', 'number', 'real', 'life', 'biographical', 'aspects.It', 'clear', 'cast', 'was', 'exceptional', 'played', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'plenty', 'world', 'class', 'acting', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'ChrisWalken', 'raising', 'movie', 'up', 'notch', 'two', 'quality.Reverting', 'filming', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'blurred', 'unsharp', 'poorly', 'selected', 'lighting', 'situations', 'aspect', 'passunnoticed', 'unannoying', 'suggesting', 'TV-like', 'technique', 'thetechnicians', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'was', 'not', 'real', 'wide-screen', 'release', 'thatviewers', 'were', 'expecting', 'Also', 'filming', 'angles', 'are', 'much', 'toopredictable', 'yet', 'movie', 'redeem', 'odd', 'momentsfrom', 'comical', 'moments', 'will', 'show', 'split', 'final', 'surprise', 'rhetorical', 'matter', 'how', 'someone', 'can', 'taketens', 'millions', '10', 'years', 'more', 'have', 'nothing', 'showfor', 'vanished', 'thin', 'air']",Catch Me If You Can

605298,A319YRDK8Y39N,B00005JLSB,"""qmlhcb""","[2, 2]","Steven Spielberg's latest film, Catch Me if You Can, is his freshest in years after a stretch of good but flawed movies. This lighthearted comedy/drama is a little different style of film then his usual sci-fi or heavy drama fare, and the change seems to have revitalized him.This true story, which sticks pretty close to fact, follows Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DeCaprio) in the 1960s as he fakes his way as an airline pilot, doctor and a lawyer while cashing thousands of forged checks. The story is hard to believe, despite its basis in fact, but Spielberg brings it very much down to earth and creates some very real characters. It is a very simple film in its nature, compared to most of Spielberg more complicated tastes, as of late. In fact, it hearkens back to his early films which displayed a more youthful vigor and passion. What he has always been best at is telling simple, magical tales about regular people getting caught up in extraordinary events, and that's what Catch Me if You Can is all about.In fact, this film seems to revitalize everyone involved. Not only is Spielberg at his highest form, DeCaprio performs far better then anything he's ever done before. He shows some true talent portraying the genius kid. He manages to upstage the great Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, something I never would have guessed was possible. Spielberg must have seen the potential in him, and helped bring it to the forefront. Also, John Williams score is breathtakingly original. As of late, the great composer has delivered some stale music that sounds much like many other scores he's done (something that happens to everyone after being in the business as long as he), but Williams here shows that he's still got the talent to produce amazing new material. The authentic 60's sound of the music captures the tone of the film perfectly, and the unique opening sequence both looks and sounds like a period production. There are a few moments where the score begins to sound like some of his other work, but Williams seems to keep it under control and these moments are only fleeting.This film is truly as near flawless as they come.

Christopher Walken plays the failed businessman-father with the heart of a gentle con.  The son takes the con part and leaves behind the gentle.  His mother is an opportunist, a French war bride, so when things go wrong, she moves on without a lot of thought or feeling for the men in her life.

The two leading actors were superb in their roles as a check forging con man (DiCaprio), and a persistent FBI agent (Hanks). Leonardo DiCaprio seems to get a bad rap from some people. They say that he plays himself in every role. I disagree. I think he's one of the premiere talents in the business today, and obviously he is. He's worked with most of the best directors making movies today. Tom Hanks is a dependable guy. We can always rest assured that he's going to bring his A-game to every project. This is no different. I feel that I must mention another great performance by Christopher Walken. Even Jennifer Garner and Amy Adams were pretty nice in their small supporting roles. Steven Spielberg is quite versatile. He has dipped his toes into just about every genre, and has done an outstanding job in most. Science Fiction, Drama, Horror, Action, Mystery, Comedy, and even Animation. What can't he do? The pacing and direction is very well done here. The movie moves along smoothly. It's not short (about two and a half hours), but never seemed lag. I also liked the camera work, and music.John Williams is the best. I say the same about Hans Zimmer, but today, John Williams is my favorite score composer. The musical themes kept making me think about Spy vs. Spy. The feeling of a cat-and-mouse chase was always present. That was the best aspect of the film. The dialogue and screenplay is great as well. It's based on a true story, and that was a surprise to me when I sat down to watch it. The subject matter is serious, but the film felt somewhat whimsical for the most part. It's not whimsical to the point of being comedic, but it still remained pretty light hearted. In other words, it was fun. But fun is not always the best thing for a movie. There are also a nice amount of scenes that get your heart rate slightly elevated. I say slightly, because it was never very thrilling. Even in the dramatic scenes, most of them ended in a light hearted way. If there was anything I would complain about in this movie, it would be that. I wanted to feel more of a fear that Frank was in danger. I never felt like what he was doing, or him getting caught by the FBI was dangerous. That whimsy ended up plaguing the entire film for me.

Directed by Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can is mostly based on the autobiography of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., played by Leonardo DiCaprio. His performance is adequate but overshadowed by those of Christopher Walken (as Frank Sr.) and Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty, a character created by Spielberg and Jeff Nathanson who wrote the screenplay). Given Frank Jr.'s charm which seems natural to DiCaprio, it is easy to understand how quickly he could deceive so many different people, both in the United States and abroad. More difficult for me to understand is how Frank Jr. -- as portrayed by DiCaprio -- could sustain that deception almost indefinitely.I just wish the film had devoted more attention to the exceptional cunning which was obviously required of Frank Jr. to devise so many ingenious strategies and tactics. For example, he recognized the benefits of having others' bank deposits credited to his own account so he devised a way by which to print slips bearing his account number. He then replaced blank deposit slips in bank branches with his own deposit slips. I also wish more attention had been devoted to examining Frank Jr.'s compulsive need to assume others' identities. Deep down, was he ashamed of his father? Was he ashamed of himself? I am also curious to know how he could betray the confidence of so many decent people and still remain so cheerful, even playful, even after he was finally apprehended. Perhaps Spielberg should be blamed for casting DiCaprio or perhaps the two of them should be blamed for a poorly developed character. In fact, other than Frank Sr. and perhaps Hanratty, none of the characters in this film is sufficiently developed. Hence the Four Star rating which includes one for the Walken and Hanks performances and another for the special features.To repeat, Catch Me If You Can is frequently entertaining. However, after seeing it again recently, I again wondered if the real Frank Jr. could gain my confidence as easily as he did others.

605314,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005JLSB,Samuel Chell,"[2, 4]","Spielberg opens his holiday offering with a narrative frame of his protagonist appearing on an episode of ""To Tell the Truth,"" intercutting shots of DiCaprio with 30-year-old footage of ""guest"" Kitty Carlisle and ""host"" Joe Garagiola from the actual television show. A nice device for ""motivating"" the story and establishing a sense of place and ""realness""--but also one that sets up an expectation in the audience: will Kitty make the right call?Spielberg's script never returns to this framing moment. A small detail perhaps, but this film, like most of Spielberg's work, takes great pride in the details, the verisimilitude of time and place--from Nehi pop bottles to Mitch Miller's television show to the continuous use on the soundtrack of popular music hits of the day. The problem is not so much that many of these details are anachronisms, or just sufficiently ""off"" to be bothersome, but that the slowness of plotting and thinness of characterization allowed me to dwell on them in the first place.  Hanks' role calls for him to be a straight-arrow caricature with his face upstaged by large glasses and his deportment deferring to his padded mid-section; DiCaprio, too, is about surfaces, incapable of suggesting any of the addictive giddiness of the successful imposter or con artist.  The biggest surprise in the film may well be the nuanced, sensitive performance of Christopher Walken who, as Frank's blustering, conning father, is at once wholly believable and sympathetic.The film will no doubt do decent business. Not only is it a star vehicle for two of the screen's biggest attractions but Spielberg pulls on all of the middle-class family-value strings that are his trademark, and he combines the genre of the loveable imposter with that of the persevering bounty hunter who bonds with his praiseworthy prey. Moreover, unlike George W. and Osama, Hanks gets his man.

605315,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JLSB,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 0]","""Catch Me If You Can"" is a genuine throwback, made with a light touch and finger-snapping charm, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, finally, in a movie star performance. If he hits a down note as 1960s con artist Frank Abagnale I'd like to see it.Director Steven Spielberg, too, gears back his tendency to pile on the portent, although there are few scenes of thick soup drama that seem to jar us out of our enjoyment. Mostly, however, ""Catch Me"" is an easybreezer about a kid who finds the one thing he does well, does it with extraordinary ease, and eludes the entire FBI mail fraud division for years while he does it. The highest-concept script floating around Hollywood couldn't tell a better tall-but-true tale.Frank Abagnale was a kid of above average smarts with a slick, quick-thinking businessman for a dad (Christopher Walken) and a mannered, spoiled French mother (the estimable Nathalie Baye). When Frank Sr. gets tagged by the IRS, his wife swiftly sours on him and gets a divorce. That sets up a scene where, on the spot, Frank Jr. has to decide where, and with whom, he'll live, and Frank Jr. bolts, beginning a five-year run of check fraud unlike anything before or since.The movie better explains the mechanics of just how Frank Jr. rips off Pan-Am Airlines, his chosen victim for the stunning no-questions-asked treatment afforded pilots at the time. Later, he becomes a doctor in Georgia, then a lawyer in Louisiana, where his run nearly ends when he gets involved with a rich girl (Amy Adams) and decides to marry.On Frank's ""tale"" is FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) a straight-arrow investigator with a better taste for magnetic ink than human relations. Hanks personally asked for the role, and he makes a nice, determined foil. ""How else do you think this is going to end?"" is his standard line to Frank. A kinship develops, the kind of kinship between two acknowledged, lonely professionals on opposite sides of a business, and when the game comes to a final close, Carl goes a mile -- and further -- for Frank when most ""kinder"" agents would have let the chips fall where they may.Frank Jr. also tries to keep a tenuous connection with his father when he can, and Walken, in a few scenes, essays a broken, disillusioned man just about as well as an actor can. Frank Sr. barely hides his seething under the polish of his false optimism; Walken, as usual, gives his lines an ever-changing, jazzlike cadence; his performances are mysteries all themselves. He's beautiful in this movie.And look at DiCaprio! So cautious in both ""The Beach"" and ""Gangs of New York,"" Leo seems to have refound the confidence the groove he flaunted in his early career. The role suits him -- DiCaprio still looks like a boy, so playing young is easy -- and it may, in fact, turn out to be one of his best roles. DiCaprio, because of his face and voice, will always struggle with movies on the other side of the track; better he should play to his good looks and his easy-to-smile demeanor. Frank Abagnale is a Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart kind of guy, and DiCaprio can be their heir, should he want the mantle.

605317,AJ9W09EUQPAKE,B00005JLSB,Sirin,"[2, 2]","The inspiration for this implausible story about a teenage conman who swindles his way to a cool $2 million before his 21st birthday is actually, as most people planning to purchase this DVD will know, a true premise. Frank Abagnale Jnr attained brief fame in the 1960s when he became the youngest American ever to appear on the FBI's most wanted list and his autobiography, published in 1980, chronicling his underhand escapades, became a cult bestseller.It appears that Steven Spielberg was one of those readers, or at any rate, was inspired to recreate this story on the big screen by some convincing source or another as this is not an orthodox Spielberg film. It fits neither into the category of his most recent, darker themed movies, A.I: Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report, nor the large scale epics emphasising tender children's emotions (E.T., Hook), large scale historical drama (Schindler's List) or blockbuster thrill sensations (Jurassic Park).No, Catch Me if You Can is something rather different. Ostensibly it is a dramatic comedy. Di Caprio is cast as the dashing, raffish Frank Jnr - except that his clothes for some reason are always a size too small. It is never quite clear why he feels the need to become one of America's most notorious criminals, but we are given the impression that deep family psychological anxieties play a large part - Frank Jnr is angry with his mother Paula who dumps his father for someone more successful and has a touching desire to please his father, Frank Snr (Christopher Walken plays this role to acclaimed success). Rapidly and ingeniously he passes himself off as a pilot, doctor and lawyer - sometimes through necessity when his is on the verge of being caught, sometimes, it appears, through sheer boredom. His evades his captors because he is so clever, but also because the finest brains of the FBI that pursue him are represented by Carl Hanretty (Tom Hanks) who, with his middle aged family problems, paunch and dogged rather than lightning quick intellect, frequently and comically lets Frank get away.This is not a deep film but several issues are explored. Frank's weakness for women is a continuous theme throughout the film, many different types of women - high class prostitutes (whom he cons) and the naive, brace wearing Brenda Strong (Amy Adams) who's tender innocence captures Frank's heart for a while and he becomes engaged to her until the need to escape from the law forces him away again.There is also a respectful bond between Frank and Carl the FBI agent. Carl respect's Frank's ingenuity and cunning, Frank sees Carl as almost a father figure and admires his persistence to bring him to justice. There is a clever solution that reconciles both these two factors. You'll have to watch the movie to find it out.So a Spielberg comedy. The man has nothing to prove, he can do pretty much what he likes now.

605320,A2G606VQGJ5EN9,B00005JLSB,Sodalug,"[4, 4]","Leo plays Frank Abagnale, Jr., one of the youngest, most successful, and flamboyant con men in history. Not even an adult when he got his start, Abagnale passed off millions of dollars in rubber and fabricated checks across several different countries. Even more unbelievable, he was able to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, Pan Am pilot, Harvard graduate medical doctor, and a licensed lawyer. This is by no means a serious crime study, but a humorous and light-hearted look back to the recent past just before the rise of technology. This is a time when a charismatic grifter could easily exploit the common sense of trust and appearance to con the unsuspecting out of cash and just about anything else he desired. Catch Me If You Can does for conmen what Trainspotting did for heroin addicts. And not counting the jail time, at least in Abagnale's case, crime did indeed pay, and pay well.Personal bias: both DiCaprio and Hanks strain the definition of the term ""actor"". Spielberg is a hack of a director. Despite this, I did find this film enjoyable and entertaining. I thought it moved along well despite its length, though just about everyone else disagrees and feel at least fifteen minutes could have been lopped off.Catch Me If You Can relies on a longstanding and successful formula. Despite disliking crime in the real world, audiences love clever criminals in movies. In film, crime can be glamorous, exciting work. The Godfather, Heat, and Hannibal are just a few perfect examples of glamorized crime and criminals. As long as the criminal is generally good natured about his ""craft"" and doesn't needlessly hurt too many of the little people the audience will identify with him and forgive such moral lapses, though there are many exceptions. In this respect, Abagnale provides the perfect movie criminal, he steals only from large, faceless institutions. More importantly, he is never violent in his cons. This leaves the audience free to root for the bad guy unburdened by guilt. In The Godfather, Michael Corleone resisted the drug trade preferring traditional, insulated vices. The robbers in Heat also stole mainly from institutions, preferring low profile thefts and avoiding violence except when given no other choice. And finally Hannibal creates a great paradox, Lecter is violent and cannibalistic, yet the audience loves him and roots for him to elude the authorities. Why? Because Lecter is so regal and well mannered when not killing. And generally he only goes after those who deserve it in some way, he does not kill indiscriminately. These are the traits that make for a great movie criminal.Leo as Abagnale seems to fit the part the audience expects, someone handsome and charismatic. These are important since many of Abagnale's cons rely on nothing more than charm and some quick thinking and fast talking. The role does not demand much more form Leo, except a few scenes of loss and sadness over the breakup of his family. Otherwise he spends most of the film wide-eyed and amazed at the relative ease with which he perpetrates his frauds, much as the real Abagnale must have felt at the age of sixteen when he first set out on his crime spree.Catch Me If You Can would have us believe Abagnale's true motivation was the divorce of his parents after his small time conman father got caught by the IRS. Abagnale naively believed that he could steal back enough to buy back everything that had been taken from them, eventually reuniting his parents. True or not, this provides us with a rationale for his actions.Christopher Walken plays Frank's father, whose life of cons apparently rubbed off on his son. Walken brings his usual skill to the role and presents a convincing portrait of a common grifter. He believes the government is out to get him, and actually encourages his son to ""stick it to the man"" so to speak.Hanks succeeds in his role because it suits the character he plays best - a geek. Hanratty is a desk jockey, a paper chaser, not used to the excitement of chasing down a living breathing criminal. When he first tracks Abagnale down and moves in for the arrest, he's visibly shaken, the pistol trembling in his hand as he half-thinkingly displays his ID badge backwards to a startled maid. His Bostonian accent is passable, but appears and disappears intermittently throughout the film.Spielberg loves stereotypes, and every character in this and all his other truly successful films have been as stock as my Toyota Corolla. They're easy to work with, easy to cast and easy to direct. Try as he might to escape it, Spielberg is a populist director to the bone. He succeeds best when crafting simple action and adventure stories containing flat characters with grand style and a dose of imagination. When he tries to craft something with any great depth or complexity, it fails miserably. A.I. is the best example of this, it was a horrific commercial and critical failure.Perhaps he desires to transcend his proletarian roots in order to gain acceptance as one of the artistic greats (a Hitchcock, Scorsese or Coppola), no longer satisfied with mere commercial success. Catch Me If You Can may be a sign that he's finally accepted the fact that he just doesn't quite have it in him. Nothing fancy here, just good old fashioned Spielberg. I noticed plenty of heavy handed, golden light streaming through blinds into dusty rooms (I don't know what else to call it). That was the extent of artistic liberties taken that I could detect.",3,"Entertaining, but not great",1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,5491,"['Leo', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'one', 'youngest', 'most',

Minority Report amazed audiences during the summer and Catch Me If You Can giddily amused them during the winter.  Catch Me If You Can  chronicles the life of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a master con-artist who cashed bogus checks while passing himself off as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  While such a lifestyle may appear glamorous and exciting on the outside, the truth of the matter was that Frank was actually a sad and troubled teenager who could only maintain a relationship with two people in his life - his father (Christopher Walken) and the FBI agent pursuing him (Tom Hanks).  DiCaprio displays an impressive acting range as he moves from light and charming into brooding and distraught whenever the story calls for it.  Hanks in the role of Carl Hanratty hits another home run and proves himself once more to be the Jimmy Stewart of his generation.  His Hanratty is not the cliche law enforcement officer who obsesses over his prey day and night, but rather a complex father figure who feels that Abagnale can be salvaged from his life of crime.  As the pursuit drags on, Hanratty develops a respect, and then a concern, for Abagnale.  The growth of this relationship proves to be touching and amusing at the same time.  This film probably will not rank among the pantheon of the great Spielberg films, but it will definitely not diminish his legacy.

Leo DiCaprio is Frank Abagnale, Jr., a teenager who spends the mid-1960s posing as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer--all the while cashing checks around the world that ring to the tune of $2.5 million.  His quick wit and suave demeanor are apparently enough to make unsuspecting strangers believe at face value anything Frank says.  Hot on his tail, however, is an FBI agent (Tom Hanks, in a supporting role) who's determined to nail Frank and end his streak of ruthless deception.  DiCaprio fits into his role like a pair of well-worn jeans and seems more confortable with his material than he did in Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York.""  Productionwise, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is also a success, as it captures the flavor and texture of the 1960s admirably through its colors and fashions.  I just wished the film would dig a little deeper into Frank's background which could shed some light as to why he decided to be a juvenile con man.  Sure, we know Frank's parents divorced (Christopher Walken, who plays Frank's dad, earned his Oscar nomination, by the way), but not all kids with mommy/daddy issues turn into sophisticated criminals.  And, at 2 hours and 20 minutes, ""Catch Me If You Can"" gets a bit long-winded and could use some trimming.  To be honest, this movie doesn't represent the cream of Speilberg's crop, and it pales a bit in comparison to the far more engaging ""Minority Report,"" also released in 2002.  As for the DVD itself, I don't understand why it needed to have 2 discs.  The movie and the bonus material (which consists mostly of glossy featurettes) could have fit into one DVD.

All the while he's pursued by a dedicated FBI agent named Carl Hanratty ), whose dogged determination stays one step behind Abagnale's spontaneous wits.

Indeed Leo did a very good job in Catch Me If You Can. Co-starring with Tom Hanks, whose acting is nearly unquestionable; Leo's performance is no second grade to Tom. Telling the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a 16 year old school boy turned fraud cheque expert, Leonardo has captured the essence of the character who show gradual psychological changes with huge dilemma inside: on one hand he needs to survive in the cruel material world and on the other hand he doesn't want to be hunted down as a criminal. He took up different fake roles as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, which all requires strict standard of accreditation without being questioned. However, he who scored all these successes was not happy with his life. He tried to confess to his father-in-law to be but was not taken seriously. It is sometimes interesting that people would prefer to believe in lies instead of the truth. The problem is where is the truth for this tragic character now? Also where could he position himself in the world while he believes there is nobody to trust anymore? His father is far from being able to help, while his mother is already occupied with a new family, he seemed to be alone and on the run by himself. Strangely enough, Tom Hanks, who was the agent to catch him for his deeds become his only soul mate that he could call on Christmas Eves. The tie between these characters are interesting in a way that both saw something inside each other, but because of the difference in position that they could not let each other have a minute of rest. This is a very touching story delivered by two really really good actors who brought these two real characters back to life again in front of the audience. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is way back on track and Tom Hanks' attention to details in character building is just shockingly good. These are the characters that you would care for during the movie, for you would find it difficult to stay on a bystander's point of view.",5,Fabulous performance from two fabulous actors,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,2149,"['was', 'said', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'Gangs', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'testing', 'stones', 'box', 'office', 'attraction', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'failure', 'Beach', 'Indeed', 'Leo', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'Co-starring', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'acting', 'nearly', 'unquestionable', 'Leo', 'performance', 'second', 'grade', 'Tom', 'Telling', 'true', 'story', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', '16', 'year', 'old', 'school', 'boy', 'turned', 'fraud', 'cheque', 'expert', 'Leonardo', 'captured', 'essence', 'character', 'who', 'show', 'gradual', 'psychological', 'changes', 'huge', 'dilemma', 'one', 'hand', 'survive', 'cruel', 'material', 'world', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'hunted', 'down', 'criminal', 'took', 'up', 'different', 'fake', 'roles', 'pilot', 'doctor', 'lawyer', 'strict', 'standard', 'accreditation', 'being', 'questioned', 'However', 'who', 'scored', 'successes', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'life', 'tried', 'confess', 'father-in-law', 'be', 'was', 'not', 'taken', 'seriously', 'sometimes', 'interesting', 'people', 'would', 'prefer', 'believe', 'lies', 'instead', 'truth', 'problem', 'where', 'truth', 'tragic', 'character', 'now', 'Also', 'where', 'could', 'position', 'world', 'nobody', 'trust', 'anymore', 'father', 'far', 'being', 'able', 'help', 'mother', 'already', 'occupied', 'new', 'family', 'seemed', 'be', 'alone', 'run', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'was', 'agent', 'catch', 'deeds', 'become', 'only', 'soul', 'mate', 'could', 'call', 'Christmas', 'Eves', 'tie', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'way', 'saw', 'something', 'inside', 'other', 'difference', 'position', 'could', 'not', 'let', 'other', 'have', 'minute', 'rest', 'very', 'touching', 'story', 'delivered', 'two', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'who', 'brought', 'two', 'real', 'characters', 'back', 'life', 'again', 'front', 'audience', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'performance', 'way', 'back', 'track', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'attention', 'details', 'character', 'building', 'just', 'shockingly', 'good', 'are', 'characters', 'would', 'care', 'movie', 'would', 'find', 'difficult', 'stay', 'bystander', 'point', 'view']",Catch Me If You Can
605344,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JLSB,Tucker Andersen,"[5, 8]","This is a well directed, well acted movie from an excellent screenplay that tells the story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), a teenage ""con man"" who was finally captured after more than three years of posing as an airline pilot, doctor and lawyer while becoming a master check forger who undestood the intricacies of the banking system as well as did FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the agent in charge of check fraud who pursued him. Obviously the reason Stephen Speilberg chose to make this movie was the challenge of keeping an audience entertained while telling an absolutely unbelievable story that only compells our attention because it is true.Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Frank and convinces us of his ability to con others through his belief in himself, and Tom Hanks is Carl Hanratty, the man whose life is his job and who not only becomes Frank's shadow but eventual savior from a French prison (in the movie's opening scene). The supporting cast is very good as well - Amy Adams as Brenda, with whom Frank falls in love, Martin Sheen as her father who despite his belief in his worldliness is totally taken in by Frank, but most crucially, Christopher Walken who plays Frank, Sr. to perfection, a dysfunctional father and husband whose self deception and failed marriage cause the crisis that leads to Frank's decision to make a life for himself without the usual moorings of reality.This is a story with many funny moments, but it is not a comedy. The movie begins near the story's conclusion to give us needed perspective, since otherwise it would seem even slower paced than it does at the beginning, which is one of its few faults. Then it concludes rapidly in a very interesting and somewhat unexpected manner except for those few moviegoers who may be familiar with the details of the story. However, when the film was over I felt that the audience's patience and understanding had been well rewarded; interestingly enough after more than two hours several people didn't rush out of the theater but sat there watching the credits and talking about the movie. In the end, to understand Frank's story, you had to understand his father, you had to understand Hanratty, you had to fully appreciate that Frank was really only a teenager, and the movie needed time to develop and integrate all these themes.

One was MINORITY REPORT, that sci-fi futuristic suspense film starring Tom Cruise. That movie represented the ""new"" Spielberg, the director who's view of the world has become much more dark and sinister. Yet, in that film there were hints of the of comedy and dark humor that were reminiscent of the ""old"" family friendly Spielberg. Spielberg's other film of 2002 is CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and it's a classic Spielberg piece in everyway.The movie is warm, light-hearteded, and full of nostaligia. That is ironic in a way considering the movie is based upon the crime spree of the world's most successful con artist, Frank Abagdale. Of course, if you've read Frank's memoir of the same name, you know that's how the book is too. Therefore, the film stays true to the spirit of the book, messing with history just enough to make the movie more compelling, dramatic, and lively.The whole look of the film; from the cars, clothing, hairstyles, and Christmas ornaments; captures the style and era of the mid-1960's. The soundtrack is great and the movie's main theme is another tune that makes a nice addition to the John Williams canon.Every performance Tom Hanks has done since SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has beengolden and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job as the main character and Christopher Walken pulls off a supporting performance that should earn him an Oscar nomination.The movie is fun to watch and hearkens back to the good old days of Spielberg when he made movies that were just good movies.

After all, both Hitchcock and Welles alluded to the fact that movies are the ultimate con. Speilberg, regardless how you feel about him, is one of the best at the game. With Catch Spielberg manages to recreate the era right down to the fondue forks perfectly. He also captures the loss of innocence during a time when globalization took flight allowing these type of things to happen.Leonard Dicaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr with all the warmth and manipulative charm one would expect from a 17 year old who managed to impersonate a French teacher at his own high school for a week, an airline pilot for Pam Am and an ER doctor. It's amazing what charm, a warm smile and salesmanship can do to move people into your back pocket.Tom Hanks plays against type here. His Tom Hanratty is a social inept but amazingly bright FBI agent that wrote the book check fraud. His lack of social grace clearly initially undermines his ability to negoiate promotion within the FBI. It's his smarts that save him and, surprisingly, the closer he gets to catching Abagnale, the more he comes to admire and pity him. He also picks up many of the social graces and characteristics that make Frank so likable. He still maintains his gruff FBI exterior but but softens overtime on the inside. Hanks gives a truly marvelous performance.It's a pity that they couldn't have given two Academy Awards for best supporting actor. Walken's turn as Frank's father is the most powerful he's done in years. He manages to capture the combination that drives Frank senior in all of a few scenes--his brashness, insecurity, salesmanship, charm and sadness. He's one of America's underappreciated actors.The rest of the cast is solid and manages to convey the feel of the time in their performances.John Williams' unusual score recalls the jazzy film scores from the late 50's and early 60's. It's one of Williams best least combastic scores in years.The Saul Bass like title design also manages to capture the feel of the time and films quite well. All of these elements capture the feel Spielberg was looking for. Spielberg, like Hitchcock, has his entertainments and his serious films. Catch Me is Spielberg's North By Northwest--it's not a lesser film because it isn't as serious as Minority Report or emotionally wretching as AI. Spielberg, like Hitch, manages the rare feat of tackling a number of themes, styles and types of films well.

605354,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005JLSB,William Hare,"[14, 19]","When the idea for a film surfaced in the creative mind of director Steven Spielberg concerning the amazing activities of Frank Abagnale Jr. there might have been more than a little bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu involved.  It was Spielberg who, as a young man fascinated by film, talked his way past Universal Studios security guards to watch films being made.Leonardo Di Caprio as Abagnale Jr. interviews a Pan American Airways supervisor to learn about the careers of their pilots for the ostensible purpose of writing an article for his high school paper.  In reality he is seeking to learn enough about the lives and activities of Pan Am pilots so he can successfully impersonate them.  Couple his skillful impersonations alongside a genius for manufacturing bogus checks and the FBI was left reeling while he drained millions from the banking system.  His cover as a pilot provides him with the opportunity to cash checks in cities all over the world.Christopher Walken as Frank Abagnale Sr. plummets from a commanding community position as a successful businessman in New Rochelle, New York to a life in which he is compelled to scrap for his next meal.  It all happens after he has troubles with the Internal Revenue Service and winds up under the oppressive yolk of owing a huge amount of money.  After the Abagnales leave their mansion and move into a small apartment the marriage of Walken to his attractive French born wife, whom he had met during World War Two, ends abruptly in divorce.  She promptly marries Walken's lawyer friend from the New Rochelle Rotary Club, played by James Brolin, as Di Caprio's world becomes  shaken.Di Caprio had seen his father engage in shady manipulations, and so he put some of his father's techniques to use along with his own additions.  Soon it becomes obvious that Walken was a rank amateur compared to his son, who has a genius for white-collar crime.The film's dramatic high point and chief story thread is the battle between Di Caprio to stay out of prison and hard working New York FBI agent Tom Hanks to put him there.  Hanks is divorced and so literally married to his job that the white collar criminal is able to consistently reach him in his office on Christmas Eve.  They develop a respect for each other over time, with Hanks admiring Di Caprio's brilliant skills, one of which is master escapist every time that he and his colleagues close in, with the criminal admiring the FBI agent's idealistic tenacity.The film, based on the true life exploits of Abagnale, heads toward the inevitable result of a confrontation where the criminal is arrested.  It happens under the most dramatic circumstances in France.  The story then takes another turn late in the film when the FBI realizes that it can use the criminal's white-collar criminal skills as a means of preventing  future crimes.In real life Abagnale abandoned his criminal ways after doing his time, making large sums of money by consulting the corporate world in the area he knew best, that of security.  Ironically Abagnale began by costing the corporate world millions and ultimately ended up by saving it millions.Martin Sheen has a role as a father whose daughter wants to marry Di Caprio.  The wily young man of many identities meets her as a presumed ""emergency room supervising doctor"" and then swiftly switches to lawyer after passing the Louisiana State Bar.  He then goes to work as an assistant prosecutor in the office headed by Sheen.",3,A Genius of Crime,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,3463,"['When', 'idea', 'film', 'surfaced', 'creative', 'mind', 'director', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'concerning', 'amazing', 'activities', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'involved', 'was', 'Spielberg', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'fascinated', 'film', 'talked', 'way', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'security', 'guards', 'watch', 'films', 'being', 'made.Leonardo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'Abagnale', 'Jr.', 'Pan', 'American', 'Airways', 'supervisor', 'learn', 'careers', 'pilots', 'ostensible', 'purpose', 'writing', 'article', 'high', 'school', 'paper', 'reality', 'seeking', 'learn', 'enough', 'lives', 'activities', 'Pan', 'Am', 'pilots', 'can', 'successfully', 'impersonate', 'Couple', 'skillful', 'impersonations', 'genius', 'manufacturing', 'bogus', 'checks', 'FBI', 'was', 'left', 'reeling', 'drained', 'millions', 'banking', 'system', 'cover', 'pilot', 'opportunity', 'cash', 'checks', 'cities', 'world.Christopher', 'Walken', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Sr.', 'plummets', 'commanding', 'community', 'position', 'successful', 'businessman', 'New', 'Rochelle', 'New', 'York', 'life', 'compelled', 'scrap', 'next', 'meal', 'troubles', 'Internal', 'Revenue', 'Service', 'up', 'oppressive', 'yolk', 'owing', 'huge', 'amount', 'money', 'Abagnales', 'leave', 'mansion', 'move', 'small', 'apartment', 'marriage', 'Walken', 'attractive', 'French', 'born', 'wife', 'whom', 'had', 'met', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'abruptly', 'divorce', 'promptly', 'Walken', 'lawyer', 'friend', 'New', 'Rochelle', 'Rotary', 'Club', 'played', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'world', 'shaken.Di', 'Caprio', 'had', 'seen', 'father', 'engage', 'shady', 'manipulations', 'so', 'put', 'father', 'techniques', 'use', 'along', 'own', 'additions', 'Soon', 'obvious', 'Walken', 'was', 'rank', 'amateur', 'compared', 'son', 'who', 'genius', 'white-collar', 'crime.The', 'film', 'dramatic', 'high', 'point', 'chief', 'story', 'thread', 'battle', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'stay', 'prison', 'hard', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'put', 'there', 'Hanks', 'divorced', 'so', 'literally', 'married', 'job', 'white', 'collar', 'criminal', 'able', 'consistently', 'reach', 'office', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'develop', 'respect', 'other', 'time', 'Hanks', 'admiring', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'brilliant', 'skills', 'one', 'master', 'escapist', 'time', 'colleagues', 'close', 'criminal', 'admiring', 'FBI', 'agent', 'idealistic', 'tenacity.The', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'exploits', 'Abagnale', 'inevitable', 'result', 'confrontation', 'where', 'criminal', 'arrested', 'most', 'dramatic', 'circumstances', 'France', 'story', 'then', 'turn', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'FBI', 'can', 'use', 'criminal', 'white-collar', 'criminal', 'skills', 'means', 'preventing', 'future', 'crimes.In', 'real', 'life', 'Abagnale', 'abandoned', 'criminal', 'ways', 'doing', 'time', 'making', 'large', 'sums', 'money', 'consulting', 'corporate', 'world', 'area', 'knew', 'best', 'security', 'Ironically', 'Abagnale', 'began', 'costing', 'corporate', 'world', 'millions', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'up', 'saving', 'millions.Martin', 'Sheen', 'role', 'father', 'daughter', 'marry', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'wily', 'young', 'man', 'many', 'identities', 'presumed', 'emergency', 'room', 'supervising', 'doctor', 'then', 'swiftly', 'lawyer', 'passing', 'Louisiana', 'State', 'Bar', 'then', 'work', 'assistant', 'prosecutor', 'office', 'headed', 'Sheen']",Catch Me If You Can

It's a totally unique tale considering the age of the con man (a teenager), how much he got away with and how he actually did his cons, the extended pursuit by the FBI man, and much more.The movie is full of amusing moments (fellow audience members were laughing at many points), but there's also a very human side as Frank the con man's motivations are explored.  The two lead actors in Catch Me are marvelous.  You have to believe Leonardo DiCaprio (as Frank) as both a high school kid and a decade-older adult, and he carries it off well.  His convincing performance minimizes the ""how could anyone fall for it"" aspect of the cons.  (As in, ""how could anyone believe a 16 year-old is a doctor/airline pilot/lawyer?"")  Tom Hanks as the FBI agent is playing a kind of ornery character relatively different from the lovable or heroic people he usually portrays.  The development of the complex relationship between hunted and hunter is one of the movie's most interesting features, largely because of the skill of the two leads.There are many visual touches throughout the movie that reveal we're in the hands of a master.

While defrauding multiple institutions as well as the U.S. government, Frank is pursued by agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is continually astounded by the kinds of things that the young Abagnale is able to get away with.There are three primary ways in which this film becomes very much a classic upon first viewing...First, it is an incredible ""period piece"" dealing with the 1969s.  The clothes, decor, attitudes, music, & personalities of the decade are very convincing and will make you feel as if you were actually transported back in time.Second, the story is engrossing, compelling, and will have you thinking about its multiple themes the whole way through.  Frank Jr. is not just a cardboard-cutout character...he is given the same contradictions that we all have, both good and bad.Finally, the acting is tremendous.  DiCaprio steals the show pretty much from beginning to end, while Hanks is his typical solid self.  Smaller roles from Walken & Amy Adams are also very interesting and well-played.Overall, ""Catch Me If You Can"" is a fun little romp through the 1960s that (per the usual with a Steven Spielberg production) is very well-rounded and contains something for everybody.  My exact rating would be 4.5 stars, as it truly will transport you away from the world for the entire runtime.",4,An Entertaining Period Piece Based On A True Story,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,2143,"['Usually', 'movies', 'day', 'age', 'are', 'separated', 'two', 'distinct', 'classes', 'are', 'make', 'think', 'then', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'manages', 'combine', 'little', 'bit', 'strategies', 'order', 'create', 'excellent', 'little', 'period', 'piece', 'will', 'almost', 'completely', 'absorb', 'little', 'nooks', 'crannies.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'film', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'Jr', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'who', 'age', '17', 'breaks', 'away', 'divorcing', 'parents', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'sort', 'grand', 'impersonator', 'specializing', 'forging', 'checks', 'projecting', 'utmost', 'confidence', 'Frank', 'airline', 'co-pilot', 'doctor', 'lawyer', '1960s', 'credentials', 'positions', 'defrauding', 'multiple', 'institutions', 'as', 'well', 'U.S.', 'government', 'Frank', 'pursued', 'agent', 'Carl', 'Hanratty', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'continually', 'astounded', 'kinds', 'things', 'young', 'Abagnale', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'are', 'three', 'primary', 'ways', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'classic', 'first', 'viewing', 'First', 'incredible', 'period', 'piece', 'dealing', '1969s', 'clothes', 'decor', 'attitudes', 'music', 'personalities', 'decade', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'were', 'actually', 'transported', 'back', 'time.Second', 'story', 'engrossing', 'compelling', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'multiple', 'themes', 'whole', 'way', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'not', 'just', 'cardboard-cutout', 'character', 'given', 'same', 'contradictions', 'have', 'good', 'bad.Finally', 'acting', 'tremendous', 'DiCaprio', 'show', 'pretty', 'much', 'beginning', 'end', 'Hanks', 'typical', 'solid', 'self', 'Smaller', 'Walken', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'well-played.Overall', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'fun', 'little', 'romp', '1960s', 'usual', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'production', 'very', 'well-rounded', 'something', 'everybody', 'exact', 'rating', 'would', 'be', '4.5', 'stars', 'truly', 'will', 'transport', 'away', 'world', 'entire', 'runtime']",Catch Me If You Can

Every detail is perfect in this period piece, from cars to hair, etc.  There is a real gracefulness to the flow of the characters from scene to scene.  It is fluid, like dancing, even when the characters are on the run.The subject matter is fascinating.  I don't know how much the story was embellished for the movie, but if even a fraction of it is true, Frank Abagnale, the infamous counterfeiter, should be as legendary as Butch and Sundance.  What is fact is that Abagnale stole over $4 million during the 1960s using counterfeit checks.  He was a pioneer in fraud, and as a reformed thief, he has been a pioneer in fraud detection and prevention.  I'm inspired to read Abagnale's autobiography of the same name.The reason I only give the movie four stars is that it won't be something I watch even annually.  While it is an excellent film, the characters are not endearing and I do not identify with their struggle.  That's as it should be.  For Spielberg to make this movie more heart-tugging would have meant resorting to cliched plot devices that are thankfully not part of his repetoire.",4,Stylish and fascinating but characters not endearing,1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,1158,"['Spielberg', 'movies', 'just', 'continue', 'be', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'detail', 'perfect', 'period', 'piece', 'cars', 'hair', 'etc', 'real', 'gracefulness', 'flow', 'characters', 'scene', 'scene', 'fluid', 'dancing', 'even', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'run.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'fascinating', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'embellished', 'movie', 'even', 'fraction', 'true', 'Frank', 'Abagnale', 'infamous', 'counterfeiter', 'should', 'be', 'as', 'legendary', 'Butch', 'Sundance', 'What', 'fact', 'Abagnale', 'stole', '4', 'million', '1960s', 'using', 'counterfeit', 'checks', 'was', 'pioneer', 'fraud', 'reformed', 'thief', 'been', 'pioneer', 'fraud', 'detection', 'prevention', ""'m"", 'inspired', 'read', 'Abagnale', 'autobiography', 'same', 'name.The', 'reason', 'only', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'something', 'watch', 'even', 'annually', 'excellent', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'endearing', 'do', 'not', 'identify', 'struggle', 'should', 'be', 'Spielberg', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'heart-tugging', 'would', 'have', 'meant', 'resorting', 'cliched', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'thankfully', 'not', 'part', 'repetoire']",Catch Me If You Can

Leonardo DiCaprio is a talented actor, and he definitely puts emotion and charm into his role as the 16-year-old boy who faked his way into wealth by forging checks and conned through jobs as an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.  This is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. and the FBI agent that tracks him for over two years, Carl Hanratty.  The interaction between Hanks and DiCaprio is well portrayed.
