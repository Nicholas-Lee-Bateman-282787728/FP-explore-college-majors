1030660,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000K4WPCC,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[3, 7]","Holy hell almighty! No wonder critics hated this film so much (A rating of only 3% fresh on RottenTomatoes.com). I knew this film was going to be really stupid, but damn it sucked worse than I thought it would! Shame on these producers because they are the same producers behind the excellent horror-action Underworld films, and shame on the director too; Renny Harlin who directed Deep Blue Sea and Die Hard 2 (Both great films). Bad Sony Pictures! Bad! This film is incompetent on just about every level and was obviously created for teenage girls; the same teenage girls who went crazy for the God-awful Twilight film. While this film is above the quality of the awful Twilight film because it has more interesting ideas to boot, but it still sucks pretty damn hard. The teenage girls will be the only ones who like this film about teenage warlocks with six-packs who shave their body hair. If this doesn't appeal to you then just walk away.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: There are four brothers who are known as the 'Sons of Ipswich' at Spenser Academy who are more than 300 years old and hide their powers because in the 17th century their kind were being killed by witch hunters. So they hide their powers away from most people. After awhile they meet a new student who seems like a fairly likable friend, but then they realize ""Oh s***, the banished fifth brother has returned!"" Now they must use their powers, rescue their damsels in distress, and destroy the fifth brother. LAME. The story is a cluttered incoherent, convoluted, and abysmal mess of storytelling.MUSIC: This was obviously designed for teens... and it sucks. I hated the music, it wasn't horrible like Twilight's but this score still sucked pretty bad.ACTION: This film is loaded with stupid special effects, cheesy fight scenes, it's stuffed with cliches, hot women who are too stupid to save themselves, and scene with a locker room of naked men, YAY... The only quality that can be derived from this atrocious film is the fact you can laugh at some parts because they're so bad that they're funny. Other than that you are left with one truly awful supernatural thriller. On top of the cheesy action scenes you are treated to an incredibly boring film as well. Crappy, crappy, crappy.ACTING: These actors were terrible and there were no redeeming qualities to their acting. The dialogue was also a horrid mess that can't accomplish being even remotely believable. But that probably doesn't matter to the teenage girls this film is geared towards, they'll love any male actor who they is hot despite their horrid acting.OVERALL: Unless you are a teenage girl who is intent on seeing this film just to fantasize about guys with six-packs and no body hair, a pointless and hackneyed storyline doesn't matter to you, if bad special effects amaze you, and if you enjoy terrible musical scores then by all means watch this film. As for the rest of us we'll just go watch Underworld instead.THE GOOD: Those ""so bad it's funny"" moments.THE BAD: Everything else",1,"THIS SUCKED, AND IT SUCKED HARD  3.5 OUT OF 10",1242000000,"05 11, 2009",2009,3014,"['Holy', 'hell', 'almighty', 'No', 'wonder', 'critics', 'hated', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'rating', 'only', '3', '%', 'fresh', 'RottenTomatoes.com', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'stupid', 'sucked', 'worse', 'thought', 'would', 'Shame', 'producers', 'are', 'same', 'producers', 'excellent', 'horror-action', 'Underworld', 'films', 'shame', 'director', 'too', 'Renny', 'Harlin', 'who', 'directed', 'Deep', 'Blue', 'Sea', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'great', 'films', 'Bad', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Bad', 'film', 'incompetent', 'just', 'level', 'was', 'obviously', 'created', 'teenage', 'girls', 'same', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'went', 'crazy', 'God-awful', 'Twilight', 'film', 'film', 'quality', 'awful', 'Twilight', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'boot', 'still', 'pretty', 'damn', 'hard', 'teenage', 'girls', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'film', 'teenage', 'warlocks', 'six-packs', 'who', 'shave', 'body', 'hair', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'then', 'just', 'walk', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'are', 'four', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'known', ""'Sons"", 'Ipswich', 'Spenser', 'Academy', 'who', 'are', 'more', '300', 'years', 'old', 'hide', 'powers', '17th', 'century', 'kind', 'were', 'being', 'killed', 'witch', 'hunters', 'hide', 'powers', 'away', 'most', 'people', 'meet', 'new', 'student', 'who', 'fairly', 'likable', 'friend', 'then', 'realize', 'Oh', 's***', 'banished', 'fifth', 'brother', 'returned', 'Now', 'must', 'use', 'powers', 'rescue', 'damsels', 'distress', 'destroy', 'fifth', 'brother', 'LAME', 'story', 'cluttered', 'incoherent', 'convoluted', 'abysmal', 'mess', 'storytelling.MUSIC', 'was', 'obviously', 'designed', 'teens', 'hated', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'Twilight', 'score', 'still', 'sucked', 'pretty', 'bad.ACTION', 'film', 'loaded', 'stupid', 'special', 'effects', 'cheesy', 'fight', 'scenes', 'stuffed', 'cliches', 'hot', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'save', 'scene', 'locker', 'room', 'naked', 'men', 'YAY', 'only', 'quality', 'can', 'be', 'derived', 'atrocious', 'film', 'fact', 'can', 'laugh', 'parts', ""'re"", 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'funny', 'Other', 'are', 'left', 'one', 'truly', 'awful', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'top', 'cheesy', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'treated', 'incredibly', 'boring', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Crappy', 'crappy', 'crappy.ACTING', 'actors', 'were', 'terrible', 'were', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'was', 'also', 'horrid', 'mess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accomplish', 'being', 'even', 'remotely', 'believable', 'probably', ""n't"", 'matter', 'teenage', 'girls', 'film', 'geared', 'towards', ""'ll"", 'love', 'male', 'actor', 'who', 'hot', 'horrid', 'acting.OVERALL', 'are', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'intent', 'seeing', 'film', 'just', 'fantasize', 'guys', 'six-packs', 'body', 'hair', 'pointless', 'hackneyed', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'matter', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'enjoy', 'terrible', 'musical', 'scores', 'then', 'means', 'watch', 'film', 'rest', ""'ll"", 'just', 'go', 'watch', 'Underworld', 'instead.THE', 'GOOD', 'so', 'bad', 'funny', 'moments.THE', 'BAD', 'Everything', 'else']",N/A

Of course it's a bit shallow but I enjoyed the eye candy! There were many attractive guys and a couple of attractive girls but my favorite was the blond, Reid Garwin (or Toby Hemingway in real life). Not only was he cute but I liked his character.The action was decent, some of it looked a little too ""staged"" but for the most part, it was fine. The acting was alright too although no one was really outstanding.Here's the story on the back of the DVD: ""To the students of the Spencer Academy, the Sons of Ipswich are the baddest boys on campus. But that's not all they share. The four friends also share a 300-year-old secret: they're warlocks, the teenage descendants of a 17th-century coven of witches. So when the long-banished fifth son suddenly appears and threatens to kill their loved ones, they realize they must face their enemy in order to prevent him from stealing their powers and shattering THE COVENANT forever.""Do I think you should rent this?

Not that I thought it would blow me away, but I thought it would be a cool story and some interesting fights and action sequences. About 30 minutes into the movie it became obvious that this movie was not gonna live up to my expectations. The trailer led me to believe that the story would build up to something more, but most of the interesting things from the trailer happen early on and in smaller doses than I thought. The movie starts out with them doing their best ""Lost Boys"" impression and never really gets more exciting than that. It's not very scary either. The creepiest thing is the spiders which were creepier in that Harry friggin Potter movie. The dialog is campy and corny - just watch the ""Little Miss Muffet"" scene and see if you don't wince at how ridiculous it sounds. The story is weak too since there are absolutely no surprises and things are never really explained worth a flip. For instance, they never explain what the heck a ""darkling"" is or what the point of it is either. If this isn't enough to dissuade you from wasting your time with this, then just know there is a bonfire scene and a dancing scene complete with jukebox. Oh and what was the deal with the 4th ""brother""? Did he even need to be in the movie? All he did was chime in with like 2 lines the whole movie and stand around.

What difference does that make if they can all act? One top named actor said he would  never act with one of these rappers-turned-actors because they haven't ""paid their dues"". Again, if they can act, does it matter if L.L. Cool J did not go to Juliard? This movie was  probably meant to appeal to young women 16-25, but isn't it every guys' fantasy to have these kind of powers and beat each other sensless? I know I used to dream of having these kinds of powers and dealing with school bullies and ""in crowders"" when I was in school. The movie was very good. If , I would change anything though or add it to the sequel, I would have had Chase put Caleb's other two warlock friends in danger or even beat them senselss. It may have even added to the film if one of the four were killed by Chase.The physcial fights between Caleb and Chase were very well done, although his ""ascension"" did not help him as much as expected. There was a big build up to Caleb's ascension, but when it happened, he just continued to get beaten and overpowered by Caleb. If Caleb had killed the Warlock on the motorcycle and made him will him his power before dying, at the threat of killing his cursed grilfriend, this would have added to the climactic battle and would've explained Chase's equalling Caleb's ""ascension"" powers.  Calebs ascension powers should have been what made him equal and surpass Chase's powers, not Caleb's father's sacrifice. Chase should have killed Caleb's father after he refused to will him his powers.All of the posing when Caleb and Chase were fighting was very good and comic bookish.

To hide themselves, they form a secret Covenant which will help protect their ancestors from being hunted down.Fast forward to the present day and four teenagers are forced to live in the modern day with these powers, though they can't resist the temptation of using them now and again. Caleb Danvers is coming up to his 18th Birthday and will thus ascend to the next level of this mysterious power, although a mysterious 5th power is seeking to destroy Caleb and take it from him.The Review: This was a surprisingly entertaining film which, for the teenage movie genre was very unique. The friendship between the four boys, and the development of the relationship between Caleb (Strait) and Sarah (Ramsey) are in my eyes very believable which leads you into caring for these characters on another level. Being of the story behind this movie and the overall format, I felt that the director was trying way too hard to bring up the age rating by adding some random pointless nudity and language in an attempt to have it appeal to an older audience. The scene transition I felt didn't work as well as I'd hoped, some scenes will feature some really cool and memorable moments, e.g. the scene where Caleb is driving and he hits an 18 wheeler head on. This type of scene would have you think this is worthy of a 5 star rating but then the next scene would contain some extremely corny dialogue which will make you want to bury your head in your hands in shame.Overall this is an entertaining film that you will enjoy if you don't watch it with this expectation that you're getting a 5 star script and 5 star acting.",3,Wasn't as bad as I was lead to believe.,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,1790,"['Story', '1692', 'five', 'families', 'Ipswich', 'colony', 'Massachusetts', 'hold', 'mysterious', 'power', 'are', 'forced', 'hide', 'society', 'fear', 'being', 'executed', 'witches', 'hide', 'form', 'secret', 'Covenant', 'will', 'help', 'protect', 'ancestors', 'being', 'hunted', 'down.Fast', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'four', 'teenagers', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'modern', 'day', 'powers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'temptation', 'using', 'now', 'again', 'Caleb', 'Danvers', 'coming', 'up', '18th', 'Birthday', 'will', 'thus', 'ascend', 'next', 'level', 'mysterious', 'power', 'mysterious', '5th', 'power', 'seeking', 'destroy', 'Caleb', 'take', 'him.The', 'Review', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'teenage', 'movie', 'genre', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'friendship', 'four', 'boys', 'development', 'relationship', 'Caleb', 'Strait', 'Sarah', 'Ramsey', 'are', 'eyes', 'very', 'believable', 'caring', 'characters', 'level', 'Being', 'story', 'movie', 'overall', 'format', 'felt', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'bring', 'up', 'age', 'rating', 'adding', 'random', 'pointless', 'nudity', 'language', 'attempt', 'have', 'appeal', 'older', 'audience', 'scene', 'transition', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'scenes', 'will', 'feature', 'really', 'cool', 'memorable', 'moments', 'e.g', 'scene', 'where', 'Caleb', 'driving', '18', 'wheeler', 'head', 'type', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'think', 'worthy', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'would', 'contain', 'extremely', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'bury', 'head', 'hands', 'shame.Overall', 'entertaining', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'expectation', ""'re"", 'getting', '5', 'star', 'script', '5', 'star', 'acting']",N/A

The subject matter and mythology surrounding witchcraft is fascinating, and provides an intriguing background for this movie. The special effects are breathtaking and intense, and (I'm not going to lie) it doesn't hurt that the male leads are all pretty easy on the eyes.The details of the story are difficult to explain without giving too much away. Caleb and his friends are whats known as the Sons of Ipswich. They are the first born sons of the five founding families of their town in Massechusetts. In the past, during the notorious witch hunt in Massechusetts, their families were all accused of practicing witchcraft....and their accusers were right. Caleb and his friends each possess powers and supernatural abilities beyond anything you've ever seen. When they turn 18, their powers will reach their peak potential, and they will ""ascend"". But as in all things in nature, there is a delicate balance that must be maintained, and these powers come with a price.I enjoyed this film mostly for the ridiculously awesome special effects. From a cinematography standpoint, it's very well made, and if for nothing else, at least watch this movie once to see all the cool things they do with camera angles and special effects.One of the things I liked most about this film was it's use of witchcraft mythology. Instead of the usual witchraft movies, such as ""The Craft"", this one used males instead of females as it's main characters/witches (I think that makes them warlocks). I found the backstory of their covenant almost more interesting than the present day story they were trying to tell. I wanted to hear more! I truly hope they make a sequel so that we can hear more witchcraft mythology, because I find it very fascinating.Admittedly, the guys who play the lead characters *do* look like they walked right off the pages of an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog...but why is it such a bad thing that they're good looking? (also, I should confess that there is a pool scene in the film that was so obviously put there specifically to show off these guys in their bathing suits.

1030695,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000K4WPCC,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 4]","At a certain point in ""The Covenant""--a supernatural thriller from Renny Harlin--Sarah Wenham (Laura Ramsey) asks her roommate, Kate Tunney (Jessica Lucas), ""Why are they called the Ipswitch Family? Are they like a boy band?"" I knew that the audience was supposed to forget that line as soon as it was spoken, but it actually got me thinking. She was referring to a group of four teenage friends just entering college: Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait), Pogue Parry (Taylor Kitsch), Reid Garwin (Toby Hemingway), and Tyler Sims (Chance Crawford). Each one is the descendent from families belonging to Ipswitch, a seventeenth century New England colony. Each one also has magical powers that have been kept secret from the rest of the world.The way they carried themselves, both together and apart, made them seem very much like a boy band: not only do their good looks instill a mixture of fascination, envy, lust, and hatred in those they meet, they also each have distinctive personality traits that certain boy band members are known for. (I exempt Tyler, not only from my analogy, but from my review, as well. His role in the film is virtually nonexistent, and I can't say what personality type he represents. Isn't a covenant of four supposed to have four equally active members? Dropping his character would have done nothing to damage the story, save for a few lines of dialogue.) Caleb would be the Nice, Brave One of the group (if they were singers, he would be the lead), who immediately shows an interest in Sarah. Pogue would be the Quiet But Fun One. Reid--the less prominent member--would be the Reckless Bad Boy, using his powers a little too freely for his own good.The film goes one step further by introducing a new boy band personality type: the Evil One. This would be Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan), the latest transfer student. Apparently, one of his descendents was banished from the Ipswitch colony. Years later Chase learned of his family history and became jealous, turning him into a raging, homicidal wizard. He then made a vow to find Caleb and rob him of his power. This is because he uses his own supply far too often. Apparently, those with magical powers aren't supposed to use them so haphazardly; one can get addicted to it, leading to extreme weakness and premature aging (incidentally, this tendency to overuse is showing in Reid, giving Caleb cause for concern). How interesting that the filmmakers likened displays of magic to illicit drug use; you don't often hear about it being bad for your health.But it seems to be helping Chase along quite nicely. Our four heroes, on the other hand, don't yet know what's going on. But they'd better find out soon, because some very strange things are happening. They see visions of a grotesque teenage ghost, specifically the ghost of a college student who mysteriously died after a late-night beach party. Sarah has a dream that she and Kate are attacked by a swarm of spiders. Caleb eventually sees how it all connects with him; his eighteenth birthday is fast approaching, and on that day, his powers will reach full maturity (it happens to all people of such ability; it's a moment called Ascending). He also sees that only he has the ability to stop Chase before its too late.The day I saw ""The Covenant,"" it seemed that the plot details were lost on the audience, most of which were young teenage girls. They went into it like they would for a boy band concert, continuously hooting and hollering at the four main characters every time they appeared (they got especially loud during a scene of competitive swimming). But this is a film about supernatural powers set in modern day New England. Such an idea had a lot of potential, most of which was wasted on physical eye candy. The four young men may have been blessed with good looks, but they also go listlessly from scene to scene.I was hoping for something that didn't make the actors' appearances the only point of interest. I say this because any film with such a shallow exterior is difficult to fully absorb. It becomes especially trying to expose what lies underneath: if one can look past the eye candy, he or she will often discover that a film has some pretty entertaining qualities. In this case, an actual story is being told, one that could have been fun had it been given half a chance.One thing it did get right was creating an atmosphere. The film's look was classically like that of a horror movie, with every exterior scene encased in fog, shadow, rain, or any combination of the three. I distinctly remember the first scene, in which the Ipswitch Boys jumped from a beachfront cliff (and needless to say, they land safely on the shore). The shot was pointed up at the characters, giving the audience a clear view of the cloudy, moonlit sky. Most of the interior scenes worked just as well, each one looking like a Haunted House film. Every hallway was long, empty, and dark, with only flashes of lightening serving as light. It was an absolutely dead-on look for the film as a whole; it only goes to show that the methods traditionally used to frighten an audience still work.But unless you're sixteen and female, this film doesn't have much to offer apart from atmosphere. On reflection, the story is actually quite good, especially when you factor in a number of very impressive digital shots. (Example: while driving, Caleb is hit by a truck. Not only does he not die, the fragments of his car also come back together) But in the moment, the story is hidden by a facade, one that would appeal only to a select group of individuals. I really wanted to recommend ""The Covenant."" Part of me still does. But I just can't; it's simply too bogged down by unnecessary shots and improperly developed characters (such as Caleb's mother, played by Wendy Crewson). Maybe the Ipswitch Family should become a boy band; at least then, they would know exactly which audience to market their movie to.",3,I Was a Teenage Warlock,1157673600,"09 8,

THE COVENANT is great!! It opens up with the fab four sons of Ipswich taking a header off a cliff, their unique way of making an entrance to a bonfire rave. Right away, witchcraft is afoot, but it's such a goof, just some homeboys out having a good time. The four sons can trace their bloodline back to the Salem witch hunts, which obviously their line survived. The eldest male in each family gets a taste of their power when they are thirteen, but fully reach their power when they ""ascend"" at the age of eighteen. Caleb, the oldest of the four, is set to ascend in a couple of days on his birthday and he dreads this. His father abused the power when he was younger and as a result, prematurely aged as the power drained his body, giving him the appearance of a horribly ancient being. Because of this, Caleb vows to never abuse this power.But with the appearance of a transfer student, Chase, things quickly go bad.  There is the death of a student, the appearance of darklings, sudden illnesses and tragic accidents. Chase isn't who he appears to be. He is the lost fifth son of Ipswich and he wants Caleb's power and intends to get it any way he can.To say anymore would spoil the fun, and this was a blast!!! The special effects are great!!

The candy is nice for the eyes, but it would have been nice to have a little meat for the brain as well.Ipswich has four (used to be five) witch families, and the eldest son inherits a dangerous bunch of magic in his early teens, before coming into his full power at eighteen (do I smell another magic/sexual maturity analogy here?). They mainly use these powers as... well, the way you'd expect any teen boys to. But then the body of a student is found in a car, and the sons of Ipswich are suspected.And Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait) starts to figure out that something weird is happening -- ghosts, magical peeping-toms, and a mysterious student who just transferred there. Not only must Caleb stop the magical attacks -- but keep his own burgeoning powers under control too, as he confronts the secret enemy.""The Covenant"" is pure fluff from start to finish, and at times it feels like it isn't aspiring to be much more -- the plot is quite basic and rather suspenseless, since the bad guy practically has a ""REALLY SINISTER AND CREEPY"" sign around his neck -- and a five-year-old could guess who he is just by the backstory.In a way, it feels bad to kick such an unpretentiously popcorn movie, but it could have been way better -- instead, it's loaded with with cliches galore. There are a few cool scenes, such as a car flying apart and reconstructing -- quite nice, visually speaking.But the rest of the time, it's just predictable and rather cheesy -- dialogue is extremely teen-movie (""You ready to say ""uncle""?"" ""I'm ready for you to go to hell!""), and the climax is like a magic-powerball-throwing fight from a bad children's anime.The actors are there basically for the looks, and they form a pretty typical circle -- good boy, shy boy, bad boy, and mischief-maker.

This movie did not deliver but isn't that the norm nowadays when it comes to directing a film.The acting was subpar, making me believe that casting for this flick consisted of going to the local burger joint at an upper middle class town and pointing a finger at those people needed for an upcoming witch movie. Truly a sad thing.The plot wasn't all that bad but it needed professionals to develop it and not the crew that worked on The Covenant. I hate having to keep using this line but ""it had so much potential"" and that's the truth.Bottom line, if you have teenagers who like the supernatural like watching the television show supernatural, then by all means buy them this DVD.

It is now present time and four of the families are represented by young hunks, the Ipswich Guys, who are attending a private school in autumnal Massachusetts, careful to keep their Power hidden for the most part: the Power is the ability to do fantastic feats of force and sorcery which, if it is used to much carries the punishment of aging the body quickly...  The four lads are Caleb (20-year old stud model Steven Strait), Pogue (sculpted body man Taylor Kitsch), Tyler (Chace Crawford), and Reid (Toby Hemingway) and aside from Caleb and Pogue the other two are pretty much set decoration, so minimal are their lines and involvement.  Into this setting comes one Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan, a handsome lad from 'The Architect') who just happens to be the surviving member of the fifth family and who is greedy for Power beyond his own abilities.A series of confrontations results in Caleb facing Chase in a showdown, but not before the girls involved with the good guys - Caleb's girlfriend Sarah (Laura Ramsey) and Pogue's girlfriend Kate (Jessica Lucas), equally as beautiful as their partners are handsome - critically enter the picture.  There is, of course, a showdown in an old ancestral barn during the requisite thunder and lightning storm background which serves as a stage for the silly computer generated graphics that throw Caleb and Chase around with jellyfish balls and the like.  The ending makes it very clear that a sequel (probably more than one) is planned and if that means more exposure for this attractive young cast of actors, bring it on.Director Renny Harlin and writer J.S. Cardone know they have a kitschy formula movie and seem to have a great time making it as fun and creepy as possible - good music, great lighting and camera work, and a penchant for locker room shower scenes that guarantee success with the intended audience.

1030713,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000K4WPCC,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 7]","No one knows where the Power came from. In 1692, in the Massachusetts colony of Ipswich, five powerful families steeped in the dark arts form a covenant. One of the families, seeking to gain more power, is exiled. For hundreds of years, nary a trace was found of that banished family - until now. Cut to the present, where the focus is on the Sons of Ipswich, four teenage students, all around 16 and 17 years of age - Caleb, Reid, Tyler, and Pogue - attending the priveleged Spencer Academy.These kids, descendants of the magical families, are gifted with supernatural powers passed on by their ancestry. But the caveat is that the more the addictive powers are used, the more they prematurely age the user. And when they turn 18, they will ""ascend,"" thereby increasing their powers a thousandfold. In the past, the overriding temptation to use these powers have often proved to be irresistable to others, at the cost of their lives. Tonight, unbeknownst to the Sons of Ipswich, the bloodline of the long-vanished family returns.At the start of the new school year, an outdoor party is being held. The Sons of Ipswich show up, having dropped off from a cliff. There, they meet the acquaintances of newcomers Sarah Wendham (Laura Ramsey) and Chase Collins (Sebastian Stan), both of whom promptly ingratiate themselves into the group. Caleb Danvers (Steven Strait, from Sky High), the oldest and most level headed of the Ipswich group, and mere days away from his 18th birthday, falls for Sarah, who reciprocates the attraction, to the consternation of Reid, the youngest and most rebellious. Meanwhile, a triangle forms amongst Pogue, new kid Chase, and Pogue's girl and Sarah's roomie Kate (Jessica Lucas).The creepiness begins when that same party produces the dead body of a student, who seemingly died from a drug overdose. That night, Sarah gets the feeling she is being watched in the showers - and she's right. Meanwhile, Caleb suddenly wakes up, sensing that someone has used the Power. The next morning, he's driving his car when a darkling - a manifestation of the dead boy - suddenly appears in the passenger seat, startling the bejeezus out of Caleb and causing him to collide head on with a truck. But Caleb's got the Power, and he survives without a scratch. You've seen the trailer.These unsettling incidents are just harbingers of more sinister events in the offing. It quickly becomes evident to Caleb that a malignant, supernatural force is on the prowl. Related incidents soon give rise to suspicions and jealousies amongst the Sons of Ipswich, threatening to dissolve their close-knit group. In the end, Caleb must summon his powers, even if it prematurely kills him, to save all that he loves against a warlock a thousand times more powerful than he.The trailer doesn't quite lie; this is a fun popcorn flick. The Covenant is reminiscent of The Lost Boys and The Craft in its hip,  horror-laden, teenage sensibilities. However, it improves on those films in the CGI department. The Covenant boasts some pretty cool f/x sequences. While not as inventive as I had hoped, the film does come up with neat ways of showcasing the young warlocks' powers. I only wish that it had an R rating, instead of PG-13. I wanted even darker, more brooding, and more horrific scenes. But that's just the ghoul in me.Starring a bunch of unknown, beautiful kids - but kids that are up and coming - this is a rollicking entry in the action/horror genre. Steven Strait, Taylor Kitsch, and Sebastian Stan stand out, all bringing an earnest and focused screen presence to the flick. Stan, in particular, does his best to chew up the scenery while resembling Jason Priestley more than a bit. Laura Ramsey, well, she doesn't bring in the sexy as much as usher in the cute. The sexy label adheres better to her roommate Jessica Lucas, who is hot, while Steven Strait and Taylor Kitsch (Pogue) seem to have taken over the smouldering look department.No complaints about the production values. This is a good-looking film, saturated in dark, brooding colors and tones, while the bangin' hard rock soundtrack serves to drive the story and lends immediacy to the scenes. With fantastic visuals, a complement of well-meaning young actors, and an interesting supernatural premise, The Covenant also benefits with the insertion of certain themes cloaked under the guise of fantasy horror - notably, the themes of addiction and that sense of immortality and invincibility that you feel when you are young.I quite liked this movie so I hesitate to state the negatives, but you gotta be honest, right? So, here goes. The movie would've been greatly served with a tighter script (how many times have we seen the female lead tell the hero, ""I'm scared"" and the hero respond with a ""Don't be""?). There are parts in the middle that seemed to plod and drag on for too long. Like I said before, maybe an R rating would have improved the film, made it more scary. And there isn't enough jeopardy. Maybe, you'll disagree, but I felt there weren't enough victims, leaving the stakes not as high as they should've been. The ending seems a bit rushed and feels abrupt. Frankly, I expected more from the showdown between Caleb and the exiled descendant of Ipswich (by the way, I feel like a numbnut not saying the person's name; it's stupendously obvious, as the film doesn't even really try to camouflage the baddie's identity). And the other Sons of Ipswich could've been showcased more (Tyler was basically non-existent). Anyway, by the end, I didn't get the sense that everything had been resolved. Maybe the powers that be are thinking sequel? I wouldn't mind.Anyway, it's not a great film, merely a decent one, but one which I do recommend. I say it's around three and a half stars. So, what else is there to say? If you have some time to kill, you could do worse than watch this film. Hope this helps make up your mind.",4,"""Ooooooooh - witchy!!""",1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,5898,"['one', 'where', 'Power', 'came', '1692', 'Massachusetts', 'colony', 'Ipswich', 'five', 'powerful',

I like sic-fi and fantasy movies. I even like those which focus on teenagers (sometimes). But the acting in this one was so bad I had a hard time not rolling my eyes every other minute or so.

The acting and directing are horrible in this flick, but, perhaps, what is even more disturbing is the ridiculous plot and execution thereof.  ""The Covenant"" is actually more of a laughable and pathetic attempt at teenaged Sci-fi movie that would even make proponents of the Sci-fi channel sheepishly red.  Regardless, this certainly is not horror.  In fact, the idea of horror does not even enter into the equation with this movie because it is so absurd.  Seeing these descendants of witches or whatever you want to call them and their so-called powers looked like a cheap attempt at a Harry Potter movie.  If you want to call it a very poor attempt at Sci-fi movie, I would be okay with that, but the idea that someone has the audacity to call this a horror movie is simply insulting to those that cherish the horror genre.  In short, do not fall into the trap of thinking that this is a horror movie because there is nothing scary or horrifying about it.  Actually, I have seen enough movies like this to put them in a genre all their own...I call it the ""Garbage"" genre, and ""The Covenant"" makes a fine addition to it.  If you don't die laughing about how pathetic this movie is, you will die crying that you wasted your time watching this garbage, so you can't win either way.

I'm not sure what possessed me to rent the movie--I think because it had gotten 4 stars on Netflix and because it was based on a comic book--but I did.I have to tell you, I was VERY entertained by this movie. Had I watched this as a teen girl, I think I would have had a stroke when watching Steven Strait and some of those hot bodies onscreen. Yikes!The cinematography and settings were gorgeous. I live in the Northeast and our gorgeous autumns were captured fantastically. The sound track was quite good, which surprised me, as was the acting. I don't care if the main ""Son of Ipswitch"" was a former model or not--he is an INCREDIBLE actor!I was glued to the screen and, personally, loved the ""water bubble"" fights. My husband mentioned that he'd like to see more varied special effects--like the thread-like light tentacles--but I was perfectly happy seeing the energy balls. Personally, I don't like blood and gore (which is why I don't normally go for blatant slashers or cruelty), so I got to see some great fights without the blood!I'm glad they used mostly unknown actors (although my husband tells me that the mother was in the Santa Clause movies...); it made the plot more believable, in my opinion. (Well, believable for a sci-fi type movie...)One thing I don't understand, though: the mother says to the son that ""ascending makes you 1,000 more powerful"", yet, he was no match for the other kid until his Dad willed his power to him? I mean, I know willing power makes you strong, but if ascending was truly 1,000 powerful, wouldn't he have kicked stronger butt even BEFORE his Dad willed him his portion?Anyway, if you're looking for an escapist movie, this is a great film for forgetting the troubles of the day.

Sadly, this was not the case.The plot of the movie made me want to see it, basically it revolves around the four sons of ipswich, whom inherited their powers from their family bloodlines.  They receive these powers at the age of thirteen in the form of a test.They can control gravity, command objects at will, and fight like Neo in Matrix.  The bad thing is, every time they use their powers--which are completely addicting, and high seductive, they loose some of their life.  Upon turning 18 they ""ascend"" and are giving their full power. This is the where most of their relatives have gotten in trouble, and quickly become old young-men as their bodies cannot handle the power.As stated, thats a great concept, especially if you enjoyed the novel ""The Dreamcatcher"" by Stephen King, which they give acknowledge too in the film, as their powers are based in part on that novel.  Where the movie falls apart for me, isn't the loose plot holes, its not the obsessive amount of tired horror cliches--girls in showers, lightening every few minutes, etc, nor is it the fact that some of the models look the ""same""(multiple long haired models, that I at first had trouble telling the difference between two of the brothers and another character), it's the shoddy acting that does it for me.  I can understand they are young, and maybe the producers decided on Abercrombie models (they may or may not be actual Abercrombie models, tis just a cliched stereotype for a cliche inducing movie), opposed to real actors to further sell the movie, but I haven't watched a movie so dry in ages.  I watch low budget flicks, straight to dvd, and sci-fi movie of the week films, which is a round about way to say I can tolerate some bad acting, however, the acting in this movie makes even the worst of those seem almost Shakespearian in nature.The main actor is about on the level of an early Keanu Reeves at about 50% of the skill.  Thats to say hardly any emphasis on words, and very dry looks and extremely monotonous, it was really hard to watch. The only reason I completed the movie, was because of the amazing work done by the special effects crew.  Their work is top-notch.  Sadly I cannot say the same about anything else in this movie.

Caleb's archnemesis is Chase, the [...] son of one of the Witches of Ipswich. Chase is far more powerful than Caleb because the former has the essence of his own Ascension plus his father's own power, which he took by force. Caleb finds himself trying to fend off Chase's assaults against him, his friends and his girlfriend.

This movie concerns another town where a number of witch families have survived.  Witches have quite a bit of power and it increases exponentially on their eighteenth birthdays.  In this film we meet a group of guys getting close to their increased power.  Using power is addictive and destructive.  While the power seduces one to use it, it also makes them age very rapidly.  Now things are starting to go wrong and the young witches start to wonder about one another.It seems that someone is using power and using it big.  The young family members take it upon themselves to find out who it is and try and stop it.  Eventually the culprit is found out and final moves are made leading to a final magic battle.Definitely not what I was expecting based on the trailer.  One of the best effects in the film has a witch in an accident with a truck.  He and his car reform after being smashed by the truck.  This is a great bit of special effects but does not fit with the ability levels as seen later in the film.  Our main characters are under eighteen but look much older.  They hang out in bars.

1030735,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000K4WPCC,Lee Armstrong,"[37, 50]","Finnish director Renny Hurlin has helmed numerous pictures since re-locating to Hollywood.  Among them are ""Mindhunters,"" ""Exorcist: The Beginning AKA Exorcist 4,"" ""Die Hard 2,"" & ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" with Geena Davis & Samuel L. Jackson.  Enjoying pictures with a bit of magic, the supernatural or paranormal, ""The Covenant"" was a film I liked.  Screenwriter J.S. Cardone who's done quite a few ""B"" flicks including ""The Forsaken"" & ""The Marksman"" perhaps has a few too many characters floating in & out, but delivers enough story to let the actors show their wares and the special effects folks to go crazy as they climax.  Male model Steven Strait plays Caleb Danvers.  Strait was previously in ""Sky High"" & ""Undiscovered"" & plays the lead Son of Ipswitch in this film.  He comes across as a sympathetic good guy who treats his mother well, resists the dark side & likes the pretty girl.  Taylor Kitsch who was in ""John Tucker Must Die"" plays Pogue Perry, another of the sons.  In his first film, Toby Hemingway bares his backside in the boys' locker room and otherwise comes across as a rebellious teenager that we suspect as the bad guy for the middle part of the film.  Sebastian Stan in his first film -- a ""Law & Order"" episode being a previous credit -- plays the good-looking heavy Chase Collins who comes back to exact revenge on behalf of his ancestors.  He picks a fight in the locker room and makes jokes about the size of Aaron Abbott's private anatomy, which is a good way to pick a fight in a guy's locker room.  Kyle Schmid who was in ""A History of Violence"" plays the tough looking teen who can't withstand the magical punch of Collins.  When Collins knocks out lead Caleb Danvers in a swimming contest with a bit of the evil eye, the duel is set.  The two female leads who were both in ""She's the Man"" are Laura Ramsey who plays Sarah Wenham, Caleb's fancy and Jessica Lucas who plays Pogue's sweetheart Kate Tunney.  Chase shows what a bad guy he is with legions of spider tricks to bite and sideline the girls.  There are several scary scenes including a ""Psyco""-like shower scene where the demonic blur breaks a light bulb and a glazed-eye darkling keeps popping up in the Sons of Ipswitch's dreams.  The Spencer Academy serves as a gothic setting filled with lots of rain, lightning and dark clouds.  When the climactic match occurs and Sarah floats amid a flaming barn, Caleb's mother Evelyn heads off to plead with Daddy Danvers to strengthen his boy's powers during the magical duel.  Wendy Crewson who has a long list of TV & film credits including a lead in the Canadian film ""Suddenly Naked,"" ""Bicentennial Man,"" & ""To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday"" plays the mother.  The film roars to its climax with Collins' body disappearing to leave just enough room for a sequel should this film do well at the box-office.  There are a lot of fresh faces -- not to mention fresh behinds -- in this film to probably launch a couple of careers as we look back a few years from now.  It's not a complex plot, but it was well done.

But ultimately it doesn't really go anywhere.  According to the legend, five families sought and got vast magical powers, but at a price.  After they turn eighteen, the oldest males in those families got a lot of power, but they exchanged their youth for using it.  The trick is moderation, which a lot of the heirs to the power haven't been able to manage.  Also, it's interesting to see that the previous generation all seemed to settle down and have kids at about the same time.Renny Harlin is known for his action films (LEON:  THE PROFESSIONAL) and definitely delivers a stylish presentation here.THE COVENANT starts out with a creepy bang, then segues right into the high school pecking order problem that seems to be at the heart of so many of these films.  Enough conflict is generated right off the bat to keep the viewer's interest, but none of the characters ever become truly three-dimensional, seeming to exist only to keep the plot moving.  But the visual aspects of the film -- the color and the special effects -- work well enough that there's plenty of eye candy.  There are also plenty of shots of girls in underwear.The problems lie in a lack of true resolution at the end, breakout twists and turns of the plot, and too many coincidences.  One coincidence I had a problem with overall was that every heir to the power seemed to start a family at the same time.  I didn't know why all five heirs had to be in high school at the same time.  Even at the end, there's no feeling of closure.  THE COVENANT feels very much like the start of a franchise, and that's not good.  Franchises start best by being really good one-offs.THE COVENANT is primarily a guy's film.  Meant for male bonding.  Definitely not a date movie because there's just too much testosterone.  But the action is good, the girls are cute, and the cars are cool.

If approached on that basis, it's quite passable and indeed quite slick in it's production.  The story is Twilight - lite, but transposed to the world of witches rather than vampires, and with far less teen-angst.  Four teenage friends in Ipswich hold a secret - they are actually descendents of witches, and have special powers.. powers which are magnified when they reach their 18th birthday.  However, the powers come at a terrible cost.  Two newcomers to the private school they attend make things complicated - a beautiful woman (mmhh.. wonder what happens there, then...) and another schoolboy - who turns out to have a link to the other 4.  The hero finds himself having to choose what to tell the lady about his secret - and just maybe he will have to make a decision... his powers, or the girl.It's not rocket science, and holds few surprises.  The cast are all standard eye candy Hollywood teens, the school seemingly entirely populated by perfect specimens.  The production looks glossy but is brilliantly clear in this bluray transfer - The dark scenes (and there are plenty of those) are crystal clear, the condensation in the obligatory ""woman-feels-like-she-is-being-watched-in-the-shower"" scene actually feels real, and the few special effects scenes - the car crashing into the truck, for example, are just vivid enough in HD in sight and sound to help wake you up just when you are getting bored with the dragging plot.  Watch out for the surprisingly convincing cgi spider.The ending feels more like a set up for a sequel than a satisfying resolution in itself, but overall if you're not expecting much - there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours.

1030761,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000K4WPCC,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","The Covenant (Renny Harlin, 2006)Sometimes, when you put two negative forces together, you get a positive. So there was hope that when director Renny Harlin, who hasn't made a good movie in... well, okay, ever, and writer J. S. Cardone, who's not awful when he's directing (Wicked Little Things was his), but is awful when he's writing (The Forsaken and Alien Hunter both bear his mark), the collision would result in something blindingly brilliant, the kind of movie that proved both actually had serious chops, though it would probably be a fluke. Unfortunately, and somewhat predictably, it was not to be.The Covenant is the deeply confusing, badly-paced, incredibly silly story of five modern-day kids who are descended from the five founding families of Ipswich, Massachusetts, where the Salem Witch Trials supposedly began. Four of the families survived the witch trials, and the scions of each clan are about to turn eighteen (and ""ascend"" into their full power). The de facto leader of the bunch is Caleb (Sky High's Steven Strait), who's on the verge of turning eighteen. Pogue (Snakes on a Plane's Taylor Kitsch) is his best friend. Opposite these two are Reid (Toby Hemingway, recently of Feast of Love) and his best friend Tyler (Chace Crawford of Gossip Girl fame). While their bonds run deep, Caleb and Reid are constantly at odds; Reid likes to use his power (for, yes, they're all witches) despite the fact that overuse of the power turns one into a withered husk, while Caleb counsels moderation. As they begin their senior year at an exclusive private high school, two disruptive forces enter the playing field: Sarah (Venom's Laura Ramsey), to whom Caleb immediately gravitates, and Chase (Red Doors' Sebastian Stan), whom Pogue suspects of moving in on Pogue's girl Kate (Cloverfield's Jessica Lucas), who also happens to be Sarah's roommate. To top it all off, there are a bunch of minor subplots running around in the first half of the film. Given all this, and me just touching the tip of the iceberg, is it any wonder the thirty-second TV spots made absolutely no sense?Watching the entire ninety-minute film doesn't make things much better. A little more time is taken to explain things, but not much. It doesn't help that it's obvious the film is setting up a straw man as the villain (for the real villain must be revealed later on, ha-HA!). This is forgivable, and handled well, of course, it can be an excellent plot device. The problem is it's not handled well at all; after the big reveal halfway through the film, the straw man simply disappears into thin air, never to be seen again. This is the case with a number of those minor subplots I mentioned when attempting to recount the labyrinthine first half of the script, as well; it seems the second half is the movie everyone here wanted to make, but they didn't have anything to set it up, so they grafted on another, more complex (and more interesting) script that no one would produce. Done right and extended correctly, the first half of this movie would have made an interesting thriller. Done right and extended correctly, the second half of this movie would have been a mightily enjoyable, brainless action flick (though the zooming-ball-of-water special effects should really have been thought through a little better). Squashed together, neither works. It doesn't help that most of the actors here are at best barely competent (it's ironic that Jessica Lucas, by far the most experienced actor here who gets more than a minute of screen time, is the most minor of the seven main characters). One wonders if others were approached beforehand, took one look at the script, and fled screaming in terror. *",1,Why did I even bother?

The basic storyline could have worked, but whether due to poor scripting, poor direction or poor acting, in the end, it just doesn't come together.The Sons of Ipswich are a small group of 4 teen boys who are privileged, drive amazingly expensive cars or motorcycles and attend a preppy Goth co-ed boarding school.  They are just like the other kids, with one glaring exception - - because they have been descended from certain Ipswich, Massachusetts residents of the 1600s, they are ""blessed"" with warlock-like powers, which enable them to do all sorts of teen boy cool things, like outrun the police, fly off cliffs and cause the short skirts of teen girls to fly up, revealing their panty choice - - if any. Their world gets turned upside down when a boy is found dead and the Sons of Ipswich begin having strange visions.  Is it because they are preparing to turn 18, when they allegedly come into their full powers?  Or is it the new boy in town?Despite a few cool special effects and some moments that lead you to believe something scary is happening, ""The Covenant"" really fails to deliver.  Nothing truly scary happens and some of the special effects aren't really explained.  The film tends to drag on in parts and made me wish that it would hurry up and get to the ""good stuff"" - - which failed to materialize.  The female roles are little more than window dressing as the movie belongs to the male characters - - although the acting, all around, is inconsistent and not wholly convincing.All in all, the movie feels choppy - - almost as though huge sections were edited out.  Too much time is spent showcasing the various leads hanging out, in school, etc. when not enough background is given.  How did they get these powers?  Exactly what is going to happen to them when they turn 18?  How did one of their fathers die?  Basically, the movie is too light and fluffy, and not dark enough to really grip you.If you want a goth/witches/warlock/vampire movie with a teen cast that has a good story, get ""The Lost Boys"" instead.

1030771,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000K4WPCC,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 2]","Far better than its own trailers made it look, ""The Covenant"" is actually a well-done, thoroughly fun and rewarding horror movie laced with fantasy elements.  Using the dark side of magic and a conflict between rival warlocks has made for a good, fresh film.In the town of Ipswich, there are four young male warlocks, each a descendant of one of the five founding families of the little New England town from centuries ago.  In a bit of a novel twist, each of the four are possessed of near-limitless power (that's near-limitless by comparison with normal humans; presumably the warlocks don't reach the levels of, say, Gandalf from Lord Of The Rings or Dr. Strange from Marvel Comics) but can only use it in extremely small doses, because it rapidly affects its own wielder, causing them to age and basically rot from the inside out if used too often.  Basically the warlocks are the good guys, even if they are rather drunk on their own power, using small bursts of it to stage death-defying stunts to entertain themselves and to make themselves the coolest, most popular guys in their school.  They're even known as the 'Lords Of Ipswich' by their peers who have no knowledge of their supernatural attributes.  They run the gamut from pretty straight-laced to rebellious and a bit unlikable at first, but basically there's been no great conflict in the town.  Until a fifth warlock arrives on the scene, a descendant of the 'other' founding family, with very dark motivations.Although a large part of the impetus behind ""The Covenant"" was apparantly to make a horror movie centered around a group of 'hot guys' for female horror fans (and some male fans) who've felt disappointed that in most horror movies all the shower scenes/etc. usually feature girls; heterosexual male fans (and some female fans) will be glad to know that the filmmakers didn't skimp on the 'babe factor' either, so there's some treats for everyone regardless in this one.  Even apart from the sexuality aspect, the whole film is very, very well presented visually, with high production values and quality special effects.  The magic-on-magic battles may draw a few fantasy fans into horror this time around, too.  Things like characterization and plot coherence are put together much better than I would have thought than from the rather uninspiring previews I'd seen.One note: although the product info lists this DVD as Fullscreen 1.33 - 1, as far as I know only one version released has both the Fullscreen and the 2.35 - 1 Widescreen formats available on the disc.  So you're probably safe with this one if you're looking for Widescreen, but you can email Amazon and ask for verification if in doubt.Another four-and-a-half star horror movie, and one that, in contrast to the definative, seemingly sequel-barring endings of a number of recent horror films, seems ripe for a follow-up.

1030772,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000K4WPCC,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[2, 2]","I expected this film to be something of a disappointment and that's why I avoided it so long, but it was better than I expected and was a decent horror flick.  The special effects are nothing new, but cleverly done just the same.  The acting is generally good by mostly good-looking unknowns who may be future stars.  The script fumbles at times, but with an unbelievable storyline as these kinds of films typically have, you just go with the flow.  I was rather impressed with the atmospheric direction and the blue coloring that dominated the October New England sky.  This all gave the film a nice old-fashioned spooky feel.There are no great scares in this film and I don't think that's what they were setting out to create, but it does have an eerie feel at times.  It does have plenty of memorable moments and the action is well paced.  The musical scores is adequate, but overly loud and obnoxious at times.I expected another silly, youth-oriented, bad acted, low-budget movie, but was pleased to find an enjoyable film with some good young actors, with decent effects and wire stunt work, that were all enhanced by atmosphere more than jolting scares.

1030776,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B000K4WPCC,the masked reviewer,"[91, 114]","Heterosexual director Renny (DIE HARD 2, DEEP BLUE SEA) Harlin has inexplicably slipped over to the other side with his boy-band-of-witches saga, THE COVENANT. He has taken a bunch of Aberzombies, put them in some sort of prep school and given them supernatural powers, forced them to join the swim team, and thrown a few disposable girls in for good measure. And at no point does the plot of the film or the acting interfere with the camera's view of said Aberzombies' abs.This tale of the ""Sons of Ipswitch"", the gifted descendants of the founding fathers of Salem, moves along fairly briskly, with some decent effects and fun stunt work, but first and foremost, the real object of the film is to linger lasciviously upon the admirable assets of young, unironically-named Steven Strait. Seriously - the witchcraft, spiders, explosions, raves, and everything else take humble second-stage to loving shots of Strait rocking a tanktop, Strait rocking a tight v-neck t-shirt, Strait wearing a Speedo. We haven't seen male body-worship on this scale since Ryan Reynolds battled evil spirits that threatened to keep him wet and shirtless for Amityville Horror's entire running time.Strait plays Caleb, a member of an elite band of underwear models who have gone undercover as witches at a prep school in Massachusetts. (You know, so as not to attract attention). Aside from Caleb, there's the long-haired one, the blonde one, and another one who evades description entirely, to the point that it's impossible to identify him in any group scenes. The Metrosexual trickle-down has apparently left our high schools populated by an army of pomade-enhanced, cap-sleeved man-boys who are so self-approvingly pretty that the girls in their lives can do very little to distract them from their vaguely homoerotic navel-gazing. (Whereas DAZED & CONFUSED presented teen angst in a haze of pot smoke, here it is clouded by an overabundance of Axe Body Spray.)The plot of the film was summed up well enough in the commercials (and is ultimately too mind-numbingly simplistic to get into)  --  the important thing is that in this teen witch story, the witches are the popular kids. Rather than your typical ""supernaturally enhanced underdog"" story (CARRIE, THE CRAFT ), here we watch four rich, white boys who clearly dominate their school and also happen to enjoy a gift that allows them to perform magic. But, watching these kids get everything they want is not nearly as compelling as watching someone who actually NEEDS this power to get back at their enemies or overturn the status quo.The overwhelming homoeroticism of THE COVENANT includes a scene where Caleb and his best bud Pogue are talking on the phone, and both are shirtless, lying in bed, and drenched with sweat. We seriously expected the words ""MEET LOCAL GUYS!"" to flash across the top of the screen. There's also some locker room action featuring buns galore and a gay-baiting incident where another young man gets called a ""fag"" by a different long-haired boy (seriously, it's so hard to tell these guys apart...) and the young man beats his tormenter down - without actually denying the accusation. (Interestingly enough, he even makes reference to looking at the kid's manhood.) At another point an evil Aberzombie pins Caleb to the floor and kisses him on the face roughly -- In a FEAR NO EVIL kind of way, only with far more attractive men involved.So if you are looking for a satisfying all-male companion piece to the excellent teen-witch thriller THE CRAFT, keep waiting. This isn't it... If - however - you are looking for a warm-up to wet your guests appetites as they arrive for All-Male Porno night, look no further - Renny Harlin has done an admirable job.",5,THE MALE MODELS OF IPSWITCH,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,3721,"['Heterosexual', 'director', 'Renny', 'DIE', 'HARD', '2', 'DEEP', 'BLUE', 'SEA', 'Harlin', 'inexplicably', 'slipped', 'other', 'side', 'boy-band-of-witches', 'saga', 'COVENANT', 'taken', 'bunch', 'Aberzombies', 'put', 'sort', 'prep', 'school', 'given', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'forced', 'join', 'swim', 'team', 'few', 'disposable', 'girls', 'good', 'measure', 'point', 'plot', 'film', 'acting', 'interfere', 'camera', 'view', 'said', 'Aberzombies', 'abs.This', 'tale', 'Sons', 'Ipswitch', 'gifted', 'descendants', 'founding', 'fathers', 'Salem', 'moves', 'fairly', 'briskly', 'decent', 'effects', 'fun', 'stunt', 'work', 'first', 'foremost', 'real', 'object', 'film', 'linger', 'lasciviously', 'admirable', 'assets', 'young', 'unironically-named', 'Steven', 'Strait', 'Seriously', 'witchcraft', 'spiders', 'explosions', 'raves', 'everything', 'else', 'take', 'humble', 'second-stage', 'loving', 'shots', 'Strait', 'rocking', 'tanktop', 'Strait', 'rocking', 'tight', 'v-neck', 't-shirt', 'Strait', 'wearing', 'Speedo', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'male', 'body-worship', 'scale', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'battled', 'evil', 'spirits', 'threatened', 'keep', 'wet', 'shirtless', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'entire', 'running', 'time.Strait', 'plays', 'Caleb', 'member', 'elite', 'band', 'underwear', 'models', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'undercover', 'witches', 'prep', 'school', 'Massachusetts', 'know', 'so', 'not', 'attract', 'attention', 'Aside', 'Caleb', 'long-haired', 'one', 'blonde', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'description', 'entirely', 'point', 'impossible', 'identify', 'group', 'scenes', 'Metrosexual', 'trickle-down', 'apparently', 'left', 'high', 'schools', 'populated', 'army', 'pomade-enhanced', 'cap-sleeved', 'man-boys', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'self-approvingly', 'pretty', 'girls', 'lives', 'can', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'distract', 'vaguely', 'homoerotic', 'navel-gazing', 'Whereas', 'DAZED', 'CONFUSED', 'presented', 'teen', 'angst', 'haze', 'pot', 'smoke', 'here', 'clouded', 'overabundance', 'Axe', 'Body', 'Spray', 'plot', 'film', 'was', 'summed', 'up', 'well', 'enough', 'commercials', 'ultimately', 'too', 'mind-numbingly', 'simplistic', 'get', 'important', 'thing', 'teen', 'witch', 'story', 'witches', 'are', 'popular', 'kids', 'Rather', 'typical', 'supernaturally', 'enhanced', 'underdog', 'story', 'CARRIE', 'THE', 'CRAFT', 'here', 'watch', 'four', 'rich', 'white', 'boys', 'who', 'clearly', 'dominate', 'school', 'also', 'happen', 'enjoy', 'gift', 'perform', 'magic', 'watching', 'kids', 'get', 'everything', 'want', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'compelling', 'watching', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'NEEDS', 'power', 'get', 'back', 'enemies', 'overturn', 'status', 'quo.The', 'overwhelming', 'homoeroticism', 'THE', 'COVENANT', 'scene', 'where', 'Caleb', 'best', 'bud', 'Pogue', 'are', 'talking', 'phone', 'are', 'shirtless', 'lying', 'bed', 'drenched', 'sweat', 'seriously', 'expected', 'words', 'MEET', 'LOCAL', 'GUYS', 'flash', 'top', 'screen', 'also', 'locker', 'room', 'action', 'featuring', 'buns', 'galore', 'gay-baiting', 'incident', 'where', 'young', 'man', 'called', 'fag', 'different', 'long-haired', 'boy', 'seriously', 'so', 'hard', 'tell', 'guys', 'apart', 'young', 'man', 'tormenter', 'down', 'actually', 'denying', 'accusation', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'even', 'reference', 'looking', 'kid', 'manhood', 'point', 'evil', 'Aberzombie', 'Caleb', 'floor', 'face', 'roughly', 'FEAR', 'NO', 'EVIL', 'kind', 'way', 'only', 'far', 'more', 'attractive', 'men', 'involved.So', 'are', 'looking', 'satisfying', 'all-male', 'companion', 'piece', 'excellent', 'teen-witch', 'thriller', 'THE', 'CRAFT', 'keep', 'waiting', ""n't"", 'however', 'are', 'looking', 'warm-up', 'wet', 'guests', 'appetites', 'arrive', 'All-Male', 'Porno', 'night', 'look', 'further', 'Renny', 'Harlin', 'done', 'admirable', 'job']",N/A

But to be fair, it is not the worst either. Some of its special effects are impressive, and some (if not all) actors are very good. Still the film's concept about hunky American teenagers using supernatural powers may look familiar and it actually sounds like ""Harry Potter"" meets ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (or ""Craft"") meets ""The Matrix Revolutions.""The weak storyline is already a problem of ""Covenant,"" which begins with the history of the families living in the late 17th century New England. Director Renny Harlin, however, makes it worse by beginning the film with a long prologue or sentences on the screen that you have to read. In the following 30 minutes things don't get better. After the film jumps to modern times, when four teenagers including the film's hero Caleb (Steven Strait) are having fun at the party, not much is explained about the world where these characters live except Wendy Crewson's lengthy remarks about the nature of the power and the fate that awaits those who overuse it. Why all these reading and talking?There is also a murder case, which is soon forgotten until it is required to be explained later. There is also a love interest here, a girl named Sarah (Laura Ramsey) and some spooky incidents at the school, but despite its moody camerawork, none of them is really interesting. The film does not follow its story consistently until when it becomes clear who is fighting against whom and who wants what in the second half.
