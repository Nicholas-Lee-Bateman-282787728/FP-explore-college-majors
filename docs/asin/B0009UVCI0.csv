By that point I was pretty creeped out, but when the ""action"" starts this movie turns into something really fun.  When it is finished I think you realize that it was a rewarding experience to watch.  It is some sort of display of how anyone can have fun, no matter who they are, where they are, or under what circumstances.  It's actually pretty mind boggling to watch this and try and figure out how it was filmed.  It's awsome!!",5,Wow!,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,567,"['first', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'kind', 'actual', 'footage', 'aliens', 'Area', '51', 'something', 'ha-ha-ha', 'then', 'titles', 'came', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'pretty', 'creeped', 'out', 'when', 'action', 'movie', 'something', 'really', 'fun', 'When', 'finished', 'think', 'realize', 'was', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'watch', 'sort', 'display', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'where', 'are', 'what', 'circumstances', 'actually', 'pretty', 'mind', 'boggling', 'watch', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', 'awsome']",Rubber Johnny

I've seen videos on MTV longer than this.  WARNING:SPOILERBasically, here is the whole movie in a nut-shell.  A deformed kid in a wheelchair...bouncing laser beams off of his hands, to some Aphex Twin background music and a few images of what looks like raw chicken pushed up against a pane of glass.This would probably be a cool DVD....if they would've included some special features.  Commentary,easter eggs,trailers, something....anything.  Instead, it has one option on the menu screen...""play Rubber Johnny.""Whoever marketed or put out this DVD, must be really hurting for money.

913340,A26O4ZLM3H7B3H,B0009UVCI0,T Boz,"[5, 5]","Originally conceived as a promo for Aphex Twin's DrukQs album almost 4 years ago, this piece by up and coming director Chris Cunningham has been a labor of love for him, and has been filmed and edited piece by piece when time permits to be fully unleashed on the public when ready.  The story of course is about Johnny, a dangerous shapeshifting mutant kept in the cellar by his parents, where his mind alone keeps him and his dog entertained, along with the occasional ingestion of powdered cleaning products.  The ingenuity with which Cunningham (who stars as Johnny by the way) uses nightvision to give this short film an unequalled creepiness is unsettling to say the least.  All I can say is he is an acquired taste.  Having been initially exposed to his visceral vision with 1997's 'Come to Daddy' video, I can say he is among my favorite directors working today, and I cannot wait for his eventual feature length film to hit theaters.  It will be like a punch in the stomache to the public.
