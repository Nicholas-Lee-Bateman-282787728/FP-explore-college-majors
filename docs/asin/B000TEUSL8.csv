1089242,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000TEUSL8,Buenoslibros.es,"[20, 24]","Different though. There's less talk by Mike Rowe, but his voice is just perfect for this kind of thing. The end of the season episode, with the meeting with family members, is just the perfect end to a glorious show. I can feel completely identified with the human species watching it: priceless.It gives less importance to the competitive side this time. There are no provisional ""scores"" but that doesn't play as a minus. Maybe there are not so many flashbacks either. There are moments without commentary, where one finds himself ""embedded"" on the seas watching just like one more man in the crew, silently living it from the couch.Even if you don't care about the sea, watch it for its human worth. It's like an oasis away from politics and trivial city stuff.",5,As good as the first season,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,764,"['Different', 'though', 'less', 'talk', 'Mike', 'Rowe', 'voice', 'just', 'perfect', 'kind', 'thing', 'end', 'season', 'episode', 'meeting', 'family', 'members', 'just', 'perfect', 'end', 'glorious', 'show', 'can', 'feel', 'completely', 'identified', 'human', 'species', 'watching', 'priceless.It', 'less', 'importance', 'competitive', 'side', 'time', 'are', 'provisional', 'scores', ""n't"", 'play', 'minus', 'Maybe', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'moments', 'commentary', 'where', 'one', 'embedded', 'seas', 'watching', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'man', 'crew', 'silently', 'living', 'couch.Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'sea', 'watch', 'human', 'worth', 'oasis', 'away', 'politics', 'trivial', 'city', 'stuff']",Deadliest Catch: Season 2
1089243,A641900QNPO4G,B000TEUSL8,"Business Teacher ""Mrs. H.""","[7, 9]","I was eagerly anticipating Season 2 of ""Deadliest Catch"" for more than one reason:  firstly, I feel as if I really know all these guys and wanted to see what new adventures they were having and, secondly, I use the show as an example of ""alternative careers"" for my students where I teach business courses at an inner-city high school in Rhode Island.  It is a true eye-opener for them as well as being entertaining!  (Ironically, last spring, after showing a few of Season 1's episodes, one of my students lost her dad who was swept overboard while lobster fishing off the RI coast - his body was never found.  It certainly reinforced how true ""Deadliest Catch"" really is.)I highly recommend the DVD for those who want to expand their knowledge and experiences while being entertained.
