1090076,A24PTVSZSM8968,B000TGUUFA,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","This is the story of a soldier who gets sent home on leave. While visiting the fiancee of a fellow soldier who died, he also looks up a girl from the same town who wrote a letter to soldiers that he happened to receive. He doesn't tell her about the letter. She is engaged to someone who doesn't seem right for her. Her family takes the soldier in after he saves the father from getting hit by a car and he agrees to help run the family business for a while. The two begin to have affection for each other and are obviously a much better match than the girl and her fiancee. There are a number of scenes in which there is chemistry between them and there are a number of likable characters in the movie. In the end though, it comes off as being a bit implausible. For example the soldier gets sent home on leave, which would normally be about two weeks but appears to end up spending at least a month away and never seems to on track to go back. One of the oddest aspects is that he is wearing the wrong rank on the cover photo for the DVD. Aside from some odd things like that, it turns out to be a fairly decent holiday love story. It perhaps had a bit more potential than was realized in the film, but it still turns out to be a nice story.",3,NIce but not terribly original.,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,1243,"['story', 'soldier', 'who', 'sent', 'home', 'leave', 'visiting', 'fiancee', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'who', 'died', 'also', 'up', 'girl', 'same', 'town', 'who', 'wrote', 'letter', 'soldiers', 'happened', 'receive', ""n't"", 'tell', 'letter', 'engaged', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'family', 'soldier', 'father', 'getting', 'hit', 'car', 'help', 'run', 'family', 'business', 'while', 'two', 'begin', 'have', 'affection', 'other', 'are', 'obviously', 'much', 'better', 'match', 'girl', 'fiancee', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'chemistry', 'are', 'number', 'likable', 'characters', 'movie', 'end', 'off', 'being', 'bit', 'implausible', 'example', 'soldier', 'sent', 'home', 'leave', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'end', 'up', 'spending', 'least', 'month', 'away', 'never', 'track', 'go', 'back', 'One', 'oddest', 'aspects', 'wearing', 'wrong', 'rank', 'cover', 'photo', 'DVD', 'Aside', 'odd', 'things', 'out', 'be', 'fairly', 'decent', 'holiday', 'love', 'story', 'perhaps', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'potential', 'was', 'realized', 'film', 'still', 'out', 'be', 'nice', 'story']",The Christmas Card

It is a very clean, ""feel-good"" movie.  I borrow my sister's copy of this movie all the time, and I anticipate purchasing my very own DVD in the near future.This film is very ""Christmasey"" and very spiritual.  The Spelman Family is a Christian family.  They are faithful, active members at their church in Nevada City. The scenery throughout the movie is beautiful!!! This movie exemplifies the importance of family-being a family and working together as a family.  There are occasional funny moments as well, with Faith Spelman's hilarious Uncle Richard!!  This movie also displays the importance of FAITH, which is the main character's name, and how genuine acts of kindness can be very rewarding in ways you least expect.However, I do think that the ending could have been lengthened a bit.

However, I was very disappointed to see the actual movie. First, problem for me is that many of the main actors could not , or were not allowed to, act. Ed Anser can act, but he is just too old here to deliver the lines without slurring a bit. John Newton is so restrained he hardly says much and seems to feel much less. His character is absolutely unbelievable - handsome military man with no family (and tragic family past) who has the manners and mannerisms of someone from the 1950s. What a dream!The entire production is choppy and obviously cheaply made. The time spent *at war* is short and obviously shot on a set. This is a ""hallmark move"" but it was utterly smaltzy. Small town, everyone goes to church, everyone is sweet and welcoming to total strangers. I can suspend my disbelief at a lot but this movie asked a lot.The story is basic, solder at war gets a Christmas card from a young pretty woman as part of her church program. After he is back in the US he looks her up and they fall in love. But the ""how"" part was left out. Just because a man works at the family logging company doesn't mean he and the girl will fall in love. Just because the entire town is rooting for them to get together, doesn't mean they have chemistry. Yet here out of no place people start kissing. The pretty girl does have a boyfriend but they could not have gone out of their way to cast a more unworthy adversary to the John Newton character.Very superficial movie, where people just do things because they are supposed to for script purposes but we never understand the character motivations or root for them.",1,Love Story by the Numbers.,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,1690,"['Wow', 'reading', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'movie', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'see', 'actual', 'movie', 'First', 'problem', 'many', 'main', 'actors', 'could', 'not', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'act', 'Ed', 'Anser', 'can', 'act', 'just', 'too', 'old', 'here', 'deliver', 'lines', 'slurring', 'bit', 'John', 'Newton', 'so', 'restrained', 'hardly', 'much', 'feel', 'much', 'less', 'character', 'absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'handsome', 'military', 'man', 'family', 'tragic', 'family', 'who', 'manners', 'mannerisms', 'someone', '1950s', 'What', 'dream', 'entire', 'production', 'choppy', 'obviously', 'cheaply', 'made', 'time', 'spent', '*at', 'war*', 'short', 'obviously', 'shot', 'set', 'hallmark', 'move', 'was', 'utterly', 'smaltzy', 'Small', 'town', 'everyone', 'church', 'everyone', 'sweet', 'welcoming', 'total', 'strangers', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'lot', 'movie', 'asked', 'lot.The', 'story', 'basic', 'solder', 'war', 'Christmas', 'card', 'young', 'pretty', 'woman', 'part', 'church', 'program', 'back', 'US', 'up', 'fall', 'love', 'how', 'part', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'Just', 'man', 'family', 'logging', 'company', ""n't"", 'mean', 'girl', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'Just', 'entire', 'town', 'rooting', 'get', 'together', ""n't"", 'mean', 'have', 'chemistry', 'here', 'place', 'people', 'start', 'kissing', 'pretty', 'girl', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'cast', 'more', 'unworthy', 'adversary', 'John', 'Newton', 'superficial', 'movie', 'where', 'people', 'just', 'do', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'script', 'purposes', 'never', 'understand', 'character', 'motivations', 'root']",The Christmas Card

He takes an indefinite leave from the military and goes to Nevada City.  From there, the story becomes a fascinating conglomeration of a love triangle story, a story about opening your heart to a new family, and a family comedy which feels a little like a situation comedy.  But the characters feel to me more real and less caricatured than in a sit com; the family dynamics feel so energetic and like a real family, not like people playing parts as a sit com inevitably becomes.  The two older gentlemen in the family, Luke (played by Ed Asner) and Uncle Richard (played by Peter Jason), are delightfully colorful and hilarious.Something I like stylistically about The Christmas Card is that it's sort of a message movie, but it doesn't feel like one, because it doesn't dwell for long periods on emotions and internal conflicts to the extent most message movies/faith-based movies do.  It stays focused on interesting incidents that happen during Cody's stay with this family, which operates a lumber mill/sawmill, but with a focus on the love triangle storyline.The mature approach which Cody and Faith have to falling in love with each other is admirable, and feels a lot more real than the typical Hollywood fare of instant love.  When I see advertisement images, I wonder why lovers in the photos often like to look like sluts and like they're unhappy and wanting more.  Why can't they be psychologically healthy guys and girls who enjoy each other's company like Faith and Cody?  The Christmas Card is filled with respect for the institution of the family, and shows a mature love relationship that involves personal dedication/sacrifice.  Not a single character feels like a caricature, which is another mark of quality in the movie.  The competitor of Cody for Faith's love isn't a nasty character, or the movie would lose credibility because we would think poorly of Faith's character judgment.  The way the movie works out the love triangle situation is quite skillful and felt true-to-life to me.I really enjoyed a 5-minute-or-so special feature where a husband and wife talk about how they fell in love through cards and emails while the husband-to-be was in Afghanistan.

1090137,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000TGUUFA,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","The plot is a little too good to be true, a variation on the standard romance formula, boy meets girl.  In this case the lovebird's initial `meeting' is through a Christmas card with an enclosed letter: to whom it may concern, season's greetings.  He basically falls in love with a piece of paper with a sentiment attached, while she doesn't know him from Adam.  As luck, or clumsy plotting would have it, he's in the military, back in the states delivering dog tags to a widow.  And.  Since he's almost in the neighborhood, he goes to the town where the Christmas card originated.  Through no fault of his own, he saves the life of the father of the card giver and ends up living with and working for her family.  (Not quite stalking but close enough to make things a bit queasy.)  Things also get a little complicated when he learns she's already engaged to a pinhead wine broker.  No problem, he insinuates himself between her and the pinhead (in a passive/aggressive maneuver), and presto, the obligatory happy ending.  Well, not for the pinhead.This is not the most original romance or Christmas movie ever made but it works for the most part thanks to a charming performance by Edward Asner (earning him an Emmy nomination), and the incomparable Lois Nettleton, as the family matriarch.  Some of the cast gives an able assist.  John Newton, as the soldier, is capable enough in the part, likable at any rate.  The same cannot be said of Alice Evans as the girl two guys feel is worth fighting over.  She is a bit generic/bland.

First of all, even though this is a made-for-TV movie (it still appears occasionally on the Hallmark Channel), the actors are great.  John Newton (Cody) and Alice Evans (Faith) are a very attractive couple.  Faith is blessed with two wonderful parents who love her (and eachother) dearly.  Ed Asner does a great job as Faith's father; he is genuine, humorous and sweet. Her mother is hospitable, fun, and encourages Faith to follow her heart.  Beyond that, the mountain scenery is great, and their home is so warm and inviting that it makes you want to be there. I read the other reviews and I agree that the scene where Faith accidentally falls on top of Cody may be unnecessarily suggestive for family viewing.  It might have been better, for example, if they had regained their balance and kissed while standing.  Another scene that may be challenging for young viewers is when an attack occurs while Cody is serving in Afghanistan.  Having said that, it is still refreshing to watch a movie that is quite innocent in comparison to the majority of other films out there today.  I don't remember there being any profanity in the film, and the storyline is sweet, goodhearted and redemptive.  I, personally, would highly recommend this as a family holiday movie.

A family brings a lonely soldier on leave from Afganistan into their home for the holidays and of course this leads to interest in the daughter! However there is a lot more going on here than meets the eye. The antagonist, the other boyfriend and the soldier must vie for the attentions of the girl, who is put on a pedestal as a perfect prize. This is how American society is set up, so that the male has to 'win' his place in family and be worthy of 'the girl', in her perfect makeup and blonded-out hair! The screenplay 'mentions' Viet Nam, perhaps the most horrible war in American history! Vietnam Veterans well remember 'coming home', being spit-on in the streets, accused of attrocities they did not commit, being attacked by cops and being denied jobs for thirty years. They remember being denied compensation for their wounds and medical maladies in denial by Congress, in hopes Vietnam Veterans would all die off before they qualified. Vietnam Veterans well remember how the Common American citizen, who did not have to go to war, treated them as criminals and lepers and 'baby killers' upon their return...no warm fire and loving family for them! All Vietnam combat soldiers remember their wives and girlfriends who betrayed them while they were in combat...nothing to come home to there!

I don't know if the record still stands, but when it first aired in 2006, it took in the highest ratings in the history of the Hallmark channel in terms of the made-for-TV original film. It's just hard to stay away from a wartime romance set during the holidays, especially if you've a servicemember in the family.U.S. Army Sergeant Cody Cullen (John Newton) has stood watch for a long while now, and after a harrowing time in Afghanistan, it's his turn to rotate home just in time for the holidays. Sgt. Cullen is an orphan and has no one to return to. Back stateside, tooling around on his motorcycle, he pulls up at snowy Nevada City, California. He means to pass thru but ends up lingering for weeks. There, he meets the Spelman family, and is it a twist that it's the old patriarch, rather than the lovely daughter, who takes an instant shine to our soldier on leave?In Nevada City the local church organizes Operation Christmas Card, a care program for which Faith Spelman (Alice Evans) patiently writes letters of encouragement to our troops abroad (""Dear Servicemember...""). Faith's gesture of good will is about to change her life forever.Tune in to this movie and place your hand on your chest and feel your heart swell up. There's a quiet strength to the narrative.Sometimes, I'm in the mood for snarky films. Sometimes, I hanker for stories wherein the characters exhibit kindness, respect, and courtesy toward each other. The Christmas Card doesn't have much in the way of cynicism and snark. It presents folks who work hard and are decent and who love each other in steadfast ways. The Spelmans take in Sgt. Cullen, provide him with room and board, teach him to know his way around the family business, this lumber mill. Ed Asner raked in the 2007 Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor (in a Miniseries or Movie), and, as the gruff Luke Spelman, he serves as the impetus to the plot. You can catch him in a matchmaking temperament.Good thing, too, as Faith and the sergeant, all they do is cautiously circle each other. Helping to gum up the works is Faith's smug boyfriend, Paul (Ben Weber), him what's an international wine broker. And maybe if the film has a false note, it's that it portrays this guy as so obviously not right for Faith. Paul looks like a punier version of Simon Garfunkel, which doesn't help his cause.I basked in the cozy, small-town Christmas atmosphere. Shot on location, snow-laden Nevada City and its outskirts are something to look at. I marveled at the Spelmans' roomy log house, the cheer and glow of it. I savored the performances. You never catch the actors trying too hard. I could say that John Newton's performance was too restrained, that he could've demonstrated more spark. But the truth is that there's enough spark in him, especially when he's sharing screen time with Alice Evans. And Alice Evans... she's someone I could watch all day. She's beautiful in this unaffected manner. She seems real, like a person who would actually take the time to write to strangers she's never met. And for Sgt. Cullen, recipient of one of her letters, those words of concern became his lifeline during a terrible tour of duty. Writing to our lonely boys overseas isn't a new tradition. It's been done for years and years. It's even the linchpin in the plot of one of my favorite movies ever, Dear Ruth (1947). All the elements are present to make The Christmas Card a modern-day holiday classic. My list of must-see films during the Yuletide season keeps on growing. But there'll always be room for The Christmas Card.",4,"sort of like The Lucky One on the small screen, with a bench added in",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3669,"['fancy', 'bells', 'whistles', 'Christmas', 'Card', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'heartfelt', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'record', 'still', 'when', 'first', 'aired', '2006', 'took', 'highest', 'ratings', 'history', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'terms', 'made-for-TV', 'original', 'film', 'just', 'hard', 'stay', 'away', 'wartime', 'romance', 'set', 'holidays', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'servicemember', 'family.U.S', 'Army', 'Sergeant', 'Cody', 'Cullen', 'John', 'Newton', 'stood', 'watch', 'long', 'while', 'now', 'harrowing', 'time', 'Afghanistan', 'turn', 'rotate', 'home', 'just', 'time', 'holidays', 'Sgt', 'Cullen', 'orphan', 'one', 'return', 'Back', 'stateside', 'tooling', 'around', 'motorcycle', 'up', 'snowy', 'Nevada', 'City', 'California', 'pass', 'thru', 'up', 'lingering', 'weeks', 'Spelman', 'family', 'twist', 'old', 'patriarch', 'rather', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'who', 'instant', 'shine', 'soldier', 'leave', 'Nevada', 'City', 'local', 'church', 'Operation', 'Christmas', 'Card', 'care', 'program', 'Faith', 'Spelman', 'Alice', 'Evans', 'patiently', 'letters', 'encouragement', 'troops', 'abroad', 'Dear', 'Servicemember', 'Faith', 'gesture', 'good', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever.Tune', 'movie', 'place', 'hand', 'chest', 'feel', 'heart', 'swell', 'up', 'quiet', 'strength', 'narrative.Sometimes', ""'m"", 'mood', 'snarky', 'films', 'Sometimes', 'hanker', 'stories', 'wherein', 'characters', 'exhibit', 'kindness', 'respect', 'courtesy', 'other', 'Christmas', 'Card', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'way', 'cynicism', 'snark', 'folks', 'who', 'work', 'hard', 'are', 'decent', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'steadfast', 'ways', 'Spelmans', 'take', 'Sgt', 'Cullen', 'provide', 'room', 'board', 'teach', 'know', 'way', 'family', 'business', 'lumber', 'mill', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'raked', '2007', 'Emmy', 'Nomination', 'Outstanding', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Miniseries', 'Movie', 'gruff', 'Luke', 'Spelman', 'impetus', 'plot', 'can', 'catch', 'matchmaking', 'temperament.Good', 'thing', 'too', 'Faith', 'sergeant', 'do', 'cautiously', 'circle', 'other', 'Helping', 'gum', 'up', 'works', 'Faith', 'smug', 'boyfriend', 'Paul', 'Ben', 'Weber', 'what', 'international', 'wine', 'broker', 'maybe', 'film', 'false', 'note', 'guy', 'so', 'obviously', 'not', 'right', 'Faith', 'Paul', 'punier', 'version', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', ""n't"", 'help', 'cause.I', 'basked', 'cozy', 'small-town', 'Christmas', 'atmosphere', 'Shot', 'location', 'snow-laden', 'Nevada', 'City', 'outskirts', 'are', 'something', 'look', 'marveled', 'Spelmans', 'roomy', 'log', 'house', 'cheer', 'glow', 'savored', 'performances', 'never', 'catch', 'actors', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'could', 'say', 'John', 'Newton', 'performance', 'was', 'too', 'restrained', 'could', ""'ve"", 'demonstrated', 'more', 'spark', 'truth', 'enough', 'spark', 'especially', 'when', 'sharing', 'screen', 'time', 'Alice', 'Evans', 'Alice', 'Evans', 'someone', 'could', 'watch', 'day', 'beautiful', 'unaffected', 'manner', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'actually', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'strangers', 'never', 'met', 'Sgt', 'Cullen', 'recipient', 'one', 'letters', 'words', 'concern', 'became', 'lifeline', 'terrible', 'tour', 'duty', 'Writing', 'lonely', 'boys', 'overseas', ""n't"", 'new', 'tradition', 'been', 'done', 'years', 'years', 'even', 'linchpin', 'plot', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'ever', 'Dear', 'Ruth', '1947', 'elements', 'are', 'present', 'make', 'Christmas', 'Card', 'modern-day', 'holiday', 'classic', 'list', 'must-see', 'films', 'Yuletide', 'season', 'keeps', 'growing', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'room', 'Christmas', 'Card']",The Christmas Card

Even if you're not part of a military family, this show will hit home.  Casting, scenery, pacing are all top notch.  And the happy ending is worth waiting for.The main story takes place in current-day northern California where the Spelman family runs a local lumber business.  Edward Asner plays the family patriarch and is just great in the part.  The late Lois Nettleton is touching as Mrs. Spelman.  Their daughter, Faith, is really the story's central character, played convincingly by Alice Evans. It's Faith's Christmas card sent to troops overseas that draws our hero from Afganistan to Nevada City, CA.  Our hero is Sgt. Cody Cullen, played perfectly by John Newton II.Faith already has a boyfried, Paul, whom we quickly learn to dislike.  Among other things, Paul drives a black Porsche and is an international wine broker and wine snob.  After several years of absentee courtship, Paul hopes to win Faith and join him in globe trotting the world's vineyards.  Faith would rather stay with her family in Nevada City and work at the lumber mill.Enter Sgt. Cody Cullen during the holiday season and the love triangle is complete.  Sgt. Cullen quickly falls for Faith but she feels obligated to Paul.  Then Paul proposes and Faith accepts, but later has second thoughts.  Various twists and turns ensue. Unintentionally, Faith ends up in the arms of Sgt. Cullen.  She feels guilty about this and so confides in her mother.  She tells Faith to follow her heart and we're left wondering what will happen.  In the end, Faith reads a departure note of thanks sent by Sgt. Cullen to the Spelman family.  Faith then realizes she can't live without him and tracks him down.If you only see one Christmas movie next holiday season, we suggest you see this one.  It's sweet without being sappy; romantic and inspirational without overkill.  And if you don't end up cheering at the end, you probably drive a Porsche.",5,Best of the Best,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,2042,"['pretty', 'easy', 'review', 'do', 'Christmas', 'Card', 'simply', 'best', 'holiday', 'movie', 'wife', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'part', 'military', 'family', 'show', 'will', 'hit', 'home', 'Casting', 'scenery', 'pacing', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'happy', 'ending', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.The', 'main', 'story', 'place', 'current-day', 'northern', 'California', 'where', 'Spelman', 'family', 'local', 'lumber', 'business', 'Edward', 'Asner', 'family', 'patriarch', 'just', 'great', 'part', 'late', 'Lois', 'Nettleton', 'touching', 'Mrs.', 'Spelman', 'daughter', 'Faith', 'really', 'story', 'central', 'character', 'played', 'convincingly', 'Alice', 'Evans', 'Faith', 'Christmas', 'card', 'sent', 'troops', 'overseas', 'hero', 'Afganistan', 'Nevada', 'City', 'CA', 'hero', 'Sgt', 'Cody', 'Cullen', 'played', 'perfectly', 'John', 'Newton', 'II.Faith', 'already', 'boyfried', 'Paul', 'whom', 'quickly', 'learn', 'dislike', 'other', 'things', 'Paul', 'black', 'Porsche', 'international', 'wine', 'broker', 'wine', 'snob', 'several', 'years', 'absentee', 'courtship', 'Paul', 'win', 'Faith', 'join', 'globe', 'trotting', 'world', 'vineyards', 'Faith', 'would', 'rather', 'stay', 'family', 'Nevada', 'City', 'work', 'lumber', 'mill.Enter', 'Sgt', 'Cody', 'Cullen', 'holiday', 'season', 'love', 'triangle', 'complete', 'Sgt', 'Cullen', 'quickly', 'Faith', 'obligated', 'Paul', 'Then', 'Paul', 'proposes', 'Faith', 'accepts', 'later', 'second', 'thoughts', 'Various', 'twists', 'ensue', 'Unintentionally', 'Faith', 'up', 'arms', 'Sgt', 'Cullen', 'guilty', 'so', 'confides', 'mother', 'Faith', 'follow', 'heart', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'end', 'Faith', 'departure', 'note', 'thanks', 'sent', 'Sgt', 'Cullen', 'Spelman', 'family', 'Faith', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'down.If', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'next', 'holiday', 'season', 'suggest', 'see', 'one', 'sweet', 'being', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'inspirational', 'overkill', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'cheering', 'end', 'probably', 'drive', 'Porsche']",The Christmas Card

Beautiful scenery (I'd like to go to Nevada City someday).  Good casting.

Alice Evans is young and fresh -- the girl next door and the young Sargent Cody Cullen is handsome (the strong, silent type)  Most importantly, I want to believe that there are people out there who know how to love, how to be generous and kind and how to make Christmas what it SHOULD be.  As an ""Army Brat"", I am very thankful that this movie is not ""bashing"" our military (I'm sick of that!).

Along with the setting and superb acting, the movie also delivers a wonderful, warm-hearted and believable story with a well balance of drama and humor to bring what could very well be a holiday classic! This is my facorite Christmas movie and one of my most favorite of all movies.  A soldier gets a Christmas Card through a fellow soldier friend from a lady at the soldier's Nevada City church, and it begins a whole new direction in his life when his buddy suddenly gets killed and he gets leave to go back to the states for the holidays.  His loyalty to his fellow soldier takes him to Nevada City to comfort this friend's fiancee and decides to spend the night there and attend church services where the card originated and by a series of events gets invited to spend the holidays with the family of the lady that wrote the card and work at their lumber mill.  The lady, Faith, doesn't realize that Cody, the soldier, received her card until after he leaves.  Another thing that I liked about this movie is the writer's intent to provide clues to the viewer of the location of the setting of this movie without actually providing the name of the state where Nevada City is, allowing a certain bit of mystic to elevate the movie into a magical fairyland feeling.  Although I have not been to this part of California, it is a place that I now intend to visit in the future.  The bridge, which is mentioned in the movie as being on highway 49, looking on Google Earth, is the new bridge scanning the Yuba river (next to the old bridge) about 5 miles north-west of Nevada City and you can see the spot where the last scene was shot.  Incidently, another reason to visit there, although not in the movie, is that just west of that bridge about another five miles is the world's longest single span covered bridge in the world.",5,Best Christmas Movie!!,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,1976,"['One', 'secrets', 'making', 'great', 'holiday', 'movie', 'setting', 'one', 'advantage', 'one', 'more', 'beautiful', 'spots', 'northwest', 'setting', 'superb', 'acting', 'movie', 'also', 'wonderful', 'warm-hearted', 'believable', 'story', 'well', 'balance', 'drama', 'humor', 'bring', 'what', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'holiday', 'classic', 'facorite', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'favorite', 'movies', 'soldier', 'Christmas', 'Card', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'friend', 'lady', 'soldier', 'Nevada', 'City', 'church', 'whole', 'new', 'direction', 'life', 'when', 'buddy', 'suddenly', 'killed', 'leave', 'go', 'back', 'states', 'holidays', 'loyalty', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'Nevada', 'City', 'comfort', 'friend', 'fiancee', 'spend', 'night', 'there', 'attend', 'church', 'services', 'where', 'card', 'originated', 'series', 'events', 'invited', 'spend', 'holidays', 'family', 'lady', 'wrote', 'card', 'work', 'lumber', 'mill', 'lady', 'Faith', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Cody', 'soldier', 'received', 'card', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'writer', 'intent', 'provide', 'clues', 'viewer', 'location', 'setting', 'movie', 'actually', 'providing', 'name', 'state', 'where', 'Nevada', 'City', 'allowing', 'certain', 'bit', 'mystic', 'elevate', 'movie', 'magical', 'fairyland', 'feeling', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'part', 'California', 'place', 'now', 'intend', 'visit', 'future', 'bridge', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'being', 'highway', '49', 'looking', 'Google', 'Earth', 'new', 'bridge', 'scanning', 'Yuba', 'river', 'next', 'old', 'bridge', '5', 'miles', 'north-west', 'Nevada', 'City', 'can', 'see', 'spot', 'where', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'shot', 'Incidently', 'reason', 'visit', 'there', 'not', 'movie', 'just', 'west', 'bridge', 'five', 'miles', 'world', 'longest', 'single', 'span', 'covered', 'bridge', 'world']",The Christmas Card

Her parents take him in for the holiday season and give him a job at their lumber mill in exchange for the room and board he is enjoying.

Other than a brief attack scene set in Afghanistan, the movie is blood free as well.  What this movie DOES have is a strong, loving, caring central family, characters reaching out to people in need, respect for those serving in the military, respect from those serving in the military, characters that go to church, humor, romance, and a sweetness you don't find in Hollywood's mainstream fare.  It makes me wish I had Satellite TV so that I could get the Hallmark Channel.  I didn't rate it a 5 because some of the acting was less that stellar and, though the characters went to church, it was odd that there were no children in church, just older people and the young couple the movie centers around.  I thought the lack of children was odd and it sort of sends a bad message that church is not for the younger generation, only for old folks.

He is touched by the card and keeps it close.  When a fellow soldier is killed in an attack, he returns to the States to notify and comfort the widow.  While there, he also searches for and meets Faith, but never tells her how he knows her.  Through a series of events he becomes like a member of Faith's family.  When his time is up, he leaves the Christmas Card with a special gift for Faith's family and disappears without saying goodbye.
