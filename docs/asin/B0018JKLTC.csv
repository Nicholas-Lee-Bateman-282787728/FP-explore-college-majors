Those Chen Kuan Tai inspirational speeches are awesome in this film and coming from Chen Kuan Tai, you know it!  My favorite from him is the last one he delivers to Gordon Liu, "" Hung Fei, not only are you skilled at kung fu you have the right humility.  This virtue is much more important than kung fu excellence.  When you've beaten your opponent, you've only beaten him in a physical match, but if you can win that man's heart... well then.  That is the way real kung fu should be, forgive men and forbear! Hung Fei, never forget your humility and kindness.  Awesome english dubbs.

1160232,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B0018JKLTC,Mantis,"[1, 1]","This is one of the best films by Shaw Brothers director Lau Kar Leung (""Executioners From Shaolin""), yet the lack of fights may deter some fans of kung fu flicks.  That is often a criticism of mine on many films too.  Well... not this time.  The characters, story, and overall theme pulled me right in.  I'll admit that it would've been nice to see more fisticuffs, but this is easily good enough to recommend without the constant brawling.Another chapter in the story of real-life Chinese hero Wong Fei Hung, the subject of many unrelated films by the director, whose own father was taught by a student of Fei Hung's.  This is the first time actor Gordon Liu would portray him, but not the last.  Here, Fei Hung is a mischievous boy, who wants to learn to fight from his father, Master Wong Kay Ying (Kong Yeung).  Master Wong feels that Fei Hung lacks the right temperament to seriously study kung fu.  When he messes up a competition for his father's school, he is sent to learn Hung Gar Kuen from his father's master, Lu Ah Tsai (Chen Kuan Tai, ""Crippled Avengers"", ""The Master"").  Soon after his training begins, Fei Hung learns that his friend (Lau Kar Wing, ""Knockabout"") was murdered trying to apprehend a criminal, played by the film's director.  Master Lu talks him out of going to find his revenge, and into staying, to train.It should certainly be mentioned that though there are only a couple of fights in this film, they are excellent.  Especially when you consider when this was made.  Fairly fast and full of form.  All alliteration aside, I think this movie is quite an accomplishment.  Other than ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"", this may be Lau Kar Leung's best film.  It should be shown to all students of the martial arts, as a positive example of why fighting should only be used as a last resort, and how compassion can change an enemy's agenda.  EXAMPLE:  As a kid, during an unsupervised basketball game, I assaulted someone who could've ripped me to pieces.  Instead, he restrained me just long enough to let me know that I was being irrational, and that all would be forgiven if I calmed down.  It took me a second to come to my senses, but the problem was resolved, just like that.  He had every right to smash my face in.  I was embarrassed, but he saved me from an even worse humiliation, and a lot of pain.  Not to mention teaching me a valuable lesson I would carry with me for the rest of my life.  Though I rarely see him, we are still friends.I only wish I had this DVD from Media Blasters.  I have a remastered copy from Red Sun, with fantastic picture quality that lives up to the usual job from Celestial.  What you'll get if you purchase the Media Blasters version is that same great remastered picture, plus interviews with Chen Kuan Tai (who I should mention is terrific, like always), and several language options.  I wouldn't have purchased the bootleg, except that I found it used for $4.  Who can pass that up?

1160233,A22OOMNBTEEVL1,B0018JKLTC,"Michael W. Jaworski ""jawsomatic""","[6, 6]","Definitely deserves five stars. Liu Chia-Liang (Lau Kar-Leung)'s second directorial feature is amazing, it's also one of the few films where all three Liu brothers are in it. I would probably rank this as my third favorite Liu Chia-Liang film; right below my all-time fave ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" & ""Heroes of the East.""  Great fu (the weapons used in the film were real) especially the fights between the Liu brothers, and a bunch of cameos. Tokyo Shock did a fabulous job restoring this gem; remastered, widescreen, well done subtitles and your choice of audio (Mandarin, Cantonese & English). The interview with Chen Kuan-Tai was awesome & informative. Although the whole movie is great; for me, the meat of the movie is the teacher/student relationship between Chen Kuan-Tai & Gordon Liu. I've seen plenty of martial arts pictures (just check out my reviews), but I've never seen that teacher/student aspect done with more emotion and heartfelt sincerity; ""More forgiveness, less aggression.""

1160234,APIW11UEPKIC2,B0018JKLTC,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[10, 11]","I have heard a lot of different opinions on this movie over the years, and the people who don't like it seem to not like it because they think the movie is slow.  It is a bit slow I suppose, but to tell a story you can't just have nonstop fighting, right?  The story in this movie is very well done.  A killer is in town (played by the director Lau Kar Leung), and an officer (played by his real life blood brother Lau Kar Wing) has shown up to arrest him.  They have an amazing fight scene and Lau Kar Leung kills him.  Gordon Liu plays the legendary Wong Fei Hung, and had become friends with Lau Kar Wing's character.  He wants to catch the killer, but he has only started to learn kung fu (from a teacher played by Chen Kuan Tai).  Chen Kuan Tai's character is where the line in the title of my review comes from (in the English dubbed version that is, and I had to shorten the quote so it could fit into the limited space given for the title).  He also teaches Wong Fei Hung that ""kung fu cannot be learned in just a few years.  After 2 years, people start to believe they're not bad.  But then, after some 20 years, you realize that you are not so good.  But still, if you are not feeling satisfied, that means you are on the right track"".  It's those types of speeches that sucked me into this movie and kept my eyes glued to the screen the entire runing time (I actually just got the movie yesterday, and I've already watched it 3 times!).  So Wong Fei Hung ends up becoming a kung fu master and he fights the killer, and helps his school gain back the respect that they had lost in some kind of a fun looking game where everybody beats eachother up.There are a ton of other recognizable actors on hand, such as Wong Yu, Fung Hak-on, Eric Tsang, Wilson Tong, John Chang, Shut Chung Tin, Ricky Hui, Lily Li-Li-Li, Peter Chan Lung, Chien Yuet Sang and Kong Do.There are a couple of very touching moments towards the end of the movie, and that is what helps to make it a real kung fu classic, and a movie that I highly enjoyed and will surely be watching again and again.  If it had maybe one more great fight scene, it would easily get a 5 star rating.  But as Chen Kuan Tai's character would say, a rating of 4.5/5 isn't all that bad.Picture and sound quality are awesome.  Cantonese and Mandarin tracks included, and what I prefer, the original English dub.Special features include the original English and Chinese trailers, and 2 interviews with Chen Kuan Tai.  Very enjoyable interviews.And on a side note, is Chen Kuan Tai going to star in every Media Blasters Shaw release?  Because it's fine with me.",4,"""You can fight and beat your opponent, but if you can show him kindness, then that man may surrender his heart to you.""",1217980800,"08 6, 2008",2008,2613,"['have', 'heard', 'lot', 'different', 'opinions', 'movie', 'years', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seem', 'not', 'like', 'think', 'movie', 'slow', 'bit', 'slow', 'suppose', 'tell', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'have', 'nonstop', 'fighting', 'right', 'story', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'killer', 'town', 'played', 'director', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Leung', 'officer', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'blood', 'brother', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Wing', 'shown', 'up', 'arrest', 'have', 'amazing', 'fight', 'scene', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Leung', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'legendary', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'had', 'become', 'friends', 'Lau', 'Kar', 'Wing', 'character', 'catch', 'killer', 'only', 'started', 'learn', 'kung', 'fu', 'teacher', 'played', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'character', 'where', 'line', 'title', 'review', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'had', 'shorten', 'quote', 'could', 'fit', 'limited', 'space', 'given', 'title', 'also', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'kung', 'fu', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'learned', 'just', 'few', 'years', '2', 'years', 'people', 'start', 'believe', ""'re"", 'not', 'bad', 'then', '20', 'years', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'still', 'are', 'not', 'feeling', 'satisfied', 'are', 'right', 'track', 'types', 'speeches', 'sucked', 'movie', 'kept', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'runing', 'time', 'actually', 'just', 'got', 'movie', 'yesterday', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', '3', 'times', 'So', 'Wong', 'Fei', 'Hung', 'up', 'becoming', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'killer', 'school', 'gain', 'back', 'respect', 'had', 'lost', 'kind', 'fun', 'looking', 'game', 'where', 'everybody', 'eachother', 'up.There', 'are', 'ton', 'other', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'hand', 'such', 'Wong', 'Yu', 'Fung', 'Hak-on', 'Eric', 'Tsang', 'Wilson', 'Tong', 'John', 'Chang', 'Shut', 'Chung', 'Tin', 'Ricky', 'Hui', 'Lily', 'Li-Li-Li', 'Peter', 'Chan', 'Lung', 'Chien', 'Yuet', 'Sang', 'Kong', 'Do.There', 'are', 'couple', 'very', 'touching', 'moments', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'make', 'real', 'kung', 'fu', 'classic', 'movie', 'highly', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'had', 'maybe', 'one', 'more', 'great', 'fight', 'scene', 'would', 'easily', 'get', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'character', 'would', 'say', 'rating', '4.5/5', ""n't"", 'bad.Picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'awesome', 'Cantonese', 'Mandarin', 'tracks', 'included', 'what', 'prefer', 'original', 'English', 'dub.Special', 'features', 'include', 'original', 'English', 'Chinese', 'trailers', '2', 'interviews', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'interviews.And', 'side', 'note', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'going', 'star', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'Shaw', 'release', 'fine']",Challenge of The Masters
