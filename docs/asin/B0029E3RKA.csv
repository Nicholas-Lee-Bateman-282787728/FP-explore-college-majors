1256752,A3GBS13EUHBDAR,B0029E3RKA,"B. Poole ""bradiane777""","[2, 2]","Why are there so many wonderful movies that are not release in USA format?  I didn't know it was going to be on or I would have recorded it from my TV.  I rushed in to order it because my family really needed this to send to my son but now that I find it isn't in USA format there is no reason to order it.This movie made me cry but in a good way. It is a wonderful family movie and every family who has ever had a problem (are there any who haven't?)really need to watch this.  This movie shows that love doesn't have to end and there are so many times that there is always a reason for hope.Someone, please release this in USA format.I called the maker of my DVD player and they said that all DVD's (region's didn't matter) would play on their product.  They assured me it would. I ordered a DVD and it wouldn't play. So much for customer service at that company. I did some research and found their were codes to use to get it to play but they didn't work either.  The really good news is that I found the movie I bought will play on my computer and on my portable DVD player.  Has anyone tried this with this movie?  I don't want to spend this much money if it won't. Still, the problem is that I need to send it to my son and he won't be able to play it.
