1161538,A1UP8GH55PM663,B00195FUEG,"Anders Martinson ""biketowork""","[2, 2]","The curious movie goer should always be willing to engage with a story that hasn't been told or one that's told in a new way. This is where Turn the River gets off to a good start. The lead and supporting performances are all good and bring some humanity to some otherwise unsympathetic characters. The problem is that setup has dug such a deep moral hole for Kailey that you can't really cheer for her especially as she embarks upon a strategically, legally, and ethically dubious endeavor.Of course we want a good outcome for her son Gulley, but the path the film sets out for them will make that outcome either unbelievable or worse than what he's already facing. The title cleverly combines Kailey's gambling with the challenges we faces once fate and our decisions have set us on a particular path. The story, however, forces Gulley to accept the lesser of two evils without giving him any say in his destiny.Gulley's parents and grandmother are all ill-equipped to give him a happy, loving home, and since he's only a spectator in their misdeeds, there's a sort of helpless feeling for him that the story has no way of resolving. Worth seeing for the performances and the (albeit flawed) originality, and definitely the pool shots, just don't set your expectations too high.",3,A respectable but flawed effort,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,1280,"['curious', 'movie', 'goer', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'willing', 'engage', 'story', ""n't"", 'been', 'told', 'one', 'told', 'new', 'way', 'where', 'Turn', 'River', 'off', 'good', 'start', 'lead', 'supporting', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'bring', 'humanity', 'otherwise', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'problem', 'setup', 'dug', 'deep', 'moral', 'hole', 'Kailey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'cheer', 'especially', 'strategically', 'legally', 'ethically', 'dubious', 'endeavor.Of', 'course', 'want', 'good', 'outcome', 'son', 'Gulley', 'path', 'film', 'out', 'will', 'make', 'outcome', 'unbelievable', 'worse', 'what', 'already', 'facing', 'title', 'cleverly', 'combines', 'Kailey', 'gambling', 'challenges', 'once', 'fate', 'decisions', 'have', 'set', 'particular', 'path', 'story', 'however', 'forces', 'Gulley', 'accept', 'lesser', 'two', 'evils', 'giving', 'say', 'destiny.Gulley', 'parents', 'grandmother', 'are', 'ill-equipped', 'give', 'happy', 'loving', 'home', 'only', 'spectator', 'misdeeds', 'sort', 'helpless', 'feeling', 'story', 'way', 'resolving', 'Worth', 'seeing', 'performances', 'flawed', 'originality', 'definitely', 'pool', 'shots', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high']",Turn the River
1161539,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00195FUEG,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I'm so happy I could cry.Finally, a performance that is worthy to carry the name of Famke Janssen.  I have been a huge fan of this girl since I first saw her in `Goldeneye' and then in the `X-Men' films.  She just had this chemistry with the camera, this infectious hold over the audience.  Sure, the movies were nothing extraordinary (although `X2: United' is a spectacular `super hero' movie) but she always brought a spark that I just fell in love with.  Then I saw her on the FX series `Nip/Tuck' and I was blown away.  Her development of character was stunning from beginning to end.  I found myself wondering why she couldn't find a character like that to play on the big screen.Kailey Sullivan is nothing like her feisty turn as Ava Moore, but this is finally the big screen performance that matches her talent.Kailey is a pool shark struggling to connect with her son, Gulley.  She has no visitation rights and has to sneak around to see him, but the bond is there and her heart breaks for every moment she can steal away with him.  Kailey decides that she wants to be with her son, permanently, and so she devises a plan to hustle enough money (playing billiards) to run away with him, leave the country.The film has a very nice flow to it, which I didn't expect.  The pool scenes are very well shot and interesting, something else I didn't expect.  I just watched `The Hustler' a few nights back and reviewed it a few days ago, mentioning that the pool scenes were shot poorly and were boorish.  That is surprisingly not the case here.  A lot of that has to do with the fact that Famke Janssen is so engaging that even when she is staring down her cue-stick at a group of seemingly harmless pool balls we can feel the intensity of the moment.  Her grasp of character is flawless, seriously.The film is not perfect, and its main imperfection comes at the very end.  Many reviewers have griped about this very point, and I'm going to gripe again.  The film is short (a little over 90 minutes) and it builds itself up quite well throughout the first three quarters of the film, but the last fifteen minutes or so fall to pieces.  The film spirals down rapidly, as if it had built up all this tension for nothing, and then just ends.I hate to say it, but I hate the ending.That said, Famke Janssen makes up for it, and then some.  She embodies Kailey with this marvelous naturalism, this uneasy confidence that comes with parenthood.  You can read the worry, the pain, the struggle all over her face, but you can also see the excitement when her son is around and the happiness he brings her.  She gives such a real and mature performance.  I'm ashamed that the `Independent Spirit Award' body didn't nominate her for this riveting and mesmerizing performance.  I just hope that Famke can catch a few more breaks like this one; then maybe one day she'll be an Oscar contender.Then I'll really be crying.",4,"A startling performance can go a long, long way...",1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,2909,"[""'m"", 'so', 'happy', 'could', 'cry.Finally', 'performance', 'worthy', 'carry', 'name', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'girl', 'first', 'saw', 'Goldeneye', 'then', 'X-Men', 'films', 'just', 'had', 'chemistry', 'camera', 'infectious', 'hold', 'audience', 'Sure', 'movies', 'were', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'X2', 'United', 'spectacular', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'always', 'brought', 'spark', 'just', 'fell', 'love', 'Then', 'saw', 'FX', 'series', 'Nip/Tuck', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'development', 'character', 'was', 'stunning', 'beginning', 'end', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'character', 'play', 'big', 'screen.Kailey', 'Sullivan', 'nothing', 'feisty', 'turn', 'Ava', 'Moore', 'finally', 'big', 'screen', 'performance', 'talent.Kailey', 'pool', 'shark', 'struggling', 'connect', 'son', 'Gulley', 'visitation', 'rights', 'sneak', 'see', 'bond', 'there', 'heart', 'breaks', 'moment', 'can', 'steal', 'away', 'Kailey', 'be', 'son', 'permanently', 'so', 'plan', 'hustle', 'enough', 'money', 'playing', 'billiards', 'run', 'away', 'leave', 'country.The', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'flow', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'pool', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'shot', 'interesting', 'something', 'else', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'just', 'watched', 'Hustler', 'few', 'nights', 'back', 'reviewed', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'mentioning', 'pool', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'poorly', 'were', 'boorish', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'lot', 'do', 'fact', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'so', 'engaging', 'even', 'when', 'staring', 'down', 'cue-stick', 'group', 'seemingly', 'harmless', 'pool', 'can', 'feel', 'intensity', 'moment', 'grasp', 'character', 'flawless', 'seriously.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'main', 'imperfection', 'very', 'end', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'griped', 'very', 'point', ""'m"", 'going', 'gripe', 'again', 'film', 'short', 'little', '90', 'minutes', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'film', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'fall', 'pieces', 'film', 'spirals', 'down', 'rapidly', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'tension', 'nothing', 'then', 'just', 'ends.I', 'hate', 'say', 'hate', 'ending.That', 'said', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'up', 'then', 'Kailey', 'marvelous', 'naturalism', 'uneasy', 'confidence', 'parenthood', 'can', 'read', 'worry', 'pain', 'struggle', 'face', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'excitement', 'when', 'son', 'around', 'happiness', 'real', 'mature', 'performance', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'Independent', 'Spirit', 'Award', 'body', 'did', ""n't"", 'nominate', 'riveting', 'mesmerizing', 'performance', 'just', 'hope', 'Famke', 'can', 'catch', 'few', 'more', 'breaks', 'one', 'then', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Oscar', 'contender.Then', ""'ll"", 'really', 'be', 'crying']",Turn the River

Those expressive, wide open eyes, long black hair and drop dead gorgeous face staring at me as she stretched across the pool table. Needless to say that was more than enough encouragement to convince me that this would be a worthy rental.Synopsis: The film I'm talking about is the '07 release `Turn the River', a tale of one wronged woman's struggle to reclaim her son from his abusive Father. In desperation she devises a plan to raise the needed cash via her impressive talent from playing cards and pool and escape with him across the U.S./Canadian border.Critique: Famke is excellent in this film and displays more range and versatility than I had previously given her credit for, although in keeping with the role her natural beauty is never utilized. The cinematography was also a little too dark, many sequences taking place in a dimly lit pool hall, at night, or in a semi-light room. It was just a little too drab for my tastes. The ending was also a little too abrupt and disappointing. There's definitely no happy ending in this one.Worth a watch, especially if you're a Famke Janssen fan.",3,"""Is She Right?""~ Hustling, Motherhood And A Desperate Act Of Love",1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,1231,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'spotting', 'DVD', 'cover', 'local', 'video', 'rental', 'establishment', 'was', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'expressive', 'wide', 'open', 'eyes', 'long', 'black', 'hair', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'face', 'staring', 'stretched', 'pool', 'table', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'encouragement', 'convince', 'would', 'be', 'worthy', 'rental.Synopsis', 'film', ""'m"", 'talking', ""'07"", 'release', 'Turn', 'River', 'tale', 'one', 'wronged', 'woman', 'struggle', 'reclaim', 'son', 'abusive', 'Father', 'desperation', 'plan', 'raise', 'needed', 'cash', 'impressive', 'talent', 'playing', 'cards', 'pool', 'escape', 'U.S./Canadian', 'border.Critique', 'Famke', 'excellent', 'film', 'displays', 'more', 'range', 'versatility', 'had', 'previously', 'given', 'credit', 'keeping', 'role', 'natural', 'beauty', 'never', 'utilized', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'too', 'dark', 'many', 'sequences', 'taking', 'place', 'dimly', 'lit', 'pool', 'hall', 'night', 'semi-light', 'room', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'drab', 'tastes', 'ending', 'was', 'also', 'little', 'too', 'abrupt', 'disappointing', 'definitely', 'happy', 'ending', 'one.Worth', 'watch', 'especially', ""'re"", 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'fan']",Turn the River
1161542,A3AEF59DUCKMQC,B00195FUEG,"E. Laway ""Lady E""","[1, 3]","I probably have the same complaints as everyone who have seen this movie.  The storyline is choppy and not well developed.  The Janssen character seem strong willed and streetwise, so what was she doing with a dork like the father of her son and does she actually have a regular job? You can watch this movie from a Pool players angle but if that's the case, ESP coverage of Billiard Tournament is pretty exciting specially with Janette Lee and Villareal.  The pool games didn't create enough tension or suspense for me.  Jaymie Dornan who plays the son is a great character actor in the making and how interesting that casting actually picked a kid who resembles Janssen, which must have been difficult with her long pretty, angular features. This movie is gonna be Janssen's ticket to getting more dramatic roles that requires skills and the ability to convey complex emotions without saying too much which is what she acomplished in this movie.  Despite the Sequoia Tree stature, the sexy dark eyes and symetrical model face, Janssen is a very tense and a capable actor, that's why  I wouldn't totally chuck this movie because of some awkwardness in the developement of the storyline.  First time director, Chris Eigman is instinctual and impressive another reason why I reccommend this movie.  The DVD extras are nice too, there's a single shot of Janssen banking a ball as in ""turning the river"" she did it in one shot-wow! there's also a commentary with director and actress- which begs me to asked, why did Famke wear a hair piece/wig for the movie??",4,Falls short but Janssen gets the four stars,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,1557,"['probably', 'have', 'same', 'complaints', 'everyone', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'storyline', 'choppy', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'Janssen', 'character', 'seem', 'strong', 'willed', 'streetwise', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'dork', 'father', 'son', 'actually', 'have', 'regular', 'job', 'can', 'watch', 'movie', 'Pool', 'players', 'angle', 'case', 'ESP', 'coverage', 'Billiard', 'Tournament', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'specially', 'Janette', 'Lee', 'Villareal', 'pool', 'games', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'enough', 'tension', 'suspense', 'Jaymie', 'Dornan', 'who', 'son', 'great', 'character', 'actor', 'making', 'how', 'interesting', 'casting', 'actually', 'picked', 'kid', 'who', 'Janssen', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'long', 'pretty', 'angular', 'features', 'movie', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'Janssen', 'ticket', 'getting', 'more', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'skills', 'ability', 'convey', 'complex', 'emotions', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'acomplished', 'movie', 'Sequoia', 'Tree', 'stature', 'sexy', 'dark', 'eyes', 'symetrical', 'model', 'face', 'Janssen', 'very', 'tense', 'capable', 'actor', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'totally', 'chuck', 'movie', 'awkwardness', 'developement', 'storyline', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'Chris', 'Eigman', 'instinctual', 'impressive', 'reason', 'why', 'reccommend', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'too', 'single', 'shot', 'Janssen', 'banking', 'ball', 'turning', 'river', 'did', 'one', 'shot-wow', 'also', 'commentary', 'director', 'actress-', 'asked', 'why', 'did', 'Famke', 'wear', 'hair', 'piece/wig', 'movie']",Turn the River

1161550,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B00195FUEG,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[12, 13]","I was interested in seeing this since the film made the distributor posters like the mainstream movie artwork (listed as the number two title this week behind 21), plus it was given a must-see from the indie blurbs in the pre-booking literature.Famke leads a first-time director and recognizable supporting cast in Rip Torn, Lois Smith and Terry Kinney in what is essentially a pool playing/gambling film. Rip plays a pool hall owner that helps a vice-laden mother (Famke) earn volumes of money through setting matches. Her estranged son since birth, played convincingly by Jaymie Dornan, writes letters to her and secretly meets with her in hopes of establishing any kind of relationship. In the course of their writings Famke determines that her son should be with her instead of his over-bearing father. She formulates a plan to hustle a large chunk of money and flee the Country with him.The film is primarily about a mother-son relationship, but in a very strained way as no real back story is given. The film takes place in NYC, but that never seems to play a role either, so that leaves the biggest fans of this piece being the avid pool players. There are a variety of games and incredible shots played out, but the film is only held together by Famke's very convincing portrayal. That of a mom wanting to be with her son, yet creating a way to escape her unending circle of gambling to pay the bills.Some of the complaints I hear are the slow pace, unfilled story lines, choppy text and ambiguous yet poorly played ending. The strengths have been the string music used throughout, Famke, and the awesome pool shots. Listening to the commentary was unrewarding as Famke talks very little, but the only other DVD special feature is worth the visit. It shows the 4-bank shot Famke makes in the film was a first take. All of the mistakes made in writing the film and actually shooting it (as the director lists them) are apparent and detract from what could have been a much better film.Not one I would recommend for a competent story film, but definitely a nod for the pool players as some of the matches go on forever; provides for some great cue work.",2,For the Famke fans and/or pool players only...,1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,2159,"['was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'made', 'distributor', 'posters', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'artwork', 'listed', 'number', 'two', 'title', 'week', '21', 'was', 'given', 'must-see', 'indie', 'blurbs', 'pre-booking', 'literature.Famke', 'first-time', 'director', 'recognizable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'Terry', 'Kinney', 'what', 'essentially', 'pool', 'playing/gambling', 'film', 'Rip', 'pool', 'hall', 'owner', 'vice-laden', 'mother', 'Famke', 'earn', 'volumes', 'money', 'setting', 'matches', 'estranged', 'son', 'birth', 'played', 'convincingly', 'Jaymie', 'Dornan', 'letters', 'secretly', 'meets', 'hopes', 'establishing', 'kind', 'relationship', 'course', 'writings', 'Famke', 'son', 'should', 'be', 'instead', 'over-bearing', 'father', 'plan', 'hustle', 'large', 'chunk', 'money', 'flee', 'Country', 'him.The', 'film', 'primarily', 'mother-son', 'relationship', 'very', 'strained', 'way', 'real', 'back', 'story', 'given', 'film', 'place', 'NYC', 'never', 'play', 'role', 'either', 'biggest', 'fans', 'piece', 'being', 'avid', 'pool', 'players', 'are', 'variety', 'games', 'incredible', 'shots', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'only', 'held', 'together', 'Famke', 'very', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'mom', 'wanting', 'be', 'son', 'yet', 'creating', 'way', 'escape', 'unending', 'circle', 'gambling', 'pay', 'bills.Some', 'complaints', 'hear', 'are', 'slow', 'pace', 'unfilled', 'story', 'lines', 'choppy', 'text', 'ambiguous', 'yet', 'poorly', 'played', 'ending', 'strengths', 'have', 'been', 'string', 'music', 'used', 'Famke', 'awesome', 'pool', 'shots', 'Listening', 'commentary', 'was', 'unrewarding', 'Famke', 'talks', 'very', 'little', 'only', 'other', 'DVD', 'special', 'feature', 'visit', '4-bank', 'shot', 'Famke', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'take', 'mistakes', 'made', 'writing', 'film', 'actually', 'shooting', 'director', 'are', 'apparent', 'detract', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film.Not', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'competent', 'story', 'film', 'definitely', 'nod', 'pool', 'players', 'matches', 'go', 'forever', 'great', 'cue', 'work']",Turn the River
1161551,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00195FUEG,Todd Smith,"[0, 2]","Turn The River is a stupid story, that is poorly directed, and just plain boring. Kailey is a professional gambler who not only lost custody of her son when she got divorced, but also lost the right to even see him. She is convinced that he ex-husband is abusing her twelve year old son, the way he abused her, and she's determined to do the only thing she can about. Kailey goes on a quest to win as much money as she can, so she can get her son and take him away to a better place. First of all, we have no idea why Kailey can't see her son and we so no evidence of abuse by her ex-husband. Gambling, also infers random games of chance, but not with Kailey, honestly it's just ridiculous. The film stars X-men beauty Famke Janssen, who is quite good looking, but unfortunately very dry as an actress. Her son, Law & Orders Jamyie Dornan, is a bit more entertaining, but the role is so badly written, that no one could have made it work. A lot of things are alleged and assumed in this movie, but we aren't shown any of it. It's impossible to separate fact from bull s***, in this incredibly slow dud of a movie. The script is terrible, the acting is bland, and the direction is sloppy.
