Fazio,"[12, 20]","Sometimes a movie makes you take notice, ponder at the first-rate acting talent, and force you to wonder why anyone went to all the trouble to make it. Affair, starring Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood, the real-life couple-in-matrimony, have really strange on-screen 'chemistry.' Wagner comes across as Mr. Silent Stalker to Wood's character, almost forcing himself into her life. Wood's character, legs paralyzed from illness as a child, finally gives into his advances, and before you know it, he's proclaiming his love for her. Spelling must have financed this movie by the word --- and with a really tight budget.... I've never heard such abstract, unbelievable, and unnatural dialogue in my life.The DVD itself has clear menus, and great packaging, however the film transfer looks like soemthing out of a high-school science class: grainy, dark, inconsistant coloring between reels, and flat sound.This movie is straight from the 70s, and it shows. Bell bottoms, shag carpeting, and Elton John eyewear is shared by all in this completely forgettable and pointless anti-romance.... And I'm a huge Natalie Wood fan. Stick with Splendor In The Grass if you want to see Wood in a real romance; watch Wagner in Austin Powers (at least he's supposed to be funny in that flick).",2,"Made in 1973, and it shows",992304000,"06 12, 2001",2001,1275,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'take', 'notice', 'ponder', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'talent', 'force', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'went', 'trouble', 'make', 'Affair', 'starring', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'real-life', 'couple-in-matrimony', 'have', 'really', 'strange', 'on-screen', ""'chemistry"", 'Wagner', 'across', 'Mr.', 'Silent', 'Stalker', 'Wood', 'character', 'almost', 'forcing', 'life', 'Wood', 'character', 'legs', 'paralyzed', 'illness', 'child', 'finally', 'advances', 'know', 'proclaiming', 'love', 'Spelling', 'must', 'have', 'financed', 'movie', 'word', 'really', 'tight', 'budget', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'such', 'abstract', 'unbelievable', 'unnatural', 'dialogue', 'life.The', 'DVD', 'clear', 'menus', 'great', 'packaging', 'however', 'film', 'transfer', 'soemthing', 'high-school', 'science', 'class', 'grainy', 'dark', 'inconsistant', 'coloring', 'reels', 'flat', 'sound.This', 'movie', 'straight', '70s', 'Bell', 'bottoms', 'shag', 'carpeting', 'Elton', 'John', 'eyewear', 'shared', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'pointless', 'anti-romance', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'fan', 'Stick', 'Splendor', 'Grass', 'want', 'see', 'Wood', 'real', 'romance', 'watch', 'Wagner', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'least', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'flick']",N/A

It is not generally well known, but Natalie always wanted to sing in her previous films.  Her own voice was not quite up to the demands of WEST SIDE STORYand when she played a young Singer on the rise in INSIDE DAISY CLOVER most of her Vocals were also dubbed in by a studio vocalist.  However, in this film she sings ""I Can't See You Anymore"" which for certain did not win any Grammy Awards for Best Song.  She gave it her best shot,and you can judge for yourself.  The film itself is uneven and to some degree, pointless, and the picture quality looks like you are watching it through a fish bowl, but it is a rare opportunity to see Natalie and RJ act together.  They may have had tremendous chemistry together in person, however it did not often translate that well to the screen.
