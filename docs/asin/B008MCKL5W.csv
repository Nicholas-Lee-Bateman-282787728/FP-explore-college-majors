Fans of video games will love how the creators of RvB managed to make a fully functional comedy purely out of a video game. Made only more impressive that it was in the pre-forge/theatre days. The introduction of intense action CG in the later seasons is a fine augmentation to the more serious tone taken beginning in season 6. The action is very well choreographed and exciting. In conclusion I loved this series and it had me laughing all the way through.,5,9.8/10,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,552,"['first', 'five', 'seasons', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'hilarious', 'web-series', 'michinima', 'right', 'be', 'Fans', 'video', 'games', 'will', 'love', 'how', 'creators', 'RvB', 'managed', 'make', 'fully', 'functional', 'comedy', 'purely', 'video', 'game', 'Made', 'only', 'more', 'impressive', 'was', 'pre-forge/theatre', 'days', 'introduction', 'intense', 'action', 'CG', 'later', 'seasons', 'fine', 'augmentation', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'taken', 'beginning', 'season', '6', 'action', 'very', 'well', 'choreographed', 'exciting', 'conclusion', 'loved', 'series', 'had', 'laughing', 'way']",N/A

Simply purchased because of the previous reviews and Elijah Wood, who is one of my favorite actors.After watching the first disc for 20 minutes, I thought this was just to add some sort of a pre-suspense for the actual movie to come,So I fast forwarded till the end and it was a big ? (what).I still cant understand what a few guys in red, orange, green and blue uniforms are doing on a terrible CGI (2D made to a 3D) clip are doing. Maybe I am a bit retarded to understand and the whole world must be sane. everyone is just chit chatting and firing terrible 2D weapons and wearing 2D armour which disappear into rocks (due to bad CGI) all done on something like a kindergarten software.

It is true that a lot of the humor can be understood regardless, but if you don't enjoy Halo I'm not sure you will want to sit through 14 discs, and I think something like 20 HOURS worth of RvB.You don't HAVE to be a Halo fan, but it helps. Check out Rooster Teeth's website to ""test drive"" the videos before buying. If you like what you see, realize that everything on these discs is in the same vein.If you are a fan of Halo, it's worth picking up, definitely. It's a fun watch and I find that while it is edited from the original series as ""broadcast"" on-line, it's still a darn fun watch. If you are a purist, and you MUST see the episodes as they were aired, you will have to enjoy them on the Rooster Teeth website.The quality is pretty high. Video quality is good. Getting 5.1 surround is a bit of overkill, but still sounds good also.The extras disc is DVD only, so it's SD video quality. It's mostly worth watching, but if you skip it, you aren't missing a ton.Overall:Definitely worth checking out. If you want a sampling of the show before buying, to see if it's something you would enjoy, check out the Rooster Teeth website and take in an episode or 10.",4,Good,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1226,"['are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Halo', 'set', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'lot', 'humor', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'regardless', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Halo', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'want', 'sit', '14', 'discs', 'think', 'something', '20', 'HOURS', 'worth', 'RvB.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'HAVE', 'be', 'Halo', 'fan', 'Check', 'out', 'Rooster', 'Teeth', 'website', 'test', 'drive', 'videos', 'buying', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'realize', 'everything', 'discs', 'same', 'vein.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Halo', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'definitely', 'fun', 'watch', 'find', 'edited', 'original', 'series', 'broadcast', 'on-line', 'still', 'darn', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'purist', 'MUST', 'see', 'episodes', 'were', 'aired', 'will', 'have', 'enjoy', 'Rooster', 'Teeth', 'website.The', 'quality', 'pretty', 'high', 'Video', 'quality', 'good', 'Getting', '5.1', 'surround', 'bit', 'overkill', 'still', 'good', 'also.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'DVD', 'only', 'SD', 'video', 'quality', 'mostly', 'worth', 'watching', 'skip', 'are', ""n't"", 'missing', 'ton.Overall', 'Definitely', 'checking', 'out', 'want', 'sampling', 'show', 'buying', 'see', 'something', 'would', 'enjoy', 'check', 'out', 'Rooster', 'Teeth', 'website', 'take', 'episode', '10']",N/A
