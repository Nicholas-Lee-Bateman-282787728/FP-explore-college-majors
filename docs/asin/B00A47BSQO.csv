1605603,A24TEIDZP9ORWG,B00A47BSQO,Camera newbie,"[0, 0]","Always like actors Go Soo and Han Ye-seul, who was hilarious in Couple or Trouble.  Follows the lines of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy may get girl back.  Very attractive leads, lots of twists and turns, good performances.  LIke the absense of a trumped up nasty villain.  Just young people carrying a torcy, wearing their heart on their sleeves.  Soft on maturity of adults making hard choices about love and loss, but hey, this is a K-drama.",5,Bittersweet Korean Romance,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,449,"['Always', 'actors', 'Go', 'Soo', 'Han', 'Ye-seul', 'who', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Couple', 'Trouble', 'lines', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'may', 'get', 'girl', 'back', 'Very', 'attractive', 'leads', 'lots', 'twists', 'turns', 'good', 'performances', 'absense', 'trumped', 'up', 'nasty', 'villain', 'Just', 'young', 'people', 'carrying', 'torcy', 'wearing', 'heart', 'sleeves', 'Soft', 'maturity', 'adults', 'making', 'hard', 'choices', 'love', 'loss', 'hey', 'K-drama']",N/A

Problem for me is I ALWAYS like the young cast better and it is hard to adjust to the new adult characters.  The mother with issues was amazing - you love her and hate her.  I had a little trouble with the whole pretending to be bother/sister to appease the other crazy mom but still liked the story a lot!,4,worth watching!,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,380,"['really', 'liked', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'young', 'cast', 'adult', 'cast', 'Problem', 'ALWAYS', 'young', 'cast', 'better', 'hard', 'adjust', 'new', 'adult', 'characters', 'mother', 'issues', 'was', 'amazing', 'love', 'hate', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'whole', 'pretending', 'be', 'bother/sister', 'appease', 'other', 'crazy', 'mom', 'still', 'liked', 'story', 'lot']",N/A

As I recall, there is only one &#34;snow&#34; scene and hardly any mention of Christmas; but, don't let that dissuade you from watching the series.  This was my introduction to Go-Soo, and I am now a big fan as a result.  He has an expressionless face while the eyes say it all, which, to me, makes for an interesting acting interpretation.  The story has all the components of the Kdramas we love to watch -- abandonment, betrayal, devotion, honor, and dedication.",4,Title is Somewhat Confusing,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,555,"['interesting', 'story', 'recommend', 'am', 'confused', 'title', 'recall', 'only', 'one', '34', '34', 'scene', 'hardly', 'mention', 'Christmas', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'dissuade', 'watching', 'series', 'was', 'introduction', 'Go-Soo', 'am', 'now', 'big', 'fan', 'result', 'expressionless', 'face', 'eyes', 'say', 'interesting', 'acting', 'interpretation', 'story', 'components', 'Kdramas', 'love', 'watch', 'abandonment', 'betrayal', 'devotion', 'honor', 'dedication']",N/A
1605606,A3NK0WFXE8BEX0,B00A47BSQO,Gloria E.,"[1, 1]","This is a good melodrama with a good story line. But I must say, the ending left me a bit confused and frustrated. The drama is about youthful love, tragedy, separation, reunion, and a painful struggle with the past that keeps the characters from being together. Go Soo, the lead male, was excellent. Never heard of him before but I enjoyed his acting. Han Ji-Wan, the main character (Han Ye-Seul played this part), started out as a strong-willed, courageous, and compulsive schoolgirl but as the drama progressed, this character weakened, which was disappointing. This seems to happen in many K-Dramas. Still, a good drama.",4,Will it Snow for Christmas,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,624,"['good', 'melodrama', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'must', 'say', 'ending', 'left', 'bit', 'confused', 'frustrated', 'drama', 'youthful', 'love', 'tragedy', 'separation', 'reunion', 'painful', 'struggle', 'past', 'characters', 'being', 'together', 'Go', 'Soo', 'lead', 'male', 'was', 'excellent', 'Never', 'heard', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'Han', 'Ji-Wan', 'main', 'character', 'Han', 'Ye-Seul', 'played', 'part', 'started', 'out', 'strong-willed', 'courageous', 'compulsive', 'schoolgirl', 'drama', 'progressed', 'character', 'weakened', 'was', 'disappointing', 'happen', 'many', 'K-Dramas', 'Still', 'good', 'drama']",N/A
