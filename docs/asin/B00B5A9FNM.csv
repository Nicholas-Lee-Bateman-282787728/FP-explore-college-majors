DT usally plays most parts with a little quarkiness, but not this time, he plays this part as a streight dramatic part. The movie plays the period before WW11 Europe just perfect. This was really a end of a era for the world. The spy parts were done very well because thay stayed in the shadows and were not the James Bond's types but the ordinary down to earth type's that blended in. I expecially liked where they showed the James Phillbee chareture who was a real life russian spy in the british secret service until he was discovered in the 60's. The Polish locations are beautiful and the old town of Warsaw is wonderful and a testament to the spirit of the polish people who restored Warsaw right after the war which had been distroyed. The polish actors are great in this film. If their is any conplaint, it is the ending, the film did not go far enough. I did like the love story between David and Janet montgomery but I think they could have done more with it.

As a period piece, it felt authentic in terms of clothing and attitudes.  As a romance, it's credible and moving.  The only problem I see with it as a drama is that there are a large number of characters and it's a bit difficult to sort them all out at first, but once the story gets moving, it all comes together.

It's certainly dark and tense, but it's also wonderfully romantic and heroic and beautiful--with a satisfying ending, which I personally need for closure!  The cast is very good--who cares if the actors aren't actually French or Polish or German?  It's the storytelling that matters, and that's well done.  Frankly, it's easier to understand the dialogue without heavy accents getting in the way.  The character which David Tennant portrays has been said, by other reviewers, to seem emotionally restrained.  But I never had that sense at all.  He was a man totally focused, completely absorbed by his work, which needed a clear, cool head because of the danger he was putting himself in.  When he did show his emotions, it was because he was deeply moved.  David Tennant is certainly a very skilled actor and it is always a pleasure to watch him interpret whatever role he takes on.

However, frankly I expected more from both the BBC and as an adaptation of an Alan Furst novel.  It reminded me of the war themed mini-series of the 80's and 90's.  Long on period costumes, well coiffed actors and theme music with PG rated action sequences.  At the very least I would have liked to see some newsreels woven in.Starting with the acting. David Tennant plays the least muscular army officer/spy and Janet Montgomery, sans her ""Jersey Girl"" accent, his love interest.  A professional cast of ancillary characters were simply not allowed to develop within the confines of the script.A big plus is that the 2-part series basically pays tribute to the novel.  My disappointment is that the production values could have been so much more.  There was no real palpable tension or dramatic moments.I started reading Furst in the late 90's when he was much more popular in the UK.  His earlier works were even difficult to source in the US and I would have to order from Amazon UK.  I literally devoured his works and while I feel that he may have slipped a bit with his last 3-4, Furst is still the best Author specializing in the pre-World War II genre.While YMMV, at the right price Spies of Warsaw is worth a watch.",3,"OK As A Period Piece.

1622290,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B5A9FNM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 21]","I am a huge supporter of BBC entertainment, not to mention a fan of David Tennant from way back. For me, the two part ""Spies of Warsaw"" was one of the can't miss propositions of the season. There is an absolutely tremendous story of World War II intrigue and heroism at the center of this production, it seems impossible that this television miniseries didn't work on almost any level. The narrative is choppy, the characters are underdeveloped, and Tennant seems devoid of emotion throughout. Moments of ""Spies of Warsaw"" should have been both heartbreaking and harrowing, but (no matter what happened) I remained strangely apathetic throughout. In every instance, just as it seemed like something was about to happen, the film cuts away to another location. While the first part isn't terrible, more uninvolving than anything, it looked like we were on track for the second part to ratchet up the human drama and suspense. Any hope I had, however, for an upswing came to a crashing halt as the cliffhanger is resolved in two seconds and largely off screen!It's a strange miscalculation, and an alienating one. Maybe there was simply too much material to incorporate into a two parter. Indeed, the presentation spans many years and jumps to assorted locales throughout. But we never stay anywhere long enough to really care about the situation. I never felt like this was life or death (even as characters were dying) because the screenplay never gets close enough or shares adequate details of the intrigue with the audience. Instead of digging into the political aspect of the drama, ""Spies of Warsaw"" tries to hedge its bets as a romance as well. After Tennant meets Janet Montgomery, the two are instantly in love despite an apparent lack of chemistry. The talented cast of supporting characters languish while we spend time on this uninspired romantic pairing. And if I thought things couldn't get any worse, the finale is absolutely ridiculous when it should have been powerful and unforgettable. This is really TRULY a great story, the filmmakers just never get a hand on it.Much of the blame must fall on Tennant, who is either totally miscast or misdirected. His performance is so one-note, so emotionless that it makes it difficult to care about his travails. He is usually so appealing, here (in an effort to be tough, I suppose) he is completely devoid of personality. Even though I've just watched this series, I want someone to instantly remake it! The focus has to be on the story, it is powerful stuff that deserves a better telling. I would rate Part One of ""Spies of Warsaw"" at 3 stars. I neither loved or hated it, I still saw the potential although so much of it had remained unrealized. Instead of getting better, though, Part Two became almost unbearable to me at 1 1/2 stars. And in the climactic moments, I was laughing out loud at how poorly it was dramatized. It turned into pure corn meant to captivate the audience! Even corniness can inspire emotion if done correctly, but this didn't touch me. I was just glad that we'd finally come to the end.

David Tennant as our main character is a flat dead thing.  Sometimes his expressionless face reminded me of Michael Douglas' but in any case the man's soul seemed to have departed.Love interest?  Both main lovers seem bored and unengaged.  Another yawn, fast forwarded.Kudos for big efforts with costumes and street scenes, interiors and old cars and trains.

While most would argue that both of these topics have been mined out it, is to Alan Furst's credit that he is found a unique take on these topics. Furst has us see these events as experienced by unlikely countries and unlikely people.I am an admirer of these books but I find them to be dreary and gray. The reader is too aware of the futility of the good works by his protagonists. It is for this reason that I have held off reading the most recent addition to his book cycle. That makes me a fan but something less than a total fan boy.It was with a sense of anticipation and trepidation that I come to the movie the Spies of Warsaw. Much of what I find in this movie is good. The folks at the BBC workshop have captured the generally gray sense of Alan Furst. Actors and actresses generally perform well. Costuming, Sets and history meet the high standard of the author. Somehow the completed whole is not equal to the various parts.David Tennant as Col. Jean Franois Mercier is a patriotic tightly focused professional threading the role of military attach&eacute; to a just barely prewar Poland while performing off the book functions gathering intelligence and operating spies. I cannot say that I had watched very much of David Tennant's Dr. Who but I kept expecting somebody to liven up the action by admitting that the Col. really was Dr. Who in French Army drag. This may have been my fault but I also think it reflects the general sense that this two episode set,  drags.Without checking chapter for chapter my sense is that the two episodes pretty much reproduced virtually every episode in the original novel. Again my general sense is each scene captures the spirit of the original novel. But at the risk of being repetitious the production lacks spirit.Ultimately this is a production about very competent, very professional people going about difficult and dangerous tasks. What distinguishes the performers that we like is their awareness of things like loyalty and responsibility towards both country and subordinates. The bad guys are not terribly bad and as such the production has a certain subtlety in how it reproduces the period.The real struggle is not so much between our French Col. and the growing belligerence of Nazi Germany but rather his struggles with those of his superiors who either refuse to believe a new war is imminent or more critically may desire to align France with Nazi Germany. It is this second struggle that reinforces the uniqueness of Alan Furst's vision. It is because so many of the performers are acting out the roles of competent professionals that what should be a tense action movie becomes a flat recitation of events.Fans of Alan Furst may enjoy this initial film adaptation of one of his books. There may be enough here to warrant a second viewing. I can only recommend it to those who particularly want to see the novel the Spies of Warsaw played out as a movie.",3,It is all here.

The spy thriller stars the young Scottish-born actor David Tennant, who made his name inHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and DR WHO, and is now starring in BROADCHURCH on BBCAmerica.  It is based on the novel of the same name by Alan Furst, well-known author of spy thrillers.Tennant plays Jean-Francois Mercier, an aristocratic military attach&eacute; at the French embassy in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. It is the late 1930s, and war is clearly coming to Europe. French and German intelligence operatives are locked in a life-and-death struggle. Mercier, newly appointed officer at the French embassy, is a decorated hero of the 1914 war. The handsome newcomer is drawn into a world of abduction, betrayal, and intrigue, while, at the same time, he finds himself in a passionate love affair with the beautiful Anna Skarbek, (played by Janet Montgomery) a Parisian woman of Polish heritage, who is a League of Nations lawyer. The French general Beauvilliers, with whom Mercier works, is played by Julian Glover,Battle for Britain.  Lady Angela Hope, an Englishwoman resident in Paris, who seems to be interested in getting to know Mercier better, and also seems to resemble one of the famous English beauties of the period, is played by Fenella Woolgar,Stage Beauty.  Doctor Lapp is played by Anton Lesser; Duff Cooper, a well-known figure at the time, is played by Julian Harris.This is a handsome, well-mounted production, which does itself proud in the areas of appropriate interiors, landscapes, clothes and cars. It is reasonably well-acted, and Tennant brings his characteristic intensity to his part.  But the plot is rather routine, no great surprises, and it does move slowly, as does much of the work of Furst, the author of the underlying novel.  You could say it stops to smell the roses, as it lingers over lovely Warsaw neighborhoods and estate gardens.I've never seen much of Warsaw on film: just various Holocaust movies such as Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST, Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLERS LIST, and various documentaries about the Jewish ghetto uprising. None of these films was particularly interested in lingering to show viewers Warsaw's prettier districts.  And last year, I took the trip of a lifetime to Middle Europe: I was interested to see that Warsaw looks nothing like the Mittel European capitals I recently saw, Budapest, Vienna, or Prague.  Evidently the residents of Warsaw have never had quite as much money as the residents of these more famous cities to invest in their hometown.
