1427390,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004SI5VU4,DVD Verdict,"[17, 17]","Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- ""Series 3 continues the adventures of grizzled, no-nonsense Chief Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw) and his jumpy sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). The pair is tasked with investigating murders in 1960s Northumberland, their cases almost always containing layers of twists and reveals that leave them stunned by the end. Two shows on deck this time -- Gently Evil, Peace & Love -- running 90 minutes apiece. I confess I'm not much of a lover of the genre, but these Gently offerings are so well-staged and absorbing, I always find himself hanging on to each minute, up until the usually surprising reveal. The anchor is Martin Shaw, who consistently turns in great stuff as the eponymous inspector. Gently is understated and stern, yet he's doubtlessly a bad-ass and owns every scene he's in. He may not have the martial artistry or gunplay skills of your generic Hollywood Alpha, but everyone fears him and the guy is never wrong. Gently is quick to rebuke his over-eager and occasionally knuckle-headed partner and Bacchus takes umbrage at this. Still, Gently is so legendary, Bacchus knows how lucky he is to be paired with such a stud. Shaw and Ingleby have good chemistry together and despite their character's sporadic friction, there is affection there, approaching a father/son dynamic and it works. Both episodes are reliably strong, though the ""Gently Evil"" is my favorite. The twist was faintly telegraphed but the writers were deft enough to keep the twists rolling until the very end. The result is a tense, upsetting 90 minutes. ""Peace & Love"" has twists of its own, but ends up focusing on the social mores and anachronisms of the '60s. One of the reasons I enjoy the series is that the setting supplements the mystery and doesn't overpower it. Acorn knows how to do Blu-ray and their presentation here is sublime. The 1.78:1 widescreen transfer may be ""merely"" 1080i, but it is absolutely beautiful, razor-sharp and starkly colored. I don't care what the tech purists might say; ""p"" or not, this is as awesome a slice of video fidelity as I've seen in some time. A clean 2.0 stereo PCM provides the sound.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","I had the good fortune of practically stumbling into these GEORGE GENTLY telefilms by way of flipping through the channels, catching a few bits, and then investing in the DVD sets.  My first go-round was the fourth series; but I was happy to then go back and watch them from the beginning, now bringing me up to date with Series 3.  It's not as if you'd definitely need to watch them in any particular order, though the first season does ably establish the particulars of the character relationships.  I've enjoyed them all, and I'm happy to sound off with a few words on these current episodes as well.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)In ""Gently Evil,"" our duo are called to the scene of a rather grisly and personal murder: a loose woman was killed in her bed, and the murderer draped a delicate handkerchief over the woman's eyes in a curious parting move.  Was it meant to be something sinister?  Or was it something a bit more personal?  As they pull on the various strings, alibis begin to unravel, and the secret they uncover will rock one family to its foundation.  In ""Peace & Love,"" a turbulent protest against nuclear missiles leaves an area professor dead, forcing Gently and Bacchus to question teachers and students alike.  What they uncover brings new meaning to the phrase `higher education,' indeed!Series 3 consisted only of these two telefilms (a total of 176 minutes), and, when measured against the stories explored in Series 1, 2, and 4, I found these a bit convoluted.  That isn't meant to say that they're not believable; rather, it's just that I think the adaptations of these two were probably a bit more involved as both stories involve the greater passage of time.  In fact, several months go by after the set-up of events in ""Gently Evil""; fortunately, the producers cast some very memorable talent in the involved roles so as to make it easier for the audience to keep up with the changing of the times.  As such, these two won't go down as my favorites, but the performances of all the players are so solid its hard not to be momentarily swept up in the affairs of others.GEORGE GENTLY is produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Company Pictures, and Element Pictures, with funding by the Irish Film Board.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through Acorn Media.  As for the technical specifications, no expense has been spared in bringing these films based on the novels by Alan Hunter to life.  Sadly, there are no special features to speak of, but the producers do provide English subtitles for those us who have occasional trouble with the foreign accents and/or euphemisms.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  The GEORGE GENTLY series is a top-notch procedural sent during the turbulent days of the 1960's when oh so much free love and free speech came to some at such an awfully high price.  Martin Shaw is back in top form, as is his faithful aide Lee Ingleby, and I'd imagine that, so long as someone will air these things, they'll keep making them.  And hats off to all involved for doing it as the production quality has yet to falter.  While Series 3 was brief (it only involved two telefilms), I'll definitely stay tuned for more.",4,Gently Returns ...

Martin Shaw is the the veteran Gently and Lee Ingleby the upstart, ambitious Bacchus, and their relationship, oscillating between true friendship and bitter antagonism, very much like a faux father and son combination. the cases often uncover a grim bedrock of hate and prejudice in British society of the time, and the endeavor has a truly gritty tone, both physically and psychologically.

In this third series, George has let his hair grow longer (it's always getting in his way) and Bacchus, his twerpy side-kick. is wearing his hair shorter over last season. He could be one of the Beatles--they use hair to indicate time setting.  Although the series presumably takes place in the 1960's it's not so retro that it's annoying.  There's still some forensics, although most of the crimes are solved with interviewing and intuition.  The characters, George and Bacchus, continually share their perception of the cases they are working on which usually match what the viewers are thinking.  So, it's satisfying.  You believe you are solving them right along with them.George has taken a fatherly interest in Bacchus's soon to be ex-wife which adds some fun tension to the plots.  Bacchus is his usual insensitive, sexist self with women.  Sometimes you wonder HOW George puts up with him, but they seem to be a good team.  The crimes are original and not easily solvable.You don't feel like you are watching a show.  It seems like the events are really transpiring and the dialogue is great fun.

The next series which is available now is only 2 as well. But the fifth series which is being shown in 2012 is again 4 eps. this show takes you back to the midsixties in northern england.

But this is a crime show about a detective and his sergeant who are out to solve murders. The country was much less tolerant than today in many regards and this is a time travel trip back to a long vanished era. The 1960's. The cases are realistic and the show has that drama edge you'd expect. It's not a action show but a detective show and I watch any british detective show I can.

Detective Gently is from the UK and rose through the ranks at Scotland Yard. His wife was murdered in front of his eyes and he decided to retire. However, a case came his way that involved his wife's murderer, and he took it. The case took him to the north of England, Northumberland, near the Scottish border, and he found he liked it. Gently found his new home.The time is 1964, England is still in the leeway between the conservative UK and the new generation that wants to be free. The bouffant hairdos, the shirt and ties and blue suits. The times they are a'changin', but The Beatles have not invaded as of yet. Northumberland seems to be the seat of drug running and other crimes, and Chief Detective Inspector is kept quite busy. His partner in crime, so to speak, is young Detective Sergeant, Lee Ingleby, aka John Bacchus. Detective Sgt Bacchusis a work in progress, and Gently has some work in front of him. Bacchus is very young, but determined to be the best detective he can be. He is married to the Chief Constable's daughter, and it appears he married her because she was pregnant, and not because he loved her. We can see trouble on the horizon. We don't know much about Gently's personal life, this is all business, and he is having difficulty while mourning his wife's death.Gently is a very classy man, and he is a perfectionist. He is also one of the more intelligent detectives, and we learn how he solves a case. He is polite, does not believe in brutality with the people who he arrests or brings in for questioning. Brutality seems to be the right of passage at this time, and it is a good lesson that Gently bestows on Bacchus. The cases they solve are extraordinary and so well written. This is a series that keeps us involved and interested. An intelligent series that appeals to the masses. The mystery series that the UK brings to us are addicting. They are far and above some of the best written shows. No wonder that PBS brings these shows to us. George Gently and John Bacchus become involved in murders at a sex club, with corrupt politicians, gangs, drug running and in-between run into racism. They deal with all of this deftly and rarely encounter violence.One of the better mystery series from the UK. I read recently that the George Gently series will continue, and we shall see more of a detective series that has become a favorite.Recommended. prisrob 05-29-13",4,CDI,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,2547,"['George', 'Gently', 'played', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'kind', 'Chief', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'would', 'want', 'advising', 'working', 'town', 'Detective', 'Gently', 'UK', 'rose', 'ranks', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'wife', 'was', 'murdered', 'front', 'eyes', 'decided', 'retire', 'However', 'case', 'came', 'way', 'involved', 'wife', 'murderer', 'took', 'case', 'took', 'north', 'England', 'Northumberland', 'Scottish', 'border', 'found', 'liked', 'Gently', 'found', 'new', 'home.The', 'time', '1964', 'England', 'still', 'leeway', 'conservative', 'UK', 'new', 'generation', 'be', 'free', 'bouffant', 'hairdos', 'shirt', 'ties', 'blue', 'suits', 'times', 'are', ""a'changin"", 'Beatles', 'have', 'not', 'invaded', 'yet', 'Northumberland', 'be', 'seat', 'drug', 'running', 'other', 'crimes', 'Chief', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'kept', 'quite', 'busy', 'partner', 'crime', 'so', 'speak', 'young', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Lee', 'Ingleby', 'John', 'Bacchus', 'Detective', 'Sgt', 'Bacchusis', 'work', 'progress', 'Gently', 'work', 'front', 'Bacchus', 'very', 'young', 'determined', 'be', 'best', 'detective', 'can', 'be', 'married', 'Chief', 'Constable', 'daughter', 'married', 'was', 'pregnant', 'not', 'loved', 'can', 'see', 'trouble', 'horizon', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Gently', 'personal', 'life', 'business', 'having', 'difficulty', 'mourning', 'wife', 'death.Gently', 'very', 'classy', 'man', 'perfectionist', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'intelligent', 'detectives', 'learn', 'how', 'case', 'polite', 'not', 'believe', 'brutality', 'people', 'who', 'questioning', 'Brutality', 'be', 'right', 'passage', 'time', 'good', 'lesson', 'Gently', 'Bacchus', 'cases', 'solve', 'are', 'extraordinary', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'series', 'involved', 'interested', 'intelligent', 'series', 'appeals', 'masses', 'mystery', 'series', 'UK', 'are', 'addicting', 'are', 'far', 'best', 'written', 'shows', 'wonder', 'PBS', 'shows', 'George', 'Gently', 'John', 'Bacchus', 'become', 'involved', 'murders', 'sex', 'club', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'gangs', 'drug', 'running', 'in-between', 'run', 'racism', 'deal', 'deftly', 'rarely', 'encounter', 'violence.One', 'better', 'mystery', 'series', 'UK', 'read', 'recently', 'George', 'Gently', 'series', 'will', 'continue', 'shall', 'see', 'more', 'detective', 'series', 'become', 'favorite.Recommended', 'prisrob', '05-29-13']",George Gently: Series 3

The crime/drama/British mystery production has aired on PBS stations in the United States.  The show centers on Chief Inspector George Gently, an old school copper, once one of the few good men at Scotland Yard. On the eve of his retirement, the world-weary cop decides to pursue one final murder case, suspecting that it was committed by a gangster who's already gotten away with the murder of Gently's own wife. So, as played by the sixty-something Tony nominated Martin Shaw, Gently relocates to Northumberland, in the North East of England, tucked in just below Hadrian's Wall, a relic of the Roman occupation of Britain a millennium or so ago. Gently takes on  headstrong sidekick John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby, NICHOLAS NICKLEBY); starts solving murders in a time of profound change: the 1960s. The series is based on Alan Hunter's novels. In DVD format, there is a 2-disc boxed set, running approximately 176 minutes, widescreen format. The entertainment is also available screened. And, praises be, thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, subtitles. Or how else would anyone on this side of the pond understand a word of that local dialect?The episodes are:Disc 1Gently EvilGently and Bachus are called to a crime scene at a working-class boarding house, where they find a young woman brutally beaten to death.  But her eyes have been discreetly covered  with a white handkerchief. The victim, a &#8216;good time girl&#8217; semi-prostitute, carried her daughter&#8217;s birth certificate in her purse.  The name of the child&#8217;s father was crossed out and &#34;Satan&#34; penciled in. As they follow this lead, Gently and Bacchus probe the  awful secrets of a family that seems to suffer from, and harbor, pure evil.  Features Ruth McCabe, (MY LEFT FOOT), Daniel Casey(MIDSOMER MURDERS).Disc 2Peace & LoveYoung peace protesters from Durham University clash with the police when it is rumored that nuclear submarines will be docking at the local naval base. The next morning, the demonstrators&#8217; fiery leader, the womanizing faculty member Fraser Barratt, is found dead at dockside. The investigation takes Gently and Bacchus on campus, where big changes in the social, political, and sexual spheres have left little peace in the normally placid groves of academia.  Features Sarah Lancashire (LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX, THE PARADISE) as another young academic, and Warren Clarke (DALZIEL AND PASCO) as the campus security chief.The first episode is particularly powerful and engrossing, coming to an unexpected conclusion. The second, though it too reaches an unexpected conclusion, and is powerful and memorable, does feel like it is based on slightly dated original material.  Distinguished casts give us uniformly fine acting. Shaw, whom many viewers consider to be the best actor ever to play Adam Dalgleish in the televised versions of P.D. James' crime novels, has the chops and the gravitas to play Gently, and to carry the show. He and Ingleby play off each other with warmth and humor.  Author Hunter set his work in East Anglia, around Norfolk, where he grew up; however, the television series has been set in more northerly latitude, filmed around Durham and in Ireland. The 1960s were, as any survivor can tell you, an energetically eventful era: the tense political climate of the Cold War; then, attitudes and values begin to change as the Swinging Sixties belatedly hit the North East, a process the scripts show in fine detail. The series is shot in high definition; scripts are witty and ingenious, direction is stylish.  Rural Britain - or is it Ireland?--provides a beautiful backdrop for the action.  The production, which has been compared to FOYLES WAR and MIDSOMER MURDERS, is fully-fleshed out, and fully involving.",5,Shaw Has the Chops to Carry the Show with Warmth and Humor,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,3839,"['GEORGE', 'GENTLY', 'Series', '3', 'British', 'television', 'series', 'debuted', '2007', 'BBC', 'crime/drama/British', 'mystery', 'production', 'aired', 'PBS', 'stations', 'United', 'States', 'show', 'centers', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'George', 'Gently', 'old', 'school', 'copper', 'once', 'one', 'few', 'good', 'men', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'eve', 'retirement', 'world-weary', 'cop', 'decides', 'pursue', 'one', 'final', 'murder', 'case', 'suspecting', 'was', 'committed', 'gangster', 'who', 'already', 'gotten', 'away', 'murder', 'Gently', 'own', 'wife', 'So', 'played', 'sixty-something', 'Tony', 'nominated', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'Gently', 'Northumberland', 'North', 'East', 'England', 'tucked', 'just', 'Hadrian', 'Wall', 'relic', 'Roman', 'occupation', 'Britain', 'millennium', 'so', 'ago', 'Gently', 'headstrong', 'sidekick', 'John', 'Bacchus', 'Lee', 'Ingleby', 'NICHOLAS', 'NICKLEBY', 'solving', 'murders', 'time', 'profound', 'change', '1960s', 'series', 'based', 'Alan', 'Hunter', 'novels', 'DVD', 'format', '2-disc', 'boxed', 'set', 'running', 'approximately', '176', 'minutes', 'widescreen', 'format', 'entertainment', 'also', 'available', 'screened', 'praises', 'be', 'thanks', 'RLJ', 'Entertainment/Acorn', 'how', 'else', 'would', 'anyone', 'side', 'pond', 'understand', 'word', 'local', 'dialect', 'episodes', 'are', 'Disc', '1Gently', 'EvilGently', 'Bachus', 'are', 'called', 'crime', 'scene', 'working-class', 'boarding', 'house', 'where', 'find', 'young', 'woman', 'brutally', 'beaten', 'death', 'eyes', 'have', 'been', 'discreetly', 'covered', 'white', 'handkerchief', 'victim', '8216', 'good', 'time', 'girl', '8217', 'semi-prostitute', 'carried', 'daughter', '8217', 'birth', 'certificate', 'purse', 'name', 'child', '8217', 'father', 'was', 'crossed', 'out', '34', 'Satan', '34', 'penciled', 'follow', 'lead', 'Gently', 'Bacchus', 'probe', 'awful', 'secrets', 'family', 'suffer', 'harbor', 'pure', 'evil', 'Features', 'Ruth', 'McCabe', 'MY', 'LEFT', 'FOOT', 'Daniel', 'Casey', 'MIDSOMER', 'MURDERS', '.Disc', '2Peace', 'LoveYoung', 'peace', 'protesters', 'Durham', 'University', 'clash', 'police', 'when', 'rumored', 'nuclear', 'submarines', 'will', 'be', 'docking', 'local', 'naval', 'base', 'next', 'morning', 'demonstrators', '8217', 'fiery', 'leader', 'womanizing', 'faculty', 'member', 'Fraser', 'Barratt', 'found', 'dead', 'dockside', 'investigation', 'Gently', 'Bacchus', 'campus', 'where', 'big', 'changes', 'social', 'political', 'sexual', 'spheres', 'have', 'left', 'little', 'peace', 'normally', 'placid', 'groves', 'academia', 'Features', 'Sarah', 'Lancashire', 'LAST', 'TANGO', 'IN', 'HALIFAX', 'THE', 'PARADISE', 'young', 'academic', 'Warren', 'Clarke', 'DALZIEL', 'AND', 'PASCO', 'campus', 'security', 'chief.The', 'first', 'episode', 'particularly', 'powerful', 'engrossing', 'coming', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'second', 'too', 'unexpected', 'conclusion', 'powerful', 'memorable', 'feel', 'based', 'slightly', 'dated', 'original', 'material', 'Distinguished', 'give', 'uniformly', 'fine', 'acting', 'Shaw', 'whom', 'many', 'viewers', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'actor', 'ever', 'play', 'Adam', 'Dalgleish', 'televised', 'versions', 'P.D', 'James', 'crime', 'novels', 'chops', 'gravitas', 'play', 'Gently', 'carry', 'show', 'Ingleby', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'warmth', 'humor', 'Author', 'Hunter', 'set', 'work', 'East', 'Anglia', 'Norfolk', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'however', 'television', 'series', 'been', 'set', 'more', 'northerly', 'latitude', 'filmed', 'Durham', 'Ireland', '1960s', 'were', 'survivor', 'can', 'tell', 'energetically', 'eventful', 'era', 'tense', 'political', 'climate', 'Cold', 'War', 'then', 'attitudes', 'values', 'begin', 'change', 'Swinging', 'Sixties', 'belatedly', 'hit', 'North', 'East', 'process', 'scripts', 'show', 'fine', 'detail', 'series', 'shot', 'high', 'definition', 'scripts', 'are', 'witty', 'ingenious', 'direction', 'stylish', 'Rural', 'Britain', 'Ireland', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'action', 'production', 'been', 'compared', 'FOYLES', 'WAR', 'MIDSOMER', 'MURDERS', 'fully-fleshed', 'fully', 'involving']",George Gently: Series 3
