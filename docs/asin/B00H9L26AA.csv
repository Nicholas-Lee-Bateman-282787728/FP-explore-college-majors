His films may be slow-moving and emotional, but by the end you feel as if you've lived with the characters for years. ""Nebraska"" is definitely no exception, and may be one of his best movies to date.Bruce Dern stars as Woody Grant, an aging-father who receives a letter from a sweepstakes company claiming he has won a million dollars. Despite his whole family continuously telling him it is a scam, his son David (Will Forte) offers to drive him to Lincoln, Nebraska so he can collect his money. Forced to face their past problems together, they embark on a unique road-trip full of funny and interesting surprises.Payne directs beautifully, with stunning black and white visuals that knock you off your feet.

1687375,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,B00H9L26AA,Cagneyfan67,"[0, 0]","Bruce Dern lands the role of a lifetime that he deserved. He was a very talented actor typecast as the bad guy. He was forever hated as the man who shot John Wayne in the back in 'The Cowboys' he received death threats, was beaten up by guys at bars and had an old woman hit him with a cane. In 'The Great Gatsby' he also played a very bad guy character who was hated. In this movie he is different though.It seemed in the part that there wasn't much to it other than an old man starting to slip into a condition. It's more than that though. It was a role played masterfully done by a great actor. Dern plays Woodrow T. Grant. A man who has flaws like us all. He wasn't the best father due to his alcoholism and the fact he is unhappy in his marriage. Dern becomes confused when he receives a publishers clearing house one million dollar award. He is determined to go claim his reward even if it means walking a great distance there.Will Forte plays his nice good son who takes care of him and decides to take him on a trip to Nebraska to live his fantasty to be happy. Forte gave an underrated performance that was massively snubbed by the Oscars. Will Forte is a really good actor and I felt like I knew his character. Having a very close relationship with my father made this movie very special to me. Forte really cares for his dad and despite his father's mistakes he doesn't pick on him or constantly throw it in his face like his brother and mother.June Squibb is a great actress and she was awesome in this. She can be nasty and mean but she stands up for the man she loves in Dern. Despite them not always getting along he was still a good man. Squibb is awesome she doesn't put up with any crap. She can be mean but she really does love her husband despite her early remarks in the film about putting him in a assisted living home. Dern is a generous man who is kind to his friends. He would never turn a friend down and it was his downfall. We also learn about his time in The War and we can see that affected him.Stacy Keach does a great job as an old sketchy shady former business partner of Dern who is eager to try to take advantage of Dern's newfound wealth. Keach makes up lies trying to say Dern owes him a lot of money. He's a real jerk and tells Forte he will bring his lawyer into the situation. Dern's family like Keach are after his money. It's nice to see a few people in the small town are actually happy for him. Angela Mcewan has a small but pivotal part in the story. She was a former girlfriend of Dern. She is a very sweet nice kind lady unlike Squibb. You get the feeling if Dern ended up with her things might have been different.One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Forte is confronting Dern about his drinking problems. Dern is in denial than finally says 'Godamnit you do what you want to do and so do I'. It was a great line and part in the film. My second part in the film is when Forte punches Keach and knocks him out for making fun of Dern and humiliating him in front of a crowd over the fake award money. The last scene in the movie is beautiful and powerful.This film it's not about an old man slipping it's a beautiful story of a son and father bonding and making peace towards the end of the father's life. The son learns a lot about his father he never knew and learns a lot about himself through the journey. After a lifetime of being pushed aside and disliked Dern gave a performance of a lifetime in a movie that will stick with you long after seeing it. Although Dern didn't get an Oscar I get the strong feeling he will get one before he passes on. I've rewatched the film many times. I strongly recommend it to everyone.

They would argue that, once again, we just have a road trip -- check -- and that once again, we have two guys going on that road trip -- check -- and furthermore, they would argue that one of those guys drinks too much -- check -- and the other guy is struggling along in a career that's going, well, sideways -- check.So while those people might have a point, I think that they would be wrong.I believe that the themes are actually quite different between the two films.  I would argue that the main theme in ""Sideways"" might be something like:  ""Be willing to look past some idiosyncrasies of friends, as everyone has his or her own issues.""  But I might argue as well that the theme here might be:  ""It's hardest to see the good qualities of people that are closest to us.""But of course the films do have quite a few similarities, as I've discussed above, and I think that you can look past those similarities when you have two quality pictures such as these.  And there are some differences, of course.  This was in black and white -- which many people have incorrectly criticized -- while ""Sideways"" was in color.  In 'Sideways,"" the protagonists drank wine, while the protagonists in ""Nebraska"" drank beer.  ""Sideways"" was set in southern California with a more laid-back California lifestyle, while ""Nebraska"" is set in, well, Nebraska, as well as other places in the Midwest.I used to live in the Midwest myself, and I thought that the accents and peculiarities were spot on.  Sure, Mr. Payne may have gone slightly over the top a bit with those peculiarities, but not too far.  With almost all generalizations there is an element of truth, especially generalizations that are funny.And I found this film very funny, even hilarious at times.  And it is ""heartwarming"" I suppose, even though I hate to use that overly-used-to-the-point-of-losing-its-meaning word.  But sometimes, it might be a good idea to look at other people from a slightly different angle, particularly those with whom you are too close.

It's a very real portrayal of a family who is as loving as a cactus and a cat. There are no special effects, no blood, no death, no robots, no car chases... just an exceptional film about Americana acted out with thoughtfullness and care. The father thinks he's become a millionaire through a pre-printed magazine subscription clearing house letter he receives in the mail and is determined to get to Nebraska to collect his winnings.  There is a deadline that he has to get there by so his one son decides that rather than allow his determined father to walk to Nebraska, he'll drive him.  Let the road of life trip begin! Along the way the father tells old friends and family that he's hit the big one and now everyone is suddenly interested in this guy and tells his son that they loaned his dad money years ago and &#34;he better pay up or else&#34;.... The interaction between the father and son leaves you uncomfortable at times because it's so strained and tense yet below the surface you discover the real love and respect they do have for one another.  This is a film everyone should see.

1687400,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B00H9L26AA,Christopher Schwinger,"[1, 2]","The story is really good, and there are some moments where comedic writing really shines.  Maybe I had too high of expectations that it'd be PRIMARILY a comedy.  I would classify it as a melancholy comedy with the same kind of flavor as Billy Wilder, such as his movie The Apartment (1960).  It's interesting that the movie doesn't even attempt to construe the story into one of family reconciliation.  Bruce Dern's character's wife remains a shrew instead of respecting him, and the ultimate payoff is that Bruce Dern regains self-respect through an act of deception like Andy would do for Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show.  Like The Andy Griffith Show, it stereotypes a sector of the United States and has a lot of darkness mixed in with the comedy.  It is kind of a weird combination between Billy Wilder and The Andy Griffith Show.I would probably have given it 4 stars, in spite of its profanity, if it had more light-hearted moments.  It earned that 3rd star from me because I enjoyed Bruce Dern's and Will Forte's performances a lot.  I think I would have been more satisfied with the movie if it moved the family out of a dysfunctional state and involved June Squibb's character, the shrewish wife of Bruce Dern's, coming to respect him.  The Andy Griffith Show works, I feel, because even though Andy and Opie are the only normal people (at least in the black and white seasons), there's a lot of charm from the quirkiness, and the people in the community care about each other a lot.  I didn't get an endearing feeling about the community/region of the northwestern Midwest that this movie takes place in.  I personally love the Midwest, and I agree with Richard Corliss's online review of this movie, that it &#34;veers between social satire and deadpan contempt&#34;, &#34;the director's home region is a weird place, but you wouldn't want to live there&#34;, and &#34;There's little heart in Payne's [the director's] heartland.&#34;  I like the careful casting of every face, but feel like instead of making the community/region feel endearing, there's little charm.

1687411,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00H9L26AA,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 2]","Director Alexander Payne has had wild success in writing and directing stories (The Descendents, Sideways) about fragile individuals who are looking for a purpose and meaning amid love and heartbreak.  In Nebraska, he takes a gem of a screenplay by Bob Nelson about a fateful road trip and elicits strong performances from a terrific cast.An elderly man, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), is determined to travel cross country from Billings, Montana, to Lincoln, Nebraska, to claim a million dollar prize despite the objections of his wife Kate (June Squibb) and skeptical son, David (Will Forte).  He has a habit of wandering off much to the frustration of his family including David&#8217;s older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk).  An alcoholic with a painful past, Woody takes the long road trip accompanied by David.  Along the way, they stop by the town of Hawthorne for an impromptu family reunion where news of Woody&#8217;s windfall spreads, and with it come greedy family and friends particularly in the person of an old buddy, Ed (Stacy Keach).  As Woody and David approach their destination, old memories are revived and a father and son bond.Payne creates a reality that successfully conveys a feeling of family and its dysfunction, which makes the story believable and authentic.  While David realizes that he has nothing in common with his extended relatives (and you might not want them in your family either), you sure as heck won&#8217;t forget them!The film is divided into a series of vignettes, some with amusing payoffs.  Woody rarely filters his thoughts as evidenced in his explanation to David about how Woody and Kate started a family.  It is a gem.  There is an outrageous moment near the end when the brothers David and Ross attempt to right a wrong with hilarious results.The journey is the point of the story. There are similarities in theme and characterizations to The Straight Story.  David uses the trip as a way to get closer to his dad. In fact he learns some surprising things about Woody via the local newspaper and a certain female with a shared past.Veteran actor Bruce Dern (Coming Home) makes the most of the role of a lifetime as a father looking for redemption.  In the last chapter of his life, Woody does not have many prospects or things to look forward to, but he does have a prize that motivates him and is a sense of pride.  It gives his empty life meaning.  Grumpy and blunt, he can be confused and oblivious at times, but when he isn&#8217;t drinking at a local bar, he has moments or clarity and recall that can be jarring.The revelation here is the natural acting abilities of former Saturday Night Live player, Will Forte, who is completely convincing as the dutiful son, David.  June Squibb is quite good as the mom who speaks her mind and proves a nice counterpoint to Woody.  Her scene at the family cemetery is a riot.The town of Hawthorne is not unlike the Midwest town featured in The Last Picture Show.  Gorgeously Photographed in black and white amid a Midwest landscape, the film uses its setting to great effect as the towns and farmland become characters too like the old, derelict family house which serves as a touchstone replete with memories and demons. A grassroots country musical score complements the visuals.In a way this is not only a father&#8217;s quest &aacute; la Don Quixote but a son&#8217;s search for his family&#8217;s roots.

After repeated attempts to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim the prize, his youngest son David decides it's best to give the old man a ride.  After all, there's not much time left, and he and his father have never really been close.This is a beautiful film, revolving around a very simple core: two sons (the fantastic Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk) learning about their family's history in their father's hometown, reuniting and clashing with their relatives, getting to know their parents (the incomparable Dern and a pitch-perfect June Squibb) a little better.  The premise is simple; the emotions aren't.  Rendered beautifully in stark black-and-white, with nuanced direction from Alexander Payne, the film alternates between moments of intimate hilarity, to heart-wrenching reality.  It can be quite hard to watch in spots, as honest as it gets.  If the film has one flaw (note the lack of a fifth star), it's that Bob Nelson's script gets a little repetitive in spots; the same jokes reworked and rehashed.  The film could maybe lose about twenty minutes here and there.  But ultimately, this is a film to watch and experience.

1687420,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00H9L26AA,David Baldwin,"[4, 4]","Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is a man who lived a life of little consequence.  He grew up in the U.S. heartland, served his country in Korea, married Kate(June Squibb), and had two boys.  When the film begins Woody is ambling down the interstate in Billings, Montana in a disheveled state telling the police officer that he's going to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim a prize he thinks he won through a magazine publishers sweepstakes.  Kate is livid at the delusional Woody wanting to put him in a home.  The youngest son, David(Will Forte), is more accommodating driving Woody to Lincoln himself to dispel the fantasy.  The purpose of the trek is twofold.  For Woody its an opportunity for redemption, a chance for some significance to his life as it winds down.  For David, who is coming off a recent breakup of a two year relationship, not only is the purpose to quell Woody's delusions but a chance to reconnect with the early stage Alzheimer's Woody before it is too late.  Director Alexander Payne frames this film brilliantly contrasting in luxurious black-and-white cinematography the harsh Midwestern landscape against Woody's weather beaten visage.  This in turn mirrors the odyssey of Dern who after a career as a celebrated supporting actor is given a role that summarizes his journey as an artist.  His Woody is a man of few words and there's not a wasted gesture or  expression with Dern defining him with his mournful eyes.  If there is a scene that defines the film it's the one where Woody with little emotion relates how his younger brother died of scarlet fever when the child was two years old.  Squibb takes the opposite tack by painting the feisty Kate in broad strokes not afraid to drop a vulgarity here and there.  This is a career opportunity for the octogenarian Squibb and she embraces it like hellfire.  Forte, best known from his days on &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34;, is appropriately restrained.  He probably has more dialogue than anyone in the film but he wisely demurs to his elders.  I don't think Payne is making any earth shattering statements other than the importance of closure in a person's life.

Sharp, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography does a masterful job of driving home the moral gray areas of its cast, while also reinforcing the bleak, desolate landscapes of the American plains in winter. Bruce Dern is hauntingly effective as the desperate lead character, teetering on the verge of dementia while his family deals in their own ways, but it's Jane Squibb who steals the scenery. Her turn as the family's stodgy, no-nonsense, firecracker of a matron is a real standout, deliciously funny in a picture that sorely needs that kind of relief. The remainder of the cast doesn't fare so well, with several reciting their lines so flatly that they might be reading straight from cue cards. It's a depressing bit of truth, one that seems to enjoy lingering in the moment, but generally moves along smoothly enough.

The cinematography was poetic in it's Gothic starkness. The acting was delicate, fragile, even, jack-legged and stumbling, lurching towards the forlorn hope. And the story, to me, was a love story about a father and a son--and the surprising things the son learns about his father that he never knew, and how this changes the way he views the old man in a more generous light. Some reviewers have reacted as if Woody is the protagonist, but Woody remains something of a cipher, throughout it all. This is a story about David, the son. After all, his immediate problem is this delusional, rambling father whose indifference towards him has always left him with some unfulfilled wish for a deeper connection. Before the old man is gone, forever. Mom is no help, since her stack of unfulfilled wishes with Woody reaches so high that it is toppling. Sometimes father and son made me think of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Sometimes of King Lear led by his Jester, or Gloucester led by Edgar, sometimes Odysseus with Telemachus.The dialogue is spare, but evocative, and at times conveying in a most subtle manner what the Japanese call 'mono no aware', the eternal transience of things. Rising and falling, emerging and disappearing. Fading like the smoke from a cigarette in a breeze, like ashes swirling into the wind. The Japanese term Wabi refers to a kind of simple, austere beauty and this quality is felt throughout the film. The story revolves around a quest for a great treasure in which the old and forgotten things are revisited in their disarray and their decomposition(and typical primate behavior among the old friends and family is invoked by the anticipation of a large pile of bananas). Childhood memories are reduced to heaps of sticks and broken cribs and chairs and dead brothers and sisters. Entropy is not what it used to be, it seems. The fact that this quest becomes a minor triumph instead of exploding blazing fireworks with a brass band is somehow more fitting, more complete, more satisfying, given the gentle rhythm and tempo of the story. The slow and stately procession down main street in the new truck was perfect. In the big scheme of things it was very small, tiny almost, and witnessed only by a lucky few, but enough to create a legend, and poignant in it's easy restoration of an old man's dignity.",5,Picture Perfect American Gothic,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2464,"['one', 'rare', 'films', 'element', 'together', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'almost', 'impossible', 'pull', 'apart', 'cinematography', 'was', 'poetic', 'Gothic', 'starkness', 'acting', 'was', 'delicate', 'fragile', 'even', 'jack-legged', 'stumbling', 'lurching', 'forlorn', 'hope', 'story', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'father', 'son', 'surprising', 'things', 'son', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'how', 'way', 'old', 'man', 'more', 'generous', 'light', 'reviewers', 'have', 'reacted', 'Woody', 'protagonist', 'Woody', 'something', 'cipher', 'story', 'David', 'son', 'immediate', 'problem', 'delusional', 'rambling', 'father', 'indifference', 'towards', 'always', 'left', 'unfulfilled', 'wish', 'deeper', 'connection', 'old', 'man', 'gone', 'forever', 'Mom', 'help', 'stack', 'unfulfilled', 'wishes', 'Woody', 'so', 'high', 'toppling', 'Sometimes', 'father', 'son', 'made', 'think', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'Sancho', 'Panza', 'Sometimes', 'King', 'Lear', 'led', 'Jester', 'Gloucester', 'led', 'Edgar', 'sometimes', 'Odysseus', 'Telemachus.The', 'dialogue', 'spare', 'evocative', 'times', 'conveying', 'most', 'subtle', 'manner', 'what', 'Japanese', 'call', 'aware', 'eternal', 'transience', 'things', 'Rising', 'falling', 'emerging', 'disappearing', 'Fading', 'smoke', 'cigarette', 'breeze', 'ashes', 'swirling', 'wind', 'Japanese', 'term', 'Wabi', 'refers', 'kind', 'simple', 'austere', 'beauty', 'quality', 'felt', 'film', 'story', 'around', 'quest', 'great', 'treasure', 'old', 'forgotten', 'things', 'are', 'revisited', 'disarray', 'decomposition', 'typical', 'primate', 'behavior', 'old', 'friends', 'family', 'invoked', 'anticipation', 'large', 'pile', 'bananas', 'Childhood', 'memories', 'are', 'reduced', 'heaps', 'sticks', 'broken', 'cribs', 'chairs', 'dead', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'Entropy', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'fact', 'quest', 'minor', 'triumph', 'instead', 'exploding', 'blazing', 'fireworks', 'brass', 'band', 'somehow', 'more', 'fitting', 'more', 'complete', 'more', 'satisfying', 'given', 'gentle', 'rhythm', 'tempo', 'story', 'slow', 'stately', 'procession', 'down', 'main', 'street', 'new', 'truck', 'was', 'perfect', 'big', 'scheme', 'things', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'tiny', 'almost', 'witnessed', 'only', 'lucky', 'few', 'enough', 'create', 'legend', 'poignant', 'easy', 'restoration', 'old', 'man', 'dignity']",N/A

1687458,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00H9L26AA,FNDNreview,"[8, 11]","Believe it or not, even in the 21st century of technology, black and white feature films are still relevant. For those of you that are young enough to not comprehend the fact that the VCR used to a monumental piece of technology, it probably blows your mind to imagine having to watch every single movie in back and white. But, thanks to evolution and plenty of smart people to keep pushing that hamster wheel forward, here we are in a world dominated by high definition, IMAX, and 3D. However, every now and then a director decides to do the unthinkable and revisit the landscape of colorless cinema. While he's certainly not the only director to make a movie in black and white this year, Alexander Payne still decided to go with a classic look for his newest endeavor, Nebraska.In the film, originally written by Bob Nelson, Bruce Dern stars as Woody Grant, a stubborn, elderly man that believes he's won a million dollars from a magazine sweepstakes letter that he received in the mail. Relentlessly, Woody keeps attempting to walk (since he has no driver's license or vehicle) from his Montana hometown all the way to Nebraska to collect his winnings &#8211; despite ridicule from his wife, Kate (June Squibb) and unsuccessful attempts by his sons, David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk) to restrain him.As it happens, David recently broke-up with his girlfriend and believes it might be best for him to get out of town for a bit. To appease his father, David decides to drive him to Nebraska &#8211; but they will make a pit-stop in Woody's hometown to see their relatives (whom they haven't seen in quite a long time). It becomes quite the unique reunion when Woody shares the news that he's about to become a millionaire. Like in most small towns, word travels fast and Woody quickly becomes the talk of the town, quickly earning the attention of his old business partner, Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach).The film might be called Nebraska, but it has very little to do with the cornhusker state, other than it being the ideal destination for Woody. It's his persistence and ambition to make it to Nebraska to claim his prize that fuels this story, even in spite of the fact that everyone close to him knows its a complete waste of time. Other movies, like Napoleon Dynamite and Clerks come to mind after witnessing this film, not because Nebraska is black and white or a comedy, but because of the randomness of the scenario. Films of this nature, despite how silly they may seem to some, tell unique stories about unplanned courses of action, ultimately leading to a successful narrative.Bruce Dern, a well-established and greatly respected actor, puts on the performance of a lifetime. Yes, that's a statement that is far too overused these days, but the most incredible part of the performance is that he has very few lines throughout the course of this film &#8211; a film which is completely centered on him. It's hard to decide what drives this character, and that easy to decipher from his very first scene of the film where he's already randomly walking down the road. You don't know where he's going or what he's doing half the time, but this character seems to know what he's doing &#8211; at least that's how it seems. It's also quite possible he's going crazy or on the verge of Alzheimer's. Regardless, Dern plays this character off like a carefree, tireless man (even though he's often caught napping).Dern's co-star and onscreen son, David &#8211; portrayed by former Saturday Night Live funnyman, Will Forte, gives a relatively serious performance as a rather mild mannered, causal son. Oddly enough, if you were expecting the humor to come from the MacGruber star, you will surely be disappointed. Instead, the majority of the comedic relief comes from Dern's unfiltered wife, Kate &#8211; portrayed by the delightful June Squibb. She is a dominant presence in each and every single one of her scenes, and is clearly the commanding figure in the family. She's vulgar at times, but will quickly earn the admiration of viewers. In fact, she might even be in line for a few nominations come award season &#8211; and if so, she should be considered a serious contender.Overall, Nebraska is a warm, heart-filled film that proves that even the simplest ideas can still make for an entertaining story. The biggest hang-up with this film is the fact that it's in black and white, which has the tendency to turn some moviegoers off. However, after seeing it without color, there's little doubt it would be an entirely different animal if it were in color. Also, audience will sway towards an older audience, which is understandable since the film does center on an elderly man that thinks he's won a million dollars. Obviously, the presence of anyone under the age of 35 years sends the message that this film isn't for a younger audience to begin with, yet it still manages to depict the elderly as child-like on more than one occasion. It also shows just how greedy friends and family can become when they find out you're suddenly wealthy. In the end, Nebraska is no Grumpy Old Men or anything extreme like that if that's what you're thinking, but it definitely has its own share of outlandish, unpredictable moments. If you have the temperament for a black and white feature and just want to watch a fresh movie with outstanding acting, feel free to give this one a shot. You won't be disappointed.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,"Bruce Dern stars in warm, heart-filled 'Nebraska'",1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,5436,"['Believe', 'not', 'even', '21st', 'century', 'technology',

Gray-on-gray is the real color scheme of cultural stagnation and senility in the &#34;back sixty&#34; acreage of the high prairie states. Gray are all the heads, gray the faded siding on the farm houses, and gray the prospects for anyone under thirty still living there.There were lots o' laughs from the urban audience in the the theater where I saw Nebraska, but they were &#34;laughs at&#34; rather than &#34;laughs with.&#34; Since the real-life peers and look-alikes of these characters are, some of them, dear to me, I felt uneasy laughing but I couldn't help it. &#34;Nebraska&#34; doesn't glamorize its cast of petty, narrow-minded, selfish small towners as 'salt of the earth.' They're unredeemed and outlandish. Comparison with &#34;Fargo&#34; and other Coen Brothers films is inevitable, but &#34;Nebraska&#34; is grittier and - because it's so realistic - crueler than anything from the Coens. Only the younger son of the almost-demented old boozer is assigned any sort of human decency or generosity of spirit ... and he's a dead-end loser, a home theater system salesman living in a claptrap apartment in Billings and wondering whether he hasn't failed to get a grip on real life yet in his solitary thirties. The old man is acted by Bruce Dern, but if you remember Dern from older films I guarantee you won't recognize him. That's the mark of fine acting.And the film is the best of the year, at least of those I've seen, in every category: screen play, direction, leading and supporting actors, cinematography, even the subtle almost subliminal sound track.

This time is no different, and, as usual, I'm really glad I did. (And the Golden Globes agreed with five nominations.) In my personal experience, I have... TWICE... heard that someone had won a sweepstakes, only to learn that it was early onset senile dementia or in the other case, Alzheimer's. This is what we suspect when our elderly hero sets out for Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his million dollars. Problem is, he no longer has a working vehicle, nor does he have a driver's license, so he's walking... from Montana. His son is pulled into the story by his besieged wife.Full disclosure, I spent my early years on a farm in South Dakota, so the set design, the clothes, the speech patterns, the scenery, the pace, the people, and the small faded towns of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Nebraska evoked fond memories. (No, I didn't have an unhappy childhood, sorry...)We watch:* Bruce Dern (""Madison"") is the booze-addled curmudgeon who wants his million dollars. Dern has worked for decades before landing this role of a lifetime! He won ""Best Actor"" at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.* Will Forte (""Saturday Night Live"") is his unfortunate son, unable to talk his father out of that haywire obsession.* June Squibb (""About Schmidt"") is the wife with a tongue like barbed wire. She has lashed her husband for decades until he rarely hears a word she says.* Bob Odenkirk (Lots of TV) is the ""good"" son who has landed a job as a television newscaster. When he gets into a fight he shouts, ""Don't hit the face!""* Stacy Keach (Lots of television) is a former business partner who sees this unexpected windfall as a way to collect some money from our hero.It's difficult to realize that all those authentic relatives and neighbors were actors! Director Alexander Payne (""Sideways"") has evoked astonishingly pure performances, bona fide settings, and credible situations.

1687515,A2U94E760UDYMH,B00H9L26AA,"JKH ""JKH""","[1, 4]","When I saw the preview, I thought that this movie had potential.  It seemed creative to allow an old man suffering from dementia to pretend that he won a publisher's clearinghouse-like sweepstakes.  I envisioned the plot looking into people's reactions to the fake win and, also, a semi-funny roadtrip to Lincoln, Nebraska to ""claim"" the prize.  Some quirky movies are good (i.e. Little Miss Sunshine) and entertaining.  However, this film tried too hard to be ""artsy"" and, in the process, overlooked the fact that the plot was boring and drawn out.Here is the plot in a nutshell:  A family lives in Montana (an old couple, 2 adult sons).  The old man suffers from dementia and incorrectly believes he has won $1 million.  He keeps running off to try to claim the money.  His younger son feels bad for the old man and decides to take him to Nebraska so that he will be satisfied about being able to go.  The have problems along the way and have to make a detour in the old man's hometown (also in Nebraska).  They interact with family members and people the old man used to know.  The personalities of these people are very dull and unremarkable.  I particularly disliked the derelict cousins who overplay their role as petty criminals who are amused by who is more macho.  It wasn't funny nor was it clever.To summarize -- The young son realizes that his old man had spent his life giving and letting everyone run over him.  He coped by drinking a lot (as did all the rural people who had nothing better to do).  Family and friends still prove greedy after learning that the old man won the ""sweepstakes.""  Son realizes that his old man just had a simple dream that wasn't about being a millionaire.  In the end, the old man realizes his dream -- driving a ""new"" truck through town with a new air compressor.  THE END.Problems with the plot:Too long.Too much ranch music in the background (just horrible -- like the movie).Why film only in black and white?  I get that it is artsy and reflects the drab, plain life being depicted.  However, it seemed a bit much.  We get the point without black and white filming (by the way, don't stream this in HD, it is black and white!).  This guy lived a boring life in a boring place.Characters aren't that interesting.

1687544,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B00H9L26AA,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[1, 1]","We just recently watched &#34;Nebraska&#34; on Blu-Ray.  I wasn't sure if I would like it when I heard it was in black and white.  To my mind there was a great reason for black and white movies--FIFTY YEARS AGO when that's all there was.  Since the arrival of color, I am not a purist that thinks films are more &#34;artistic&#34; in black and white--I like to see the color!  I also doubted my wife would watch, as it did not seem &#34;her type&#34; of film.As it turned out we both watched the entire thing without one break and we really liked it.Yes this is a mainly serious film, so a good question to ask yourself at the outset is, &#34;Why did the director choose to make this film?  What does he want to say to the viewer?&#34;  With a movie like this, it's not obviously about making as much money as possible, nor appealing to popular things like car chases, explosions, sex scenes or potty jokes.  I have my idea of an underlying message for the film, but will keep it to myself and just make some general observations.The pace of the movie is slow throughout.  Much slower than the usual &#34;Hollywood movie&#34;.  Dialog is also somewhat limited--often even to a comic degree.  Dern's lines are typically one-sentence answers to questions (often short sentences, at that).  The whole movie takes place in small and rather poor rural towns between Billings Montana and Lincoln, Nebraska.  Part of the back story is that the main character (played by Bruce Dern), and his wife (played by June Squibb), had grown up in Nebraska but later moved to Billings to try running their own business.As the movie begins there's an open question for the family and audience whether Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is becoming demented (either Alzheimer's, or maybe just too many years of hard drinking).  Or is he just hard of hearing, or some of both?  The main plot hook is he got one of those &#34;Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes&#34; type letters, and as a result he is CONVINCED he has WON a million dollars.  He just has to go to Lincoln to collect!  But he no longer has a car and his family fear even allowing him to drive.  So he keeps setting out ON FOOT to get to Lincoln.Finally his younger son Dave agrees to drive him to Lincoln, just so he can see for himself that he won NOTHING.  The pair of them end up the main duo for the film.  Woody's whole life, it seems, has been spent drinking, trying to run a not very lucrative business, and not talking much about anything to anyone.  During the course of the trip Dave, in tiny pieces, begins to learn more than he ever knew about both his dad and his mom, simply because they never talked much with the kids about their past.We also see a fair amount of the older brother Ray (somewhat more successful than Dave, but Dave doesn't seem to resent it), and Kate, (June Squibb) who is undoubtedly the funniest part of this movie.  She's an inveterate gossip who hardly ever has anything good to say about anyone.  For example, her &#34;paying her respects&#34; at the cemetery in the town where they grew up involves her telling David every bad aspect about everyone buried there).We also see the hurtful side of humanity as friends and relatives (who all believe Woody's claim that he won a million dollars) all try to talk or threaten him into sharing some of his (non-existent) new-found wealth.  As Kate trenchantly observes, &#34;Good God!  Usually someone has to DIE before the BUZZARDS start circling!)This movie has a unique charm.  Often in movies I start re-writing characters' lines in my head, wishing they would explain JUST A LITTLE MORE in a conversation.  Here, despite the sparse dialog, less truly was more.  For example: Kate and Woody appear to detest each other.  She's constantly running him down to his sons, while he's standing right there.  For his part, he tries to tune her out (it appears he's not so much hard of hearing as he is IGNORING people).  Yet in one brief moment, when Woody is lying in a hospital bed, napping after falling down and konking his head, Kate gently, tenderly brushes his hair back while chiding her sleeping husband, &#34;You old fool....&#34;",5,Under-appreciated film,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,4156,"['just', 'recently', 'watched', '34', 'Nebraska', '34', 'Blu-Ray', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'like', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'black', 'white', 'mind', 'was', 'great', 'reason', 'black', 'white', 'movies', 'FIFTY', 'YEARS', 'AGO', 'when', 'there', 'was', 'arrival', 'color', 'am', 'not', 'purist', 'films', 'are', 'more', '34', 'artistic', '34', 'black', 'white', 'like', 'see', 'color', 'also', 'doubted', 'wife', 'would', 'watch', 'did', 'not', 'seem', '34', 'type', '34', 'film.As', 'turned', 'out', 'watched', 'entire', 'thing', 'one', 'break', 'really', 'liked', 'it.Yes', 'mainly', 'serious', 'film', 'good', 'question', 'ask', 'outset', '34', 'Why', 'did', 'director', 'choose', 'make', 'film', 'What', 'want', 'say', 'viewer', '34', 'movie', 'not', 'obviously', 'about', 'making', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'possible', 'appealing', 'popular', 'things', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'sex', 'scenes', 'potty', 'jokes', 'have', 'idea', 'underlying', 'message', 'film', 'will', 'keep', 'myself', 'just', 'make', 'general', 'observations.The', 'pace', 'movie', 'slow', 'Much', 'slower', 'usual', '34', 'Hollywood', 'movie', '34', 'Dialog', 'also', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'often', 'even', 'comic', 'degree', 'Dern', 'lines', 'are', 'typically', 'one-sentence', 'answers', 'questions', 'often', 'short', 'sentences', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'small', 'rather', 'poor', 'rural', 'towns', 'Billings', 'Montana', 'Lincoln', 'Nebraska', 'Part', 'back', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'wife', 'played', 'June', 'Squibb', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'Nebraska', 'later', 'moved', 'Billings', 'try', 'running', 'own', 'business.As', 'movie', 'open', 'question', 'family', 'audience', 'Woody', 'Grant', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'becoming', 'demented', 'Alzheimer', 'maybe', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'hard', 'drinking', 'just', 'hard', 'hearing', 'main', 'plot', 'hook', 'got', 'one', '34', 'Publisher', 'Clearinghouse', 'Sweepstakes', '34', 'type', 'letters', 'result', 'CONVINCED', 'WON', 'million', 'dollars', 'just', 'go', 'Lincoln', 'collect', 'no', 'longer', 'car', 'family', 'fear', 'even', 'allowing', 'drive', 'setting', 'out', 'ON', 'FOOT', 'get', 'Lincoln.Finally', 'younger', 'son', 'Dave', 'drive', 'Lincoln', 'just', 'can', 'see', 'won', 'NOTHING', 'pair', 'end', 'up', 'main', 'duo', 'film', 'Woody', 'whole', 'life', 'been', 'spent', 'drinking', 'trying', 'run', 'not', 'very', 'lucrative', 'business', 'not', 'talking', 'much', 'anything', 'anyone', 'course', 'trip', 'Dave', 'tiny', 'pieces', 'learn', 'more', 'ever', 'knew', 'dad', 'mom', 'simply', 'never', 'talked', 'much', 'kids', 'past.We', 'also', 'see', 'fair', 'amount', 'older', 'brother', 'Ray', 'somewhat', 'more', 'successful', 'Dave', 'Dave', ""n't"", 'seem', 'resent', 'Kate', 'June', 'Squibb', 'who', 'undoubtedly', 'funniest', 'part', 'movie', 'inveterate', 'gossip', 'who', 'hardly', 'ever', 'anything', 'good', 'say', 'anyone', 'example', '34', 'paying', 'respects', '34', 'cemetery', 'town', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'telling', 'David', 'bad', 'aspect', 'everyone', 'buried', '.We', 'also', 'see', 'hurtful', 'side', 'humanity', 'friends', 'relatives', 'who', 'believe', 'Woody', 'claim', 'won', 'million', 'dollars', 'try', 'talk', 'threaten', 'sharing', 'non-existent', 'new-found', 'wealth', 'Kate', 'trenchantly', '34', 'Good', 'God', 'Usually', 'someone', 'DIE', 'BUZZARDS', 'start', 'circling', 'movie', 'unique', 'charm', 'Often', 'movies', 'start', 're-writing', 'characters', 'lines', 'head', 'wishing', 'would', 'explain', 'JUST', 'LITTLE', 'MORE', 'conversation', 'Here', 'sparse', 'dialog', 'less', 'truly', 'was', 'more', 'example', 'Kate', 'Woody', 'appear', 'detest', 'other', 'constantly', 'running', 'down', 'sons', 'standing', 'right', 'there', 'part', 'tune', 'out', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'hard', 'hearing', 'IGNORING', 'people', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'when', 'Woody', 'lying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'napping', 'falling', 'down', 'konking', 'head', 'Kate', 'gently', 'tenderly', 'hair', 'back', 'chiding', 'sleeping', 'husband', '34', 'old', 'fool', '34']",N/A

Instead of the fast cuts and brisk action of most of today's films, this one took its time and slowly built and developed its characters and story.Bruce Dern delivers a great performance and Will Forte and June Squibb -- as his son and wife, respectively -- are also good, but I felt that the rest of the cast were not that great. Their dialogue delivery felt like reading rather than speaking naturally and at least one of the camera compositions/framing was questionable (the scene in which the father and son exit their vehicle and meet &#34;Aunt Martha,&#34; the camera framing is such that their feet are cut right at the ankle -- which is frowned upon and thought of as unprofessional in film school).Having said that, I think the film benefited from being black and white and the dark humor sprinkled here and there kept the film interesting for me. I was hoping for a funnier film and a faster pace, but then the last 10 minutes of the film answered both of those issues for me. In the last 10 minutes, the actions of the son to get closer to his father and the way his father reacted to those actions resonated with me and made me feel something. I felt that if I hadn't endured the slower pacing and the so on, that I wouldn't have arrived at that point. In other words, if I hadn't experienced the film the way I had (weather it was good or bad), maybe I wouldn't have felt all the emotions that unfolded at the end.So for that -- for the fact that the filmmakers did a good job tying up the story and delivering a satisfying and emotional ending -- I recommend this film to all those who enjoy a great story.

1687561,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B00H9L26AA,Larry Benjamin,"[4, 9]","Payne did not write this script, which may explain why it is so far below the calibre of his other films. &#34;Nebraska's&#34; pacing was terrible, with scenes seeming to take much longer than they should have. The low-contrast black and white image was awful - representative of the bleak pointlessness of the characters' lives, but after 10 minutes, painful to look at. The point of the film, made in every scene, that the old man and his son are going to collect the nonexistent prize because he has nothing else to live for, became trite and exhausting in its endless repetition, and the sweet ending was hardly the payoff for the slogging it took to get there.The sole redeeming feature was June Squibb as the mother, who stole every scene she appeared in. I can't help but wonder if Payne punched up her dialog himself. There were also a few strong scenes, like the one where she sets some distant family members straight on who really owes money to whom. This was a great example of how people remember the same events differently. It was more than cancelled out by other scenes, like the one where everyone is sitting around making inane conversation. &#34;Those cars would run forever.&#34; &#34;What happened to it?&#34; &#34;It stopped running.&#34; &#34;They'll do that.&#34; In other films, Payne has shown himself to be a master of mindless yet fascinating dialog - this wasn't it.Bruce Dern was utterly believable as the central character, but Will Forte, like many comic actors, may have bitten off more than he could chew. Comics tend to overact in dramatic roles (see: Robin Williams), or underact, as Forte does here. The character called for understated, seething resentment, on the verge of explosion, not simply understatement. Philip Seymour Hoffman, may he rest in peace, would have pulled it off. In fact, Hoffman would have been a much better choice - in black and white, he even looked similar enough to the other characters to pass as a family member. IMDB indicates that Bryan Cranston (&#34;Breaking Bad&#34;) was considered for the role; he would certainly have done a better job, although he probably looks about ten years too old to play the character.The critical acclaim this film has garnered is mystifying; I can only conclude that the Academy appreciates black and white, as they went gaga several years ago over the mediocre and ridiculous &#34;The Artist.&#34; If this was the only Alexander Payne film I had seen, I would not have bothered with the other ones, and would have missed the truly excellent &#34;Citizen Ruth,&#34; &#34;Election,&#34; and &#34;About Schmidt.&#34; Those are highly recommended; &#34;Nebraska&#34; may be safely skipped unless you're a Payne completist or have committed to watching every film ever made.",1,Alexander Payne disappoints,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,2772,"['Payne', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'script', 'may', 'explain', 'why', 'so', 'far', 'calibre', 'other', 'films', '34', 'Nebraska', '34', 'pacing', 'was', 'terrible', 'scenes', 'seeming', 'take', 'much', 'longer', 'should', 'have', 'low-contrast', 'black', 'white', 'image', 'was', 'awful', 'representative', 'bleak', 'pointlessness', 'characters', 'lives', '10', 'minutes', 'painful', 'look', 'point', 'film', 'made', 'scene', 'old', 'man', 'son', 'are', 'going', 'collect', 'nonexistent', 'prize', 'nothing', 'else', 'live', 'became', 'trite', 'exhausting', 'endless', 'repetition', 'sweet', 'ending', 'was', 'hardly', 'payoff', 'slogging', 'took', 'get', 'there.The', 'sole', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'was', 'June', 'Squibb', 'mother', 'who', 'stole', 'scene', 'appeared', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'Payne', 'punched', 'up', 'dialog', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'strong', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'distant', 'family', 'members', 'straight', 'who', 'really', 'money', 'whom', 'was', 'great', 'example', 'how', 'people', 'remember', 'same', 'events', 'differently', 'was', 'more', 'cancelled', 'out', 'other', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'everyone', 'sitting', 'making', 'inane', 'conversation', '34', 'cars', 'would', 'run', 'forever.', '34', '34', 'What', 'happened', '34', '34', 'stopped', 'running.', '34', '34', ""'ll"", 'do', 'that.', '34', 'other', 'films', 'Payne', 'shown', 'be', 'master', 'mindless', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'dialog', 'was', ""n't"", 'it.Bruce', 'Dern', 'was', 'utterly', 'believable', 'central', 'character', 'Will', 'Forte', 'many', 'comic', 'actors', 'may', 'have', 'bitten', 'off', 'more', 'could', 'chew', 'Comics', 'tend', 'overact', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'see', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'underact', 'Forte', 'here', 'character', 'called', 'understated', 'seething', 'resentment', 'verge', 'explosion', 'not', 'simply', 'understatement', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', 'would', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'fact', 'Hoffman', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'choice', 'black', 'white', 'even', 'looked', 'similar', 'enough', 'other', 'characters', 'pass', 'family', 'member', 'IMDB', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', '34', 'Breaking', 'Bad', '34', 'was', 'considered', 'role', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'probably', 'ten', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'character.The', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'film', 'garnered', 'mystifying', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'Academy', 'black', 'white', 'went', 'gaga', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'mediocre', 'ridiculous', '34', 'Artist.', '34', 'was', 'only', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'other', 'ones', 'would', 'have', 'missed', 'truly', 'excellent', '34', 'Citizen', 'Ruth', '34', '34', 'Election', '34', '34', 'About', 'Schmidt.', '34', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', '34', 'Nebraska', '34', 'may', 'be', 'safely', 'skipped', ""'re"", 'Payne', 'completist', 'have', 'committed', 'watching', 'film', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

The movie opens with Woody walking along the motorway from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska - about 750 miles. Addled by a lifetime of alcoholism and the onset on dementia, Woody refuses to be dissuaded from his quest.Gentle loser David (Will Forte) is his younger son, roped in by his desperate mother, Kate (June Squibb - also deservedly nominated for her razor sharp tongue).Bob Odenkirk (best remembered for his role as Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad) is the older, more successful son Ross. Stacy Keach, who has also been acting forever, is his former friend and business partner, Ed Pegram. The entire cast are excellent, as are the settings. Shot in black and white, there is a stark timelessness to this movie.The audience is given a deeply intimate glimpse into an aspect of mid-Western working class America. Long suffering, infinitely patient, marginalized David, desperate to connect with his father, indulges him by offering to drive him to Nebraska, stopping off en-route at Woody's hometown for a family reunion.  Stubborn, grizzly, taciturn Woody, alternately forgetful and sharp as a tack gets into a fair amount of trouble on the way. Unable to resist popping into bars whenever they stop, Woody is none too steady on his pins either. He tunes out selectively, trained by a lifetime of his wife's carping.&#34;Sideways&#34; director Alexander Payne's keen eye portrays personalities in a matter-of-fact style - each uniquely adding insight and depth to their own and other characters .

Also, the story and acting are all incredibly subtle and patient, and -- aside from a mugging and a quick right hook -- it's fair to say almost nothing happens in the film. Depending on how close you are with your own father or son, you might also find the movie depressing. People who live on the coast might watch the film and find themselves pitying Middle America with a bad taste in their mouths. People from the Heartland might easily feel mocked.But these responses, however legit, are certainly coming from people who are only giving the film a surface-level viewing.Painfully funny (if rarely in a &#34;ha ha!&#34; kind of way), the movie follows a quiet man named David as he takes his father, Woody, on a trip to Nebraska in order to claim a million dollar prize. Woody, always shown with a half-vacant gaze and Doc Brown haircut, doesn't appear to operate on the same plain of awareness as anyone else. It's easy to think he's teetering on the edge of senility, but many of his remarks and responses indicate a man who is not suffering from decrepitude so much as ennui or despair.In fact, the movie is chock full of people who seem to view life as a giant waiting room for some kind of Great Bland Hereafter. You will not find anyone in this film with a whole lot of passion, as if most of the cast were an embodiment for the apathetic sterility of the gray flatland that makes up the film's heart-breaking scenery. In spite of what feels like a near total apathy in the characters, there are glints and glimmers of satisfaction in the quiet, simple lives these characters lead, whether they're running hometown newspapers or just sitting by the side of the road and watching the cars go by.The real story is one of connection between father and son, and it happens at such a slow simmer that it's nearly impossible to tell when and where the relationship fully flowers into understanding. Thankfully, the film never resorts to sappiness or schmaltz, and it absolutely refuses to moralize with the script, the closest you get to a moral coming in the following exchange:A: &#34;What's wrong with your father? Alzheimers?&#34;B: &#34;No. He just believes what people tell him.&#34;A: &#34;That's too bad.&#34;Delivered with the same dead-pan as nearly every other line, what is both sad and hilarious about that exchange is easy to miss in the stark black-and-white silence of the rest of the film. But it neatly encapsulates the point of the film: belief, connection, and how it's too bad that neither of those things ever come so easily or so neatly. A lesson that's easier said than learned, it matches this film that will try the patience of hastier viewers, but which will reward those who don't mind sitting by the road for a while and just waiting contentedly to see what happens to pass by.",5,"The Strong, Silent Type",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,2915,"['lot', 'NEBRASKA', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'hate', 'black-and-white', 'one', 'Yuck', 'Also', 'story', 'acting', 'are', 'incredibly', 'subtle', 'patient', 'aside', 'mugging', 'quick', 'right', 'hook', 'fair', 'say', 'almost', 'nothing', 'happens', 'film', 'Depending', 'how', 'close', 'are', 'own', 'father', 'son', 'might', 'also', 'find', 'movie', 'depressing', 'People', 'who', 'live', 'coast', 'might', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'pitying', 'Middle', 'America', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouths', 'People', 'Heartland', 'might', 'easily', 'feel', 'responses', 'however', 'legit', 'are', 'certainly', 'coming', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'giving', 'film', 'surface-level', 'viewing.Painfully', 'funny', 'rarely', '34', 'ha', 'ha', '34', 'kind', 'way', 'movie', 'quiet', 'man', 'named', 'David', 'father', 'Woody', 'trip', 'Nebraska', 'order', 'claim', 'million', 'dollar', 'prize', 'Woody', 'always', 'shown', 'half-vacant', 'gaze', 'Doc', 'Brown', 'haircut', ""n't"", 'appear', 'operate', 'same', 'plain', 'awareness', 'anyone', 'else', 'easy', 'think', 'teetering', 'edge', 'senility', 'many', 'remarks', 'responses', 'indicate', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'suffering', 'decrepitude', 'so', 'much', 'ennui', 'despair.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'view', 'life', 'giant', 'waiting', 'room', 'kind', 'Great', 'Bland', 'Hereafter', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'anyone', 'film', 'whole', 'lot', 'passion', 'most', 'cast', 'were', 'embodiment', 'apathetic', 'sterility', 'gray', 'flatland', 'up', 'film', 'heart-breaking', 'scenery', 'spite', 'what', 'feels', 'near', 'total', 'apathy', 'characters', 'are', 'glints', 'glimmers', 'satisfaction', 'quiet', 'simple', 'characters', 'lead', ""'re"", 'running', 'hometown', 'newspapers', 'just', 'sitting', 'side', 'road', 'watching', 'cars', 'go', 'by.The', 'real', 'story', 'one', 'connection', 'father', 'son', 'slow', 'simmer', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'tell', 'when', 'where', 'relationship', 'fully', 'flowers', 'understanding', 'Thankfully', 'film', 'never', 'sappiness', 'schmaltz', 'absolutely', 'moralize', 'script', 'closest', 'get', 'moral', 'coming', 'following', 'exchange', '34', 'What', 'wrong', 'father', 'Alzheimers', '34', 'B', '34', 'just', 'what', 'people', 'tell', 'him.', '34', '34', 'too', 'bad.', '34', 'Delivered', 'same', 'dead-pan', 'nearly', 'other', 'line', 'what', 'sad', 'hilarious', 'exchange', 'easy', 'miss', 'stark', 'black-and-white', 'silence', 'rest', 'film', 'neatly', 'point', 'film', 'belief', 'connection', 'how', 'too', 'bad', 'things', 'ever', 'come', 'so', 'easily', 'so', 'neatly', 'lesson', 'easier', 'said', 'learned', 'film', 'will', 'try', 'patience', 'hastier', 'viewers', 'will', 'reward', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sitting', 'road', 'while', 'just', 'waiting', 'contentedly', 'see', 'what', 'pass']",N/A

Gritty and unsentimental the film certainly is, but the assertion that it's crueler than anything by the Coen Brothers is nonsensical to me. Payne's direction and Bob Nelson's screenplay reveal successive layers of both brutality and poignancy in the story of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) an old man in Billings, Montana, who clings stubbornly to the idea that he has won $1 million in the Publishers' Clearinghouse sweepstakes. David (Will Forte), Woody's hapless son, offers to drive him to Lincoln, Nebraska, just to prove to him he didn't win a cent. But Woody's sudden illness waylays father and son in Woody's home town of Hawthorne, Nebraska, where Woody's family members and old friends take Woody's claims of sudden wealth at face value.""Nebraska"" is a masterpiece of wry humor, and has a keen eye for the tensions that build up within families. Exemplifying those tensions is Kate (June Squibb), Woody's wife, who expresses her disappointments in no uncertain (or chaste) terms. There's also a lot of meanness in the film, exemplified by Woody's old crony Ed Peagram (Stacy Keach) and David's weirdo cousins Bart and Cole (Tim Driscoll, Devin Rattray). But the final emotion we feel in ""Nebraska"" is love, as Woody expresses things he never said before and David learns things he never knew before. It is that tenderness at ""Nebraska's"" core that makes it a transcendent experience. Phedon Papamichael's photography of the Great Plains is as starkly beautiful as anything in ""The Last Picture Show,"" and the acting--particularly that of Dern, Forte, and Squibb--could not possibly be finer, funnier, or more nuanced.

There may be spoilers.Director Alexander Payne delivers another piece of Americana and like his 2004 film ""Sideways,"" it's a road tripper.  Early on one is reminded of Peter Bogdonovich's ""The Last Picture Show.""  The vast landscapes of the great plains of Montana, South Dakota and ultimately Nebraska replace flat and dusty north Texas, but like the 1971 masterpiece, Payne chooses to shoot in black and white.Aging and on the cusp of dementia, Woody Grant (wonderfully played by Bruce Dern) believes he has won a million dollars.  He's received one of the Publisher's Clearing House promotions and is determined to get from his home in Billings to Lincoln in order to collect his winnings.  His cranky wife, Kate (award-worthy June Squibb) won't take him so he makes a couple failed attempts at walking.  His youngest son David (Will Forte) finally agrees to take him, just to keep him from wondering off on his own.  Along the way, Woody falls in his motel room which requires a trip to the local ER.  Woody's mobility is not only impacted by his age but by the fact he sneaks in a drink whenever he can.David convinces Woody to stay with his brother Ray over the weekend in a small withering town in Nebraska.  This is where Woody grew up.  Word leaks out that Woody has won a million dollars and everyone in town assumes it is the lottery.  Many of Woody's old friends get quickly reacquainted especially his former partner played by Stacy Keach.  Then of course, the nephews, and assorted in-laws all want a small piece of Woody's ""fortune.""  Kate and Ross, the older son (Bob Odenkirk), join the reunion and help David keep things in check.  This is where Ms. Squibb really shines.  Cantankerous as she is, she loves her husband and wants to protect him.  She has some great scenes confronting the relatives, but nothing better than when the family visits the local cemetery.While there is plenty of humor throughout the film, it really is a loving and realistic look at a past.  Some good, some not.  Angela McEwan has some memorable scenes as the local newspaper publisher and a former sweetheart of Woody's.

When the movie opens, we see an old guy, whom we later learn is Woody Grant (played by Bruce Dern), walking past the city limit sign of Billings, Montana. A police officer driving by pulls over and asks him where he's going. Woody just points beyond the horizon. It eventually comes out that Woody's got a sweepstakes letter stating that 'we are authorized to pay you $1 million dollars' and Woody, who can't drive anymore, is determined to collect the money from the sweepstakes company (located in Lincoln, NE). Woody's wife Kate (played by June Squibb) doesn't know what to do anymore as Woody has 'escaped' on several times from the house to walk all the way to Lincoln. Woody's son David (played by Will Forte) feels sorry for the old man. When asking Woody why he simply doesn't send in the letter to Lincoln via regular mail, Woody explains &#34;I'm not trusting the mail with 1 million dollars!&#34;, so David offers to drive to Nebraska. They decide along the way to make a stop in Hawthorne, NE to meet up with long-lost cousins and uncles. At this point we are a good 30 min. into the movie. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this movie is a love letter and ode to the Midwest, and Nebraska in particular, from director Alexander Payne, himself a native Cornhusker. But beware, the movie is drenched in nostalgia, if not melancholy, as life in small town America seems to have lost a step or two along the way, take a look at (fictional) Hawthorne, NE, with its run-down main street and widespread unemployment. Second, &#34;Nebraska&#34; is filmed in dramatic back and white, and the movie brings gorgeous shots as Woody and David drive from Montana to Nebraska by way of Wyoming and South Dakota. For a while, the movie does feel like a true road movie, and it makes you want to hit the road yourself. Third, in the gatherings in Hawthorne with family and old acquaintances, you can't but help feeling sorry for the whole bunch, as everyone is convinced that Woody truly is a millionaire and they feel entitled to some of that money, reinforcing the message that money does bring out the worst in people. Last but certainly not least, much has been made by the acting performances in this film, in particular Bruce Dern as the cranky ol' man (he won Best Actor at the Cannes film festival earlier this year), and deservedly so. But for me the true scene stealer in this movie is June Squibb as his feisty ol' lady Kate, with her non-stop comments about everything and everyone. At one point, they go visit the graves of family and friends in Hawthorne, and Kate sees the grave of an old flame, just watch what she does next!The movie premiered to great acclaim at the Cannes film festival 6 months ago, and it finally opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati this past weekend. I went to see it right away. The screening I saw this at was very well attended, and I think this movie has all the makings of a solid hit on the art-house theatre circuit, and maybe even more if the movie does well in the upcoming awards season. Bottom line: &#34;Nebraska&#34; is a delightful comedy-drama with some serious and nostalgic undertones, and fantastic acting performances. If you are in the mood for something that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. &#34;Nebraska is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!.",4,"4.5 stars...

Filmed in crisp black and white, and with a limited original soundtrack, Nebraska is Rated R for language. The 114 minute movie, directed by Alexander Payne, caught me off guard. 220px-Nebraska_PosterThe picture was nominated for six Academy Awards. Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Bruce Dern), Best Supporting Actress (June Squibb), Best Original Screenplay (Bob Nelson) and Best Cinematography (Phedon Papamichael).Although Bruce Dern did not take home an Academy Award, he did win a Best Actor Award at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Fifty-four years in the business, and a solid work history. The man is talented. The award well deserved.Woody Grant (Dern) lives in Montana. He received a Sweepstakes announcement in the mail. It says he&#8217;s won $1,000,000. To collect he needs to mail the form back (with a list of new magazine subscriptions) to Nebraska. However, Woody would rather visit Nebraska to collect the winnings in person.David (Will Forte), Woody&#8217;s son, sells stereos. His girlfriend left him. Nothing is going right. When he sees the letter his father carries around, he tries his hardest to get his absentminded father to understand the announcement is a scam, that there is no money to be won.Woody&#8217;s wife, Kate (Squibb), is at her wit&#8217;s end. Woody&#8217;s tireless efforts to reach Nebraska on foot are causing the family to consider placing Woody in a retirement home. David steps up. He needs a break from life, anyway. He loads his father into the car and plans to take him to Nebraska, hoping to bond and salvage a relationship that was never good anyway. When family and old friends learn of Woody&#8217;s &#8220;good fortune,&#8221; everyone feels they deserve a piece of the pie.Squibb, Devin Ratray and Tim Driscoll &#8211;who play David&#8217;s cousins&#8211; are hysterical. Forte is the straight man. Dern is slow and calculated with nothing much to say, but everything he says either comes out profound or comical.I loved the movie. I highly recommend it. Highly! 5 out of 5 Stars, easily. Easily! Throughout the movie, I compared Nebraska to Napoleon Dynamite. It is the same style of storytelling, with just a bit more drama. The one-liners are non-stop. I laughed out loud from beginning to end. The story was fantastic. The pacing was perfect.

1687670,A2PPJN8OKSXMPT,B00H9L26AA,Pippin O' Rohan,"[0, 0]","On my way to 'Nebraska' earlier this winter on the bus going up Third Avenue in New York, it was bitter cold outside and two men and I, all strangers past sixty, smiled at each other in weather conspiracy. The man sitting closest to the driver introduced himself from the Deep South, and mentioned jovially that he preferred this brisk chill, adding that he had worked for many years in Alaska where the temperature dropped sometimes to 53 degrees below. The other one facing him with silver hair and pale roses in his cheeks was busy warming his hands, and quietly added that when he was in North Korea, he had experienced the same thing. Turning in my direction, he murmured with a twinkle in his eyes 'well, the whales are happy anyway', to which I nodded amused, and then a light conversation began between the three of us.If I bring up this small anecdote, it is because it occurred to me how much these two contemporary Americans of mine have traveled, how much they probably know about America, and that one of these days I plan to pull out a map and start doing some homework on what one might call 'The Heart of America'. There is a big difference between an American and a 'New Yorker', and while friends of all nationalities have traveled the States for years, my knowledge extends to a long summer in Maine when I was a child, where these memories still conjure up the scent of honeysuckle vines lingering in the warm air.But what about the State of Nebraska, as depicted by Alexander Payne, the director of this important movie with a brilliant cast starring Bruce Dern, and many others in a stellar performance? Mr. Payne was born in Nebraska by all accounts, and he takes the viewers on a journey that may be a memorable one for some of us in a myriad of ways. Filmed in black and white with stunning clarity, the opening begins with an old man, a derelict and vagabond by the looks of him, on a busy highway staggering painfully past the outskirts of the city of Billings in Montana with a mission in mind, and a young man by his side, his son David, attempting to stop and argue the point with him. It is not the first time that Woody, his father has tried to leave home in this way. He received via standard mail an embossed page of official-looking stationery addressed from Lincoln, Nebraska, announcing that he is the big prize winner of a $1 Million Sweepstakes Award, and the cash is just waiting for him to be collected. Elderly Woody is not taking any chances with this one and the mail delivery. He is on his way to Nebraska on foot, if necessary, to collect this sum with pride, and become a millionaire before his time runs out. He wants a new truck although he is no longer able to drive, and an air compressor which he lent to a close friend thirty years ago who never gave it back (later we run into this bully of a borrower and friend, and then further on to an ancient air compressor in a barn on another stop while driving slowly along on the country road).""Nebraska"" is a story about a family, but it is not a 'family movie'. It takes place today during these uncertain times, and it is a serious topic that is of interest to a few of us depending on our different roles, responsibilities and age in life, not only in Nebraska but everywhere, when sobering and difficult choices have to be made, as we or our parents may be reaching the end of the road in some way. The couple depicted here and born some time after WWI, Woody and Kate Grant have two sons Ross and David, the former considered somewhat of a success for being a newscaster on the local TV channel, the latter and younger one in a sludge job, where he is beginning to wonder whether he has any options left for a better life and is operating in a vacuous indecisive rut.Their father Woody has always been indifferent to them. He's one tough old bird, and while working on the treadmill of life with a heavy fortifying bottle in hand, he appears to have been distant from the concept of family, offspring and friends.  More in tune with nature, there is perhaps only one exception long ago, which leaves him looking briefly sad on recollection. Kate, their mother with a loud and foul mouth, is the strong feisty one here, and might be called by some of the viewers 'a piece of work', while never giving into feelings of surrender or defeat. She's had it however with her husband who was considered somewhat of a wild catch in his heyday, while her sons are arguing whether it is time to place their old man in a home for his own safety and their sanity. Although they are both sour about their father, David finally decides reluctantly to travel this last journey of unreality with his father, take a few days off from work to drive him to Nebraska to essentially look after his now helpless parent.As a choice of characters, this viewer's attention lay focused on how David, a mild-mannered if tenacious man in his early middle-years, was going to handle this trip: whether to mend bridges with his callous father who is sinking into senility, or simply as an act of good faith for himself in the end. Perhaps for both reasons as the case may be. And here they go on an adventure, taking them from one state to another, with a brief side visit to their relatives and acquaintances, whom they haven't seen in years and were most likely planning never to see again in the fictional town of Hawthorne, Nebraska.Kate, followed by her other son Ross, decides to join them at some point so that she is not left out of the party, and because ultimately she cares in her own unsentimental way about her family. Before they show up however, Mr. Woody Grant, to the exasperation and frustration of his son, has told everybody on the road to Nebraska that he is now a millionaire, and they in turn are all suitably impressed with glee in their eyes - a millionaire among their midst! Lots of congratulations and back-slapping are in order, followed by family meals, the appearance of lost best friends and neighbors, some old pals clamoring for past loans of various kinds, and Woody's inevitable bar-hopping to the only joint in the small poverty-stricken forsaken Hawthorne, where the healthiest past-time for senior men is pulling out a chair in front of one's house and watch the grass struggle to grow. As for the rest of the story in what is termed as a slow-paced movie, the time flew for this viewer and was pitch-perfect in so many ways. Others may have much more to add to Woody's quest, and determine whether there is in fact a conqueror of gold on this expedition to Nebraska.There is nothing maudlin in this portrait of realism, and the flavor of the picture is as real as home-made apple pie. It is stark, bleak and powerful in a quiet way. Darkly wry in its portrayal of the lifestyle and behavior of some of its characters, and as comical as life can be on occasion, this viewer and movie companion ducked at times in disbelief and some angst. The variety of expressions alone from the people depicted, along with their posture and stance, is enough to engender a stunned reaction of mixed mirth and sobriety. Not everybody is going to feel this way, of course, and may wish with validity that none of this is happening. They may start sitting up straighter in their seats, and look at the expansive view unraveling before them, with serious stony eyes.But on another note, the vision of space and wide-open skies in rural Nebraska is breath-taking in scope, and when Woody is revisiting his abandoned family home, looking silently at an immense barren field, it is not so much what he may be thinking, but what he is feeling at this poignant moment. And then there are some other tender moments to be found in this whole scenario of a brilliant movie that some of us may have experienced in both different and similar ways; some feelings that one can relate to, without feeling too uncomfortable in the process, and that give one cause to wonder.The audience here at first viewing? With few exceptions, it was a generous senior one on a week-day as we expected an empty theater at this time of year. When my friend and I stepped out into the lobby slightly subdued afterwards yet with a tinge of elation, a sighting of one of the most expensive stores in Manhattan hit us in the eye with a slight punch. 'Timely', I ventured quietly, thinking of the vast poverty we had just witnessed. 'Glad I didn't see it alone', my friend replied with a flinch in her voice, causing me to reflect as rarely unsettled, she has great strength of character and endurance. Then an elegant woman of a certain age turned to us with gentle wise eyes, raising a finger to her lips, and we joined her solemnly in reading the large movie placard on an easel describing Alexander Payne's ""Nebraska"" in more detail.Later, as we walked together in the brisk late winter afternoon, I asked my movie companion who has been traveling America for a living for nearly forty years: 'Is it really like that? When shall we go? How long would we last?', and as I listened to what she had to say and what she knew, I felt it was all true. 'Did you notice that Payne left out any sights of children, young people, or animals in his movie? Perhaps to keep our focus on this somewhat forgotten senior population? The younger generation is leaving our vast falcon prairies and coming to the big cities now', she added.But when I reached home, and from the little I read about Nebraska, it appears that the pulse of this homeland State is beginning to be one of the first to revive at a steadfast pace, and here I shall simply say to Mr. Payne in conclusion: 'Thank you for bringing the temperature of Nebraska to us in such a rich and rewarding way'. A difficult and sensitive masterpiece of his, one that this viewer intends to see again with even greater interest than the first time and with more in-depth understanding.'For my own Dark Rosaleen,

However, the storyline and the acting has been given great kudos by those who have seen the film. Filmed in black and white, it brings the melancholy and decay of Nebraska and the life of these characters to the forefront. The story of a man looking for something is told with great charm and many well placed words.Bruce Dern plays an aging man, Woody, with some senility probably due to his great alcohol consumption over the years. He sits at home and does nothing. His wife, Kate, played by June Squibb, is loud and proud and keeps no holes barred. She says it like it is, and often it is risqu&eacute; and pretty darn funny. Will Forte plays one son, David, who sells electronics in a store in town in Billings, Montana. Another son, Ross, played by Bob Odenkirk is a newsman on the local television station. Mom has run the family for years, Woody with his alcohol, an absent father it seems. Bruce is somehow taken in by a letter in the mail from a firm selling magazine subscriptions but promising a million dollars. Woody decides to go and fetch the money himself. Unable to drive since he lost his driving license, and his wife refuses to drive him, so he starts walking to Lincoln, Nebraska. David realizing Woody is not going to give up decides to drive him. David wants to get away from a relationship gone bad, and spending time with his dad will be good for both of them.The journey is heartwarming and sad at the same time. Will Forte has really shown his acting chops. June Squibb is a true character and deserves her supporting actress role, but it is Bruce Dern who shines. The old codger, not saying much, brain addled with alcohol, but wanting something for his family. Truly an endearing film, anyone who comes from a family will enjoy it.Recommended. prisrob 02-26-14",5,It's Complicated,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,1867,"['gem', 'film', 'been', 'overlooked', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'However', 'storyline', 'acting', 'been', 'given', 'great', 'kudos', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Filmed', 'black', 'white', 'melancholy', 'decay', 'Nebraska', 'life', 'characters', 'forefront', 'story', 'man', 'looking', 'something', 'told', 'great', 'charm', 'many', 'well', 'placed', 'words.Bruce', 'Dern', 'aging', 'man', 'Woody', 'senility', 'probably', 'due', 'great', 'alcohol', 'consumption', 'years', 'home', 'nothing', 'wife', 'Kate', 'played', 'June', 'Squibb', 'loud', 'proud', 'holes', 'barred', 'often', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'pretty', 'darn', 'funny', 'Will', 'Forte', 'plays', 'one', 'son', 'David', 'who', 'electronics', 'store', 'town', 'Billings', 'Montana', 'son', 'Ross', 'played', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'newsman', 'local', 'television', 'station', 'Mom', 'run', 'family', 'years', 'Woody', 'alcohol', 'absent', 'father', 'Bruce', 'somehow', 'taken', 'letter', 'mail', 'firm', 'selling', 'magazine', 'subscriptions', 'promising', 'million', 'dollars', 'Woody', 'go', 'fetch', 'money', 'Unable', 'drive', 'lost', 'driving', 'license', 'wife', 'drive', 'so', 'walking', 'Lincoln', 'Nebraska', 'David', 'realizing', 'Woody', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'up', 'decides', 'drive', 'David', 'get', 'away', 'relationship', 'gone', 'bad', 'spending', 'time', 'dad', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'them.The', 'journey', 'heartwarming', 'sad', 'same', 'time', 'Will', 'Forte', 'really', 'shown', 'acting', 'chops', 'June', 'Squibb', 'true', 'character', 'supporting', 'actress', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'who', 'old', 'codger', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'brain', 'addled', 'alcohol', 'wanting', 'something', 'family', 'Truly', 'endearing', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'family', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.Recommended', 'prisrob', '02-26-14']",N/A

The first disappointment was that is was shot in black and white.  I can understand the artistic choice, probably to show the bleakness of the characters' lives but the effect it had on me was that it just induced boredom.  Personally I find that area of the country very beautiful and I wish that the director had chosen to show us its beauty by filming in color.  It might have kept me watching longer than I did.A parallel criticism is the characterization of the locals.  It's been a while since I've driven through this area but I doubt very much that the people are as crude and ignorant as this film depicts them.  I recall hearing Garrison Keillor, a  great story teller from the upper Midwest, say, that one must always have affection for his characters.  I think Payne should have heeded that advice.  These people are shown to be amusing in a condescending way, the way perhaps that some people from both coasts like to think of Midwesterners.  I feel insulted for them.  Dern plays one note...the befuddled, stubborn, drunken old guy.  He does it well but after five minutes of it, it was tiresome. . And he's not likable.  Likewise, the hapless son.  We just don't care about them.  Since it's a road trip  we can  expect that all conflicts will be dissolved en route and a happy ending is in store.  I read from other reviewers that there is a sweet ending here but that wasn't a good enough reason for me to sit through the dreariness to get to it.. I quit about half way through..It was a good idea that could have made a genuinely touching film if it had been done more realistically, in a  less condescending tone.

Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 1]","This quirky dramedy filmed in black & white is lifted from what would probably have been a very good film with any lead, to outstanding due to the performance of Bruce Dern. Dern, who is 77 in real life, is Woody Grant, an old boozy coot in the beginning stages of dementia, who thinks he's won a million dollars in one of those magazine contests; and insists on traveling from his home in Montana to Nebraska to pick up his check. The rest of his family - his two sons and wife - try to keep him home and talk about putting him in a nursing home...but then his youngest son, David, played superbly by Will Forte, decides to take him to Lincoln to spend some quality time with him. In addition to Dern and Forte, look for a wonderful performance by June Squibb, as Woody's wife, Kate; and a good performance by Bob Odenkirk as David's older brother, Ross.

I find that European films are characteristically more complex, sensitive, and mature than the standard Hollywood fare. I think of ""In a Better World"" as one recent example. Nebraska, however, comes as an utterly refreshing (and admittedly surprising) Hollywood exception. Not only does it present a geographical picture of the American Midwest (for whatever that's worth), but(more importantly) it speaks volumes about current state of our society; a commentary on the degradation and emptiness of contemporary American life. The cousins who can't find work, and so just sit around. The semantic difference between sexual assault and rape. The idea that a hospital stay would cost more than a million dollars. The shallowness, selfishness and pettiness within relationships. The nearly dead main street, with for lease signs all over. The focus on TV (extend that to cellphones, iPads, etc), and media as the central distractor. The movie paints a tapestry in this way. It is a classic. No wonder some may see the movie as being depressing. It's all a mirrored reflection of devolving life in America. Sad, but true. At the same time that it does this so well, interestingly enough, it contains a message of hope through love expressed not merely in words, but in actions. So all the dark, real life commentary comes head to head with this love, and in the end love - unsurprisingly - comes out the winner. Beyond everything else, love never fails. It triumphs. Oh, and yes there are just so many funny moments in this movie. Funny in the sense of how the movie is spot on in capturing reality as it is in our contemporary life. The acting was great all around.

1687691,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00H9L26AA,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","This movie is my introduction to Alexander Payne and I am very impressed. With a simple story and homegrown, naturalistic performances from his actors, he created a movie that resonated with me in a strong way. NEBRASKA is about an old man, played by Bruce Dern, who gets one of those Publisher's Clearinghouse-type of letters in the mail and thinks he's won a million dollars. All he has to do is take the letter with him to Lincoln, Nebraska.  Eventually his son, played by Will Forte, decides to take him there in order to placate him. Along the way, he learns a lot about his family and grows closer with his father. Thematically, there's actually quite a bit going on beneath the surface. On one hand, you have subtle commentary on the illusory nature of the &#34;American dream&#34; but the film says more about finding a sense of purpose, self-worth and hope. And all of it is shown through the lens of small-town America. It wasn't anything profound, but it didn't need to be. It was simple, straightforward and did it in a very homey way. Speaking of &#34;homey.&#34; I thought the character work here was as strong as anything I've seen in years. It's like the actors weren't even acting. They just seemed that real to me, like these were people I could have known when I was growing up. They had such an authentic manner of speaking, and a lot of what they said was endearing and comical, in equal measure. Though the entire cast gives great performances, the standouts were Bruce Dern (who got a well-deserved win at Cannes last year), Will Forte and (to my surprise, although I didn't have any expectations going in) June Squibb as Woody's long-suffering wife. She was a very no-nonsense woman who was given some brilliantly acerbic dialogue. Will Forte also gave a performance I'd never have expected from him, given the comic persona he honed on Saturday Night Live. And Bruce Dern, as usual, gave an outstanding performance as a man who finds something to live for, even if it's just in his mind. It's like this movie was the real-life crowning achievement that his character hopes for in the film. As far as other aspects go, the movie was shot in black-and-white, an appropriate choice in my opinion. It, along with the conservative camerawork, gave the movie a stripped-down feel which helped to bring out the story and dialogue more, as opposed to the imagery (which still looked fantastic). This movie was also all shot on location, and there was great work there as well. I also loved the score, which had a down-home feel to it with the minimalist strings and guitar (banjo?). Had I seen this last year, I'm positive this would have been my pick for the best one. Still, it's great that I've finally seen it and I look forward to digging further into Alexander Payne's back catalog.

All in all I'd say we chose wisely.What you get out of this will depend at least in part on with whom you watch it.  In our case, the audience was filled with cackling older people who guffawed violently every time the main characters said something obnoxious or abusive to each other.  While I see the potential for humor here I was more saddened by the abuse than amused by it.  Your results will vary wildly.From a plot perspective this is a fairly standard offering.  The patriarch is a lost and lonely old man who has spent his life being abused by his wife and taken advantage of by his friends.  His wife is a acidic old crone who has very little nice to say about anyone, most so when it comes to her family.  The kids are detached and don't really understand what's going on and are themselves constantly the target of their mother's abuse.Most poignantly the movie is about small towns and the people in them.  Scenes depicting family get-togethers in which everyone sat on the couch and watched TV in silence were completely true because that was exactly what my family did growing up.  In this environment conversations between people getting together after years apart commonly consistent of:Person 1: What'r you up to?Person 2: Nothin' much.Person 1: Still workin'?Person 2: Yup.And so ends an entire evening of conversation.  This is brilliantly and accurately rendered in the movie.  Greed, jealousy, pettiness and gossip also play key roles in this film just as they do in the small towns on which the movie is based.In summary, this movie can be funny but it can also be a vast social lesson on what it means to live a life confined to a narrow and repetitious rut and what hope can do to the people in that situation.

1687700,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00H9L26AA,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Filmed in glorious black-and-white, Alexander Payne&#8216;s &#8220;Nebraska&#8221; captures the stark beauty of the American Midwest better than almost any movie I can remember. Set against the bleak backdrop of a high plains winter, it&#8217;s a &#8220;road picture&#8221; in which the characters travel through a seemingly unending expanse of lonely highways, leafless trees, peeling clapboard buildings and dusty, windswept streets in towns that haven&#8216;t changed all that much since the 1950s. Like a land frozen in time, it&#8217;s a place where the tales are tall, the fields are parched, and the accents as flat as the limitless terrain. Filtered through a dreamy half-light, the imagery turns spareness and homogeneity into art.The travelers in this case are the Grant family, formerly of Nebraska, now residents of Billings, Montana. Woody is the patriarch of the group who&#8217;s convinced that he&#8217;s won a million dollars in what everyone else acknowledges is nothing more than a marketing scam designed to rope in newspaper and magazine subscriptions. Woody, however, is dead-set on traveling to Lincoln to pick up his prize. As a means of both humoring him and getting him to shut up about it, his younger son, David, agrees to drive Woody to the state capital, stopping off to visit some of the relatives and old friends who still live in the town where the old man grew up, married and started a family. Eventually, David&#8217;s mom and older brother join them for the impromptu reunion that results from the visit.With an Oscar-nominated screenplay by Bob Nelson, &#8220;Nebraska&#8221; is extremely perceptive about the complex dynamics that make up parent/child relationships, especially when the parent is a cantankerous alcoholic who may just be slipping into early-stage dementia and the child a mild-mannered, dutiful adult who seems to be using his own parents&#8217; less-than-ideal marriage as an excuse to avoid taking the matrimonial plunge himself. Yet, for all the seeming dysfunction, in the end, &#8220;Nebraska&#8221; emerges as a moving tribute to the enduring bonds of family. For while David may have issues of his own with Woody - mainly resentment for his years of parental disinterest brought on by his alcoholism - he&#8217;ll be damned if he&#8217;s going to let anyone else make a mockery of him. What&#8217;s amazing is how much we see of ourselves reflected in these characters. Woody represents the elderly holding onto their last remaining shreds of dignity while bit by bit the ravages of time and aging take their toll. And even though David has entered that stage where the son must now become parent to the father, he&#8217;s determined to do so without robbing his old man of the dignity that each of us is entitled to when we come to the end of our road. Fortune or no fortune, this turns out to be a healing trip for both David and his dad, and who can put a price on that?The humor is as dry and unaffected as the setting, as the Grants voice their many concerns about the situation they find themselves in and each other. Plus, they have to contend with an assortment of ne&#8217;er-do-well relatives who sit around all day watching &#8220;Golden Girls&#8221; reruns and plotting how to get their hands on some of Woody&#8217;s &#8220;fortune.&#8221; Then there&#8217;s David&#8217;s mother, Kate, a sharp-tongued, long-suffering woman who&#8217;s put up with Woody&#8217;s petulant personality for just about as long as she can at this point. She&#8217;s clearly at the end of her rope with Woody, yet as with David, we sense that there is something holding the couple together, something we have trouble seeing yet are somehow made to feel. And that is as it should be with family.If the visuals were not so stunning, one might almost be tempted to label &#8220;Nebraska&#8221; an &#8220;actors&#8217; picture,&#8221; for rarely do we see performances of this caliber in a single film. As Woody, Bruce Dern injects an amazing pathos into his portrait of a man who may be slowly losing his grip on his memory, his vigor and his independence but who is determined to go down fighting, not allowing any outside naysayers and skeptics to rob him of his one final dream, quixotic though it may be. And who could have imagined that Will Forte, hitherto known for his cranked-up comic turns on &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; and &#8220;30 Rock,&#8220; was concealing such a gift for understated emotion and low-keyed humor? Forte provides the reasoned and reasonable center of gravity that such a tale needs to avoid spinning off into undisciplined absurdity or indulging in a too-knowing condescension. It&#8217;s a true breakthrough performance. And the marvelous June Squibb steals every scene she&#8217;s in as Woody&#8216;s lifelong bete noire, matching her husband dig for dig and barb for barb every step of the way. Each of these actors makes us care deeply for their characters inspiring us to laugh with rather than at them. There are also fine performances by  Stacy Keach and Bob Odenkirk, among others.And, saving the best for last, we must now genuflect before the brilliant Phedon Papamichael for his incomparable cinematography which sees to it that the image is every bit as important as every other element in the movie.So beautiful it almost hurts, &#8220;Nebraska&#8221; may be the most perfect blend of form and content we&#8217;ve come across in quite some time.",5,A work of art on many levels,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,5447,"['Filmed', 'glorious', 'black-and-white', 'Alexander', 'Payne', '8216',

1687724,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00H9L26AA,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","Director Alexander Payne ('The Descendants', 'Sideways') knocked this film out of the park with his ability to study human behavior.  Written by Bob Nelson who called it ""an act of desperation"", the astounding cast has a strength of character separately and collectively that is easy to see, but more so feel.  Some more than others, as they pulled at my heartstrings. As this film opens we see Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) walking down the side of the highway, hat on, coat wide open and a sign in the background showing a freezing 26 degrees.  Woody doesn't care, he has escaped the house unnoticed once again to gain his prize. He has stopped dreaming a long time ago, his life has essentially passed him by because of alcoholism which included years of just living and drinking.  A difficult man, He is walking to Lincoln Nebraska to claim what is his, and this man is overdetermined to get what is coming to him.  He believes he is a winner, a big winner having plans to buy a new truck and an air compressor, even though he doesn't have a drivers license.The film moves slowly and I was glad for that, I could take in every little delicious detail that was meant to be seen.  There are so very many.  Woody has been married for years to the abrasive and unbelievably unfiltered mouthy Kate (June Squibb).  The wife with the razor for a tongue that lashes Woody and lands on a deaf ear anymore.  They have two sons, Ross (Bob Odenkirk), who has a shorter part in the film and works as a Television Newscaster.  He agrees with his extremely opinionated mother to put his father in a ""home"".  The second younger and dutiful son, David (Will Forte), has a heart as big as Montana itself, which is where they live,  Billings to be exact. David decides he should take his father to Nebraska, I think to get to know him better, and also to get him away from his acerbic wife and his history of an alcohol-addled life.  Like he says to David, ""Beer ain't drinkin"" then wanders off into a bar on stops for fuel.Woody has many brothers and on the journey, he sees several of them.  These guys are extremely short on conversation which is part of the humor in this.  Any family get-togethers would put most people to sleep.  We also get to see many of the things that Woody has experienced in his life.  The film is nostalgic, a huge slice of Americana for me.  Some of the conversations that these two get into are classic, one in the bar was over the top as it ends with Woody leaving the bar to the tune of, ""You'd drink too if you were married to your mother"".  He does have a point there.  There are several higher points in this. The visit to the cemetery with the parents and David is priceless as Kate shines even though her commenting is nowhere near warm.  Meeting up with 'Peg Bender' also was an interesting conversation for David as he learns how important this woman was to his father.  She has much information that David never could have known of his father.  Peg is a lovely woman, very unlike his mother.  Another high point is when the family goes to see the home that Woody was born in. It brought a tear to my eye at one point feeling the sadness and viewing it through Woody's eyes.  There are also several scenes with his old business partner, Ed (Stacy Keach), who obviously is his nemesis.A very poignant part of the movie is when David has had enough of Ed ridiculing his father, this is also great to behold.  This son learns the whys of his father's ideas, and they are heartwarmingly unselfish.  Woody's motives are pure, and David has even more respect for his father after Woody telling him.  The ending of this movie is priceless and brought a loving father and son feeling to this story.  The sparkling soundtrack (Mark Orton) helps pull this story along, always underscoring and delightful.  The towns look as if they are just stuck in time, kind of like Woody's own life. A sometimes brutal, sometimes hilarious, but mainly a potent, stark, and honest theme for this very realistic movie.",5,"""He Just Believes Stuff People Tell Him"" - David Grant",1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,4014,"['Director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', ""'The"", 'Descendants', ""'Sideways"", 'knocked', 'film', 'park', 'ability', 'study', 'human', 'behavior', 'Written', 'Bob', 'Nelson', 'who', 'called', 'act', 'desperation', 'astounding', 'cast', 'strength', 'character', 'separately', 'collectively', 'easy', 'see', 'more', 'so', 'feel', 'more', 'others', 'pulled', 'heartstrings', 'film', 'see', 'Woody', 'Grant', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'walking', 'down', 'side', 'highway', 'hat', 'coat', 'wide', 'open', 'sign', 'background', 'showing', 'freezing', '26', 'degrees', 'Woody', ""n't"", 'care', 'escaped', 'house', 'unnoticed', 'once', 'again', 'gain', 'prize', 'stopped', 'dreaming', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'life', 'essentially', 'passed', 'alcoholism', 'included', 'years', 'just', 'living', 'drinking', 'difficult', 'man', 'walking', 'Lincoln', 'Nebraska', 'claim', 'what', 'man', 'overdetermined', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'winner', 'big', 'winner', 'having', 'plans', 'buy', 'new', 'truck', 'air', 'compressor', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'drivers', 'license.The', 'film', 'moves', 'slowly', 'was', 'glad', 'could', 'take', 'little', 'delicious', 'detail', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'are', 'so', 'very', 'many', 'Woody', 'been', 'married', 'years', 'abrasive', 'unbelievably', 'unfiltered', 'mouthy', 'Kate', 'June', 'Squibb', 'wife', 'razor', 'tongue', 'Woody', 'deaf', 'ear', 'anymore', 'have', 'two', 'sons', 'Ross', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'who', 'shorter', 'part', 'film', 'Television', 'Newscaster', 'extremely', 'opinionated', 'mother', 'put', 'father', 'home', 'second', 'younger', 'dutiful', 'son', 'David', 'Will', 'Forte', 'heart', 'as', 'big', 'Montana', 'where', 'live', 'Billings', 'be', 'exact', 'David', 'should', 'take', 'father', 'Nebraska', 'think', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'also', 'get', 'away', 'acerbic', 'wife', 'history', 'alcohol-addled', 'life', 'David', 'Beer', 'ai', ""n't"", 'drinkin', 'then', 'off', 'bar', 'stops', 'fuel.Woody', 'many', 'brothers', 'journey', 'several', 'guys', 'are', 'extremely', 'short', 'conversation', 'part', 'humor', 'family', 'get-togethers', 'would', 'put', 'most', 'people', 'sleep', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'things', 'Woody', 'experienced', 'life', 'film', 'nostalgic', 'huge', 'slice', 'Americana', 'conversations', 'two', 'get', 'are', 'classic', 'one', 'bar', 'was', 'top', 'Woody', 'leaving', 'bar', 'tune', ""'d"", 'drink', 'too', 'were', 'married', 'mother', 'have', 'point', 'there', 'are', 'several', 'higher', 'points', 'visit', 'cemetery', 'parents', 'David', 'priceless', 'Kate', 'shines', 'even', 'commenting', 'nowhere', 'near', 'warm', 'Meeting', 'up', ""'Peg"", 'Bender', 'also', 'was', 'interesting', 'conversation', 'David', 'how', 'important', 'woman', 'was', 'father', 'much', 'information', 'David', 'never', 'could', 'have', 'known', 'father', 'Peg', 'lovely', 'woman', 'very', 'mother', 'high', 'point', 'when', 'family', 'see', 'home', 'Woody', 'was', 'born', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'one', 'point', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'viewing', 'Woody', 'eyes', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'scenes', 'old', 'business', 'partner', 'Ed', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'who', 'obviously', 'nemesis.A', 'very', 'poignant', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'David', 'had', 'Ed', 'ridiculing', 'father', 'also', 'great', 'behold', 'son', 'whys', 'father', 'ideas', 'are', 'heartwarmingly', 'unselfish', 'Woody', 'motives', 'are', 'pure', 'David', 'even', 'more', 'respect', 'father', 'Woody', 'telling', 'ending', 'movie', 'priceless', 'brought', 'loving', 'father', 'son', 'feeling', 'story', 'sparkling', 'soundtrack', 'Mark', 'Orton', 'pull', 'story', 'along', 'always', 'underscoring', 'delightful', 'towns', 'look', 'are', 'just', 'stuck', 'time', 'kind', 'Woody', 'own', 'life', 'sometimes', 'brutal', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'mainly', 'potent', 'stark', 'honest', 'theme', 'very', 'realistic', 'movie']",N/A

1687732,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00H9L26AA,Stanley Crowe,"[1, 2]","Black and white cinematography seems just right for the high flatlands of the Dakotas, Montana, and Nebraska, and I think that what I'll remember most clearly about this movie are the spare images of the land, which Alexander Payne makes sure we see in a variety of lights and times of day.  The sense of impermanence in the small towns that are passed through, and in the images of the aging people, suggest that everything changes and yet nothing does.  The land looks as it must have looked when Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) was a boy, probably around 1930 and how it looked when he came back from the Korean War to a choice between farming and being a mechanic. Now, at around 80, Woody is an alcoholic in the early stages of dementia, and he believes that a flier he has received in the mail means that he has won a million dollars, refusing to believe that the flier doesn't promise the million but only a chance at it (if the number on the flier is a winner).  His son Bobby (Will Forte), in an unsatisfying job and a problematic relationship, decides to humor his dad by driving him from their home in Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska to pick up the money.It's not easy to say where the power of this movie resides.  Bruce Dern gives a totally convincing performance as a stubborn, failing old man, but the movie can hardly be said to be a character study, for Woody is beyond development or self-expression.  Always a man of few words (we're told by other characters), he has fewer now that he is failing.  There's pathos in this, and there's a sense of how difficult it must be to live with and care for such a person.  Woody's wife, Kate (June Squibb), has a point when she asks her son who is concerned about his father, ""What about me?""  It's a poignant question, since Woody doesn't seem to have played a very active part in his sons' growing up.  Kate is tough and blunt, and we can see that these qualities are carrying her through a difficult time -- and (we get hints in the movie) there have been earlier difficult times.  Squibb gives a vivid performance here, though the character as conceived by the script verges on the tough matriarch stereotype.  And there's the family comedy dimension of the movie -- on their way to Lincoln, Woody and Bobby visit his brother and his family (whose two thuggish sons form perhaps a too-convenient comic contrast with Bobby) in the little town where they all grew up.  The word gets around the more extended family and the townsfolk that Woody is really a millionaire -- and all sorts of people come out of the woodwork claiming a share of Woody's good fortune because of what they claim they did for him way back when.  The focus of that theme comes to a head in a confrontation with Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), Woody's old partner in an auto-mechanic business.  Ed reckons Woody owes him around 20 grand.  Woody reckons that Ed owes him a compressor that he stole.  Heaven only knows the truth of matter, but Ed is one mean dude, and he gets a kind of comeuppance.So . . . all of these strands are engaging, and yet the movie seems to add up to a bit more.  For me, it was focused in a conversation that Bobby has with Peggy Nagy, the editor/owner of the local paper and (Bobby learns) an old flame of Woody's who was beaten out by Kate because she (Peggy) ""wouldn't let Woody touch all the bases.""  The implication is that Kate would, and did.  Bobby asks Peggy if, back then, his father drank too much, and Peggy says that of course he did.  Out here, she says, ""there wasn't much else to do.""  The movie, especially in its visual dimension, gives Peggy's statement the ring of truth.  The land seems both beautiful and remote from human concerns.  The towns are small, and the aging people we see, like Woody's brothers and old acquaintances have nothing to talk about.  What, we wonder, did their life-experiences amount to?  And Woody's taciturn nature begins to seem less an idiosyncrasy and more a matter of the accident of his being born and living in the part of the country that he did.  We wonder if Kate, a city girl by her own admission (whatever that means in Nebraska), might have seemed at some point to offer something more -- but in fact she didn't, and now Kate is beaten down too, and Bobby has no clear grip on a future for himself.  The image of ""success"" in the movie is Bobby's brother, Ross (Bob Odenkirk), a news anchor at a small TV station in Billings.  Bobby himself works selling audio and video equipment . . . but it doesn't seem to mean much to him.So it's both ironic and pathetically apt that Bobby is drawn to his father's clear goal -- to go to Lincoln, get that million dollars, and buy himself a truck (even though he doesn't drive any more).  Just the idea that the old man's life has purpose must be, at least in part, what drives Bobby to take his dad to Lincoln.  And, without giving too much away, the trip is both a failure and a success.  What that amounts to for Bobby's future isn't clear, though.  What will change for him back in Billings?  Will he, as his mother fears, end up like his father -- cranky and old, with a life that has nothing to show for it, still stuck in a beautifully desolate landscape into which he will disappear.  The scenes of a visit to the cemetery in Woody's old home town and to Woody's childhood home (now empty and deserted) are high moments in this movie, and they offer no consolation.  There is some human tenderness, but it isn't sentimentally inflated, and its effects are likely to be short-lived at best.This is well worth seeing, though -- much better, I think, than Payne's ""The Descendants.""  The way it connects age to place is very effectively done, and the performances, large and small, couldn't be better.",5,beautiful and desolate,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,5760,"['Black', 'white',

I don't think it's a &#34;best picture,&#34; but I am glad I saw it. Of all of this year's best picture nominees, it is probably the one that will linger the longest in my mind despite it's very subdued quality as a movie.And it is subdued. Slow moving. And black-and-white, which adds to the subdued quality. I've been trying to figure out what the movie would be like in color, and I can't really imagine it that way. Color would change the tone of the movie, which is kind of weird to me, but I think it would. It would make it not quite so somber, and it needs the somberness, the sense of depression and desperation, to make it work.Being black and white, though, it won't appeal to a lot of people (my daughter (and, yeah, she's just a kid, but I've known plenty of adults with the same attitude) refuses to watch b&w; movies out of principle. The fact that it's slow, including scenes of people just sitting around not talking, will also make it unappealing to pretty sizable chunk of people. But some of those scenes of people just sitting, or sitting and watching football, reminded me of being a kid in East Texas, and those scenes really resonated with me which has caused me to continue to think about it even though it's not at all spectacular.The other part of that is that the movie is not what it's about. On the surface it's a movie about an old guy that seems not quite all there trying to walk to Nebraska to pick up $1,000,000 that he thinks he's won, but it's not about that. I mean, it's not about growing old and losing your grasp on reality. It's about relationships and how we don't always know people as well as we think we do, even when those people are our parents.The acting was great. I'm not sure Bruce Dern deserves the best actor nomination, but he was very good. He really sold the depression and desperation. Okay, maybe he does deserve the nomination. The role is so... normal; it makes it hard to tell. Will Forte was even better as his younger son, David. He brought the helplessness and exasperation to the role. They were great together. And Forte was also great with Bob Odenkirk who played his older brother. They had great chemistry. June Squib was frightening and hilarious as Woody's wife.I'm going to hold myself back, at this point, and not talk about the relationships and family dynamics, because it would require all kinds of spoilers, and I think this is the kind of movie that each person should come to on his/her own, so to speak. It probably has something different to say to any given person based on what that person is bringing into it, like my resonance with the old men in my family sitting around, mostly silently, watching football.This one probably won't appeal to a lot of people at the outset. There are no explosions, no gunfights, and no car chases. But, if you let yourself get pulled along, I think it's one you'll find yourself pondering at odd moments for weeks (or at least days) after you see it.",4,Let Yourself Get Pulled Along (and steal an air compressor),1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,3108,"['Nebraska', 'movies', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'gone', 'see', 'probably', 'even', 'rented', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '34', 'best', 'picture', '34', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'year', 'best', 'picture', 'nominees', 'probably', 'one', 'will', 'linger', 'longest', 'mind', 'very', 'subdued', 'quality', 'movie.And', 'subdued', 'Slow', 'moving', 'black-and-white', 'subdued', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'color', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'imagine', 'way', 'Color', 'would', 'change', 'tone', 'movie', 'kind', 'weird', 'think', 'would', 'would', 'make', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'somber', 'somberness', 'sense', 'depression', 'desperation', 'make', 'work.Being', 'black', 'white', 'though', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'lot', 'people', 'daughter', 'yeah', 'just', 'kid', ""'ve"", 'known', 'plenty', 'adults', 'same', 'attitude', 'watch', 'b', 'w', 'movies', 'principle', 'fact', 'slow', 'including', 'scenes', 'people', 'just', 'sitting', 'not', 'talking', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'unappealing', 'pretty', 'sizable', 'chunk', 'people', 'scenes', 'people', 'just', 'sitting', 'sitting', 'watching', 'football', 'reminded', 'being', 'kid', 'East', 'Texas', 'scenes', 'really', 'resonated', 'caused', 'continue', 'think', 'even', 'not', 'spectacular.The', 'other', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'about', 'surface', 'movie', 'old', 'guy', 'not', 'quite', 'all', 'there', 'trying', 'walk', 'Nebraska', 'pick', 'up', '1,000,000', 'won', 'not', 'mean', 'not', 'growing', 'old', 'losing', 'grasp', 'reality', 'relationships', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'do', 'even', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'parents.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'best', 'actor', 'nomination', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'sold', 'depression', 'desperation', 'Okay', 'maybe', 'deserve', 'nomination', 'role', 'so', 'normal', 'hard', 'tell', 'Will', 'Forte', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'younger', 'son', 'David', 'brought', 'helplessness', 'exasperation', 'role', 'were', 'great', 'together', 'Forte', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'who', 'played', 'older', 'brother', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'June', 'Squib', 'was', 'frightening', 'hilarious', 'Woody', 'wife.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'hold', 'back', 'point', 'not', 'talk', 'relationships', 'family', 'dynamics', 'would', 'require', 'kinds', 'spoilers', 'think', 'kind', 'movie', 'person', 'should', 'come', 'own', 'so', 'speak', 'probably', 'something', 'different', 'say', 'given', 'person', 'based', 'what', 'person', 'bringing', 'resonance', 'old', 'men', 'family', 'sitting', 'around', 'mostly', 'silently', 'watching', 'football.This', 'one', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'lot', 'people', 'outset', 'are', 'explosions', 'gunfights', 'car', 'let', 'get', 'pulled', 'along', 'think', 'one', ""'ll"", 'find', 'pondering', 'odd', 'moments', 'weeks', 'least', 'days', 'see']",N/A

He is slightly senile and believes he has won the Clearinghouse Sweepstakes. He wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska personally to claim his prize. In order to humor him, his son David (Will Forte) disrupts his own life to drive him to Lincoln. They pass through Hawthorne, Woody's old home town to meet his brother. The rest of the family shows up as do old friends. David ends up learning more about his family history than he really wanted to know.Filmed in black and white, the film takes on the air of the past and of despair. Much of the humor consists of laughing at senility and David's disgust with the truth. The film isn't really funny or gritty. You wade through scenes that show local flavor such as a bunch of old men sitting quietly in front of a TV watching football, occasionally talking about a 1979 Buick. Oh yea.

1687758,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00H9L26AA,The People's Critic,"[0, 0]","Director Alexander Payne&#8217;s film projects, while wildly different, do share the common bond of using a sort of journey to humorously examine some variety of decay in the American fabric.  His filmography includes Citizen Ruth, Election, About Schmidt, Sideways, The Descendants, and most recently Nebraska, all of which are a variation of a similar theme.  Nebraska is perhaps his most moody entry.Nebraska is the story of an aging, somewhat alcoholic father who vows to collect a $1 million prize for a sweepstakes he believes he has won.  Bruce Dern puts forth an Oscar nominated performance as the father, Woody Grant, who after countless efforts to make the trek from Minnesota to Lincoln, Nebraska on foot is joined by his estranged son, David (Will Forte).  Woody and David&#8217;s journey allow Payne to examine physical, mental, and social decay while still maintaining the satirical humor for which his films have come to be known.  Filmed in gloomy black and white, Nebraska feels like what Fargo would have been like if you took out all of the murder and kidnapping.  What is left is a cast of wacky Midwesterners who dream of sudden fortune.  Woody has grown feeble and borderline delusional.  His relationship with his son David is virtually non-existent, but David takes this outlandish opportunity to see if there is a way to develop some sort of bond.Their journey is a fragmented one.  After Woody trips and falls in a hotel room, they are sidelined for a few days in the small town in Nebraska where Woody grew up.  It is here where the bulk of the movie takes place.  Soon Woody and David are joined by Woody&#8217;s wife, Kate (June Squibb) and other son Ross (Bob Odenkirk).  Nostalgia abounds as David becomes immersed with family and friends of Woody&#8217;s who he has not seen since he was a child.As news of Woody&#8217;s supposed wealth reaches the ears of the sleepy Nebraska town, Woody becomes the man of the hour, and David begins to learn things about his father&#8217;s past that help him understand a father he&#8217;s never really understood.  Payne also spins his web of deadpan humor to take the film beyond a simple father-son story, making some thoughtful observations about old age, mental and physical decline, and family.Overall, Nebraska is Payne&#8217;s most simplistic and laid back film.  However, it is moody, touching, and very well acted.  While Dern receives most of the accolades, Forte is the unsung hero of this film.  The Saturday Night Live vet&#8217;s first dramatic turn is excellent, and he is the perfect foil to Dern&#8217;s cryptic and obsessive personality.  In addition, Squibb is outstanding as Woody&#8217;s long-suffering but clearly loving wife Kate.  Also nominated for an Oscar, Squibb&#8217;s performance is the most successful source of humor throughout the film.  In a very revealing &#8220;family-reunion&#8221; scene, Squibb has the audience roaring with laughter after a few choice and well-deserved expletives aimed at some greedy family members.Nebraska is a small movie with relatively small ambitions.  At the heart of the film is David and Woody&#8217;s quest for acceptance, albeit in very different ways, and it is relatively successful.  While no masterpiece, this is a fine entry for Payne and a great collection of performances.

All the performances are superb. Dern is wonderful and is immersed in the role of Woody. June Squibb adds some welcome acerbic humor to the proceedings. And who would have thought an SLN regular could deliver such depth of character (Will Forte as his son David)? (No offense to SNL, it is more like 'where did this guy come from'? The performance is understated and brilliant).The cinematography is gorgeous and shooting in B&W; fits the film like a glove. I cannot imagine this film in color. The editing is tight - there is not a wasted frame.On one level it does not seem that a lot really &#34;happens&#34;. There is a lot of dialog yet it is minimal. Not much is actually said. Then you step back and realize that a lot happened, and there was a great depth of meaning and understanding present in the sparse dialog. (The film deserves to be seen twice to fully appreciate its depth). In many scenes a lot is communicated by the subtlest change of expression or body language. It kind of reminds me of Terence Malick's early films, but without the flights of cinematic fancy a la Days of Heaven.There is a scene which shows the family in the living room pretty much just sitting and watching TV. It is a framed shot looking at the family from the TV. I thought of an old song called Little Pink Houses with the lyric &#34;...this is America&#34;. Because that scene is America. Nothing exciting going on there, but very profound it's &#34;realness&#34;. This film taps far into the heart of the heartland. The not dysfunctional but far from perfect family dynamics. Woody's unwavering chase of his dream - which we know is not only unrealistic but ridiculously unattainable. His son David's exasperation with the old man but loving commitment to his quest and his understanding of dementia and it's effects.  The cutting wit and humor of his wife Kate, who still, how can I say it, &#34;steps to the plate&#34; for Woody.As the film moves along much indeed happens, but I kept wondering how it would end. Between his drinking and dementia, I came away with the sense that Woody truly believes he own the prize. But a scene near the end (which involves Stacy Keech) seems to break through for him and I think he realizes his folly. There is not a million dollars to be had. And I so hoped it would not end there - could not end there. And it didn't.All I will say is that in the final scenes, David, at least for a few precious moments, is able to give Woody the dignity he had lost. He gives him the realization of a far more important dream than a million dollars. Woody, maybe for the last time (?), feels alive again. Bittersweet is an understatement.

In &#8220;Nebraska&#8221; you are going to take a journey with David, who learns, if not completely, things about his headstrong father, and by the time you finish watching the film, you will be seeing him in a different way.The beautifully shot film (the atmospheric black-and-white photography by Phedon Papamichael) is funny and poignant at the same time.",4,Low-Key Drama from the Director of &#8220;Sideways&#8221;,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,1333,"['Directed', 'Alexander', 'Payne', '8220', 'Sideways', '8221', '8220', 'Nebraska', '8221', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'various', 'ways', 'road', 'movie', 'drama', 'dysfunctional', 'father', 'son', 'relationship', 'character', 'study', 'offbeat', 'comedy', 'very', 'offbeat', 'one', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'film', 'distinctive', 'touch', 'film', '8217', 'sad', 'comic', 'moments', 'so', 'real.The', 'simple', 'story', 'Woody', 'Grant', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'who', '750', 'miles', 'Montana', 'Nebraska', 'claim', '1', 'million', 'sweepstakes', 'prize', 'son', 'David', 'Will', 'Forte', 'who', '8220', 'prize', '8221', 'not', 'real', 'way', 'Woody', 'hometown', 'fictional', '34', 'Hawthorne', '34', 'rumors', 'spread', 'Woody', '8217', 'money.Probably', 'Alexander', 'Payne', '8217', 'films', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'are', 'often', 'slow-moving', 'deliver', 'pathos', 'comedy', 'subtle', 'unexpected', 'way', '8220', 'Nebraska', '8221', 'exception', 'please', 'take', 'time', 'be', 'patient', '8220', 'Nebraska', '8221', 'are', 'going', 'take', 'journey', 'David', 'who', 'not', 'completely', 'things', 'headstrong', 'father', 'time', 'finish', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'different', 'way.The', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'film', 'atmospheric', 'black-and-white', 'photography', 'Phedon', 'Papamichael', 'funny', 'poignant', 'same', 'time']",N/A
1687767,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00H9L26AA,Turfseer,"[10, 29]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***RATING: 2.5 out of 5.0If you are a lover of 'quirk', then you will enjoy 'Nebraska', the latest from the master of quirk himself, director Alexander Payne. Understand that there is a formula to quirky movies. The protagonists are always quirky themselves, with some glaring faults, but in the end quite sympathetic and lovable. That applies to Nebraska's main character, Woody Grant (solidly played by the veteran actor, Bruce Dern). Woody has numerous faults, principally that he's a curmudgeon and an alcoholic.Woody may be suffering from a touch of early onset dementia when a police officer finds him walking on the side of a highway, mumbling how he's determined to trek all the way to Nebraska on foot, in order to claim a $1 million Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes notice he received in the mail. Woody's son David (played by comedian Will Forte, in a straight guy role), wants to prevent additional ill-fated wanderings, so he agrees to drive his father from their home in Billings, Montana, all the way to sweepstakes headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska. For me, Woody seems simply an irascible and stubborn curmudgeon, rather than an Alzheimer's victim, so I had trouble believing that he would actually believe that he was a sweepstakes winner.Once you accept the unlikely premise, it's not hard to believe what happens next. Basically Woody and David get waylaid after Woody goes on a bender, trips and falls (resulting in a gash on his head that requires stitches at the hospital) and then loses his dentures, forcing the hapless pair to back track to a railway yard where, after a short search, recover the old man's false teeth. With the day shot, David convinces Woody to go to his father's old haunting grounds in the town of 'Hawthorne', where they visit Woody's brother.At this point, the second half of the definition of the 'quirky movie' can be explained. The 'antagonists' who comprise these 'quirkfests' are not only 'quirky', but nasty too. Sometimes these characters are outright caricatures (such as the 'twins' who end up assaulting David, to get their hands on Woody's sweepstakes notice); or perhaps they're more nuanced like Ed (played by the other veteran in this picture, Stacy Keach). No matter how fine Payne manages to draw his antagonists, he can't escape accusations that he looks down on them.Payne's air of condescension has not gone unnoticed by a gaggle of professional film critics. Here are a few examples: A.A. Dowd (The A.V. Club): ""It's when Nebraska veers off the road, and into the one-horse town David grew up in, that condescending comedy begins to take precedence.""; Jessica Kiang (The Playlist): ""...the rounding out of Woody's character and back-story happens largely at the expense of the local citizens, relatives and townspeople -- in trying to make us understand Woody, Payne kind of makes us despise almost everyone else, notably the film's ""villain"" Ed (the terrific Stacy Keach). There is a troubling air of condescension in the portrayal of a lot of these folks as either venal and grasping, or just plain stupid. ''; Lou Lumenick (NY Post): Bob Nelson's original script, a sort of unlikely cross between ""The Last Picture Show'' and ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,'' offers a biting satire of Midwestern life that Payne sometimes allows to border on condescension.''Payne depicts Woody's old friends and relatives in the old town all managing to take the low road, whether it involves hypnotically staring at a Sunday football game on TV en masse, some cheesy karaoke warbling and being stupid enough not to ask a few questions that would confirm that Woody did not win the $1 million. Things get even more ugly when the old friends start trying to hit Woody up for a piece of the sweepstakes winnings, claiming he borrowed money from them in the past. Fortunately for Woody, his equally curmudgeonly and foul-mouthed wife, Kate, intervenes, preventing the townspeople from inflicting further physical damage on her husband and sons.If there's anything redeeming about 'Nebraska', it's in the depiction of the bonding between father and son. David's gracious gift to Woody (in the form of a pickup truck trade-in), allows Woody to get in one last dig, at his unpleasant former friends.'Nebraska' also benefits greatly from some gorgeous black and white cinematography which highlight the bleak but haunting Midwest landscapes. The acting here is quite good as the cast seem like they're straight out of the artist Grant Wood's masterpiece, 'American Gothic'. What's missing here is Payne's ability to sympathize with the crowd he's determined to criticize. For him, everything is 'black and white'; I say better to draw both your good guys and bad guys, in more nuanced 'shades of gray'.",2,"Master of Quirk Cinema Payne, still unable to jettison

It seemed like it would be drab and depressing but this character driven drama resonated with me perhaps because I had dealt with some of the issues faced by the two sons when dealing with their senior father Woody. &#34;Nebraska&#34; may lack explosions, a high concept premise (all good things in this case) but still manages to be involving if you give the film a chance.SPOILERS:Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) has received one of those letters that indicates he's won a million dollars. Woody takes this bit of junk mail seriously. His son David (Will Forte) decides to take his father to &#34;collect&#34; his million dollars driving him from Billings, Montana to Lincoln Nebraska hoping that it will bring his father back to reality when he realizes he hasn't won anything at all.David and Woody learn quite a bit about each other in the process and, when David's brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) and their mom (June Squibb) this road trip reminds them why they are important to each other even when they can't stand each other some of the time.END OF SPOILERS:Director Alexander Payne's decision to do the film in black and white is quite daring; the film strips the images to the bone portraying the often bleak landscape as reflections of the lost hope of Woody and his strained relationship with his sons who feel he needs to be in a home.Bruce Dern and June Squbb both received deserved Oscar nominations for their performances but I can't neglect the marvelous performances of two comedians Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk who continue to demonstrate their skills as actors giving strong support. Stacey Keach gives a marvelous supporting performance as well as Woody's former partner in his auto repair business who still has a grudge against him.Unlike some reviewers here, I feel that &#34;Nebraska&#34; does have a moment of redemption at the conclusion of the film.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a crisp, sharp looking presentation. Director of photography Phedon Papamichael focuses on textures since colors aren't an option here and those textures are nicely rendered.The audio is, not surprisingly, almost as black and white focusing on textures as the visuals with a sharp sounding 3.0 presentation. Dialgo is, naturally, front and center and, while directional sounds are as sparse as the images at times, the 3.0 presentation does highlight the score by Matt Orton.The only special feature is a nearly 30 minute documentary on the making of the movie. It covers everything from the inspiration for writer Bob Nelson to the cast and their experience working with director Payne. We also get itunes and Ultraviolet codes for the film.I do wish we had a commentary track from Payne or, at least, the writer and/or cast but the documentary on the making of the film is pretty darn good.",4,"Character driven drama touching with humor on the difficulty in dealing with elderly parents, unfilled dreams",1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,2835,"['thought', 'would', 'hate', '34', 'Nebraska', '34', 'seemed', 'would', 'be', 'drab', 'depressing', 'character', 'driven', 'drama', 'resonated', 'perhaps', 'had', 'dealt', 'issues', 'faced', 'two', 'sons', 'when', 'dealing', 'senior', 'father', 'Woody', '34', 'Nebraska', '34', 'may', 'lack', 'explosions', 'high', 'concept', 'premise', 'good', 'things', 'case', 'still', 'be', 'involving', 'give', 'film', 'chance.SPOILERS', 'Woody', 'Grant', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'received', 'one', 'letters', 'won', 'million', 'dollars', 'Woody', 'bit', 'junk', 'mail', 'seriously', 'son', 'David', 'Will', 'Forte', 'take', 'father', '34', 'collect', '34', 'million', 'dollars', 'driving', 'Billings', 'Montana', 'Lincoln', 'Nebraska', 'hoping', 'will', 'bring', 'father', 'back', 'reality', 'when', ""n't"", 'won', 'anything', 'all.David', 'Woody', 'learn', 'quite', 'bit', 'other', 'process', 'when', 'David', 'brother', 'Ross', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'mom', 'June', 'Squibb', 'road', 'trip', 'why', 'are', 'important', 'other', 'even', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'time.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Director', 'Alexander', 'Payne', 'decision', 'do', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'quite', 'daring', 'film', 'images', 'bone', 'portraying', 'often', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'reflections', 'lost', 'hope', 'Woody', 'strained', 'relationship', 'sons', 'who', 'feel', 'be', 'home.Bruce', 'Dern', 'June', 'Squbb', 'received', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'performances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'neglect', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'two', 'comedians', 'Will', 'Forte', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'who', 'continue', 'demonstrate', 'skills', 'actors', 'giving', 'strong', 'support', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'marvelous', 'supporting', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Woody', 'former', 'partner', 'auto', 'repair', 'business', 'who', 'still', 'grudge', 'him.Unlike', 'reviewers', 'here', 'feel', '34', 'Nebraska', '34', 'have', 'moment', 'redemption', 'conclusion', 'film.The', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'crisp', 'sharp', 'looking', 'presentation', 'Director', 'photography', 'Phedon', 'Papamichael', 'textures', 'colors', 'are', ""n't"", 'option', 'here', 'textures', 'are', 'nicely', 'rendered.The', 'audio', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'almost', 'black', 'white', 'focusing', 'textures', 'visuals', 'sharp', 'sounding', '3.0', 'presentation', 'Dialgo', 'naturally', 'front', 'center', 'directional', 'sounds', 'are', 'as', 'sparse', 'images', 'times', '3.0', 'presentation', 'highlight', 'score', 'Matt', 'Orton.The', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'nearly', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'movie', 'everything', 'inspiration', 'writer', 'Bob', 'Nelson', 'cast', 'experience', 'working', 'director', 'Payne', 'also', 'get', 'itunes', 'Ultraviolet', 'codes', 'film.I', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'commentary', 'track', 'Payne', 'least', 'writer', 'and/or', 'cast', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good']",N/A

Gone are our abilities to hold our urine, fecal matter, and the drool most  excellent today, surely,  a sign of robust health. That is why drug stores and supermarkets have a wide array ofadult diapers. Life is good if you are exceptionally rich.Nebraska is a movie down the highway of death with the everyday dullard and mundane as sign posts. Black & whitephotography makes the motion picture even more barren and empty. The aged live a pitiful and pathetic existence.Surely death is a respite. There was some humor but not enough to hold off the Grim Reaper or the desire to do soThe movie is pathetic and pitiful and does life well. It is a lot tedious for sure. I nodded off. The authorities houndingme to death 24/7 mentioned that half the audience is asleep. I believed it.If you want to see what your life will hold for you in your 70s-see it.Me, I am 69 to be 70 in May next. I took a foot scooter to see this boring masterpiece from over 2 miles away from the cinema, Lincoln Plaza Cinema, NYC. Used a bend bar for 100 reps before entering the theater that was airing Nebraska.Nebraska is depressing, honest, plotting and dull.
