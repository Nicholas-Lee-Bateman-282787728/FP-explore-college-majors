I hope they put Prometheus and the First, both two-part episodes, they were some of my favorites.I grewup watching the hulk and met Bixby and Ferrigno, at different times, when they were passing through Wyoming. Bixby, I met in 1977-78 after the first 1/2 season of the Hulk, I was only 14-16 years old. He was heading up to Yellowstone Park with his son. He was a great actor, and director, I can seriously say he would never be typecasts from the show. He was very talented, directing episodes of Blossom, Goodnight Beantown, The Woman who loved Elvis and episodes of Mr. Merlin.Ferrigno I met when he was a guest poser in the Mr. Wyoming contest. He was on the comeback trail after being retired from competitive bodybuilding for some 17 years. He weighted in at 310 pounds and looked great for being in his 40s.The Hulk series will always be my favorite, there was never a show like it before on television, or since.",5,Worth the Wait,1054598400,"06 3, 2003",2003,992,"['thought', 'was', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'hulk', 'series', 'DVD', 'hope', 'put', 'Prometheus', 'First', 'two-part', 'episodes', 'were', 'favorites.I', 'grewup', 'watching', 'hulk', 'met', 'Bixby', 'Ferrigno', 'different', 'times', 'when', 'were', 'passing', 'Wyoming', 'Bixby', 'met', '1977-78', 'first', '1/2', 'season', 'Hulk', 'was', 'only', '14-16', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'heading', 'up', 'Yellowstone', 'Park', 'son', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'director', 'can', 'seriously', 'say', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'typecasts', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'talented', 'directing', 'episodes', 'Blossom', 'Goodnight', 'Beantown', 'Woman', 'who', 'loved', 'Elvis', 'episodes', 'Mr.', 'Merlin.Ferrigno', 'met', 'when', 'was', 'guest', 'poser', 'Mr.', 'Wyoming', 'contest', 'was', 'comeback', 'trail', 'being', 'retired', 'competitive', 'bodybuilding', '17', 'years', 'weighted', '310', 'pounds', 'looked', 'great', 'being', '40s.The', 'Hulk', 'series', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'was', 'never', 'show', 'television']",The Incredible Hulk: Original Television Series Premiere

Stallings ""ebonydiva""","[2, 2]",I have been patiently waiting for nearly a year for them to pay some homage and props to the tv show (to coincide with the movie in Jun).  I grew up being scared out of my wits as a kid of the Hulk when I regularly watched the show and the reruns that came on (which is were I saw a majority of the episodes). I am glad they are planning on releasing the pilot and a reg two parter episode on DVD.  I can't wait to get this DVD and I do hope they plan on putting some future episodes on DVD or perhaps putting Season 1 or Season 2 on a future DVD release.,4,TV HULK FANS ARE HAPPY-FINALLY!!,1053216000,"05 18, 2003",2003,555,"['have', 'been', 'patiently', 'waiting', 'nearly', 'year', 'pay', 'homage', 'props', 'tv', 'show', 'coincide', 'movie', 'Jun', 'grew', 'up', 'being', 'scared', 'wits', 'kid', 'Hulk', 'when', 'regularly', 'watched', 'show', 'reruns', 'came', 'were', 'saw', 'majority', 'episodes', 'am', 'glad', 'are', 'planning', 'releasing', 'pilot', 'reg', 'two', 'parter', 'episode', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'DVD', 'do', 'hope', 'plan', 'putting', 'future', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'putting', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2', 'future', 'DVD', 'release']",The Incredible Hulk: Original Television Series Premiere
748309,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00008WFTU,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[0, 0]","&quot;Within each of us, oftimes; there dwells a mighty and raging fury&quot;.Thanks to the success of the HULK movie, the premiere of the original TV series has been released to DVD. Personally, I like the TV show better. I hadn't seen it since I was a little kid, and was surprised to find I enjoyed this DVD a lot.The first episode on this is the series 1  pilot. As all fans of the show know, Bill Bixby plays Dr. David Banner; who is haunted by nightmares about the death of his wife Laura in a car accident after a tyre blows out and the car goes off the road. Banner escapes but is unable free Laura before the car explodes.Later, Banner is conducting research for an experiment on superhuman strength. Interviewed is a woman recounting how she saved her son from burning to death in a car accident that is startlingly similar to Banner's own experience. After hearing more testimony, Banner seems to be the only one who has failed. Guilt and anxiety lead him to go one step further and become a guinea pig for his testing. He discovers that the source of this strength is gamma radiation, so he subjects himself to a course of it, but has no results. So he tries again- only this time exposing himself to seven times the amount. Nothing happens. At least... not immediately.Matters come to a head when Banner, frustrated at his lack of progress is driving home in a thunderstorm and has to change a flat tyre in the rain; this combined stress leads to his first &quot;Hulk-out&quot;...More intelligent than most TV movies, the pilot also has a memorable sequene paying homage to the drowning scene in James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN, where the Hulk tries to save a little girl from drowning but her screams alert her father who tries to shoot the hulk. Naturally the bullets just bounce off. Special mention must be made of the wig Lou Ferrigno wears- he looks like he should have a golf tee tacked into the top of his head. Also of note: Banner watches himself changing back through the reflection in the water. Strange considering in the 1990 TVM, DEATH OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK Banner comments he's never before seen the creature after watching a tape of his transformation!The bonus episode on the DVD is the series 2 pilot &quot;Married&quot;; again Written, Produced and Directed by Kenneth Johnson, who also produced SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN and BIONIC WOMAN.This installment has Banner, using the alias David Benton; in Honolulu seeing psychiatrist Dr. Caroline Fields (Mariette Hartley, in an Emmy winning performance) to try and control his &quot;hulkouts&quot;.(He even shows her a newspaper photo of the Hulk and confronts the beast while under hypnosis! So that's three times on this DVD alone!) Banner falls in love with her and learns Caroline is terminally ill and has only 6-8 weeks to live. Of course, Banner is none too happy to discover his nemesis, tabloid reporter Jack Magee (Jack Colvin) is sniffing around trying to catch the creature.MARRIED is an intelligent emotionally charged, (but not sappy) episode which is appealing to adults as well as kids. There are also a few laughs, most notably in the scene where the Hulk trashes a weasly bachelor's &quot;swinging&quot; pad! The bell bottoms are good for a giggle too. &quot;Groovy&quot; stuff. I hope more episodes of the show are released on DVD.",4,&quot;Don't make me angry.

748311,A1RLUEM3PKB9P3,B00008WFTU,Christopher J. Brimelow,"[0, 0]","One word - EXCELLENT!This TV series was hands down, the best transformation of a comic book character to the screen. From the opening credits of the pilot, we could immediately tell that we were in for a quality production. Everything about it is excellent: the story, the actors, the direction, the music. Sure, it does have some elements of ""70's cheesiness,"" but for the most part, it is a timeless production. The same is also true for the bonus episode ""Married.""Without getting too much into the show itself, these two episodes were a great choice for this DVD. Both stories are very tragic and sad and it almost seems like they are trying to show how much better the original series was than the new film!As for the DVD, the picture is outstanding! It is very crisp and clean considering how old the footage is. Same thing with the audio. It brings this 25 year old show back to life!The commentary by Kenneth Johnson is worth the price of the DVD alone! The show was basically Kenneth's baby; he wrote, produced, and directed it. In the commentary it is just him, talking about everything from the camera shots to the tragic life of Bill Bixby. I couldn't believe he went on for almost 4 hours without ever running out of things to talk about! Needless to say, it was fascinating. The intro by Lou Ferrigno is also a nice extra.There are a couple of annoying things about the DVD, mainly the fact that most of the extras have nothing to do with the original show! Even the cover is from the new film (except for a barely noticable photo of Bill and Lou in the CGI Hulk's hand.) It becomes painfully obvious that this DVD was released mainly to promote the new film, which makes me pessimistic about any season sets in the near future.And the most annoying thing of all - they make you sit through a preview of ""The Fast and Furious"" DVD every time you want to watch the pilot!!! There should be a law against this.The strengths of this DVD far outshine the weaknesses, which is why I give it 5 stars!",5,They just don't make 'em like this anymore!,1057190400,"07 3, 2003",2003,2008,"['One', 'word', 'EXCELLENT', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'transformation', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'screen', 'opening', 'credits', 'pilot', 'could', 'immediately', 'tell', 'were', 'quality', 'production', 'Everything', 'excellent', 'story', 'actors', 'direction', 'music', 'Sure', 'have', 'elements', '70', 'cheesiness', 'most', 'part', 'timeless', 'production', 'same', 'also', 'true', 'bonus', 'episode', 'Married', 'getting', 'too', 'much', 'show', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'great', 'choice', 'DVD', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'tragic', 'sad', 'almost', 'are', 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'new', 'film', 'DVD', 'picture', 'outstanding', 'very', 'crisp', 'clean', 'considering', 'how', 'old', 'footage', 'Same', 'thing', 'audio', '25', 'year', 'old', 'show', 'back', 'life', 'commentary', 'Kenneth', 'Johnson', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'show', 'was', 'basically', 'Kenneth', 'baby', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'commentary', 'just', 'talking', 'everything', 'camera', 'shots', 'tragic', 'life', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'went', 'almost', '4', 'hours', 'ever', 'running', 'things', 'talk', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'fascinating', 'intro', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'also', 'nice', 'are', 'couple', 'annoying', 'things', 'DVD', 'mainly', 'fact', 'most', 'extras', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'original', 'show', 'Even', 'cover', 'new', 'film', 'barely', 'noticable', 'photo', 'Bill', 'Lou', 'CGI', 'Hulk', 'hand', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'mainly', 'promote', 'new', 'film', 'pessimistic', 'season', 'sets', 'near', 'future.And', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'make', 'sit', 'preview', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'DVD', 'time', 'want', 'watch', 'pilot', 'should', 'be', 'law', 'this.The', 'strengths', 'DVD', 'far', 'weaknesses', 'why', 'give', '5', 'stars']",The Incredible Hulk: Original Television Series Premiere
748312,A1URGGQKX7MSST,B00008WFTU,Christopher J. Schillig,"[3, 3]","Not having seen the pilot episode of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; since I was a child, I was pleasantly surprised by its intelligent, witty script and sure-handed direction. Kenneth Johnson, the pilot's writer, director, and producer, guides the cast, lead by the always excellent Bill Bixby, through a thoughtful exploration of love and loss disguised as a monster movie.Lou Ferrigno, a novice to acting before his stint as the growling, green Hulk, performs admirably, inspiring the right amounts of fear and pathos. Johnson even finds time for a homage to James Whale's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in a scene where the Hulk discovers a young girl sitting beside a lake - shades of Boris Karloff in the Universal classic.What is most impressive to me is Johnson's refusal to pander to a kiddie audience by &quot;camping up&quot; the material. He gives plausible, pseudo-scientific reasons for Bixby, as Dr. David Bruce Banner, to pursue a bombardment of gamma rays that eventually transform him into a raging beast.Not that the film is all touchy-feely. The scene where the creature - later dubbed &quot;The Hulk&quot; by a news tabloid - breaks free of a steel tank is effectively chilling, with great lighting and atmosphere. Compare the Hulk here with the computer-animated monstrosity of the theatrical film and you'll realize that Ferrigno is the more menacing, because he's 100 per cent, in-your-face, real.Surprisingly, too, very little changes were made when the pilot was picked up for a regular series (I remember reading that the Hulk's make-up was modified somewhat to make him less fearsome). This is a tribute to the thought and skill of Johnson, Bixby, Ferrigno and crew - their work here is the perfect set-up for the seasons to come.This DVD looks as if it were produced on a shoestring budget. Sound quality is acceptable, and the picture, while occasionally grainy, is generally clear. A nice bonus is the two-parter, &quot;Married,&quot; on the DVD's second side. But the real gem is the commentary by Johnson over the pilot. It's an crash course in television production and a gold mine for fans of the TV Hulk.All in all, a lot of bang for the buck. I only hope that Universal will decide to release future volumes of the regular series.",4,Smartly scripted and directed thriller...,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,2261,"['Not', 'having', 'seen', 'pilot', 'episode', 'quot', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'was', 'child', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'script', 'sure-handed', 'direction', 'Kenneth', 'Johnson', 'pilot', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'cast', 'lead', 'always', 'excellent', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'thoughtful', 'exploration', 'love', 'loss', 'disguised', 'monster', 'movie.Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'novice', 'acting', 'stint', 'growling', 'green', 'Hulk', 'admirably', 'inspiring', 'right', 'amounts', 'fear', 'pathos', 'Johnson', 'even', 'time', 'homage', 'James', 'Whale', 'quot', 'Frankenstein', 'quot', 'scene', 'where', 'Hulk', 'young', 'girl', 'sitting', 'lake', 'shades', 'Boris', 'Karloff', 'Universal', 'classic.What', 'most', 'impressive', 'Johnson', 'refusal', 'pander', 'kiddie', 'audience', 'quot', 'camping', 'up', 'quot', 'material', 'plausible', 'pseudo-scientific', 'reasons', 'Bixby', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'pursue', 'bombardment', 'gamma', 'rays', 'eventually', 'transform', 'raging', 'beast.Not', 'film', 'touchy-feely', 'scene', 'where', 'creature', 'later', 'dubbed', 'quot', 'Hulk', 'quot', 'news', 'tabloid', 'breaks', 'free', 'steel', 'tank', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'great', 'lighting', 'atmosphere', 'Compare', 'Hulk', 'here', 'computer-animated', 'monstrosity', 'theatrical', 'film', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'Ferrigno', 'more', 'menacing', '100', 'cent', 'in-your-face', 'real.Surprisingly', 'too', 'very', 'little', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'when', 'pilot', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'regular', 'series', 'remember', 'reading', 'Hulk', 'make-up', 'was', 'modified', 'somewhat', 'make', 'less', 'fearsome', 'tribute', 'thought', 'skill', 'Johnson', 'Bixby', 'Ferrigno', 'crew', 'work', 'here', 'perfect', 'set-up', 'seasons', 'come.This', 'DVD', 'were', 'produced', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'Sound', 'quality', 'acceptable', 'picture', 'occasionally', 'grainy', 'generally', 'clear', 'nice', 'bonus', 'two-parter', 'quot', 'Married', 'quot', 'DVD', 'second', 'side', 'real', 'gem', 'commentary', 'Johnson', 'pilot', 'crash', 'course', 'television', 'production', 'gold', 'mine', 'fans', 'TV', 'Hulk.All', 'lot', 'bang', 'buck', 'only', 'hope', 'Universal', 'will', 'decide', 'release', 'future', 'volumes', 'regular', 'series']",The Incredible Hulk: Original Television Series Premiere

A perfect choice to play the Big Green Guy himself. I remember watching this show as a kid and it scaring the living he** out of me. I've been a Hulkhead ever since. I was overjoyed when I heard about it being re-released on dvd. Well, two milestone episodes anyway. (Universal, PLEASE release all the other episodes!!)The picture quality is exquisite. They really cleaned up most of the fuzz and haze that inhibits most '70's television programs. It's so clear that you can see the green in the Hulk's contact lenses. If you haven't seen this film, it's very well done considering the available budget and resources . The fx are convincing, and the Hulk's makeup rocks. Really scary looking. The direction, music and fashion is very typical for TV at that time, so it may come across as a bit dated, however it shouldn't take away from the overall enjoyment factor. Ferigno is actually very good as the creature. As an amateur actor who was mostly deaf, he was brilliant. I still get a rush everytime I see those clothes ripping over swelling green flesh and hear that awesome ""RRROOOOAAAAAAARRRRRR!!!""The ""Married"" episode, though touching at the end and very much a milestone in the series, isn't really that good. Not really that bad either though. The direction seems to have been very lax. Much of the tension and adrenaline present in the original seems to be gone. There is still some, but it's very low key. Lou Ferigno doesn't seem to go as completely berserk either. He's almost a calm Hulk in the first couple ""Hulk scenes."" I mean, he's supposed to be ""driven by rage"" right? But by the second half of the film, he starts acting like a monster again. There is way too much comic relief, nearly reaching parody in one scene. A girl in a drunken stupor seems to find the Hulk attractive and says ""Far out!"" Or the part where the Hulk picks up a swingin' playboy by his chest hair. I think not. Also, the Hulk's makeup is a bit lame. The short cropped, stylish wig Lou wears here looks ridiculous. The matted, wild and shaggy wig from the original was much better. And something about the facial prosthetics seemed different and less fierce looking. It also seemed very rushed. Some scenes ended short, and it really seemed at times like they had to butcher it to fit into a 2 our TV time slot. Too bad.Despite all this, it's really not that bad. There may be some intentional and unintentional laughs, but it turns out to be fairly moving. Also Bill Bixby's performance was brilliant as always.

748314,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,B00008WFTU,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[1, 1]","While the debate will continue to rage regarding the choice to CGI the Hulk in Ang Lee's 2003 movie, there will be no argument about the Incredible Hulk TV series that many people grew up with.Lou Ferrigno, a 330-plus pound behemoth, was so huge in contrast to Bill Bixby's Bruce Banner that the Hulk effect was completely believable, and should still be to this day. The TV series wasn't completely ridiculous or fantastic either; the focus managed to stay on Banner/Hulk as an individual in the world, not as an experiment gone wrong. Banner's loner self is portrayed excellently--he often hitchhikes places or shows jump in mid-sequence with him by himself, just waiting to get picked on.For a 70's effort, the producers managed to pull off some decent and subtle effects as well--before Banner gets &quot;angry&quot; his pupils famously turn a different color, almost a whitish green; his feet expand and rip his shoes apart; and the shirt rips (bicep, back, chest) are all done well enough to make you think he's actually expanding and not just Lou Ferrigno flexing in an undersized shirt.It's not just the superhuman aspect that will draw you in, it's also the emotional side, which this series plays off incredibly well. This television premiere is certainly a must for all fans, but the new entire season DVD set should be factored in when buying this.",4,Lou Ferrigno...Where Are You Now?,1055289600,"06 11, 2003",2003,1360,"['debate', 'will', 'continue', 'rage', 'regarding', 'choice', 'CGI', 'Hulk', 'Ang', 'Lee', '2003', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'argument', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'series', 'many', 'people', 'grew', 'up', 'with.Lou', 'Ferrigno', '330-plus', 'pound', 'behemoth', 'was', 'so', 'huge', 'contrast', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'Hulk', 'effect', 'was', 'completely', 'believable', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'day', 'TV', 'series', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'fantastic', 'focus', 'managed', 'stay', 'Banner/Hulk', 'individual', 'world', 'not', 'experiment', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Banner', 'loner', 'self', 'portrayed', 'excellently', 'often', 'places', 'shows', 'jump', 'mid-sequence', 'just', 'waiting', 'get', 'picked', '70', 'effort', 'producers', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'decent', 'subtle', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'Banner', 'quot', 'angry', 'quot', 'pupils', 'famously', 'turn', 'different', 'color', 'almost', 'whitish', 'green', 'feet', 'expand', 'rip', 'shoes', 'apart', 'shirt', 'rips', 'bicep', 'back', 'chest', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'make', 'think', 'actually', 'expanding', 'not', 'just', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'flexing', 'undersized', 'shirt.It', 'not', 'just', 'superhuman', 'aspect', 'will', 'draw', 'also', 'emotional', 'side', 'series', 'incredibly', 'well', 'television', 'premiere', 'certainly', 'must', 'fans', 'new', 'entire', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'should', 'be', 'factored', 'when', 'buying']",The Incredible Hulk: Original Television Series Premiere

On Friday, June 20, do yourself a favor and take that $9 you were going to spend on admission and $6 on popcorn and purchase The Incredible Hulk Original Television Pilot DVD, and curl up on the couch for 3 hours of the most moving human drama you will ever see.Having seen the theatrical film, I can promise you that its overblown CGI effects and cliche characters are cold and lifeless compared to the original televison series created by Kenneth Johnson, the brilliant man who gave us the original V mini-series and both the Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman, and brought to life by the incredible and unforgettable talents of Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.The first 5 minutes of the Pilot episode has more humanity than a single frame of Ang Lee's new Hulk film.  It is the sad, tragic origin of Dr. David Bruce Banner's endless quest to come to terms with his wife's unfortunate death and the accident that caused him to transform into the infernal green Hulk.But that's just the beginning of the story.  This DVD also includes perhaps the most powerfully moving episode of the series called ""Married"" and it is a real treat.  I remember watching it as a 6 year old boy back in 1978 and thought it was very sad.  Now, having seen it again as a 31 year old man, I can tell you that by the end you will not be able to hold back the tears from streaming down your face.  It is perhaps the saddest piece of drama I have ever seen.Now, what would you rather watch?  Some cold, lifeless, CGI infested blockbuster that has absolutely no soul or depth of character, or a 25 year old television show that reminds you what it means to be a human being and can all be attributed to a single differential reason: Story.",5,Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno will FOREVER be the Hulk,1055721600,"06 16, 2003",2003,1802,"['Do', 'favor', 'skip', 'summer', 'over-promoted', 'blockbuster', 'right', 'Friday', 'June', '20', 'do', 'favor', 'take', '9', 'were', 'going', 'spend', 'admission', '6', 'popcorn', 'purchase', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Original', 'Television', 'Pilot', 'DVD', 'up', 'couch', '3', 'hours', 'most', 'moving', 'human', 'drama', 'will', 'ever', 'see.Having', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'film', 'can', 'promise', 'overblown', 'CGI', 'effects', 'cliche', 'characters', 'are', 'cold', 'lifeless', 'compared', 'original', 'televison', 'series', 'created', 'Kenneth', 'Johnson', 'brilliant', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'original', 'V', 'mini-series', 'Six', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Man', 'Bionic', 'Woman', 'brought', 'life', 'incredible', 'unforgettable', 'talents', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno.The', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'more', 'humanity', 'single', 'frame', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'new', 'Hulk', 'film', 'sad', 'tragic', 'origin', 'Dr.', 'David', 'Bruce', 'Banner', 'endless', 'quest', 'come', 'terms', 'wife', 'unfortunate', 'death', 'accident', 'caused', 'transform', 'infernal', 'green', 'Hulk.But', 'just', 'beginning', 'story', 'DVD', 'also', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'episode', 'series', 'called', 'Married', 'real', 'treat', 'remember', 'watching', '6', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'back', '1978', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'Now', 'having', 'seen', 'again', '31', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'can', 'tell', 'end', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'hold', 'back', 'tears', 'streaming', 'down', 'face', 'perhaps', 'saddest', 'piece', 'drama', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Now', 'what', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'cold', 'lifeless', 'CGI', 'infested', 'blockbuster', 'absolutely', 'soul', 'depth', 'character', '25', 'year', 'old', 'television', 'show', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'single', 'differential', 'reason', 'Story']",The Incredible Hulk: Original Television Series Premiere

So when I heard after an episode of Wonder Woman that it would be a series, I made plans to watch.  Overall it was a great series, in fact the other episode on this disc won an emmy for its only major guest star Marriette Hartley (who would later work with Bixby again in Goodnight Beantown).  Anyway to get back to the pilot, it explored more of a human interest story in the character.  The writer apparantly felt that the death of Banner's wife would impact the viewer more than Banner saving a teenager from a bomb blast.  It's also interesting how they changed the character's name to David.  When the comic strip started he was called Bruce Banner.  Then Stan Lee slipped a few times and called him Bob Banner in occasional strips which to remedy, he copped a plea by saying his name was really Robert Bruce Banner.  And now he's David.  Since they (Universal) couldn't remedy it without recutting the film, Stan Lee himself convinced the studio to use his cop out to explain the name change which is why his name at the cemetary is David Bruce Banner.  Good thing they left well enough alone at this point.  I just hope in the new movie, they don't change his name again or I'm heading for the hills.  But seriously this disc and the series sequels (also on DVD now) are worth buying.  By the way, if you think this postive review overrides my review of the 2fer, you're wrong.

748320,AUR6QWAQN2UE4,B00008WFTU,"Gregg David ""No1NYJfan""","[0, 0]","Writer, Producer &amp; Director Kenneth Johnson delivers big time with a totally re-invented Hulk.  This is not your father's &quot;Hulk SMASH!!&quot; that Stan Lee created for Marvel Comics back in 1962.  This is a thinking man's drama created by the mind of Johnson and delivered by the touching &amp; sensitive performance of Bill Bixby.  It takes on pieces of Hugo's &quot;L'es Miserables&quot; &amp; TVs &quot;The Fugitive&quot; as Bixby's Dr. David Banner is on the run from investigative reporter Jack McGee who believes the creature is a killer after a gamma radiation overdose creates Banner's own Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde nightmare.This Hulk is a drama carved out from comic book origins, a tale of a man losing his wife and the struggle that follows.  If this were the theatre, Bixby's performance would be felt from the back row- loss, angst, wanting, enlightenment, anger, affection- it's all here. Bixby is superb as he weaves through Banner's inner demons.  Susan Sullivan delivers as well as Bixby's fellow scientist trying to help him understand his transformations.The hidden treasure of this DVD is not just re-watching the pilot again a little more sharply both in picture &amp; sound (you still have to love Joseph Harnell's chilling piano), but Johnson's commentary you can add with the push of a button.  His detailed account of when scenes were shot, how they were shot, what his thoughts were going into each shot, warm memories of the late Bixby, and humorous anecdotes really give this DVD a 5-star rating.Kudos to Universal for rounding up Johnson on the eve of the big-budget Hollywood Hulk to re-market this past treasure.

748321,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B00008WFTU,Hound Dog,"[0, 0]","A few decades before Ed Norton and then Mark Ruffalo, with the generous help of CGI, brought the movies' Hulk incredible success in the 21st Century, there was Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno's TV Hulk.  In the late 1970's, television producer Kenneth Johnson faced the mammoth task of presenting a weekly live-action ""Incredible Hulk"" series to a mainstream audience.  Using solid, intelligent scripts, and with the inspired casting of actors Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Jack Colvin, Johnson's downbeat ""Jekyll-and-Hyde Meets the Fugitive"" vision would last four and a half seasons consisting of Dr. David Banner's never-ending search for a cure from his self-inflicted curse as the Hulk.  Where did it all begin?  This DVD provides the answer in the form of the poignant series pilot, plus a bonus feature: the second season two-part premiere episode, ""Married,"" in which David Banner finds temporary bliss with a dying psychiatrist.  Hence, this DVD double-feature showcases, arguably, the two best ""Incredible Hulk"" episodes ever produced.The superb pilot episode portrays how tragedy inevitably follows once geneticist David Banner (Bill Bixby) impulsively tests out a new scientific theory of whether or not intensified gamma radiation enhances human physical strength.  Haunted by the death of his wife in a fiery car crash (and his agonizing failure to save her), an increasingly agitated Banner drives home from the lab on a dark, stormy night.  A chance flat tire enrages Banner, which soon unleashes his new alter ego: the Incredible Hulk.  According to Lou Ferrigno's claim in a recentPBS documentary, without assistance, he actually flipped over Banner's car during the Hulk's first rage.  Much like the Hulk, he said he was in a foul mood filming in the rain at, like, four o'clock in the morning, and didn't want wait any longer for the stunt to be properly set up.  If his story is true, it only adds to the realism that Ferrigno's Hulk is as close as to believable as possible.  Forget the pseudo-science involved: Johnson's screenplay at least makes the set-up about essentially radioactive steroids powering Ferrigno's Hulk sound far more plausible than Banner somehow surviving the comic book's nuclear blast origin.During the Hulk's first appearance, Johnson's script cleverly reimagines (rather than ripping off) a classic sequence from Boris Karloff's 1931 ""Frankenstein"" film in which the creature encounters a young girl at a lake's edge.  The effect once more suggests a horror film, but the Hulk's heroic intent is never in question.  Afterwards, as a skeptical Banner's worried colleague, Elaina Marks (guest star Susan Sullivan), points out, the minimal evidence suggests that the Hulk is really a primitive extension of Banner's basic personality, so he will not kill because David Banner will not kill.  I give credit to Johnson, Bixby, and Sullivan for effectively selling a brilliant science fiction concept and yet still keeping it so down-to-earth.  Also, co-star Jack Colvin makes his appearance as nosy tabloid reporter Jack McGee, as his unexpected link to the Hulk's origin anchors the ongoing storyline for the television series.  All in all, after thirty-five years, the ""Incredible Hulk"" pilot episode (minus the badly outdated wardrobe) remains top-notch television by updating the classic monster movies of the 1930's and 1940's with class and intelligence.  Composer Joseph Harnell's poignantly familiar ""Lonely Man"" theme here becomes timeless in setting the mood and tone of Banner's conflict within himself.  On a trivia note, yes, the late Ted Cassidy (TV's Lurch from ""The Addams Family"") is both the narrator on the series' opening credits and the grunting voice of the Hulk himself.The bonus episode, ""Married,"" features guest star Mariette Hartley as a dying psychiatrist in Hawaii who hypnotizes her new husband, David Banner, in an experimental form of psychoanalysis in confronting his Hulk alter-ego.  Although the episode's pace is often slow with minimal action, it is very well-written and performed to make it definitely a Top Five episode of the entire series.  My favorite moment from ""Married,"" comes when a confused Hulk examines a toupee after he rips it off a bully's head during a brawl with two ladies' men at their swinging bachelors' pad.  Having viewed a few of the Season Two episodes last week, this type of sight gag evidently was a recurring element in the series, and, for whatever reason, it just really works.  Also, look for young guest star Meeno Peluce in a small role, as he was a regular performer on television during that era.Rating: 9/10 (If you have not viewed the ""Incredible Hulk"" television series before, this DVD is an excellent starting point).",5,"""The Incredible First Hulk""",1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,4736,"['few', 'decades', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'then', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'generous',

On the other side of the DVD is the episode ""Married"", which was actually the first and second episode of the Second Season.The Incredible Hulk began on CBS on November 4, 1977.  Bill Bixby plays Dr. Banner.  It has been almost a year since his wife died in a car accident they both were in.  He continually has dreams of not being able to save his wife's life.  He just wasn't strong enough to roll the car over.  That is Lara Parker (Dark Shadows) that plays Dr. Banner's wife.  Now he studies how people are able to become so strong when normally they are not as strong.  A black woman describes how she was able to save her son in a burning car by having the ""extra strength"" (perhaps adrenaline) to lift the car to save her son.  Eventually, Dr. Banner decides to try an experiment on himself to change his DNA with Gamma Ray exposure.  Well, nothing happens.  But he felt stronger.  He tries to lift a people mover.  Nothing.  It's raining outside.  He becomes more frustrated, his thoughts anger him then the car blows a tire.  More anger.  The lightning intensifies.  He hurts his hand using the jack.  He's in pain.  Suddenly his DNA changes.  His body grows greater, his muscles grow rapidly.  His clothes rip.  His skin becomes green.  He becomes the HULK (played by Lou Ferrigno).  When the Hulk's surge of power finally calms down or when he does an act of kindness, he becomes tired and turns back into his Dr. Banner self.This tv-series was so good at building monentum and emotion, especially at the end of each episode, that the tv-series kept getting better with each episode.  Bill Bixby was perfect for the role as Dr. Banner. It's a shame he is not around to enjoy this 25th Anniversary.  He died too soon (November 21, 1993).  Such a serious and mature actor. Very well liked.On DVD, Introduction by Lou Ferrigno.

During a ""dark and stormy night"", the doctor exposes himself to massive doses of gamma radiation with little effect...or so he thinks. Later that evening, while driving from the laboratory, Banner's car has a flat tire. Enraged at having to change in the torrential downpour, Banner's anger gets the best of him and he ERUPTS into our friendly ""jolly green giant"", played by AH-nold's one time competition, Lou Ferrigno.The remainder of the movie finds Banner trying to better understand his condition while eluding the hounding from an investigative reporter (Jack Colvin) intent on discovery the identity of the ""monster"" and the connection with Banner.

Having owned MCA's VHS version for years, it is a tremendous treat to watch this in such high quality.  The sound is great, and the picture is razor sharp (compared to its prior versions).  The acting is top notch and comparable to performances today, although the bellbottoms are so 70's!The premiere and the episode ""Married"" also on this disc were definitely the two best Hulk episodes from a dramatic level.  However, Universal would earn the highest marks from me if they release as another double feature, the two-parters ""Promethius"" and ""The First"" (arguably the two best fun episodes).  DVD's are not expensive to make these days, and Universal has the masters in their vaults.  I hope they're reading this!Because the comic book/movie Hulk and the TV series Hulk are two entirely different characters, it is wrong to compare the two.  However, with an actor playing the creature, there is alot more humanity and feeling behind it than someone created by computer.

748339,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00008WFTU,trebe,"[0, 0]","Based on the comic book character created by Marvel's maestro Stan Lee, the pilot episode of The Incredible Hulk recounts how scientist David Bruce Banner, exposes himself to an ultrahigh dose of gamma radiation, which then causes him to transform into a huge green skinned creature, known as the Hulk.  The adaptation incorporates very little from the comic mythology, as Banner searches for some way to return to a normal life.Veteran actor Bill Bixby (My Favorite Martian, The Courtship of Eddie's Father) plays David Banner, a man with his insides torn apart with frustration, stemming from his inability to save his wife's life, during a tragic car accident.  Banner works at the Culver Institute with his long time colleague, Dr. Elaina Harding (Susan Sullivan).  Coincidentally they are involved in research on how humans are able to perform superhuman acts of strength, in times of stress.Discovering that gamma radiation may be the cause of great strength in a crisis, Banner exposes himself to an ultra high dosage.  However instead of acquiring super strength, Banner finds that when he gets angry, he transforms into a green skinned muscular giant that comes to be known as ""the Hulk"".  Portrayed by body builder Lou Ferrigno, the Hulk is extremely powerful and destructive, but not too bright.Banner has no memory of what happens while he is the Hulk.  He confides in Elaina, who helps find out what has happened to him.  A key character in the series, investigative reporter Jack McGee (Jack Colvin) is introduced, setting in place the basic elements for a series that would run for five seasons.Multitalented writer, director, and producer, Kenneth Johnson had already had great success with his creations The Six Million Dollar Man (1974-78), and The Bionic Woman (1976-78), when he was approached about bringing a character from the Marvel Universe to television.  Johnson saw potential in the Incredible Hulk, and he cleverly found a way to adapt the character, and scale down his violent capabilities for series television.The thought process behind the genesis of the series, is discussed in detail by Johnson in a commentary track recorded in 2003.  Johnson has a remarkable memory, and his remarks are extremely insightful and detailed.  Referring to him as ""Bix"", Johnson's affection and respect for the late Bill Bixby (1934-1993) is evident.  Johnson wrote the screenplay specifically with Bixby in mind, and the actor is absolutely perfect for the role, bringing great vulnerability, humility, and dignity, to David Banner, who tragically is responsible for his own predicament.Susan Sullivan (Falcon Crest, Castle) is so much more than a pretty face, and gives a wonderfully warm performance, that helps to reveal Banner's character.  Jack Colvin is also very good as the pesky reporter, who like a bad rash, just won't go away.  Bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno was primarily selected for his physical abilities, but still manages to display some decent acting skills, conveying much through his facial expressions.  Having lost his hearing as a child, affected Ferrigno's speech, and limited his ability to deliver lines.  The Hulk mostly growls, with his voice provided by Ted Cassidy.  Ferrigno endures heavy application of green makeup, and some wild haircuts.  The same slow motion techniques utilized in The Six Million Dollar Man, are also employed in The Incredible Hulk.  The technique is somewhat effective, though would perhaps become overused.The pilot has some ridiculous moments, topped by David and Elaina attempting to recreate the situation when the transformation first took place.  Locked in a hyperbaric chamber in a secluded lab, Banner loosens a water line to simulate rain, and then generates electrical arcs to simulate lightning.  Elaina witnesses Banner's transformation and destruction of the chamber, and David learns the shocking truth.  Thanks to the troublesome McGee, the lab accidentally blows up.  The Hulk appears to rescue Elaina from the flames, but Banner tragically loses his best friend, and is presumed dead.With the Hulk wanted for murder, the stage is set for David Banner to wander from place to place, like Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1963-67).  Using false names, he tries to keep a low profile and avoid trouble, but somehow always seems to find it, inevitably leading to the appearance of the Hulk.  Trailing the green skinned giant across the country is McGee, who Banner tries very hard to avoid.  This becomes a familiar formula that is repeated through over eighty episodes, from 1977 through 1982.Despite some minor shortcomings, the pilot episode sets up the series nicely, and features wonderful performances by Bill Bixby and Susan Sullivan.  Image quality is good, but a little hazy at times.  The episode has subtitles, and Kenneth's Johnson's commentary is not to be missed.",4,"inventive adaptation of the Hulk, results in a winning formula with staying power...",1330214400,"02 26,
