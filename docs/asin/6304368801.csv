417097,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,6304368801,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[2, 3]","This movie was based on a true incident during the Civil War.  On April 12, 1862, a group of Yankees headed by Andrews, a smooth talker and prevaricator claimed they were on the Southern side.  He is the star spy, played by Fess Parker who does all the talking, a popular guy heading the Secret Service for the Northern side.  The other ""star"" was played by Jeffrey Hunter, my J.C. with those blue eyes in 'King of Kings', not so prevalent with his Southern accent.  He is the railroad conducter who follows the heisters.  John Owens was a young Mark in his glasses; he played Ross (""one was pointing toward us; they all look mighty suspicious."").They trick the train crew into leaving them outside with the train, The General, which they take over to use to burn bridges along the East/West from Memphis to Huntsville, Alabama line.  Knoxville is barely able to defend East Tennessee, Campbell is south of Nashville.  They hide in the car #1651 as they navigate toward the Cumberland Mountains in desolute country.  The Tennessee River is impassable (that was before TVA dams were built to alleviate this constant deterrent).  They dined with a group of Southern sympathizers where they sang ""Dixie"" and other regional songs and gave the Rebel yell.  It was a close call as they took over the General; three engines came after them, led by Fuller the conductor.  Engineers don't talk much; all they do is follow orders.It was a game of keep away.  Andrews claimed  he was taking ammunition to Chattanooga.  ""Who do you think you are, own the whole railroad?""  At the Johnny Reb campground, someone wondered aloud, ""Won't anything stop that train?""  They were to be ambushed in a tunnel with a whistle announcing their arrival.  They were surrounded by S. Calvary who were on the warpath.  The spies were caught and put in prison.  ""We've all got to go sometime.""  There was a fierce fight between the prisoners and Andrews was taken prisoners while the rest got away.  ""I'm sorry I had to deceive you.  Don't hold a grudge"" as he shook hands will Fuller.

This exciting story is based on the true to life incident that took place during the Civil War. From what I have heard there were only a couple minor changes in the recreation of the story. Walt Disney made wonderful movies during the Fifties and Sixties that were great for the whole family to enjoy together. I am ecstatic they are now releasing these movies to DVD. My only complaint is that there seems to be an issue with quantity instead of quality. They seem more interested in releasing a great number of movies than worrying about the condition of them. Now I'm am as anxious as the next person to get all their live action movies out but I hope they start taking the time to realize they need to monitor the quality control. I don't need the extras on this first release. Once they have released all the movies they use to run on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" then they can go back and do Platinum Editions. I will be satisfied with just the movie since there are so many more they need to release like ""Dr. Syn, alias Scarecrow"" and ""The Swamp Fox"" that I can be satisfied with just the basics but I want the movie to have sharp picture and sound quality. Some of the recent live action movies have been great quality (e.g. Three Lives of Thomasina) and some have been poor (e.g. ""The Journey of Natty Gann). I hope someone from Disney is paying attention to Amazons reviews because if they don't they may find their DVDs aren't selling so well.

He took the ""Andrews Raiders"" incident from the Civil War (that involved Union spies hijacking a Confederate train) and turned it into a movie.  It has it's inaccuracies, but overall it gives you an idea of what really happened.  What really makes this movie is that Disney contacted the B&O train museum in Baltimore, and borrowed some of their period locomotives and equipment.  Portraying the hijacked locomotive ""The General"" is the ""William Mason"" from the museum.  She's a fine lady of a locomotive, who appeared not only in this movie, but the recent flop ""The Wild Wild West"" as ""the Wanderer"". Fess Parker gives his usual wooden and stilted performance as Andrews, and being a Disney film there's singing (but no dancing) in the movie.  But Jeffrey Hunter does a great job as Fuller, the Confederate conductor of the hijacked train.  Most men would have been alarmed as they watched their train pull away without the regular crew, but how many would run after it like Fuller did? And run and run, commandeering a rail car and 3 locomotives before finally catching up with the stolen train.

Although I am far too young to have seen this in its initial release in theatres, this was one of the very first movies that I saw when I was a child. I really did not remember much from the movie--except that it had given me thrills as a kid. I was excited to watch this again with my brother and father.My father is a Noth Carolina native who moved up north, and that makes me a North Dakota native. This is important because we both tend to lean on opposite sides of the ""Civil War fence."" Well, this movie is great because it shows respect to both sides. The main premise is that some Northern spies steal a train from the South with the intentions of destroying tracks and bridges. One determined Southern railroad conductor takes personal offense at his train being stolen and follows it doggedly--first on foot and slowly upgrading from there.You can't really describe the movie beyond the premise without ruining it. However, this is based on a true story--and one that potentially would have impacted the war in a BIG way. This is given colorful Disney treatment, and it is very enjoyable. As mentioned already, you are able to watch this from either perspective and enjoy it because both sides are given equal treatment. Also, it is not just the story of a locomotive chase as it also outlines the beginning of the Medal of Honor.As for the DVD release, I don't mind that there are not extras.

Bernabo,"[24, 24]","The story of Andrew's Raiders and their adventures during the Civil War had served as the basis for Buster Keaton's classic silent comedy &quot;The General.&quot;  In 1956 Walt Disney produced a more serious and more historically accurate account with the studio's new star Fess Parker as James J. Andrews.  A Union spy, Andrews puts together a group of volunteers who will pretend they are on their way to join the Confederate army, board a passenger train, and steal it.  However, once they succeed in stealing a train they have to put up with its conductor, William A. Fuller (Jeffrey Hunter), who pursues them so relentlessly that you end up forgetting he is not the hero of this particular story.  Despite all the obstacles they through as their pursuer, such as uncoupling a car to send rolling back at the other train and burning another car in the middle of a bridge, Andrews and his men are finally forced to abandon the train.  However, they are all captured and now have to plot a daring escape from the Confederate stockade.&quot;The Great Locomotive Chase,&quot; directed by Francis D. Lyon, was filmed in beautiful county in northern Georgia on tracks that paralleled the actual route taken by the Andrews Raiders.  You want to make sure you pick up the widescreen version that reflects the original CinemaScope proportions becuse there are several shots that take full advantage of the larger dimensions.  What is most impressive about Lawrence E.

417114,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,6304368801,Mcgivern Owen L,"[3, 3]","""The Great Locomotive Chase"" tells the story of the Andrews Raid behind Confederate lines during the Civil War.  Fess Parker plays the leader of the Union agents whose mission is to steal a train and cut a key Confederate rail line in Georgia.  The Southern railroad honcho who tries foiling Andrews is Jeffrey Hunter. GLC was his next role after playing John Wayne's ""nephew"" in John Ford's western classic ""The Searchers"".  (Trivia: Who played his girlfriend in the movie?) This reviewer believes JH far outshines Parker and the rest of the cast. The action is constant here as Hunter's train relentlessly pursues Andrews and his men. Railfans (not ""train buffs""!) will love the switching of cars, setting of sidings and stoking the fires on the fine old cars provided by the B&O RR Museum in Baltimore. Smell that coal, smoke, valve oil and steam! There is also nice Southern atmosphere, especially those old stations. What happens? A good review doesn't reveal resolutions, but the pace does slow a bit later in the movie, prompting this reviewer to deduct a star from the rating above. Though it is no fault of the movie, the child in this observer remembers a different resolution from when he saw the film during its' initial run. Perhaps Disney released different versions.  The bottom line is that GLC is fine old style, old school Disney family entertainment. The Old Man himself must have been proud of this one.

With so many other reviews, I don't think I need to summarize the plot.Anchor Bay, as usual, has given us a DVD that is beautiful to look at, with only a few areas where the age of the film is apparent. This is widescreen and I can't imagine watching this film any other way. The sound is pretty much what you would expect for a 1956 release.Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter are fine as the lead protagonists, with Jeff York also registering as one of Andrews' Raiders who would rather fight, than follow the ""cloak and dagger"" routine. Of course, York played Mike Fink--""King of the River""--opposite Fess Parker's Davy Crockett.This movie is a dream for railroad buffs--old steam trains still provide a thrill for many people. It is also noteworthy for  people interested in the civil war, being based on actual events, although I suspect history scholars might find it too superficial. However, the purpose of this movie is to entertain fans of all ages--not to get bogged down in too much detail.Parents should find this movie a delight to watch with their children, especially young boys. The plot is not complicated--there is plenty of action--and while shots are fired, and some fists fly, there is none of the more graphic violence that today's films seem to wallow in.Like other reviewers, I would have liked some ""extras"". Comments from Fess Parker--now a successful California wine-maker--added a lot to Disney's Davy Crockett collection. Mr. Parker's memories of this film would have been a nice plus. Sadly, Jeffrey Hunter passed away at a young age, during the 1960s.Perhaps some day there will be a ""deluxe"" edition from Disney--but, in the mean time, we must thank Anchor Bay for giving us this highly watchable version.Again, recommended viewing for the whole family.A very sad footnote, dated 20 March 2010. Mr. Fess Parker has passed away. I recall as a small boy in England seeing Davy Crockett, and being mesmerized by this tall, ""straight-talkin' straight-shootin'"" American, who was indisputably the ""King of the Wild Frontier"" !

I was lucky enough (as was my wife) to have had the producer and writer of the film, Lawrence Edward Watkin, as a professor when he retired from Disney to teach at Cal State Fullerton.  He was our favorite teacher.  We didn't know each other at the time.  This is a good, tight story based on Andrew's Raiders attempt to disrupt the Confederate railroad lines to bring about an early end yo the Civil War.  The cast is solid: Fess Parker without a coonskin cap, Jeffrey Hunter, and Kenneth Tobey (in my opinion, under-appreciated through his long career).  Very enjoyable.  Plenty of action.  But then again, I am biased.  Lawrence Edward Watkin, by the way, wrote the novel &#34;On Borrowed Time&#34; which was turned into a stage play and made into a classic MGM film in 1939.

The Great Locomotive Chase perfectly captures the essence of it's subject,in script,performance,and good Cinematography.Many memorable scenes,including the inevitable Locomotive Chases,an Empty box car sent down the track (on fire) by James Andrews,in order to crash into the approaching Locomotive,carrying William Fuller,amongst others,the actual run up to,and theft.And then the ending,inevitable for anyone who knows their History,never-the-less,an exciting one.About the Transfer of this film to DVD:Anchor Bay have done a very good job!Now this film can be seen properly,the Cinematography looks superb,justified by just the right amount of colour depth,and contrast inparticular,spot-on.Original Aspect Ratio,2.35:1,Sharp,detailed,and only a handful of scenes that show even slight traces of dirt.4.5/5. The Sound quality of this DVD:Considering the age of the material,i expected the sound on this DVD to be somewhat inferior.Again,as with the picture quality,i was very surprised,it is very clear,especially the speech.No hissing,or distortion related problems,but on rare occasion i did hear a slight glitch in the form of a popping noise,on i think,a reel change.Overall,for the sound:3.5/5. So,as a DVD,The Great Locomotive Chase,has been given very good treatment by anchor bay,having now seen this film in it's original theatrical aspect ratio,so clearly,was almost like watching it the first time,again.A great film,that keeps you hanging on,right until the end.My only real complaint to Anchor bay would be:Where are the additional materials?!",4,"April 12,1862.",988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,1905,"['Fess', 'Parker', 'quot', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'King', 'Wild', 'Frontier', 'quot', 'stars', 'James', 'J.Andrews', 'leader', 'Union', 'spies', 'who', 'steal', 'train', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Confederate', 'troops.Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'role', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'quot', 'King', 'Kings', 'quot', '/1961', 'William', 'A.Fuller', 'brave', 'Rebel', 'Patriot', 'Great', 'Locomotive', 'Chase', 'perfectly', 'essence', 'subject', 'script', 'performance', 'good', 'Cinematography.Many', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'including', 'inevitable', 'Locomotive', 'Chases', 'Empty', 'box', 'car', 'sent', 'down', 'track', 'fire', 'James', 'Andrews', 'order', 'crash', 'approaching', 'Locomotive', 'carrying', 'William', 'Fuller', 'amongst', 'others', 'actual', 'run', 'up', 'theft.And', 'then', 'ending', 'inevitable', 'anyone', 'who', 'History', 'never-the-less', 'exciting', 'one.About', 'Transfer', 'film', 'DVD', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Now', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'properly', 'Cinematography', 'superb', 'justified', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'colour', 'depth', 'contrast', 'inparticular', 'spot-on.Original', 'Aspect', 'Ratio,2.35:1', 'Sharp', 'detailed', 'only', 'handful', 'scenes', 'show', 'even', 'slight', 'traces', 'dirt.4.5/5', 'Sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'Considering', 'age', 'material', 'i', 'expected', 'sound', 'DVD', 'be', 'somewhat', 'inferior.Again', 'picture', 'quality', 'i', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'very', 'clear', 'especially', 'speech.No', 'hissing', 'distortion', 'related', 'problems', 'rare', 'occasion', 'i', 'did', 'hear', 'slight', 'glitch', 'form', 'popping', 'noise', 'i', 'think', 'reel', 'change.Overall', 'sound:3.5/5', 'So', 'DVD', 'Great', 'Locomotive', 'Chase', 'been', 'given', 'very', 'good', 'treatment', 'anchor', 'bay', 'having', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'so', 'clearly', 'was', 'almost', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'again.A', 'great', 'film', 'hanging', 'right', 'end.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'Anchor', 'bay', 'would', 'be', 'Where', 'are', 'additional', 'materials']",The Great Locomotive Chase VHS

417128,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6304368801,T O'Brien,"[3, 3]","Based on true events, The Great Locomotive Chase is a Disney movie that has never gotten the recognition like some others, notably the Davy Crockett series, but it is an exciting, well-told story about an incident in the Civil War.  James Andrews is a Union spy who shows his loyalty to the South by working as a blockade runner.  Andrews is asked by a Union general upon reporting to undertake a dangerous mission.  With a small group of men, get behind Confederate lines, steal a locomotive and race back to safety, tearing up track and burning bridges all the way so Confederate reinforcements can't get up to the lines for an upcoming attack.  But with Confederates right on their tail, can they make it back?  This was a short movie, about 85 minutes, but after the first 20-25 minutes, it's one extended chase scene which is exciting all the way until the end. Be forewarned if little kids are watching, this isn't your typical happy ending.  The movie benefits from the locations in Georgia and North Carolina, it looks like the same areas seen in the DC movies, and the train footage is excellent.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase!Less than a year since wrapping up the five-part Davy Crockett shows on Disneyland, Fess Parker plays James Andrews, the leader of a small group of raiders trying to complete their dangerous mission behind enemy lines.  Think of a more formal Davy Crockett for the character.  Jeffrey Hunter is very good as William Fuller, the train conductor in hot pursuit of the raiders as they race toward safety.  John Lupton is good as William Pittenger, the most visible of Andrews' raiders who becomes almost a second-in-command.  Fans of Disney movies will appreciate the supporting cast that includes Jeff York, Kenneth Tobey, and Don Megowan. I kept waiting for Buddy Ebsen (Georgie Russel) to show up!  The rest of the cast includes Harry Carey JR, Claude Jarman, Eddie Firestone, Slim Pickens, and even Dick Sargent of Bewitched fame in a small part.  All around, a really good cast.The DVD has a very cleaned up widescreen presentation that looks great, especially with the filming locations.  I was somehwat disappointed in the special features department because Disney is usually so good with their DVD releases.  No special features are added here.  Don't let that change your mind though, The Great Locomotive Chase is an exciting Civil War adventure that is exciting from beginning to end!",4,Exciting Disney movie based on a true story,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,2433,"['Based', 'true', 'events', 'Great', 'Locomotive', 'Chase', 'Disney', 'movie', 'never', 'gotten', 'recognition', 'others', 'notably', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'series', 'exciting', 'well-told', 'story', 'incident', 'Civil', 'War', 'James', 'Andrews', 'Union', 'spy', 'who', 'loyalty', 'South', 'working', 'blockade', 'runner', 'Andrews', 'asked', 'Union', 'general', 'reporting', 'undertake', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'small', 'group', 'men', 'get', 'Confederate', 'lines', 'steal', 'locomotive', 'race', 'back', 'safety', 'tearing', 'up', 'track', 'burning', 'bridges', 'way', 'so', 'Confederate', 'reinforcements', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'up', 'lines', 'upcoming', 'attack', 'Confederates', 'right', 'tail', 'can', 'make', 'back', 'was', 'short', 'movie', 'about', '85', 'minutes', 'first', '20-25', 'minutes', 'one', 'extended', 'chase', 'scene', 'exciting', 'way', 'end', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'little', 'kids', 'are', 'watching', ""n't"", 'typical', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', 'benefits', 'locations', 'Georgia', 'North', 'Carolina', 'same', 'areas', 'seen', 'DC', 'movies', 'train', 'footage', 'excellent', 'Definitely', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'Less', 'year', 'wrapping', 'up', 'five-part', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Disneyland', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'James', 'Andrews', 'leader', 'small', 'group', 'raiders', 'trying', 'complete', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Think', 'more', 'formal', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'character', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'very', 'good', 'William', 'Fuller', 'train', 'conductor', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'raiders', 'race', 'safety', 'John', 'Lupton', 'good', 'William', 'Pittenger', 'most', 'visible', 'Andrews', 'raiders', 'who', 'almost', 'second-in-command', 'Fans', 'Disney', 'movies', 'will', 'appreciate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jeff', 'York', 'Kenneth', 'Tobey', 'Don', 'Megowan', 'kept', 'waiting', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'Georgie', 'Russel', 'show', 'up', 'rest', 'cast', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'JR', 'Claude', 'Jarman', 'Eddie', 'Firestone', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'even', 'Dick', 'Sargent', 'Bewitched', 'fame', 'small', 'part', 'around', 'really', 'good', 'cast.The', 'DVD', 'very', 'cleaned', 'up', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'great', 'especially', 'filming', 'locations', 'was', 'somehwat', 'disappointed', 'special', 'features', 'department', 'Disney', 'usually', 'so', 'good', 'DVD', 'releases', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'added', 'here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'change', 'mind', 'Great', 'Locomotive', 'Chase', 'exciting', 'Civil', 'War', 'adventure', 'exciting', 'beginning', 'end']",The Great Locomotive Chase VHS

The fact that it was Disney seemed like a plus, although I was doubtful about Fess Parker.The pros for me is that there is a lot of authentic looking Civil War era locomotives and rolling stock in the movie. Fess Parker is good, if not too understated in his role. He is not a Davy Crockett type at all, which is what I feared.The cons are that the movie is slow to start and that, after finally revving up and getting to get somewhere, it runs out of steam (yes, I said that tired, old cliche) just when it is getting good. Well, history does that at times, I guess. I think the movie could have been written better (this out of someone who has never written a movie script, much less an historical movie script).My trouble was one of expectations. I remembered more action and more train chase scenes. Perhaps I was remembering the Buster Keaton movie instead.I'm glad that I have the movie because of the train footage.

417130,A34D6AG428SRQK,6304368801,V. Dixon,"[1, 1]","Just like all the old Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone tales the Great Locomotive Chase makes history fun and entertaining.  Quite accurate historically and easy to watch this movie may actually get your kids interested in history! And somehow manages to be unbiased--a very rare feat in civil war movies indeed!! The determination and zeal of the men on both sides is evident. Like Davy at the Alamo, we hate to know Mr. Andrews ultimate fate but the tenacity and heroics of the conductor, William Fuller, to regain his train after it had been stolen is nothing short of remarkable. Made in an innocent time, where events played out as they happened, when political correctness wasn't even heard of, and our heros taught by example.",5,Disney Does It Again !,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,731,"['Just', 'old', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Daniel', 'Boone', 'Great', 'Locomotive', 'Chase', 'history', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'Quite', 'accurate', 'historically', 'easy', 'watch', 'movie', 'may', 'actually', 'get', 'kids', 'interested', 'history', 'somehow', 'manages', 'be', 'unbiased', 'very', 'rare', 'feat', 'civil', 'war', 'movies', 'indeed', 'determination', 'zeal', 'men', 'sides', 'evident', 'Davy', 'Alamo', 'hate', 'know', 'Mr.', 'Andrews', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'tenacity', 'heroics', 'conductor', 'William', 'Fuller', 'regain', 'train', 'had', 'been', 'stolen', 'nothing', 'short', 'remarkable', 'Made', 'innocent', 'time', 'where', 'events', 'played', 'out', 'happened', 'when', 'political', 'correctness', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'heros', 'taught', 'example']",The Great Locomotive Chase VHS

Nothing could be further from the truth.Besides having zero....none, nyet....bonus features....not even a trailer, this release is riddled with problems. While the menu and FBI warnings are anamorphic, the movie itself is not. If the transfer had been halfway decent, this would be somewhat forgiveable. However, the transfer is grainy, the color pulses, and edge enhancement is frequent throughout. Certain portions of the movie even appear to be in the wrong ratio....as if the screen were squeezed top to bottom.Another problem I encountered....and basically the last straw....was the random appearance of foreign subtitles as I watched the movie. Whether this is a problem with all DVD players, I do not know [mine is a Toshiba]....but on a quality product, this should never be a problem on any player.While the movie is somewhat enjoyable [typical 50's Disney-style drama], I'd avoid this DVD [wish I HAD] based purely on the lack of effort Disney put out in assembling it.Figures....Disney finally releases some of its movies in their entirety [not the destructive pan &amp; scan], and they still put out a lousy DVD.",1,Review of Disney May 2002 release,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,1270,"['two', 'previous', 'releases', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'one', 'would', 'assume', 'release', 'movie', 'producer', 'Disney', 'would', 'be', 'ultimate', 'issue', 'film', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth.Besides', 'having', 'zero', '.none', 'nyet', '.bonus', 'features', '.not', 'even', 'trailer', 'release', 'riddled', 'problems', 'menu', 'FBI', 'warnings', 'are', 'anamorphic', 'movie', 'not', 'transfer', 'had', 'been', 'halfway', 'decent', 'would', 'be', 'somewhat', 'forgiveable', 'However', 'transfer', 'grainy', 'color', 'edge', 'enhancement', 'frequent', 'Certain', 'portions', 'movie', 'even', 'appear', 'be', 'wrong', 'ratio', '.as', 'screen', 'were', 'squeezed', 'top', 'bottom.Another', 'problem', 'encountered', '.and', 'basically', 'last', 'straw', 'random', 'appearance', 'foreign', 'subtitles', 'watched', 'movie', 'problem', 'DVD', 'players', 'do', 'not', 'know', '[', 'mine', 'Toshiba', ']', '.but', 'quality', 'product', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'problem', 'player.While', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', '[', 'typical', '50', 'Disney-style', 'drama', ']', ""'d"", 'avoid', 'DVD', '[', 'wish', 'HAD', ']', 'based', 'purely', 'lack', 'effort', 'Disney', 'put', 'out', 'assembling', 'it.Figures', '.Disney', 'finally', 'movies', 'entirety', 'not', 'destructive', 'pan', 'amp', 'scan', ']', 'still', 'put', 'out', 'lousy', 'DVD']",The Great Locomotive Chase VHS
