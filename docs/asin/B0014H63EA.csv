This, the producers say, was the result of the breakdown of original core Christian beliefs at the rise of the radical Catholic Church.

Additionally, this is made by a highly prolific writer.  Considering the obscurity of the information contained within, I am somewhat concerned about whether true diligence and an un-biased approach were used.  The tendency with this type of material is for an author to get an idea and then build a case around it, regardless of whether the pieces really check out as fact.This is the kind of material I would not take too seriously unless I could see it in print, verify a list of sources, and then do follow-up for myself.",3,"A fun review, but need to be careful",1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,645,"['movie', 'well', 'made', 'easy', 'follow', 'only', 'concern', 'information', 'hard', 'verify', 'Additionally', 'made', 'highly', 'prolific', 'writer', 'Considering', 'obscurity', 'information', 'contained', 'am', 'somewhat', 'concerned', 'true', 'diligence', 'un-biased', 'approach', 'were', 'used', 'tendency', 'type', 'material', 'author', 'get', 'idea', 'then', 'build', 'case', 'regardless', 'pieces', 'really', 'check', 'out', 'fact.This', 'kind', 'material', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'could', 'see', 'print', 'verify', 'list', 'sources', 'then', 'do', 'follow-up']",Order of the Alchemists

An order contemporary with the Knights Templar yet much less well known, the Knights of Malta and Cagliostro battled against the Ottoman forces and was later embroiled in the alchemical domain of the Grand Master. Who were these Knights, who gave them their authority, and what was their role in world history? Highlighted by computer-generated reconstructions and exclusive footage filmed in the Order's Sacra Infirmeria, among other historic European locations, The Order of the Alchemists is a singularly fascinating look into an ancient group's dedication to the twin arts of war and metaphysical studies.",5,A singularly fascinating look,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,831,"['Order', 'Alchemists', 'Knights', 'Malta', 'Cagliostro', 'DVD', 'uncovering', 'mysterious', 'history', 'Sovereign', 'Military', 'Order', 'Malta', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'occult', 'nefarious', 'forces', 'work', 'order', 'contemporary', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'yet', 'much', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'Knights', 'Malta', 'Cagliostro', 'battled', 'Ottoman', 'forces', 'was', 'later', 'embroiled', 'alchemical', 'domain', 'Grand', 'Master', 'Who', 'were', 'Knights', 'who', 'gave', 'authority', 'what', 'was', 'role', 'world', 'history', 'Highlighted', 'computer-generated', 'reconstructions', 'exclusive', 'footage', 'filmed', 'Order', 'Sacra', 'Infirmeria', 'other', 'historic', 'European', 'locations', 'Order', 'Alchemists', 'singularly', 'fascinating', 'look', 'ancient', 'group', 'dedication', 'twin', 'arts', 'war', 'metaphysical', 'studies']",Order of the Alchemists
