But having enjoyed the shows and those snippets, I was excited to see this collection of old jokes when it was released years ago, as he was supposedly retiring all of his old material.  And this became an instant favorite in our house.The opening sequence, a fake funeral where his old jokes are buried in a casket surrounded by a bunch of famous comedians, was cheesy and unnecessary.  But once Seinfeld got on stage, he's laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish.  One sure sign of good comedy is its ability to elicit laughter even when the audience knows the punch lines before they are spoken.  Having watched this show many times, I remember most of the jokes in advance.  Yet, I laugh constantly.  His writing is brilliant.  His delivery is perfect.  It never stoops to low-brow, sophomoric junk.  It's classic stuff.Whenever we are inspired to rewatch this disc, it never disappoints.

508166,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00000JWVS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[39, 40]","Jerry Seinfeld is just plain funny, although his brand of humor probably doesn't appeal to some people.  He uses some of the most mundane things in life for his material, yet I somehow consider him to possess an intellectual sort of humor.  The Seinfeld you get in this performance is basically the same Seinfeld Americans laughed with on television for nine years.  A lot of the jokes are familiar, and even those that aren't tend to sound as if they are.  I don't think every joke was delivered perfectly in this show, but the consistency of the humor from start to finish is undeniable.  The opening is a pretty good one, featuring Seinfeld burying all of his old comedy material in a coffin while some of comedy's big names mourn their loss.  Onstage, he jokes about a myriad of topics including airport security, New York cab drivers, old folks in Florida, grocery stores, doctors and medicine, horses, etc.  Naturally, there is some material on men and women and the differences between them.  While there are a couple of jokes with a somewhat mature theme, by and large Seinfeld's comedy can be enjoyed by young and old alike.  The segment about trick-or-treating as a kid and being driven by a constant need for candy would be my pick of the litter in terms of inherent laughs.It really doesn't matter that much if you've already heard these jokes along the way-who hasn't heard the infomercial/Ginsu knife bit before?  Seinfeld's delivery makes you want to laugh no matter what.  I was a little surprised at the end, though.  I was expecting a big joke to end the night with, and then out of the blue Seinfeld thanked the audience and wandered offstage.  Naturally, he does make an encore appearance, this type agreeing to answer questions hurled at him from the audience.  I enjoyed this segment to some degree, but it wasn't as funny as a few more minutes of scripted comedy would have been.  It also seemed rather choppy because it necessarily had to have some filler and dead spots edited out for continuity.This one is really pretty simple: if you were a fan of Seinfeld's television show and delight in his quirky kind of humor, you will certainly enjoy this tape and will no doubt want to watch it on more than one occasion.",4,Classic Seinfeld humor,1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,2240,"['Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'brand', 'humor', 'probably', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'people', 'most', 'mundane', 'things', 'life', 'material', 'somehow', 'consider', 'possess', 'intellectual', 'sort', 'humor', 'Seinfeld', 'get', 'performance', 'basically', 'same', 'Seinfeld', 'Americans', 'laughed', 'television', 'nine', 'years', 'lot', 'jokes', 'are', 'familiar', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'tend', 'sound', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'joke', 'was', 'delivered', 'perfectly', 'show', 'consistency', 'humor', 'start', 'finish', 'undeniable', 'opening', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'featuring', 'Seinfeld', 'burying', 'old', 'comedy', 'material', 'coffin', 'comedy', 'big', 'names', 'mourn', 'loss', 'Onstage', 'myriad', 'topics', 'including', 'airport', 'security', 'New', 'York', 'cab', 'drivers', 'old', 'folks', 'Florida', 'grocery', 'stores', 'doctors', 'medicine', 'horses', 'etc', 'Naturally', 'material', 'men', 'women', 'differences', 'are', 'couple', 'jokes', 'somewhat', 'mature', 'theme', 'large', 'Seinfeld', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'segment', 'about', 'trick-or-treating', 'kid', 'being', 'driven', 'constant', 'need', 'candy', 'would', 'be', 'pick', 'litter', 'terms', 'inherent', 'laughs.It', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'that', 'much', ""'ve"", 'already', 'heard', 'jokes', 'way-who', ""n't"", 'heard', 'infomercial/Ginsu', 'knife', 'bit', 'Seinfeld', 'delivery', 'want', 'laugh', 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'end', 'was', 'expecting', 'big', 'joke', 'end', 'night', 'then', 'blue', 'Seinfeld', 'thanked', 'audience', 'wandered', 'offstage', 'Naturally', 'make', 'encore', 'appearance', 'type', 'agreeing', 'answer', 'questions', 'hurled', 'audience', 'enjoyed', 'segment', 'degree', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'few', 'more', 'minutes', 'scripted', 'comedy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'also', 'seemed', 'rather', 'choppy', 'necessarily', 'had', 'have', 'filler', 'dead', 'spots', 'edited', 'out', 'continuity.This', 'one', 'really', 'pretty', 'simple', 'were', 'fan', 'Seinfeld', 'television', 'show', 'delight', 'quirky', 'kind', 'humor', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'tape', 'will', 'doubt', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'one', 'occasion']",Jerry Seinfeld Live on Broadway: I'm Telling You for the Last Time

Full stop. The genius of the inter-linked, completely inconsequential plots were  hilarious, and I would have thought that the selfish and egotistical  characters would have caught on over here because we like our sitcoms dark  and twisted. Instead, rubbish like Friends gets the top slots in the  ratings. That's the BBC scheduling for you.  This DVD is a fine testament  to Seinfeld, and even though I had the CD I had to get the DVD because it's  about one of the only Seinfeld shows on retail (where's the series?).

There are some jokes which are not as great as the others, but these are few and very far between. It's not an impassioned performance by any means, but that is just not Jerry's style. He has a dryish sense of humour and is seldom animated. One thing for sure though is that Jerry is wickedly funny. His sarcastic style is somewhat innocent but excrutiatingly funny. It is almost socratic the manner in which Jerry pleads ignorance before poking fun at most human behaviours that we take no notice of. My favourite jokes are the ones on supermarkets and expiry dates on milk. The one about seedless watermelon is a classic. How about the knife that can cut through a shoe?!!!Jerry's delivery is always smooth and perfectly timed. His facial expression (and lack thereof sometimes) adds to the depth of the joke. The material speaks for itself. He handles his material very well. His transitions are smooth and not forced. He speaks clearly and is easy to understand.

508176,A245FDGAV2C3KW,B00000JWVS,Jonathan Musere,"[1, 1]","Jerry Seinfeld in his DVD ""I'm Telling You for the Last Time"" (1998) delivers as a consummate comedian. Seinfeld has the unique ability to see complexity and detail in supposedly simplistic everyday life and things. These include aspects like airflight traveling, cab drivers, airport bathrooms, doctors and waiting rooms, grocery stores, elderly folks in Florida, McDonalds, horses, and so much more. What is seemingly irrelevant and unnoticeable, is what Seinfeld can turn into jokes, and simultaneously keep the audience laughing and pondering, and talking about it the next day. Because much of what he portrays is based on common daily circumstances, Seinfeld's comedy is largely timeless. He certainly comes across as a meticulous master observer, one who gathers up unnoticeable and ignored detail in everyday life, and transmits this through comedy. Here are bits of Seinfeld humor. ""Airline peanut bags are too small, dig?...so are airline booze bottles and bathrooms."" ""When people go to the store they can never remember if they have enough milk."" ""New York cabbies are bad smelling foreigners and airport security guards are too fat.""Notably, Seinfeld loves the short Question-Answer technique. He asks the audience, why this and this happens, and while they laugh at the seemingly simple yet intriguing question, he offers an answer that people would not expect, sending the audience into a frenzy of uncontrollable laughter. Example: ""Dogs are broke all their lives. You know why they have no money? No pockets. They see change on the street--there's nothing they can do about it."" Not to mention, most of Seinfeld's jokes are fresh. Furthermore, profanity does not exist in his routine, something he is so much credited for, given the significant employment of profanity by many comedians. Look at more of Seinfeld's comedy: ""I'm going to tell you the secret of the male mind---all men think of themselves as low-level superheroes.""Jerry Seinfeld is remarkably comfortable on stage. He starts his joke routine casually then digs in with mostly fresh material. His appeal also has to do with his humility, calmness and ease, as well as genuine appreciation for his audience, all this despite the high level of success with his television show. Seinfeld even allows for audience questions, an aspect quite rare among comedians. Seinfeld is genuinely touched when the audience gives him a standing ovation whether at the beginning of or at the end of his set. Both on TV and stage, Seinfeld is a highly skillful comedian. The combination of his TV show (that ran for an impressive 9 years) and the stage performances build him into a much greater performer. The TV show offers more flexibility and body expression, whereas Seinfeld demonstrates far less facial expressions in the stage acts. Nevertheless, Seinfeld dramatizes that comedy can come across plainly but excellently without the employment of grotesque facial expressions that many comedians are known for.While using some of the most mundane things in life for his material, he still possesses and transmits an intellectual form of humor. The Seinfeld performing on the DVD is quite  the same as the television Seinfeld. Many of the jokes are familiar, and even those that are not tend to sound like they are. That Seinfeld is also consistent in the humor from start to finish is undeniable. Further, Seinfeld tends to appeal to quite a wide audience, that transcends gender and even age to some extent, just as long as this audience is in tune with his intellectual oriented humor. Some of his jokes do have a mature backdrop, but overall Seinfeld's comedy can be enjoyed by both young and old. A good example that gathers a wide breadth of laughs is the segment about trick-or-treating as a child and drive toward a constant need for candy. Much of Seinfeld's presentation is about Seinfeld's writing ability combined with physical representations of the off-the-wall characters he has met.",4,"Seinfeld, Jerry",1192320000,"10 14, 2007",2007,3966,"['Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'Telling', 'Last', 'Time', '1998', 'delivers', 'consummate', 'comedian', 'Seinfeld', 'unique', 'ability', 'see', 'complexity', 'detail', 'supposedly', 'simplistic', 'everyday', 'life', 'things', 'include', 'aspects', 'airflight', 'traveling', 'cab', 'drivers', 'airport', 'bathrooms', 'doctors', 'waiting', 'rooms', 'grocery', 'stores', 'elderly', 'folks', 'Florida', 'McDonalds', 'horses', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'What', 'seemingly', 'irrelevant', 'unnoticeable', 'what', 'Seinfeld', 'can', 'turn', 'jokes', 'simultaneously', 'keep', 'audience', 'laughing', 'pondering', 'talking', 'next', 'day', 'much', 'what', 'based', 'common', 'daily', 'circumstances', 'Seinfeld', 'comedy', 'largely', 'timeless', 'certainly', 'across', 'meticulous', 'master', 'observer', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'unnoticeable', 'ignored', 'detail', 'everyday', 'life', 'comedy', 'Here', 'are', 'bits', 'Seinfeld', 'humor', 'Airline', 'peanut', 'bags', 'are', 'too', 'small', 'dig', 'so', 'are', 'airline', 'booze', 'bottles', 'bathrooms', 'When', 'people', 'go', 'store', 'can', 'never', 'remember', 'have', 'enough', 'milk', 'New', 'York', 'cabbies', 'are', 'bad', 'smelling', 'foreigners', 'airport', 'security', 'guards', 'are', 'too', 'fat', 'Notably', 'Seinfeld', 'short', 'Question-Answer', 'technique', 'audience', 'why', 'laugh', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'yet', 'intriguing', 'question', 'answer', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'sending', 'audience', 'frenzy', 'uncontrollable', 'laughter', 'Example', 'Dogs', 'are', 'broke', 'lives', 'know', 'why', 'have', 'money', 'pockets', 'see', 'change', 'street', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'Not', 'mention', 'most', 'Seinfeld', 'jokes', 'are', 'fresh', 'Furthermore', 'profanity', 'not', 'exist', 'routine', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'credited', 'given', 'significant', 'employment', 'profanity', 'many', 'comedians', 'Look', 'more', 'Seinfeld', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'going', 'tell', 'secret', 'male', 'mind', '-all', 'men', 'think', 'low-level', 'superheroes', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'remarkably', 'comfortable', 'stage', 'joke', 'routine', 'casually', 'then', 'mostly', 'fresh', 'material', 'appeal', 'also', 'do', 'humility', 'calmness', 'ease', 'as', 'well', 'genuine', 'appreciation', 'audience', 'high', 'level', 'success', 'television', 'show', 'Seinfeld', 'even', 'audience', 'questions', 'aspect', 'quite', 'rare', 'comedians', 'Seinfeld', 'genuinely', 'touched', 'when', 'audience', 'standing', 'ovation', 'beginning', 'end', 'set', 'TV', 'stage', 'Seinfeld', 'highly', 'skillful', 'comedian', 'combination', 'TV', 'show', 'ran', 'impressive', '9', 'years', 'stage', 'performances', 'build', 'much', 'greater', 'performer', 'TV', 'show', 'more', 'flexibility', 'body', 'expression', 'whereas', 'Seinfeld', 'far', 'less', 'facial', 'expressions', 'stage', 'Nevertheless', 'Seinfeld', 'comedy', 'can', 'come', 'plainly', 'excellently', 'employment', 'grotesque', 'facial', 'expressions', 'many', 'comedians', 'are', 'known', 'for.While', 'using', 'most', 'mundane', 'things', 'life', 'material', 'still', 'intellectual', 'form', 'humor', 'Seinfeld', 'performing', 'DVD', 'quite', 'same', 'television', 'Seinfeld', 'Many', 'jokes', 'are', 'familiar', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'tend', 'sound', 'are', 'Seinfeld', 'also', 'consistent', 'humor', 'start', 'finish', 'undeniable', 'Further', 'Seinfeld', 'appeal', 'quite', 'wide', 'audience', 'gender', 'even', 'age', 'extent', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'audience', 'tune', 'intellectual', 'oriented', 'humor', 'jokes', 'do', 'have', 'mature', 'backdrop', 'overall', 'Seinfeld', 'comedy', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'young', 'old', 'good', 'example', 'wide', 'breadth', 'laughs', 'segment', 'about', 'trick-or-treating', 'child', 'drive', 'constant', 'need', 'candy', 'Much', 'Seinfeld', 'presentation', 'Seinfeld', 'writing', 'ability', 'combined', 'physical', 'representations', 'off-the-wall', 'characters', 'met']",Jerry Seinfeld Live on Broadway: I'm Telling You for the Last Time
508177,AZFSJNYKDHIGZ,B00000JWVS,Kelvin J. Dickinson,"[0, 0]","LIVE: FROM MY AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEWSI wasn't a particular fan of Jerry Seinfeld before I watched this standup DVD. I also wasn't aware of its status as a final and finely-tuned performance of classic material. As far as I was concerned, I purchased on a whim and had little idea if it would be any good at all...Well, that's where the negative statements end. 'Live on Broadway' is simply brilliant. I laughed SO much. Seinfeld's material may be 'old' but his delivery, timing and sensitivity to keeping it fresh is a marvel. Not one f-word in the entire show, either. Now, as someone who is generally tolerant of such things, I was deeply impressed by that. And also as a writer, it actually reinforced my belief that you don't need to rely on strong language to get a laugh. Yes, it'll generate a cheap laugh, now and again - as evidenced by many of today's top performers who still go at it like there's no tomorrow. But the question remains, would their jokes be any less funny without? Hmm, maybe best not to speculate on that. Whatever the case, Jerry Seinfeld must rank as one of the great contemporary standup comedians of recent years, even for just daring to be different.As with all observational comedy it's often the most mundane, mind-numbing subjects that can ellicit the strongest reactions - airports, hotels and taxis spring readily to mind, the sorts of places where feelings of deep depression are only a moodswing away - but Seinfeld grabs them all and does a makeover so sharp, so precisely funny, it's like someone popping a balloon in your face. A tour-de-force of genuine wit - the best kind, and that's because his material's so good.Don't confuse a lack of courseness to mean that this is just a kids show, however. Far from it. There's some good old adult material woven in here and there, but it's so finely judged that it comes across as neither demeaning nor gratuitous, just plain entertaining. Again, it's a skill that's largely absent from even the most respected routines. Proof that if you try hard enough, orgasms don't necessarily have to make you cringe.'Live on Broadway: I'm Telling You for the Last Time'...a wonderful lesson in observation and a treat for anyone who likes standup comedy at its finest.

508179,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00000JWVS,Michael Crane,"[20, 20]","Jerry Seinfeld is one of those comedians that really stands out from the rest, meaning that there's literally NO ONE else who could do the kind of material he does and get the same response from the crowds.  &quot;I'm Telling You for the Last Time&quot; is an outstanding comedic performance from the one and only, Jerry Seinfeld.This is the last time that Seinfeld performs his most-known material.  He talks about air travel, cab drivers, candy, doctors and waiting rooms, McDonald's, airport/airplane bathrooms, and so much more.  This is the golden material that made Seinfeld's career, and he appropriately performs them for the last time.As I said in the beginning of the review, there's literally nobody in the business that could ever duplicate Jerry's material and get the same response from it.  The material was made for Seinfeld, and that's why it works so well.  He's able to point out some of the most irrelevant or unnoticeable things in society and bring them into the spotlight.  Subtlety plays a major role in Jerry's performances.The DVD also includes a bio on Jerry Seinfeld and a &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; segment that was never aired.  The picture quality looks exceptionally good and the DVD does it justice.  Running time of the live performance is around 75 minutes.&quot;I'm Telling You for the Last Time&quot; is an amazing performance by an amazing comic.  Although it is sad to see him retire the material that made his career, it's nice to see that he is moving on and working on new bits.  He knows when to move on and not just build a career around old material for your whole life.  I admire that most about him.

This is a brilliant look into why Seinfeld became so phenomenally popular in the first place: he is the true master of wry observations about everyday life. Seinfeld more than any other comedian has the knack to observe real-world events that are common knowledge to virtually everyone (cab rides, airport security, pharmacists, etc.) and find the darkly funny side of the scenario that we can all relate to. I am an airline employee, and his observations about the sad state of our industry are right on the mark; that's the beauty of Jerry's comedy, though: everyone can laugh, even at themselves.This particular performance is utterly brilliant. Fans of the television show will note that several of his routines became major plot points in the series. Seinfeld delivers classic observations that are as funny the tenth time as they are the first.The introduction is well done with well known comedians present at a funeral to bury Jerry's jokes (""I'm telling you for the last time!"") The cameos by people like Robert Klein, Ed McMahon, and Jay Leno are great, but watching Garry Shandling try to steal Jerry's cast-off jokes is a true delight.This performance is a 75 minute joy to watch.
