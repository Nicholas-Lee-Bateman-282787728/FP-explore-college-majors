1198697,AU6DTF15U4J27,B001GTXZOM,BeeTee,"[28, 28]","Despite my obsessive dvr-ing of Waking the Dead on BBCAmerica, I somehow missed season three. All I have to say is ""Wow!"" This is such a fantastic season of this series. There isn't an ""off"" episode in season three. I will agree with a previous reviewer that the two-part episode ""Walking on Water"" is just outstanding; probably my favorite so far, maybe ever. I really recommend Season Three if you haven't seen it. This show is just fantastic.As a (hopefully) helpful aside for fans of this series: Further seasons of this great series aren't currently available from the US Amazon, but you can get Seasons Four, Five, and Six from Amazon.co.uk. The prices on entire seasons are currently 11 ($16)-12 ($17) each, which is pretty fantastic. Shipping wasn't too bad either. With the pound being weaker against the dollar, now might be the time to order. If you haven't ever ordered from Amazon.co.uk, your same log-in and password will work. You will need a multi-region player as these are Region 2 and will not play on standard American players. Amazon carries some Phillips brand multiregion players for anywhere from $50-$75, right now. I hope this information is helpful to other fans of this fantastic show!",5,Seriously good season of this excellent series!,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,1213,"['obsessive', 'dvr-ing', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'BBCAmerica', 'somehow', 'missed', 'season', 'three', 'have', 'say', 'Wow', 'such', 'fantastic', 'season', 'series', ""n't"", 'off', 'episode', 'season', 'three', 'will', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'two-part', 'episode', 'Walking', 'Water', 'just', 'outstanding', 'probably', 'favorite', 'so', 'far', 'maybe', 'ever', 'really', 'recommend', 'Season', 'Three', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'just', 'fantastic.As', 'hopefully', 'helpful', 'aside', 'fans', 'series', 'Further', 'seasons', 'great', 'series', 'are', ""n't"", 'currently', 'available', 'US', 'Amazon', 'can', 'get', 'Seasons', 'Four', 'Five', 'Six', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'prices', 'entire', 'seasons', 'are', 'currently', '11', '16', '-12', '17', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'Shipping', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'either', 'pound', 'being', 'weaker', 'dollar', 'now', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'order', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'ordered', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'same', 'log-in', 'password', 'will', 'work', 'will', 'need', 'multi-region', 'player', 'are', 'Region', '2', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'standard', 'American', 'players', 'Amazon', 'Phillips', 'brand', 'multiregion', 'players', 'anywhere', '50-', '75', 'right', 'now', 'hope', 'information', 'helpful', 'other', 'fans', 'fantastic', 'show']",Waking the Dead: Season 3

1198701,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B001GTXZOM,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[4, 4]","Season three (3) of ""Waking the Dead"" certainly kept me on ""the edge of my seat"" trying to anticipate the outcomes and the guilty parties of each of the four (4) episodes on two (2) discs with each episode being in two (2) parts with each part running over an hour.  Season three (3) is really a very good British ""Cold Case"" detective/mystery program. While viewing Season three (3), I found it to be very difficult (if not impossible) for me to pre-determine the outcomes of each episode until ""all was revealed"" at the end of each show.  There are no ""easy"" obvious cases this season.  No ""spoon feeding"" of clues to the viewing audience with no obvious outcomes.  All of the elements of this series seem to really have ""come together"" in a very marvelous way in this season.  Those elements being the acting, the direction and, most of all, the writing are simply fantastic!The ""Cold Case"" unit of this series is comprised of a Psychological Profiler (played greatly by Sue Johnston), three detectives and a pathologist with one of the detectives (played wonderfully by Trevor Eve) being the Unit's leader.  ALL of the actors are superb.  As I have said in my review of Season two(2) of this series, what I really adore about this series is that all of the members of the  Unit are ""experts"" in their profession and are not afraid to disagree with the Unit's leader (played by Eve); therefore, there can be major disagreements and ""battles"".  This season the actors certainly seem to be really ""into"" each of their role without one ""weak link"".  My god, they all are very good.  Of course, all of this greatness in this show, to me, has to be attributable to the fabulous scripts.The stories of each episode in Season three (3) are simply fantastic.  They all are so well written.  I too particularly loved the episode entitled ""Walk on Water"". That episode had me biting my nails.  In fact, I could not stop watching this season until I had viewed all of the episodes.  This season is so great; I loved it.By the way, I must add that I really feel that this series is for adults with mature minds.  I used the subtitles not because of hearing problems but to catch the superb well written mature dialog.",5,ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,2208,"['Season', 'three', '3', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'certainly', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'trying', 'anticipate', 'outcomes', 'guilty', 'parties', 'four', '4', 'episodes', 'two', '2', 'discs', 'episode', 'being', 'two', '2', 'parts', 'part', 'running', 'over', 'hour', 'Season', 'three', '3', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'British', 'Cold', 'Case', 'detective/mystery', 'program', 'viewing', 'Season', 'three', '3', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'pre-determine', 'outcomes', 'episode', 'was', 'revealed', 'end', 'show', 'are', 'easy', 'obvious', 'cases', 'season', 'No', 'spoon', 'feeding', 'clues', 'viewing', 'audience', 'obvious', 'outcomes', 'elements', 'series', 'seem', 'really', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'very', 'marvelous', 'way', 'season', 'elements', 'being', 'acting', 'direction', 'most', 'writing', 'are', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'Cold', 'Case', 'unit', 'series', 'comprised', 'Psychological', 'Profiler', 'played', 'greatly', 'Sue', 'Johnston', 'three', 'detectives', 'pathologist', 'one', 'detectives', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Trevor', 'Eve', 'being', 'Unit', 'leader', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'have', 'said', 'review', 'Season', 'two', '2', 'series', 'what', 'really', 'adore', 'series', 'members', 'Unit', 'are', 'experts', 'profession', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'disagree', 'Unit', 'leader', 'played', 'Eve', 'therefore', 'can', 'be', 'major', 'disagreements', 'battles', 'season', 'actors', 'certainly', 'seem', 'be', 'really', 'role', 'one', 'weak', 'link', 'My', 'god', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'course', 'greatness', 'show', 'be', 'attributable', 'fabulous', 'scripts.The', 'stories', 'episode', 'Season', 'three', '3', 'are', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'too', 'particularly', 'loved', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Walk', 'Water', 'episode', 'had', 'biting', 'nails', 'fact', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', 'season', 'had', 'viewed', 'episodes', 'season', 'so', 'great', 'loved', 'it.By', 'way', 'must', 'add', 'really', 'feel', 'series', 'adults', 'mature', 'minds', 'used', 'subtitles', 'not', 'hearing', 'problems', 'catch', 'superb', 'well', 'written', 'mature', 'dialog']",Waking the Dead: Season 3

1198711,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001GTXZOM,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","""Waking the Dead Season 3""is an entry in the acclaimed British mystery television series that ran from 2000-2007, when it was axed by the British Broadcasting Corporation  in favor of `newer, more innovative crime dramas.'  It played for some time on BBCAmerica on my side of the pond. It is a strongly -cast and -written ---by Barbara Machin, a woman, yay! -- police procedural/crime drama that follows Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd and his multi-discipline cold-case unit consisting of scientists and a psychologist as well as detectives  at the Metropolitan Police. The squad utilizes the latest advances in forensic science, psychological profiling of the unknown criminal perpetrators and other modern investigative techniques to crack unsolved murders.Upon even initial viewing, its differences from similar-sounding American TV series are great.  The cop shop is anything but new and shiny, and poorly lit compared to American series that all seem to have been filmed on a sunny Southern California set.  The actors aren't shiny and new, either.  Trevor Eve, (Heat of the Sun Boxed Set (Private Lives / Hide in Plain Sight / The Sport of Kings)) who plays Boyd, began his career as beefcake, but he's older now, showing how thoughtfully he's aged, but still very watchable.  He's backed, in the cop shop, by Sue Johnston as Dr. Grace Foley;, Wil Johnson, as DI Spencer Jordan; Holly Aird as Dr. Frankie Wharton; Claire Goose, as DS Amelia (Mel) Silver, and Tara Fitgerald (The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,Hear My Song [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom] ) as Dr. Eve Lockhart. All of them are very good actors, and not one of them is a beautiful young blond.  The series also used a number of excellent older British actors such as Shirley Anne Field (Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, HEAR MY SONG); Tom Bell(The L-Shaped Room [Region 2]), and the late director of offbeat films, Ken Russell (The Lair of the White Worm). The show is violent, intense and suspenseful; plots are intricate and complex: there's always something going on.  The episodes are:Disc 1.  ""Multistorey, Parts 1 and 2.  Did the nerdy Carl McKenzie, who was arrested red-handed in the car park, reallykill 14 people on the White Water High Street?  Including one, Nick Patterson, a cop friend of Boyd's, and that with his own gun?""Walking on Water, Parts 1 and 2."" A young man, a cross-dresser, is released from prison after serving time for killing his adoptive father.  But did he really?  And how does it happen that three women are still missing from this fishing-oriented family since that murder?  I found this a particularly strong episode years ago, still remembered some of it; set in the heavily tidal Thames estuary.Disc 2.  ""Breaking Glass, Parts 1 and 2."" A particularly complex plot that gives Boyd a social worker, Miss Poole. To bounce off.  Unravels the history of a juvenile institution that has been closed.""Final Cut, Parts 1 and 2.""  Long-hidden, mummified bodies come to light.  Very complex, and particularly involving, I thought, as it explores London's Jamaican community, and the important father/son relationship of DI Spencer Jordan.  Another one I've remembered for a long time.Solid and workmanlike this series surely is, but it's much more than that; it makes for riveting viewing.
