495265,A1X7K2E0H9T319,B000009O8A,A Customer,"[2, 3]","This 1978 sexploitation flick written and directed by Meir Zarchi offered a strong commentary on feminism and sexuality. Starring Camille Keaton, the granddaughter of my personal hero Buster Keaton, as a young writer who rents a country cottage for a summer to have the solitude necessary to finally make her stab at writing the great American novel. Unfortunately, she runs into a small group of small town redneck degenerates, who quite brutally beat and repeatedly rape and torture her. Left alone to deal with the trauma, and without any resources or allies, she has no choice but to take matters into her own hands in a series of shocking acts of vengeance.While the prolonged brutality of the rape scenes are indeed hard to watch, knowing that this movie has always garnered demeaning attentions is almost as vulgar. This is a damn good film, regardless of the realism of its violence and psychological turmoil. Keaton is very beautiful in a plain, easily identifiable way, thereby getting extra sympathy from pre-programmed Western audiences. And her bravery in undertaking such a performance where she is naked and bloody for much of her screen time is a statement to her credibility as an actress and an artist. While the victimization is painstakingly real, as I have seen myself through my own activities in the cause of Domestic Violence Awareness, the inadvertent heroine's responses are sadly unreal, although hopefully have and will serve as inspiration to any victims of assault lacking empowerment.I understand there has been a more recent remake, but being a traditionalist I always prefer the originals. I Spit On Your Grave is a true cult classic, and when viewed in mixed company will lead directly to some interesting debates and commentary.

They either loathe it, or rabidly defend its &quot;artistry&quot;. Well, it  certainly has little to recommend it, unless you enjoy watching a naked  woman being raped, degarded and humiliated for almost a whole hour. Still  interested? The films standpoint as a &quot;revenge&quot; film gets a  little lost after devoting this much time to the rape spectacle, and with  convincing acting by Camille Keaton, it is a harrowing experience for the  viewer. But the revenge? A brief bit of knife waving over a bubble bath,  and all the male movie reviewers are screaming and clutching themselves.  Get real! The male victims in this sleaze-orama are not even good enough  actors for you to care about their fates.

It has what is believed to be the longest rape scene in movie history (approximately a half hour of brutally graphic violence).  It also features a castration scene that caused many theater goers at the time to throw up.  It has been banned in numerous countries, and most professional movie critics have labeled this film one of the worst ever.  I don't agree at all.Camille Keaton does a brilliant job playing a rape victim who ultimately gets brutal revenge against her attackers.  The rapists display the worst possible male qualities and do so in a very believable way.  As a male, I found this a bit nauseating. But as part of the film, it is very effective.The directing and overall cinematography are very well done and (famously) done without a soundtrack.

At the top of the list are LA FEMME NIKITA and THE LAST SEDUCTION.  MS. 45 is a very stylish core collection here.  And so we come to I SPIT  ON YOUR GRAVE.  In a way the most realistic of the bunch (the hillbilly  rapists are incredibly believable, much more than the hillbillies in  DELIVERANCE though not as menacing).  But also the simplest plot.  And yet,  not quite so simple.  We know what our heroine is going to do.  But she  diesn't do it by brute force, she does it by trickery and guile, making the  revenge ever-so-sweeter.  Be prepared for a cheaply produced  movie--stitches appear on our heroine's face even though she didn't see a  doctor, but a couple of days later they are all gone as if they never were  there at all, even though she didn't take time out to go to New York to see  a top plastic surgeon.  All right, so the makeup department was  underbudgeted. And the pace of the movie is a bit slow, perhaps because it  was done way back in 1978, when it was probably fast for those days. Three  stars coming from this cheapskate reviewer is high praise, and I believe  you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie if you don't go in expecting  DELIVERANCE.

495274,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B000009O8A,Anthony Hand,"[8, 8]","It's difficult to compliment or be positive in any way about Meir Zarchi's controversial film, because even though it does come down on the side of the female victim, her ordeal is so distressing and brutal that one feels unclean for choosing to sit down and be a willing observer to it.Most people will be aware that this film is a rape/revenge scenario and probably will be aware that it has courted much outrage since it first shocked audiences in the late 70's, but few people will be privy to the fact that the abuse of Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) goes on for at least the first third of the movie and as such it is an extremely uneasy amount of time for a viewer to sit through. So much so, that when she enacts her revenge, it seems almost standard...a given. In fact it would be difficult to imagine the film if the producers had abandoned to revenge conclusion, as it acts as such a release of the pressure built up by the horrific preceding events.'I Spit on Your Grave' is a title that gained much of it's notoriety from the hysterical ""Video Nasties"" bill that was circulated in Britain in the early 1980's. It appeared alongside movies such as 'Cannibal Holocaust', 'Zombie Flesh Eaters' and 'The Beast in Heat'. But while the majority of the Video Nasties were mere exploitation schlock (that in most cases seem remarkably harmless now), Zarchi's effort has retained it's extremely disturbing atmosphere because unlike the undead of 'Zombie Flesh Eaters', the funny looking Nazi creation in 'The Beast in Heat' and to some degree the outrageous cannibal tribes in 'Cannibal Holocaust', rape and rapists are very real. However, I must say that the rapists in 'I Spit on Your Grave' are such one-dimensional bad guys that it's hard to reconcile them to the real world. That aside, the movie is a story about an event that affects many women (although probably not to the vile extent that Keaton's character goes through).The basic plot is very simple, there is no subtly here. In short form, a young female journalist is abducted while she is on vacation and is subjected to a series of appalling assaults on her person. Afterward, she manages to get herself together and embarks on a brutal revenge against her attackers. The movie is an extremely violent, dirty and utterly depressing experience...and this is actually the project's strong point. I watched this alone one evening and I came away from it feeling awful, feeling dirty and even ashamed. In fact, I could barely bring myself to tell my girlfriend what movie I watched when I was asked.No movie before or after has ever had that effect on me.In some ways, I believe I felt some of the feelings that a rape victim feels after such a disgusting event; dirty, depressed, angry, ashamed and utterly disillusioned with human beings...albeit to a relatively minuscule level admittedly. I could walk away from the DVD, but the experience stayed with me for days afterward. This end-of viewing feeling was certainly the overwhelming result from the 100 minute running time.Although, I personally don't consider 'I Spit on Your Grave' to be an exploitation film, at least not in the same manner as 'Ilse: She wolf of the SS', or the myriad of Cannibal / Zombie flicks, it still suffers from the same weaknesses usually endured by low budget exploitation movies...bad acting, bad dialogue and poor advances in scripting and they take from the film, somewhat inevitably.There also have been some who have attempted to portray 'I Spit on Your Grave' as a ""pro-rape"" fantasy, but I find that very hard to accept. Zarchi presents the attackers as incredibly cruel and without a shred of decency that it's impossible to imagine any viewer siding with their point of view. As difficult as 'I Spit on Your Grave' is to look at, the overall impulse is to identify with the innocent victim. Zarchi, who prefers the more positive title of ""Day of the Woman"" to the sensationalist 'I Spit on Your Grave', has always maintained that he had tried to manifest a ""pro-feminist"" angle with his film and is shocked that some people would think that he (or anyone) would attempt to make a pro-rape movie. This PR spin seems a little naive in the world of pedophile rings and violent internet porn, but such things were unknown when Zarchi set out to make his opus. The director, in fact, claims that he set out to make the film after helping a victim of rape in New York.In conclusion, if you believe you have the stomach for it (and I don't mean that in a macho way) 'I Spit on Your Grave' offers the viewer an experience that no other film will give, if you chose to go down that road.

Now, for the film, I've never seen anything like it before. It's certainly one of the most unusual movies I've seen, right up there with Pink Flamingos and Sleepaway Camp. I consider I Spit on Your Grave the feminine Deliverance version of Death Wish. Camille Keaton gives a very brave, courageous effort to play the role of a woman who had been raped by four men, not all at once, but in four separate times. Not only she is naked, she is practically full-on naked throughout the film. For sure, I Spit on Your Grave is gruesome and degrading as it gets. What's interesting is that Camille Keaton ceased to be a naked person but a thing, all mudded up and discarded. That's a very good acting. The rape is predictable because we know what occurs during it, but I am more interested in the aftermath, especially how Camille Keaton acted in her character's recovery from what had happened. Now, was the revenge next going to be predictable? Not even so. At first, I felt disgusted and shocked in the approaches she took, but the unconventionalism of what she did added more to the notoriety of the cult film it is today. Remember what Charlize Theron did for Monster? What Camille Keaton did is ten times better and is worthy of accolades. I am very surprised how she ran through the woods barefoot. That's tough. Finally, I am not exactly sure if I Spit on Your Grave is a horror movie or not; I know it fits the genre of drama films. All in all, I Spit on Your Grave is a well done picture that deserves a look as a serious raped female picture because Camille Keaton does things what no respected female actress will do.",5,Unique Piece of Work of Art.,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,1751,"['Viewed', '10/12Rate', '910/12', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'catchy', 'title', 'even', 'better', 'Day', 'Woman', 'off', 'weak', 'Now', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'right', 'there', 'Pink', 'Flamingos', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'consider', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'feminine', 'Deliverance', 'version', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'very', 'brave', 'courageous', 'effort', 'play', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'raped', 'four', 'men', 'not', 'once', 'four', 'separate', 'times', 'Not', 'only', 'naked', 'practically', 'full-on', 'naked', 'film', 'sure', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'gruesome', 'degrading', 'What', 'interesting', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'ceased', 'be', 'naked', 'person', 'thing', 'mudded', 'up', 'discarded', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'rape', 'predictable', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'more', 'interested', 'aftermath', 'especially', 'how', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'acted', 'character', 'recovery', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'Now', 'was', 'revenge', 'next', 'going', 'be', 'predictable', 'Not', 'even', 'so', 'first', 'felt', 'disgusted', 'shocked', 'approaches', 'took', 'unconventionalism', 'what', 'did', 'added', 'more', 'notoriety', 'cult', 'film', 'today', 'Remember', 'what', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'did', 'Monster', 'What', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'did', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'worthy', 'accolades', 'am', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'ran', 'woods', 'barefoot', 'tough', 'Finally', 'am', 'not', 'exactly', 'sure', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'know', 'genre', 'drama', 'films', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'well', 'done', 'picture', 'look', 'serious', 'raped', 'female', 'picture', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'things', 'what', 'respected', 'female', 'actress', 'will', 'do']",N/A

It can be used to entertain, but that isn't its only purpose. Art can also be used to get across a message or hold a mirror up to society.  Unfortunately, while serious books and art can treat horrible subjects with great frankness and without entertaining and still receive great praise, movies are stereotypically seen as more of an entertainment medium, so when a movie comes along that doesn't even try to be entertaining, people don't know how to react.This movie is not in the least bit entertaining.  In fact, watching it is a rather horrible experience, but it should be.  Any movie that pretends to treat the subject of rape seriously should be discomforting.  This movie has one of the most powerful depictions of rape I have ever seen.  Other major hollywood films that have tackled the subject of rape, like the one starring Jodie Foster (I forget its name), are lauded for their powerful depictions of rape, but when a more effective, low-budget depiction like this one comes along, one that gets across the horror of the act far more powerfully, it gets dismissed as exploitation.Sure, the cover art is rather exploitative and seems to be geared towards attracting viewers looking for sexual thrills, and the same goes for the trailer, but the film itself is not one bit as exploitative as, say, the Deliverance.  It is an excellent depiction of the brutality of rape, the sexual immaturity of rapists, the cowardly nature of the act, and the fact that it is an act committed by those who usually feel powerless in everyday life.  The lead female, while staying at a remote cottage in order to write a novel, is gang raped and left for dead.  She starts trying to rebuild her life (her taping together of her torn up manuscript is an excellent symbolism for this), but is then discovered to still be alive by her rapists.  She then kills off the rapists one by one.  Perhaps not the most admirable of choices (although they did try to murder her), but the manner in which she kills each of them, playing off of their psychological weaknesses, brilliantly makes a point about the pathetic nature of rapists.All praise aside, it IS a disturbing movie to watch and one I hope nobody will find entertaining, and as a result I don't plan on watching it again.

495284,AE0E6UII0VSZA,B000009O8A,Blake Kleiner,"[11, 11]","Getting back to the series of reviews I did on exploitation horror films like &quot;The New York Ripper&quot; and &quot;Zombie,&quot; I now take the time to analyze the fiercely disturbing &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; from writer-director Meir Zarchi. I'd seen the box for this film on movie store walls since I was about ten, and had been interested in seeing it ever since, but had always ended up passing it up for something else. Was it worth the wait? Yes. Could it have waited longer? You bet. It is a good film, but it's far from being a great film. The cult appeal of it is obvious. It was made on a low budget with shoestring cinematography and almost no makeup effects whatsoever. The makeup effects we do see are bad, so it's no wonder Zarchi decided to hide that gruesome castration behind the porcelain wall of a bathtub. Such things are better left to the imagination, as John Carpenter has pointed out to us; how it will look in the audiences mind is infinitely more terrifying. Zarchi isn't of that school though, and the violence in this film is put on display wholesale for us to digest and possibly throw up. &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is a merciless film.The plot of the film is simple: A woman rents a cabin out in the woods, craving peace, quiet, and solitude to work on her first novel. She is quite attractive, and this is the first thing four men in town happen to notice when she stops by a gas station and later on gets a visit from the grocery boy. They decide to rape her. Very simple, and very disgusting, to think that there might actually be men in the world who think this way. And even more frightening yet to see the consequences of this way of thinking executed on screen in a series of vicious rapes and beatings that make the rape scene in &quot;The Accused&quot; look like passionate, consentual sex. Just when you think all the turmoil for this young woman is over, after she's forced to walk back home, naked, through the woods, stepping through mud and grit and trees with sharp branches, there's more to come. It seems like it never ends. Even the one man we have hope for betrays our trust, and hers. I was sick to my stomach by the time this was finally done. I know this was the reaction Zarchi was going for, but he could've done it with more style and less grit. Yes, this is disturbing, and most people might think it'd be disservicing the material to stylize it in anyway, but there really is a question of going too far here. As I've previously stated, when it's left up to our imagination, it's infinitely more terrifying. Nonetheless, the rape scenes, because they are so brutal and straightforward in their heinous nature, what ensues afterward seems justified. By the time the woman heals, we are already rooting for her, and we are one hundred percent with her when her plan to launch deadly revenge against the four men who attacked her goes into action.On that level, I recommend this movie. It's hardcore, stomach-churning, and all-out girl-powered. The four guys in the movie are the reasons why some women hate men. ... The men in this movie are pigs. And we rejoice in the revenge of this young woman after she was sodomized again and again by the absolute bottom of the male gene pool. &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is a dish best served cold.",3,Very disturbing exploitation film,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,3319,"['Getting', 'back', 'series', 'reviews', 'did', 'exploitation', 'horror', 'films', 'quot', 'New', 'York', 'Ripper', 'quot', 'quot', 'Zombie', 'quot', 'now', 'take', 'time', 'analyze', 'fiercely', 'disturbing', 'quot', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'quot', 'writer-director', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', ""'d"", 'seen', 'box', 'film', 'movie', 'store', 'walls', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'had', 'been', 'interested', 'seeing', 'ever', 'had', 'always', 'ended', 'up', 'passing', 'up', 'something', 'else', 'Was', 'wait', 'Yes', 'Could', 'have', 'waited', 'longer', 'bet', 'good', 'film', 'far', 'being', 'great', 'film', 'cult', 'appeal', 'obvious', 'was', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'shoestring', 'cinematography', 'almost', 'makeup', 'effects', 'makeup', 'effects', 'do', 'see', 'are', 'bad', 'wonder', 'Zarchi', 'decided', 'hide', 'gruesome', 'castration', 'porcelain', 'wall', 'bathtub', 'Such', 'things', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'imagination', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'will', 'look', 'audiences', 'mind', 'infinitely', 'more', 'terrifying', 'Zarchi', ""n't"", 'school', 'violence', 'film', 'put', 'display', 'wholesale', 'digest', 'possibly', 'throw', 'up', 'quot', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'quot', 'merciless', 'film.The', 'plot', 'film', 'simple', 'woman', 'cabin', 'out', 'woods', 'craving', 'peace', 'quiet', 'solitude', 'work', 'first', 'novel', 'quite', 'attractive', 'first', 'thing', 'four', 'men', 'town', 'happen', 'notice', 'when', 'gas', 'station', 'later', 'visit', 'grocery', 'boy', 'decide', 'rape', 'Very', 'simple', 'very', 'disgusting', 'think', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'men', 'world', 'who', 'think', 'way', 'even', 'more', 'frightening', 'yet', 'see', 'consequences', 'way', 'thinking', 'executed', 'screen', 'series', 'vicious', 'rapes', 'beatings', 'make', 'rape', 'scene', 'quot', 'Accused', 'quot', 'passionate', 'consentual', 'sex', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'turmoil', 'young', 'woman', 'forced', 'walk', 'back', 'home', 'naked', 'woods', 'stepping', 'mud', 'grit', 'trees', 'sharp', 'branches', 'more', 'come', 'never', 'Even', 'one', 'man', 'have', 'hope', 'betrays', 'trust', 'hers', 'was', 'sick', 'stomach', 'time', 'was', 'finally', 'done', 'know', 'was', 'reaction', 'Zarchi', 'was', 'going', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'style', 'less', 'grit', 'Yes', 'disturbing', 'most', 'people', 'might', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'disservicing', 'material', 'stylize', 'anyway', 'there', 'really', 'question', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'here', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'stated', 'when', 'left', 'up', 'imagination', 'infinitely', 'more', 'terrifying', 'Nonetheless', 'rape', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'brutal', 'straightforward', 'heinous', 'nature', 'what', 'afterward', 'justified', 'time', 'woman', 'heals', 'are', 'already', 'rooting', 'are', 'one', 'hundred', 'percent', 'when', 'plan', 'launch', 'deadly', 'revenge', 'four', 'men', 'who', 'attacked', 'action.On', 'level', 'recommend', 'movie', 'hardcore', 'stomach-churning', 'all-out', 'girl-powered', 'four', 'guys', 'movie', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'women', 'hate', 'men', 'men', 'movie', 'are', 'pigs', 'rejoice', 'revenge', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'sodomized', 'again', 'again', 'absolute', 'bottom', 'male', 'gene', 'pool', 'quot', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'quot', 'dish', 'best', 'served', 'cold']",N/A
495285,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B000009O8A,Boggman!,"[4, 5]","Jenny (Camille Keaton) needs some R&R; and some inspiration for her latest novel. So she decides to pack up, rent a nice little wilderness cabin and kill two birds with one stone. Things are going all too peacefully until the day those rowdy locals start harassing her. While sunbathing on a hammock outside and enjoying the silence, two of the local guys start cruising by her on their boat -- a hoot'n and a holler'n! Jenny could have waived hello, maybe even invited the gents in for a cup of coffee or somethin?? Instead, she decides to stick her nose up, and walk back inside. Big MISTAKE! Especially when your a woman, all by your lonesome and very far out of your comfort zone!A day or so later, while bikini clad once more and laying in her canoe, minding her own business- the fellows happen to cruise by once more. This time they decide to rope up Jenny's canoe and drag the poor girl to land. Immediately, Jenny starts frieken out, scream'n the whole way and acting scared out of her wits once they hit the shore.By this time the guys (joined by two of their dimwitted friends) are all fired up. Ya see...they have a ""slow"" one in the group (Mathew), who also happens to be a virgin that they desperately want to get laid. After some serious peer pressure and taunting of poor Mathew (Richard Pace) Jenny is raped by one of the guys. After the assault Jenny is allowed to walk home, albeit completely butt naked, beaten, and traumatized. After a long stroll through the forest, poor Jenny is attacked again.Jenny finally makes it home, where her attackers follow and decide to have one last ""go around"". This time Mathew cant resist the pressure and takes a ride himself. The other guys chant and laugh, and one goes so far as to assault Jenny with a glass bottle before slapping her around a few more times. OUCH!After the guys have all but drained themselves they leave. Stopping at the shoreline, it is decided that hey can't just let Jenny live. No, she must be killed. And who better to do it than Mathew, the village idiot. Mathew (against his will--if you can call it that) goes back to the house to finish the job. But he just can't do it, because deep down he's just another good hearted, lovable handicapped person. He leaves Jenny as is, and runs back to tell his homies that he took care of her.Fast forward: Two weeks have gone by and no news of Jenny or her murder has surfaced. This starts to worry the guys, who are just waiting around for the story to break! Mathew continues to state he did kill her, but the boys decide eventually to hop back in the boat and cruise by Jenny's cabin again. During this time, Jenny has recovered, and has been using the last two weeks to get herself back together, and come up with a plan of action. Action of course means DEATH!The boys realize Jenny is still alive after cruising by her cabin (she's on that damn hammock again) and are quite PO'd at Mathew for lying. They are not sure what to do.But Jenny knows what she is going to do.....and sets her plan in motion. One by one she cajoles, tricks, and seduces them before making them pay the ultimate price for her violation.All kidding aside, this reviewer enjoyed ""I Spit On Your Grave"". I can certainly see how it ruffled some feathers back in it's day. The rape scenes are pretty graphic (especially for it's time), and the brutality of the film is unquestionable. I like the fact that there is no music in the movie either, as it adds to the realism of the film. This is unarguably the ultimate ""rape/ revenge"" story... and although the revenge portion of it is somewhat ""unbelievable"" to say the least-- it is a nice ending to this little tale of victimization.Those hicks definitely get what's coming to them.Props to Camille Keaton, a very lovely woman who had some serious cajones' to take on such a role. While it's far from perfect, ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is a time honored classic in the tradition of revenge stories that has held up pretty darn good over the years.Recommended!",4,Your friends & neighbors.....,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,4008,"['Jenny', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'R', 'R', 'inspiration', 'latest', 'novel', 'pack', 'up', 'rent', 'nice', 'little', 'wilderness', 'cabin', 'kill', 'two', 'birds', 'one', 'stone', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'too', 'peacefully', 'day', 'rowdy', 'locals', 'start', 'harassing', 'sunbathing', 'hammock', 'enjoying', 'silence', 'two', 'local', 'guys', 'start', 'cruising', 'boat', 'hoot', 'n', 'holler', 'n', 'Jenny', 'could', 'have', 'waived', 'hello', 'maybe', 'even', 'invited', 'gents', 'cup', 'coffee', 'somethin', 'Instead', 'stick', 'nose', 'up', 'walk', 'back', 'inside', 'Big', 'MISTAKE', 'Especially', 'when', 'woman', 'lonesome', 'very', 'far', 'comfort', 'zone', 'day', 'so', 'later', 'bikini', 'clad', 'once', 'more', 'laying', 'canoe', 'minding', 'own', 'business-', 'fellows', 'happen', 'cruise', 'once', 'more', 'time', 'decide', 'rope', 'up', 'Jenny', 'canoe', 'drag', 'poor', 'girl', 'land', 'Immediately', 'Jenny', 'frieken', 'out', 'scream', 'whole', 'way', 'acting', 'scared', 'wits', 'hit', 'shore.By', 'time', 'guys', 'joined', 'two', 'dimwitted', 'friends', 'are', 'fired', 'up', 'Ya', 'see', 'have', 'slow', 'one', 'group', 'Mathew', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'virgin', 'desperately', 'want', 'get', 'laid', 'serious', 'peer', 'pressure', 'taunting', 'poor', 'Mathew', 'Richard', 'Pace', 'Jenny', 'raped', 'one', 'guys', 'assault', 'Jenny', 'allowed', 'walk', 'home', 'completely', 'butt', 'naked', 'beaten', 'traumatized', 'long', 'stroll', 'forest', 'poor', 'Jenny', 'attacked', 'again.Jenny', 'finally', 'home', 'where', 'attackers', 'follow', 'decide', 'have', 'one', 'last', 'go', 'around', 'time', 'Mathew', 'cant', 'resist', 'pressure', 'ride', 'other', 'guys', 'chant', 'laugh', 'one', 'so', 'far', 'assault', 'Jenny', 'glass', 'bottle', 'slapping', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'OUCH', 'guys', 'have', 'drained', 'leave', 'Stopping', 'shoreline', 'decided', 'hey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'let', 'Jenny', 'live', 'No', 'must', 'be', 'killed', 'who', 'better', 'do', 'Mathew', 'village', 'idiot', 'Mathew', 'will', 'can', 'call', 'back', 'house', 'finish', 'job', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'deep', 'just', 'good', 'hearted', 'lovable', 'handicapped', 'person', 'Jenny', 'back', 'tell', 'homies', 'took', 'care', 'her.Fast', 'forward', 'Two', 'weeks', 'have', 'gone', 'news', 'Jenny', 'murder', 'surfaced', 'worry', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'waiting', 'around', 'story', 'break', 'Mathew', 'state', 'did', 'kill', 'boys', 'decide', 'eventually', 'hop', 'back', 'boat', 'cruise', 'Jenny', 'cabin', 'again', 'time', 'Jenny', 'recovered', 'been', 'using', 'last', 'two', 'weeks', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'action', 'Action', 'course', 'means', 'DEATH', 'boys', 'realize', 'Jenny', 'still', 'alive', 'cruising', 'cabin', 'damn', 'hammock', 'again', 'are', 'quite', 'PO', ""'d"", 'Mathew', 'lying', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'do.But', 'Jenny', 'what', 'going', 'do', '..and', 'sets', 'plan', 'motion', 'One', 'one', 'tricks', 'seduces', 'making', 'pay', 'ultimate', 'price', 'violation.All', 'kidding', 'aside', 'reviewer', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'how', 'ruffled', 'feathers', 'back', 'day', 'rape', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'especially', 'time', 'brutality', 'film', 'unquestionable', 'fact', 'music', 'movie', 'either', 'realism', 'film', 'unarguably', 'ultimate', 'rape/', 'revenge', 'story', 'revenge', 'portion', 'somewhat', 'unbelievable', 'say', 'least', 'nice', 'ending', 'little', 'tale', 'victimization.Those', 'hicks', 'definitely', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'them.Props', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'very', 'lovely', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'serious', 'cajones', 'take', 'role', 'far', 'perfect', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'time', 'honored', 'classic', 'tradition', 'revenge', 'stories', 'held', 'up', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'years.Recommended']",N/A

I'm guessing the hubbub stems from the rape scene which takes quite a while.  She is raped by one man then she flees then gets raped by a second one then again runs only to get caught again and thus violated by a third and so on.  After she showers, eats, smokes and changes cothing she sets off to get revenge.  The revenge scenes are not very shocking (except she uses her femine wiles to luree the rapists into set up situation which seems odd considering she was just raped by them) considering some of the flicks I have seen lately; however, I am guessing from the age of the film they were once something controversal.

495288,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B000009O8A,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[0, 0]","To date, Zarchi's exploitation classic is the film that all other revenge flicks aspire to be or continue to steal pages from. Even after all these years, people still have great memories of ISOYG and time has truly been more than kind to this brutal cult film. While many other films in the same genre have seemingly fallen off the face of the earth or the cult cinema map, Meir Zarchi's film will never suffer such a fate.According to the faithful wiki, The film's original title was Day of the Woman. It was also shown under the title I Hate Your Guts and The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill. The title was changed to I Spit on Your Grave for the 1980 re-release. Meir Zarchi dislikes this title.While I've never been quite sure whether ISOYG is merely a starchy exploitation flick or a trashy female empowerment story, it's compelling to say the very least and I do still find myself wanting to revisit Zarchi's cruel world from time to time. How about now?Jennifer Hills (played by the truly beautiful Camille Keaton) wants nothing more than to get away from the hustle and bustle of New York. In order to work on her novel and remain focused, she rents an isolated cottage by the lake in a relatively small town. Naturally, every man in town is attracted to this young woman including a semi-retarded Matthew, a gas station manager (and married to boot) Johnny, and two slackers who spend their afternoons just moping around town when not hanging out at the gas station.As one can probably guess, trouble is brewing and nothing good will come out of Jennifer's friendship with Matthew nor her initial introduction to Johnny, the gas station manager. Jennifer is captured by our motley crew of unscrupulous men while relaxing in her canoe. Over the next half hour, Jennifer is raped repeatedly in various locations by the four men and left for dead. Realizing that she can testify against each one of them, Johnny sends Matthew back to the cottage to kill Jennifer. Mathew, however, cannot bring himself to kill Jennifer but wipes her blood on his knife and then advises the other men that she is now dead.Over the course of a few days, Jennifer grieves and tries to pull herself back together while she works on the manuscript once again that had been previously shredded by the four rapists in her cottage. After attending church and asking for forgiveness, she plots to kill them off one by one beginning with Matthew.Although slightly less controversial with time, ISOYG is still not an easy watch by any means. Considered by many to be one of the essential cult classics loved by horror & cult film enthusiasts alike, there are scenes which will stick with you for the rest of your life. I still flinch each time I view the bathtub scene where Johnny's genitals are severed by Jennifer. While the scene isn't as graphic as my description might have you believe, it's nevertheless a scene which makes me extremely uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the viewer will still root for Jennifer all the way after witnessing her ugly sexual assaults.So whatever happened to Camille Keaton? Well, that's another story entirely but I will go ahead and tell you that she's made one hell of a comeback with Fred Vogel's Sella Turcica and she has two other films which are in the works. Fingers crossed. I'm hoping that they will soon see the light of day. One of which is entitled The Butterfly Room that boasts performances by Heather Langenkamp, Barbara Steele, and many other great veteran horror actresses. It's sad that Camille Keaton wasn't given a great deal of work in the movie industry for some 30 years but I'm glad to report she's alive and well. Perhaps the new millennium will continue to show moviegoers that Keaton is indeed a talent to be reckoned with.I can also report that the much anticipated remake of the unrated ISOYG was released on DVD 02/08/11. Meir Zarchi serves as executive producer this time around. For those of you who still haven't seen the original, Anchor Bay has also re-released the cult classic on the same day for under $20.

At last a film with absolutely no redeeming qualities to it.  This is a revenge film.  It is graphically violent and is quite sadistic.  Don't expect to see any high budget gore.  This is a true brutally violent movie.  After a woman is gang raped by several men, she decides to take the law into her own hands and deal out her revenge.  The rape scene is long and drawn out and is quite brutal.  Rarely do movie rape scenes get this brutal.  It actually gives a sense of reality in its brutality that is rare in film.  Real rape is extremely violent and this film does nothing to cover it up.  Not that that's a redeeming quality.  There is nothing to like about this film unless your sick but that is why its actually good.  There is no feeling sorry when she enacts her revenge on these men.

495293,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000009O8A,Carl Manes,"[2, 2]","I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE has been the source of controversy for decades since its initial release in 1978. As a rape and revenge film, it belongs to a very specific sub-genre of cinema that many critics consider to be intolerable exploitation. On the other hand, fans of these movies must consider it to be top-ranking in this particular category. In it, Jennifer heads off to a small getaway by the lake so that she can relax and complete her work on her first novel. Her arrival draws the attention of four degenerates in town, who abduct her and repeatedly rape her out in the woods. Just when it seems she has escaped, she returns home only to find the men there waiting for her. Jennifer barely survives the brutal attacks, but rather than going to the police, she regains her strength and sets out to seduce each of the men before exacting her own bloody revenge!What makes I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE so powerful is that it never glamorizes the rape sequences. In fact, they are hardly bearable to watch due to Camille Keaton's harrowing screams and failed attempts to free herself. There are hints of hesitation and regret that come from several of the men that humanize the characters, which is even more dangerous than painting them to be soulless monsters since it draws them back into reality. It is not just the extreme violence against women that must critics condemn, but the manner in which the subject of rape is handled. Jennifer's independence and sexual liberation entice the men, which seems to suggest the common excuse that ""She was asking for it."" They hoot and holler as they each take their turns with her, shouting ""You want to be a man, don't you?"" This has brought fire down on the film, since it seems to depict that Meir Zarchi's views rape as a sex act, and not as an act of power and domination. It isn't enough for Jennifer to suffer physically, but she is humiliated as well as the men mockingly read from her unfinished novel before destroying her work.The original title of DAY OF THE WOMAN can also help in reading the film as an underestimated but radically pro-feminist work. Jennifer is entirely independent and successful, writing for a number of women's magazines before setting off to complete her own novel. Her sexual freedom is a demonstration of a progressive society where women are treated equally to men (though the men in this story try to restore prior order). Even during the attacks, Jennifer is never depicted as being weak. She struggles with all of her might, but she is overwhelmed and outnumbered. After, she becomes that much stronger and more cunning, and she uses that strength to emasculate and eviscerate her adversaries. At the heart of any rape and revenge story is the revenge, and being that this is a Horror movie, Jennifer's revenge is swift and painful. Each of the men suffer a terrible death at her hands, the worst of which involves a knife and a bathtub as she takes the lead villain's manhood in hand.I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE remains an undisputed classic in the rape and revenge genre, and its notoriety as such has kept it banned in countless countries around the world for over thirty years. To say that it is nothing more than despicable exploitation, however, is to blindly overlook many of stronger points that Meir Zarchi brings to the screen.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,I Spit On Your Grave,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,3343,"['SPIT', 'YOUR', 'GRAVE', 'been', 'source', 'controversy', 'decades', 'initial', 'release', '1978', 'rape', 'revenge', 'film', 'very', 'specific', 'sub-genre', 'cinema', 'many', 'critics', 'consider', 'be', 'intolerable', 'exploitation', 'other', 'hand', 'fans', 'movies', 'must', 'consider', 'be', 'top-ranking', 'particular', 'category', 'Jennifer', 'small', 'getaway', 'lake', 'can', 'relax', 'complete', 'work', 'first', 'novel', 'arrival', 'draws', 'attention', 'four', 'degenerates', 'town', 'who', 'abduct', 'repeatedly', 'rape', 'out', 'woods', 'Just', 'when', 'escaped', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'men', 'there', 'waiting', 'Jennifer', 'barely', 'brutal', 'attacks', 'rather', 'going', 'police', 'strength', 'out', 'seduce', 'men', 'exacting', 'own', 'bloody', 'revenge', 'What', 'SPIT', 'ON', 'YOUR', 'GRAVE', 'so', 'powerful', 'never', 'rape', 'sequences', 'fact', 'are', 'hardly', 'bearable', 'watch', 'due', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'harrowing', 'screams', 'failed', 'attempts', 'free', 'are', 'hints', 'hesitation', 'regret', 'come', 'several', 'men', 'humanize', 'characters', 'even', 'more', 'dangerous', 'painting', 'be', 'soulless', 'monsters', 'back', 'reality', 'not', 'just', 'extreme', 'violence', 'women', 'must', 'critics', 'condemn', 'manner', 'subject', 'rape', 'handled', 'Jennifer', 'independence', 'sexual', 'liberation', 'men', 'suggest', 'common', 'excuse', 'was', 'asking', 'hoot', 'holler', 'take', 'turns', 'shouting', 'want', 'be', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'brought', 'fire', 'down', 'film', 'depict', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', 'views', 'rape', 'sex', 'act', 'not', 'act', 'power', 'domination', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Jennifer', 'suffer', 'physically', 'humiliated', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'mockingly', 'read', 'unfinished', 'novel', 'destroying', 'work.The', 'original', 'title', 'DAY', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'can', 'also', 'help', 'reading', 'film', 'underestimated', 'radically', 'pro-feminist', 'work', 'Jennifer', 'entirely', 'independent', 'successful', 'writing', 'number', 'women', 'magazines', 'setting', 'off', 'complete', 'own', 'novel', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'demonstration', 'progressive', 'society', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'treated', 'equally', 'men', 'men', 'story', 'try', 'restore', 'prior', 'order', 'Even', 'attacks', 'Jennifer', 'never', 'depicted', 'being', 'weak', 'might', 'overwhelmed', 'outnumbered', 'much', 'stronger', 'more', 'cunning', 'strength', 'emasculate', 'eviscerate', 'adversaries', 'heart', 'rape', 'revenge', 'story', 'revenge', 'being', 'Horror', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'revenge', 'swift', 'painful', 'men', 'suffer', 'terrible', 'death', 'hands', 'worst', 'knife', 'bathtub', 'lead', 'villain', 'manhood', 'hand.I', 'SPIT', 'ON', 'YOUR', 'GRAVE', 'undisputed', 'classic', 'rape', 'revenge', 'genre', 'notoriety', 'such', 'kept', 'banned', 'countless', 'countries', 'world', 'thirty', 'years', 'say', 'nothing', 'more', 'despicable', 'exploitation', 'however', 'blindly', 'overlook', 'many', 'stronger', 'points', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', 'screen.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

I watched the 2010 remakeI Spit on Your Gravebefore I watched this original 1978 ""I Spit on Your Grave - Day of the Woman.""  I'm glad I watched both - they both have their strengths.I don't think either are the type of movies you ENJOY.  You experience them at a visceral level.I was very impressed with this version. The cinematography was superb - clear, wonderful color, interesting perspectives. There was no background musical score and I think that added a lot to the movie - you could hear every sound and the silences added to the drama.There was more nudity in this version - male and female; much more solely physical rape scenes - I can definitely understand the NR rating, ESPECIALLY for 1978. An extra on the DVD for this version is a discussion with the director, Meir Zarchi, which was enlightening.The 2011 version had much more of a psychological/emotional buildup to the rapes, which added to the scare factor. And the revenge sequence in the newer movie was much more brutal. Also, I thought the part of Matthew was much better played in the newer version, not such a caricature of a mentally troubled young man.The stories aren't exactly alike but both are very good, for the genre they are. Both actresses playing Jennifer Hills - Camille Keaton (1978) and Sarah Butler (2010) did outstanding jobs.Both versions deserve their NR ratings - these are not movies for anyone but adult - and a LOT of adults won't want to be watching them either.

Bates ""Dave, the Man!!!""","[2, 2]","This one [along with Ms .45, which I believe was in part inspired by this film] was heavily discussed in the rape-revenge section of Carol Clover's Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film, to such a degree that it made its way to the front of my list. I had heard about it for years, but had trouble finding it. I DID keep finding I Will Dance On Your Grave, which seems like a cheap attempt to make money off of people who think it's this one. Their covers are also quite similar.The DVD opens with Jennifer Hill, our main character, leaving New York and taking a drive out into the country. She stops for gas, where we first see our rapists, and informs the station attendant that she is going to this country house she has bought that she has never seen. She gets to the house and walks around back, then decides to strip her clothes off and take a dip in the lake, without having unpacked or gone into the house at all. She gets a delivery of groceries from Matt, this semi-retarded guy who works at the local store, and he says he heard that ""New York is an evil place."" Jennifer says ""well, here's a tip from an evil new Yorker."" Matt then asks if they can be friends, Jennifer says they can. So, they're friends, and Matt seems a little pleasantly flummoxed to be friends with this woman. We have also found out that Jennifer has come out here for the summer to work on her novel, and that most of her published work so far has been in women's magazines. As a copywriter, I was thinking ""Oh God, I hope we get to take a peek at her novel,"" and we DO!So the guys are sitting around bored. One of them thinks about Jennifer and wonders ""do beautiful women ever take a ****?"" which cleverly sets up at least that character as seeing beautiful women as somehow not human. Then another of them chimes in that all the women in New York are whores, and that he's ""going to go to New York and **** all the whores."" Another claims he's going to do the same in L.A. They then go out to Jennifer's house to harass her. She is writing outside while wearing a bikini, and the guys cruise by on a boat, then keep revving and cruising by in the lake, apparently oogling her body as she lays there. Then they come by her house and night and make whooping sounds outside. It's creepy, especially when you see that she hasn't locked the doors. What? Some New Yorker ISN'T going to keep all doors locked at all times?The next day while Jennifer is in a canoe, the guys come by and start dragging her canoe behind them in their speedboat. They drag her across the lake, then grab her and throw her to the ground. Matt, the semi-retarded one, has confessed to the guys that he thinks she's kind of a nice, so the supposed `reason' for the attack is to `get' her for Matt. When he won't do anything, another of the guys jumps on for a rape that is quite detailed and brutal. You will notice that there is no music during the rape [apparently there's no music in the entire film], which I thought was a good decision.They let her go and she runs off into the woods. The horror and shock are quite apparent on her face and in her body language as she stumbles naked through the woods. This is one of the clues that Ms .45 is a riff on this movie, because both of them seal the anti-rape point-of-view of the movie in showing in detail the horrible physical and psychic consequences. There is a chilling little surprise next for those who end up watching this movie, but as it would happen the guys haven't really let her escape and another of them brutally rapes her. We then have another completely harrowing scene as she makes it back to her cabin after a long, horrible walk through the woods.Turns out the guys are already waiting for her in the cabin. They persuade her ""friend"" Matt [who has not so much as raised is voice to defend her, by the way] to go ahead and rape her, and he attempts to, but ""can't with you guys watching."" His attempt is filmed in a creepily close way that really evokes how unpleasant it would be for Jennifer. She, by the way, is laying exhausted, bloody and naked on the floor. At last the last of them, Stanley, gets on, but it seems that all he wants to do is beat her. Matt says to him ""You wanted total submission, you got it!"" And finally they all leave. The entire rape sequence has lasted 20 minutes.The guys force Matt to go back in and kill Jennifer. He can't stand to do it, so he just wipes the knife in the blood, and comes back to tell the guys it was accomplished. They speed off in the boat. Jennifer eventually cleans herself off [a totally brutal shot of her bloody body in the shower], and two weeks pass wherein she thinks about what happens and apparently gets stronger. She pieces her novel [which they ripped up] back together and starts writing again. And she plots her revenge.SPOILERS > > >The guys haven't heard anything about her body being found, and they want to send Matthew up to check on her. Please take note of the ice cream sundae right in Matthew's face that really rather resembles a breast in this scene. It's a little funny [yet realistic] that they keep sending Matthew on these missions, yet they all know he is completely unreliable. Anyway, Matthew is working at the grocery store when he gets an order to take up to Jennifer's house. Also note that just behind the grocery bag, Matthew sees the butcher cutting a pig in half, with these two legs in the air and him cutting a bloody hole right in its crotch. I think this and the sundae are here to show how the rape is on Matthew's mind and its images and their meaning are stuck in his brain. He delivers the groceries, and Jennifer comes on to him, letting him have sex with her, when she slips a noose over his neck and hangs him over the river.Her next victim is the first rapist, whose name I didn't get. She pulls up to his mechanic shop and seduces him, then pulls a gun on him. He says that Stanley [the one who just wanted to hit her] made him do it, that he has a wife and kids, and that ""a man is just a man"" and she ""MADE him see her sexy legs."" She seems to consider this; `well, I DID make him look at my sexy legs,' and lowers the gun. She then comes on to him again [and these morons fall for it] and tells him that he deserves a hot bath. She asks him about his wife and kids, then steps into the bath and castrates him. She then locks him in the bathroom to bleed to death, and listens to a Puccini opera while he screams and yells upstairs.The other two are dispatched with less vigor, but you will notice that in this case the phallic weapon she assumes IS the boat. She also has a great facial expression of knowing triumph after handily removing the axe from the hands of one of her former attackers. Stanley [the violent one] gets it last. Then she drives off and that's it, the movie ends.&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDThis movie was much more intelligently and artfully done than I had imagined. This is not stupid or exploitative. I was really surprised at the amount of excellent, electrifying images there were here. I was also quite impressed with the way the movie treats the psychology of the rapists. I'm sort of used to men being treated as these animals who can barely restrain themselves to exist in society anyway, and then suddenly explode into sexualized violence, usually with a pack mentality [compare this film with the rape in The Accused]. What this movie got across in a way that was even more chilling than the idea that all men are rapists within is that the guys were just BORED. The movie spends a fair amount of time with them beforehand, so we know them as real people, and we can see what little excitement there is in their lives--and how exciting this ""beautiful woman"" from the city is. We understand that they objectify beautiful women and see them different from `normal' women in their discussion of whether beautiful women defecate and how all women from New York are ""whores."" It seems that the whole, long rape sequence was not planned, but happened spontaneously when Matthew refused, and continued rolling from there. Then we see the fear and suspicion on the minds of the four rapists later. I'm not saying the film made apologies for them, they NEVER see Jennifer as a separate living being with her own intelligence and feelings, but what it does do is lay out their psychologies in much more detail then we usually get in movies.The question with films that depict a rape is always: does the movie glorify the rape? Or generate excitement in the audience with the rape? One could argue that anything depicted on film in a way glorifies it, but I think that the filmmakers take steps to minimize that effect here. As I said, there is no music, especially during the rape, and music in a film is usually used to encourage the audience to feel something, usually some form of excitement. Also, the aforementioned focus on the psychology of the men draws away from our being able to simply enjoy the rape in an unambiguous way, as does the extreme focus on Jennifer's pain, humiliation, and torment. The film shows long takes of her stumbling through the woods, covered in dirt and blood, and there's nothing exciting about it. The film also used the image of her naked and prostrate on the floor of her cabin not for excitement, but just to show her vulnerability and how brutal all this is. And I do have to say, this is without doubt THE most brutal movie I have ever seen.This movie is famous for being attacked by both Siskel and Ebert [separately] as the worst movie ever made and a total abomination. Their reviews got it pulled from the mainstream theater in which it was showing and, of course, inadvertently helped seal its notoriety. I wonder what Ebert would think of it if he were to view it again. To me it is a movie of unquestionable quality that just happens to take a very brutal and unflinching look at the psychological realities of rape, and the fantasies of revenge [the second half is markedly less realistic] one might have after having experienced it. The ""reviews and articles"" section on the disc nicely charts the film's reception from revulsion to some acceptance.This film was originally titled Day of the Woman, which one of the supportive writers in the accompanying articles thinks is a much better title, but I like I Spit On Your Grave. It sums up all of the enduring hatred and anger that the film taps into, and doesn't try to cast this film as a cultural piece about all women and how they all want revenge [a direction Ms .45 takes much more explicitly]. What IS a little disturbing is the way that the film was originally marketed. The trailers show very little of the rapes [and do not explicitly state in any way that the female character was raped], but instead concentrates on the woman stalking men. We are told that the Day of the Woman is ""the ultimate day of terror."" Even the art on the current box shows a woman from behind, head out of frame, with tiny cut-off shorts. It seems that some of the people marketing this movie are some who most are in need of seeing it.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?Regardless, a fascinating, totally brutal movie with a lot to say about rape and gender. Definitely worth watching, and definitely not for the faint of heart.",4,"Unquestionably brutal, unquestionably artistic",1237161600,"03 16, 2009",2009,11287,"['one', '[', 'Ms', '.45', 'believe',

495299,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,B000009O8A,C McGhee,"[2, 2]","I Spit on Your Grave (1978 release) - is a movie that runs the gamut of viewer reaction. It runs all the way from exploitive trash to great female empowerment movie. I don't understand either of the extremes. It is a very disturbing movie, but how do you make a movie about rape that both depicts it & calls the motivations of every participant into question without being disturbing, even disgusting. Most films refuse to portray rape in all its vile violent nature. That can't be said of this movie, although there is no penetration shown in this one.The set up is common enough, a writer of short stories leaves New York for the country & a summer house on a river to write her first novel. She's a typical New York gal, modern, unassuming, fun loving & a more than a little nave about her safety. She meets a gas station attendant & is seen by two of his cohorts. They are of course bored by the lack of activity & interested in this fresh addition to their neighborhood. There's a man with a child-like mind involved playing a grocery delivery boy too.They all know each other & undercover of providing their man-child a way of getting rid of his virginity they take advantage of her solitude on the river to repeatedly sexually assault her. A warning here as these scenes are violently graphic & sexual, even by today's standards.The movie continues with the girl's reaction to the extreme violence & her choices between reporting them, acting as if it didn't happen or seeking revenge. She chooses the latter & it is as violent as the assault on her. I'm trying to avoid using many spoilers here but once again a psychologically disturbing & violent ending is in store. I'm surprised this film doesn't cause a lot of discussion about the effects of rape on the perpetrators, the victim, the vengeance, the role that law should play & especially about what this girls future life is going to be like. Perhaps it does that in a film class. It's a low budget show but the photography is OK & the acting is dead on. Perhaps the make-up department could have done better on the wounds but they are good enough for this show, like I said, limited budget.The story here is a portrayal of what rape is really like & it's there on screen. If it makes you squeamish that's because it should. It's a vile & violent crime that was ignored for centuries; all the motivations of those that defend rapists are also depicted here. There's little held back. You have to move into porn to get a more realistic image of rape. Due to those reason's I feel it was a good idea to make the movie. It's definitely not a good idea to watch it repeatedly as there is no reason to. You won't forget what you see. I've seen it twice in over 30 years & the second viewing didn't change my memories of what happened.You will not see a slick Hollywood production number here but you will see through the eyes of the victim the dirt, mud, blood & desperation of a victim. You're reaction to the ending may run from disgust to elation or concern. That was my reaction, concern. What future is there available at the end of this extremely graphic tale? That alone should cause some discussion.",4,What's the Possible Future,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,3166,"['Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', '1978', 'release', 'movie', 'gamut', 'viewer', 'reaction', 'way', 'exploitive', 'trash', 'great', 'female', 'empowerment', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'extremes', 'very', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'how', 'do', 'make', 'movie', 'rape', 'depicts', 'motivations', 'participant', 'question', 'being', 'disturbing', 'even', 'disgusting', 'Most', 'films', 'refuse', 'portray', 'rape', 'vile', 'violent', 'nature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'penetration', 'shown', 'one.The', 'set', 'up', 'common', 'enough', 'writer', 'short', 'stories', 'New', 'York', 'country', 'summer', 'house', 'river', 'write', 'first', 'novel', 'typical', 'New', 'York', 'gal', 'modern', 'unassuming', 'fun', 'loving', 'more', 'little', 'nave', 'safety', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'seen', 'two', 'cohorts', 'are', 'course', 'bored', 'lack', 'activity', 'interested', 'fresh', 'addition', 'neighborhood', 'man', 'child-like', 'mind', 'involved', 'playing', 'grocery', 'delivery', 'boy', 'know', 'other', 'undercover', 'providing', 'man-child', 'way', 'getting', 'rid', 'virginity', 'take', 'advantage', 'solitude', 'river', 'repeatedly', 'sexually', 'warning', 'here', 'scenes', 'are', 'violently', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'even', 'today', 'standards.The', 'movie', 'girl', 'reaction', 'extreme', 'violence', 'choices', 'reporting', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'latter', 'as', 'violent', 'assault', ""'m"", 'trying', 'avoid', 'using', 'many', 'spoilers', 'here', 'once', 'again', 'psychologically', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'ending', 'store', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'film', ""n't"", 'cause', 'lot', 'discussion', 'effects', 'rape', 'perpetrators', 'victim', 'vengeance', 'role', 'law', 'should', 'play', 'especially', 'what', 'girls', 'future', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'class', 'low', 'budget', 'show', 'photography', 'OK', 'acting', 'dead', 'Perhaps', 'make-up', 'department', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'wounds', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'show', 'said', 'limited', 'budget.The', 'story', 'here', 'portrayal', 'what', 'rape', 'really', 'like', 'there', 'screen', 'squeamish', 'should', 'vile', 'violent', 'crime', 'was', 'ignored', 'centuries', 'motivations', 'defend', 'rapists', 'are', 'also', 'depicted', 'here', 'little', 'held', 'back', 'have', 'move', 'porn', 'get', 'more', 'realistic', 'image', 'rape', 'Due', 'reason', 'feel', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'make', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'reason', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'what', 'see', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twice', '30', 'years', 'second', 'viewing', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'memories', 'what', 'happened.You', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'number', 'here', 'will', 'see', 'eyes', 'victim', 'dirt', 'mud', 'blood', 'desperation', 'victim', ""'re"", 'reaction', 'ending', 'may', 'run', 'disgust', 'elation', 'concern', 'was', 'reaction', 'concern', 'What', 'future', 'there', 'available', 'end', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'tale', 'alone', 'should', 'cause', 'discussion']",N/A

Oliver,"[1, 1]","First off people, this movie goes way over the top with the rape, I agree with all the one star reviews that it is a perverted rape sequence, that the director put in as mere exploitation.  I think the material could've been handled better, like in Last house on the left, but it wasn't.  I give it four stars however, because i like revenge flicks, and I like the plot.  The directing with such a miniscule budget was good.  And the storyline was good.  Also it is a reality, and a movie that people can look at as a reality.  I'm not saying the director meant it to be this way, because I don't think so.  I agree with Roger Ebert in the film being ""Vile trash"" but I think it adds something accidentally to the psyche of everything.  It's a film that is good to have if you're a revenge fan, if you have Death Wish, The Limey, the Punisher, Spawn, and other movies like that, then get this movie.

High on exploitation with 3 brutal rape scenes and some very gruesome revenge sequences but it all feels so real. These no holds barred scenes make it oh so real which was probably the director's intention. To show the true brutallity of rape. If you find these scenes stimulating you have some real issues. They leave you with a total feeling of disgust. I alway have had an eye for cinematography and camera use and I Spit on Your Grave makes good use of these with a skilled eye by the director. It's really much better in this regard than Last House on the Left. Which looked like it was filmed by high school kids. I thought Camille Keaton had a presence well worth the price. When I purchased this on DVD, I was expecting some cheap movie with one of those lousy 70's soundtracks but what made this film more effective was the haunting silence during the rape scenes so all you hear is the screams of the woman.  And again, the camera work is exquisite. Not everyone will have the stomach for the plot, but it is actually a well made movie. Buy the special millenium edition.

I thought, &quot;Well, this  is just one more slasher film.  Probably so bad you'll have to  laugh.&quot;Boy, was I dead wrong.I Spit on Your Grave is one of the  most disturbing, terrifying and thought-provoking movies I have ever seen.  It begins quite peacefully when Jenny (Camille Keaton) arrives in the  country to write a book.  She's rented a cottage by the river.  Pretty,  slender, and from the big city, she catches the eye of four locals.  They  try to catch her attention, but appropriately, she ignores them.Unhappy  that she has refused them, the four decide to teach her a lesson.  One day,  while she is in her little canoe sunning, they come by in a motor boat and  take her away, against her will, to a hidden part of the woods.  I can't  even begin to describe what happens in this movie's next chapter.  All I  will say is that I was horrified, petrified and practically moved to tears.  If you cannot imagine what it is like to be helpless and at other people's  mercy, just watch this movie.One of the four guys orders one of the  others to kill her so she won't witness against them.  Unbeknownst to the  other three, the supposed killer is unable to complete his task.  Presumed  dead by the three, she slowly recovers from her injuries.  Once recovered,  she only has one purpose in her mind and heart.One by one, she plots the  death of her four attackers.

495305,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B000009O8A,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 5]","One of the most controversial and notorious movies to come out from the 1970's was Meir Zarchi's I Spit On Your Grave.  Jennifer Hill, a New York writer, decides to go to a cabin in the country to finish her novel.  Much of the plot is already given out on the back of the video box.  She is sunbathing in her boat out in the lake when two locals in a motorboat, the blond Andy and dark-haired Stanley, lasso her boat to the shore and chase her through the woods.  They are joined by two of their friends, Johnny, the local gas station attendant, and Matthew, the nerdy-looking half-retarded grocery delivery man who has a crush on her.  She is stripped, raped and beaten bloody three times, twice in the woods, once in her cabin.  Having survived this traumatic ordeal, she gets a well-deserved revenge on all four of them.The way Jennifer is attacked and chased is the way one would treat a hunted animal, especially as Andy and Stanley yell like rednecks in heat, adding to the fear she felt.  Hunting is probably one of the pastimes country hicks like them enjoy, and to them, she is no different from any deer.There are some issues still relevant today.  One is the motivation of the men who attacked Jennifer.  Johnny thinks she was asking for it, as she showed up at the gas station walking back and forth in her summer dress, showing off her legs, and later, when she was in her bathing suit.  This is the ""she's asking for it"" defense.  In fact when he and his friends are out fishing at night, he says that women from the city come to the country for one thing...sex.  While I far from condone rape, there is something to be said for Jennifer's cut-offs and other revealing clothes.  Perhaps the men felt exploited, being turned on like that.  It's the same argument used in selling adult magazines and videos:  doesn't it exploit men as well, since they are the target market and they have to pay for it?  Similarly, I'm not advocating that women wear chadors as in Iran or burqas in Afghanistan, but something more middle-of-the-road.This was also the time that most women did not report rape because of the ensuing humiliation of a police investigation and the myth that it was her fault--hence her taking the law into her own hands.  The attacks on Jennifer are unflinchingly graphic and unsettling, which may lead many to believe that the film glorified rape, but in fact, the brutality of it serves to justify her revenge.Camille Keaton pulls in an ace performance as Jennifer in an agonizing role.  Her slight resemblance to Tori Amos reminded me of how the latter was assaulted as well.Apart from the ordeal and the revenge, much of the remainder are lulls in the drama, such as the scene at the camp sight and diner.  The only other thing I quibble is the title.

Downing,"[76, 81]","Well, now all the folks who wish writer/director Meir Zarchi would explain his controversial, infamous, and disturbing rape and revenge film can get their wish for the price of this Millennium edition DVD, which includes a feature-length commentary by Zarchi.  In this commentary, Zarchi confirms what this film's defenders (including me) have been claiming all along -- that his intention was definitely not to promote rape to his male viewers, but rather to expose the true ugliness of the crime.  He talks at length about the real-life encounter with a rape victim that inspired the film, and about the people he worked with in making it.  He also discusses the technical aspects in enough detail to prove this is not the shoddy, haphazard production some folks want to claim it is.  I also learned a few interesting facts about the film business in general.  For example, when you submit a movie to the MPAA, they'll tell you it has to be cut to get an R rating, but they won't tell you WHAT to cut.Besides answering your questions about the film, Zarchi's commentary also provides a clue as to what sort of person he is.  Overall, he comes across as intelligent, articulate, and even compassionate.However, he also comes across as a bit egotistical, which is why the second feature-length commentary by Joe Bob Briggs is useful for its more balanced perspective.  Although Briggs defends the movie, pointing out specific scenes that exemplify its anti-rape viewpoint, he's objective enough to point out flaws where he sees them.  For example, why on earth did Johnny send the mentally-challenged Matthew back to the house to kill Jennifer, when Matthew was almost certain to bungle the job?  Briggs also addresses two ethical questions that have always bothered me.  The first is whether Matthew deserves to die, and the second is whether Johnny's wife and children deserve to have their husband/father respectively taken away from them.This DVD also includes various trailers, TV spots, and posters, including some promoting the movie under its original title, DAY OF THE WOMAN.  There are also posted from a wide assortment of countries, in a wide assortment of languages.  I wish the extras had also included the original version of the opening, with the title DAY OF THE WOMAN in the credits, but maybe there are no prints in existence.So, if you want to own this movie on DVD, this is the edition to buy.

Revile it for its crudity and flinch at its relentless violence, but you'd have to admit this  film succeeds all the way in provoking some kind of response from its  audience.Personally I find I Spit on Your Grave much less exploitative  than it could have been.  Firstly, take into account that the entire story  is filmed from a neutral perspective while privileging the point of view of  Jennifer.  Secondly, note its subtle but deeply angered treatment at how a  good-hearted, friendly woman is destroyed, reborn as a sadistic avenger  lacking in heart and painfully unaware of what she's become.  The final  shot is simple brilliance, a more apt observation on Jennifer's character  change and saying much more than a direct, moralizing title card could have  (eg. Howard Hawks' Scarface).Finally, this film's most commendable (and  perhaps contentious) point is its treatment of the men, the perpetrators of  the original crime.  Although animalistic in their brutality and at times  grotesquely macho, the men's overall portrayal does not relegate them to  pure villainy.  We see moments of vulnerability, humanity (Stanley's  relationship to Johnny is especially fascinating, thanks to Aron Tabor's  multilayered performance) and even sympathy.  None of which excuses them  from their crime, as the film watches their humiliation and destruction  with as unflinching an eye as it had Jennifer's suffering at their  hands.This is essential viewing for anybody interested in feminism in  film, and the rape-revenge genre.

Big whoppin' deal. As if nudity matters. Get over the obsession with sex and nudity, and you can understand this movie.The film is actually a horror movie, and like so many other horror movies, is about crime and punishment. The rape scenes are not remotely a turn-on, the nudity is not a turn-on either. That said, Keaton is a foxy lady and an ice-cold avenging goddess. The thugs are idiots who are lucky to know how to tie their shoes. The acting is O.K., not very demanding roles.The movie was created in the golden age of feminism and is a feminist movie. The men are all dolts. The rapes are portrayed realistically, i.e., anybody with any heart or kindness or decency wouldn't be remotely aroused by any of it. The revenge scenes are the best parts of the movie; well-done, great writing.The actual idiot in this movie later became Stanford in ""Sex and the City."" How many people will recognize the walk, the movements, the look, the eyes?I give three stars only, because it is just a simple revenge flick, a simple story, the female ""Deliverance"".

I intentionally ignored it whenever I would see it on the shelf at the video rental store.  Funnily enough after so many Walking Dead episodes, I saw it on netflix and hit play and discovered an incredible kindness on the part of the filmmaker and the lead actor, Camille Keaton.Folks, THIS is what gangrape looks like.  This is what African women experienced in America, this is what the Germans called ""Joy Division"" and the Japanese called ""Comfort Women.""This SHOULD have been talked about at Womyn Center meetings.  This movie said everything about rape and it was made by an Israeli man and performed by a brave woman who evoked Boadicea in her performance.  I did NOT see anything that was described in Roger Ebert's review of the film.  I never heard of any reviews before seeing this film last night.  But I NEEDED to be educated about the Holocaust before I could have seen this film and INSTANTLY recognize it for what it is.  It's about that small town bullying that went on in backwater German hamlets where the townspeople would abuse the outsider without remorse, it's about the official start of the annhilation of foreign women as a matter of policy with no compunction or concern and the true face of the perpetrators. I found myself AMUSED by how stupid the rapists were throughout the film momentarily distracted from the crime they were committing because they are so absurd and so petty and so DIRTY.Finally, this film that I saw for the first and only time as an adult - it is not about licentiousness or exploitation.  It is DEFINITELY from the side of the rape victim.  It is not gratuitous, the woman does not go on a spree.  I wouldn't even call it revenge but we do see something inside the person that I believe was naturally already inside the lead actor - call it courage maybe - but it's a natural warrior and this is what it looks like when she is offended and you left her alive.This is a movie for feminist not for sadists or vigilantes.  This movie shows what all those episodes of Law and Order: SVU can never communicate by FORCING us to watch them gangrape her.  This is what it is like to be forced to watch Nanjing, to be forced to be lined up in NEAT rows while your fellow camp inmates are raped during a party when German soldiers want a little R&R; and head for the nearest concentration camp - maybe that's why they weren't concentrated in Germany.",5,not for the young,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,2544,"['remember', 'being', 'told', 'film', 'high', 'school', 'cafeteria', 'thinking', 'how', 'rude', 'was', 'talk', 'such', 'film', 'nevermind', 'watch', 'film', 'intentionally', 'ignored', 'whenever', 'would', 'see', 'shelf', 'video', 'rental', 'store', 'Funnily', 'enough', 'so', 'many', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'episodes', 'saw', 'netflix', 'hit', 'play', 'discovered', 'incredible', 'kindness', 'part', 'filmmaker', 'lead', 'actor', 'Camille', 'Keaton.Folks', 'THIS', 'what', 'gangrape', 'what', 'African', 'women', 'experienced', 'America', 'what', 'Germans', 'called', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Japanese', 'called', 'Comfort', 'Women', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'talked', 'Womyn', 'Center', 'meetings', 'movie', 'said', 'everything', 'rape', 'was', 'made', 'Israeli', 'man', 'performed', 'brave', 'woman', 'who', 'evoked', 'Boadicea', 'performance', 'did', 'NOT', 'see', 'anything', 'was', 'described', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'film', 'never', 'heard', 'reviews', 'seeing', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'NEEDED', 'be', 'educated', 'Holocaust', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'INSTANTLY', 'recognize', 'what', 'small', 'town', 'bullying', 'went', 'backwater', 'German', 'hamlets', 'where', 'townspeople', 'would', 'abuse', 'outsider', 'remorse', 'official', 'start', 'annhilation', 'foreign', 'women', 'matter', 'policy', 'compunction', 'concern', 'true', 'face', 'perpetrators', 'found', 'AMUSED', 'how', 'stupid', 'rapists', 'were', 'film', 'momentarily', 'distracted', 'crime', 'were', 'committing', 'are', 'so', 'absurd', 'so', 'petty', 'so', 'DIRTY.Finally', 'film', 'saw', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'adult', 'not', 'licentiousness', 'exploitation', 'DEFINITELY', 'side', 'rape', 'victim', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'woman', 'not', 'go', 'spree', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'revenge', 'do', 'see', 'something', 'person', 'believe', 'was', 'naturally', 'already', 'lead', 'actor', 'call', 'maybe', 'natural', 'warrior', 'what', 'when', 'offended', 'left', 'alive.This', 'movie', 'feminist', 'not', 'sadists', 'vigilantes', 'movie', 'what', 'episodes', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'can', 'never', 'communicate', 'FORCING', 'watch', 'gangrape', 'what', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'Nanjing', 'be', 'forced', 'be', 'lined', 'up', 'NEAT', 'rows', 'fellow', 'camp', 'inmates', 'are', 'raped', 'party', 'when', 'German', 'soldiers', 'want', 'little', 'R', 'R', 'head', 'nearest', 'concentration', 'camp', 'maybe', 'why', 'were', ""n't"", 'concentrated', 'Germany']",N/A

It's done so disarmingly that you just stare in disbelief at what has just happened. Definitely the most memorable scene in the film.As you will have gathered, this infamous film was banned by UK ( under the Video Nasties Act ) and Germany as well. It involves the story of an aspiring novelist Jennifer ( Camille Keaton ) who escapes the hustle and bustle of New York to try to finish her novel. All looks so peaceful and tranquil that you don't really expect anything to happen. But then things take a turn for the worse as Jennifer is gang raped not once, not twice but THREE times. It's awful to see this happen to anyone. The fact that she tries to crawl to her bedroom to phone the police only for her attackers to come back again and inflict more damage is just terrible.Having said that you can really see the limitations of the actual "" rape "" scenes. They use some scenes again and again that you can easily catch out and it sometimes takes a little sting out of the actual scene. Don't get me wrong, the way the guys just won't let her go and get one of them to kill her is awful but you can see the limitations the director had in trying to film the scenes.Jennifer somehow manages to survive these attacks which seems like a miracle given that she was spared being stabbed by the village idiot. Eventually he gets found out that he didn't stab her and is beaten up for not finishing off the job.Later on she decides that the only course of action she can take is revenge. Some women might enjoy this aspect while others may feel that she's stooping to their level. Whatever your view, this part of the movie is where it really kicks into gear. First off the list is the village idiot and then the ringleader who, as I mentioned in first paragraph, suffers the most awful death of the lot. And then the final two sidekicks get knocked off as well.I suppose this film can be viewed as a feminist statement of revenge being a dish best served cold. The film certainly works despite the limitations of budget and the cut-back scenes between the gang-rapists. That being the only real fault of this film. The acting is pretty good for a horror movie.

495326,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B000009O8A,Gary,"[3, 4]","Apart from that, a work of genius. I love it. A see once movie really, as it does not and cannot have the same impact twice. Very Andrea Dworkin, even the humour. Looked Scandinavian and reminded me of Bergman (Virgin Spring?) Has a memorable Boudica like climax only missing the Ride of the Valkyries on the soundtrack. Just great stuff.A writer at the time related the polarized reactions in the theatre. ""Kill the b***h!"" Reposted on the distaff side with ""right on, sister!"" Unfortunately, certain parties didn't want things out in the open and the film suffered censure. There's a book to be written on the moral questions raised by the retarded guy alone, but I'll focus on a couple of things. The pivotal moment when Jennifer lowers her gun when she has her tormentor at her mercy. Does he have a point? Yes and no. At that moment it's like she reaches an understanding with nature and Keaton's enigmatic performance nails it. Is Jennifer's transformation too sudden or was she like that from the start? Another unexpected aspect is the ridiculing of her writing. In an odd way this really gets to you more than the rape. In a stroke of genius that makes the film, Jennifer seems to become 'Mary', a fictional character or characters in her own writing, descending upon the men like some incubus and getting poetic revenge for that particular sleight. In fact, I can't make up my mind if the film is merely (?) didactic, or a poetic lament. What it has to say about sexual politics is true.Director's commentary: Unsurprisingly, Zarchi appeared to be  European, and eccentric to boot. ""Listen to the bird, she is saying: Peace on earth....peace on earth."" He constantly quotes critics but is frustratingly parsimonious with his own impressions. He distastefully describes a real life rape while the fictional one is playing out but if this tragedy motivated him to make the picture then he should elaborate. We are left hanging as to his real motives. When he quoted 'hell hath no fury', he drew unflattering comparisons with Criswell in 'Plan 9'. There is an enigmatic moment when Jennifer types after the rape. Not a peep from the director on this. Zarchi's observations of male attitudes in the film are perceptive. The guy with the axe almost hiding in fear of Jennifer at the climax. The constant references to their mothers and calling on them in crisis. Many men will recognise themselves in these attitudes and excuses so I'm not surprised to see such fervent condemnation of 'Grave', but from the director, we get less than the dicky bird he is so fond of quoting. He appears to side with the poetic aspect, but he left me feeling puzzled and uncomfortable.Briggs: Appears puzzled by the plot. Why didn't the men go in the house with matthew? Not difficult, if they want Matthew to be the fall guy, then they can't be in the same room when he's committing murder. Briggs considers the wife by the pumps scene superfluous. Surely this is one of the most telling moments in the film? I don't agree with his assertion that men shouting mysogynistic comments during theatrical performances of 'Grave' don't really mean it. It just proves to me the film was accurate in it's observations. Get it out in the open, I say. Perhaps Biggs sees the film as a lampoon, four burly men never really standing a chance against a smart cosmopolitan women from New York. Either way, I found his commentary to be largely superfluous.",4,Bathroom lock on the outside?,1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,3430,"['Apart', 'work', 'genius', 'love', 'see', 'once', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'impact', 'twice', 'Very', 'Andrea', 'Dworkin', 'even', 'humour', 'Looked', 'Scandinavian', 'reminded', 'Bergman', 'Virgin', 'Spring', 'memorable', 'Boudica', 'climax', 'only', 'missing', 'Ride', 'Valkyries', 'soundtrack', 'Just', 'great', 'stuff.A', 'writer', 'time', 'related', 'polarized', 'reactions', 'theatre', 'Kill', 'b***h', 'Reposted', 'distaff', 'side', 'right', 'sister', 'Unfortunately', 'certain', 'parties', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'things', 'out', 'open', 'film', 'suffered', 'censure', 'book', 'be', 'written', 'moral', 'questions', 'raised', 'retarded', 'guy', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'couple', 'things', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'when', 'Jennifer', 'gun', 'when', 'tormentor', 'mercy', 'have', 'point', 'Yes', 'moment', 'understanding', 'nature', 'Keaton', 'enigmatic', 'performance', 'nails', 'Jennifer', 'transformation', 'too', 'sudden', 'was', 'start', 'unexpected', 'aspect', 'ridiculing', 'writing', 'odd', 'way', 'really', 'more', 'rape', 'stroke', 'genius', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'become', ""'Mary"", 'fictional', 'character', 'characters', 'own', 'writing', 'descending', 'men', 'incubus', 'getting', 'poetic', 'revenge', 'particular', 'sleight', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'film', 'merely', 'didactic', 'poetic', 'lament', 'What', 'say', 'sexual', 'politics', 'true.Director', 'commentary', 'Unsurprisingly', 'Zarchi', 'appeared', 'be', 'European', 'eccentric', 'boot', 'Listen', 'bird', 'saying', 'Peace', 'earth', '.peace', 'earth', 'constantly', 'critics', 'frustratingly', 'parsimonious', 'own', 'impressions', 'distastefully', 'real', 'life', 'rape', 'fictional', 'one', 'playing', 'out', 'tragedy', 'motivated', 'make', 'picture', 'then', 'should', 'elaborate', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'real', 'motives', 'When', 'quoted', ""'hell"", 'fury', 'drew', 'unflattering', 'comparisons', 'Criswell', '9', 'enigmatic', 'moment', 'when', 'Jennifer', 'rape', 'Not', 'peep', 'director', 'Zarchi', 'observations', 'male', 'attitudes', 'film', 'are', 'perceptive', 'guy', 'axe', 'almost', 'hiding', 'fear', 'Jennifer', 'climax', 'constant', 'references', 'mothers', 'calling', 'crisis', 'Many', 'men', 'will', 'recognise', 'attitudes', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'see', 'such', 'fervent', 'condemnation', ""'Grave"", 'director', 'get', 'less', 'dicky', 'bird', 'so', 'fond', 'quoting', 'side', 'poetic', 'aspect', 'left', 'feeling', 'puzzled', 'uncomfortable.Briggs', 'Appears', 'puzzled', 'plot', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'men', 'go', 'house', 'matthew', 'Not', 'difficult', 'want', 'Matthew', 'be', 'fall', 'guy', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'room', 'when', 'committing', 'murder', 'Briggs', 'wife', 'pumps', 'scene', 'superfluous', 'Surely', 'one', 'most', 'telling', 'moments', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'assertion', 'men', 'shouting', 'mysogynistic', 'comments', 'theatrical', 'performances', ""'Grave"", 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'mean', 'just', 'film', 'was', 'accurate', 'observations', 'Get', 'out', 'open', 'say', 'Perhaps', 'Biggs', 'film', 'lampoon', 'four', 'burly', 'men', 'never', 'really', 'standing', 'chance', 'smart', 'cosmopolitan', 'women', 'New', 'York', 'way', 'found', 'commentary', 'be', 'largely', 'superfluous']",N/A

The reason why  this film has such an impact is because it is so realistic; because of the  lack of music, the great acting, and most importantly, the fact that the  film is so subtle. In the rape and the murder scenes, the viewer sees very  little; there is hardly any gore or graphicness.  That is not  irresponsible, that is brilliant film making.

When the entirety of the remaining minutes fall into the categories of gruesome rape or brutal revenge for the rape, then you know you're watching the controversial classic,I Spit on Your Grave.Director Meir Zarchi's produced this assault on human decency in the late 70s, and it's as resonant now as it was then.  Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton) secludes herself to a small wooded Connecticut town to write her newest novel.  When she attracts the attention of a few local deviants and their retarded friend, however, she ends up with a life altering experience that dwarfs any possible story she could write.  When she plans her revenge, however, the story, specifically the second most disgusting bathtub scene in cinema history (the first is with a naked Kathy Bates), celebrates revenge that knows no boundaries.From beginning to end, this movie transfixes the viewer with an indelible image of betrayal, rape, and revenge that is seared into memory.  Seeing a group of four men, one of which is mentally handicapped, brutalize an innocent women multiple times - all with a harmonica performance from one of the criminals - is something that never leaves one's memory; and I'm surprised the harmonica in this movie is not compared to the infamous banjo in Deliverance.It's quite interesting that multiple decades after this film, the Western audience has made a movement - good or bad is up for interpretation - making the type of depravity seen in the current torture porn flicks acceptable to view, even on prime time television, yet the filming of a rape is still considered taboo and unwatchable.  The reluctance to air this film, despite the ever-widening audience toleration, truly displays how gruesome and memorable this groundbreaking exploitation film was when released.  Zarchi explains in the commentary that this not about celebrating a crime and inspiring the sick minded.  He wanted to expose the sheer disgust that should be associated with rape, to break the boundaries of tolerance, to disturb all but the sociopath.  Given this film's legacy, I'd say Zarchi succeeded in his quest.This is the pinnacle of the rape/revenge genre, and should be watched by fans of both horror and overall cinema history...just don't expect to feel good when the credits roll.",4,The pinnacle of rape/revenge,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,2471,"['When', 'movie', 'basically', 'off', 'writer', 'retiring', 'remote', 'cabin', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'there', 'first', 'visit', 'skinny', 'dip', 'know', 'are', 'watching', '70s', 'horror', 'When', 'entirety', 'remaining', 'minutes', 'fall', 'categories', 'gruesome', 'rape', 'brutal', 'revenge', 'rape', 'then', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'controversial', 'classic', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave.Director', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', 'produced', 'assault', 'human', 'decency', 'late', '70s', 'resonant', 'now', 'was', 'then', 'Jennifer', 'Hill', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'small', 'wooded', 'Connecticut', 'town', 'write', 'newest', 'novel', 'When', 'attention', 'few', 'local', 'deviants', 'retarded', 'friend', 'however', 'up', 'life', 'altering', 'experience', 'possible', 'story', 'could', 'write', 'When', 'revenge', 'however', 'story', 'specifically', 'second', 'most', 'disgusting', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'cinema', 'history', 'first', 'naked', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'revenge', 'boundaries.From', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'viewer', 'indelible', 'image', 'betrayal', 'rape', 'revenge', 'seared', 'memory', 'Seeing', 'group', 'four', 'men', 'one', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'brutalize', 'innocent', 'women', 'multiple', 'times', 'harmonica', 'performance', 'one', 'criminals', 'something', 'never', 'one', 'memory', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'harmonica', 'movie', 'not', 'compared', 'infamous', 'banjo', 'Deliverance.It', 'quite', 'interesting', 'multiple', 'decades', 'film', 'Western', 'audience', 'made', 'movement', 'good', 'bad', 'up', 'interpretation', 'making', 'type', 'depravity', 'seen', 'current', 'torture', 'porn', 'flicks', 'acceptable', 'view', 'even', 'prime', 'time', 'television', 'filming', 'rape', 'still', 'considered', 'taboo', 'unwatchable', 'reluctance', 'air', 'film', 'ever-widening', 'audience', 'toleration', 'truly', 'how', 'gruesome', 'memorable', 'groundbreaking', 'exploitation', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'released', 'Zarchi', 'commentary', 'not', 'celebrating', 'crime', 'inspiring', 'sick', 'minded', 'wanted', 'expose', 'sheer', 'disgust', 'should', 'be', 'associated', 'rape', 'break', 'boundaries', 'tolerance', 'disturb', 'sociopath', 'Given', 'film', 'legacy', ""'d"", 'say', 'Zarchi', 'succeeded', 'quest.This', 'pinnacle', 'rape/revenge', 'genre', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'fans', 'horror', 'overall', 'cinema', 'history', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'feel', 'good', 'when', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A
495337,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000009O8A,Jeffrey Leach,"[2, 4]","""I Spit On Your Grave"" has a rather remarkable history for an exploitation film. I vividly remember a little video store close to where I lived ten years ago or so placed this film in their adult section, apparently concerned that the disturbing images within were so dangerous that only those interested in the latest Ron Jeremy release could appreciate them. Director Meir Zarchi, a definite one shot wonder if there ever was one, continues to squeeze every drop of coin out of his film as possible. How many different versions of this movie is this guy going to release? A ""Millennium Edition""? Are you kidding me? I have spent some time viewing several of the more extreme entries in the exploitation genre, and I can confidently state that ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is one of the more milder contributions to that exalted field. If you want to watch something truly mind boggling, track down a copy of Ruggiero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust."" The fact that Zarchi's film got a widespread DVD release while Deodato's little gem remains mired in virtual obscurity constitutes one of the great crimes in the B movie arena. Still, ""I Spit On Your Grave"" does have a message for those willing to sit down and watch it.In what must have shocked New York filmgoers who screened this exploitation piece in one of the grindhouse theaters in the 1970s, ""I Spit On Your Grave"" concerns the brutalizing of a young girl from the Big Apple named Jennifer Hill during a sojourn she makes into rural upstate New York in order to write a novel while slumming around in a riverfront cabin. Jenny, played by a very pretty Camille Keaton, almost immediately runs into four local losers when she stops at a gas station near her rented house. These four goons, after learning that one of their gang has never spent time with a woman, arrive at the brilliant idea of launching a full frontal assault on Jennifer. They don't immediately overwhelm her, of course, but rather build up to it by slowly terrorizing her. They cruise by her digs on a noisy motorboat, distracting her from her writing with their hoots and hollers. Our gang of rural cretins finally makes their move when they discover Jennifer out on the river in a little row boat. Using their big, bad powerboat, the gang hijacks the unfortunate lass's vessel and tows her to shore.What follows are several distressing scenes of rape and violence, sequences that drag on for what seems like hours as the gang has their fun, lets Jenny go, and then reappears for more nightmarish activities. After this lengthy degradation finally, mercifully comes to a close, the criminals force one of their crew to go dispatch Hill with a knife. Regrettably, for these tough guys who seek to erase the evidence of their monstrous endeavors, the man they pick to do the deed suffers from a mental disability and cannot muster enough nerve to go through with the ultimate crime. Big mistake. Jennifer recovers from her injuries and begins to plot her revenge against her tormentors. Making good use of that old adage about a ""woman scorned,"" Jenny uses her feminine wiles to lure and ultimately murder the four men who committed such nauseating violations. What you would think would provide plenty of gory thrills turns out to be a rather tepid series of revenge killings. One of the men dies when Jenny hangs him from a tree, another in a bathtub when Hill applies a knife to a most cringe worthy area, and the final two in the river. The movie ends with Jenny roaring down the river in a motorboat, seemingly sated by her well laid plans.Several things do actually work in ""I Spit On Your Grave."" The willowy, pretty Camille Keaton lounging around her house at the beginning of the film in her bikini is nice (but definitely not later, when the horror begins), but doesn't inspire me to admire in any way the activities of the men in the film, one of whom eventually tells his victim that she was ""asking for it"" because she wore revealing clothing. I can appreciate what Zarchi tried to do with his nasty little shocker: present a picture of rape that is both as realistic as possible and as disturbing as possible. The director does achieve the desired effect, I think, by showing how such a despicable crime degrades everyone involved in it. What didn't work was the mediocre script, especially when Jennifer Hill goes on her vengeful rampage. The fact that these guys willingly went along with a woman they terrorized just two weeks previously seemed amazingly contrived. I am willing to believe these men are stupid, but not THAT stupid. If a woman who suffered such a horrific incident as Jenny did decided to strike back, I think it would probably resemble something like serial killer Eileen Wuornos's rampage rather than ""I Spit On Your Grave."" Women simply don't go on killing sprees against their attackers, and even nowadays often don't report rape to the police.The DVD I watched contained a trailer for the film and a widescreen transfer of the nicely restored picture. ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is definitely a film with a message and worth watching once, but I recommend renting instead of buying it. If you like viewing Zarchi's film on a regular basis, you probably have some problems that need addressing soon, preferably at a place where nice men in white jackets can introduce you to the wonderful world of Thorazine.",4,Message Film That Will Shock,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,5362,"['Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'history', 'exploitation', 'film', 'vividly',

495338,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000009O8A,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[7, 7]","""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a film that will never be accepted as a serious piece of film-making. This is thanks in part to the gratuitous rape and murder scenes, which don't exactly hold back the shocks; and it's also due to the time in which it was made. These days, as proved by the likes of ""Irreversible,"" films tackling rape in a shocking and disgusting way are more readily accepted, and even gain a strong reaction from many critics.""I Spit on Your Grave"" has surprisingly good production values. While the acting often lets it down, the cinematography and even the script are more than decent and this helps the film in it's bid to get the praise it deserves. Three local twenty-some-thing's and the town idiot snatch her in the woods, take turns rapping and tormenting her, and in an obviously moronic move, put the dumb guy in charge of killing her. Well, he just can't do it and when she recovers she gets even.There is nothing sexual or provocative in this picture. The director wanted to show what it's like to be raped and the after effects of such a traumatizing event. He went through great lengths in research and from his own personnel experience. I found it to be a very different film than all of the others that deal with the same subject matter. The film-making (for a first time director) was very well done and for the most part the acting was up to par for that time frame.Other than that it's a genuine film under all the gore and fact that our protagonist spends nearly 80% of the film completely naked. Jennifer's emotions are as exposed as her body, her transformation from normality, to victim, through recovery and finally as executionerP.S.

495339,A1HWOYYFOPI6HT,B000009O8A,"J. Givens ""There are many here among us who b...","[1, 2]","The premise of this film is great and simple: revenge.  While not original, it still has merits.  It's probably been used more times as a plot element throughout human history than anything except love.  To elaborate a bit, the plot revolves around a woman who is viciously raped by a gang of depraved locals while on a summer retreat from NY City to work on a novel in a small country town.  But a great premise alone does not make a good film.The foundation (its premise) is the only thing this film has going for itself. The acting is extremely bad (amateurish would be a too kind), especially considering the lame dialogue, the pacing of the movie excruciatingly slow, and you can find better examples of cinematography on YouTube.Did I mention the acting is bad?  The acting is bad by any standard.  I've seen better acting by porn stars - see Sasha Grey and Traci Lords.  I've seen better acting IN a porn movie.  No wait... I've seen better acting by a cereal box in a commercial.  If the corpse of Laurence Olivier were to be disinterred and put in a film, it would have better screen presence than all of the actors in this film combined.  The acting is atrocious.  The rape scenes, while graphic, are completely unbelievable, comical, in fact.  My brain was confused.  I didn't know whether to be shocked or laugh at the acting of the men.  A film like this, as with many others, relies on the ""suspension of disbelief.""  If you can't convince the audience that what their watching is plausible, then you'll most likely lose them.Not only was the acting horrible, but the characters were utterly stereotypical, painfully so.  The villains consist of a group of degenerate country locals: the leader, a few cronies, and the town idiot.  The town idiot was particularly annoying!  I couldn't help but think of ""Scary Movie"" and Officer Doofy[...]Another complaint is the pacing.  The film takes entirely too long to setup the plot.  It was a wasted effort.  It seems like nearly half of the film is wasted waiting for the rape scene.  The characters are so ""flat"" and one-dimensional that it can't be argued that the pacing of the film is being used to develop the characters.  And the character dialogue is so boring that it only causes the film to drag along at the pace of a bike rider at a NASCAR event.  There's nothing intriguing or captivating about the dialogue.  There's nothing to hold you - no effort is made to interest the viewer in the main character or give insight into the villains or anything worthwhile.What do I like about the film, you are probably asking - besides the aforementioned premise?  I honestly loved the main character.  I loved the revenge she took out on her attackers - and it is brutal!!!  She basically uses guerrilla tactics to overcome a stronger and more numerous enemy. She divides and conquers.  She uses fear, uncertainty, weakness, distraction, and concern over each other to lure her enemies in and eliminate them.  The second half of the film actually makes watching it worth the experience.The film is shocking, no doubt, but I've seen worse.  I'm a horror film fan and, generally, not a big fan of torture porn, which is what I'd say best describes this film.  In fact, I'd say it helped to spawn the whole genre.  It's worth watching once, but I can't say I'd ever watch it again.  I'm actually now looking forward to the remake, which will come out this year.

This movie is about revenge and I also believe it tackles an interesting subject-RAPE. Rape is a subject most often portrayed in a mild manner, however in this film it is portrayed in a very graphic nature. This is something that should not be taking place in the world- but it does.The movie may be offensive to some people because of the brutal and graphic rape sequences.Originally titled Day of the Woman, which fits the film quite well, is unequaled in my opinion by any other film in the genre.This is the most graphic and brutal portrayal of rape EVER brought to the screen.This film is quite good and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they can stomach it!!! This film is not for the squeamish.See it at your own risk!!!NOTE: This film was originally released with an X rating because of the graphic rape sequences!!!One must be open-minded when viewing this film. Let's keep in mind that this is ONLY a movie!!! However, it touches base with an important subject- rape. This portrays rape realistically(very violently) and in actuality it is that way. It is mean and hateful and one of the many bad things that take place in the world. So to portray it mildly would be incorrect!!I have never seen a more violent and vile movie, but I give credit where it is due- they got their point across!!!After watching this movie, you will come to know RAPE(as wrong as it is) and you will witness it first hand.Finally, you will never be the same again!! No one should ever have to deal with the pain of rape...but to disregard this movie as garbage is quite wrong!My advice is to view this movie with an open mind!!!!!In doing so, you will see this movie for what it is- ART!!!This movie is a work of art and the message is that rape is a terrible part of our society, but yet it is a part of our society and this movie helps us to understand that rape does happpen and most importantly, that it SHOULDN'T!!!!!",5,A HORROR MOVIE CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!,1010534400,"01 9, 2002",2002,1985,"['movie', 'few', 'others', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'movie', 'revenge', 'also', 'believe', 'interesting', 'subject-RAPE', 'Rape', 'subject', 'most', 'often', 'portrayed', 'mild', 'manner', 'however', 'film', 'portrayed', 'very', 'graphic', 'nature', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'world-', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'offensive', 'people', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'rape', 'sequences.Originally', 'titled', 'Day', 'Woman', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'unequaled', 'opinion', 'other', 'film', 'genre.This', 'most', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'portrayal', 'rape', 'EVER', 'brought', 'screen.This', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'stomach', 'film', 'not', 'squeamish.See', 'own', 'risk', 'NOTE', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'X', 'rating', 'graphic', 'rape', 'sequences', 'One', 'must', 'be', 'open-minded', 'when', 'viewing', 'film', 'Let', 'keep', 'mind', 'ONLY', 'movie', 'However', 'base', 'important', 'subject-', 'rape', 'rape', 'realistically', 'very', 'violently', 'actuality', 'way', 'mean', 'hateful', 'one', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'take', 'place', 'world', 'So', 'portray', 'mildly', 'would', 'be', 'incorrect', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'violent', 'vile', 'movie', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due-', 'got', 'point', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'come', 'know', 'RAPE', 'as', 'wrong', 'will', 'witness', 'first', 'hand.Finally', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'one', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'deal', 'pain', 'rape', 'disregard', 'movie', 'garbage', 'quite', 'wrong', 'advice', 'view', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'what', 'is-', 'ART', 'movie', 'work', 'art', 'message', 'rape', 'terrible', 'part', 'society', 'yet', 'part', 'society', 'movie', 'understand', 'rape', 'happpen', 'most', 'importantly', 'SHOULD', ""N'T""]",N/A

However she soon starts taking revenge on the men in horrific ways.A highly disturbing and revolting horror thriller from writer-director Meir Zarichi is one of the most infamous films of all time! since 1978 and 1980, this movie was widely banned or censored in some countries.

It has became legendary and a best seller in the video market back in the 80s and 90s as it still has the power to shock and appall viewers, this movie was near an X rating as it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic rape.

While the first two were killed separately, the last two were killed together, I admit the ax in the back was great, but the boat motor's slicing and dicing was not that realistic. I mean who would climb into a boat on top of the motor?You would almost think that this film was written and directed by a militant feminist. I mean the four men are just so dumb. Would they really expect a rape victim to suddenly come on to them and want their company? And why would the four men discuss rape, murder, and body decomposition in a tiny and crowded ice cream parlor at a volume where everyone can hear?People can say what they want about this film, it's trash, it has no value, etc. But how many of the thousands of movies over the last thirty or forty years can claim the same?

Whatever genre this film is classified in...horror, exploitation, action, drama...it is a must see. The cheap cinematography, grainy texture, and tense atmosphere are a few of the highpoints of this film. It is also the most brutal and accurate depiction of the terrible atrocity of rape I have ever viewed. I want to make readily known however, that this film SHOULD NEVER BE VIEWED BY A MINOR UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! This film is highly graphic and very disturbing, and should only be viewed by adults who know what this film contains. Highly recommended, highly warned.",4,CAUTION!!

As a woman I was rooting for the heroine and I must admit I was a little disappointed in the ease with which she dispatched three of her assailants.  Her revenge on Matthew was ""OK"" but I would have liked to have seen a little blood and gore.  When I first saw the bathtub scene between the heroine and Johnny I was a little nauseated by all the blood but I couldn't help but laugh at the way she dispatched him.

Some may just happen to hire and view the film by chance and laugh through it at some of the rapes and especially Jennifer's revenge on each rapist, but what I see and understand with each viewing is that as I interpret it, that it has an important message throughout out it, and in each scene. I really like this film, and I know in saying that, that it can be confusing for other people to understand that especially if they don't like or deeply understand the film as I do. I think it's a important film out there in the world and that it really says something if analised and watching each performance carefully. The beautiful Camille Keaton did a wonderful,honest,brave, spellbinding, mesmerising job as Jennifer Hills.The other actors who played the rapists were very good in their roles and pulled it off convincinly. One day while watching 'I Spit', my brother watched some of it and commented that the actors who were the rapists were crap. I believe that, that wasn't the case, it was just that they did such a convincing job that it somehow does affect the viewer. 'I Spit': Millennium Edition is worth the buy, the 2 commentaries are very informative. The Joe Bob Briggs one is excellent and I learnt quiet a lot, The Meir Zarchi one is good and more informative about some of the behind the scenes stuff, and it's very interesting to hear Meir tell his sad tale about a real rape that happened which in spired him to write 'I Spit'.

495355,A1PWHYY673OKZA,B000009O8A,Kablamo!,"[26, 28]","I am so tired of reading posts about how somebody ""can't believe that anyone would watch this trash,"" ""this movie is a waste of time,"" etc. I am equally tired of reading the obligatory disclaimers that every supporter of this movie seems to include in posts about how watching a rape scene is so difficult, and implying that a rape scene is the most horrible thing that can possibly be filmed.I think it's interesting that rape is so taboo, but just about any other form of violence is not at all. Look at Silence of the Lambs, for instance. That is a critically acclaimed movie that is aired on network TV at least twice a year, and it seems to be the sort of gruesome torture movie that the whole family can love! How is Buffalo Bill's serial-killing of women, and torturing of women by keeping them in a well in his basement, less disturbing than a woman being raped?That movie not graphic enough for the argument to be valid? How about the new (and thoroughly crappy) movie, Hostel. Aside from the fact that the movie is just not a good film in the genre, look at its content: in one scene, a young girl is tortured so that her eye is removed from its socket and her face is severely burned. Now I have to ask... how is ISOYG's Jennifer's ordeal even remotely comparable to that girl's? At least Jennifer has a full physical recovery and even gets to exact revenge on all of her perpetrators!And yet ISOYG exists only in a sort of underground world where most people who watch it and find it to be a satisfying film would be quite hesitant to admit so in mixed company. All because of the rape.Personally, I thought this movie was fantastic because I am driven toward and satisfied by movies that strike me as being very real and generate a strong emotional response from me. I found the characters and plot to be quite believable, and the film aesthetic to be thoroughly creepy. Like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the documentary feel and the horror-juxtaposed-with-beautiful-scenery was very effective, and it reminds me of how often, in real life, there is crazy stuff going on beneath a picturesque veneer. There were so many intelligent, small details in this movie that contribute to its realness. Most Steven Spielberg flicks do not achieve that.ISOYG has to be one of my favorite films of all time because I was utterly transfixed throughout the entire viewing, emotionally connected to it. I will never forget several of the scenes. How many films do that? I can count those that I've seen on two hands, and I have seen a LOT of movies. Further, I can't help but feel like I learned something by watching this film and all of the thinking that it stimulates about our world. These kinds of scenes play out in life every day (just watch the news) and perhaps you ignore them at your peril.The world I live in is mostly civilized and happy. I watch a lot of movies, and few of them are horror. I would never in a million years intentionally hurt another person except in defense (or maybe in revenge, in the moment, who knows). So I don't feel guilty about watching this or enjoying it. I'm glad I can watch it from the comfort and safety of my sofa, and I hope that's the only place I'll ever see it. But if I should ever find myself the victim of something like this, perhaps I will handle it a little better without having the naivete of those who would refuse to watch such ""garbage.""",5,Why most people who hate this movie just don't get it...,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,3398,"['am', 'so', 'tired', 'reading', 'posts', 'how', 'somebody', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'would', 'watch', 'trash', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'etc', 'am', 'equally', 'tired', 'reading', 'obligatory', 'disclaimers', 'supporter', 'movie', 'include', 'posts', 'how', 'watching', 'rape', 'scene', 'so', 'difficult', 'implying', 'rape', 'scene', 'most', 'horrible', 'thing', 'can', 'possibly', 'be', 'filmed.I', 'think', 'interesting', 'rape', 'so', 'taboo', 'just', 'other', 'form', 'violence', 'not', 'Look', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'instance', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'movie', 'aired', 'network', 'TV', 'least', 'twice', 'year', 'be', 'sort', 'gruesome', 'torture', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'love', 'How', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'serial-killing', 'women', 'torturing', 'women', 'keeping', 'well', 'basement', 'less', 'disturbing', 'woman', 'being', 'raped', 'movie', 'not', 'graphic', 'enough', 'argument', 'be', 'valid', 'How', 'new', 'thoroughly', 'crappy', 'movie', 'Hostel', 'Aside', 'fact', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'genre', 'look', 'content', 'one', 'scene', 'young', 'girl', 'tortured', 'so', 'eye', 'removed', 'socket', 'face', 'severely', 'burned', 'Now', 'have', 'ask', 'how', 'ISOYG', 'Jennifer', 'ordeal', 'even', 'remotely', 'comparable', 'girl', 'least', 'Jennifer', 'full', 'physical', 'recovery', 'even', 'exact', 'revenge', 'perpetrators', 'yet', 'ISOYG', 'only', 'sort', 'underground', 'world', 'where', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'find', 'be', 'satisfying', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'hesitant', 'admit', 'so', 'mixed', 'company', 'rape.Personally', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'am', 'driven', 'satisfied', 'movies', 'strike', 'being', 'very', 'real', 'generate', 'strong', 'emotional', 'response', 'found', 'characters', 'plot', 'be', 'quite', 'believable', 'film', 'aesthetic', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'creepy', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'documentary', 'feel', 'horror-juxtaposed-with-beautiful-scenery', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'how', 'often', 'real', 'life', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'going', 'beneath', 'picturesque', 'veneer', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'intelligent', 'small', 'details', 'movie', 'realness', 'Most', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'flicks', 'do', 'not', 'achieve', 'that.ISOYG', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'was', 'utterly', 'transfixed', 'entire', 'viewing', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'several', 'scenes', 'How', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'can', 'count', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'hands', 'have', 'seen', 'LOT', 'movies', 'Further', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'learned', 'something', 'watching', 'film', 'thinking', 'world', 'kinds', 'scenes', 'play', 'out', 'life', 'day', 'just', 'watch', 'news', 'perhaps', 'ignore', 'peril.The', 'world', 'live', 'mostly', 'civilized', 'happy', 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', 'few', 'are', 'horror', 'would', 'never', 'million', 'years', 'intentionally', 'hurt', 'person', 'defense', 'maybe', 'revenge', 'moment', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'guilty', 'watching', 'enjoying', ""'m"", 'glad', 'can', 'watch', 'comfort', 'safety', 'sofa', 'hope', 'only', 'place', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'should', 'ever', 'find', 'victim', 'something', 'perhaps', 'will', 'handle', 'little', 'better', 'having', 'naivete', 'who', 'would', 'refuse', 'watch', 'such', 'garbage']",N/A

But after recently coming across it while channel surfing one night out of boredom, I couldn't help but watch it. It certainly is a controversial film in and of itself and probably the most controversial film to come out of the 1970s.I Spit On Your Grave has the stunningly beautiful Camille Keaton star as short story writer, Jennifer Hills. Hoping to escape the everyday life of the rambunctious New York City, Jennifer travels to an isolated lakehouse out in the country for the Summer to work on her novel. However, her peaceful stay is cut short.While relaxing in her canoe one afternoon, she's abducted by 2 dirty country boys, Stanley and Andy, who use their speedboat to tow hers to shore. She tries to escape through the woods but she's grabbed by Andy and Stanley's friend, Johnny. The 3 lowlifes tackle Jennifer to the ground and rip her top and bikini off. Their other friend, Matthew, who Jennifer befriended the day before, stands to the side, refusing to take part in what he's witnessing. Jennifer proceeds to get raped by Johnny before being anally raped by Andy. Jennifer helplessly crawls back to her cabin and tries to call the police but the 4 men refuse to leave her alone as they follow her back to her cabin, where Matthew ends up falling to the peer pressure and rapes Jennifer as she passes out from exhaustion aFeeling satisfied, the 4 dirty degenerates leave Jennifer for dead; naked and humbled in the middle of her living room floor. A few weeks later, as Jennifer revives from her humiliating and traumatizing experience, she makes deadly plans to have her vengeance against the 4 who wronged her. Andy, Matthew, Johnny, and Stanley may have gotten away with raping poor Jennifer; but as long as she's breathing in and out, she'll make sure they never live to talk about it.Overall: It wasn't often that controversial films got made back in the day, but when they did, they became a big deal. I Spit On Your Grave was probably the first controversial movie made that would lead to many other controversial movies that'd be made going down the line such as 1980's Cannibal Holocaust that was made 2 year after this movie was released. Many people have different opinions on this movie. Some say it glorifies violence against women, while others say it teaches a lesson on the reality of what men do to women. I personally say that it teaches a lesson. If the men had just raped her and the movie ended right there, then yes, maybe it would glorify violence against women. But the woman comes back with a vengeance and takes out the men who did what they did to her. I Spit On Your Grave is a horror movie. It shows the horrific reality of how some men treat women like meat back then and even today and I believe it even gives out a warning message to people on how others will strike back when you wrong them. I Spit On Your Grave is definitely not a nominee for Movie Night and probably shouldn't even watch with your best friends but it's definitely a film that will mess with your mind...and maybe even your emotions",5,Perhaps One of The Most Controversial Films of All Time (Partial Spoilers),1404691200,"07 7, 2014",2014,3139,"['had', 'never', 'cared', 'seeing', 'movie', 'hearing', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'recently', 'coming', 'channel', 'surfing', 'one', 'night', 'boredom', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'certainly', 'controversial', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'controversial', 'film', 'come', '1970s.I', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'star', 'short', 'story', 'writer', 'Jennifer', 'Hills', 'Hoping', 'escape', 'everyday', 'life', 'rambunctious', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Jennifer', 'isolated', 'lakehouse', 'country', 'Summer', 'work', 'novel', 'However', 'peaceful', 'stay', 'cut', 'short.While', 'relaxing', 'canoe', 'one', 'afternoon', 'abducted', '2', 'dirty', 'country', 'boys', 'Stanley', 'Andy', 'who', 'use', 'speedboat', 'tow', 'hers', 'shore', 'escape', 'woods', 'grabbed', 'Andy', 'Stanley', 'friend', 'Johnny', '3', 'lowlifes', 'tackle', 'Jennifer', 'ground', 'rip', 'top', 'bikini', 'off', 'other', 'friend', 'Matthew', 'who', 'Jennifer', 'befriended', 'day', 'side', 'refusing', 'take', 'part', 'what', 'witnessing', 'Jennifer', 'get', 'raped', 'Johnny', 'being', 'anally', 'raped', 'Andy', 'Jennifer', 'helplessly', 'back', 'cabin', 'tries', 'call', 'police', '4', 'men', 'refuse', 'leave', 'alone', 'follow', 'back', 'cabin', 'where', 'Matthew', 'up', 'falling', 'peer', 'pressure', 'rapes', 'Jennifer', 'out', 'exhaustion', 'aFeeling', 'satisfied', '4', 'dirty', 'degenerates', 'leave', 'Jennifer', 'dead', 'naked', 'humbled', 'middle', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'Jennifer', 'humiliating', 'traumatizing', 'experience', 'deadly', 'plans', 'have', 'vengeance', '4', 'who', 'wronged', 'Andy', 'Matthew', 'Johnny', 'Stanley', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'raping', 'poor', 'Jennifer', 'as', 'long', 'breathing', ""'ll"", 'make', 'sure', 'never', 'live', 'talk', 'it.Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'often', 'controversial', 'films', 'got', 'made', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'did', 'became', 'big', 'deal', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'controversial', 'movie', 'made', 'would', 'lead', 'many', 'other', 'controversial', 'movies', ""'d"", 'be', 'made', 'going', 'line', 'such', '1980', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'made', '2', 'year', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'opinions', 'movie', 'say', 'violence', 'women', 'others', 'say', 'lesson', 'reality', 'what', 'men', 'do', 'women', 'personally', 'say', 'lesson', 'men', 'had', 'just', 'raped', 'movie', 'ended', 'right', 'there', 'then', 'yes', 'maybe', 'would', 'glorify', 'violence', 'women', 'woman', 'back', 'vengeance', 'out', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'horror', 'movie', 'horrific', 'reality', 'how', 'men', 'treat', 'women', 'meat', 'back', 'then', 'even', 'today', 'believe', 'even', 'out', 'warning', 'message', 'people', 'how', 'others', 'will', 'strike', 'back', 'when', 'wrong', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'definitely', 'not', 'nominee', 'Movie', 'Night', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'best', 'friends', 'definitely', 'film', 'will', 'mess', 'mind', 'maybe', 'even', 'emotions']",N/A

I gave it only 3 stars because, even though it was well done, I found it to be truly shocking in it's portrayal of female degradation. If this movie was meant to shock, it did a really good job. If you take the chance I strongly recommend an adult only audience.I'm not going to bore you with the story line as it's in all the other reviews. What I will tell you is this movie stirred up a plethora of emotions in me; some I didn't even know existed. I was stupefied, horrified, angered, and it scared the hell out of me, all at the same time. The degradation, humiliation, and assault endured by the key character in this movie are beyond comprehension. The revenge she takes on her assailants is equally disturbing.On the flip-side of the coin (human psychological instead of physical male/female), if I were to review this movie solely on the message behind it all, from my perception any way, I would probably give it 5 stars. Survival and revenge...inherently human characteristics...and...whether you admit it or not, we all have them! You have to stand in awe of the absolute strength of the key character's resolve to survive and exact revenge. It speaks volumes about us and our ability to endure.

Like this film, which I'd always heard about as a cult classic and it was on Netflix.In this 1970s version of 'I Spit On Your Grave', a title that has nothing to do with anything, we meet Jenny Hill, a beautiful New Yorker spending a summer in a secluded lakeside area to write her first novel. Innocent enough. Except for the local gang of men, who decide to have their fun with a lone woman in the woods. They stalk her, rape her repeatedly, beat her brutally and then attempt to kill her. After weeks of recovery, Jenny's rage is the only solace as her world is fractured and will always be. She plots her revenge, carefully and methodically, and detachedly but effectively. This is not a film you 'enjoy' or even 'like' but most definitely may despise and hate. It is a film of experience and emotion--of the audience.What is more disturbing, that there are exploitive films like this? Or that I watched the whole thing? Or that I knew the plot and still watched it? Or that while it made me think, I am not as disgusted as I should be? There is something to be said about shock value and in horror films like this one, and others--likeIrreversible (English Subtitled;Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition&The Girl Next Door--where they insidiously cull the viewers to be participants in the acts of terror and primal violence by not looking away. We flinch, we gasp in repugnance but watch it, and that is what's chilling and horrific.I neither disliked or liked this movie but there were many ethical and moral questions that arises from such a movie that involves gang rape of the worst type of violence, and how that is handled. I felt the impact of that and I'm not sure what to think. Jenny wins, but does she? The evil guys get what they deserve, but did they? There is a weird sense of satisfaction when Jenny takes matters into her own hands, but by what design did she aid in her own self-destruction? By exacting her revenge, does she become as vile as the men who violated her? There are no winners and losers in this story. This is a movie to shock, and it does, but whether the director and writer attempted to expound a social and cultural view on rape and the aftereffects of the act, is the question; and if they did not factor in the deliberate psychological and traumatic terror, were they irresponsible in handling the whole film entirely? Yes and no. Horror movies are meant to be thoughtless and visual, taping into the most visceral part of humans, fear. If I gain more than that, I took it more seriously than was intended, and in that, this film was (too) successful.",3,"Horror porn: psychological, graphic, brutal...and hard to look away.",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2824,"['types', 'horror', 'play', 'safe', 'spooky', 'sleight', 'hand', 'tricks', 'desensitizing', 'predictable', 'boring', 'gore', 'blood', 'take', 'off', 'beaten', 'path', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'wanted', 'go', 'there', 'film', ""'d"", 'always', 'heard', 'cult', 'classic', 'was', 'Netflix.In', '1970s', 'version', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'title', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'meet', 'Jenny', 'Hill', 'beautiful', 'New', 'Yorker', 'spending', 'summer', 'secluded', 'lakeside', 'area', 'write', 'first', 'novel', 'Innocent', 'enough', 'local', 'gang', 'men', 'who', 'decide', 'have', 'fun', 'lone', 'woman', 'woods', 'stalk', 'rape', 'repeatedly', 'beat', 'brutally', 'then', 'attempt', 'kill', 'weeks', 'recovery', 'Jenny', 'rage', 'only', 'solace', 'world', 'fractured', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'plots', 'revenge', 'carefully', 'methodically', 'detachedly', 'effectively', 'not', 'film', ""'enjoy"", 'even', 'most', 'definitely', 'may', 'despise', 'hate', 'film', 'experience', 'emotion', 'audience.What', 'more', 'disturbing', 'are', 'exploitive', 'films', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'knew', 'plot', 'still', 'watched', 'made', 'think', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'disgusted', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'shock', 'value', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'others', 'likeIrreversible', 'English', 'Subtitled', 'Dragon', 'Tattoo', 'Trilogy', 'Extended', 'Edition', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'where', 'insidiously', 'cull', 'viewers', 'be', 'participants', 'acts', 'terror', 'primal', 'violence', 'not', 'looking', 'away', 'flinch', 'gasp', 'repugnance', 'watch', 'what', 'chilling', 'horrific.I', 'disliked', 'liked', 'movie', 'were', 'many', 'ethical', 'moral', 'questions', 'such', 'movie', 'gang', 'rape', 'worst', 'type', 'violence', 'how', 'handled', 'felt', 'impact', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'Jenny', 'wins', 'evil', 'guys', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'did', 'weird', 'sense', 'satisfaction', 'when', 'Jenny', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'what', 'design', 'did', 'aid', 'own', 'self-destruction', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'become', 'as', 'vile', 'men', 'who', 'violated', 'are', 'winners', 'losers', 'story', 'movie', 'shock', 'director', 'writer', 'attempted', 'expound', 'social', 'cultural', 'view', 'rape', 'aftereffects', 'act', 'question', 'did', 'not', 'factor', 'deliberate', 'psychological', 'traumatic', 'terror', 'were', 'irresponsible', 'handling', 'whole', 'film', 'entirely', 'Yes', 'Horror', 'movies', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'thoughtless', 'visual', 'taping', 'most', 'visceral', 'part', 'humans', 'fear', 'gain', 'more', 'took', 'more', 'seriously', 'was', 'intended', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'successful']",N/A

Some of those who find  themselves liking it seem to like it because &quot;well, it wasn't as bad  as some critics said.&quot;  What a compliment.This movie will satisfy  NO movie fans.

But let's get real here.  Does the movie back up  these important real-life topics with any semblance of substance and  intelligence?  It sure as hell does not.  The story is of moronic  simplicity; long, meaningless scenes fill the gaps between the rapes and  the revenges.  The director simply counts on the mere images of a woman  being raped and her rapists being maimed and killed to fulfill his highly  questionnable purpose.  Such shallowness inpires the viewer to think: why  should I CARE?

It is hard to sit down and watch this film without wondering if there is something wrong with you. The rape scenes are long, brutal, and unrelenting. What makes this film so tough to watch is the fact that the actress is raped not once, twice, three, or four, but five times! Worse, the rape scenes make up the bulk of the movie, so basically you're watching a woman being raped at length for what seems like most of the film's running time. Infamously, Roger Ebert was moved to call this film ""vile garbage""!Still, the film is brilliant in that it clearly uses shock to show how terrible rape is and how a woman suffers during the ordeal. But that's only part of the story. This is a rape-revenge movie. So after the rape, comes the revenge. Most of the women who have championed this movie have praised the revenge section of the film. Most men seem to hate the actress for taking her revenge to the umpteenth degree. ""Violence definitely breeds more violence"" as the saying goes. And this film is very, very violent.

It was one of those notorious films that kids whispered about--one filled with plenty of nudity and brutality.  Along with ""Last House on the Left"" and ""Faces of Death,"" ""I Spit On Your Grave"" exemplified exploitation cinema.  I didn't particularly like the movie--even then I appreciated the finer arts.  But based on its reputation and its controversial history, I knew I wanted to include this title in my extensive DVD library.  Heck, it must be better than I remembered to have a Deluxe Millennium edition!Well, in truth, it is better than I remembered.  The amateurish quality lends it a gritty realism that actually works in the film's favor.  Over the last couple of decades, we've become a little less sensitized to violence--some of our biggest hits are basically torture movies (think ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"").  So while the rape scenes are still quite disturbing, they are somehow less shocking.  More astounding, Camille Keaton's performance is actually quite accomplished.  Her reactions and subsequent revenge play out quite well.Some claim this film as a feminist treatise, and some as vile female degradation.  It's actually a bit of both--but I don't think the film merits a serious philosophical discussion.  Either way, it was meant to assault your senses--and that it does.Mind you, I'm not claiming ""I Spit On Your Grave"" is a great movie.  But it is essential viewing for those interested in this genre.  And for my money, it has held up better than ""Last House On The Left""--although I do prefer the plot of ""Last House"".A film entitled ""I Spit On Your Grave"" isn't for everyone.

I went into this movie with extremely low expectations, but I'm glad to say that this movie exceeded those low expectations. First of all, being a rape survivor myself, I was very apprehensive about watching this movie after the things I heard regarding the rape scene which I did find pretty harsh. The truth of the matter is, this type of thing happens more frequently than people think. These 4 men took a gorgeous woman, who was minding her own business trying to write a novel in the peacefulness of the wilderness, and they damaged her for no reason. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but root for Jennifer after she began seeking her revenge knowing full well all these men deserved what they got. Secondly, let me just say that these men had to be the dumbest men on the planet because they walked right into these attacks with their eyes wide open. How could they honestly believe that a woman they raped and brutalized came back to seduce them for more? OH! The ending is my favorite. I had to give the girl a big round of applause for that, and if you wanna know what I mean see the movie. Third, people keep complaining, but this movie was made back in the 70's without a huge budget. Back when people actually had to act out a movie because there weren't any computers or special effects to distract you from the dumb storyline or talentless actors. Back when people didn't get paid 30 gazillion dollars just to show their faces on the screen, or 35 gazillion dollars just to die in the first scene. Frankly, I think this movie is a cult classic. My only pete peeve is that everytime they make a movie about big city people coming to the South for relaxation they get victimized by dumb rednecks or mountain men ala ""Deliverance"" style. Fourth, don't believe the hype, this movie is not horror by any means, so please don't watch this expecting to see Ms. Voorhies because you'll be seriously disappointed. Fifth, you have people comparing this to ""The Brave One"". Frankly, I don't see how the 2 compare. Jodie Foster gets attacked with her boyfriend who dies as a result, and then she turns vigilante/murderer ordaining herself in charge of stopping all the injustice in the city. I'm sorry, but what does that have to do with this movie? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! I'm saying this not to be rude, but don't be misled by that comparison either because in my opinion it's not accurate. Lastly, before I make my exit, it is my recommendation that you must see this movie, and if not for the rape scene, watch it to see justice served, or should I say, revenge served cold as ice.",4,Fantastic!!!!,1191456000,"10 4, 2007",2007,2721,"['Forget', 'what', 'heard..this', 'movie', 'freaking', 'AWESOME', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'managed', 'play', 'role', 'back', 'then', 'women', 'get', 'Oscars', 'now', 'went', 'movie', 'extremely', 'low', 'expectations', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'low', 'expectations', 'First', 'all', 'being', 'rape', 'survivor', 'was', 'very', 'apprehensive', 'watching', 'movie', 'things', 'heard', 'regarding', 'rape', 'scene', 'did', 'find', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'truth', 'matter', 'type', 'thing', 'more', 'frequently', 'people', 'think', '4', 'men', 'took', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'trying', 'write', 'novel', 'peacefulness', 'wilderness', 'damaged', 'reason', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'Jennifer', 'began', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'men', 'deserved', 'what', 'got', 'Secondly', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'men', 'had', 'be', 'dumbest', 'men', 'planet', 'walked', 'right', 'attacks', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'How', 'could', 'honestly', 'believe', 'woman', 'raped', 'brutalized', 'came', 'back', 'seduce', 'more', 'OH', 'ending', 'favorite', 'had', 'give', 'girl', 'big', 'round', 'applause', 'wan', 'na', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'see', 'movie', 'Third', 'people', 'keep', 'complaining', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'back', '70', 'huge', 'budget', 'Back', 'when', 'people', 'actually', 'had', 'act', 'out', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'computers', 'special', 'effects', 'distract', 'dumb', 'storyline', 'talentless', 'actors', 'Back', 'when', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'paid', '30', 'gazillion', 'dollars', 'just', 'show', 'screen', '35', 'gazillion', 'dollars', 'just', 'die', 'first', 'scene', 'Frankly', 'think', 'movie', 'cult', 'classic', 'only', 'pete', 'peeve', 'everytime', 'make', 'movie', 'big', 'city', 'people', 'coming', 'South', 'relaxation', 'get', 'victimized', 'dumb', 'rednecks', 'mountain', 'men', 'Deliverance', 'style', 'Fourth', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'hype', 'movie', 'not', 'horror', 'means', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'expecting', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Voorhies', ""'ll"", 'be', 'seriously', 'disappointed', 'Fifth', 'have', 'people', 'comparing', 'Brave', 'One', 'Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', '2', 'compare', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'attacked', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'result', 'then', 'vigilante/murderer', 'ordaining', 'charge', 'stopping', 'injustice', 'city', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'movie', 'ABSOLUTELY', 'NOTHING', ""'m"", 'saying', 'not', 'be', 'rude', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'comparison', 'either', 'opinion', 'not', 'accurate', 'Lastly', 'make', 'exit', 'recommendation', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'rape', 'scene', 'watch', 'see', 'justice', 'served', 'should', 'say', 'revenge', 'served', 'cold', 'ice']",N/A

For me, the film is just about perfect.  By the way, anybody who says they're surprised and sickened by what happens on screen should have known what the film was about when going to see it.  The reason is because the advertising for the movie was very direct:  ""This woman will soon beat, chop, burn, strangle 5 men beyond recognition, and no jury in American would dare convict her.""

One was &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and the other was &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; which is actually the more memorable film of the pair overall (although I do grant the highest place to the &quot;hook&quot; scene in TCM). Director Meir Zarchi's 1978 film has become rather infamous, since critics hated it, audiences were outraged, and the film was banned in Germany and Great Britain. The story, such as it is, finds Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton, Buster's grand-niece) out in the woods of Connecticut to work on a novel when she crosses the path of some local boys who decide she should be the first sexual partner for their mentally-disabled friend. When he cannot complete the rape, his friends do it for him. Then they decide that they are not done with Jennifer.At issue are not Jennifer's specific acts of revenge, including the infamous bathroom scene, but rather the series of brutal rapes that precede them. I do not want to meet anyone who is not disturbed by these rape scenes and I think it is fairly obvious that Zarchi intended to make audiences uncomfortable. In retrospect you have to wonder about all those movies with rape scenes that do NOT upset the audience. But Zarchi certainly pours it on thick, absolutely assuring that things go beyond the tolerance level of anyone who watches this film. So the bottom line is that this film will upset you and it is therefore effective at doing exactly what it wants to do, which is supposed to be a good thing, right? I have always considered this an &quot;X&quot; rated movie although I would not consider it pornographic in the traditional sense. But it is a very disturbing film and I do not think I would want my kids to see it until after they graduate college (if ever). Anyone renting this film for cheap thrills is in for a shock.As I now understand it, this 1978 film was originally released as &quot;Day of the Woman,&quot; but that rather innocuous title was replaced by the well known &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; although the film was also screened as &quot;I Hate Your Guts&quot; and &quot;The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill.&quot; All of this is interesting since it seems the producers were trying to pass off this film with both higher and lover levels of pretention.

It is also known under a host of different titles including its original title, Day of the Woman.  Many Critics despise this film, where the director sees it as a feminist power film, many other see it as simply a rape and revenge film. It spent years banned in many countries. I personally really enjoy this movie But I'll be the first to say it is not for everyone. Its portrayal of gang rape is flat out disturbing.One of the movies weak spots which many mainstream critics pointed out is the movie doesn't have much development for each character. Their personalities are rather simple and it heavily relies on the rape scene to build sympathy for Jennie. All of this is at least partially true as there is very little dialogue and not much time in between the rape scene and the kill scenes but for something like this there really doesn't have to be.The movie's point is meant to be that rape is a violent and terrible crime and the people that commit deserve to be punished. One isn't meant to sit there watch this movie and say, ""Oh those poor people how dare she kill them!"" That would be counter productive to the point. If one wanted to be simple about it they could attribute this entire film to be an anti-rape PSA, however it is one that holds some merit.

Writer-director Meir Zarchi, obviously under the influence of Wes Craven's gritty &quot;Last House on the Left,&quot; constructed a very simple plot where a beautiful woman is isolated only to be beaten and raped by a gang of local hoods.  After they leave her for dead, she recuperates and takes sadistic revenge against her attackers.The rape scenes are too choreographed to be considered realistic, and this is complemented by camera angles that render the incidents voyeuristic.  The heroine has no discernible personality aside from her looks, and is a model of perfection that is violated unfairly.  The way the rapists are seduced and buy the fact that this woman could be attracted to them after the fact is just preposterous.  And the movie ends on a note of absolute nihilism.But I think Zarchi wanted to make an example of men, and how they allow their privates to do their thinking for them.  So the way the rapists' libidoes lead them to their doom is a bit symbolic. The act of revenge that takes place in the third act is mean-spirited, unpleasant, but honest.  After all, revenge is a hollow act that isn't intended to bring about a feeling of pleasure.&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is a decent film.

First you had Ebert & Siskel on their weekly show discuss how terrible and disgusting the movie was. Then, once released in England on video, the film became notorious for being one of the original ""video nasties"" there (if you haven't heard of them google them. They make for an interesting mix of films). So was there a reason for controversy? Was the movie truly that disturbing? Having just watched the blu-ray release of the film I can only say yes, a feeling I had when watching it for the first time years ago.I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (originally released as DAY OF THE WOMAN) was one of those films that you heard so much about that you had to find it and watch it. Controversial movies have always had that effect on the viewing public. It doesn't matter if the movie is good or bad, you find yourself drawn to it because of the word of mouth surrounding it. What surprised me this time around was that after over 30 years since its first release (1978-80 depending on where you look), the film still has that punch in the gut effect that it had the first time around.The story revolves around a young woman, Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton) who leaves New York City for a month in the country to relax and write her first novel. She stops to get gas at the local station and meets the station owner, Johnny, and his group of friends. It's a casual meeting with no names exchanged and little happens. Later on she meets Matthew, a dim witted young man who delivers groceries, not knowing that he's friends with Johnny and his group.When Johnny and his friends get together, they begin talking about how attractive Jennifer was. After talking long enough, they decided that they want her and will indeed take her. The next day while she's in her boat on the lake, they grab the rope on hers and speed off with her in tow. Once they land, the group savagely takes turns raping her with the exception of Matthew.Jennifer leaves them behind, bruised, scraped and bleeding. As she makes her way through the woods, they find her again and brutalize her once more. They leave her behind here and she makes her way home only to find the group waiting for her. Matthew now among them, they convince him to follow their lead and he rapes her as well. Rarely has the violent act of rape been so convincingly played. This is brutal and animalistic. There is no chance that someone would find this erotic, unless they find something nice in rape. And it's these scenes that are the most brutal and disturbing of all.Matthew is sent in to kill Jennifer but can't bring himself to do so. Surviving the ordeal, Jennifer is now a changed woman. No long content to sit back and be taken advantage of, she plots her revenge on each of the group. Matthew is the first, seduced by the lake and then left hanging from a tree.While it's weird to say this, Johnny gets the most deserving act of revenge and one that will stick with you long after watching the film. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Jennifer seduces Johnny back to her place and while sharing a bath with him, reaches out, takes a butcher knife and cuts off his...well think of John Bobbit and you'll know what she does. With little or no special effects save for a well placed sound effect, this scene will make you cringe just like the rape sequence. Jennifer does indeed finish her revenge and the movie ends.As with films like HOSTEL I tend to find no pleasure in watching what is commonly known these days as torture porn. Anyone easily disturbed will find this movie incredibly hard to watch. Yes, the victim in the movie does have her revenge, but the fact that we're watching this forcible rape time and time again doesn't offer entertainment at all but leaves one feeling the need for a shower.Is it worth watching at least once? Perhaps. If you can stomach the scenes described above then sure, especially if you want to see it as a piece of film history. Amazingly the film, while made on a low budget, does offer some decent photography and is well acted for being made with unknowns. The transfer makes this movie the best looking version that's ever been released.As I said, I'm not a fan of the genre. But as I watched I found that while disturbing it offered a better story than I first remembered. For a low budget film it was quite well made, written and directed. But it still leaves you with that unwashed feeling.I know many people think that movies have to push the envelope now and then, to go further than they did before. That may be true at times. Then again sometimes pushing the envelope doesn't add anything to our way of life. And to call it art to me just denigrates art. You can probably tell I'm betwixt and between on this movie. Its one that you have to witness and make your own mind up about.",2,TRULY DISTURBING,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,4865,"['When', 'SPIT', 'YOUR', 'GRAVE', 'was', 'initially', 'released', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'films', 'time', 'First', 'had', 'Ebert', 'Siskel', 'weekly', 'show', 'how', 'terrible', 'disgusting', 'movie', 'was', 'Then', 'once', 'released', 'England', 'video', 'film', 'became', 'notorious', 'being', 'one', 'original', 'video', 'nasties', 'there', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'google', 'make', 'interesting', 'mix', 'films', 'was', 'reason', 'controversy', 'Was', 'movie', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'Having', 'just', 'watched', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'yes', 'feeling', 'had', 'when', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'ago.I', 'SPIT', 'ON', 'YOUR', 'GRAVE', 'originally', 'released', 'DAY', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'find', 'watch', 'Controversial', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'effect', 'viewing', 'public', ""n't"", 'matter', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'find', 'drawn', 'word', 'mouth', 'surrounding', 'What', 'surprised', 'time', 'around', 'was', '30', 'years', 'first', 'release', '1978-80', 'depending', 'where', 'look', 'film', 'still', 'punch', 'gut', 'effect', 'had', 'first', 'time', 'around.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'young', 'woman', 'Jennifer', 'Hill', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'month', 'country', 'relax', 'write', 'first', 'novel', 'get', 'gas', 'local', 'station', 'station', 'owner', 'Johnny', 'group', 'friends', 'casual', 'meeting', 'names', 'exchanged', 'little', 'happens', 'Later', 'Matthew', 'dim', 'witted', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'groceries', 'not', 'knowing', 'friends', 'Johnny', 'group.When', 'Johnny', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'begin', 'talking', 'how', 'attractive', 'Jennifer', 'was', 'talking', 'long', 'enough', 'decided', 'want', 'will', 'indeed', 'take', 'next', 'day', 'boat', 'lake', 'grab', 'rope', 'hers', 'speed', 'off', 'tow', 'land', 'group', 'savagely', 'turns', 'raping', 'exception', 'Matthew.Jennifer', 'bruised', 'scraped', 'bleeding', 'way', 'woods', 'find', 'again', 'brutalize', 'once', 'more', 'leave', 'behind', 'here', 'way', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'group', 'waiting', 'Matthew', 'now', 'convince', 'follow', 'lead', 'as', 'well', 'Rarely', 'violent', 'act', 'rape', 'been', 'so', 'convincingly', 'played', 'brutal', 'animalistic', 'chance', 'someone', 'would', 'find', 'erotic', 'find', 'something', 'nice', 'rape', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'brutal', 'disturbing', 'all.Matthew', 'sent', 'kill', 'Jennifer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'so', 'Surviving', 'ordeal', 'Jennifer', 'now', 'changed', 'woman', 'No', 'long', 'content', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'taken', 'advantage', 'plots', 'revenge', 'group', 'Matthew', 'first', 'seduced', 'lake', 'then', 'left', 'hanging', 'tree.While', 'weird', 'say', 'Johnny', 'most', 'deserving', 'act', 'revenge', 'one', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'watching', 'film', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***', 'Jennifer', 'Johnny', 'back', 'place', 'sharing', 'bath', 'out', 'butcher', 'knife', 'cuts', 'off', 'well', 'think', 'John', 'Bobbit', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'little', 'special', 'effects', 'save', 'well', 'placed', 'sound', 'effect', 'scene', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', 'just', 'rape', 'sequence', 'Jennifer', 'indeed', 'finish', 'revenge', 'movie', 'ends.As', 'films', 'HOSTEL', 'tend', 'find', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'what', 'commonly', 'known', 'days', 'torture', 'porn', 'Anyone', 'easily', 'disturbed', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'watch', 'Yes', 'victim', 'movie', 'have', 'revenge', 'fact', ""'re"", 'watching', 'forcible', 'rape', 'time', 'time', 'again', ""n't"", 'offer', 'entertainment', 'one', 'feeling', 'need', 'shower.Is', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'stomach', 'scenes', 'described', 'then', 'sure', 'especially', 'want', 'see', 'piece', 'film', 'history', 'Amazingly', 'film', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'offer', 'decent', 'photography', 'well', 'acted', 'being', 'made', 'unknowns', 'transfer', 'movie', 'best', 'looking', 'version', 'ever', 'been', 'released.As', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'genre', 'watched', 'found', 'disturbing', 'offered', 'better', 'story', 'first', 'remembered', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'made', 'written', 'directed', 'still', 'unwashed', 'feeling.I', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'movies', 'have', 'push', 'envelope', 'now', 'then', 'go', 'further', 'did', 'before', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'times', 'Then', 'again', 'sometimes', 'pushing', 'envelope', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'way', 'life', 'call', 'art', 'just', 'art', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', ""'m"", 'betwixt', 'movie', 'one', 'have', 'witness', 'make', 'own', 'mind', 'about']",N/A

ONE REVIEWER SAID THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE GAS CHAMBER FOR KILLING THOSE MEN. WELL I WILL SAY THIS IN HER DEFENSE. IN SOME WAYS SHE DID THE RIGHT THING.

YOU DON'T MESS WITH WOMEN LIKE THAT. IF YOU HURT THEM, IN SOME CASES THEY WILL KILL YOU. IT IS THAT SIMPLE.

If you're interested in seeing it it's because you want to see something controversial that pushes boundaries. Something you won't see in most other films. This movie should satisfy those desires. We all know what it's about so I won't go into that. There are three seperate rape scenes all taking place within about an hour. These scenes are fairly graphic and pretty real. I think her trauma is more mental as the men don't really beat on her until the final rape. In carrying out her revenge she actually allows one of the men to have sex with her before she kills him. That seemed strange to me but it was a good scene. The best scene to me is the scene in the bathtub. Again she gains one of the men's trust and gets in the bathtub with him. Then after making him feel very good she does something very bad! They way the actors played this scene out seemed very real to me. I think the mans reaction is pretty spot on.In some other reviews I've read this movie described as disturbing and being compared to ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Last House on the Left"". I didn't think this movie was at all distubing. Maybe it might be for women. It's nothing like ""TCM""! That movie is disturbing!

But instead of peace and serenity, she ends up as the victim of brutal rape and torture at the hands of a band of semi-literate rednecks.  She somehow survives the ordeal, though, and after regaining her physical and emotional bearing, she finds the inner strength to return to the scene of the crime and confront her attackers....  Thusly winds the plot of 1978's infamous and controversial revenge flick I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (originally titled DAY OF THE WOMAN).In the uncut version of this soupon-budget flick--which is the version offered on the DVD from Elite--the gang-rape and torture sequence consumes an inordinate amount of screen time.  Though this sequence has sometimes been compared to the sodomy scene in Boorman's DELIVERANCE (1972), it is more often criticized as being merely gratuitous and subliminally misogynistic.  Unlike Boorman, who only slyly and skillfully SUGGESTS the sodomy and torture in his famous film, the director of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, Meir Zarchi, is unflinchingly graphic in his depiction of rape.  He doesn't want to do anything that might candy-coat this bitter pill, because he wants the audience to see just how abhorring such personal violation actually is.Lauded by loyal fans as a simple film that makes an important and abstruse point, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is admittedly neither complex nor deep.  Yes, the plotting is rudimentary and subtext is virtually nonexistent.  Yes, the film lacks a musical score.  And, yeah, a few of the characters are trite, shallow, and one-dimensional, and some of the dialogue is hokey.  To certain aesthete filmgoers, this raw simplicity may come across as banal, sophomoric cinema.  But aesthetics is only a secondary concern with this film.  The primary purpose is to declare a particular message or two and to declare them as in-your-face as possible.  The film DOES indeed have a couple of staunch points to make regarding the repugnance of rape and misogyny, an individual's rights regarding their body, and the justification for exacting eye-for-an-eye revenge.  And it proclaims these points in a graphically straightforward manner that, if nothing else, certainly grabs the audience's attention.The Elite DVD version of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE offers a surprisingly clear, clean anamorphic transfer of the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  The sound, while not as impressive as the digital video, is available in Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS Surround Sound 5.1, or the original mono.  The disc's extras include a feature commentary by the director, as well as a hilarious commentary track by cult-film aficionado and critic Joe Bob Briggs, the stage persona of actor/writer John Bloom.  (Joe Bob's articulate, knowledgeable, and extremely humorous commentary is itself worth the disc's purchase price.)  Also included are the theatrical trailers--some of which promote the film under its original title--various interviews, and press-coverage items that include the merciless repudiation of the film by some famous critics.  For a film that has generated such negative publicity over the years, this is quite meritorious bonus material.True, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is an exploitative splatter film with a plot that is often dismissed by critics as a tale of one city girl and handful of sadistic hayseeds traipsing through a series of grisly scenes.  It's definitely not for the squeamish, but anybody who views the film is certain to walk away with a firm pathos for rape victims and a strong disdain for rapists.

While Deliverance had a higher budget and better acting, the plot is roughly the same - out of towner is raped by some yocals, who then pay for their crime with their lives through an act of revenge.In this movie, viewers are more shocked that a woman is raped instead of a man.  Anyone who has seen Deliverance will forever remember the words, ""Squeal like a pig.""  Viewers of I Spit On Your Grave are not treated to the same physiological thrills; only, raw and brutal images.I found the low-budget flick very refreshing from the usual Hollywood glitz and horror film cookie-cutter format.  The plot was no worse off than, say, Friday the 13th for example.  And, it was so unusual to see an abundance of gratuitous sex and violence in an American film.Worthy of note - this film has been banned in several countries, including the UK, while Deliverance received no more than an R (18) Rating.  I take this to mean that it's more socially acceptable to rape a man than a woman.Aside from all the controversy, sex, and violence, I put it on par with Pink Flamingos.

495403,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000009O8A,OverTheMoon,"[7, 18]","I love horror movies and I am fan of most of them and will watch almost anything because I like the genre. For the first time I have witnessed something that I felt went beyond the accepted boundaries of art and certainly moved into the realm of films that feature unforgiving scenes like animal abuse (Cannibal Holocaust comes to mind). I would love to give this five stars but I will not because in my opinion this film has no place in cinema or on the video shelf. If anything this film should only be released as part of an art-house circuit or as film lecture material. I certainly believe that this film should not be available to all adults and should be accompanied by some sort of a follow-up lecture in which a professional explains to the viewer the problems that this type of film has on society. Sure it is daring and bold and tries to show us what is beyond our acceptable standard but it also presents an unpardonable and excessive amount of sexual violence towards human beings, especially women. I hope a film like this is never made again.The film has pretty low production values and is a bit of a mix bag in terms of the quality of the acting on display. The sound is not very good and the execution of most of the dialogue is pretty poor. Where this film outrivals most for its type is in the brutality and its horrific chauvinism that reaches its peak in a very graphic thirty minute gang rape sequence that gives this film its notoriety. That actual sequence is made all the more brutal because one of the gang members has a mental age of about ten.The premise is simple. Our protagonist is a young writer, played by Camille Keaton (Buster Keaton's grand-niece and the wife of this film's director) who journeys out to ""redneck"" county to write a book. There she is accosted by four hillbillies who proceed to do the deplorable with her in a very disturbing way that is often as violent as it sexually distressing. The problem with this sequence is that it lasts so long and in so many different locations as they drag their victim about the place. One could only imagine what purpose all of this serves and if the film is not just catering for a very unbalanced and criminal type of viewer. At the same time we can say that this is ""just a movie"" or ""art"" but it does go beyond that - especially when bottles are involved.The question that is poised at the back of the mind when watching this (and it is not a very pleasant experience), is if this is just exploitation material or does it have some moral or underlying philosophy to explain its actions or why it should have been made in the first place? Maybe this is exploitation cinema just testing the limits of what it can do? Well the film makers have done just that, however the director has said that he made this movie to show the ugliness of its theme. Who does the director think he is fooling? This film is exploitation through and through with one true purpose - to abuse the protagonist, disturb the viewer and to provide the splatter for the gore hounds - nothing more, nothing less. This is not ""The Accused"" or ""Irreversible"". It is not even ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Last House on the Left"". This is akin to ""Cannabis Holocaust"" or ""Cannabis Ferox"". Not only is this movie prejudiced, sexist and down right cruel it also seems like potentially dangerous material for the more unhinged elements in our society.The second half of the film concentrates on the victim's revenge for the crimes committed again her and this is really where the entertainment can be found in a short of female version of a Charles Bronson/Clint Eastwood vigilante retribution movie. To be honest the film would have been much better, and acceptable, if it cut down on the intensity of the sexual violence at the start of movie. Certainly there are a number of interesting segments, one involving a shopping delivery that plays itself out in a very strange way. One of the deviants also tries to justify his actions by blaming the victim instead. Another scene involves a very shocking dismemberment in the bathroom (very realistic). All in all the second half is quite interesting but the first half is revolting and disgusting and like I said, probably dangerous material in the wrong hands.In short this movie has no place in cinema or in the video shelf.

But i think i got my answer when i read one of the five-star reviews: &quot;There were sum really kewl scenes in it, like when the lady was naked and screaming&quot;.Yeah, that guy probably watched the movie instead of studying for his grade eight finals. I'm a HUGE fan of horror movies and have seen tons of them. But this one is totally pointless and tedious. If you took out the rape scene you would end up taking out about 40 minutes of the movie.  The rape scene is extended way too long in this movie and it's unnecessary to have it dragged out this much. We get the point!! She gets raped and now she wants revenge. The other scenes after the rape and leading up to her revenge are boring and stupid. I hate how people are analyzing this movie as if they were writing some kind of thesis for film school or psychology class. And the fact that this is in widescreen and given more dvd features than most Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures dvds is a sin of the biggest kind. I mean do we really care if this crap is in widescreen or not?? There is nothing enjoyable about this film and no redeeming value to this whatsoever. This is exploitational garbage of the worst kind. It's not even a B film. It's a grade Z film. Anyone who feels the burning need to own this dvd and to watch an extended rape scene needs serious life reflection time. There are about 200 other horror movies out there that are more important than wasting your time on this stupid turd.Figures that a foreign director who's not even from North American would come up with an idea for a film like this. Every American actor associated with this movie should be ashamed. I hope their careers all went down the toilet after doing this.

495408,A2KX0R3HI0KQFN,B000009O8A,Professor,"[6, 7]","After all the years of hype and vitriolic reviews from people like Ebert, I finally decided to watch the thing, so I bought this Millennium edition DVD. I did it differently than most: I watched the Joe Bob Briggs commentary first. (It's confusing to find; it's on the menu under ""audio setup"").Briggs's commentary is humorous, insightful, and at times, brilliant. I really had the feeling that I was watching the film along with him, which was very comforting during the more disturbing scenes, and entertaining during some of the more boring ones. I don't generally go for these types of films, but I think Briggs is an excellent commentator and critic.Most significantly, Briggs doesn't defend the film as some kind of high art. He objectively points out its shortcomings, but also its virtues--many of which would not have been apparent to me if I had simply watched the film without the commentary.The other commentary, by director Meir Zarchi, includes his real-life story of helping a female who had been raped and beaten and how the experience inspired him to make the film. It sounds very altruistic, and I have no doubt that the man is sincere.The question is: Is this a credible piece of filmmaking?I would say that it's a flawed film in some ways and a fearless and groundbreaking film in other ways.If you are focusing more on the formalistic aspects of filmmaking, you will find some surprisingly good scenes and camera work, but other scenes linger too long and could have used some editing.Acting-wise, Camille Keaton knocks herself out in this film. Briggs observes that the entire film is ""external""; there is virtually no insight into the minds of the characters--it's almost like watching a documentary, it's so dispassionate and objective. That makes her job all the more difficult.As to the content: Briggs comments intelligently on the feminist aspect. The film is shot, as he clearly demonstrates, from the female's point of view, and it in no way glorifies rape or makes any attempt to portray it as something erotic. Indeed, it made me flinch and turn away several times.From a feminist standpoint, there is a lot of meaningful symbolism here. The revenge scenes are every bit as appalling as the rape scenes, but I have to admit that I was glad to see the bad guys get their comeuppance.In other words, I became emotionally involved in the story. Hmmmm.....isn't that the mark of a credible film?It may not be great cinema, but I don't the film deserves the near-unanimous dismissal as a piece of exploitative trash that it has been given by the critics. I think Zarchi was making a point about male domination of females, and he wanted to make it as graphic as possible.Man have argued that this film is just gratuitous sensatonalism. Well, maybe it is, in many aspects; directors want their films to make money, and they will go to any length to get attention. Yet somehow, this film  makes a socio-sexual point that's worth considering.This is the most disturbing film I have ever seen. I don't think being disturbed is a legitimate reason to watch a film. I'm not recommending it; I'm just saying that it does what it intends.",5,"Five stars for the Millennium edition, not the film",1165536000,"12 8, 2006",2006,3157,"['years', 'hype', 'vitriolic', 'reviews', 'people', 'Ebert', 'finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'thing', 'bought', 'Millennium', 'edition', 'DVD', 'did', 'differently', 'most', 'watched', 'Joe', 'Bob', 'Briggs', 'commentary', 'first', 'confusing', 'find', 'menu', 'audio', 'setup', '.Briggs', 'commentary', 'humorous', 'insightful', 'times', 'brilliant', 'really', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'comforting', 'more', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'entertaining', 'more', 'boring', 'ones', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'go', 'types', 'films', 'think', 'Briggs', 'excellent', 'commentator', 'critic.Most', 'significantly', 'Briggs', ""n't"", 'defend', 'film', 'kind', 'high', 'art', 'objectively', 'out', 'shortcomings', 'also', 'virtues', 'many', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'apparent', 'had', 'simply', 'watched', 'film', 'commentary.The', 'other', 'commentary', 'director', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', 'real-life', 'story', 'helping', 'female', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'raped', 'beaten', 'how', 'experience', 'inspired', 'make', 'film', 'very', 'altruistic', 'have', 'doubt', 'man', 'sincere.The', 'question', 'credible', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'would', 'say', 'flawed', 'film', 'ways', 'fearless', 'groundbreaking', 'film', 'other', 'ways.If', 'are', 'focusing', 'more', 'formalistic', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'find', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'scenes', 'camera', 'work', 'other', 'scenes', 'linger', 'too', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'editing.Acting-wise', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'out', 'film', 'Briggs', 'entire', 'film', 'external', 'virtually', 'insight', 'minds', 'characters', 'almost', 'watching', 'documentary', 'so', 'dispassionate', 'objective', 'job', 'more', 'difficult.As', 'content', 'Briggs', 'comments', 'intelligently', 'feminist', 'aspect', 'film', 'shot', 'clearly', 'female', 'point', 'view', 'way', 'rape', 'attempt', 'portray', 'something', 'erotic', 'Indeed', 'made', 'flinch', 'turn', 'away', 'several', 'feminist', 'standpoint', 'lot', 'meaningful', 'symbolism', 'here', 'revenge', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'appalling', 'rape', 'scenes', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'comeuppance.In', 'other', 'words', 'became', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'story', 'Hmmmm', '..is', ""n't"", 'mark', 'credible', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'cinema', 'do', ""n't"", 'film', 'near-unanimous', 'dismissal', 'piece', 'exploitative', 'trash', 'been', 'given', 'critics', 'think', 'Zarchi', 'was', 'making', 'point', 'male', 'domination', 'females', 'wanted', 'make', 'as', 'graphic', 'possible.Man', 'have', 'argued', 'film', 'just', 'gratuitous', 'sensatonalism', 'Well', 'maybe', 'many', 'aspects', 'directors', 'want', 'films', 'make', 'money', 'will', 'go', 'length', 'get', 'attention', 'somehow', 'film', 'socio-sexual', 'point', 'worth', 'considering.This', 'most', 'disturbing', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'being', 'disturbed', 'legitimate', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'recommending', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'what']",N/A

495410,AX5WSHD1U2ANF,B000009O8A,"Reader B ""avid reader""","[0, 0]","It is hard to give this any stars without misleading others.  It is what it is, and one either accepts the viewpoint of the violence, or is massively offended.Rather then go into the movie, I will direct my comments to the disc contents.  First, the movie looks pristine, so it had to have been remastered.  The trailer clips and some of the other supplemental materials show a gritty appearance of the movie.  The actual movie does not show any of that.Zarchi's feature, The Values of Vengeance is a recent recording, as he talks about the 2010 remake.  He gives background on making and distributing the movie.  The commentary he has with the movie touches on some of what he amplified on in the feature.  It is quite clear that he was very unhappy when the title of the movie got changed from Day of the Woman to its current title.  His commentary is actually quite useful for anyone who wants to know what it is like to make a movie on a budget.  And then try and get it distributed.The commentary by Joe Bob Briggs was, in my opinion, off putting.  A lot was to rebuttal the reviews by Siskel and Ebert when the movie came out.  And references to other movies in the genre of horror and brutality.  Perhaps this is simply that I am not used to that type of a commentary on a movie.  A lot of time was also put into showing that the movie was really from the point of the victim, Camille Keaton, then the attackers.  There apparently is a disconnect, as some of the comments that he wondered about were already answered by Meir Zarchi's comments on the movie.  So apparently they were done independently.So if one accepts that this movie fulfilled the message it was intended to do, it could get five stars.  But if violence and brutality is something offensive, then one would probably give it zero stars.However, the genesis of this movie was when Zarchi actually came across a rape victim shortly after it happened, and he has captured the trauma of the event.

495415,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000009O8A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 11]","I Spit on Your Grave (Meir Zarchi, 1978)Meir Zarchi took Craven's idea (with Last House on the Left) and paid homage with a film that, while not all that good, is a sight better than Last House. It's also become something of a cult classic for reasons that I'm not sure I understand (nor want to). Again, the plot is simple and savage: Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton, who actually HAS managed to find a few other roles, mostly in what seem to be Italian giallo flicks given the titles) has rented a secluded house on a lake to get out of the big evil city and runs afoul of three of the local miscreants and their toady, a twentysomething seemingly retarded virgin. The miscreants develop a plan to get the toady laid, and, as is to be expected, a bloodbath ensues, starting with an almost forty minute long scene punctuated by three different rapes. I mean, we're talking nasty here (but by the time Miz Hill gets around to stalking her attackers, I have to say, the viewer is definitely rooting for her).What about this particularly nasty movie makes it more effective than Last House on the Left? One definite reason is that Zarchi's scenes of brutalization are a whole lot more explicit than Craven's, and as such, the viewer has a deeper gut reaction to what's happening. When Hill starts wandering around like a zombie in the aftermath of the aforementioned forty-minute scene, it's realistic post-traumatic stress. Also, Zarchi gives more of a human dimension to the attackers; one has a wife and kids, one likes to play the harmonica, that sort of thing; details which cause a viewer to see the bad guys as something more (a little more, but still) than cardboard cutouts. Also, the film itself has a kind of endearing shoestring quality about it. Grainy stock, handheld-camera shots, that sort of thing. Zarchi probably had a budget of five hundred bucks and spent it half and half on fake blood and beer for the crew.It's not the best film you'll ever see, but if you follow IMDB's recommendation and double-feature it with Last House on the Left, it certainly won't be the worst film you ever see, either. **",2,Better than &quot;Last House&quot; (that isn't saying much),992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,2118,"['Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', '1978', 'Meir', 'Zarchi', 'took', 'Craven', 'idea', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'paid', 'homage', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'sight', 'better', 'Last', 'House', 'also', 'become', 'something', 'cult', 'classic', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'understand', 'want', 'Again', 'plot', 'simple', 'savage', 'Jennifer', 'Hill', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'who', 'actually', 'HAS', 'managed', 'find', 'few', 'other', 'roles', 'mostly', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'Italian', 'giallo', 'flicks', 'given', 'titles', 'rented', 'secluded', 'house', 'lake', 'get', 'big', 'evil', 'city', 'afoul', 'three', 'local', 'miscreants', 'toady', 'twentysomething', 'seemingly', 'retarded', 'virgin', 'miscreants', 'develop', 'plan', 'get', 'toady', 'laid', 'as', 'be', 'expected', 'bloodbath', 'ensues', 'starting', 'almost', 'forty', 'minute', 'long', 'scene', 'punctuated', 'three', 'different', 'rapes', 'mean', ""'re"", 'talking', 'nasty', 'here', 'time', 'Miz', 'Hill', 'around', 'stalking', 'attackers', 'have', 'say', 'viewer', 'definitely', 'rooting', '.What', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'movie', 'more', 'effective', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'One', 'definite', 'reason', 'Zarchi', 'scenes', 'brutalization', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'explicit', 'Craven', 'such', 'viewer', 'deeper', 'gut', 'reaction', 'what', 'happening', 'When', 'Hill', 'wandering', 'zombie', 'aftermath', 'aforementioned', 'forty-minute', 'scene', 'realistic', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'Also', 'Zarchi', 'more', 'human', 'dimension', 'attackers', 'one', 'wife', 'kids', 'one', 'likes', 'play', 'harmonica', 'sort', 'thing', 'details', 'cause', 'viewer', 'see', 'bad', 'guys', 'something', 'more', 'little', 'more', 'still', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'Also', 'film', 'kind', 'endearing', 'shoestring', 'quality', 'Grainy', 'stock', 'handheld-camera', 'shots', 'sort', 'thing', 'Zarchi', 'probably', 'had', 'budget', 'five', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'spent', 'half', 'half', 'fake', 'blood', 'beer', 'crew.It', 'not', 'best', 'film', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'follow', 'IMDB', 'recommendation', 'double-feature', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'see', '**']",N/A

495418,AAGFBE5EM7YKB,B000009O8A,Roule Duke,"[9, 13]","Surely you've heard the hype, but does this film live up to its reputation? Well that depends on whether you are expecting a sleazy trashy exploitation flick or a shocking cult classic.Is it a good movie? By conventional standards like budget, dramatic acting, star power ect, this film is a dismal failure, a cheap exploitation flick nothing more many will tell you. Most people would read the title and just assume it's bad. But really this film is brilliantly directed, does it matter how much it cost to make? Is it still an exploitation flick when the director married the actress who is being 'exploited'? Why is it that films like this which use more naturalistic acting as opposed to dramatic acting are automatically classed as being poorly acted? Weren't the cast convincingly real especially Camille Keaton with her brave and harrowing performance? So what if everyone involved never went on to bigger projects or never appeared in any other films, this film will live in infamy forever and the stunningly beautiful Camille Keaton is already an immortal icon in cult horror. If it was better known under the more noble title ""Day of the Woman"" and not ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (which is about as campy as titles ""Surf Nazis Must Die"" and ""Nude for Satan"") would it be treated more seriously.The real question isn't whether this is a good moive, but is this good cinema? Love it or hate it, how can you deny the power of a film that has such an effect on it's audience. The realism in the rape scenes, the lack of any musical score and voyeuristic yet artistic camera work deliver the kind of shear visceral power that big budget movies these days can only dream of possessing. So yes, this is undeniably spectacular cinema.Why do people hate it? Roger Ebert would have you believe it's sick and pure garbage. However read his initial review and you will find he largely justifies his views by reactions from nonthinking audience members which he found appalling and not what was happening on screen. Still there is no shortage of people who call this film sick. Even more sad is how some people out there want to censor or ban this film (book burning religious zealots no doubt) just check, theres like two yahoo groups dedicated to this childish cause (pathetic though as they only have about a dozen members between them). This film is not made to be an enjoyable viewing experience, it pulls no punches, just because you don't like it does that mean it must be sick? Rape is a horrible crime, would it be more acceptable to portray it any other way?What would posses someone to make such a film? Meir Zarchi wrote and directed the film after a real life encounter with a rape victim who he took to a police station (in retrospect he admits she should have gone to the hospital) and the cops were unsympathetic. This genuine horror he saw which existed in the real world which doesn't require werewolves or zombies, is the inspiration for the film. The revenge half of the film obviously an expression of the rage he felt at how the victim was treated, in the real world justice is rarely served. He uses in your face realism to get his message across. Just because his story is simple doesn't mean it's unintelligent. He dodges the one dimensional rapist stereotypes seen in other movies early on by humanising them with crude but still humorous personalities, one even has a family, the message: villains are real people too not comic book characters. One rapist while pleading pathetically tells Jennifer she asked for it by he way she walks and dresses, a damning criticism of some real life attitudes which state women are themselves to blame if they are attacked. The sequence of Jennifer after the attack is brilliant in displaying the traumatic detachment and loss of self suffered by real victims. It's the inclusion and excellent handling of the small details that elevate this movie beyond its low budget limits.Why would anybody like this film? I personally admire powerful films, films that are unique whether they are shocking or thought provoking. One reviewer complained that the violence wasn't disturbing in comparison to some other films, hey if you have seen Dead/Alive like you claim (although I own and prefer the uncut version called Braindead) then you must know that the most goriest movie ever is a comedy. The gore isn't the real focus of this film anyway. I own uncut copies of Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind the Sun, Cannibal Ferox, Anthropophagous, Flowers of Flesh and Blood and just about every notorious gore film out there. The only gore films more disturbing than ISOYG are Cannibal Holocaust and Men Behind the Sun, simply because like ISOYG these films are made by talented directors. Besides how could any amount of gore be disturbing when you want Jennifer to carry out her vendetta?So does it live up to the hype? This film is something you experience not just another movie. It's definitely a well deserved cult classic and one of the original cornerstones of the video nasties. While the more jaded viewer might not find it as disturbing as some, this is still a film you won't soon forget. The Millennium Edition DVD is outstanding, the film has never looked better and you get two excellent commentary tracks. It's a shame they didn't get any input from Camille Keaton when putting the extras together on this DVD, but you can't have it all I guess. I wish I lived in the USA so I could go to a horror convention and ask Camille Keaton for her autograph.Final thoughts? This is a challenging and outstanding cult masterpiece, it's a shame that this genuinely great piece of cinema is so universally misunderstood and under-rated.",5,Day of the Woman,1058400000,"07 17,

495422,ACTYP447JCDX0,B000009O8A,Scott Bresinger,"[5, 5]","""I Spit On Your Grave"" is one of the most notorious films to play so-called ""Grindhouse"" movie houses during the 70's, and most critics that bothered to see it dismissed it as reprehensible garbage.  Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert in particular hated it, and even the audience the film supposedly attracted.  Considering it boasts the dubious honor of containing the longest--and most graphic--rape scene in film history (not counting porn) seems to justify their reaction.  But wait!  ISOYG is also the tale of one woman's bloody revenge against her attackers, and its supporters even maintain that it's actually a pro-feminist movie.  Watching it, one can easily imagine that director Meir Zarchi honestly thought that was what he was doing.  I kinda think he was trying to have it both ways: to make a bottom feeding exploitation film that was also a feminist statement (The original title was ""Day of the Woman,"" but the more, um, declarative replacement doesn't seem designed to attract serious cineastes).The film's heroine, Jenny Hill (Camille Keaton) is a writer who leaves her ritzy New York digs to complete her novel in the peace and quiet of rural Connecticut.  There she is accosted by a gang of lowlifes who rape her and leave her for dead.  From then on Jenny becomes a heartless killing machine, concocting a plot to seduce the men and brutally kill them.  I don't think it would giving anything away to say that a gun, a noose and an outboard motor are involved, or that the most vivid scene involves one of the perps naked in a bathtub when a knife...well, you can probably guess what happens.Even though Keaton spends most of the movie completely naked, it's clearly told from her point of view, and even though the rape is graphic and protracted, it's anything but a turn-on.  It's as brutal, ugly and even realistic as what you can imagine an actual rape to be like, so the audience is rooting for these scumbags to get what's coming to them.  Then again, the movie can also be seen as a male assault on feminism: the heroine is a free-spirited writer (read: intellectual) from ""evil"" New York City who doesn't even wear a bra!  Certain kinds of men (like the ones who presumably go to grindhouse movies) are threatened by women like this, and ISOYG could be seen as their fantasy (or nightmare).  I myself like to think of it as pro-woman, but Zarchi, it would seem, was at least canny enough to provide enough ambiguity to maximize its chances for success.In any event, ISOYG is definitely not devoid of artistic merit or craft, as some of its critics contend.  It's deliberately paced, with documentary-style footage and no soundtrack music (it even has some stunning photography of the lake and forest it was shot at).  Watched from today's point of view, this could almost be a kind of gory Dogma 95 production!  Heck, it's as provocative as Lars Von Trier likes to think he is.  The disc features a small archive of articles (both pro and con) about the movie, and a commentary track from Zarchi himself.  A bonus commentary, by exploitation film critic Joe Bob Briggs, is both entertaining and surprisingly astute.  So if you're a fan of such ""modern"" fare as ""Saw,"" ""Hostel"" or most especially Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects,"" this is the movie you should check out.

This movie was a fantasy and I feel sorry for a person who thinks it represent reality.  To state that anyone should have the right to take the law into his or her own hands is a crime.

Morales,"[3, 3]","After watching ""Last House on the Left"",""Zombie"",and ""The Beyond,"" it's good to finally see a horror film that's taken seriously and done extrememly well. Wes Cravens LHOTL just seems to hold back a lot on the extreme, not to mention being in dire need of a good script, and the Fulci films seem to have good story ideas and a good effort, but in the end, it's executed a little poorly.I Spit on Your Grave is the cure.To keep it short, the story takes us to a summer house rented out by a quient, very kind and really attractive Jennifer (Camille Keaton). She is kidnapped by a few hillbillies, raped, beaten and left for dead. She then plots revenge and goes on to kill each attacker one by one. This film will upset a lot of people. The scenes where Keaton is raped and beaten are pretty intense, mostly because she acts through them with such brilliance, her screams sound so real you'll almost feel like she really was being raped. What also adds to your sympathy for her is her figure. I think it was a concious effort to try to get a very thin and weak looking women to play the part, b/c let's face it, as pretty as Keaton is, curves she has not. It's surprising her character didn't die during this ordeal. What I also liked in this film and as stated by other reviewers is how her wardrobe changes after she is almost killed. She stops wearing skimpy clothing and opts for a more conservative look. I also love the lack of a soundtrack, which may sound like it'll ruin the film but actually adds to its realism and makes it so much better.Even though the revenge plot is what makes the film and is the film it is not without its share of uncredibility. This is the reason I took off one star. For example, unless her main attacker is a real idiot, why would he trust this woman who he has just raped and almost killed to fall for him and want to get naked in the tub with him?? Also, in real life if a woman was in the same situation and was raped, do you think she'd still stay in that summer house for the remainder of the summer instead of going back home knowing full well her attackers are still somewhere nearby? I know in reality some people would be too ashamed to admit what happened to them which is understandable but what exactly kept Keaton's character in that house? Did she not want her money to go to waste or something? Com'on!Besides these flaws which will have you rolling your eyes at the screen, the film is incredible and although may not scare you with dark murky lighting or monsters and such, it's not that type of horror film. What's frightening about it is how easily the attackers were able to get their hands on this woman. It's scary because it shows you just how vulnerable you really are. I'd definitely recommend this film to any true horror fan, you won't regret it.

My dad who had just happened to walk into the room said, ""that's sick. And you have to be sick to watch it.""But few films stay with me in such a disturbing way as ""I Spit on Your Grave."" Several years later I would go on to work with rape survivors so in that light, I find the film even more disturbing.Is it entertainment, is it art? That debate will rage on forever, but I would recommend this film for the gore-hounds, the horror fans. I wouldn't recommend it to general movie fans. I personally have a hard time putting my finger on its redeeming artisitc qualities. Rape is not sex. It is the act of using sex as a weapon of violence and it is the sheer violence that leaves an impression and not the acting, direction, camera work or other artistic metrics.  Despite that though, it is not what I would call a ""gore"" movie. It relies on certain perceptions to create the ""horror"" in the viewer's mind, but nonetheless, little is left to the imagination. Although my mom is not a horror fan by any stretch of the imagination she watched it and really enjoyed it which surprised me as she's fairly conservative (socially, not politically). Outside of a handfull of films you'd have to go outside the U.S. to Japan to find worse or better, depending on your point of view.Personally I prefer a more supernatural film be it a gore fest or something more psychological like ""The Haunting."" Now, ""The Exorcist""! That's a total package. But nonetheless, I give it four stars for the dvd though which is packed with lots of cool extras and insights and it is very edgy film making for better or worse. Hollywood is content to recycle old themes and cliches that are quickly forgotten and warrant no discussion. I Spit on Your Grave still pushes the envelope and is worth viewing even if it is just your morbid curiousity wanting to know what the fuss is about.",4,"Disturbing, lacking in many things, but still worth a view",1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2252,"['rented', 'way', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'renting', 'videos', 'was', 'so', 'new', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'tax', 'charged', 'was', 'avid', 'horror', 'fan', 'frequently', 'rented', 'films', '2000', 'Maniacs', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Dis-member', 'Mama', 'remember', 'watching', 'one', 'particuarly', 'disturbing', 'film', 'name', 'guy', 'had', 'just', 'cut', 'out', 'dead', 'girlfriend', 'heart', 'took', 'big', 'ole', 'bite', 'My', 'dad', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'happened', 'walk', 'room', 'said', 'sick', 'have', 'be', 'sick', 'watch', 'few', 'films', 'stay', 'disturbing', 'way', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'Several', 'years', 'later', 'would', 'go', 'work', 'rape', 'survivors', 'so', 'light', 'find', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing.Is', 'entertainment', 'art', 'debate', 'will', 'rage', 'forever', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'gore-hounds', 'horror', 'fans', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'general', 'movie', 'fans', 'personally', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'putting', 'finger', 'redeeming', 'artisitc', 'qualities', 'Rape', 'not', 'sex', 'act', 'using', 'sex', 'weapon', 'violence', 'sheer', 'violence', 'impression', 'not', 'acting', 'direction', 'camera', 'work', 'other', 'artistic', 'metrics', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'gore', 'movie', 'certain', 'perceptions', 'create', 'horror', 'viewer', 'mind', 'nonetheless', 'little', 'left', 'imagination', 'mom', 'not', 'horror', 'fan', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'watched', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'surprised', 'fairly', 'conservative', 'socially', 'not', 'politically', 'handfull', 'films', ""'d"", 'have', 'go', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'find', 'worse', 'better', 'depending', 'point', 'view.Personally', 'prefer', 'more', 'supernatural', 'film', 'be', 'gore', 'fest', 'something', 'more', 'psychological', 'Haunting', 'Now', 'Exorcist', 'total', 'package', 'nonetheless', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'dvd', 'packed', 'lots', 'cool', 'extras', 'insights', 'very', 'edgy', 'film', 'making', 'better', 'worse', 'Hollywood', 'content', 'recycle', 'old', 'themes', 'cliches', 'are', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'warrant', 'discussion', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'still', 'envelope', 'worth', 'viewing', 'even', 'just', 'morbid', 'curiousity', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'fuss', 'about']",N/A

Of course the lowlifes who rape Jennifer should have been tracked down and dispatched. However, it's HOW she does it and WHAT she does that is unnecessarily cruel.

The peace of the countryside is shattered by a quartet of young men who, one after the other, rape her in a prolonged assault.

Indeed, this film has horror elements, with graphic violence and a bit disturbing rape scene, but I can't say that is enough to classify this film as pure horror. Basically, this is thriller/revenge/horror movie. The plot is pretty simple. A girl is raped and left for dead by 4 guys, but she recovers and goes after them and kills them one by one. With that said, I just don't consider this horror. And I must warn those of you that haven't seen the movie and get upset with graphic rape/violence. This film may not be your cup of tea! Anyway, as far as the film itself, considering the budget and the date it was made, it isn't that bad of a film. The acting isn't that horrible, and the story, though flawed, isn't too bad either. And this edition is pretty good, with a long awaited director commentary as well as a commentary by horror guru Joe Bob Briggs.

495432,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000009O8A,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[4, 4]","This movie definitely has a cult-B movie quality about it.  Therefore, I suppose it is safe to say that this film isn't for everyone.  However, I am not sure why people are so appalled by this movie.  The center of the story revolves around a rape and the aftermath of that event.  I also realize rape is one of the most disgusting acts that could transpire between two human beings.  With this taken into consideration, we as a society shouldn't watch this a pure entertainment, correct?  Well if that is the case we as a fellowship should wipe out viewing 90% television and motion pictures.  Reason being is that murder is a pretty nasty act, next to rape.  However, how many movies as ""entertainment"" do western civilization watch that includes murder and/or killing people?  Lethal Weapon (any part), XXX, Pulp Fiction, Face Off, Blade, Die Hard, Scarface, Desperado, Matrix, Bad Boys, should I keep going?I haven't even listed horror films, but let us think of twisted ways to kill other people.  Then the killer(s) can be dressed in really cool Halloween costumes and have multiple sequels.  Finally, we go to the theater and get seats for a showing that fits our capitalistic schedule, while eat over priced popcorn!  Isn't that the entire point of a horror movie and going to see one?  Well how about to sell it to the masses we remove all the blood, then we can make it PG-13!!!A perfect example of a movie with plenty of violence and killing is ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"".  This was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but that aside, watch the last action scene of this movie.  Branglina must have killed a hundred people, but there wasn't any blood.  This makes it alright for a PG-13 rating; therefore it is alright to send our youth to watch this movie.  So if you want to say ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a terrible movie and is tasteless, fine.  However, you better close theaters for blockbuster summer movies and/or cancel many televisions programs, because violence is everywhere, regardless if it is sexual driven or not.As for ""I Spit on Your Grave"" itself, does the movie have the greatest story line? No.  Is the acting unbelievable and amazing? No.  Will it win any awards? No.  However, all the aspects of the movie give it an element that is mesmerizing.  Now this movie is about a brutal rape, but that isn't all it's about.  One should wear the sign ""Myopic"" if they think this movie is only about rape.  It is about a rape and its aftermath.  How the character Jennifer reacts and deals with it.  I know I stated prior that the acting in this movie isn't unbelievable and amazing.  However, Camille Keaton (who sort of has this Fiona Apple quality about her) does a pretty good job in the movie.As for the DVD itself, ELITE ENTERTAINMENT did a great job in restoring the picture and sound.  However, I don't know why this movie was remastered in THX.  There is no major sound effects or really any music.  I suppose any conduit to George Lucas and Obi-Wan Kenobi is a good one.  There is also an audio commentary track with Joe Bob Riggs, which is very insightful.  As for the genre, I wouldn't list this as a horror movie at all.  I would consider it more a drama.  Nevertheless, the bathtub scene still makes my skin crawl.  Right fellas?In conclusion, I am not a person who is inclined to forgive a rapist or am one of these people that are turned on by sadistic acts such as rape.  I enjoy this movie because it is edgy; not your normal cookie cutter movie of today.  This type of motion picture wouldn't be made today; I suppose it is that postmodern John Calvin attitude that is bleeding over into media.  As for movies about rape, I want to remind everyone that there was a movie about rape that allowed Jodie Foster to win an academy award.",5,Can't see the forest through the trees.,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,3784,"['movie', 'definitely', 'cult-B', 'movie', 'quality', 'Therefore', 'suppose', 'safe', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'appalled', 'movie', 'center', 'story', 'around', 'rape', 'aftermath', 'event', 'also', 'realize', 'rape', 'one', 'most', 'disgusting', 'acts', 'could', 'transpire', 'two', 'human', 'beings', 'taken', 'consideration', 'society', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'correct', 'Well', 'case', 'fellowship', 'should', 'wipe', 'out', 'viewing', '90', '%', 'television', 'motion', 'pictures', 'Reason', 'being', 'murder', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'act', 'next', 'rape', 'However', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'entertainment', 'do', 'western', 'civilization', 'watch', 'murder', 'and/or', 'killing', 'people', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'part', 'XXX', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Face', 'Off', 'Blade', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Scarface', 'Desperado', 'Matrix', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'should', 'keep', 'going', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'listed', 'horror', 'films', 'let', 'think', 'twisted', 'ways', 'kill', 'other', 'people', 'Then', 'killer', 'can', 'be', 'dressed', 'really', 'cool', 'Halloween', 'costumes', 'have', 'multiple', 'sequels', 'Finally', 'go', 'theater', 'get', 'seats', 'showing', 'capitalistic', 'schedule', 'eat', 'priced', 'popcorn', ""n't"", 'entire', 'point', 'horror', 'movie', 'going', 'see', 'one', 'Well', 'how', 'about', 'sell', 'masses', 'remove', 'blood', 'then', 'can', 'make', 'PG-13', 'perfect', 'example', 'movie', 'plenty', 'violence', 'killing', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'aside', 'watch', 'last', 'action', 'scene', 'movie', 'Branglina', 'must', 'have', 'killed', 'hundred', 'people', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'blood', 'alright', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'alright', 'send', 'youth', 'watch', 'movie', 'So', 'want', 'say', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'terrible', 'movie', 'tasteless', 'fine', 'However', 'better', 'close', 'theaters', 'blockbuster', 'summer', 'movies', 'and/or', 'cancel', 'many', 'televisions', 'programs', 'violence', 'everywhere', 'regardless', 'sexual', 'driven', 'not.As', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'movie', 'have', 'greatest', 'story', 'line', 'No', 'acting', 'unbelievable', 'amazing', 'Will', 'win', 'awards', 'However', 'aspects', 'movie', 'give', 'element', 'mesmerizing', 'Now', 'movie', 'brutal', 'rape', ""n't"", 'about', 'One', 'should', 'wear', 'sign', 'Myopic', 'think', 'movie', 'only', 'rape', 'rape', 'aftermath', 'How', 'character', 'Jennifer', 'reacts', 'deals', 'know', 'stated', 'prior', 'acting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'unbelievable', 'amazing', 'However', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'who', 'sort', 'Fiona', 'Apple', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'movie.As', 'DVD', 'ELITE', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'restoring', 'picture', 'sound', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'remastered', 'THX', 'major', 'sound', 'effects', 'really', 'music', 'suppose', 'conduit', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Obi-Wan', 'Kenobi', 'good', 'one', 'also', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Joe', 'Bob', 'Riggs', 'very', 'insightful', 'genre', 'would', ""n't"", 'list', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'consider', 'more', 'drama', 'Nevertheless', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'still', 'skin', 'crawl', 'Right', 'fellas', 'conclusion', 'am', 'not', 'person', 'who', 'inclined', 'forgive', 'rapist', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'are', 'turned', 'sadistic', 'acts', 'such', 'rape', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'edgy', 'not', 'normal', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'movie', 'today', 'type', 'motion', 'picture', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'today', 'suppose', 'postmodern', 'John', 'Calvin', 'attitude', 'bleeding', 'over', 'media', 'movies', 'rape', 'want', 'remind', 'everyone', 'was', 'movie', 'rape', 'allowed', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'win', 'academy', 'award']",N/A

Yes, the rape scenes are awful, but look beyond that, and the film does have other key merits like the brilliant acting from Camille, beautiful cinematography, and the tension building scenes.What happens in this film, unfortunately, occurs in real life over and over.  The Director made the film after helping a lady who had been raped and saw her crawling out of the bushes. The film was his way of getting back at her victims.Look beyond the rape scenes, and you will see a film of courage and revenge.  The fact that so many people talk about this film indicates that the Director has succeeded in his mission. To remind us of the nastiness that goes on in this world, and that we should fight it.Definitely worth a viewing.",4,A film with some merits,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,1537,"['first', 'saw', '1984', 'teenager', 'video', 'tape', 'was', 'probably', 'cut', 'version', 'left', 'impression', 'awful', 'scenes', 'remember', 'thinking', 'how', 'brilliant', 'Camille', 'Keaton', 'was', 'role', 'victim', 'Very', 'convincing', 'Seeing', 'uncut', 'DVD', 'version', 'recently', 'adult', 'still', 'find', 'film', 'disturbing', 'not', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'do', 'often', 'referred', 'video', 'nasty', 'brutal', 'disgusting', 'Released', 'back', '1978', 'film', 'did', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', 'renamed', 'spit', 'grave', 'One', 'feel', 'new', 'title', 'helped', 'push', 'movie', 'being', 'banned', 'drew', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'today', 'standards', 'compare', 'film', 'such', '2003', 'Irreversible', 'film', ""n't"", 'as', 'difficult', 'sit', 'through', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'Yes', 'rape', 'scenes', 'are', 'awful', 'look', 'film', 'have', 'other', 'key', 'merits', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'Camille', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'tension', 'building', 'scenes.What', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'real', 'life', 'over', 'Director', 'made', 'film', 'helping', 'lady', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'raped', 'saw', 'crawling', 'bushes', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'getting', 'back', 'victims.Look', 'rape', 'scenes', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'courage', 'revenge', 'fact', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'talk', 'film', 'Director', 'succeeded', 'mission', 'remind', 'nastiness', 'world', 'should', 'fight', 'it.Definitely', 'viewing']",N/A
495441,A3LAMZZQSCYRTX,B000009O8A,wr,"[4, 8]","Part 1: A woman moves from the big city to a small hick town so that she can write a novel. Soon after her arrival she is assaulted ( BRUTALLY raped, beaten, ... and left for dead) by some locals.Part 2: After surviving the attack(s) she exacts revenge on each of her attackers one by one.That sums up the plot of the movie. That is all there is to it. Oh, I almost forgot the grotesque, and laughable, scene that is between part 1 and 2 where the heroine goes into a church and asks for forgivness for what she must do to the bad guys. This scene might have had some value had it been established earlier that she was a religious person but never mind.I don't have a problem with violence in movies, even when they are sick revenge fantasies like this wishes to be. The characters in this movie lacked any dimension so that it was impossible to have any sympathy for any of them. Obviously the filmmaker wants us to sympathize with the women but the way he tries to manipulate us into it by showing us this horrible brutality that is done to her is sick. My guess is that he does this so that maybe we'll think it's ok that she hangs, cuts up, and castrates her attackers. My main beef with this film is the rape scene. i see no reason why it needed to take up a third of the films running time. a good director should know that sometimes less is more. i think that making that long was a sick way of trying to manipulate us into sympathizing with his protagonist. Maybe he wouldn't have needed to do this if he would have properly developed his characters before jumping into the action. And why did he need to make it so graphic. Everyone i talk to says that it has the most realistically graphic rape scene ever. SO WHAT! Just because its realistic doesn't neccessarily make it good, or warranted for that matter. This film was just a showcase for the rape scene.My opinion is that this movie is garbage. If you want a good revenge movie then rent Death Wish or The Limey or anything for that matter. This film is scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel.

495442,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B000009O8A,Wuchak,"[5, 6]","Originally released in 1978 as ""Day of the Woman"" and re-released in 1980 with the more popular title (which writer/director Meir Zarchi hates),  ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is a low-budget film telling a simple story of rape-and-revenge. Jennifer Hill, a magazine writer from New York City, rents a country house for the summer to write her first novel. Four low-lifes catch wind of her and brutally rape her, leaving her for dead. She survives, however, and executes revenge on each, using their weaknesses against them (pride, lust and lack of intelligence).The film is notorious. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel have railed against it over the years, giving it a zero star rating. Most theaters understandably refused to show it back in '78-'80. But it became a big hit on video in the early 80s and there's still quite a buzz about it 3 decades later. The film simply can't be stopped, as Zarchi points out. I've repeatedly heard about it over the years and finally decided to give it an artistic appraisal.Since I knew going in that this was a rape-revenge film with overt depictions I was fully braced for the material and therefore didn't find it shocking. Don't get me wrong, the rape scenes are fairly explicit and fittingly disturbing but, for me, it wasn't shocking because I knew what I was getting into. I suppose it would be quite shocking otherwise. Regardless, I feel ""The Wild Angels,"" which was released a full 12 years earlier, is more shocking. See my review for details.I should add here that, although the picture is explicit with the rape-revenge scenes, it's not pornographic. In other words, this is not a film to view for porn thrills. Sexually speaking, the rape/revenge scenes are a turn-off rather than a turn-on, if you know what I mean.After viewing the film I saw it again with writer/director Meir Zarchi's commentary (something I very rarely do). He has a heavy accent but I was able to adjust after about ten minutes. I highly encourage anyone viewing the film to hear this excellent commentary. Meir is brilliant and offers loads of important details. For instance, he shares what inspired him to make the movie. In 1974 he came across a beaten, naked young woman stumbling out of the woods; she had a broken jaw and had been raped by two scumbags. She said they would have killed her but she convinced them she couldn't see without her glasses and therefore couldn't identify them. They then broke her jaw to knock her unconscious so they could make a getaway. She regained consciousness fairly quickly and wisely decided to immediately get out of the area in case they changed their minds. She crawled through the woods to the nearest road, which is where Zarchi came across her.The film shows that the four rapists are misogynists who feel powerless in their daily lives and are threatened by an intelligent, talented woman from the city. Listen to their moronic dialogue during the night-fishing sequence. These guys talk about women like they're 13 years old (but worse), even though they're all in their late 20s. And, don't get me wrong, I KNOW there are adult men like this out there. It's pathetic.The picture reveals how actions can be incredibly misinterpreted by people with sick minds. For instance, the leader of the rapists comments that when Jennifer first came to town and stopped at his gas station she got out of the car and flaunted her beauty, her legs and breast. But the viewer sees differently. The truth is she just got out of the car to stretch her legs (in a modest dress, by the way) and make some friendly small talk while he pumped gas for her.The film also reveals what's in the hearts of people, including the viewer. For instance, when film critic Roger Ebert saw the film at a theater he overheard a middle-aged man make troubling comments during the rape sequences like, ""That'll teach her"" and ""The others were good (the rapes) but this one's the best."" Ebert also heard a lady yell out during one of the revenge scenes, ""Get him, sister!"" (nothing wrong with that, of course).As for me, I was on the side of Jennier Hill the entire picture. This was obviously a very hard role to play and Camille Keaton did an incredible job; she even won a Best Actress award. Camille has a beautiful face and stunning locks of long auburn hair. But, at the time, she was way too thin for my tastes. She definitely needed to gain at least 20 pounds. Shortly after the film was released she married director Zarchi. Although the marriage didn't last, they remain good friends to this day.In any event, in the story Jennifer is a nice, beautiful, intelligent woman who just wants to get some time alone to enjoy nature and write her novel. She does absolutely nothing to provoke the abuse of the dirtbags.There's a church scene right before she enacts her revenge where she asks God for forgiveness. The real-life minister of the church caught wind of the nature of the film and contacted Zarchi, insisting that the parts depicting his church be taken out. Zarchi drove out to the church in Kent, Connecticut, where the film was made, and explained his reasons for making the picture. When the minister understood Zarchi's intentions he gave him his blessing.Speaking of the locations of the lush Kent area in Western Connecticut, this is one of the films highlights (I get sick of Southern California locations). In fact, believe it or not, it's one of the main items that prompted me to see the picture as I have personal interest in Western Connecticut.You'll see that the beauty of nature -- the sights and sounds of the forest -- are contrasted by the hideousness of human nature. This is effective.There's no score at all, even though Zarchi tried to fit music to it. He said it just didn't work; adding music diminished the impact. I agree.The film runs 100 minutes and it's all completely realistic until the 73-minute mark where Jennifer allows the mildly retarded rapist get close enough to her with a knife to easily kill her. She later allows the lead rapist the opportunity to get the upper hand (when she gives him the gun). I found this unbelievable. In both cases she could have easily killed the scumbags but instead momentarily makes herself vunerable to enact a more stylized revenge. I don't believe she would have done this in real life. But some would explain her actions on the grounds that she now no longer feared death (since she had been so close to it) and was willing to gamble with her life in order to punish the criminals in a way more fitting than a gunshot.Some may object to the idea of Jennifer having the strength to pull off the hanging, but Zarchi defends it by pointing out ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.""There are a couple other weak moments for which I detract 1 Star in my rating. In one close-up shot it's clear that the retarded guy's glasses are fake. Also, during the infamous bloodbath scene, wouldn't the guy realize he's been castrated right away (regardless of whether or not he's having an orgasm)? Dumb.Still, this is a powerful film, an important film and a necessary film. It counterbalances beauty with the hideousness of rape and supports the only just punishment for such extreme sins -- death. I should add that's it's not a movie to be watched in the presence of others. It's something you must experience alone, if at all.",4,Infamous but potent and worthwhile (for some),1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,7341,"['Originally', 'released', '1978', 'Day', 'Woman',

Well, I was able to watch the whole thing with my eyes open. And it's only sort of shocking. The death scenes are no gorier or violent than those in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; movies.

It makes the film feel so much shorter, and uncomplete. Now, Camille Keaton; I real liked her acting in this movie.
