712646,ARS45X2ZKUSAA,B00006FD92,B. Hassel,"[21, 23]",This show was perfection.  Anyone who enjoys the classic show Gilligan's Island MUST see this Documentary. The re-enactments were great.  Much better then just showing pictures and old clips. It shows how the show was created having look alike characters play the parts of the original cast. These actors were very entertaining. Especially when I wasn't too excited about seeing new actors filling the roles. But it turned out to be perfect. The DVD menus and extras are themed very closely to the show and make for some fun amusement. This just makes me want all 3 seasons from the original series on DVD even more.  I cannot wait for that day to come.  All Gilligan Island lovers must own this DVD.,5,Could not have been better - A Must for Gilligan Fans,1032998400,"09 26, 2002",2002,700,"['show', 'was', 'perfection', 'Anyone', 'who', 'classic', 'show', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'MUST', 'see', 'Documentary', 're-enactments', 'were', 'great', 'Much', 'better', 'then', 'just', 'showing', 'pictures', 'old', 'clips', 'how', 'show', 'was', 'created', 'having', 'look', 'characters', 'play', 'parts', 'original', 'cast', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Especially', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'excited', 'seeing', 'new', 'actors', 'filling', 'roles', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'menus', 'extras', 'are', 'themed', 'very', 'closely', 'show', 'make', 'fun', 'amusement', 'just', 'want', '3', 'seasons', 'original', 'series', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'day', 'come', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'lovers', 'must', 'own', 'DVD']",Surviving Gilligan's Island - The Incredibly True Story Of The Longest Three-Hour Tour In History

I taped it off the TV, but it would be nice to get it on DVD without commercials (there were a lot i believe).Very Nice. Hosted By Dawn Wells (Mary Ann Summers), Bob Denver (Willy Gilligan), & Russell Johnson (Proffesor Roy Hinkley ""The Proffesor""). It includes re-enactments of things that happend behind the scenes.I have a Gilligan website. I had known about their real names like Willy Gilligan and Roy Hinkley, and Mrs. Howell's name (Eunice Wentworth (Lovey) Howell), and the Skipper Jonas Grumby's name. Now they announced the whole Willy thing on this and now everyone thinks that's the only way I knew.It was a great special. I'm really glad they're releasing it on DVD. I hope they'll release all the episodes, and the other two movies, The Castaways on Gilligan's Island, and The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligans Island on DVD. They're not even on VHS. Hopefully the quality on those will be better than the rescue from gilligans island dvd. I heard that wasn't very good. I have that on VHS.GREAT MOVIE.",5,Gilligan,1030492800,"08 28, 2002",2002,1081,"['was', 'TV', 'Special', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'November', 'think', 'taped', 'off', 'TV', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'DVD', 'commercials', 'were', 'lot', 'believe', '.Very', 'Nice', 'Hosted', 'Dawn', 'Wells', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Summers', 'Bob', 'Denver', 'Willy', 'Gilligan', 'Russell', 'Johnson', 'Proffesor', 'Roy', 'Hinkley', 'Proffesor', 're-enactments', 'things', 'happend', 'scenes.I', 'have', 'Gilligan', 'website', 'had', 'known', 'real', 'names', 'Willy', 'Gilligan', 'Roy', 'Hinkley', 'Mrs.', 'Howell', 'name', 'Eunice', 'Wentworth', 'Lovey', 'Howell', 'Skipper', 'Jonas', 'Grumby', 'name', 'Now', 'announced', 'whole', 'Willy', 'thing', 'now', 'everyone', 'only', 'way', 'knew.It', 'was', 'great', 'special', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', ""'re"", 'releasing', 'DVD', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'release', 'episodes', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'Castaways', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Harlem', 'Globetrotters', 'Gilligans', 'Island', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'VHS', 'Hopefully', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'rescue', 'gilligans', 'island', 'dvd', 'heard', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'have', 'VHS.GREAT', 'MOVIE']",Surviving Gilligan's Island - The Incredibly True Story Of The Longest Three-Hour Tour In History

However, the film does contain some corny and cheesy points, which is something to frown upon.

This documentary shows younger actresses and actors potraying the cast and creator and other people behind ""Gilligan's Island"" in little drama segments and even has pieces with the real Gilligan, Mary Ann, and Professor!
