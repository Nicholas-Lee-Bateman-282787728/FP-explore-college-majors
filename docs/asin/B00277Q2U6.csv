1253658,A2U83VDVJMAB2U,B00277Q2U6,Brian Baker,"[5, 7]","This movie certainly didn't live up to my expectations as generated by the previews. I was expecting a quirky film -- this IS from the Lynch family, after all -- but unfortunately it failed even on that level.First of all, I'd figured out the major plot device within the first 15 minutes. Not a good sign. Then, as soon as the motel murders hit the screen (and that's all the spoiler info you'll find here), it was obvious to me what was going on -- and that's the final little twist at the end.So, basically, this movie was utterly predictable.Another problem: the behavior of the cops in this rural area. Granted, they're in the middle of nowhere, but for the two cops played by French Stewart (good and different role for him, btw) and Kent Harper to be able to continually get away with terrorizing passing motorists without ANYONE ever lodging a complaint or filing charges with higher authorities simply defies belief and reality. These people ARE supposedly still in the United States, after all, not some Twilight Zone alternate reality.Now, I've never been a fan of slasher flicks because they always struck me as dumb and boring. People do really stupid things, then are completely surprised when some psycho/slasher/ghost/monster cuts them to ribbons. So maybe this movie falls into that category. If so, then it's pretty well executed for that type of movie.Which brings us to the upside, and the two stars I'm giving it. Within the limitations I've already mentioned, this film is directed very well by Jennifer Lynch, who also was a co-writer (tempting to say one cancels the other). Ormond and Pullman are always a pleasure to watch at work. Their characterizations are seamless and flawless, as are those by all the supporting players.So, basically, not a bad movie as a RENTAL. But as to actually paying the money to buy it? No value for the investment, and I really can't imagine watching it more than once, so what would be the point?",2,VERY predictable,1250899200,"08 22, 2009",2009,1954,"['movie', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'generated', 'previews', 'was', 'expecting', 'quirky', 'film', 'Lynch', 'family', 'unfortunately', 'failed', 'even', 'level.First', ""'d"", 'figured', 'out', 'major', 'plot', 'device', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'Not', 'good', 'sign', 'Then', 'as', 'soon', 'motel', 'murders', 'hit', 'screen', 'spoiler', 'info', ""'ll"", 'find', 'here', 'was', 'obvious', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'final', 'little', 'twist', 'end.So', 'basically', 'movie', 'was', 'utterly', 'predictable.Another', 'problem', 'behavior', 'cops', 'rural', 'area', 'Granted', ""'re"", 'middle', 'nowhere', 'two', 'cops', 'played', 'French', 'Stewart', 'good', 'different', 'role', 'btw', 'Kent', 'Harper', 'be', 'able', 'continually', 'get', 'away', 'terrorizing', 'passing', 'motorists', 'ANYONE', 'ever', 'lodging', 'complaint', 'filing', 'charges', 'higher', 'authorities', 'simply', 'defies', 'belief', 'reality', 'people', 'ARE', 'supposedly', 'still', 'United', 'States', 'not', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'alternate', 'reality.Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'always', 'struck', 'dumb', 'boring', 'People', 'do', 'really', 'stupid', 'things', 'then', 'are', 'completely', 'surprised', 'when', 'psycho/slasher/ghost/monster', 'cuts', 'ribbons', 'So', 'maybe', 'movie', 'category', 'so', 'then', 'pretty', 'well', 'executed', 'type', 'movie.Which', 'brings', 'upside', 'two', 'stars', ""'m"", 'giving', 'limitations', ""'ve"", 'already', 'mentioned', 'film', 'directed', 'very', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'co-writer', 'tempting', 'say', 'one', 'other', 'Ormond', 'Pullman', 'are', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'work', 'characterizations', 'are', 'seamless', 'flawless', 'are', 'supporting', 'players.So', 'basically', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'RENTAL', 'actually', 'paying', 'money', 'buy', 'No', 'value', 'investment', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point']",N/A
1253659,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B00277Q2U6,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[5, 9]","Disclaimer: I watched this film as a streaming rental, and cannot comment on the video or audio quality of this disc.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.After a brutal home invasion and murder, two FBI agents - Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond - are dispatched to a small town to assist the local police department with the investigation.  Told both in real time and in flashback, the film cleverly dispenses scraps of information - via witnesses' accounts of the crime's aftermath - to tease out the interest of the viewer and then sets the hook with its initial 'Rashoman' nod by suggesting the truth is rather malleable.  Whether or not the story's grim resolution will come as a surprise to anyone probably has more to do with how many films of this sort one is used to watching - I wouldn't call it predictable, though I wouldn't consider it surprising either - but the smart lead-up to the end, the actors abilities, and the technical competence of the film all indicate that this should have been an above average movie.And some are still likely to think so. Yet from the beginning, as the very brutal home invasion scenes is interspersed with the credits, I found myself disliking the film's gleeful indulgence in brutality.  Film violence is a tricky thing: I've seen worse than these few seconds, yet the stark visuals combined with the editing techniques engendered, in this viewer at least, a feeling that it wasn't inserted only for the manipulative effect of gaining my sympathy for the victims, but that there was a certain amount of delight in presenting it.This section ends quickly and abruptly, and then piecing together the mystery becomes the film's primary focus.  As I mentioned before, this part of the film is actually engaging, although I still found myself viscerally reacting to elements of the story.  On the day following the home invasion, four groups - including the perpetrators - slowly converge on a deserted stretch of highway, and the film tracks the survivor's stories from that fateful meeting.  One of the witnesses is a patrolman, whose partner did not survive the encounter.  Without giving too much away, suffice it to say that his story, and the flashback of his and his partner's actions, seem designed - along with the initial scenes of the home invasion - to stamp onto the viewer's mind that the world is randomly cruel and you are absolutely powerless to do anything about it, should the world turn its eyes on you.I can accept that concept as a legitimate subject for a filmmaker - albeit one I'm not particularly interested in watching as entertainment - but I also had the inescapable feeling that not only did the filmmaker's enjoy cramming this down my throat, but that in this evaluation of regular joes, authority figures, and those who have put themselves beyond all restraint, the film suggests an affinity for the unbridled hedonism of the killers - a celebration of their supremacy.But that may not have been the intent at all.  It may be that the filmmaker's were only looking at telling an old story in an inventive way, which will surely appeal to some viewers.  But because it offers few real insights into the world, I have to believe that the end result is submitted as entertainment, which puts it on untenable ground.",1,Untenable,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",2011,3317,"['Disclaimer', 'watched', 'film', 'streaming', 'rental', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'disc', 'review', 'concerned', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only.After', 'brutal', 'home', 'invasion', 'murder', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'are', 'dispatched', 'small', 'town', 'assist', 'local', 'police', 'department', 'investigation', 'Told', 'real', 'time', 'flashback', 'film', 'cleverly', 'scraps', 'information', 'witnesses', 'accounts', 'crime', 'aftermath', 'tease', 'out', 'interest', 'viewer', 'then', 'hook', 'initial', ""'Rashoman"", 'nod', 'suggesting', 'truth', 'rather', 'malleable', 'not', 'story', 'grim', 'resolution', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'probably', 'more', 'do', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'sort', 'one', 'used', 'watching', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'predictable', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'surprising', 'smart', 'lead-up', 'end', 'actors', 'abilities', 'technical', 'competence', 'film', 'indicate', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'above', 'average', 'movie.And', 'are', 'still', 'likely', 'think', 'so', 'beginning', 'very', 'brutal', 'home', 'invasion', 'scenes', 'interspersed', 'credits', 'found', 'disliking', 'film', 'gleeful', 'indulgence', 'brutality', 'Film', 'violence', 'tricky', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'few', 'seconds', 'yet', 'stark', 'visuals', 'combined', 'editing', 'techniques', 'engendered', 'viewer', 'least', 'feeling', 'was', ""n't"", 'inserted', 'only', 'manipulative', 'effect', 'gaining', 'sympathy', 'victims', 'was', 'certain', 'amount', 'delight', 'presenting', 'it.This', 'section', 'quickly', 'abruptly', 'then', 'piecing', 'together', 'mystery', 'film', 'primary', 'focus', 'mentioned', 'before', 'part', 'film', 'actually', 'engaging', 'still', 'found', 'viscerally', 'reacting', 'elements', 'story', 'day', 'following', 'home', 'invasion', 'four', 'groups', 'including', 'perpetrators', 'slowly', 'converge', 'deserted', 'stretch', 'highway', 'film', 'survivor', 'stories', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'One', 'witnesses', 'patrolman', 'partner', 'did', 'not', 'survive', 'encounter', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'suffice', 'say', 'story', 'flashback', 'partner', 'actions', 'seem', 'designed', 'initial', 'scenes', 'home', 'invasion', 'stamp', 'viewer', 'mind', 'world', 'randomly', 'cruel', 'are', 'absolutely', 'powerless', 'do', 'anything', 'should', 'world', 'turn', 'eyes', 'you.I', 'can', 'accept', 'concept', 'legitimate', 'subject', 'filmmaker', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'interested', 'watching', 'entertainment', 'also', 'had', 'inescapable', 'feeling', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'filmmaker', 'enjoy', 'cramming', 'down', 'throat', 'evaluation', 'regular', 'joes', 'authority', 'figures', 'who', 'have', 'put', 'restraint', 'film', 'affinity', 'unbridled', 'hedonism', 'killers', 'celebration', 'supremacy.But', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'intent', 'may', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'were', 'only', 'looking', 'telling', 'old', 'story', 'inventive', 'way', 'will', 'surely', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'few', 'real', 'insights', 'world', 'have', 'believe', 'end', 'result', 'submitted', 'entertainment', 'untenable', 'ground']",N/A

His daughter seems to be picking up the baton and keeping some of the loopiness of her old man without totally running her audience through the ringer.Surveillance starts out with a multiple murder which isn't shown quite well enough to let the audience in on who the players are or their motives. As things proceed the viewer is introduced to a handful of characters in some bust-out desert town. Most of these people are seriously whacked. I won't give anything away but the thought that people like this may very well exist in the world is enough to make your skin crawl. Then arrives Bill Pullman and Juliette Binoche as FBI agents Investigating a serial killer. They have photos and files and seem to know their procedures and interrogation hardware. The investigation proceeds and all sorts of odd answers and behaviors emerge from all involved. As things unwind I thought (maybe the word is hoped) that this was all going to turn out a certain way, but it doesn't. I liked the way I was manipulated while watching.All the aspects of production are good. I liked the directing. Some of the acting may be to cartoonish for some, and though I took note of it, it didn't bother me.I liked this movie. It's quirky enough to satisfy that sensibility in me but enough story to keep me guessing. Many of the paid critics didn't much care for it and some seem to know how it was going to end.

A good cast of actors with Julia Ormond, Bill Pullman, Michael Ironside and even French Stewart. It was produced by David Lynch, the man who did Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr., Twin Peaks, Dune, among others. It was even directed by his daughter.So you would this this movie would be a good suspense thriller. And at first it was. With three different serial killer survivors points of view and the FBI and police trying to figure out what happened. There are essentially two movies here. The first two thirds which is riveting and very well done, and a big surprise you don't see coming unless you pay attention. That's where things quickly go down hill from there the plot holes and how the writers try to fill them are terrible. Which brings out the other flaws of the movie you didn't notice before.For example how incompetent they portray the police in this movie. I'm willing to except the police will miss some stuff they do in real life, but this kind of incompetents is only found in comedies like police academy. I would go on but I don't want to give away the twist.The acting was very well done by the actors above. I've always liked Michael Ironside from his early works in V, Top Gun, SeaQuest DSV to The Perfect Storm, Splinter Cell(Voice of Sam Fisher), and Terminator Salvation. Sure he can't carry a film, but he is a very good actor who is always great as a supporting actor in virtually ever thing he does.The directing by Jennifer Chambers Lynch was decently done, but could have been much better.The action/visuals were pretty good since they obviously didn't have that big a budget for this film, and they did a good job.Overall a decent suspense/thriller, but don't be surprised if you are let down by the final act.",3,A good movie that ultimately was a let down.,1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,1805,"['Surveillance', 'direct', 'DVD', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'good', 'cast', 'actors', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'even', 'French', 'Stewart', 'was', 'produced', 'David', 'Lynch', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Dune', 'others', 'was', 'even', 'directed', 'daughter.So', 'would', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'first', 'was', 'three', 'different', 'serial', 'killer', 'survivors', 'points', 'view', 'FBI', 'police', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'are', 'essentially', 'two', 'movies', 'here', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'riveting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'big', 'surprise', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'pay', 'attention', 'where', 'things', 'quickly', 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'plot', 'holes', 'how', 'writers', 'try', 'fill', 'are', 'terrible', 'out', 'other', 'flaws', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'before.For', 'example', 'how', 'incompetent', 'portray', 'police', 'movie', ""'m"", 'willing', 'police', 'will', 'miss', 'stuff', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'kind', 'incompetents', 'only', 'found', 'comedies', 'police', 'academy', 'would', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'twist.The', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'early', 'works', 'V', 'Top', 'Gun', 'SeaQuest', 'DSV', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'Splinter', 'Cell', 'Voice', 'Sam', 'Fisher', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'Sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'always', 'great', 'supporting', 'actor', 'virtually', 'ever', 'thing', 'directing', 'Jennifer', 'Chambers', 'Lynch', 'was', 'decently', 'done', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.The', 'action/visuals', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'budget', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job.Overall', 'decent', 'suspense/thriller', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'are', 'let', 'down', 'final', 'act']",N/A

I thought the trailer looked interesting, so I set the DVR on our cable box to record the showing.It was entertaining but disturbing. I guess that can be expected from a director who happens to be the daughter of the famous David Lynch. Lynch is the director that brought us Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man and Mulholland Drive.Jennifer Lynch co-wrote, co-produced and directed Surveillance, which is described as a crime drama. This is Lynch's second effort in directing. The description on HDNet states FBI agent (Bill Pullman) searching for a serial killer meets three potential victims with differing accounts of the same encounter. The movie also stars Julia Ormond as Pullman's partner.The story starts with the brutal murder of a man and woman by two masked perpetrators. The story progresses on with two crooked cops who take pleasure in terrorizing persons driving through their small community. The two officers delight in playing the old good cop - bad cop routine after shooting out tires of speeding vehicles. However, the crooked cop behavior pales in comparison to the horrific events that transpire with the masked perpetrators. The movie tries really hard to place the viewer in the position of suspecting the crooked cops as the perpetrators, but the odd behavior of the investigating FBI agents makes the movie fairly predictable. The FBI agents show up at the local police department after their are a series of murders in the area, and they are completing an investigation with the witnesses that survived the horrific events on the country road involving a family on vacation and a couple who arrived on the scene after partaking a number of drugs.  Their investigation turns to some strange behavior and psychotic murders of the witnesses.  The perpetrators are the FBI agents, but we later learn that they are strictly crazed lunatics sexually turned on by murdering people who killed the FBI agents and took their place covering their tracks.Ormond and Pullman put together some great performances, but their characters both seem to enjoy their work and company too much. They sort to give away that they are deeply connected to the events. While this does not ruin the movie, it made me feel like I was way ahead of the story and could see things before they happened.The story is unique, but predictable in the actions of the characters portrayed by Pullman and Ormond.

We see two small town police having their version of fun at the expense of people passing through their stretch of highway.  The games the two policeman play at the beginning are nothing compared to the games that will take place later on.  We see a blended family trying to enjoy a vacation together.  We see a couple fueled by drugs and youth.  Add the local police station and the FBI team sent to investigate the latest violent homicide of a serial killer and you have one heck of a movie.The plot twist is not obvious but can be figured out by the end.

It both grates on the nerves and it painful to watch-- it is the type of film that should only entertain the lobotomized or those who love their MTV-style filmmaking.The film concerns the investigation of a highway massacre, and it tries to be a dark-humored thriller. Rather, in Surveillance the joke is on itself when it quickly divulges in the worst clich&eacute;s of cult films and the often criticisms of the directorial work of Jennifer's father, David. The movie does horrible in balancing its serious and comedic elements, and the actors in the film might as well be shambling through an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Then again, that makes it sound better than it really is.The script is littered with alleged one-liners that fall flat and deflate the more straight-faced aspect, while the plot takes dumb detours especially in the climax, and directing wise the film does nothing to inspire a reaction or emotion in the viewer. The film is never interesting, it is merely just there.Moreover, when asking one to pinpoint just what is wrong with the film is like asking a sane person to give you a metaphorical analysis of ink blots: there's not much point or purpose in it and it does nothing more than waste time. The film tries to have a complex plot and stumbles greatly. It is not funny or smart. Rather, it is pathetically structured, feels disjointed, and is never scary, edgy, or interesting.

1253695,A387BD735MI50R,B00277Q2U6,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","Jennifer Lynch, David Lynch's daughter, directed this gore fest with lots of twists, lots of surprises. In the Director's Commentary, Ms. Lynch reports that her father pronounced her as being ""totally demented"" when he saw the film in its original cut.She left one highly erotic scene out of the actual movie and put it in among the ""Deleted Scenes"" extras. She also went with a somewhat more subdued ending. The clever, unexpected action is still book-ended by two bloodbaths though. So those who like the ""Saw"" series will probably enjoy this film. But those who enjoy more cerebral thrillers, filled with subtle clues about the nature of the killers, will also find fresh meat here.In the first half of the film, we see some policemen having ""fun"" by stopping, hassling, and humiliating cross-country drivers. I might initially have thought this sequence launched the film into completely over-the-top, unbelievable territory. However I happened to be reading Philip Zimbardo's book, ""The Lucifer Effect"" during the same week I saw this movie. In the book, Zimbardo demonstrates how being given uniforms and authority can completely transform some people into tyrants. Ms. Lynch also confirmed that when a policeman friend of hers saw her movie, he said he'd witnessed just that sort of abuse of power at work. So perhaps those police infractions weren't so completely over-the-top impossible after all.However the psychology of the killers does really seem to be without counterpart in reality. Nevertheless, if you take the action as somewhat surreal, as extreme exaggeration - you will probably find yourself overlooking its lack of psychological veracity and get absorbed into its sheer erotic gruesomeness.I did find myself taking the action seriously, viewing the characters in earnest. So Jennifer Lynch's Director's Commentary, which had a breezy, bawdy frat house quality to it, detracted from the film's impact for me.

If you accept this fact, then life will make more sense, but only in a very weird way.Surveillance is set in a town so small, out of the way, and downright boring that the local cops spend their days shooting out the tires of speeders on the freeway. Their follow-up routine is to put the drivers through a humiliating encounter with the law that guarantees they will either never speed again, or never travel through this part of the state.During one of these confrontations something very bad happened. And the very bad thing is somehow connected to a recent series of grisly murders in the area.Enter two FBI agents, sent with their black suits, interrogation training, emotional tics, and cameras to interview everyone involved and get to the bottom of the story. The agents (played with verve and wit by Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond) are as eccentric as their subjects--a rattled police officer, a traumatized little girl, and a young woman who trusts no one. As each character recounts part of the story from their limited point of view, a sort of Rashomon develops. Even if everyone is telling the truth, something doesn't make sense.In her first full-length feature since 1993's Boxing Helena, writer/director Jennifer Lynch uses our expectation of her and her father (executive producer David Lynch) to clever advantage. From the beginning, we suspect that lies are being told, but by whom, and for what purpose? Not knowing makes it difficult to side with anyone, so there is no clear-cut protagonist. Further alienating the viewer is the Lynch signature soundtrack, often inappropriate or off tempo.As certain suspicions are confirmed, and we think we have it all figured out, new and awful surprises come to light. The build is almost excruciating, but the pay-off is oh so sweet. The story's loose ends are tied snugly together, by the final scene. And if you have ever been as bored as the cops who patrol the fringes of this flat, deadbeat town you will probably find the conclusion both creepy and funny.Kudos to Ms. Lynch for the oddball casting in Surveillance. Ormond and Pullman are delightful as middle-aged interrogators with secrets of their own.

Was not prepared for the level of depravity, and I think that is partially responsible for the hate directed at this film. I could not give this a higher rating on the product review end because I was just not that impressed with the Blu results.A plot description beyond the poorly written version of events on the cover typically gives too much away, as noted on several other reviews here (as bad as it sounds try not to read most of the other reviews here as they keep giving the twist away - which once the film is done, the twist is the only worthwhile plot device). The performances are good, especially in the final 18 minutes of carnage and Natural Born Killer references, and when the credits roll, you will probably find yourself either aligning with the half that hated everything about it, or the other half that felt Lynch's daughter is definitely following the train to left field (therefore loving it).The picture clarity is a mixed bag as the majority of flashback sequences are done with a heavy grain and an over saturation. The colors are overexposed during those times also, insofar that the Blu display isn't exactly given a fair shake. The DTS is sporadically excellent, but there was some obvious mixing problems during the police station sequences (reference the hall echoes and interrogations). The supplements are short but include:* 15 minute making-of that covers the production in a Lynch kind of way (complete with her dropping the F bomb 30 or so times as she directs to make her point). If anything, the obvious humor the crew had with the Canadian town name - Regina - was fun to watch (they kept repeating ""the town that rhymes with the word for fun"").* 5 Minute HDNET clip, essentially a long trailer.* 12 minutes of deleted scenes; they prove the gratuitous and over-the-top nature Lynch was working towards - as yes, these include the now famous cuts of Ormond and Pullman smothering themselves in lard and love - for a very lengthy time. The alternate ending is very different than what one sees in the main cut; much more Romeo and Juliet.Sitting on the fence on whether to recommend it outright or not, so I would have to say it might be worth spending your BD budget on this one if you are a big fan of Lynch; and without giving too much away, wanting to see Pullman and Ormond do something very different. 3 for the film, 1 for the extras, enjoy.",4,"Not a solid Blu, but definitely a Lynch film",1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2431,"['What', 'wicked', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Was', 'not', 'prepared', 'level', 'depravity', 'think', 'partially', 'responsible', 'hate', 'directed', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'product', 'review', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'impressed', 'Blu', 'results.A', 'plot', 'description', 'poorly', 'written', 'version', 'events', 'cover', 'typically', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'noted', 'several', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'as', 'bad', 'try', 'not', 'read', 'most', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'keep', 'giving', 'twist', 'away', 'once', 'film', 'done', 'twist', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'plot', 'device', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'final', '18', 'minutes', 'carnage', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killer', 'references', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'either', 'aligning', 'half', 'hated', 'everything', 'other', 'half', 'felt', 'Lynch', 'daughter', 'definitely', 'following', 'train', 'left', 'field', 'loving', 'picture', 'clarity', 'mixed', 'bag', 'majority', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'are', 'done', 'heavy', 'grain', 'saturation', 'colors', 'are', 'overexposed', 'times', 'also', 'Blu', 'display', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'given', 'fair', 'shake', 'DTS', 'sporadically', 'excellent', 'was', 'obvious', 'mixing', 'problems', 'police', 'station', 'sequences', 'reference', 'hall', 'echoes', 'interrogations', 'supplements', 'are', 'short', 'include', '*', '15', 'minute', 'making-of', 'production', 'Lynch', 'kind', 'way', 'complete', 'dropping', 'F', 'bomb', '30', 'so', 'times', 'make', 'point', 'anything', 'obvious', 'humor', 'crew', 'had', 'Canadian', 'town', 'name', 'Regina', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'kept', 'repeating', 'town', 'word', 'fun', '5', 'Minute', 'HDNET', 'clip', 'essentially', 'long', 'trailer', '12', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'prove', 'gratuitous', 'over-the-top', 'nature', 'Lynch', 'was', 'working', 'towards', 'yes', 'include', 'now', 'famous', 'cuts', 'Ormond', 'Pullman', 'smothering', 'lard', 'love', 'very', 'lengthy', 'time', 'alternate', 'ending', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'one', 'main', 'cut', 'much', 'more', 'Romeo', 'Juliet.Sitting', 'fence', 'recommend', 'outright', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'spending', 'BD', 'budget', 'one', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'Lynch', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'wanting', 'see', 'Pullman', 'Ormond', 'do', 'something', 'very', 'different', '3', 'film', '1', 'extras', 'enjoy']",N/A

1253704,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00277Q2U6,trebe,"[2, 2]","Writer/director Jennifer Lynch's crime thriller Surveillance (2008) involves such a major plot twist, that saying much that is specific about the film, would probably ruin the experience for anyone that has not yet seen it.  This makes reviewing the film tricky, as this is the kind of film that people typically have strong feelings about.  Unfortunately limiting comments to generalities, isn't particularly useful to those curious about the movie.I found the film much like a magician's illusion, where director Lynch was trying very hard to amaze and impress her audience, while employing misdirection and showmanship.  The results are not entirely satisfying.  The method of storytelling, recounting events in a series of remembrances by different characters, does succeed in building up some tension and suspense, as it takes a while to figure out what has happened.  One would have to be a very attentive viewer, to pick up on most of the major significant plot elements, during an initial viewing.Is the film worth your time?  My answer would be yes.  There is an eclectic variety of characters, some provocative situations, unexpected violence, and attempts at razzle-dazzle.  It is kind of a challenge to try and put the pieces together.  The ending may or may not satisfy, but in many respects this film is more about the journey than the final destination, mainly because the movie's big ""secret"" just isn't very plausible.What I find highly significant, is that upon the advice of her father, director David Lynch (The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway), Jennifer Lynch rewrote the ending.  It was excellent advice, as the revised ending is a major improvement over the original, which is frankly a disaster.  The original ending is included as a deleted scene.The writing is good in places, but perhaps not as smart as the author may think, as realism is often stretched thin, and the story unravels badly near the end.  The acting is generally very good, in that the performances are very much in tune with the screenplay.  Pell James stands out as a sassy drug abuser who is one of the witnesses to the crime.  Ryan Simpkins' performance is edgy, as a little girl who is also a witness.  French Stewart and Kent Harper are excellent as a couple of unscrupulous cops.  Cheri Oteri, probably most known for her stint on SNL, is solid in a dramatic role.  Julia Ormond's performance is credible most of the way.  I have a big problem with the way Lynch has written Bill Pullman's character, an FBI Agent.  He starts as a straight kind of sleepy guy, who later transforms to someone channeling parts of Robin Williams' dramatic persona.  Pullman's performance is probably true to the screenplay, it's just that the character is just a bit too much.Judging by what is seen and heard in the bonus material and commentary track, Jennifer Lynch is a tough lady, in tune with both violent and subtle elements.  In her free-flowing commentary, Lynch demonstrates that she can be both articulate, and spew more profanity than Uwe Boll, while being fascinated by such arcane matters as the Canadian province of Regina, the beauty of the sky, and Julia Ormond's good looks.Surveillance is a tense, edgy thriller, that's a little too pretentious about being clever.  Lots of things don't add up, and questions are left unanswered.

1253705,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00277Q2U6,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","Two FBI agents Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond arrive at a local police station to investigate a grisly murder case. Their unique ""investigation"" involves videotaping witnesses (and survivors) of the case separately. With the narrative structure that is clearly inspired by Kurosawa's influential classic, Jennifer Lynch's second feature film since her awful ""Boxing Helena"" attempts to explore intriguing issues like the good and the evil, but the end result is more like a direct-to-DVD thriller with a high dose of violence.That is not to say ""Surveillance"" is a mess. The use of ""Rashomon""-like narrative is a good idea and the thriller certainly has its moments, but it suffers from dull storytelling and bad editing, and it is obvious that Jennifer Lynch doesn't have her own style, narratively or visually, except wallowing in the lengthy descriptions of sadistic human nature.Don't get me wrong. I am not against the idea of describing violence in films. I am just saying that, give the same material to other more skilled directors - Alfred Hitchcock, William Wyler or David Lynch - and they will turn it into more entertaining, elaborate, and even twisted films without losing the demented nature of some characters, or the disturbing undercurrent of the storyline.Some reviewers understandably complain that the film is too dark, or even ""sick."" To me, the most disappointing part is the director's banal idea of ""good"" and ""evil."" In ""Surveillance,"" for instance, a certain character represents the former, which is so predictable. As to the evil part, well, despite the best effort from the cast, it sadly lacks the charisma of Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper' character of ""Blue Velvet.""",2,Nice Ideas Poorly Executed,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,1694,"['Two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'Julia', 'Ormond', 'arrive', 'local', 'police', 'station', 'investigate', 'grisly', 'murder', 'case', 'unique', 'investigation', 'videotaping', 'witnesses', 'survivors', 'case', 'separately', 'narrative', 'structure', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'Kurosawa', 'influential', 'classic', 'Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'awful', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'attempts', 'explore', 'intriguing', 'issues', 'good', 'evil', 'end', 'result', 'more', 'direct-to-DVD', 'thriller', 'high', 'dose', 'violence.That', 'not', 'say', 'Surveillance', 'mess', 'use', 'Rashomon', '-like', 'narrative', 'good', 'idea', 'thriller', 'certainly', 'moments', 'dull', 'storytelling', 'bad', 'editing', 'obvious', 'Jennifer', 'Lynch', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'style', 'narratively', 'visually', 'wallowing', 'lengthy', 'descriptions', 'sadistic', 'human', 'nature.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'not', 'idea', 'describing', 'violence', 'films', 'am', 'just', 'saying', 'give', 'same', 'material', 'other', 'more', 'skilled', 'directors', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'William', 'Wyler', 'David', 'Lynch', 'will', 'turn', 'more', 'entertaining', 'elaborate', 'even', 'twisted', 'films', 'losing', 'demented', 'nature', 'characters', 'disturbing', 'undercurrent', 'storyline.Some', 'reviewers', 'understandably', 'complain', 'film', 'too', 'dark', 'even', 'sick', 'most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'director', 'banal', 'idea', 'good', 'evil', 'Surveillance', 'instance', 'certain', 'character', 'former', 'so', 'predictable', 'evil', 'part', 'well', 'best', 'effort', 'cast', 'sadly', 'charisma', 'Frank', 'Booth', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'character', 'Blue', 'Velvet']",N/A

1253707,A1H8HHH9WCHZO9,B00277Q2U6,"William A Baurle ""WeeWillyWinky""","[2, 12]","**Edited on 5.23.14I wonder why the 10 people who didn't care for my review have not offered a comment? I welcome any negative comments, even hateful ones. Can you convince me that this is a good film? Please try. I am open-minded and willing, even eager, to alter my opinion of this piece of work. As God and Christ are my witness.*I won't critique the technical merits of this film, and by technical I mean camera work, cinematography, sound. In that regard it's a professional piece of work; but esthetically speaking, it's a piece of garbage with barely more artistic value than a porn film. In fact, I've seen porn films with more esthetic value than this. Much more.If you're going to do a movie about psychotics and sadists wreaking havoc on innocent people, make the victims sympathetic in some fashion. Let's have some character development! If your psychotics and sadists are going to win at the end of the day, fine, but let me sympathize with them on some tiny level. How about some back story? How about some character development, for Christ's sake?Our victims here are a couple of druggies on the loose with God only knows what purpose or intentions, and a seemingly dysfunctional family with absolutely zero  charm or personality. Throw in a couple of sadistic cops who seem to have a thing for each other (not that there's anything wrong with that), and who entertain themselves by terrorizing passing motorists and playing good cop bad/cop and other puerile psychological games. When the sick cops are done playing and leave the scene of their terror, the dysfunctional wife and female druggie get together for a beer and some chuckles on the side of the road while the dysfunctional father-figure whines softly and ineptly about reporting the incident. Gee that's drama for you.There is one redeeming character in all of this, but unfortunately she is nothing but a cliche. A young girl, part of the dysfunctional family out on the road in the boonies, very sweet and very innocent, and of course very gifted, maybe even psychic. Ooooh! Chills! She sees things other people don't see. She knows things other people don't know. She's a single strand of goodness in a  tangled trainwreck of stupidity, dullness, timidity, and psychopathic evil. We've seen her a million times, only this time she doesn't even seem too worked up about her dead family members. She's a cool, distant, worn-out cliche.SPOILERS:Meanwhile back at the station, two bad-ass FBI agents are conducting an investigation with the not so helpful local authorities. Scene after scene of smart-assed dialogue, silly cliched stand-offs with plenty of hands-on-hips blinking and grinning, barely contained derision, open mockery, and stupid jokes. You've seen every smirk a thousand times. The FBI agents are the only characters who will draw the interest of the viewer, and you are tricked into getting into their corner right from the start, thanks to the complete absence of anything interesting or meritorious from the rest of the cast. And this turns out to be a trick which will get you nothing and will only piss you off, that is unless you actually enjoy cheering for the deranged psychos of the world, in which case this movie will be a rare treat for you.
