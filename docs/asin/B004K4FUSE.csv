In this film the blushing bride doesn't get her happy fairytale ending while her lifelong friends watch her in bliss; so happy. No. Instead the story takes a more interesting turn where karma kicks in like its supposed to. This movie is absolutely hysterical and very entertaining to watch. It also has some sweet romances woven into the storyline that are quite enjoyable to watch blossom. This is a wonderfully funny and sweet movie that I have found myself watching over and over again.

First, she likes romantic comedies, and second we prefer movies that entertain us and get us to laugh.  Revenge of the Bridesmaids meets both of our goals.  There is romance and the film is funny so we were entertained.In the story, four girls become friends as children and remain together throughout school and into their lives as young adults.  One on the four, Caitlin, has always enforced her will upon the others (Rachel, Abigail, and Parker), and lorded over the others because of her wealth and social position.  Eventually she steals Rachael's  boyfriend and decides to marry him.Caitlin asks the other three to be her bridesmaids and they reluctantly agree.  Then Abigail decides that Caitlin is really after Rachael's boyfriend for his money and that they should expose Caitlin.  The fun begins.  The battle to expose Caitlin provides  a lot of funny scenes.The DVD does not have any ""extras"", including closed caption for the hearing impaired.  The producers did not mention this lack of service so the buyer gets a second class product for first class prices.Decades ago actors were trained how to enunciate so that the audience could  understand dialogue.  Recently many actors lack this skill, and, as a result, even with volume near maximum, it is tough to understand dialogue.  Close captions correct that problem.This is a good movie.
