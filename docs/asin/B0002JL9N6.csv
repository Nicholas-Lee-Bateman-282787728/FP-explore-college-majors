After watching it I went for a long hike alone and looked at shapes made by water, wind and rock. Godlsworthy seems born with an eye for the miraculous and I felt perhaps this is something that can be learned. Something about watching his creative process unfold leaves one breathless, but also more alive than before, and eager to see and do what one can to be connected with the Earth as much as Goldsworthy is.

His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland.",4,Engaging portrait of a remarkable artist,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,863,"['very', 'engaging', 'documentary', 'Scottish', 'artist', 'Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'work', 'mostly', 'ephemeral', 'sculptures', 'made', 'elements', 'nature', 'work', 'made', 'rocks', 'leaves', 'grass', 'ice', 'etc.', 'blown', 'away', 'when', 'tide', 'beach', 'wind', 'field', 'Thus', 'most', 'Goldsworthy', 'works', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'last', 'photos', 'films', 'what', 'were', 'Now', 'one', 'can', 'argue', 'Goldsworthy', 'works', 'are', 'reflection', 'mortality', 'words', 'effect', ""n't"", 'easier', 'say', 'what', 'just', 'beautiful', 'art', 'time', 'when', 'stereotype', 'artists', 'are', 'mostly', 'bitter', 'pretentious', 'often', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'decrepit', 'urban', 'settings', 'Goldsworthy', 'be', 'opposite', 'stable', 'unpretentious', 'family', 'oriented', 'person', 'who', 'nature', 'small', 'village', 'Scotland']",Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers & Tides

837815,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0002JL9N6,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 4]","As the jacket proclaims, this film is ""Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited,"" and, yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful.  The timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from Goldsworthy's hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity.And so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in--or in the words of Matthew Arnold from ""Dover Beach"":Listen! you hear the grating roarOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,At their return, up the high strand,Begin, and cease, and then again begin,With tremulous cadence slow, and bringThe eternal note of sadness in.At one point near the end of the film Goldsworthy says that ""Words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more.""  As a wordsmith myself I take no offense and not for a moment do I think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates, is indeed something more than mere words can say.At another point he remarks on ""What is here to stay...and what isn't.""  That is his theme.I think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral.  The idea was, that by emphasizing how short-lived are even the mightiest works of humans, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed.Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression.  He painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it, or places it in the river where it will be swept away; and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality.Both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it.  And it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural.  Thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that Goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity, but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along.This is art as art should be, akin to the spiritual.In a sense Goldsworthy's work is an inarticulated understanding.  It is an experience purely of time and form.  In a sense his work ""answers"" Shelley's famous poem ""Ozymandias"" by saying, even as the tide washes the work away, and even as the river dissipates the expression, even so the art lives on because of our experience of it.  Similarly one thinks of Tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out, and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished, they are given to the wind, so that we might know that all is flux.Yet, in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos.  Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer (of necessity I would say) and all his works, even the unsuccessful ones, he tells us, are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not.This cinematic production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by Fred Frith is not to be missed.  It is one of the most beautiful documentaries that I have ever seen and one of the most spiritual.",5,The timeless and the ephemeral,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",2006,3625,"['jacket', 'film', 'Gorgeously', 'shot', 'masterfully', 'edited', 'yes', 'mesmerizingly', 'beautiful', 'timelessness', 'perceive', 'stoic', 'rock', 'unceasing', 'ebb', 'flow', 'water', 'ephemeral', 'works', 'Goldsworthy', 'hands', 'so', 'very', 'ephemeralness', 'point', 'eternity.And', 'so', 'beauty', 'compositions', 'haunt', 'just', 'touch', 'melancholy', 'woven', 'words', 'Matthew', 'Arnold', 'Dover', 'Beach', 'Listen', 'hear', 'grating', 'roarOf', 'pebbles', 'waves', 'draw', 'back', 'fling', 'return', 'high', 'strand', 'Begin', 'cease', 'then', 'again', 'begin', 'tremulous', 'cadence', 'slow', 'bringThe', 'eternal', 'note', 'sadness', 'in.At', 'one', 'point', 'end', 'film', 'Goldsworthy', 'Words', 'do', 'job', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', 'here', 'lot', 'more', 'wordsmith', 'take', 'offense', 'not', 'moment', 'do', 'think', 'immodest', 'combination', 'form', 'time', 'change', 'texture', 'color', 'composition', 'Goldsworthy', 'painstakingly', 'intuitively', 'creates', 'indeed', 'something', 'more', 'mere', 'words', 'can', 'say.At', 'point', 'remarks', 'What', 'here', 'stay', 'what', ""n't"", 'theme.I', 'think', 'artists', 'sometime', 'twentieth', 'century', 'became', 'acutely', 'aware', 'how', 'ephemeral', 'even', 'greatest', 'works', 'art', 'are', 'compared', 'vast', 'expanse', 'cosmic', 'time', 'began', 'reflect', 'understanding', 'composing', 'works', 'were', 'deliberately', 'ephemeral', 'idea', 'was', 'emphasizing', 'how', 'short-lived', 'are', 'even', 'mightiest', 'works', 'humans', 'sense', 'timelessness', 'art', 'would', 'be', 'expressed.Perhaps', 'part', 'effectiveness', 'Goldsworthy', 'work', 'sort', 'expression', 'painstakingly', 'form', 'straw', 'where', 'tide', 'will', 'reach', 'places', 'river', 'where', 'will', 'be', 'swept', 'away', 'process', 'merged', 'composition', 'transitory', 'timeless', 'are', 'necessary', 'understand', 'world', 'place', 'important', 'works', 'be', 'done', 'context', 'nature', 'what', 'composed', 'set', 'what', 'natural', 'Thus', 'walls', 'stone', 'eggs', 'stone', 'Goldsworthy', 'constructs', 'are', 'silent', 'solid', 'yet', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'monuments', 'eternity', 'instead', 'will', 'stay', 'undefined', 'length', 'time', 'then', 'dissipate', 'return', 'state', 'much', 'existed', 'came', 'along.This', 'art', 'art', 'should', 'be', 'akin', 'spiritual.In', 'sense', 'Goldsworthy', 'work', 'inarticulated', 'understanding', 'experience', 'purely', 'time', 'form', 'sense', 'work', 'answers', 'Shelley', 'famous', 'poem', 'Ozymandias', 'saying', 'even', 'tide', 'work', 'away', 'even', 'river', 'expression', 'even', 'art', 'experience', 'Similarly', 'one', 'thinks', 'Tibetan', 'sand', 'paintings', 'so', 'carefully', 'composed', 'measured', 'out', 'then', 'just', 'are', 'so', 'beautifully', 'preciously', 'finished', 'are', 'given', 'wind', 'might', 'know', 'flux.Yet', 'modern', 'world', 'works', 'art', 'endure', 'photos', 'videos', 'Goldsworthy', 'accomplished', 'photographer', 'necessity', 'would', 'say', 'works', 'even', 'unsuccessful', 'ones', 'are', 'photographed', 'so', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'more', 'reflective', 'mood', 'see', 'what', 'accomplished', 'what', 'not.This', 'cinematic', 'production', 'directed', 'Thomas', 'Riedelsheimer', 'beautiful', 'appropriately', 'haunting', 'music', 'Fred', 'Frith', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'documentaries', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'most', 'spiritual']",Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers & Tides

Although he seems inclined to be a recluse, he is also very articulate about his art, and his narration adds much to the film.

I have just returned from a 1,000-mile motorcycle trip, alone, to see the Goldsworthy exhibit at Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan. There are pieces by Andy Goldsworthy there that will make you weep for beauty.This film communicates none of the beauty of Goldsworthy's work. Rather, it communicates just enough of it to tantalize... and leaves out enough to irritate.The film maker is so caught up in ""creating"" something himself, he forgets that he is making a documentary. We get to see footage of Goldsworthy working -- but we never get to see what he is working on. The film is presented as if shot in letterbox format and cropped to 4:3 aspect ratio. The parts that would seem to give meaning to what you are seeing always seem to be just out of frame.Tightly cropped shots of Goldsworthy's pieces fail to convey the context within which they have meaning. Flat, oblique shots of the pieces fail to communicate their shape. We are given images of Andy Goldsworthy looking at a piece he is working on, and talking about it, but we never get to see the piece itself. We are given shots of Goldsworthy carefully placing rocks, but we never get to see the pattern or shape he is creating with them.There is a scene showing Goldsworthy talking about an ice sculpture he has just assembled; we get to see the pebble-covered beach where this takes place; Goldsworthy, himself, is just out of frame to the right; the piece in question is just out of frame to the left. We see just enough of it to know that the rising sun is illuminating the ice, and we get to hear Andy talking about how he hadn't known that the sun would illuminate both side of the piece -- but we don't get to see both sides of the piece. The result is frustrating and, in the end, pointless.This documentary is NOT ""masterfully edited""; it is butchered. In the end, all it presents is the ego of the film maker. In addition, the music is often strident and distracting, and seems to have little to do with what is going on.To its credit: There are a few scenes where the point of Goldworthy's work and its innate beauty cannot quite be obscured by this film's search for technique. There are scenes showing Goldsworthy assembling pieces, in which we get to see how difficult his task is. Unfortunately, the lesson is wasted, because we don't get to see the piece, itself, or we only get to see it without size references or locale; we don't get to see why Goldsworthy took on the difficult task in the first place.If you have ever seen well-documented instances of Goldsworthy's ephemera, you will be disappointed by this film. If you don't already know about Goldsworthy's work, you will not gain an understanding of it or an appreciation of it from this film; the work is not present in this film.What you might gain is a chance to hear Goldsworthy talking candidly about his work; and you will gain an appreciation of the hardships he endures to create these beautiful, ephemeral pieces.But the thing that you will be most interested in will always be just outside the frame of this self-consciously pretentious piece of documentation that fails, utterly, to document.",1,Goldsworthy is not in this one,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3186,"['am', 'familiar', 'Goldsworthy', 'work', 'have', 'just', 'returned', '1,000-mile', 'motorcycle', 'trip', 'alone', 'see', 'Goldsworthy', 'exhibit', 'Meijer', 'Gardens', 'Grand', 'Rapids', 'Michigan', 'are', 'pieces', 'Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'will', 'make', 'weep', 'beauty.This', 'film', 'none', 'beauty', 'Goldsworthy', 'work', 'Rather', 'just', 'enough', 'tantalize', 'out', 'enough', 'irritate.The', 'film', 'maker', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'creating', 'something', 'making', 'documentary', 'get', 'see', 'footage', 'Goldsworthy', 'working', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'working', 'film', 'presented', 'shot', 'letterbox', 'format', 'cropped', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'parts', 'would', 'seem', 'give', 'meaning', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'frame.Tightly', 'cropped', 'shots', 'Goldsworthy', 'pieces', 'fail', 'convey', 'context', 'have', 'meaning', 'Flat', 'oblique', 'shots', 'pieces', 'fail', 'communicate', 'shape', 'are', 'given', 'images', 'Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'looking', 'piece', 'working', 'talking', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'piece', 'are', 'given', 'shots', 'Goldsworthy', 'carefully', 'placing', 'rocks', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'pattern', 'shape', 'creating', 'scene', 'showing', 'Goldsworthy', 'talking', 'ice', 'sculpture', 'just', 'assembled', 'get', 'see', 'pebble-covered', 'beach', 'where', 'place', 'Goldsworthy', 'just', 'frame', 'right', 'piece', 'question', 'just', 'frame', 'left', 'see', 'just', 'enough', 'know', 'rising', 'sun', 'illuminating', 'ice', 'get', 'hear', 'Andy', 'talking', 'how', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'sun', 'would', 'illuminate', 'side', 'piece', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'sides', 'piece', 'result', 'frustrating', 'end', 'pointless.This', 'documentary', 'NOT', 'masterfully', 'edited', 'butchered', 'end', 'ego', 'film', 'maker', 'addition', 'music', 'often', 'strident', 'distracting', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'what', 'going', 'credit', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'point', 'Goldworthy', 'work', 'innate', 'beauty', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'be', 'obscured', 'film', 'search', 'technique', 'are', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Goldsworthy', 'assembling', 'pieces', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'difficult', 'task', 'Unfortunately', 'lesson', 'wasted', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'piece', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'size', 'references', 'locale', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'why', 'Goldsworthy', 'took', 'difficult', 'task', 'first', 'place.If', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'well-documented', 'instances', 'Goldsworthy', 'ephemera', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Goldsworthy', 'work', 'will', 'not', 'gain', 'understanding', 'appreciation', 'film', 'work', 'not', 'present', 'film.What', 'might', 'gain', 'chance', 'hear', 'Goldsworthy', 'talking', 'candidly', 'work', 'will', 'gain', 'appreciation', 'hardships', 'create', 'beautiful', 'ephemeral', 'pieces.But', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'interested', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'just', 'frame', 'self-consciously', 'pretentious', 'piece', 'documentation', 'utterly', 'document']",Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers & Tides

The ecstasy of the sunrise lighting up stone icicles is matched by the bittersweet destruction of compositions by rivers, wind, gravity and time. rhythm permeates everything Andy does - the rhythm of change, the eternal clockwork of the tides, 'fire' created by the root's contact with the earth and seen in the blackened stem of the Scottish fern... Rhythm, and its intimate and integral partner, the chaotic decomposition into primordial elements. Destruction is an integral part of a Goldsworthy composition.In this era when the relationship between the teacher & student, master & disciple, celebrity & awestruck peons is formalized and tends to be permeated by the deeply human notion of status and gain, Goldsworthy embodies its equally human antipode by living his life at the interface between solid & liquid, deeply profound & whimsical, village & countryside, life and death. The lack of pretentiousness in this film is, to a jaded cayote, breathtaking, humbling and ever so inspiring. i could watch and watch his band-aided fingers stick an icicle on another, a stone on a rock, a stick onto its counterpart.just as Andy mediates his narrative by working with the elements, the filmmaker and composer contribute a sublime counterpoint with a sensitivity that is in every sense an equivalent to that of the primary creator. The filming has its own cadence and the music follows it, sometimes engulfing it, other times retreating. Just like a river. Or perhaps a tide.

837825,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0002JL9N6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","Lovers of art world documentaries should be thrilled that the classic ""Andy Goldsworthy:  Rivers and Tides, Working with Time"" (catchy title, huh?) is finally making its Blu-ray debut.  As this film has been on the DVD market for years, I will comment first on the details of the newest Blu-ray release before commenting on the actual film.  That way, you're free to completely ignore me after checking out the latest specs!  First, the bottom line--if you already own this on DVD, I'm not sure that it warrants a repurchase.  If, however, you're picking it up new--it's an easy recommendation.Special features/Blu-Ray transfer:  The new release maintains several of the original single disc DVD features including 7 short films that are essential to any fan of Goldsworthy's work.  New are another short film chronicling an event where 7 enormous manufactured snowballs were left in downtown London to melt away to reveal surprises as well as a 45 minute interview with documentarian Thomas Riedelsheimer about his year filming Goldsworthy.  (I should note that if you picked up the Two-Disc Collector's edition a few years ago, however, these are already included there). The short film is interesting and it's certainly an intriguing concept--but the interview will probably be best appreciated by only the heartiest of fans.  The film boasts a new high-definition transfer supervised by the director and, in truth, this is what I was most excited about.  A common complaint about the original DVD was the dismal transfer.  To view Goldsworthy's creations in glorious clarity is a real selling point--but, while considerably better, it's not the huge difference in viewing experiences I was expecting.  The images still seem to lack precision and the color seems a bit muted.The film itself documents the works of naturalist artist Andy Goldsworthy.  His works represents a unique and fascinating manipulation of natural elements to form manmade art.  Working outside, his constructions can be either extremely tenuous (ice sculpture that melts, rock or stick sculpture taken by the tide or wind) or strikingly resilient (rock pinecone sculptures that become part of the landscape).  The film delves into the artistic process and showcases mind blowing successes such as an enormous winding rock wall and heartbreaking set-backs as his work is destroyed before it can even be finished.  Goldsworthy is influenced mostly by the patterns inherent in waters, tides, and waves and that influence is seen in much of the work exhibited in the documentary.  My favorite sequences within ""Rivers and Tides"" come with time lapse photography that show how the work is either obliterated by or forges with nature.If you have an interest in either art or nature, this should be right up your alley.  You'll think that much Goldsworthy's work was created naturally--or that it should have been!  The film is very methodically paced, however, so if you're a short attention span viewer--realize there is much quiet inherent in the artistic process.  But still don't let that dissuade you--this has to be one of the most unique artists at work.

Mr. Goldsworthy has a deep need for communing with the natural landscape and seeks to rearrange rocks, ice, wood, snow, leaves, vines, flowers, moss, straw and clay in order to ""touch the heart of the place"".  Indeed, the birth of a particular sculpture is often part of an active natural process that is taking place at each location: ""The very thing that brings the work to life, is the thing that will have a hand in its death or dissolution"".Andy Goldsworthy's works generally have the quality of being ephemeral and are primarily created within remote natural settings.  Therefore the artist's own efforts to document the short life of each work, through photography, have historically been the way that these works come to be seen by the public in a gallery or museum setting.  With ""Rivers and Tides"", director Thomas Riedelsheimer assumes this task of visual documentation.  The subtitle of the documentary, ""Working With Time"", explores how the effects of the rising and falling of the ocean's tides, the flow of water in rivers and streams, plant growth through the seasons and even the movement of farm animals, all influence and interact with the artist's work.  The documentary medium of video now makes this fascinating study of time possible.A wide range of Andy Goldsworthy's completed works are filmed, many being created specifically for this program.  The work was made throughout a number of different cycles of the seasons and in at least four major locations: Nova Scotia, Canada; Penpont, Scotland; Storm King, New York and Digne, France.  The ninety-minute documentary presents Mr. Goldsworthy as the sole narrator of his creative process.  The artist is shown scouting locations, gathering materials and using mostly his own hands to create works featuring incredible juxtapositions of physical form and color.Composer and musician Fred Frith provides subtle sonic accents to this visual focus at interesting occasions within an otherwise partly silent journey.  Frith's haunting score is thoroughly integrated with the visual beauty and almost fanatical range of perspective in Mr. Riedelsheimer's documentary cinematography.""Andy Goldsworthy: Rivers and Tides"" can be recommended, with confidence, to those with an interest in a holistic approach to contemporary art.",5,The Art Process as a Form of Nourishment,1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,2469,"['serene', 'portrait', 'art', 'philosophy', 'sculptor', 'Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'viewers', 'consider', 'current', 'relationship', 'evolving', 'natural', 'world', 'Mr.', 'Goldsworthy', 'deep', 'need', 'communing', 'natural', 'landscape', 'rearrange', 'rocks', 'ice', 'wood', 'snow', 'vines', 'flowers', 'moss', 'straw', 'clay', 'order', 'touch', 'heart', 'place', 'Indeed', 'birth', 'particular', 'sculpture', 'often', 'part', 'active', 'natural', 'process', 'taking', 'place', 'location', 'very', 'thing', 'work', 'life', 'thing', 'will', 'have', 'hand', 'death', 'dissolution', '.Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'works', 'generally', 'have', 'quality', 'being', 'ephemeral', 'are', 'primarily', 'created', 'remote', 'natural', 'settings', 'artist', 'own', 'efforts', 'document', 'short', 'life', 'work', 'photography', 'have', 'historically', 'been', 'way', 'come', 'be', 'seen', 'public', 'gallery', 'museum', 'setting', 'Rivers', 'Tides', 'director', 'Thomas', 'Riedelsheimer', 'task', 'visual', 'documentation', 'subtitle', 'documentary', 'Working', 'Time', 'how', 'effects', 'rising', 'falling', 'ocean', 'tides', 'flow', 'water', 'rivers', 'streams', 'plant', 'growth', 'seasons', 'even', 'movement', 'farm', 'animals', 'influence', 'interact', 'artist', 'work', 'documentary', 'medium', 'video', 'now', 'fascinating', 'study', 'time', 'possible.A', 'wide', 'range', 'Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'completed', 'works', 'are', 'filmed', 'many', 'being', 'created', 'specifically', 'program', 'work', 'was', 'made', 'number', 'different', 'cycles', 'seasons', 'least', 'four', 'major', 'locations', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'Canada', 'Penpont', 'Scotland', 'Storm', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'Digne', 'France', 'ninety-minute', 'documentary', 'presents', 'Mr.', 'Goldsworthy', 'sole', 'narrator', 'creative', 'process', 'artist', 'shown', 'scouting', 'locations', 'gathering', 'materials', 'using', 'mostly', 'own', 'hands', 'create', 'works', 'featuring', 'incredible', 'juxtapositions', 'physical', 'form', 'color.Composer', 'musician', 'Fred', 'Frith', 'subtle', 'sonic', 'accents', 'visual', 'focus', 'interesting', 'occasions', 'otherwise', 'partly', 'silent', 'journey', 'Frith', 'haunting', 'score', 'thoroughly', 'integrated', 'visual', 'beauty', 'almost', 'fanatical', 'range', 'perspective', 'Mr.', 'Riedelsheimer', 'documentary', 'cinematography', 'Andy', 'Goldsworthy', 'Rivers', 'Tides', 'can', 'be', 'recommended', 'confidence', 'interest', 'holistic', 'approach', 'contemporary', 'art']",Andy Goldsworthy's Rivers & Tides

Upon hearing this, you kind of have to ask yourself what kind of mutter would do such a thing. Thomas Riedelsheimer aims to show you.Rivers and Tides has the rather interesting distinction of having won every award for which it was nominated (there were seven, if you're keeping count), and it's pretty easy to see why. Not only is Goldsworthy himself quite charismatic (and, yes, more than a bit eccentric, which can only help in a documentary), but Riedelsheimer is a fantastic camerman. There's never a situation where you feel Riedelsheimer is overtly tugging at you-- this may have something to do with the organic nature of the things he's filming-- but despite the (rather odd, for a documentary) feeling of straightforward camerawork, it's impossible to dismiss the beautifully composed nature of some of the images. Granted, this is a film about composition, and much of it can be attributed to Goldsworthy; Riedelsheimer is, after all, filming Goldsworthy much of the time during the process of creation. But, for example, Riedelsheimer's lingering shot of the ice snake sculpture towards the beginning of the film; it's obvious no one set up the sun. It's as if Riedelsheimer took a few steps back, two or three to the left, saw what was going on, and then snapped camera to shoulder and started filming.A gorgeous piece of work, which deserves a whole lot more exposure than it's gotten.

837830,A255E1L105V4MU,B0002JL9N6,Robert Carlberg,"[2, 2]","Andy Goldsworthy creates art that a 5-year old can understand, stacking rocks, arranging leaves, piling sticks, drawing in the snow.  His ""work"" (as he keeps calling it) is simple in concept, but maybe not so simple to execute as well as he does.And that is both the strength of it, and its downfall.  The simplicity is unpretentious and pure in a way that art very rarely is, these days.  At the same time it is fun and silly and unsophisticated in a way that makes Andy's serious pronouncements about ""his work"" and ""my art"" sound like a 5-year old kid who never got his parents' approval.  The fact that he spends so much energy building contructs of such fragile beauty, which are almost always blown away by the wind or tides until nothing remains -- and the fact that he gets so agitated when the inevitable collapse occurs -- make you wonder after his sanity.  Why does he torture himself so, what drives him to such Sisyphean frustration?The film, by Thomas Reidelsheimer, deserves five stars for the languid portrait it paints of the hunger artist.  Like his following film Touch The Sound, it is a masterful exploration of a driven personality, one which manages to both illuminate -- and puzzle over -- the subject artist.
