It just completely stuffed up all the good work done before it.What made the early stages good, was that the werewolves were blending into the shadows, and all you could hear was growling.  but the fright factor vanishes once you see them.A terrible piece of poo!

719486,AJWMVSLEVJ1UP,B00006L91H,Alan W. Petrucelli,"[2, 4]","The future of the horror film is safe in the hands of Neil Marshall, if we are to judge by ""Dog Soldiers."" Marshall is both the writer and director of this small, yet powerful, fright flick --- guaranteed to shorten your breathe, accelerate your heartbeat and scare the hell out of you! And since this is Marshall's debut, we suggest you quickly fasten your seat belts ... it's gonna be a scary career! A very scary career. The plot --- a platoon of soldiers play war games that go terribly wrong ---  is only a frame that offers homage and respect to a host of other films from yesteryear. From the humans-trapped-inside-while-non-humans-attack-from-outside style of ""The Night of The Living Dead"" (among others) to the safe/neutral exterior as seen from an inside doorway (think John Ford), there are more quotes, lifts and references to other movies than a Bogdonovitch essay. But even without this inside joke sort of filmmaking, ""Dog Soldiers"" remains tight, well written, even witty. Best of all, it grabs the audience right from the beginning, and doesn't let go until the end. There is not a scene, character or event that's wildly original here, yet the movie is engaging and a hoot to watch. This is a horror movie, sometimes disguised as a buddy film, sometimes disguised as a sci-fi fantasy, sometimes disguised as war/action flick, butit's really a rip-snortin', edge-of-your-seat, old-fashioned movie theater horror gem that makes you yearn for flat Coke, stale popcorn, a cartoon and previews of coming attraction, Two paws up!

I was a bit disappointed by Dog Soldiers. It is a good B-movie, but not much more.Acting is somewhat better than in your average horror, and characters are overall smarter than your average idiotic teenagers in horrors, but special effects are definitely third-rate, and mostly limited to big fake werewolves heads, fake hands and arms smashed against doors trying to sneak in, and masses of blood and organs splattered around cars and rooms. Also, not very scary overall. So, if you are into werewolves, or if you are looking for a decent B-movie to watch, this may do, but don't expect anything even remotely as good as Alien or The Thing.Finally, as others have mentioned, the quality of the DVD is fairly poor, and there are no English subtitles.

Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[4, 4]","In a world where there just aren't enough good old-fashioned werewolf flicks around, this little entry from Neil Marshall acquits itself as one of the true standouts.I first saw this on the Sci-Fi channel a couple of years ago, and I absolutely loved it, so finally being able to see it in it's unedited form on DVD was a joy.From the opening sequence, it's obviously a werewolf film; however, it's setting and clever, witty writing set it apart from so many others; only 'The Howling' and 'An American Werewolf in London', in my opinion, share such depth and enjoyment in their composure. Comparisons to both 'Predator' and 'Aliens' are accurate in a lot of respects, but this film was by far original enough to stand alone without being a rip off of either of those movies.For an independent film, it's production values are stellar, as is the acting. I spent a good bit of time around British soldiers in the Gulf War, and watching this film was like being back there again, and each of the actors played his part efficiently and convincingly. Sean Pertwee, as always, performed his role to the hilt, completely believable in both his command capacity and his compassion for those under his command; Kevin McKidd was perfect in the part of the killing machine with a conscience; Liam Cunningham was both sophisticated and suitably grimy as the secretive black-ops commander; and the rest of the ensemble cast played off of each other remarkably well. As a veteran, I can tell you that it was an accurate portrayal of a combat unit under duress.Add to all of this wonderful practical special effects (the werewolves are some of the scariest I've seen, and the gore is plentiful without being ridiculous), smart, snappy dialogue that pays homage to a great deal of pop culture, and the foreboding, misty forests of Scotland, and you have a werewolf feature that should impress anyone.The particular release that I purchased has no special features whatsoever, but for a low-budget outing it has very good picture and sound, albeit a little grainy in both areas.Highly recommended to fans of werewolves, 'last-stand' pictures, and horror films in general, particularly of the independent variety.",5,"""Up until today you believed there was a line between myth and reality...""",1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,2196,"['world', 'where', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'werewolf', 'flicks', 'around', 'little', 'entry', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'one', 'true', 'standouts.I', 'first', 'saw', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'so', 'finally', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'unedited', 'form', 'DVD', 'was', 'joy.From', 'opening', 'sequence', 'obviously', 'werewolf', 'film', 'however', 'setting', 'clever', 'witty', 'writing', 'set', 'apart', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'only', 'Howling', ""'An"", 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'opinion', 'share', 'such', 'depth', 'enjoyment', 'composure', 'Comparisons', ""'Predator"", ""'Aliens"", 'are', 'accurate', 'lot', 'respects', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'original', 'enough', 'stand', 'alone', 'being', 'rip', 'movies.For', 'independent', 'film', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'stellar', 'acting', 'spent', 'good', 'bit', 'time', 'British', 'soldiers', 'Gulf', 'War', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'back', 'there', 'again', 'actors', 'played', 'part', 'efficiently', 'convincingly', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'always', 'performed', 'role', 'hilt', 'completely', 'believable', 'command', 'capacity', 'compassion', 'command', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'killing', 'machine', 'conscience', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'was', 'sophisticated', 'suitably', 'grimy', 'secretive', 'black-ops', 'commander', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'played', 'other', 'remarkably', 'well', 'veteran', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'combat', 'unit', 'duress.Add', 'wonderful', 'practical', 'special', 'effects', 'werewolves', 'are', 'scariest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'gore', 'plentiful', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'smart', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'homage', 'great', 'deal', 'pop', 'culture', 'foreboding', 'misty', 'forests', 'Scotland', 'have', 'werewolf', 'feature', 'should', 'impress', 'particular', 'release', 'purchased', 'special', 'features', 'whatsoever', 'low-budget', 'outing', 'very', 'good', 'picture', 'sound', 'little', 'grainy', 'areas.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'werewolves', ""'last-stand"", 'pictures', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'particularly', 'independent', 'variety']",N/A

But occasionally some director makes something that deserves to be watched and liked. And I have to say that more and more of these movies now are not born in Hollywood but across the Atlantics. European horror gets strength particularly in Britain. Of the latest ones ""28 Days Later"" and ""Dog Soldiers"" come to mind first. At first glance there's nothing original in ""Dog Soldiers"" - a typical werewolf tale. But it's just at the first glance. Here a squad of british soldiers during the maneuvers is being attacked by werewolves and has to hide and hold defence in a small cabin amidst forests of Scotland.The movie is very sinister, the atmosphere of the dark woods is obscure and disturbing, werewolves themselves are very well done - they are really frightening and unpleasant. But one of the main things I liked about ""Dog Soldiers"" is that the characters don't behave stupid, their actions are not like in many other horror films when you want to scream: ""Don't do it, fool! Don't go there alone! You all have to stay together!"" and so on. Here all are doing the right thing and don't act stupid or strange.

719495,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00006L91H,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[21, 27]","Once upon a time, in the days before CGI, a director might depend on the talents of costume designers and special effects to create the illusion of monsters in our midst.  This art became scarce in the Nineties.  Now, even B movie makers have access to computer animation that would rival anything seen in the original Jurassic Park.  So it is a rare film indeed that is so...low-budget, that it might resort to costumes and quick camera editing angles to present us with convincing werewolves.Soldier Dogs has a grand old tradition behind it.  Borrowing a werewolf look that hit its heyday with the Howling movies and a plot recalling Aliens, this film screams ""B Movie"".  But it is a kind of B movie at its best, in which we can enjoy the storytelling and the delicious scares lurking around the corner.  True to modern films, however, there is a little morality subplot in which we are forced to confront these monsters as people who never wanted their lives as murderers but cannot control their baser compulsions.  I think this makes for a stronger tension between the humans' desire to survive themselves and the irony of having to slaughter the werewolves to do so.If you are not so jaded that you cannot enjoy the occasional B movie, Soldier Dogs is a worthwhile two hours of  your evening in front of the TV.-Andrea, aka Merribelle.",4,"Good, wholesome horror film.

719496,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B00006L91H,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[16, 17]","Werewolf films have always gotten the short-stick when it came to quality product. Vampires have always gotten the glamour and choice stories to be told on film. Sure there's been some great werewolf films like An American Werewolf In London, The Howling and Wolfen, but more often than not most modern werewolf films try to copy the early Wolfman of the 1940's Universal horror days. I'm very happy to say that Neil Marshall, an up-and-coming director from across the pond, has taken the premise of the werewolf tale and seemlessly blended it with the action conventions of such action-horror films like Aliens and Assault on Precinct 13. He even manages to mix in the tried-and-true themes of the siege action war films like Zulu and The Alamo.Dog Soldiers is pretty much a straight-up action-horror film with a simple and tight plot of a group of British soldiers out on an exercise in the Scottish Highlands where they soon run across a pack of werewolves. These soldiers are only part of a much larger covert mission conducted by the special operations department of the British military which seem to think that some sort of creature lives in the Highlands which they want to capture and experiment on. It is safe to assume that neither group has their plans go according to how they've planned them. It doesn't take the film too long before both groups have been whittled down to a few survivors by the werewolf pack and must seek refuge in an out of the way countryside cottage. With the help of a young anthropologist, who happen to be driving by the deserted country road when the group flees from the werewolves, Dog Soldiers suddenly turn from a your typical werewolf film and into a siege reminiscent of such classics as Night of the Living Dead, Aliens and Zulu. The rest of the film is a race against the clock as the werewolves outside slowly, but gradually probe the defenses of the remaining survivors until the climactic final reel where secrets between between some of the survivors are revealed to show that the situation the soldiers have been put in were not accidental. The final half hour of Dog Soldiers is as action packed as the last half hour of Aliens.Neil Marshall's simple, yet tight directing and pacing of the film was helped considerably by the fine ensemble cast of British actors. There's some fine performances from Kevin McKidd as the cool-headed Pvt. Cooper who shares abit of history with the secretive and aloof covert operator Capt. Ryan (played by Liam Cunningham). In fact, I would say that McKidd's performance as Cooper holds the film together and keeps it from sliding into camp. It's a shame that he hasn't done more work in Hollywood and when he has it's been good performances like his performance as the English sergeant in Kingdom of Heaven. Hopefully, his role as Lucius Vorenus in HBO's drama series Rome will finally get him the recognition he deserves. The rest of the cast does a fine job with Sean Pertwee as the Sgt. Wells being a sort of father figure for the young soldiers in the squad. Emma Cleasby rounds out the British ensemble cast as the young anthropologist Megan who comes across the fleeing soldiers on the country road and takes them to the only defensible shelter in the vicinity. Her character does a good job of gradually letting out the nature of the danger they're all in. But any talk of the performances in Dog Soldiers will not be complete if I didn't mention Darren Morfitt's gung-ho and manic performance as Pvt. Spoon. His Spoon portrayal is abit like Bill Paxton's role as Hudson in Aliens, but minus the early bout of panic and cowardice. Spoon revels in the situation he and his squad mates have been put in. He sees it as the ultimate test of British military skill and nerves against insurmountable odds. He even mentions the Battle at Roarke's Drift to make a point to a squad mate. This is ironic since that battle was the setting for the classic siege war film Zulu which Dog Soldiers pays homage to.The effects work in Dog Soldiers was very well done for a film that had a budget less than the FX budget of most Hollywood blockbuster projects. Some people have pointed out that the werewolves either looked like men wearing a furry suit and/or furry-looking puppets. This is further from the truth. The look of the werewolves were pretty simple and with the budget Marshall and his crew had to work with they looked pretty convincing. Neil Marshall also seemed to have taken Spielberg's rule of showing less is more approach. We really don't see the werewolves in full until the final twenty minutes or so. By then the film has already hooked and reeled in its audience into suspending their disbelief and just enjoying the film. Dog Soldiers also contains quite abit of gore-laden scenes that were very well done. Limbs and heads ripped from bodies abound in this film. Stomachs are gutted with entrails spilling out. There's even a nice scene of the werewolves feeding on the remains of one of their kills that most past werewolf films don't show on-screen. Marshall seem to have figured out that gore and scary moments can be in the same film instead of just one or the other.2002's Dog Soldiers was a very small film, but it was one of the first first of the last couple years that has brought back balls-to-the-wall horror, action and gore back into the horror genre. Before Dog Soldiers most horror films have sunk to the PG-13 soft horror or the cynical, self-referential films like Scream. What Neil Marshall and company have done with Dog Soldiers was to make horror the way it should be: a hard rated-R thrill-ride that takes its audience by the neck and doesn't let go. Gorehounds and fans of horror and action films should rejoice in the finished product that is Dog Soldiers. They should also be glad to know that Neil Marshall is one director who understands what makes a great horror film. I for one can't wait for what he intends to do next.",5,Neil Marshall does a wonderful job in creating a kickass action-horror,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,5950,"['Werewolf', 'films', 'have',

Once the action started, I didn't care what happened to the soldiers, survivors, or the werewolves.  The director was very cheap.  When a charcter was about to turn into a werewolf, you only saw their yellow eyes and fang: no transformation effect such as ""American Werewolf in London"" or ""The Howling.""  When the platoon was fighting, the scenes were too dark (maybe the director's way of hiding the cheap effects), and anytime they were near the window...too obvious what was going to happen.

In the movie ""Howling"" a couple finds a town of werewolves and it's to late by the time they find out. Here instead of a town, the soldiers find a family of them in the woods. What's worse is the soldiers have taken up shelter in their house. This is one of the best werewolve movies I have seen. If you enjoy horror be sure to catch this one.

Produced by Christopher Figg (of Hellraiser fame), this is the best werewolf movie I have seen since the days of American Werewolf in London and The Howling. A British-based film that aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, the movie involves a band of soldiers practicing war games in the Scottish wilderness, only to come across a special ops agent and what remains of his team and camp. What follows is a brilliant piece of moviemaking that pits the soldiers against werewolves peppered with great acting, excellent one-liners and plot twists that will have you guessing throughout the film. It's definitely a ""kick-butt"" kind of film with non-stop action that had 300 people in the theater on the edge of their seats and howling for more. And if you like gore, there's plenty to go around.Most of the cast is relatively unknowns, although viewers may recognize Sean Pertwee, who played in such films as Soldier and Event Horizon.

A British military training mission turns deadly when the soldiers come face to face with an unexpected pack of werewolves in the forest. The creatures are hidden throughout the majority of the film, only showing glimpses of the beasts as they dart between trees while they rapidly stalk their prey. The forest setting makes for beautiful atmosphere, punctuated by blue filters and fog effects. The latter half of the film follows the typical NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD scenario, with the wolves surrounding the men in a farm house that was thought to be abandoned. The final reveal shows impressive costuming and design for the wolves, standing 7-8' tall on stilted haunches, made all the more scary and menacing through the use of low-angled shots. Marshall was able to take familiar elements from previous genre efforts and create a fast-paced werewolf film that is both unique and engaging, which is made all the more believable through the solid casting and acting.

719519,A21VGNU5959O85,B00006L91H,CaterpillarGirl,"[6, 7]","I saw Neil Marshall's film ""The Descent"" in the theatres recently and loved it, and of course I wondered what other movies this man had done. I found Dog Soldiers his ""soldier movie with werewolves, not a werewolf movie with soldiers"" Starring Sean Pertree as Sgt wells, Kevin McKidd as Cooper, Emma Cleasby as Megan and Liam Cunningham as Capt. Ryan.In a behind the scenes interview Neil explains that he wanted the creatures not to be computer generated because you get better reactions out of the actors, and the audience isn't looking at the computer effects with a ""wow that looks good/bad"" therefore taking themselves out of the story and doing it disservice. While ""the descent"" was horrifyingly gory and edge of your seat terror, this movie was more like a horror action comedy where you are just rooting for the soldiers to blow the puppies off the screen. Parts of it are bloody and visceral, some are creepy and dark, and some are just full of action and well done fight scenes. We don't get a sympathetic sideline for the creatures, but we do get awesome character development on the soldier's part, Especially for Cooper and Capt. Ryan.The location, Scotland, and the fact that they are so isolated is beautifully represented. The werewolves themselves are an amalgam of what has been done right in former werewolf movies, to me they have a strong similarity to the Lycans in Underworld and the werewolf from Stephen kings Silver Bullet. Marshall shows that he actually cares about telling a story, AND giving us plenty of eye candy and stimulation for the brain. I think the standout role had to be Sean Pertwees Sgt Wells, who was a tough but admirable and respected leader, and we get to agonize over his predicament while wanting him to survive against the odds.

The soldiers soon become bait for a perturbed pack of 8-foot, hungry, upright-walking lycanthropes defending their turf.  Believe me, these wolves are such monsters that no man has a chance of urinating any higher on a tree, much less defeating them in combat.  Dog Soldiers has some very unique and formidable warrior werewolves engaged in some serious, modern-day canine combat.Why are the werewolves called Dog Soldiers, you may ask?  Well, if their soldier-style combat tactics aren't enough, there's a rather interesting subplot of a reason why, as well.  However, I'll leave that morsel of a detail for you to discover yourself.There's even an ever-so-subtle, yet oh-so-distinct undercurrent of a Red Riding Hood/Goldilocks theme.  Maybe it's just me, maybe it's not really there, but I doubt it.  If anyone else watches this movie, let me know if you see it too.Dog Soldiers involves human and werewolf soldier combat, with a serious use of guns, explosives, and various other military tactics, weapons, etc.  There's lots of bullets flying, lots of things exploding, lots of blood, lots of entrails, carnage, and other varieties of violence and gore.  Blood and human remains literally gush from the opened doors of a car, in one scene.  There's also a tug-of-war scene between a dog and a disemboweled soldier that's really better seen than described.  I'd actually rather die than receive some of the first-aid administered in this movie.Yes, Dog Soldiers, I think, very deeply sinks its teeth, so to speak, into the theme of War/Horror, also doing so in a most unique and frightfully original way.

719526,A1YWUPCT83WY48,B00006L91H,"Claude Avary ""West Coast Reader""","[11, 11]","Usually straight-to-DVD films are junk, but there are some surprises out there, and this is one of them. A British horror/action film that was never released theatrically in the U.S., and starring faces mostly unfamiliar to American viewers, &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; is an exciting, well-written and well acted horror flick with no pretensions. It's actually a much better film than some the recent  indie horror flicks that received a lot of critical praise, like &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;Cabin Fever.&quot; For horror and action fans, you can't miss this one.&quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; is essentially a mixture of &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; and &quot;The Warriors&quot; with werewolves: a military unit finds itself trapped in a wilderness, surrounding by merciless foes -- who in this case happen to be huge two-legged wolves. The film also borrows heavily from many other movies: &quot;Alien,&quot; &quot;Aliens,&quot; &quot;Predator,&quot; &quot;The Night of the Living Dead,&quot; &quot;The Birds,&quot; &quot;Zulu&quot; (the characters even make direct mention of the film), &quot;The Balir Witch Project,&quot; and &quot;Straw Dogs.&quot;The plot follows a British squad on a training exercise in the Scottish Highlands (actually filmed in Luxembourg). The squad comes across their target, a Special Ops unit, but it has been mysteriously and viciously wiped out. The culprits are werewolves, and soon the squad and a local biologist are fighting to live through a night of the full moon in the middle of nowhere. There are a couple of nice twists in the story along the way that shift it in unexpected directions.The acting is uniformly superb, something you wouldn't expect from this kind of lower-budget horror film. Because none of the actors are big-named stars, you really have no idea who will live through to the end and who will become werewolf-chow. Kevin McKidd (from &quot;Trainspotting&quot;) and Sean Pertwee (son of one of the men who played Doctor Who) take the lead roles and do great, believable jobs as military figures under intense pressure who nonetheless rise to the occasion. The real scene-stealer is Liam Cunningham as the sole survivor of the Special Ops unit, a vile but secretive man who may be hiding something very important from the others.The visual effects, thankfully, avoid CG as much as possible. The werewolves are achieved using full-body suits and robotic heads. They don't look very convincing in longer shots, but the filmmakers cleverly keep them mostly hidden or shown in very quick shots -- which makes them much scarier. There is quite a bit of gore, although not all of the grisly effects are believable. For the most part, the horror scenes rely on fast-moving and exciting action, but there are some very good 'jump' scares and creepy, drawn-out sequences. Hard-core horror buffs and fans of military action will both find the results satisfying.The DVD contains a twenty-minute 'making of' featurette. Much of the running time is taken up with clips from the film, but there is some interesting information about the visual effects and the anti-CG philosophy behind them. The commentary is from the two producers, and had a lot of good info in it. The 5.1 sound mix is adequate; there are some juicy howling and explosions on the back speakers, but most of the sound is pushed to the front speakers and the volume is a bit low.&quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; is a real find if you want some good, old-fashioned horror movie scares and rugged violence. It's smart and well-acted, in the bargain. I hope director Neil Marshall does more films like this (maybe they'll even receive a theatrical release).",4,"A real horror movie find...scary, bloody, and well-acted",1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,3663,"['Usually', 'straight-to-DVD', 'films', 'are', 'junk', 'are', 'surprises', 'there', 'one', 'British', 'horror/action', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'theatrically', 'U.S.', 'starring', 'mostly', 'unfamiliar', 'American', 'viewers', 'quot', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'exciting', 'well-written', 'well', 'acted', 'horror', 'flick', 'pretensions', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'recent', 'indie', 'horror', 'received', 'lot', 'critical', 'praise', 'quot', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cabin', 'Fever.', 'quot', 'horror', 'action', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'one.', 'quot', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'essentially', 'mixture', 'quot', 'Southern', 'Comfort', 'quot', 'quot', 'Warriors', 'quot', 'werewolves', 'military', 'unit', 'trapped', 'wilderness', 'surrounding', 'merciless', 'foes', 'who', 'case', 'happen', 'be', 'huge', 'two-legged', 'wolves', 'film', 'also', 'heavily', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'quot', 'Alien', 'quot', 'quot', 'Aliens', 'quot', 'quot', 'Predator', 'quot', 'quot', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'quot', 'quot', 'Birds', 'quot', 'quot', 'Zulu', 'quot', 'characters', 'even', 'make', 'direct', 'mention', 'film', 'quot', 'Balir', 'Witch', 'Project', 'quot', 'quot', 'Straw', 'Dogs.', 'quot', 'plot', 'British', 'squad', 'training', 'exercise', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Luxembourg', 'squad', 'target', 'Special', 'Ops', 'unit', 'been', 'mysteriously', 'viciously', 'wiped', 'out', 'culprits', 'are', 'werewolves', 'soon', 'squad', 'local', 'biologist', 'are', 'fighting', 'live', 'night', 'full', 'moon', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'are', 'couple', 'nice', 'twists', 'story', 'way', 'shift', 'unexpected', 'directions.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'something', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'kind', 'lower-budget', 'horror', 'film', 'none', 'actors', 'are', 'big-named', 'stars', 'really', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'will', 'live', 'end', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'werewolf-chow', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'quot', 'Trainspotting', 'quot', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'son', 'one', 'men', 'who', 'played', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'take', 'lead', 'roles', 'do', 'great', 'believable', 'jobs', 'military', 'figures', 'intense', 'pressure', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'rise', 'occasion', 'real', 'scene-stealer', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'sole', 'survivor', 'Special', 'Ops', 'unit', 'vile', 'secretive', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'hiding', 'something', 'very', 'important', 'others.The', 'visual', 'effects', 'thankfully', 'avoid', 'CG', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'werewolves', 'are', 'achieved', 'using', 'full-body', 'suits', 'robotic', 'heads', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'very', 'convincing', 'longer', 'shots', 'filmmakers', 'cleverly', 'keep', 'mostly', 'shown', 'very', 'quick', 'shots', 'much', 'scarier', 'quite', 'bit', 'gore', 'not', 'grisly', 'effects', 'are', 'believable', 'most', 'part', 'horror', 'rely', 'fast-moving', 'exciting', 'action', 'are', 'very', 'good', ""'jump"", 'scares', 'creepy', 'drawn-out', 'sequences', 'Hard-core', 'horror', 'buffs', 'fans', 'military', 'action', 'will', 'find', 'results', 'satisfying.The', 'DVD', 'twenty-minute', ""'making"", 'featurette', 'Much', 'running', 'time', 'taken', 'up', 'clips', 'film', 'interesting', 'information', 'visual', 'effects', 'anti-CG', 'philosophy', 'commentary', 'two', 'producers', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'info', '5.1', 'sound', 'mix', 'adequate', 'are', 'juicy', 'howling', 'explosions', 'back', 'speakers', 'most', 'sound', 'pushed', 'front', 'speakers', 'volume', 'bit', 'low.', 'quot', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'real', 'find', 'want', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'horror', 'movie', 'scares', 'rugged', 'violence', 'smart', 'well-acted', 'bargain', 'hope', 'director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'more', 'films', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'even', 'receive', 'theatrical', 'release']",N/A

Wow, was I in for a treat! DOG SOLDIERS is a mix of several classic horror films rolled into one delicious piece of frightful cinema.The film centers around a squad of British soldiers on a training mission in the Scottish wilderness who find a wounded Special Forces captain and the carnage of what used to be his team. As they encounter a female Ranger named Megan they soon find out that werewolves have been running rampant in the region. Soon enough, the ammunition runs low, the body count rises and the blood flows as the plot thickens.DOG SOLDIERS has a little bit of everything. It's gory, funny, and most importantly it knows never to take itself too seriously. Much like EVIL DEAD or even better yet, PREADATOR, the film is loaded with cheesey one liners and bloody action sequences. Sometimes you may even find yourself laughing during the films most gruesome scenes and director Neil Marshall has done this on purpose!

Colley ""daz78""","[2, 2]","Quite possibility the best werewolf film made since An American Werewolf in London.In Dog Soldiers, a group of British squaddies, out on a training exercise in the vast wilderness of the Scottish Highlands, come up against a `troop' of werewolves.Having dispatched a group of superior British SAS special forces, surely the regular British troops won't be much of a problem for the 7ft hairy howlers. Wrong; through their toughness, training and the little incentive of staying alive, the squaddies put a brave determined fight, fuelled with typical gallows humour (`I hope I give you the sh***' says one of the squaddies before he becomes `dinner').Whilst it takes bits from Aliens and Night of the Living Dead, you have to remember that these films in turn take inspiration from earlier films, Aliens, for example, is a sort of futuristic `Zulu' and the siege of Rourke's Drift in Natal. There is also the look up to Predator, though instead of muscle bound men we have a sort of mismatch of determined, dogged, (`scuse the pun) and well trained group of terriers (oh dear), the sort of blokes that make up the British Army (or 'the scum of the earth' as Wellington famously called his own troops)..This is a unique modern horror movie, in that it throws out the CGI possibilities. CGI never ever works in horror movies. The digital animation, no matter how realistic, severs the link between the viewers' expectations that the `monster' and the `victim' share the same `stage' (ground, etc). Whilst CGI brings wonders to fantasy films, such as Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Park, it seems too false and detached to exactly what is going on, on the screen. And that is what is great about Dog Soldiers, the wolves are on screen and you never have the irritated inkling that the victims are not staring death in the face, but are merely looking into a blue screen. American Werewolf in Paris, in particular, suffers greatly from this problem (among other things as well, to be fair).The cast includes fairly unknowns; however Kevin McKidd is most famous for his role in Trainspotting and Rome. Sean Pertwee has been in a few movies, including Event Horizon and coincidentally played Caesar in a series about Roman Emperors around the time McKidd was in Rome. Both Roman series where made and shown by the BBC (and HBO).I guess you will have to watch it to found out who lives and who doesn't, but I assure you it is worth it. It wasn't a huge success, but I believe it has enjoyed a second wave of success through word of mouth and has got itself a small cult following. There is a belated sequel planned, which is rumoured to be a bigger budget film than this one and aimed more at the US market. If so, then this film may get searched out again by a new wave of curious horror film addicts.Dog Soldiers is a perfect film for a night in while the rain crashes down outside and howls pierce the cold night air! And, it all ends with a poke at the English tabloids, and a shock victory against the `old enemy' (Germany) in a little game of football being played hundreds of miles away from the horror of the Scottish wilderness.4 Stars.",4,If you go down to the woods today...,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,3137,"['Quite', 'possibility', 'best', 'werewolf', 'film', 'made', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London.In', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'group', 'British', 'squaddies', 'out', 'training', 'exercise', 'vast', 'wilderness', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'come', 'up', 'troop', 'werewolves.Having', 'dispatched', 'group', 'superior', 'British', 'SAS', 'special', 'forces', 'surely', 'regular', 'British', 'troops', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'problem', '7ft', 'hairy', 'howlers', 'Wrong', 'toughness', 'training', 'little', 'incentive', 'staying', 'alive', 'squaddies', 'put', 'brave', 'determined', 'fight', 'fuelled', 'typical', 'gallows', 'humour', 'hope', 'give', 'sh***', 'one', 'squaddies', 'dinner', '.Whilst', 'bits', 'Aliens', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'have', 'remember', 'films', 'turn', 'take', 'inspiration', 'earlier', 'films', 'Aliens', 'example', 'sort', 'futuristic', 'Zulu', 'siege', 'Rourke', 'Drift', 'Natal', 'also', 'look', 'up', 'Predator', 'instead', 'muscle', 'men', 'have', 'sort', 'mismatch', 'determined', 'dogged', 'scuse', 'pun', 'well', 'trained', 'group', 'terriers', 'dear', 'sort', 'blokes', 'make', 'up', 'British', 'Army', ""'the"", 'scum', 'earth', 'Wellington', 'famously', 'called', 'own', 'troops', '..This', 'unique', 'modern', 'horror', 'movie', 'out', 'CGI', 'possibilities', 'CGI', 'never', 'ever', 'horror', 'movies', 'digital', 'animation', 'matter', 'how', 'realistic', 'link', 'viewers', 'expectations', 'monster', 'victim', 'share', 'same', 'stage', 'ground', 'etc', 'Whilst', 'CGI', 'wonders', 'fantasy', 'films', 'such', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'too', 'false', 'detached', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'screen', 'what', 'great', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'wolves', 'are', 'screen', 'never', 'have', 'irritated', 'inkling', 'victims', 'are', 'not', 'staring', 'death', 'face', 'are', 'merely', 'looking', 'blue', 'screen', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'Paris', 'particular', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'problem', 'other', 'things', 'well', 'be', 'fair', '.The', 'cast', 'fairly', 'unknowns', 'however', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'Trainspotting', 'Rome', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'been', 'few', 'movies', 'including', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'coincidentally', 'played', 'Caesar', 'series', 'Roman', 'Emperors', 'time', 'McKidd', 'was', 'Rome', 'Roman', 'series', 'where', 'made', 'shown', 'BBC', 'HBO', 'guess', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'found', 'out', 'who', 'who', ""n't"", 'assure', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'success', 'believe', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'wave', 'success', 'word', 'mouth', 'got', 'small', 'cult', 'following', 'belated', 'sequel', 'planned', 'rumoured', 'be', 'bigger', 'budget', 'film', 'one', 'aimed', 'more', 'US', 'market', 'so', 'then', 'film', 'may', 'get', 'searched', 'out', 'again', 'new', 'wave', 'curious', 'horror', 'film', 'addicts.Dog', 'Soldiers', 'perfect', 'film', 'night', 'rain', 'crashes', 'down', 'outside', 'pierce', 'cold', 'night', 'air', 'poke', 'English', 'tabloids', 'shock', 'victory', 'old', 'enemy', 'Germany', 'little', 'game', 'football', 'being', 'played', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'horror', 'Scottish', 'wilderness.4', 'Stars']",N/A

For those who complained about the 'wimpy' looking werewolves, have you had much experience with real werewolves to compare?  Personally I think the use of costumes and animatronic heads to create the werewolves was a refreshing change from the overdone CGI effects most movies of this type employ.  The protagonists are actually interacting with each other rather than pretending with a green screen and I think you get a much purer emotional reaction as a result.  Another complaint I've seen here a lot was how the werewolves' night vision was nearly as bright as day and not the greenish color NVG's (night vision goggles) produce.  If you'll notice in the beginning, one of the special forces team is uses the NVG's which does produce the greenish coloring, the bright black and white of the wolves' vision is a contrast to this allowing you to know whose point of view you're actually seeing, and this continues throughout the movie, color footage with dim lighting is the human perspective, brightly lit black and white the werewolf.

The premise, in a nutshell, is that a small squad of British soldiers are dropped into the Scottish Highlands on wargames -- on the eve of an important soccer match against Germany (important at the end with the newspaper mockup, and because one of the men, ""Joe,"" is really into soccer).All seems well initially, until a dead (cow?  deer?  not sure) animal falls onto their campfire.  The interest of the squad leader (Pertwee) triggered, he leads his men to investigate, coming across the very bloody remains of their opposition in the wargames, the Special Forces unit.They find a survivor, babbling ""there was only supposed to be ONE!""  Taking him with them (and co-opting the weapons with REAL ammo, the squad's were filled with blanks), the squad is beset by werewolves (which we don't see fully-lit until later).  One death and a maiming later, the survivors run into Megan (Emma Cleasby), who takes them to the ""safety"" of a neighbor's house.So, we have soldiers with limited ammunition, monsters trying to get in, and more secrets yet to be revealed.""Dog Soldiers"" may have been shot on a budget, but it was an enjoyable romp for anyone who loves werewolf movies.Lots of gore (those who've seen the movie will understand my review title), but none of it gratuitous.

From this point on the movie excels.  The characters are all likable (with one major exception, Liam Cunningham as the treacherous Captain Ryan).  The action is frenzied.  The dialog (when understood) is quite humorous (given the trying circumstances).  Plus, any movie that stars Sean Pertwee automatically has merit because of that.  And they've managed to take the hackneyed premise of a group of people trapped in a house fighting for their lives from a force surrounding them in the night, in a forest, in the middle of nowhere, and they make it exciting and suspenseful.  There are a few surprises along the way, a cow drops by, they meet up with an old enemy, and learn never to trust a traveling zoologist.

These are really cool looking werewolves.I'm sure everybody gets number 2.

Kevin McKidd, from the short-lived ""Journeyman"" TV show, plays Cooper, the Special Ops reject and lead.  This is very much a character driven story like so many combat films, and none of the actors did anything that would hurt this film at any time.  The end result is characters that the viewer can make emotional investments in.- ER', WOTE'S OL DIS BOUT A STOORY?Yea, these guys are speaking English but you might need the subtitles.  These are true everyman characters that have various levels of intelligence and education.  So, not surprisingly, they speak with United Kingdom colloquialisms.

Suffice it to say that this is not as simple as it appears on the surface and plays a lot like ""Aliens"" in a cottage in Scotland with werewolves.-CARNAGE IMPLIED IS STILL CARNAGE.Many will be thrilled to know that very little if any CG was used in this film.  Director Neil Marshall is a fan of practical FX and put them to good use here.  As much carnage as there is in this film, we only get to see the aftermath and not the actual events.  That said; some fairly satisfying gore is splattered around ""Dog Soldiers"".  Some of it is border-line silly, but in a good way.Quick glimpses of the werewolves will have to do for a somewhat obvious reason; they're guys in static wolf heads wearing stilts.  The longer you see them, the sillier they look.  However, the glimpse technique actually works out, resulting in one of the better, scarier illusions of werewolves.-IS THIS FUR YOU?Sorry about that horrendous pun.  The point is you should like ""last stand"" kinds of movies.  This easily compares as a lower budget version of ""Aliens"" as I mentioned before.  Where this differs from ""Aliens"" is that the characters are more realistic and less clich&eacute;d.  You've probably met people like this.  Though they never stop being soldiers their humanity shines through.  So, I give the actors a lot of credit.  The story is familiar yet unique enough to have a few surprises.  There is a lot of action, shooting and suspense.  You can find technical flaws if you really look for them, but then you deserve not to enjoy it.  It may seem like there are some plot holes or unexplained events until you piece together the film as a whole, and then most of it makes perfect sense.  I didn't catch everything at first, but it didn't stop me from enjoying ""Dog Soldiers"".-Story........4.5-Acting......4.5-Visuals.......4.0-Characters..5.0Average......4.5",5,Canine Freedom Fighters; I Do Love a Dog in Uniform!,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3866,"['Clearly', 'am', 'misrepresenting', 'film', 'are', 'actual', 'dog', 'soldiers', 'uniform', 'Heck', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'dogs', 'entire', 'movie', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'film', 'squad', 'Her', 'Majesties', 'finest', 'soldiers', 'going', 'toe', 'toe', 'family', 'Lycanthropes', 'get', 'details', 'feel', 'need', 'qualify', 'why', 'favorite', 'Werewolf', 'film', 'date:1', 'Zulu', 'favorite', 'war', 'film.2', 'are', 'really', 'cool', 'looking', 'werewolves.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everybody', 'number', '2', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'number', '1', 'then', 'highly', 'suggest', 'Google', 'Rorkes', 'Drift', 'familiarize', 'story', 'portrayed', 'Zulu', 'make', 'brief', 'was', 'famous', 'Desperate', 'Last', 'Stand', 'battle', 'often', 'referenced', 'film', 'Regardless', 'two', 'things', 'combined', 'make', 'one', 'more', 'exciting', 'well', 'executed', 'action/horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Let', 'tear', 'details', '-HI', ""'M"", 'BRUCE', 'YOU', 'MIGHT', 'REMEMBER', 'ME', 'FROM', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', '.No', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'not', 'film', 'Well', 'yea', ""n't"", 'Actually', 'one', 'soldier', 'name', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'Sergeant', 'squad', 'named', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'played', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'Nobody', 'else', 'cute', 'name', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'short-lived', 'Journeyman', 'TV', 'show', 'Cooper', 'Special', 'Ops', 'reject', 'lead', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'driven', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'combat', 'films', 'none', 'actors', 'did', 'anything', 'would', 'hurt', 'film', 'time', 'end', 'result', 'characters', 'viewer', 'can', 'make', 'emotional', 'investments', 'in.-', 'ER', 'WOTE', 'OL', 'DIS', 'BOUT', 'A', 'STOORY', 'Yea', 'guys', 'are', 'speaking', 'English', 'might', 'need', 'subtitles', 'are', 'true', 'everyman', 'characters', 'have', 'various', 'levels', 'intelligence', 'education', 'So', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'speak', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'colloquialisms', 'As', 'hard', 'understand', 'language', 'never', 'do', 'fail', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'tools', 'Crown', 'would', 'be', 'spoiling', 'lot', 'explaining', 'detail', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Suffice', 'say', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'surface', 'lot', 'Aliens', 'cottage', 'Scotland', 'werewolves.-CARNAGE', 'IMPLIED', 'IS', 'STILL', 'CARNAGE.Many', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'CG', 'was', 'used', 'film', 'Director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'fan', 'practical', 'FX', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'here', 'much', 'carnage', 'film', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'aftermath', 'not', 'actual', 'events', 'said', 'fairly', 'satisfying', 'gore', 'splattered', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'border-line', 'silly', 'good', 'way.Quick', 'glimpses', 'werewolves', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'somewhat', 'obvious', 'reason', ""'re"", 'guys', 'static', 'wolf', 'heads', 'wearing', 'stilts', 'longer', 'see', 'sillier', 'look', 'However', 'glimpse', 'technique', 'actually', 'out', 'resulting', 'one', 'better', 'scarier', 'illusions', 'werewolves.-IS', 'THIS', 'FUR', 'YOU', 'Sorry', 'horrendous', 'pun', 'point', 'should', 'like', 'last', 'stand', 'kinds', 'movies', 'easily', 'lower', 'budget', 'version', 'Aliens', 'mentioned', 'before', 'Where', 'Aliens', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', 'less', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'met', 'people', 'never', 'stop', 'being', 'soldiers', 'humanity', 'shines', 'So', 'give', 'actors', 'lot', 'credit', 'story', 'familiar', 'yet', 'unique', 'enough', 'have', 'few', 'surprises', 'lot', 'action', 'shooting', 'suspense', 'can', 'find', 'technical', 'flaws', 'really', 'look', 'then', 'deserve', 'not', 'enjoy', 'may', 'seem', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'unexplained', 'events', 'piece', 'together', 'film', 'whole', 'then', 'most', 'perfect', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'everything', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', '.-Story', '..4.5-Acting', '4.5-Visuals', '.4.0-Characters..5.0Average', '4.5']",N/A

Fortunately, my thoughts were not matched by the film. For once, a horror movie got the better of me. ""Dog Soldiers"" is one of those British type films, you know with heavy accents and odd characters. It has some rather creepy elements early on in the film and who I percieved to be the lead character (it was tricky at times) was quite convincing and fun to watch. When the band of soldiers is picked off by the were-wolves, the fun begins. They meet up with a woman who manages to get them to safety. Of course, not everything is as it seems and some twisted mayhem follows. Suddenly, the woman and the handful of soldiers are thrust into a battle between beast and prey. There isn't too much gore, but alot of the after affects of the kill. There is a gory scene involving entrails (intestines) that really gave me the heebie-jeebies.

719567,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B00006L91H,General Zombie,"[7, 10]","I remember, over the last couple of months, occasionally coming across various people and message boards and whatnot mentioning that they really liked the movie 'Dog Soldiers'.  I was confused. I knew of a movie called 'Dog Soldiers', but surely this could not be the movie that so many people liked.  It looked utterly terrible.  Must be another movie with the same name.  I looked into it, and sure enough, it was the movie I was thinking of.  Then reports started coming in that Neil Marshall had directed a new film, 'The Descent', which is supposedly one of the very best horror movies in recent memory.  I suppose that was finally enough for me to get up the enthusiasm to actually see this movie.  I was still concerned, however, as it had a lot of strikes against it: 1- Stupid Title 2- Stupid Premise 3- It's British 4- Debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel 5- Promos looked terrible, and like any other Sci-Fi Channel movie. (Well, I don't actually mind that it's British, but I thought it would be funny to say I did.  Was it?)  After viewing the movie the truth proved to be somewhere between the two poles.  It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's certainly not worthy of any particular hype either, not that it really had that much to begin with.  Just a fun, somewhat 'Predator'-esque movie about a squad of soldiers that are assailed by a pack of werewolves out in the forest.This is a low-budget film, needless to say, but it's reasonably slickly done as far as these things go.  The werewolves look kinda stupid, but they almost invariably do, so I don't hold it against the movie too much.  It does earn points for actually making them look wolf-like, unlike virtually all werewolves, which are generally ape-bears.  Performances are pretty solid for this kinda thing, and the soldiers are usually charming and likable enough.  There are a few crappy one-liners, but a few good ones as well, which is a pretty decent rate.  Overall the dialogue is occasionally witty and generally inoffensive, at least. (The major scene of the squad talking and reminiscing at the end of the first day is particularly well done, and comes to a surprising/hilarious conclusion)  The movie is reasonably gory, though they usually don't let you get too good of a look at it, and it's usually just the aftermath.  Nothing to get too excited over, but at least they're making the effort.Eventually the squad holes up in a cabin, allowing for various firefights with the seemingly invulnerable werewolves, and the creation of a slightly oppressive atmosphere, as they seem pretty much stuck there.  This is the  bulk of the movie, and it proves more restrained than you might anticipate, though it still has plenty of action.I should mention, all this actually proves to be quite a bit less silly than it sounds.  It's still a little silly, much of the time, but it works as a straight action-horror film provided you are particularly good at suspending your disbelief. Anyway, a pretty fun horror movie, definitely.  A reasonably promising debut, and hopefully 'The Descent' will prove to be as good as everyone says it is.Grade: B-",4,Solid B-Movie,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,3126,"['remember', 'last', 'couple', 'months', 'occasionally', 'coming', 'various', 'people', 'message', 'boards', 'whatnot', 'mentioning', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'Soldiers', 'was', 'confused', 'knew', 'movie', 'called', ""'Dog"", 'Soldiers', 'surely', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'liked', 'looked', 'utterly', 'terrible', 'Must', 'be', 'movie', 'same', 'name', 'looked', 'sure', 'enough', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'thinking', 'Then', 'reports', 'started', 'coming', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'had', 'directed', 'new', 'film', 'Descent', 'supposedly', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', 'recent', 'memory', 'suppose', 'was', 'finally', 'enough', 'get', 'up', 'enthusiasm', 'actually', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'concerned', 'however', 'had', 'lot', 'strikes', '1-', 'Stupid', 'Title', '2-', 'Stupid', 'Premise', '3-', 'British', '4-', 'Debuted', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', '5-', 'Promos', 'looked', 'terrible', 'other', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'movie', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'mind', 'British', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'say', 'did', 'Was', 'viewing', 'movie', 'truth', 'proved', 'be', 'somewhere', 'two', 'poles', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'means', 'certainly', 'not', 'worthy', 'particular', 'hype', 'either', 'not', 'really', 'had', 'much', 'begin', 'Just', 'fun', 'somewhat', ""'Predator'-esque"", 'movie', 'squad', 'soldiers', 'are', 'assailed', 'pack', 'werewolves', 'out', 'forest.This', 'low-budget', 'film', 'needless', 'say', 'reasonably', 'slickly', 'done', 'as', 'far', 'things', 'go', 'werewolves', 'look', 'kinda', 'stupid', 'almost', 'invariably', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'earn', 'points', 'actually', 'making', 'look', 'wolf-like', 'virtually', 'werewolves', 'are', 'generally', 'ape-bears', 'Performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'kinda', 'thing', 'soldiers', 'are', 'usually', 'charming', 'likable', 'enough', 'are', 'few', 'crappy', 'one-liners', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'pretty', 'decent', 'rate', 'dialogue', 'occasionally', 'witty', 'generally', 'inoffensive', 'least', 'major', 'scene', 'squad', 'talking', 'reminiscing', 'end', 'first', 'day', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'surprising/hilarious', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'gory', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'too', 'good', 'look', 'usually', 'just', 'aftermath', 'Nothing', 'get', 'too', 'excited', 'least', ""'re"", 'making', 'effort.Eventually', 'squad', 'up', 'cabin', 'allowing', 'various', 'firefights', 'seemingly', 'invulnerable', 'werewolves', 'creation', 'slightly', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'seem', 'pretty', 'much', 'stuck', 'there', 'bulk', 'movie', 'more', 'restrained', 'might', 'anticipate', 'still', 'plenty', 'action.I', 'should', 'mention', 'actually', 'be', 'quite', 'bit', 'less', 'silly', 'still', 'little', 'silly', 'much', 'time', 'straight', 'action-horror', 'film', 'provided', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'Anyway', 'pretty', 'fun', 'horror', 'movie', 'definitely', 'reasonably', 'promising', 'debut', 'hopefully', ""'The"", 'Descent', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'everyone', 'B-']",N/A

719575,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B00006L91H,H. Jin,"[2, 3]","[4.5 stars]In an age where ""horror movie"" means either lame teen slasher flicks or gratuitously sadistic torture-porn sickness, it's great to see this more old-school styled horror/thriller flick. A group of soldiers are on a routine training mission in the Highlands of Scotland, when they uncover their Special Forces ""Hunter"" group slashed to pieces. The terrified rantings of the sole SF survivor suggest some mysterious creature slaughtered his colleagues, and the soldiers are soon attacked by ferocious wolf-like creatures. Escaping, the soldiers bunker down in the home of local woman Megan, and try desperately to see out the night.What makes this movie work so well are the characters. In contrast to the hormonal college kids or dysfunctional families of many horror films, who we actually WANT to see killed they're so annoying, `Dog Soldiers' actually makes us care about the characters. Kevin McKidd and Sean Pertwee do excellent jobs as leads Cooper and ""Sarge"", Emma Cleasby is perfect as the everywoman-who-may-be-hiding-something Megan, and Liam Cunningham absolutely nails it as the duplicitous Ryan. But the supporting cast is extremely strong too; a few brief scenes early in the film help establish each character's personality as an individual, from the philosophical Bruce to the football hooligan Joe. Having the main characters as soldiers also emphasises their strength of character, friendship, and resourcefulness. They don't cry and scream like the kids in teen slasher movies; they band together and fight back hard. They care (and therefore so do we) when one of their own is killed. They give us the sense that they can genuinely win. They are people we can really cheer for.And although you obviously have to suspend disbelief in a film like this, the ""military weapon"" plot is kinda sorta believable, for a horror movie anyway. The sinister Ryan is the key character here, his ruthless cynical nature almost convinces you that he and his colleagues would be behind something like this.As mentioned, this film is more old-school horror in the sense that it avoids cheap shocks and buckets of red paint in favour of building tension slowly, and making you care about the characters getting out alive. The ""werewolves"" are often hidden in shadows or trees, not revealed too soon. The secrets are revealed gradually, and people are not always what they seem. Unravelling the mysteries about what the creatures are and what their purpose is forms just as big a part of the movie as the shock and horror aspects. There is some quite graphic violence and horror, and typical ""final battle"" action at the end, but the relative slow-burn of the film means that when the gore does break out, it has far greater impact and power. The film is somewhat low-budget in a sense (the ""werewolves"" are very obviously actors on stilts, the ripped intestines are clearly sausages, etc), but this only emphasises that plot and character are far more important to building tension than big expensive, unscary, CGI effects.In all, this is just a great little film that should be appreciated for all horror/thriller fans. Those with a weak stomach may want to pass, but the plot and strong characters are almost enough to carry this film even for those who aren't horror aficionados.

719577,AR61Y2VWLST1V,B00006L91H,"Holly Apollyon ""Messiah of Regret and Entropy""","[4, 4]","Firstly, I have to say, for me this movie was like the Howling meets Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, in terms of cast anyway. Have you ever noticed the complete lack of cool werewolf movies out there? I mean, all of this vampire garbage comes streaming out of Hollywood like fake blood running down a victim's neck, but where are the werewolves? I can think of a few, like Wolfen or American Werewolf in London, and of course the Howling, with its towering, vulpine bat-eared werewolves, which wasn't a great movie, but had the virtue of the first really noteworthy werewolf sequences.This movie finally does the poor hairy guys some jutice. It involves a military unit initially used as bait by another special ops division to draw out a clan of werewolves. This former unit becomes the group of underdog heroes forced to rock and roll with the werewolves in a tiny collage at the center of a vast wilderness. Of course, like any good horror movie, they throw in a pretty girl after a while, so I'm down with that. I can't actually say I recognized much of the cast, except for the guy that played Smith in Event Horizon, but that fact in itself adds a kind of positive element to the movie, like the way Chris Carter originally envisioned the X-Files. The solidiers are extremely capable, and sympathetic as characters. I hated seeing them go down, which is not always the case with these kind of movies. They were all noble warriors with stout hearts, never flinching in the face of the evil they're facing.The werewolves were not mindless monsters, but instead moderately strategic fighters ingrained with a wolf's pack mentality. As the movie unfolds, the human origins of the werewolves become apparent, and the solidiers finally realize they are much closer to home than originally suspected. a monster brawl rages through the night, with the werwolves apparently gaining in strength as the moon waxes. Very well done. I think if I had any complaint at all, I would have liked it if they had shown a little less of the werewolves themselves, keeping them darker-shadowed and a little more mystified.

""Dog Soldiers"" is a combination of ""Aliens,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" with ""Evil Dead"" overtones. The threat is outside. The threat is inside. The threat is the soldiers their selves, as they begin to realize that some of their own are infected, & could turn at anytime. The threat is also right under their noses, but their oblivious to it.""Dog Soldiers"" is really one of a kind Werewolf film. Sure, we've had multiple Werewolves in films before like ""the Howling,"" but not as an all out attack, all the time, all at once, assault on your senses, & this is where this movie falters. There is so much Werewolf action, that after a few viewings, one becomes desensitized to it, & begins to find holes in the movies plot, like giant pot holes in a muddy spring road. ""Dog Soldiers"" walks the fine line of being an all out action film, with Werewolves, & a creepy, we only see glimpses of the monster(s) horror film. It starts out as a horror movie, but ends up an action film, with the last twenty minutes verging on the ridiculous, even for a horror film, as we get a surprise from one of the protagonists in the house. We get a soldier kicking a werewolf's tooth out, then boxing it & hitting it over the head with a frying pan, & he's winning, at least until another werewolf shows up! I have to admit, I do find this scene funny, & I'm sure (at least I hope) that this is intentional, but it also takes away the great dead serious atmosphere this film brings to us the first 60-70 minutes, & destroys it. The rest of the film follows suite, sorry to say.Very few horror/action films work on both levels, one is the granddaddy, or should I say grandma of them all, ""Aliens."" The other example would be the granddaughter, by the same director as ""Dog Soldiers,"" Neil Marshall's, ""the Descent."" ""Dog Soldiers"" is a test run for Neil, for what would become ""the Decent,"" The test run was three fourths successful, but like all test runs, you figure out where the flaws are & fix them.""Dog Soldiers is a highly entertaining film, with some great dialog, & fine old fashion Werewolf prosthetics, but eventually succumbs to it's own weight, where movies like ""the Howling"" rely on atmosphere & dread, ""Dog Soldiers is like trying to run a three minute mile. It runs out of gas at the end, but still has enough horror & action that works to make this a classic, though no masterpiece.The Blu-ray was nice.

One soldier from the group is a recent SAS rejection - he wouldn't shoot a dog under superior officer's orders - and immediately recognizes the cowering survivor as the perpetrator of his SAS dismissal.  After joining military forces and learning that the previous massacre was essentially werewolves responding to the dinner bell, the troops acquire a local female biologist who fills in the story gaps and helps lead them to a ramshackle cabin - the escape route is not fully secure - in the heart of the woods where they can hunker down until the full moon wanes.  The siege begins and, unfortunately for the soldiers, none possess expertise in metallurgy and granny didn't keep a drawer full of solid silver forks.  The picture looks pretty bleak as the werewolves search for the defensive holes, testing the back-to-back defenders with each scratching claw and eerie glimpse.  Let the battle for survival begin.Knowing that director Neil Marshall was responsible forThe Descent- a movie I love - there should have been no doubt about this underrated, low budget horror flick.  The perfect combination of lighting, an aura of desperation, and more assault rifles than in Waco, makes for an exciting, fast-paced film.  CGI is minimal and well conceived.  Add in a few scare scenes, a decent amount of gore, a passable story, competent acting, and what's not to like?  Overall it's relatively simple, and no new ground is really covered; yet, I was engrossed from beginning to end.Think of it as a less hokeyFrom Dusk Till Dawnwith werewolves substituted for vampires, stars substituted for lesser-well-knowns, and Salma Hayek's luscious assets completely left out.

719591,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00006L91H,Jeffrey Leach,"[107, 118]","Every few years a horror film comes along that simply wows genre fans. Maybe it has something to do with awesome gore effects, or a better than average plot, or great performances by previously unknown actors; it might even resemble something like &quot;Dog Soldiers,&quot; a recent film that contains all of the above mentioned attributes along with a nifty reworking of one of horror's old touchstones: the werewolf story. Whatever it is that makes a horror film stand out, we need more movies that look like this one. &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; seemed to come out of nowhere, like manna from heaven feeding weary horror fans slogging through the deserts of slasher film retreads and the recent trend of mediocre remakes. The fact that this gripping take on the werewolf legend comes from the British Isles makes it even more remarkable. The misty climes of the Scottish highlands are the perfect setting for such a bleak movie. Remember how successful &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; was when it took place in the same bleak atmosphere? You get that type of oppressiveness in &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; as well.No one really believes in werewolves anymore. The whole business about people changing into bloodthirsty wolves when a full moon comes out just doesn't seem as scary in a world of serial killers and terrorism. And shooting a beast through the heart with a silver bullet or stabbing them with a silver blade? C'mon! Something as easy as that wouldn't even turn Jason Voorhees's head for a second! Yep, in today's world you will need something much more involved than a couple of hairy brutes roaming around in the woods once a month. Fortunately, you get much more with &quot;Dog Soldiers.&quot; How about an entire family of werewolves, a squad of heavily armed soldiers on a training exercise in the wilds of Scotland, and a deserted house in the middle of nowhere? How about a guy brave enough to take on an eight-foot tall werewolf with his bare hands? How about enough gunfire to make &quot;Scarface&quot; look like a Disney film? If you think lycanthropes and assault weapons go together like milk and cookies, you will adore this film.The plot is seductively simple: a squad of army regulars, including a tough as nails soldier who recently flunked out of SAS training because he wouldn't shoot a dog, runs into more than they can handle during a routine exercise out in the hills. They uncover a group of SAS troops torn to pieces in the wild, and find only one survivor of the group cowering nearby (who just happens to be the guy who flunked our sturdy hero out of the SAS). This colonel rants and raves about how there are more of &quot;them&quot; then we thought, and how there's no way to stop them, and other seemingly mad statements. One thing's for certain: anything that can turn a group of SAS commandos into hamburger would send me running home to mother. The regular army guys recognize this danger, too, and decide to scoot right out of the hills and back to civilization.Regrettably, whatever attacked the SAS guys suddenly reappears to wreak havoc on our group of heroes. While fleeing through the woods from these shadowy figures, the men stumble upon a vehicle driving along a country lane. As it turns out, the car contains a beautiful young lass who knows all about what's going on in the woods. It's werewolves out hunting for the night, she says, and as if to emphasis this point the lycanthropes attack the car. The group manages to get to a nearby house and barricade themselves inside, but the vehicle goes up in flames and now there is no way out until morning. The rest of the film consists of one lengthy combat scene after another, as the soldiers use machine guns, blades, and their bare hands to hold off the group of enraged wolves. Another thing: for some reason best left unsaid here, the werewolves seem to resent the soldiers holing up in this particular house. These guys just cannot get a break.With the exception of one scene well into the movie that strains the bounds of believability, everything works in &quot;Dog Soldiers.&quot; The characters are interesting and well developed, especially the Sergeant leading the platoon and the rejected SAS soldier. Even the evil SAS colonel who knows much more than he is letting on adds a fun dimension to the film. Throw in literally gallons of blood and gore, gallows humor dialogue, and pacing that fairly grabs you around the neck and you have a horror classic for the ages with this gem. I should also mention that &quot;Dog Soldiers,&quot; at one point in the movie, actually made me jump so high out of my chair that I nearly hit the ceiling. You probably won't see this shock coming, and I won't spoil it for you, but if you don't react in some way when it happens, you're probably comatose. I salute a movie that can inspire such a jolt in my jaded system. It wouldn't surprise me at all if &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; gets a sequel in the near future, if not for any big box office numbers then for heavy rental numbers and enthusiastic praise from many horror fans. I could watch this film again and again without ever getting tired of it, and I think you will like it too if you give it a chance.",5,You Won't Waste Your Time With This One,1065571200,"10 8,

719592,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00006L91H,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 6]","There are great classics related to werewolves, The Howling, Wolfen, and the superior American Werewolf in London. After watching ""Dog Soldiers"" it can easily be part of this pack. I fine this movie to be very exciting and pleasant B movie. This was recommended to me by Caesar M. Warrington, who is also a great reviewer, during the month of Halloween. Werewolves fascinate me more then Vampires so I couldn't wait till next Halloween to watch this. You will not a fine a major city, silly people or unneeded love story involved in this film. Just a couple of cool soldiers who are willing to do anything to survive. In here we have a group of six British Soldiers spend time on the Scottish highlands to do a special training but one Soldier is whining about missing a soccer game between England versus Germany, a little like the tension you get when America versus Canada or something! Apparently Story goes that where the soldiers are standing, they hear about gruesome ""true"" tales of people go missing but savage and gory murder scenes are simultaneously found as potential evidence. A leader, Captain Ryan happens to be the sole survivor of another team that becomes a 'dog's breakfast'! Is he hiding a secret that the remaining team should know about? Who knows?That is when Luna-loving furry doggies with rabies come into view, and they look like muscular, mutant gerbils in mink coats, with Freddy Claws. The Team have to drop their blank bullets for real ones as a locally rural girl, Megan, comes in as GI Jane to save them by escaping out of the woods by a Jeep, taking the remaining Soldiers with her, and sheltered into a remote Country Farm House. Trouble starts brewing because the Soldiers are running out of Ammunition, Howlings are drawing nearer, and how long will sunlight come before people die like flies?""Dog Soldiers"" does start slow and is a bit predictable but the humor is wicked. I also give credit to the gory scenes where the Sergeant's guts were exposed and the sheep dog was toying with it; thinking they were sausages. There are flaws with the film, but it is still fun and entertaining. Influences from other movies stand out here, but they still don't take away from 'Dog Soldiers', I feel that they've just used an idea and modified it to produce something new. Much better than the current Hollywood mentality of making a horror - take a half-good idea and drive it into the ground with continuous knock-off after knock-off. The best part is when the Sergeant shares a chilling camp fire story about ""Eddie Oswald""; a private he once knew in Kuwait 1991, and then raised a toast for him!! One Private tells a joke about a man and his dog, suddenly on that 'cue' a dead stuffed Cow drops from the sky to join them, literally!For a low-budget movie this is quite a gem. Fans of the movies I mentioned previously should check it out, it's not strictly horror. I believe the director said that it was a soldier film with werewolves, not the other way round, so it could also be classed as an action film. Either way, that is really of no relevance.

From beginning to end this movie was nothing but a rehash of American horror cliches. I could list dozens but I'll just list several:--unsuspecting couple making out in the woods is attacked by a bloodthirsty creature (American horror cliche done to death).--character running in fear unsuspectingly impales himself on sharp object (Bruce on tree branch). This is reminiscent of the original Rambo, where the cop is impaled by a trap set by Rambo. In fact, this entire forest scene in Dog Soldiers appears to be completely influenced by the Rambo forest scene: the setting, color, pacing, suspense, and the whole aspect of heavily armed men being taken out one by one by an unseen menace.--people isolated in a house, trying to fight against ravenous creatures (American horror cliche popularized by the original Night of the Living Dead).--group tries to escape by car but the car blows up (Night of the Living Dead again).--character (Joe) finds out the last minute the creature is behind him (American horror staple).--character drops his guard, thinking the creature has been defeated, only for him to be attacked and killed (American horror cliche memorable in Joel's death scene in Pumpkinhead).--group finds out one of their own is infected and watch in horror as he transforms (like Palmer's transformation in the 1982 Thing).--main character is about to die so he kills himself and the creature with an explosion (like Dr. Loomis from Halloween 2).--instead of a final girl, there is a battered and bloody final guy who walks out of the cabin after witnessing the slaughter of his friends (like Ash from Evil Dead).I gave this a 2/5 stars because, like the Descent, there isn't anything new or original here.

I feel that the werewolves in this movie are the scariest werewolves I've ever seen--gangly, impossibly tall and intimidating humanoids with snarling wolf heads atop them.I docked a star because I didn't like the end--or, rather, I am still confused about what really happened and why! I don't understand Megan's role in the whole thing. How did she become a werewolf? Is she actually part of the family or was she just visiting while researching? Why did she betray the men and all of a sudden decide to help the wolves instead, letting them into the house? If she's a werewolf, why didn't she change into one earlier in the evening when the others did? Etc.Oh, and Spoon's death scene (and one-liner accompanying it) is the best death scene in any horror movie ever. Period. You go, Spoonie.

A lot of people are going to avoid it just because of what it is.  I just want to say that if you're the kind of person to whom the the premise sounds watchable, the movie will probably exceed your expectations.A couple professional touches lift this little flick way above the low-budget pack.First, the pacing is lickety-split; everything the viewer learns about what's happening, and who it's happening to, occurs while the action is rolling right along.Second, the actors are into their roles and perform with gusto.  Their script is blunt and profane, avoiding 'Tarantino-wannabe"" hipness and coming across pretty much like what a bunch of freaked out young soldiers might actually sound like.Third, the action is slick and thrilling.  It's great to see budget constraints overcome by sheer imagination, as in the rip-snorting climax, which is over-the-top explosive despite the fact that it takes place entirely inside a small country house.Don't fall prey to the intolerance many modern genre fans have toward low budget films!

(According to an IMDb keyword search 677 vs. 195) This shouldn't reflect badly on our hairy nocturnal lycanthropic friends. It's a matter of F/X. For a vampire all you need is some pancake make-up, some dime store false teeth, and some Goth clothes and your good to go. Werewolves on the other hand actually require some special effects.I've noticed as a result independent B-movies that feature werewolves tend to be more competently filmed, tighter scripted affairs. (Think Ginger Snaps) Dog Soldiers fits that bill in spades. Really a combination of Predator and Rio Bravo, Dog Soldiers does not have one boring moment, one unnecessary scene, one bit of extraneous padding so often found in films today.The Werewolves look pretty good, the gore is plentiful and the movie overall looks great. There also isn't a groaner moment where someone acts out of character or does something remarkably stupid. (No we found three dead bodies lets go skinny dipping moments.) If anything the characters seem to become more resourceful the worse the odds get. (And they get bad fast)The werewolves also truly terrorize both our protagonists and the audience.(The werewolves are big and strong and formidable fighters). It's bad odds for our heroes though not impossible. Of course this being an independent British production there is a good possibility the werewolves will win. (Not as likely needless to say in Werewolf the remake starring Brandon Fraser and Kirsten Dunst and rated PG-13)Once again exciting movie on a tight budget, and when the characters that had been injured start healing a little to fast' Did I mention it's also a little like The Thing?",5,Dog Soldiers...

Dwane ""love4learning""","[0, 0]","Typical monster in the house premise with a group of British soldiers circling the wagons inside an isolated country house with werewolves knocking off characters one by one. As has been mentioned, special affects and costuming are not exactly top-of-the-line and there are plenty of plot holes and lapses in logic but the actors are comitted and generate a sense of urgency and fear with the ever dependable Sean Pertwee playing the likeable, grunt, 'one of the guys' Sergeant and Kevin McKidd as the uber talented and resourceful soldier you know right away is going to survive all this.I can see why there are such harsh negative reviews. When you read comments like 'DOG SOLDIERS is one of the greatest horror films of all time,' and 'Up there with the classic horror movies,' you can only be setup for a letdown. It's a solid action/horror flick, and being those are few and far between, worth the viewing.

By sheer comparison alone, this makes Dog Soldiers an unexpected treat.This is a film made by a horror fan for horror fans. Much of the movie takes place at an isolated house in the woods (like Evil Dead) and involves a bunch of soldiers fighting off monsters (like Aliens or Predator). One of the characters is even named Bruce, a reference to Bruce Campbell. Even &quot;The Matrix&quot; is referenced in the movie, particularly in the last few scenes. And there's something about werewolves being in England... I just don't know, it's always money.The movie is very fast-paced and only slows down for some crucial plot points and minimal character development. I liked all the characters and the actors do a fine job of portraying them. However, I felt at first that everyone looked a lot alike and could only tell them apart once they started getting eaten, one by one.The werewolves don't look particularly realistic, but that didn't bother me. I guess I got used to it, and they still looked better than any CGI (i.e. An American Werewolf in Paris) I've ever seen. There is some moderate gore in the film, including lots of limbs being hacked off, and a decapitation.

Meanwhile, in another part of those woods Private Cooper (Kevin McKidd) is proving to Captain Ryan (Liam Cunningham) that he does not have what it takes to be part of Ryan's elite special operations force.  The bone of contention is being ordered to shoot a dog just because Ryan says so.  Ryan accuses Cooper of having a conscience, as if this is a bad thing in a military man.  But Cooper washes out and ends up back in the area some time later with the other members of his squad, under the command of Sgt. Wells (Sean Pertwee).  Around the campfire they hear about the local stories about people disappearing in the woods and never being found, which engenders a round of ""ooohs"" and ""aahs.""  Then they find Ryan's squad ripped to itsey bitsey pieces and the Captain just about over the edge and the hunt is on.  As this 2002's tagline tells us: ""Six soldiers. Full moon. No chance.""Well, that is not exactly true.  Once the squad finds Ryan they are up to seven and then there is Megan (Emma Cleasby), a scientist whose function is more as the mistress of exposition than as a damsel in distress.  In other words, she is the one who knows that there is a pack of lycanthropes (werewolves to ordinary folk) out there hunting the soldiers and has a good explanation for why they are holed up in a house without any silver in it.  Apparently the full moon matters even when the sun is up, and there are very few films of this type where it is literally true that nobody has a chance of getting out alive.  After all, Cooper has a few things to prove to Ryan before everybody ends up dead (although it is so strange to see McKidd look so talk after watching Titus Pullo tower over Lucius Vorenus all the time on ""Rome"").Werewolf movies often come down to how well you like the werewolves once you actually see them and get a good look at them, assuming this happens, and in ""Dog Soldiers"" writer-director Neil Marshall (""The Descent"") makes sure that happens.  Just keep in mind that this is a fairly low budget film and that Marshall was determined not to rely on CGI to make the werewolves work, because by those standards I think they exceed expectations.  Another thing that this movie does is avoid talking about werewolf movies, although everything from the ""Kobiashi Maru"" to the defense of Roark's Drift depicted in ""Zulu"" make there was into the pop culture references scattered throughout the film.  I really have not gotten to the point where I can cite a specific movie as being a really great werewolf film, and while ""Dog Soldiers"" is not great, I still think it is really good.My only real complaint is that things slow down a bit too much once they get to the house in the woods, because I really liked the whole idea of having a fire fight while retreating through the woods.  The appeal to me here is the whole idea of doing ""Aliens"" with werewolves as opposed to being trapped in the building and doing ""The Night of the Living Dead"" with werewolves (Yes, I know there is a point in ""Aliens"" where they are trapped as well, but that gets back to beating a hasty retreat and then a rescue mission, so I feel I can stand by my analogies).  When soldiers are the cornered rats instead of ordinary civilians, I would expect there to be some more significant differences.  Oh, and bonus points to Spoon (Darren Morfitt) for coming up with a really great line to say to a werewolf that is about to kill you and in case you really need to know the results of match, England beat Germany 5-1.",4,A training exercise for a squad of soldiers becomes a running battle with werewolves,1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,3636,"['couple', 'are', 'enjoying', 'romantic', 'seclusion', 'tent', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'when', 'werewolf', 'love', 'making', 'Meanwhile', 'part', 'woods', 'Private', 'Cooper', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'proving', 'Captain', 'Ryan', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'not', 'have', 'what', 'be', 'part', 'Ryan', 'elite', 'special', 'operations', 'force', 'bone', 'contention', 'being', 'ordered', 'shoot', 'dog', 'just', 'Ryan', 'so', 'Ryan', 'Cooper', 'having', 'conscience', 'bad', 'thing', 'military', 'man', 'Cooper', 'out', 'up', 'back', 'area', 'time', 'later', 'other', 'members', 'squad', 'command', 'Sgt', 'Wells', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'campfire', 'hear', 'local', 'stories', 'people', 'disappearing', 'woods', 'never', 'being', 'found', 'round', 'ooohs', 'aahs', 'Then', 'find', 'Ryan', 'squad', 'ripped', 'itsey', 'bitsey', 'pieces', 'Captain', 'just', 'about', 'edge', 'hunt', '2002', 'tagline', 'Six', 'soldiers', 'Full', 'moon', 'chance', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly', 'true', 'squad', 'Ryan', 'are', 'up', 'seven', 'then', 'Megan', 'Emma', 'Cleasby', 'scientist', 'function', 'more', 'mistress', 'exposition', 'damsel', 'distress', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'who', 'pack', 'lycanthropes', 'werewolves', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'there', 'hunting', 'soldiers', 'good', 'explanation', 'why', 'are', 'holed', 'up', 'house', 'silver', 'Apparently', 'full', 'moon', 'matters', 'even', 'when', 'sun', 'up', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'type', 'where', 'literally', 'true', 'nobody', 'chance', 'getting', 'out', 'alive', 'Cooper', 'few', 'things', 'prove', 'Ryan', 'everybody', 'up', 'dead', 'so', 'strange', 'see', 'McKidd', 'look', 'so', 'talk', 'watching', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'tower', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'time', 'Rome', '.Werewolf', 'movies', 'often', 'come', 'down', 'how', 'well', 'werewolves', 'once', 'actually', 'see', 'get', 'good', 'look', 'assuming', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'writer-director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'Descent', 'sure', 'Just', 'keep', 'mind', 'fairly', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'Marshall', 'was', 'determined', 'not', 'rely', 'CGI', 'make', 'werewolves', 'work', 'standards', 'think', 'exceed', 'expectations', 'thing', 'movie', 'avoid', 'talking', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'everything', 'Kobiashi', 'Maru', 'defense', 'Roark', 'Drift', 'depicted', 'Zulu', 'make', 'was', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'scattered', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'not', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'cite', 'specific', 'movie', 'being', 'really', 'great', 'werewolf', 'film', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'not', 'great', 'still', 'think', 'really', 'good.My', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'things', 'slow', 'down', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'get', 'house', 'woods', 'really', 'liked', 'whole', 'idea', 'having', 'fire', 'fight', 'retreating', 'woods', 'appeal', 'here', 'whole', 'idea', 'doing', 'Aliens', 'werewolves', 'opposed', 'being', 'trapped', 'building', 'doing', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'werewolves', 'Yes', 'know', 'point', 'Aliens', 'where', 'are', 'trapped', 'well', 'back', 'beating', 'hasty', 'retreat', 'then', 'rescue', 'mission', 'feel', 'can', 'stand', 'analogies', 'When', 'soldiers', 'are', 'cornered', 'rats', 'instead', 'ordinary', 'civilians', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'more', 'significant', 'differences', 'Oh', 'bonus', 'points', 'Spoon', 'Darren', 'Morfitt', 'coming', 'up', 'really', 'great', 'line', 'say', 'werewolf', 'kill', 'case', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'results', 'match', 'England', 'beat', 'Germany', '5-1']",N/A

Fortunately, two little jewels came out the last couple of years and changed my mind. Curiously, both came from outside the US, both were given poor theatrical releases and both have the potential to become cult classics. I'm talking, of course, about the canadian teen-gore ""Ginger Snaps"" and the British houndfest ""Dog Soldiers"".Unlike its Canadian fellow pack member, ""Dog Soldiers"" does not try to offer an analogy of puberty. This movie is simple, plain fun! Six soldiers trapped in a cabin in the woods (does it sound familiar?) must battle a pack of hungry beasts that see them as their next full moon meal. In the process, the soldiers too will have to become a pack in order to survive. With a lot of references to other horror movies, this flick blew me away mainly because of the energy that comes out of the screen. Its simple, yet effective, style of horror reminded me of the old black&white; monster films that were all about the visceral reaction that we had towards the creature, instead of relying on silly CGI graphics or actors taken fresh out of the cast of ""Buffy"". I can assure you that this movie will excite you, and if you enjoyed those classic monster flicks, then this is the one you want.As for the edition, it certainly could be better, but at least we were not left bare-boned like we did with ""Ginger Snaps"". We get a commentary track (sadly, not by the director), but it's something. The rest is pretty much the usual stuff (trailers and so on), with the possible exception of a 20-minute featurette that includes a number of interviews with writer/director Neil Marshall.

719622,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00006L91H,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this film a lot and for me it is the best werewolf movie since ""The howling"". Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.A squad of six British Army infantrymen (five simple soldiers and one sergeant) is dropped into the Scottish Highlands for a training wargame (they don't carry real munitions) in which they are supposed to play against an elite SAS unit. They are just six rather ordinary, quite likeable guys, who just want to complete the training (if possible winning) and go back in time to watch England vs. Germany football match. But then just the most annoying thing happens - their opponents, the SAS squad, are nowhere to be found... And I am not saying anything more.Now, most films about monsters/werewolves/mutants/aliens/creatures/entities/beings, etc. etc. confronting a small isolated group of heroes are very similar one to another and also frequently very bad because there is only a limited number of things you can do in a film like that. Neil Marshall, for whom it was the directorial debut, was quite aware of it and did all he could to make his film DIFFERENT from other werewolf movies. And he succeeded by using following tools:1. Humour. This film, even in its goriest moments, is EXTREMELY funny. Also, even if the language is strong and jokes sometimes fly rather low (those guy are after all professional soldiers) this film is never really obscene - in fact, all strong language notwithstanding, I actually didn't find it even really vulgar. Sorry for the little SPOILER here, but I simply have to say that - this film contains the first ever boxing match between and man and a werewolf and it is a GLORIOUS thing!2. Likeable heroes and good character development. The good idea was to make those guys in a bunch of rather brave fellows - the GREAT idea was to extend a little bit the introduction before the action, to allow us to know them a little. There is so many action or horror films in which you simply don't give a darn about who lives and who dies - well, here this is not the case. I actually really rooted for those guys and the more serious their situation became, the more concerned I was.3. Good, logical scenario. Other than the existence of werewolves most of things in this film actually make sense and heroes actually take rather logical, rational (albeit sometimes desperate) decisions - I couldn't really find any idiotic moves so typical for characters from lesser horror movies (always divide in small groups, bicker and fight instead of focusing on the survival, etc.)4. Clear vision and a strong control of the film by the director. Neil Marshall wanted an action/horror film with tons of humour, but certainly not a comedy or a parody - and he never allowed his actors to stray from this path. He also carefully avoided the typical pseudo-psychological clich&eacute;s which ruined so many action/horror films, like soldiers having meltdowns and getting crazy when under stress - in fact nothing helps to get a hold of yourself and focus better than adrenaline rush and a threat of imminent death... Also, he showed very well something that few other directors dared - that those who volunteer for military service actually can (sometimes, not always) enjoy a very hard fight and treat it as a challenge and even a source of fun, rather than something to cry about!5. Really scary werewolves. The opponents of the heroes are really mean, tough, resourceful and nasty - and visually the creatures present VERY WELL and the camera likes them! Honestly, if only they would hire a good agent, this Scottish werewolf family could make one helluva reality show on TV (after all, people watched the equally grim and scary Osbourns and Kardashians) ...)))6. A great, terrifying opening scene and a killer punch line at the very end...)))7. The inclusion of a tribute to the bravery of British soldiers who defended Rorke's Drift in 1879 against the Zulu and to a lesser extent to the sacrifice of Colonial Marines from ""Sulaco"" who in the future will face a swarm of xenomorphs on LV426...Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT action/horror film, I liked every and single scene and line of dialog in it and I will absolutely keep it for another viewing.

When I spotted the DVD here on amazon, I immediately ordered it.DOG SOLDIERS revolves around a squad of British soldiers on a training mission in the Scottish highlands. Soon strange things start happening. They encounter a badly wounded Special Operations officer, whom they take with them. Attacked by werewolves, the squad suffers the first casualties but manages to make a narrow escape with the help of a young woman. After reaching a remote farm, things turn from bad to worse when their car is destroyed by their devilish furry foes. Besieged, with no radio or phone connection, despairetly trying not to panick and running out of ammo, a fierce fight ensues with the almost invincible werewolves...WOW! WOW! And again WOW! To my point of view DOG SOLDIERS is one of the greatest horror films of all time, exceptionally well written, fastpaced with a strong storyline and likeable characters, who are not the mere monsterfodder as usual. You actually care for the sympathetic guys ( with the exception of the special operations officer ). It is a real pleasure to watch a fright flick without the usual cast of annoying teens. I also found it refreshing that DOG SOLDIERS lacks the silly humour considered indespensable by so many directors. The plot is very inventive and makes good use of the locations. DOG SOLDIERS is relatively violent and gory ( the disembowellment of the sergeant made me wince) but it is not splatter for splatter's sake. And a horror movie without CGI is a real viewing pleasure in itself.Some remarks on the DVD:You can choose between a widescreen and a fullframe presentation. As for extras, you have an audiocommentary, a featurette and two trailers, the international and the domestic one. The international one is widescreen, quite good, but gives away too much of the film, while the domestic one is presented fullscreen and doesn't do the film justice.",5,horror action rollercoaster ride,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,2023,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watch', 'DOG', 'SOLDIERS', 'ever', 'read', 'very', 'favorable', 'article', 'British', 'horror', 'film', 'magazine', 'When', 'spotted', 'DVD', 'here', 'amazon', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'it.DOG', 'SOLDIERS', 'squad', 'British', 'soldiers', 'training', 'mission', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'Soon', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'encounter', 'badly', 'wounded', 'Special', 'Operations', 'officer', 'whom', 'take', 'Attacked', 'werewolves', 'squad', 'first', 'casualties', 'make', 'narrow', 'escape', 'help', 'young', 'woman', 'reaching', 'remote', 'farm', 'things', 'turn', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'car', 'destroyed', 'devilish', 'furry', 'foes', 'Besieged', 'radio', 'phone', 'connection', 'despairetly', 'trying', 'not', 'panick', 'running', 'out', 'ammo', 'fierce', 'fight', 'ensues', 'almost', 'invincible', 'werewolves', 'WOW', 'WOW', 'again', 'WOW', 'point', 'view', 'DOG', 'SOLDIERS', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'written', 'fastpaced', 'strong', 'storyline', 'likeable', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'mere', 'monsterfodder', 'usual', 'actually', 'care', 'sympathetic', 'guys', 'exception', 'special', 'operations', 'officer', 'real', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'fright', 'flick', 'usual', 'cast', 'annoying', 'teens', 'also', 'found', 'refreshing', 'DOG', 'SOLDIERS', 'silly', 'humour', 'considered', 'indespensable', 'so', 'many', 'directors', 'plot', 'very', 'inventive', 'good', 'use', 'locations', 'DOG', 'SOLDIERS', 'relatively', 'violent', 'gory', 'disembowellment', 'sergeant', 'made', 'wince', 'not', 'splatter', 'splatter', 'sake', 'horror', 'movie', 'CGI', 'real', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'itself.Some', 'remarks', 'DVD', 'can', 'choose', 'widescreen', 'fullframe', 'presentation', 'extras', 'have', 'audiocommentary', 'featurette', 'two', 'trailers', 'international', 'domestic', 'one', 'international', 'one', 'widescreen', 'quite', 'good', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'domestic', 'one', 'presented', 'fullscreen', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'justice']",N/A
719625,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00006L91H,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[4, 6]","A handful of British soldiers on a training exercise in Scotland find a Special Forces that has been torn to shreds with their commanding officer (Liam Cunningham) badly wounded.  With sunset they find themselves under attack as well by something that kills men as easily as flies.  With their own sergeant nearly disemboweled (Sean Pertwee) the team struggles to escape.  They get some last minute help from a local woman (Emma Cleasby), who drives them to a nearby house.  Now, with no way to communicate out, and limited resources, they find themselves sitting on top of a werewolf nest and scheduled to become snacks.This is more of a desperate close combat film than an occult film.  Wolf and man plan tactics that almost inevitably end with another soldier in the larder.  Conventional weapons won't kill werewolves, and windows and doors don't stop them for very long.  The fighting is brutal and horrific with parts and innards flying.  The soldiers are tough and determined, but there is more going on than an accidental encounter with a backwoods family and there are secrets all around.For all that this is a non-stop action film, the acting and direction are spot on.  The viewer quickly falls into the soldier's cant and heavy British accents.  The filming is tight and claustrophobic adding to the tension and making the gory battles even more horrific.  Don't expect a lot of special effects either - there are few transformations, and cut scenes handle most of these.  This isn't a high budget glossy but as fine a nitty-gritty monster film as I've seen in a long time.

719631,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B00006L91H,Matthew King,"[5, 5]","Straight-to-video horror movies featuring big hairy creatures, like ""Sasquatch"" and ""Wendigo"" just to name a couple, are often an ill-advised way to spend a couple of hours.  Well, anyone expecting ""Dog Soldiers"" to fit into this category of execrable b-movie junk is in for a VERY pleasant surprise.  This is a high quality film in every sense of the way, the cinematography, the acting, the gore and even the hairy creatures themselves.  These werewolves are quick, merciless, menacing and not in the least bit cheesy-looking.  As a matter of fact there is nothing at all about this movie that is cheesy.In the wilderness of Scotland, 6 British soldiers are on a training mission and competing against a rival training squad, the special operations team.  Things take a turn for the bad when the crew discover the special Ops squad torn to bloody bits with only one survivor remaining.  Shortly after, they find themselves under attack from the wolves and lucky for them they have plenty of ammo to stave off the creatures for a bit.  A local woman in a Jeep stumbles upon the crew and drives them safely back to her cabin.  But is the cabin really safe or might it just be the heart of the lion's den?Many comparisons to other films have been made and I would have to agree that this film bears a significant resemblance to ""Predator"", with its wild wilderness setting and crew of militant types trying to survive against an unnatural creature lurking in the woods.  However in that classic film we all knew how things were going to end, with Arnie coming out victorious and riding into the sunset.  In ""Dog Soldiers"" everything is fair game and it's anyone's guess as to who, if anyone, might survive.  The cast is amazing and they are much more than fodder which really has us caring about them.  Among the most fascinating characters are the Sergeant, a man with a mean streak but who knows what it takes to motivate his squad, Lieutenant Cooper, a fresh-faced hotshot, and especially Meagan, the lone female figure in the film.  She is an attractive woman who shows more gall and guts than any of the rest of the crew and it is this combination of rigidity and feminism that gives her such an endearing presence.There's so many things that make ""Dog Soldiers"" a great horror film; the gorgeous scenery, non-stop action, generous amounts of gore but what elevates it over other great action-horror pictures is that not only is it full of suspense but full of intrigue as well.  There are many interesting plot developments and also a surprise twist near the ending.  In a sea of mediocre horror cheapies, ""Dog Soldiers"" truly stands out.",5,Achtung!

As good as those mythical ""B-Class"" from the Forties and Fifties I used to enjoy in chilling (yet hot summer afternoons) when I was a kid.This film has everything to fulfill its target: decent storyline, solid acting from little known actors, some gallons of blood & entrails disseminated all the way long, giant werewolves and a full moon night.What else do you need?  Ah yes, a good director who enjoys the genre. Well Neil Marshall is just THAT kind of director.The story is quite simple. A British Army patrol is sent into a training mission where they should outsmart a SAS patrol in a Scottish Wilderness landscape.Sgt. H. G. Wells (sic) is the leader and Pvt. Cooper is the tough man of the outfit. This last almost succeed to enter the SAS, but he failed as he refuses to kill a dog gratuitously (you should never refuse to do that if you want to be an SS member. Remember?).They find the SAS outfit... obliterated to small red morsels. Only the commanding officer has barely survived with deep wounds.Now, guess what... yes the officer is the one that rejected Cooper. Sgt. Wells immediately realizes that they are in deep problems and try to fly.Too late!The Werewolves are there!They barely escape thanks to Megan's aid. She is a biologist that has studied the Wolfies. She led the fleeing soldiers to an isolated farm.The Wolves burn their car and the farm turns into a British Alamo or a Rorke's Drift Mission as Pvt. Spoon point out.Well the fact is they should try to survive until dawn and the howling crowd will try to have them for dinner.So that's THAT, enough to have a rough gory two hours pastime.Play acting is real good with Sean Pertwee as Sgt. Wells very believable and accurate. Scotsman Kevin McKidd as Pvt. Cooper gives his best. The rest of the cast is equally fine.Director Neil Marshall shows to have a good hand for this kind of stuff and delivers a solid film.It is a very good horror movie for genre fans!Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,The Werewolves Attack British Army!,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,2018,"['Dog', 'Soldiers', '2002', 'extraordinary', 'class', 'B', 'film', 'As', 'good', 'mythical', 'B-Class', 'Forties', 'Fifties', 'used', 'enjoy', 'chilling', 'yet', 'hot', 'summer', 'afternoons', 'when', 'was', 'kid.This', 'film', 'everything', 'fulfill', 'target', 'decent', 'storyline', 'solid', 'acting', 'little', 'known', 'actors', 'gallons', 'blood', 'entrails', 'disseminated', 'way', 'long', 'giant', 'werewolves', 'full', 'moon', 'night.What', 'else', 'do', 'need', 'Ah', 'yes', 'good', 'director', 'who', 'genre', 'Well', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'just', 'kind', 'director.The', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'British', 'Army', 'patrol', 'sent', 'training', 'mission', 'where', 'should', 'outsmart', 'SAS', 'patrol', 'Scottish', 'Wilderness', 'landscape.Sgt', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'sic', 'leader', 'Pvt', 'Cooper', 'tough', 'man', 'outfit', 'last', 'almost', 'succeed', 'enter', 'SAS', 'failed', 'kill', 'dog', 'gratuitously', 'should', 'never', 'refuse', 'do', 'want', 'be', 'SS', 'member', 'Remember', '.They', 'find', 'SAS', 'outfit', 'obliterated', 'small', 'red', 'morsels', 'Only', 'commanding', 'officer', 'barely', 'survived', 'deep', 'wounds.Now', 'guess', 'what', 'officer', 'one', 'rejected', 'Cooper', 'Sgt', 'Wells', 'immediately', 'are', 'deep', 'problems', 'try', 'fly.Too', 'late', 'Werewolves', 'are', 'there', 'barely', 'escape', 'thanks', 'Megan', 'aid', 'biologist', 'studied', 'Wolfies', 'led', 'fleeing', 'soldiers', 'isolated', 'farm.The', 'Wolves', 'burn', 'car', 'farm', 'British', 'Alamo', 'Rorke', 'Drift', 'Mission', 'Pvt', 'Spoon', 'point', 'out.Well', 'fact', 'should', 'try', 'survive', 'dawn', 'howling', 'crowd', 'will', 'try', 'have', 'dinner.So', 'THAT', 'enough', 'have', 'rough', 'gory', 'two', 'hours', 'pastime.Play', 'acting', 'real', 'good', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'Sgt', 'Wells', 'very', 'believable', 'accurate', 'Scotsman', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'Pvt', 'Cooper', 'best', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'fine.Director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'have', 'good', 'hand', 'kind', 'stuff', 'solid', 'film.It', 'very', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'genre', 'fans', 'Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",N/A

719642,A2X68A4CORTII2,B00006L91H,Monkey Deathcar,"[10, 11]","Having seen the DVD in Blockbuster a few times, I was a little skeptical of this movie. For some reason I expected it to be unwatchably low-budget and/or very cheesy, direct-to-video schlock. Got to say, having watched it twice in the week I rented it, I was very pleasantly surprised by ""Dog Soldiers.""You all know the plot so let me tell you what I liked about the film:The movie is surprisingly well-acted and scripted for a horror film. There are several very strong acting performances throughout, and even when the dialogue is bad it's typically tongue-in-cheek bad-good. Most often when I watch horror movies, the ""characters"" are really zombie food. In ""Dog Solidiers"" I found myself rooting for the good guys to survive, particularly Cooper and Spoon (sorry, don't have the names handy). Ryan is also a very arrogant and hateable villain.The film has a very sharp sense of humor, sometimes in the dialogue and other times in the ridiculous, over-the-top action. But unlike say ""Evil Dead 2"", ""Dog Soldiers"" doesn't beat you over the head trying to be funny. More often it's a dry wit that breaks the tension during some of the action/horror scenes.And, the movie looks great. When I first popped it on I was a little put off by the slightly blurry, ""Masterpiece Theater"" type film stock. But as the film moved on, I was really impressed with the atmophere and fast-paced was the action and violent scenes are filmed. Some of them are quick edited almost like Hong Kong cinema. The farmhouse, out in a secluded patch of fog-drenched woods, recalls the moody look and feel of both ""Evil Dead"" films. And the werewolves may not be top notch, but they are not far from the monsters in ""The Howling"" and in my opinion they were pretty damn impressive for a low budget film.If you're into more slick, mainstream horror films you may not like this.

I asked him to let me know if it ever came in and the next time it did, he gave me a call.  He promised that if I did NOT like the movie, he would give me money back (instead of trade).  Was I ever surprised.  What a wonderful horror flick that wasn't too gorey or with too heavy a story line.  Some great acting by unknowns (to me anyway) and excellent special effects for a low budget enterprise.  You've read the storyline in other reviews, so I won't bore you with my interpretation.

Carnegie,"[4, 5]","Centring around a group of British soldiers on exercise in a remote wooded part of the Scottish highlands, Dog Soldiers is a return to the Hammer House of Horror tradition of film-making. Directed and written by Neil Marshall it is as entertaining as it is cheap, even if the seams sometimes show. Dog Soldiers opens with a Scottish soldier by the name of Cooper (Kevin McKidd) failing his special forces entrance exam by merit of the fact he wont shoot an innocent and harmless dog when ordered to do so by his commanding officer, Captain Ryan (Thomas Lockyer). Busted back to his own section of the regular army he is then sent on an exercise against the very same special forces that had only recently knocked him back. However, as fate would have it the special forces become dog food (quite literally), with the exception of the dastardly Captain Ryan and the regular army platoon led by Sergeant Wills (Sean) Pertwee have to seek refuge in a rickety farmhouse cut off from civilisation. I bought this DVD on the strength of the press reviews Id read around the time off its theatrical release. Shot on a low budget in Luxembourg and partly funded by the Luxembourg film foundation Dog Soldiers is as inventive and entertaining as it is cheap...Writer-director Neil Marshall draws on the art of suspense and for the most part leaves the werewolves in the shadows, which is probably just as well, because by todays modern standards the effects are definitely pretty suspect. Dog Soldiers also offers plenty of dark comedy. For example there is a scene where Sean Pertwee wrestles with a border collie over the blood soaked bandages which are the only thing holding in his intestines and another scene where Kevin McKidd tries unsuccessfully to knock Pertwee out with his fist as some form of anaesthetic. The dialogue may not always be subtle and is perhaps best described as patchy but it also has its high points with Pertwee and Mc.Kidd grabbing many of the best lines;...There is some gore too but not too much and what gore there is, is mixed with humour as witnessed by Wills being instructed by Cooper to push his overflowing intestines back into his torn body;...Okay, so the soundtrack to the movie is pretty dodgy and old fashioned too, evoking images of an organist in a cinema playing along to the images on screen as in bygone days but with the limited budget Dog Soldiers is undoubtedly still a triumph for the power of creativity over budget. It has a good cast too. In particular Sean Pertwee (Event Horizon) and Kevin McKidd shine but it also has good supporting performances. This may be cheap but it's still among the most watchable British movies of recent years and its a change to see a hit British movie that doesnt feature either Hugh Grant or period costume drama...",4,A HOWLING SUCCESS?,1049500800,"04 5, 2003",2003,2795,"['Centring', 'group', 'British', 'soldiers', 'exercise', 'remote', 'wooded', 'part', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'return', 'Hammer', 'House', 'Horror', 'tradition', 'film-making', 'Directed', 'written', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'as', 'entertaining', 'cheap', 'even', 'seams', 'sometimes', 'show', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'Scottish', 'soldier', 'name', 'Cooper', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'failing', 'special', 'forces', 'entrance', 'exam', 'merit', 'fact', 'wont', 'shoot', 'innocent', 'harmless', 'dog', 'when', 'ordered', 'do', 'so', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Captain', 'Ryan', 'Thomas', 'Lockyer', 'Busted', 'back', 'own', 'section', 'regular', 'army', 'then', 'sent', 'exercise', 'very', 'same', 'special', 'forces', 'had', 'only', 'recently', 'knocked', 'back', 'However', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'special', 'forces', 'become', 'dog', 'food', 'quite', 'literally', 'exception', 'dastardly', 'Captain', 'Ryan', 'regular', 'army', 'platoon', 'led', 'Sergeant', 'Wills', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'have', 'seek', 'refuge', 'rickety', 'farmhouse', 'cut', 'off', 'civilisation', 'bought', 'DVD', 'strength', 'press', 'Id', 'read', 'time', 'off', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Shot', 'low', 'budget', 'Luxembourg', 'partly', 'funded', 'Luxembourg', 'film', 'foundation', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'inventive', 'entertaining', 'cheap', 'Writer-director', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'art', 'suspense', 'most', 'part', 'werewolves', 'shadows', 'probably', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'todays', 'modern', 'standards', 'effects', 'are', 'definitely', 'pretty', 'suspect', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'also', 'plenty', 'dark', 'comedy', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'border', 'collie', 'blood', 'soaked', 'bandages', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'holding', 'intestines', 'scene', 'where', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'unsuccessfully', 'knock', 'Pertwee', 'out', 'fist', 'form', 'anaesthetic', 'dialogue', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'subtle', 'perhaps', 'best', 'described', 'patchy', 'also', 'high', 'points', 'Pertwee', 'Mc.Kidd', 'grabbing', 'many', 'best', 'lines', 'gore', 'too', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'gore', 'mixed', 'humour', 'witnessed', 'Wills', 'being', 'instructed', 'Cooper', 'push', 'overflowing', 'intestines', 'back', 'torn', 'body', 'Okay', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'pretty', 'dodgy', 'old', 'fashioned', 'too', 'evoking', 'images', 'organist', 'cinema', 'playing', 'along', 'images', 'screen', 'bygone', 'days', 'limited', 'budget', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'undoubtedly', 'still', 'triumph', 'power', 'creativity', 'budget', 'good', 'cast', 'too', 'particular', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'shine', 'also', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'may', 'be', 'cheap', 'still', 'most', 'watchable', 'British', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'change', 'see', 'hit', 'British', 'movie', 'feature', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'period', 'costume', 'drama']",N/A

The story revolves around a team of soldiers on a training mission trying to survive the night in an old farmhouse while a pack of vicious werewolves stalk them in the night.  The werewolves themselves and special makeup effects may seem primitive to the novice horror viewer, but they are a refreshing treat to horror fans who are sick of over the top computer generated effects.  The cast of relative unknown actors (Sean Pertwee of Event Horizon is the only actor I recognized) are very solid and convincing; they are believeably horrified and scared of the situation while trying to find a way out.

I always found werewolves to be the scariest of all, and whenever I get the chance, I'll watch a werewolf flick. This was my latest 'wolf catch, and it held its own against the bloated multimillion dollar flicks Hollywood's s*itting out these days.Would I call it a B-Movie? No. B-Movies usually suck. This movie did not suck, and unlike most B-Movies, the actors could actually act. It disappoints me that not at least one of them has gotten big.But now for the plot. A group of Scottish troops are dropped off in the woods for a training mission, and are first spooked when a huge bloody cow falls (seemingly) from the sky, right in the middle of them. They then take extra precaution as they walk about the woods, and eventually run into a small area filled with organs and blood. A half dead soldier with slash marks in his chest and repeatidly tells them &quot;there was only supposed to be one&quot;. Of course, none of the soliders know what he's talking about, and carry on, not minding the fact that &quot;it gets dark in half in hour&quot;. But when it gets dark, well...you'll have to watch it yourself.The werewolves in this movie do look believable. Each is about 8 foot tall, which is the only part about them I didn't like. I human-sized werewolves more...it just adds to the creepiness of the half man/half wolf thing. But, as I was saying, the werewolves aren't super real looking, but I'd run my ass out of the woods if I saw one in there.This is quite a gory little movie. Not the goriest I've ever seen, but it still is bloody. Organs spill out, arms are ripped off, devouring, etc. And it all looks pretty real, too, except for the part the werewolf claws the guy and his chest is open, exposing all his organs. And it was also a little unbelievable how his friend just shoved his organs back in his chest, threw him over his back, and he was OK. That's my only complaint. And don't get the wrong idea that the whole point of this movie is gore; unlike the new &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, there is a sense of dread and foreboding that builds up while a solider makes his way upstairs in an old abandoned house. The gore is just a bonus.So, if you want a revolutionay movie, don't see this. But if you're sick of all the bloated Hollywood bulls*it, check out this gory little romp.

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[1, 1]","Solid horror flick from the UK that was only released straight-to-DVD in the US, this is Neil Marshall's first film before The Descent.Very refreshing to see a new take on an old genre (werewolves) with a modern setting and sharp direction.  A section of British army soldiers are on a training mission in the Scottish Highlands when they run into a species of modern werewolves.  Like many a genre piece, this borrows from a number of familiar movies (Aliens, Predator, Assault on Precinct 13, etc) and gives it a fresh spin.  The accents, the lack of stars or even known actors, the remote Scottish setting---and good use of a low budget.  Importantly, the wolves are not CGI-heavy, but rather animatronics, suits and stilts.  They look like the beast f from American Werewolf in London, walking upright and quite nasty, with long, hairy arms.  Without so much CGI madness, the filmmakers have to actually use, you know, talent to make the film effective.  The soldiers are in the Aliens-situation, crossed with Assault on Precinct 13 as they eventually hold up in an abandoned cottage while the beasts attack.  A few twists along the way make it even better, this is a pretty creepy little film.Apparently a sequel is on the way, hopefully they'll learn what made the first film so enjoyable and not overdo it.

But I of all people probably don't like the movie that much for the lamest reasons(and I hope I don't get negative response from someone the next time they review this film).  Ok I happend to rent this film this weekend cause I read some of your reviews.  I will say this...This film is better then the other crap(I.e American Werewolf in Londen ect...Yeah I didn't like that movie at all...pure crap)I've seen.  I must say the plot was ok(though I wasn't expecting a brilliant plot of course).  As most of you have said which are right, the dialoug is pretty damn good especially parts comming from the Main Character(He was the toughest of em' all).  But like I said Overall I really enjoyed this film.  Ok...Why did I give this 3 stars?... Well lets get to it.1. The movie was a tad bit boring.  It was for me.  It really was but later it picks up the pace.  But that's one of them..2. OK OK OK..I'm sorry but I've read a few reviews saying ""man this film is gory!  Gooorrrry!""  Are you kidding me?  Seriously?...  OK first off.  Yes people who haven't seen it and plan on seeing it, yes This film has organs and this and that showing.  But If you're expecting..SPOILERS AHEAD..If you're expecting men getting attacked in pack and literaly seeing them get there stomach ripped open(Dawn of the Dead Style) and arms torn off while gutts and blood is splattering everywere...Look somewere els cause you won't be expecting that.

The general premise is keen: soldiers in training running into the proverbial big bad wolf. The cinematography and overall directing was handled with able and insightful creativity. The acting was passable and even top-notch in some regards. The special effects were, if not flawless, respectably well done. In short, the film had several positive things going for it. My criticisms of the film center around its screenplay and its corresponding believability: while the general premise may have been quite engaging, the way that the story unfolded and ultimately resolved left me thinking that the creators of the film weren't too sure of where, or what, their film wanted to be. Was it a combat piece? People under siege? A mystery, a political thriller, in the making? I think a part of this uneven feel of the film is due to a conscious effort on the parts of the filmmakers to instill a nervousness or anxiety in the audience, which is great, but when the end credits began to roll, and it registered that the film had ended, I found myself wondering what in the world I had just witnessed, watched.

Well, that's fair if you think that it's fair to compare 3 great movies with big budgets (okay so Jaws wasn't that big) to a movie that's bad with a budget that entailed only the costs of filming and some B actors.The special effects in Dog Soldiers are minimal. There isn't even an on-camera werewolf transformation. And all the werewolves look like actors wearing theme park style animal character costumes.But the story was pretty good and kept me watching all the way through. A group of soldiers out in a Scotland forest on a training mission find real trouble when they run into an area inhabited by werewolves.The acting is fair. The best performance is that by Kevin McKidd now popular for his portrayal of Lucius Vorenus in HBO's series Rome.

You've got an excellent script, marvelous cast, cinematography that's beautiful and creepy and real(you know what I mean) werewolves, not CG creations.  The characters are wonderfully developed and we care about them easily and quickly which is good because the action comes fast and frenzied.  I know someone said the werewolves were CG, but they aren't, they are actors in anamatronic suits, like the raptors of Jurassic Park 3.  (Someone didn't watch the Featurette.)Okay, so what you have is a platoon dropped into the Scottish highlands on a weekend exercise, routine right, nope. Somethings afoot, but I'm not going to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that while they're complaining about being &#34;up the backside of nowhere&#34; things begin to unravel and the men are forced to deal with the fact that they have suddenly been put on the menu by a family of local lycanthropes.  It's been called Zulu with werewolves, or Rourke's Drift in the UK.  Zulu, true story of a small command of men, 100, who faced down 10,000 Zulu warriors in the 1800's and survived, another good show with a very young Michale Caine.  As Spoon put's it: &#34;Balls of British Steel.&#34;Regardless, you have a movie that's funnier than American Werewolf in London(IMHO), some good chills, blood and guts, enduring characters and a movie you wish wouldn't end quite so soon.  We have found ourselves talking about wishing they'd do a sequel, but without the same cast the magic would be missing, because truly it's the cast and the script that make this so good.

Locally it's a bit of a mystery but HM Forces special weapons division (that's presumably approximately the same types who give Sigourney Weaver so much grief in the `Alien' films) have their sources. They know it's werewolves and they want one. SO they send in a special forces unit. They also send in a platoon of regular expendable low grade squaddies to act as bait, primed with the usual tosh about it all being an exercise. Needless to say its special forces who get eaten more or less straight away leaving us with a straight squaddies versus werewolves showdown. After a brilliant battlescene in the woods they are rescued by a woman in a landrover and taken off to the glen's only farmhouse. The nearest town, they are told, is Fort William which is four hours drive away. (Anal observation: as a look at a map of Scotland will confirm, this is geographically impossible and there is nowhere that matches that description unless you drive very slowly indeed. But never mind.) The farm's inhabitant's are unaccountably not at home, all except their nice doggie. The sergeant (Sean Pertwee who steals the movie) has had his insides ripped out by a werewolf but all is not lost as they have adequate supplies of whisky and superglue.What follows is a classic siege movie directly in the tradition of `Rio Bravo', `Night of the Living Dead' and `Assault on Precinct 13'. And it's as good as any of these, an absolute triumph, the best British horror movie in ages and one of the very best werewolf movies there is. Indeed it's not just a great horror movie but a great action movie too. It was clearly made on a budget of almost nothing with no big name actors and shamelessly weak special effects. No cgi here, the werewolves are just guys dressed up in not very convincing wolf suits but the direction, acting  and extremely witty writing are so good it doesn't matter in the least. The low budget indeed is turned to the film's advantage as it comes over feeling gritty and real, where thematically comparable Hollywood explosion fests seem, in comparison, smooth, soulless and anodyne (as indeed they typically are.)`We are now up against live, hostile targets.

719690,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B00006L91H,Stuart Conover,"[2, 2]","Neil Marshall wrote and directed this lower budgeted Werewolf masterpiece. I saw this with a straight face as usually I cannot stand movies that involve werewolves. I would go so far as to say that the majority of werewolf movies I actually cannot fully pay attention the entire movie due to boredom. Neil though has hit it on the head in what makes this kind of a film work.Before ""Rome"" Kevin McKidd wasn't quite yet a household name. Actually he still isn't quite a household name but the man's acting is superb and as he plays Pvt. Cooper as the lead in this film you could see even at this time that he is an actor to watch.The premise of the film is that Cooper failed out of a special operations unit due to having too high of a morality level for what was being asked of him. He had the skills just did not have the ability to blindly kill anyone who he is ordered too. Being back in the regular military he is sent on a training mission in Scottland to test his unit's skills and are actually being pitted against the Special Ops Squad he was denied from.The first night of the outing we are shown that the Special Ops team is attacked and Cooper's team stumbles across them completely slaughtered short of the team leader who is badly wounded and partially in shock. Our characters are immediately thrown on the run and where will you run for safety in a forest? A cabin in the woods! While that is the first choice they are actually picked up as hitchhikers by a woman in the area. Actually it's a house but it feels styled as if it were a cabin. Perfect for any forest themed horror film and the bonus is that they reach it at nightfall so have to deal with not only a being stuck in a cabin and surrounded by werewolves - but in the dark as well.Once we are in the house the soldiers barricade themselves in to try and wait out the werewolves or plan a way out. We get interaction between the soldiers and learn that the special ops unit knew about the wolves ahead of time and had an agenda of their own. We further discover that the woman who picked them up also has secrets as she studies lycanthropes and has had dealing with the special ops unit in the past as a `specialist' on the subject. Plans for waiting out the attack are shot down as the wolves constantly attack the house itself, breaking through their defenses and being fought off. Each attack though has causalities and as the soldiers numbers dwindle they finalize a plan to escape.The movie has a style reminiscent of Evil Dead and not in a cheesy way or the feel of the film itself but more in the look and lighting of many of the scenes. The `cabin in the woods' idea also helped stress this Evil Dead feel as well as monsters that are rarely shown on screen or only partially shown. While the wolves aren't shown in full that often - when they are and you can tell that is where quite a bit of the budget went into. I wish more people could learn from movies such as this that CGI is overrated and props and costumes ARE the way to go for that extra bit of realistic feel. I have to say this was truly a fun movie and as someone who usually can't stand a werewolf movie this might be better suggested to fans of horror who don't usually like what they do with this style of film. It's partially a werewolf film, partially a war movie, and horror all the way through.",4,I rarely enjoy werewolf movies and i LOVED this one!,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,3351,"['Neil', 'Marshall', 'wrote', 'directed', 'lower', 'budgeted', 'Werewolf', 'masterpiece', 'saw', 'straight', 'face', 'usually', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'movies', 'involve', 'werewolves', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'majority', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'actually', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'pay', 'attention', 'entire', 'movie', 'due', 'boredom', 'Neil', 'hit', 'head', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'Rome', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'yet', 'household', 'name', 'Actually', 'still', ""n't"", 'quite', 'household', 'name', 'man', 'acting', 'superb', 'Pvt', 'Cooper', 'lead', 'film', 'could', 'see', 'even', 'time', 'actor', 'watch.The', 'premise', 'film', 'Cooper', 'failed', 'special', 'operations', 'unit', 'due', 'having', 'too', 'high', 'morality', 'level', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'asked', 'had', 'skills', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'ability', 'blindly', 'kill', 'anyone', 'who', 'ordered', 'too', 'Being', 'back', 'regular', 'military', 'sent', 'training', 'mission', 'Scottland', 'test', 'unit', 'skills', 'are', 'actually', 'being', 'pitted', 'Special', 'Ops', 'Squad', 'was', 'denied', 'from.The', 'first', 'night', 'outing', 'are', 'shown', 'Special', 'Ops', 'team', 'attacked', 'Cooper', 'team', 'stumbles', 'completely', 'slaughtered', 'short', 'team', 'leader', 'who', 'badly', 'wounded', 'partially', 'shock', 'characters', 'are', 'immediately', 'thrown', 'run', 'where', 'will', 'run', 'safety', 'forest', 'cabin', 'woods', 'first', 'choice', 'are', 'actually', 'picked', 'up', 'hitchhikers', 'woman', 'area', 'Actually', 'house', 'styled', 'were', 'cabin', 'Perfect', 'forest', 'themed', 'horror', 'film', 'bonus', 'reach', 'nightfall', 'so', 'have', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'stuck', 'cabin', 'surrounded', 'werewolves', 'dark', 'well.Once', 'are', 'house', 'soldiers', 'barricade', 'try', 'wait', 'out', 'werewolves', 'plan', 'way', 'get', 'interaction', 'soldiers', 'learn', 'special', 'ops', 'unit', 'knew', 'wolves', 'ahead', 'time', 'had', 'agenda', 'own', 'further', 'discover', 'woman', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'also', 'secrets', 'studies', 'lycanthropes', 'had', 'dealing', 'special', 'ops', 'unit', 'past', 'specialist', 'subject', 'Plans', 'waiting', 'out', 'attack', 'are', 'shot', 'down', 'wolves', 'constantly', 'attack', 'house', 'breaking', 'defenses', 'being', 'fought', 'off', 'attack', 'causalities', 'soldiers', 'numbers', 'dwindle', 'finalize', 'plan', 'escape.The', 'movie', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'not', 'cheesy', 'way', 'feel', 'film', 'more', 'look', 'lighting', 'many', 'scenes', 'cabin', 'woods', 'idea', 'also', 'helped', 'stress', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'monsters', 'are', 'rarely', 'shown', 'screen', 'only', 'partially', 'shown', 'wolves', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'full', 'often', 'when', 'are', 'can', 'tell', 'where', 'quite', 'bit', 'budget', 'went', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'could', 'learn', 'movies', 'such', 'CGI', 'overrated', 'props', 'costumes', 'ARE', 'way', 'go', 'extra', 'bit', 'realistic', 'feel', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'truly', 'fun', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'usually', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'suggested', 'fans', 'horror', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'what', 'do', 'style', 'film', 'partially', 'werewolf', 'film', 'partially', 'war', 'movie', 'horror', 'way']",N/A

After a long line of direct to video junk, Dog Soldiers arrived and made werewolves dangerous again.  I was so sick of werewolves that looked like hippies with hair on the backs of their hands.  The werewolves in Dog Soldiers are big, nasty, and their attacks are terrible to behold.  I am not sure if any CGI was used.  It looked like old style makeup applications and full body prosthetics.  Brilliant work by the effects people.The plot revolves around a team of Scottish soldiers out on maneuvers and preparing to be the prey of a superior special ops team's war games.  Turns out the other, &quot;superior&quot; team has become lunch for a pack of werewolves.  The team spends the rest of the film fighting their way to a cabin and holding off the pack while trying to figure out an escape route.  Very intense with few stops for a gulp of air.  Granted, the movie starts slow as we meet the team, which are hard to tell apart since they all have shaved heads and talk with such thick accents they sound identical.As I said, the werewolves are vicious, and the film is pretty gory.  The sets and outdoor environs as gritty, dirty, muddy, and the movie's color pallet can be diluted down to gray and red.  Fittingly the same colors from the cover graphic!The DVD features an audio commentary and a making-of featurette.  The music on the menu screen absolutely rocks.  Both widescreen and full screen are both presented on one disk.  An excellent choice for any werewolf fan as well as action fans.

Going beyond the normal tones that finds one werewolf hunting down someone/a bunch of someones that can't properly defend themselves, this film showcases a plethora of those less-than-loving lycanthropes as they play with people that have an armada of lead (not exactly silver, but suitable when one wants to run) at their disposal. In fact, I went ahead and watched it more than once as it replayed, finding the little quips of humor entertaining and the characters interesting, plus the gore in the movie called me to it.As far as the reasoning behind the movie itself, a headline showcased in the movie as a cheesy tabloidesque, ""Werewolves ate my platoon,"" seems to sum up quite a bit of the action and the interaction in this movie. Here, a group of soldiers out on what are supposedly routine field maneuvers in the Scotish Highlands happen into something of a very precarious situation that has more than their guns (filled with blanks at this point) can stave off. In an area that has been known for some rather grizzly happenings, they find themselves first bonding themselves as people and not disposable characters through scenes that grow increasingly dark, until they suddenly find themselves plunged into the midst of what appears to be the scene of carnage, acquiring some firepower in the process, caused by a pack of werewolves. Running for their lives, they discover really quickly exactly what that can mean for anyone wanting to survive, happen across a seemingly kind stranger that takes them to the only home within ""50 meters as the crow flys"" and saving their immediate lives. That's when everything gets interesting, though, because how does one keep a something that isn't supposed to exist at all at bay while trying to survive through the night?Interestingly portrayed as a combination of many a great movie, Dog Soldiers is nonetheless something original in its own right because of the way it showcases werewolves and is furthered because it sports a cast that was actually really charismatic. The werewolves also looked rather nice, and the graphic portrayal of violence that they inflicted upon poor unfortunates was welcome in my world.

719702,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00006L91H,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 2]","This is a good, old-fashioned horror film using the popular theme of werewolves, with added modern taste of very dark humor.  Sam Raimi, whose &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; will come up instantly after seeing this one, started his career like Neil Marshall, first time director whose talent is undeniable.&quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; is in fact very scary when it wants to be, but I must tell you that the story is nothing new.  Six soldiers are on weedend exercise deep in woods of Scotland, led by Sergeant Wells (excellent Sean Pertwee).  But it soon gets clear that they are watched by someone else, not only by cold-hearted special opreation division captain, but someone more superhuman that would turn the routine work into nightmare.The story goes as you expect -- someone joins in the group while hunted down, while they are captured one by one in a bloody fashion.  The film's strength is in its balanced pace and skilled shock-tactics, some of which go beyond our expectations.  See how Sgt. Wells has to endure the pain with superglue, and how a dog annoys him, biting some part of his body.  Even directors of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; wouldn't think of that idea, which makes you either laugh or sick.The actors are comparatively unknown, but the fact helps because you don't know who will survive.  The acting is all convincing and strong.  Actually, Sean Pertwee should be more famous; he stared in cult British film &quot;Blue Juice,&quot; but unluckily the co-starring, then unknown guy named Ewan McGregor gets more famous (even if Sean, Ewan, Jude Law, Jonny Lee Miller, and Sadie Frost are the members of their company Natural Nylon Films).Within the low-budget limits, &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; shows very good quality of images, make-ups and sound effects, and the monsters themselves are fairly authentic without using the CGIs, supported by tactful lighting and camera angle.  The film is recommended not only for genre fans but for the thrill-seekers in general.",4,"Bloody Fight, Soldiers vs Monsters; Well-Made Horror",1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,1990,"['good', 'old-fashioned', 'horror', 'film', 'using', 'popular', 'theme', 'werewolves', 'added', 'modern', 'taste', 'very', 'dark', 'humor', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'quot', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'quot', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'instantly', 'seeing', 'one', 'started', 'career', 'Neil', 'Marshall', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'talent', 'undeniable.', 'quot', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'fact', 'very', 'scary', 'when', 'be', 'must', 'tell', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'Six', 'soldiers', 'are', 'weedend', 'exercise', 'deep', 'woods', 'Scotland', 'led', 'Sergeant', 'Wells', 'excellent', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'soon', 'clear', 'are', 'watched', 'someone', 'else', 'not', 'only', 'cold-hearted', 'special', 'opreation', 'division', 'captain', 'someone', 'more', 'superhuman', 'would', 'turn', 'routine', 'work', 'nightmare.The', 'story', 'expect', 'someone', 'group', 'hunted', 'down', 'are', 'captured', 'one', 'one', 'bloody', 'fashion', 'film', 'strength', 'balanced', 'pace', 'skilled', 'shock-tactics', 'go', 'expectations', 'See', 'how', 'Sgt', 'Wells', 'endure', 'pain', 'superglue', 'how', 'dog', 'biting', 'part', 'body', 'Even', 'directors', 'quot', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'quot', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'idea', 'sick.The', 'actors', 'are', 'comparatively', 'unknown', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'will', 'survive', 'acting', 'convincing', 'strong', 'Actually', 'Sean', 'Pertwee', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'famous', 'stared', 'cult', 'British', 'film', 'quot', 'Blue', 'Juice', 'quot', 'unluckily', 'co-starring', 'then', 'unknown', 'guy', 'named', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'more', 'famous', 'even', 'Sean', 'Ewan', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Sadie', 'Frost', 'are', 'members', 'company', 'Natural', 'Nylon', 'Films', '.Within', 'low-budget', 'limits', 'quot', 'Dog', 'Soldiers', 'quot', 'very', 'good', 'quality', 'images', 'make-ups', 'sound', 'effects', 'monsters', 'are', 'fairly', 'authentic', 'using', 'CGIs', 'supported', 'tactful', 'lighting', 'camera', 'angle', 'film', 'recommended', 'not', 'only', 'genre', 'fans', 'thrill-seekers', 'general']",N/A
719703,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00006L91H,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[8, 9]","After watching THE DESCENT earlier in 2006, I learned that that the director of that film, Neil Marshall, had made one previous ""major"" motion picture:  DOG SOLDIERS.  I had never heard of the film before because it wasn't shown in very many theatres in the U.S.  I was so impressed with THE DESCENT that I was determined to find a copy of DOG SOLDIERS and view it.DOG SOLDIERS is categorized as a horror movie because of gothic elements involved in the film.  A special group of British soldiers is sent to Scotland to play a type of war games with a Special Operations squad.  The regular soldiers discover the mutilated bodies of the Special Ops squad.  Only one man, Capt. Ryan (Liam Cunningham), from the squad is alive, but just barely with his guts protruding from his stomach.  The moon is full and the hunt is on as the soldiers find themselves being hunted by a group of unknown killers.  Their rescue chopper isn't scheduled to arrive until the next morning and dawn has never been longer away.  As the soldiers race from the creatures hunting them, they are saved by a female zoologist named Megan (Emma Cleasby) who has been studying the creatures that are hunting them.  It turns out the fierce creatures are lycanthropes or werewolves.  Megan tells the soldiers that she has been studying the creatures for years, but it is obvious that she is hiding something.  Later we learn that she and Capt. Ryan have met before, but the full secret isn't revealed until much later.  So, the group of eight drive to the only shelter in the area, a quaint two-story farm house at the end of the lane and set up to defend themselves against the onslaught that is to come.  Werewolves are smart creatures, though, and as much as we come to care for the soldiers as the tagline says, ""Six soldiers.  Full moon.  No chance.""Out of all the different monster movies around, I have been fascinated by werewolf movies more than any other.  From the classic original WOLFMAN starring Lon Chaney to TEEN WOLF with Michael J. Fox, werewolves have held an appeal for me that no other monster movies have.  There have been a lot of variations on the genre, but often werewolf movies simply rehash the same stories over and over only using different names and locations.  DOG SOLDIERS doesn't do that.  It acknowledges the classic werewolf films of the past, but attempts to add something new to the genre.It helps a lot that Neil Marshall decided not to use digital effects and stick to old fashioned make-up and costuming.  Of course, we don't see the creatures until almost halfway through the picture.  However, once we do they look more realistic than something computer generated.  Sure, they look a bit cheesy, but they also look better than most other werewolves I've seen.  Instead of ape-like costumes, we get giant two-legged creatures that have facial features actually resembling wolves.DOG SOLDIERS is labeled as a horror movie because it involves werewolves, but the film really isn't a werewolf movie at all.  Instead, the film is an army buddy picture (dog soldiers is another name for grunts, after all).  The film revolves not around the werewolves, but the soldiers that they hunt.  The relationship between the members of the group is explored in depth and considering that we are only glimpsing two nights in their lives, it is an impressive bit of storytelling.  I was actually hoping I would never get to see the werewolves because I wanted to spend more time with just the soldiers.The other thing I liked about DOG SOLDIERS is the numerous pop culture references and homages scattered throughout the movie.  For instance, Sgt. Harry G. Wells is named after the famous sci-fi and fantasy author H.G. Wells while another soldier in the group is named Bruce Campbell after the actor who plays Ash in the EVIL DEAD movies.  These various references might seem unnecessary, but they illustrate that the Neil Marshall is an educated filmmaker well-versed in the genre.In my opinion, DOG SOLDIERS is the best werewolf movie made since the original WOLFMAN.  It isn't as violent and gory as many pictures in the horror genre, but it does have a great plot and is full of endearing characters.  Recommended for people who like werewolf movies, horror fans, and people who have seen THE DESCENT but who don't know who Neil Marshall is.",5,"""I came here to be at one with nature, well I got what I wanted.

Neither one has any extras beyond trailers--which is a pity because the previous version had the following:Special FeaturesDirector, Cast and Crew CommentaryProducer's CommentaryDeleted scenes""Making of"" Dog SoldiersGag ReelB Roll footageStoryboardsPhoto GalleryTheatrical trailersThe new DVD looks quite good but the film always has looked a little rough. The new high def transfer tends to show the limitations of the digital video the film was shot on.The Blu-ray looks quite good but it isn't a huge step up from the DVD so if you already have this, you may want to think about buying something else on Blu-ray. Although the transfer here is better than the previous release you sacrifice all the special features.Neil Marshall's ""Dog Soldiers"" takes a standard situation and turns it inside out. Six soldiers commanded by Sgt. Harry Wells (Sean Pertwee ""Event Horizon"")go out into the Scottish wilderness on an exercise. They arrive to discover a single survivor from a special ops team (Liam Cunnigham)who has had his forces deceimated. ""There was supposed to be only one!"" is all he will say initially. Cooper (Kevin McKidd ""Rome"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"")must lead his group when Wells is injured. They must run for their lives and find some place they can hole up.It turns out that the soldiers are being hunted by a pack of werewolves.A clever, intense thriller ""Dog Soldiers"" makes references to classic films such as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Evil Dead"" and other horror films. It's well made and intense with great performances from a largely unknown (to America) cast. I saw part of this on Sci-Fi but didn't know what it was called or what it was about. Luckily I rediscovered it on DVD and caught it the second time around from beginning to end.Marshall's second feature length film ""The Descent"" has appeared and will be compared no doubt to this fine first full length effort. Both films are terrific in their own way and quite different. Look carefully in one scene and you'll be able to see the tennis shoes of the werewolf as he goes out the window. Despite a low budget for the creatures the film works quite well although the first suspense filled half where we don't see the werewolves is stronger than the second half.The (earlier) DVD has both full screen and widescreen editions of the movie (at least the first release). It also has the international and domestic trailers as well as producer's commentary tracks and a featurette on the production of the film. It's a nice package for a great little film that fell beneath the radar. Like ""28 Days"" this is a great horror film that plays with the conventions of the genre.The new DVD (and Blu-ray)has NO special features and while it was prepared from a better looking high def master (and it does look better),it isn't a HUGE difference.

Take yourself generous cupfulls of ""Deliverance"", ""An American Werewolf In London"", ""The Evil Dead"", ""Predator""(as someone here has perceptively noted earlier), and ""Alien/Aliens"": mix all these ingredients together in a big cast iron cauldron under a full, round Scottish moon...and, well, hell, throw in some good Scottish haggis for good measure, let simmer, and...voila!...you've got this great rip-snorter (pardon the pun, couldn't let it pass) of a Spec-Ops Meet the Monsters flick.And that's just what it is. Squad of British soldiers are on maneuvers in the backlands of Scotland...doing an exercise with a Special Air Services (SAS) Commando unit. Problem is, the SAS unit gets wiped out by...something...and then that ""something"" starts tracking down the regular army group. They take refuge in an out-of-the-way farmhouse and soon discover they are under attack by werewolves. Even worse, the house they are holding up in is the werewolves HOME and the family wants BACK IN (and likely some raw soldier stew to boot). Its a fight to the finish between the soldiers and the lycanthropes.An SAS officer of the cold-blooded, semi-villainous type turns up as a plot device to explain what all is going on there to the besieged troopies, but he's not much help. He's already been bitten and ""turning"", so counting on him is a waste of time. And in this household even the family dog (or is he a weredog?) has an bad attitude.Wants to eat some of the entrails of one of his houseguests while the guest still has a use for them. BAD dog!!So a long night ensues and attrition takes its toll. And things don't look good for the army boys because you can't really trust seeming allies not to ""Turn"" on you...so to speak.Bummer.Okay, you say, its a werewolf movie.Why is it so good?It just is.

I'm just telling you, this is a darn good horror flick with really good writing, acting, photography, dialog,pacing, and make-up effects.

719711,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00006L91H,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[2, 2]","Action and gunplay combined with Blood and Gore have always held a soft place in my heart. Movies such as John Carpenter's ""Vampires"" and Robert Rodriguez's ""From Dusk till Dawn"" are among my favorites. Not to mention the comic book film ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"" that incorporates vampire horror with fantasy-action. Director Neil Marshall (the same guy who gave us The Descent) made box-office success in England with his action-horror hybrid ""DOG SOLDIERS"" (2001), and became a sleeper hit here in the U.S. and acquired a cult following. I am not sure just why it took me this long to review this film, but hey, I can make amends right now.In the Scottish wilderness, a British military unit led by Sgt. Wells (Sean Pertwee) has been dispatched to undergo a training exercise. They find themselves in the camp of a special forces camp that had been attacked with only one survivor; a lone man with his chest slashed named Capt. Ryan (Liam Cunningham) who had some bad blood with Private Cooper (Joe McKidd). The team evacuates and they find that the attackers were actually a pack of Lycanthropes (werewolves). In disbelief, the team corsses paths with a local woman (Emma Cleasby) and together they find shelter in an isolated cottage in the woods. The team decides to take a stand against their furry adversaries and what ensues is an intense battle between the trained soldiers and the inhuman beasts bent on devouring them.Bullets and Training versus Fangs and Claws!The film's main premise is quite simple, and its simplicity is actually one of its greatest strength. The events of ""Dog Soldiers"" take place in a 24 hour period and director Marshall wastes no time with a very simple set-up and minor character development in its first 20 minutes, then the film goes into overdrive; it becomes a chase film that becomes an action-packed ""Guns and Gore"" extravaganza that is guaranteed to provide a thrilling experience. The film is quite insane and at the same time has a brilliance around its proceedings. Part of its charm would have to come from its ""quippy"" one-liners and clever dialogue dipped in sharp-tongued execution. ""Dog Soldiers"" have plenty of memorable phrases dispersed throughout mostly coming from Sgt. Wells who calls his exposed innards ""sausages"" and Copper's clever cracks meant to give the team high spirits.Blood and Gore is omnipresent in the film's proceedings, Marshall gives very graphic details as our werewolves maim, devour our heroes' body parts. There are beheadings, claw slashes, and multiple disembodied limbs that will give horror lovers reason to praise this film. Now, the film isn't simply a gore show, it also succeeds in generating a feeling of claustrophobia. Being stuck in a cottage is no picnic especially when you have a pack of hungry werewolves bent on devouring you. But instead of relying on dialogue, the script relies on action-packed sequences to deliver intense thrills. The gunplay is nicely shot as our protagonists display both fear and the courage to survive--stay alive until dawn. The film's adrenaline-pumping soundtrack also adds to the experience and manages to project attitude and the present emotion. Marshall is also to be praised that he avoided the use of CGI and instead opted to use animatronic puppets and men in werewolf suits that further enhances the film's gritty feel.The direction is also to be commended that instead of focusing on a single hero, it focuses on the entire group. Each military man had their own chance to shine in the spotlight most notably the soldier who uses his boxing skills to fend off a Lycan, he uses everything he could find and the sequence is both amusing and quite intense. Character development will be found in the characters' actions, attitude and mannerisms. The script also has its share of surprises as to the reasons why the soldiers are actually in this area and as to the main antagonist.There have been quite a lot of werewolf films that can stand out and ""DOG SOLDIERS"" is one of them. The film while simple in plot was not pretentious, and avoids the usual perfunctory elements of a werewolf film such as a tortured soul and guilt brought on from their lust for blood. Now it does avoid these routine elements but it does fall for the routine elements of an action film; explosions, routine sacrifice and textbook manipulations that points a finger at a government. Regardless, the film is a refreshing experience. There have been many attempts to make an action-horror ""hybrid"" and ""Dog Soldiers"" have done enough to get noticed. ""Guns, Blood and Gore"" is a legitimate horror genre now and this film had something to do with that.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4 Stars]",4,"A Great Action-Horror ""Hybrid""!

719712,A2YS8G30VYUN6C,B00006L91H,"W. Russell ""warussl""","[2, 2]","What do you get when you cross Night of the Living Dead with An American Werewolf in London and add a little Predator for good measure?  The answer is Dog Soldiers, a sleeper horror movie about a platoon of English soldiers who encounter a pack of werewolves while on a training mission in a remote area of Scotland.  The platoon is attacked and chased to a farmhouse where they hold up while the lycanthropes stalk the outer perimeter.  The parallels with NOTLD are easy to draw as the werewolves attack the house and thwart the soldier's escape attempts.  There are actually numerous references to various horror movies through out the film.  When the werewolves reveal themselves, they are quite menacing and ""believable"".  The movie is not over the top gory, though there are scenes of splattering blood and brief glimpses of mangled men.  Couple that with strong language and it definitely deserves its R rating.  The acting is good and is coupled with smart dialog.  In short, the Amazon.com editorial review describing Dog Soldiers as a ""lean, efficient horror flick"" is right on target.  The DVD transfer is crisp and clean.  The disc comes with both standard and widescreen versions of the film.  Howling wolves and passing bullets are crystal clear in the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  Extras on the disc are limited to a trailer and a brief ""making of"" feature.
