My only complaint is that a part of the movie was changed slightly.. The part where Patty and Donna are making the bed and Sister Sledge is playing in the background. That part of the movie was slightly edited and the song was changed. But, other than that the movie seems okay. It's not a big deal.. I was just surprised they changed part of the movie being it has never been on dvd until now. I had this on dvd+r recorded off Liftime and before that on vhs years ago..

A complex and often dangerous investigation suggested a horrifying scenario: was the seemingly bland David Brown really a stone-cold killer -- who convinced his own daughter to prove her love by killing for him? A man who turned young women into his own personal slaves, who collected nearly $1 million in insurance money, and married his dead wife's teenage sister, David Brown was a sociopath who would stop at nothing...a deadly charmer who almost got away with everything.This is a Bizarre story and unbelievably a True one.
