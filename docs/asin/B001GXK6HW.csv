1198804,A1E3T0C3ZDLPSJ,B001GXK6HW,"K. Reddick ""MadysiinJournals Log""","[8, 9]","I enjoyed this movie because it really tells a story about how easily it is for a woman to get herself involved with men who really have no real purpose in their lives and mean them no good ..AT ALL!! The film could have been shot a little better but the point throughout it tells a great story. It spreads out a lot of pain and very questionable actions on the part of a couple who has lost their way in their marriage and how without compromise, there is nothing else except hopelessness between the two of them. The fight between them is all mental and serves absolutely no purpose to either one of them in the end. In this movie you do not have to search for any answers on your own because the film makers tell it all loud and clear. Very entertaining and your mouth will be wide open on some parts throughout it.",4,Real movie theme here...,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,818,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'really', 'story', 'how', 'easily', 'woman', 'get', 'involved', 'men', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'real', 'purpose', 'lives', 'mean', 'good', '..AT', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'little', 'better', 'point', 'great', 'story', 'out', 'lot', 'pain', 'very', 'questionable', 'actions', 'part', 'couple', 'who', 'lost', 'way', 'marriage', 'how', 'compromise', 'nothing', 'else', 'hopelessness', 'two', 'fight', 'mental', 'absolutely', 'purpose', 'one', 'end', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'search', 'answers', 'own', 'film', 'makers', 'tell', 'loud', 'clear', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'mouth', 'will', 'be', 'wide', 'open', 'parts']",Thug Love

Of course going into it, you have to know that it's going to be bad. It looks like it was made in someone's basement, and no one really cared too much about the quality of the filmmaking and the acting is somewhat atrocious. That said, it was actually a fun viewing, because I was laughing at it the whole time. I was confused and interested at the same time, I simply could not look away. And for that, Thug Love is the mini-masterpiece that it deserves to be. Title rightfully given.",4,Thug Love.
