The movie really does not wait to get into the story line as they both first meet when Cruise keeps bumping into her at the airport. She is not allowed on the plane at first because they said it was full and before Tom went on the plane he said everything happens for a reason. She is eventually allowed on the plane and when she gets on she discovers that it is basically empty and you can tell something is up. When she goes to the bathroom there is a great fight scene on the plane. She comes out and sees everyone is dead and the plane ends up crashing. Not to give to much away but she was drugged when Cruise gave her a drink and she woke up the next day remembering what happened because it was on the news. The movie from then on has a lot of basically nonstop action because the government is after Cruise for this battery that he has held for a long time. They don't trust him but they end up trusting a leader for the government which could play out interesting in the end. Not to give away to much of the movie but this a is a movie with a lot of action, some comedy and it plays into a little bit of Romance. I would have to give this a 4/5 stars for the DVD and a strong recommendation to at least rent or buy this DVD to watch.",4,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz make the perfect couple for a great action, comedy and romantic movie.",1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1451,"['know', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'criticized', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'said', 'done', 'movies', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'co', 'lead', 'role', 'movie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'story', 'line', 'first', 'meet', 'when', 'Cruise', 'bumping', 'airport', 'not', 'allowed', 'plane', 'first', 'said', 'was', 'full', 'Tom', 'went', 'plane', 'said', 'everything', 'happens', 'reason', 'eventually', 'allowed', 'plane', 'when', 'basically', 'empty', 'can', 'tell', 'something', 'up', 'When', 'bathroom', 'great', 'fight', 'scene', 'plane', 'out', 'sees', 'everyone', 'dead', 'plane', 'up', 'crashing', 'Not', 'give', 'much', 'away', 'was', 'drugged', 'when', 'Cruise', 'gave', 'drink', 'woke', 'up', 'next', 'day', 'remembering', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'news', 'movie', 'then', 'lot', 'basically', 'nonstop', 'action', 'government', 'Cruise', 'battery', 'held', 'long', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'trust', 'end', 'up', 'trusting', 'leader', 'government', 'could', 'play', 'out', 'interesting', 'end', 'Not', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'movie', 'movie', 'lot', 'action', 'comedy', 'little', 'bit', 'Romance', 'would', 'have', 'give', '4/5', 'stars', 'DVD', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'least', 'rent', 'buy', 'DVD', 'watch']",N/A

I enjoyed it for what it was, and thought it was quite entertaining and amusing, but far from the intelligence that some of Cruise's older movies held (Minority Report, Mission Impossible).

In fact, I was disappointed, since I had come to expect something a bit more political and intriguing.

I think the reason for this is the fact that everything `right' about this movie is VERY right.  Tom Cruise may be one of the most obnoxious celebrities around, but he's a fun actor and he works that suspicious charm all over this film.  I am smitten with Cameron Diaz (who I feel is highly underrated as on of her generations greatest working actresses) and she is all sorts of charismatically alluring in this film.  The action sequences are non-stop and totally engrossing and the basic plot (a predictable twist off the expected espionage thriller) is interesting enough to hold it's own in the film.  The supporting cast is a whose-who of respectable faces doing underwhelming things (Sarsgaard is demoted to predictably sleazy, Viola Davis is stuck in `Law and Order' mode and Paul Dano is laughably out of his element) yet they are forgiven thanks to the quick-fire pace of the film itself.  It's like a `Bourne' films without the intelligence, but when all is said and done it's richly entertaining.

Complaints about the filming, dings against Tom Cruse. But the movie itself is funny and a refreshing change of pace. The plot isn't really important here. Basically we are introduced to a pretty normal lady June Havens. Though she is great she doesn't have much of a life. On a trip from Wichita KS (where she is to get parts for her car business) she meets Roy Miller. And here is where the fun begins. Roy is the typical ""secret"" agent type... but funny and ridiculous. Roy kills all the baddies on the plane including the pilots and lands it too. Of course June gets involved in some plot to get some battery from a genus type.  But the move does not take itself too seriously. Both Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were funny and endearing in this movie. Roy may be a super agent type but he makes mistakes too and doesn't always know what he is doing. He is hysterical constantly complimenting June like ""good job there opening the door"" as if he is Tony Robbins. June too isn't one of those, oh, I am secretly am as good as a secret agent but she starts getting the hang of things and is a worthy partner for Roy. Action scenes were interesting and funny.

They really mesh well on screen together.  What I didn't like about the film is that some parts of some scenes must have been edited out.  Sometimes it is really confusing to watch because it is like doing a double take...you say to yourself &#34;what just happened there&#34;  probably 5 more minutes of dialog and scenes would have made it better.  Also, there is a scene where it is night and CD is following TC .  Then she goes with some agents and it is daytime.  They say &#34;she's been gone 8 minutes&#34; then it returns back to night time.

You just have to know what you're watching before you go in.It is OVER THE TOP, and I hate OVER THE TOP in most movies. I hated the assassins trying to kill Six Echo and Two Delta in the movie THE ISLAND, flying a helicopter and trying to shoot two unarmed and clueless social retards as they climb behind a hotel sign, or the F-18 scene in Die Hard 4 that destroyed an overpass in order to shoot a semi-truck, and failed only to have John McClain crouching on the wing as it circled as if he were Spiderman, or the entire ridiculous foolishness that was the movie 2012 with crevace jumping winnebagos and planes flying beneath subway cars and limos that maneuver like indy cars.KNIGHT AND DAY, has its own ridiculous moments, but in the grand scheme of things, the whole thing is over the top. That is who Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is. He's an enigma. He's James Bond meets Inspector Gadget meets Derek Flint meets Jackie Chan.The movie is a comedy and part of the comedy is the insanity that is Roy Miller's life. The changes in the story are creative and the twists are done with tact and creativity and impressive writing. KNIGHT AND DAY is one of the funnests most worthwhile times watching a movie I've had in years. It is always interesting. As crazy as it was to watch Roy Miller (Cruise) riding on the windshield of a dodging and racing through traffic, while being fired at car, all the while having a calm and collected conversation with a screaming panicing June Havens (Cameron Diaz), it was all workable in a movie that was OVER THE TOP in its entirety.The makers of KNIGHT AND DAY didn't try to pass off OVER THE TOP action scenes in order to please the OVER THE TOP loving crowd, the whole movie is OVER THE TOP and it makes KNIGHT and DAY a rare exception in my OVER THE TOP hating vendetta.It's fun.

KNIGHT AND DAY is a romance/action/comedy movie starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, in which the chemistry between the stars is about a 3, and too much of the action is unbelievable and uninvolving.Diaz plays June Havens, who cutely meets Cruise's CIA assassin, Roy Miller, at the Wichita airport as she's heading to Boston for a wedding.  But Cruise is really a secret agent, and when they find themselves on a nearly empty airliner together (the crew is there to kill Cruise), he takes them all out while June is in the bathroom.  Then he has to land the jetliner in a cornfield.Thus begins the globe-trotting contrivances of Patrick O'Neill's sub-Bondian screenplay that finds our hero and tag-along heroine zooming from Boston to Brooklyn to a tropical island to the Alps to the running of the bulls in Spain with bad guys in persistent pursuit.  One of the gags of the movie is that Cruise drugs Diaz before moving to a new location, so she's always waking up confused and angry in a strange place.The pursuers, including Cruise's CIA rival (Pater Sarsgaard), their mutual boss (Viola Davis), and an evil Spanish arms dealer (Jordi Molla), are after the Zephyr, a preposterous MacGuffin that is supposed to be a source of endless clean energy... or something.  Paul Dano, playing the Zephyr's inventor, becomes Cruise and Diaz's nerdy sidekick for awhile and brings a glimmer of life to the film.James Mangold (WALK THE LINE, COP LAND, 3:10 TO YUMA) was probably not the ideal choice of a director to infuse this shopworn material with verve and panache.  He sparks little electricity between his two stars, and his CG-heavy action sequences are phony and dull.  Trying to update the style of movie Alfred Hitchcock excelled at requires the master's ability to emotionally engage the audience in the characters' situation.  Not all of Hitchcock's movies completely succeeded, but in the ones of this genre that did (NORTH BY NORTHWEST, TO CATCH A THIEF), you cared about the people even when some of the filmmaking seams might be obviously showing.KNIGHT AND DAY is also a clear illustration of the continuing downward spiral of the ""star system"" in Hollywood.  Once counted on to ""open"" movies - bring in boffo returns on opening weekends - Tom Cruise's feet of box office clay have become more and more apparent as one movie after another has financially disappointed.  But he's just one example of the many formerly reliable movie stars audiences have stopped turning out to see just because their names are above the title.  Hopefully, the Hollywood powers that be are realizing that, with the myriad choices available, audiences won't necessarily fall for a piece of dull, tired filmmaking like KNIGHT AND DAY.",2,Tired and dull,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,2790,"['Not', 'terrible', 'Not', 'very', 'good', 'Just', 'kind', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'KNIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY', 'romance/action/comedy', 'movie', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'chemistry', 'stars', '3', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'unbelievable', 'uninvolving.Diaz', 'plays', 'June', 'Havens', 'who', 'cutely', 'Cruise', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'Roy', 'Miller', 'Wichita', 'airport', 'heading', 'Boston', 'wedding', 'Cruise', 'really', 'secret', 'agent', 'when', 'find', 'nearly', 'empty', 'airliner', 'together', 'crew', 'there', 'kill', 'Cruise', 'out', 'June', 'bathroom', 'Then', 'land', 'jetliner', 'cornfield.Thus', 'globe-trotting', 'contrivances', 'Patrick', ""O'Neill"", 'sub-Bondian', 'screenplay', 'hero', 'tag-along', 'heroine', 'zooming', 'Boston', 'Brooklyn', 'tropical', 'island', 'Alps', 'running', 'bulls', 'Spain', 'bad', 'guys', 'persistent', 'pursuit', 'One', 'gags', 'movie', 'Cruise', 'drugs', 'Diaz', 'moving', 'new', 'location', 'always', 'waking', 'up', 'confused', 'angry', 'strange', 'place.The', 'pursuers', 'including', 'Cruise', 'CIA', 'rival', 'Pater', 'Sarsgaard', 'mutual', 'boss', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'evil', 'Spanish', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Jordi', 'Molla', 'are', 'Zephyr', 'preposterous', 'MacGuffin', 'supposed', 'be', 'source', 'endless', 'clean', 'energy', 'something', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'playing', 'Zephyr', 'inventor', 'Cruise', 'Diaz', 'nerdy', 'sidekick', 'awhile', 'glimmer', 'life', 'film.James', 'Mangold', 'WALK', 'THE', 'LINE', 'COP', 'LAND', '3:10', 'TO', 'YUMA', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'ideal', 'choice', 'director', 'infuse', 'shopworn', 'material', 'verve', 'panache', 'little', 'electricity', 'two', 'stars', 'CG-heavy', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'phony', 'dull', 'Trying', 'update', 'style', 'movie', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'excelled', 'master', 'ability', 'emotionally', 'engage', 'audience', 'characters', 'situation', 'Not', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'completely', 'succeeded', 'ones', 'genre', 'did', 'NORTH', 'BY', 'NORTHWEST', 'TO', 'CATCH', 'A', 'THIEF', 'cared', 'people', 'even', 'when', 'filmmaking', 'seams', 'might', 'be', 'obviously', 'showing.KNIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY', 'also', 'clear', 'illustration', 'continuing', 'downward', 'spiral', 'star', 'system', 'Hollywood', 'Once', 'counted', 'open', 'movies', 'bring', 'boffo', 'returns', 'opening', 'weekends', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'feet', 'box', 'office', 'clay', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'one', 'movie', 'financially', 'disappointed', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'many', 'formerly', 'reliable', 'movie', 'stars', 'audiences', 'have', 'stopped', 'turning', 'out', 'see', 'just', 'names', 'are', 'title', 'Hopefully', 'Hollywood', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'realizing', 'myriad', 'choices', 'available', 'audiences', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'fall', 'piece', 'dull', 'tired', 'filmmaking', 'KNIGHT', 'AND', 'DAY']",N/A

This movie fell flat because I felt the extensive advertising for this movie (trailers/previews, TV commercials) had already shown me all the interesting parts (I didn't seek them out).  The feeling that I had already seen the core of all the significant action pieces ""a hundred times"" drained all the possibility for excitement out of them. Even the seven-month gap between the marketing campaign and my seeing the movie didn't seem to help. The cumulative effect was I was really struck by the feeling of having already seen (most of) the movie. Whereas some movies have only a few good scenes and use them relentlessly in their promos, this movie had many good scenes but didn't seem to hold much back from the promos. Aside: For comparison,Salt, which was released a month later, managed to effectively promote itself without this problem (Salt was reportedly originally intended to be a Tom Cruise vehicle).The cinematography was also strange--it often had a very shallow depth of field (think near-sightedness: foreground in sharp focus, background fuzzy) and actors that were _noticeably_ more brightly lit than the scene. In some scenes, the foreground (typically Cruise and Diaz) was so unnaturally ""popped"" forward that it was jarring for me. My initial reaction was that this was some artifact of reducing a 3-D movie to 2-D, but IMDB's spec says that this was not a 3-D movie.  These problems with the cinematography _inescapably_ signaled that they were working on a set (blue screen) which took me out of the moment.If it weren't for these two aspects, it probably would have been a strong 4-star movie.The Cameron Diaz role seemed like it was written so that it could be played by most female stars. Diaz is predominantly a RomCom actress and she doesn't project the athleticism and intensity/grit that facilitates taking action sequences up a level, but the script and stunts weren't customized for her strengths and limitations.  Rather than her sharing in the comedic elements in the stunts, they were Cruise's province (and he pulls them off nicely).Note: Because the motorcycle chase is so heavily featured in the promos, including the cover art for this DVD, I was expecting far far more than was here.

About all that can be said about them is that they served as suitable foils for The Star. On the other hand, I was a little surprised that Cruise managed the light touch as well as he did. It seems to me that he has not previously done the Doug Fairbanks, Senior and Junior, Cary Grant, gay, daring do. He handled it pretty well, not up there with the Masters, but more than adequate for the demands of this movie. The female lead, Diaz, serves mostly as a foil for Cruise, although this being a 21st Century film, she was given her segment in which to shine.The plot was not only forgettable once the film was over, it barely existed while the film was unwinding (to use  an old pre-digital adage). I know a number of people were paid what, to me, is megabucks, to put something down on  paper to give the actors words to say and things to do; however, the instructions to them might as well have been, don't worry about it, just listen to the Director while he makes it up. The result was mostly incomprehensible and incoherent. Never mind, you will never miss it.My advice: if you are in the mood for light and airy, sometimes humorous, well staged fight and other action scenes, this is a good one. It also fits the occasions when you really don't want to try to make sense of what is going on, just want to watch lots of 'let's pretend' stuff.This fits the bill.

1306277,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B002ZG9864,dv_forever,"[7, 14]","I was sober when I saw this train wreck of a film so perhaps I'd have something better to say about it if there was some substance or other running through my bloodstream. Let me say first off that I'm not one of those malicious Tom Cruise haters. I have enjoyed many of his films even if I think his acting abilities are limited. He often times picks very good directors to work with and then brings his star power to their projects. Kubrick, Spielberg and P.T. Anderson are just a few of the names that quickly spring to mind.Regardless, whatever Cruise and Diaz were thinking when they read this screenplay, the finished product doesn't work. It constantly undermines it's own momentum at every turn with another absurd plot twist any viewer could see from a mile away. The script is rotten, the direction by James Mangold is poor and the grinning face of Cruise in this summer action vehicle grows more tiresome every minute. Cameron Diaz is not as annoying but pretty close, playing the ditzy blonde only half convincingly. Perhaps she's more convincing in real life?While watching this atrocious movie I was reminded more than a little bit of ""True Lies"" since the plot revolves around a regular gal getting involved with a world class spy who can kill anyone and get out of any tricky situation. Well, the James Cameron directed True Lies is a true showcase of how to do a big-budget summer action comedy right. It's an audience pleaser in the highest degree even if the film is breezy and superficial. Cruise and everyone involved in ""Knight and Day"" clearly wanted to have fun in this same breezy, carefree manner and maybe they did but the audience does not share their enthusiasm. I was restless throughout the whole film, hoping that soon enough the movie would get interesting but it rarely did. The people I was with were bored out of their minds as well. Looking around the audience I sensed an unease, as if the people knew they were watching a big budget turkey of a movie. Many audience members were constantly getting up and going to the bathroom and this was in a barely filled movie theater no less. It was all just too whimsical, fantastical and really smacked of half-baked schtick.Another horrible feature of the movie was the C.G.I. I have seen plenty of terrible computer generated imagery in recent summer blockbusters but Knight and Day has to be one of the worst. The highway chase scene with the flying, tumbling cars defied all laws of physics and looked completely absurd, trivial in fact. There was no weight to the action scenes at all. Compare this silly scene with the harrowing bridge chase in True Lies when two Harrier jets use missiles to take out multiple terrorist targets and then Arnold Schwarzenegger hanging off the side of a helicopter rescues his wife played by Jamie Lee Curtis out of a moving on-fire limousine before it flies off a collapsed bridge. Now that's big-budget summer popcorn fun! Knight and Day has terrible action scenes and can't even compensate for that with chemistry from Cruise and Diaz. It just all seems too preposterous. If you're going to make a semi-surrealistic action flick like this, then go all the way and stop trying to ground it in some of kind of reality.There were a few good points I wanted to mention. One was the cool way the director edited the sequence when Cruise drugs Diaz, escapes from his captors and escorts her half way around the world. The sequence is all filmed from her subjective, semi-conscious point of view. A nice part in a bad movie. But when the roles are reversed and Diaz rescues Cruise later on, the same subjective viewpoint from Cruise seems stale and tired. The location shooting is also very fine as the characters globe trot everywhere from Salzburg, Austria to Spain and unspecified islands. Ultimately all the scene changes wear you out and you grow bored. Like I said before, if you're under the influence of some substance and it's got you all giggly, perhaps you'll enjoy yourself with this movie, otherwise you have been warned. It's one of the worst films either actor has participated in and easily at the bottom of the barrel for director James Mangold's career.",2,Basically a catastrophe unless you're under the influence...,1278633600,"07 9, 2010",2010,4185,"['was', 'sober', 'when', 'saw', 'train', 'wreck', 'film', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'have', 'something', 'better', 'say', 'was', 'substance', 'other', 'running', 'bloodstream', 'Let', 'say', 'first', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'malicious', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'haters', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'films', 'even', 'think', 'acting', 'abilities', 'are', 'limited', 'often', 'picks', 'very', 'good', 'directors', 'work', 'then', 'star', 'power', 'projects', 'Kubrick', 'Spielberg', 'P.T', 'Anderson', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'names', 'quickly', 'spring', 'mind.Regardless', 'Cruise', 'Diaz', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'read', 'screenplay', 'finished', 'product', ""n't"", 'work', 'constantly', 'own', 'momentum', 'turn', 'absurd', 'plot', 'twist', 'viewer', 'could', 'see', 'mile', 'away', 'script', 'rotten', 'direction', 'James', 'Mangold', 'poor', 'grinning', 'face', 'Cruise', 'summer', 'action', 'vehicle', 'more', 'tiresome', 'minute', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'not', 'annoying', 'pretty', 'close', 'playing', 'ditzy', 'only', 'half', 'convincingly', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'convincing', 'real', 'life', 'watching', 'atrocious', 'movie', 'was', 'reminded', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'True', 'Lies', 'plot', 'regular', 'gal', 'getting', 'involved', 'world', 'class', 'spy', 'who', 'can', 'kill', 'anyone', 'get', 'tricky', 'situation', 'Well', 'James', 'Cameron', 'directed', 'True', 'Lies', 'true', 'showcase', 'how', 'do', 'big-budget', 'summer', 'action', 'comedy', 'right', 'audience', 'pleaser', 'highest', 'degree', 'even', 'film', 'breezy', 'superficial', 'Cruise', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Knight', 'Day', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'have', 'fun', 'same', 'breezy', 'carefree', 'manner', 'maybe', 'did', 'audience', 'not', 'share', 'enthusiasm', 'was', 'restless', 'whole', 'film', 'hoping', 'soon', 'enough', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'interesting', 'rarely', 'did', 'people', 'was', 'were', 'bored', 'minds', 'as', 'well', 'Looking', 'audience', 'sensed', 'unease', 'people', 'knew', 'were', 'watching', 'big', 'budget', 'turkey', 'movie', 'Many', 'audience', 'members', 'were', 'constantly', 'getting', 'up', 'going', 'bathroom', 'was', 'barely', 'filled', 'movie', 'theater', 'less', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'whimsical', 'fantastical', 'really', 'smacked', 'half-baked', 'schtick.Another', 'horrible', 'feature', 'movie', 'was', 'C.G.I', 'have', 'seen', 'plenty', 'terrible', 'computer', 'generated', 'imagery', 'recent', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'Knight', 'Day', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'highway', 'chase', 'scene', 'flying', 'tumbling', 'cars', 'defied', 'laws', 'physics', 'looked', 'completely', 'absurd', 'trivial', 'fact', 'was', 'weight', 'action', 'scenes', 'Compare', 'silly', 'scene', 'harrowing', 'bridge', 'chase', 'True', 'Lies', 'when', 'two', 'Harrier', 'jets', 'use', 'missiles', 'take', 'out', 'multiple', 'terrorist', 'targets', 'then', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'hanging', 'off', 'side', 'helicopter', 'wife', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'moving', 'on-fire', 'limousine', 'collapsed', 'bridge', 'Now', 'big-budget', 'summer', 'fun', 'Knight', 'Day', 'terrible', 'action', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'compensate', 'chemistry', 'Cruise', 'Diaz', 'just', 'too', 'preposterous', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'semi-surrealistic', 'action', 'flick', 'then', 'go', 'way', 'stop', 'trying', 'ground', 'kind', 'reality.There', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'wanted', 'mention', 'One', 'was', 'cool', 'way', 'director', 'edited', 'sequence', 'when', 'Cruise', 'drugs', 'Diaz', 'captors', 'half', 'way', 'world', 'sequence', 'filmed', 'subjective', 'semi-conscious', 'point', 'view', 'nice', 'part', 'bad', 'movie', 'when', 'roles', 'are', 'reversed', 'Diaz', 'rescues', 'Cruise', 'later', 'same', 'subjective', 'viewpoint', 'Cruise', 'stale', 'tired', 'location', 'shooting', 'also', 'very', 'fine', 'characters', 'globe', 'trot', 'everywhere', 'Salzburg', 'Austria', 'Spain', 'unspecified', 'islands', 'Ultimately', 'scene', 'changes', 'wear', 'grow', 'bored', 'said', ""'re"", 'influence', 'substance', 'got', 'giggly', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'actor', 'participated', 'easily', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'director', 'James', 'Mangold', 'career']",N/A

It starts off with June Havens (Cameron Diaz), an average young lady about to make a local flight. After bumping into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) at the terminal, and then meeting on the flight, they start up a little chat. She goes to the bathroom to freshen up...and then its like whoa! A massive fight scene starts up on the plane, the pilots get involve and get killed as well. However, by the time June comes out of the restroom, all seems quiet again and Roy has drinks waiting. She seems a bit curious as to what is going on, especially when Roy says that he has to land the plane and all the dead bodies start to roll out of their seats.Victim by Convenience:June's life then it turned completely upside-down, as all of a sudden she is caught up in the world of espionage and secret agents. She tries to get out of it, but Roy always seems to catch up with her. She is moved from location to location across Europe, as she begins to learn what is at the heart of the matter, which is a very special battery.High Mix of Action and Comedy:This is a highly intense action film, and the body count rises by the minute, but because of the 'shock treatment' that June is subjected to, it can seem to be funny at points. There is a lot of stunt work in this film with includes: Car chases (inclusive of car jumping, as made popular in the matrix reloaded), motorcycle stunt work and gun & knife fights. For the climax, you are taken to Spain, where even about a dozen bulls get into the action (you really need to see what happens here).Conclusion:This is a very entertaining film, maybe not Oscar material, but very high on the action level.

1306305,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZG9864,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","An amicable Roy Miller warns a guy: ""For your own safety, stay in the booth."" Hindsight dictates that all those who got in Roy Miller's way should've just stayed in their booths. A sexy Cameron Diaz and a slightly creepy Tom Cruise make KNIGHT AND DAY a grand, over-the-top spy adventure, and I sure liked it a hell of a lot better than its close cousin KILLERS. Even at the age of 72, Tom Cruise can still kick it as a master secret agent. And, going by this DVD's Behind-the-Scenes featurette, Cruise did most of his own stunts. And if you factor in all the unbelievable things that his character gets up to in the film, that is an impressive reveal.The story initially throws out just enough ambiguity concerning Cruise's character that you're not sure whether this guy's to be trusted or what. Roy Miller, cloaked in mystery, first latches onto June Havens (Diaz) in an airport, and there's a spark. June is flying out to her sister's wedding. She restores automobiles, which makes her infinitely sexy. We don't know why Roy is flying. We do know the flight ends in body bags and a plane crash, preceded by a pretty damn nifty fight sequence in the plane. On a side note, if it's bugging anyone, that bit of tango music used to score the fight is Gotan Project's awesome ""Santa Maria (Del Buen Ayre)."" I love that tune, but it's getting so that everyone and his blue-haired granny is putting this song in their movie.June survives the plane crash. Can she survive Roy Miller, who seems bent on shadowing her everywhere she went? Government agents show up to inform her that Roy a week ago was the most trusted covert agent in the Agency, that is, until Roy's full blown break with reality. Except that Roy, earlier on, had warned June that men would be coming to say exactly this kind of stuff. So who's lying? Who's paranoid? Who's unstable? Can a romance blossom when colored by deception and incoming hails of gunfire? Waves of assassins come out of the woodwork, and they're also targeting June. You'd think this would add to Roy Miller's credibility.A movie like this requires a McGuffin to send its characters frantically dashing around the globe, and so we learn of the Zephyr, which is this inexhaustible battery prototype that could theoretically power a city in perpetuity. Everyone wants this device. Roy Miller, delusional or not, gone rogue or not, possesses this device. What are Roy's intentions regarding the Zephyr? We're in the dark for some time.Roy Miller is so impressive as a secret agent that he attains an aura of near comic book invincibility. There's never one moment in which you get the sense that Roy's bit off more than he can chew. KNIGHT AND DAY isn't meant to be gritty nor is it grounded in reality. It's straight-up summer popcorn, and I had a lot of fun watching it. Cruise and Diaz are great together, Cameron Diaz as sweet as ever. But it's Cruise's slightly off-hinged performance that kept me engaged. Fast-paced. Quirkily romantic. Cloak & daggery. Big, explosive stunts. Big special effects. Exotic locations. You can tell where the money went. This movie isn't touchy-feely or socially relevant. It won't challenge your brain. But it achieves what it sets out to do, which is to entertain. The two leads are pros at being appealing. There are sequences in which your jaw may even drop. I think you'll chuckle in spots. I'm still smiling at Cruise's frenzied ""Life expectancy... with me... without me..."" speech. And I did say this was better than KILLERS. The difference between the two is like... KNIGHT AND DAY.The DVD's bonus material: ""Wilder Knights and Crazier Days"" is the behind-the-scenes featurette focusing on the crazy stunt work done by Cruise and Diaz (00:12:30 minutes); ""Knight & 'Someday'"" is a segment chronicling Tom Cruise's visit with the Black Eyed Peas in London during their 2010 world tour as the Peas debut ""Someday,"" the song the Peas composed for the end credits of KNIGHT AND DAY; it's a cool song, too (00:09:09); two viral videos promoting the movie: ""Soccer"" (Tom and Cameron spectacularly kicking around a soccer ball; 00:01:08) and ""Kick"" (Cameron rehearsing a kick on Tom;

Thankfully, the 'star power' of Cruise and Diaz, now pushing the end of their prime and peak, keep it interesting enough.June is a ditzy blonde (a dangerous new role for Diaz!) who meets Ryan (why does Tom cruise?) at the airport.

Overall, I thought it was a well-crafted, entertaining action flick--if a bit over the top (then again, ""over the top"" has become the norm in action films these days).I would have posted the review with three stars but we gave it an upgrade thanks to our Amazon VOD experience.  This was our first time to watch an HD video via Amazon On Demand. Gotta say that we were very satisfied, having recently purchased the Roku XD/S Player. We did so, specifically because it offered Amazon VOD, as well as Netflix. Value-wise, it's hard to beat Netflix streaming but at this point, their HD streaming suffers when compared to Amazon's HD video.

His personality says he isn't, but his actions say otherwise.  All in all, through all the guessing and wondering what was truly going on, there was a bit of well-placed humor and an exceptional chemistry between Cameron and Tom.  They were having a ton of fun in the making of this movie, and it showed.

1306342,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B002ZG9864,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[6, 9]","I am reading the reviews of this movie wondering if I saw the same film.  Granted, it is pretty funny.  At times I am not sure it was intending to be funny, which doesn't necessarily bode well for the film, but it was humorous none the less.  As an omen, when I walked into the theater to see this film, five minutes before the start time, there was not a single person sitting in the seats.  Nobody.  That doesn't necessarily bode well for the film either.  Can we say strike two?  I did like the direction the movie was attempting to go though.  Veering away from the Mission Impossible genre just enough while still including enough action sequences to remind us that it was a Tom Cruise film.I think at times the movie struggled with an identity.  I am not sure the writers/directors had made their decision on what kind of experience to portray, and that left me feeling like it was lacking direction.  I will say that Cameron Diaz and even in a couple of sequences, Tom Cruise, had me rolling on the floor laughing.  The broken drugged dream sequences were pretty imaginative as well, although the ending seemed a little farfetched.  I guess that goes hand in hand with the motorcycle scenes which are now becoming a signature of the spy series.  They are just flat out ridiculously laughable.Anyway, Tom Cruise is our every day spy, who yet again is battling the bad guys.  This time it appears that the bad guys are really the good guys and somebody in our government is trying to betray our local hero.  He manages to bump into Cameron Diaz on a plane ride home and her life never does get back to reality.  I have heard people compare this to ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith which I think is pretty farfetched.  Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in no way can compare to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt on any level at this point in their careers.  I did say at this point in their careers people.So Tom has a really juicy battery, and the guy that invented it, and he is trying to protect both from pretty much everyone on the planet.  I wish I could say there was more to the plot, but that is really about it.  The rest of the movie jumps from one location to the next with Tom and Cameron fighting and killing a whole lot of people.  I am sure I will get roasted for this review, but when Tom Cruise stops mid scene, during the heat of a gun battle to give Cameron a loving kiss hello, mostly to shut her up mind you, he somehow manages to avoid a few hundred bullets without even trying.  That really sums up the entire movie.So if you are interested in a mindless movie that absolutely will make you laugh and some impossible to believe farfetched action sequences, then this is your movie.  I would highly suggest having a six pack of beers before flipping on the go switch though.  Everything looks a little better with a six pack and that might be just what this movie needs.  I wonder if theaters will at some point in time start passing out tequila shots with the 3D glasses.  Just think how much money they could save.  People would be seeing all kinds of affects, and the cost of the films would be drastically reduced.Average film, but not a complete waste of time if you have already seen most of the other movies playing.Go ahead, I can take it.

Story is Roy Miller is a spy on the run & he's following this Woman named June around June Havens around on the flight to Boston June is in the bathroom this flight is almost empty Miller is attcked by these ""passengers"" & the piolets when June comes back Miller calmly informs June ehat he had to kill everybody she thinks it's funny until he goes to the cockpit & lands the plane. Miller gives her some kind of drink that puts her out she wakes up the next morning so then while she's trying on a dress for her sisters wedding these men who say they are working for the FBI & lure her to there vehicle they assure her that she'll be safe then we get a well done action scene on the freeway it was well shot after that she finds her boyfriend Rodney & he takes her out for pie while there chating Roy shows up takes June he tells Rodney to stay in the booth. Well he goes outside & gets shot in the leg later on it shows Rodney on the TV acting like a hero it was pretty funny. Basically he tells June that what's going on he has to protect this guy named Simon who created a perpetueal energy battery when they go to the safe house there immediatly attacked they are captuered they escape he takes her to a island off the grid but are tracked down when June ansrews Roy's cellphone they escape while being attacked by a remote drone. June is knocked out again & she awakes on a train she's talking to a guy who she thinks is Simon but he's really a German Assassin then we get a entertaining fight on the train. Miller puts June & Simon in a hotel in Salzburg he goes to meet this woman June is picked up by the CIA & the Director Of Counter Inntel tells June that she belives that Roy Miller is a rouge agent. Later on The CIA is chasing Miller & he fakes his death of course. Simon is kidnapped & then the movie really slows down here the stuff with Cameron Diaz on her own investigating I couuld've done without. June calls out on her voice mail she'll sail the Zephyr. She's captured by of course Miller shows up & we get a fun finish to the movie. I know my explainaton of the plot was bad. Tom Cruise needs to do more roles where he plays himself.

It's one of those movies that one enjoys over and over again. Why? Here's my list of reasons why:1. The actors Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Both are immensely likeable whether or not you approve of their lives outside the movie house. However, I surmise, right or wrong, that they did not particularly like each other as themselves. If I'm right, that means their acting is quite convincing because they do have chemistry in this film.2. The plot is absolutely ludicrous, but that is part of the charm of the movie. It is violent but not violent. So many bullets fly around Tom's character, yet he is not hit until the end (not giving anything away).3. The title is a play on words. The knight hides the battery (see the movie to understand the inference). The day that may or may not come.4. Very few curse words fly; in fact, each time I hear one I am reminded of how few there are.5. The comedy is delightful. I love every line each character has. My favorites: &#34;With me. Without me.&#34; &#34;Someday means never. It never comes.&#34; &#34;This is Someday, Roy.&#34; Oh, yes, the words about undressing her. Ha ha. The best humor comes with the turn-about is fair play thing.6. Good guys win. I mean REALLY win, as in double winning with the special ending.7.

Truthfully, he seems to have done some real damage to his image, what between jumping on Oprah''s couch and then saying silly  things to Matt Lauer about depression.  Somewhere within all that, Tom crossed over to being 'that weirdo scientologist' and he's been turned into little more than a punchline.  Most of his movies have suffered ever since, including this one.  Knight and Day is an excellent movie in my opinion -- it's fun, irreverent, action packed, and best of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Tom plays an agent on the run, and when he bumps into Cameron Diaz, she unwittingly gets swooped up into his world and ends up being forced into being on the run with him.  I can't stress enough how FUN and FUNNY this film is.  It really is a good one and deserves to be seen. I've certainly seen worse movies that have done better critically and financially.  Knight and Day takes you on a global adventure to exotic locales and has fun taking you on the ride.  This is better than Mission Impossible, because it's just plain ol' good fun, is easy to follow and is very well acted.  Tom and Cameron have real chemistry.

But some of my favorite flicks are his, including Risky Business, The Last Samurai, and Minority Report. I can now add KNIGHT AND DAY to that list.KNIGHT AND DAY is pure fun. It is an action comedy that doesn't try too hard, has a lot of intimate moments at offbeat times, and is completely endearing from start to finish. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz click with lots of action, witty dialog, and great chemistry. Think of it as a much better take on the Scarecrow and Mrs. King. Cruise is a secret agent that seems to have lost a marble or two. Diaz is just a normal girl who rebuilds old muscle cars. And while it's easy to think of the movie as a parody or a sendup of all spy movies or even just Cruise's own Mission Impossible series, it isn't. It's not a farce or a spoof. It's just a tight, kooky, engaging flick that stands on its own. And KNIGHT AND DAY is rated PG-13 which makes it great to watch with the entire family.  We watched this with 3 generations (from 5 to 75), and everyone enjoyed themselves.The Blu-Ray version of KNIGHT AND DAY is especially nice, with fantastic DTS sound and amazing color and clarity. Honestly, I've seen it twice and could watch it a few more times. The last movie I felt that way about was the 2009 Star Trek movie. For a light, cozy, entertaining evening at home, KNIGHT AND DAY is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

They never got good grades without cheating, grew pot in their bedroom, and were always the one with the fake ID. You knew your parents didn't approve of them and yet, spending time with them was without a question some of the best times you had as a kid.It seems that Tom Cruise has become the film industry's version of the wild child. After leaping over Oprah's sofa a few years back he transformed from the most bankable star in Hollywood to the fodder of Late Night talk show hosts. He has been characterized as unstable and maybe even a little delusional.It was only a matter of time before a film would take advantage of Tom's new persona and cast him in a film that pokes fun at such an individual. Tom stars with Cameron Diaz in ""Knight and Day,"" opening today in theaters across America. Tom plays a spy, with much of the characteristics he has personally been accused of possessing. His by chance encounter with Cameron Diaz sets them off on an adventure around the world. Diaz' character June, becomes an unwilling participant in a game of espionage as she and Roy (Tom Cruise) fight to remain alive through a maze of unpredictable plot twists.The film is packed with a plethora of action sequences with plenty of funny gags added to the mix. Some of the special effects are weak, but as long as the characters keep moving and entertain us, who cares? This is not a film that will win awards or even be number one at the box office this week. Plain and simple, this is a fun film with a few minutes out of our busy lives to relive the thrills of being reckless and impulsive. So leave you worries about the bills at home, go to theater and order the large popcorn this time.

It just isn't very good. It's a movie meant to be relegated to the purgatory reserved for 2.5 star celluloid. If they still had double features, this would be the lead-in film despite the supposed drawing power of Cruise, considered an A+ Lister and Diaz, an A- Lister.After watching KNIGHT AND DAY I got curious about the film---either a good sign or a very bad sign---and discovered that it was a piece of intended summer fluff that got stuck in Development Hell for a good long time, with a surprising number of changes of cast, script, scriptwriters, directors, producers, and title (alternate titles included ""Wichita"" and ""Trouble Man""). Somebody owed somebody a favor on this one; otherwise, it would still be locked in the ""script ideas"" file.The tormented history of KNIGHT AND DAY is subtly reflected in the film which has some serious discontinuities of tone and pace and plot, leading to storyline chaos, and a fallback on multiple-use contrivances. There's just far too much use of knock-out drops, for one thing. For another thing, the ""romance"" in this ""romantic comedy"" is strictly pro forma. Cruise and Diaz have little chemistry between them and they never really click.KNIGHT AND DAY bombed at the box office. It's very similar toKillers, another action-adventure-romantic comedy released a few months earlier in 2010 starring the lovely Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher (the very poor man's Tom Cruise), which also tanked.Cruise plays Roy Miller, nee Matthew Knight, a deep-cover CIA agent who specializes in wet work. He's the ""Knight"" of the title. Miller's either the agent who hasn't been turned, or, he's crazy. We can't tell.Diaz plays June Havens, a woman trying to make it home for her sister's wedding day (the ""Day"" of the title---I think---it's never clear). She becomes Miller's at-first unwilling and bewildered companion, who, as the film progresses, spontaneously develops a natural ability with automatic weapons (just like Heigl in KILLERS).Cruise mails in his performance, falling back on hisMission: Impossiblemuscle memory to play the unstoppable Roy Miller. His trademark boyish charm, which served him so well inRisky BusinessandTop Gunhas, over the years, sadly become a Botox-paralyzed leer, which makes him look like a serial killer on the prowl.As for Diaz, she's cute rather than sexy onscreen, though there are moments where the camera tells us she's aging, and even a shot or two where she looks downright haggard. Cameron wasn't sleeping well on location. She does turn in a far better performance than Cruise, though, having sincere fun with the role of June, the proverbial babe-lost-in-the-woods-turned-supercompetent-accomplice.KNIGHT AND DAY's saving grace is its action sequences, which are well done, essentially continuous (they make up 6/8ths of the film) including a gunfire-punctuated car chase in the midst of the San Fermin Running of the Bulls in Seville, Spain (and no, the Running of the Bulls is NOT limited to Pamplona).If you missed your morning coffee and need a high-octane dose of action, KNIGHT AND DAY is worth a viewing.

1306379,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B002ZG9864,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 4]","When we first saw the trailer for ""Knight & Day"" in a theatre many moons ago we decide this was a movie we wanted to see the first day when it came out.  It had been a long time since a trailer got us this excited, probably since ""Titanic,"" where we wanted to know how Kate Winslet survived given she was on the bow of the great ship as it sank beneath the waves (this being a separate issue from ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Dark Knight,"" where we do not need to see no stinkin' trailer to be convinced to go see the movie).  But having been burned time and time again by great trailers for lousy movies, we were worried that we had already seen all of the best laughs for this summer of 2010 film.  Happily, that is most decidedly not the case.  Therefore, let the news be spread, that ""Knight and Day"" is a film that is at least as good as the trailer, and I would argue even better.June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is running through an airport to make a connection to get back home to Boston for her sister's wedding, when she bumps not once, but twice, into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise).  The next thing she knows they are two of the handful of people on a flight that is supposedly totally booked.  June likes the way the conversation is going and retires to the restroom to decide how far she wants things to go.  By the time she comes out, June and Roy are the only two people left alive on the plane.  Who is Roy and why are people trying to kill him?  Oh, that would be telling and the whole point of the hook is to get you into the theatre.  If I were to describe ""Knight & Day"" in terms of movie algebra I would say it is ""True Lies"" crossed with ""Bringing Up Baby,"" because this is as much a screwball comedy as it is a spy on the run movie.  The title is really just a cute variation on a natural opposition, and you will be most of the way through the film before it halfway makes sense, but it never makes complete sense, so do not get hung up on it.Cruise spends a lot of time wearing sunglasses and working them hard, so he has the whole ""Risky Business"" vibe going in this one, but this is also the funniest he has ever been in a film and he does it with nary a smirk.  As for Diaz, this is far and away the best work she has done in a comedy, especially when she is doing more than supplying just the voice.  I even think she does a better job here than she did in ""Being John Malkovich,"" which is usually the film people point to when they want to cite Diaz's best work (as Roy says in the film, the lady has ""skills"").  Both stars get equal credit for keeping their characters anchored despite the over the top elements of the film, and that goes a long way towards make their on-screen chemistry work so well.  More importantly, we are talking about personal chemistry rather than sexual chemistry, because they convince us there is a real connection between two people who appear to be as opposite as, well, night and day.  Of course, that is not totally the case, another reason for the chemistry.Peter Sarsgaardis the good guy chasing Roy and Jordi Moll&agrave; the head bad guy doing the same.Viola Davisis the no nonsense boss andPaul Danothe reason why Roy and June are in all the trouble.  For that matter, nobody else in the film engages in chewing scenery either, which works out nicely because there are plenty of bullets and flying cars to take care of ripping the scenery to shreads.The screenplay is by Patrick O'Neill, who apparently started out in Hollywood as a bit actor in films like ""Say Anything"" and ""Grosse Point Blanke,"" and then wrote and produced the short lived 2001 television series ""Dead Last.""  Given that resume, I am curious as to how much of what we see on screen is O'Neill's creation and how much is due to the actors and director James Mangold (""3:10 to Yuma"").  But we will have to wait for O'Neill's next screenplay to get a better idea of what he contributes.  It has been a long time since we laughed out loud this much (and this loud) at a movie, and there is just a lot of fun and a sense of joy permeating this film.  I especially liked the escape where June comes in and out of consciousness and we get fleeting glimpses of the insanity Roy is up to.  I know that a lot of the action sequences are done with special effects these days, but even with that consideration I liked how a lot of the ""stunts"" were grounded in such old school classics as the car chase and the gunfight.  I hope that one of my favorite bits, which consists of simply creating a traffic jam by doing a quick circle, was done by an actual stunt driver and not on computers, because that would make it even more impressive.But this film boils down to Cruise and Diaz, and they are well worth the price of admission.  This is not mere hyperbole on my part, because we went to see this movie at night, something we rarely, rarely do, and on top of that we ordered tickets on line to make sure we got in, which was an additional expense.  So I think we ended up paying more to see ""Knight and Day"" than any other movie we have ever seen in a theatre (No, we have not seen a 3-D movie, an IMAX movie, or an IMAX 3-D movie, and paying to see a live HDTV broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera does not count as a movie).  I am not sure if this is a great movie, because I have to see it again to render a verdict on how well it holds up the second time through.  But to have such high expectations met and exceeded like this certainly justifies rounding up.",5,"Finally, a movie that not only lives up to but exceeds its great trailer",1277337600,"06 24,

1306397,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG9864,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I'll admit up front that when I first put this movie in I was expecting another movie where Cameron Diaz played a ditzy, hopeless klutz who giggled non-stop and ended up with the good guy by film's end. I was only partly right and thankfully the good part. KNIGHT AND DAY worth watching.Diaz stars as June Havens, a young woman on her way home after picking up some car parts she was after to restore a GTO. At the airport, she is accidentally bumped into by a stranger we later find is named Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) not once but twice. As we all know from the way he behaves (and from seeing the film's trailer umpteen times), Roy is a spy on a mission. When June is bumped from her plane, Roy says that might be a good thing.But the group that is tracking down Roy decides otherwise and makes sure June gets on the plane, thinking perhaps there is a tie between the two. They converse a bit on the plane but when June decides to visit the powder room, the other passengers all attack Roy. It seems that all of them, including the pilot, are part of a group trying to take down Roy and retrieve something he has.When June returns she doesn't notice everyone else slumped in their seats, but Roy lets her know that they're all dead, including the pilot. Roy has also slipped something in her drink that makes her drowsy. Before she passes out, Roy tells her to remember to tell no one they met and that should anyone approach her and tell her they're taking her somewhere ""safe"" or ""secure"" it means she will most likely disappear off the face of the earth. And then he lands the plane safely, thought somewhat mangled, in a corn field.When June wakes the next day, she's home in her bed with notes from Roy reminding her to say she knows nothing. Will she do what he says? Of course not, this is a movie! Rather than keep quiet, she calls old flame Rodney and they meet to discuss what happened at a nearby diner. While eating who should show up but Roy who then whisks June away as a hostage, wounding Rodney in the process and rescuing her from would be captors.The movie pretty much continues this way with Roy coming to June's rescue each time she disregards what he tells her. Eventually the two pair up and work together even though June has no training at all in the world of espionage. Roy comes around and lets her know that he was assigned to protect a young genius named Simon (Paul Dano) who may have found the perfect fuel cell, as big as a battery and as powerful as the sun. The problems began when his partner Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) turned traitor and framed Roy as one. Now he's doing his best to protect Simon, catch the bad guys who want the battery and rescue June all at the same time while he tries to clear his name.The chemistry between Diaz and Cruise is there but not played upon near as much as the explosions and gunplay seen throughout the film. But even those scenes are cut short at times when June is rendered unconscious time and time again. Perhaps not enough to make it a downfall of the film, but it can be annoying at times. It always seems to be used when they make a change of locale going from the U.S. to the Alps and on to Spain.Action fans will have plenty to walk away happy with here as both leads do a number of their own stunts adding a touch of reality to the mix. Car chases, gun battles, hand to hand combat and more are all on display most of the time here, mixed in with a small touch of comedy. As I said at the start, I was worried there'd be more than enough of this but they actually keep it to a minimum. Rather than play off of Diaz' normal ditzy girl they instead provide Cruise with most of the humor as he deftly snaps one liners left and right in the middle of the action scenes.When released, the film didn't do the phenomenal business expected with the two stars and that's sad because it truly does offer a good time. It won't become a cure for illness, it won't solve the world's major problems in 109 minutes, but it will put a smile on your face as the action never stops and the romance blooms during the most dangerous of situations.Cruise and Diaz turn in fine performances making it all seem so easy.

It didn't remind me of recent romantic adventures like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" or ""Killers"" so much as it did a romantic version of ""The In-Laws,"" with Cruise as Peter Falk and Diaz as an infinitely more curvaceous Alan Arkin. The first half of ""Knight and Day"" is as funny and thrilling as anyone could wish; unfortunately, both the plot momentum and the storytelling logic start breaking down slightly more than halfway through, about the time Cruise and Diaz get to Salzburg (gorgeously photographed by Phedon Papamichael). But Cruise and Diaz, both playing the distilled essences of their screen images, are devastatingly charismatic throughout, and the many action scenes are state-of-the-art, especially a multi-vehicle chase scene through the streets of Sevilla (actually Cadiz). Fine actors such as Peter Sarsgaard, Viola Davis and Paul Dano show up briefly to speak their stock lines and collect their paychecks.

1306412,A3UVGHUDOY77YR,B002ZG9864,MissPammy,"[0, 0]","Diaz and Cruise are a good combination, which must be why they've made several movies together.  It was a typical Cruise action film but with more humor mixed in.  I rented this movie a couple of times and ended up buying the DVD so I could watch it more times.  There is something about this movie that charms me.  Unlike most of Cruise's action films, it shows a tender side of the man.  The yearning his character expresses to do some of the things he has always wanted to do impressed me as being not too far off from Cruise's real desire--not that he needs any more excitement in his life, but that his life is mostly about work and not that much play or relationship.  Diaz's character is a perfect foil for Cruise's capable and in-control Roy Miller, because she goes into hysterics at the drop of a hat and responds on impulse most of the time rather than thinking things through.  There is an essential underlying sweetness to the movie despite all the action and shooting.  Diaz and Cruise do a great job of being funny together, and both give somewhat nuanced performances in this film.  Diaz goes from being winsome to being flirtatious, hysterical, jealous, fearful, and more.  Cruise's character is the super-controlled, extremely skilled agent who thinks five steps ahead and fearlessly puts himself in harm's way, but he is also gentle and caring at times and funny at others.  Although much of what he does is implausibly perfect, there are moments where he seems to let down his guard and show his softer side.  I think that is why I like him in this film so much.  After probably at least 6 views, I still like the movie and I know I will watch it again many more times.  Plus I absolutely adore the ""Someday"" number at the end by the Black-Eyed Peas.  I recommend this movie.  It's a fabulous action-packed romp if you like action films, and it's also a cute comedy at the same time.  The romance between Cruise's and Diaz's characters is infused with humor instead of heavy emotionality, so even guys should be okay with it.  I think Cruise's comedic abilities are often overlooked when they cast him in films, but he gets to exercise them a bit in this one, and it adds just that delicious touch of humor that makes his character likeable without descending into the ridiculous slapstick of action film spoofs.  I think most people will find it definitely worth at least one view, and it's now on my ""favorites"" shelf.",5,Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,2440,"['Diaz', 'Cruise', 'are', 'good', 'combination', 'must', 'be', 'why', ""'ve"", 'made', 'several', 'movies', 'together', 'was', 'typical', 'Cruise', 'action', 'film', 'more', 'humor', 'mixed', 'rented', 'movie', 'couple', 'times', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'DVD', 'could', 'watch', 'more', 'times', 'something', 'movie', 'most', 'Cruise', 'action', 'films', 'tender', 'side', 'man', 'yearning', 'character', 'expresses', 'do', 'things', 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'impressed', 'being', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'Cruise', 'real', 'desire', 'not', 'more', 'excitement', 'life', 'life', 'mostly', 'work', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'play', 'relationship', 'Diaz', 'character', 'perfect', 'foil', 'Cruise', 'capable', 'in-control', 'Roy', 'Miller', 'hysterics', 'drop', 'hat', 'responds', 'impulse', 'most', 'time', 'rather', 'thinking', 'things', 'essential', 'underlying', 'sweetness', 'movie', 'action', 'shooting', 'Diaz', 'Cruise', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'funny', 'together', 'give', 'somewhat', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'film', 'Diaz', 'being', 'winsome', 'being', 'flirtatious', 'hysterical', 'jealous', 'fearful', 'more', 'Cruise', 'character', 'super-controlled', 'extremely', 'skilled', 'agent', 'who', 'five', 'steps', 'ahead', 'fearlessly', 'harm', 'way', 'also', 'gentle', 'caring', 'times', 'funny', 'others', 'much', 'what', 'implausibly', 'perfect', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'let', 'down', 'guard', 'show', 'softer', 'side', 'think', 'why', 'like', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'probably', 'least', '6', 'views', 'still', 'movie', 'know', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'absolutely', 'adore', 'Someday', 'number', 'end', 'Black-Eyed', 'Peas', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'action-packed', 'romp', 'like', 'action', 'films', 'also', 'cute', 'comedy', 'same', 'time', 'romance', 'Cruise', 'Diaz', 'characters', 'infused', 'humor', 'instead', 'heavy', 'emotionality', 'so', 'even', 'guys', 'should', 'be', 'okay', 'think', 'Cruise', 'comedic', 'abilities', 'are', 'often', 'overlooked', 'when', 'cast', 'films', 'exercise', 'bit', 'one', 'just', 'delicious', 'touch', 'humor', 'character', 'likeable', 'descending', 'ridiculous', 'slapstick', 'action', 'film', 'spoofs', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'definitely', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'view', 'now', 'favorites', 'shelf']",N/A
1306413,A1AFXJ8U72MD6L,B002ZG9864,"MISTER SJEM ""sonofhotpie""","[0, 1]","The tale of a secret agent (Tom Cruise) who meets and falls in love and marries and his wife (Cameron Diaz) eventually finds out who he truly is but not before a lot of mayhem, action and romance.This movie went through a long development hell before being released. It didn't do too well in the North American box office but it did respectably to good overseas. The problem was that they sold it as a romantic action picture when it's really more of an off the top comedy with romance and action elements. People going in expecting a high octane powered action piece will surely be disappointed.In fact, it breaks a lot of the action rules common to the action genre, like people small talking in the middle of a gun fight and breaking action flow.

Harrison Ford needs that little scar to make that face truly unique.  And movies need their imperfections too.. it's the accidents that happen that create those perfect moments of cinema, the magical moments that you remember.  And yes, that is exactly what is missing here...  we have the perfect star pedigree of Cruise and Diaz, the exotic locations with perfect weather, the polished concept of a caper movie combining action and romance with comedy, the likes of which Cary Grant and Hitchcock excelled.  So what's the problem?  It's well enough executed, the action scenes are well choreographed and storyboarded... but it has no magical moments.  It's an airbrushed movie, with the car chases not quite getting the pulse racing, because as excellent as the cgi is, and as innovative as some of the ideas are, you never quite believe it when it's too polished.  As well rehearsed as the smiles and faces full of perfect teeth are, you never quite feel the chemistry is real, just well rehearsed.For the record, Diaz is an everyday woman not quite satisfied with her place in the world but not knowing anything more... until she meets Cruise apparently accidentally, who draws her into a world of espionage, plane crashes, shootouts, car chases and general melee, interspersed with toothy grins and cocktail making skills in exotic and romantic locations around the world.  Is he a rogue spy, is he using her, or is he a framed man, the only honest one she should really trust?That's the idea - recreate a caper movie, for a new generation, with a woman as the `everyman'.  The balance between humour and action never quite sticks though.. the tone never finds its way as the punch of action scenes is lost with the addition of hokey attempts at comedy and romance, and the romance lost due to.. well, just a lack of chemistry frankly.  If the film deserves credit, it's for the admirable use of some terrific and varied locations.In the end though, what is Cindy Crawford without her mole?  What do perfect features become without that imperfection to draw attention to the beauty?  What happens when the scars and blemishes, the wrinkles are magicked away..?  You're left with just a Barbie doll, a plastic version of the real thing... and what we have here is a Barbie doll of a movie, lacking character or moments to remember.  Polish has turned to airbrush, and while you might survive the movie without being too bored, it will fade from your memory faster than it took to watch it.Sorry, as pleasant as all the ingredients were, this just didn't work for me.

But at least I had been swindled as masterfully and outrageously as any of the many conspiracies in the movie. Before I realised what had happened, the thief had melted into the crowd. I can now barely remember the film. In fact, I'm not even entirely sure I went.For there are few good reasons to enjoy this film other than the sheer gall the producers have in serving up something so preposterous, incoherent and, at the end of the day, lazy. But I still can't deny: I laughed a lot. I walked out feeling like this would have been a tenner well spent. It seemed like a good deal at the time; a couple of days later, I feel like I've had my wallet lifted.Knight and Day belts along, and that's the key to its success: it never allows you to pause for a moment. Certainly, never long enough to gather your wits: it is a perpetual, preposterous, onslaught. Now, preposterous in this sort of film is okay; indeed, in the genre, mandatory; but there are limits, and with its unstoppable momentum Knight and Day barrels straight though them without a backward glance.The set pieces - there are dozens of them, laid end on end - each go over the top in a way that even the Bond franchise would baulk at. They are, of course, leavened by humour and visual gags which excuse the ultra-violence (on an Alpine train, a man with a kitchen knife protruding from his chest saves himself from falling out a train window (briefly) by grabbing a string of sausages. It's Austria!). But there are so many set pieces, with so many different actors involved, that the necessary confusion - again, de rigueur in a romantic farce - is lost totally in the maelstrom of unnecessary incoherence and narrative laziness. Cruise escapes on two or three occasions from seemingly impossible situations (in a cell, hanging upside down, in a straight-jacket, swinging to and fro like a pendulum) without any explanation at all. But, then again, there was no good explanation of how he got there in the first place: easy come, easy go, I suppose.None of the countless supporting characters has a hope of developing into anything more than a prop. Each, accordingly, fails to. The film gratuitously belts around the planet in search of exotic locales (I counted Boston, Kansas, Austria, Spain, the Azores and South America) and many of these seem to have been chosen purely to show off a CGI budget which, by its genre, the film really shouldn't need at all. There was no call for computerised charging bulls in Cadiz, cartwheeling motor-vehicles on divers freeways or buzzing space-aged jet-fighters in the Azores - but they threw them in anyway, perhaps in a magician's hopeful attempt to distract the viewer from the sleight of hand going on in front of his nose.Diaz is her usual winsome, dippy and pretty self, and repeatedly shows off her winning/cloying (depending on your view) grin. Amusingly enough, she suffers from the deliberate running joke of being repeatedly drugged at critical junctures (on one occasion, even being subjected to a Vulcan Nerve-Pinch), but her character's arc is less plausible even than Cruise's. I suppose we should be grateful she even has one.In fairness to Cruise and Diaz, they remain consummate professionals and make watchable something that could easily have been a train wreck.  They both nail every one of their one-liners. Could this film possibly have worked without such reliable A-listers at the helm? I doubt it.So why is this film called Knight and Day, then? There is half a reason, but it isn't a good one (Roy Miller's ""real"" name is Knight and (symbolically!) a plastic knight features as a MacGuffin of sorts) but there's no reason for the Day bit as far as I can detect. The producers tried and (rightly) rejected a couple of other names (the irrelevant ""Wichita"" and the lacklustre ""Trouble Man"": they didn't consider ""Miller's Crossing"" sadly), but the general issue with the name might point to the film's main problem: it's hard to name a film which has has almost no identity. Knight and Day is just kind of there - it coalesces, like a traffic jam at rush hour.It's different from a traffic jam in that, at least for the first hour, it's tremendously entertaining",3,Willing suspension of critical faculties,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,4563,"[""'ll"", 'freely', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'Knight', 'Day', 'master', 'criminal-cum-cop-cum-spy', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'intercontinental', 'gallivant', 'having', 'literally', 'stumbled', 'winsome', 'dippy', 'adorable', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'reflected', 'film', 'weekend', 'occurred', 'critically', 'speaking', ""'d"", 'had', 'pocket', 'picked', 'least', 'had', 'been', 'swindled', 'masterfully', 'outrageously', 'many', 'conspiracies', 'movie', 'realised', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'thief', 'had', 'melted', 'crowd', 'can', 'now', 'barely', 'remember', 'film', 'fact', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'entirely', 'sure', 'went.For', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'reasons', 'enjoy', 'film', 'other', 'sheer', 'gall', 'producers', 'have', 'serving', 'up', 'something', 'so', 'preposterous', 'incoherent', 'end', 'day', 'lazy', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'laughed', 'lot', 'walked', 'out', 'feeling', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'tenner', 'well', 'spent', 'seemed', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'had', 'wallet', 'lifted.Knight', 'Day', 'belts', 'along', 'key', 'success', 'never', 'pause', 'moment', 'Certainly', 'never', 'long', 'enough', 'gather', 'wits', 'perpetual', 'preposterous', 'onslaught', 'Now', 'preposterous', 'sort', 'film', 'okay', 'indeed', 'genre', 'mandatory', 'are', 'limits', 'unstoppable', 'momentum', 'Knight', 'Day', 'barrels', 'straight', 'backward', 'glance.The', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'dozens', 'laid', 'end', 'end', 'go', 'top', 'way', 'even', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'would', 'baulk', 'are', 'course', 'leavened', 'humour', 'visual', 'gags', 'excuse', 'ultra-violence', 'Alpine', 'train', 'man', 'kitchen', 'knife', 'protruding', 'chest', 'falling', 'out', 'train', 'window', 'briefly', 'grabbing', 'string', 'sausages', 'Austria', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'set', 'pieces', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'actors', 'involved', 'necessary', 'confusion', 'again', 'de', 'rigueur', 'romantic', 'farce', 'lost', 'totally', 'maelstrom', 'unnecessary', 'incoherence', 'narrative', 'laziness', 'Cruise', 'two', 'three', 'occasions', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'situations', 'cell', 'hanging', 'upside', 'down', 'straight-jacket', 'swinging', 'fro', 'pendulum', 'explanation', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'good', 'explanation', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'easy', 'come', 'easy', 'go', 'suppose.None', 'countless', 'supporting', 'characters', 'hope', 'developing', 'anything', 'more', 'prop', 'accordingly', 'film', 'gratuitously', 'planet', 'search', 'exotic', 'locales', 'counted', 'Boston', 'Kansas', 'Austria', 'Spain', 'Azores', 'South', 'America', 'many', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'purely', 'show', 'off', 'CGI', 'budget', 'genre', 'film', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'was', 'call', 'computerised', 'charging', 'bulls', 'Cadiz', 'cartwheeling', 'motor-vehicles', 'divers', 'freeways', 'buzzing', 'space-aged', 'jet-fighters', 'Azores', 'threw', 'anyway', 'perhaps', 'magician', 'hopeful', 'attempt', 'distract', 'viewer', 'sleight', 'hand', 'going', 'front', 'nose.Diaz', 'usual', 'winsome', 'dippy', 'pretty', 'self', 'repeatedly', 'winning/cloying', 'depending', 'view', 'grin', 'Amusingly', 'enough', 'deliberate', 'running', 'joke', 'being', 'repeatedly', 'drugged', 'critical', 'junctures', 'one', 'occasion', 'even', 'being', 'subjected', 'Vulcan', 'Nerve-Pinch', 'character', 'arc', 'less', 'plausible', 'even', 'Cruise', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'even', 'one.In', 'fairness', 'Cruise', 'Diaz', 'remain', 'consummate', 'professionals', 'make', 'watchable', 'something', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'train', 'wreck', 'nail', 'one', 'one-liners', 'Could', 'film', 'possibly', 'have', 'worked', 'such', 'reliable', 'A-listers', 'helm', 'doubt', 'it.So', 'why', 'film', 'called', 'Knight', 'Day', 'then', 'reason', ""n't"", 'good', 'one', 'Roy', 'Miller', 'real', 'name', 'Knight', 'symbolically', 'plastic', 'knight', 'features', 'MacGuffin', 'sorts', 'reason', 'Day', 'bit', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'detect', 'producers', 'tried', 'rightly', 'rejected', 'couple', 'other', 'names', 'irrelevant', 'Wichita', 'lacklustre', 'Trouble', 'Man', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Miller', 'Crossing', 'sadly', 'general', 'issue', 'name', 'might', 'point', 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'hard', 'name', 'film', 'almost', 'identity', 'Knight', 'Day', 'just', 'kind', 'traffic', 'jam', 'rush', 'hour.It', 'different', 'traffic', 'jam', 'least', 'first', 'hour', 'tremendously', 'entertaining']",N/A

I concede that the plot was Standard Hollywood and Tom Cruise's CIA agent outrageously hypercompetent in everything he does (but then so was the Bourne character), so don't expect subtlety or great filmmaking.  But it was a hoot to watch.See the other reviews for the basic plot.  I thought Cameron Diaz played her character pretty much on the money.  The poor woman has to figure out if Miller (Cruise's character) really is a murderous lunatic or someone being chased by a pack of truly bad men.  She does it humorously well, with Cruise coming up (and showing up) with comically inappropriate statements.  No chemistry between Diaz and Cruise?  I beg to differ.  There's a great scene with her riding on a motorcycle's bars facing backward and shooting around Cruise at the bad guys behind them.  Cruise compliments her skill at shooting, at which she positively glows at him.  It's almost sweet.The movie drags a little in the middle compared to the first part; it gets a little more serious for a while.  That sort of temporary lag is typical; only the Marx brothers could make a feature-length show that was equally funny from beginning to end.  But ""Knight and Day"" is an action movie as well as comedy, so it works out.Don't be too logical about this show.  Kick back and watch a couple of pros strut their stuff.

1306472,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B002ZG9864,S. Morales,"[1, 2]","Knight and Day, beyond its quirky and plot-wise completely meaningless title, is a by the numbers action comedy romp starring a pair of Hollywood A-listers who seem to have just been bored one Saturday afternoon, therefore decided to both go out and shoot a formulaic action flick. This feeling is exactly what carries on through Knight and Day, starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. The film has a plot we've seen countless times before on various 80s and 90's action movies: Rebel Protagonist has rare or valuable object, bad guys from all various areas are after said object, protagonist meets up with a pretty and clueless gal, protagonist protects pretty gal who is discovering more meaning along the way, clueless gal is seduced and charmed by protagonist therefore takes his side in the end, one predictable plot twist has one of the ""good guys"" turn out to be bad, the truth eventually reveals itself, predicted romance ensues by the end, the end.That being said, the movie is not all that bad. What makes this film work is the quirkiness of Cameron Diaz and charm of Tom Cruise. Now, while the chemistry between them is not very good, it's not bad either; they are handed a script which unfortunately simply contains basic comedic dialogue and work best with what they have. Any other on-screen duo and this would have failed miserably. Cruise and Diaz keep this at tolerable and never go into terrible. In the end though, neither character is ultimately very charming, and we end up disappointed that neither of them did more, or were written better, to at the very least enhance two characters working with an otherwise formulaic plot. I can't really even say there was any real potential or filmmaking ambition here. The plot itself is WAY TOO action/comedy textbook for this to have been anything further than 2 hours of mindless action starring two pretty people. That feeling you get when you watch the trailer, telling yourself, ""um, it looks ok, but not really dying to go see it, looks just kinda typical,"" is true. As this film is very typical. Like I said before, this really does feel like a quick paycheck for both actors, seemingly bored and in between filming better films.Plot and characters aside, technically speaking, the editing is not anyting new, the sound effects, special effects and stunts we have all seen too many times already. The film even lazily brings us to new scenarios at some points while Cameron Diaz is drugged and alseep in order to get us to the next point without having to actually SHOW us how the two protagonists get out of certain hairing situations. Tom Cruise's secret agent character is too perfect in getting them out of situations that would otherwise be near impossible for any human to escape, and this is done in order to tell the audience how ""good"" of a secret agent he is.

That has been written by just about everyone else on Amazon so I will focus solely upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.VIDEO...A rather low bit-rate spanning the mid teens to mid twenties that belies the actual quality of the video transfer which is really quite good.  Colors are true to life and naturally saturated.  Plenty of details to be seen in darker areas as well as skin lines, pores and various textures of objects, so you know that no one went too far with crushing the blacks. At no time did I see  artifacts of any kind.  With the extreme chase scenes in this comedy adventure the transfer could easily have been prone to motion blur and stair stepping but I saw none of that.  Grain, for the most part, is not seen at all.  I picked this film up as a lark, on impulse at an inexpensive price and I do not think it is a 'must have' movie.  However, I was surprised at just how clean the transfer really is.AUDIO....The lossless DTS MA 5.1 audio is the star of the movie on Blu Ray as the editors and producers clearly put some real effort into creating a realistic audio surround field.  Your left and right front and rears all get their due when their due is due.  (Had to try that line).  There is excellent panning across the front stage as well as between the front and rear sound stages.  Foley effects are often discreetly channeled to all 4 surrounds when appropriate and your LFE channel gets a bit of a workout on the bottom end of many gunshots, car crashes and explosions.  I did not expect the audio for this movie to be as good as it was.Extras include a few broken up 'Making of' documentaries, a Black Eyed Peas music video and BD Live which I have never, ever bothered or had interest in using.  Unfortunately, there were also the hated movie advertisements they call previews which just takes up space on the disc which then calls for more compression to the movie you have paid for.  The Blu Ray I purchased did not have a digital copy on disc but just a sticker to download one via Vudu.  Haven't done that yet.All in all, if this film is your cup of tea...half man, half chick flick and fun to watch, you could pick a worse film easily.

Cruz stepped out of his I'm the only irrisistable hero/hunk in the world type, and gives an exceptional performance.  He even steps up the humor in this film.  He laughs at himself, and you laugh right along with him.He's a flawed spy who slips up but rebounds nicely.  He actually plays down his character and gives a witty, charming, and capitivating performance.  He shares the screen with Cameron and doesn't over shadow her.The supporting characters are very believable, and these supporting actors give strong and extremely convincing performances.  You actually don't know whether to believe him or not.  It's a humorous take on a super spy flick that's simply a winner.I'm not a car chase fan, but I actually liked the car chase seens in this movie.  This is certainly not a T & A film.

I am a fan of Tom Cruise, I loved MI-3 despite the critic's bad reviews, and I was amused by his comedy in this movie.  I am not a huge Cameron Diaz fan, but thought she was a great complimentary character to Tom's lead.Roy Miller (Cruise) turns out to be this wonderful, sensitive, thoughtful man who is a special operations agent who is being set up by a fellow agent.  Miller uses June (Diaz) as a mule to get a much sought after battery through customs.  They are on a flight together, and while June is in the bathroom talking to herself about her attraction for Roy, Miller kills all the people on the plane and has to crash land it in a field.  He drugs June and leaves her at home, warning her to stay away from Federal Agents.  The rest of the movie is a struggle for June who is attracted to Miller, but not sure she can trust him and Miller's fellow agent trying to get the battery and the battery's inventor, Simon Fleck, away from Miller.The witty dialogue between the characters and Roy's ability to manipulate June's life so that she makes it to her sister's wedding is fun to watch.  The action is fantastic and the story line is engaging.  I love the part when June is given truth serum and she starts talking about Roy, angering the villain, Antonio.

Now on to my review.----------------------------------------***Brief Review***I know there are overall positive reviews for this movie.  This however is one of those times where I just don't see it.  (I can already feel a disturbance in the force, and the negative votes and comments coming).Why did I not like this film?  For one, it's a strait out comedy.  Tom Cruise is killing people, shoting guns, and driving cars incredibly fast, all the while cracking jokes to Cameron Diaz.  He's hanging upside down once, getting ready to get tortured and all the while he keeps smiling and saying ""Don't Worry June"" we're almost home free.  The next minute they are in a plane, the next minute bailing out of said plane, and finally on a remote tropical island.  Frankly I just found the whole experience quite unwatchable.Tom in this film is like every spy/action character he's ever played rolled into one, with a huge dash of bad comedy thrown in.  Diaz just screams the whole movie and is dragged from one place to the other by Cruise.What's the story/premise?  Your guess is as good as mine.  Something about a cold fusion battery or something... Who knows.Let me reiterate, this is my opinion of this film.  If you watched this and thought this was the best movie ever, that's your opinion.  I personally found it a chore to finish, and it took a while for me to finally to complete the whole thing.Also it rented TERRIBLE.  Nobody wanted to watch it, we had like 40 copies of this thing and they just sat on the shelf.  I had to lie and tell people that Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were naked in it for it to rent at all, nah I didn't really, but I probably should have.---In Conclusion---A solid pass in my humble opinion.  Nothing memorable at all.  Still interested?  All I can say then is it's probably in the bargin bin at Wal-Mart or FYE, check there and PLEASE don't pay more than 5 bucks for it.  Back when I was at the video store, we had to sell it for 2.99 and they still were hard to get rid of.Well, that's my opinion of this film.  If your a die hard Tom fan and I offended you, all I can say is ask youself WWTCD?

Plus he uses a toy knight to conceal an experimental battery that can power a whole city. I am sure there may be some other knight symbols, such as knight in shining armor etc., but the movie isn't designed to be that deep. Cruise bumps into Diaz (June) in an airport as they get on the same flight. After some innocent flirting Diaz goes into the airplane restroom and does some primping, trying to figure out how to hook up with Rob Miller (Cruise). While Diaz is looking in the mirror checking out her T&A;, Cruise is being attacked by everyone on the plane. Diaz comes out, has a drink with Cruise who explains that the pilots are dead.Later in the movie Diaz attempts to have a serious conversation with her former bf. As she explains about the airplane, he ignores her and tries to talk about ""the relationship."" The movie is filled with these numerous turn arounds, most of which come near the end. One chase scene reminded us of that ""Mission Impossible"" criticized impossible train explosion scene, as Cruise jumps to the wind shield of an automobile which Diaz is driving. Crusie jumps around building tops like The Phantom and at one point Diaz models a red bikini for us. Eventually Diaz gets into the whole spy thing and decides to take matters in her own hands.

This movie has a lot of Tom Cruise going for it.  I can't wait until he plays a super-spy with the nickname ""The Cruiser"".  Alas, not in this movie.This movie is a lite actioner with some lite humor that works.  Cameron Diaz (IMO) has seen better days; she's looking a little worn down here honestly (my wife even thought so) but she's still fun as the romantic interest and helpless lass.  With decent comedy chops of her own she actually gets to play it a little more straight than Cruise whose super-spy character is not just super-talented he's also super-caring with a twist of quirky and a dash of zany thrown in for good measure.  This movie never tries to be anything other than fun and it succeeds.  If you're looking for a ""Mission Impossible"" or ""Minority Report"" or ""Collateral"" type of intense Cruise look, well, at one of those I just mentioned because you won't find him here.  If you've seen a lot of action movies then you've seen these stunts before.  The movie isn't going to make you scratch your head and wonder what just happened.

Well, I did. But spy movies these days are so much more serious and brooding. Not that I have anything against Jason Bourne, the Craig-era Bond films, or anything Liam Neeson happens to star in, but it kinda' leaves you to wonder ""whatever happened to all the lighthearted stuff?"" Enter Knight and Day; a romantic comedy at the heart of an action/adventure/espionage flick that's not quite True Lies, but possess its own charm in the same vein. Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is running around with an important piece of technology when he drags in June Havens (Cameron Diaz) as an unsuspecting cohort. Comedy, drama, and romance ensue as the duo travel around the world to find the creator of this device and take him into protective custody while also trying to expose the real rogue agent within the ranks of the CIA. No, the story isn't as epic as Bourne or Bond, but I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed the film overall. A lot of it is due in large part to the actor chemistry, followed very closely by Cruise's natural comedic charisma, and even a little bit of Diaz's subtle beauty. To be honest, it's been ages since I've seen her in a movie (I think the last one was Gangs of New York), but I think she looks pretty good here. She doesn't appear to have a whole lot of makeup on, I like her hair, and she looks very fit in that bikini. And I personally have always liked Cruise as an actor despite is off-camera antics. I've always thought of him as being very meticulous in preparation, which really seems to reflect in his performances. But to me, Knight and Day is one of those films where you really have to let yourself be imaginative. It's the kind of movie that draws its entertainment from your own ability to say ""this is ridiculous and cool at the same time, I wish I could do it."" If I were to compare this to a more recent franchise, I'd say it's closer to the TV series Chuck, only reverse the male-female roles, take out the (obvious) character development, and remove all the geekdom/pop culture references.Video - 4.5The video transfer is excellent. Colors are especially vibrant through all the various shooting locales whether it be the lush greenery on Miller's hideaway island, the sunny baked oranges of Spain, or even the plain hometown humdrum of Boston. As a result of these changing color palettes skin tones range somewhere between normal and ""deceptively tanned."" It's no distraction by any means, though, thanks to the presence of a very fine layer of film grain, which is most noticeable in outdoor shots. Saturation also tends to be a little on the hot side (most notably when actors are directly exposed to sunlight), but I think it makes the settings feel more realistic. Black levels are deep and provide a good amount of shadow delineation between intricately-lined fabrics, stage props (particularly guns), and body shapes in the dark. Meanwhile, contrast provides just enough brightness to compliment everything else making for a very clear picture. Image detail is sharp and I'm pleased with how much depth there is (again with Diaz wearing that bikini). There's a bit of CG used during the more extreme action sequences (since you obviously can't pull off such over-the-top stunts without it) as well as some inherent noise in the darker shots, but neither of them are ever a big problem. Otherwise, things like Edge Enhancement, Digital Noise Reduction, compression artifacts, and debris are nowhere to be found. My favorite parts of the movie you could probably use as showcase material include the airplane fight at the beginning (good detail considering how closed and tight the space is), the Bull Run sequence at the end (for colors, saturation, and even more detail), the nighttime scene in Austria where June is following Roy (lots of of blacks and shadows, or maybe even the warehouse shootout), and, if you're up for it, the highway chase through Boston (this is where you'll see most of the CG, but it's a pretty cool looking scene anyway). Good job by director of photography Phedon Papamichael and the people at Fox for providing a real eye-pleaser.Audio - 4.5We start with the airplane scene where the LFEs make themselves apparent through the occasional bump of air turbulence. Dialogue is clear and discernible from the center channel as Roy and June make for an interesting exchange of chit-chat and stories. After she goes into the lavatory to freshen up we're introduced to a small and quick sampling of the actiony sound design. The score by John Powell (which is ironically reminiscent of his work in the Bourne films) plays and separates itself into the fronts and rears with a just a little bit of bass in the rhythm, while the fisticuffs and weapons give off all kinds of directionality. Martial arts counterattacks, the whiffing of clothes, and connection of hits provide a good, loud smack across from left to right, right to left and seat belts and grazing knives whiz and whip around with tense authority. There's a little bit of gunfire that's doused out by the muffling of suppressors, but they still provide some excellent bass thumps and ricochet from the sides to and around the rears. All of this, by the way, is on top of the fact that you can still hear the light whirring of the plane engines outside the cabin. The next big scene is the highway chase. Vehicle noise and engine revving offer some really good dynamics, at least until Roy shows up. When he does you get to hear lots of bullets going through windows, a few crashes, and even an exploding SUV. After that is a scene in which Roy and June are in a warehouse and they get ambushed by a bunch of guys with automatic weapons. It's actually a pretty short sequence, but provides a little bit more in terms of directionality as the bullets deflect everywhere. Then finally, is the last scene in Spain during the Bull Run. Again, it's a short scene, but it's the climax of the action and we really get hear a little of everything (bulls stampeding, bullets deflecting, cars crashing, a fast motorcycle, and uptempo music). If anything the only downside to this lossless track is the quietness during the non-action scenes, but that's more a result of the narrative, which would obviously be case since it's still a romantic comedy. It's not quite reference, but is still very serviceable.Extras - 2.0What a disappointing set of extras. As attention-detailed as director James Mangold is, we don't even get an audio commentary. Instead there's a 12-minute EPK (""Wilder Knights and Crazy Days"") that talks about the production of the movie itself, where we get bits and pieces of info from cast and crew about what they wanted to convey, how it all came about, and the filming process itself. It heavily emphasizes the fact that Cruise likes to do a lot of his own stunts (if not all of them), which is pretty cool in itself and a respectable characteristic to a fine actor. The rest of is basic pat-on-the-back fluff between the director, producers, actors, and your basic run of the mill coverage stuff. Next is another 8-minute feature (""Boston Days and Spanish Knights"") essentially discussing the filming. When a film crew travels around to exotic locations I tend to become very interested in how and where they shoot it. Unfortunately, this one is just as run of the mill, if not more, than the first. Third is a 9-minute feature (""Knight and 'Someday': Featuring the Black Eyed Peas and Tom Cruise"") where we get to see how the film's ending song came together. Here you basically see some behind-the-scenes footage of Cruise visiting BEP on tour in London, talk to will.i.am backstage, and then join them on stage as they debut the song. After that are two 1-minute ""Viral Videos"" of Cruise and Diaz goofing around; one with a CG soccer ball and another with Diaz kicking Cruise through a table. They're kinda' funny, but ultimately pointless. And finally are two truncated versions of the combined EPKs (""Knight and Day: Story"" and ""Knight and Day: Scope""), which just rehash the production and shooting. Overall this a very disappointing and underwhelming package of special features. But considering how poorly the film did in theaters, I'm sad, but not surprised. I think the movie is pretty good regardless of criticism and would've enjoyed at least an audio commentary or two (one with Mangold and the other with Cruise and Diaz). I mean, there aren't even deleted/alternate scenes. Talk about rushed production.Overall - 4.0I like this movie. It's not quite as over-the-top as Date Night, but Knight and Day is still fun and entertaining enough that it makes me wanna' daydream about being a spy again. James Mangold is a really good director from all his work I've seen thus far, and it's a shame this movie didn't fair well during its theatrical run. But thanks to the ever-present star power of Tom Cruise, the rejuvenating allure (for me anyway) of Cameron Diaz, and some great chemistry, the film makes for a pretty enjoyable action/adventure rom-com. With near perfect A/V quality, but a set of extras that's severely lacking, I would recommend Knight and Day, though for no more than $10 (unless they double-dip with the package of extras it deserves). If you're like me and still appreciate Cruise, definitely pick it up. Otherwise, you may want to give this a rent if ""campy"" isn't your cup of tea.",4,Knight and Day (Blu-ray),1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,9586,"['Movie', '4.0Remember', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'used',

She then bumps into Roy Miller, a handsome and mysterious guy played by Tom Cruise. In the next ten minutes June finds herself involved in an international conspiracy, fending off the chasers with guns. Roy says he is the only hope for her to survive, but can she really trust the man?""Knight and Day"" doesn't take itself seriously. It is also a story of romance and suspense. Always suave and smiling, Tom Cruise is like Cary Grant (of ""Charade"") with James Bond-like ability to combat, which often looks almost superhuman. Perhaps that is why I started to care less and less about the characters they play. The storyline gets more and more incredible, with contrived action / romance set-pieces.Clearly the leading stars are having fun, and though I am not particularly a fan of Cruise (or Diaz), their charms are undeniable. Still, even their star power cannot completely save the clich&eacute;d script that fails to provide the excitement or sense of adventure. Most supporting actors (including Peter Sarsgaard, Paul Dano, Viola Davies, Jordi Molla and Maggie Grace) are sadly wasted and their characters are nothing but ciphers.Aside from the ""star power,"" ""Knight and Day"" benefits from the impressive stunt work. Cars and motorbikes flip and fly through the air, and Cruise's hero misses his target, shooting guns and throwing punches, kicks and a knife, too.

After it was over, I promised myself that I would pay more attention to reviews; If I had I could have done something productive, like not watch this movie.This movie isn't terrible; it just doesn't bring anything to the table that justifies buying it over almost any other movie in the action genre. The story is vague, and unintersting. I still don't fully understand why June and Roy were together, or why the plane was necessary. The basic premise is Roy ( Tom Cruise ) is trying to stop a rogue agent, who has framed him as a rogue agent, from stealing a battery. I still don't know why June ( Cameron Diaz ) was involved in the story, but her character brings nothing to the already flimsy story.Half way through the film, something strange happens. Roy puts June to sleep, becasue she wasn't coping well, and it starts a sequence that shows june half waking up to see Roy, and herself in increasingly dangerous situations, that Roy obviously gets them out of. In another movie this may have been an interesting scene, but in a movie where very little interesting happens, to skip over potentially entertaining sequences is a diservice to the viewer. The worst part is that they do this twice. Unacceptable.The action is the movies only redeeming quality. Unfortunately Roy is such a badass, none of the fights have any weight; you always know who is going to win. It is never even a contest.

Roy has the device, codename Zephyr, that the federal agents and arms dealers are looking for, the thing that will change the world.  We're never really sure *how* exactly, but just go along - it will.  Roy also knows where the quirky genius (Paul Dano) who developed the technology is hiding, and if you can't find the Zephyr, the young scientist is the next best thing.Cameron Diaz plays the car restoring June Havens, a carefree lady who's just trying to get home but unwittingly gets caught up in Roy's world.  Cruise and Diaz are at least believable together - the chemistry between them is palpable.It's an around-the-world chase with stops in Austria, Spain, and Jamaica. As expected, there is plenty of action: hand-to-hand battles, gunfire galore, explosions, bulls, planes, trains, and automobiles.  Whew!  Apparently, more time was taken with producing the great action scenes than with developing a strong storyline, and the movie has quite a few holes in it and many unrealistic bits.  For example, June ""hasn't been anywhere and doesn't even have a passport,"" but Roy is able to move her freely about from country to country at will.  Also, there are many shoot-out scenes with bullets flying everywhere, from the weapons of professionals who apparently know how to shoot, but our hero and heroine are never harmed, except for one ""scratch"".  I know, I know - it's Hollywood...Besides the action, another saving grace is all the comedy in the movie, with many of the laughs delivered by Cruise in an over-the-top, yet controlled psychotic manner.

Well, I am sorry to have missed it on the big screen as I truly enjoyed it on the small screen when we rented the DVD last night. This is pure, unadulterated fun! Cameron Diaz, in a role that is almost tailor-made for her, plays June Havens, who works on restoring classic cars. Her normal life takes a turn for the bizarre when she meets a mysterious man named Roy (Tom Cruise). Soon, June finds herself getting caught up in some serious action, being pursued by strange men who seem bent on harming her, and of course, gets taken along for the ride of her life (albeit reluctantly) by Roy.There are many holes in the plot and if you question each and every implausibility, you'll never be able to enjoy the movie for what it is - mindless, fun entertainment. I laughed out loud at many points in this movie, especially at the comic interactions between Roy and June. Each time Roy feels he needs to 'exit' with June, he puts June 'under', so that she is unconscious. Miraculously, every time, June finds herself outfitted in new clothes, and even a bikini at one point. Now, I initially questioned this bit - how the heck did Roy find the time to shop for a suitable, right-sized outfit for June? After a while, I gave up and just enjoyed the movie with all of its implausibilities.The action is almost non-stop, and takes viewers to some exotic locales. Part of what makes this movie fun to watch is not so much the action sequences which frankly are not all that impressive, certainly not in the league of movies like Mission Impossible, but the credible chemistry between Cruise and Diaz. The couple sizzle on-screen with their sexual chemistry and good looks, but it is the banter between the two that had me in stitches.
