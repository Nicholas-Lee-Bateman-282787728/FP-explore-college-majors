I basically purchased this because of the excellent price, and thought I'd give the other two movies a go.  After all, Moving seems to have rave reviews on here.The Mack and Greased Lightning are great and well worth the purchase.  Uptown Saturday Night I think I've seen maybe twenty years ago but haven't had a chance to watch it yet.  I have to say though that I turned Moving off before it even reached the end of the film.  This would be one of the least funny comedies I've ever seen, it was painful to watch and I felt embarrassed for the actors.  I guess if you like National Lampoon you might like it.Greased Lightning is the story of NASCAR legend Wendell Scott.  It also stars Pam Grier and Beau Bridges.  It has its faults but overall it is a good movie.  The Mack is a classic of its genre.  I am hoping that Uptown Saturday Night will not disappoint but I can't recommend Moving.",3,"Moving is awful, get it for the others",1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,965,"['already', 'had', 'copy', 'Mack', 'DVD', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'VHS', 'basically', 'purchased', 'excellent', 'price', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'go', 'Moving', 'have', 'rave', 'reviews', 'here.The', 'Mack', 'Greased', 'Lightning', 'are', 'great', 'well', 'purchase', 'Uptown', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'maybe', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'yet', 'have', 'say', 'turned', 'Moving', 'off', 'even', 'reached', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'least', 'funny', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'felt', 'embarrassed', 'actors', 'guess', 'like', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'might', 'like', 'it.Greased', 'Lightning', 'story', 'NASCAR', 'legend', 'Wendell', 'Scott', 'also', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'faults', 'overall', 'good', 'movie', 'Mack', 'classic', 'genre', 'am', 'hoping', 'Uptown', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Moving']",4 Film Favorites: Richard Pryor (Greased Lightning / The Mack / Moving / Uptown Saturday Night)
