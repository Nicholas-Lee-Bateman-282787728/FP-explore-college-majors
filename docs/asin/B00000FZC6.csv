500568,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00000FZC6,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[11, 25]","Song of the South is chalk full of controversy.  It seems to be the black horse in Disney's library of films, constantly hiding and used to politically slander the family-friendly film company.  I will be the first to agree that Disney is slowly loosing its grasp on the pulse of children's cinema with their recent flops and horrid strands of marketing (i.e. why isn't Lilo & Stitch a more popular film?), but after watching Song of the South I don't think they need to worry about any backlash with this film.  I agree that the vision of slavery is extremely skewed, with the truths hidden and the darkness completely removed, but this Disney animation/live-action film is no different, no more racist, than Gone with the Wind.  There I have said it.  I recently had the opportunity to watch Gone with the Wind and completely disliked it because it is such an American favorite, yet it is utterly racist.  Those that argue that it depicts honesty for the time, I will agree with, but it doesn't have to be such a staple to our film community.  With this film constantly getting new DVD face-lifts and awards, I cannot help but wonder why Song of the South continues to be the poster child of evil.  When I watched Song of the South I saw nothing different than what I saw when I watched Gone with the Wind (sans the animated characters).  So I ask you, film reader, is it ""alright"" to like Gone with the Wind and completely dismiss Song of the South?I am a viewer that critically watches films.  While I do admire films that challenge me, I do find myself a bit more indulgent in children's films because they are a step away from the overbearing nature of adult cinema.  As I watched Song of the South, I was impressed with the steps that it took in the direction and imagination in creating live-action with animation.  It wasn't until really Cool World and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (and maybe Puff the Magic Dragon) that we saw this combination again.  So, on the side of creativity I have to give this film credit.  I also liked the stories that Remus today and enjoyed how it seemed that Johnny connected with these stories to use in his own life.  In future Disney films, I don't think that this would be such a big point because they tend to focus a bit more on the animation than the supposed story, but it was a breath of fresh air in this one.  I also enjoyed the stories that Remus told.  They were uplifting, honest, and simple.  No convoluted tale to frighten or upset just simple stories that could relate to anyone's lifestyle.  I believe the stories that Remus told in this film could be relevant in today's society, the idea of using your mind instead of your brawn is again, a lesson not taught often enough in cinema.  Song of the South was creative, but it also felt a bit bland.  It is due to the film's inability to stand fully up during its songs or core characters, that I couldn't fully admit that this was Disney's best.  It was sloppy, and it is because of this sloppiness (not the racism) that this film should remain just another notch in Disney's belt.What upset me the most about this film, again, wasn't the racism, but the sporadic scenes, flat acting by everyone outside of Remus, and the choice of actors to put behind the words of the animated critters.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the animated bits, but I just didn't like the actors chosen to voice Br'er Rabbit, Fox, or Bear.  I believe this is the core of the racism discussion.  For me, they just didn't seem to fit the personalities of the animated characters.  There wasn't enough separation between Remus' real life at the plantation to that of the animated segments.  I wanted to be taken away from the plantation and away from the debacle of slavery, but I just didn't get it with this film.  The animated characters sounded too much like Remus, and that bothered me a bit.  The next issue surrounds the actors like Bobby Driscoll, Ruth Warrick, Lucile Watson, and Erik Rolf who never quite congealed into a family dynamic at all.  Bobby Driscoll felt like he had taken ten years a Julliard by the age of four, and I continually felt that when the director yelled ""CUT"", Driscoll would curse, bring out a huge cigar, and have a deep raspy voice.  He was good, but overly good.  At times Driscoll's Johnny made me sick to my stomach.  Then there were the scenes between Hattie and Remus which hinted towards something, but never quite developed.  The conflicts between Ginny, Johnny, and the Favers boys just seemed too clich&eacute; and completely overdrawn, especially for a children's film.  There wasn't enough reason for the two boys to constantly harass Johnny ... again more development would have been nice.  It was just these smaller segments of this film that transformed this Disney cult classic into a mediocre film.  Walt could have done better.What would this film be without hinting towards slavery?  I am under the utmost belief that this is not the horrid film that others seem to paint it to be.  While I utterly agree that slavery is the darkest cloud in this nation, this film is not going to suddenly bring people up in arms.  I will also agree that it paints a false picture of slavery for those watching it, but I don't think it is going to confuse children.  What I believe needs to happen is that groups need to look past the fake-slavery/plantation owner moments and see this film for what it truly is ... one that could have the potential to educate children to use their minds instead of their brawn.  I believe there are even deeper meanings in this film that children would enjoy more than the big car chases, explosions, and bathroom humor allowed in so many other films deemed ""quality"" children's cinema.  Song of the South fails at painting an accurate portrait of the south, but honestly people, can we not agree that Disney has never painted an accurate picture of anything in their films.  This is just another glossed image of reality that Disney has maintained throughout the course of its film career.Overall, I thought it was a fun film to watch, but don't know if I could watch it again.  Get past the racism on this film, I think you will find more in the American loved feature Gone with the Wind, and you will see this as a film that will help our children grow stronger, with their minds - not with their fists.  With some retooling, I believe this film could be released and considered a strong Disney contender.  I enjoyed this film, but not enough to watch again and again.  It isn't my favorite Disney, but not one that I believe deserves all the negative publicity that it has seemingly been handed.  Watch it once, it is worth at least that much!Grade: *** out of *****",3,You can't run away from trouble.

At first disconsolate, the boy is cheered up by African-American handyman Uncle Remus (James Baskett), who tells him many delightful fables concerning the clever trickster Br'er Rabbit, whose adventures are illustrated in cartoon form. Each story has a moral, which Johnny applies to the exigencies of his real life. Johnny's mother (Ruth Warrick) disapproves of Uncle Remus, and orders the boy never to visit the kindly old black man again.

500574,AE8LL9S715YTE,B00000FZC6,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[15, 16]","First let me say this, plain, simple, racism is wrong.  Racism is more than just wrong though, it is pure evil.  One should never judge another by the colour of the skin.  One should never make presumptions toward another by the race of that person.  Yes this film could be said to have stereotypical blacks AND whites, but this film is not racism per say.  Simplistic yes, but then again, this is a children's movie, not something you'd see as drama on cable tv.  Unlike most films of today, this film is truly suited for parents and their children.  The stories are important because they have life lessons that any body...no matter how young or old...can learn with a smile and a nod to the head toward wisdom.  Children can laugh out loud with their folks at the humor of rabbit, fox, and bear.  Song of the South is a well developed movie that might yes be showing a simpler time, but at least it shows something descent for those watching...unlike the two examples I am about to give toward what true racism is...Yes still so many people cry the racism card toward this movie.  I am a firm believer that racism is wicked, but those people calling this movie racism seem to be quite quiet in terms of what is seen in this day and age.  I am about to give two examples of what racism is, in comparison to the Song of the South. Example 1:  I turned on the comedy network the other day, during the day time, during hours that children can easily watch, and there were African American comedians laughing and snickering because they call each other the ""N"" word.  As if the ""N"" word was a joke?  I would like to remind those who use that word so frivolously of the painting by Norman Rockwell of the young African American girl in a white dress being brought to school.  If you know the picture, you know what I mean.  I doubt very seriously she'd say yes if you asked that girl if the ""N"" word was ""funny.""  Example 2:  Grand Theft Auto SA, the latest game in that PS2 series.  This game is not only violent and destructive, it gives a thumbs up toward the life of a gangster--killing other African Americans because they are in other gangs, killing police men (especially white) just because the character's can kill the police, drugs, prostitution, etc. etc.These two examples are far greater and more important examples of what racism is, and the destructive nature of racism...Songs of the South, on the other hand, is not.  I think that if Disney had any sense in their mind they would put this movie out because this movie is a great movie for all to see.",5,An amazing movie despite those who are politically correct,1104451200,"12 31, 2004",2004,2564,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'plain', 'simple', 'racism', 'wrong', 'Racism', 'more', 'just', 'wrong', 'pure', 'evil', 'One', 'should', 'never', 'judge', 'colour', 'skin', 'One', 'should', 'never', 'make', 'presumptions', 'race', 'person', 'Yes', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'stereotypical', 'blacks', 'whites', 'film', 'not', 'racism', 'say', 'Simplistic', 'yes', 'then', 'again', 'children', 'movie', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'see', 'drama', 'cable', 'tv', 'most', 'films', 'today', 'film', 'truly', 'suited', 'parents', 'children', 'stories', 'are', 'important', 'have', 'life', 'lessons', 'body', 'matter', 'how', 'young', 'old', 'can', 'learn', 'smile', 'nod', 'head', 'wisdom', 'Children', 'can', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'folks', 'humor', 'rabbit', 'fox', 'bear', 'Song', 'South', 'well', 'developed', 'movie', 'might', 'yes', 'be', 'showing', 'simpler', 'time', 'least', 'something', 'descent', 'watching', 'two', 'examples', 'am', 'give', 'what', 'true', 'racism', 'Yes', 'still', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'cry', 'racism', 'card', 'movie', 'am', 'firm', 'believer', 'racism', 'wicked', 'people', 'calling', 'movie', 'racism', 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'quiet', 'terms', 'what', 'seen', 'day', 'age', 'am', 'give', 'two', 'examples', 'what', 'racism', 'comparison', 'Song', 'South', 'Example', '1', 'turned', 'comedy', 'network', 'other', 'day', 'day', 'time', 'hours', 'children', 'can', 'easily', 'watch', 'were', 'African', 'American', 'comedians', 'laughing', 'snickering', 'call', 'other', 'N', 'word', 'N', 'word', 'was', 'joke', 'would', 'like', 'remind', 'who', 'use', 'word', 'so', 'frivolously', 'painting', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'girl', 'white', 'dress', 'being', 'brought', 'school', 'know', 'picture', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'doubt', 'very', 'seriously', ""'d"", 'say', 'yes', 'asked', 'girl', 'N', 'word', 'was', 'funny', 'Example', '2', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'SA', 'latest', 'game', 'PS2', 'series', 'game', 'not', 'only', 'violent', 'destructive', 'thumbs', 'up', 'life', 'gangster', 'killing', 'other', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'other', 'gangs', 'killing', 'police', 'men', 'especially', 'white', 'just', 'character', 'can', 'kill', 'police', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'etc', 'etc.These', 'two', 'examples', 'are', 'far', 'greater', 'more', 'important', 'examples', 'what', 'racism', 'destructive', 'nature', 'racism', 'Songs', 'South', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'think', 'Disney', 'had', 'sense', 'mind', 'would', 'put', 'movie', 'out', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'see']",N/A
500575,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00000FZC6,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[166, 167]","First of all, let's clear up the rumor mill. The NAACP nor any other civil rights group or leader has anything to do with SOS being off the market today. Disney withdrew the film after a 1986 theatrical rerelease on their own accord. It's true that some NAACP members griped about the film upon its initial release in 1946, but they've had other priorities since then.So back to the film. I'm an African American historian and folklore fanatic myself who grew up with elders spellbinding me with stores much as James Baskette/Uncle Remus does with the children in this movie. So I love this aspect of the film! The animated segments integrate well with the action and the B'rer Rabbit tales are real knee-slappers that gave me some hearty belly-laughs upon viewing this DVD in its entirety last night.One could argue that one drawback of this film is that it paints too rosy a picture of slavery/sharecropping (the film itself is never clear whether it's during or after slavery, but Joel Chandler's original book was set during sharecropping). But that can be cured by parents checking out some books about the realities of this era and discussing all this with their kids afterwards.However all but the most hard-nosed and bitter will agree that this film has some good things to say about race relations and human relations in general. It is clear as the rich white boy looks admiringly at Uncle Remus from his bedroom window after a storytelling session that he has tremendous respect for this black man's mind. While Uncle Remus may not be educated in the European/American sense of the word, he is certainly more of a force to be reckoned with as opposed to the typical Black characterizations of this era and is posessed with a dignity all his own.This was not unusual for the actor James Baskette. He also played a very dignified preacher named Reverend Johnson in the Amos and Andy comedies. He deservedly received a special academy award for Uncle Remus shortly before his death a few years later. (BTW-Johnny Lee, who played Lawyer Calhoun in A&A;, was also the voice of Brer Rabbit).Many people are aware that the film was based on Joel Chanbdler Harris' 1881 book ""Uncle Remus' Songs and Sayings"" and that the white Georgian Harris based his book on the ""Brer (brother) animal tales"" passed orally among African-American slaves. What most people don't know is that a decade earlier, another white writer named Abbie Holmes Christensen recorded Brer Rabbit tales being told among ex-slaves around Port Royal, SC for her pioneering book ""Afro-American Folktales."" I have met many older African-Americans in rural South Carolina who had heard ""rabbit stories"" (as they are called among the indigenous) from their elders without knowing of Harris or this movie. So this is a legitimate part of Black culture.The movie actually improves on Harris' book in a number of ways. The ""N'word"" is tossed frequently in Harris' book and Harris' Uncle Remus is shown as preferring slavery to education. James Baskette's character lacks these negative aspects. The thread story of the little boy who turns to Uncle remus from his troubled relationship with his family is expanded from the book's brief framing devices of the white boy simply enjoying the old man's stories.So if you want an accurate history of Blacks during this era, not quite! But if you believe that children should be exposed to the joys of storytelling and the idea that friendship goes beyond age, race, and social class-then this is for the children and for the child in you!

I took two of my young children to see the movie last year at Mary Washington College.  It was a special showing for educational purposes that mostly included members of the community and a few students.  The showing was from a Japanese video where it has been distributed in English with Japanese subtitles.Myself, the audience, and my children thoroughly enjoyed the Zip a Dee Do Da song, the mixture of animation with live actors, and the Brer Rabbit stories.  The children still talk about those parts of the movie now several months later.  However, the overall quality of the movie and the story are not as one might be led to believe.The acting of several adult characters is rather poor (except for the actor playing Uncle Remus) and at times laughable (especially the mother of the main child).  The main character's parents have a rift in their marriage and the father is involved in some unspoken problem that is the reason the family is staying at the plantation.  Also, there is an ambiguous death scene and class hostility among the whites.The movie is actually without reference to whether the time involves slavery or post slavery.  I think the time is post war, and the former slaves are farming the land for the plantation owner.  While some who have written reviews may remember the characterizations as mostly harmless, many of the characters and their situations were troubling to observe.  For example, white children are shown bossing black adults with the black adults weakly submitting to these children.  The Uncle Remus character is highly fearful of offending any of the white characters and his place in the plantation is anything but secure.  Also, there are the scenes of the smiling blacks laughing and singing after work as if every day were Sunday and they had no labor with plenty of food in their stomachs.Overall, I would not oppose the film's release, but Disney should not be condemned for refusing to do so.  Contrary to popular belief, the film was not a financial success at the time of original release.  And those who are recalling the film after decades of having first seen it, are likely doing so with faulty memory.

In this case, even inferred.  That is the reason they dumped Michael Jackson's ""Captain EO"" and had subordinate Mirimax dump Michael Moore.  (I would like to add that Disney, after refusing to release ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", sold the film to the two brothers-executives of Mirimax, who subsequently made more money on that film than DISNEY made on any film of theirs that year; so, how could it possibly be against their shareholders?

American history shows us that Indians, Negro's and Arabs have been used, discriminated (and killed...) for the American ideal. Any books and films that try to deny or sugarcoat it SHOULD be controversial. So for example James Earl Jones wants it released, fine, but Sidney Poitier does not. So this film is controversial. That's a fact.Fair enough and point taken; after all this film has become famous for it.However not releasing it in the US but releasing it in other countries is measuring with different sticks. Apparently Disney released VHS and Laserdiscs copies and hence all the bootleg copies now.The film is now an important classic and can be seen with the above in mind but still enjoyed for its undeniable value. After all we are not talking about some Nazi or KKK propaganda film here, it is a children/ family film made a bit too nave.Nothing more, nothing less.A dilemma for Disney; they need to be politically correct and don't know what to do. Yes, individually you can get a bootleg and donate 10$ to an organization for the rights of black people at the same time and you're ready.Disney could also make a special edition of this film, with a booklet and footage of the controversy about it and donate all profits to a comparable good cause. That would be a classy solution for everyone; Disney, people who like the film and people who could be offended by it.Though if being `politically' correct is important then Disney should release their WHOLE catalogue on good DVD's, not just 4 (!) as a `Vault Disney' (ironically a proper name...) and 6 (!)

Yeah...Being so correct does not seem to be a priority for Disney as shown before by the release of SOTH on VHS and Laserdisc abroad.Films are not just `owned' by the company that holds the distribution rights, they are our cultural heritage and should be released in the best possible way, so everyone can enjoy them. THAT is the task of the distributors and that's why a consortium of many companies invented the DVD format.It also makes me wonder; doesn't the management of Disney want to see their own films on their own plasma screens at home? Do they even like their job or their products?Also DVD was set up as a standard so we could all enjoy films in with a sharp and anamorphic widescreen picture, digital surround sound and have 29 different languages of subtitles and if available, extra's. Seeing the many, many complaints about many DVD releases we know that studio's are out of line here. Disney, Colombia, Miramax, the French Studio Canal and others.Besides that it is commercially stupid not to use everything the format has to offer and release as much as possible.Studios should also be forced by government to ALWAYS include subtitles for the hard of hearing.And all this from a European right-winger like myself!

Beyond any doubt it is Disney's most controversial. Not released in any form in the American market and officially retired by Disney in 1986, I finally had a chance to see the film recently. The story of Uncle Remus and his folk tales is well worth seeing despite its racist overtones.The story follows the adventures of a young boy in post Civil War Atlanta who has come to live at his grandmother's plantation when his father leaves the family to work in Atlanta. Adrift and friendless the child meets and befriends a former slave named Uncle Remus. Through Remus' folk tale of Brer Rabbit and his friends he teaches the child valuable life lessons.Is the film worth seeking out? The answer is absolutely. The film presents some of Disney's best animation. This animation is uniquely blended with live action to create a seamless whole. The film's live action pales when compared to the animated sequences. In fact when the film was retired many of the animated sequences were merged into other programming.The music from the film is also essential Disney. The film won the Academy Award for best original song and was nominated for its score.The film is not so much racist but the product of its times. It probably wasn't the best choice for Disney but it remains what it is: a faithful retelling of the Joel Chandler Harris stories. The important question is when or if Disney should re-release the film. The answer will depend in the long run on both perceived political correctness as well as economics. This is too valuable a property for the company to let fall into the public domain. If Disney wants to preserve the film it must take the lead. Many inferior versions are available anyway and a pristine print would be appreciated.The disc I viewed was the UK PAL version. The Technicolor picture was slightly washed out but the soundtrack was vibrant and strong. The only real extras were copies of the 1972 and 1986 release trailers. Also included was the 1946 Johnny Mercer radio spot promoting his recordings of some of the film's songs which is interesting from a historical point of view. The version I saw included two easy to find Easter eggs of two controversial cartoons from the period. The first Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarfs is one of Warner Brothers censored eleven which also needs to be preserved as part of animation history. The second: The Martins and the Coys is a retelling of the Hatfield and McCoy feud that Disney deemed to violent for its chosen audience.

I got a PAL copy of this movie and have watched it recently, after not seeing it for years and, being a history teacher, there are just some assumptions going on out there that simply aren't true.First, the African-Americans depicted in the movie are NOT slaves.  The most likely role these people play is share cropers on the plantation.  Case in point:  Uncle Remus is told to leave and leaves by his own free will - he is not sold.  This would have not occured during slave times.Indeed, the main division in this film is not by race but by class.  The poor white family is treated the same as the African-Americans and appear to live under the same conditions.An older, single widowed woman during these times would have needed share cropers to keep the plantation opperating, trading use of a small parcel of land for work on the plantation.

500606,A35J4XGRWXVZ00,B00000FZC6,Edward,"[28, 29]","I'm pleased to see all the customer reviews praising Walt Disney's 1946 Technicolor feature ""Song of the South"", and I want to add my support for its (hopefully soon) transfer to DVD. This is one of Disney's most engaging movies and one of the first (perhaps the first -- references are a little vague) to combine animation with live action, a process which TV commercials have made as common as soapy dishwater. The 57-year old technology here is remarkably sophisticated, the ""toons"" often sharing the screen with the live actors. As a matter of fact, there are two directorial credits, Wilfred Jackson for animation and Harve Foster for live-action. (Evidently, Uncle Walt really had  little to do with this production.) Based on the Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris (1848-1908), the plot is simple and sentimental: a little Southern boy travels with his parents to visit his grandmother only to learn that his father is moving on. Feeling hurt and lonely, Johnny accepts Uncle Remus, a middle-aged black man, as his father-figure friend and, from him, hears the adventures of clever Br'er Rabbit, malicious Br'er Fox, and dumb really dumb Br'er Bear. (""Br'er"" was the 19th Century equivalent of ""Bro"".) The earnest child star Bobby Driscoll plays Johnny, the sensitive James Baskett plays Uncle Remus (he was given a special Oscar), and their rapport is perfectly presented. What the racial discrimination or degradation or whatever is all about leaves me completely flummoxed. Obviously, the black characters are not slaves (judging from the costumes, the story takes place in the 1870's or 1880's), and all of them are depicted as warm and intelligent. I suspect many people object to the original Harris stories, written in a heavy dialect, rather than to the movie itself. (Incidently, the film's working title was ""Uncle Remus"".)  The censure of unpleasant stereotypes could much easier be aimed at ""Gone With the Wind"", what with the hysterically inane Prissy and the black potential robber/rapist in the Shantytown sequence. (""Song of the South"" shares several elements with ""GWTW"", not the least of which is Hattie McDaniel tracing her Mammy performance.) The story's ""villains"" are two trailer-trash white boys who are the live-action approximations of Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. Aristocratic-looking Ruth Warrick (who played Charles Foster Kane's first wife) is Johnny's mother, and if the character seems a little cold one assumes it's because she's going through a bad time with her marriage -- not to mention dealing with her mother, the tiresome Lucile Watson. This being a Disney picture, there is a Broadwayish score including the Oscar-winning ""Zip a Dee Doo Dah"" and a playful ballad ""Sooner or Later (You're Going to Be Coming Around)"", which Hattie McDaniel sings while baking pies. When this song was popularized the lyric ""want my cookin' again"" was changed to ""want my lovin' again"", and there's just the slightest hint that the Hattie McDaniel character and Uncle Remus have had a ""thing"". Altogether, ""Song of the South"" is beautifully realized, Americana at its most charming, and to deny it DVD status is sort of like denying Br'er Rabbit his brier patch.

More to the point, Buena Vista Home Entertainment could really use a hit right about now.Don't believe me? Then go check out Disney's financial reports for the first quarter of 2005. Where you'll discover that the Mouse's accountants actually blame the 20% drop in revenue that the company's Studio Entertainment division recently experienced on lower DVD sales of current-year films.Given that Disneyana fans have been clamoring for a ""Song of the South"" DVD for nearly a decade now, BVHE execs are hoping that all of this pent-up demand will eventually translate in really big sales for this disc. Disney is hoping to sell at least 10-12 million units of this particular motion picture.""But aren't Disney Company execs concerned about how the African American community may response to 'Song of the South' 's release of DVD?,"" you continue. Yep. I won't lie to you folks. There's a lot of people in the Team Disney Burbank building who are very concerned that -- by releasing this much maligned motion picture on home video & DVD -- that the Mouse House is potentially opening itself up to a ton of bad publicity.With the hope of avoiding that, BVHE reportedly plans to really pile on the extra features with ""Song of the South."" Among the ideas currently being knocked around is producing a special documentary that -- through use of clips from that TV movie version of Rodgers & Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" that Disney produced back in 1997 as well as sequences from ""The Proud Family"" & ""That's So Raven"" -- would demonstrate that a person's color really doesn't matter at the modern Walt Disney Company. There's also talk of including Walt Disney Feature Animation's seldom-seen short, ""John Henry,"" as one of the disc's special features.Buena Vista Home Entertainment is also supoosedly toying with approaching a prominent African-American performer to serve as the MC on the DVD version of ""Song of the South."" You know, someone who could then introduce the film, explain its historical significance as well as re-enforcing the idea that ""SOTS"" was a product of a much less enlightened time in Hollywood's history. I'm told that -- up until recently -- Bill Cosby was actually at the top of Disney's wish list. But now that Dr. Cosby has been accused of inappropriate behavior with several ladies ... Well, let's just say that Bill is no longer Mickey's top choice for this position.Anywho ... There's one other aspect of this ""Song-of-the-South""-soon-on-on-DVD saga that I guess I should mention. Which is why Buena Vista Home Entertainment is low-balling its predictions of the number of units that ""SOTS"" might sell (I.E. 10-12 million versus ""Finding Nemo"" 's 39 million+ units). Why is that, do you suppose? Mind you, it's not because ""Song of the South"" is decidedly old fashioned (Well, what do you expect from a 60 year-old motion picture?), but rather .... Here, why don't I let my source inside BVHE explain:""This movie isn't nearly as good as people seem to remember it being. Sure, the animated sequences are charming. But the pace of the rest of the picture is so damned pokey.Which is why I seriously doubt that we'll get all that many letters about ""Song of the South"" 's racial content. The way I figure it, most kids & adults will be nodding off 30 minutes into the thing. And people who are sleeping can't write letters of complaint.""Well, I don't know about that. But what I can tell you folks is to stop bidding NOW on those black market ""SOTS"" DVDs that keep popping up on eBay. For -- if you can just wait another 17-18 months -- you can actually purchase a really-for-real authorized version of Disney's ""Song of the South"" of your very own.",5,Song of the South DVD to go on

I had all the classic animated features except this one. I also grew up on Disney Sing Along videos and had the Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah one. So i have known the songs since age 4! My family also takes trips to Disneyworld every year and we love Splash Mountain. I had always heard that Disney would not release this film on video/dvd because of racial material. I was at a comic convention the other day and bought a copy of the film converted into vhs. The sound isn't good but it dosen't distract from the brillance of the film. I couldn't find a racist part in the whole movie! On the plantation, there are many black people, but they are never refered to as slaves and they are not treated in cruel manners. They are spoken to by white people in a way with respect. The only black person ever seen working is the cook and she is happy and singing a song! If you didn't know your history, you would swear that it was just a village with a lot of black people. And the story is very good. It's about a young boy who's parents clearly are seperating (although they are never shown fighting). His father leavs his mother and him at his grandma's plantation and the dad goes back home leaving the boy heartbroken. He makes friends with a little black boy and a girl who's two older brothers bully her around. But what really helps him get through tough times are the stories told by Uncle Remus about Brear Rabbit and all the conflicts he come across. When the boys mother decides that the stories are giving the boy the wrong ideas and forbids Uncle Remus to see the boy, It'll take his parents to reunite to help him recover from a tragic accident. The songs are amazing. The film is rated G and I feel Disney is robbing us by not releasing it. Pretty soon, Disney will find that people are buying these illegal copies and will be out of money when they do release it because everyone will have bought a copy. Disney should act fast. I hear that their video department is losing money and hope that Show White sales will bring them out of their slump, but if it's not enough, they could make a ton of money off this.

The last time I was able to see it was in the mid 80's at a sm theater in Hickory NC. To the best of my knowledge it was never released here in the US on VHS or DVD. I wrote Disney studios 10 yrs ago & asked if they would consider releasing it & gave many reasons as to why they should. I went so far as to point out that I bet Walt Disney would turn over in his grave if he knew that sooo...many generations of kids did not have the joy of seeing such a wonderful movie. A few months ago, I called Disney studios asking about future releases. I was told that Disney would not be releasing TSOTS at any time [now, or in the future], but The Prince & The Pauper + The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh were possibles. I refused to give up on TSOTS though & I was finally rewarded. A digitally remastered version of Disney's 1st live action movie is now available! A company in Georgia: [Classic Reels] sells the DVD. It plays in all regions & contains a # of extras. The extras have not been remastered, but 1 of them, the reading of The Uncle Remus Tales on the original LP is a wonderful addition regardless. The liner notes are wonderful too & point out that this movie centered around a time in the South AFTER the Civil War & thus the story is about a period in time when slavery had been abolished [+ 1 white family in the movie is just as poor as the blacks]. I have never approved of the slavery that existed LONG, LONG AGO in the South, so I was delighted to learn the TRUTH!

500610,A1B86SJOKGAZ3B,B00000FZC6,"E. Sadowski ""marine sis""","[6, 6]","Although plenty of people have already written their displeasure at not having ""Song of the South"" out on DVD, I would like to express myself as well. First off, the story takes place during Reconstruction which means AFTER the Civil War so Uncle Remus is an ex-slave. Yes, many blacks have chosen to stay on the plantation where they were formerly slaves for pay. Although the Civil War gave blacks freedom from slavery this does not mean that there still wasn't discrimination against the blacks. Yes, that is basic history as well. However, as survivors of slavery many people took pleasure in simple things like going fishing without needing permission or moving to other states without having hound dogs pursue them. Not everyone had a chip on his shoulder and people like Uncle Remus actually existed meaning joyful, wise, and caring. As Americans, our past history isn't always fun but there are dark stains as well like slavery which we should never forget because it is tragic. Teaching the truth to children is very important without any liberal spin to the truth.Furthermore, we have another dark stain such as political correctness which in today's times means censorship. One of the leading culprits is Disney which is an insult to Walt's memory because he always made films that are family friendly and oftentimes taught moral lessons. Walt always loved children and would never produce an insulting cartoon or movie for them. For those who don't care to have ""Song of the South"" on DVD do not seem to realize the danger of censorship including self-censorship. SOTO is laughably considered controversial yet if you care about family friendly films or cartoons just look at what modern Disney is producing: potty mouthed characters, children disrespectful towards their elders, fart jokes, etc. This is what today's kids should emulate? SERIOUSLY?Besides, SOTO portrays a positive spin based on African folktales where a black man teaches some white children lessons through storytelling. Storytelling is a tradition among the black folks and James Baskett does a wonderful performance of Uncle Remus. In 1946 this is more of an exception than the rule. What baffles me is that there is never any protest from the black community (as far as I know) when blacks are portrayed as drug pushers/addicts, prostitutes, welfare recipients with 10 children, jailbirds, cursing all the time especially with n****** this and n****** that, etc. Is that what one is in real life ALL the time? Are we, the viewing public, supposed to believe that there is nothing else to a black person? Is there nothing POSITIVE that a black person contributes in life? Of course there is plenty BUT where are all the good films portraying the POSITIVE side of black folk?Well, the only way to view positive movies is to watch cable and such films as ""Something the Lord Made"", ""Gifted Hands"", ""A Lesson Before Dying"", etc. Oh, yes, ""Akeelah and the Bee"" was released a few years ago in the movies and a war film that is out just now about the black air force men (forgot the name) but by far fewer than should be. My point is: ""Song of the South"" belongs in the same category as these other wonderful films. PLEASE CONTACT DISNEY AND BOMBARD THEM WITH EMAILS! Censorship is dangerous. We, the buying public, are intelligent enough to be our own censors and to know whether a children's movie musical is a good or bad buy. Disney needs to quit with their over-the-top liberal crap and give the consumers what we need.

The idea that this film would offend people on racial grounds, but that ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Birth of a Nation,"" both available on DVD, do not is simply ridiculous.  It also is hypocritical, since there is no hesitance to release any number of westerns that feature whites playing Indians who speak in idiotic pigeon English.To suppress this film is unfair to the actors who put so much into their characters.  Why should James Baskett or Bobby Driscoll be denied recognition for their wonderful performances?  The film also features seminal Disney animation in the segments with Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox and Brer Bear, who bring Uncle Remus's stories to life, a brilliant cinematic innovation.  This was the first film I can recall that combined animation with live actors, something Disney ought to be proud of.  And, despite its age, the film holds up quite well.  It is a piece of film history that deserves to be seen, enjoyed and discussed.In a year that will see our first black Presidential candidate, Disney ought to realize that our country has grown up quite a bit in the past 40 years and issue ""Song of the South"" on DVD.

500618,A2ITY3O2UPJLN8,B00000FZC6,J. Alec West,"[23, 23]","At Disney's 2006 Annual Shareholders Meeting held earlier this month in Anaheim, California, one shareholder present asked Disney CEO, Robert Iger, point-blank when the DVD would be released.  His question was met by thunderous applause from other shareholders.  This was Iger's reply, quote -""Um ... we've discussed this a lot.  We believe it's actually an opportunity from a financial perspective to put Song of the South out.  I screened it fairly recently because I hadn't seen it since I was a child, and I have to tell you after I watched it, even considering the context that it was made, I had some concerns about it because of what it depicted.  And thought it's quite possible that people wouldn't consider it in the context that it was made, and there were some [long pause] depictions that I mentioned earlier in the film that I think would be bothersome to a lot of people.  And so, owing to the sensitivity that exists in our culture, balancing it with the desire to, uh, maybe increase our earnings a bit, but never putting that in front of what we thought were our ethics and our integrity, we made the decision not to re-release it.  Not a decision that is made forever, I imagine this is gonna continue to come up, but for now we simply don't have plans to bring it back because of the sensitivities that I mentioned. Sorry.""Sorry indeed.  Keeping this film ""in the closet"" is an act of cowardice on the part of Disney Studios.  And by being timid, they are passing up a golden opportunity to set the record straight.  The DVD should be released - but done in an intelligent manner.  A statement by Iger himself should precede the film, telling movie watchers that the lifestyle depictions of post-Civil War African Americans are inaccurate ... and urging them to watch a special feature included on the DVD.  This special feature would be historical, telling it ""like it was"" both following the Civil War and in 1946 America.  And to illustrate the 1946 dilemma, Iger should mention that none of the African American performers in the film could come to the premiere in Atlanta ... not due to Disney ... but due to the fact that in the Atlanta of 1946, no African American performer could find hotel accommodations (for a very racist reason).  If any film studio could do a good job on such a feature, it would most likely be Disney Studios.  But, there are two other important reasons why the film deserves a DVD release.The first-ever African American male performer to receive an Academy Award was James Baskett for his portrayal of Uncle Remus in the film.  Withholding the film ""robs"" African Americans of that important milestone in their history.  Shortly after receiving his Oscar, Baskett died of a heart ailment.  And, the film itself also received an Academy Award (""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,"" Best Music, Original Song) and was nominated in another category (Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture).Movie watchers of ALL races deserve the right to revel in the film's good qualities while being mindful (and educated) as to its shortcomings.",4,The studio's timidity is more shameful than any problem with the film.,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,3067,"['Disney', '2006', 'Annual', 'Shareholders', 'Meeting', 'held', 'earlier', 'month', 'Anaheim', 'California', 'one', 'shareholder', 'present', 'asked', 'Disney', 'CEO', 'Robert', 'Iger', 'point-blank', 'when', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'question', 'was', 'met', 'thunderous', 'applause', 'other', 'shareholders', 'was', 'Iger', 'reply', 'quote', 'Um', ""'ve"", 'discussed', 'lot', 'believe', 'actually', 'opportunity', 'financial', 'perspective', 'put', 'Song', 'South', 'screened', 'fairly', 'recently', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'child', 'have', 'tell', 'watched', 'even', 'considering', 'context', 'was', 'made', 'had', 'concerns', 'what', 'depicted', 'thought', 'quite', 'possible', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'context', 'was', 'made', 'were', '[', 'long', 'pause', ']', 'depictions', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'bothersome', 'lot', 'people', 'so', 'owing', 'sensitivity', 'culture', 'balancing', 'desire', 'uh', 'maybe', 'increase', 'earnings', 'bit', 'never', 'putting', 'front', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'ethics', 'integrity', 'made', 'decision', 'not', 're-release', 'Not', 'decision', 'made', 'forever', 'imagine', 'gon', 'continue', 'come', 'up', 'now', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'plans', 'bring', 'back', 'sensitivities', 'mentioned', 'Sorry', 'Sorry', 'indeed', 'Keeping', 'film', 'closet', 'act', 'cowardice', 'part', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'being', 'timid', 'are', 'passing', 'up', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'done', 'intelligent', 'manner', 'statement', 'Iger', 'should', 'precede', 'film', 'telling', 'movie', 'watchers', 'lifestyle', 'depictions', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'African', 'Americans', 'are', 'inaccurate', 'urging', 'watch', 'special', 'feature', 'included', 'DVD', 'special', 'feature', 'would', 'be', 'historical', 'telling', 'was', 'following', 'Civil', 'War', '1946', 'America', 'illustrate', '1946', 'dilemma', 'Iger', 'should', 'mention', 'none', 'African', 'American', 'performers', 'film', 'could', 'come', 'premiere', 'Atlanta', 'not', 'due', 'Disney', 'due', 'fact', 'Atlanta', '1946', 'African', 'American', 'performer', 'could', 'find', 'hotel', 'accommodations', 'very', 'racist', 'reason', 'film', 'studio', 'could', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'feature', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'important', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'DVD', 'release.The', 'first-ever', 'African', 'American', 'male', 'performer', 'receive', 'Academy', 'Award', 'was', 'James', 'Baskett', 'portrayal', 'Uncle', 'Remus', 'film', 'Withholding', 'film', 'robs', 'African', 'Americans', 'important', 'milestone', 'history', 'Shortly', 'receiving', 'Oscar', 'Baskett', 'died', 'heart', 'ailment', 'film', 'also', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah', 'Best', 'Music', 'Original', 'Song', 'was', 'nominated', 'category', 'Best', 'Music', 'Scoring', 'Musical', 'Picture', 'watchers', 'ALL', 'races', 'deserve', 'right', 'revel', 'film', 'good', 'qualities', 'being', 'mindful', 'educated', 'shortcomings']",N/A

Decarlo ""Forever Boomer""","[1, 1]","The fact that 'Song Of The South' is no longer available and Disney refuses to bring it back, is a travesty of the highest order. 'PC' is destroying this country and those who cave into it stifle our history, creativity, honesty & all that was once good & made this country great. We should always embrace our history because simply put, we are who we are today because of it. Slavery was a dark part of our history for sure but to cover it up or deny it ever existed is to cheapen what we've learned from that chapter in our history. We cheapen what we've accomplished & become today, because of that very history. 'Song Of The South' IS a beautiful movie & certainly nothing to hide deep in the vaults. It's certainly not 'Mandingo' or for that matter, 'Gone With The Wind'. Should we pull 'GWTW' because it shows slavery? Back then Disney took a story based on beloved children's tales presenting it with all the sensitivity & dignity that it deserved. It's a fun filled, lighthearted, often humorous, sometimes sad tale of a boy growing up who didn't fit in. A kindly old slave known as Uncle Remus understands what the boy is going through and decides to help him by telling him stories of a cunning & crafty old character called Brer' Rabbit. These stories come alive bringing live action & animation together, the way only Walt Disney could do it. Plus he gives us one of the most memorable, beloved, songs in Disney history, ""Zip-A-Dee-Do-Dah"". Through these stories the boy learns how to stand up for himself, how to deal with others, how to get out of tight situations. The love that exists between the boy & Uncle Remus tugs at your heart. Uncle Remus understands the boy more than his parents & the relationship they forge is truly beautiful. It's representative of all that is pure, good & human. It transcends 'color' & for that it should be celebrated not shunned. If Uncle Walt were still here, I'm sure he would agree. He loved this story & felt it was one of his proudest achievements. To continue to deny 'Song Of The South' to the public would be a huge disservice to Uncle Walt but remains a travesty for the very public it was intended for.

500629,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00000FZC6,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[5, 6]","If nothing else, SONG OF THE SOUTH is arguably the most hotly debated Disney production ever made.  Released to war-weary audiences in 1946, this movie was another exercise in combining live-action with animation, but simultaneously it happens to be an iconic film in Walt Disney's career.  At the time, much of the studio's financial resources were cut off, so it was very expensive to produce a full-length animated feature.  Since it was economically feasible to mesh live-action with short cartoons, it's no surprise that SONG OF THE SOUTH ended up becoming one such title.The animated segments, arguably the most appealing aspect of the movie, are based on the famous literature stories of Brer Rabbit, whose habit for getting into and out of trouble makes him an invulnerable target for adversaries Brer Fox and Brer Bear.  Walt Disney had always been a fan of these tales, as told by ""Uncle Remus,"" and this film was an effort to bring them to the screen.  On an aesthetic level, the three cartoons, in which our floppy-eared hero outsmarts his foes through psychology, are some of the most colorful and beautifully executed works to come out of the studio, but as stories in and of themselves, they are very intelligent, clever, and well-written.  Who could forget Brer Rabbit getting stuck in the gooey mass of a Tar Baby?  Or running away from his home in the Briar Patch?  Or even the infamous Laughing Place that turns out to be a beehive?  All three of these stories are somehow shoehorned into a live-action narrative in which a kindly old Negro, Uncle Remus (James Baskett, in an amazing performance for which he deserved more than just as ""special"" Oscar) uses his tales to help an unhappy little boy, Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) deal with his parents' separation, bullying brothers, the ownership of a dog, and his friendship with a cute little blondie named Ginny (Luana Patten).It is this central story where SONG OF THE SOUTH's roots of controversy lie within.  Although obviously meant to be harmless and innocent, the live-action plot sometimes feels intrusive.  We never find out the tension between Johnny's parents, nor do we learn anything about the concerns of Uncle Remus.  These scenes are also strangely discomforting at times, particularly the depiction of the various African-American characters (and I'm not talking about just Remus).  They speak in a surprisingly outrageous dialect and are shown to be quite content with their positions as ""slaves,"" going so far as to sing catchy folk songs while going to work.  Even though the movie is not intended to put across any such messages, these sequences can be tough to swallow, especially if you're a sensitive viewer.I also found it very bothersome that Remus is treated hideously by Johnny's misguided and arguably *bitchy* mother, who wrongfully believes that the old man's tales are only leading her boy astray.  Yet if Remus stands up to the mean-spirited brothers who torment the two leads, then why doesn't he do the same when he's around Johnny's mother?  (Granted, this was typical of the post-Civil War South, where this film is presumably set, but it's another source of discomfort that sometimes took me out of the film.)Ironically, it was because of such scenes that SONG OF THE SOUTH was made unavailable to the public for many years.  After a very profitable release in 1946 and subsequent reissues, criticisms of the aforementioned live-action sequences, particularly the roles of the African-Americans, skyrocketed so strongly that Disney locked the film away in its vault since 1986.  Consequently, the only way for fans of the film to purchase it for themselves was to purchase bootleg copies of a PAL VHS and/or import the laserdisc release from Japan.The criticisms surrounding SONG OF THE SOUTH are not unjustified; it may have trouble finding an audience in today's politically correct society.  But stripped of this controversy, is SONG OF THE SOUTH a likeable and beautiful movie?  Absolutely.  The animated sequences, as mentioned, are wonderful, the musical score is very tuneful, particularly the Academy Award winner ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"" and the catchy ""Laughing Place,"" and, if the live-action narrative seems superfluous (and unintentionally offensive), the performances by a majority of the cast makes it easier to stomach.  As mentioned, Baskett's Uncle Remus is portrayed perfectly; just as good are the youngsters, namely Driscoll and Patten, who manage to be both likeable and adorable but not saccharinely so.  The other adult actors do credible jobs, too, although their roles don't really stand out.On the whole, while the issues over the story and the even more controversial African-American depictions are bothersome, there is no denying that SONG OF THE SOUTH is indeed a lovely, sometimes charming film that has its heart in the right place.  Should this movie be released in America on DVD?  Definitely, although background information SHOULD be given about the film's ""slave"" characters in order to better educate viewers.  At this point, though, it seems unlikely that Disney ever will reconsider and bring SONG OF THE SOUTH to a new generation of fans.  Shameful, too, because in spite of its flaws, this movie does display positive messages of friendship and psychology... and yes, I have to confess, it's a classic.",5,A very controversial but

The movie is one of Disney's finest masterpieces, however due to the movie not being ""politically correct"" it has never been released in the United States. Having grown up in the south myself I can attest to the fact that Disney in no way ""exploits"" the negros, but instead portrays slavery as it really was, an everyday fact of life on the plantation. The story line is warm, telling the story of little Johnny coming  with his mamma to stay on his grandmothers plantation. Upon arrival he is befriended by Uncle Remus and it is through this friendship that he flourishes and thrives. The live action combined with animation is an art masterpiece. The musical score is beautifully done, including the award winning ""Zip A Dee Do Da"" ""Uncle Remus Said"" ""Everybody's Got A Laughing Place"".

My mother took us to the theater to see it. The place was packed with noisy kids, but they all went quiet when Uncle Remus started telling his stories. In the intervening years, the dreaded Political Correctness has relegated this movie to the Disney Vault, although I was able to find an imported copy. I recently watched it for the first time in 35 years and you know what? There's nothing wrong with it. It might have some stereotypes but nothing offensive or even questionable. Think of Gone with the Wind or some of the old Shirley Temple movies or even Our Gang. I certainly wouldn't think twice about letting my own children watch it.With that out of the way, SONG OF THE SOUTH is every bit as memorable as Pinocchio, another movie I just watched after too many years. In both cases, elements of the movies have entwined themselves around our collective consciousness. The Tar Baby, for example, is a metaphor I've heard used often. I use it myself. (Disney changed it to a Honey Baby on their Splash Mountain ride.) And who can forget Br'er Rabbit begging Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear not to toss him into the briar patch, which is just where he wanted to go. But the most memorable part of the movie has got to be Uncle Remus singing Zippity Do Da.As I said, SONG OF THE SOUTH is just a delightful movie that's gotten a bum rap.

It would be great if I were able to finally sit down and enjoy this masterpiece for what it is, but somebody feels so strongly about it's ""image"" within the Disney Studios that I along with a multitude of others cannot have the opportunity to view it. I feel that keeping this film behind closed doors is merely a statement that leans toward, ""Walt Disney made a mistake by making this film and it should never be viewed by anyone again, ever!""I cherish the work and ideals of Walt Disney and find it hard to believe that anything he gave his approval on was anything less than positive and supportive of all humanity in general. Keeping this film in the vault does nothing more than create a sense of mysterious ambiguity about the studio itself and proclaims infallably that Disney quite possibly did in fact create something racist and slanderous towards the black community.Disney Studios needs to release this film as soon as possible to allow the world a chance to see it as it is in it's unedited, original form so that creeping allegations of less than tasteful entertainment being created by Disney can be hung out to dry. I believe Leonard Maltin did a fantastic job of explaining the humor and original intent of the old black and white Disney Classics in the Walt Disney Treasures collections and never once have I heard big news about any kind of backlash resulting in the release of cartoons that did in fact poke fun at African Americans, Japanese, Mexicans and any other stereotypical ethnicities of the time. That's the way they were made, we understand things alot better today and there is no need to hide anything away out of fear of being called racist.Disney has done quite well showing it's commitment to embracing all ethnicities and peoples around the world. Why are they so afraid of this film? Let's hope they get over their phobia and finally release this film in all it's glory to all of us to share with each other without fear of reproach and allow this masterpiece to speak for itself instead of hushed rumors and confusing ""myths"" being all that is available to those of us that have not yet experienced it.",5,Why Hide This??,1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,2241,"['can', 'honestly', 'say', 'other', 'short', 'exerpts', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'entirety', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'were', 'able', 'finally', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'masterpiece', 'what', 'somebody', 'feels', 'so', 'strongly', 'image', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'along', 'multitude', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'opportunity', 'view', 'feel', 'keeping', 'film', 'closed', 'doors', 'merely', 'statement', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'made', 'mistake', 'making', 'film', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'again', 'ever', 'cherish', 'work', 'ideals', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'anything', 'gave', 'approval', 'was', 'anything', 'less', 'positive', 'supportive', 'humanity', 'general', 'Keeping', 'film', 'vault', 'nothing', 'more', 'create', 'sense', 'mysterious', 'ambiguity', 'studio', 'proclaims', 'infallably', 'Disney', 'quite', 'possibly', 'did', 'fact', 'create', 'something', 'racist', 'slanderous', 'towards', 'black', 'community.Disney', 'Studios', 'release', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'allow', 'world', 'chance', 'see', 'unedited', 'original', 'form', 'creeping', 'allegations', 'less', 'tasteful', 'entertainment', 'being', 'created', 'Disney', 'can', 'be', 'hung', 'out', 'dry', 'believe', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'explaining', 'humor', 'original', 'intent', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'Disney', 'Classics', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Treasures', 'collections', 'never', 'once', 'have', 'heard', 'big', 'news', 'kind', 'backlash', 'resulting', 'release', 'cartoons', 'did', 'fact', 'poke', 'fun', 'African', 'Americans', 'Japanese', 'Mexicans', 'other', 'stereotypical', 'ethnicities', 'time', 'way', 'were', 'made', 'understand', 'things', 'alot', 'better', 'today', 'need', 'hide', 'anything', 'away', 'fear', 'being', 'called', 'racist.Disney', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'showing', 'commitment', 'embracing', 'ethnicities', 'peoples', 'world', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'afraid', 'film', 'Let', 'hope', 'get', 'phobia', 'finally', 'release', 'film', 'glory', 'share', 'other', 'fear', 'reproach', 'allow', 'masterpiece', 'speak', 'instead', 'hushed', 'rumors', 'confusing', 'myths', 'being', 'available', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'experienced']",N/A

PHILLIPS,"[1, 1]","Song of the South of Zip-a-dee-doo-dah Fame may never be released in the U.S. because of the new ""Political Correctness"" fear that masks itself in censorship. You CAN buy this movie in Europe and Japan, but here in the U.S. we don't seem th be able to have the freedom to make up our own minds- The Disney Company is Hypocritical in that it SAYS it isn't right to show the movie here- but WILL sell it in ""other countries"". Read what others are saying:Argument Against Releasing Song of the South:March 11, 2006Disney CEO Robert Iger: ""No Song of the South Yet""During the question and answer session at Disney's 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in Anaheim, CA, the question was raised by a Disney shareholder why Song of the South has not been released. Here is a transcript:""My name is Howard Cromer. I live in Cypress, I'm a Disney shareholder. I'm actually delivering a message from my son, 10. He wants to know in recent years, in the midst of all your re-releases of your videos, why you haven't released Song of the South on your Disney Classics?"" [Applause] ""And, he wonders why. Frank Wells told me many years ago that it would be coming out. Well obviously Frank Wells isn't around anymore, so we still wonder why. And by the way, Mr. Inger, he thinks it was a very good choice when they made you CEO of Disney."" [Applause]Inger: ""Thank you very much. You may change your mind when I answer your question, though. Um... we've discussed this a lot. We believe it's actually an opportunity from a financial perspective to put Song of the South out. I screened it fairly recently because I hadn't seen it since I was a child, and I have to tell you after I watched it, even considering the context that it was made, I had some concerns about it because of what it depicted. And thought it's quite possible that people wouldn't consider it in the context that it was made, and there were some... [long pause] depictions that I mentioned earlier in the film that I think would be bothersome to a lot of people. And so, owing to the sensitivity that exists in our culture, balancing it with the desire to, uh, maybe increase our earnings a bit, but never putting that in front of what we thought were our ethics and our integrity, we made the decision not to re-release it. Not a decision that is made forever, I imagine this is gonna continue to come up, but for now we simply don't have plans to bring it back because of the sensitivities that I mentioned. Sorry.""And with that, folks, it doesn't look like we'll be seeing a 60th anniversary of Song of the South either. If you'd like to listen to the audio of this, please click here to visit Disney Corporate. The question is asked about 1hr. 43min. into the presentation. Thanks to everyone who informed me of this. And if you haven't signed the petition yet, you know what to do.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~James Baskett, the actor who magnificently portrayed ""Uncle Remus"", won a special Oscar for his efforts. The film's song, ""Zip-a-dee Do-Dah"", won the ""Best Song"" Academy Award for 1946.Although some Blacks have always been uneasy about the minstrel tradition of the Uncle Remus stories, the major objections to the Song of the South video had to do with the live action portions. The film has been criticized both for ""making slavery appear pleasant"" and ""pretending slavery didn't exist"", even though the film (like Harris' original collection of stories) is set after the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Still, as folklorist Patricia A. Turner writes:Disney's 20th century re-creation of Harris's frame story is much more heinous than the original. The days on the plantation located in ""the United States of Georgia"" begin and end with unsupervised Blacks singing songs about their wonderful home as they march to and from the fields. Disney and company made no attempt to render the music in the style of the spirituals and work songs that would have been sung during this era. They provided no indication regarding the status of the Blacks on the plantation. Joel Chandler Harris set his stories in the post-slavery era, but Disney's version seems to take place during a surreal time when Blacks lived on slave quarters on a plantation, worked diligently for no visible reward and considered Atlanta a viable place for an old Black man to set out for.Kind old Uncle Remus caters to the needs of the young white boy whose father has inexplicably left him and his mother at the plantation. An obviously ill-kept Black child of the same age named Toby is assigned to look after the white boy, Johnny. Although Toby makes one reference to his ""ma,"" his parents are nowhere to be seen. The African-American adults in the film pay attention to him only when he neglects his responsibilities as Johnny's playmate-keeper. He is up before Johnny in the morning in order to bring his white charge water to wash with and keep him entertained.The boys befriend a little blonde girl, Ginny, whose family clearly represents the neighborhood's white trash. Although Johnny coaxes his mother into inviting Ginny to his fancy birthday party at the big house, Toby is curiously absent from the party scenes. Toby is good enough to catch frogs with, but not good enough to have birthday cake with. When Toby and Johnny are with Uncle Remus, the gray-haired Black man directs most of his attention to the white child. Thus Blacks on the plantation are seen as willingly subservient to the whites to the extent that they overlook the needs of their own children.When Johnny's mother threatens to keep her son away from the old gentleman's cabin, Uncle Remus is so hurt that he starts to run away. In the world that Disney made, the Blacks sublimate their own lives in order to be better servants to the white family. If Disney had truly understood the message of the tales he animated so delightfully, he would have realized the extent of distortion of the frame story.The NAACP acknowledged ""the remarkable artistic merit"" of the film when it was first released, but decried ""the impression it gives of an idyllic master-slave relationship"". Disney re-released the film in 1956, but then kept it out of circulation all throughout the turbulent civil rights era of the 1960s. In 1970 Disney announced in Variety that Song of the South had been ""permanently"" retired, but the studio eventually changed its mind and re-released the film in 1972, 1981, and again in 1986 for a fortieth anniversary celebration. Although the film has only been released to the home video market in various European and Asian countries, Disney's reluctance to market it in the USA is not a reaction to an alleged threat by the NAACP to boycott Disney products. The NAACP fielded objections to Song of the South when it premiered, but it has no current position on the movie.Perhaps lost in all the controversy over the film is the fact that James Baskett, a Black man, was the very first live actor ever hired by Disney. Allegedly, though, Baskett was unable to attend the film's premiere in Atlanta because no hotel would give him a room.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Argument For Releasing: Song of the SouthIn their overzealous attempt to be PC, Disney has created a thriving ""underground/black market"" for this movie. It has been released in Europe in PAL VHS format, in Japan on laser disc, and most recently overseas on DVD. At legitimate auction sites people are paying into the hundreds of $$ for the DVD. How ridiculous! All necessitated by a company who is wrapped up in a PC bravado that is belied by the release of the motion picture everywhere but the US. So I say screw Disney- I guess we can't handle Gone with the Wind either? Or any other movies with blacks?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~What is Disney trying to hide? That there was slavery in this country? That there was and is inequality? That they made a movie in 1946 that might be deemed offensive in 2004? By not releasing the movie, do they hope to ignore or perhaps rewrite history? This from a company with an ""out-of-the-closet"" agenda that is barely disguised. Apparently it is more PC to promote that agenda to our children than to let history stand for what it is, and open doors of dialog about racial equality and pluralism.Based on Disney's current stance about Song of the South, we have to ask the question what would happen to ""Roots"" if Disney owned the rights to it? How about ""The Holocaust?"" Maybe by never releasing that movie on DVD, we could erase the entire history of WWII, or make Jewish people forget what their ancestors went through.Then there's the question of why release the movie at all? If it's that offensive, then why be hypocritical about it? That part is obvious - because they can make money on it.Well, I'm offended Disney! I'm offended that my 4th grade son came asking me to buy it for him today, and I had to explain to him that Disney won't release it for him to see the way I saw it twice as a kid. I'm offended that because I want to own it, I'm going to have to go to the ""black market"" or pay big $$ at auction for the DVD. I'm offended that I'm not as ""worthy"" as the people who live in Europe. I'm offended at censorship.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Once again, Disney proves that it's leadership suffers from a severe lack of vision. Poor Walt! This was purportedly one of his favorites. He's probably been rolling over in his grave for years at the directions his namesake company has taken since his death. I can imagine if he were alive and releasing this movie, he'd come on personally and tell the history of the movie and it's value to the modern audience. Hey Disney Company, why don't you go back to your roots and ask yourself, ""What would Walt do?""~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and I have always loved it. I am now a mother of two and when I started buying Disney movies for my children the first one that I sought out was The Song of the South, but of course I could not find it. I am so tired of all of this politically correct garbage. I thought that we lived in America and that we did not censor things. There are a lot of movies out there today that I find offensive and will not purchase but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be available to other people. The whole ban on the movie is absurd. I live in Florida and my children and I have been to Disney World numerous times, they have a very popular ride called Splash Mountain that they put in only a few years ago and the whole theme of the ride is The Song of the South which is meaningless to anyone under under 25-30 because they have never seen the movie, it makes no sense at all. Why is it that some people always find something negative and never see the positive. If anything this film was way ahead of its time showing the colorblindness of a well to do, young white boy and how someone's color (Uncle Remus) or social status (Ginny) is not what a person should be judged by. As Martin Luther King said ""Judge me not by the color of my skin but by the content of my character."" I believe that is what this whole movie is about, the wonderful relationship between a little boy from a broken home and a wise old man who has survived the bondages of slavery and can still find joy and beauty in the world and shares his wisdom with that troubled little boy. If there was ever a time to release this movie, now is that time.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I saw this film recently for the first time. The setting is a plantation in the south AFTER the Civil War. We know this not only because the Uncle Remus books were set after the Civil War, but because the African Americans in the movie are free. Uncle Remus decides to move to Atlanta, and just packs his things one day, and boards a carriage travelling down the main road.The film is not disrespectful of African Americans, but rather celebrates some of their contributions to popular culture. The lead performance by James Baskett is wonderfully nuanced and joyful. Of course, I loved his performance singing Zip-a-dee-doo-dah with the birds and bees, and I had been able to see this once before. But since I could never see the rest of the film, I couldn't appreciate how fantastic his performance was throughout the film. It's a shame that such great performances and depictions of African Americans - including Uncle Remus' delightfully comic animated friends - should be hidden from view.Of course, there are stereotypes of country people - both black AND white - dialects and costumes and behavior reflect how we think those living in rural areas in the late 19th Century would speak, dress, and act. But the main characters transcend these stereotypes, and that's what this film is really all about. All of the children - rich boy Johnny, poor Ginny (white) and Toby (black) - prefer each others company, and that of Uncle Remus. Johnny defies his class conscious mother, who herself learns a thing or two by the end of the film.And about Uncle Remus' stories - Brier Rabbit should be as well known and loved a Disney character as any. But so many children will never know him, as long as Disney continues to make this video unavailable. And about the incredibly foolish ""moratorium"" policy Disney has established for its other classic animated videos - I can't help but think Walt Disney would be very, very unhappy with the way Disney is being run today. These videos should be freely available so everyone can enjoy them - we need them now more than ever.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I saw this movie back in the 70's and it helped me through some difficult situations. Uncle Remus' stories and advice were very helpful when dealing with the bullies at school. Disney claims that the movie is Politically Incorrect, once again Eisner has shown how out of the mainstream he is in his non-family views of life. How can a movie, that has only been held up by Disney, be Politically Incorrect, but an entire ride at the Disney Theme Parks based solely on the Movie is good fun. By the way, not only has Eisner been the controlling force to keep the movie from being released in the US, but the gentleman who played Remus and his children have been tied up in courts for years trying to get the movie released. This brings up an interesting question. Is the movie Politically Incorrect, or is this a case of a rich white CEO not wanting to pay movie royalties to a very talented black actor and his surviving family.The reason people want to discuss the banning of SONG OF THE SOUTH isn't only because it is a Disney classic. In America, we are constantly trying to right the wrongs in this country. A few executives at Disney decide to prevent audiences from watching a popular 1946 family classic because 'they' find it offensive. This isn't unlike a publisher who has little affection for controversial authors like Mark Twain ('Huckleberry Finn), James Joyce ('Ulysses') and Henry Miller ('The Tropic of Cancer'), and thereby decides not to print these authors simply because he has ownership of their materials, and he can. But it doesn't mean he is right. Luckily these authors are not being banned today, but there is still this case surrounding SONG OF THE SOUTH.The United States is made up of various religious beliefs and cultures. We are a great country because we are free to express ourselves. The makers of SONG OF THE SOUTH made this film way back in 1946 for a company run by a man who himself preferred not to offend audiences, even at risk of alienating them by not showing them reality. Instead of portraying the post-Civil War days the way it really was, his idea was to entertain people. Walt Disney was a master showman. In SOTS, he throws out much of the pain and suffering. His view on life, at least within his empire, was pure and simple (Disney-fied). SOTS sugar-coats that day in history after the Civil War. But does this mean the movie should be banned? Some of today's critics watch SOTS and are deeply offended. But why should they be? SOTS is not trying to be a history lesson, just as GONE WITH THE WIND doesn't pretend to be. Where are GWTW's critics?Americans should be allowed to make up their own minds as to the controversy of this film. The Disney Company has a right to disown SONG OF THE SOUTH if they want, but that doesn't mean their choice is right.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As a person of color I have seen plenty of racism on television to last a lifetime. I know racism when I see it, believe me, but Song of the South is not it. It is a tribute to our proud African-American heritage and should be seen. Uncle Remus is clearly admired in this movie more than any other character. The animation and music ranks among the best work ever done by Disney and the black folklore is included. Considering that the REALLY harmful Birth of a Nation is widely available and hailed as a masterpiece, adds injury to insult regarding the absence of this classic that is a proud illustration of the African-American heritage.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~O.K., enough already. Several comments regarding this movie (most, but not all from those who argue it should be censored, ergo not released again by Disney in any form) contain erroneous so-called ""facts"" about the movie. Here is the truth:There are NO slave characters in the film. Several comments about this movie go on and on about it containing ""slaves."" Wrong, wrong, WRONG. The movie is set AFTER the civil war. That is fact. The African Americans at Miss Doshy's plantation are working employees, NOT slaves. Yes, the film is set during the Jim Crow era, and yes, one can obviously argue that the quality of life (in terms of housing and education in particular) of the African Americans shown was not much better than that of pre Civil War slaves. But to identify the the African Americans in Song of the South as ""slaves"" (and to therefore imply they are chained, whipped and ordered around by nasty white ""owners"" is absolutely ridiculous. Are there one or two situations in the film where an African American shows a certain level of ""servitude"" to a ""white manager""? Yes, but to define that as ""slavery"" is simplistic, erroneous spin.The words ""massa"" is never used by anyone, much less Uncle Remus. I've seen several discussions about Song of the South containing comments to that effect, which state or imply African Americans in the film refer to the whites as ""massa."" That is completely false. That term is NEVER heard anywhere in the entire 93 minute film.Uncle Tom is NOT ""ignorant."" He is defined or implied to be that way in several comments. Why, I don't know, but how anyone can sit through this wonderful film and be completely ignorant of the intelligence, compassion and common sense shown by the Uncle Remus character (at a level frankly higher than that of any white character in the film) is completely beyond me.As for the general PC argument that the movie ""sugar-coats"" a ""sad period"" in African America History, what's next? Is the PC crowd going to also demand a ban on ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Showboat"" (two films that also contain ""Old South style"" black characters) that are currently readily available for viewing? Thankfully, I don't yet see any ""it isn't PC, ban it"" comments on the Amazon reviews of those films, which leaves me wondering: why does the PC crowd -- which seemingly views the former movies as benign and acceptable -- find so ""frightening"" about Song of the South? I sense that seeming hypocrisy has something to do with a fear of Disney's appeal to children, but heaven only knows.Bottom line: the minority that attacks Song of the South (and is trying to bully Disney into burying it forever)is running with a political agenda that depends upon on your buying spin and erroneous ""fact."" Don't fall for that - it's a classic film that overall provides a positive message to any honest viewer with an open mind.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The many reviewers who have said ""history is history, get over it"" and have accused opponents of being too PC and oversensitive, have misunderstood Disney's reasons for not releasing this movie. Disney didn't decide to withhold this movie because the ""history"" in it might offend people. They are withholding it because it distorts history. Sure, it's set right after slavery has been abolished, but its portrayal of a peaceful life on the Southern plantation of blacks who decided to stay is unrealistic and gives the idea that slavery must not have been so bad--look how happy they were afterwords and how they just loved staying and serving those nice white folks and their open minded children. Unfortunately that is not how it was for the great majority of former slaves still living in the South after the Civil War. The distortion is what is offensive, not the ""history.""The animated sequences are great, but the live action is something Disney can't responsibly uphold. I don't want to give my children a sugar-coated version of grim parts of our nation and race's not-so-distant past. To do so would be an injustice to all who have suffered because of slavery. My hope is that Disney will release the animated sections with some new live action scenes of Uncle Remus the way he was portrayed in the books, and in a neutral setting rather than a historical one.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Anyone who isn't embarrassed by the sight of the happy Darkies singin' down on the Plantation needs to examine his heart. (Anyone offended by the male pronoun?) This film is an artifact of a time when the United States was an apartheid country. The glory is that most Americans have moved far beyond that time and those beliefs. It certainly would have been interesting (and could be for a future version) to see slavery depicted in a truer light, and to have the stories put into their historical context, but the film probably wouldn't have found an audience.To me, this film is a paradox. It's wrong, but it has HEART. I still get teary at the ending. I love the animation. I love the songs. I love the stories. I love Uncle Remus. I love the happy Darkies singing their songs. The fundamental humanity of the characters transcends the stereotypical representation of their status. Indeed, the image of a black man with wisdom, warmth and heart presents a more positive image than what we get from a lot of more contemporary, and presumably ""correct"" films.Like ""Birth of a Nation"" and so many others, ""Song of the South"" is a flawed masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece and deserves to be seen, cherished and reflected upon. I am thankful to Walt Disney for giving us his version of Uncle Remus, and more thankful to American society for giving us Martin Luther King and Malcolm X to open a path where we can walk arm-in-arm with Uncle Remus and thank him as an equal for the joy he shared with us and to apologize for the pain our society caused to him.Bobby DriscollBorn: May 3, 1937 in Cedar Rapids, IowaDied: March, 1968 in New York, New YorkBobby Driscoll first appeared on screen in Lost Angel in 1944. Almost from the beginning, his Great Talent and screen presence was evident. He was the first child actor put under an exclusive contract to Disney, and he is known for such memorable performances as Johnny in ""Song of the South, Jim Hawkins in Disney's Treasure Island (for which he received his star on the ""Walk of Fame"", and Tommy in ""The Window"" (for which he received a special Oscar).The time came, however, when Bobby was dropped by the Disney studios. Despite his memorable performances, he found himself unable to get work. This was an eventuality that Bobby was not ready to deal with; he was unable to adjust to the loss of the fame that he had always taken for granted.Bobby moved to New York to try stage work and turned to alcohol and drugs. At one point, he was reported to have told Jackie Cooper that he just wanted to prove to the world that he really was a legitimate actor. He just wanted to be remembered. The reality, of course, is that this young man didn't need to prove anything. His talent had been demonstrated to the world many times.Even being remembered was to be denied him, however. In March, 1968, he was found dead in a tenement building in New York. No one knew who he was, and he was buried as a John Doe in a pauper's grave. This talented young man died completely alone and without friends.It was a year later, due to a chance checking of fingerprints, that it was discovered that the John Doe they had buried was actually Bobby Driscoll.FilmographyBobby's was an extreme case, but it is not the only case of its type. It must be realized that fame, especially early fame, can be psychologically addictive. The Industry needs to recognize this danger with children.I urge SAG: start preparing the kids early with the knowledge that the fame may not last forever. Establish industry programs to support these children when / if their careers end.I applaud such organizations as ""A Minor Consideration"" which stands ready at any time to assist and counsel children who have known early fame.And to those in the public: When a favorite of yours has his / her career fade, consider writing them a note telling them that you haven't forgotten. This single act may mean much more than you realize.This collection of thoughts was compiled from various sources-thanks in advance all.",5,"Consolated ""Best & the Worst Arguments"" over Song of the

James Baskette made Uncle Remus real and remains the physical fulfillment of the character.  What a wonderful, amazing, unique performance.This movie has much to offer about understanding life.  Foremost is the fact that a person's worth to society depends not on his/her wealth or social standing but on his/her character.  Uncle Remus, living a poor, humble life (like Jesus), is the enormous hero in this story.  Many of us would like to have a benevolent father like Uncle Remus, who is wise, attentive, understanding, patient, kind, and loving.  However, no human being can be that perfect; in fact, Uncle Remus's traits remind me of our Heavenly Father.  This is not a formula movie; it is riveting and unique from beginning to end.

I did not get the impression of racial discrimination as I did from the classroom reading of ""Little Black Sambo"" or other works that were popular in the 40's and 50's. This is a movie that I would like to see again. When I engage in historical research there is documentation of slaves who, like the character of Uncle Remus, mesmerized children, white and black, with memorable tales. I have no problem with depictions that are historically accurate and basically benign. We did have slaves in this country in all thirteen colonies at the time of the American Revolution. It was Massachusetts that was the first colony to institute slave laws and even after emancipating the slaves in that state continued to engage in the business of the slave trade. When it came to slavery, nobody had clean hands. Had the north been able to grow cotton, in my opinion, slavery would have continued in the north. Since slavery was not economically advantageous after the land was cleared and developed in the north, it was expedient to free the slaves in that region. Free labor in the northern factories, including child labor, was more practical economically than slave labor.Therefore, to me, it is a contived fiction to sweep the truth under the national rug. Don't deny history. An honest, charming movie depicting actual circumstances will do more to alleviate social ills than suppression.

Frankly, there is nothing  offensive in it.It's the story of a poor little rich boy - from Atlanta,  GA, who goes to the country in the company of his mother to stay with his  Grandmother for a time. While there, he befriends a old black story-teller,  Uncle Remus (a slave?) and is captivated by the man's moralistic tales of  Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox and Brer Bear.Each of Uncle Remus' stories are  well presented by short animations featuring the characters mentioned  above.The boys mother takes exception with the old man filling her son's  head 'full of nonsense' and forbids both to see each other any longer.  Defying his parent, the lad seeks out his black mentor only to find that  he's left his shack and is moving on. Crying out in loss, he chases after  Uncle Remus and cuts across a field containing a fierce bull and is  subsequently injured.The tale is truly touching as Johnny (the young  boy) lies seriously ill in bed, unable (or unwilling) to respond to either  his mother or his father (who hastened back to be at his son's side), but  comes around when Uncle Remus is brought to his bedside.This is a story  of friendship and bridging social/racial gaps, and is as relevent today as  when it was made.

Thishas also been the case, over the past 50 years, in America.As recently as the 1970's, the musician Frank Zappa - an iconoclastwho grabbed onto anything controversial yet meaningful to realpeople,  adapting it with his sarcasm, irony and humor - releasedthe song ""Uncle Remus"" referencing this work to his music audience.The entertainer James Baskett  plays Uncle Remus, already havingproven his talent, skills, hard work and professionalism on theAmos 'n' Andy radio Show (also maligned by controversy andpolitical correctness) with a heart-felt, mature and honorableperformance - unfortunately passing away 2 years later.The actress Ruth Warrick is a plantation owner's wife, with 2""beautiful, ideal and perfect children"" as perhaps only as theultra - wealthy could have. It turns out, one of those is played byBobby Driscoll, who 20 years later would shockingly die on skid rowfrom drugs, anonymously and alone.Taken together, the underlying elements apart from the business aredifficult and tragic. But those are counterpoised by the reputationof the company behind it - Walt Disney - with all the expectedoutstanding artistic elements that are later confirmed to be in thepicture.The cartoon elements are frequent, and lovely ...with a personaltouch from the artists in bringing to the forefront the innocenceof youth made possible by responsible parenting, and a reliablecommunity of people having a strong character and honesty, tingedto a certain degree with religious values, as was the case in theSouth of the USA, and the upholding of basic human principles.The songs performed over the 90 minutes, are appropriate, sung by achoir of women, in a manner that today would sound perhapsover-the-top or simplistic, and pro-family. In 2010, that visionprobably would not go pass well with  today's fragmented andindividualistic society. The numbers work well, and underline theinnocents'  vision of the world.Surprisingly, Europeans can identify with a number of elements,most of all, the agricultural aspects, such as plowing the fieldswithout a tractor, but with a bull or a horse, the field workerswalking in line, with various farm tools, such as hoe, sickle,baskets and more, in their overalls, sweaty and naturally dustyfrom tilling the fields.

The movie does a very good job of portraying what it was probably like growing up in Georgia in the slave era. Uncle Remus stands out as probably one of the best characters in the movie.

I have seen it since on Laser Disc. Unfortunately, because of reasons only Robert Iger knows (he's CEO of Disney), 'Song of the South' has not yet been released on DVD. 'Song of the South' is a wonderful tale about a former slave, Uncle Remus, who tells stories about B'rer Rabbit and B'rer Fox and B'rer Bear to neighborhood children. He tells these stories to white children and black children. The stories all have sensible themes in them - some are about running away from home, or trying to find a kind of laughing place for us to go to when we are feeling sad. Uncle Remus' stories fill us with warmth. Children of all ages (adults too) would love this 1946 film. But the reason Disney hasn't released this wonderful film is because the studio is afraid of political correctness backlash. Dreamworks released 'Prince of Egypt', about slavery in Egypt. 'Gone With the Wind' takes place on a plantation. 'Birth of the Nation' makes heroes out of the Ku Klux Klan. These and so many more movies are still being released to the public. I'm in favor of these releases, even the very racist 'Birth of a Nation.' It shows that America is still free, and Americans have a right to judge films for themselves. Disney should release 'Song of the South' if only to allow Americans to judge it for themselves. I can guarantee that there will be some protest by a small minority. This will last for, say, a few days, especially leading up to the release. After that, 'Song of the South' should be easily accepted by the public, the same as 'Snow White' and 'Pinocchio' and 'The Lion King' and so many other Disney classics have been over the years. 'Song of the South' has a wonderful story, solid acting (especially by Remus himself, James Baskett, and the young Bobby Driscoll, who would later do the voice of 'Peter Pan'), great songs, and three very funny B'rer Rabbit cartoons. If some are offended at the 'Tar Baby' reference, please don't be. There is offense in just about every film that I have seen, and it's best to weigh each film individually, as a whole. 'Song of the South' is a true treasure. For those of you who haven't seen it, you are in for a special treat. Please let Disney know that you want to see this remarkable film.

It has English and Chinese text on the front and back cover.I was excited to see an official (looking) release of this classic film on DVD. Unfortunately, this is not the one you're looking for.It is a factory pressed DVD (not a burned copy), but the quality is substandard. By seeing the picture quality and occasional video dropouts, it was clear to me that this was made from a PAL VHS tape version of the film converted to NTSC. To make matters worse, there is a blue animated logo that appears EVERY 4 minutes and 45 seconds. It starts at the top right and moves across the screen to the left and stays on the screen for 20 seconds at a time. Really? Who wants to see that every 5 minutes? Certainly not me. (Click on ""View and share related images"" for a screenshot of this.)However, if you're so inclined, there are a few good things about the disc. There are optional dubbed languages in Chinese and Mandarin as well as subtitles for those languages. There are surprisingly good English subtitles, too. They duplicate the natural ""dialect"" of all of the characters. Other than these things, the DVD is bare boned. Just the movie and no special features.I doubt that this is authorized by Disney as there is no mention of the Disney company anywhere on the cover, the disc, or in the DVD content itself. In fact, the very beginning of the opening credits are cut to avoid ""Distributed by Buena Vista"" and even ""Walt Disney Presents"".Bottom line, if you love the movie, you're better off getting an un-authorized copy of it from a place like MayanCastleDVD dot net or just doing research and downloading it from the internet.

Johnson,"[14, 14]","This is the only movie I can think of (although there are many I have enjoyed) that springs to mind immediately when I hear the word: ""heartwarming."" That it is. As a child I sat at the feet of Uncle Remus (wonderfully brought to life by James Baskett, sadly no longer with us) with Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten and got happily lost in the stories he told. I haven't seen this wonderful slice of Americana in many years, due to some unfortunate misperceptions about political correctness and views of raacism, which, BTW; it has none. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; the same is true of racism. In Orwell's world there existed the thought police and any events, albeit even historical ones, which were not viewed as good for the state, were removed from the national consciousness; we must not let this happen to SOTS. Children love this story and the great, finely drawn characters and the unparallelled storytelling of Joel Chandler Harris. When combined with the classic Disney animation of the time, it is truly a unique work and one which should be available to all generations, especially those coming up now. It is a magical tale, filled with great characters, and taken from old folk tales of the Old South, now long gone, but brought back to life in this masterpiece. There was never any racist thought, reference or word which would disallow this work from being readily available; all is misperception by those who see wolves behind every tree and would erase this historical and wonderful tale of times long past in favor of the demands of political correctness. When we stand by and allow others to make decisions for us, we are always the loser, and hopefully, public demand wil bring this Disney classic back to the public, where it belongs.

Obviously, there is an amazing demand for this title as evidenced by the sheer number of people who have taken the time to ask for it on this site alone. But more telling it the large number of -- let's be polite and call them third-party -- versions available at hundreds of hobby stores, comic shops, flea markets, science fiction conventions and auction web sites nationwide. Over the years, I, myself, have purchased a VHS copy and two DVDs (with extra features) of this wonderful movie, and the quality has been pretty darn good. Unfortunately, not one dime of what I spent went into the Disney coffers.Now I know Disney definitely frowns upon these unauthorized versions of its movie, but its refusal to release Song of the South itself, despite the requests and demands of thousands and thousands of people, only encourages their proliferation. So it begs the question: Why does Disney continue to turn its back on all of the money it would make by releasing this movie itself? Why allow others to profit on its property? Sorry, Disney, but despite your best efforts to stamp out these unauthorized versions, they're going to continue as long as you refuse to release the movie that so many people love and want to own.Like most people, I have no particular interest in buying unauthorized copies of movies -- in fact, Song of the South is the only one I own. I would much rather purchase a quality version from Disney and give my money to those who deserve it.

500681,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,B00000FZC6,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[10, 10]",". . . . . IT WILL BE WHEN THE DISNEY COMPANY GETS ITS HEAD OUT OF THE INKWELL AND RELEASES 'SONG OF THE SOUTH.'  That day may be a long way off, however, because the shrieking unthinking have muted this 'SONG!'  And here in purified, sanitized, syntheiszed, homogenized and anesthetized contemporary America, we must be protected from anything that might accidentally induce genuine contemplation and intelligent discussion.  Heaven forbid this country should start thinking for Itself!SONG OF THE SOUTH is important for a couple of reasons : It was the first time live action was mixed with animation throughout an entire full-length motion picture.  It also represented a high-water mark of artistic achievement in the context of storytelling and moralizing.  SONG OF THE SOUTH is probably nothing less than the finest example of American folk art!  But America - land of the free and home of the brave - isn't allowed to see it!I was very fortunate to find a copy of SONG OF THE SOUTH (in English with Japanese subtitles) over a decade ago, and have been watching it regularly since; it remains one of my Top 25 favorite films.  I wish there was some way I could make a copy for everyone who desires one; I'd do it.The overall story is a little too sketchy, but JAMES BASKETT (Uncle Remus & the voice of Br'er Fox) gives one of the most engaging performances in motion picture history.  His character is the true hero of the story.  Only he and Miss Doshy (Lucile Watson) have a clue.So, where's the controversy?  Well, 'SONG' takes place on a Southern plantation where the Blacks are slaves.  The slavery aspect (a stain on our country's history) is scarcely evident. (Uncle Remus seems entirely free to leave the plantation when he becomes despondent!)  The relationship between the races more resembles a plantation owner / sharecropper dynamic.  There are no chains or whips; the Whites and Blacks coexist in an environment of relative affability; and the mostly absent John Sr., a newspaper editor, has been publishing controversial material (hinting at abolitionist journalism?).  Perhaps some feel that this whitewashes the slavery issue. Well, it does, but we all know that!  And of course the Black characters speak in a slightly butchered Southern dialect.  That's historically accurate, afterall, they were unjustly denied an education.  But the language is FAR more tame than I have encountered in other old movies featuring Black characters, and in fact, no more outside of mainstream English than current ebonics.  And that's the extent of SONG's controversy!  OOOoooh!  OOOoooh!It's the same small group of maroons who would protest SONG's release that have tried for years to get Twain's HUCKLEBERRY FINN banned, never realizing that Chapter XVI of that book (in which the Divine spark in Finn's heart wrestles with the callousness of his society-indoctrinated conscience and wins) constitutes the single greatest anti-slavery statement ever recorded in a novel!  SONG's humanity easily outweighs any of the marginal stereotyping it commits in conveying its time period.[Interestingly, Joel Chandler Harris (creator of the Uncle Remus stories) once wrote to Mark Twain and said of HUCKLEBERRY FINN, ""It is the most original contribution that has yet been made to American literature.""  Later, he publicly wrote, ""There is not in our fictive literature a more wholesome book than 'Huckleberry Finn.'  It is history, it is romance, it is life.  Here...we see people growing and living; we laugh at their humor, share their griefs; and...we are taught the lesson of honesty, justice and mercy.""]The handcrafted animation (no computer graphics or live action tracing) is WONDERFUL!  There is one sequence in which Uncle Remus, fishing with Br'er Frog, casts his animated line directly at the viewer; it disappears above the screen, and moments later the cork splashes into the stream and bobs in the viewer's face while the rest of the line softly descends into view, landing in the water.  It's the most imaginative 12 seconds of animation ever put on film.If the Disney Company realized how much money it would get by making SONG OF THE SOUTH available, it would accede to our wishes because MONEY is now what drives Disney.  We must continue to dog Disney until it STOPS TREATING US LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN and releases SONG OF THE SOUTH.WE WANT OUR CARTOONS!CARTOONS NOW!  CARTOONS NOW!  CARTOONS NOW!

However with the Frog Princess in the offing as  Disney's first  animated feature with African-American as lead characters. Over the past two decades Disney has moved beyond the simple white princess. With Mulan,Lilo and  Stitch,and Aladdin to name a few. Disney has done much to rebuild its image as a family entertainer but also  for all families of all colors. So Its very doubtful they would want this film re-released for public consumption. To show how Walt Disney depicted Blacks during this period would only hurt today's fans and serve no true purpose. We all know Walt Disney was a racist. But as Warner Bros has decided not to show Bugs Bunny in black face anymore. So should Disney ban this film. After all the work Disney Studios has put in making a better image for themselves and how Blacks are depicted in film  I very much doubt we will be seeing tar baby and his ilk an time soon if ever. America has a less than honorable past and while I'm against revisionist history where we don't talk about such things.

Mr. Harris based these tales from the Uncle Remus that he knew. His Uncle Remus told these tales based upon oral African tradition.

Well, Uncle Remus still looks like a happy slave and that's racist. Well, what do you expect in this movie, a Nat Turner? Yes, slavery is wrong. Hey, every tribe of man engaged in it one time or the other. We are created equal in that sense. The Mark Ferman isn't used in this movie, the servants aren't whip. This movie isn't a doucmentary of slavery. It tells the loving story of a relationship between a boy and servant. The servant becomes a father figure (does that sound like Mark Twain's Jim and Huck?). In one moving scene, the boy holds hands for Uncle Remus and become his eyes. Listen, slavery is wrong, but all slaveholders and their slaves are dead. They are in hands of a just God. Justice will be served. To deny this movie to a fellow human is morally wrong. Judge not lest thou shalt be judged. The actor who protrayed Uncle Remus received a special oscar for his work, but he wasn't at the show in Atlanta. No hotels would admit him.
