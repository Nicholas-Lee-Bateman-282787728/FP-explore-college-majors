I really enjoyed this movie because the main characters learned some very valuable lessons by the end of the film.

The relationships she had with her Dad and her Mom were very realistic, and her best friend, her dance instructor, her soccer coach, and the new boy in her life, all added to her seeing that there is a lot to life, other than just sports, and you can enjoy ALL the different parts if you just take the time.",4,Her best move,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",2012,639,"['initially', 'watched', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'was', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'learned', 'very', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'end', 'film', 'learned', 'soccer', 'was', ""n't"", 'everything', 'needed', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'life', 'including', 'soccer', 'relationships', 'had', 'Dad', 'Mom', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'best', 'friend', 'dance', 'instructor', 'soccer', 'coach', 'new', 'boy', 'life', 'added', 'seeing', 'lot', 'life', 'other', 'just', 'sports', 'can', 'enjoy', 'different', 'parts', 'just', 'take', 'time']",Her Best Move

I thinkHer Best Movelargely succeeds on that front. It has the usual ups and downs, family turmoils, the boyfriend miscommunication, etc. - all resolved happily of course. However, there's something about it that just seems small-bore and predictable. For example, a girl spreads a rumor that the star of the movie, Sara, said her boyfriend kisses like a ""dead squid."" And he believed her. Really? Maybe it's been a while since I was in high school, but that just seems juvenile and unbelievable (the rumors in our high school were much worse, and students tended to be a bit more cynical). This might make the movie a bit boring for parents watching with their kids. It certainly isn't as entertaining asBend It Like Beckham (Widescreen Edition), another girls' soccer movie. I'd maybe recommendHer Best Movefor younger (grade school) girls, and thenBend It Like Beckham (Widescreen Edition)for somewhat wider audiences.",3,"Not the most exciting film, but good for families",1267920000,"03 7, 2010",2010,1039,"['imagine', 'most', 'people', 'watchingHer', 'Best', 'Movewill', 'do', 'so', 'want', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'kids', 'who', 'soccer', 'thinkHer', 'Best', 'Movelargely', 'front', 'usual', 'ups', 'downs', 'family', 'turmoils', 'boyfriend', 'miscommunication', 'etc', 'resolved', 'happily', 'course', 'However', 'something', 'just', 'small-bore', 'predictable', 'example', 'girl', 'rumor', 'star', 'movie', 'Sara', 'said', 'boyfriend', 'dead', 'squid', 'believed', 'Really', 'Maybe', 'been', 'while', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'just', 'juvenile', 'unbelievable', 'rumors', 'high', 'school', 'were', 'much', 'worse', 'students', 'tended', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'cynical', 'might', 'make', 'movie', 'bit', 'boring', 'parents', 'watching', 'kids', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'asBend', 'Beckham', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'girls', 'soccer', 'movie', ""'d"", 'maybe', 'recommendHer', 'Best', 'Movefor', 'younger', 'grade', 'school', 'girls', 'thenBend', 'Beckham', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'somewhat', 'wider', 'audiences']",Her Best Move

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Most times I tend to stay away from the Disney Channel and all its saccharine goodness, and at the best of times I'm only a casual fan of soccer. But family obligations had me parked in the living room one evening and checking out this movie, and it wasn't really so horrible a time. HER BEST MOVE doesn't flash the sublime cinematic creds ofBend It Like Beckham (Widescreen Edition)or the Amanda Bynes-powered appeal ofShe's the Man (Widescreen Edition), but it's still a positive and very watchable dramedy and ideally suited for family viewing, especially if you have little girls and if they're into soccer.15-year-old Sara Davis may be a soccer phenom (and a bit of a ballhog) but, in many ways, she's your typical teenaged girl, trying not to get mown down by pressures of school and social peers and all that stuff we all went thru when we were that insecure age. Sara carries the added baggage of a taskmaster of a dad who relentlessly pushes her in her sport. But Sara genuinely loves soccer and has a long shot at making the National Development Team, and so she falls in line, sacrificing her time at being just a normal girl and hanging out with her best friend, missing out on her dance classes and on a possible romance with that reclusive but cute teen photographer. The predictable fallout is that Sara is gradually succumbing to stress, what with her being bombarded from all sides, expected to meet all sorts of obligations. Sadly, not even her supportive mom's sneaking dollops of ice cream into those yucky nutritional blended drinks is enough of an upside.HER BEST MOVE doesn't try to pull a fast one on you. It's a solid picture, straightforward and familiar thru and thru, from Sara's character arc to the ultra-competitive on-field rival to that all-important big final game. Also familiar are those themes of self-discovery, personal choice, and parents exerting too much pressure on their kids to excel in youth sports, to the detriment of these kids' enjoyment in simply being kids. And, frankly, the soccer matches won't dazzle anyone. It all comes down to the cast's performances, and, at the movie's core, is Leah Pipes's performance. Leah Pipes isn't a Barbie playing at soccer. There's a realness to her and an honesty in how she demonstrates her character's self-consciousness and anxieties and in her tentative steps toward romance. She grounds this movie. To quote from her interview with the popculturemadness website: ""I was so thrilled to get the part of Sara because I was able to combine my two passions: acting and soccer."" And sure enough, Leah is pretty convincing as a soccer player. It helps, too, that, even with its crop of clich&eacute;s the film doesn't get too preachy or silly and that the screenplay doesn't resort too much to overwrought and contrived high school schtick. In summing up, there's enough here that's thought-provoking and substantial and engaging to separate HER BEST MOVE from the pack of run-of-the-mill teen flicks endlessly parading thru the Disney Channel.",4,Bend it like Leah Pipes,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,3029,"['Most', 'times', 'tend', 'stay', 'away', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'saccharine', 'goodness', 'best', 'times', ""'m"", 'only', 'casual', 'fan', 'soccer', 'family', 'obligations', 'had', 'parked', 'living', 'room', 'one', 'evening', 'checking', 'out', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'so', 'horrible', 'time', 'BEST', 'MOVE', ""n't"", 'flash', 'sublime', 'cinematic', 'creds', 'ofBend', 'Beckham', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Amanda', 'Bynes-powered', 'appeal', 'ofShe', 'Man', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'still', 'positive', 'very', 'watchable', 'dramedy', 'ideally', 'suited', 'family', 'viewing', 'especially', 'have', 'little', 'girls', ""'re"", 'soccer.15-year-old', 'Sara', 'Davis', 'may', 'be', 'soccer', 'phenom', 'bit', 'ballhog', 'many', 'ways', 'typical', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'trying', 'not', 'get', 'mown', 'down', 'pressures', 'school', 'social', 'peers', 'stuff', 'went', 'thru', 'when', 'were', 'insecure', 'age', 'Sara', 'added', 'baggage', 'taskmaster', 'dad', 'who', 'relentlessly', 'sport', 'Sara', 'genuinely', 'soccer', 'long', 'shot', 'making', 'National', 'Development', 'Team', 'so', 'line', 'sacrificing', 'time', 'being', 'just', 'normal', 'girl', 'hanging', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'missing', 'out', 'dance', 'classes', 'possible', 'romance', 'reclusive', 'cute', 'teen', 'photographer', 'predictable', 'fallout', 'Sara', 'gradually', 'succumbing', 'stress', 'what', 'being', 'bombarded', 'sides', 'expected', 'meet', 'sorts', 'obligations', 'Sadly', 'not', 'even', 'supportive', 'mom', 'sneaking', 'dollops', 'ice', 'cream', 'yucky', 'nutritional', 'blended', 'drinks', 'enough', 'upside.HER', 'BEST', 'MOVE', ""n't"", 'try', 'pull', 'fast', 'one', 'solid', 'picture', 'straightforward', 'familiar', 'thru', 'thru', 'Sara', 'character', 'arc', 'ultra-competitive', 'on-field', 'rival', 'all-important', 'big', 'final', 'game', 'Also', 'familiar', 'are', 'themes', 'self-discovery', 'personal', 'choice', 'parents', 'exerting', 'too', 'much', 'pressure', 'kids', 'excel', 'youth', 'sports', 'detriment', 'kids', 'enjoyment', 'simply', 'being', 'kids', 'frankly', 'soccer', 'matches', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dazzle', 'anyone', 'down', 'cast', 'performances', 'movie', 'core', 'Leah', 'Pipes', 'performance', 'Leah', 'Pipes', ""n't"", 'Barbie', 'playing', 'soccer', 'realness', 'honesty', 'how', 'character', 'self-consciousness', 'anxieties', 'tentative', 'steps', 'romance', 'movie', 'quote', 'interview', 'popculturemadness', 'website', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'get', 'part', 'Sara', 'was', 'able', 'combine', 'two', 'passions', 'acting', 'soccer', 'sure', 'enough', 'Leah', 'pretty', 'convincing', 'soccer', 'player', 'too', 'even', 'crop', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'preachy', 'silly', 'screenplay', ""n't"", 'resort', 'too', 'much', 'overwrought', 'contrived', 'high', 'school', 'schtick', 'summing', 'up', 'enough', 'here', 'thought-provoking', 'substantial', 'engaging', 'separate', 'HER', 'BEST', 'MOVE', 'pack', 'run-of-the-mill', 'teen', 'flicks', 'endlessly', 'parading', 'Disney', 'Channel']",Her Best Move
