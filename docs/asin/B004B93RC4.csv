Louis CK is an extremely funny dude, but I felt this material was a bit raw. It's like he had the outline for a good show, solid topics and all, but then just went on stage and was winging it. The setups were there, but when it came time for the punchline, it just didn't pop. An example from the beginning of the show was the Hitler vs Ray Charles comparison. That had SO much potential, and it was kind of funny, but he could have done more with it. Some jokes had my dying, but most of the special seemed to drag. An hour and 24 mins is a LONG special too, so that could be part of the problem. That's a ton of time to fill. I'd much rather a comedian do a shorter set and have me rolling the whole time, than give me an hour plus of OK material.If you already like Louis CK, its worth checkin out, but don't expect to be blown away.

It is impossible not to like it but if you love his tv show, as I do, it lacks the more subtle comic stylings of his tv show.  This is much broader humor.  Also, where Louis CK is strongest to me is in his observations about human nature, his daughter, his dating, his friends and so forth.  He is less funny to me when he gets going about the more obvious raunch that is familiar to stand up audiences.  I actually like him better than George Carlin though, who was the undisputed king of what Louis CK does in his standup act. So if you are looking for a replacement for the late Carlin, you've found him.This show is called hilarious because he really resents how the word hilarious has now become apt to describe just about any situation in life.

I finally came out at the other end of the long, dark tunnel that is ""Shantaram"" (993 pages), then I dove into ""Patanjali's Yoga Sutras"" for extra torture (much shorter, but dense).  After putting myself through all that brain drain, noticing a comedian was available on Amazon Prime,  I jumped at him.Another thing I don't watch is cable TV.  I get the basic channels and that's more than enough.  So I knew nothing about this guy Louis C.K. (for Czekely, his Hungarian surname, although he bills himself as Mexican-American).  Apparently he's quite trendy, he has his own sitcom that was reviewed this week in ""The New Yorker"", he appears on all the right late-night shows, and he does a lot of these stand-up videos.C.K. has been compared to George Carlin, but after listening to him, I've gotta say, no way.  I'm old enough to remember Carlin's very first TV monologues.  He was always witty, topical, a student of word meanings, a gentle critic of society--a thinking, almost philosophical comic.  Granted, C.K. has carlinesque moments--like when he riffs on the over-the-top use of superlatives in everyday conversation, or when he talks about the word ""Jew"" meaning two different things depending on the context--but all the blue stuff, the scatology and pornography that appeals to 20-year-old males, is not.  Having said that, I'm sure Carlin had his own version of off-color humor that he took on the road, but what I saw was a ""clean"" comedian who detected irony and hypocrisy everywhere and reported back on it to the rest of us.So I don't know what to say about C.K.  He had me laughing, but he also had me gagging (the poop stuff got old fast, as did the gonado-centric humor).  And he wasn't consistent.  Near the beginning he said something like, life is crap and then you die and how he hates optimists, but later he talked about spoiled Americans complaining about insignificant problems like their cell phones not working right 100% of the time while people in other less developed countries have real problems to worry about.  He's from a different generation than mine, and that probably has something to do with not being totally enthralled with him.  So I'll give him three stars plus an extra star for his Hungarian DNA.",4,"Carlin he isn't, but C.K. has his moments",1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,2352,"['do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'watch', 'stand-up', 'anymore', 'needed', 'break', 'heavy', 'reading', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'other', 'end', 'long', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'Shantaram', '993', 'pages', 'then', 'dove', 'Patanjali', 'Yoga', 'Sutras', 'extra', 'torture', 'much', 'shorter', 'dense', 'putting', 'brain', 'drain', 'noticing', 'comedian', 'was', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'jumped', 'him.Another', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'cable', 'TV', 'get', 'basic', 'channels', 'more', 'enough', 'knew', 'nothing', 'guy', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'Czekely', 'Hungarian', 'surname', 'bills', 'Mexican-American', 'Apparently', 'quite', 'trendy', 'own', 'sitcom', 'was', 'reviewed', 'week', 'New', 'Yorker', 'right', 'late-night', 'shows', 'lot', 'stand-up', 'videos.C.K', 'been', 'compared', 'George', 'Carlin', 'listening', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'way', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'Carlin', 'very', 'first', 'TV', 'monologues', 'was', 'always', 'witty', 'topical', 'student', 'word', 'meanings', 'gentle', 'critic', 'society', 'thinking', 'almost', 'philosophical', 'comic', 'Granted', 'C.K', 'carlinesque', 'moments', 'when', 'over-the-top', 'use', 'superlatives', 'everyday', 'conversation', 'when', 'word', 'Jew', 'meaning', 'two', 'different', 'things', 'depending', 'context', 'blue', 'stuff', 'scatology', 'pornography', 'appeals', '20-year-old', 'males', 'not', 'Having', 'said', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Carlin', 'had', 'own', 'version', 'off-color', 'humor', 'took', 'road', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'clean', 'comedian', 'who', 'detected', 'irony', 'hypocrisy', 'everywhere', 'reported', 'back', 'rest', 'us.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', 'C.K', 'had', 'laughing', 'also', 'had', 'gagging', 'poop', 'stuff', 'got', 'old', 'fast', 'did', 'gonado-centric', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'beginning', 'said', 'something', 'life', 'crap', 'then', 'die', 'how', 'optimists', 'later', 'talked', 'spoiled', 'Americans', 'complaining', 'insignificant', 'problems', 'cell', 'phones', 'not', 'working', 'right', '100', '%', 'time', 'people', 'other', 'less', 'developed', 'countries', 'have', 'real', 'problems', 'worry', 'about', 'different', 'generation', 'mine', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'being', 'totally', 'enthralled', 'So', ""'ll"", 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'extra', 'star', 'Hungarian', 'DNA']",Louis C.K: Hilarious

Polite chuckles only.But I did not hear or see any unrestrained roaring gut busting laughter the whole program.
