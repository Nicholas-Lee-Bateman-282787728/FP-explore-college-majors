Anywayz...Its a show about a girl who is prophecied to bring about the world's destruction on her 16th birthday.  She is supposedly executed at birth but is secretly hidden.  It is now the eve of her 16th birthday and she has been discovered to be alive!  Now the whole country is out to kill her.  It is up to her step brother and sister to protect her but they wonder if they are really doing the right thing.This was an awesome show.  Very well thought out, with lots of crazy twists.  It is WAY more than a typical fantasy story.  Its got lots of humor and touching moments.  Lots of action and excitement.

She is referred to as the Scrapped Princess. The Scrapped Princess is said to be born under a cursed star and bring destruction to the entire world. Nearly the entire world is out to kill her. There is nowhere they can hide, so they stay on the move. Shannon is a talented swordsman, and Raquel is a strong sorceress. Pacifica has very good protectors. At first glance, Pacifica tends to seem like a spoiled brat. Sometimes she makes a complete turnaround and shows a sweet and caring attitude. It's kind of wierd how she changes like that. The 3 siblings will meet many people on their journey. Some will become friends and others will betray them. One thing is for sure; there will be lots of action and plot twists.This series is pretty good. It has a good mix of action, comedy and drama. There are some really good characters that are developed well. This series stays focused on the main plot and doesn't diverge like a lot of the fantasy animes out there. It has good animation, voice acting, and a decent soundtrack. I really enjoyed it, but there are tons of better shows out there.

It has everything an anime lover could want: Magic, cool sword fights, hilarious situations, suspense, and a little romance.  If you're bored of all the cliche anime shows then you should check out Scrapped Princess and here are the reasons why:The characters in Scrapped Princess are fantastic.  This show is filled with multi-faceted, complex characters which is very refreshing.  The plot is phenomenal.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and carries you throughout every episode making it impossible to ever feel that the show is sluggishly moving along.  The music in this show is also great.  I have to admit that I have the theme song ""Little Wing"" on my Ipod and listen to it constantly.  The background music is also great.  The animation in this show brings to life beautiful, sweeping landscapes and the special effects for the magical elements are also to die for.  I would give this anime a million stars if I could.

878555,A2LS6A1XNO8Y7,B000798A0Q,Nurse Washu,"[17, 18]","Like Magic Knight Rayearth, Scrapped Princess is a sword and sorcery adventure. Like Ayashi no Ceres, it's the story of twin heir and heiress - one charmed, and one cursed. Pacifica, the central figure, is the cursed ""Scrapped Princess"". An unflattering title, but accurate, Pacifica is the poison that will destroy the world. Supposedly killed at birth, but now fifteen years old, forces of society and law everywhere are after her to destroy her before her sixteenth birthday. She runs from them and fights against them with two protectors, Shannon and Raquel. So are things presented to us, however things are not as they seem.The basic premise of the plot isn't something new really, I've seen it used many times before, but what really makes this anime stand out is how the plot is presented. I came into the show without having seen any spoilers, and that is really how it must be done, so I'll be really careful about how much I say about it. Essentially the viewer starts off blind, just like the characters do, and the plot is slowly revealed, so the viewer experiences it the same way that they do. Scrapped Princess is one of the best written anime series that I've seen yet. Besides excellent plot and character development, it's also intelligent and thought provoking about various roles that people have in society and some functions of society itself. I read somewheres that this anime was taken from a large manga work of 12 volumes and that a good amount of material wasn't included in the anime. If this is so, I'll really have to get my hands on this manga to read all of the details for myself. I would highly recommend this series for any serious anime fan.",5,Things are not quite as they seem.,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,1678,"['Magic', 'Knight', 'Rayearth', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'sword', 'sorcery', 'adventure', 'Ayashi', 'Ceres', 'story', 'twin', 'heir', 'heiress', 'one', 'charmed', 'one', 'cursed', 'Pacifica', 'central', 'figure', 'cursed', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'unflattering', 'title', 'accurate', 'Pacifica', 'poison', 'will', 'destroy', 'world', 'Supposedly', 'killed', 'birth', 'now', 'fifteen', 'years', 'old', 'forces', 'society', 'law', 'everywhere', 'are', 'destroy', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'fights', 'two', 'protectors', 'Shannon', 'Raquel', 'are', 'things', 'presented', 'however', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'seem.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'plot', ""n't"", 'something', 'new', 'really', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'used', 'many', 'times', 'what', 'really', 'anime', 'stand', 'out', 'how', 'plot', 'presented', 'came', 'show', 'having', 'seen', 'spoilers', 'really', 'how', 'must', 'be', 'done', ""'ll"", 'be', 'really', 'careful', 'how', 'much', 'say', 'Essentially', 'viewer', 'blind', 'just', 'characters', 'do', 'plot', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'viewer', 'same', 'way', 'do', 'Scrapped', 'Princess', 'one', 'best', 'written', 'anime', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'excellent', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'also', 'intelligent', 'thought', 'provoking', 'various', 'roles', 'people', 'have', 'society', 'functions', 'society', 'read', 'somewheres', 'anime', 'was', 'taken', 'large', 'manga', 'work', '12', 'volumes', 'good', 'amount', 'material', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'anime', 'so', ""'ll"", 'really', 'have', 'get', 'hands', 'manga', 'read', 'details', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'serious', 'anime', 'fan']",N/A

That air of uncertainty helps to give this story a degree of charm that one rarely sees in animation. Pacifica Cassul is a very complex heroine, at times bratty, and others times very thoughtful. The relationship that she has with her siblings, Shannon and Raquel, is every bit as rocky as one would expect from people in such a circumstance. Each one of the characters has to deal with question of how far they'll go to protect the life of someone who may or may not cause the end of the world.This dvd introduces the characters and sets up the story. It finds our party trying to stay ahead of their pursuers, but unfortunately bringing the wrath of both the military and the church on a small town. The animation is very good, and the music is superb. If I have any complaints, it would be that the translation from Japanese to English was not quite up to par.

878559,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000798A0Q,Sesho,"[4, 4]","Pacifica Cassul just wants to be your normal fifteen year old in a Middle Ages type world, attending school and hanging out with friends. Except everybody in the world wants to kill her because she was prophesied to destroy the world on her sixteenth birthday. Well, ALMOST everyone, because she has two staunch allies, her adopted brother, Shannon, who has no equal with a sword, and her sister, Raquel, a ditzy but formidable sorceress. The trio doesn't really have a clue as to where they're going. Where can they run to? The priests of the god Mauser have sent commoners, knights, assassins, and the even more deadly Purgers to seek Pacifica out and destroy her. Even with all the forces working against them, a quixotic knight named Leopold, unaware of the identity of Pacifica, befriends them along the way, and even one of her assassins begins to question the validity of his mission.This is a good start to what looks like a terrific series. Pacifica is demanding and cranky without being annoying and Shannon reminds me a lot of Spike from Bebop and Raquel seems harmless at one point then deadly then loving all wrapped up in the same package. That's what I think Scrapped Princess is going to be about in the end. Siblings loving one another even though it might bring about the end of the world. Even though Pacifica herself wonders at times if it just might be for the best if she WERE dead. There's something very human about the fact that she feels guilty about all the trouble she's causing for the world. And there's something touching about the fact that her brother and sister will have faith in her until the last possible instant, that the prophecy might be wrong. The only thing I worry about is that the show might degenerate into a last couple of episodes of Pacifica remaking the world and fighting for her identity a la Evangelion or Rahxephon or Escaflowne. I hope the creators keep it on a understandable keel. As for now, it seems a model of simplicity. Let's hope it continues that way.

She is far more sympathetic sounding in the original Japanese voicing.The actor chosen for the English language dub is simply terrible, sounding like some caricature of a bratty, spoiled suburban American child.

878562,A3OND36Q71G76D,B000798A0Q,W. Scott Heitman,"[28, 28]","Anime, like many other forms of entertainment, is heavily riddled with cliches.  Insert huge eyes and sharply shaped figures here, goofy humor there, plot-replacing fight scenes here, and voila! you have an anime series.Scrapped Princess is one of those series that stands out from the rest.  It has charm and a simple elegance that, combined with a reasonably complex plot, beats out just about any other recent fantasy series out there.  Personally, I find every component of the series to be perfect.Story- Scrapped Princess has no filler episodes.  Every episode, while some may initially seem unimportant, is a vital piece of the story.  The show does a fantastic job of creating a whole bunch of story elements and characters during the first half of the show and then throwing them around in the carnage that is the second half.  Part of the reason why the story is so expertly told is that the series is based off of novels rather than manga.  I would give a synopsis of the plot, but others here have done that, and I personally recommend watching the show knowing as little as possible.Animation- The art style in this anime captured my attention before the story even had a chance to unfold.  The character design and use of color are quite captivating- no slouch here.  I might add that the action scenes, while usually brief until the last few eps, are very crisply animated.Characters- Another great strength for Scrapped Princess, all of the characters in Scrapped Princess are very likeable- even many of the villains.  The emotions, for once, seem very real, and at times, you almost forget you're watching animation.  There are a couple of humorous characters, but the humor is clever, kept in check, and very well executed.Score- The music in Scrapped Princess is fantastic; it's good enough that I often listen to it alone both for its beauty and to remember the anime (good soundtracks often evoke memories of their source material).  The music is largely responsible for the epic feeling the series puts forth.I don't actually buy much anime because it is so expensive, although sometimes I rent licensed stuff I haven't seen.  I will make an exception for Scrapped Princess, though.  I'm chomping at the bit to get the entire series, box and all.  While I wish animes as mature and well-written as this were the norm rather than the exception, I am grateful that such a fantastic show exists at all.
