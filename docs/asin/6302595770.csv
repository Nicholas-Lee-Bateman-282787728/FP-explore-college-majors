Parts of &quot;War Is a Science&quot; were put back in, totally missing from the tape version. The song (as well as the show) is still incomplete on this version, but it's likely the most complete issue of this ground-breaking show we'll ever see.Performance wise, you couldn't ask for more from Ben Vareen, William Katt, and Chita Rivera, all of whom give exciting performances captured here for all-time. Christopher Chadman, who plays the egotistical Lewis, brother of Pippin, went on to have a successful career as a Broadway choreographer before his untimely death. And it's great to see Martha Raye playing a role on stage since most of our memories of her are from dated 1940's movies that emphasize her brashness and not her humanity.The most disappointing aspect of this DVD was its sound quality. The &quot;surround&quot; sound as digitized through my receiver muffled the singing and emphasized the orchestra.

321929,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6302595770,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","PIPPIN was and is an unexpectedly controversial musical.  Directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Roger O. Hirson, the play opened on Broadway with much fanfare in 1972--but reviews were mixed box office was failing until the producers did a television commercial for the show.  It was the first time a Broadway show had deigned to lower itself to the level of television advertising, but the results were spectacular.  The box office was slammed and the show ran 1944 performances.  But many critics remained unimpressed and considered the show's success a matter of clever marketing, and when the show closed, it seemed to go away entirely.  There were occasional regional productions, shows by colleges and community theatres, but the show didn't have a popular score to remind people of its existence.But time has a way of telling us the truth about art.  PIPPIN has never had the same fame as, say, OKLAHOMA--but neither is it as relentlessly overworked.  We haven't heard it, seen it a thousand times, and although the music is very clearly rooted in early 1970s pop, it remains fresh and lively and feels new.  And the style is as unexpected as it ever was, a bizarre mixture of commedia dell arte, variety show, lots of flash, and ultimately an unexpected darkness that has significant jolt.  In 1981 Kathryn Doby, the dance captain of the original Broadway show, recreated PIPPIN for Canadian television.  It was one of the first serious efforts to capture the effect of live theatre before a live audience and it was unexpectedly successful.The 1981 video version is not an exact recreation of the Broadway original.  A few songs are missing, verses are cut here and there, scenes are trimmed.  It also seems to soften Fosse's original choreography and the play's dark ending is not quite so dark.  Even so, it does give a remarkable notion of how the play operates.  ""Magic to Do"" begins the show by bring on The Leading Player (Ben Vereen, who originated the role on Broadway) and his minons, a colorful collection of clowns and jugglers and dancers.  Speaking and singing directly to the audience, they set for the story of Pippin (William Katt), son of Charlemagne, a young man who seeks absolute forfillment.  He tries war; he tries treason.  There's art and there's religion.  Ultimately he meets an ""ordinary woman,"" Catherine (Leslie Denniston), but although he falls in love, he elects to throw it all away for one last shot at perfection.The play is extremely episodic, moving from one vignette to another.  We bounce from Pippin's father Charlemagne (Benjamin Rayson) to his unexpectedly free-and-easy grandmother (Martha Raye) to his evil stepmother Fastrada (Chita Rivera) as Pippin seeks the ultimate experience.  The dance numbers and songs are great and quite often unexpected and often strangely ironic.  ""Corner of the Sky"" betrays Pippin's innocence; ""War is a Science"" is a perverse take on the battlefield, very funny and very dark; ""With You"" is infamous as the love song Fosse choreographed into a sexual orgy.  The ultimate musical statement, I think, occurs with at the end of the play with ""The Finale,"" in which Pippin must literally choose between life and death, reality and illusion.  It's all remarkable stuff.Could it have been better?  Probably.  It would be nice to have the thing unedited.  But Ben Vereen is incredibly good, William Katt is right up there with him, and the supporting cast is everything you could want, with Martha Raye's turn with ""Time to Start Living"" an audience favorite.  The DVD offers an interview with Fosse himself.

To have themarvelous performance of Ben Vereen, the magnificant Chita Rivera,funny Martha Raye and a surprisingly good performance by William Katton one DVD are reasons enough to have this recording. BUT the mainreason to treasure it is that it preserves Bob Fosse's staging andchoreography which would otherwise be lost. Yes, the staging isrecreated by Kathryn Doby, but she was Fosse's assistant for theBroadway production, so short of Mr. Fosse himself, who better to doit. (No one objects to Ann Reinking recreating Fosse's choreographyfor the current smash revival of &quot;Chicago&quot;.) One definiteplus for this production is that many of the dancers were in theoriginal Broadway production so knew just what Mr. Fosse had createdfor them. I know as I checked my programs.Admittedly, there are afew cuts in the &quot;book&quot; and one song is omitted, but they allwork for the betterment of the show. If anyone remembers the originalBroadway reviews, the book was looked on as less than satisfying. Theversion now on tape seems a much better one. I am comparing it to myrememberance of the original Broadway show and the printedscript.How often are live productions with an audience available?Normally they are done in a studio and not on stage. Let's face it,Broadway shows are meant for viewing by a live audience and to havethe reactions on this DVD makes you feel more a part of theshow.Other productions with different directors will have acompletely different idea of the show, but they will fail to realizethat &quot;Pippin&quot; was shaped and basically created by Bob Fosseand any other versions just can't do justice to the work.I wouldlike to correct one comment that states that Florence Klotzwas responsible for the costumes. As good as her work is, she did notdesign &quot;Pippin&quot;, the wonderful Patricia Zipprodt did.To sum it allup, anyone who loves live musical theater should have this DVD (ortape) in their collection.

Now I am fortunate enough to have seen a video of a professional production floating around on the internet somewhere, and it was really well done. Then I saw this movie... I'll break down this version of the movie.THE GOOD: We have a version of Pippin out on DVD finally. Ben Vereen is in it and gives a very good performance, after all he IS the Leading Player, nobody else can hold a candle to him. The set is FANTASTIC, Most of the cast are really good (William Katt ESPECIALLY), and not to mention this video was shot in Canada!THE BAD: Several songs are cut down here. For example, half of Spread A Little Sunshine is cut out, therefore making it confusing to anyone who has not seen the show on stage already or have had any experience with Pippin whatsoever. The second (and most essential) verse of ""War Is A Science"" is out, ""Glory"" is extremely missed opportunity. The slow-mo battle scene is cut out! This isn't no G-rated happy-go-lucky play. And What happened to I Guess I'll Miss The Man??? Pacing problems also ensue; some fast songs are too slow, some slow songs are too fast (Simple Joys is ruined by this), and the cast seems to be rushing it at times, as if they have somewhere to be after the show. EVerybody, even the incomparable Ben Vereen is guilty of this (Glory is a sign of this). And the final line (cutting out ""But Happy"") is a total WTF moment.THE UNFORGIVABLE: THe social Commentary/political overtones of the show are missing, and elements like Pippin not being used to life are gone and replaced with happy-go-lucky family version themes. This is a show that kids shouldn't watch. And the band of players didn't really come off to me as creepy, not to mention as much as Ben Vereen is an amazing actor and singer, he seems to be a tad psycho in the last 20 minutes. I felt like I was watching a demented lunatic serial killer have a freakout. Martha Raye's performance was PATHETIC (what's with the microphone????), and the guy who plays Charlamagne YELLS a lot, which did get on my nerves after a while. At times I wondered if Fosse even saw a production of the original production. Lastly, the camerawork is not the best- the audience shots on ""No Time at All"" make me cringe. THe blame for this falls squarely at the feet of Bob Fosse, who apparently had the wrong ideas.In short, I give this 3 stars for Ben Vereen and William Katt, and the sets.

Having seen it live 4 times (both professional and dinner theater) I love the story and the script.But this video is strictly bush league. Poor video and sound quality make it look amateurish, despite the all-star cast. (Ben Vareen, William Katt, and the ensemble are great.) I swear, the video quality was so bad that my daughter walked in the room and asked if this was a home video of a local production. Editting problems between cameras make it obvious that this was filmed over several nights, or badly cut in the finishing room (cast member body positions change between shots and then return again, songs appear badly lip synced, despite the ""live"" stage setting in front of an audience, etc.) Scenes are jerky, with one jarring splice of Fastrada and Louis obviously re-recorded and cut into place just prior to ""Spread a Little Sunshine.""I was also a little disappointed with the scenes cut and songs revised from the original production. ""War Is A Science"" is greatly cut back, the role of Katherine and the beautiful scenes with her son and his duck are all but missing, and the battle scenes that play out behind the Lead Player during Glory are not present. Also missing is one of the most memorable scenes from the stage, in which Pippin questions the value of war and the meaning of life with the disembodied head of a Visigoth (the scene was set up pretty obviously with cameras focusing on the head, but was apparently not included in the final edit.)If you love Pippin and need a video to help rekindle memories of the play, this will do fine. If you are new to the show, this will leave you wondering what all the fuss was about 25+ years ago. Personally, I wish I had not spent the money.

Unfortunately, the sound was messed up on the tape, and the crew cut the tape short, but even with that, there was something missing to the production.It wasn't until I got a copy of the tape some years after that that I realized what was wrong: scenes deleted, dance numbers abridged... sure, it was Pippin, but at the same time it really wasn't. It was like this bad photocopy of a truly great original.Still, it's better than nothing. I broke down and bought the DVD because (1) the quality was better than the tape, and (2) it ain't much, but it's a record of a show I hold very, very dear.(BTW: Pippin trivia -- when Florence Klotz was on her way to show the original costume designs to Fosse, she got up too late that morning to put any colour into the chorus designs and decided to leave them white and beige washes -- she told herself en route that she would talk Fosse through the colour work and everything would be fine. So she arrives and shows them to him, and she's just getting ready to tell him what's in what colour when he goes wild over the &quot;white&quot; look.

What is important about this version is it allows the closest view of Bobby's original work that we may ever have.  Bob worked on this show while at great odds of the composer (Schwartz), to the point of having him barred from rehersals.  It is amazing the show ever made it to where it got.
