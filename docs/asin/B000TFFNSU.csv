I bought this DVD and the Happy Holiday Hearth (Highly recommend that one too!) and everyone that comes to the house loves it. The music makes me kind of sleepy but so does watching beautiful snow falling.

There are a few scenes which show nothing but bark on a log or a tree branch that I think are rather ridiculous, but then there are some lovely scenes of forest, trees, streams and where the snow if falling hard, something I didn't get on another snow video I purchased that had dazzling scenery.

1089315,A3MCJKKJ8TG0ZO,B000TFFNSU,"S. Mitchell ""quirky reader""","[2, 2]","I bought several snow/Christmas DVDs, but this is the only one I ever watch.  It is simply perfect.  Anyone who says the snow is computer-generated or that the picture is grainy needs to get a new TV!  You can actually watch the snow accumulate flake-by-flake in some of the close-ups.  The music is lovely, guitar and/or piano, simple yet interesting arrangements ---neither overly lush nor new-agey.  I usually put it on 1/3 to 1/2 the usual volume.  You can also just mute it if you want the picture only, or if you want to play different music.  I love the the variety of scenes.  At first I wanted the scenes to change more often, but then I relaxed into it and now it seems perfectly paced.  It is like looking out the window on a snowy day, something I used to do as a child living up north.  My favorite segment is the one that goes with ""O Come O Come Emanuel,"" because the snow dramatically changes in the course of the segment, even changing direction and speed as the wind changes.  This is the perfect video for background mood if you are having a party, for present opening, and --- what I most use it for --- to unwind after a stressful day.  I even watch it on miserably hot days, just to cool myself off.  I have given this DVD as gifts several times, and the recipients have all said they love it too.

I've purchased others like this that cut too often and don't really seem to get why it is that people buy these.  These folks get it and even include some excellent, folky, Christmas music to go with the images.  The loops are a good idea and a great way to experience this sort of disc.There are a couple of ways this could be better, though.  First, it should be on blu ray.  There's no excuse for it not being so since it was supposedly shot in high def.  At this price, it should be.  Second, the fades to black at the end of each song are distracting.  I'd do away with those.  Third, it would be nice if the natural audio was an option all the way through.  I really liked hearing it on the looped scenes.Overall, I recommend this.  If it were on blu, it would definitely rate five stars.Oh, and to the person who stated this to be a ""dreary"" DVD, they must have been off their meds.
