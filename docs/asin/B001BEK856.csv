We wanted so much for this to be the best Thomas ever. Well, it's good - I mean really good, but I'm sorry, Pierce Brosnan is not the right person to do the voiceover. OK, that's just my opinion and I'm not even sure whether my 3-yr-old agrees or not.Brosnan sounds like he is doing toddler Shakespeare. He is a little over the top for me. There are moments when this works and others where it would be nice to be a little more ""story-like."" What do I mean? Well, it's the difference between a good actor and a great actor. I don't want to think about the narrator while I'm watching a Thomas episode. I want him to just BE there, reading it really well. Even Ringo pulled this off and I never thought it possible.All that said, the movie is great - lots of thrills and plots. And of course we all learn great lessons as we resolve the issues of the day.

He is Thomas crazy, and will even watch the older Thomas episodes with Carlin and Baldwin as narrators.Well, The Great Discovery held his attention for about 15 minutes, then he walked out.  I can't say I blame him, really.  I was dissappointed, to say the least.First, Pierce Brosnan.  He's a great Bond, but a lousy narrator.  After listening to him, my wife said, ""It sounds like he's being forced to do it.""  In my opinion, he tried too hard to make it work.  Sadly, it didn't.Some parts of the movie were just downright phony.  An engine falling into the water and doesn't sink?  An engine flying across a chasm?  Oh, and just happens to skid to a halt next to a railroad track?  (How convenient!)The plot worked, although it did get a bit mushy in places.  Sir Topham Hatt declaring an island-wide State of Emergency after Thomas disappears? That's a bit overboard.I did like the minature work the producers did on Great Waterton.  The models were very impressive.  The new engine Stanley is a good addition.  The other engines are marking time.  Jeremy the Jet makes a cameo.  Personally, I think the producers were just cranking out one last Thomas in minature until they perfected their CGI.I could do without the Rap version of the Thomas theme song.  The last thing we need gangsterized is Thomas and Friends.Give 2-year olds credit.  They know what's good.  Unfortunately, this DVD now makes a great bookend.Save your money.

So I'm a little disappointed when the movies tend to be less realistic than the TV show.This is a few years old now, with lots of great animated TV episodes released since then (and Misty Island Rescue).  My son loves Thomas so much that I hope they just keep making more Thomas features like Hero of the Rails. I bought this because my son hadn't seen it and even old non-animated Thomas is ""new"" Thomas to him.I really love Michael Brandon's narration and even Ringo did a good job.  I really like Pierce Brosnan as an actor but I found his narration really dull and strangely lifeless.  Although I really hated his Thomas voice, he did a great job with some of the other engines and Sir Topham Hatt.The story is a bit similar to Misty Island Rescue, which came much later. Thomas is out exploring and finds the long lost town of Waterton that nobody knew was there (Thomas also ""discovers"" Misty Island). Sir Topham Hatt undertakes the huge restoration project and needs the help of all the engines (similar to the construction of the Rescue Center in Misty Island) to get it done for Sodor Day.  A new engine, Stanley, is introduced, and Thomas becomes very jealous.  In usual Thomas fashion, he does something he shouldn't and Sir Topham Hatt announces the usual disaster has ocurred.Thomas feels very bad and decides to stay up at night to be a very useful engine.  However, he ends up going down a mine tunnel, getting carried away playing, and crashes through a barricade into what looks like an underground slow river.  And he floats! Neat trick that.A state of emergency is called and everyone goes searching for Thomas. Even the schoolchildren take the day off school to go look.  The river ultimately spits him out the side of a cliff, but instead of falling straight down along with the waterfall, he flies across the chasm to the other side, goes crashing down a hill, and ends up in a pile of dirt by some old tracks. Stanley finds him and they end up saving each other.My 3 year old loves re-enacting the bridge scene where Thomas almost crashes into a ravine when an old bridge collapses, but he does get a little tense and scared.  He also loves re-enacting the scene where Thomas goes too fast and crashes.  So his Thomas wooden set is taking a beating thanks to this feature!He likes it and it has a good message (jealousy is bad!) and that is what is important.
