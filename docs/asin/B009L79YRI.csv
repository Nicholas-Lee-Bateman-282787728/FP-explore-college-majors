Oleson,"[2, 3]","British actress Juno Temple's career got a great start with films like ""Notes On A Scandal"" and ""Atonement"" but more recently she's gone for rebellious, sexy teens headed for trouble.  The results have been mixed ranging from the excellent ""Killer Joe"" to the wretched ""Jack and Diane.""Here she plays Lily, a 15 year old living in the crumbling town surrounding the dead Salton Sea in California.  Her best friend, Alison (Kay Panabaker) is more reserved but both are looking for a way out.  While both actresses were in their early 20's when the film was shot, Lily is the more physically developed and uses her attributes on a trio of skateboarders from L. A.  Alison, with her spindly frame looks more like a 15 year old but is still willing to make the drive to the city to hook up with the boys.Much of the film sets up the stage for their getaway.  Lily has a strained relationship with her mother (nice dramatic performance by Leslie Mann) and her aunt (Kate Bosworth).  Alison lives at home with her surviving parent, a father (David Warshofsky) who is in a state of deep depression.  When the girls get to the big city and reunite with the boys, Lily connects with Jesse (Kyle Gallner) but Alison is put off by all of them.The boys are a bit older and have taken up quarters in an abandon motel in a crummy part of town.  The other two (Chris Coy and Carlos Pena) have their sights set on mugging on-line perverts in which Lily is used for bait.  As one might expect, this tactic isn't foolproof.  Director and writer Elgin James moves the story along slowly, very slowly and it is easy to get invested in the girl's welfare.  At the same time we know where it's all going.  Ultimately the film is about friendship and survival.  A nice twist in the 3rd act almost makes the journey worth it.

People live there (wonder why and how) among rotten trailer parks and abandoned filthy pools. They have kids! Kids are bored, uneducated and have absolutely nothing to do.Lily (Juno Temple) and Alison (Kay Panabaker) are two 15-year old friends that live in this desolate area. Lily lives with her mother (Leslie Mann) who is single (or divorced?). Alison's father is some kind of ridiculous slow, maybe alcoholic individual who is unable to take care of himself and doesn't really care about his daughter. Lily, visits with her young and already washed up Aunt (Kate Bosworth) who takes care of her husband (?) who obviously has problems (...apparently he was shot in the head and is unable to take care of himself, but we never get the story).  Obviously, the father figure, like in most movies coming from Hollywood, is missing and when he is part of the plot, the father in most current films, plays minor roles in the life of adolescents. Maybe the problem of today's society starts right there? Fathers are always portrayed as weak and selfish individuals, who most of the time don't understand the ""complicated"" mind of adolescents.One day Lily and Alison meet a band of young boys who came there from LA and just ...have nothing to do also. Lily falls for one of the boys and decides to follow him to LA. Alison goes with her. And in LA while there are plenty of things to do, still the boys and girls are bored and find nothing constructive to do. Until they decide to do something really stupid and the consequences are serious.I am not sure what would be the message of this movie: the new generation lives in misery and boredom and the parents are at fault? I don't know. The father figure is missing and that may explain a lot of things as far as the behavior of adolescents today.Juno Temple is just outstanding in her role. Recently, I have seen her in the same role of a bored teenager that really doesn't do much all day long, in three movies including this one (Killer Joe and Jack and Diane are the other two). I have seen her in the past in ""Cracks"" and ""Attonement"".  She is really very talented. ""Cracks"" is an outstanding movie and the performance of Eva Green overshadows everybody. Still Juno Temple distinguishes herself.Five stars for the acting and the direction.
