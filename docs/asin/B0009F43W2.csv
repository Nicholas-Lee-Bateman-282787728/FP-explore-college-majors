The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad...Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame.In essence, the film might have had potential if only the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...In a nutshell, you mind find it amusing if you're under 13 and/or are heavily intoxicated, and that's about it. Rent or buy (ha ha ha) at your own risk.

904708,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009F43W2,Tsuyoshi,"[19, 20]","The most famous person included in this terribly unfunny comedy is Michael Jackson, whose face you can see on DVD cover.  But remember, Michael Jackson is in the film for about 3 minutes (or maybe more) and you have to wait more than one hour to see him as 'Agent M.J.'As the title suggests, the film is a spoof of many of recent hit films ranging from 'Cast Away' 'Miss Congeniality' 'The Sixth Sense' 'Catch Me If You Can' etc.  The comedy is in the vein of 'Airplane!' so Eric Roberts plays the caddish pilot of an airplane flying to Japan, carrying beauty pagents.  But my point is not its story, nor low-budget origin.The problem is, 'Miss Cast Away and the Island Girls' needs much, much, much more jokes and gags, clever or gross or whatever funny to sustain its 90 minutes.  You need to think of jokes better than saying 'I can see dead people' and show the lookalike of Elvis and Chaplin.  The film has no hilarious mood that Abrams/Zucker/Zucker had imbued their classic comedy with.Films like 'Naked Gun' 'Hot Shots!' and 'Austin Power' in fact spend so much energy to create tons of silly gags, and that's how they work.  They are made with one minute one gag (or more) basis, and we keep watching, enjoying the show.  'Miss Cast Away' only repeats the same pattern of jokes over and over again.  In 'The Island' you can see one fierce creature, actually a big bad pig named 'Jurassic Pork' with a subtitle 'Jurassic Pork' and ... there's nothing more, well, except it attacks the poor passangers on the beach.  And one of them is eaten by the animal.  If you think it's funny, it's your film.I know no one watches this kind of film to see great CGIs, but the cheesy special effects of this film make me wonder whether it is meant as serious or joke.  'Jurassic Pork' is one example, of which effects are worse than the animations in the pop-ups.  I think it is intentional, but even so, the slack timing and editing makes it look like otherwise.Anyway, this is not my cup of tea as one old lady (perhaps the director's own mother) at the end credit says.  Believe me or not, she is much funnier than most of the jokes in the film.",1,"Three Minutes of Michael Jackson, and Painfully Long and Terribly Bad Spoof",1125792000,"09 4, 2005",2005,2143,"['most', 'famous', 'person', 'included', 'terribly', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'face', 'can', 'see', 'DVD', 'cover', 'remember', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'film', '3', 'minutes', 'maybe', 'more', 'have', 'wait', 'more', 'one', 'hour', 'see', ""'Agent"", ""M.J.'As"", 'title', 'film', 'spoof', 'many', 'recent', 'hit', 'films', 'ranging', ""'Cast"", 'Away', ""'Miss"", 'Congeniality', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Me', 'Can', 'etc', 'comedy', 'vein', ""'Airplane"", 'so', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'caddish', 'pilot', 'airplane', 'flying', 'Japan', 'carrying', 'beauty', 'pagents', 'point', 'not', 'story', 'low-budget', 'origin.The', 'problem', ""'Miss"", 'Cast', 'Away', 'Island', 'Girls', 'needs', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'jokes', 'gags', 'clever', 'gross', 'funny', 'sustain', '90', 'minutes', 'need', 'think', 'jokes', 'better', 'saying', 'can', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'show', 'lookalike', 'Elvis', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'hilarious', 'mood', 'Abrams/Zucker/Zucker', 'had', 'imbued', 'classic', 'comedy', 'with.Films', ""'Naked"", 'Gun', ""'Hot"", 'Shots', 'Power', 'fact', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'create', 'tons', 'silly', 'gags', 'how', 'work', 'are', 'made', 'one', 'minute', 'one', 'gag', 'more', 'basis', 'keep', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'show', 'Cast', 'Away', 'only', 'same', 'pattern', 'jokes', 'over', 'again', ""'The"", 'Island', 'can', 'see', 'one', 'fierce', 'creature', 'actually', 'big', 'bad', 'pig', 'named', ""'Jurassic"", 'Pork', 'subtitle', ""'Jurassic"", 'Pork', 'nothing', 'more', 'well', 'poor', 'passangers', 'beach', 'one', 'eaten', 'animal', 'think', 'funny', 'film.I', 'know', 'one', 'kind', 'film', 'see', 'great', 'CGIs', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'make', 'wonder', 'meant', 'serious', 'joke', ""'Jurassic"", 'Pork', 'one', 'example', 'effects', 'are', 'worse', 'animations', 'pop-ups', 'think', 'intentional', 'even', 'so', 'slack', 'timing', 'editing', 'look', 'otherwise.Anyway', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'one', 'old', 'lady', 'perhaps', 'director', 'own', 'mother', 'end', 'credit', 'Believe', 'not', 'much', 'funnier', 'most', 'jokes', 'film']",Miss Cast Away & The Island Girls
