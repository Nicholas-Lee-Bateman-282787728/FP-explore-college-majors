There are some Yoga positions mixed in, but there's some other stuff.  There's some Pilates and some things I do not recognize (dance?), but it's sequences reasonably well.  It's not too complicated, and it's never REALLY hard.  Dr Lisa (The TV personality - I do not watch her show, but she seems cheerful enough)does not lead the workout, but that's often true of these 'celebrity workouts.'  She provides some comments and encouragement.  Not a distraction, but not a great help either. I would reccommend it as being a fairly decent beginner exercise DVD.  If you want something that's pretty easy for a beginner and not too much of a time committment (Three 20 minute workouts on one disc)this is not bad.

1586914,A19UTUEBWKIZFT,B009904NLY,AKN,"[0, 0]","I've been taking yoga classes for eight years twice a week.  I kept looking for the yoga in this.  I finally found it in the last third of the video:* sun salutations* chair position* pidgeon* side stretches* cat --bastardized into more movements that are not yogaThey couldn't even include the bridge pose.  This was five lousy yoga poses thrown in at the end.That was pretty much it for the yoga.  At one point it was announced that they were going to do the warrior, and the triangle stance was assumed, but that was as close as they got.This is the very buff Dr. Lisa of Dr. Oz fame and her personal trainer, in a poolside setting, doing some arobics in place, followed by strength work.This is not for beginners.  If you are out of shape and hoping this would be some easy yoga to make you limber up and feel good, this isn't it.  You need to be in shape to get through the vigorous arobic ""warm up"", and the pushups and body strengthening work involved in this.Those who have been in shape for a while will recognize every move in this as your very basic arobic and strength work class with some half hearted yoga moves thrown in at the end so they can slap the yoga label on the title.I wasn't impressed with this. There was no music at all.  There was just the trainer leading Dr. Lisa through a very standard boring arobic and strength routine with a few yoga postures at the end.I've never before seen any workout video with no music.With every new stetch in the final minutes of stretches Dr. Lisa would say ""This feels sooo good.  This is a really great stretch.""  It was apparent zero thought was put into making this good, fun, relaxing or something anyone would actually want to watch and do.  I thought it was all surprisingly awful.I felt the yoga part of the title was misleading.  I thought this would be an arobic yoga class, which I have taken for years, which is all yoga, done in a fast paced way, flowing from one position smoothly to the next, quickly, for some extra arobic conditioning.There are so many great workout and yoga videos out there, you can pass on this one.  This was boring, and even Dr. Lisa looked out of it and bored.Surely Dr. Lisa isn't as dull as she seemed in this.",2,More blast than yoga,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,2213,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'taking', 'yoga', 'classes', 'eight', 'years', 'twice', 'week', 'kept', 'looking', 'yoga', 'finally', 'found', 'last', 'third', 'video', '*', 'sun', 'salutations*', 'chair', 'position*', 'pidgeon*', 'side', 'stretches*', 'cat', 'bastardized', 'more', 'movements', 'are', 'not', 'yogaThey', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'include', 'bridge', 'pose', 'was', 'five', 'lousy', 'yoga', 'poses', 'thrown', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'yoga', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'announced', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'warrior', 'triangle', 'stance', 'was', 'assumed', 'was', 'as', 'close', 'got.This', 'very', 'buff', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Dr.', 'Oz', 'fame', 'personal', 'trainer', 'poolside', 'setting', 'doing', 'arobics', 'place', 'followed', 'strength', 'work.This', 'not', 'beginners', 'are', 'shape', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'yoga', 'make', 'limber', 'up', 'feel', 'good', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'shape', 'get', 'vigorous', 'arobic', 'warm', 'up', 'pushups', 'body', 'strengthening', 'work', 'involved', 'this.Those', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'shape', 'while', 'will', 'recognize', 'move', 'very', 'basic', 'arobic', 'strength', 'work', 'class', 'half', 'hearted', 'yoga', 'moves', 'thrown', 'end', 'can', 'slap', 'yoga', 'label', 'title.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'was', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'trainer', 'leading', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'very', 'standard', 'boring', 'arobic', 'strength', 'routine', 'few', 'yoga', 'postures', 'end.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'workout', 'video', 'music.With', 'new', 'stetch', 'final', 'minutes', 'stretches', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'would', 'say', 'feels', 'sooo', 'good', 'really', 'great', 'stretch', 'was', 'apparent', 'zero', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'making', 'good', 'fun', 'relaxing', 'something', 'anyone', 'would', 'actually', 'want', 'watch', 'do', 'thought', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'awful.I', 'felt', 'yoga', 'part', 'title', 'was', 'misleading', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'arobic', 'yoga', 'class', 'have', 'taken', 'years', 'yoga', 'done', 'fast', 'paced', 'way', 'flowing', 'one', 'position', 'smoothly', 'next', 'quickly', 'extra', 'arobic', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'workout', 'yoga', 'videos', 'there', 'can', 'pass', 'one', 'was', 'boring', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'looked', 'bored.Surely', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', ""n't"", 'as', 'dull', 'seemed']",DR.

1586917,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B009904NLY,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[0, 1]","I am a 50ish former amateur athlete trying to stay in shape.  I'm looking for alternatives to exercise equipment, and something more entertaining than just running down the street.  So I ordered this video without any expectations.  I'm pleased with what I have found.  Looking forward to Elise Joan's enthusiasm helps me get up and wander downstairs to the exercise room in the morning.Previous reviewers had difficulty with the content relative to the title, ""Dr. Lisa Yoga Blast.""  I think everyone needs to realize that exercise is a very personal experience, so video titles won't accurately describe the content for everyone, and this DVD is no exception.  This DVD contains three workouts, all yoga inspired, yet I can see how someone might say they aren't exactly ""yoga."" The segments occur in the following sequence: cardio, strength, and stretch.  Total length is approximately 63 minutes.  The cardio isn't terribly intense (I picked up a couple of small weights to make it so), and the activities are ""dance"" oriented, probably more fun for and easier for the ladies.  It took me several tries to feel comfortable with the moves, but it does get your heart going.Apparently Dr. Lisa has some name recognition, because her name and image are on the product, she provides the video introduction on the DVD, and the director gave her plenty of license to add meaningless banter throughout the three workouts. All three sequences are led by Instructor Elise Joan, who is without question the star of this video.  Elise should release her own line of videos, and her website seems to indicate she is in production to do exactly that.Elise Joan is completely qualified to lead exercise videos for a variety of reasons.  First, she has a fun sense of humor.  Clearly she has led thousands of hours of classes because her banter is relevant, motivating, and at times humorous.  (In the cardio section, Dr. Lisa is dropping some meaningless banter on us saying we are going to sleep well, Elise says, ""O my gosh, I'm about to get a good nights sleep right now!"" Then in the strength section Elise says ""There is no 'gitty up' without the giddy!"" and ""Lets channel our inner warrior."")  Several moments throughout the DVD, she seems to smile at Dr. Lisa's behavior, and since most of us watching this video are doing exactly that, its as if Elise is actually in the moment.Second, she has a gorgeous figure.  Clearly, Elise Joan is no newcomer to these challenging ""strength"" sequences (squatting, lunging, leg lifting, etc.)  She is a handsome woman who has earned her remarkable assets (double entendre totally intended).  She is fun to watch, which helps my motivation problem.Third, Elise is highly credible, because she does every exercise in perfect form no matter how difficult.  Some of the exercises are brutal on the thighs, which begin to shake from the intensity and fatigue.  Elise says she loves the ""shake,"" but it doesn't look like anything on Elise is shaking.  Unlike other reviewers, I'll start criticizing Dr. Lisa just as soon as my form gets better than hers (not yet).  In the meantime we can all watch Elise and know what perfect form looks like (another double entendre).  If it gets too easy, doing a better job following the full range of motion, dropping as low, etc., and its not so easy any more.So, lets keep an eye out for more workout videos featuring Instructor Elise Joan, and thanks to Dr. Lisa Masterson for bringing her to our attention.",5,Instructor Elise Joan Makes This Video Hot!,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3477,"['am', '50ish', 'former', 'amateur', 'athlete', 'trying', 'stay', 'shape', ""'m"", 'looking', 'alternatives', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'something', 'more', 'entertaining', 'just', 'running', 'down', 'street', 'ordered', 'video', 'expectations', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'what', 'have', 'found', 'Looking', 'forward', 'Elise', 'Joan', 'enthusiasm', 'get', 'up', 'wander', 'downstairs', 'exercise', 'room', 'morning.Previous', 'reviewers', 'had', 'difficulty', 'content', 'relative', 'title', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Yoga', 'Blast', 'think', 'everyone', 'needs', 'realize', 'exercise', 'very', 'personal', 'experience', 'so', 'video', 'titles', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accurately', 'describe', 'content', 'everyone', 'DVD', 'exception', 'DVD', 'three', 'workouts', 'yoga', 'inspired', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'might', 'say', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'yoga', 'segments', 'occur', 'following', 'sequence', 'cardio', 'strength', 'stretch', 'Total', 'length', 'approximately', '63', 'minutes', 'cardio', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'intense', 'picked', 'up', 'couple', 'small', 'weights', 'make', 'so', 'activities', 'are', 'dance', 'oriented', 'probably', 'more', 'fun', 'easier', 'ladies', 'took', 'several', 'tries', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'moves', 'get', 'heart', 'going.Apparently', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'name', 'recognition', 'name', 'image', 'are', 'product', 'video', 'introduction', 'DVD', 'director', 'gave', 'plenty', 'license', 'add', 'meaningless', 'banter', 'three', 'workouts', 'three', 'sequences', 'are', 'led', 'Instructor', 'Elise', 'Joan', 'who', 'question', 'star', 'video', 'Elise', 'should', 'release', 'own', 'line', 'videos', 'website', 'indicate', 'production', 'do', 'exactly', 'that.Elise', 'Joan', 'completely', 'qualified', 'lead', 'exercise', 'videos', 'variety', 'reasons', 'First', 'fun', 'sense', 'humor', 'Clearly', 'led', 'thousands', 'hours', 'classes', 'banter', 'relevant', 'motivating', 'times', 'humorous', 'cardio', 'section', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'dropping', 'meaningless', 'banter', 'saying', 'are', 'going', 'sleep', 'well', 'Elise', 'O', 'gosh', ""'m"", 'get', 'good', 'nights', 'sleep', 'right', 'now', 'Then', 'strength', 'section', 'Elise', 'up', 'giddy', 'Lets', 'channel', 'inner', 'warrior', 'Several', 'moments', 'DVD', 'smile', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'behavior', 'most', 'watching', 'video', 'are', 'doing', 'exactly', 'Elise', 'actually', 'moment.Second', 'gorgeous', 'figure', 'Clearly', 'Elise', 'Joan', 'newcomer', 'challenging', 'strength', 'sequences', 'squatting', 'lunging', 'leg', 'lifting', 'etc', 'handsome', 'woman', 'who', 'earned', 'remarkable', 'assets', 'double', 'entendre', 'totally', 'intended', 'fun', 'watch', 'motivation', 'problem.Third', 'Elise', 'highly', 'credible', 'exercise', 'perfect', 'form', 'matter', 'how', 'difficult', 'exercises', 'are', 'brutal', 'thighs', 'begin', 'shake', 'intensity', 'fatigue', 'Elise', 'shake', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'Elise', 'shaking', 'other', 'reviewers', ""'ll"", 'start', 'criticizing', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'form', 'better', 'hers', 'not', 'yet', 'meantime', 'can', 'watch', 'Elise', 'know', 'what', 'perfect', 'form', 'double', 'entendre', 'too', 'easy', 'doing', 'better', 'job', 'following', 'full', 'range', 'motion', 'dropping', 'low', 'etc.', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'more.So', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'more', 'workout', 'featuring', 'Instructor', 'Elise', 'Joan', 'thanks', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Masterson', 'bringing', 'attention']",DR.

I am a novice in yoga and was looking for something easy to learn ... this video is not it. This is a mixture of cardio and yoga, mostly cardio dance moves. It is true, the workouts are 20 minutes short, but I was expecting something more basic to get us started. This is a little bit more advanced than what we expected.The yoga moves are the basic stretches, but more advanced than the average beginner's moves. The cardio is mostly dance moves, which are easy but can be tiring if you are not used to it. The sudden switch from dance to yoga did throw me off balance because here I am exercising heartily then all of a sudden, I am expected to drop in a yoga pose. It gets confusing at times. I think with time and practice, I might get used to it.If you're looking to mix up your exercise routine, this might be a good video to have, but only if you're aware that it is not a yoga video.

1586921,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B009904NLY,Colleen M. Schneider,"[8, 9]","I work out daily so I am always on the lookout for new routines to try.  This work out was good, but I wouldn't say it will become a new favorite.  Here are the likes/dislikes:Likes: Beautiful outdoor setting, instructor is clear and shows good form.  The strength training I enjoyed the most as it is a combination of ballet barre type exercises, and a bit more yoga, sun salutations, planks, prayer twists, etc.  The music in this secion was a little on the jazzier side.  This is the longest at 22 minutes. The stretching was also good, with more yoga poses as well as some pilates moves for your core.  This section was 20 minutes and I also thought it was well done, combining the different styles of exercise.Dislikes: The first section, which was cardio was a little strange, the dance is supposed to be hip-hop, which seems to just be a catch all term for anything where you shake your butt a little.  Nothing really hip-hop about those moves in my opinion.  The moves are taught slowly then done to tempo.  They weren't very complex so I would think most beginners could catch on fairly quickly.  The other part that I didn't care for was that they do down-dog from yoga but never roll out a mat. It is a very awkward transition, and unless you are working on a very sturdy surface and you are wearing shoes, this would not be how you should attempt a pose like this, you should have a sticky mat so that you don't slip on your floor or carpet. For good form, I would keep my eye on the trainer, occasionally I would see Dr. Lisa start to arch her back, as in a plank/push-up.  The instructor will tell you how to modify as well.  A personal thing with me as I don't care for a lot of chatting, so this one was a little annoying on the chattiness scale, and a bit too much commentary from Dr. Lisa about how exercise is good for you and preventative and all that....we know, we know.....Overall, if I had borrowed this one from the library I probably would not have been compelled to purchase it, but would probably have gone back occasionally for the stretch and strength segments.

These are Yoga-based workouts, however, there are several moves that are derived from ballet and even hip-hop.  The title, ""Yoga Blast,"" is somewhat of a misnomer in that regard.  There are moves, or blasts, which take off from some yoga moves.  For example, the Peaceful Warrior move is used almost in a freestyle manner, or blast during the cardio portion.  The three workouts are:*  Cardio (21 minutes)*  Strength (22 minutes)*  Power Stretch (20 minutes)The workouts, which are ""all about conditioning and having fun,"" will do just that if you stick with them.  Elise Joan, Dr. Masterson's trainer, is superb and moves right along with her instruction, demonstrating via her body the proper way to move.  There is no delineation of each move, but there is a some scattered commentary from Dr. Masterson about the purpose.  For example, when performing one exercise to strengthen the hips, she claims that it's ""going to help you in so many ways, not just in the bedroom.""  Seriously?Elise Joan is definitely worth watching as she's a pro and her method of explaining what she is doing is spot on.  The added commentary from Dr. Masterson was quite distracting and took the fun out of the workouts.  These are loosely yoga-based, but definitely not fully.

Very soon into it I realized ""yoga blast"" referred to a yoga infusion into an otherwise energetic workout.  So this really isn't yoga, but I thought ""all right, it's still a workout"".And it is a workout.  And it's fun.  I rather enjoyed the three programs for what they were.  However, that's all that's really offered here besides the adorableness of Dr. Lisa and her trainer.  The good is that these exercises, even the stretch program, were rather energetic.  Work gets done.  It's all low-impact, which is a bonus for those not wanting too much struggle.  I trust these women know what they are talking about and demonstrating.  But even accepting the exercises, this remained a rather ""eh"" DVD for me.My complaints:  I feel very little is properly discussed, which is saying something as both women talk incessantly.  A good workout DVD should be as good a substitute for a teacher as possible.  While these women vaguely mentioned what they were doing, I felt I was relying almost entirely on sight when I prefer the instructor to specifically describe what I ought to be doing with my body.  The lessons move rather fast, which isn't a bad thing by itself--but I can't help but feel lost as I'm still wondering if I moved right.  If you're going to talk so much, make it useful.The other criticism (I can't call it a complaint as I overall enjoyed the workouts) is this program really doesn't seem to know what it wants to do.  Beyond the ""yoga infusion"" I don't know if this is ballet, dance... I""m guessing it's just general movement.  So... fun stuff to do, but it seems most consumers are looking for something specific.Exercise-wise, this DVD is fine.

I'm all for no wasted time and she combines a couple of yoga moves so that you don't have the downtime between them.  Uhm, I guess that was one interesting thing.Elise is an inexperienced dance instructor: There are no verbal cues - she just starts something new and tells you, ""Doesn't it feel good?"" She is also likely to put in a new hip-hop move and start counting it in without telling anyone.Hip hop? Ballet?  Hip circles?  This could be a useful warm up tape.  Some of these moves could be useful for loosening up -- other people, at least.  The guys at my gym would really laugh at me doing any of these moves.

Sometimes Dr. Lisa watches so intently she misses steps.  It was really LOL funny to watch Dr. Lisa miss the moves. Then call out WOOO or LOVE IT!

The DVD appears good,  my wife is going to give it a go and see what she thinks. To me it looks like every other exercise DVD. It takes place with a natural background, like a garden setting. I noticed that they didn't keep one camera angle long and kept jumping around the various views so if you are new to the moves they are showing and were trying to keep an eye on a particular move it would be a challenge since they seem to switch camera angles frequently.

Although we do seek effective exercises within the categories of the videos we choose, it is more likely we want either to have fun or an excuse to get together with a friend to motivate us to workout.Dr. Lisa Yoga Blast provides plenty of opportunity to have fun. Elise Joan provides dedication and instruction alongside Dr. Lisa, who probably cut a deal as an endorser in exchange for her yoga lessons and a cut of the video profits.Despite the overcast weather, the production value is admirable. Camera pans and modest sweeps keep the workout in motion; it is not a still-frame production. Ambient workout tunes play along in the background at an appropriately soft level. The scenery depicts a beautiful poolside patio with a descending hillside backdrop for the cardio chapter, while the strength and power stretch chapters take place at a more tree-secluded entertaining venue at the edge of the yard, with a vine-wrapped, pillar-lined walkabout in the background of the level barbecue patio cleared off for the yoga mats amidst the lawn.This sixty-three minute workout video is broken down into three separate tracks. All can play back with one menu selection, or choose an individual segment for playback; these tracks consist of twenty-one minutes of cardio, twenty-two minutes of strength and twenty minutes of power stretch.It is more blast, than yoga. The power stretch chapter is more familiar to what I perceive as yoga than what I find in the first two chapters. Each chapter is built upon activities fitting to the title of the chapter. Elise makes the most of every stretch and pose, while Dr. Lisa keeps up for the most part, occasionally getting lazy with the motions, sometimes coming across as limber-impaired, which makes for some fun conversational critiquing among workout partners when discovering these moments throughout the video.You will not be able to contort into a pretzel after a week of watching this video; however, if you like to get together with a friend and have some fun trying to follow along during a workout video, Dr. Lisa's Yoga Blast can certainly be a blast. The routines are low-impact, simple and effective. No special equipment is required, except for either a lawn chair or some other suitable, stable surface that is handy for doing the reverse leg lifts.

By static, I mean the mindless banter which goes on either by the instructor alone or by the entire collage of people involved. Quiet is good, a little bit a music is also nice every now and again but should be able to be muted out if you don't want it. I didn't see where we could do that in this video.In the first two segments we don't have any real yoga until the end where they throw in positions just to cool down the body. The third segment is completely yoga which I preferred and the music was quieter here than the other segments. Lisa's trainer, Elise Joan, is very good and she instructs well on her own. With Lisa interfering and suggesting her own ideas, we have a problem. Lisa is not graceful nor is she accomplished in any of these 3 segments. She's quite annoying as she always has something to say and she's following the instructor more than joining in and sharing the ride. It feels unprofessional and looks even worse.For me, this is not a soothing, relaxing or comfortable DVD.

I was initially very excited to get this workout.  The title ""Yoga blast"" implied that the workouts were yoga based, and I liked the fact when ordering this that the workouts were billed at being 20 minutes each, as I am always pressed for time nowadays when I work out.Unfortunately this workout was not what I expected.  The first workout is a cardio hip hop workout with yoga down dogs and up dogs thrown in.  It is a 22 minute workout.  Dr. Lisa follows along in the workout to Elise Joan, the instructor and designer of the workouts.  The hip hop moves were very simplistic, ideal for a beginner.  However, I have been excersizing for some time, and I found the moves boring and too easy to do.  It is very odd to go from dancing, to suddently doing yoga.  I did not think this first workout blended the styles of excersize well at all.The second workout is toning, at 21 minutes, fairs slightly better than the first.  This routine is a combination of ballet and yoga.  These non aerobic types of excersize flow much better together than hip hop and yoga.  You will need a chair to do the standing toning excersizes.The third workout is by far the best one.  It is athletic stretching/yoga.  This is also the only workout that really is just 20 minutes.  This workout has the most traditional yoga poses, and is best if you do not have a lot of time to work out.Overall, I did not like these workouts.  The DVD is billed as Dr. Lisa being the trainer in the workouts-this is not true, she follows the excersizes Elise Joan comes up with.  Dr. Lisa and Elise Joan also spend the entire workouts, after they have taught you the moves, chatting about how good excersize is for you-I like instruction and relaxing music, not chattiness about how good excersize is for you.  I already know that, I work out regularly.  I also wanted traditional yoga, which is what I like best-I don't like hybrids of yoga, which is what this DVD.  Yoga simply does not blend well with aerobic excersize.

The first segment is primarily cardio with about five minutes of Yoga worked in.  The second (strength) segment is mostly barre with a bit of yoga.  The final (stretch) segment is a mostly yoga routine.Who it's for: I think this would be suitable for beginner or intermediate exercisers.  Severely unflexible beginners might have issue (and intermediates will like the cardio better if they have room to make movements ""big"").  Some modifications are offered, but not many. It's marketed toward beginners and I think that's accurate, though I am more intermediate and enjoyed it.What I like:  The simple instructions and wide camera angles are easy to follow---and very beginner appropriate. The set is gorgeous and relaxing (outdoors with lots of pretty flowers).  I love barre, and its nice to have this 20 minute option.  I actually liked that Dr Lisa occasionally looks are awkward as I sometimes feel.  The overall quality is very relaxing, yet beneficial.Why it lost a star:  The title is misleading as to the content.  While I enjoyed it, there were some segments that felt rough on my wrists and knees.  Wished for more beginner/advanced modifications.

However, even with that, I was surprised and disappointed by this DVD.  This workout is labeled a ""yoga based workout"".  Really?  Given all that, I think that someone will enjoy this DVD - just not me.The DVD offers three different workouts that are each around 20 minutes long, and the menu options let you do them individually or all at once. Dr. Lisa Masterson of the TV show The Doctors (a show I have never seen) is the ""name"" and Elise Joan is the chief instructor in all three segments. They both try to make the workout fun while adding helpful commentary about the benefits of the various exercises. Boy do they try!  I lost count of the number of times they listed the benefits of working out in general or of specific moves and somehow ""having fun"" was alway on the list - or tacked on after the list.  Dr. Lisa's commentary seemed painfully stilted to me as she cited the seemingly same list of benefits over and over.  When she wasn't citing those benefits, she was exclaiming how great and fun the moves were.Despite all this, the DVD does give a variety of workout options.  Those include:CardioThe cardio section combines ""dance steps"". They usually started with what looked like walking moves to me and just added some twists.  They would go through a set of moves several times in slow motion - more times than even me, the total dance klutz, needed.  Then, they would speed it up.  There were some strength-based moves including some yoga after two or three combinations.  My reaction was, ""You want me to do WHAT now?""StrengthThe strength section incorporates a lot of ballet-inspired exercises, along with yoga poses. This workout doesn't require any equipment other than a chair for balance. I'm not into barre workouts, but for those who are, this might be a good strength option in a mainstream DVD with multiple workout options.Power StretchThe stretching section is a blend of stretching, yoga poses, and Pilates exercises to help promote balance, flexibility and strength. This is probably my favorite section of the DVD. They did offer some modifications for some of the exercises.  I enjoyed it up to the point that the moves couldn't be done my painful arthritic knee.  I just can't do the pigeon and double pigeon (is that the right name?) these days.ConclusionThe moves on this DVD really are low impact and they do give some modifications along the way.

1586940,A1QVFHPY8418HC,B009904NLY,monkuboy,"[0, 0]","One of the reasons I ordered this DVD was because my wife was looking for an exercise video so I figured we could both use this one. It is geared mainly for women but for most things, exercise is exercise, right?First thing, as many have pointed out, this is really not much of a ""yoga"" video so why it is called ""Yoga Blast"" escapes me except I have to think they are trying to capitalize on the popularity of yoga and set it apart from the numerous other exercise videos out there of which this one to me seems not much different in terms of a workout.What I initially noticed when viewing the DVD is how revealing Dr. Lisa's outfit is, leaving little to the imagination. What's funny is the next day articles appeared in the news about how Lululemon has recalled the yoga pants it manufactures because they are too sheer and revealing. That gave me a good laugh because I was thinking Dr. Lisa and her assistant Joan must be wearing Lululemon gear. It looks just way too tight.The exercise routines themselves to me are beneficial although I find some to be too difficult, at least for now. But there are three different routines on the DVD and overall it seems to provide a well-rounded workout if you have the time to go through all of them. Both of the instructors do an awful lot of talking and there is hardly any silence.  Is that talking helpful?  I'd say the first time through a lot of it is useful information but then if you do these routines regularly it gets to be tiresome. A reviewer found Dr. Lisa to be particularly annoying but to me both of them are on the same level - either you tolerate their talking or just mentally block it out of your mind and focus on letting them lead you in the exercises.Overall - this is an average workout DVD and I feel like they are trying to mislead you with the ""Yoga Blast"" title just to get you to spend your money because it mentions the word ""yoga"" when really very little of it has to do with yoga. There's nothing particularly special about any of it - it's just average, which is why I gave it 3 stars.",3,it's okay but title is misleading,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,2065,"['One', 'reasons', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'was', 'wife', 'was', 'looking', 'exercise', 'video', 'figured', 'could', 'use', 'one', 'geared', 'mainly', 'women', 'most', 'things', 'exercise', 'exercise', 'right', 'First', 'thing', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'yoga', 'video', 'so', 'why', 'called', 'Yoga', 'Blast', 'have', 'think', 'are', 'trying', 'capitalize', 'popularity', 'yoga', 'set', 'apart', 'numerous', 'other', 'exercise', 'one', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'terms', 'workout.What', 'initially', 'noticed', 'when', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'how', 'revealing', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'outfit', 'leaving', 'little', 'imagination', 'What', 'funny', 'next', 'day', 'articles', 'appeared', 'news', 'how', 'Lululemon', 'recalled', 'yoga', 'are', 'too', 'sheer', 'revealing', 'gave', 'good', 'laugh', 'was', 'thinking', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'assistant', 'Joan', 'must', 'be', 'wearing', 'Lululemon', 'gear', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'tight.The', 'exercise', 'are', 'beneficial', 'find', 'be', 'too', 'difficult', 'least', 'now', 'are', 'three', 'different', 'routines', 'DVD', 'overall', 'provide', 'well-rounded', 'workout', 'have', 'time', 'go', 'instructors', 'do', 'awful', 'lot', 'talking', 'hardly', 'silence', 'talking', 'helpful', ""'d"", 'say', 'first', 'time', 'lot', 'useful', 'information', 'then', 'do', 'routines', 'regularly', 'be', 'tiresome', 'reviewer', 'found', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'be', 'particularly', 'annoying', 'are', 'same', 'level', 'tolerate', 'talking', 'just', 'mentally', 'block', 'mind', 'focus', 'letting', 'lead', 'exercises.Overall', 'average', 'workout', 'DVD', 'feel', 'are', 'trying', 'mislead', 'Yoga', 'Blast', 'title', 'just', 'get', 'spend', 'money', 'word', 'yoga', 'when', 'really', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'yoga', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'special', 'just', 'average', 'why', 'gave', '3', 'stars']",DR.

Those who purchase her work out DVD looking for yoga are going to find that they've been scammed and ripped off. This is not a yoga workout.The DVD is a mix of some workout techniques, yoga included. ""Dr."" Lisa's assistant, Elise Joan (who does most of the talking) includes a few goddesses in the first two sections. I found her approach to goddess to be similar to pilates or another form of workout, not yoga.The third section of this workout is the most yoga heavy, a term I use hesitantly. You're lead through a few basic sun salutations and a few other poses, all while ""Dr."" Lisa talks on and on about how wonderful the sequence is.It's apparent that yoga is not at the forefront of this workout. Much of it is done while Lisa and Elise are wearing sneakers, a clear sign that this is not yoga. They're terrible at sequencing the poses and the viewer is basically left to determine what angle is right for them. Lisa also through the term meditation around quite frequently as if just saying it made a difference. As an instructor, I would never assume that students should merely do what I was doing with regards to yoga. People with different body types than Lisa or Elise could potentially harm themselves.People looking for yoga should look elsewhere. This workout DVD isn't a terrible workout DVD. But I will not give any more than a one star rating to something that put yoga twice on its cover, presumably just to cash in on the recent surge in popularity.

I actually have such little sense of beat and coordination I was asked to leave a zumba class, so I hope that frames this review for you. I have to say this work out is nothing new and really not very challenging at all. It's broken up into 3 sections, so I have individually reviewed each section:Section 1-Cardio (21 minutes of the workout): It starts off SUPER slow and a lot of step-taps, walk forward, backwards, etc. Nothing here is new and it sorts got my heart rate up, but wasn't much of a challenge and I didn't sweat at all.Section 2-Strength (22 minutes of the workout): This section is slow b/c that's actually how strength training works the best, but they do  A LOT of ""breaks"" during this time which, for me killed the workout.  It's really a lot of squats and hip swivels, just variations of them.Section 3-Power Stretch (20 minutes of the workout): This section is exactly what it sounds like, stretches and it pulls a lot of positions from basic yoga.  It does work, I felt nicely stretched and the fact that they move SO SLOWLY through everything is actually beneficial in this section b/c you need to take time to really get a good stretch.In total, it's not much of a workout, but it is better than not doing anything at all. Even if you're a novice, this workout will not challenge you for long b/c it's so basic and slow.This is just a side note (something I found annoying, please don't put bad comments for me saying this, I'm a woman too) I HATED looking at Dr. Lisa's HUGE fake boobs during the entire workout-she is squeezed into this tight workout shirt and they just look like they are trying to escape, so I found it distracting and a bit annoying when she actually said at one point during the workout that if you do this stretch you won't need a face lift or plastic surgery to look great...REALLY?! come on! I get that in workout videos people want to look good and trendy and all that, but put those things away, no one is buying you a drink in their living room today!On a good note, the trainer she works with was great!

Porter,"[1, 1]","After having my baby I started into the Sparkpeople bootcamp... doing their easy 10 minute workouts with some additional cardio of my own during the week; tracking my calories and losing weight.  But at some point I built up and found the workouts easy. This dvd is PERFECT for the next level.  It was a bit challenging and exposed me to even more general workout moves that allowed me to eventually go up to Turbofire and REALLY get in shape.  So I definitely recommend it to those who have started out in very easy workouts and need a level up; but find many of the typical workout programs to be too much.  I also used it after I got pregnant again and found the Turbofire ones impossible as I got further along.  It doesn't kill you but you do get a good workout done!Also, it's great time-wise.  After doing Turbofire and getting fatigued with all the time needed (hey, I'm an ultra busy mom with 8 kids... who has an hour each evening?!), it was nice to have this program to fall back on in case I didn't have all the time in the world to workout that evening after the kids were in bed.  It's about 20 minutes per session, and there are 3 sessions on the dvd.  So this again, makes it a perfect step up from the Sparkpeople bootcamp... just a little extra time each day.My complain about it is that it's advertising it as a Dr. Lisa workout but she's not the trainer, she's basically the participant.  Also, it's nothing fancy or interesting and it's NOT all yoga.  It's a wide range of various workout moves and has one section that is yoga.  I don't have an issue with any of this because it was perfect for what I needed; but I could see how some would be irritated that it's not exactly what they are describing it.

1586944,AB0Y33G717HOU,B009904NLY,nsv,"[0, 0]","Well, that's what I would have called this DVD.  It's got three workouts, about 20 minutes each: Cardio, Strength, and Power Stretch.  The workouts are led by Elise Joan, ""a nationally certified health and wellness instructor"" who ""has appeared as a featured fitness expert on ABC, E!, and CBS, among many others"".  She's unremarkable, but OK.  Support is offered by Dr. Lisa Masterson, who is always ready with appropriate keywords to give the pop science reasons for each exercise.  Her particular skill seems to be the ability to fill out a sports bra.The Power Stretch workout is the only one that sort of resembles Yoga.  The occasional Vinyasa and ""down dog"" appear in the middle of the other workouts.  Those workouts borrow dance moves, using ballet-ish exercises and ""hip-hop"" moves, which seems to be the phrase used to describe shaking the butt.  Cardio is big on step-touch and butt-shaking, while Strength is full of isometric-y exercises augmented with... yeah, butt shaking and hip circles.It seems like Elise Joan has modified elements of ballet and low-impact aerobics and added a dash of yoga, and called it a ""total body yoga workout"".  Joan's form is better than Dr. Lisa, so it's good that Joan is the one who sometimes alternates between beginner and advanced moves.Dr. Lisa provides motivation like ""This is the best medicine you can take!"" and ""After you do this, nobody needs any plastic surgery, you'll have that unique physique that everybody's looking for.""  And she REALLY likes that Warrior.The music is really, really average.  The settings are very nice to look at.  The volume on my DVD is unusually low.  I have to remember to turn the sound way down after watching this DVD, or the next thing I watch is loud enough to scare my cat and my neighbors.  (I found that out the hard way.)I've really let my workouts slide, so I am... um... not in great shape.  I can still do all these workouts without breaking a sweat.  I sometimes do the Cardio workout as a warm up, or the Power Stretch workout to cool down.  I haven't used the Strength exercise after the first try.

1586945,A32HAMICRE52M,B009904NLY,Pippa Lee,"[0, 0]","I don't make New Year's exercise resolutions, but comes January, I somehow end up trying a new workout. This time I picked Dr. Lisa's Yoga Blast because it promises ""total-body yoga workout with blasts of strength and cardio.""Dr. Lisa's Yoga Blast is made out of three workouts: cardio (21 minutes), strength (22 minutes) and power stretch (20 minutes).  You can mix your workouts but there is no matrix in the DVD to allow you to preset the workouts in the order you want. Instead, you just select one, do it and go back to the main menu to start the next workout you desire.The Cardio workout is a combination of hip-hop and ballet-inspired moves with a yoga vinyasa in between the low impact cardio segments.  You need enough space to take at least 4 steps forward and back and two large side steps to the right and left.  Dr. Lisa works out along with her trainer, Elise Joan. Elise is a very likeable instructor. She shows correct form and describes the moves while Dr. Lisa adds in information about the benefits that we all reap from exercising. The thing I like about the cardio segment is that I did not have to memorize the steps.  It is not a dance routine that builds up from previous steps.  Instead, you are doing a couple of moves then, the vinyasa followed by new moves.  The vinyasa starts with a standing forward bend, moving to plank pose, doing chaturanga (push-up), and flowing into upward facing dog and then downward facing dog.  Towards the end of the workout, Dr. Lisa and Elise add a quick mountain climbing move to the plank pose.For the Strength workout, you will need a chair for balance. In this segment, Elise and Dr. Lisa concentrate on the lower body.  They start by doing plies, squats with hip circles, leg swings, and lunges.  As in the cardio session, they do vinyasas in between repetitions. The yoga-inspired moves in this section are comprised by a warrior sequence, chair pose with twists and what they called dancing chair, which is to swing one's arms back and forth while being in chair pose.Some of the exercises included in the Power Stretch workout are sun salutations, ballet side stretches, chair pose balancing on one leg, pigeon and double pigeon poses, a variation of boat pose with cycling legs, and abdominal curls. This last workout was supposed to be the most yoga-like of the three, meaning it should have stressed breathing and meditation.  However, for me, this workout did not put me in a meditative mood at all.  Thorough the two previous workouts, Dr. Lisa and Elise have been talkative and I did not mind that then.  But in the Power Stretch, their chatting started to grate on my nerves.  Where there should have been silence to allow the viewers to focus and practice mindfulness while being in a pose, the two women just kept talking to the point of distraction.Thorough all three workouts, Dr. Lisa reminds viewers to work at their own pace, to do what they can and don't get hurt.  Elise Joan's form is definitely something to aim for. But I like Dr. Lisa too because she is the reality of what the rest of us look like when doing these exercises: arms a little bent, legs not quite extended.  Having said that, viewers should watch Elise for correct form.  If you have injured knees or sensitive knees like I do, be aware that doing deep squats with the heels off the floor while circling one's hips may make your knees say ""ouch.""  Some hip-hop moves in the cardio section that require throwing out the hips and twisting a leg aggravated my knees too, which is why the cardio segment is not one I plan to revisit often even though it is not a strenuous one.

The first 2 sessions are mostly some very light stretching and jumping around, with an occasional downward dog pose thrown in. In one segment they hold on to a chair and do things that look like ballet barre work more than anything. The last session does a bit more yoga, but it isn't that great.The most distracting thing about the whole disc is that Dr. Lisa's yoga tops are about 3 sizes too small. The whole time you keep thinking her enormous breasts are going to pop out any minute! Come on! I guess men might enjoy this aspect, but I found it very unprofessional.

Dr. Lisa says in her intro, that you will crave this workout more than candy.  Both practioners look as green as the ferns in the background.  All I could keep thinking was I have a craving for broccoli.  My biggest qualm with this DVD is that it is called ""Dr. Lisa Yoga Blast"", but she looks more like an awkward student then an instructor.  If you are going to put your name and face on the DVD, you ought to have a certain mastery of the workout and flexibility.  Throughout the workout Dr. Lisa glances to the instructor as if to see what the form is, etc.  Dr. Lisa's movement is awkward, clumsy, and wobbly at times.  Again, I would have no problem with this if she was not marketing this as ""her"" DVD.  The instructor, Elise Joan does know what she is doing and practices proper yoga form.  Dr. Lisa's constant chatter throughout the DVD is also annoying and superfluous.  I don't need to hear that you can do this at your desk, over, and over, and over again.  It also seem like she was trying to interject medical knowledge, but not really helpful knowledge like ""regulating breathing helps your heart rate and blood pressure"".  OK...""and this helps prevent diseases, regulates, blood flow"", etc.  Again, I have no problems with sharing this information, but it could be shared just as easily during the introduction to the DVD rather than incessantly throughout the workout resulting in superfluous chatter.These three 20 minute sections seem like they are meant to be done separately, rather than all together.  They all seem to have sun salutations and the third section (Power Stretch), I believe is a cut and paste from the second (Strength, which is really yoga as well).The CARDIO section is ""meh"".  Nothing special.  A lot of side to side movements with knee lifts.  The Hip Hop moves are fun and have several slow repetitions before speeding up.  Dr. Lisa looked awkward like she was constantly looking at the instructor.  The yoga poses were really there for cardio and strength.  There was not a lot of focus on breadth or alignment in this section.  I would have really appreciated more focus on these given the title.The STRENGTH section is really yoga, sun salutations with little cueing.  Dr. Lisa talks about how breathing helps with medical conditions, but never really talks about how to use yogic breadth within the pose.  I really was feeling I preferred Dr. Lisa not to be there and just the instructor.  I did not feel she added any value other than being a talking student going on and on about health benefits of yoga.  Her flexibility was poor, form awkward, and she seemed wobbly at times.  Her pigeon pose form was not good at all.  I have no problem with this as long as you talk about making modifications for those students who may be less flexible and then demonstrating it.  For example, if you are less flexible, you can put a towel or blanket underneath your hips.The POWER STRETCH Dr. Lisa calls ""meditation in motion"".  However, it seemed like it was a cut and paste, or at least repeat of exercises from the STRENGTH section.All and all, if the green tinge doesn't bother you and you are a fan of Dr. Lisa, and you watch the instructor for proper form, this is an ""o.k."" workout.  In my opinion this DVD would have been better if it were just the instructor and there are many other better quality yoga DVD's out for the money with better cuing and instructions on alignment and breadth.

They don't cue the movements well and even sort of joke about if you're not getting it it's okay just *move*.  Not cool. It's especially evident on the 'vinyasa' moments--a term they use very loosely to mean 'let's do like 2 semi kind of sort of yoga moves and then get back to the low impact aerobics' in the first section.  Hey, when your audience is in downward dog, they need some cue when to move and to what!  And for a video that has yoga in the title, the yoga is actually very thinly represented.You think you're getting a video of three yoga workouts, right? No. You get a cardio workout, a body weight muscle building workout and a stretching workout, with options to play them all at once or pick one.Doctor Lisa.  She is a terrible person to be in a workout video. There, I said it. Her form is awful for many of the moves, showing no concentration or focus on form.  Form is everything for many movements, both for effectiveness and safety.  I thought at first she was going to model, you know, beginner variations for people who want a slightly less intense workout, but no.  Her form during pushups in particular was appalling: locked out elbows, lowering her belly more than her shoulders, just everything you do not want in a proper pushup.She also has a really unhealthy obsession with surgery.  I've never had a workout instructor in a video talk at all about not needing plastic surgery, but she mentions it at least five times. It made me think I wasn't the demographic for this video: I want a workout I can do that will help me be healthy and fit.  Plastic surgery has never been on my horizon. Hearing this woman almost neurotically mention surgery at least once per workout got a little disturbing. It made me wonder how much she's already had, which is not a thought you should have about your 'doctor' workout instructor.It's a shame, because Elise, the one who made the workout, actually tries really hard to make a challenging workout (the second one, I think, though, is not for beginners!) but Dr Lisa keeps trying to upstage her by talking. All the time. Inane chatter that was driving me *nuts* the very first watch.

1586958,A2OG83SEU9HL6D,B009904NLY,"Shannon B Davis ""Nepenthe""","[15, 16]","The video is led by Joan, a fitness instructor, and Dr. Lisa.  It contains three sections, cardio, strength, and stretch.  Both strength and stretch contained some yoga movements.  Stretch also contained some pilates movements.  Each section has a long talking introduction from Dr. Lisa and if you want to get your heart rate up, you might as well use that time to get your mat laid out and your sports bra on.I wasn't thrilled with this video.  First of all, the name is a complete misnomer.  It should be called ""Dance Blast"". It's more of a dance workout.  I couldn't make it through the cardio section because I have better things to do with my time.  It seemed like a lot of dance as I fast-forwarded through it.  I did go through the entire strength section, which included some barre movements, a very strange hip circle sequence (coming from a bellydancer's perspective, no less).  I have some concerns that the deep plie shown here wasn't described deeply enough to protect the knees of inexperienced exercisers (at whom this video must be aimed) who wouldn't know how to align their knees with their toes, and the deep knee plies can be painful if not done properly.  The barre movements (the attitudes) was fun for me.  Then we got into the yoga. I've been doing hot yoga several times a week, so I followed along with the sun salutations easily.  Any movements requiring any kind of balance was shown with a chair, for people who don't have balance. Of course, if you have experience with yoga, you would dispense with the chair during your Warrior IIIs.  I did.  The yoga moves were modified into strength moves, with leg lifts during Warrior III.  Interestingly, the yoga movements were not described in any way.  One would think in a video that is so obviously geared to the beginner exerciser (as I gathered from the introduction), they would have talked through these poses. Upward dog is a challenging pose that one should first work through cobra to advance into.  I could see that even Dr. Lisa didn't always have the correct form.  You won't get the benefits without the proper form.This video is very much geared towards women with the pitter-patter about bodies.  I was a bit annoyed when hip circles were described as sexy and good for the bedroom.  When I'm exercising, I'm doing it to be strong, and to feel good in my body. I'm not doing it for someone else, to make other people find me appealing.  Maybe that's the motivation for some people - but honestly I don't think that's a healthy relationship with your body if the only reason you're taking care of it is to be appealing to the opposite sex.What I really HATED about this video was the constant chatter. It sometimes seemed like Joan, the actual fitness instructor, was cheerily annoyed at Dr. Lisa's constant blather.  Nonstop - you couldn't focus on your downward dog without hearing Dr. Lisa talking about how good exercise is for you, how good it is for your mind, and how you won't need plastic surgery if you do this.  First of all, the last part is something of a lie.  Well, I don't believe ANYONE needs plastic surgery.  However, exercise will never give you someone else's body.  It can give you your own best body.  On the other hand, this video is not at all a physical challenge and only for the most out-of-shape person would it provide enough of a fitness challenge to change their body significantly.I figure this Dr. Lisa must be some kind of celebrity. I've never heard of her.  She didn't have the greatest form in the exercises, but I wouldn't have minded having her so much if she would have shut her mouth once in a while.I did like the fitness instructor.  I would love to check out a more serious video with JUST HER.  She has great form and a nice voice.  I like some of the movements she chose out of barre and yoga to include here for strengthening.Bottom line, if you're interested in yoga, get a real yoga video.  If you're interested in pilates or dance or barre, get a real video.  This is a ""dabbler"" video.  I can't endorse it in any way, shape, or form, except for people who enjoy Dr. Lisa's dialogue and want to work out to the sound of her voice.Let me tell you my qualifications for reviewing this video. I have been using fitness videos for almost two decades now, and I have taken fitness classes for most of my life.  I have been dancing for ten years, and doing yoga for about the same amount of time.  Typically, I like Jillian Michael's fitness videos, Shiva Rea for yoga, and lots and lots of dance videos.",1,"everything I hate about ""fitness videos""",1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,4539,"['video', 'led', 'Joan', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'three', 'sections', 'cardio', 'strength', 'stretch', 'strength', 'stretch', 'contained', 'yoga', 'movements', 'Stretch', 'also', 'contained', 'pilates', 'movements', 'section', 'long', 'talking', 'introduction', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'want', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'get', 'mat', 'laid', 'sports', 'bra', 'on.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'thrilled', 'video', 'First', 'all', 'name', 'complete', 'misnomer', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Dance', 'Blast', 'more', 'dance', 'workout', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'cardio', 'section', 'have', 'better', 'things', 'do', 'time', 'seemed', 'lot', 'dance', 'fast-forwarded', 'did', 'go', 'entire', 'strength', 'section', 'included', 'barre', 'movements', 'very', 'strange', 'hip', 'circle', 'sequence', 'coming', 'bellydancer', 'perspective', 'less', 'have', 'concerns', 'deep', 'plie', 'shown', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'described', 'deeply', 'enough', 'protect', 'knees', 'inexperienced', 'exercisers', 'whom', 'video', 'must', 'be', 'aimed', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'align', 'knees', 'toes', 'deep', 'knee', 'plies', 'can', 'be', 'painful', 'not', 'done', 'properly', 'barre', 'movements', 'attitudes', 'was', 'fun', 'Then', 'got', 'yoga', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'hot', 'yoga', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'followed', 'sun', 'salutations', 'easily', 'Any', 'movements', 'requiring', 'kind', 'balance', 'was', 'shown', 'chair', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'balance', 'course', 'have', 'experience', 'yoga', 'would', 'dispense', 'chair', 'Warrior', 'IIIs', 'did', 'yoga', 'moves', 'were', 'modified', 'strength', 'moves', 'leg', 'lifts', 'Warrior', 'III', 'Interestingly', 'yoga', 'movements', 'were', 'not', 'described', 'way', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'video', 'so', 'obviously', 'geared', 'beginner', 'exerciser', 'gathered', 'introduction', 'would', 'have', 'talked', 'poses', 'Upward', 'dog', 'challenging', 'pose', 'one', 'should', 'first', 'work', 'through', 'cobra', 'advance', 'could', 'see', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'correct', 'form', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'benefits', 'proper', 'form.This', 'video', 'very', 'much', 'geared', 'towards', 'women', 'pitter-patter', 'bodies', 'was', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'when', 'hip', 'circles', 'were', 'described', 'sexy', 'good', 'bedroom', 'When', ""'m"", 'exercising', ""'m"", 'doing', 'be', 'strong', 'feel', 'good', 'body', ""'m"", 'not', 'doing', 'someone', 'else', 'make', 'other', 'people', 'find', 'appealing', 'Maybe', 'motivation', 'people', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'body', 'only', 'reason', ""'re"", 'taking', 'care', 'be', 'appealing', 'opposite', 'sex.What', 'really', 'HATED', 'video', 'was', 'constant', 'chatter', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'like', 'Joan', 'actual', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'was', 'cheerily', 'annoyed', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'constant', 'blather', 'Nonstop', 'could', ""n't"", 'focus', 'downward', 'dog', 'hearing', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'talking', 'how', 'good', 'exercise', 'how', 'good', 'mind', 'how', 'wo', ""n't"", 'need', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'do', 'First', 'all', 'last', 'part', 'something', 'lie', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ANYONE', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'However', 'exercise', 'will', 'never', 'give', 'someone', 'else', 'body', 'can', 'give', 'own', 'best', 'body', 'other', 'hand', 'video', 'not', 'physical', 'challenge', 'only', 'most', 'out-of-shape', 'person', 'would', 'provide', 'enough', 'fitness', 'challenge', 'change', 'body', 'significantly.I', 'figure', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'must', 'be', 'kind', 'celebrity', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'greatest', 'form', 'exercises', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'shut', 'mouth', 'once', 'while.I', 'did', 'fitness', 'instructor', 'would', 'love', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'serious', 'video', 'JUST', 'HER', 'great', 'form', 'nice', 'voice', 'like', 'movements', 'chose', 'barre', 'yoga', 'include', 'here', 'strengthening.Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'interested', 'yoga', 'get', 'real', 'yoga', 'video', ""'re"", 'interested', 'pilates', 'dance', 'barre', 'get', 'real', 'video', 'dabbler', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'endorse', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'dialogue', 'want', 'work', 'out', 'sound', 'voice.Let', 'tell', 'qualifications', 'reviewing', 'video', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'fitness', 'videos', 'almost', 'two', 'decades', 'now', 'have', 'taken', 'fitness', 'classes', 'most', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'dancing', 'ten', 'years', 'doing', 'yoga', 'same', 'amount', 'time', 'Typically', 'like', 'Jillian', 'Michael', 'fitness', 'videos', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'yoga', 'lots', 'lots', 'dance', 'videos']",DR.

The cardio section consists of lots of flailing, the strength section is more flailing with some wiggling added in, and the power stretch section is the closest you get to some very imprecise and ungraceful yoga.  Yoga moves should be slow and controlled, not sloppy.This was a very disappointing DVD.  I would most definitely not recommend it.

1586965,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,B009904NLY,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""","[1, 1]","I was at something of a loss for roughly the first 2/3rds of this vid.  It's entitled ""Yoga Blast"" but I wasn't seeing the yoga.  I was seeing a lot of dancing for sure, which is almost the exact opposite of yoga.  Finally, though, the power stretching stuff in the final segment introduced yoga poses.  I'm not going to go into the different uses of yoga; everyone has their own opinion of it.  This is strictly yoga for toning and stretching.  In spite of Dr Lisa's contention that this is mediation, it's not.Which brings me to Dr. Lisa.  She never shuts up.  Throughout the whole video she yammers on about oooh doesn't that feel good? and We're preventing breast cancer by doing these moves, and a lot of other blather that over-simplifies the connection between movement and health.  I think her point might better have been served by letting the instructor instruct, and talking about the link between exercise and both physical and emotional health in a separate segment.  It'd be less distracting and you'd only have to listen to it once to get the info.  Dr. Lisa, by the way, is a Gynecologist.  She doesn't appear to have any special sports or fitness-related medical knowledge.As for the exercises themselves, they're decent enough.  I cringed a little whenever a move was touted as ""sexy"" or was implied to be something that will improve your bedroom performance.  Again, it's all part of the distracting quality of the chatter.  It didn't make me feel like I wanted to work out, it made me feel like I was in a workout class with women who talked so much I wasn't getting the instructions.There are some extras on the DVD, excerpts from a ballet-style workout and a kettlebell workout.  Basically adverts for more vids from this company.I think there are far better workouts on the market, and many better yoga vids you can choose from.",3,Where's the yoga?,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1851,"['was', 'something', 'loss', 'roughly', 'first', '2/3rds', 'vid', 'entitled', 'Yoga', 'Blast', 'was', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'yoga', 'was', 'seeing', 'lot', 'dancing', 'sure', 'almost', 'exact', 'opposite', 'yoga', 'Finally', 'though', 'power', 'stretching', 'stuff', 'final', 'segment', 'introduced', 'yoga', 'poses', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'different', 'uses', 'yoga', 'everyone', 'own', 'opinion', 'strictly', 'yoga', 'toning', 'stretching', 'spite', 'Dr', 'Lisa', 'contention', 'mediation', 'not.Which', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'never', 'shuts', 'up', 'whole', 'video', 'oooh', ""n't"", 'that', 'feel', 'good', ""'re"", 'preventing', 'breast', 'cancer', 'doing', 'moves', 'lot', 'other', 'blather', 'connection', 'movement', 'health', 'think', 'point', 'might', 'better', 'have', 'been', 'served', 'letting', 'instructor', 'instruct', 'talking', 'link', 'exercise', 'physical', 'emotional', 'health', 'separate', 'segment', ""'d"", 'be', 'less', 'distracting', ""'d"", 'only', 'have', 'listen', 'once', 'get', 'info', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'way', 'Gynecologist', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'special', 'sports', 'fitness-related', 'medical', 'knowledge.As', 'exercises', ""'re"", 'decent', 'enough', 'cringed', 'little', 'whenever', 'move', 'was', 'touted', 'sexy', 'was', 'implied', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'improve', 'bedroom', 'performance', 'Again', 'part', 'distracting', 'quality', 'chatter', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'wanted', 'work', 'out', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'workout', 'class', 'women', 'who', 'talked', 'so', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'getting', 'instructions.There', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'ballet-style', 'workout', 'kettlebell', 'workout', 'Basically', 'more', 'vids', 'company.I', 'think', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'workouts', 'market', 'many', 'better', 'yoga', 'can', 'choose']",DR.

1586966,A3MUSWDCTZINQZ,B009904NLY,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""","[1, 1]","I tried to enjoy this workout as much as the Kundalini ones I have used in the past, likeKundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond.  I would recommend that over this one because of these observations:1) I am not sure what this video is trying to be.  It's trying to be sort of hip-hop, but ballet...yet yoga?2) There isn't much emphasis on yoga, more dance...the Kundalini one focuses on breathing, mantras, etc3) Too much talk about the bedroom here, Ana Bret, though in minimal yoga clothing, still appeals more.4) Encouraging talk occurs on both DVDs, but I find the Yoga Blast sounds fake at times.  The Kundalini has quiet times too.5) I am against the ""scenery"" type yoga workouts and the Kundalini ones are in a white room, helps a bit more for meditation6) The workouts seem awkward.Overall, I would recommend this to someone who wants some easy dance based workouts...if they want to do it with the sound down.  If not, I would recommend the above Kundalini Yoga DVD and others likeDance the Chakras Yoga Workout - Ana Brett & Ravi Singh ***With the New MATRIX Menu Option***if you like dance but also want a bit of meditation and mantra in your workouts andWarrior Workout: Kundalini Yogaif you want something advanced, though the DVDs have several options were you can gear the workouts to beginning to advanced levels.",3,I prefer the Kundalini Yoga DVDs over this,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,1326,"['tried', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'as', 'much', 'Kundalini', 'ones', 'have', 'used', 'past', 'likeKundalini', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'Beyond', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'observations:1', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'video', 'trying', 'be', 'trying', 'be', 'sort', 'hip-hop', 'ballet', 'yet', 'yoga', '2', ""n't"", 'much', 'emphasis', 'yoga', 'more', 'dance', 'Kundalini', 'one', 'breathing', 'mantras', 'etc3', 'Too', 'much', 'talk', 'bedroom', 'here', 'Ana', 'Bret', 'minimal', 'yoga', 'clothing', 'still', 'appeals', 'more.4', 'Encouraging', 'talk', 'DVDs', 'find', 'Yoga', 'Blast', 'fake', 'times', 'Kundalini', 'quiet', 'times', 'too.5', 'am', 'scenery', 'type', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'Kundalini', 'ones', 'are', 'white', 'room', 'bit', 'more', 'meditation6', 'workouts', 'seem', 'awkward.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'someone', 'who', 'easy', 'dance', 'based', 'workouts', 'want', 'do', 'sound', 'down', 'not', 'would', 'recommend', 'above', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'others', 'likeDance', 'Chakras', 'Yoga', 'Workout', 'Ana', 'Brett', 'Ravi', 'Singh', '***With', 'New', 'MATRIX', 'Menu', 'Option***if', 'like', 'dance', 'also', 'want', 'bit', 'meditation', 'mantra', 'workouts', 'andWarrior', 'Kundalini', 'Yogaif', 'want', 'something', 'advanced', 'DVDs', 'have', 'several', 'options', 'were', 'can', 'gear', 'workouts', 'beginning', 'advanced', 'levels']",DR.
