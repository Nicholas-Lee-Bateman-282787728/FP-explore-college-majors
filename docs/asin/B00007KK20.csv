730185,A15S44J4NHU4LS,B00007KK20,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[30, 34]","Zaza is a 31 year old Ph.D. student in Philosophy.  His parents want him to get married soon.  To this end, they've arrange meetings for their son to get acquainted with girls of Georgian descent.  A successful match to them would be a substantially younger virgin Georgian girl.  However, Zaza has his sights set on someone else.  He is in love with a 34 year old divorcee named Judith (she also has a daughter).  To Zaza's parents, Judith is damaged goods and a relationship between their son and her is a disgrace.  They then take extreme measures to make sure this relationship ends.  One night, the entire extended family pays a visit to her.  Zaza's uncle threatens to kill her if she doesn't get out of Zaza's life.  His father revokes Zaza's credit card and threatens to stop providing financial support for him to complete his education.  Judith understands that it will be impossible for her and Zaza to be together (although she repeatedly prays for his love to burn only for her).  So she takes the more mature approach (which later brings Zaza's mother to tears) and calls it off with Zaza.  In a very poignant scene the day after the accostal, Zaza's mother comes back to talk to Judith (and also brings a large stuffed animal for the daughter as a conciliatory gesture).  They talk and Judith accepts her judgment putting Zaza's mother to shame.  ""She's a good girl"" according to the mother.  Now Zaza has no choice but to choose a wife (he picked a pretty one I might add) and marry her.  During the reception, he tries to cause a scene.  In a very clever stroke of scripting, the tables are turned on him and we are left to assume that life goes on and another generation of fixed-marriage remains intact.To me this film is very powerful and raw in what it's trying to achieve.  The director wants us to see, in all its gory/gratuitous details, what Israeli life is like.  There are no smoke and mirrors, no time lapses.  What you see is what you get, and it really makes a statement to the audience.  When I was watching the film, particularly during the sex scene, I was thinking ""What an honest, realistic, raw way to portray real life!""  And that's what this film is all made with - honesty.So before you go on expecting this film to be a Hollywood love story, I suggest you ask yourself whether you are ready to handle a two-hour cultural immersion into the Israeli life.  If so, watch it.  If not, go watch something more lighthearted like My Big Fat Greek Wedding.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3.5 (bare-bones dialogue but appropriate for the tone being set)E (Erotica) - 5 (includes a very realistic/raw sex scene)A (Action) - 0 (n/a)P (Plot) - 4 (31 yr. old Israeli male in love with an older divorcee, but parents force him to look for a younger, unmarried wife)",5,A story told the way it is...,1031443200,"09 8, 2002",2002,2830,"['Zaza', '31', 'year', 'old', 'Ph.D.', 'student', 'Philosophy', 'parents', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'soon', 'end', ""'ve"", 'arrange', 'meetings', 'son', 'get', 'acquainted', 'girls', 'Georgian', 'descent', 'successful', 'match', 'would', 'be', 'substantially', 'younger', 'virgin', 'Georgian', 'girl', 'However', 'Zaza', 'sights', 'set', 'someone', 'else', 'love', '34', 'year', 'old', 'divorcee', 'named', 'Judith', 'also', 'daughter', 'Zaza', 'parents', 'Judith', 'damaged', 'goods', 'relationship', 'son', 'disgrace', 'then', 'take', 'extreme', 'measures', 'make', 'sure', 'relationship', 'One', 'night', 'entire', 'extended', 'family', 'visit', 'Zaza', 'uncle', 'kill', ""n't"", 'get', 'Zaza', 'life', 'father', 'Zaza', 'credit', 'card', 'stop', 'providing', 'financial', 'support', 'complete', 'education', 'Judith', 'will', 'be', 'impossible', 'Zaza', 'be', 'together', 'repeatedly', 'love', 'burn', 'only', 'more', 'mature', 'approach', 'later', 'Zaza', 'mother', 'tears', 'off', 'Zaza', 'very', 'poignant', 'scene', 'day', 'accostal', 'Zaza', 'mother', 'back', 'talk', 'Judith', 'also', 'large', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'daughter', 'conciliatory', 'gesture', 'talk', 'Judith', 'judgment', 'putting', 'Zaza', 'mother', 'shame', 'good', 'girl', 'according', 'mother', 'Now', 'Zaza', 'choice', 'choose', 'wife', 'picked', 'pretty', 'one', 'might', 'add', 'reception', 'cause', 'scene', 'very', 'clever', 'stroke', 'scripting', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'are', 'left', 'assume', 'life', 'generation', 'fixed-marriage', 'remains', 'intact.To', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'raw', 'what', 'trying', 'achieve', 'director', 'see', 'gory/gratuitous', 'details', 'what', 'Israeli', 'life', 'are', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'time', 'What', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'really', 'statement', 'audience', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'particularly', 'sex', 'scene', 'was', 'thinking', 'What', 'honest', 'realistic', 'raw', 'way', 'portray', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'film', 'made', 'honesty.So', 'go', 'expecting', 'film', 'be', 'Hollywood', 'love', 'story', 'suggest', 'ask', 'are', 'ready', 'handle', 'two-hour', 'cultural', 'immersion', 'Israeli', 'life', 'so', 'watch', 'not', 'go', 'watch', 'something', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding.LEAP', 'rating', '5', '============================L', 'Language', '3.5', 'bare-bones', 'dialogue', 'appropriate', 'tone', 'being', 'set', 'E', 'Erotica', '5', 'very', 'realistic/raw', 'sex', 'scene', 'A', 'Action', '0', 'n/a', 'P', 'Plot', '4', '31', 'yr.', 'old', 'Israeli', 'male', 'love', 'older', 'divorcee', 'parents', 'force', 'look', 'younger', 'unmarried', 'wife']",Late Marriage VHS

But according to this bittersweet comedy, the tradition is alive and well, at least among the conservative Georgian Jewish community in Israel the movie is set on (director Kashashivili belongs to that community). The protagonist of the movie is Zaza, an unmarried man in his early thirties and graduate student in philosophy (played by the fine actor Lior Ashkenazi, who starred as the brutal Mossad agent in another great Israeli movie, Walk on Water). His concerned family shows him young, attractive, and eligible girls, but he resists them all - since he already has a secret love affair with Judith, a sexually liberated mother and divorc&eacute;e. Zaza knows his extended family would never accept Judith; but when they find out, the results are worse than you can imagine. Let just say, quoting one critic, that joining the Foreign Legion is probably preferable than living with such family.

730187,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00007KK20,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I remember when I first saw `Late Marriage' (which wasn't all that long ago, to be quite honest).  It have me chills.  I literally had goosebumps running down my arms.  The reason is not the message or the story in itself but more the brutally honest way that it is told.  There is something so organic about this film; so lived in and real and emotionally consuming.  Every moment feels like a home reel, and that is almost unprecedented today.  That isn't to say that there is a cheapness about the film, for it never once feels poorly conceived or shot, but the scenes are allowed to linger long enough for them to feel truly lived in.  They feel authentic.  The script is written in such a way that it allows the actors to delve inside these characters and express themselves with an authenticity that is demanded with a theme so complicated.And complicated it is.The film is basically two parts.  One is a modern take on a love story.  You have a single man entering his thirties who is in love with a divorced woman slightly his elder who has a daughter of her own.  On the outset this wouldn't seem so `odd', but when you factor in the deeply rooted religious feelings of this man's family then you have an affair that carries itself in secret while this young man, Zaza, weighs out the consequences of establishing his relationship with this woman, Judith, any deeper.  He wants to make her his wife, but that would result in turmoil.  His family is insistent that he wed, but a young girl (untouched), and his marriage to a divorced woman would bring shame on him and his family.  That is where the second part comes into play.  When you get passed the love story you come to a familial story of loyalty and honor; of tradition and expectations.  The relationship between Zaza and his parents is an interesting one that is easily dismissed as unhealthy and unrealistic by those who don't `understand' where they are coming from, but viewing this film with an open mind (and heart) will allow you to appreciate that it is abnormally normal in the light in which it is developed.When those two parts collide, `Late Marriage' becomes genius.The performances here are wonderfully complex and beautifully fleshed out by the entire cast.  Lior Ashkenazi transcends mere acting here.  He becomes Zaza and breaks down the core of the man.  He is so natural in every scene, regardless of what he's expected to do (be a son, be a father, be a lover, be a man) that he instantly becomes not only relatable, but unforgettable.  Matching him almost every step of the way is the beautiful Ronit Elkabetz.  There is such an honest connection between these two actors.  While she doesn't have as full a character arc as Lior (Zaza is undeniably the central character, and his emotions come full circle by the film's end), she manages to make every moment feel real.  The honesty that bleeds from their love scene alone is simply unmatchable.They complete one another.`Late Marriage' has equal parts respect and distain for its central characters, making this one of the more honest cinematic highlights of the past decade.  It's awkward and unnerving and surprisingly complex.  It approaches the idea of love and honor from a place that most films won't go.  It has wit and charm, but in the end it is a sobering reminder that life, love and family can be crushingly complicated.",5,To who are thee betrothed?,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,3372,"['remember', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Late', 'Marriage', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'ago', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'have', 'literally', 'had', 'goosebumps', 'running', 'down', 'arms', 'reason', 'not', 'message', 'story', 'more', 'brutally', 'honest', 'way', 'told', 'something', 'so', 'organic', 'film', 'so', 'lived', 'real', 'emotionally', 'consuming', 'moment', 'feels', 'home', 'reel', 'almost', 'unprecedented', 'today', ""n't"", 'say', 'cheapness', 'film', 'never', 'once', 'feels', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'shot', 'scenes', 'are', 'allowed', 'linger', 'long', 'enough', 'feel', 'truly', 'lived', 'feel', 'authentic', 'script', 'written', 'such', 'way', 'actors', 'delve', 'characters', 'express', 'authenticity', 'demanded', 'theme', 'so', 'complicated.And', 'complicated', 'is.The', 'film', 'basically', 'two', 'parts', 'One', 'modern', 'take', 'love', 'story', 'have', 'single', 'man', 'entering', 'thirties', 'who', 'love', 'divorced', 'woman', 'slightly', 'elder', 'who', 'daughter', 'own', 'outset', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'odd', 'when', 'factor', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'religious', 'feelings', 'man', 'family', 'then', 'have', 'affair', 'secret', 'young', 'man', 'Zaza', 'out', 'consequences', 'establishing', 'relationship', 'woman', 'Judith', 'deeper', 'make', 'wife', 'would', 'result', 'turmoil', 'family', 'insistent', 'wed', 'young', 'girl', 'untouched', 'marriage', 'divorced', 'woman', 'would', 'bring', 'shame', 'family', 'where', 'second', 'part', 'play', 'When', 'get', 'passed', 'love', 'story', 'come', 'familial', 'story', 'loyalty', 'honor', 'tradition', 'expectations', 'relationship', 'Zaza', 'parents', 'interesting', 'one', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'unhealthy', 'unrealistic', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'viewing', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'heart', 'will', 'allow', 'appreciate', 'abnormally', 'normal', 'light', 'developed.When', 'two', 'parts', 'collide', 'Late', 'Marriage', 'genius.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'complex', 'beautifully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'entire', 'cast', 'Lior', 'Ashkenazi', 'mere', 'acting', 'here', 'Zaza', 'breaks', 'down', 'core', 'man', 'so', 'natural', 'scene', 'regardless', 'what', 'expected', 'do', 'be', 'son', 'be', 'father', 'be', 'lover', 'be', 'man', 'instantly', 'not', 'only', 'relatable', 'unforgettable', 'Matching', 'almost', 'step', 'way', 'beautiful', 'Ronit', 'Elkabetz', 'such', 'honest', 'connection', 'two', 'actors', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'character', 'arc', 'Lior', 'Zaza', 'undeniably', 'central', 'character', 'emotions', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'film', 'end', 'make', 'moment', 'feel', 'real', 'honesty', 'love', 'scene', 'alone', 'simply', 'unmatchable.They', 'complete', 'one', 'another.', 'Late', 'Marriage', 'equal', 'parts', 'respect', 'distain', 'central', 'characters', 'making', 'one', 'more', 'honest', 'cinematic', 'highlights', 'past', 'decade', 'awkward', 'unnerving', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'idea', 'love', 'honor', 'place', 'most', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'wit', 'charm', 'end', 'sobering', 'reminder', 'life', 'love', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'crushingly', 'complicated']",Late Marriage VHS
730188,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00007KK20,Andy Orrock,"[21, 21]","The thrill of watching international movies is to find a superb current release at your local first-run 'art house' cinema, lock on to a great star, then work backwards through that person's previous work.  ""Late Marriage"" is the perfect example of how that movie-watching technique can unearth a hidden gem.In this case, you can start with the oustanding Israeli film (in theaters now), ""Walk on Water.""  You'll never see a better film. Its star, Lior Ashkenazi, is the hottest thing in Israel at the moment. His breakout, it turns out, was 2001's ""Late Marriage.""  Shockingly, my local rental location (with its 150 - 200 international titles) had it in stock.There's an unexpected treat in here: 'Marriage' also features (albeit too briefly) the charms of Aya Koren (billed here as Aya Steinovitz).  This is the most beautiful woman in film today.  See 'Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi' if you doubt that.The film itself is very enlightening and, ultimately, heartbreaking. It centers on the struggles of a 31-year-old man looking for independence in life and love, yet hampered by the expectations and, subsequently, outright threats of his family when it comes to the matters of marriage.  The ending of the film is a jawdropper.  You'd never get this type of dispiriting - but hyper-realistic - conclusion in the ""come lift us up where we belong"" world of Hollywood.Speaking of which, there are some annoying things to comment on about the marketing of this movie.  A prominent blurb on the DVD cover box compares ""Marriage"" to ""Big, Fat Greek Wedding.""Not on your life.  Writer/Director Dover Koshashvili must have spit out his breakfast when he read that.  These two films couldn't be more dissimilar in the way their respective culture conflicts get resolved.Next, we had back of the DVD, which features solely a picture of Ashkenazi and Ms. Koren.  You can't fault a marketer for featuring her front and center, but, alas, she's not center to the film in any fashion.Last, and most egregiously, when have the cover shot of Ashkenazi flashing his newly be-ringed finger into the mirror.  He appears to be showing it to co-star Ronit Elkabetz (his beloved Judith).  This photo is faked.  It's a montage.  It egregiously misrepresents the resolution of the movie.  At this point, Ashkenazi's Lior is alone, lost in deep introspection (we see why in the dramatic, concluding 10 minutes that follow).Who is responsible for this trickery?  Why resort to it?  Will it sell a single extra copy of the movie?  I'll bet this approach greatly upset Mr. Koshashvili.  No way a director would condone this misrepresentation of his baby.",5,Liked 'Walk on Water'?

It doesn't even come close to this film. ""Late Marriage"" may appear as an ethnic comedy at first but the film gradually grows to a melancholic drama, focusing on the main problem of the new generation of Georgian individuals - the dualism between their traditions and between their desires to join the modern society. Zaza (Lior Ashkenzai), who reflects this problem well, is an educated PhD. and yet, he finds it hard to fulfill his desires to marry a girl which is not from his Georgian tribe, for he knows the complications to come, and knows that he will fail in coping with them.This movie doesn't seem like it should be that fantastic, as the tradition-versus-modernity relationship topic is well-trodden in foreign films to say the least, but I absolutely couldn't take my eyes off of this story. Zaza's parents steals most of the scenes in this film, both comically and tragically as a couple unable to fully confront  the re-opening of their own relationship scars caused by witnessing their son's own struggle. The little girl playing Madonna is an excellent actress playing a child caught in an adult vortex she can neither fully understand nor escape.  Meanwhile Lior Askenazi fills out his role rather nicely as the entangled groom-to-be, whose only escape from his unsolvable dilemma is to sink as deeply as possible into his aloof, impulsive persona. You can also see that he refuse to give up his long-term passionate affair with Judith (Ronit Elkabetz). In the middle of this there is a long scene of graphic sexual involvement between them, giving the impression of really making love and being in love complete with multiple orgasms and concern about contraception.Some viewers simply didn't identify with Zaza or found him too ""simple"" in this story. What could be more complex than someone who lets what he loves be taken away from him? He unlocks the door to his lover's building so that his parents can come up and destroy his relationship. This is all too real, all too human.I find the ending ingenious. Instead of a normal, fantastic movie ending, we are hit with realism. Other than that it's an enjoyable film to watch.",4,I could imagine that this has happen to A LOT of people.,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,2260,"['too', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'others', 'would', 'compare', 'film', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'film', 'Late', 'Marriage', 'may', 'appear', 'ethnic', 'comedy', 'first', 'film', 'gradually', 'melancholic', 'drama', 'focusing', 'main', 'problem', 'new', 'generation', 'Georgian', 'individuals', 'dualism', 'traditions', 'desires', 'join', 'modern', 'society', 'Zaza', 'Lior', 'Ashkenzai', 'who', 'problem', 'well', 'educated', 'PhD', 'yet', 'hard', 'fulfill', 'desires', 'marry', 'girl', 'not', 'Georgian', 'tribe', 'complications', 'come', 'will', 'fail', 'coping', 'them.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'should', 'be', 'fantastic', 'tradition-versus-modernity', 'relationship', 'topic', 'well-trodden', 'foreign', 'films', 'say', 'least', 'absolutely', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'story', 'Zaza', 'parents', 'most', 'scenes', 'film', 'comically', 'tragically', 'couple', 'unable', 'fully', 'confront', 're-opening', 'own', 'relationship', 'scars', 'caused', 'witnessing', 'son', 'own', 'struggle', 'little', 'girl', 'playing', 'Madonna', 'excellent', 'actress', 'playing', 'child', 'caught', 'adult', 'can', 'neither', 'fully', 'understand', 'escape', 'Meanwhile', 'Lior', 'Askenazi', 'out', 'role', 'rather', 'nicely', 'entangled', 'groom-to-be', 'only', 'escape', 'unsolvable', 'dilemma', 'sink', 'as', 'deeply', 'possible', 'aloof', 'impulsive', 'persona', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'refuse', 'give', 'up', 'long-term', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Judith', 'Ronit', 'Elkabetz', 'middle', 'long', 'scene', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'involvement', 'giving', 'impression', 'really', 'making', 'love', 'being', 'love', 'complete', 'multiple', 'orgasms', 'concern', 'contraception.Some', 'viewers', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'identify', 'Zaza', 'found', 'too', 'simple', 'story', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'someone', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'door', 'lover', 'building', 'so', 'parents', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'destroy', 'relationship', 'too', 'real', 'too', 'human.I', 'find', 'ending', 'ingenious', 'Instead', 'normal', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'ending', 'are', 'hit', 'realism', 'Other', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'watch']",Late Marriage VHS
730194,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00007KK20,Lee Armstrong,"[7, 11]","""Late Marriage"" was a frustrating film for me to watch, at least the last half.  I admit that it is probably true to its culture.  My lack of enjoyment is based on our culture here in the USA; yet I found it impossible to separate.  The first half is interesting with the family taking Zaza played by Lior Louie Ashkenazi to meet girls to marry.  At 31, they are worried that he will remain a bachelor.  Zaza is a graduate student in philosophy working on his doctorate.  Other than a brief reference, his studies never seem to impact the film, other than to explain why @ 31 he still has his parents' credit card.  Ronit Elkabetz plays the Moroccan immigrant Judith who is divorced.  Zaza and she have a torrid relationship in a graphic bedroom scene.  However, Judith does not want to introduce Zaza to her daughter Madonna.  Zaza knows that his family would never accept Judith because she is divorced.  Lili Kosashvili who is the real-life mother of director Dover Kosashvili plays the character Lili in the film.  Her character is the real heavy in the film.  She transforms a romantic comedy into a social tragedy as Zaza fails to stand up for the woman he loves.  Moni Moshonov plays Zaza's father Yasha with appropriate amounts of vacillation.  A similar history between the parents may explain what seems like an over-reaction by the parents.  The scene where the parents break into Judith's apartment and hurl insults on her and even put a sword to her throat in front of her little daughter Madonna played by Sapir Kugman is unforgivable.  I was enjoying this movie and came to truly hate it.  The performances and direction work; but it is the story to which I was unable to relate.

730200,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00007KK20,Z Hayes,"[2, 3]","""Late Marriage"" is a Hebrew-language movie directed and written by Dover Kosashvilli. It focuses on Georgian Jewish immigrants in Israel who are still bound by old world traditions and where the young  generation is still very much at the mercy of the older generation, especially in matters pertaining to marriage. Zaza [ Lior Ashkenazi] is a 31-year-old graduate student working towards his doctorate in philosophy. His parents are eager to see him married and worried that he will choose an unsuitable bride. So Zaza reluctantly goes along with their matchmaking efforts, whilst concealing the fact that he is in fact involved in a long-term affair with a divorced, single mom Judith [Ronit Elkabetz].Soon enough, things reach crisis point when his parents find out about Judith and rope in their close relatives to help them intervene and put a stop to the affair. The scene where they confront Judith is remarkable in revealing the true nature of some of the main characters. Ultimately, the question is: will Zaza stand up for his rights and protect the woman he truly loves, or will he meekly adhere to his parents' wishes?The acting was excellent all-round and truly portrayed how some traditional societies are still deeply mired in cultural practices that can be deemed rather out of date by contemporary standards. I could empathize with the situation because I myself had to endure similar intrusions in my personal life by 'well-meaning' relatives before ultimately marrying a man of my own choice. This story may seem a bit shocking to those who haven't experienced such heavy-handed interference in their lives, but I have to say that such things as matchmaking, and arranged marriages are not uncommon in very traditional societies [not just confined to Georgian Jews, but others such as conservative Indians etc]. For some such arranged marriages actually work out well, but many others still prefer to choose their own life partners.The actor portraying Zaza [Lior Ashkenazi] is convincing in his role as the amorous yet weak-willed lover, and Ronit Elkabetz is amazing as the much maligned Judith who displays remarkable courage and conviction towards the end. The chemistry between the two leads are credible and the sex scenes are quite graphic [both male and female nudity are portrayed] but I guess these scenes sort of serve to establish the immense sexual connection between the pair, though some parts just felt rather overdone to me.All in all, I felt this was a rather refreshing movie with its less commonly explored theme of arranged marriage, and it provides remarkable insights into a culture I was previously unfamiliar with.",4,Insightful cultural study,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,2658,"['Late', 'Marriage', 'Hebrew-language', 'movie', 'directed', 'written', 'Dover', 'Kosashvilli', 'Georgian', 'Jewish', 'immigrants', 'Israel', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'bound', 'old', 'world', 'traditions', 'where', 'young', 'generation', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'mercy', 'older', 'generation', 'especially', 'matters', 'pertaining', 'marriage', 'Zaza', '[', 'Lior', 'Ashkenazi', ']', '31-year-old', 'graduate', 'student', 'working', 'doctorate', 'philosophy', 'parents', 'are', 'eager', 'see', 'married', 'worried', 'will', 'choose', 'unsuitable', 'bride', 'So', 'Zaza', 'reluctantly', 'matchmaking', 'efforts', 'whilst', 'concealing', 'fact', 'fact', 'involved', 'long-term', 'affair', 'divorced', 'single', 'mom', 'Judith', '[', 'Ronit', 'Elkabetz', ']', '.Soon', 'enough', 'things', 'reach', 'crisis', 'point', 'when', 'parents', 'find', 'out', 'Judith', 'rope', 'close', 'relatives', 'help', 'intervene', 'put', 'stop', 'affair', 'scene', 'where', 'confront', 'Judith', 'remarkable', 'revealing', 'true', 'nature', 'main', 'characters', 'Ultimately', 'question', 'will', 'Zaza', 'stand', 'up', 'rights', 'protect', 'woman', 'loves', 'will', 'meekly', 'adhere', 'parents', 'wishes', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'all-round', 'truly', 'portrayed', 'how', 'traditional', 'societies', 'are', 'still', 'deeply', 'mired', 'cultural', 'practices', 'can', 'be', 'deemed', 'rather', 'date', 'contemporary', 'standards', 'could', 'empathize', 'situation', 'had', 'endure', 'similar', 'intrusions', 'personal', 'life', ""'well-meaning"", 'relatives', 'ultimately', 'marrying', 'man', 'own', 'choice', 'story', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'shocking', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'such', 'heavy-handed', 'interference', 'lives', 'have', 'say', 'such', 'things', 'matchmaking', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'are', 'not', 'uncommon', 'very', 'traditional', 'societies', '[', 'not', 'just', 'confined', 'Georgian', 'Jews', 'others', 'such', 'conservative', 'Indians', 'etc', ']', 'such', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'actually', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'still', 'prefer', 'choose', 'own', 'life', 'partners.The', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Zaza', '[', 'Lior', 'Ashkenazi', ']', 'convincing', 'role', 'amorous', 'yet', 'weak-willed', 'lover', 'Ronit', 'Elkabetz', 'amazing', 'much', 'maligned', 'Judith', 'who', 'remarkable', 'courage', 'conviction', 'end', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'credible', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'graphic', '[', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', 'are', 'portrayed', 'guess', 'scenes', 'sort', 'serve', 'establish', 'immense', 'sexual', 'connection', 'pair', 'parts', 'just', 'felt', 'rather', 'overdone', 'me.All', 'felt', 'was', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'movie', 'less', 'commonly', 'explored', 'theme', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'remarkable', 'insights', 'culture', 'was', 'previously', 'unfamiliar']",Late Marriage VHS
