1092351,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B000TV4PVA,Doctor.Generosity,"[2, 3]","Cleverly made film in the style of a documentary which purports to follow a professional thief around Chicago. Actually the director Malik Bader plays the subject, with convincing arrogance, patter and chain smoking profanity. He loves to eat and the camera catches him cooking, ordering fast food, reveling in his food. I only realized this was fictionalized late in the film when the supposed documentarians bring their footage to the police, which seemed unrealistic in the extreme. In any case, very skillful and certainly the directors had access to gritty real life expertise if not their own. Fascinating glimpses into techniques of robbery including power saws to cut into safes. The plot is minimal but the thief at one point breaks his rule of working alone by collaborating with the Russian owner of a strip club to stage a robbery as an inside job; unfortunately this leads to his murder. The artists created a cloud of ambiguity around the film which kept the Tribeca Film Festival people guessing. All part of the art game.Malik Bader is an innovative talent and new voice in independent film. He has a new project to be released this year; look forward to seeing it.",5,Cleverly made and almost fooled me,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1181,"['Cleverly', 'made', 'film', 'style', 'documentary', 'follow', 'professional', 'thief', 'Chicago', 'Actually', 'director', 'Malik', 'Bader', 'subject', 'convincing', 'arrogance', 'patter', 'chain', 'smoking', 'profanity', 'eat', 'camera', 'cooking', 'ordering', 'fast', 'food', 'reveling', 'food', 'only', 'realized', 'was', 'fictionalized', 'late', 'film', 'when', 'supposed', 'documentarians', 'bring', 'footage', 'police', 'seemed', 'unrealistic', 'extreme', 'case', 'very', 'skillful', 'certainly', 'directors', 'had', 'access', 'gritty', 'real', 'life', 'expertise', 'not', 'own', 'Fascinating', 'glimpses', 'techniques', 'robbery', 'including', 'power', 'saws', 'cut', 'safes', 'plot', 'minimal', 'thief', 'one', 'point', 'rule', 'working', 'alone', 'collaborating', 'Russian', 'owner', 'strip', 'club', 'stage', 'robbery', 'inside', 'job', 'unfortunately', 'murder', 'artists', 'created', 'cloud', 'ambiguity', 'film', 'kept', 'Tribeca', 'Film', 'Festival', 'people', 'guessing', 'part', 'art', 'game.Malik', 'Bader', 'innovative', 'talent', 'new', 'voice', 'independent', 'film', 'new', 'project', 'be', 'released', 'year', 'forward', 'seeing']",Street Thief

Yet another one of those hidden gems I randomly came across that somehow didn't get barely any attention when it was released... it definitely should have. It's basically a fake documentary... although you wouldn't really know that based on how the film is done. It's filmed as almost a guerrilla style documentary following a professional thief in his day to day life. We get to see how he scouts locations, what methods he uses, and even a little peak into his psyche.I found it absolutely fascinating, and throughout I kept imagining how even though it's technically fake... it's probably pretty close to how a real professional thief would work. There are also moments of tension and suspense as we actually tag along with the main character on some of his heists... real nail biting stuff; which is aided with the documentary style film making.
