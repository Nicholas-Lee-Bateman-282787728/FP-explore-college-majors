But the way the story used the holocaust to teach I thought was very different and such an interesting way to relate to the teenagers in the film.

1058876,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000NOK1KC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Freedom Writers' is not the best teacher student film out there by any means, but it is effective and it is enjoyable in its own rights.  The true story of Erin Gruwell and the effect she had on her students is an uplifting on at that and I guess is one that deserved to be told.  The problem with stories like this is that, while its truth based, is so generic that it really adds nothing new.  The teacher is an angel sent from heaven to help her unruly class learn for themselves that they are worth more than what they make of themselves.  She's littered with the bad kids, the dope peddling, gang members of society and she meets adversity from everyone around her so in the end she has to do just as much fighting and pulling as her students to in order to make a difference.  If it sounds familiar that's because just about every teacher student film made these days has the same scenario.  I know that you can't really do too much to change things when the film is based on a true life account, but it would be nice if they could find a true life account that plays a little more controversially.So, the story follows Erin Gruwell, a young a nave teacher who chooses her school because of the new integration program and arrives ready to change the world.  The rest of the teacher staff is less than optimistic, maybe even les than pessimistic, and soon begin to resent Gruwell and her cheery disposition.  Gruwell herself soon finds that her classroom is more like a war zone with Blacks, Hispanics, and Asian's segregating themselves and the one White boy about ready to pee his pants in fear stuck in the middle.  All the classic stereotypes are there (but are they really stereotypes if they're true?) for both the students and the teacher.  Each race hates the other and it's up to Gruwell to separate the boundaries of hate by identifying the root problem.  Gruwell tries being their friend, but that fails to work, and then finally she gets a little tough, and there's a breakthrough.  Without any support from her peers or even her family she has to take on side jobs in order to buy her class books for their curriculum, but it's her dire dedication and genuine concern for them that helps make that difference she so desperately wanted to see.The film does a good job of showing the adverse effects of jealousy.  You can see as Gruwell's marriage deteriorates the main reason stems from her husbands overall jealously of his wife's success, something he can't take.  He longed to be an architect but allowed himself to get overwhelmed and ultimately complacent to the point that he resents his own aspirations and resents the fact that his wife dreamed of being a teacher and more so dreamed of making a difference and was, in effect, accomplishing both.  Gruwell's fellow teachers also show jealousy in there resentment of her teaching methods, realizing that they never lacked the skill to reach these students and are infuriated that a younger less experienced teacher finally has.  In that respect the film does a great job of fleshing out those feelings.As far as the acting is concerned, the only real standout to me was Imelda Staunton who just sizzles as Gruwell's main adversary.  Swank does a decent job, but she's an actress who tends to baffle me.  When I watch her perform in her two Oscar winning performances, `Boys Don't Cry' especially, I'm blown away.  She fails to give me that same feeling in anything else though.  It's not to say she's not a good actress, it's just that when you deliver two iconic performances you need to be able to at least wow us in your other work.  Other than those two films she has yet to really show me brilliance.  It's almost as if those two performances were flukes, given by some other actress inhibiting Swanks body.  Dempsey is a dud, and it doesn't help that he's far, very far, from likable here.  For the most part young actors are right on the line, some very amateur while some show promise.  April L. Hernandez is the apparent standout basically because she's given the most screen time and is fleshed out much better than the rest of the class, but her performance teeters right about average.So in the end it's a film that is pleasing and enjoyable but really nothing new.  It won't entirely disappoint, but then again I don't think anyone was really expecting a whole lot in the first place.  It's far from the best teacher student film, but it's also a far cry from the worst.  It will make you smile and in some parts maybe even make you cry (I found myself tearing up a bit, but I'm emotional like that) and in the end will make you wonder why you never had a teacher this godlike.",3,Sweet and wholesome yet the same basic inspirational story retold with different faces...,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,4666,"['Freedom', 'Writers', 'not', 'best', 'teacher', 'student', 'film', 'there', 'means', 'effective', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'rights', 'true', 'story', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'effect', 'had', 'students', 'uplifting', 'guess', 'one', 'deserved', 'be', 'told', 'problem', 'stories', 'truth', 'based', 'so', 'generic', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'teacher', 'angel', 'sent', 'heaven', 'help', 'unruly', 'class', 'learn', 'are', 'more', 'what', 'make', 'littered', 'bad', 'kids', 'dope', 'peddling', 'gang', 'members', 'society', 'adversity', 'everyone', 'so', 'end', 'do', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fighting', 'pulling', 'students', 'order', 'make', 'difference', 'familiar', 'because', 'just', 'teacher', 'student', 'film', 'made', 'days', 'same', 'scenario', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'change', 'things', 'when', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'life', 'account', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'could', 'find', 'true', 'life', 'account', 'little', 'more', 'controversially.So', 'story', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'young', 'nave', 'teacher', 'who', 'school', 'new', 'integration', 'program', 'ready', 'change', 'world', 'rest', 'teacher', 'staff', 'less', 'optimistic', 'maybe', 'even', 'les', 'pessimistic', 'soon', 'begin', 'resent', 'Gruwell', 'cheery', 'disposition', 'Gruwell', 'soon', 'classroom', 'more', 'war', 'zone', 'Blacks', 'Hispanics', 'Asian', 'segregating', 'one', 'White', 'boy', 'about', 'ready', 'pee', 'pants', 'fear', 'stuck', 'middle', 'classic', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'really', 'stereotypes', ""'re"", 'true', 'students', 'teacher', 'race', 'other', 'up', 'Gruwell', 'separate', 'boundaries', 'hate', 'identifying', 'root', 'problem', 'Gruwell', 'being', 'friend', 'work', 'then', 'finally', 'little', 'tough', 'breakthrough', 'support', 'peers', 'even', 'family', 'take', 'side', 'jobs', 'order', 'buy', 'class', 'books', 'curriculum', 'dire', 'dedication', 'genuine', 'concern', 'make', 'difference', 'so', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'see.The', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'adverse', 'effects', 'jealousy', 'can', 'see', 'Gruwell', 'marriage', 'main', 'reason', 'husbands', 'overall', 'jealously', 'wife', 'success', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'longed', 'be', 'architect', 'allowed', 'get', 'overwhelmed', 'ultimately', 'complacent', 'point', 'own', 'aspirations', 'fact', 'wife', 'dreamed', 'being', 'teacher', 'more', 'so', 'dreamed', 'making', 'difference', 'was', 'effect', 'accomplishing', 'Gruwell', 'fellow', 'teachers', 'also', 'show', 'jealousy', 'resentment', 'teaching', 'methods', 'realizing', 'never', 'lacked', 'skill', 'reach', 'students', 'are', 'infuriated', 'younger', 'less', 'experienced', 'teacher', 'finally', 'respect', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'feelings.As', 'far', 'acting', 'concerned', 'only', 'real', 'standout', 'was', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'who', 'just', 'sizzles', 'Gruwell', 'main', 'adversary', 'Swank', 'decent', 'job', 'actress', 'who', 'baffle', 'When', 'watch', 'perform', 'two', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performances', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'especially', ""'m"", 'blown', 'away', 'give', 'same', 'feeling', 'anything', 'else', 'not', 'say', 'not', 'good', 'actress', 'just', 'when', 'deliver', 'two', 'iconic', 'performances', 'need', 'be', 'able', 'least', 'wow', 'other', 'work', 'Other', 'two', 'films', 'yet', 'really', 'show', 'brilliance', 'almost', 'two', 'performances', 'were', 'flukes', 'given', 'other', 'actress', 'inhibiting', 'Swanks', 'body', 'Dempsey', 'dud', ""n't"", 'help', 'far', 'very', 'far', 'likable', 'here', 'most', 'part', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'right', 'line', 'very', 'amateur', 'show', 'promise', 'April', 'L.', 'Hernandez', 'apparent', 'standout', 'basically', 'given', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'fleshed', 'out', 'much', 'better', 'rest', 'class', 'performance', 'teeters', 'right', 'average.So', 'end', 'film', 'pleasing', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'wo', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'disappoint', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'was', 'really', 'expecting', 'whole', 'lot', 'first', 'place', 'far', 'best', 'teacher', 'student', 'film', 'also', 'far', 'cry', 'worst', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'parts', 'maybe', 'even', 'make', 'cry', 'found', 'tearing', 'up', 'bit', ""'m"", 'emotional', 'end', 'will', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'never', 'had', 'teacher', 'godlike']",N/A

The ensemble playing her students is great, too. For many, this is their first time on screen.  Of particular note, April Hernandez is outstanding in the role of Eva.On the other hand, this movie suffers from its one-dimensional, negative portrayal of any adult - husband, co-educator, administrator - not sharing Gruwell's vision.

1058880,A3SH2Z6PZ5XBXR,B000NOK1KC,A reader,"[9, 22]","This movie had the unique ability to make me nauseated literally from beginning to end.  The plot is shopworn and typical for today's politically correct times - the naive and well-intentioned liberal white, sheltered and unfamiliar with the peculiarities of ghetto life and the evils of white 'privilege' who must be brought up short and 'educated' by the minorities she is, strangely enough, supposed to be teaching.  Of course, as she learns from her students their tales of oppression, lack of opportunity and ongoing poverty, she is truly shamed into helping them, into devising an educational method to enlighten and empower them and, of course, in the process, of enlightening and empowering herself as well.Somehow, it just isn't their fault that these minority students are involved in gang warfare, that they have a nasty habit of shooting and killing each other, dealing and doing drugs and stealing.  And, by gosh, they just can't help doing poorly in school and eventually dropping out, of being without marketable skills and education, of making babies out of wedlock and infecting themselves and others with STD's.  The liberal white teacher and all she represents is responsible and somehow she must atone for the sins of her people and her society.Naturally enough, Hilary Swank, who plays the teacher, willingly accepts the blame and very soon becomes a vociferous advocate of minority racism and white 'guilt'.  'Empowered' now by the heroic stuggles of her students, her mission in life quickly becomes clear.  She must do all she can to 'help' these poor kids but how?  After much deliberation, she has an answer and it is a truly unique one - - a good old fashion dose of, what else?, The Diary of Anne Frank!Of course!  And if that wasn't enough, how about a hearty serving of 'holocaust' instruction and lectures by people who have 'survived' the 'holocaust'....Surely the forged and phony 'diary' of a hapless little Jewish girl, a document written, for the most part, in ball point pen before such a writing instrument was even invented, must and will help these students find 'truth'.Truth?  The irony here is inescapable....Even worse, lessons in 'holocaust' instruction are somehow supposed to teach these children the idea of 'tolerance' yet, judging by the gangster state of Israel's brutal and barbaric treatment of the Palestinian people, the benefits of 'holocaust' instruction seem dubious at best.This movie is nothing more than a vile piece of Hollywood propaganda and, I am sure, like Schindler's List, is required viewing for all students especially those from inner city schools.  It would seem that this Jewish teacher's agenda - inculcating young, impressionable minds with 'holocaust' ideology, ensuring they are 'believers' instead of 'deniers' - is far more important than schooling these kids in the life skills necessary to survive.In a more normal and rational society, a much better movie would be one that illustrates the importance of education, personal integrity and responsibility with an emphasis on the values of hard work and civic mindedness.

Even more than University City, which is a somewhat privileged middle-class mixed town. St. Louis in the downtown area has its share of racial problems, and the Freedom Writers Foundation might work its magic there.Before I go any further, here's the foundation's web site: [...] which I recommend to check out.Erin Gruwell was an idealistic young teacher on her first teaching job in Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. The head of the department (who is played by Imelda Staunton, the same actress who played Dolores Umbridge in the latest Harry Potter movie, if that tells you anything) gave her the ""problem kids"" to teach English. Some of them could barely speak it, let alone read, to say nothing of writing. She went exploring the books in storage in the department, discovered ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" and Umbridge (sorry; the department head) said she couldn't have them because the kids would not be able to read them, and they would either steal them or return them all damaged and marked up. And this was just one example of the difficulties she faced, as this department head kept going to the principal to complain about Ms. Gruwell.But the kids, most of whom lived in the ghetto and were either gang members or had gangs dominating their neighborhoods, eventually warmed up to her, especially when she gave them each a composition book and asked them to write something every day. She put aside a locked cabinet for them to give them to her to read ""if they wanted to."" After none of the parents showed up to the ""parents night"" meeting, she opened the cabinet and found that it was full of diaries. All or most of the kids wanted her to read them.But the stories broke her heart. Almost all of the kids had lost at least one friend or family member to gang violence. They had been to juvenile hall, they had friends and relatives in prison, and were abused or neglected at home, and on and on.Ms. Gruwell was taking a lot of flak from her husband and father, as well as from the school administration, for her involvement with the kids. She took a couple of part-time jobs to raise the money to buy the kids books (Borders got its plug in there), and gave them an assignment to write to the lady who had hidden Anne Frank after they were so impressed by the story. They also raised the money to invite her to visit them, and had a very moving trip to the Holocaust Museum.It's my impression Ms. Gruwell was the first one to treat these kids as anything other than a problem. And that was most of what they needed. In the end, she persuaded a business man to donate a bunch of old computers and had them put their diaries together to make a book. At first they published it in what was obviously a copy-center style, with the plastic spine holding together 8.5 x 11 paper. But if you go to that site I mentioned, the book is available (probably forwarding you to Amazon), and they have created a non-profit foundation to bring these teaching methods to other kids.It's an awesome story, and you'll love it even if you don't really care for the music the kids love or the funky way they talk and dress.

I can hear my detractors now (""But this is a true story!"" and ""It's heartwarming!""). My dog ran away once and I thought we'd lost him forever. But he came back. It's a true story. And I consider my dog pretty heartwarming. But I'd NEVER consider putting it on film, as it too has been done to death (seeHomeward Bound - The Incredible Journey). I'm not comparing animal stories to human interest ones, but the emotional wallop they used to have has seriously waned.So let's get into the meat-and-potatoes of this sucker. To be completely honest, it's not all that bad. Hilary Swank pulls in a high-level performance as Erin Gruwell, a new teacher at a Long Beach, California school where racial integration has triggered turf wars. Blacks, Whites, Asians, and Latinos are all at each others' throats. Until (queue heroic music) Mrs. Gruwell arrives to save them from their hateful and murderous ways. At first she's at a loss of how to reach her new students. But she finally starts understanding how their lives outside the classroom directly affects what happens inside. She finally helps them grasp their prejudices by readingAnne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. Learning about the Holocaust and the extreme persecution of the jews, the classmates come together and learn to ignore skin color and focus on what's on the inside. Gruwell also aids them in writing journal entries which eventually were bound together into a book called (ta-da) ""The Freedom Writers Diary : How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them.""While her students battle their internal demons via close quarters in class and their journal entries, Gruwell has to battle the prejudices of the school faculty and the break-up of her marriage (because she spends so much time with her class versus at home with her husband).The big letdown is that there's nothing new here. Yes, again, the story is true. Yes, it's interesting. Yes, it's heartwarming. Yes, we've seen it time after time after time after time.The other problem I encountered was that these kids were supposed to be high school freshman (14 years old). But several of the boys were approaching or over six feet tall, and had mustaches along with five o'clock shadows. Kind of makes it difficult to suspend belief when seeing that.Still, there's a good story at its core. Mrs. Gruwell is to be commended for what she's done in helping these young folks turn their lives around.Now if we could just move on to another story!

The movie is about a teacher (Erin Gruwell) who works on trying to save her class from dropping out or dying on the streets and help them have some kind of future. At first all of the teens go into their own protective segregated ""territories"" and despise each other. Ms. Gruwell risks her career and even her life to helps the teens see beyond mere differences and how much they all actually have in common. The especially touching part of the movie was when she takes her student on a field trip to the Holocaust Museum (most of the students didn't even know what the word meant), and their reaction when they learned what really happened to the Jews 60 years ago.This movie is based on a true story which you can see in the DVD extra features and the real Ms. Gruwell talks about her experiences with the teens at the high school back in 1994. It was so good to hear that all of them made something out of their lives since then and have meaningful careers.

When the end credits rolled and it made mention of the real people, I was blown away! I can't believe someone exists as amazing as that teacher.But, plotline aside, you the review reader are more interested in whether the people who put this together pur it together in a way that is actually good.Yes, they did!Acting is topnotch all around. Some very brilliant directing, with great emotional use of lighting, shadows, hand-held cam, and so forth.It feels very real, and dips into the pathos of the characters without getting saccharine or sentimental about it, or portraying a naive sort of neanderthalism.My only complaint is that the other teacher - I can't remember her name, but she was played by the woman who played the bad lady in The Order of the Phoenix - is one-dimensionally nasty. We never see another side of her. While I don't doubt that she was based on a real person, I can't believe that anyone is that one dimensional. It seemed a rather cheap trick on the part of the writers and director to make her entire being the ""bad person"", without any humanity.

Gruwell soon learns that her optimistic view of teaching, community building and resilience are not shared by everyone in her administration. Erin's greatest teachers are her students, whose day-to-day survival in their neighborhood is tested every time they walk in and out of her classroom. This is especially made evident by the pain and distrust experienced by students like Eva (April L. Hernandez), whose father was dragged off by the cops and sentenced to jail for a crime he did not commit, when she was just a young girl. Rage frequently rises to a head, in school fights and tension in and out of the classroom. Gruwell takes these challenges as fuel to motivate her students to write and process all that they are experiencing.The acting, here, is so strong, the characters are completely believable and the message is so positive.

It's sad that such stories depict the exception and not the norm.Magic seems to happen when humans transfer their thoughts from their minds into another medium. Erin Gruwell's magic is to encourage her students to keep a journal of these thoughts. And a transformation begins to take place. The film shows this magical transformation in subtle and direct ways that can't be ignored.Aside from keeping a journal for a life-changing transformation, Gruwell brought to the troubled kids' attention a Human attrocity committed in the past: the Holocaust. In other words she fought fire with fire. Once the fiery emotionally destructive turmoils in these kids minds were quenched by the learning of the turmoils of the past, innocence seemed to have come back into their souls.

It's also based on a true story.But... even when the movie has a positive message, the movie can be to biased. It makes the teacher look like a hero and the other teachers like villains because they believe in segregation, I know that what the teacher did was noble but it looked more like an obsession to me (even for a just cause). The movie mainly focus on her point of view and it hardly shows the ""other side's"" point (even when we know it's wrong), we only see the ""bad"" teachers being humiliated by her actions while we see her and the students successing all the way. We don't really get to see her hard struggle to afford everything that she wanted for the students, it's just mentioned. I personally don't aprove the ending (even if it was the right thing to do for most people).I know that the movie mainly focus on the teacher's relationship with the students, but I think that it could be done without been such a ""goody"" propaganda.

This viewer avoided the film, thinking it was yet another in a long line of 'bad school kids with criminal instincts' brought around by a champion teacher (starting with 'Blackboard Jungle' the same story has been told almost yearly!): it is a distinct pleasure to share that this film is so very different on many levels that it makes all the other school problem/redemption movies pale in comparison.Based on a true story about a Long Beach California High School just after integration and busing altered the state's educational system, the book ""The Freedom Writers Diary: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them"" by Erin Gruwell is a compilation of the journals of the student of a newly mixed racial classroom (African American, Latino, Cambodian, Chinese, White) voicing their experiences about coming together as a family due to the influence of a novice, naive, but highly motivated and insightful teacher - Erin Gruwell.  The book was adapted for the screen by director Richard LaGravenese and carefully cast with young actors who represented the very groups about whom the story is written.Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank, in her very finest role to date!) is married to a frustrated architect student Scott (Patrick Dempsey) who has 'settled ' for a life as a computer programmer.  Erin, the daughter of a Civil Rights activist (Scott Glenn), is idealistic and wants to teach in a place where she is challenged, a chance to make her life meaningful.  She graciously and naively steps into a classroom of high school freshmen, all form different gangs and scarred by racial violence, frustrated to be trapped in a classroom with a white woman who seems clueless to their real life problems, wanting to teach them literature!  The story unveils the technique Erin develops to erase border lines and bond the students by visits to the Holocaust Museum, taking them to nice restaurants in Newport Beach, treating them with respect and asking them to see the similarities in each other.  The students respond, despite the harsh warnings of Erin's fellow teachers Margaret (Imelda Staunton, in another exceptional role) who insists everything is by the old rules, and Brian (John Benjamin Hickey) who has little use for the new system and group of students. As an example of how the students transform their characters is the funding of a visit to Long Beach by the woman who hid Anne Frank (the students have read her diary as a vulnerable Jewish child) and Pat Carroll plays that woman Miep Gies in yet another outstanding performance.Though the film is strong in every moment and every member of the cast (though the brilliance of Hilary Swank's portrayal is one of incredible realism and subtlety) and the various actors who comprise the Freedom Writers are superb: April Lee Hernandez, Mario, Jason Finn, Deance Wyatt, Kristin Herrera, Jacklyn Ngan, Sergio Montalvo, Vanetta Smith, Gabriel Chavarria, Hunter Parrish, Antonio Garc&iacute;a, Giovonnie Samuels, and Jacklyn Ngan  and yes, they all deserve mentioning in a review.

A project it is to let the students dictate the class, the syllabus, the method, the themes and the objectives, though the objectives are also slightly determined by the teachers from time to time, at least by making the students discuss them and agree on them. That's not very difficult actually, because they want to know how to read, write, speak English and even calculate, compute, multiply and divide at ease. But that is only the easy part of the project because it is the jam that is going to bring the sweet teeth and sweet tongues of the students together. The most difficult part is to love the students. In the film the English teacher says ""like"" not to antagonize the colleagues, not to give them an easy argument to speak of perversion. But it is ""love"" that is needed her. You have to love them and make them feel happy and glad to be loved and free to love back, and that love is called respect. They may one day have a sharp word with the teacher and some angry remarks about the class or the school. But love is the real wrapping of this little pebble, the wrapping that provides everyone with the warmth that may take you across the winter, the spring flood of the local river or a divorce. The worst things the do-nothing-change-nothing self-satisfied senior teachers may say will come then when they realize the relation has become personal between the teacher and the students. They will insinuate that it is far beyond that personal and has reached the intimate level. And there some may even get scared, or frightening to others, parents particularly, with innuendo and slandering. The film is discreet about this last part of the opposition to that new method of dealing with ""flunkies"", but it is constantly present in the back of their eyes (the dirty voyeurs they are) and of their minds (if they have a mind of their own). A very delicate and tender film about the least tender people in the world, the kids from the projects that have replaced the ghettos after the last riots in Los Angeles. It gives you a taste of change so you can toast change on a pit and enjoy the sweet marshmallow that stuffs that change to the very brim.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",5,Seniority versus love,1240444800,"04 23, 2009",2009,2929,"['central', 'subject', 'pedagogical', 'project', 'not', 'project', 'dilapidated', 'new', 'housing', 'projects', 'ghetto', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'kept', 'ghetto', 'more', 'separate', 'urban', 'area', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'only', 'hurt', 'one', 'teaching', 'Teaching', 'project', 'what', 'flush', 'down', 'toilet', 'syllabus', 'pre-digested', 'pre-fabricated', 'classes', 'courses', 'know', 'course', 'produced', 'once', 'till', 'teacher', 'Comfortable', 'do-little', 'personnel', 'totally', 'deadly', 'morbid', 'kids', 'who', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'flunkies', 'unable', 'be', 'anything', 'else', 'project', 'let', 'students', 'dictate', 'class', 'syllabus', 'method', 'themes', 'objectives', 'objectives', 'are', 'also', 'slightly', 'determined', 'teachers', 'time', 'time', 'least', 'making', 'students', 'discuss', 'agree', 'not', 'very', 'difficult', 'actually', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'read', 'write', 'speak', 'English', 'even', 'calculate', 'compute', 'multiply', 'divide', 'ease', 'only', 'easy', 'part', 'project', 'jam', 'going', 'bring', 'sweet', 'teeth', 'sweet', 'tongues', 'students', 'together', 'most', 'difficult', 'part', 'love', 'students', 'film', 'English', 'teacher', 'not', 'antagonize', 'colleagues', 'not', 'give', 'easy', 'argument', 'speak', 'perversion', 'love', 'needed', 'have', 'love', 'make', 'feel', 'happy', 'glad', 'be', 'loved', 'free', 'love', 'back', 'love', 'called', 'respect', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'have', 'sharp', 'word', 'teacher', 'angry', 'remarks', 'class', 'school', 'love', 'real', 'wrapping', 'little', 'pebble', 'wrapping', 'everyone', 'warmth', 'may', 'take', 'winter', 'spring', 'flood', 'local', 'river', 'divorce', 'worst', 'things', 'do-nothing-change-nothing', 'self-satisfied', 'senior', 'teachers', 'may', 'say', 'will', 'come', 'then', 'when', 'realize', 'relation', 'become', 'personal', 'teacher', 'students', 'will', 'insinuate', 'far', 'personal', 'reached', 'intimate', 'level', 'may', 'even', 'get', 'scared', 'frightening', 'others', 'parents', 'particularly', 'innuendo', 'slandering', 'film', 'discreet', 'last', 'part', 'opposition', 'new', 'method', 'dealing', 'flunkies', 'constantly', 'present', 'back', 'eyes', 'dirty', 'are', 'minds', 'have', 'mind', 'own', 'very', 'delicate', 'tender', 'film', 'least', 'tender', 'people', 'world', 'kids', 'projects', 'have', 'replaced', 'ghettos', 'last', 'riots', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'taste', 'change', 'can', 'toast', 'change', 'pit', 'enjoy', 'sweet', 'marshmallow', 'change', 'very', 'brim.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines', 'CEGID']",N/A

She also assigns the kids to write journals which ultimately are turned into a book.Of course, Swank playing the teacher Erin Gruwell, encounters opposition from the established education hierarchy. Her marriage also falls apart. You know: the usual stuff.I don't mean to be light, but the script is not heavyweight. Swank plays the role with way too much perk. Her husband just has one mood: bad. Her dad (well played by Scott Glenn) is perenially skeptical. The kids in the class are reasonably well played, if heavily stereotyped.Even with the weak script and somewhat mediocre performances, though, the story is still strong.

Wilson High School at this point has started a new integration policy that leaves the ""higher ups"" handing a new teacher like Erin a classroom mostly full of ethnic teens that have been deemed ""unteachable.""A large part of these students come from gang lifestyles and/or have lost loved ones to gang violence Erin learns as she tries to get the class to participate. She also discovers a bit into her first year most of her students have never heard of the Holocaust against the Jews in World War II. In fact by a raise of hands vote only one kid in the class has and he's the only white student in the class. It becomes clear to Erin as a teacher (and to the viewer) that these kids have not been educated enough or wanted to learn about this sort of thing until she mentions it and grabs their attention. It's from this she eventually uses ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" as the reading assignment for her class. From that she decides to give each student a notebook and let them all write their own diary. This is a really moving story of how this young lady got these kids to unite and really want to learn and rethink their lifestyles. This film as I said in the beginning is based on a true story. In fact the real life Erin Gruwell and her students wrote a book that was published in 1999 called ""The Freedom Writers Diary"" that was made up of her story and their diary entries.Video Quality on this release is in 1080p AVC MPEG-4 on a 30 gigabyte disc. The video quality on this Paramount release in this different codec than the usual VC-1 most of us are accustomed to on HD DVD is absolutely impressive. This is up there with some of the best video quality on either format that I have seen to date. Amazing color, very pristine clear picture and almost no noise, artifacts or pixilation of any sort to speak of. Overall I'd say I'm extremely impressed by the video quality on this release.Audio Quality on this release is in Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 @ 1.5Mbps. This audio mix is pretty damn good if I say so myself. I'm not much for the Hip-Hop music heard in the film but it comes across great here as the soundtrack and the dialog is perfectly clear. No flaws to be found in this sound mix really. Then again this is not an action flick or anything that is going to really show off sound wise so I didn't honestly expect much to begin with. Overall I have to admit that I'm impressed by the audio quality on this release.Bonus Materials are in 4:3 standard definition. First off is audio Commentary by Director Richard LaGravenese and Hilary Swank. We get Deleted Scenes (11 minutes) which offers some laughs and as Erin takes the kids to see ""Schindler's List"" we get to see one of the reporters come up and ask to do a story on her class. We also soon to get the see the results of that which include racist threatening phone calls that Erin receives.""Making A Dream (5 minutes) offers a ""making of"" the theme song to the film, ""A Dream."" This features interviews with Hip-Hop artist ""Common"" and ""Will.I.Am"" (who did the score to the film as well). They both discuss using the sample of the late Martin Luther King's voice in the song and how well it turned out. I'd have to agree and I'm not even that big of a Hip-Hop fan. ""Freedom Writers Family"" (20 minutes) seems to be your basic ""making of"" documentary for the film and features interviews with Hilary Swank, Writer/Director Richard LaGravenese, the rest of the cast and the real life Erin Gruwell. This proves to be very informative and is worth watching. You also get to see some video clips of the 2006 reunion of the original classmates that made up the real life ""Freedom Writers.""""Freedom Writers: The Story Behind the Story"" (10 minutes) discusses the racial tension in the post ""L.A. riots"" time period that the film is in. The cast who play the students in the film talk a bit about their characters and gang violence. On a lighter note we also get to see Hilary Swank learn to do the ""electric slide.""

Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank stars in this gripping story of inner-city kids raised on drive-by shootings and hard-core attitude-and the teacher who gives them the one thing they need most: a voice of their own.

Now, telling their own stories, and hearing the stories of others, a group of supposedly ""unteachable"" teens will discover the power of tolerance, reclaim their shattered lives and change their world.

After her initial shock wears off and she sees the underachieving and unruly students she has to deal with, she begins to relate to them by showing an interest in their world and the problems they have to deal with.  The students begin to write in a daily journal and are encouraged by the interest that their teacher shows in them.  She takes them on field trips, plays games with them and does whatever it takes to break through the hard shell that they have built around themselves.  The journals that are quoted in the film are the actual ones which Erin Gruell inspired her students to write.  This theme, as many have pointed out, has been done many times in films, but this story is a true one and it resonates with the genuine caring and tolerance which is taught in Room 203 and which carries over into the lives of the students.

I don't think there is a situation in the film where people feel sorry for each other, they learn to understand and accept each other. Which is probably the worst thing that could happen to the human race as a whole (that's sarcasm). Ummm...this wasn't merely another film from a specific genre, it's based on a true story and dedicated to one of the students from the actual class who was killed in a gang-related crime.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well done it was.  Sure, there were a few over the top moments but overall this movie was very inspiring.  Hillary Swanks character is just totally cool in this movie.  She does what she loves - not for money or power but because she loves her work.The movie follows pretty much the same formula as teacher movies like Stand And Deliver and Dangerous Minds but there are plenty feel good moments and I applaud any teacher who teaches like that.  I can easily see how this movie can inspire a young  mind to be a teacher.There were a few flaws.  I didn't like how villains and bad guys were forcefully put into the movie.  I mean the vice principal (or whoever she was) blatantly going out of her way to thwart Hillary was a bit too much.  I mean if you don't help, then fine, but to go out of your way to try to stop her from helping the students?  Calling them thugs?  A bit too much.The villains don't stop here.  The honors teacher who blows up on Hillary after she asks him for some support?  The 40 year old wannabe architect who acts younger than Hillary's students?  The father who asks Hillary her salary?  All these villians just felt a little forced.  A good 20 minutes could have been edited out without deteriorating the inspiring story.  I can understand how she has to go through hardships, but preferably they should be the students predominantly.Swank's acting was pretty decent but nothing to write home about.  The students did a fine job.This movie is a definite for people who enjoyed the other 'teacher movies' and quite enjoyable.

A gritty urban school drama, about a teacher that really cared enough to make a difference. A couple of things though, I thought that the charecters of the kids ,came around to her side too fast and that seemed like a part that was missing or underdeveloped. Teaching a class of inner city kids about the Holocaust seems like a good idea, but there again it seemed like the kids were interested and or moved too quickly. I have a sinking suspicion that this part of the movie, may have been underdeveloped for time and pacing. The part of Patrick Dempsey was one I could relate to. She didn't give him enough time and devoted all of her time to the students, but that was what she loved and she really made huge impact on thier lives.

1058958,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B000NOK1KC,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[3, 5]","PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE TITLE OF THIS REVIEW IS NOT A SPOILERHilary Swank does an impeccable job playing real-life teacher Erin Gruwell, whose first teaching job was at an inner-city school, largely populated by hard case young adults.This kind of movie has been done before, and before that, and even before that. Sandy Dennis did UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE 40 years ago, and FREEDOM WRITERS shows us not much has changed. Fortunately, FREEDOM WRITERS rises above the limitations of its genre by mostly sticking to the truth, and focusing less on Swank and more on the students (played by a cadre of unknown, intense ethnic actors whose personal histories parallel the actual Freedom Writers).Erin Gruwell comes to work just about bursting over with idealism and has a bucket of ice water thrown in her face when she is confronted with a largely minority but ethnically diverse classroom divided by gang rivalries and racial tensions. It soon becomes clear that traditional teaching is useless in this mileu. Gruwell is at a loss, until one day a student draws a racist caricature of another student and passes it around. The classroom nearly explodes. Gruwell gets angry, but rather than lambasting her students, begins to tell them about Nazism.The lesson resonates, and soon Gruwell expands on it, inviting Holocaust survivors to speak, arranging trips to civil rights sites, and having the class readAnne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. As part of her teaching technique, Gruwell requires each student to keep a journal, and soon these student journals (the original copies of which are used in the film) are filled with heartrending observations on domestic abuse, drug abuse, urban violence and gang life. ""War"" is the students' keyword. The journals eventually becomeThe Freedom Writers Diary: Movie-Tie-In: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. The misery of their day-to-day existence is portrayed without restraint. The sheer waste of young lives neglected to death by a society which has abandoned them, and abandoned its committments to positive social action, is an indictment for which we all must stand accused.Gruwell's gift is communication, and she is able to speak with these young men and women on their level, but without being condescending. As she works with her students, they become a family, often the only one some of these young people know. As ""Mrs. G.'s Class"" they find unity, safe harbor, and a doorway to the world beyond their enforced entrapment in the downward spiral of decay. Many of the Freedom Writers go on to College, the first in their communities to do so.The film is poignant and often searingly honest, but it does take a step down in portraying Erin Gruwell as virtually the only motivated teacher in her environment. She is shown as having no allies or friends among her colleagues. Lukewarm benign neglect by others in the school system becomes a form of surrogate support. Hate-mongering phone calls plague Erin Gruwell, and her fevered dedication to the Freedom Writers wrecks her marriage. Anti-Integration speeches by teachers younger than Brown v. Board of Education are both troubling and overobvious (and in some cases no doubt, true); while there are always a few myopic fools in any large group, the narrow careerist turf battles of some of the teachers are writ a bit too large (even though, these too go on); worst of all is the old battleaxe who charges into the Principal's Office all day every day to complain about the news coverage of The Freedom Writers as they evolve---her accusations of this all being a ""publicity stunt"" sound so dumb they almost have to be contrived. It seems logical that any teacher who gives her school as much positive exposure as Erin Gruwell manages to do should and would have far more support than the film shows her receiving. No teacher or administrator, not even the worst, would wish ill on students (whatever their backgrounds) honestly trying to excel. Perhaps that might have been true in some situations fifty years ago, but our society has changed enormously since the days of ""separate but equal."" Only the worst racists now use the ""N"" word.But for the ham-handed civil rights undertone, this film is wonderful and it should be required viewing, particularly in our schools. There are other Erin Gruwells out there. With encouragement (like this film) they will step forward.",4,"""Why did she have to die at the end? You didn't tell us she died!

Each of them in the class has already been subjected to violence in school and in their communities and they also confront peer segregation in the form of cliques or `tribes' as described by one student.Erin Gruwell, new to teaching and on unfamiliar ground, starts out by absorbing the abuse given by her students and eventually finds ways to break down the racial tension and communicate with them.  She is able to accomplish this even with the school principal and department head of English are not supporting her methods or acknowledging her successes.  On her own, Erin Gruwell works two extra part-time jobs to help pay for school books and other materials that she cannot get from her own administration.  So much of her time is spent on bettering her students that even her marriage begins to deteriorate.Beginning a new class project where everyone is to keep a journal and make daily entries, Erin Gruwell eventually reads the journals, with the approval of her students, and begins to connect with them even more in that she now understands the pain in their lives and hardships they have faced.  This also drives her to become even more influential in their education and give them hope and inspiration in becoming what they never thought they could.  The students in her class, some being the first in their families to ever graduate high school and then go to college, do just that.  They eventually call themselves Freedom Writers and they also put their journal entries together to create the `Freedom Writers Diary' which was published in 1999.I can remember 2 distinct movies before this that employed similar kinds of themes and they were `To Sir With Love' and `Dangerous Minds'.

1058968,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000NOK1KC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","""Freedom Writers"" neatly breaks down into three parts, of which the middle third is far away the best part of this 2006 film.  Two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank plays Erin Gruwell, a first time teacher who takes on a freshman English class at an integrated Long Beach high school in the wake of the L.A. riots.  Her class is divided into Latinos, Blacks and Cambodians, along with one white student who appears to be the only one not in the school's Honors class.  Her students are only there because otherwise they be in juvenile hall, her department head (Imelda Staunton) refuses to allow Erin's students to have any of the new books, her father (Scott Glen) is worried for her safety, and her husband (Patrick Dempsey) is not thrilled by the idea of Erin taking on extra jobs so she can do her job as a teacher.The first act of this movie really started to rub me the wrong way.  I understand that in these stories, which are almost always based on the true stories of real teachers, the neophyte teacher has to fail if not fail miserably before they succeed.  I found myself wondering if Erin had ever seen ""To Sir, With Love"" or any film about great teachers teaching those who do not want to be taught, because she cannot get anything over the plate.  I could think of lots of ways of making Homer relevant to those students (e.g., once upon a time there was this guy named Achilles, the best fighter in the world, and after he was disrespected by his boss he got so angry that he ended up getting his best friend killed and had to deal with the guilt: can you top that story based on your own life experiences?  Bet you can), and you do not explain internal rhyme using rap lyrics but get your students to explain it to you.  So this whole part of the film where Erin gets an ongoing hard lesson on what life is like in the trenches made me want to bang my head against the wall (plus I spent the entire film worried about her pearls, which I see the real Erin is still wearing in the photograph of the real Freedom Writers at the end).  The first act of ""The Ron Clark Story"" hit the mark much better in covering essentially the same ground.But then we get to the pivotal moment in the story, when Erin finds a racist cartoon drawing of one of her students and her anger gives her that crucial first step into their lives.  If anything we are enthralled first and her students have to catch up with us as Erin comes up with the idea of the student journals that become the basis for the class becoming known as the Freedom Writers.  This part where Erin discovers the secret of her success is as strong as any I have ever seen in one of these films.  If Act One is a ""C"", Act Two a solid ""A.""  Then we get to the final act of the drama, which earns a ""B"" at best.  The problem with the last act is that it takes place after the climax of the film, which is when the visitor the class brings to their school ends up inspiring Eva (April Lee Hernandez) to make an important choice.  We still have a half-hour to go in the movie and the final battle for Erin and her students just seems so damn petty given what the middle act was all about (Besides, while she is clearly more of a bureaucrat than a teacher, Erin's department head does raise some interesting points worth debating in the realm of education).When ""Schindler's List"" came out I was not as moved as others, and I realized that when it comes to depictions of the Holocaust that after the first time it really hits home with you everything that comes afterwards necessarily pales in comparison.  For me it was the television mini-series ""Holocaust,"" especially when I watched it a second time while editing out all of the commercials sitting in small room.  It did not matter that later on ""War and Remembrance,"" ""Schindler's List"" and other depictions would be more graphic.  That one hit home.  I am now wondering if the same sort of thing applies to movies in the inspirational teacher genre, where ""To Sir With Love"" and ""Up the Down Staircase"" still have power for me while newer versions such as ""Dangerous Minds"" and ""Freedom Writers"" do not.  It could simply be the whole idea of diminishing returns, at least for me, with this particular formula.  But if this movie from director Richard LaGravenese is one of your first exposures to this particular genre I doubt you will have any problems deciding to round up instead of round down on this one.",4,"The story of Erin Gruwell and her students, the Freedom Writers",1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,4433,"['Freedom', 'Writers', 'neatly', 'down', 'three', 'parts', 'middle', 'third', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'part', '2006', 'film', 'Two-time', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'first', 'time', 'teacher', 'who', 'freshman', 'English', 'class', 'integrated', 'Long', 'Beach', 'high', 'school', 'wake', 'L.A.', 'riots', 'class', 'divided', 'Latinos', 'Blacks', 'Cambodians', 'one', 'white', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'not', 'school', 'Honors', 'class', 'students', 'are', 'only', 'there', 'otherwise', 'be', 'juvenile', 'hall', 'department', 'head', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'allow', 'Erin', 'students', 'have', 'new', 'books', 'father', 'Scott', 'Glen', 'worried', 'safety', 'husband', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'not', 'thrilled', 'idea', 'Erin', 'taking', 'extra', 'jobs', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'teacher.The', 'first', 'act', 'movie', 'really', 'started', 'rub', 'wrong', 'way', 'understand', 'stories', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'real', 'teachers', 'neophyte', 'teacher', 'fail', 'not', 'fail', 'miserably', 'succeed', 'found', 'wondering', 'Erin', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'Sir', 'Love', 'film', 'great', 'teachers', 'teaching', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'taught', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'anything', 'plate', 'could', 'think', 'lots', 'ways', 'making', 'Homer', 'relevant', 'students', 'e.g.', 'once', 'time', 'was', 'guy', 'named', 'Achilles', 'best', 'fighter', 'world', 'was', 'disrespected', 'boss', 'got', 'so', 'angry', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'best', 'friend', 'killed', 'had', 'deal', 'guilt', 'can', 'top', 'story', 'based', 'own', 'life', 'experiences', 'can', 'do', 'not', 'explain', 'internal', 'rhyme', 'using', 'rap', 'lyrics', 'get', 'students', 'explain', 'whole', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'Erin', 'ongoing', 'hard', 'lesson', 'what', 'life', 'trenches', 'made', 'want', 'bang', 'head', 'wall', 'spent', 'entire', 'film', 'worried', 'pearls', 'see', 'real', 'Erin', 'still', 'wearing', 'photograph', 'real', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'Ron', 'Clark', 'Story', 'hit', 'mark', 'much', 'better', 'covering', 'essentially', 'same', 'ground.But', 'then', 'get', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'story', 'when', 'Erin', 'racist', 'cartoon', 'drawing', 'one', 'students', 'anger', 'crucial', 'first', 'step', 'lives', 'anything', 'are', 'enthralled', 'first', 'students', 'have', 'catch', 'up', 'Erin', 'up', 'idea', 'student', 'journals', 'become', 'basis', 'class', 'becoming', 'known', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'part', 'where', 'Erin', 'secret', 'success', 'as', 'strong', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'films', 'Act', 'One', 'C', 'Act', 'Two', 'solid', 'Then', 'get', 'final', 'act', 'drama', 'B', 'best', 'problem', 'last', 'act', 'place', 'climax', 'film', 'when', 'visitor', 'class', 'school', 'up', 'inspiring', 'Eva', 'April', 'Lee', 'Hernandez', 'make', 'important', 'choice', 'still', 'have', 'half-hour', 'go', 'movie', 'final', 'battle', 'Erin', 'students', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'petty', 'given', 'what', 'middle', 'act', 'was', 'Besides', 'clearly', 'more', 'bureaucrat', 'teacher', 'Erin', 'department', 'head', 'raise', 'interesting', 'points', 'worth', 'debating', 'realm', 'education', 'Schindler', 'List', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'moved', 'others', 'realized', 'when', 'depictions', 'Holocaust', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'home', 'everything', 'afterwards', 'necessarily', 'pales', 'comparison', 'was', 'television', 'mini-series', 'Holocaust', 'especially', 'when', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'editing', 'out', 'commercials', 'sitting', 'small', 'room', 'did', 'not', 'matter', 'later', 'War', 'Remembrance', 'Schindler', 'List', 'other', 'depictions', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'graphic', 'one', 'hit', 'home', 'am', 'now', 'wondering', 'same', 'sort', 'thing', 'applies', 'movies', 'inspirational', 'teacher', 'genre', 'where', 'Sir', 'Love', 'Down', 'Staircase', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'newer', 'versions', 'such', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'do', 'not', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'whole', 'idea', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'least', 'particular', 'formula', 'movie', 'director', 'Richard', 'LaGravenese', 'one', 'first', 'exposures', 'particular', 'genre', 'doubt', 'will', 'have', 'problems', 'deciding', 'round', 'up', 'instead', 'round', 'down', 'one']",N/A

This movie accomplished that- though watching this requires a suspension of disbelief.After the integration of this school in Long Beach, California, the tests scores of the formerly elite school declined. The white teachers complained about the black and Latino students who read on a 5th grade level and got into fights. The struggling students were placed in one remedial class. Erin Gruwell taught that class. Most of the students were members of gangs and/or had long rap sheets. In the class, cliques based on race were formed. There was one white kid in the class who clearly didn't want to be there.At first, the students didn't respect Erin. They thought she was just another white person who looked down on them. She went out of her way to gain their trust. Meanwhile, the administration, led by this older white lady, basically warehoused the kids. They didn't give them the proper resources since they figured the kids would steal or destroy them. Erin had to work two other jobs just to pay for books for her class. After a visit to the Holocaust Museum and a speech by an actual survivor, the kids started to listen to her.Ms. Gruwell became both a teacher and a surrogate mother to the kids. Throughout the entire movie, the administration opposed everything Ms. Gruwell did. Ms. Gruwell's endeavors also took a toll on her marriage. Her husband left her since he felt neglected. Some of the kids still had legal issues. This Latina girl (don't remember her name) was disowned by her community after she refused to lie about a shooting that occurred at a deli. Still, the kids eventually made it to graduation.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but it had MANY flaws:The kids were supposed to be 14 or 15, but most of them looked like they were 30How did Erin Gruwell have the time to work at her primary job, stay after school helping the kids, and then work two other jobs?Pretty much every white person other than Erin Gruwell was blatantly racist.At the end, it said that Erin Gruwell left the school when the kids graduated. I did some research. She's still in the teaching field. She runs a foundation that is meant to help minority students. Still, I'm disappointed that she left after only 4 yearsThis movie is worth watching because of its sentimental value, but it is far from realistic",3,Uplifting but unrealistic movie,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2425,"[""'m"", '28', 'year', 'old', 'black', 'male', 'was', 'looking', 'movie', 'showed', 'blacks', 'overcoming', 'odds', 'achieving', 'success', 'movie', 'accomplished', 'that-', 'watching', 'suspension', 'disbelief.After', 'integration', 'school', 'Long', 'Beach', 'California', 'tests', 'scores', 'formerly', 'elite', 'school', 'declined', 'white', 'teachers', 'complained', 'black', 'Latino', 'students', 'who', 'read', '5th', 'grade', 'level', 'got', 'fights', 'struggling', 'students', 'were', 'placed', 'one', 'remedial', 'class', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'taught', 'class', 'Most', 'students', 'were', 'members', 'gangs', 'and/or', 'had', 'long', 'rap', 'sheets', 'class', 'cliques', 'based', 'race', 'were', 'formed', 'was', 'one', 'white', 'kid', 'class', 'who', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there.At', 'first', 'students', 'did', ""n't"", 'respect', 'Erin', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'white', 'person', 'who', 'looked', 'down', 'went', 'way', 'gain', 'trust', 'Meanwhile', 'administration', 'led', 'older', 'white', 'lady', 'basically', 'warehoused', 'kids', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'proper', 'resources', 'figured', 'kids', 'would', 'steal', 'destroy', 'Erin', 'had', 'work', 'two', 'other', 'jobs', 'just', 'pay', 'books', 'class', 'visit', 'Holocaust', 'Museum', 'speech', 'actual', 'survivor', 'kids', 'started', 'listen', 'her.Ms', 'Gruwell', 'became', 'teacher', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'kids', 'entire', 'movie', 'administration', 'opposed', 'everything', 'Ms.', 'Gruwell', 'did', 'Ms.', 'Gruwell', 'endeavors', 'also', 'took', 'toll', 'marriage', 'husband', 'left', 'felt', 'neglected', 'kids', 'still', 'had', 'legal', 'issues', 'Latina', 'girl', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'was', 'disowned', 'community', 'refused', 'lie', 'shooting', 'occurred', 'deli', 'Still', 'kids', 'eventually', 'made', 'graduation.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'had', 'MANY', 'flaws', 'kids', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', '14', '15', 'most', 'looked', 'were', '30How', 'did', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'have', 'time', 'work', 'primary', 'job', 'stay', 'school', 'helping', 'kids', 'then', 'work', 'two', 'other', 'jobs', 'Pretty', 'much', 'white', 'person', 'other', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'was', 'blatantly', 'end', 'said', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'left', 'school', 'when', 'kids', 'graduated', 'did', 'research', 'still', 'teaching', 'field', 'foundation', 'meant', 'help', 'minority', 'students', 'Still', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'left', 'only', '4', 'yearsThis', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'sentimental', 'value', 'far', 'realistic']",N/A

Not because it's sad (although there are a few sad parts here and there), but because it's so moving and heart warming.  It took me too long to get around to watching this and I'm sorry for that, but now that I've seen it, it's definately a new favourite of mine and I thoroughly enjoyed it.It's based on fact and what a teacher, Erin Gruwell, does to turn around a class of kids who seem helpless.  It's far better than Higher Learning or Dangerous Minds.  It's got a fantastic cast in it and they all did such a great job.  Hillary's character starts out a little niave because she thinks from the start that it's going to be a piece of cake to teach this class English.  However, soon after they arrive at the first lesson, she sees it's going to be an uphill battle.  A little on in the movie, after she sees a drawing someone drew of a black student, she begins to get them thinking about how these actions can take their toll, by refering to the way Jews were drawn in newspaper cartoons back in the beginning of the Nazi uprise.  These kids have never heard of the Holocaust and she overtime, helps them see what Jews faced when the Nazi's took over Germany and other parts of Europe (she takes them to the Simon Weisenthal Museum of Tolorance) and she plays games with them where they divide into two sides of the room and come to the center of the room for each thing they have in common (such as whether they've lost someone they love in gang violence, or whether they have the same music taste).  Soon they see that it doesn't matter if they are Black, White, Hispanic or Cambodian - they are all so similar in so many ways and they shouldn't let race divide them.You HAVE to see this brilliant movie.  It's so uplifting and moving, that you'll no doubt love it as much as I did.  It's such a powerful movie and ALL school kids across the world should be made to watch this in classes at school.

Oh my, I'm going to be sick just thinking about this message this movie excretes to the viewer.Then let's get to the dialogue: As I said, I am a high school teacher, and I can tell you firsthand that NONE of the idiotic, cartoony, bonzo-racist and hyperbolically scornful dialogue that ALL other teachers in this movie spout (except for the angelic idealist heroine)--I say NONE of that kind of poorly scripted talk EVER comes out of the mouth of ANY teacher.

It just was horribly written, utterly unrealistic dialogue.Then there's the idealist heroine's husband in this movie: He's a eunuch; an utter metrosexual wimp. His wife shows utter disdain for his wishes; his wife doesn't listen to a word he has to say; his wife slaughters herself for her idiotic job of chasing-after-the-wind futility (which it would be in real life); and then, when the husband FINALLY stands up for himself, remembers he's a man, packs his bags, and rightfully pursues a divorce from this woman who doesn't respect him, then HE'S considered the jerk by this sexist, out-of-touch film-maker. Yikes!And then let's talk about some of the situations that occur in this movie between the idealistic heroine teacher and her cartoonily-propagandized student characters: Let's just bring up but one example among many: #1) There is one scene where the idealist heroine teacher talks to a male student after having closed the door behind her, leaving her and the male student alone in a small room. Well folks, let me tell you: This doesn't happen, unless a teacher is screaming to be fired from her job. Everybody's scared to DEATH of sexual harrassment lawsuits these days, ESPECIALLY in gov't schools, and lawyers are petty chieftains who LOVE to have students come report such a thing to them that a teacher closed the door behind them and had them alone in a room. Ha! Only a writer who knew NOTHING about the REALITY of the working conditions in a gov't school system could have included this in his screenplay; yet again, in this SAME scene, there is MORE to scream NO! NO! NO! about: AFTER this idealist female teacher closes the door and gets all alone and cozy with this male student, she attempts to movitate said student to perform better by making a vulgar slang statement about his GENITALS!!! Arggggghhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you IMAGINE what the critics and the public would do to this movie if the sex roles were reversed, and it was a male teacher, and a female student, and the male teacher had just attempted to motivate the female student to perform better by referring to her female genitalia!!!!!!?????? Ahhhhh!!!!! This movie would be pulled from distribution immediately, such is the BLATANT sexual discrimination in our society, and in this ugly, sexist, awful, stinker of an agenda-laden rotten movie.One last thing: the idealist heroine teacher keeps trying to make a connection between the plight of her young gang-banger students with the Holocaust of WWII. Indeed, this is a major theme to the movie. Trouble is, the comparison is grossly overstretched and just a bit hackneyed by now, don't you think?And that's just it: Don't Americans THINK anymore? At all? Or are we so dumbed down as a society in America that this lousy stinking rotter of a sexist poorly written movie can pass for quality realism??!! Think I'm going to vomit. This was really that bad. Just utterly lousy stinking awful and insulting.I say all this as a teacher, and a very idealistic one at that.This is another one of a long line of (deliberately?) misguided movies about idealistic teachers slaughtering themselves trying to buck the system at the harmlessly low level of the classroom, rather than doing a little research into just why the system is so corrupt at the highest levels, and then trying to fight the system at the highest levels, where the spider really has its lair and is fattening itself on the carcasses of prematurely burnt out, idiotic idealist teachers who slaughter themselves needlessly over their jobs. Read Charlotte Iserbyt's ""The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America"" or Rene Wurmser's ""Foundations: Their Power and Influence"" if you want to know what's really wrong with the gov't school system.One final complaint (I can't resist): Where are all the other students? Why does it only show this teacher with 20 students all day everyday? What about all her other classes? Did she really work 2 extra jobs to pay for her first job like a fool while reading 150 journals a night like a real-life teacher would? Hollywood has NO clue what the job of a public school teacher is like. None. And this film-maker is pure Hollywood, nothing else.",1,A Grossly Insulting Piece of Propaganda Designed to Keep Teachers Enslaved,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,5785,"[""'m"", 'high', 'school',

As often it was an amazing spread from people claiming it changed their lives forever to others using it to express radical views on the holocaust, jews, Hollywood, the teaching profession etc.Let me first of all say I found it a thoroughly delightful movie with excellent acting performances particularly by several of the talented kids. Many point out the theme is not at all new which I can of course only concur. Others felt it was depicting a too rosy unrealistic view on the reality in the schools of the troubled neighborhoods in the US inner cities - for sure for the majority of all students someone like HilarySwanks character is nothing but a distant dream. Yet others took personal offense to the fact that she took on additional jobs to pay for the kids  she felt were in most dire need.... clearly it IS sad that some countries and societies do not provide sufficient resources for those in most dire need.....All well and good but in my mind we should look beyond all these obviousconclusions and instead focus on what we all can do individually to make even the smallest contribution for the greater good and those in need. A movie like this based on a real story should inspire us all to once in a while take the foot off our personal consumption accelerator and spend a bit of time and money on others and through this realize how rewarding giving compared to taking truly can be. In what often seems as dark times learning of what other people have done, big or small, should extend us with a bit of much needed inspiration and lend us a glimmer of hope for the future.In the current US presidential campaigns one of the two candidates talks about making good education and health care universally available in US (as it is in most of the rest of the so called developed world) and urges all to  take a role in making this happen... this is of course immediately shot down as socialism... as a dedicated capitalist myself I see that not as socialism but merely humanism and can only repeat that stories like this one provides inspiration for such a quest ... lets hope he is given a chance to show he can in fact deliver on his beautiful ideas and will live to see them through.

Even fewer films have the power to help save your life. Well 'Freedom Writers' might very well be one of a very small handful of films that could very well help change and save thousands of lives. The film does so by painting a convincing portrait of what it is like living as a teenager in the very real world of gang violence and poverty. Black, Hispanic, Cambodian, white teenagers are forced to attend the same classes together in this Los Angeles war zone, and they hate one another. Hillary Swank turns in an incredible, unforgettable performance as a first time teacher who get's a job at a high school in the middle of gangland Los Angeles teaching a group of tough kids. Amazingly, every student actor in this film turn in near oscar caliber performances. They were all excellent, and that is part of what makes this film work. When their teacher(Swank) begins to take a serious interest in her students, she must fight the establishment to help these kids. These teens are tough and hard at heart, but really all they need is someone to care for and believe in them, and she helps them find the courage to change. Sound pretty hokey?

1059014,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000NOK1KC,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","""Freedom Writers"" is a film that really shouldn't work but somehow does. After all, it's been over fifty years since ""The Blackboard Jungle"" drew up the blueprint that all future ""super teacher"" dramas would feel called upon to follow. The formula goes something like this: a young, hopelessly naive idealist from a privileged background, filled with romantic notions about molding young minds and saving the world, is rudely thrust into an inner city classroom overflowing with recalcitrant troublemakers and streetwise thugs whom all the other faculty members and school board big wigs have written off as incapable of learning. After a few sessions in which the students run roughshod over the touchy-feely, ill-prepared newcomer, the teacher inevitably achieves a breakthrough by reaching the kids ""where they're at,"" eventually turning them all into model citizens no longer cognizant of socioeconomic or racial barriers and all ready to move ahead and make something of their lives. Inevitably, the teacher becomes a role model for the youngsters, one who has to fight a constant, solitary battle against the other burnt-out faculty members, administrators and school district bureaucrats who have long ago given up expecting the kids to learn and feel that if they are simply able to ""warehouse"" them and keep them from killing one another in the hallways, they are fulfilling their responsibilities as faithful stewards of the taxpayers' money.Given its slavish adherence to the formula, it's hard not to be cynical about a movie like ""Freedom Writers,"" but damned if the whole thing doesn't worm its way into our affections despite all our best efforts to resist it (maybe some formulas ARE formulas for the simple reason that they actually work). The movie is based on an actual English teacher named Erin Gruwell, who arrived at Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, Ca., in the fall of 1993. Faced with a class full of hostile African-American, Asian and Hispanic gang members, Gruwell eventually broke down their resistance and got them interested in learning by having them write personal journals in which they poured out their innermost thoughts, concerns and feelings about their lives and the world in which they lived. This led to a publication of the students' writing and the setting up of a foundation dedicated to helping inspire other inner city kids to stay in school and reach for the stars.It is the initial journal entries that serve as the source for much of the screenplay, and writer/director Richard LaGravenese has wisely chosen to showcase their entries in the form of voice-over narration. More than anything else, it is this device that lends the film the depth it might otherwise lack and that lifts it above the clich&eacute;s of the genre. The other key element in the film's success is the uniformly excellent work turned in by the actors and actresses playing the youngsters. Each and every one of them has a natural and believable way about them that draws us into the lives of the characters they are portraying. Particular notice should be paid to April L. Hernandez and Deance Wyatt who are genuine standouts in a truly impressive ensemble cast. Hillary Swank does well in the role of Gruwell, but it is a measure of the casts' talent here that she is often upstaged by the youngsters. I can imagine this film serving as the launching pad for quite a few impressive careers in the future.The movie acknowledges the downside of Gruwell's nobility and dedication by chronicling the negative effect the job has on her marriage and home life, but these scenes aren't dramatized in a particularly convincing way, so all they really succeed in doing is slowing down the action and diluting the impact of the teacher/student relationships (Patrick Demsey and Scott Glenn are also largely wasted in the roles of Gruwell's less-than-supportive husband and father respectively). Moreover, the other faculty members are little more than straw man caricatures whose sole purpose is to serve as foils against which Gruwell's nobility can stand out all the more impressively. (The wonderful Imelda Staunton does, however, manage to imbue her stereotype of the bitter, nay-saying educator with a surprising amount of depth and humanity). Gruwell's experience with these youngsters is compelling enough in its own right without having to stack the deck against her unnecessarily and reducing everyone else to the level of callous villain just to make the point.It's true that anyone who has seen ""To Sir With Love,"" ""Up the Down Staircase,"" ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""Dangerous Minds"" - or any of the countless other ""Blackboard Jungle"" knockoffs that have come our way over the years - will not be surprised by much that happens in ""Freedom Writers,"" but there are many genuinely touching moments in the movie, especially those involving a field trip the kids take to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, their reading of ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" and their meeting with the actual woman (here played by movie veteran Pat Carroll) who helped to hide the Franks and others from the Nazis.The movie does hint at one further potential dark side to the ""super teacher"" phenomenon. At the end of the movie, we are informed that Gruwell followed her students throughout their four years of high school, then took a job as a teacher at a local college. One wonders why, if this was such a ""calling"" for Gruwell, she didn't ultimately stick with the profession beyond the initial four years. Could it be that such teachers are like dazzling supernovas that blaze brightly for a season then burn themselves out, leaving the duller but steadier stars to light the way for future students? Sad to say, that may just be the one unintended message audiences will take away from the movie.",4,succeeds despite the cliches,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,5810,"['Freedom', 'Writers', 'film',

1059018,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000NOK1KC,Sean Pasek,"[1, 1]","Freedom Writers is an inspirational film with some edge.  I'm glad the writers decided not to tone down the story too much, as most of the students came from ""gang"" environments, and the film showcases this with some scenes of gang violence.  This actually makes the journey they take together all the more powerful because most of the students shown here are kids on the verge of ending up in jail or dead.One thing that makes this movie work so well, is that the film has many powerful and touching moments in it.  It isn't as formulaic in which the ""big, powerful moment"" only comes at the end.Freedom Writers tells a true story of young Ellen Gruwell who is in her very first year of teaching at Wilson High School in Long Beach, California.  She's eager and can't wait to get into the classroom.  Being a teacher myself, I understand this enthusiasm.  She finds herself amidst a number of Latino, African-American, and Asian students.  Oh yeah, there's one caucasian student who, throughout the first half of the film, wishes he was anywhere else but there.Ellen's first attempts to teach them anything fails.  She can scarcely get their attention, much less teach them anything.  These are the kids who have beent thrown into classrooms.  Nobody really thinks they can do anything, and nobody else really cares if they succeed or not.  One teacher tells Ellen, ""If you can teach them some obedience and discipline, then you will have made a tremendous accomplishment.""  This isn't near enough ""accomplishment"" for Ellen.  Despite being mistreated by most of the students, Ellen has something that even the students don't have: faith.  She feels it in her bones that these kids can succeed.Ellen's first hurdle is to gain the respect of the students.  Most of them feel that she can never understand who they are, the lives they lead, and why they feel that life is all but hopeless for them.  Ellen uses the example of the holocaust to finally begin to peak some interest in the class.  Many of the students feel that they are living out their own version of the holocaust, since many of them pray that they will live to reach adulthood.  She even takes them to a museum about the holocaust, and has some holocaust survivors speak to the students about their experiences (played in the film by actual holocaust survivors).  This begins to have a very powerful and profound effect as the students begin to look within themselves.However, Ellen's idea of creating a journal for the students was brilliant.  Most people don't realize that writing is a very healing activity.  Ellen gives them the freedom to write whatever they want.  There are no requirements.  If the students want her to read the journals (which isn't required) they can discreetly leave them in a cabinet in the classroom.  Ellen probably thought she would be lucky to find even one journal there. However, she opens up the cabinet to find that the whole class has left their journals there for her to read.  She finds herself learning and understanding her students in a very deep and personal way as the journals offer her a connection.As a consequence, both Ellen and her students begin to develop a bond.  Ellen creates a safe environment for them.  Racial barriers quickly begin to fade, as each student realizes that they are not all that different from each other.  Even the white student soon finds himself accepted and among friends as the hate and anger are replaced with tolerance, friendship, and understanding.Hilary Swank is one of the best actresses today.  She has such range with her abilities from ""Boys Don't Cry"" to ""Million Dollar Baby.""  Swank brings Ellen Gruwell to life without making Gruwell seem larger than life.  Gruwell has her own battles to fight, including getting two extra jobs so she can buy books and other things for her students.  Swank is also able to bring Gruwell's naivety about teaching to light.Imelda Stanton, one of the best character actresses in the business, is brilliant as Mrs. Campbell.  She's a woman who has been teaching for nearly 30 years.  She feels slighted that a woman with minimal teaching experience can come in and make a difference.  And yet, sometimes it isn't the experience that is needed as much as the belief and faith in the students.  I've seen teachers who have taught for a number of years who have lost that faith.  They've given up.  They simply go through the motions and try to get through a day.  Mrs. Campbell embodies these teachers, and Stanton does this extremely well.One of the most powerful moments in this film is when, after reading the ""Diary of Anne Frank,"" the students want to meet the woman who hid Anne Frank.  They hold fundraisers to earn enough money to send for her.  She shows up and shares her experience.  When one student stands up and says, ""You are my hero.""  She quickly turns things around as an opportunity to empower these kids.  ""No, YOU are the heroes,"" she says.  ""Just because you are teenagers doesn't mean you can't be a small light in the darkness.""Ellen Gruwell gives everything of herself for these kids.  She believes in them, even when nobody else does; not even members of their own families.  Her dedication and devotion to them costs her her marriage.  And despite the abuse she takes in the beginning, she never, NEVER loses her focus or her zeal and enthusiasm to teach and believe in her students.""Freedom Writers"" is a tremendous film about an extraordinary teacher with extraordinary students.  Perhaps it demonstrates that what these kids want more than anything else, is for someone to believe in them; for someone to be a beacon and show them that they can change; that they can make different choices and that it is never too late.Everyone can be a small light in the darkness.  Ellen Gruwell is certainly that.",5,Freedom Writers Is a Small Light in the Darkness,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,5817,"['Freedom', 'Writers', 'inspirational', 'film', 'edge', ""'m"", 'glad',

1059021,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B000NOK1KC,Steven Aldersley,"[3, 3]","Freedom Writers (drama, biography, crime)Directed by Richard LaGraveneseStarring Hilary Swank, Patrick Dempsey, Imelda Staunton and Scott GlennParamount Pictures | 2007 | 122 min | Rated PG-13 | Released May 22, 2007Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.85:1Audio:English: Dolby Digital 5.1French: Dolby Digital 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles:English, English SDH, French, SpanishDisc:Single 50GB Blu-ray DiscThe Film 4.5/5It's unlikely that many people know about Freedom Writers. The title makes it sound boring; how can writing be an exciting spectacle? The other problem is the first 30 minutes of the movie. It's almost exactly what you would expect and covers familiar ground. There's a chance it would lose viewers who think that the whole movie is going to be predictable.It isn't.The movie opens with riot scenes in Los Angeles and we hear a brief narration from one of the key characters, Eva (April Lee Hernandez). It shows her father being wrongly-convicted of a crime. This event confirms in her mind that she is right to hate all white people (as the cops were white) and anyone from another culture. She's a member of a gang and happy with her role in life.Then we meet Erin Gruwell (Swank), who is a first-time teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School. She teaches English and is naive about what she'll face in the classroom. She believes that none of the rules apply to her because she cares, and that she can succeed where everyone else has failed. She thinks she can change the world. The movie is based on a true story and the real Erin Gruwell is interviewed for the movie's special features.Gruwell's first day is a rough one. The desks and books she has to work with are old and falling apart and a fight breaks out during her first lesson. The class is divided into groups: there's one white kid and groups of black, Latino and Cambodian kids. They hate each other and don't want to sit near anyone not in their ethnic group.How do you go about breaking down those boundaries? It's no different outside the classroom. There's division and hatred everywhere.Gruwell starts to think of ways to connect with the kids. She starts by trying music, thinking it could unite them. Then she changes the seating arrangements and breaks up the groups. Some of the students stop attending.There's an incident in a local store one night in which Eva witnesses a murder. Her culture requires her to lie and blame someone else. The resolution is an important part of the movie, but I won't reveal it here.So we're 30 minutes into the story and all we have seen is a fairly predictable setup. But stick with it. This is where things start to improve. The power of the story is in the methods Gruwell uses to unite these kids. A drawing is passed around in class, showing a kid with big lips. Everyone laughs, apart from the target of the joke. Gruwell is outraged and compares the drawing to the drawings of Jews made by the Nazi's, calling the Nazi's the greatest gang of all time. She mentions the Holocaust and someone asks what it was. She's shocked and discovers that only one student has heard of it.Think about that for a moment. How would you try and connect with people who had such limited knowledge? Their immediate world is dangerous and that's all that they care about. Living another day is a little victory for them. She asks anyone who has been shot at to raise their hand and almost everyone does.Next class, she tapes a line in the middle of the classroom floor. She makes a game of it by asking people to step up to the line if they answer yes to a series of questions. The questions become increasingly serious: Do you know someone in a gang? Who has lost someone to gang violence? More than one? Some have lost four or more. The different ethnic groups step up to the line and stare at those opposite them. These people do have something in common after all.Her colleagues won't let her give the kids new books because they will likely destroy them, but Gruwell takes a second job and buys them anyway. She gives each student a journal, on the condition that they write in it every day. She won't read it unless they give permission, but there's a secure cupboard to put it in if anyone does want her to read what they have written. Her husband isn't happy that she's taken a second job and is sick of hearing about what she does at school.Parents' night arrives and nobody shows. She's about to leave, but checks the cupboard first. It's full of journals. We are gradually shown the stories behind many of the kids and what they have to live with each day. It's probably the first time they have ever opened up to anybody. The stories are powerful and feel real. She gains a deeper understanding of her students.The kids are awed when she presents them with new books. Then she arranges a school trip, but has to take a weekend job to finance it herself. Her husband is even more unhappy. The trip is to a museum commemorating the Holocaust. Her father goes with her and the kids all behave. The museum experience touches them deeply when they see how many died. Many of the victims were just a few years old. It's important for them to see where their actions might lead and how misguided their reasoning is. She definitely makes a connection.I have found that if you give someone with a bad reputation a chance to be a better person, they usually respond positively. That's exactly what happens in Freedom Writers.It would be wrong of me to outline the entire story, but I wanted to go into enough depth to describe just how powerful and important this movie is. Gruwell achieved something significant, and you'll see the impact she had if you watch the movie. Her methods have been widely introduced in schools throughout America.It's incredible to see what can be achieved when people work together instead of wasting their time hating others. Racism is one of the biggest problems in today's world. Although there have been improvements, there's a long way to go. What is the answer? It's easy to say that the problem is too vast to ever be eradicated, but people like Gruwell have made a tiny dent by refusing to give up.How do you unite the entire world when it's divided by wealth, religion and politics? I'm not sure it will ever happen, but almost anything would be possible if it could be done. Maybe if the human race was threatened by malevolent aliens and was forced to work together? It has to start somewhere. What better place than in schools? It's not easy because patterns of behavior become ingrained and older generations pass on their beliefs to their children.Swank was superb in the role of Erin Gruwell. I'm always impressed by her acting, but I think this is my favorite role of hers. Freedom Writers is an uplifting film and inspires hope and change. The actors playing the students had very little experience and were chosen because their lives were similar to those depicted in the movie. I think they did a great job and a few will go on to better things.I think I've watched Freedom Writers four times this year. Don't be put off by the title or the first 30 minutes. If you like drama, this is one of the best you're likely to see.Video Quality 4/5The Blu-ray was released in 2007, but it looks pretty good. The image is damage-free, bright, and has good detail throughout. It doesn't match some of the recent releases, but there's no reason to complain about the picture quality.Audio Quality 3.5/5The dated Dolby Digital 5.1 track sounds about as good as a compressed audio track can. Music is heavily featured and comes across well. Dialogue is clear and the surrounds are frequently used during scenes portraying conflict. Don't avoid this release just because it doesn't have lossless audio.Special Features 3/5All of the special features are in standard definition with the exception of the theatrical trailer.Commentary with Richard LaGravenese and Hilary SwankDeleted Scenes (11:01) - There's a few good scenes which should have made it into the film. One is a class trip to see Schindler's List and kicks off a sequence which ends in a restaurant. It shows how supportive Gruwell's father became.Making a Dream (5:25) - Showing how the main theme song was created and how the movie affected the creators.Freedom Writers Family (19:21) - Director and cast talking about the script and how their trip to the Museum of Tolerance helped them bond.Freedom Writers: The Story Behind the Story (10:03) - Director, cast and crew are joined by the real Erin Gruwell and talk about the situation in Long Beach.Trailer (2:31)Freedom Writers is a rewarding movie for anyone who likes emotional drama. Swank and the young cast draw you in and it's hard not to empathize with their situations. This should be mandatory viewing in schools and would be a valuable part of any lesson plan for teachers. It's also an important movie with a strong message. Just viewing it could have an impact on the way you view the world and make a tiny difference in the fight against racism. I hope that you give it a try.The Blu-ray is out of print, but still easy to track down. Don't wait too long to pick it up if you end up liking the story.Overall score 4/5",4,Much more interesting than it sounds,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,9239,"['Freedom', 'Writers', 'drama',

1059022,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000NOK1KC,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[71, 77]","**A few spoilers in this review**Amazon's has it all right in their comments on this underrated, wonderfully acted, and fair treatment of our current education system that all too often gives up on what it considers the ""undesirables"" present in every school, the teachers who think that they know it all (both villain and heroine in this film), and the kids who believe that they have no reason to even try to prove others wrong.The dialogue is blisteringly realistic, sensitive, insightful, and painfully honest most of the time.  In many ways there are no real villains in this film although there are two specific teachers who attempt to give Swank's character difficulty either because she is attempting to succeed where others have failed, or because she thinks she is better than others or has the key to her students' success if others would just get out of her way.  It's easy to see the veteran teachers' resentment for Swank as Gruwell.  She is brash, naive, overconfident, obsessive, and appears to want to outshine her colleagues although that really isn't her intent, but one can see how a veteran teacher would see her as a threat to their status which they feel, and rightly so to some degree, have earned.  Simply because these older veteran teachers may not be as ""on fire"" as Gruwell, who is new to the profession, doesn't mean they aren't still dedicated.  In their defense, Gruwell really does just dismiss their experience, expertise, and dedication to the education profession because they have become a bit more jaded by their life experiences in this profession.  She does come off rather self-righteous at the wrong times such as when she's actually seeking help.  Talk about ironic.As a 17 year veteran teacher myself I understand those veteran teachers in the film, but I also recall being Gruwell's age with all its enthusiasm, shakey confidence, and out to prove something mentality.  I have greatly learned to appreciate and love the new teachers that come into my school because they have the opportunity to succeed where I may have failed and the students will benefit from that, but it does have its pains too.  I know that that glorious time is somewhat behind me now and passing the torch is hard.  It's also hard to see one's own light diminishing while another is being lit.  I think younger teachers need to be sensitive to that and Swank's character, Gruwell, is rather harsh and judgmental to those that don't ""get"" her style.  In fact, she is so harsh that her single-minded focus doesn't let her feel others' emotional pain that her success is causing.  She appears to only be focused on her mission and her kids and while that can be praiseworthy, it can be narrow-minded and heartless too.  Sadly, her obsessive nature causes her marriage to collapse.  She NEVER sees that coming and that is all the more sad as it shows how clueless she is regarding her own actions while so easily condeming others.  In the end, neither Gruwell or her husband really comes off as the ""bad guy"" at the end of that relationship although people are bound to take sides.  I think he's pretty shallow and weak for not standing up for himself or his marriage more until it hits a point of no return.  There is plenty of fault to go around.This is compelling film making and my wife and I talked for hours after viewing this film as she recalls my early days in education and how I am now after years of battling and bowing to belligerent parents who never believe their kid could do any wrong, abusive and manipulative students who know the system is mostly on their side now, condescending administrators who believe they have the answers when they are no longer even in the classroom environment, and demonizing politicians who always see us as the reason for all the ills in society.  To add insult to injury after many years of dedication, new young teachers often come in displaying little respect to veterans as they see others not giving us respect.  It's sad that they so often don't see their futures in us.I praise new young teachers like Gruwell and world experienced but new teachers like Jamie Escalante (Stand and Deliver) and all such teachers who battle the odds to make a difference in the lives of their students.  If anyone gets anything out of this film, I would hope it's a sense that all deserve respect.  Films in this genre all too typically demonize the veteran teachers as has-beens who have just given up, praise the young upstart regardless of their flawed attitude at times, and put students on the same playing field as adults which they are not.  This film breaks this genre's stereotypes quite a bit.  I felt sincerely sorry for the disenchanted and disrespected veterans even though they were combative and jealous.  I felt great respect and empathy for the young new teacher, Gruwell, for trying to make a positive change, but upset with her condescending and self-absorbed, callous attitude at times toward her colleagues and husband.  I, lastly, felt great compassion for the students portrayed in this film who all too often society feels are ""throwaways.""This is the kind of film that lingers in your mind long after the viewing of it is over.  This film is worth renting if not owning.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 2]","Hilary Swank's name is above the title on this heartwarming film but the REAL stars are the kids in her class. Swank was also the (well, one of the) Executive Producers for the film and she's the one who shepherded it through the studio system.Part of the genre that includes To Sir With Love, Mr. Holland's Opus, and Goodbye Mr. Chips (plus many more I could mention) the plot is by formula and you know up front that the kids will succeed (unlike Stand and Deliver), but, with the great acting by the students (none of who you have ever heard of) you will find a tear coming to your eye more than once. And the soundtrack by Mark Isham and Will.i.am  is super!There are a bunch of bonus features which are featurettes - most repeating scenes from the film. The most interesting are when they concentrate on the real life teacher Erin Gruwell (Swank's role in the film), and we see that she doesn't look much different than Swank (though no one - except Julia Roberts - has the puffy lips that Swank has.).No, this is not Oscar material but it's a good family film to watch with you teenage kids. And it can lead to some interesting discussions.The only annoying thing I found in the film was the way Gruwell's husband (played by Patrick Dempsey) is handled. He just leaves her when she is so wrapped up in her work and is never seen again. Nor is he mentioned in the real life featurettes on Grunwell.

1059028,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000NOK1KC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[24, 41]","There are certain genres of film that should be retired until they come up with a completely original story. Case and point: The ""Inspirational Teacher"" genre has been around for decades and recently we have seen one or more of these stories every year, most often in January. ""Freedom Writers"", the new film starring Hilary Swank is the latest entry. It is not an original film, but it does manage to tell a moving story.Erin Gruwell (Swank) arrives at a Long Beach high school ready to teach Freshman English shortly after the Rodney King verdict and riots. Fresh faced and ready to make a difference, she meets with Mrs. Campbell (Imelda Staunton, ""Vera Drake""), the head of the English Department, who is bemused by Erin's eagerness. Her only words of encouragement are to advise Erin to not wear her pearl necklace to class. On her first day, Erin learns she is in over her head; the students segregate themselves staring at classmates of other ethnicities with hatred, they won't listen, they cut class, it is chaos. After a few abortive attempts, Erin comes upon an idea. She provides blank notebooks for all of the students to write in, to write about anything and everything, as long as they write. She won't even read the books unless they place them in a locked cupboard. One night, she checks the cabinet and finds all of the notebooks and begins reading, learning the stories of the struggles her students face every day. Encouraged, she tries to come up with ways to bring the students together and to ease the racial tension. Erin's husband, Scott (Patrick Dempsey) is amazed when Erin announces she is going to take a second, and then third part time job to pay for the supplies she needs to teach. When will they have time for each other? Her father (Scott Glenn), a former activist, is concerned for her safety but soon witnesses the effect she is having. Will she be able to make a change in their lives?Written and directed by Richard LaGravenese (writer of ""The Fisher King"", ""The Bridges of Madison County""), I was, frankly, expecting more from ""Freedom Writers"". But the film, co-produced by MTV (as was ""Coach Carter"", last January's entry), represents a project that will certainly entertain the network's core audience.The power of ""Freedom Writers"" comes in how Erin gets through to these students. When a student passes around a drawing of another student, emphasizing a racial stereotype, the new teacher looks at the drawing and begins making parallels between it and the Holocaust. She makes a very persuasive argument. As Erin becomes fired up, she talks about the Nazis, their quest for a pure blood race, the internment camps, the invasions of other countries and what all of this meant to Jewish people. Then, one student raises his hand and asks ""What was the Holocaust?"" Erin asks for a show of hands and only one student has ever heard of the Holocaust, the one Caucasian student in her class.Hilary Swank does an adequate job of bringing the teacher to life. Ready to make a change, she wants to be a teacher, despite the low salary. When she realizes the high school is more of a battleground, she is surprised but undeterred. If she can reach only one student, it will be worth it. So she begins to put everything into the job. She wants to give the students real books, but Mrs. Campbell (Staunton) wants to protect her inventory so she only lets the students have workbooks. Undeterred, Erin buys them books and takes a part time job to pay for them. Then, she decides she will take them on a field trip. But there's no money, so Erin takes a second part time job to pay for the trips. Swank portrays the character's eagerness and drive well. But was there anything else?Because her entire being is about teaching these students, the most drama derives from her relationship with them. In a film of this nature, some of the students are going to stand out more than others. Early on, Eva (April Hernandez) states she hates Erin, hates all white people, for what they have done. Eva watched her father get arrested by the police, white police, for a crime he didn't commit. She visits him in prison and attends school as a result of her own probation. I wonder what will happen to her character during the course of the film? Jamal (Deance Wyatt) is destined to become a drug dealer; they approach him all the time offering a lot of money for little work. With little parental supervision - his mother can't even look at him since his older brother has been jailed- his destiny seems assured. Then, he meets Erin. But will Erin be able to reach him?Patrick Dempsey pays his movie dues by playing Erin's increasingly neglected husband, Scott. Dempsey was once a movie star and faded from public view until some entertainment rag coined the term ""McDreamy"". Now that he is on a bonafide hit television show, the Comeback gods insist he take a series of supporting roles until he earns his place as Reese Witherspoon or Jennifer Garner's film boyfriend. Scott is a pretty thankless role; he has to appear at key moments looking annoyed or put upon because Erin is spending so much time with her students. Because what Erin is doing is so good, she has to be `martyred' for her to become a saint. And there is only one way for a young, married woman to become martyred in a Hollywood film. D-I-V-O-R-C-E.""Freedom Writers"" is a perfectly acceptable film. No doubt you will feel for some of Erin's students, as I did.

Some may remember ""Dangerous Minds"" and ""Take the Lead."" ""Freedom Writers,"" inspirational story based on the real life of Erin Gruwell, follows the struggles of the young teacher who encourages the unruly students in her English class to overcome their racial prejudices and respect the lives of others by giving them one assignment -- writing journals.The plot itself is a rather predictable one, but that is not a big problem. For all its formulaic story, the film is made with sincerity and has surprisingly tense moments too. Imelda Staunton (""Vera Drake"") appears as fellow teacher criticizing Erin's method, but despite her solid acting, her character is one-dimensional.It may be Hilary Swank's name that would attract most of the viewers, but I for one am quite more impressed with the younger cast of ""Freedom Writers"" including April Lee Hernandez and Mario. This is not to say Ms. Swank's acting is ineffective, but I sincerely wish that writer-turned-director Richard LaGravenese (his most famous work as writer is my favorite ""The Fisher King"") had spent more time on the life of these young high school students.

1059030,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000NOK1KC,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 5]","The story of a rookie teacher full of idealistic goals and dreams and no real understanding of students, but is somehow able to overcome the learning deficient and all other obstacles and inspire the students to achieve their best anyway is a clich&eacute;d movie plotline.  That formula forms the structure of the ""based on a true story"" movie, FREEDOM WRITERS.  Hilary Swank stars in the film as Erin Gruwell, a young English teacher who is eager to teach Wilson High School in Longbeach, California.  The city is still recovering from race riots a few years ago and the school has recently become a volunteer integration school, busing in students who live upwards of 60 miles away.  The once largely white, high-standard, college-prep school has seen both attendance and testing rates drop once the integration started.  Gang violence appears to be the norm and students willfully segregate themselves.  Ms. Gruwell is determined to make a difference in their lives, but it isn't easy.  Despite her best efforts, she finds herself seriously struggling.  High absenteeism, constant fighting, and racial slurs were apparently not something she was prepared to deal with.  But, with the support of her husband Scott (Patrick Dempsey), Ms. G forges ahead.A breakthrough happens when she confiscates a racial drawing one student was drawing of another.  A conversation about the Holocaust begins and Gruwell is appalled when she learns that only one student in the class has heard of the infamous genocide.  Comparing the Nazi regime to gang violence, Gruwell believes she's found the link to reach her students.  However, her supervisor refuses to loan her the resources the school has (mainly books), so Gruwell uses her own money to purchase the texts.  Thus a bond is formed and lives are changed.  However, not everyone is happy to see the students excited and learning and they do everything they can to prevent it.Hilary Swank does a good job in the role of teacher/mentor Gruwell, but the real acting talent comes from the rather large ensemble of supporting actors that portray the students.  The do an excellent job of making the students seem real and true.  Unlike many films that depict high schools, the students in the film actually seem like a racially diverse class of students and not a bunch of thirty-something actors.  Patrick Dempsey portrays Erin's husband Scott, who eventually leaves his wife because he's tired of living with a crusader.  Like the doctor he portrays on GREY'S ANATOMY Dempsey's just around as eye candy and nothing else.At the end of the film we learn a few tidbits about Gruwell and her students.  After four years together she retired from secondary teaching and taught some of her students as their English professor in college.  This caused me to wonder about Gruwell. If she felt so impassioned to teach, why did she leave the profession after only four years and stick with only one group of students?  Also, why did Gruwell have most of the same students for two years in a row?  Was that just the structure of the school?  Except for some private schools, in every secondary school I have ever been acquainted or associated with, it is rare for students to have the same English teacher more than on year.FREEDOM WRITERS rigidly sticks to the formula.  Just about everything that happens in the movie has been seen and done on screen before.  The film is really a clich&eacute;.  I knew all of this and nevertheless, found myself involved and engaged with the drama.

1059037,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000NOK1KC,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","Having been a teacher for 8 years [though not in the US] I did empathise with the teacher's position here in trying to make a difference and inspire her students despite their harsh living conditions and disadvantaged backgrounds. Like most first year teachers who enter the profession with idealistic goals, Erin was no different in wanting to better her students through creative teaching methods. In this fact-based movie, Hilary Swank is quite convincing in the role of the inspiring Erin Gruwell, and I use the word 'quite' deliberately as I felt that she has done better in other roles in making the character shine [Boys Don't Cry & Million Dollar Baby]. Here, she is credible, but not really great [in fact, her role here is comparable to Michelle Pfeiffer's role in Dangerous Minds]. That being said, I did find Freedom Writers more believable and compelling in plot development that Dangerous Minds. In Dangerous Minds, the teacher forms a rapport too quickly with the students whereas in Freedom Writers, Erin [Hilary Swank] really has to work to get the students to pay attention to her, and finally respond to her. The actors/actresses who play the roles of the students have done a wonderful job of bringing their characters' personal stories to life, we feel for these kids as every moment and every day of their lives is an uphill battle against their environment. It is a marvelous testament to the resilience of the young and brought to vivid life on screen.As for supporting roles, Patrick Dempsey does an ok job of playing the role of the resentful and unsupportive husband, but Imelda Staunton [Vera Drake] shines as the department head who is jealous of Erin's rapport with her class and her ability to obtain results. Final verdict:this is an inspiring movie in the vein of Stand and Deliver, and makes for compelling viewing.",4,Erin Gruwell & the class in Rm 203,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1849,"['Having', 'been', 'teacher', '8', 'years', '[', 'not', 'US', ']', 'did', 'empathise', 'teacher', 'position', 'here', 'trying', 'make', 'difference', 'inspire', 'students', 'harsh', 'living', 'conditions', 'disadvantaged', 'backgrounds', 'most', 'first', 'year', 'teachers', 'who', 'enter', 'profession', 'idealistic', 'goals', 'Erin', 'was', 'different', 'wanting', 'better', 'students', 'creative', 'teaching', 'methods', 'fact-based', 'movie', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'quite', 'convincing', 'role', 'inspiring', 'Erin', 'Gruwell', 'use', 'word', ""'quite"", 'deliberately', 'felt', 'done', 'better', 'other', 'roles', 'making', 'character', 'shine', '[', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', ']', 'Here', 'credible', 'not', 'really', 'great', '[', 'fact', 'role', 'here', 'comparable', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'role', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', ']', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'find', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'more', 'believable', 'compelling', 'plot', 'development', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'Dangerous', 'Minds', 'teacher', 'rapport', 'too', 'quickly', 'students', 'whereas', 'Freedom', 'Writers', 'Erin', '[', 'Hilary', 'Swank', ']', 'really', 'work', 'get', 'students', 'pay', 'attention', 'finally', 'respond', 'actors/actresses', 'who', 'play', 'roles', 'students', 'have', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'personal', 'stories', 'life', 'feel', 'kids', 'moment', 'day', 'lives', 'uphill', 'battle', 'environment', 'marvelous', 'testament', 'resilience', 'young', 'brought', 'vivid', 'life', 'screen.As', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'ok', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'resentful', 'unsupportive', 'husband', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', '[', 'Vera', 'Drake', ']', 'shines', 'department', 'head', 'who', 'jealous', 'Erin', 'rapport', 'class', 'ability', 'obtain', 'results', 'Final', 'verdict', 'inspiring', 'movie', 'vein', 'Stand', 'Deliver', 'compelling', 'viewing']",N/A
