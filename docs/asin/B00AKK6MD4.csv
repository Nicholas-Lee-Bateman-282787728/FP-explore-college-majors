M Torres ""chator4""","[2, 2]","It seems like forever since ""Superboy"" Season one was released on Dvd (in actuality, it was released around the time Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"" was making its way into movie theatres and home Dvd). Now with the upcoming release of Christopher Nolan/Zack Snyder's ""Man Of Steel"", we get finally get Season two. As another reviewer mentioned, Season two is almost an entirely different show with improved writing, visual effects, and a new cast (with the exception of Stacy Haiduk as Lana Lang, and a return guest appearance by Michael J. Pollard as the hillarious imp, Mr. Mxyzptlk). Sherman Howard is cast as an artificially aged Lex Luthor, whose portrayal of Luthor is reminisent of Jack Nicholson's Joker (""Batman"", 1989), and Gerard Christopher replaces John Haymes Newman from Season one, as Superboy/Clark Kent. Ian Mitchell-Smith (""Weird Science"") replaces T.J. White as Clark's new roomate, Andy McCalister. Gerard Christopher's Kent is modeled on Christopher Reeves' Kent, playing the character as a wimpy Uber-nerd, the antithesis of the heroic Superboy. Unlike the previous Superman television incarnation, ""The Adventures of Superman,"" from the fifties, where Superman mainly dealt with ordinary criminals, ""Superboy"" battles super-villians with super/magical powers. ""Superboy"" has the distinction of being the only Superman television show produced the Salkind brothers, who gave us the original four Superman movies. This Dvd set has all 26 episodes from Season two, but unfortunately no extra features, which is why I must give it four and not five stars.",4,Superboy Returns!,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,1578,"['forever', 'Superboy', 'Season', 'one', 'was', 'released', 'Dvd', 'actuality', 'was', 'released', 'time', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'making', 'way', 'movie', 'theatres', 'home', 'Dvd', 'Now', 'upcoming', 'release', 'Christopher', 'Nolan/Zack', 'Snyder', 'Man', 'Steel', 'get', 'finally', 'get', 'Season', 'two', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'Season', 'two', 'almost', 'entirely', 'different', 'show', 'improved', 'writing', 'visual', 'effects', 'new', 'cast', 'exception', 'Stacy', 'Haiduk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'return', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Michael', 'J.', 'Pollard', 'hillarious', 'imp', 'Mr.', 'Mxyzptlk', 'Sherman', 'Howard', 'cast', 'artificially', 'aged', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'portrayal', 'Luthor', 'reminisent', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'Batman', '1989', 'Gerard', 'Christopher', 'John', 'Haymes', 'Newman', 'Season', 'one', 'Superboy/Clark', 'Kent', 'Ian', 'Mitchell-Smith', 'Weird', 'Science', 'T.J.', 'White', 'Clark', 'new', 'roomate', 'Andy', 'McCalister', 'Gerard', 'Christopher', 'Kent', 'modeled', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'Kent', 'playing', 'character', 'wimpy', 'Uber-nerd', 'antithesis', 'heroic', 'Superboy', 'previous', 'Superman', 'television', 'incarnation', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'fifties', 'where', 'Superman', 'mainly', 'ordinary', 'criminals', 'Superboy', 'super-villians', 'super/magical', 'powers', 'Superboy', 'distinction', 'being', 'only', 'Superman', 'television', 'show', 'produced', 'Salkind', 'brothers', 'who', 'gave', 'original', 'four', 'Superman', 'movies', 'Dvd', 'set', '26', 'episodes', 'Season', 'two', 'unfortunately', 'extra', 'features', 'why', 'must', 'give', 'four', 'not', 'five', 'stars']",Superboy: The Complete Second Season

I also loved the SUPERBOY show.  Watching this newly released dvd of the second season, I think maybe the reason I liked the show so much was just Stacy Haiduk.  These episodes are, simply put, not good.  The stories are trite.  The dialogue is stiff.  The effects are awful.  (And, please, don't say it was because of the year the show was made.  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION was on the air at the same time.)  The transfer to dvd is not great, either.  I have no way of knowing if that is because of the source material or the transfer process.

1612912,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B00AKK6MD4,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[20, 22]","Those of you who were disenchanted with this groundbreaking series, I ask you to please give it a second chance. This second season began new changes which completely took the series in a new direction to become one of the very best incarnations of 'Superman' ever put to film.When executive producer Ilya Salkind created this series originally it was set at Schuster university. The first season was cheesy and the special effects had much to be desired. The show was in danger of cancellation by the end of the first season so drastic measures were taken to save the show. What they did was genius.Gone was John Haymes Newton as the lead role replaced by Gerard Christopher. Gone was the poorly casted Scott Wells and replaced by the most noticeable and greatest cast change Sherman Howard who now played a truly sinister Lex Luthor who was inspired by the great Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker in the first Batman movie which, at the time, was still fresh in people's minds. Beautiful Stacy Haiduk still played Lana Lang. Gone also was TJ White replaced by Andy McAlister.This season looks like a completely different show that included foes taken directly from the comic book pages of Superman magazines such as Bizarro and Metallo. The stories were much more written as true Superman stories. As the series progressed further in this season we have effects that rival the Christopher Reeve films, particularly the dismal ""Superman 4"" which had no budget for flying scenes. Although the series was about SuperBOY, it definitely was written as SuperMAN stories. In my own opinion it was much better written than the later series ""Lois & Clark"" which replaced it.(On a side note, Christopher was actually cast as Clark Kent for ""Lois and Clark"" until it was discovered that he played Superboy in this series which caused him to be kicked off the show and replaced by Dean Cain).The special effects had vastly improved, the stories much more interesting and suspenseful, and the new cast change brought the series to a new ratings high and it was one of the very few series which actually improved with each season!In the early episodes of the second season Christopher played a nerdy Clark Kent, much like Reeve in the films which preceeded the show. But soon Clark's personality changed to a 'straighter' interpretation of Kent much more like George Reeves played in the ""Adventures of Superman"" series from the 1950s. This was also a nice and noticeable change in the show.If you are a Superman fan, PLEASE give this show a second look. It will be worth it, especially if you are not familiar with it. You should be surprised at the big changes which made the first season look almost disasterous. Once you watch this season, unlike the first season, you will very likely be asking for more stories. Believe me, the stories get even better in the third and fourth seasons when the setting moves to the Bureau for Extra-Normal matters. Luthor becomes even more prominent in later stories and shows his sinister intentions,MUCH more like the Lex we have come to know and love (sort of). Please.....GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE! You won't be sorry.",5,A big difference since season 1,1356134400,"12 22, 2012",2012,3152,"['who', 'were', 'disenchanted', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'ask', 'please', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'second', 'season', 'began', 'new', 'changes', 'completely', 'took', 'series', 'new', 'direction', 'become', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'incarnations', ""'Superman"", 'ever', 'put', 'film.When', 'executive', 'producer', 'Ilya', 'Salkind', 'created', 'series', 'originally', 'was', 'set', 'Schuster', 'university', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'cheesy', 'special', 'effects', 'had', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'show', 'was', 'danger', 'cancellation', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'drastic', 'measures', 'were', 'taken', 'save', 'show', 'What', 'did', 'was', 'genius.Gone', 'was', 'John', 'Haymes', 'Newton', 'lead', 'role', 'replaced', 'Gerard', 'Christopher', 'Gone', 'was', 'poorly', 'casted', 'Scott', 'Wells', 'replaced', 'most', 'noticeable', 'greatest', 'cast', 'change', 'Sherman', 'Howard', 'who', 'now', 'played', 'truly', 'sinister', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'who', 'was', 'inspired', 'great', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'portrayal', 'Joker', 'first', 'Batman', 'movie', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'fresh', 'people', 'minds', 'Beautiful', 'Stacy', 'Haiduk', 'still', 'played', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Gone', 'also', 'was', 'TJ', 'White', 'replaced', 'Andy', 'McAlister.This', 'season', 'completely', 'different', 'show', 'included', 'foes', 'taken', 'directly', 'comic', 'book', 'pages', 'Superman', 'magazines', 'such', 'Bizarro', 'Metallo', 'stories', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'written', 'true', 'Superman', 'stories', 'series', 'progressed', 'further', 'season', 'have', 'effects', 'rival', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'films', 'particularly', 'dismal', 'Superman', '4', 'had', 'budget', 'flying', 'scenes', 'series', 'was', 'SuperBOY', 'definitely', 'was', 'written', 'SuperMAN', 'stories', 'own', 'opinion', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'written', 'later', 'series', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'replaced', 'side', 'note', 'Christopher', 'was', 'actually', 'cast', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'was', 'discovered', 'played', 'Superboy', 'series', 'caused', 'be', 'kicked', 'off', 'show', 'replaced', 'Dean', 'Cain', '.The', 'special', 'effects', 'had', 'vastly', 'improved', 'stories', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'suspenseful', 'new', 'cast', 'change', 'brought', 'series', 'new', 'ratings', 'high', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'series', 'actually', 'improved', 'season', 'early', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'Christopher', 'played', 'nerdy', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'much', 'Reeve', 'films', 'preceeded', 'show', 'soon', 'Clark', 'personality', 'changed', ""'straighter"", 'interpretation', 'Kent', 'much', 'more', 'George', 'Reeves', 'played', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'series', '1950s', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'noticeable', 'change', 'show.If', 'are', 'Superman', 'fan', 'PLEASE', 'give', 'show', 'second', 'look', 'will', 'be', 'especially', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'should', 'be', 'surprised', 'big', 'changes', 'made', 'first', 'season', 'look', 'almost', 'disasterous', 'Once', 'watch', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'be', 'asking', 'more', 'stories', 'Believe', 'stories', 'get', 'even', 'better', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'when', 'setting', 'moves', 'Bureau', 'Extra-Normal', 'matters', 'Luthor', 'even', 'more', 'prominent', 'later', 'stories', 'sinister', 'intentions', 'MUCH', 'more', 'Lex', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'sort', 'Please', '..GIVE', 'IT', 'A', 'SECOND', 'CHANCE', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry']",Superboy: The Complete Second Season
1612913,AJZEZZUSXKNTM,B00AKK6MD4,Dougie B,"[16, 17]","Since this series was never syndicated, finding ways of watching it were tough to say the least.  The first season was all we had available on DVD, but that was probably the weakest of all of them.Sherman Howard makes a welcome change as the new Lex Luthor.  His origin of becoming Lex Luthor is a little whacky, and conveniently never referred to again, but he makes a great villain nonetheless.  Gerard Christopher taking over the title character is a little awkward if you've just come off of the first season, but he grows into the role nicely as the series progresses.  And the stories begin to mature here, as well.  They're not as dark in tone was the 3rd and 4th seasons, but they're definitely less campy than the 1st season.As far as the DVD itself, first of all, I was surprised to find that these are NOT DVD-R's as their description says.  These are regular old, factory-pressed DVDs.  The audio and picture are greatly improved from the first season, too.  You can tell that the episodes are still transferred from the old videotape masters like the 1st season, but the picture is sharpened and the colors look a lot brighter.And yes, these stories are a little campy, but they can also be a little dark at times.

Gerard Christopher took over the role of the Boy of Steel from John Haymes Newton after salary and legal disputes tainted his attractiveness to the show's producers. Actor Scott Wells was replaced by Sherman Howard as Lex Luthor. His change in appearance was explained through the use of plastic surgery. Clark also got a new roommate in the form of Andy McCalister (Ilan Mitchell-Smith).Many familiar super villains from the comic books made live-action appearances in Season Two of &#34;Superboy.&#34; They included Metallo (Michael Callan), Bizarro (Barry Meyers), and a character fashioned after the Toyman named Nick Knack (Gilbert Gottfried). Metallo is reduced to being a thief who is transformed into a cyborg with a kryptonite heart by a mad scientist. I prefer him as a government-issued weapon of mass destruction the military uses to try to battle Superman, but that might be a bit too serious for this campy and light-hearted take on the Last Son of Krypton.&#34;Superboy: The Complete Second Season&#34; is clean fun for everyone.

This season saw vast changes from season one, with the exception of the actors that played Lana Lang, Jonathan and Martha Kent.I don't believe in spoilers, however, I will say there were some good moments in this series (introduction of Bizarro, adding more classic Superman villains), but mostly more bad, like the new actor's portrayal of Clark Kent as being more weak and nerdy, and that portrayal seem to even carry over a little in the portrayal of Superboy, almost as if he sometimes forgot which character he was portraying.  Fortunately, in season 3, he seemed to find the right balance.I also wasn't sure about the Lex Luthor change in the story line, didn't really make much sense to me, but you will have to make your own determination of how that plays out.  Lastly, the producers substituted one series regular from season one (T.J. White), with another (Andy McCalister) neither of whom in my opinion were necessary (I guess they decided so also, because this changed in season 3).Overall, I recommend this season only because of continuity of the series.  Season 3 brought vast improvements over this one, and I can't wait for season four, which was recently released.",4,"Vast Changes From Season 1, Not as good as Season 3",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1735,"['3', 'seasons', 'Superboy', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'least', 'still', 'rated', 'four', 'stars', 'mainly', 'overall', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'season', 'still', 'feel', 'overall', 'excellent', 'series.I', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'completely', 'revamped', 'season', 'one', 'read', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superboy', 'first', 'season', 'had', 'demanded', 'bigger', 'paycheck', 'continue', 'had', 'also', 'gotten', 'DUI', 'prompted', 'producers', 'replace', 'season', 'saw', 'vast', 'changes', 'season', 'one', 'exception', 'actors', 'played', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'spoilers', 'however', 'will', 'say', 'were', 'good', 'moments', 'series', 'introduction', 'Bizarro', 'adding', 'more', 'classic', 'Superman', 'villains', 'mostly', 'more', 'bad', 'new', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'being', 'more', 'weak', 'nerdy', 'portrayal', 'seem', 'even', 'carry', 'over', 'little', 'portrayal', 'Superboy', 'almost', 'forgot', 'character', 'was', 'portraying', 'Fortunately', 'season', '3', 'seemed', 'find', 'right', 'balance.I', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'change', 'story', 'line', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'own', 'determination', 'how', 'out', 'Lastly', 'producers', 'substituted', 'one', 'series', 'regular', 'season', 'one', 'T.J.', 'White', 'Andy', 'McCalister', 'neither', 'whom', 'opinion', 'were', 'necessary', 'guess', 'decided', 'so', 'also', 'changed', 'season', '3', '.Overall', 'recommend', 'season', 'only', 'continuity', 'series', 'Season', '3', 'brought', 'vast', 'improvements', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'recently', 'released']",Superboy: The Complete Second Season

However, while some of these nostalgic childhood shows look pretty stupid by adult standards, the Second Season of ""Superboy"" is one of those rare experiences that not only produces said nostalgia, but also still manages to be a quality-written, quality-acted (for the most part) series.For those of you who may have watched the First Season (somehow getting a release back in 2006) of this show, you'll probably wondering why you would ever continue on with the series, considering how terrible that initial campaign was.  However, as Season Two dawns, only Stacey Haiduk (Lana) remains in terms of casting.  All the other spots are shaken up (and all for the better)...-Gerard Christopher is now Clark/Superboy.  While delivering the corniest of all Clark Kent's, Christopher shines as Superboy as his predecessor (John Haymes-Newton) never could.-TJ White is discard in favor of Andy McCallister (Ilan Mitchell-Smith).  While Andy is really only involved in the show for two reasons (1. Superboy needs someone else to save besides Lana every episode; and 2. Comic relief), the part is well-acted and provides some punch to Christopher's less-than-stellar Clark Kent scenes.-The young, college Lex Luthor of Season One is transformed into a more traditional scheming Lex (played by Sherman Howard) in a critical move, as Howard instantly provides a desperately-needed recurring Superboy foe.If you are watching this show out of nostalgia for your childhood, your enjoyment will go through the roof!  Hearing that old theme song and seeing those cheesy (yet endearing) special effects--not to mention the overacting--will bring you right back to those Saturday mornings or afternoons in front of the television.Remarkably, though, ""Superboy"" is a well-written enough show that it does have some value in the Superman canon beyond nostalgia.  For example, the Superboy/Lana romance is quite unique, and the character of Bizarro was practically created in its proper and best form from this show.  Simply put, there is enough ""meat"" here to keep watching even after the nostalgia wears off a bit.The only reason I dock a star from this review is that some episodes of Season Two are just plain stinkers.  It was clear that the writers, now equipped with almost an entirely new cast, struggled a bit throughout the season in trying to utilize all the players in the correct roles.  Thus, while some episodes are gripping, others fall flat on their face.Watching this series was a joy to me both nostalgically and as a fan of all things Superman.
