732438,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000083C6I,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","What I'm about to say will either anger many or will have many agreeing with me. The public, when it comes to movies over-reacts. Think of &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, &quot;Swept Away&quot; (remake), &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and this film. All of the above films, where not my favorite, but, I remember when they were released, all people did was talk about how bad these movies were, and of course they weren't anywhere near as bad as the public lead me to believe.One of the reasons I enjoyed &quot;Traffic&quot; so much was due to the performance given by Erika Christensen. I thought, along with many others, that she really had something special. Many even thought she was robbed of an Oscar nomination that year. So when I heard about this film, I had to see it, just to know if &quot;Traffic&quot; was a fluke or does she actually have talent. Now, as I'm writing the review, think back on the movie I want to yell out FLUKE! FLUKE! FLUKE! But, in order to be fair I must also point out that perhaps it wasn't entirely her fault. Most will agree with me when I say &quot;Traffic&quot; has a better script then &quot;Swimfan&quot;. So maybe that's what happened. And why her role wasn't what I'd thought it would be.After all the acclaim she recieved for &quot;Traffic&quot;, why would Christensen want to act in a movie like this? Did she feel it would make her a name with younger audiences? Was that the plan? Or did she actually think it was a well written interesting character for her to play. Then again it could of been that they offered her a lot of money. But whatever the reason is, I just hope that in the future Christensen picks on better roles, it would later turn out to be a waste of talent.&quot;Swimfan&quot; as many are calling it is &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; for teenagers. Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) is the best swimmer in school. And because of that he may get accepted into Standford. He also has a girlfriend, Amy (Shiri Appleby) he's in love with. Things are going pretty well in his life right now. But, of course one day he meets Madison Bell (Christensen). At first things start out innocent. She can't open her locker so she ask him for help. Then things get more serious. But, Ben isn't putting up much resistance anyway. And I'm sure you can predict when the script will go from there.But, is &quot;Swimfan&quot; a bad film? I don't know. It's one of those movies where you can go either way. It has it's good points and it has it's bad points, and they even out in the end. If a friend told you he liked this movie, you'd be able to see their point. If someone said it's a bad movie you'd be able to see their point too. &quot;Swimfan&quot; does what it set out to do. It's not like it has some tricks up it's sleeve. No, what you thought were going to see, as far as plot goes, will happen. The writers are not going for anything else. It's because of that, that I'm giving the movie 3 stars.Dirctor John Polson, doesn't seem very confident in his directing. The movie barely ever hits a suspenseful note. It's just going through a routine. And no one seems very excited about what they're doing. Plus the two leads, Bradford and Christensen don't play off each other well. But, they do try, so I suppose some credit must be thrown their way. My over-all opinion of the movie is that it's just simply average. It's not memorable. It's a movie in ten years time no one will remember.Bottom-line: Despite the pressence of Erika Christensen, the film doesn't achieve much. It's a routine picture, and that's what it wants to be. Either you accept that or you don't! It's that simple.",3,Only &quot;Swim&quot; In This One If Your A &quot;Fan&quot;,1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,3627,"['What', ""'m"", 'say', 'will', 'either', 'anger', 'many', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'agreeing', 'public', 'when', 'movies', 'over-reacts', 'Think', 'quot', 'Town', 'amp', 'Country', 'quot', 'quot', 'Swept', 'Away', 'quot', 'remake', 'quot', 'Crossroads', 'quot', 'film', 'above', 'films', 'where', 'not', 'favorite', 'remember', 'when', 'were', 'released', 'people', 'did', 'was', 'talk', 'how', 'bad', 'movies', 'were', 'course', 'were', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'as', 'bad', 'public', 'lead', 'believe.One', 'reasons', 'enjoyed', 'quot', 'Traffic', 'quot', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'due', 'performance', 'given', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'thought', 'many', 'others', 'really', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'Many', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'robbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'year', 'when', 'heard', 'film', 'had', 'see', 'just', 'know', 'quot', 'Traffic', 'quot', 'was', 'fluke', 'actually', 'have', 'talent', 'Now', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'think', 'back', 'movie', 'want', 'yell', 'out', 'FLUKE', 'FLUKE', 'FLUKE', 'order', 'be', 'fair', 'must', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'fault', 'Most', 'will', 'agree', 'when', 'say', 'quot', 'Traffic', 'quot', 'better', 'script', 'then', 'quot', 'Swimfan', 'quot', 'maybe', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', ""'d"", 'thought', 'would', 'be.After', 'acclaim', 'recieved', 'quot', 'Traffic', 'quot', 'why', 'would', 'Christensen', 'want', 'act', 'movie', 'Did', 'feel', 'would', 'make', 'name', 'younger', 'audiences', 'Was', 'plan', 'did', 'actually', 'think', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'interesting', 'character', 'play', 'Then', 'again', 'could', 'been', 'offered', 'lot', 'money', 'whatever', 'reason', 'just', 'hope', 'future', 'Christensen', 'better', 'roles', 'would', 'later', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'waste', 'talent.', 'quot', 'Swimfan', 'quot', 'many', 'are', 'calling', 'quot', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'quot', 'teenagers', 'Ben', 'Cronin', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'best', 'swimmer', 'school', 'may', 'get', 'accepted', 'Standford', 'also', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'love', 'Things', 'are', 'going', 'pretty', 'well', 'life', 'right', 'now', 'course', 'one', 'day', 'Madison', 'Bell', 'Christensen', 'first', 'things', 'start', 'out', 'innocent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'open', 'locker', 'help', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'more', 'serious', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'putting', 'up', 'much', 'resistance', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'predict', 'when', 'script', 'will', 'go', 'there.But', 'quot', 'Swimfan', 'quot', 'bad', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'way', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'points', 'even', 'out', 'end', 'friend', 'told', 'liked', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'point', 'someone', 'said', 'bad', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'point', 'too', 'quot', 'Swimfan', 'quot', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'not', 'tricks', 'sleeve', 'No', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'see', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'will', 'happen', 'writers', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '3', 'stars.Dirctor', 'John', 'Polson', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'confident', 'directing', 'movie', 'barely', 'ever', 'suspenseful', 'note', 'just', 'going', 'routine', 'one', 'very', 'excited', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'two', 'leads', 'Bradford', 'Christensen', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'do', 'try', 'suppose', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'thrown', 'way', 'over-all', 'opinion', 'movie', 'just', 'simply', 'average', 'not', 'memorable', 'movie', 'ten', 'years', 'time', 'one', 'will', 'remember.Bottom-line', 'pressence', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'film', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'much', 'routine', 'picture', 'what', 'be', 'accept', 'do', ""n't"", 'simple']",N/A
732439,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B000083C6I,Amanda,"[1, 2]","Swimfan is not that bad - aside from the fact that the plot is in no way original, and the acting is not all that great. Anyone who has seen &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; can skip Swimfan, because they've already seen it. Here's the plot in a nutshell: a super-talented high school boy, Ben, becomes the object of obsession for the new girl in school, Madison, who gets mad after they have a little rendezvous in the pool, and Ben tells her to get lost;  that he loves his girlfriend Amy - not her. Ouch. Okay, before you start to sympathize with Madison, take into consideration that she is a complete nut case, and will do anything to make Ben hers. You can all guess what happens now.Swimfan is just another teen movie trying to pass itself off as a mature one, but the whole thing sinks pretty quickly. During every scene, we can predict what will happen in the next one - and it's no surprise. Despite what some &quot;critics&quot; supposedly have said, there are no suspenseful parts whatsoever, and you ultimately don't care what happens to any of the characters. (And I, personally, wondered why Madison was so obsessed with Ben in the first place.) The DVD is okay if you like the film - there are a handful of deleted scenes with the director's commentary option, director's commentary for the film itself, one little featurette, and the option of either full screen or widescreen. If you didn't like the film, none of these extra features will excite you in the least.I can't say I recommend this film to anyone, but I will say that, at less than an hour and a half, it held my slight interest up until the end - which is why I'm giving it two stars.

732440,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000083C6I,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Like `Fear' meets `Fatal Attraction', yet not nearly half as good as either; `Swimfan' winds up being stale.  Sure, it has it's moments but those moments are few and far in between.  The best thing to be said about `Swimfan' is that it boasts some very decent performances by some very young up-and-comers (at the time they were up-and-coming, now they are no where to be seen, which is a shame because they are both talented).  Yes, I'm talking about Erika Christensen and Jesse Bradford.  Both actors nail their parts and deliver the only shred of enjoyment in this rather dull, irritatingly predictable teenage thriller.The film revolves around a big mistake made by Ben Cronin.  Ben has his whole life ahead of him.  He has a beautiful girlfriend and a very promising swimming career, but he washes it all down the drain when he meets the mysterious and attractive Madison Bell.  Madison is obviously attracted to Ben and even though he tries at first to resist her he can't overcome her persistence and eventually he makes that dire mistake that costs him everything.  Once he has `been' with her he realizes he'll never be rid of her.  She is convinced that he loves her and thus will stop at nothing to have him all to herself.Like I said, the acting on the part of the two lead stars helps save this movie from complete and utter drivel.  Bradford is very convincing as the teen overwhelmed by the heap of trouble he got himself into, and while the character of Madison Bell is a walking clich&eacute; Erika Christensen attacks the performance with vigor and dedication.  It's a performance she could have easily phoned in but it's apparent she didn't.The script is half baked and really falls apart in the end, and the film is put together rather sloppily.  I never felt any real emotion.  I was never scared, never even tense.  I knew what was going to happen and I guessed the ending, which is sad.There really isn't anything to look forward to when watching `Swimfan'.I really wish that Bradford and Christensen would have had better careers.  I haven't really seen them in anything recently, and that is a shame because they were both so promising.  If you don't believe me then watch `Traffic' and see the performance the Academy overlooked.  Christensen is masterful in that film, riveting and flawless.  I remember when I first saw Bradford in `Bring it On' and I loved his charisma.  He recently did `Happy Endings' and delivered, but was overshadowed by his co-stars.  The fact that they could elevate this predictable mess is enough reason that they should have received better careers.  Hopefully in time they will get them.",2,"I'm not a fan of the movie, but I am a fan of its stars...",1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,2644,"['Fear', 'meets', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'yet', 'not', 'nearly', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'Swimfan', 'up', 'being', 'stale', 'Sure', 'moments', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'Swimfan', 'very', 'decent', 'performances', 'very', 'young', 'up-and-comers', 'time', 'were', 'up-and-coming', 'now', 'are', 'where', 'be', 'seen', 'shame', 'are', 'talented', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'actors', 'nail', 'parts', 'deliver', 'only', 'shred', 'enjoyment', 'rather', 'dull', 'irritatingly', 'predictable', 'teenage', 'thriller.The', 'film', 'around', 'big', 'mistake', 'made', 'Ben', 'Cronin', 'Ben', 'whole', 'life', 'ahead', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'promising', 'swimming', 'career', 'down', 'drain', 'when', 'mysterious', 'attractive', 'Madison', 'Bell', 'Madison', 'obviously', 'attracted', 'Ben', 'even', 'first', 'resist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'persistence', 'eventually', 'dire', 'mistake', 'everything', 'Once', 'been', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'rid', 'convinced', 'thus', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'have', 'herself.Like', 'said', 'acting', 'part', 'two', 'lead', 'stars', 'save', 'movie', 'complete', 'utter', 'drivel', 'Bradford', 'very', 'convincing', 'teen', 'overwhelmed', 'heap', 'trouble', 'got', 'character', 'Madison', 'Bell', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'performance', 'vigor', 'dedication', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'phoned', 'apparent', ""didn't.The"", 'script', 'half', 'baked', 'really', 'apart', 'end', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'rather', 'sloppily', 'never', 'felt', 'real', 'emotion', 'was', 'never', 'scared', 'never', 'even', 'tense', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'guessed', 'ending', 'sad.There', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'look', 'forward', 'when', 'watching', ""Swimfan'.I"", 'really', 'wish', 'Bradford', 'Christensen', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'careers', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'anything', 'recently', 'shame', 'were', 'so', 'promising', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'then', 'watch', 'Traffic', 'see', 'performance', 'Academy', 'overlooked', 'Christensen', 'masterful', 'film', 'riveting', 'flawless', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Bradford', 'Bring', 'loved', 'charisma', 'recently', 'did', 'Happy', 'Endings', 'delivered', 'was', 'overshadowed', 'co-stars', 'fact', 'could', 'elevate', 'predictable', 'mess', 'enough', 'reason', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'better', 'careers', 'Hopefully', 'time', 'will', 'get']",N/A

This movie is about a stalker, reminiscent of FATAL ATTRACTION, but with some differences - this time the chilling menacing character is a teenager, she doesn't become pregnant that we know of, and she's if anything all the more chilling and menacing. Her name is Madison Bell (not a Wisconsin phone company), and she's played be Erika Christensen. It's a movie and a performance one will never forget (Caution - it could cause nightmares!). Her prey is a guy in a seemingly hunky-dory relationship with a girlfriend. Some reviewers want to make this a morality play about ""don't cheat on your girlfriend"" but that is really missing the point. Yes, her prey does have a ""one-night-stand"" with Madison. But that doesn't seem to turn her into a crazed stalker; it seems undoubtably that she was a crazed stalker already! Any attempts to blame the victim just don't wash at all in this case. It reminds me of what I've often heard recently from one news commentator, that there IS such a thing as just plain evil. Madison is evil; we needn't require that we find something that made her that way. If things that happened to her contributed to the way she is, that was all undoubtably before the movie's time frame. She clearly would have been menacing to her prey with or without his succumbing to the ""one-night-stand""; that isn't a key plot turn in this case. And heaven help any unattached guy that Madison might have gone after -- this is definitely not mainly about cheating on one's girlfriend! I found this a highly watchable and captivating thriller, but not everybody would.

732446,A3JEXIVCVB5A8D,B000083C6I,A viewer,"[2, 3]","Basically, ""Swimfan"" is the high school version of ""Fatal Attraction.""  I had mixed feelings about this movie.  The storyline was very compelling, but yet it was very choppy and the writing was average at best.  Unfortunately, this is probably a movie that some high school kids can relate to.The storyline is quite simple.  Ben Conrin (Jesse Bradford, ""Bring It On"") is a high school senior who has basically a perfect life.  He is the captain of the swimming team and has a full-ride scholarship to Stanford University in the works.  He's a straight-A student.  And best of all, he has a wonderful, pretty, and trustworthy girlfriend named Amy (Shiri Appleby, ""Roswell"").  However, all of that is about to change when ""the new girl"" arrives as a transfer student.  The new girl, Madison Belle (Erika Christensen) is a blue-eyed, blonde-hair beauty, but little do we know, she has a turbulent background.  After they have an encounter in school (she needed help getting her locker open), she develops a crush on him and convinces him that they should hang out for one night, just as friends.  But however, that turns into a ""one night stand,"" as they end up having sex in the high school swimming pool.  Madison even gets Ben to tell her that he loves her during their lovemaking.  Now Ben's life really starts to go down the drain (no pun intended).  Madison becomes completely obsessed with him, and begins to stalk him, call him all the time, and sends him explicit pictures of herself via e-mail.  Ben finally tells her off, and then things really get bad.  He gets kicked off the swim team for alledgedly using steroids, his relationships in school and his grades begin to suffer, and he is accused of nearly killing Amy in a hit-and-run accident.  Convinced that Madison is behind all of this, Ben must find out about her past to save his own future.The movie itself is relatively short, only 85 minutes long, so the story is very fast-paced.  I thought Erika Christensen was excellent as ""The Girlfriend From Hell,"" but other than that, the acting is average.  I thought this was a decent movie, but it could have been so much better.  3 stars.",3,"Strange, eerie movie",1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,2152,"['Basically', 'Swimfan', 'high', 'school', 'version', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'storyline', 'was', 'very', 'compelling', 'yet', 'was', 'very', 'choppy', 'writing', 'was', 'average', 'best', 'Unfortunately', 'probably', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'can', 'relate', 'to.The', 'storyline', 'quite', 'simple', 'Ben', 'Conrin', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Bring', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'basically', 'perfect', 'life', 'captain', 'swimming', 'team', 'full-ride', 'scholarship', 'Stanford', 'University', 'works', 'straight-A', 'student', 'best', 'wonderful', 'pretty', 'trustworthy', 'girlfriend', 'named', 'Amy', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'Roswell', 'However', 'change', 'when', 'new', 'girl', 'transfer', 'student', 'new', 'girl', 'Madison', 'Belle', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'blue-eyed', 'blonde-hair', 'beauty', 'little', 'do', 'know', 'turbulent', 'background', 'have', 'encounter', 'school', 'needed', 'help', 'getting', 'locker', 'open', 'crush', 'convinces', 'should', 'hang', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'just', 'friends', 'however', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'sex', 'high', 'school', 'swimming', 'pool', 'Madison', 'even', 'Ben', 'tell', 'lovemaking', 'Now', 'Ben', 'life', 'really', 'go', 'down', 'drain', 'pun', 'intended', 'Madison', 'completely', 'obsessed', 'stalk', 'call', 'time', 'explicit', 'pictures', 'e-mail', 'Ben', 'finally', 'off', 'then', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'bad', 'kicked', 'off', 'swim', 'team', 'alledgedly', 'using', 'steroids', 'relationships', 'school', 'grades', 'begin', 'suffer', 'accused', 'nearly', 'killing', 'Amy', 'hit-and-run', 'accident', 'Convinced', 'Madison', 'Ben', 'must', 'find', 'out', 'past', 'save', 'own', 'future.The', 'movie', 'relatively', 'short', 'only', '85', 'minutes', 'long', 'story', 'very', 'fast-paced', 'thought', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'was', 'excellent', 'Girlfriend', 'From', 'Hell', 'other', 'acting', 'average', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', '3', 'stars']",N/A

That's pretty much what you get with this movie. A ""Fatal Attraction"" for the teen crowd. The movie is about high schooler Ben Cronin(Jesse Bradford), a star swimmer for his school's swim team. Ben seems to have it all. He has a really sweet girlfriend named Amy(The adorable and cute as a button Shiri Appleby from ""Roswell""), he's popular, he's a big swimmer on the team, and two college recruits are coming in a week to watch him in a swim meet. Then comes the new girl in school, Madison Bell(Erika Christensen from ""Traffic""). As usual, she seems to be nice and shy and just trying to learn her way around the new place. After an encounter in school, Ben and Madison become friendly. And thus, Ben's life beings to go down the tubes. She encourages him to go out with her one night, and they end up making love in the school's swimming pool. Now, Ben is a nice guy and easy to like and to cheer on, but he did sleep with Madison on his own will, and that will always be nagging in the back of your mind as you watch him. After that, Madison begins the deadly game she plays. She trounces Ben with phone calls, e-mails, and coming over to his house. When Ben finally tells her to back off, the real bad stuff happens. I won't say what happens so as to not give anything away, but it really doesn't matter at all. Why?. Because you will already know exactly what's coming and what will happen. And this is the movie's biggest problem. How many times have we seen a movie where the girl goes nuts because the boy she loved and thought loved her back tells her there is nothing between them?. I'm gonna say hundreds of times. The script seems to think that since all the movies like this are all like this, then this is what we must want to see. Wrong. There is nothing new here. We know this story from beginning to middle to end. The writers didn't seem to try to do something new or to inject new life into this dead horse. They seemed to go by the book and not seemed to really care or be all that interested. It's a flabby and tired script that they have done. All the cliches are there. We know that Ben has a great girlfriend and we know that that will soon be in trouble. We know that Ben is a star swimmer and that two college recruits are coming to watch him and we know that that too will be in jeopardy. Wanna make a bet that the psycho girl will want the girlfriend out of the way too?. Having said all of this, I can say that it is a real guilty pleasure. It's entertaining and easy to watch. That's the shock of it all. The actors here give it their all. Bradford is a nice guy and like I said, he is easy to like. Christensen is even better. Even though she plays the 'psycho girl' role pretty much by the numbers, she still does it pretty well. A pat on the back to both of them for trying their hardest to keep this sinking ship afloat. Shiri Appleby is given the typical girlfriend in trouble role. Anybody can do this role in their sleep. I like her, and I am waiting for her to do something that is worthy. Veteran character actor Dan Hedaya also appears as the swim coach. Wasn't given very much to do.

And so far, half the reviews I've read tore it apart and the other half said it was good for what it was. I share the latter sentiment.This film (which I believe is the first Fatal Attraction clone of the new millennium) virtually takes the script for the original, or even the true original, Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for Me, and reworks it so it's set at a New Jersey high school, and that's its' major problem. Other than that, this tale of Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford), a happy, healthy kid on his way to a swimming scholarship with a nice girlfriend Amy Miller (Shiri Appleby) who is seduced into a one-night stand with Madison Bell (Erika Christensen, who gives the best performance in the movie), who won't go away afterwards and turns deadly later, is quite watchable.What makes it watchable is that the director, John Polson, knows his genre and handles the action well enough to make you forget how bad the script is. The young cast, particularly Traffic's Erika Christensen, who is absolutely brilliant here, also works hard to bring life to their underwritten characters and most of them succeed.I recommend this, although I don't know how many people I recommend it to will see it more than once.

The boy is in the swimming team and the girl is happily going along in her life of work and school. Then a vulture arrives. She is blonde, she is cannibalistic, she is ready to kill to possess  what she wants and she does not take no as an answer to her orders. Then the boy says yes under pressure and she will not accept his no later on and will kill everything she can lay her hands on : friends, girl friend, mother, and the list could go on forever. The boy, with the help of a couple of people, bait that vulture with the coat of one she had tried to kill, and she is tricked into revealing her real identity, and even so she is not finished and she takes advantage of an amateurish cop to commit a couple more crime. What do we get out of this melodramatic horror? A complete feeling of emptiness that gives you a taste of ashes in your mouth, the ashes of something that is dead somewhere.

Jesse Bradford plays Ben Cronin who is the star of the swim team and has a girlfriend, Shiri Appleby, who loves him undyingly. Erika Christensen stars as Madison Bell who is the new girl in school who falls in love with Ben. The actors play their parts well and the director moves the camera with confidence.Cronin is a high school senior who has just about everything going for him. He has a great girlfriend, Amy, and a swimming scholarship to Stanford in the works. Ben's life seems almost perfect. Then Madison, the alluring new girl in town, develops a crush on Ben, although she says she just wants to be friends. But it seems that Madison has an odd way of defining ""friends."" As the story goes on, Madison's life is revealed and twists and turns in the plot keep the watcher engrossed.The DVD is fantastic.

732474,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000083C6I,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 4]","Remember a little film some time ago called ""Fatal Attraction""? C'mon, fess up. Sure, you despise Michael Douglas and Glenn Close as actors, but even you heard about this film. It's a movie that turned male/female relationships on its head by having Close's character stalk Michael Douglas after an adulterous affair turns sour. If you didn't go and see it in the theaters, you must have seen it one night on cable when you couldn't sleep. Well, I and about a million other reviewers decided to drop by to tell you that ""Swimfan"" cribs shamelessly from the concepts reified in ""Fatal Attraction."" Comments to the effect that this movie is essentially an adolescent version of the Douglas/Close oeuvre aren't inaccurate at all. Where opinion seems to diverge, in quite nasty ways from the looks of things, centers on the success of ""Swimfan"" in replicating the success its ideological predecessor. Rarely have I seen such discord as I have regarding this film; the divisions that wracked the provinces of the former Yugoslavia aren't as long lasting or contentious as the opinions about this film. I'll just go over the top of the trench right from the start by saying I thought ""Swimfan"" a fun film worth wasting time on. In fact, I would watch it again.Meet, if you dare, Ben (Jesse Bradford), a guy that seems to have everything going for him. His girlfriend Amy (Shiri Appleby) absolutely adores him, he's the star on the swim team with scouts coming to watch his moves at the next big meet, and the school generally worships him. Sure, he's got it tough in a few things. He lives with his single mom who occasionally gives him heck over minor issues because he has a checkered past. Too, Amy stresses over the possibility that she won't be going to the same university as Ben after graduation. Throw in a simmering rivalry with testosterone fueled fellow swimmer Josh (Clayne Crawford), and we learn that Ben's perfect life does have a few speed bumps. But none of these issues prepares Ben to deal with the latest threat about to enter his world: Madison Belle (Erika Christensen). Madison is a gorgeous blonde transfer student who rolls into this high school like a teenaged Cleopatra. She immediately sets her sights on Ben as her next personal conquest, and woe to anyone who stands in the way. Of course, we don't know this right away since Belle is all sugar and spice. But over time, she slowly ingratiates herself into Ben's tightly controlled universe. Benny, of course, sets himself up for the fall by wooing Madison in the swimming pool. Oops.Whoever melds with Madison stays with Madison, apparently. She conned Ben into saying ""I love you,"" and that's enough for things to head south. Belle starts instant messaging her new beau incessantly, calls him at all times of the day and night, and accosts him in the hallways. Then things become obsessive. Madison sends him suggestive pictures in e-mail, shows up at his house to meet his mother without Ben knowing about it beforehand, and starts dating the turbulent Josh in an effort to arouse jealousy. When these gimmicks don't bring the hardheaded Ben around, Madison pulls out all the stops. Outright violence committed against those Benny loves, coupled with sinister shenanigans involving a drug test for the swim meet, finally convince our dense hero that he must take action soon. Forming an alliance with her weird cousin Dante (James Debello), Benjamin digs into Madison Belle's past and finds a nightmare of twisted insanity. This girl is profoundly dangerous, and it's up to our protagonist to cobble together a plan that will save his relationship with Amy, protect those he loves, and clear himself of the various legal problems brought about by Madison's machinations. With all of this to go on, the twisty conclusion should hardly come as a surprise.I thought the performances weren't too bad in ""Swimfan."" Christensen is certainly easy on the eyes and plays evil well, so no problem there. Shiri Appleby does an acceptable job playing the slightly clueless Amy, and she has great chemistry with Bradford. Less interesting are Bradford, Crawford, and Debello. The last two don't have much to do beyond going over the top, and Bradford alternates between successful young man and blockheaded dupe too many times to be believable. Veteran character actor Dan Hedaya is largely wasted in the role of Coach Simkins, Ben's swim team coach. I think I liked the movie so much for the same reason so many despised it, i.e. so many ridiculous and illogical scenarios unfold on a regular basis. Example number one: why does Amy recover from her accident at Ben's house? Doesn't she have parents that care about her? Example number two: since when do swimmers bask in the high school social spotlight? I thought football players always took precedence, with basketball players possibly in second place. But swimmers? How strange is that? Example number three: since when do drug test results come back seconds before the swim meet starts? It's fun to pick this movie apart.I could probably go on and on with plot holes and other errors, but I don't want to. Even when you're laughing uncontrollably at the onscreen antics, ""Swimfan"" entertains. Although the movie tanked at the box office, you wouldn't know it by looking at the extras on the disc. You get a lively commentary with Bradford and Christensen, a trailer for ""28 Days Later,"" a making of featurette, and plenty of extended and deleted scenes. Many of these omitted scenes, if left in the film, might have helped ""Swimfan"" succeed at the theater because they often fill in a few plot holes. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this movie turned into a cult classic someday.",4,A potential cult classic?,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,5702,"['Remember', 'little', 'film', 'time', 'ago', 'called',

Slick high school hunk Bradford living on the east coast has a close to ideal life with a girlfriend and a swimming scholarship toward Stanford-but ironically when the new-girl-in-school (Christensen) keeps running into him, she leads him into a forbidding (and routine) trap beginning with seducing him in the pool.

He has a beautiful girlfriend, Amy (Shiri Appleby) and good friends, i.e., his life seems back on track. Then, Madison Bell (the great Erika Christensen, from ""Traffic"") enters the scene and manages to get from Ben one night and one phrase she won't ever forget: ""I love you"". From then one, Ben's life gets increasingly difficult with unexpected (well, not THAT unexpected, in fact) and dangerous situations.The first hour of the movie is quite interesting and I was paying attention to the screen. Australian (and almost unknown) director John Polson, even with an obvious treatment to the movie, was able to pass to the screen the tension of the basic script. And he was greatly helped by the actors, mainly the foremost trio (Bradford, Appleby and specially Christensen), young actors that show talent and dedication. Erika Christensen was already good in ""Traffic"", and in ""Swimfan"" she once again proves she can act.The last half-hour of the movie, however, is disastrous. The sequence of scenes are so silly and tedious that they destroyed the whole film. I guess I was half-expecting ""Swimfan"" not to be unforgettable, but its last third made it almost ridiculous.Two thirds passable, one third awful, do the math and we get three stars.

Jesse Bradford and Erika Christensen are young actors with bright futures ahead of them; however, the movie has so many plot holes and ridiculous twists that it eventually becomes more of a farce.  For instance, Bradford goes to school one day and everyone looks at him like he's got the plague, and it is obvious his one night stand with Christensen has become common knowledge.  But we never find out how!!!  And exactly what has motivated Christensen's character?  We find out her baseball boyfriend is in bad shape, but why does she do these kinds of things?  And if Bradford is so in love with the less sexy Shiri Appleby, why in the world would he even consider a fling with the obviously flirtatious vixen?  Proof that ""young love"" is more a song title than reality.  The police suspect Bradford of trying to kill Appleby, but he has a pretty good alibi:  he's with her cousin at a nursing home, so why does he panic and how do they conclude he did it?  Why would a volunteer at the hospital (Christensen) walk around with a stethoscope?  Also a volunteer should not have access to urine being tested for steroids.  Also, Bradford's mother is quick to believe her son is using steroids, because he once had a drug problem.  Some faith in her son, huh?  And how could frail young Christensen overpower two cops and get away from them?  And why was Appleby recuperating in Bradford's house, if he supposedly was after her?  And who did Dan Hedaya's hair?  And why would this coach who so admired Bradford readily concede to the steroids in his urine?Too too many gaps in the pool for me...but for its genre, it's palatable.",3,EVERYONE OUT OF THE POOL,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,1710,"['sort', 'FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'teen', 'set', 'SWIMFAN', 'basically', 'satisfying', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'are', 'young', 'actors', 'bright', 'futures', 'ahead', 'however', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'ridiculous', 'twists', 'eventually', 'more', 'farce', 'instance', 'Bradford', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'everyone', 'looks', 'got', 'plague', 'obvious', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Christensen', 'become', 'common', 'knowledge', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'exactly', 'what', 'motivated', 'Christensen', 'character', 'find', 'out', 'baseball', 'boyfriend', 'bad', 'shape', 'why', 'do', 'kinds', 'things', 'Bradford', 'so', 'love', 'less', 'sexy', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'why', 'world', 'would', 'even', 'consider', 'fling', 'obviously', 'flirtatious', 'vixen', 'Proof', 'young', 'love', 'more', 'song', 'title', 'reality', 'police', 'suspect', 'Bradford', 'trying', 'kill', 'Appleby', 'pretty', 'good', 'alibi', 'cousin', 'nursing', 'home', 'so', 'why', 'panic', 'how', 'do', 'conclude', 'did', 'Why', 'would', 'volunteer', 'hospital', 'Christensen', 'walk', 'stethoscope', 'Also', 'volunteer', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'access', 'urine', 'being', 'tested', 'steroids', 'Also', 'Bradford', 'mother', 'quick', 'believe', 'son', 'using', 'steroids', 'once', 'had', 'drug', 'problem', 'faith', 'son', 'huh', 'how', 'could', 'frail', 'young', 'Christensen', 'overpower', 'two', 'cops', 'get', 'away', 'why', 'was', 'Appleby', 'recuperating', 'Bradford', 'house', 'supposedly', 'was', 'who', 'did', 'Dan', 'Hedaya', 'hair', 'why', 'would', 'coach', 'who', 'so', 'admired', 'Bradford', 'readily', 'steroids', 'urine', 'Too', 'too', 'many', 'gaps', 'pool', 'genre', 'palatable']",N/A

I would think any teen worth their salt in movie tastes would go out and rent Fatal Attraction.  But, I guess I am underestimating people's knowledge of movies and popular culture.  There might actually be a few people that haven't.  If that's the case, get Fatal Attraction first rather than this.This is an all too typical story as far as I'm concerned.  Boy has everything, meets some sexy newcomer, and has a moment of weakness.  The other woman won't take no for an answer and makes his life a living hell with her attempts to get attention.  Just goes to show how far a woman scorned will go.  Some of this was more of a comedy rather than a drama, in that it was aimed at the teen audience.  Still, the acting was average, the plot was already used, and the end results predictable.  No surprises here.But, being that I am in my early thirties now and have a whole slew of bad relationships under my belt, I am remembering things from the past.  I'd like to think that I'm older and wiser, but maybe I'm just acting out of bitterness rather than maturity.  I've had my share of players, commitment phobics, and the like.  Now, I acknowledge my role in the situations, and then I give them what for shold the situation call for it.  The bottom line, like this movie and Fatal Attraction tells us, is that we all make mistakes.  We're only human.  But it's not worth throwing it all away over.

Fatal Attraction is more believable and was a very strong and important message to cheating men. Why men? Although it sounds like a stereotype ALOT OF GUYS CHEAT or will cheat, and it's not only a mistake, but be careful of all the lunatics who fall in love after one steamy one night stand and then stalk you to the day you file a restraining order against them or they end up hiring a hitman to take you out, or do the job themselves. Either way alot of sickos out there, and be careful who you let crawl into your bed, into your life, into your marriage, because they just may be another homicidal maniac and obviously the wrong person to ever get involved with. But i'm sure the overall message is DON'T CHEAT!!  Because you end up not  only hurting yourself, but hurting the people you love.

Christensen is a very talented up and coming actress and this was a very fine effort from the then 19 year old.

Having such a young cast was good and bad for the director. They brought a freshness to the screen, which along with the hip alternative soundtrack was appealing to the target audience, but on the negative side, there was no real experience behind or in front of the camera and it clearly shows. This is still a decent movie that is good value at a cheap price, and also stars the son of the late, great John Ritter in a small role.

732500,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000083C6I,Only-A-Child,"[1, 2]","""Swimfan"" follows such a successful commercial formula that it is surprising the industry does not jump on this idea more often.  Find an older film(s) that had good box office results (in this case ""Play Misty for Me"" and ""Fatal Attraction""). Change the story to target a young audience not exposed to the originals. Keep the costs modest by using a cast that works cheap while not staging any elaborate action sequences-pour serious money into an aggressive promotional campaign, and wait for some nice profits. There is almost no risk because it doesn't have to be a mega-hit, even if the critics hate it the promotional efforts should guarantee more than enough attendance to put this thing into the profitable category. The only thing more ""money-in-the-bank"" is Disney's re-release of its classics to a new audience every eight years.Although portrayed one-dimensionally, the obsessive character in 'Misty"" and ""Fatal Attraction"" was a deep thinker compared to ""Swimfan's"" Madison. Erika Christensen must play her as a character that comes with zero motivation. The script has no provision for her to communicate what attracts Madison to high-school athletes, what makes her instantly obsessive toward Ben (Jesse Bradford), or even mildly attracted her to him. Seemingly the screenwriter and director made an assessment of the intelligence of ""Swimfan's"" target audience, reasoning that very few of them would even be interested in knowing how and why Madison is so psychotic and unbalanced.They appear to be going somewhere with the revelations about Madison's old boyfriend but these are inserted to advance the action and not as motivational explanations. Fortunately, Christensen is talented enough to subtly convey weirdness even before her hook-up with Ben takes place. Speaking of which, Ben and Madison's sexual tumble in the swimming pool is the movie's one moment of true excellence. This is a case where the constraints of keeping a PG rating inspired rather than hindered, as the director ends up with a far more inventive and erotic scene than would have occurred had he been able to be more graphic.What is tragic is that the director really hit a home run in the casting of Christensen. With those big, round, blankly lidded eyes (the only feature that distinguishes her from her looklike Julia Stiles), she could have brought real depth to her character-she simply glows when on the screen. Superficially Christensen plays the same basic character in ""Home Room"", ""Traffic"", ""The Upside of Anger"", and even ""The Perfect Score"". But she does something completely different with each of them and really demonstrates amazing talent. The director realized too late how much Christensen was bringing to the screen. There was not enough time to change the story and put in an original twist. There is no way after the swimming pool scene that Ben would have resisted Christensen and gone back to a sexless nothing like Sheri Appleby (insert ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" here). They tried to fix this issue in post-production by deleting almost all of Appleby's scenes (check out the deleted scenes bin in the DVD special features section). But the better solution would have been to drop the predictable ending and re-shoot with something quirky.The technical aspects of the production are excellent. It is nicely lighted and filmed. The supporting cast is competent and Christensen is excellent. But it is not ambitious and the cheapness comes into play by having almost all the action take place off-screen. During the first half one is fooled into thinking this is a high quality effort. At the point of the swim meet and its sabotaged steroid test, the wheels completely fall off. From that point on the viewer is asked to believe a series of absurd plot developments that could only happen if you credited Madison with Bill Murray's ""Groundhog Day"" ability to relive days.

But Ben has one more thing as well - an obsessed fan named Madison Bell (Erika Christensen). Madison is the new girl in school who quickly develops a crush on the #1 ranked swimmer. Despite Ben's best efforts to remind her he has a girlfriend, she continues to aggressively pursue him until he yields to temptation. Before long, Ben is showing her how good his breaststroke truly is. Both agree it can only be a one time thing and promise to go their separate ways. But when Madison starts showing up at Ben's house, his job and even his girlfriend's house, he gets a sinking feeling she's not ready to let him go. Once again he pleads with her and once again she assures him that she's not interested in making waves. But when the people closest to Ben start getting seriously injured, he fears his #1 fan is behind the attacks. Now, the only way for Ben to keep his head above water is to prove what a psycho Madison really is and stop her before someone gets killed and his whole life goes swirling down the drain.This teen version of 'Fatal Attraction' is so over-the-top and trashy, it could almost qualify as a modern day camp classic. Christensen vamps and camps it up like an actress who realizes she may never get the chance to again. Sadly, she was right. 'Swimfan' was her big leading lady debut but since then she's been relegated to smaller roles as part of bigger ensembles. Bradford (who'll always be that hard-drinking, chain-smoking 'Hacker' Joey Pardella to me) is always fun to watch. He brings a relatability to every role that makes you root for him no matter who he's playing. The 2 make a great team. It's not a good movie, it's a great bad movie. As far as teen films go, 'Swimfan' isn't afraid to go off the deep end making all the others look shallow by comparison. Whereas other films sink, this one swims.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","If you've seen ""Fatal Attraction,"" then there really isn't much reason for you to check out ""Swimfan,"" which carries the psycho stalker scenario to absurd heights.  But since the target audience for this film is today's teens, chances are many of its viewers will never even have heard of ""Fatal Attraction,"" let alone seen it.""Swimfan"" is set in one of those high schools that exist only in the movies - you know, the ones that seem to be populated almost entirely by twenty-something hunks and babes (with the occasional nerd thrown in) and which appear to be utterly devoid of teachers, principals, counselors or any other adult supervisory staff to run the place (in all fairness, we DO get to see one swim coach).  None of these students are ever seen attending a class, cracking open a book or doing any homework, but then that would sort of spoil the fun of the high school experience now, wouldn't it?Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) doesn't ask much out of life.  All he wants is to be left alone to concentrate on his swimming so that he'll be in tiptop shape to impress the scouts who are coming out from Stanford to have a look at him.  That's his plan anyway, until one day, into his life, strolls Madison Belle (Erika Christensen), a pretty young seductress, who, upon her arrival at the school, makes an immediate beeline for Ben, seducing him in the school's swimming pool and making his life thoroughly miserable thereafter.  Soon Madison is stalking our hero in true Glenn Close fashion, finding ways to insinuate herself into every aspect of Ben's once seemingly ideal life.  Indeed, Ben has every thing going for him: popularity, good looks, athletic prowess, a devoted mother, a girlfriend who loves him - and it all threatens to come crashing down around him after just one night of unbridled passion with this fresh-from-out-of-town psychotic nut case.About the only interesting aspect of ""Swimfan"" is how it shows that, in this technologically advanced age, a genuine stalker now has so many more options at his or her disposal - answering machines, cell phones, pagers, voice mail, email, instant messages.  The possibilities are endless.  It's enough to make one long for the good old days when an obsessed paramour had to at least foot the bill for a phone call or buy a stamp to send a deranged letter, or at least find ever more clever ways of skulking around.  Stalking just seems way too easy these days.  Technology appears to have taken all the challenge out of it.Unlike ""Fatal Attraction,"" which at least managed to achieve a level of credibility before it went off the deep end in the final act, ""Swimfan"" never establishes a believable tone.  Madison's actions always just feel like melodramatic plot points, and Ben's retaliatory measures aren't much better.  And the law enforcement in the town - well, the less said about THEM the better!  Ultimately, the story becomes more and more preposterous as it churns along, so much so that the film actually ends up generating more laughs than gasps by the time it is over.  Jesse Bradford and Erika Christensen may still have solid acting careers ahead of them, but my suspicion is that ""Swimfan"" will not rank very high on either of their resumes.",2,lowest common denominator thriller,1032566400,"09 21, 2002",2002,3227,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'then', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'reason', 'check', 'out', 'Swimfan', 'psycho', 'stalker', 'scenario', 'absurd', 'heights', 'target', 'audience', 'film', 'today', 'teens', 'chances', 'are', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'never', 'even', 'have', 'heard', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'let', 'alone', 'seen', 'Swimfan', 'set', 'one', 'high', 'schools', 'exist', 'only', 'movies', 'know', 'ones', 'seem', 'be', 'populated', 'almost', 'entirely', 'twenty-something', 'hunks', 'babes', 'occasional', 'nerd', 'thrown', 'appear', 'be', 'utterly', 'devoid', 'teachers', 'principals', 'counselors', 'other', 'adult', 'supervisory', 'staff', 'run', 'place', 'fairness', 'DO', 'get', 'see', 'one', 'swim', 'coach', 'None', 'students', 'are', 'ever', 'seen', 'attending', 'class', 'cracking', 'open', 'book', 'doing', 'homework', 'then', 'would', 'sort', 'spoil', 'fun', 'high', 'school', 'experience', 'now', 'would', ""n't"", 'Ben', 'Cronin', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'life', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'concentrate', 'swimming', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'tiptop', 'shape', 'impress', 'scouts', 'who', 'are', 'coming', 'out', 'Stanford', 'have', 'look', 'plan', 'anyway', 'one', 'day', 'life', 'Madison', 'Belle', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'pretty', 'young', 'seductress', 'who', 'arrival', 'school', 'immediate', 'beeline', 'Ben', 'seducing', 'school', 'swimming', 'pool', 'making', 'life', 'thoroughly', 'miserable', 'thereafter', 'Soon', 'Madison', 'stalking', 'hero', 'true', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'fashion', 'finding', 'ways', 'insinuate', 'aspect', 'Ben', 'once', 'seemingly', 'ideal', 'life', 'Indeed', 'Ben', 'thing', 'going', 'popularity', 'good', 'looks', 'athletic', 'prowess', 'devoted', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'just', 'one', 'night', 'unbridled', 'passion', 'fresh-from-out-of-town', 'psychotic', 'nut', 'case.About', 'only', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'Swimfan', 'how', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'age', 'genuine', 'stalker', 'now', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'options', 'disposal', 'answering', 'machines', 'cell', 'phones', 'pagers', 'voice', 'mail', 'email', 'instant', 'messages', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless', 'enough', 'make', 'one', 'long', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'obsessed', 'paramour', 'had', 'least', 'foot', 'bill', 'phone', 'call', 'buy', 'stamp', 'send', 'deranged', 'letter', 'least', 'find', 'ever', 'more', 'clever', 'ways', 'skulking', 'around', 'Stalking', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'days', 'Technology', 'have', 'taken', 'challenge', 'it.Unlike', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'least', 'managed', 'achieve', 'level', 'credibility', 'went', 'deep', 'end', 'final', 'act', 'Swimfan', 'never', 'believable', 'tone', 'Madison', 'actions', 'always', 'just', 'feel', 'melodramatic', 'plot', 'points', 'Ben', 'retaliatory', 'measures', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'law', 'enforcement', 'town', 'well', 'less', 'said', 'THEM', 'better', 'Ultimately', 'story', 'more', 'more', 'preposterous', 'along', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'actually', 'up', 'generating', 'more', 'laughs', 'gasps', 'time', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'may', 'still', 'have', 'solid', 'acting', 'careers', 'ahead', 'suspicion', 'Swimfan', 'will', 'not', 'rank', 'very', 'high', 'resumes']",N/A

Madison even goes to lengths as to ruin Ben's budding swimming future with an accusation of steroids and almost murdering an elderly man Ben works with at a hospital.Madison yet refuses to see her and Ben's relationship for what it is (or what it isn't).

732512,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B000083C6I,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[4, 4]","Swimfan is supposed to be a horror movie. The scariest thing is what happened behind the camera. It scares the crap out of me that some executive thought this horrible script was good enough to be greenlit for movie production. Swimfan will give you the chills, aplenty, however they'll be from nausea and vomiting induced by what you see onscreen.Swimfan revolves around a teenager (can't tell he's eighteen by that thirty-something five o'clock shadow and thinning hairline) who's on the swim team. The top jock at his high school, he meets up with a mysterious girl (always one of these in these type of movies, they all have curly blonde hair just like Glenn Close too) who drops into town. She's a big fan of athletes, and has taken a shine to our hero. Jockboy makes the mistake of saying he loves her to have sex with her. After sleeping with her, he promptly dumps her like most jocks do in these types of movies. This sets the swimfan off Fatal Attraction style like most female characters in these types of movies.Right now you're probably thinking isn't this part of the plot of the Rage Carrie 2 and about a dozen other better horror movies? Yeah it is. If you're already this smart you've probably ejected the DVD and about to cry in front of the TV lamenting the $15 you lost buying this movie. Purchasing this movie at retail is THAT regrettable a decision.There isn't an original scene in SwimFan. This movie is so predictable you can set your watch to it. When the barrage of E-mails doesn't capture the swimmer's attention, Crazy lady goes out and starts killing people. First it's the old man he talks to at the hospital with the wrong medicine, then it's his best friend. She runs down a female friend in his truck. The cops think it's Jockboy, but he can't prove it's her.Jockboy decides to meet up with Swimfan in a parking lot. (The 30-something's 5'clock shadow has grown almost into a beard now) There she confesses to the three murders and one attempted murder. On the way to jail, SOMEHOW she grabs the officer's gun and kills both officers. Right on time for the climatic showdown. I'm scratching my head why they handcuffed her hands in front of her? Don't police handcuff suspects, especially MURDER suspects with their hands behind their back? Oh wait, they do that in GOOD movies. Swimfan then heads over to Jockboy's house for some revenge. Shawn heads over to the kitchen for some Alka-Seltzers so he can finish watching this crappy movie so he can write this review.When Swimfan kidnaps his female friend and attempts to murder her, Jockboy takes action. This leads up to a dull climax where he saves his girlfriend while letting the crazed Swimfan drown in the school pool. I find it funny that a Swimfan can't swim herself. You think if you're going to be a fan of something you'd actually be good at it. But that's a plothole the writers probably thought was clever.There isn't a good performance in this movie; if the actors are smart they won't put this movie on their resume as a credit.Leave Swimfan to drown at the bottom of the $5.99 bargain bin. For a good scary thriller pick up Fatal Attraction, the movie Swimfan desperately tries to copy. For a good scary movie in water, pick up Open Water, or Jaws.",1,"Fatal Attraction Lite. half the story, half the plot, none of the substance.",1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,3249,"['Swimfan', 'supposed', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'scariest', 'thing', 'what', 'happened', 'camera', 'crap', 'executive', 'thought', 'horrible', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'greenlit', 'movie', 'production', 'Swimfan', 'will', 'give', 'chills', 'aplenty', 'however', ""'ll"", 'be', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'induced', 'what', 'see', 'onscreen.Swimfan', 'revolves', 'teenager', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'eighteen', 'thirty-something', 'five', ""o'clock"", 'shadow', 'thinning', 'hairline', 'who', 'swim', 'team', 'top', 'jock', 'high', 'school', 'up', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'always', 'one', 'type', 'movies', 'have', 'curly', 'blonde', 'hair', 'just', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'too', 'who', 'town', 'big', 'fan', 'athletes', 'taken', 'shine', 'hero', 'Jockboy', 'mistake', 'saying', 'have', 'sex', 'sleeping', 'promptly', 'most', 'jocks', 'do', 'types', 'movies', 'swimfan', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'style', 'most', 'female', 'characters', 'types', 'movies.Right', 'now', ""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'part', 'plot', 'Rage', 'Carrie', '2', 'dozen', 'other', 'better', 'horror', 'movies', 'Yeah', ""'re"", 'already', 'smart', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'ejected', 'DVD', 'cry', 'front', 'TV', 'lamenting', '15', 'lost', 'buying', 'movie', 'Purchasing', 'movie', 'retail', 'THAT', 'decision.There', ""n't"", 'original', 'scene', 'SwimFan', 'movie', 'so', 'predictable', 'can', 'set', 'watch', 'When', 'barrage', 'E-mails', ""n't"", 'capture', 'swimmer', 'attention', 'Crazy', 'lady', 'out', 'killing', 'people', 'First', 'old', 'man', 'hospital', 'wrong', 'medicine', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'down', 'female', 'friend', 'truck', 'cops', 'think', 'Jockboy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prove', 'her.Jockboy', 'decides', 'meet', 'up', 'Swimfan', 'parking', 'lot', '30-something', ""5'clock"", 'shadow', 'grown', 'almost', 'beard', 'now', 'three', 'murders', 'one', 'attempted', 'murder', 'way', 'jail', 'SOMEHOW', 'grabs', 'officer', 'gun', 'kills', 'officers', 'Right', 'time', 'climatic', 'showdown', ""'m"", 'scratching', 'head', 'why', 'handcuffed', 'hands', 'front', 'Do', ""n't"", 'police', 'handcuff', 'suspects', 'especially', 'MURDER', 'suspects', 'hands', 'back', 'Oh', 'wait', 'do', 'GOOD', 'movies', 'Swimfan', 'then', 'Jockboy', 'house', 'revenge', 'Shawn', 'kitchen', 'Alka-Seltzers', 'can', 'finish', 'watching', 'crappy', 'movie', 'can', 'write', 'review.When', 'Swimfan', 'female', 'friend', 'attempts', 'murder', 'Jockboy', 'action', 'up', 'dull', 'climax', 'where', 'girlfriend', 'letting', 'crazed', 'Swimfan', 'drown', 'school', 'pool', 'find', 'Swimfan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swim', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'fan', 'something', ""'d"", 'actually', 'be', 'good', 'plothole', 'writers', 'probably', 'thought', 'was', 'clever.There', ""n't"", 'good', 'performance', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'smart', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'movie', 'resume', 'credit.Leave', 'Swimfan', 'drown', 'bottom', '5.99', 'bargain', 'bin', 'good', 'scary', 'thriller', 'pick', 'up', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'movie', 'Swimfan', 'desperately', 'copy', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'water', 'pick', 'up', 'Open', 'Water', 'Jaws']",N/A

732515,A2CZR46KVZLWDT,B000083C6I,Suzie,"[0, 0]","`Swimfan', a slightly under-developed teen thriller, stars Jesse Bradford, Erika Christensen and Shiri Appleby as three high school seniors in a New Jersey public school who soon find themselves in a very grown-up situation.When Madison Bell (Christensen), a sophisticated, blonde musician moves to Ben Cronin's (Bradford) small New Jersey town he is immediately taken with the manipulative beauty. Although she does a better job of concealing it Madison is equally attracted to this promising young swimmer and immediately starts arranging things so that he will fall right into her deadly trap.In a moment of weakness Ben sleeps with Madison in the school swimming pool, thus cheating on his goody-two-shoes girlfriend, Amy (Appleby). After Ben decides that this was a mistake, Madison begins working to establish herself as an overwhelming presence in Ben's life, seemingly trying to make him regret the moment he dared to deny her. In the end, Madison goes completely haywire, refusing to believe that she and Ben are not destined to be together and goes on what can only be defined as a mad killing spree, as well as committing several other dangerous crimes in between.Although Erika Christensen is impressive in a role that is otherwise over the top and Shiri Appleby does fine with her simple part, the rest of the movie needs improvement.First of all, its very predictable - its painfully obvious right from the start that Madison will eventually go after Amy and you never question the fact that she's insane. It's also very unrealistic, owing partly to the director's choice of scenes to cut. And finally, it's horribly over-dramatic - if this ever really happened Ben could easily prove that Madison needed her head examined; however, the scriptwriter proceeds to write the story as if he's stuck with this psycho lusting after him and no one to turn to for help.This movie strives to be the second coming of ""The Skulls"", but isn't as well plotted or written. And while Erika Christensen is probably a better actor than Paul Walker, in suspense/action movies true talent often goes to waste, coming second to exactly how shocked the audience is by the end.

It looks easy enough, judging from the depths of movies covering the topic, from Fatal Attraction to SWF and beyond. Perhaps it simply the setting. I've never been comfortable in an elevator or with roommates, so I suppose I'm just not looking in the right place. And now, with Swimfan, with have yet another example of something that I can't seem to have because, unfortunately, not all reviewers swim.Here, we have the prime example of a guy who has everything. He's a talented enough swimmer to seal a deal with any university around, has popularity and friends, and has the component that many people are missing in life; love.And then along comes temptation.Her name is Madison, she's freshly attractive, and she's always in distress.So, what's a talented guy to do? He's supposed to help her, of course. And, if that guy happens to be a swimmer - something I wish I could be, he's obviously supposed to go one step further, having &quot;something&quot; that &quot;doesn't mean anything&quot; with her.When she tells you to say that you love her while doing it, however, and then begins stalking you, you apparently have been too helpful and tehn you have a problem.O what a life.Were I going to define the movie in one word, I would call it predictable. Everyknow can guess at what's going to happen and, most of the time, they'd be right. Added to that, the acting in the movie wasn't the greatest and it wasn't the worst, falling somewhere by the wayside of great cinematic. The storyline wasn't really all that interesting but it did have some hooks in it that kept one watching and waiting - and waiting - for something to manifest that sometimes did.Unfortunately, the big pay-off, the clincher in the end that's supposed to be riveting, wasn't. Instead, it simply ended, trying to teach me a valuable lesson.But what was that valuable lesson?During this movie, I think I was supposed to feel sympathy for the man with everything. I think the point of it was to say that having an interestingly bizarre, always lovely, lioness of a woman following him around was a horrible fate and that nobody would want this to happen to him. Somehow, though, I couldn't find myself feeling anything. Here he was, a guy with the works, and he decided that the best option was to have more. When more starts stalking him, however, and looking cute doing it, he finds its not want he wants and that its ruining his life.Now he can't swim anymore because his concentration is broke, scouts don't like him, and he's ruined his relationship.Still, there's a bright side.He has an obsessively beautiful lady stalking him!If you are bored and have nothing else to do, then perhaps you might think of watching this movie. It does, after all, have the potential to be a little odd, and it does offer someone a few interesting turns as a relationship buds into that comfort zone we call obsessiveness.

He is hunky Ben, ace swimmer of the school, and has a nice brunette girl friend (Shiri Appleby, TV's ""Roswell"").  Here comes a new girl with southern accent and blonde hair called ""Madison Bell."" (Erika Christensen, ""Traffic"").  SO, what happens next?  Not a hard one to guess.It is already known that ""Swimfan"" is a teen version of ""Fatal Attraction, but the fact is, this new take gives you more -- more laughs and gasps with your ""You gotta be kidding!""  Unfortunately, they aren't, always keeping straight-faced among the mediocre script, which exactly shows what happens in the next five minutes.But what happens?  Right, at the swimming pool (where else?), one night, Ben makes love with the girl, who turns out a little annoying existence for him, stalking and harassing him, sending 85 e-mails after he left her, including a nearly naked picture.  And Ben sees it on a PC in his high school.  And of course, his faithful, good-natured girl friend ALMOST sees the photo before he hides it.  And so on, and on....  Someone has to be dead, as usual.  The detectives are useless, as usual, his mother just does not understand, as usual, and ... well, in short, Ben lives like a Michael Douglas 20 years ago, only he is much younger and goes to school.  And this fatally attractive girl Madison is played by Seattle-born Erika Christensen, who previously was  Michael Douglas' drug addict daughter in ""Traffic.""  Is this rather strange casting because she played Michael Douglas's daughter?There is nothing I can recommend about the film.  It starts mildly entertaining and ends up with a ludiculous finale, which makes the legendary ""dead rabbit"" and ""bath tub"" scenes look like ""The Third Man.""",2,Sinks Deep to the Bottom So Slowly,1050105600,"04 12, 2003",2003,1812,"['Ok', 'listen', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Bring', 'teenage', 'thriller', 'set', 'high', 'school', 'USA', 'hunky', 'Ben', 'ace', 'swimmer', 'school', 'nice', 'brunette', 'girl', 'friend', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'TV', 'Roswell', 'Here', 'new', 'girl', 'southern', 'accent', 'blonde', 'hair', 'called', 'Madison', 'Bell', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Traffic', 'SO', 'what', 'next', 'Not', 'hard', 'one', 'guess.It', 'already', 'known', 'Swimfan', 'teen', 'version', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'fact', 'new', 'take', 'more', 'more', 'laughs', 'gasps', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'kidding', 'Unfortunately', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'keeping', 'straight-faced', 'mediocre', 'script', 'exactly', 'what', 'next', 'five', 'minutes.But', 'what', 'Right', 'swimming', 'pool', 'where', 'else', 'one', 'night', 'Ben', 'love', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'little', 'annoying', 'existence', 'stalking', 'harassing', 'sending', '85', 'e-mails', 'left', 'including', 'nearly', 'naked', 'picture', 'Ben', 'PC', 'high', 'school', 'course', 'faithful', 'good-natured', 'girl', 'friend', 'ALMOST', 'photo', 'so', 'Someone', 'be', 'dead', 'usual', 'detectives', 'are', 'useless', 'usual', 'mother', 'just', 'not', 'understand', 'usual', 'well', 'short', 'Ben', 'Michael', 'Douglas', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'only', 'much', 'younger', 'school', 'fatally', 'attractive', 'girl', 'Madison', 'played', 'Seattle-born', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'who', 'previously', 'was', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'drug', 'addict', 'daughter', 'Traffic', 'rather', 'strange', 'casting', 'played', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'daughter', 'nothing', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'up', 'ludiculous', 'finale', 'legendary', 'dead', 'rabbit', 'bath', 'tub', 'scenes', 'look', 'Third', 'Man']",N/A

The story centered on a psychotic girl that will do anything to make a guy love her.  It's nothing original, but it works for a good time.There were good solid performances from all the actors, which definitely makes the movie step up a level.  It's a lot easier to stomach predictability with decent acting.There were some genuine creepy moments, but the movie wasn't supposed to be scary.  If that's what you're looking for when watching Swimfan, you will be dissatisfied.  And even though the movie was short, it got to the point without unnecessary filler that bogs down so many movies.  That in turn, creates tension, and I credit good directing to that.There were some strange editing tricks that I didn't find all that appealing, but it sure made it different.  Was the script a little unbelievable?  Probably, but what movie isn't anymore?  That's why they call it a movie.Swimfan is not perfect cinema, but it'll make for an enjoyable time if you don't ask too much of it.  4 Stars",4,Don't Swim Away From This One,1054512000,"06 2, 2003",2003,1096,"['Swimfan', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'certain', 'instances', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'story', 'centered', 'psychotic', 'girl', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'make', 'guy', 'nothing', 'original', 'good', 'time.There', 'were', 'good', 'solid', 'performances', 'actors', 'definitely', 'movie', 'step', 'up', 'level', 'lot', 'easier', 'stomach', 'predictability', 'decent', 'were', 'genuine', 'creepy', 'moments', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'scary', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'when', 'watching', 'Swimfan', 'will', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'even', 'movie', 'was', 'short', 'got', 'point', 'unnecessary', 'filler', 'down', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'turn', 'tension', 'credit', 'good', 'directing', 'that.There', 'were', 'strange', 'editing', 'tricks', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'appealing', 'sure', 'made', 'different', 'Was', 'script', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'Probably', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'anymore', 'why', 'call', 'movie.Swimfan', 'not', 'perfect', 'cinema', ""'ll"", 'make', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'too', 'much', '4', 'Stars']",N/A

732524,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000083C6I,Wheelchair Assassin,"[2, 3]","When my fiance and I rented this movie last night, I expected some decent mindless entertainment, but never in my wildest dreams could I have anticipated something this outrageously horrible.  Somehow, ""Swimfan"" manages to be as stupid and ridiculous as anything with Arnold Schwarzenegger or Chuck Norris in it.  I mean, I've heard of unintentional comedy before, but this movie is off the charts!  One scene early on is more than enough to let you know just what you're in for.  High school swimming star Ben is in a pool making out with seductive newcomer Madison, whom he's just met about thirty-six hours before (despite the fact that he has an extremely attractive girlfriend), when she suddenly asks him to tell her he loves her...AND HE ACTUALLY DOES IT!  Now, I'm sure it's nothing new for a guy to tell a girl he loves her in order to get laid, but when a girl you've known for about two days asks you to tell her you love her...well, that should be a clue that she might be a little bit on the obsessive side.  From there, of course, things just get worse.  Madison becomes convinced she and Ben are an item, Ben tries to convince her that they're not, Madison goes psycho and tries to ruin Ben's life, people start dying, and the unintentional laughs just keep coming.  Of course, it's pretty hard to feel bad for Ben because he was stupid enough to cheat on his girlfriend with a lunatic like Madison to begin with.  I think the only movie that ever made me laugh harder than ""Swimfan"" was ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" but the difference is that ""Holy Grail"" was MEANT to be funny.  Actually, ""Swimfan"" takes its cues almost directly from ""Fatal Attraction,"" but since it's aimed at teenagers rather than adults it's even more absurd than its predecessor.  So whereas ""Fatal Attraction"" was just a bad movie, ""Swimfan"" manages to cross that invisible line into ""So bad it's funny"" territory.  I'm only 24, but if stuff like this is what teenagers are watching now, I fear for the future of our great country.",2,It deserves two stars for making me laugh so hard!,1048464000,"03 24, 2003",2003,2027,"['When', 'fiance', 'rented', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'expected', 'decent', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'never', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'could', 'have', 'anticipated', 'something', 'outrageously', 'horrible', 'Somehow', 'Swimfan', 'be', 'stupid', 'ridiculous', 'anything', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'mean', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'movie', 'charts', 'One', 'scene', 'early', 'more', 'enough', 'let', 'know', 'just', 'what', ""'re"", 'High', 'school', 'swimming', 'star', 'Ben', 'pool', 'making', 'out', 'seductive', 'newcomer', 'Madison', 'whom', 'just', 'met', 'thirty-six', 'hours', 'fact', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'suddenly', 'tell', 'HE', 'ACTUALLY', 'IT', 'Now', ""'m"", 'sure', 'nothing', 'new', 'guy', 'tell', 'girl', 'order', 'get', 'laid', 'when', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'known', 'about', 'two', 'days', 'tell', 'love', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'clue', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'obsessive', 'side', 'there', 'course', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'worse', 'Madison', 'convinced', 'Ben', 'are', 'item', 'Ben', 'convince', ""'re"", 'not', 'Madison', 'psycho', 'tries', 'ruin', 'Ben', 'life', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'just', 'keep', 'coming', 'course', 'pretty', 'hard', 'feel', 'bad', 'Ben', 'was', 'stupid', 'enough', 'cheat', 'girlfriend', 'lunatic', 'Madison', 'begin', 'think', 'only', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'harder', 'Swimfan', 'was', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'difference', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'was', 'MEANT', 'be', 'funny', 'Actually', 'Swimfan', 'cues', 'almost', 'directly', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'rather', 'adults', 'even', 'more', 'absurd', 'predecessor', 'So', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'movie', 'Swimfan', 'cross', 'invisible', 'line', 'So', 'bad', 'funny', 'territory', ""'m"", 'only', '24', 'stuff', 'what', 'teenagers', 'are', 'watching', 'now', 'fear', 'future', 'great', 'country']",N/A
