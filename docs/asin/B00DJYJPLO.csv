1655880,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DJYJPLO,Andrew Ellington,"[41, 50]","I'm new to the whole `Before...' trilogy.  I understand that I'm probably the one in a million who hadn't seen any of the parts, but it is a truth I can't hide from.  Back in 2004, when the internet was abuzz of talk over `Before Sunset' and critics were raving Julie Delpy's performance and the Oscars were nominating its screenplay I was under a rock.  Well, to be completely honest, I wasn't under a rock as much as I was too lazy to want to watch `Before Sunrise' and there was no way I was going to watch a sequel without watching the first film.  So this year I finally buckled.  With all the critical praise for `Before Midnight' I knew that I was going to eventually HAVE to see this movie, and so I Netflix'd `Before Sunrise' and `Before Sunset' and had myself a `Before...' marathon.  Yes, I got up early this morning and watched the first two films and then got in my car and sat in a theater and indulged in the conclusion to this romantic trifecta (or is it?).In all honesty, I'm still semi-processing the whole thing, but I really don't think one can talk about one film, especially `Before Midnight', without at least addressing the others.  The films are so interconnected despite being about so many varying themes and subjects.  Quite honestly, other than the two main characters these films don't really speak the same language and yet they feel so interconnected.What I think is so great about this series is that, experienced as I did today (back to back to back), the films play out like a complete relationship.  You have the initial meeting in 1994 on a train through Europe.  These two people, Jesse and Celine, meet rather spontaneously, share a meaningful `chat' and then decide to spend an entire day and night roaming Vienna and getting to know one another.  Then you have their chance `re-encounter' ten years later in 2004.  Much like the infamous `Love Story' (better known by its 1957 remake,  `An Affair to Remember') one of these lovers missed their six month rendezvous, which caused them to be separated for ten years before they are reunited when Jesse is on a book tour through Europe and happens to stop over in France, where Celine is from.  In the latest film you have this pair, now nine years into a serious relationship complete with twin girls and Jesse's son from his previous relationship.  The glowing romance is stripped away and the reality of love and life has set in.  In the beautiful way in which Linklater and company have shot these films, we get to see these snapshots of a relationship in such a full and complete way, and while separately some work stronger than others, together they create a beautiful whole.They take you from fairytale love affair to realistic adventure to tragic reality, all parts of which contrast and complement in ways unexpected.I don't know if this speaks to the cynic in me, but I feel as though `Before Midnight' truly stands out as the most impressive of the trilogy.  It felt the most honest and earthy, and while `Before Sunset' certainly felt more organic and natural, there is something emotionally stirring about `Before Midnight' that I just can't shake.  It is the only film in the trilogy that reduced me to tears (several times) and since I'm one who reacts more favorably to having my emotions played with, it is only natural that this conclusion be the film I appreciate the most.More so than any of the others, `Before Midnight' feels very mature.  With `Before Sunrise' it felt like an indie variation of the classic romantic comedy.  It used big words and long sentences and political, sexual and controversial subtext to set it apart and make it `relevant' and yet recycled clich&eacute;d themes and situations in order to remain part of that world.  It felt very fairytale like, which is something I enjoyed and yet also felt somewhat disconnected to.  `Before Sunset' moved us forward somewhat with a more honest interpretation of this kindled love, and taking these characters from the initial meeting to only their second time together (yet with so much extra worldly baggage on their shoulders) it made their connection feel more secure, more rooted and honest.  Their verbal exchanges, while equally as long, diverse and weighted, felt easier to digest and felt more comfortable on their tongues.  They were older, wiser and more trustworthy.  But, with this third outing, Linklater takes us out of the fairytale and into the real world.  He draws from a darker place and gives us a real look at a fractured relationship and plays to the idea that NO relationship is free from complication.  Whereas the first two films romanticized the whole experience (even the disagreements were charming), `Before Midnight' confronts us with a more savage underlining of subtext.I was not expecting this at all, but it was a welcome surprise.Some may baulk at this assessment, but for me this was Linkater at his most Bergmanesque.  It was reminiscent of what Woody Allen attempted to do with films like `Husbands and Wives' or `Interiors' and yet this actually feels more connected to Bergman's world than either or those films.  I kept calling to mind `Scenes from a Marriage', which is one of my favorite films of all time.  The conversational quality of the whole exercise is so enthralling; one can't help but be completely swept up in it all.  What makes this film so efficient and so affecting is that is couples the same ease of language and chemistry that was honed and perfected over the course of the series and adds that needed edge of tension that makes this film feel more enlightened, more important.Both Jesse and Celine are flawed individuals.  Unlike Allen's `Husbands and Wives', this never felt like a one-sided conversation.  Even moments where it could be perceived as such (especially when Celine becomes overly agitated and defensive) are diffused by the nature of the film.  This is a mere conversation; a heated one, but a conversation and so the natural recoil of affection and plunge in defensiveness is expected.  The way these two circle the subject of their relationship is so effortless.Yes, if one were to try and point a finger than the dinner table scene which featured a scenario straight out of `Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married' felt a tad forced and obvious and could have been stripped from the film itself, and yet it all felt so natural given the moment in the film.  It felt like part of a whole, but still I was glad to see it end.This trilogy works best when its sole focus in on the two leads.  They play off of one another so beautifully that one can't stop looking at them.  While I was initially put off by Hawke in the first film, he completely won me over in `Before Sunset', and while he is extremely effective in `Before Midnight', it is Julie Delpy who completely owns this particular film.  Her progression of character and ease of performance are a rarity in cinema and something to marvel over.So, as a whole I must say that I really like this trilogy.  I don't love it, although these are films that I really MUST watch again and I have a feeling that over time I'll become more and more effected by them as separate entities (since right now I'm having a hard time viewing them on their own and not as part of a larger whole), and then again they are films that I could easily begin to pick apart and criticize.  I think that the singular nature of the film itself lends itself to that kind of reaction.  By confining your focus to singular conversations, you are leaving yourself open to varying opinions on those conversations and viewpoints and thus you are going to stir passion, either for or against your film.  I could listen to these films all day long, and in fact I'm almost tempted to keep `Before Sunrise' and `Before Sunset' on loop while I'm at work this week just to soak in every word.As a whole, I'd rate this trilogy an A-, mostly on the strength of the final chapter.  Individually (and this fluctuates by the minute), I'd give `Before Sunrise' a B-, `Before Sunset' a B+ and `Before Midnight' an A, verging on an A+, but I'm hesitant to call this a masterpiece just yet.",5,Talk to me ...,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,8151,"[""'m"", 'new', 'whole', 'trilogy', 'understand', ""'m"", 'probably', 'one', 'million', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'parts', 'truth', 'ca',

1655881,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00DJYJPLO,Andy Orrock,"[0, 0]","If you've seen the first two installments (Before Sunrise, Before Sunset) of this intoxicating talk-fest from writer/director, Richard Linklater, you are pretty much obligated by law to see this third one. It's the darkest and most intense of the three, but no less winning and likable.Co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have been credited as co-writers on 'Sunset' and 'Midnight.' It's clear that they know these characters, Jesse and Celine very, very well, giving them tremendous depth, complexity and back-story.  I love the way on each of these two later films how three creators plunge you right into Jesse and Celine's lives, then slowly fill you in on the details of what's transpired in the intervening years since the last installment ended.Often, this storytelling is done via exceptionally long, word-packed passages in which the characters do nothing more than interact with each other. Most notable: a single extended scene - easily more than 10 minutes in length - in which the two characters walk down a path and chat amiable.Then, by contrast towards the film's end, there's a devastating scene in which the two converse in a markedly different tone in a hotel room.  I'd been leery of seeing this scene as I'd been warned of its intensity and I have such good feelings towards these characters. Regardless, it's great movie-making...and bold stuff from Delpy, who really gives it everything during these climactic moments, both emotionally and physically. Though still beautiful, she's not afraid here to show us what a natural aging process looks like.",4,"If you've seen the first two installments of this intoxicating talk-fest, you're almost obligated to see Before Midnight",1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,1573,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset', 'intoxicating', 'talk-fest', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'obligated', 'law', 'see', 'third', 'one', 'darkest', 'most', 'intense', 'three', 'less', 'winning', 'likable.Co-stars', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'have', 'been', 'credited', 'co-writers', ""'Sunset"", ""'Midnight"", 'clear', 'know', 'characters', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'giving', 'tremendous', 'depth', 'complexity', 'back-story', 'love', 'way', 'two', 'later', 'films', 'how', 'three', 'creators', 'plunge', 'right', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'lives', 'then', 'slowly', 'fill', 'details', 'what', 'transpired', 'intervening', 'years', 'last', 'installment', 'ended.Often', 'storytelling', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'long', 'word-packed', 'passages', 'characters', 'do', 'nothing', 'more', 'interact', 'other', 'Most', 'notable', 'single', 'extended', 'scene', 'easily', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'length', 'two', 'characters', 'walk', 'path', 'chat', 'amiable.Then', 'contrast', 'film', 'end', 'devastating', 'scene', 'two', 'converse', 'markedly', 'different', 'tone', 'hotel', 'room', ""'d"", 'been', 'leery', 'seeing', 'scene', ""'d"", 'been', 'warned', 'intensity', 'have', 'such', 'good', 'feelings', 'characters', 'Regardless', 'great', 'movie-making', 'bold', 'stuff', 'Delpy', 'who', 'really', 'everything', 'climactic', 'moments', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'Though', 'still', 'not', 'afraid', 'here', 'show', 'what', 'natural', 'aging', 'process', 'looks']",Before Midnight

This particular movie was difficult for me to watch because it's so real and quite painful but that's my problem. Lots of people have negative comments about Celine's character during the fight scenes. Her behavior during the fight didn't bother me so much because people can say and do crazy things in anger. However I was bothered twice by her character when they weren't fighting. I was shocked right at the beginning when she was waiting for Jesse to say good bye to his son and she knew it would be emotional for him and he comes out of the airport and there is no compassion for him whatsoever. She's on her cellphone rattling about. I was thinking the previous Celine was more empathic and compassionate. And then when Jesse tells her that his grandmother has just died, you find out that Celine never met his grandmother in all that time. And she makes it clear that she doesn't want to go to the funeral with him. I thought that was a bit sad.This was all well before the fight and I guess that's when I realized this film wasn't going to be like the first two.

1655889,AE0HFVSVCXB6H,B00DJYJPLO,B. Wilson,"[0, 2]","Wow, what a thoroughly disappointing and depressing conclusion to an otherwise bright trilogy. I was certainly a big fan of the first two movies - they seemed to put the discussion of ideas and concepts at the forefront, ahead of simple emotional dramas. Unfortunately, as Before Midnight opens, we find Jesse and Celine embroiled in a terrible marriage - masquerading as something else. There is clearly no love left - just abuse pretending to be &#34;love&#34;. Celine is fat, mean, and profoundly attached to playing the victim. She has certainly not cared for herself, and she is incapable of truly caring for anyone else around her. She aggressively attacks Jesse on every front: as a man, as an artist, as a husband, and as a father. Any one of those deeply unkind comments should have been the end of the relationship - sadly it was not. Jesse is forced to do ever more degrading dances to simply get a smile out of Celine, and to keep her engaged. My question became: Why bother? What's the payoff? Nothing but more anger and silly displays of narcissism.If you liked the first two films, definitively skip this one - and instead imagine a happy, intimate, and creative future for this couple - you'll be much better off.",1,"Feel sorry for Jesse, very sorry...........",1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,1229,"['Wow', 'what', 'thoroughly', 'disappointing', 'depressing', 'conclusion', 'otherwise', 'bright', 'trilogy', 'was', 'certainly', 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'seemed', 'put', 'discussion', 'ideas', 'concepts', 'forefront', 'ahead', 'simple', 'emotional', 'dramas', 'Unfortunately', 'Midnight', 'opens', 'find', 'Jesse', 'Celine', 'embroiled', 'terrible', 'marriage', 'masquerading', 'something', 'else', 'clearly', 'love', 'left', 'just', 'pretending', 'be', '34', 'love', '34', 'Celine', 'fat', 'mean', 'profoundly', 'attached', 'playing', 'victim', 'certainly', 'not', 'cared', 'herself', 'incapable', 'truly', 'caring', 'anyone', 'else', 'aggressively', 'Jesse', 'front', 'man', 'artist', 'husband', 'father', 'one', 'deeply', 'unkind', 'comments', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'relationship', 'sadly', 'was', 'not', 'Jesse', 'forced', 'do', 'ever', 'more', 'degrading', 'dances', 'simply', 'get', 'smile', 'Celine', 'keep', 'engaged', 'question', 'became', 'Why', 'bother', 'What', 'payoff', 'Nothing', 'more', 'anger', 'silly', 'displays', 'narcissism.If', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'definitively', 'skip', 'one', 'instead', 'imagine', 'happy', 'intimate', 'creative', 'future', 'couple', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'better', 'off']",Before Midnight

Before Sunset is the uncertain but hopeful glance the teenager takes into their future, like a freshly graduated highschooler who stands between the past and the future. Before Midnight? The adult years. And parenthood.Before Midnight is filled with lush scenery, philosophical discussion, and excellent acting. Sound familiar? Yes, this third chapter maintains the high quality of the series and even manages to kick things up a notch. Before Sunset was better than the first film. And Before Midnight tops them all.Frank, authentic and deeply romantic, this third entry in the saga proves that, like a fine wine, Jesse and Celine simply get better with age.

Kudos to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy for creating this illusion, as well as Richard Linklater. But, really, this is Julie Delpy's show. She is simply radiant this time around, and deserving of award recognition. To call her performance the best of the year is fair praise.If this is the final chapter, then my heart is broken.

1655901,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00DJYJPLO,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","If a youthful sense of hope informsBefore Sunriseand a wistful sense of regret does the same inBefore Sunset, then a begrudging sense of resignation must be the overriding theme of this 2013 romantic drama as director and co-screenwriter Richard Linklater picks up the story of Jesse and Celine 18 years after they first met on a train to Vienna. This time, they are an established couple though tellingly, still not married. Jesse indeed left his loveless marriage after the end of ""Before Sunset"", and the lovers are now in their early forties raising twin girls. For the second time, Linklater wrote the script with co-stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, and together they achieve a level of familiarity with their characters' relationship that makes the incidental story resonate in ways quite unexpected. Unlike the first two films, there is no ticking clock manufactured to provide a need for resolution by the end. Instead, the fate of the couple's relationship is entirely in their hands, and now that we have an emotional investment in the characters, that's what makes this entry more compelling.The movie flows leisurely picking up the particular rhythms of conversations that show how words can become weapons. The story begins at the end of an idyllic Greek vacation where the couple has been staying with friends of various generations. As Jesse puts his now-adolescent son Henry on a plane headed back to Chicago, it becomes clear that his ex-wife didn't take the divorce well and now has full custody of Henry. Jesse shares with Celine his struggle in being so far away from Henry, and they banter about the challenges of parenthood and her indecision around accepting a government job. You would think that the stage they are in their lives would not yield much in the way of romantic sparks, but when they meet their friends for a farewell meal, they return to their familiar selves as they discuss the challenges in making human, much less romantic, connections in the digital age. Their friends decide to treat them to a romantic night at a nearby hotel, and the dialogue comes back to just the two of them. The chemistry between them percolates in a subtle manner as they walk to the hotel stopping to ponder the sunset.Once at the hotel, the friction begins mildly when the front desk clerk, an effusive fan of Jesse's books, insists Celine autograph her copies. Although she obviously served as his inspiration, she had nothing to do with the writing and bristles at the request. Then a phone call from Chicago sets off tensions that had been simmering between the two about the possibility of moving away from Paris to Chicago. Their verbal combat scene has the brutal honesty and up-and-down rhythms that feel more realistic than most such fights depicted onscreen, and that's what makes the scene more powerful since things said in the most matter-of-fact way sting with inevitable consequences. Looking understandably worn, Hawke and Delpy know their characters and each other's so well they don't need to sketch out a backstory.

1655906,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00DJYJPLO,FNDNreview,"[3, 5]","In 1996, Before Sunrise debuted to critical acclaim from viewers and critics.  The story is a spontaneous love story about a man and woman that meet on a train traveling to Vienna.  Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) depart the train together and spend their evening conversing in a variety of different locations within the city and eventually fall head over heels for each other.  However, Jesse is on his way back to the U.S. while Celine lives in Paris, making their relationship impossible.  In the end, they part ways without exchanging information, but promising to meet each other 6 months later.  The story ends without giving viewers an answer on whether they actually met for their plan rendezvous.The sequel, Before Sunrise, was released in 2004 and picks up nine years.  Jesse has just written a bestselling novel based on the events of the evening between himself and Celine.  He has traveled to Paris on a book tour, only to be visited by Celine at his book signing.  Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Jesse did show up six months after their evening together, but Celine was unable to attend due to the death of her grandmother.  Jesse and Celine spend the sequel catching up and reconnecting with one anther - revealing that Jesse is unhappily married and now has a son, while Celine is working for an environmental organization.  Once again, they spend their constrained time together (Jesse has to catch a flight back to the U.S.) talking about their lives and about what could have been.  In the end, the two realize they have a second chance with one another - and the film ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, presuming Jesse misses his flight to stay with Celine.Nine years after Jesse decides to miss his plane, Before Midnight picks up with Jesse and Celine together in a relationship, on vacation in Greece with their twin daughters.  Jesse is now divorced and separated from his son Hank who now lives in Chicago with his mother.  While they do still care for one another, Jesse and Celine's priorities have changed - Celine is now focused on her career, while Jesse (now the author of several novels) is focused on strengthening his relationship with his son.  They have now become the couple they always claimed they would fight to become - a couple that spends the majority of their time together resenting one another and arguing.Once again, Richard Linklater helms the directing chair as he, along with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, collaborate on this possible final chapter in the lives of Jesse and Celine.  Taking place loosely in real-time, the couple is much different than the last time these characters were on the big screen.  While Before Sunrise and Before Sunset were films about falling in love and rediscovering love, Before Midnight is very much a film about two people trying to figure out whether or not they are still in love.  Do they still have a future together or has their relationship run its course?  That's the question these characters contemplate for the entirety of this film.Like the previous films, the interaction between Hawke and Delpy is perfectly rounded and in depth as they easily feed off one another with each passing scene, un-layering each dimension of their personal lives.  The film is a filled with strong, relentless conversation (as usual) as the gaps are filled in for this second nine year gap  - in which it is revealed that the couple moved to the U.S. for a few years while Jesse wrote his novels and then back to Europe.  Jesse's second novel is based on the story of how they reconnected in Before Sunset.  However, as Jesse has made new writing friends and spent his time traveling the world for book signings, these characters have clearly lost faith in one another - both accusing each other of being unfaithful (and no, they never got married).Before Midnight is cut into several chapters, discussing a variety of subjects, which includes a film-long discussion about Jesse's desire to move to Chicago and the impact it would have on his relationship with Celine.  Unlike the previous films, several new characters are introduced and explored - Jesse's writing friends and their spouses.  Quite a bit of time is focused on the varying opinions from these new characters on the subjects of sex and relationships.  Make no mistake, love is still the underlying theme of this film - but it is also about evolution between two characters that found each other, found each other again, and decided to make a life for themselves despite the roadblocks.  Before Midnight is not a film about two people making spontaneous decisions as it predecessors.  These characters have matured and carefully dissect one another with each passing word and action, both looking to reclaim the happiness that was once in their hands but has faded with time.Overall, Before Midnight is simply the next chapter in a beautiful saga based around two individuals that met on a train.  The acting is as pleasant as ever and enjoyable to the very end.  It would appear the saga of Jesse and Celine is complete, however, that doesn't necessarily mean there won't be another chapter.  With undeveloped relationships to explore with their children, it's easily to imagine the next film(s) exploring the parents/ children dynamic.  And, I don't think you'll find a single person complaining if another film is made - but sooner than nine years would be great.  Regardless, this romance saga will go down in film history as one of the greatest love stories ever told.GRADE:  AFNDNreview.com",5,"Hawke, Delpy stellar in 'Before Midnight'",1378944000,"09 12,

1655910,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00DJYJPLO,Gryphonisle,"[20, 26]","From the very first of the ""Before..."" movies, the ""action"", such as exists, takes off when The Conversation takes off, which in the first two is when they start walking about.  In this installment, the movie is almost half over before they really get talking.  Of course, a lot has changed:  They're middle aged, divorced, and remarried (to each other) and have twin girls.  They have commitments.  They have baggage.  Still, when the conversation finally takes off, it very quickly becomes a bicker fest.She starts it off with a simple question:  Would you still ask me to get off the train with you?  One could imagine he's hearing that at almost every anniversary and probably does away with it by smiling, saying ""Of course"", adding a bit of flattery, and perhaps a kiss.  For what ever reason, this time he hesitates, and then he stammers, and now she feels old and fat.  To make matters worse, he's just said good bye to the son he lost via his own divorce;  now a teenager, he's just finished a summer in Greece, and wow, far from being the adorable talking pet little kids are, he's almost human.  You can converse with him, most of the time.  And Dad wants more.  Unfortunately, he wants it all, the best of his old life, and his new French family.  Needless to say, the wife isn't at all amused at his suggestion they uproot and move to Chicago, the proximity of the spurned wife hardly being the least of the attractions.  So off they go on their squabble.As film arguments go, this is not a notable fight.  One thinks of the nastiness of ""Long Days Journey Into Night"", or the epic booze filled brawl between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe"", where two puffy actors, beyond their physical prime,  go at it, round and round, until the climax where, in a white rage of hate and bitterness, not a single drop of self loathing and maliciousness is wasted.  One can no more imagine this couple trying to carry off a fight on that scale any more than we can imagine Maggie Smith lofting ""Un Bel Di"", or any other aria.  But still, if you're going to fight, fight, don't bicker.  What we end up with is a couple caught on a bad day, and not a particularly notable one at that.Ah well.  If you've already seen the other two you'll have to see this one.

Married couples are better at speaking to this, but even love is not enough to overcome the myriad challenges associated with long-term relationships.

The simplest argument can devolve into a grudge match over one or the other's intentions. But they still recognize how it would be to live without the other. I like to think it is because of this that they are able to reconcile. It is not sufficient to love one another. Each has to understand the price of loss.

That movie captured audiences slowly and became not only a great date film but a movie that showed two young people who meet on a train, spend time together and fall in love, even if only for one night. Ten years later they followed that up with BEFORE SUNSET and had Hawke's character Jesse, a successful writer who wrote about that evening, meeting up with Delpy's Celine once again. Both movies left an open ending with people unsure of what happened next. BEFORE MIDNIGHT answers some of those questions and leaves new ones by the end of the film.It is now 9 years since the last film and Jesse has left behind his wife and family to be with Celine. The pair have two children of their own, twin girls who are the light of their lives. The film opens with them about to end a vacation in Greece and Jesse taking his son Hank to the airport to fly home. His wife has custody and as they part, Jesse begins to dwell on his responsibility to his son and feeling how he hasn't been there for him. As he and Celine drive back to where they are staying, the home of another author they were invited to, they discuss their lives; what each one wants, Celine's possibly taking a job in Paris, Jesse feeling that he should be nearer Hank and what they both want from life.In a nutshell all things stem from those questions. The second segment has them at the friend's house over dinner where different couples relate their own views of love and relationships. From there it moves on to a walk that Celine and Jesse take through town. The last act ends up with them in a hotel room their friends have presented to them as a gift, a chance to get away from the crowd and the kids for a nice romantic evening. Oddly enough things never seem to turn out as planned.What could sound like a boring film is actually quite entertaining and interesting. There is no action and no extended scenes of lovemaking. Instead the art of conversation is seen from beginning to end. The fact that these actors could play through these scenes seamlessly is a credit to their abilities. From the conversation in the car to the round table discussion over dinner, every actor does an amazing job. The culmination of the relationship between Jesse and Celine at the hotel room is stunning to watch and as accurate a depiction of real life and romance as one will see in a film.It is obvious that both characters are in love with one another but the selfish side for each comes out at the worst possible moments and leads to one misunderstanding after another. Anyone in a long term relationship knows that wrong things are said, meanings are misunderstood and that love fluctuates from infatuation to anger in the blink of an eye. All of that is represented in this film as the pair tries to find the love they shared through the years. While we might all dream of storybook/fairy tale romance, the reality is always much different but also much deeper.I watched this film at the end of the night, tired and fearful that I might fall asleep not due to the film but because of the hour. Instead I found myself captured by the tale of Jesse and Celine, wanting to find out their solutions if any were found and hoping that their love would come through in the end. Sorry but you'll have to watch yourself to find out the answer to that one.

After a brief marriage and one child, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has married Celine (Julie Delpy), the original lovers who met briefly nearly 2 decades earlier.  They have twin girls about 6 and are vacationing in Greece, houseguests of a well-known writer.Jesse's earlier book about his brief romance with Celine has made him famous.  They now live in Paris which is problematic for Jesse because he rarely sees his teenage son who lives in America.  One of the persistently enjoyable aspects of this film and its predecessors is the wonderful writing.  As usual, the film is written by director Richard Linklater, Delpy and Hawke.  And as usual it all flows so naturally, you feel as if you are eavesdropping.Now married, we feel the couple maneuver through numerous landmines including career paths, domicile, child rearing, and finances as most couples do.  There are some uncomfortable moments to be sure, for the actors and the audience.  In one scene, they have an argument just before making love.  As the argument escalates, it continues for several minutes standing up, all while Celine remains bare chested.

Before Sunrise is one of my all time favorite films. It reminded me of a few chance meetings I had myself while traveling in Europe. Once, I met a wonderful Brazilian man in Florence. We both showed up at the train station without a booked room. He approached me and asked if I wanted to share a hotel. We ended up spending several days together exploring Florence, Pisa and the countryside. I spent a month in Italy and camera and all my film (yes, it was a while back) was stolen in the south of France. This guy sent me a photo of us in front of the Ponte Vecchio which is the only photo of my fantastic trip to Italy. It was a wonderful, wonderful memory and I think that is where it needs to stay. A memory. I think Jesse (Ethan Hawke) should have left Vienna in Vienna. Most movies are an escape from reality and do not represent real life. Before Midnight is what REALLY happens after the romance, after reality kicks in. And does it KICK-IN. At one point Jesse's character calls Celine the mayor of crazy town, but I think it is him that is crazy. He had this built-up fantasy of who Celine is and what their relationship should be. But I do believe he loves her and it could go either way at this point. I am just really happy I watched this film because sometimes when my life is s*****, I wonder what would have happened if I had run off with that Brazilian guy but the truth is, my life would probably still end up being s***** sometimes. Life. It is not all rosy but it does have it wonderful bits. Like the scenery in this film.

And now we get the third installment of this fanastic mini-franchise.As ""Before Midnight"" (2013 release; 109 min.) opens, we see Jessie (played by Ethan Hawke) dropping off his 13 yr. old son Hank at the Kalamata airport in the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece. From their conversation we learn that Hank spent the summer with Jessie and Celine on vacation in Greece. As Jessie gets to his car to drive off, we see Celine (played by Julie Delpy) and... their 7 yr. old twin daughters Ella and Nina! So yes indeed, Celine and Jessie became a couple, living in Paris, and now the parents of 2 girls. The remainder of the movie plays out that rest of the afternoon and evening, and to tell you much more of the 'plot' would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is another tour-de-force for director Richard Linklater and co-stars/co-writers Hawke and Delpy. The strenght of the movie is in its story-telling and character development. Keep in mind, there are really only 4 scenes in the movie: the drop-off and drive back from the airport, the evening dinner, the walk to the hotel, and the hotel room, that's it. Second, the two main characters' development is going into opposite directions: Jessie was not all that likeable in the first movie (for me anyway) but Celine was just darling. In the second movie, it was pretty much even keel. In ""Before Midnight"", Jessie has become the likeable character by far, whereas Celine comes across as resentful, bitter at times, and not very likeable far too often. At one point, in the middle of a heated argument, Celine hisses at Jessie ""you're no Henry Miller at any level!"", revealing an ugly side of Celine that we had never seen before. As we see these characters getting older, it's now also clear that they are struggling with guilt and remorse, and insecurity over their parenting skills as well.Bottom line: ""Before Midnight"" is a fantastic conversation-driven movie, inviting you to observe what's become (and still becoming) of Jessie and Celine, both as persons and as a couple. Here's hoping that we can give rendez-vous in 2022 for the next installment in the ""Before"" franchise.

It could very well be a stand alone film, it will resonate with many of us, married or not.Ethan Hawkes, plays Jesse, a world renowned writer, married to Celine, played by Julie Delpy. Both in their forties now. They met as young people on a train, together for a short while, then split and found each other again. Now, with two young beautiful daughters. His dreams realized, hers , not so much. Celine wants a career, her dream job. Jesse has just left his son off at the airport to make his sojourn home from Greece to Chicago. He feels much grief for not being there for his son. Left with a crazy, alcoholic mother who hates Jesse and his new wife. Much regret, as they try to work it out during this film.Celine, on the other Gand, has regrets and pent up desires. She has left her desires to make her life with her family. During this film, both Jesse and Celine, discuss in a constant compnversation their life, their wants, their desires, what is wrong and finally what is right.This is a gentle film with a lot of foundation. We learn a great deal from this couple, about themselves, and about ourselves. It will resonate, as I said, with everyone.

1655952,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00DJYJPLO,RMurray847,"[174, 187]","Let's first get two things out of the way.  If you've seen BEFORE SUNRISE and/or BEFORE SUNSET and disliked them...there is no reason to give BEFORE MIDNIGHT a try.  And if you haven't seen those movies at all, I HIGHLY recommend you do prior to checking out Richard Linklater's latest near classic.I should also warn that even the most cursory mention of plot points in either the 2ndor the 3rdmovie can be construed as spoilers...but it's tough to talk about the 3rdfilm without giving away some surprise.  I'll balance as best I can.In BEFORE SUNRISE, young American Jesse (Ethan Hawke), age about 23 meets young Frenchwoman Celine (Julie Delpy), age about 23.  They are on a train bound for Vienna.  Jesse is flying back to the US from Vienna the morning after the train arrives.  Celine is on her way back to Paris after visiting family in Budapest.  They strike up a conversation and clearly hit it off right away.  Jesse asks Celine to get off the train with him and spend the night wandering Vienna before he has to leave Europe.  The movie follows their ambling through Vienna and just lets them talk.  And talk.  And talk.  And fall in love.  For the right viewer, this was a nearly magical film that beautiful captured, through long, semi-improvised takes, the joy of two people getting to know each other and come to appreciate and even love each other.  We felt like we were right there with them, and the two stars gave terrific performances.  At the end, they agree they will meet again in 6 months, and we're left to wonder what happened to them.BEFORE SUNSET tells us (spoilers coming up).  It's nine years later, and Jesse is in Paris speaking about his new book, which is clearly a retelling of that night in Vienna.  Celine seeks him out and we quickly discover they did NOT meet (I won't spoil why).  Jesse has just an hour before he needs to leave for the airport, and he and Celine pick up their easy conversation and share about their lives, including the regrets and unhappinesses they've had.  It's clear they are meant to be together...their affection blooms almost immediately.  New to the equation are some minor quarrels (why didn't you come?  If only you hadn't..., etc.).  But in the end, Jesse is deciding to miss his flight so he can delight in being in Celine's apartment, drinking tea, listening to her sing.  The final scene of the movie is one of heartbreaking simplicity and yet such complex emotion.Now, another 9 years later, the two are each around 41 years old.  SPOILERS AHEAD.  They have been together since that time in Paris.  They've had a sometimes rocky road, and this movie is more talking...this time in lovely Greece.  They have kids.  They aren't ""new"" to each other anymore as they were in the first 2 films.  They are now capable of getting on each other's nerves.  They haven't always just made each other happy.  And near the end of the film, they engage in what I can only describe as the most brutal husband and wife argument since George and Martha got into it in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF.  There's no violence, but it's a rough scene.  Raw and searing.  Funny.  Truthful.  Utterly gripping.In real life, were I to spend much time with either of these two...I think I'd seriously dislike them.  They are self-centered, pretentiously ""artsy"" and VERY vocal.  I don't think I'd want to sit and listen to them talk all day.  But this is a film, and Linklater and his stars (who have co-writing credit) can take us to just the right moments.  The conversations (and snatches of conversation) that tell us all we need to know about the last nine years.  It's an amazing film.  It's illuminating and full of so many truths.  They may not always be truths I can personally relate to...but they feel true and possible and real.  After the film, you talk about Jesse and Celine as though they were real people.  More than just about any other movie ever, I think.  Their dialogue is so specific and so revealing.  Yes, these folks are more articulate than any ""real"" people...but we don't really want to see normal, sloppy conversation.  It's enjoyable to spend some time with these folks (although, again, I wouldn't like them in ""real life"") because they react to each other so believably.  Their words mirror their actions and their expressions.  Delpy and Hawke (who I'm not normally a huge fan of) have chemistry that's astonishing...you really feel you're peeking in on something you aren't meant to see and hear.All three films include gorgeous scenery, and BEFORE MIDNIGHT is the most gorgeous of all.  The Greek countryside and seaside is lovely, and Linklater just lets his camera take it in casually.  Jesse & Celine comment on it sometimes, but mostly it just flows over us.  And the film is mostly a series of very long takes (the scene near the opening when they are driving from the airport back to the house they're staying at is at least 15 minutes long, and seen entirely through a front windshield...but it NEVER feels static).  These films are made with such deceptive simplicity.I acknowledge that these films could also be insufferable to watch.  My wife and I rewatched the first two just before going to this latest release, and BEFORE SUNRISE feels a smidge pretentious now. I think that has more to do with the fact that I'm also 18 years older.  I have less patience for the naivet&eacute; of ""young love"" than I used to.  But that also brought home to me that a perfectly legitimate reaction to these films could be boredom or loathing of the characters.  But I consider myself lucky to be swept away by all three films...and in my opinion, BEFORE MIDNIGHT is best of the bunch.  It's gorgeous to look at.  It's richer in themes and content.  It features the biggest acting challenges and the most blistering dialogue.  It's hopeful (as all the films are), but the hope is the hardest fought and hardest won here.  I highly recommend all three films for ADULT viewers...not just because they contain some profane language, but because I can't imagine a child or teen really understanding what these two are blathering on about (or caring).  But if you're adult and you've been in love (or are in love) and have any inkling of the complications of being an adult in our world...this film should resonate resoundingly.",5,"An honest, gripping

Mclean ""sole poobah""","[0, 0]","This review assumes that you have seen the 'Before' Films. 1st Spoiler alert: It is not possible to assess 'Before Midnight' without bringing up 'The Fight'. Both of the 'Most Helpful' reviewers make the same false comparison to the legendary Burton/Taylor battles in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf'. That's not like comparing Apples and Oranges. More like 'Would you like the Greek Salad...or Cannabilism'? Try to imagine Taylor and Burton playing Celine and Jesse. We can't because it's absurd.After 18 years and over half way through this installment, 'Before...' is still an escapist romance strolling around a gentle coming of age story. What makes 'The Fight' so startling is that it IS at a believable level of vitriol.It is true to the character's crisis.2nd Spoiler: 'Before Midnight' has the right tone almost all the way through. But what a most unsatisfying ending. Not the unresolved questions- of course the sequel is all set-up as usual. Rather, there are two stunningly wrong moments. One is Jesse's response to the fight. Maybe he can stay on his feet through Celine's extended barrage. But he takes her final blow: ""I don't love you anymore"", like it was just another jab. They are 9 rounds into a final break-up...but he's FINE. He improvises an incredibly lame and patronizing make-up letter when being patronized is half of her complaint.

1655954,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00DJYJPLO,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","Watching ""Before Midnight,"" one is struck by how shallow and superficial most movies dealing with love and romance truly are.Principal credit goes to writer/director Richard Linklater, who has the uncanny gift for making all the dialogue he writes sound 100% real - given an invaluable assist from a cast of brilliant ad-libbing actors, that is. This talent is something he's demonstrated over and over again in his unique and utterly indispensable longitudinal study in romance: ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), ""Before Sunset"" (2004) and now his piece de resistance, ""Before Midnight.""The ""Before"" trilogy is similar to the ""Up"" documentary series, only instead of checking into the lives of some actual people every seven years as Michael Apted does, Linklater goes back to the same fictional couple every decade or so to see how it is they`re faring. When we first met Celine and Jesse in ""Before Sunrise,""  they  were two strangers in their twenties who, after a chance meeting aboard a train, proceeded to spend a romantic, albeit platonic, evening together in Vienna before he headed back to his home in the States and she to her life as a student in Paris. Though they vowed to reunite in six months time, they never actually did so.When, nine years later, they encountered each other again, at a book-signing in Paris, Jesse had become a successful writer, having used his encounter with Celine as fodder for a worldwide best seller, thereby capturing both her and the moment they shared in print forever. In his thirties at this point, Jesse revealed that he was married with a son, but that the marriage was an unhappy one. Celine, an environmental activist, had a boyfriend she rarely saw due to his job as a photojournalist. ""Before Sunset"" faded out on them finally consummating their relationship.As ""Before Midnight"" opens, we learn that Celine and Jesse have indeed become a couple and have twin daughters conceived in their night of passion. Jesse broods over the fact that he is living a continent away from his now-teenaged son , whom he gets to see only during the summer. Meanwhile, Celine, Jesse and the girls are spending their vacation traveling around Greece, staying with friends at a beautiful villa and taking in the sights.If ""Before Midnight"" reminds us of any film, it is Stanley Donen's great 1967 romance ""Two For the Road,"" with Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney as the long-married couple - also traveling through Europe - who have begun to take the long view of their relationship, examining how love and individuals change, sometimes for the better but often for the worse, over time (with its time-shifting narrative, Donen was able to accomplish in one movie what Linklater takes three to do - not that that in any way diminishes the achievement). Unlike most romantic dramas, which end just as the relationships are starting to become interesting, ""Two for the Road"" and ""Before Midnight"" hurtle bravely on into the future, to a point long after the initial concerns and rituals of courtship and giddy romance have faded and the realities and concerns of a far more prosaic everyday life have come to take their place.Infidelity, the demands of parenthood, the pressures of work and career, the idealism of youth fading into the cynicism and compromises of middle age - all these issues are put under the microscope and brought into sharp focus in ""Before Midnight,"" which clearly shows that Celine and Jesse are not the same people they were when we first met them - nor should we expect them to be. For life is not static, and neither are the people who are constantly being molded and shaped by the experiences it throws at them. The characters here talk about love and relationships with a depth and insight rarely found in even the most profound of personal dramas.Eschewing the plot mechanics and melodramatic contrivance that gum up so many movie romances, ""Before Midnight"" consists mainly of long, often single-take scenes that capture with uncanny accuracy the rhythm and flow of natural conversation. Jesse and Celine know each other so well - have become so comfortably intimate with one another as a couple - that they can talk about a wide range of topics, from the most trivial to the most profound, and not miss a beat, secure in the knowledge that the bond between them is stronger than anything they might express in words. That's how come they are able to emerge intact from a particularly withering half-hour-long argument in a hotel room in which souls are bared and long-simmering grievances are finally brought out into the open.Of course, the series could never be what it has become without the stellar work of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, two outstanding actors who have literally come to inhabit these characters over the course of three decades. Together they perfectly embody Linklater`s vision of what a real romantic couple looks and sounds like at various stages in their relationship. And it's all enhanced by a lovely musical score by Graham Reynolds that nicely brings out the romantic flavor of the piece.The idea that two distinct and strong-willed individuals can exist both as separate entities and as a couple - and make it work - is the thesis that informs every moment of ""Before Midnight.""  In his series, Linklater has wiped away the gauze that enwraps most movie romances to show us the real and vital thing that beats underneath. And, in so doing, he raises the bar that all future filmmakers, working in the genre from hereon out, will need to try to reach.",5,One-third of a romantic magnum opus,1389657600,"01 14,

1655955,A3VNYMNK7OC7CM,B00DJYJPLO,R. Sardrena,"[4, 6]","""Before Midnight"" is the third and probably last installment of romantic films starring Julia Delpy and Ethan Hawke as lovers Celine and Jesse.  The first film featured the couple as fresh-faced twenty-somethings in ""Before Sunrise"" back in 1994.  The subsequent films follow ""Sunrise's"" template; extremely talky, low-budget affairs set in picturesque European locales.  The third is set in Greece.  The length of intervals between films permits the viewer to see the actors/characters age and develop over the years.The second film, ""Before Sunset,"" established a tragic ""Affair to Remember"" type of scenario in which the lovers failed to reunite at the appointed time.  It ended on a hopeful note in which it appeared that - despite other relationships - the couple would finally be together.The theme of the third installment is: ""Be careful what you wish for.""  The promise of the earlier films has turned into poison as the couple struggles with vindictive exes, long-distance parenting, professional and marital dissatisfaction, and suppressed resentments.  The final act of ""Before Midnight"" is a long, ugly domestic fight in which Celine and Jesse say countless unforgivable things; the flaws which they were willing to gloss over in the past become ammunition for the nastiest character assassination game since ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.""Like its predecessors, ""Before Midnight"" has a flat, talky, pseudo-documentary feel that rings true.

I absolutely believed that Celine and Jesse's relationship could reach this crossroads. At the same time, I had to admit that this is what a middle-aged couple with kids would act and fight, even with such a romantic beginning as they did.

1655968,A376GITYM7MQ6J,B00DJYJPLO,Thiago Sardenberg,"[17, 20]","A couple meets on a train and spends a life-changing night in Vienna. They part ways. Nine years later, they meet again in Paris, where they reconnect and wonder what life would be like if they hadn't gone on their own paths. And now, nine more years have gone by as we meet them again, married with children.In most movies, this would be the definition of `happily ever after'. Sure, 'Before Midnight' could easily have turned into a soapy tearjerker in the wrong hands, but under the helm of Linklater, Delpy and Hawke, it turns into something that is rarely witnessed in cinema: A movie that has love at its very core, but at the same time, is almost anti-romantic. At the very least, it challenges most people's notion of what 'romantic' is.This couple is real and their issues are real. Their staying together for a decade and having had kids has taken a toll on them. The movie, unlike `Before Sunrise' or `Sunset', is no longer about a random encounter in a beautiful European city. It is about sharing a life together, and the difficulty to accept people for what they really are. It is about intimacy (or lack thereof), guilt and things left unsaid. It is about a love that does not do ""happily ever after"". It is about ""and now, what?""And precisely because of that, it is human. Its humanity lies in reflecting the flaws and the heartbreak that is so close to anyone who's ever had a fully committed relationship permeated by love. And coming to terms with how each single person relates to this overpowering force of nature is one of the biggest challenges a couple can face. With `Midnight', these immense characters, that almost carry a larger-than-life weight on their shoulders, have reached a brand new level of depth that makes this entry, perhaps, the best in the series.At the end of the film, I heard a woman whisper to her male companion, ""but where is the love?"". Well, I definitely saw love - rough and complex and beautiful. I did feel like handing her a copy of ""A walk to remember"", though. If you're looking for a fairy tale, you are in for a perfect disappointment.  But if you are looking for an immensely enriching walk that is both exhilarating and heart-breaking, look no further.

1655971,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00DJYJPLO,Tom Birkenstock,"[6, 9]","The Before films never previously dealt with relationships.  Or at least they never dealt with the day in, day out labor of maintaining a relationship over the course of years.  Before Sunrise lovingly details the opening stages of romance, and Before Sunset reignites this relationship while including the added pressures of growing older.  Before Midnight, then, is the first of this series to actually investigate how Jessie and Celine might function as a married couple entering into middle age together.As its impossibly gorgeous European locale, Before Midnight takes Greece.  Jessie has been invited to a kind of summer writers program at the home of a Grecian author.  Jessie's son from his first marriage, Hank, has spent his summer in Greece with Jessie and Celine.  The film's opening sees Jessie sending Hank back home, and it captures the nice dynamic between an inarticulate early teen and his loquacious father.  Jessie keeps on trying to engage his son in conversation, but Hank doesn't bite, and you start to think that maybe the relationship between the two is strained.  But before passing through security, Hank blurts out that this has been the best summer of his life.  Jessie returns to Celine and their twin blonde headed moppets who are waiting outside the airport, but it is clear that the geographical divide between he and his son weighs on Jessie, a problem that has subtly torn at Celine and Jessie's relationship.Like the two prior films, Before Midnight could easily have been produced as a stage play.  The film can be divided into at least four distinct parts: the drive home from the airport, the Grecian dinner party, the walk to the hotel, and the confrontation at the hotel.  In each section, the camera maintains long shots that hold for what I would imagine are at least ten minutes at a time.  The drive home appears to be nearly one long shot.  But Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have developed such charisma and so easily inhabit these characters that their back and forth creates a kind of suspense.  We wish to know what each character will say next.The movie's fulcrum is a playful dinner scene where several generations of diners discuss the possibilities and permutations of relationships.  A twenty-something couple who are clearly infatuated with each other at the same time deny that monogamy is even possible.  A couple, around the same age as Jessie and Celine, clearly takes a cynical view of their relationship and never really take it seriously.  The elderly host, meanwhile, speaks to the necessity of always being two in a relationship, of never fully melding your identity with that of your husband or wife.  In one story that's bandied about, a guest recounts a lengthy autobiography/letter left behind by her grandmother where her husband only takes up a grand total of a few pages.  For this woman, her female friends were the relationships she truly cherished.The entire film culminates with a confrontation in a hotel room.  As a present, Jessie and Celine were given a hotel room for the night so that they could get away from their two daughters and have a romantic evening.  This eventually results in a truly epic fight.  But on their walk to the hotel, the two engage in the kinds of conversations that we have come to expect from these two.  At the same time it is clear that after nine years, these little tete-a-tete's have become increasingly rare.  After reaching the hotel, their romantic evening is stymied by an argument that begins with an off handed comment Jessie made earlier about wanting to move back to the States in order to be closer to his son, a comment which resulted in a number of subtle and not so subtle jabs by Celine over the course of the day.  But soon the argument veers off in a number of directions, building on nine years of issues left unresolved.Perhaps the closest cinematic equivalent to the blow up between Celine and Jessie is the Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?  But despite the level of anger and the deep wounds Celine and Jessie inflict on one another over the course of this argument, it never quite veers into the bleak cynicism of Wolf.  Burton and Taylor's characters love seemed to manifest only when they were tearing at one another.  It knew no other form.  We know that Celine and Jessie are capable of transcending all of the every day difficulties of life.  Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater also manage to stage the fight in such a way that it veers from raw to humorous.  A combatant might spew an argument ending decree only to come back with an ""And another thing...""  The filmmakers are also careful to take the complaints of disappointments and unmet needs seriously.  Neither character is fully right nor wrong.  When Celine engages in a typical feminist argument that she is burdened with the childcare, we might not fully agree with the degree of her claims.  But at the same time it's clear that Jessie is attempting to position her as the irrational female.  No doubt, there is some truth in Celine's critique that sexism affects their relationship.Before entering the hotel, Jessie and Celine sit by the Mediterranean watching the sunset.  Jessie narrates the sun's disappearance over some seaside cliffs: ""Still there. Still there. Still there. It's gone.""  The fight in the hotel room is at times so mean spirited, so vicious that it could easily be the end.  Their relationship might one day be there and the next gone.  And like the previous two films, things end somewhat ambiguously.  We are not given full closure on the story of Jessie and Celine, because as an audience, we must leave before their narrative is truly over.  But call me an optimist, because I think these two will stay together long into old age.  Despite it all, they are just too interesting together to break up.It's hard to overstate what the trio of Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater have accomplished with the Before Trilogy.  Each successive movie only deepens these characters.  And the themes have become more nuanced, more multifaceted with time.  If Before Midnight isn't the most enjoyable of the three movies (and that's not to say it is ever dull), it is perhaps the best of the trilogy.  My guess is that Midnight marks the end of this series, but without a doubt the relationship between Jessie and Celine lives on in the minds of their fans.  The characters seem to live outside of the screen.",5,Perfect Ending to Richard Linklater's Meditation on Love,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,6444,"['Before', 'films', 'never', 'previously',

Before Sunrise was OK but a little slow moving. Before Sunset was better but still nothing amazing. This one is far and away the best of the trilogy and feels the most real. Sunrise is about a chance meeting on a train. Sunset is about reconnecting love after a book tour brings him to the place she is. This one deals with real world issues and finally answers the question of if these two should be together or should they have left it as a one night meeting. I'm sure I'm not the only one to say this but this reminded me of me and my wife and fights we have had. That aspect may have helped me really get into this movie but either way this is the best of the three and I recommend this which is something I can't really say about the other two. Overall, a movie for couples to watch together. Most will see similarities. I liked it. I give it a B+.",4,A movie for couples to watch together. Most will see similarities.

I didn&#8217;t expect this because I thought there was no way to continue the story after the ending scene of &#8220;Before Sunset.&#8221; But filmmakers including director Richard Linklater seem to think differently. In the new chapter &#8220;Before Midnight&#8221; Jesse and Celine are facing midlife crisis and other problems.Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are spending the summer in Greece. Nine years have passed since the ending of the previous film, and Jesse is now a successful writer while Celine is an environmental activist. They have cute twin daughters but seem a little unhappy. And it goes on and on.The problem about the latest entry in the &#8220;Before&#8221; trilogy is that the characters and their love story is no longer refreshing for fans of the previous films. Their intellectual dialogue can hardly cover the fact that whatever they are complaining of or arguing over has been done somewhere else countless times. Yes, of course, even Jesse and Celine, having lived together for nine years, can quarrel endlessly, but is this what we want to see after watching &#8220;Before Sunrise&#8221; and &#8220;Before Sunset&#8221;?After all it is all up to you whether you like &#8220;Before Midnight&#8221; or not. Continuation of &#8220;Before Sunset&#8221; is a love story, but not of the same kind as the one in &#8220;Sunset&#8221; and &#8220;Sunrise.&#8221; I saw &#8220;Sunset&#8221; and &#8220;Sunrise&#8221; and liked both of them for the romantic mood and palpable sense of &#8220;time is running out&#8221; for Jesse and Celine.

1655975,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00DJYJPLO,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Richard Linklater has served up a good number of worthy cinematic items in the past decade including 'School of Rock', 'Fast Food Nation', 'Me and Orson Welles' and 'Bernie'. He also has the two prequels to 'Before Midnight', ''Before Sunrise' and 'Before Sunset', which I have not seen, but hear were pretty good. 'Before Midnight' picks up the story nine years later, with novelist and part-time professor Jesse (Ethan Hawke) dropping off his son at the airport on the Greek Pelopennese peninsula where he's been vacationing with wife C&eacute;line (Julie Delpy) and their two young twin daughters (Seamus Davy-Fitzpatrick is a knockout as Jesse's son sensitive son, Hank, who we meet briefly at the beginning of the film).The unfortunate thing about 'Before Midnight' is that for two-thirds of the film, it violates the screenwriter's canon which is of course, 'show don't tell'. Sure there are films that are dialogue heavy and sometimes they work well, especially in the case of a courtroom drama. But 'Before Midnight' is not a courtroom drama. It's an examination of a relationship between a long-time married couple, possibly coming apart at the seams. But until the gripping conclusion, there is little conflict.Instead, we're treated to a great deal of witty banter between the principals, some of which is quite interesting, but in the end, hardly memorable. To make matters worse, some of these conversations take place in one spot--the worst of which occurs as Jesse and C&eacute;line (along with their two children who hardly play a role at all in the story) drone on and on inside their car, as they drive from the airport, after dropping off Jesse's son. It's maddening to sit there with the camera never shifting an iota, as the two principals converse.Things improve slightly when Jesse and C&eacute;line arrive at the home of a Greek writer friend and there are other adults there, including the writer's son and his wife, who add their two cents regarding life's travails. Perhaps the highlight there is Delpy's seductive Marilyn Monroe impersonation. Later, Jesse and C&eacute;line take a long walk through a tourist spot, ending up inside an ancient Greek Orthodox shrine (there C&eacute;line makes some rather sacrilegious sexual comments which weren't very amusing).'Before Midnight' finally picks up when Jesse and C&eacute;line return to their hotel room and go at one another. At last the characters seem to find their voice and the conflict becomes apparent. Jesse is accused by C&eacute;line of focusing too much on his son, to the detriment of their relationship. And C&eacute;line in Jesse's eyes is a whiner who seeks approbation as a beleaguered feminist. Clearly the more nuanced portrait of the two is that of C&eacute;line, who really does come off as unreasonable and neurotic. It's only through Jesse's patience that the ship finally is righted and the relationship is restored to a semblance of equilibrium.Clearly 'Before Midnight' is one of the overrated indies of the year. Yes, one must admire the witty repartee between Hawke and Delpy as well as the high intellectual level in most of the dialogue throughout the film. Nonetheless, as noted above, one becomes restless for the central conflict to emerge and overwhelmed by the amount of dialogue. With so many ideas tossed about, it's hard to remember hardly any of them--those who have seen the film more than once, probably could appreciate it more. A healthy balance between all the ideas and the visuals is what 'Before Midnight' really needed. Unfortunately, the film remains top heavy with so much dialogue, that it ends up too heavily weighted toward the intellect, than to the heart.",2,Gripping final third of Hawke-Delpy marital discord show consumed by earlier two thirds of static talk-fest,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,3748,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', '5.0Richard', 'Linklater', 'served', 'up', 'good', 'number', 'worthy', 'cinematic', 'items', 'past', 'decade', 'including', ""'School"", 'Rock', 'Food', 'Nation', ""'Me"", 'Orson', 'Welles', ""'Bernie"", 'also', 'two', 'prequels', ""'Before"", 'Midnight', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'hear', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'Midnight', 'picks', 'story', 'nine', 'years', 'later', 'novelist', 'part-time', 'professor', 'Jesse', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'dropping', 'off', 'son', 'airport', 'Greek', 'Pelopennese', 'peninsula', 'where', 'been', 'vacationing', 'wife', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'Julie', 'Delpy', 'two', 'young', 'twin', 'daughters', 'Seamus', 'Davy-Fitzpatrick', 'knockout', 'Jesse', 'son', 'sensitive', 'son', 'Hank', 'who', 'meet', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'film', '.The', 'unfortunate', 'thing', ""'Before"", 'Midnight', 'two-thirds', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'canon', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Sure', 'are', 'films', 'are', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'sometimes', 'work', 'well', 'especially', 'case', 'courtroom', 'drama', ""'Before"", 'Midnight', 'not', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'examination', 'relationship', 'long-time', 'married', 'couple', 'possibly', 'coming', 'apart', 'seams', 'gripping', 'conclusion', 'little', 'conflict.Instead', ""'re"", 'treated', 'great', 'deal', 'witty', 'banter', 'principals', 'quite', 'interesting', 'end', 'hardly', 'memorable', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'conversations', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'spot', 'worst', 'Jesse', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'hardly', 'play', 'role', 'story', 'drone', 'car', 'drive', 'airport', 'dropping', 'off', 'Jesse', 'son', 'maddening', 'sit', 'camera', 'never', 'shifting', 'iota', 'two', 'principals', 'converse.Things', 'improve', 'slightly', 'when', 'Jesse', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'arrive', 'home', 'Greek', 'writer', 'friend', 'are', 'other', 'adults', 'there', 'including', 'writer', 'son', 'wife', 'who', 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'regarding', 'life', 'travails', 'Perhaps', 'highlight', 'Delpy', 'seductive', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'impersonation', 'Later', 'Jesse', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'take', 'long', 'walk', 'tourist', 'spot', 'ending', 'up', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'Orthodox', 'shrine', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'rather', 'sacrilegious', 'sexual', 'comments', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'amusing', 'Midnight', 'finally', 'up', 'when', 'Jesse', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'return', 'hotel', 'room', 'go', 'one', 'last', 'characters', 'seem', 'find', 'voice', 'conflict', 'apparent', 'Jesse', 'accused', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'son', 'detriment', 'relationship', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'Jesse', 'eyes', 'whiner', 'who', 'approbation', 'beleaguered', 'feminist', 'Clearly', 'more', 'nuanced', 'portrait', 'two', 'C', 'eacute', 'line', 'who', 'really', 'come', 'off', 'unreasonable', 'neurotic', 'only', 'Jesse', 'patience', 'ship', 'finally', 'righted', 'relationship', 'restored', 'semblance', 'equilibrium.Clearly', 'Midnight', 'one', 'overrated', 'indies', 'year', 'Yes', 'one', 'must', 'admire', 'witty', 'repartee', 'Hawke', 'Delpy', 'as', 'well', 'high', 'intellectual', 'level', 'most', 'dialogue', 'film', 'Nonetheless', 'noted', 'one', 'restless', 'central', 'conflict', 'emerge', 'overwhelmed', 'amount', 'dialogue', 'so', 'many', 'ideas', 'tossed', 'hard', 'remember', 'hardly', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'more', 'once', 'probably', 'could', 'appreciate', 'more', 'healthy', 'balance', 'ideas', 'visuals', 'what', 'Midnight', 'really', 'needed', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'top', 'heavy', 'so', 'much', 'dialogue', 'up', 'too', 'heavily', 'weighted', 'intellect', 'heart']",Before Midnight
