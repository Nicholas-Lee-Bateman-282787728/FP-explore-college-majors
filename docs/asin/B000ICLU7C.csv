Its difficult to go into a lot of character development when you have 7 characters (not counting the bad guys) to fit into a two hour movie. It would have been nice to find out more about the bad guys also. And yes you have to ""fill in the blanks"" because it doesn't explain a lot but hey its not a four hour movie so they can only do so much.  But you can also simply relax and just enjoy an action flix. It reminded me of the Magnificent 7 and 7 Samurai in that there are 7 of them coming to the aid of a 'helpless' village against the bad guys. If you like action/martial arts movies at least rent this one.While its not the best action flix its not the worst neither. I certainly enjoyed it more than Crank (which I had high expectations for, hoping it would be as good as Transporter.)I'd give it 3 1/2+ stars but bumped it up to 4 rather than down to 3 due to the extra features along with an uncut version (haven't viewed that just yet but did go through most of the interviews.)I'm considering getting the Seven Swordsmen DVD box set which according to reviewers of that TV Series is a more detailed story about the individual characters.",4,Enjoy the movie,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,1183,"['Yes', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'correct', 'difficult', 'go', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'when', 'have', '7', 'characters', 'not', 'counting', 'bad', 'guys', 'fit', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'bad', 'guys', 'also', 'yes', 'have', 'fill', 'blanks', ""n't"", 'explain', 'lot', 'hey', 'not', 'four', 'hour', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'also', 'simply', 'relax', 'just', 'enjoy', 'action', 'flix', 'reminded', 'Magnificent', '7', '7', 'Samurai', 'are', '7', 'coming', 'aid', ""'helpless"", 'village', 'bad', 'guys', 'like', 'action/martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'least', 'rent', 'not', 'best', 'action', 'flix', 'not', 'worst', 'neither', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'Crank', 'had', 'high', 'expectations', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Transporter', ""'d"", 'give', '3', '1/2+', 'stars', 'bumped', '4', 'rather', 'down', '3', 'due', 'extra', 'features', 'uncut', 'version', 'have', ""n't"", 'viewed', 'just', 'yet', 'did', 'go', 'most', 'interviews', ""'m"", 'considering', 'getting', 'Seven', 'Swordsmen', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'according', 'reviewers', 'TV', 'Series', 'more', 'detailed', 'story', 'individual', 'characters']",N/A

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[4, 4]","Seven unique swordsmen(including one swords-woman) band together to save a village and its people from the evil General Fire-Wind.  And that's about all you need to know about the plot... and that's what is so great about this film!  Although two and a half hours long it has so many fantastic characters and battles you won't find yourself checking the timer on the DVD player once.  For those who find Wuxia films like Hero, House Of Flying Daggers, and Curse Of The Golden Flower to be perfect you may lose interest in this quickly.  Gone is alot of the ""beautiful"" and artistic fights only to be replaced with more brutal swordplay action that leaves heads split and limbs detached... and thankfully next to zero flying!  Many reviewers have blasted the movie for cutting its original runtime of over four hours(!) to the aforementioned two and a half, and although I'm one of the fans who would love to see the full version too, I can't knock the reasoning for the edits(although a second disc with the full-length film would have been nice Dragon Dynasty!) and they seem to have been done as well as was posible.  It's true that you don't get to know all of the characters as good as you would like, but you get enough to keep you more than interested in them until the very end.  Another knock is the stylish garb of the villains, who look like they have been displaced from a Mad Max movie rather then ancient China.  But still, once you see just how vicious and ruthless they are, the costumes seem like a perfect choice.  This is a must see for fans of Asian cinema, epic action films, or just plain old good movies... not to mention it's a nice return to form for director Tsui Hark(The Blade, Zu Warriors From The Magic Mountain, Once Upon A Time In China 1-3).",5,Looking for a Wuxia film that sacrifices most of the flying and art for epic characters and battles?

The production quality, and the cinematography grabs the hand of this movie and leads it down the road of masterpiece. But it's either the story or the editing that walks with the two left feet along the way. This movie probably needed another hour in order to pull off what it wanted to accomplish -- which is be an Action Story, and not just an Action Movie. The Director had the admirable goal of making us an emotional spectator, but because he's burdened with placing Seven Protagonists behind the Seven Swords, he has only a handful of minutues to offer any kind of substantial backstory to each character. There were times when the subtext of some character seemed to have just emerged out of nowhere. I'd give examples, but to be honest, I can't identify any of the multi-characters by name. so I'll just say, as an example, that ""some guy"" whose backstory was that of a farmer (I think) seemed to be pretty broken up when it was decided that he had to set his horses free. Especially, the Horse JoyLuck, whose name I can remember. By the way, I'm *not* being sarcastic here. That was really how I approached that scene, since prior to it, I can't recall any build up. Maybe I missed it.Amazingly, despite the cloudiness of the JoyLuck scene, I was still somewhat moved by it, a sure credit to the cinematography and the heart breaking score by Kenji Kawai. Both do an amazing job of compensating for what I just couldn't gather from the story. I have to believe that juggling seven characters in the writers/directors world is as dangerous as juggling seven swords. And despite my clueless detachment from the motivation of the characters, I enjoyed watching them when they went into battle.

One very small example - two refugees are hiding out in a blizzard with a man who appears to be some kind of Sherpa herdsman; the people do not understand one another so communication is nonexistent, suddenly giant meteors fall and a hidden valley with bright flowers appears for a moment, after which the snow is in place again and the Ancient Master of All Martial Wisdom sends forth the seven swordspersons to defend the poor villagers from the Emperor's servants, who behead everything in sight.

The film has shot itself in the foot with too much plot, confusing sub character plots, plot holes and some very confusing sequences and over complex storytelling.  So many characters to get to know, the bad dudes and the origin of these 7 enchanted swords, a lot to digest in one movie when all you want to see is these different fighters and their swords in action.Let's face it, movies like this are about the action, and when this movie does it right it's really right.  A lot of the fight scenes seem to fall short until the end of the film, and then they rock.  You get to see all the swords in action and each person use there own skill and techniques that make them unique.  The finial fight between the main bad dude and Donnie Yen is worth the price of the movie itself.  Some awesome swordplay and flawless wire work, it's just awesome.  I don't know if I could sit though this movie again but I pop it in and watch the fight scenes all the time.  I love Tsui Hark as a director but this one was filled with too much other stuff.  I do love the look of the film and I unfortunately have one of the foreign DVD's with no dubbing, so keeping up with the plot and watching everything happening is a bit difficult.  Since it just got an American DVD release I would recommend this to any fan of Donnie Yen or fans of martial arts films that are a bit out of the box.

The Manchurians have taken over China and built the Qing Dynasty. The new government is banning the practice of Martial Arts fearing that the villages that practice it could rebel. This ban is far worst than you can imagine, the services of the Fire-Wind army are acquired to help make this law certain. The only thing the army cares about is money and they make a profit off eliminating entire villages that practice martial arts to make sure a martial artists never walks the earth again. The next village is the final frontier, Martial Village and Fire-Wind has their eyes set on it. After learning this information from an old man named Fu Qingzhu (Liu Chia-Liang) escaping Fire-Wind to save the art. You may remember Liu from Drunken Master 2.In seek of help Fu accompanied by two villagers go searching for the Heavenly Mountains. Heavenly Mountains give them help, 4 fighters and seven swords. Three swords go to Fu and the two villagers but the only one of them who is truly skilled is Fu. After receiving this help the seven swords hurry back to the village but do they get there in time. The three star rating was a hard one to decide on simply because this is a great movie but things are missing. The biggest being that the movie is edited to about 2 hours and 33 minutes but the original unedited film is said to be about 4 hours long. The editing is horrible; too much scene jumping and you feel like you missed things throughout the entire movie. You'll be sitting there asking questions like when did they get there or do that? Who is that? And when did he learn to do that?Now of course since this is called ""Seven Swords"" the comparisons with ""Seven Samurai"" may come flying and yea it's like it and no it's not as good but this is still a descent film. If Dragon Dynasty were to put a second disc in the case with the unedited version like they did with ""The Protector"" this movie would get a way higher rating from me. I have so many things I loved about this movie though one being the amazing fight scenes and choreography. Donnie Yen was the best of them all and his character also got most of the spotlight. The things they thought up for this movie is sick, like sword fights in tight cramped spaces, which may sound impossible, but they definitely pulled it off.The acting was really good, the camera angles were great, and though the picture was cool it could've been better lit. I understand that bad character development may kill the movie a bit for some which is another thing that can probably be chalked up to the bad editing. The cool thing is that this could definitely be mad into a sequel; I think there is a plan to make a couple more. The characters sure so good that they could have their own movie after these films especially Donnie Yen who deserves one. Seven Swords is a film that could be great if that other hour and 30 minutes can be put back in but for right now take it as it is cause it's worth seeing.",3,Is It The Swords Or The Editing,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,3054,"['Based', 'mid', '1600', 'Seven', 'Swords', 'death', 'greed', 'course', 'seven', 'heroes', 'Manchurians', 'have', 'taken', 'China', 'built', 'Qing', 'Dynasty', 'new', 'government', 'banning', 'practice', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'fearing', 'villages', 'practice', 'could', 'rebel', 'ban', 'far', 'worst', 'can', 'imagine', 'services', 'Fire-Wind', 'army', 'are', 'acquired', 'help', 'make', 'law', 'certain', 'only', 'thing', 'army', 'cares', 'money', 'make', 'profit', 'eliminating', 'entire', 'villages', 'practice', 'martial', 'arts', 'make', 'sure', 'martial', 'artists', 'never', 'walks', 'earth', 'again', 'next', 'village', 'final', 'frontier', 'Martial', 'Village', 'Fire-Wind', 'eyes', 'set', 'learning', 'information', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Fu', 'Qingzhu', 'Liu', 'Chia-Liang', 'escaping', 'Fire-Wind', 'save', 'art', 'may', 'remember', 'Liu', 'Drunken', 'Master', '2.In', 'seek', 'help', 'Fu', 'accompanied', 'two', 'villagers', 'go', 'searching', 'Heavenly', 'Mountains', 'Heavenly', 'Mountains', 'give', 'help', '4', 'fighters', 'seven', 'swords', 'Three', 'swords', 'go', 'Fu', 'two', 'villagers', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'truly', 'skilled', 'Fu', 'receiving', 'help', 'seven', 'swords', 'hurry', 'back', 'village', 'do', 'get', 'there', 'time', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'hard', 'one', 'decide', 'simply', 'great', 'movie', 'things', 'are', 'missing', 'biggest', 'being', 'movie', 'edited', '2', 'hours', '33', 'minutes', 'original', 'unedited', 'film', 'said', 'be', '4', 'hours', 'long', 'editing', 'horrible', 'too', 'much', 'scene', 'jumping', 'feel', 'missed', 'things', 'entire', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sitting', 'there', 'asking', 'questions', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'do', 'Who', 'when', 'did', 'learn', 'do', 'Now', 'course', 'called', 'Seven', 'Swords', 'comparisons', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'may', 'come', 'flying', 'yea', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'still', 'descent', 'film', 'Dragon', 'Dynasty', 'were', 'put', 'second', 'disc', 'case', 'unedited', 'version', 'did', 'Protector', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'way', 'higher', 'rating', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'loved', 'movie', 'one', 'being', 'amazing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'choreography', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'was', 'best', 'character', 'also', 'got', 'most', 'spotlight', 'things', 'thought', 'up', 'movie', 'sick', 'sword', 'fights', 'tight', 'cramped', 'spaces', 'may', 'sound', 'impossible', 'definitely', 'pulled', 'off.The', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'camera', 'angles', 'were', 'great', 'picture', 'was', 'cool', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'lit', 'understand', 'bad', 'character', 'development', 'may', 'kill', 'movie', 'bit', 'thing', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'bad', 'editing', 'cool', 'thing', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'mad', 'sequel', 'think', 'plan', 'make', 'couple', 'more', 'characters', 'sure', 'so', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'own', 'movie', 'films', 'especially', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'who', 'one', 'Seven', 'Swords', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'other', 'hour', '30', 'minutes', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'back', 'right', 'now', 'take', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

The only real complaint I had, beyond the aforementioned wholes in the story, would be the dubbing.  Most was very off, but donnie yens voice sounded more like he was michael clark duncan than donnie yen.

They don't have a lot of character development.  Some characters you will understand but most will leave you with a lot of questions.  Even Donnie Yen's character who they probably went the most in depth on didn't get full treatment.  Maybe it was just that he was speaking Korean bugged me.  It is just weird.  There is nothing to really carry the story, except the General who is always going to come after the seven swordsmen and the villagers they are protecting.  While the violence is well done and the General's top soldiers are truly wicked and have great battle sequences, everything else is just way too standard.  The villian is ruthless and just cruel as he can be, the heroes are all very honorable, just nothing really exciting happens.  The villain was by far my favorite character but he is not the main character.  The acting is good and has some very nice touches with Lau Kar Leung playing Fu and Jason Pao Paio playing the leader of the town.  The soundtrack is great.  The locations and cinematography are stunning.  Costumes really don't get any better than this.  I liked the unique editing.  The special effects are great and it was done by Weta Workshop who did the CGI for The Lord Of the Rings movies. Unfortunately all of this cannot overcome a story that just doesn't draw you in.  By the end of it you realize that the swords were the main story which I liked and the final fight isn't too bad.  Actually, the action starts out very well but doesn't really get good again until the end.  You will most likely want to watch this movie again since its not half bad, it just doesn't make complete sense.  After seeing it once and watching it again, for me there will be no 3rd viewing.  I would no doubt watch a part 2 if Tsui Hark ever decides to makes it but I have heard talk of this ever since this ""first part"" was made and after a while it is too easy to forget about a movie project.  I found the TV show 'Seven Swordsmen' with Vincent Zhao and Ada Choi much more enjoyable.  Of course, it had a lot more time to explain the characters being 39 one hour episodes long.  I was hoping to buy this movie and prove the other reviewers wrong but it just didn't happen.  Luckily there are enough extras on this to keep me busy for a while.Dragon Dynasty puts outs out the uncut version as opposed to the shortened version which is widely distributed.  The sound and picture are truly some of the best you will find.  5.1 English and 5.1 with the original soundtrack.  When the Dragon Sword gets pulled out expect a roar from the subwoofer.  It is sad how neither Dragon Dynasty or Image's releases have had the subtitles properly in the black bars with all of them being widescreened.  I suppose this is minor.Special features include a feature commentary with the director of the movie Tsui Hark and Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan.  That is 154 minutes with these 2.  Very enjoyable.  While I didn't love the movie, you may have, and this is the best special feature you could ever imagine.  Not to mention the rest of the extras.Six extended and deleted scenes and one 10 minute alternate take(final fight).  Best part of this is that we get WAYYYYY more Donnie Yen action.Four 5-7 minute behind the scenes featurettes.Interviews include 45 minutes from Tsui Hark.  Talk about in depth, with the commentary you get 200 minutes of interview time with the director.  He knows there were problems with the movie as a whole and is not afraid to talk about any of it.  Can't really complain about this special feature.26 minutes with Donnie Yen.  He talks about what is was like playing his character and gives his thoughts on the director and the movie.18 minutes with Zhang Jing Chu talking about where she grew up and how she became an actress.  I love the quote on her childhood about being 3 years older than the other people in her class.  She says ""her parents wanted her to be simply outstanding.""  At 16 years old she wants to become an artist which her parents disagree with.  She ends up running away!  Wonderful interview.26 minutes with Duncan Lai talking about his windsurfing career and getting into the movies.  Nice to get all the info provided here since I have never heard of him before.Amazingly all of these interviews are English.  I guess it is just a coincidence that they all spoke the langauge.There is also a making of that is about 20 minutes long and is accompanied by some very good music.  This includes interviews and a look behind the scenes.  Steve Tung Wai and Xin Xin Xiong are the credited action directors but I only saw Lau Kar Leung in all of the behind the scenes featurettes and this making of special feature.  I guess it is just a given that Master Lau and Donnie Yen had a hand in the action.  In the commentary though, they actually do credit Lau with the biggest part of the action and planning everything.I wish the movie was good enough to give it a rating of at least a 4 but the DVD itself gets a 5 star rating for the amount of special features and the quality of it overall.",3,Dragon Dynasty's release of Seven Swords,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,5156,"['What', 'out', 'very',

The seven swords from Mountain Tian had their own distinctive personalities and they only fitted to the beholders.  I believe that Tsui Hark is to a certain extent influenced by Lord of the Rings trilogy where the so called baddies had those gothic-emo look (talking about mixing the old with the new).  Considering that this is a triple joint venture with various film studios, more budget is expended in giving it a more authentic look by filming it at the picturesque XinJiang.  There's also a subplot of love triangle between the main character (Donnie Yen) and the Korean female love interest.  Truthfully, the movie feels a tad slow with nonstop action sequence.  Perhaps, I expect Seven Swords to have more depth.

1019931,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B000ICLU7C,ribcage,"[1, 1]","Seven Swords has some fantastic swordplay, magnificent scenery, interesting drama, and maybe about 25 minutes more on its runtime than it should.Seven Swords is the saga of a village on the run from an army of bounty hunting mercenaries being protected by 7 master swordsmen( one of whom is indeed a woman). There is not much more to the story, but what it lacks in plot-points and character depth, it makes up for with excellent character drama and frenetic fight scenes.Being shot on some beautiful locations, Seven Swords picturesque majesty is enough to forgive the fact that its downright slow in places. A little over an hour in, I realized not all that much had happened at all so far, and the way things were going, not much more was likely to happen. It's not bolstered with a lot of action scenes either, so it treads the line towards being plodding, but thankfully never fully takes the plunge. As I said, the characters don't get a whole ton of depth, but their interactions are always engaging and believable so that you remain hooked.And it's made up for when we reach the finale, a climax that's so masterfully shot that I even forgot I ever thought the movie was anything but epic. Some people may be clamoring to this movie for some Donnie Yen action, and although he only serves a place in an ensemble rather than starring, that doesn't mean we are denied incredible action. It was thrilling, and redeemed a good deal of the slower parts of the movie.Overall, I would about give it 3 stars because it feels like it needs some fat trimmed off its 2 and a half hour runtime, but since I can't pinpoint any scene I could say I could do without, it receives four stars.Tsui Hark fans will be well pleased with the Blu-Ray as well.

1019932,A4FX5YCJA630V,B000ICLU7C,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","In the early 1600s, an imperial edict is passed throughout China: that the practice of Martial Arts is forbidden and that the punishment for those who do not comply is death. Military leaders are sent out across the countryside in order to silence any dissenters, gaining a considerable bounty for their troubles. One such leader is the brutal Firewind who sets his sights on an idyllic but isolated village where a great number of Martial Artists still live. Learning of this plan, the elderly Fu Qingzhu (a retired executioner and torturer who worked for the last dynasty) rushes to warn the village in the hopes of atoning for his past crimes.Once there he rescues young Yuanying from one of Firewind's men, and she decides to repay him by smuggling him out of the village after her people sentence him to death. Helped by her childhood friends Han and Fang, Yuanying follows Qingzhu's instructions in taking him to Mount Heaven to gain help from the master swordsmen who live there. The reclusive Shadow-Glow sends four of his best students to help the village, giving all of them specialized swords to fight with, and dubbing them the Seven Swords.Once this set-up is complete, it's pretty much pure action (with only a few quiet scenes) until the credits roll. Firewind's slightly odd-looking Goth-punk soldiers are a blood-thirsty bunch, and there is plenty of blood and gore to behold: decapitated heads, splattered blood, impaled bodies, twitching fingers, and so on. In response, the Seven Swords use their tactical skills in order to out-fight and out-maneuver Firewind's forces, leading the refugees from the village to a cave network in the hopes of hiding them from their enemies. On the way it becomes apparent that there is a traitor in their midst, and the climactic battle is split between the Seven Swords confrontation with Firewind and the villagers' attempt to defeat the traitor in the caves.""Seven Swords"" is very much a homage to Akira Kurosawa'sSeven Samurai, (as the title would suggest), and I was surprised to see so many lukewarm reviews considering it contained all the essential ingredients of a typical wuxia film: an extensive cast, beautiful cinematography, melodramatic love, elaborate fight scenes and an epic scale. There are a ton of characters to keep track of, not just the Seven Swords, but also a couple of love interests, a gang of villains, an array of villagers, and a bunch of children. For the most part it's fairly easy to delineate who's who given the archetypal nature of many characters, and there are a few standouts; particularly the Korean slave-girl Green Pearl who the Seven Swords rescue, who then becomes the first suspect of treachery given that she cannot speak the language in order to defend herself. Also nice was the use of the child characters throughout the film: they are not just cute, but helpful and brave as well.There are a couple of silly bits: love scenes involve a lot of heavy breathing and love-biting, and Firewind has an ""evil laugh"" that sounds exactly likeMuttley's wheezy giggle. Structurally the film is easily divided into three: the first act in which the characters and circumstances are introduced, the second in which both sides of the conflict begin to move against one another (the best part of the movie), and the final act that has the good guys split up into two groups. At this point the film loses some of its momentum, and it's rather ironic that the Seven Swords spend the entirety of this segment attempting to save one of their comrades (who stupidly wandered into Firewind's lair) instead of protecting the villagers (who are left to the mercy of the traitor).The actors fill their rather simplistic characterization with passion and energy, and are clearly pros when it comes to the elaborate fight-scenes. There is a wonderfully choreographed battle between Firewind and Cho in which both are hampered by the narrowness of the corridor they find themselves in, and thus are forced to brace themselves against the walls, allowing them to climb to a higher position and fight vertically rather than horizontally.As it was originally planned as the first of a hexalogy ""Seven Swords"" ends up feeling like a small piece of something larger. This on two counts: not just that there's plenty of room for a number of sequels, but that the original cut of the movie was originally four hours long. Given the rather patchy plot, I would have been quite happy to watch an extended version of the film in order to get a better understanding of the characters and their backstories - as it is, many may feel they got the worst of both worlds: an incredibly long film that *still* doesn't deliver on plot or characterization. For instance, there is a sequence in which Han must free the horses in order to create a false trail for Firewind to follow, leading to a tearful goodbye to his favourite horse called Luck Joy, who cannot understand why he's being abandoned. It's a beautifully shot and performed scene, and yet it comes out of nowhere. Having been given no background to the bond between the man and horse, the scene feels a bit hollow. The same could be said for all the relationships that exist within the film.Despite this, the DVD is packed full of special features. Not only a subtitled director's commentary, but also deleted scenes, interviews with the cast and crew, trailers, and photo galleries. For whatever it's worth, I enjoyed ""Seven Swords"", though it would have greatly benefited from a tighter storyline or perhaps a longer running time. Given the mixed reviews here on Amazon, perhaps it's safer to rent before buying, as I can see why this would be a divisive viewing experience.",4,"""The Seven Swords Will Live or Die
