1004205,A1ESUYMIG3TZT0,B000GH3CWK,Bobby  W.,"[0, 0]","If you are into crime dramas, ""Brotherhood"" is an easy series to commit to, because it is entertaining, well acted (for the most part), and has an ending (of sorts) after just three seasons.The series revolves around two brothers, one an aspiring and idealistic politician with what seems to be the perfect family life, and the other, a ruthless thug who resurfaces after a seven year absence. The brothers intentions are constantly at odds, and there's only room enough for one of them to stay ""on the Hill"".The show has some very fine ensemble episodes - for me, the first was an episode that concludes the first season and takes place entirely during a wedding reception. The second was an episode that involves Thanksgiving day. Both were excellent from start to finish. They tried the same formula less successfully with a ""Labor day"" episode.The problem I had with this show was aside from the main theme of the conflict between Tommy and Michael, there was a good deal of inconsistency in the series. Some plot threads would go nowhere or felt forced, and some character alliances would flip too many times to be believable. The flimsy continuity between the excellent ending episode of the first season and the first episode of the second season was hard to believe.The series has an ending, but I think a lot of fans were left hoping for more closure.All in all, if you like the first few episodes of ""Brotherhood"", then you should find the rest of the series worth watching, but it could have been a lot more.",3,"Verdict on the whole series - entertaining, but inconsistent",1345680000,"08 23, 2012",2012,1519,"['are', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Brotherhood', 'easy', 'series', 'commit', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'most', 'part', 'ending', 'sorts', 'just', 'three', 'seasons.The', 'series', 'two', 'brothers', 'one', 'aspiring', 'idealistic', 'politician', 'what', 'be', 'perfect', 'family', 'life', 'other', 'ruthless', 'thug', 'who', 'seven', 'year', 'absence', 'brothers', 'intentions', 'are', 'constantly', 'odds', 'only', 'room', 'enough', 'one', 'stay', 'Hill', '.The', 'show', 'very', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'episodes', 'first', 'was', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'place', 'entirely', 'wedding', 'reception', 'second', 'was', 'episode', 'Thanksgiving', 'day', 'were', 'excellent', 'start', 'finish', 'tried', 'same', 'formula', 'less', 'successfully', 'Labor', 'day', 'episode.The', 'problem', 'had', 'show', 'was', 'aside', 'main', 'theme', 'conflict', 'Tommy', 'Michael', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'inconsistency', 'series', 'plot', 'threads', 'would', 'go', 'nowhere', 'felt', 'forced', 'character', 'alliances', 'would', 'flip', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'be', 'believable', 'flimsy', 'continuity', 'excellent', 'ending', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'hard', 'believe.The', 'series', 'ending', 'think', 'lot', 'fans', 'were', 'left', 'hoping', 'more', 'closure.All', 'like', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Brotherhood', 'then', 'should', 'find', 'rest', 'series', 'worth', 'watching', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'more']",Brotherhood - The Complete First Season

1004231,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000GH3CWK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[91, 96]","Showtime has been trying for years to brand itself as the new HBO, producing programming that it hopes will match the critical and popular success of its rival network (with ""Sex and the City"", ""Sopranos"", ""Deadwood"", ""The Wire"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as a few examples).To me, most of the shows have fallen short.  I did think, however, ""Sleeper Cell"" was better than most people gave it credit for --and ""Weeds"" has developed into a tidy little comedy.  So check them out, too.""Brotherhood"", in my opinion, is their crowning achievement so far.  It is sophisticated, morally ambiguous entertainment.  The set-up is not unfamiliar--the classic cops versus criminals in a distinctly Irish neighborhood.  Good brother in politics versus bad brother in crime.  But how good is the good brother?  And how bad is the bad?  This show is very much about the choices we make and the complications and compromises that can arise.But it's even more about family, obligations and loyalty.  You will see this family for every flaw (and there are so many), but there is also much to be respected.  I don't like shows to spoon-feed me ideology and tell me what to think.  I like that ""Brotherhood"" doesn't pass judgment, it respects its characters and each viewer will likely react differently to their goings-on.Two particular stand-outs in the cast are Jason Isaacs and Annabeth Gish.  I've liked these performers for a while, but neither has achieved major stardom.  Isaacs is ostensibly the ""bad"" brother and he is, at once, chillingly cold and charming.  And Gish, as the politician's wife, is so lost and hopeless in many regards--but also, strangely, the voice of reason in many circumstances.""Brotherhood"" is complex, you do have to pay attention.  It's serious drama done for people who appreciate serious drama.  And I do!

Amazon has been asking for a review, so I'll say if you enjoy watching  the demise of a dreary working class neighborhood in the post-industrial economy where corrupt union bosses and their mob counterparts grapple for construction contracts, where politicians, despite their possibly initial good intentions, play dirty and become drunk with power, where intelligent men live by crime and violence instead of uplifting themselves, and succumb to the same even when they do because they can't let go of the criminal mentality they grew up with , then this show is for you.For a Chicagoan like myself, it was too reminiscent of the historical Bridgeport, a blue collar Irish neighborhood, which gave birth to the Chicago machine, the corrupt, ethnically based patronage system which produced five city mayors.

My husband and I watch a lot of TV and we have not sat and discussed a show this much for years.  It has a great cast (it is so great to see actors like Jason Isaacs - my favorite actor by far - and Annabeth Gish playing such meaty parts) and the writing is excellent, WAY above what is usually seen on TV and in most Hollywood movies these days.  I was hoping for good things when I first heard about this show and I was not disappointed in any way, except that it was over too soon!  I look forward to Season 2 and hope they can keep the quality going; too many shows jump the shark in their second season and it would be a shame to see that happen here.

1004244,A11UO96AKBCGSZ,B000GH3CWK,Mickey Ryan,"[1, 1]","Ultraviolent, profane and brutally terrific saga of an old Irish neighborhood in Providence on the brink of extinction in the modern world. Creator Blake Masters creates the ultimate hidden gem - a gritty saga of organized crime, loyalty, adultery and political corruption served up spiced with plenty of gangster violence,sex & drugs. Providence gangster Michael Caffee (Issacs) comes home to his old neighborhood in 'the Hill' section of the city after a 7-year absense (a common theme in Irish Mob stories, State of Grace and Southie come to mind). Immediately he reconnects with his close-knit family, past flames, and local hoodlums. Michael has his eyes set on retaking the Irish criminal rackets run by icy Freddie Cork (a masterful Chapman), as his politician brother Tommy Caffee (Clarke) tries to remain ambitious. Tommy's wife (a very easy-to-look-at and terrific Gish) experiences some demons of her own. Ethan Embry also gives a superb and hilarious performance as Declan Giggs, a RI State cop investigating his own childhood friends from the Hill.

1004246,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B000GH3CWK,Mr. Mambo,"[1, 1]","Many have labeled ""Brotherhood"" an Irish ""Sopranos"" and have likened the political aspects to ""The Wire"", and both are legitimate comparisons. In addition, some have criticized the premise of the series, that the idea of having yet another show about wiseguys, and one with the focus on a pair of brothers, one outside the law and one firmly ensconced within it, has been done to death. I'd say that just being mentioned in the same breath with legendary shows like The Sopranos and The Wire is reason enough to take notice of Brotherhood.I would also suggest that Brotherhood is not a ripoff of either series, but a brilliantly conceived and executed, fresh and original, contemporary morality tale. The reason I say that is that the writing, characters, situations, dialogue, art direction and photography are all top-notch, engaging, original and very credible. Even though the series tends to be dark and fairly violent, there are moments of supreme humor, which to me makes a series or movie so much more believable and entertaining. Besides unimaginative characters and writing, which leads to cliches, one of the foremost traits of a bad work of art is that it takes itself so seriously, leaving no room for humor. Also, thus far I have thankfully not glimpsed any scenes of a kindly, avuncular Irish parish priest, with a thick brogue, gently castigating any of the Caffees for their imperfect church attendance.There are a host of very professional actors at work here. The notable Brit actor Jason Isaacs does a wonderful job with the Eastern US accent, and is the personification of dangerous volatility, as black sheep Michael Caffee. Jason Clarke plays his younger politician brother Tommy, idealistic and ambitious but not above making backroom deals and even using extortion to get things done. Fionulla Flanagan is terrific and perfectly cast as their feisty mother, willing to look the other way at times, still working in a factory but looking to retirement.Annabeth Gish is Tommy's beautiful stay-at-home wife, mother of three girls, bored and addicted, having it off with the mailman. The short and stocky Kevin Chapman has cornered the market in nasty Irish thuggery [see Mystic River], but here he has moved up to the role of Freddy Cork, captain of his own crew. He is not at all pleased when the just-as-tough Michael turns up again after a 7-year absence.I was reminded of the real-life saga of the Bulger brothers of Boston, MA. James (""Whitey"") was the older gangster, and the younger William was the politician.As a visual artist I have a deep appreciation of the series' use of the beautiful overhead shots of the city as well as the wonderfully detailed interiors of the homes.All-in-all, a great series, highly recommended.",5,"Rough, Raw, & Gritty",1308528000,"06 20, 2011",2011,2754,"['Many', 'have', 'labeled', 'Brotherhood', 'Irish', 'Sopranos', 'have', 'likened', 'political', 'aspects', 'Wire', 'are', 'legitimate', 'comparisons', 'addition', 'have', 'criticized', 'premise', 'series', 'idea', 'having', 'yet', 'show', 'wiseguys', 'one', 'focus', 'pair', 'brothers', 'one', 'law', 'one', 'firmly', 'ensconced', 'been', 'done', 'death', ""'d"", 'say', 'just', 'being', 'mentioned', 'same', 'breath', 'legendary', 'shows', 'Sopranos', 'Wire', 'reason', 'enough', 'take', 'notice', 'Brotherhood.I', 'would', 'also', 'suggest', 'Brotherhood', 'not', 'ripoff', 'series', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'executed', 'fresh', 'original', 'contemporary', 'morality', 'tale', 'reason', 'say', 'writing', 'characters', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'art', 'direction', 'photography', 'are', 'top-notch', 'engaging', 'original', 'very', 'credible', 'Even', 'series', 'be', 'dark', 'fairly', 'violent', 'are', 'moments', 'supreme', 'humor', 'series', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'entertaining', 'unimaginative', 'characters', 'writing', 'cliches', 'one', 'foremost', 'traits', 'bad', 'work', 'art', 'so', 'seriously', 'leaving', 'room', 'humor', 'Also', 'thus', 'far', 'have', 'thankfully', 'not', 'glimpsed', 'scenes', 'kindly', 'avuncular', 'Irish', 'parish', 'priest', 'thick', 'brogue', 'gently', 'castigating', 'Caffees', 'imperfect', 'church', 'are', 'host', 'very', 'professional', 'actors', 'work', 'here', 'notable', 'Brit', 'actor', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Eastern', 'US', 'accent', 'personification', 'dangerous', 'volatility', 'black', 'sheep', 'Michael', 'Caffee', 'Jason', 'Clarke', 'younger', 'politician', 'brother', 'Tommy', 'idealistic', 'ambitious', 'not', 'making', 'backroom', 'deals', 'even', 'using', 'extortion', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'Fionulla', 'Flanagan', 'terrific', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'feisty', 'mother', 'willing', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'times', 'still', 'working', 'factory', 'looking', 'retirement.Annabeth', 'Gish', 'Tommy', 'beautiful', 'stay-at-home', 'wife', 'mother', 'three', 'girls', 'bored', 'addicted', 'having', 'off', 'mailman', 'short', 'stocky', 'Kevin', 'Chapman', 'cornered', 'market', 'nasty', 'Irish', 'thuggery', '[', 'see', 'Mystic', 'River', ']', 'here', 'moved', 'up', 'role', 'Freddy', 'Cork', 'captain', 'own', 'crew', 'not', 'pleased', 'when', 'just-as-tough', 'Michael', 'up', 'again', '7-year', 'absence.I', 'was', 'reminded', 'real-life', 'saga', 'Bulger', 'brothers', 'Boston', 'MA', 'James', 'Whitey', 'was', 'older', 'gangster', 'younger', 'William', 'was', 'politician.As', 'visual', 'artist', 'have', 'deep', 'appreciation', 'series', 'use', 'beautiful', 'overhead', 'shots', 'city', 'as', 'well', 'wonderfully', 'detailed', 'interiors', 'homes.All-in-all', 'great', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended']",Brotherhood - The Complete First Season

Maybe that's why some people are refering to Showtime as being a ""new HBO"" (although HBO isn't really HBO these days) with the list of new and original series' that have been very, very good.  You have the hilarious Weeds, the riveting Sleeper Cell, the horriffic and addictive Dexter, and the entertaining Masters of Horror to name a few, and you also have this political/gangster drama.  Brotherhood follows Irish-American politician Tommy Caffee (Jason Clarke), whose life gets thrown into upheaval when his long departed gangster brother Michael (the excellent Jason Isaacs) resurfaces.  As each battles for control over the Hill, we soon learn that there is really not much difference between the two brothers, and the line between good and bad becomes more and more blurred with each passing episode.  The supporting cast, including Fionnula Flanagan as the brother's controling mother and Annabeth Gish as Tommy's wife, are great, but it's veteran actor Jason Isaacs who is really the draw of the show, as he gives a masterful performance as one of the most subtley dangerous men to grace a series on Showtime.

After finishing S1 of Brotherhood, I can fully appreciate what it truly is, that being one of the strongest shows out today.Initially, it seemed a mish-mash of The Wire, The Sopranos, and a little dash of The Shield (and I'm not saying I don't love each of those series as well, but I wasnt feeling anything ""new""), but it has developed into its own powerful entity that is almost completely independent of anything else.This has turned into one of my favorite shows - the depth of acting and the complete lack of judgement about the actions of the players. Jason Isaacs is amazing, as the psychotic yet loyal gangster, and Kevin Chapman is pure, vicious evil as the mob boss Freddie.  Acting is Brotherhood's strong point, and it is refreshing to find a show so well put together, and a shame that we as viewers don't find this often, or demand that drama have this kind of character development.A truly 5-star show.",5,"A rare, ""off-your-radar"" series",1223251200,"10 6, 2008",2008,938,"['Wow', 'what', 'season', 'finishing', 'S1', 'Brotherhood', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'what', 'truly', 'being', 'one', 'strongest', 'out', 'today.Initially', 'seemed', 'mish-mash', 'Wire', 'Sopranos', 'little', 'dash', 'Shield', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'wasnt', 'feeling', 'anything', 'new', 'developed', 'own', 'powerful', 'entity', 'almost', 'completely', 'independent', 'anything', 'else.This', 'turned', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'depth', 'acting', 'complete', 'lack', 'judgement', 'actions', 'players', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'amazing', 'psychotic', 'yet', 'loyal', 'gangster', 'Kevin', 'Chapman', 'pure', 'vicious', 'evil', 'mob', 'boss', 'Freddie', 'Acting', 'Brotherhood', 'strong', 'point', 'refreshing', 'find', 'show', 'so', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'shame', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'often', 'demand', 'drama', 'have', 'kind', 'character', 'development.A', 'truly', '5-star', 'show']",Brotherhood - The Complete First Season

Brotherhood's ambitions are more in line with The Departed, as both take a more serious approach to the focus on Irish New England mobsters and explore questions about the invisible line between crime and government. It's no coincidence that the real life of law-breaking legend Whitey Bulger provided the genesis for both.While The Departed explores a fictionalized version of Bulger's relationship with law enforcement, Brotherhood semi-biographical tale focuses on a mobster and his wunderkind politician brother, mirroring the relationship Bulger had with his own brother who was the President of the Massachusetts State Senate.  Brotherhood's Caffees are shown to possess many of the same skills and standards, which allows them to rise to success in their different arenas.  While one uses his fists and weapons as a form of justice, the other wields a legislative pen and spending dollars to get people to bend to his wants.  Which one is the good brother?
