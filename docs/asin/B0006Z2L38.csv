875362,A1ART5LIGLOVZO,B0006Z2L38,"Chris ""Metal Reviewer""","[0, 0]","I am one huge south park buff, and have seen every episode of south park ever created. Matt and Trey are the greatest geniouses of comedy and should recieve a medal. The fifth season may not be my most favorite season (that title would go to the fourth), but to have all five seasons is too good to be true.Now, on to the box set itself, not much to say, you get every episode of south park up to the fifth season, a little bit of commentary for the first, second, and fifth season, and not much else. The price is pretty steep, but it is all worth it. I would highly recommend this box set to anybody that likes south park and also has a lot of money. Sorry this reveiw doesn't contain too much helpful information, but there are already a bunch of other reviewers who have taken the time to write thorough reviews, so I didn't bother to do that and instead I wanted to write a quick little review to express my love for South Park.",5,The First Five Seasons of the Worlds Greatest Cartoon!,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,933,"['am', 'one', 'huge', 'south', 'park', 'buff', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'south', 'park', 'ever', 'created', 'Matt', 'Trey', 'are', 'greatest', 'geniouses', 'comedy', 'should', 'recieve', 'medal', 'fifth', 'season', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'favorite', 'season', 'title', 'would', 'go', 'fourth', 'have', 'five', 'seasons', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true.Now', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'much', 'say', 'get', 'episode', 'south', 'park', 'up', 'fifth', 'season', 'little', 'bit', 'commentary', 'first', 'second', 'fifth', 'season', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'price', 'pretty', 'steep', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'box', 'set', 'anybody', 'south', 'park', 'also', 'lot', 'money', 'Sorry', 'reveiw', ""n't"", 'contain', 'too', 'much', 'helpful', 'information', 'are', 'already', 'bunch', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'write', 'thorough', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'do', 'instead', 'wanted', 'write', 'quick', 'little', 'review', 'express', 'love', 'South', 'Park']",South Park - The Complete First Five Seasons
875363,A3UYERNM2UQ30B,B0006Z2L38,"directions ""neuralbuddhist""","[2, 2]","How can I describe Mr. Hanky in polite language? A scatological figure maybe. In reality he is more of a post-modern take on Jiminy Cricket. If you watch the show he is the most sincere out of all of the characters. He always manages to wrap up the episodes he is on with a sincere and happy ending. Also, as is made clear in the first episode he is on, he is a suitable holiday figure for people who are non-denominational. Anyway, I seriously think the creators of South Park should create a Mr. Hanky spin-off series. Having to cope with an alcoholic wife and disabled son, I think Mr. Hanky could use the money.

875365,A457S8SW690NM,B0006Z2L38,hi,"[5, 71]","South Park is a show that everyone seems to love. I love Family Guy with its ""adult humor"" but I seriously found no humor in South Park. I tried to get into it, but all the jokes were lame, stupid, and the characters were annoying with their weird shapes and annoying voices. On top of it, the humor in this show is way over the top and seriously sacriligious. Jesus in a boxing match against the devil getting his but kicked? Come on! The passion of the Jew? This is trash and I'm ashamed that our country enjoys it.

875368,A1YCZVYGF4AVDL,B0006Z2L38,Steven J. Chappuis,"[49, 50]","Don't get me wrong, South Park is genius comedy. Sitcoms from the 50's through the 80's usually had a moral at the end of each ep. I dare you to find an episode of ""The OC"" or ""Dawson's Creek"" or ""Prison Break"" that has a healthy moral.SP has an intelligently articulated moral at the end of (almost) every single episode. When my kids turn 14, they will be forced to watch all the back episodes.In other matters:You can pay $155.99 for the 5 season DVD set.Or you can pay $128.89 and buy seasons 1 through 5 individually.Somebody at Amazon hasn't been doing their homework.Price this collection for $99.99 and you'll sell about a billion of them.Update: It's April 12th, 2006 (2 days after I made the above review) and the prices of the South Park DVD's has changed. Seasons 1 - 5 now go for $29.99 each; $149.95 for all 5. The 5 season collection is $155.99. What do I get for my extra 6 bucks? A fancier box?If you customer buys your product in volume, they usually get a discount, not an upcharge! Duh!Update: It's Tuesday April 18th. The total price for seasons 1-5 purchased individually on Amazon is $118.85.The box set is $145. It should be about $100 and I won't buy it until it is.",1,Great material.
