926967,A35MB3HSLQBXBG,B000AIQWDQ,David Freydkin,"[10, 11]","Erik Pontil is a bully at his high school. After severely beating up another student, he is expelled and sent to a private school, which is his last chance to get into a university. At home, he suffers from regular beatings by his step-father. When at the new school, he tries to lead a peaceful life but is, instead, tormented by the older students, who give him no chance but to fight back.What I really like about this movie is that it shows how bullying really is a fault of society. In real life, people say they disagree with bullying but really support the bully when the action occurs. In the movie, whenever underclassmen get victimized by the seniors, the public supports the bullies, and chears them on in the box.I think the real message of the movie is that the real law of our world is the survival of the fittest. Some are less fortunate and cannot defend themselves against bullies but others, like Erik, can fight for themselves. At the end, no one will fight for you. The only way to defeat bullying is to become stronger and fight off the bully. If you don't fight, you will be considered the villain as society will view you as weak and cowardly and look up to the bully.Human nature is weak and inherently evil.

926968,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AIQWDQ,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","EVIL (Ondskan) is a tough story from the novel by Jan Guillou that in screenwriter Hans Gunnarson's adaptation and Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m's direction becomes an intensely interesting while terrifying film about all aspects of evil.  It is intelligent, gritty, and transforming simultaneously and has become one of the more powerful coming of age films of this decade.Erik Ponti (Andreas Wilson) is a young high school lad, the son of a 'blind eye' mother and a viciously abusive father, who makes his way through school by fighting. After a particularly dangerous fight Erik is expelled and in order for him to matriculate into a university  he is sent to an academy where he encounters the controlling student leader Otto Silverhielm (Gustaf Skarsgrd) who quickly informs him that the discipline of the school is left in the hands of the students: the faculty elects to overlook the shenanigans of the students in favor of teaching in a self-imposed vacuum.  Erik is assigned a roommate Pierre Tanguy (Henrik Lundstr&ouml;m) who is Erik's opposite: Pierre reads and studies and advocates the non-violence of Gandhi  while Erik focuses on his athletic prowess in swimming and tries to submerge his pugilistic nature.  But as the school year progresses Erik discovers the extreme evil of the students who govern the student body by violent skirmishes and humiliation of the undergrads. Erik becomes a school champion swimmer, a feat that only draws the envy and hate of Otto and his henchmen and 'times in the ring' bring out Erik's fighting responses. He can take care of himself but when the violence turns toward Pierre, his only friend, he gathers the courage to confront the faculty with the student goon squad activities. Erik has broken a cardinal rule: he is attracted to Marja (Linda Zilliacus), the kitchen help, resulting in Marja's losing her job AND she is pregnant with Erik's child.  Erik is expelled, returns home to his supportive but copeless mother, has one final fight with his abusive father, and returns to his school to unmask the realities of student activities that shock the faculty.  How this change affects Erik and those that he respects and loves brings some surprises to the ending of this film.Andreas Wilson offers a multifaceted performance that reminds this viewer of the young James Dean.  He is able to make an essentially negative person into someone about whom we care very much.  Likewise, Henrik Lundstr&ouml;m molds his character with dignity, humor and honor and is the perfect foil for Wilson's transformation.  The cinematography by Peter Mokrosinski and the musical score by Francis Shaw add exactly the right atmosphere for this daring little drama.  Highly recommended.

At the boarding school, the upperclassman, the Sixth Form, are the evil students and Erik tries to change his ways. There is a lot of bullying throughout the film, including public humiliation and beatings. Evil is also based on a true story which I found interesting. Overall the movie is very entertaining and even educational; the bullying issues in the film are sadly still relevant today.Everyone receives different messages by watching these types of films; I received the message that you should always stick up for yourself, the system sometimes doesn't work, and Evil should always be destroyed.

Erik brings this rage to school where he severally physically assaults a student during recess.  The consequences of the assaults expel Erik from from school and his mom decides to send Erik to a reputable boarding school, Stj&auml;rnsberg.  Stj&auml;rnsberg is Erik's last chance to steer his life in the right direction as there is no other school that would accept him.  Once at Stj&auml;rnsberg Erik learns that the students are kept in line by the older students who exercise their malicious bullying as a tool to educate the younger students in proper manners.  This form of abuse is tolerated and accepted by Stj&auml;rnsberg's administration as it is the foundation upon which order is enforced in the school.  The defiant Erik finds himself in trouble as he does not know how to approach the evil mistreatment, which he resents, as he only knows the way of the fist.  Fortunately through the well-read Pierre, Erik's roommate and only true friend, Erik discovers the power of the mind, which he uses as he begins to confront the oppression from old traditions of Stj&auml;rnsberg.Evil is based on a autobiographical book written by the author Jan Guillou, who is also known for the literary adventures of Carl Hamilton, a special forces officer.  Jan Guillou is known in Sweden for his books and as an opinion maker as he approaches strong political issues in media and society.  Evil deals with some of these political issues as it displays some of the boarding school's ideologies, which stems from Nazism.  In essence, Evil is a strong political story that is told in the light of one teenager's tragic upbringing that deals with issues in a micro society, Stj&auml;rnsberg.  Hfstr&ouml;m's cinematic visualization of Guillou's book, Evil, offers a tremendous cinematic experience, which was nominated for Best Foreign Film in 2004.",4,Evil - The Autobiographical Horrors of a Boarding School...,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,1995,"['frequent', 'beatings', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'Erik', 'Ponti', 'Andreas', 'Wilson', 'home', 'seeps', 'out', 'rage', 'rebellious', 'attitude', 'Erik', 'rage', 'school', 'where', 'severally', 'physically', 'assaults', 'student', 'recess', 'consequences', 'assaults', 'expel', 'Erik', 'school', 'mom', 'send', 'Erik', 'reputable', 'boarding', 'school', 'Stj', 'auml', 'rnsberg', 'Stj', 'auml', 'rnsberg', 'Erik', 'last', 'chance', 'steer', 'life', 'right', 'direction', 'other', 'school', 'would', 'accept', 'Once', 'Stj', 'auml', 'Erik', 'students', 'are', 'kept', 'line', 'older', 'students', 'who', 'exercise', 'malicious', 'bullying', 'tool', 'educate', 'younger', 'students', 'proper', 'manners', 'form', 'abuse', 'tolerated', 'accepted', 'Stj', 'auml', 'rnsberg', 'administration', 'foundation', 'order', 'enforced', 'school', 'defiant', 'Erik', 'trouble', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'approach', 'evil', 'mistreatment', 'only', 'way', 'fist', 'Fortunately', 'well-read', 'Pierre', 'Erik', 'roommate', 'only', 'true', 'friend', 'Erik', 'power', 'mind', 'confront', 'oppression', 'old', 'traditions', 'Stj', 'auml', 'rnsberg.Evil', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'book', 'written', 'author', 'Jan', 'Guillou', 'who', 'also', 'known', 'literary', 'adventures', 'Carl', 'Hamilton', 'special', 'forces', 'officer', 'Jan', 'Guillou', 'known', 'Sweden', 'books', 'opinion', 'maker', 'strong', 'political', 'issues', 'media', 'society', 'Evil', 'deals', 'political', 'issues', 'boarding', 'school', 'ideologies', 'Nazism', 'essence', 'Evil', 'strong', 'political', 'story', 'told', 'light', 'one', 'teenager', 'tragic', 'upbringing', 'deals', 'issues', 'micro', 'society', 'Stj', 'auml', 'rnsberg', 'Hfstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'cinematic', 'visualization', 'Guillou', 'book', 'Evil', 'tremendous', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', '2004']",Ondskan [Region 2]
926973,A2P2JXU9JEYNV3,B000AIQWDQ,"Marian M. Matsunaga ""karma""","[5, 5]","""Evil"" is a very unique film, in that it is not just foreign, but because of that, it's subject matter is treated in a VERY different way than we are used to seeing, here in the U.S. It is first and foremost, a story of a troubled teen, who has very serious anger issues. Apart from that, however, is an underlying viciousness that young adults seem to harbor in a scholastic setting.We see Erik, a handsome boy, who seems to vent his pent-up rage upon other teenagers at his local school. After a conference with other school heads, Erik is expelled. It appears that Erik has no other recourse, but to ""drop-out"". This means a bleak existence for Erik, as in all other countries, a dropout has limited choices as to employment. It is here, that we are witness to Erik's homelife.His Mother is understandably concerned for Erik's future. She sells some of her prized possessions to raise the money to send Erik to a private school, so Erik still has a chance. Erik's Stepfather is not so accomodating. He seems to have a penchant for punishing Erik for even the most insignificant of ""transgressions"". It is here, as well, that we understand why Erik is the way he is. It seems that Erik is punished by belt just about every evening.Then comes the day Erik leaves for his new school. All appears well at first, as he is shown around the campus grounds by an upperclassman. He reluctantly settles into his dorm room and gets to know his ""bunkie"". Now comes the part that let's Erik know that he has been thrown into a wasp's nest. There are R-U-L-E-S he must follow, to get along (not much has changed, as it is remeniscent of his home life).Scholastically, Erik is a model student! He is bright, adept physically as well as mentally, and excells. The rules however, become a bane to Erik's existence. He must now do demeaning things that have no apparent purpose (much like ""hazing""), other than to push Erik into either confrontation, or compliance. Erik has a complete understanding of the difference between punishment and cruelty, and won't stand for any of it.It's not much of a stretch to say that Erik has now become the school whipping boy.One day Erik gets to know one of the school's serving girls (which is forbidden), and falls in love. It is difficult to maintain a relationship, because of their differing schedules, but Erik tries his best, as it is the only positive thing he can look forward to.Then the hammer falls. It is now open season on Erik! To his credit, Erik takes things in stride, as difficult as it is, because he knows that this school is his last chance, and he will not waste his Mother's money by being a failure. All bets are off, however, when an upperclassman finds out about Erik's Liaison with the serving girl, and reports it to the School Head.What happens next is surprisingly rewarding. I cannot go further, so as not to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it yet. ""Evil"" won many Film Festival awards, and it is easy to see why.

926976,A2JT1O6JIN3DOE,B000AIQWDQ,"RaabH ""Rob""","[35, 38]","In 1857 Thomas Hughes published ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"", which despite the unassuming title (or the sunny illustration on the current edition's front cover) is actually a bitter indictment of the brutality that Hughes saw as rampant in the 19th century British public school system. Jan Guillou's 1981 autobiographical novel, ""Ondskan"" -- of which ""Evil"" is the film version -- takes on mid-1900s Swedish boarding schools in a similar way. As with their British counterparts, at the Swedish schools it was the boys themselves who enforced the rules. The upper-classmen would act as harsh disciplinarians for the students in the lower forms, while teachers and administrators saw their duty to be only what their job descriptions entailed: teaching and administering.As a film version of Guillou's book, ""Evil"" is very accomplished indeed. The main character, Erik, is a bully who after regular beatings at home at the hand of his stepfather has come to take the same violent approach with his classmates. Due to constant fighting he is expelled from one high school after another, until finally it is left to his mother to sell off some of the family's prized possessions to pay for his tuition at an elite boarding school. This is the only school that will now accept him, and at a steep price. Knowing that the year at this school will be his last chance to graduate and move on to college, Erik is determined to get through it without another expulsion. At the same time he is also determined not to become victim to the traditional brutality that he soon discovers permeates the school. It is the tension between these two objectives that drives the story of ""Evil"".The upper-classmen at his new boarding school quickly realize what they've got in Erik, and in response they continually raise the stakes in their obsession over making him submit. What results are scenes combining cruelty, brutality, and downright disgust (one episode involving a late-night visit by the upper-classmen to Erik's room is definitely not for the squeamish.) We also at times feel keen frustration at having to watch Erik put up with the various mistreatments, especially knowing that if he did fight back he could easily subdue any of these upper-classmen.Lead actor Andreas Wilson's characterization of Erik is masterful, evoking the anger that drives him while also showing that as an individual he is far too complex to be dismissed as simply ""evil"". After the years of mistreatment by his stepfather (explaining not only the genesis of Erik's violent nature but his almost super-human ability to withstand pain), he has developed an unblinkingly tough facade, but as he begins to experience deep friendship and even romantic feelings for the first time, he gets in touch with his caring side as well. Erik is a boy of few words, giving Wilson relatively few lines of dialog and requiring him to evoke a great deal solely through facial expression and bodily aspect. Nonetheless, through Wilson we come to believe in Erik's gradual transformation -- his ultimate transcendance of his brutal homelife and the mistreatment at school. It is also worth noting that other characters are multi-dimensional as well. Not all of the teachers are blind and unfeeling to what is going on with the students, and Erik's worst tormenters show they are vulnerable in surprising ways. Even Erik's timid best friend/roommate proves to have an unexpectedly courageous side. A lesser film would not have strived for such nuance.The resolution of the story is very satisfying, in part because when Erik finally does fight again (both at school and at home) it is out of considered necessity and not violent impulse. And, when he comes to achieve his ultimate victory at the very end, it is through perseverance, insight, and cleverness rather than violence at all.The special features on the DVD include a featurette on the making of the movie, where we get to meet Guillou himself and learn more about how he came to write the original novel. We also hear from each of the featured actors and actresses and take in some behind-the-scenes production footage.I should note that the blurb on the DVD cover (""It's Fight Club in a boarding school"") is way off the mark.

It actually enabled me (and, I suspect, most viewers as well) to compromise my values and root for the ""better"" bully.  Was this, then, a message about ourselves?  Is it that we are fickle in whom we approve of.  Do we cheer some bullies while while condemning other?  Is life just a struggle to gain and maintain the upper hand?
