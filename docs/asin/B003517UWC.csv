It has a lot of heart and kept me smiling throughout. The performances are all good, especially that of Steve Hayes as ""God."" Brent Corrigan also shows up for a couple of minutes. Brent is my favorite porn star and one of my favorite celebrities in general.'Musical' is also very relatable. A lot of the gay men in the film are sluts, as many are in real life. However, the main characters are just looking for love and in the end they might find it. Also, the movie tackles some pretty deep issues, like AIDS and coming out to your parents.Finally, the best thing I can say about The Big Gay Musical is that there isn't anything bad I can say about it. It's not every day, or even every week, that I see a movie that I can give that kind of praise.

I do have to be honest and say that many of the actors kind of looked alike. They were all athletic looking guys with the dark hair. And this made it hard for me to differentiate who was who in some portions of the shows. In fact, the one guy (I forget his name) who wanted a relationship and just wanted to cuddle with guys he met, had his hair styled one way when he went to the steam room.

Not for homosexuality, because if you enjoy it you're going to hell with the rest of us."" - The Big Gay MusicalReview:I picked this movie because of the awesome title. It reminds me of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride. I will tell you, if it bothers you to see guys make out, or guys in sweet dance belts, you probably want to pass on this. And sexual innuendo, because there is obviously a bunch of that. And singing. And dancing. Well, it's a big gay musical, so I'm not sure what else you would expect. There is some great singing, though the voices do not match up with the lips, which provided be with quite a few laughs... Plus it's good to know that the bible was written by an angry redhead.I got the idea that prior to their acting careers, some of these guys may have strippers. Or porno stars, they sure do make out a lot. All I know is that during the first make out scene, all I could think was ""don't be porn, don't be porn"" as sometimes when I watch a movie before I read anything about it, I get surprised. Thankfully, it's not porn! Woot!  Though there was a bunch of emphasis on safe sex, always a nice message.My only complaint is that they tried so hard to bring touching, serious moments into the movie, and I wish they would have just kept it light and fluffy. Or a parody of High School Musical, like I originally thought it was.My Recommendation:Gay men and liberal women will like this show. There are tons of ripped abs and hot guys...

Percy,"[25, 31]","The Big Gay Musical.The BFI Theatre on the South Bank in London was packed on the afternoon I went to see The Big Gay Musical.As with all movies associated with Casper Andreas I expected it to be entertaining, witty, comical with just a hint of sadness attached to it.  I was not disappointed at all.  He had co-directed this along with Fred M. Caruso.  This joint venture proved they were a formidable duo.Casper had introduced the movie on other showings but had had to fly back to the US so Brian Robinson - the Press Officer at the BFI Theatre - stepped up on stage to do the honours.He told the packed house that The Big Gay Musical had been the favourite of the whole group of gay themed movies that had been shown at the festival over the past few days.The lights dimmed and the movie started.  Black and white to start with which gave it a 1930s feel and I just knew it was going to be an enjoyable ride from start to finish when Casper playing a small but important part asks columnist Michael Musto as he dashes out from an extremely bad show if there is anything he would like.  Screaming hysterically ""I need a big gay musical"" as he rushes on his way the screen bursts into colour and a most wonderful production number with handsome near naked men wearing angels' wings and boots tap dance across the screen .The theatre audience, clapped, laughed and cheered throughout the movie.Yes, it's campy, even a bit cheesy but its dramatic and it's filled to the brim with muscular bodies and show tunes that get your feet tapping along with them and  then when a very limp wristed God appears played to the hilt by Steve Hayes and he creates Adam and Steve to live in the Garden of Eden after chasing Adam and Eve out well.......The plot has been described in many reviews so it is suffice to say that it is a movie that one must see too appreciate to the full.  Words just do not do it justice.  The talent is outstanding and all can dance, sing and act.  A powerful combination.  Many are from the Broadway stage and to name just a few - Daniel Robinson was in Hairspray, Joey Dudding did Gypsy, La Cage Aux Folles and Chorus Line and others appeared in Tricks, Wicked and even South Pacific.Sheer entertainment from start to finish.",5,Wonderfully entertaining.,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,2243,"['Big', 'Gay', 'Musical.The', 'BFI', 'Theatre', 'South', 'Bank', 'London', 'was', 'packed', 'afternoon', 'went', 'see', 'Big', 'Gay', 'Musical.As', 'movies', 'associated', 'Casper', 'Andreas', 'expected', 'be', 'entertaining', 'witty', 'comical', 'just', 'hint', 'sadness', 'attached', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'had', 'co-directed', 'Fred', 'M.', 'Caruso', 'joint', 'venture', 'proved', 'were', 'formidable', 'duo.Casper', 'had', 'introduced', 'movie', 'other', 'showings', 'had', 'had', 'fly', 'back', 'US', 'Brian', 'Robinson', 'Press', 'Officer', 'BFI', 'Theatre', 'stepped', 'up', 'stage', 'do', 'honours.He', 'told', 'packed', 'house', 'Big', 'Gay', 'Musical', 'had', 'been', 'favourite', 'whole', 'group', 'gay', 'themed', 'movies', 'had', 'been', 'shown', 'festival', 'past', 'few', 'days.The', 'lights', 'dimmed', 'movie', 'started', 'Black', 'white', 'start', 'gave', '1930s', 'feel', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'start', 'finish', 'when', 'Casper', 'playing', 'small', 'important', 'part', 'columnist', 'Michael', 'Musto', 'out', 'extremely', 'bad', 'show', 'anything', 'would', 'like', 'Screaming', 'hysterically', 'need', 'big', 'gay', 'musical', 'way', 'screen', 'colour', 'most', 'wonderful', 'production', 'number', 'handsome', 'naked', 'men', 'wearing', 'angels', 'wings', 'boots', 'tap', 'dance', 'screen', '.The', 'theatre', 'audience', 'clapped', 'laughed', 'cheered', 'movie.Yes', 'campy', 'even', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'dramatic', 'filled', 'brim', 'muscular', 'bodies', 'show', 'tunes', 'get', 'feet', 'tapping', 'along', 'then', 'when', 'very', 'limp', 'wristed', 'God', 'played', 'hilt', 'Steve', 'Hayes', 'Adam', 'Steve', 'live', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'chasing', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'out', 'well', '.The', 'plot', 'been', 'described', 'many', 'reviews', 'suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'one', 'must', 'see', 'too', 'appreciate', 'full', 'Words', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'talent', 'outstanding', 'can', 'dance', 'sing', 'act', 'powerful', 'combination', 'Many', 'are', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'name', 'just', 'few', 'Daniel', 'Robinson', 'was', 'Hairspray', 'Joey', 'Dudding', 'did', 'Gypsy', 'La', 'Cage', 'Aux', 'Folles', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'others', 'appeared', 'Tricks', 'Wicked', 'even', 'South', 'Pacific.Sheer', 'entertainment', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

In the film, the main character's boyfriend suddenly disappears because someone lied and told him that his boyfriend is HIV positive. The main character has no enemies so who did it? We never find out. And the main character never sees his boyfriend ever again. Instead, he decides he will become a slut and have sex with random people. Wow. In the end, he finds love with a new guy who we never get to know.The movie revolves around a musical that sort of mocks Christians. That's not a way to get people to look at you with respect. The musical also depicts gay men as wing-wearing, skipping-prancing sissies. The one positive thing I can say about it is that some of them could actually sing pretty well.Over all, this is another gay movie with a weak script and only furthers stereotypes.",2,Another half assed gay movie,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,891,"['one', 'major', 'plot', 'hole', 'movie', 'One', 'whole', 'movie', 'completely', 'unresolved', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'boyfriend', 'suddenly', 'someone', 'lied', 'told', 'boyfriend', 'HIV', 'positive', 'main', 'character', 'enemies', 'so', 'who', 'did', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'boyfriend', 'ever', 'again', 'Instead', 'will', 'become', 'slut', 'have', 'sex', 'random', 'people', 'Wow', 'end', 'love', 'new', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'get', 'know.The', 'movie', 'revolves', 'musical', 'sort', 'mocks', 'Christians', 'not', 'way', 'get', 'people', 'look', 'respect', 'musical', 'also', 'gay', 'men', 'wing-wearing', 'skipping-prancing', 'sissies', 'one', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'could', 'actually', 'sing', 'pretty', 'well.Over', 'gay', 'movie', 'weak', 'script', 'only', 'furthers', 'stereotypes']",N/A

Since this piece is called ""a musical"" we (must) listen to songs which are used in the show.The problem here is that some of the plots appear out of blue and disappear without any explanation.
