154344,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792845781,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","F/X, 1996 filmThe symbol ""F/X"" stands for special effects in a movie production that is used to create ""reality"". A man with a machine gun enters a restaurant and shoots a lot of people. It is all part of a movie. A producer enters the set and talks to a technician about his work. The next day he returns to talk about the Witness Relocation Program and his need for a fake assassination in public. Will he agree? [Does this sound like a realistic proposal?] Tyler agrees. First they make a face mask. Later Tyler is asked to act as the assassin! [Suspicious?] The assassination takes place in a restaurant as planned. There is a surprise in the car! Rolly gets away from a predicament. He calls Mason for help. ""Stay there."" Another man wants to use the phone booth. A lucky break for Tyler!What if they put in real bullets? His girl explains what happened. What can he do now? The next morning there is a surprise! Then an unwelcome visitor arrives. The next day a Police Detective shows up and the investigation begins. The dead assassin used to work for the NYPD. Detective Leo McCarthy wants the case. Tyler sees a man following his friend, he solves this problem. Two detectives enter Tyler's apartment [no search warrant?]. ""If it only could talk."" McCarthy learns about the former cop. He goes to talk to Mason, but doesn't believe him. Tyler calls Mason, this call is traced. Lt. McCarthy asks about Mason, then goes to see Murdoch. Who will watch Tyler's trick? Tyler has a trick to distract watchers. A body in the street stops traffic. McCarthy is in big trouble for his interference. Tyler looks for Mason. Can two guards cover the whole house? Not when Tyler has a bag of tricks.De Franco is nervous and shoots a submachine gun. A shock affects his Pacemaker. Mason get his key, then sticks to a submachine gun for too long. Is there a last trick to surprise the audience? A trip to Berne to that safety deposit box provides a reward to the survivors. Was this meant as irony? Did you find its premise and story believable? I didn't. It does hold your interest, like other action movies. How did they quickly find a body double for De Franco? [Believable?]The plot reminds me of that controversy surrounding JFK. In the early 1990s the doctors who treated JFK at Parkland Hospital were allowed to see the confidential records (X-rays) of JFK. They said these records did not match what they remembered from thirty years earlier. There were books that suggested a body double was used for Bethesda records. Those who could kill a US President and get away with it had to power to substitute records. Gerald O'Toole's book ""The Assassination Tapes"" provided the objective evidence that refuted the Warren Report. It was followed by a House Select Committee that provided a newer report.",2,Special Effects is not a Good Story,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,2799,"['F/X', '1996', 'filmThe', 'symbol', 'F/X', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'production', 'used', 'create', 'reality', 'man', 'machine', 'gun', 'restaurant', 'shoots', 'lot', 'people', 'part', 'movie', 'producer', 'set', 'talks', 'technician', 'work', 'next', 'day', 'talk', 'Witness', 'Relocation', 'Program', 'need', 'fake', 'assassination', 'public', 'Will', 'agree', '[', 'sound', 'realistic', 'proposal', ']', 'Tyler', 'agrees', 'First', 'make', 'face', 'mask', 'Later', 'Tyler', 'asked', 'act', 'assassin', '[', 'Suspicious', 'assassination', 'place', 'restaurant', 'planned', 'surprise', 'car', 'Rolly', 'away', 'predicament', 'Mason', 'help', 'Stay', 'there', 'man', 'use', 'phone', 'booth', 'lucky', 'break', 'Tyler', 'What', 'put', 'real', 'bullets', 'girl', 'what', 'happened', 'What', 'can', 'do', 'now', 'next', 'morning', 'surprise', 'Then', 'unwelcome', 'visitor', 'arrives', 'next', 'day', 'Police', 'Detective', 'up', 'investigation', 'dead', 'assassin', 'used', 'work', 'NYPD', 'Detective', 'Leo', 'McCarthy', 'case', 'Tyler', 'man', 'following', 'friend', 'problem', 'Two', 'detectives', 'enter', 'Tyler', 'apartment', 'search', 'warrant', ']', 'only', 'could', 'talk', 'McCarthy', 'former', 'cop', 'talk', 'Mason', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tyler', 'Mason', 'call', 'traced', 'Lt.', 'McCarthy', 'Mason', 'then', 'see', 'Murdoch', 'Who', 'will', 'watch', 'Tyler', 'trick', 'Tyler', 'trick', 'distract', 'watchers', 'body', 'street', 'stops', 'traffic', 'McCarthy', 'big', 'trouble', 'interference', 'Tyler', 'Mason', 'Can', 'two', 'guards', 'cover', 'whole', 'house', 'Not', 'when', 'Tyler', 'bag', 'tricks.De', 'Franco', 'nervous', 'shoots', 'submachine', 'gun', 'shock', 'Pacemaker', 'Mason', 'get', 'key', 'then', 'submachine', 'gun', 'too', 'long', 'there', 'last', 'trick', 'surprise', 'audience', 'trip', 'Berne', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box', 'reward', 'survivors', 'Was', 'meant', 'irony', 'Did', 'find', 'premise', 'story', 'believable', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'How', 'did', 'quickly', 'find', 'body', 'double', 'De', 'Franco', '[', 'Believable', 'plot', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'JFK', 'early', '1990s', 'doctors', 'who', 'treated', 'JFK', 'Parkland', 'Hospital', 'were', 'allowed', 'see', 'confidential', 'records', 'X-rays', 'JFK', 'said', 'records', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'remembered', 'thirty', 'years', 'earlier', 'were', 'books', 'suggested', 'body', 'double', 'was', 'used', 'Bethesda', 'records', 'who', 'could', 'kill', 'US', 'President', 'get', 'away', 'had', 'power', 'substitute', 'records', 'Gerald', ""O'Toole"", 'book', 'Assassination', 'Tapes', 'provided', 'objective', 'evidence', 'refuted', 'Warren', 'Report', 'was', 'followed', 'House', 'Select', 'Committee', 'provided', 'newer', 'report']",N/A

Anyway we got to the Movie Channel (STAR Movies) and saw what looked like the opening credits, and then big blue words came across the screen reading &quot;F/X.&quot; So we watched it, saw if it was any good. Let me say we were pretty surprised! It was pretty obvious that it was shot on a low budget. That made me like it all the more! Becuase you usually get a famous rich director and writers to put together a good action/suspense movie. But those movies, sience the director has alot of money he just figures he'll blow the hell out of everything. It gets pretty annoying. But that is what I love about this movie. Sense they didn't have a lot of money they kept the movie good was the writing and directing. Dispite the name (F/X) it is not what the movie reliys on. It relies on a smart plot and even smarter plot twists. You never know who the villian is. Plus the well mantled suspense is a plus. I cant say the biggest part of the plot, but I can sya what it starts with. This aussie dude who makes special FX for movies (hense the name) is assigned to stage an assination on a gang member (but not really kill him, just make it look like he got killed with his special effect tricks.

It does seem a little low budget, however, they spent the money on cast, not effects. There are plenty of effects in this, to be sure. It is, after all, about a man who does special effects professionally, who is then hired by the DOJ to pretend to kill a witness to make him easier to protect. He pulls it off perfectly, and then finds himself wanted for murder. Did his stunt go wrong? Or is something else going on? On the run from the law, he has to uncover the truth, find out if he did actually kill the witness or not, and clear his name.It's a lot of fun, it showcases what some good special effects people can do on a limited budget and it does keep you guessing just what will happen next.The sequel is good, just not as good.As of this review, I am still waiting on the DVD to arrive so I can't comment on some of the other reviews complaining about the quality of the DVD.

154350,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0792845781,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","This is such a well-crafted suspense thriller that it's almost as much a pleasure to watch the third or fourth time as it is the first. Rollie Tyler (Bryan Brown) is a special effects man much in demand in Hollywood. He not only is a gifted professional in the trade, he's probably the main reason for the success of such exploitation films he's worked on as I Dismember Mama, Planet of the Female Mummies, Song of the Succubus and Rock-A-Die-Baby. Examples from these movies litter his apartment. He's recruited by Agent Lipton of the Justice Department's Witness Protection Program to stage the fake but public murder of a mafia boss, Nick DeFranco (Jerry Orbach), who will spill his guts to the Feds. All goes well until, after the event, Lipton (Cliff De Young), tries to shoot him down.Rollie finds himself a player in a murderous con game. He escapes, goes on the run, but sees his girl friend murdered. He doesn't know whether the DeFranco shooting was truly fake or if Lipton substituted real bullets in the gun. In the background, pulling strings, is Lipton's boss, Edward Mason (Mason Williams). While Rollie decides he has to find out what's going on if he's not to become another victim, a tough New York cop (Brian Dennehy) shows up determined to find the truth about DeFranco wherever it takes him.The action is fast and clever. The story is satisfyingly convoluted. And there are many lessons to be learned...how to make a life mask, how to set off a pattern of fake bullet explosions on your chest, how to hide your pulse so you'll look dead, how to put out a cigarette on your wrist. One of the things that makes this movie so satisfying are the actors. Bryan Brown turns in a fine job as Rollie, confident of his skills, laid back, resourceful, but really scared when people try to kill him. Mason Adams, a skilled actor with a distinctive, rough voice, and Jerry Orbach as the confident and slimy Mafia boss, both add a great deal of interest to the movie whenever they're on the screen. The movie has a funny, good-natured and violent opening scene as well as a clever and satisfying bank shot of an ending.There even is wisdom for us. As Rollie's movie actress girl friend says to him at the start of the film, ""Nobody cares about making movies about people anymore. All they care about is special effects."" And this in a film nearly twenty years old.There are no extras to speak of. The DVD picture looks just fine.",4,"An Amusing, Not-Too-Violent Suspense Thriller",1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,2437,"['such', 'well-crafted', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'first', 'Rollie', 'Tyler', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'special', 'effects', 'man', 'much', 'demand', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'only', 'gifted', 'professional', 'trade', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'success', 'such', 'exploitation', 'films', 'worked', 'Dismember', 'Mama', 'Planet', 'Female', 'Mummies', 'Song', 'Succubus', 'Rock-A-Die-Baby', 'Examples', 'movies', 'litter', 'apartment', 'recruited', 'Agent', 'Lipton', 'Justice', 'Department', 'Witness', 'Protection', 'Program', 'stage', 'fake', 'public', 'murder', 'mafia', 'boss', 'Nick', 'DeFranco', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'who', 'will', 'spill', 'guts', 'Feds', 'well', 'event', 'Lipton', 'Cliff', 'De', 'Young', 'shoot', 'down.Rollie', 'player', 'murderous', 'con', 'game', 'run', 'girl', 'friend', 'murdered', ""n't"", 'know', 'DeFranco', 'shooting', 'was', 'truly', 'fake', 'Lipton', 'substituted', 'real', 'bullets', 'gun', 'background', 'pulling', 'strings', 'Lipton', 'boss', 'Edward', 'Mason', 'Mason', 'Williams', 'Rollie', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'become', 'victim', 'tough', 'New', 'York', 'cop', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'up', 'determined', 'find', 'truth', 'DeFranco', 'wherever', 'him.The', 'action', 'fast', 'clever', 'story', 'satisfyingly', 'convoluted', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'how', 'make', 'life', 'mask', 'how', 'set', 'off', 'pattern', 'fake', 'bullet', 'explosions', 'chest', 'how', 'hide', 'pulse', 'so', ""'ll"", 'look', 'dead', 'how', 'put', 'out', 'cigarette', 'wrist', 'One', 'things', 'movie', 'so', 'satisfying', 'are', 'actors', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'fine', 'job', 'Rollie', 'confident', 'skills', 'laid', 'back', 'resourceful', 'really', 'scared', 'when', 'people', 'try', 'kill', 'Mason', 'Adams', 'skilled', 'actor', 'distinctive', 'rough', 'voice', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'confident', 'slimy', 'Mafia', 'boss', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'interest', 'movie', 'whenever', ""'re"", 'screen', 'movie', 'funny', 'good-natured', 'violent', 'opening', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'clever', 'satisfying', 'bank', 'shot', 'ending.There', 'even', 'wisdom', 'Rollie', 'movie', 'actress', 'girl', 'friend', 'start', 'film', 'Nobody', 'making', 'movies', 'people', 'anymore', 'care', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'old.There', 'are', 'extras', 'speak', 'DVD', 'picture', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

The hero is a good guy who is pulled by circumstances, his own failings, and malevolent forces into danger, and has to deal with this on his own. If you put Stetson hats on everyone it would be a cowboy movie.The performances by Brown and Dennehy (who is, despite much less screen time almost a co-star) are excellent, and most of the supporting cast quite good (the F/X assistant is quite weak, but not onscreen enough to really hurt).

154356,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,0792845781,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[8, 10]","F/X was one of my favorite thriller of the '80s, a genuinely fun action film that takes itself just seriously enough to make its story credible but at the same time remains blissfully free of the delusions of grandeur that have led to so many overproduced, ultimately empty headed and painfully dull ""thrillers"" over the past couple of years.  In short, F/X is the type of unpretentious, engaging film that could never be made by a Michael Bay or most of the other directors produced out of the Jerry Bruckhiemer School For Technocrats Who Like To Blow Things Up Real Good.The always underrated australian actor, Bryan Brown, plays Rollie -- an independent special effects artist who specializes in creating gore effects for cheap horror and action films.  Indeed, when we first meet him, he is working on a film that bares a hilarious resemblance to Brian DePalma's Scarface which, whatever its qualities, is most definitely represenative of the type of film that F/X strives not to become.  Brown is recruited by an uptight but reassuringly paternal federal agent (Mason Adams) to help fake the death of a mobster (Jerry Orbach) about to go into the federal witness protection program.  Once Brown agrees to help, he finds himself being targeted and pursued by mysterious killers who might be the government, might be the mob, or might be something else.The film's main selling point is that, in order to protect his own life and clear his name once the police become convinced that he's a murderer, Brown is forced to rely on his expertise in hollywood special effects.  While that certainly is true, it also makes the film sound a lot more gimmicky than it actually is.  As opposed to its sequel, F/X never allows itself to become reliant solely on that gimmick.  Instead, the film concentrates on presenting its fast-paced plot which, over the course of many twists and turns, avoids the common action film fate of collapsing on the wieght of its own complications.  That said, the F/X sequences are pretty cool and the film's conclusion provides perhaps the wittiest advertisement for superglue that I've ever seen.The film's main strength comes from the cast who all seem to be having a good time on screen and bring a surprising sense of conviction to roles that could easily have been played as B-movie stereotypes.  Bryan Brown is one of those charismatic, obviously talented leading men who rarely gives a bad performance yet for whatever reason (though making movies like Cocktail probably didn't help) has never become a bona fide star.  Playing the lead in this film, he proves that he did have the talent and the charisma to be a leading man and indeed, his low-key but likeable lead performance is reponsible for a great deal of F/X's strength.  As the gruff police detective who becomes Brown's ally, Brian Dennehey is -- well, he's Brian Dennehey and, as always, that's more than good enough.  That said, he also brings a welcome sense of humor to the proceedings and he proves once again that nobody in the '80s delivered profanity as wittily and skillfully as Brian Dennehey.  The rest of the cast is full of character actors who all turn in nicely quirky performances with the standouts being Diane Venora who is sweet as Brown's girlfreind (whose ultimate fate -- if predictable -- is also well handled and rather sad), Cliff De Young who gives perhaps his best variation on his standard Yuppie henchman role in this film, Joe Grifasi as Dennehey's put upon partner, Mason Adams who perfectly captures the essence of everyone's kindly but kinda strange uncle, and the great Jerry Orbach who, playing a mobster with an all-important pace maker, overacts as if the world depending on it but is still a lot of fun to watch because, afterall, he's Jerry Orbach.  They all come together to create (without any trendy angst or computerized special effects to show us what animated human beings look like when they get blown up) one of the most purely enjoyable movies of the '80s.",4,A lot of fun,1019520000,"04 23, 2002",2002,3996,"['F/X', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'thriller', ""'80s"", 'genuinely', 'fun', 'action', 'film', 'just', 'seriously', 'enough', 'make', 'story', 'credible', 'same', 'time', 'blissfully', 'free', 'delusions', 'grandeur', 'have', 'led', 'so', 'many', 'overproduced', 'ultimately', 'empty', 'headed', 'painfully', 'dull', 'thrillers', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'short', 'F/X', 'type', 'unpretentious', 'engaging', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'most', 'other', 'directors', 'produced', 'Jerry', 'Bruckhiemer', 'School', 'Technocrats', 'Who', 'Blow', 'Things', 'Up', 'Real', 'Good.The', 'always', 'underrated', 'australian', 'actor', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Rollie', 'independent', 'special', 'effects', 'artist', 'who', 'creating', 'gore', 'effects', 'cheap', 'horror', 'action', 'films', 'Indeed', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'working', 'film', 'hilarious', 'resemblance', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'Scarface', 'qualities', 'most', 'definitely', 'represenative', 'type', 'film', 'F/X', 'not', 'become', 'Brown', 'recruited', 'uptight', 'reassuringly', 'paternal', 'federal', 'agent', 'Mason', 'Adams', 'help', 'fake', 'death', 'mobster', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'go', 'federal', 'witness', 'protection', 'program', 'Once', 'Brown', 'help', 'being', 'targeted', 'pursued', 'mysterious', 'killers', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'government', 'might', 'be', 'mob', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'else.The', 'film', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'order', 'protect', 'own', 'life', 'clear', 'name', 'once', 'police', 'become', 'convinced', 'murderer', 'Brown', 'forced', 'rely', 'expertise', 'hollywood', 'special', 'effects', 'certainly', 'true', 'also', 'film', 'sound', 'lot', 'more', 'gimmicky', 'actually', 'opposed', 'sequel', 'F/X', 'never', 'become', 'reliant', 'solely', 'gimmick', 'Instead', 'film', 'concentrates', 'presenting', 'fast-paced', 'plot', 'course', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'common', 'action', 'film', 'fate', 'collapsing', 'wieght', 'own', 'complications', 'said', 'F/X', 'sequences', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'film', 'conclusion', 'perhaps', 'wittiest', 'advertisement', 'superglue', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.The', 'film', 'main', 'strength', 'cast', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'screen', 'bring', 'surprising', 'sense', 'conviction', 'roles', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'B-movie', 'stereotypes', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'one', 'charismatic', 'obviously', 'talented', 'leading', 'men', 'who', 'rarely', 'bad', 'performance', 'yet', 'reason', 'making', 'movies', 'Cocktail', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'never', 'become', 'bona', 'fide', 'star', 'Playing', 'lead', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'talent', 'charisma', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'indeed', 'low-key', 'likeable', 'lead', 'performance', 'reponsible', 'great', 'deal', 'F/X', 'strength', 'gruff', 'police', 'detective', 'who', 'Brown', 'ally', 'Brian', 'Dennehey', 'well', 'Brian', 'Dennehey', 'always', 'more', 'good', 'enough', 'said', 'also', 'welcome', 'sense', 'humor', 'proceedings', 'once', 'again', 'nobody', ""'80s"", 'delivered', 'profanity', 'wittily', 'skillfully', 'Brian', 'Dennehey', 'rest', 'cast', 'full', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'turn', 'nicely', 'quirky', 'performances', 'standouts', 'being', 'Diane', 'Venora', 'who', 'sweet', 'Brown', 'girlfreind', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'predictable', 'also', 'well', 'handled', 'rather', 'sad', 'Cliff', 'De', 'Young', 'who', 'perhaps', 'best', 'variation', 'standard', 'Yuppie', 'henchman', 'role', 'film', 'Joe', 'Grifasi', 'Dennehey', 'put', 'partner', 'Mason', 'Adams', 'who', 'perfectly', 'essence', 'everyone', 'kindly', 'kinda', 'strange', 'uncle', 'great', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'who', 'playing', 'mobster', 'all-important', 'pace', 'maker', 'world', 'depending', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'because', 'afterall', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'come', 'together', 'create', 'trendy', 'angst', 'computerized', 'special', 'effects', 'show', 'animated', 'human', 'beings', 'look', 'when', 'get', 'blown', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'purely', 'enjoyable', 'movies', ""'80s""]",N/A

There is also a difficult, embittered cop (Dennehy) out to get the mafia baddie after having spent much of his career chasing him.  Suddenly the f/x guy finds himself in way over his head, in danger of getting killed himself but unsure who, if anyone, he can trust.  What does he do?  He plots a revenge in just the way that throws everyone off by their assumptions, their perceptions, such as the sounds that he can emit in a house to make people think he isn't where he is or the mirror he sets up in a doorway.  Perfect illusions, but used in ways that nobody would be able to guess - unless they had time to think instead of immediately react.  And it is executed to perfection.This is a promising plot as the viewer cannot guess what he is really doing either, until after a spectacular coup that is also funny.  Now, this was in danger of seeming silly, particularly in that nothing goes wrong but goes according to plan, so the producers got absolutely first rate actors to get the viewer to believe them, and for the time I watched the film, believe them I did, especially with the anger that both the f/x impresario and the cop feel.  And in the end only the cop figures out how the f/x guy is operating, adding a wonderful twist.  It is truly masterful suspense and the pace and surprises come so fast that you don't have time to doubt them.  It is great movie-making, like a film noire, to be enjoyed and not picked apart too much.Seeing this for the second time, it worked admirably well.  While I can see where some would want to analyze it for realism, I would counsel just enjoying it for the ride - we all know that rollercoasters are safe, but love the illusion they are not.
