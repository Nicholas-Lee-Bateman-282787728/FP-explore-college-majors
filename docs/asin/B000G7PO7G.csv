(and I have a fairly big variety/ collection) This is not one of those dvd's that you'll watch once or twice, place with your collection, and then again listen to it once in while thereafter  - no you'll pop it out quiet regularly and enjoy it again as for the first time.Fats and his producers knew exactly what was expected from them to bring the real domino on stage and to your screen. In his time and genre,  he must have been a `liberace' and `pavirotto' in his own. He has a strong and clear voice and shows no effort whatsoever to produce pure tones. Most of all, he enjoys in what he is doing and does it with total commitment - no gimmicks or pretensions. No wonder that groups and singers such as `the beatles', `elvis presley' and others had so much admiration for fats.  It won't come as a surprise if fats wasn't , directly or indirectly, a mentor to many of his contemporaries and later groups/singers. This man is a natural and talented master musician.Of course his most popular song must be the all famous `blueberry hill' but even songs that I did not  listen to regularly before on cd, are now more popular to me since viewing this dvd. He gives `blue monday' rather a `i'm a ready for the whole week,' colour. Most of his favourite hits are compiled on this dvd, but it would have been a personal bonus to me, had they recorded domino's version of `red sails in the sunset' as well.How fortunate and privileged are those who could have been part of the audience for this show.Wouldn't it be great if domino and sledge could have compiled a combo dvd of the same quality with their long time hits, to show the world what true music is all about ?Not repeating the title listing seeing it is already in some of the other reviews.This dvd has an appropriate dts sound distribution and is `loud' and clear. The dts sound fills the room.  Footage of each title track is to the full without any unnecessary interruptions, and the picture quality is good.If words such as nostalgia, enjoyment, quality, anthology, appreciation, treasure and commitment are part of your music vocabulary, then this is a definite buy for you.A collector's and non-collector's dream.Thxandr&eacute;",5,andre,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2241,"['When', 'last', 'did', 'enjoy', 'music', 'dvd', 'one', 'have', 'fairly', 'big', 'variety/', 'collection', 'not', 'one', 'dvd', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'once', 'twice', 'place', 'collection', 'then', 'again', 'listen', 'once', 'thereafter', ""'ll"", 'pop', 'out', 'quiet', 'regularly', 'enjoy', 'again', 'first', 'time.Fats', 'producers', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'bring', 'real', 'domino', 'stage', 'screen', 'time', 'genre', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'liberace', 'pavirotto', 'own', 'strong', 'clear', 'voice', 'effort', 'whatsoever', 'produce', 'pure', 'tones', 'Most', 'what', 'doing', 'total', 'commitment', 'gimmicks', 'pretensions', 'wonder', 'groups', 'singers', 'such', 'beatles', 'elvis', 'presley', 'others', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'admiration', 'fats', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'fats', 'was', ""n't"", 'directly', 'indirectly', 'mentor', 'many', 'contemporaries', 'later', 'groups/singers', 'man', 'natural', 'talented', 'master', 'musician.Of', 'course', 'most', 'popular', 'song', 'must', 'be', 'famous', 'blueberry', 'hill', 'even', 'songs', 'did', 'not', 'listen', 'regularly', 'before', 'cd', 'are', 'now', 'more', 'popular', 'viewing', 'dvd', 'blue', 'monday', 'rather', 'i', ""'m"", 'ready', 'whole', 'week', 'colour', 'Most', 'favourite', 'hits', 'are', 'compiled', 'dvd', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'personal', 'bonus', 'had', 'recorded', 'domino', 'version', 'red', 'sails', 'sunset', 'well.How', 'fortunate', 'privileged', 'are', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'audience', 'show.Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'domino', 'sledge', 'could', 'have', 'compiled', 'combo', 'dvd', 'same', 'quality', 'long', 'time', 'hits', 'show', 'world', 'what', 'true', 'music', 'Not', 'repeating', 'title', 'listing', 'seeing', 'already', 'other', 'reviews.This', 'dvd', 'appropriate', 'dts', 'sound', 'distribution', 'loud', 'clear', 'dts', 'sound', 'room', 'Footage', 'title', 'track', 'full', 'unnecessary', 'interruptions', 'picture', 'quality', 'good.If', 'words', 'such', 'nostalgia', 'enjoyment', 'quality', 'anthology', 'appreciation', 'treasure', 'commitment', 'are', 'part', 'music', 'vocabulary', 'then', 'definite', 'buy', 'you.A', 'collector', 'non-collector', 'dream.Thxandr', 'eacute']",N/A

It consists of 17 great songs, performed with a 14 piece New Orleans band, including Dave Bartholomew. Most of the songs performed in this concert, were written by the legendary song-writing team of ""Fats"" Domino & Dave Bartholomew. The band consists of 2 guitar players, 1 bass player, 2 drummers, 5 saxophone players, 2 trumpet players (including Dave Bartholomew), and 2 piano players - featuring ""Fats"" Domino on the lead piano and on vocals.This was filmed/recorded on October 22, 1986 on the Austin City Limits TV show.Some of the highlights include: ""I'm Walkin'"", ""My Girl Josephine"", ""Walking to New Orleans"" (This one's a classic), ""Shake, Rattle & Roll"", ""Ain't That a Shame"" (Another classic), ""I Hear You Knocking"", ""Blueberry Hill"" (Another classic - and ""Fats"" dedicates the song to the late/great Elvis Presley), ""Your Cheatin' Heart"" (A Hank Williams classic, well performed by ""Fats"" & his band), and ""Three Nights a Week"".This is a great concert dvd by ""Fats"" & his band, and I highly recommend it.

Fats is such a joy to watch & to listen to. The very first record that I owned was Blueberry Hill which my mother bought for me (she asked the clerk about what record that the teenagers were buying) & I have been a Fats Domino fan ever since. He did come to my hometown twice, back in the 50's & in the 80's, but I wasn't able to see him either time, so this DVD helps to fill in the gap for me. I just bet that some of the English teachers would scream at the way Fats would sing as his words are not always properly spoken/sung, but, hey, this is the Fat Man & what you see is what you get.  I understand that his wife has passed away & with the shock of that hurricane, his life must be so empty now. He is truly a great gift to the music industry & a great family man. Do yourself a big favor & get this DVD, put on your dancing shoes & have a great time. Thanks Austin City Limits for putting this show on DVD.
