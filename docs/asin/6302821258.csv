339229,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302821258,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 11/12Rate: 511/12: What was shaping up to be a weak `7' picture, The Temp did a nice job of losing a couple of points in the last fifteen minutes. What was that all about? Did the makers run out of money or fall behind the schedule so they hastily finished the film like that? Whatever the case was, they sure killed the movie. One minute, we were in the office. The next thing I know, we were on the typical Californian highway along the precipice where the car just suddenly had no brakes. Finally, a couple of minutes later, we are in the middle of the steamy factory as if we were about to watch a revival of fight between Sylvester Stallone and Brian Thompson during Cobra. Afterwards, the temp got fired just like that. What happened? It's like we were missing a couple of scenes in between each logic leap. I thought Timothy Hutton did very well, and I envied him for his hair look. My goodness, was he so much of a p*ssy from getting hurt by a simple paper cut? Steven Weber, a really funny guy and a well-known player from Wings, showed his acting chops and proved that he belongs in movies. I thought he should've had one more scene left in him after the alley episode. Oliver Platt is a very reliable supporting actor, but his part turned out to be abrupt and almost meaningless. Finally, Lara Flynn Boyle...she was never a looker, and I never considered her to be attractive. So, I had a hard time believing her for the part. Too many different hairdos for her throughout the film. And today, she is hideous as heck, thanks to her multitude of plastic surgeries. Anyway, what was surprising about the film was that nothing sexually had occurred between her and her boss. The murder thing, although it was obvious that she did it, was very implausible for me to believe. There was no way that she was capable of hanging Roger. And there was absolutely no way that some temp will rise to the executive position of marketing based on one faddish idea. The companies really do resume checks and ask for official college transcripts, so this was an idea stolen from Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead. All in all, if I had to choose, Disclosure is easily the better film of the two.",3,"The Paper Cut Was That Nasty, Eh?",1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,2199,"['Viewed', '11/12Rate', '511/12', 'What', 'was', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'weak', '7', 'picture', 'Temp', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'losing', 'couple', 'points', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'What', 'was', 'Did', 'makers', 'run', 'money', 'fall', 'schedule', 'hastily', 'finished', 'film', 'case', 'was', 'sure', 'killed', 'movie', 'One', 'minute', 'were', 'office', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'were', 'typical', 'Californian', 'highway', 'precipice', 'where', 'car', 'just', 'suddenly', 'had', 'brakes', 'Finally', 'couple', 'minutes', 'later', 'are', 'middle', 'steamy', 'factory', 'were', 'about', 'watch', 'revival', 'fight', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Brian', 'Thompson', 'Cobra', 'Afterwards', 'temp', 'got', 'fired', 'just', 'What', 'happened', 'were', 'missing', 'couple', 'scenes', 'logic', 'leap', 'thought', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'envied', 'hair', 'look', 'My', 'goodness', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'p*ssy', 'getting', 'hurt', 'simple', 'paper', 'cut', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'really', 'funny', 'guy', 'well-known', 'player', 'Wings', 'showed', 'acting', 'chops', 'proved', 'movies', 'thought', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'one', 'more', 'scene', 'left', 'alley', 'episode', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'very', 'reliable', 'supporting', 'actor', 'part', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'abrupt', 'almost', 'meaningless', 'Finally', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'was', 'never', 'looker', 'never', 'considered', 'be', 'attractive', 'So', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'part', 'Too', 'many', 'different', 'hairdos', 'film', 'today', 'hideous', 'heck', 'thanks', 'multitude', 'plastic', 'surgeries', 'Anyway', 'what', 'was', 'surprising', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'sexually', 'had', 'occurred', 'boss', 'murder', 'thing', 'was', 'obvious', 'did', 'was', 'very', 'implausible', 'believe', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'capable', 'hanging', 'Roger', 'was', 'absolutely', 'way', 'temp', 'will', 'rise', 'executive', 'position', 'marketing', 'based', 'one', 'faddish', 'idea', 'companies', 'really', 'do', 'resume', 'checks', 'ask', 'official', 'college', 'transcripts', 'was', 'idea', 'stolen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'Mom', 'Babysitter', 'Dead', 'had', 'choose', 'Disclosure', 'easily', 'better', 'film', 'two']",The Temp VHS
339230,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6302821258,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 1]","""The Temp"" rips away the thin veneer of civility and exposes the dog-eat-dog world of a cookie company. ""The Temp"" was all right for a momentary diversion, but I wouldn't offer it a full-time permanent position with benefits. I would blame the director, but I heard that he was forced to change the ending by one of the actors so she wouldn't look bad.Faye Dunaway played the big boss. She is very good at acting bossy, perhaps too good, if she forced the director to change the ending. No wonder there were so many loose ends never tied up.Here is an example of the sloppy plot: Lance, a secretary, gets his hand caught in a paper shredder. Later, he is back as the secretary for another employee, but his hand is fine. Did I miss something? I won't give away the ending, but there are many inconsistencies never explained.Lara Flynn Boyle as Kris Bolin, the temp, was efficient, attractive, and you really believed that she would do anything to get ahead. She does that kind of character very well. She seems in control, but she is just one cookie short of a Happy Meal, and could go totally psycho at any moment.Timothy Hutton was Peter Derns, Kris Bolin's boss, and he seemed like he might almost be too nice for the cutthroat business world he was in. He was supposed to have a dark side, as he was in therapy and his therapist warned him about keeping his Mr. Hyde in check. I kept waiting for that side to come out, but it seemed like no matter what was happening, he was always lukewarm.Oliver Platt and Steven Weber were also under utilized. Bottom line is ""The Temp"" was a cookie cutter thriller that only kept you entertained temporarily, but when the cookie crumbled, the pieces didn't fit together.Cougar Club(2007) Faye Dunaway was Edith BirnbaumKinsey(2004) Timothy Hutton was Paul Gebhard; and Oliver Platt was Herman WellsBeautiful Girls(1996) Timothy Hutton was Willie ConwayLeaving Las Vegas(1995) Steven Weber was Marc NussbaumThreesome(1994) Lara Flynn Boyle was AlexWayne's World(1992) Lara Flynn Boyle was StacyPostcards from the Edge(1990) Oliver Platt was Neil BleeneBarfly(1987) Faye Dunaway was Wanda WilcoxChinatown(1974) Faye Dunaway was Evelyn MulwrayBonnie and Clyde(1967) Faye Dunaway was Bonnie Parker------------------------------------Peter Derns: Where'd she get the picture?Rosemary: It came with the frame.

I thought I was alone in being entertained by this. External reviews often completely trash this movie without finding anything positive.Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings.""  How's that for voltage? Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that. How could you possibly lose?Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight. The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it. However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.  And it does. So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level. I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.It actually has a lot of good stuff in it. For example:One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later. For example:""You're BLOWIN' it man.""""YOU'VE GOT THIS PROBLEM.""And one of the greatest lines ever:""Good gosh how hard can it be? I'm not asking you to splice DNA you just DO IT!""Wonderful stuff.Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.",3,Gosh...I thought I was the only person that liked this movie,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,2419,"['****', 'REVIEW', 'INCLUDES', 'GREAT', 'DIALOG', 'SPOILERS', '****Wow', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'positive', 'reviews', 'movie', 'here', 'Amazon', 'thought', 'was', 'alone', 'being', 'entertained', 'External', 'reviews', 'often', 'completely', 'trash', 'movie', 'finding', 'anything', 'positive.Well', 'get', 'chemical', 'makeup', 'Stunning', 'popular', 'star', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'overtly', 'titillating', 'wearing', 'skimpy', 'outfits', 'even', 'including', 'bikini', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'habitual', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'younger', 'thinner', 'days', 'superstar', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Steven', 'Webber', 'TV', 'show', 'Wings', 'How', 'voltage', 'Add', 'proven', 'plotline', 'long', 'pedigree', 'Hand', 'cradle', 'Single', 'White', 'Female', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'whacky', 'dialog', 'top', 'off', 'inspired', 'idea', 'corporate', 'thriller', 'set', 'cookie', 'company', 'climax', 'industrial', 'kitchen', 'yeah', ""'ll"", 'bank', 'How', 'could', 'possibly', 'lose', 'Actually', 'really', 'movie', 'even', 'just', 'watching', 'straight', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'really', 'bad', 'hammy', 'mugging', 'acting', 'end', 'Boyle', 'up', 'same', 'style', 'other', 'like', 'However', 'make', 'ok', 'riddled', 'plot', 'holes', 'dropped', 'threads', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'implausabilities', 'etc', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'So', 'mind', 'could', 'look', 'one', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'genre', 'succeed', 'level', 'agree', 'others', 'ending', 'tho', 'was', 'written', 'spot', 'when', 'someone', 'lost', 'rest', 'script.It', 'actually', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'example', 'One', 'favorite', 'literary', 'devices', 'buddy', 'thing', 'entertainment', 'staple', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Skipper', 'Gilligan', 'Kip', 'friend', 'Bosom', 'Buddies', 'Balky', 'Larry', 'Perfect', 'Strangers', 'etc', 'movie', 'four', 'directions', 'Hutton', 'boss', 'Hutton', 'buddy', 'Webber', 'Hutton', 'rival', 'Platt', 'Hutton', 'Boyle', 'Lots', 'fun', 'there.The', 'highlight', 'whacky', 'dialog', ""'m"", 'still', 'quoting', 'years', 'later', 'example', ""'re"", 'BLOWIN', 'man', 'YOU', ""'VE"", 'GOT', 'THIS', 'PROBLEM', 'one', 'greatest', 'lines', 'ever', 'Good', 'gosh', 'how', 'hard', 'can', 'be', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'splice', 'DNA', 'just', 'DO', 'IT', 'Wonderful', 'stuff.Finally', 'surprise', 'Hutton', 'Platt', 'turn', 'performances', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",The Temp VHS

Lara  plays a convincing deadly Diva, along the same lines as some of the greats  like Kathy Bates in Misery, Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction, and Sharon  Stone in Basic Instinct.  This film is worth checking out if you like  strong woman characters with a tinge of evil running through their blood.",4,More than just a Temporary thing,932774400,"07 24, 1999",1999,663,"['breakout', 'performance', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'role', 'shreds', 'psychotic', 'ploying', 'nutcase', 'office', 'temp', 'systematically', 'destroy', 'co-worker', 'b', '%', 'amp', 'across', 'web', 'lust', 'greed', 'viewer', 'helplessly', 'lie', 'back', 'watch', 'catch', 'next', 'victim', 'devouring', 'apologies', 'regrets', 'Lara', 'convincing', 'deadly', 'Diva', 'same', 'lines', 'greats', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Misery', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'film', 'checking', 'out', 'like', 'strong', 'woman', 'characters', 'tinge', 'evil', 'running', 'blood']",The Temp VHS
