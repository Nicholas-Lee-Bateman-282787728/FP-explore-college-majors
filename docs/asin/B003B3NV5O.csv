It's available for streaming video on Netflix, which is where I saw it. Rex Harrison is fantastic. Maggie Smith is a joy as always. I think this might be her first film role. Capucine is lovely and a commanding presence. Wish there were more movies like this one. Easily bares repeat viewing, if only for the joy of the English language Smith and Harrison provide in beautiful tones.",5,Ought to be a Classic,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,498,"['one', 'really', 'ought', 'be', 'classic', 'instead', 'forgotten', 'film', 'getting', 'inferior', 'print-on-demand', 'treatment', 'available', 'streaming', 'video', 'Netflix', 'where', 'saw', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'fantastic', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'joy', 'always', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'first', 'film', 'role', 'Capucine', 'lovely', 'commanding', 'presence', 'Wish', 'were', 'more', 'movies', 'one', 'Easily', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'only', 'joy', 'English', 'language', 'Smith', 'Harrison', 'provide', 'beautiful', 'tones']",N/A

Rex Harrison is excellent as Cecil Fox a reputed millionaire who lives in Venice. After attending a performance of Volpone Harrison decides to have some mischievous fun with three of his ex-mistresses. Pretending that he is dying he gets the three of them (Edie Adams, Capucine, and Susan Hayward) to come to Venice to see how they each react. Do they want to be near him or his money? The plot gets complicated as Harrison plays each one against the other two and an elaborate murder plot develops. It's a very interesting and amusing film.

The famous ""dream sequence"" between Susan and Rex has never been restored.Susan was given lead female billing but is bumped off in the first 45 minutes of the film, but the witty script allows her to outshine the other gals with her sharp, retorts.

Mankiewicz in 1967 based on a play by the author of Alfred Hichkock's Dial M for Murder Frederick Knott.  A rich man, expertly played by Rex Harrison invites three old girlfriends to hear his will.  The three, a European Princess, elegantly played by Capucine, a Hollywood actress, played by Edie Adams with cool vivacity and another played by Susan Hayward he was involved with years ago in the Southwest and she is definitely ready to eliminate the competition.  She is waited on by nurse, perfectly played by a lofty Maggie Smith.  The host is assisted by an actor he hires wonderfully played by Cliff Robertson.  Adolfo Celi rounds at the sensational cast and fortunately there is no overacting to ruin this perfect material.
