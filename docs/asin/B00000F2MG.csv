It's just The Day-To-Day Life In Prison, which soon gets rather boring and one begins to wonder what the point of the movie is. The ending doesn't really match with the rest of the movie - it's like watching two movies in one.  Overall, there's not much kung fu action to be had in this movie. There's nearly more gun shootings than necessary and fist-fighting scenes. The dubbing is also the worst I have ever heard.  No attempt has been made whatsoever to match the spoken words with the lip action. Sometimes, I wasn't even sure if it was the character speaking, since the mouth was closed most of the time and the tone of voice did not match the character's demeanor.If you need a movie to put you to sleep, this one will do the job.",1,"Jackie Chan is the Prisoner, Indeed",1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,885,"['was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'action', 'centered', 'plot', 'least', 'plot', 'plot', 'movie', 'just', 'Day-To-Day', 'Life', 'Prison', 'soon', 'rather', 'boring', 'one', 'wonder', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'ending', ""n't"", 'really', 'match', 'rest', 'movie', 'watching', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'Overall', 'not', 'much', 'kung', 'fu', 'action', 'be', 'had', 'movie', 'nearly', 'more', 'gun', 'shootings', 'necessary', 'fist-fighting', 'scenes', 'dubbing', 'also', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'attempt', 'been', 'made', 'whatsoever', 'match', 'spoken', 'words', 'lip', 'action', 'Sometimes', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'was', 'character', 'speaking', 'mouth', 'was', 'closed', 'most', 'time', 'tone', 'voice', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'character', 'demeanor.If', 'need', 'movie', 'put', 'sleep', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'job']",N/A

The real fans of this movie will be those who love seeing the really sick people of society get beaten down and/or shot a few times.  I really hated the villains in this movie, and watching them get hit and thrown around was something that excited me quite a bit.  However, tragically, the comedy interlaced with the action isn't at all present, and all the stars who fight, are never shown fighting together (unless you consider the end a fight scene).All characters are well driven, as they each have a particular background story and attitude.  All the characters are decently well acted, too.  The fighting is feirce, but quite energetic, and some parts of this movie are very powerful (like the surprise ending).  There are several reasons I liked this movie.However, those don't quite add up for me to give this movie a high score.  I will probably buy it someday, but it's not among my &quot;Need to get Jackie Chan movies&quot; list.  I also complain about how I couldn't shut off the captions!  I was happy that some lines that were unclear were spelled out for me to read.  However, those captions still ruined the movie a tad, like at the begginning, the main character says &quot;Hey, who's visiting your father?&quot;  Then, Caption: &quot;Gunshot.&quot;  Audio: &quot;Boom!&quot;  I saw the bullet shot coming, and it's not because it was obvious; it was just told to me before it actually happened.All in all, a pretty good movie, but not a great one.",3,"Good for Some, but Not for Everybody Who Likes Chan!",994723200,"07 10, 2001",2001,1586,"['Personally', 'liked', 'movie', 'However', 'liking', ""n't"", 'quite', 'addiquate', 'reason', 'recommend', 'movie', 'real', 'fans', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'love', 'seeing', 'really', 'sick', 'people', 'society', 'get', 'beaten', 'down', 'and/or', 'shot', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'hated', 'villains', 'movie', 'watching', 'get', 'hit', 'thrown', 'was', 'something', 'excited', 'quite', 'bit', 'However', 'tragically', 'comedy', 'interlaced', 'action', ""n't"", 'present', 'stars', 'who', 'fight', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'fighting', 'together', 'consider', 'end', 'fight', 'scene', '.All', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'driven', 'have', 'particular', 'background', 'story', 'attitude', 'characters', 'are', 'decently', 'well', 'acted', 'too', 'fighting', 'feirce', 'quite', 'energetic', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'surprise', 'ending', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'liked', 'movie.However', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'score', 'will', 'probably', 'buy', 'someday', 'not', 'quot', 'Need', 'get', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movies', 'quot', 'list', 'also', 'complain', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'shut', 'off', 'captions', 'was', 'happy', 'lines', 'were', 'unclear', 'were', 'spelled', 'out', 'read', 'However', 'captions', 'still', 'ruined', 'movie', 'tad', 'begginning', 'main', 'character', 'quot', 'Hey', 'who', 'visiting', 'father', 'quot', 'Then', 'Caption', 'quot', 'Gunshot.', 'quot', 'Audio', 'quot', 'Boom', 'quot', 'saw', 'bullet', 'shot', 'coming', 'not', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', 'just', 'told', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one']",N/A

Once inside, however, he finds that this dangerous assignment just may be his last.Supoporting stories include a desparate young man (Jackie Chan), who kills the brother of a well-known gangster while trying to raise money for his girlfriend's liver transplant, an ingenious convict (Sammo Hung) who always manages to escape from jail to see his son on important occasions, a convicted gang boss (Jimmy Wang Yu) who earns respect from prisoners and resentment from wardens, and the gangster (Andy Lau) who's brother Jackie killed who purposely gets caught and sent to the same prison to avenge his brother's murder.  Also, along the way are the usual tough guys, weaklings, sadicious wardens, and corrupt officials.The film is a low budget affair lensed mostly in Taiwan (probably in an old airplane hangar redesigned into a prison according to audio commentator Philip Rhee), but this actually helps to convey the real sense of grittiness the characters feel behind bars.  The fights are well staged with Jackie being given the most opportunities to display his acrobatics and martial artistry, although there is one brief car stunt involving Sammo escaping that, while simple, is a real doozy.  Sammo, Tony, and Jimmy are also given the chance to shine as dramatic actors in many poignant scenes showing they're truly more than just action actors.  Sammo's comic touch isn't ignored either as witnessed in two especially fun moments, one involving a large breasted woman and a flat tire, and the other involving a race between a mouse, a lizard, an insect, and some cigarettes!The film's flaws are that it does try to cover a lot of ground in one movie, and that ground is rather familiar.  If you've seen one corrupt prison movie chances are you've seen elements that appear in this one (bullies, weaklings, fightings, beatings, solitary confinements, lousy food, breakouts, etc.)  However, the lead actors succeed in giving their characters unique and very human qualities, the individual stories are plausible and moving, and the fight scenes are appropriately dirty with every move visible and suspensefully logical as the fights build to exiting finales.I recommend this film to fans of Jackie Chan to show that he is as capable an ensemble player as he is a star.  His fight scenes here are plentiful and well staged, and he really gives his all when he's on screen.  I'd also recommend it to fans of the other four leads, fans of modern day Hong Kong action films, and those who just like prison movies in general (as long as you don't mind that the actor's mouths don't match the words since this version's been dubbed into English from Chinese).  Give it a try!  3&amp;1/2 stars!For other takes on Hong Kong or martial arts action styled prison flicks try:  PRISON OF FIRE (starring Chow Yun Fat and Tony Leung), BAMBOO HOUSE OF DOLLS (starring Lo Lieh), THE STORY OF RICKY (with Yukari Oshima), DEATH WARRANT (starring Jean-Claude Van Damme), and IN HELL (also starring Van Damme).",3,Pretty Good Prison Flick,1078617600,"03 7, 2004",2004,3446,"['JACKIE', 'CHAN', 'THE', 'PRISONER', 'originally', 'titled', 'ISLAND', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'group', 'effort', 'way', 'expecting', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'terribly', 'disappointed', 'rest', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'film', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'story', 'cop', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'who', 'something', 'fishy', 'going', 'walls', 'certain', 'prison', 'then', 'undercover', 'prisoner', 'try', 'prove', 'Once', 'however', 'dangerous', 'assignment', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'last.Supoporting', 'stories', 'include', 'desparate', 'young', 'man', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'who', 'brother', 'well-known', 'gangster', 'trying', 'raise', 'money', 'girlfriend', 'liver', 'transplant', 'ingenious', 'convict', 'Sammo', 'Hung', 'who', 'always', 'escape', 'jail', 'see', 'son', 'important', 'occasions', 'convicted', 'gang', 'boss', 'Jimmy', 'Wang', 'Yu', 'who', 'earns', 'respect', 'prisoners', 'resentment', 'wardens', 'gangster', 'Andy', 'Lau', 'who', 'brother', 'Jackie', 'killed', 'who', 'purposely', 'caught', 'sent', 'same', 'prison', 'avenge', 'brother', 'murder', 'Also', 'way', 'are', 'usual', 'tough', 'guys', 'weaklings', 'sadicious', 'wardens', 'corrupt', 'officials.The', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'affair', 'lensed', 'mostly', 'Taiwan', 'probably', 'old', 'airplane', 'hangar', 'redesigned', 'prison', 'according', 'audio', 'commentator', 'Philip', 'Rhee', 'actually', 'convey', 'real', 'sense', 'grittiness', 'characters', 'feel', 'bars', 'fights', 'are', 'well', 'staged', 'Jackie', 'being', 'given', 'most', 'opportunities', 'display', 'acrobatics', 'martial', 'artistry', 'one', 'brief', 'car', 'stunt', 'involving', 'Sammo', 'escaping', 'simple', 'real', 'doozy', 'Sammo', 'Tony', 'Jimmy', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'chance', 'shine', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'many', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'showing', ""'re"", 'truly', 'more', 'just', 'action', 'actors', 'Sammo', 'comic', 'touch', ""n't"", 'ignored', 'either', 'witnessed', 'two', 'especially', 'fun', 'moments', 'one', 'involving', 'large', 'breasted', 'woman', 'flat', 'tire', 'other', 'involving', 'race', 'mouse', 'lizard', 'insect', 'cigarettes', 'film', 'flaws', 'are', 'try', 'cover', 'lot', 'ground', 'one', 'movie', 'ground', 'rather', 'familiar', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'corrupt', 'prison', 'movie', 'chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elements', 'appear', 'one', 'bullies', 'weaklings', 'fightings', 'beatings', 'solitary', 'confinements', 'lousy', 'food', 'breakouts', 'etc', 'However', 'lead', 'actors', 'succeed', 'giving', 'characters', 'unique', 'very', 'human', 'qualities', 'individual', 'stories', 'are', 'plausible', 'moving', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'appropriately', 'dirty', 'move', 'visible', 'suspensefully', 'logical', 'fights', 'build', 'exiting', 'finales.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'show', 'capable', 'ensemble', 'player', 'star', 'fight', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'plentiful', 'well', 'staged', 'really', 'when', 'screen', ""'d"", 'also', 'recommend', 'fans', 'other', 'four', 'leads', 'fans', 'modern', 'day', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'films', 'who', 'just', 'prison', 'movies', 'general', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'actor', 'mouths', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'words', 'version', 'been', 'dubbed', 'English', 'Chinese', 'Give', 'try', '3', 'amp', '1/2', 'stars', 'other', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'styled', 'prison', 'flicks', 'try', 'PRISON', 'FIRE', 'starring', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'BAMBOO', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'DOLLS', 'starring', 'Lo', 'Lieh', 'THE', 'STORY', 'OF', 'RICKY', 'Yukari', 'Oshima', 'DEATH', 'WARRANT', 'starring', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'IN', 'HELL', 'also', 'starring', 'Van', 'Damme']",N/A

What really took away the stars was that this was pretty depressing.  I wanted this to be a feel good movie, like all his other movies.  It's just so sad at the end, I won't give it away, but any one who likes Jackie Chan will fully or partially agree with me.  I thought having Sammo Hung in the film would brighten things up, but he has a depressing role too.  This is the first movie I've seen pop singer Andy Lau doing any fighting.  Can he really do those moves or was it a stunt double?  Despite the  tragic theme throughout the film, it's not a bad movie, but to see a really cool Chan film, you gotta see &quot;Drunken Master 2&quot; aka  &quot;The Legend Of Drunken Master&quot;.
