796686,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000192Y3G,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Let it Be"" is a fascinating documentary of the final days of the Beatles. The recording sessions are quite captivating,from a jam on ""Dig it"" (with John Lennon improvising on the FBI,CIA and the BBC) to George helping Ringo with ""Octopus' Garden."" At times, John seems bored, and Ringo... well, really out of it. The Beatles still enjoy each other's company. John and Yoko dance as the rest of the band plays; the entire group is happy when little Heather (Paul's adoptive daughter) comes in to play. Yoko Ono is often a silent,stern presence,but John lights up when she's around. He's like a teenaged boy in love for the first time. There are tensions within the band (the reason why the DVD versions of this movie are probably bootleg,and Paul&Ringo don't want to see it re-released) Paul and John are the strong personalities,while George and Ringo are more serene. The documentary culminates in the famous rooftop concert of the Apple building--a historic moment in rock and roll. It's a masterpiece.",5,"""Let it Be""",1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,1005,"['Let', 'Be', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'final', 'days', 'Beatles', 'recording', 'sessions', 'are', 'quite', 'captivating', 'jam', 'Dig', 'John', 'Lennon', 'improvising', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'BBC', 'George', 'helping', 'Ringo', 'Octopus', 'Garden', 'times', 'John', 'bored', 'Ringo', 'well', 'really', 'Beatles', 'still', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'John', 'Yoko', 'dance', 'rest', 'band', 'entire', 'group', 'happy', 'when', 'little', 'Heather', 'Paul', 'adoptive', 'daughter', 'play', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'often', 'silent', 'stern', 'presence', 'John', 'up', 'when', 'around', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'love', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'tensions', 'band', 'reason', 'why', 'DVD', 'versions', 'movie', 'are', 'probably', 'bootleg', 'Paul', 'Ringo', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 're-released', 'Paul', 'John', 'are', 'strong', 'personalities', 'George', 'Ringo', 'are', 'more', 'serene', 'documentary', 'culminates', 'famous', 'rooftop', 'concert', 'Apple', 'building', 'historic', 'moment', 'rock', 'roll', 'masterpiece']",Let It Be VHS
796687,A2Y4TLOMC94CJT,B000192Y3G,Andrew,"[14, 17]","I understand that the Vhs and LD versions of this documentary were released around 1981. Since then I have never heard of it being released again. I watched it on television some time in the early eighties (unfortunately I did not record it then).It seems that most visual products of the Beatles have already been released either in Vhs tapes, LD or DVD but not this documentary. There must be a reason behind that bearing in mind that it is still a very much if not the most sought after item by millions of beatle fans in the world, young and old, who have yet owned it. It might be that the surviving members of the Beatles did not want it to be released again. Why? Simply because it was a sad and miserable documentary which showed how the band was about to be broken up under the tension among its members. Following the recent death of George Harrison, I wonder and I very much doubt that this will ever be released again in DVD, Vhs or whatever version.Luckily, a friend of mine recently bought the bootleg VCD version of it somewhere and somehow, and he kindly let me watch it in his place.The Beatles is still the all time greatest and the most influential rock n' roll band in the world. There is no question about that. It has even become part of the western civilization. I do not see that the popularity of the band would ever fade or even lessen in decades to come. More than 30 years after the breakup of the band, even its out-take (visual or audio) is treasured by the fans. There can be no other successful band in the world, past present or even in the future, which can reach such a dimension.",5,Fabulous piece of documentary,1007769600,"12 8, 2001",2001,1615,"['understand', 'Vhs', 'LD', 'versions', 'documentary', 'were', 'released', '1981', 'then', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'being', 'released', 'again', 'watched', 'television', 'time', 'early', 'eighties', 'unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'record', 'then', '.It', 'most', 'visual', 'products', 'Beatles', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'either', 'Vhs', 'tapes', 'LD', 'DVD', 'not', 'documentary', 'must', 'be', 'reason', 'bearing', 'mind', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'not', 'most', 'sought', 'item', 'millions', 'beatle', 'fans', 'world', 'young', 'old', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'owned', 'might', 'be', 'surviving', 'members', 'Beatles', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'released', 'again', 'Why', 'Simply', 'was', 'sad', 'miserable', 'documentary', 'showed', 'how', 'band', 'was', 'be', 'broken', 'up', 'tension', 'members', 'Following', 'recent', 'death', 'George', 'Harrison', 'wonder', 'very', 'much', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'again', 'DVD', 'Vhs', 'version.Luckily', 'friend', 'mine', 'recently', 'bought', 'bootleg', 'VCD', 'version', 'somewhere', 'somehow', 'kindly', 'let', 'watch', 'place.The', 'Beatles', 'still', 'time', 'greatest', 'most', 'influential', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'band', 'world', 'question', 'even', 'become', 'part', 'western', 'civilization', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'popularity', 'band', 'would', 'ever', 'fade', 'even', 'lessen', 'decades', 'come', 'More', '30', 'years', 'breakup', 'band', 'even', 'out-take', 'visual', 'audio', 'treasured', 'fans', 'can', 'be', 'other', 'successful', 'band', 'world', 'past', 'present', 'even', 'future', 'can', 'reach', 'such', 'dimension']",Let It Be VHS

The first painful 50 minutes are rehearsals, demos, noodling, carefully planned bursts of ad libitum piano banging and amateurish run throughs of 50s r&r.; Paul lectures, reminisces and suggests while the others sit in clouds of detached tolerance. In almost every glimpse of her, Yoko looks either very stoned or very depressed (perhaps a combination of both).The real Beatles emerge in the last half hour. Following a set of music video-quality performances is an impromptu outdoor concert, given on a cold, gray day.SYNOPSIS--(r) = rehearsalStudio set up. ""Don't Let Me Down"" (r). Paul gives chords and band runs through ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer."" ""Two Of Us"" (r). ""I've Got a Feeling"" (r). ""One After 909"" fragment. Paul and Ringo do a 4-hand piano boogie. ""Two Of Us."" Paul and George feud civilly. Initial try of ""Across the Universe"" is very bad. ""I Dig a Pony"" (r). A bored Yoko reads newspaper. George on guitar demos ""I, Me, Mine,"" then John and Yoko waltz to an advanced version. End of segment.""For You Blue"" is heard as group arrives in separate limos. Segue to them playing this song. John enjoys his slide guitar while Yoko sits defensively, stiff as a statue. Paul talks about film shot with Maharishi. They cut-up on ""Besame Mucho."" George and Ringo use piano to define ""Octopus's Garden."" John and Yoko hide in a corner. Paul has young Heather with him. Billy Preston sits in on electric piano for ""You've Really Got a Hold On Me."" Silly ""Long and Winding Road"" cha-cha, then a false start. Uninspired 50s r&r; medley includes Billy. ""Dig It"" improv has material not heard on the LP.From this point on, the boys absolutely shine.Polished ""Two Of Us."" Into a magnificent ""Let It Be"" and ""Long and Winding Road."" To the rooftop for ""Get Back."" Curious business district onlookers gather below. Next is ""Don't Let Me Down."" Grumblings from older folks. Close-up of glassy-eyed Yoko. ""I've Got a Feeling,"" ""One After 909"" and ""I Dig a Pony"" as the police enter building.

John was more or less pleased with the end result - &quot;When I heard it I didn't puke&quot; - but Paul was said to have been horrified by the chorus of female voices on &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;.  The recording sessions seem to be less than pleasurable; Paul lectures George on how to play guitar and George snaps back while John merely glares when Paul starts in on him.  Ringo sits off on the periphery during these tense moments.  It's not all sour apples, though.

The Beatles creating great music, and yes,they were creating great music, despite George Harrison leaving (the accurate word would be ""fleeing"") during the sessionsPreviously Ringo had left during the White Album. John would flee later, with his Plastic Ono Band, and that would be it, with Paul being the last to leave, and having to sue his bandmates in the processThats neither here or there. Paul does ""Let it Be"" on his piano, he plays on the piano with Ringo, which is charming. It reminds me of the old Marx Brothers films when Chico and Harpo would be playing a same piano at the same time. A lot of funI tell ya, if you didn't know the band had broken up during Let it Be, you wouldn't guess it from the footage, which is mostly musical. Theres the odd talking between the band members, and Yokos there as well (WTF?!)But you get to watch Paul teaching Maxwell's to the band, going through the chords, which I got a kick from. You see the boys working on the solo for ""I've got a feeling"" - which would be one of the last songs Paul and John would ever collaborate on (the song ends with each doing their own song: John's ""Everybody had a hard year"" & Paul's ""I've got a feeling"" bitSo that works very well, as John's ""Everybody had a hard year"" (which he wrote in India) is more of a fragment of a song, and works very well as part of the tune. I've Got A Feeling is a standout on the album, and REALLY ROCKSGeorge does the odd waltz (I Me Mine) and although he was as prolific as the others (his first solo after the breakup would be a 3lp for Gods sake, just to cover the backflow of songs!)noones interested, noone wanted to be there. Although this doesn't come across in the film, recording Let It Be was an unhappy period for the band, and only returning to Abbey Road (for a little space at least) revitalized the project (George insisted on it to return to the Let it Be sessions)Whether this will ever see release on dvd.. dunno. The Magnetic Video is ok, but it has a grainy look, and the 1981 video release is hard to come across, unless you have a local library with the old release you can check it out from.Well worth seeing.

If you have one of the older Magical Mystery Tour DVD & then got the official remastered Blu Ray/DVD set last year or so your looking at that degree of difference. Still it is a great film, a must have for any Beatlesfanatic & if this is the only way you can get it's better than nothing but they are BOUND to release this eventually. If you must buy look for the least expensive copy you can find or go to one of the many download sites & download it because you're going to want to replace it the second it ever becomes available. As far as the movie itself. It shows the Beatles as tired & pissed off at each other. If this movie had be done naturally rather than forced it probably would have been more accurate but the artificiality of the situation of the being like in a goldfish bowl just made a bad situation worse. The fact that they were able to pull off one of their most towering achievements, Abby Road, shortly after shows just how badly the situation of Let It Be affected them & their creative process. The fact that the songs were as good as they were is a testament to just how great they were. In some ways it almost would be better to look at this as rehearsals for Abbey Road. Despite the depressing parts of seeing them argue there are also parts of absolute joy. While not a film for everyone overall it is a celebration of the Beatles, warts & all, and as such is an important movie.",2,Great movie but Not a great version,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,1985,"['2', 'stars', 'not', 'movie', '4', 'five', 'edition', 'know', 'most', 'Beatles', 'fanatics', 'desparate', 'copy', 'Let', 'Be', 'will', 'disappoint', 'low', 'quality', 'version', ""n't"", 'even', 'as', 'good', 'Beta', 'videotape', 'version', 'Simply', 'grossly', 'overpriced', 'truthfully', 'surprised', 'Amazon', 'cover', 'insert', 'was', 'run', 'off', 'desktop', 'copier', 'booklet', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'made', 'copy', 'Laserdisk', 'player', 'gave', 'up', 'ghost', 'copy', 'far', 'superior', 'have', 'one', 'older', 'Magical', 'Mystery', 'Tour', 'DVD', 'then', 'got', 'official', 'remastered', 'Blu', 'Ray/DVD', 'set', 'last', 'year', 'so', 'looking', 'degree', 'difference', 'Still', 'great', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'Beatlesfanatic', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'nothing', 'are', 'BOUND', 'release', 'eventually', 'must', 'buy', 'look', 'least', 'expensive', 'copy', 'can', 'find', 'go', 'one', 'many', 'download', 'sites', 'download', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'replace', 'second', 'ever', 'available', 'As', 'far', 'movie', 'Beatles', 'tired', 'pissed', 'off', 'other', 'movie', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'naturally', 'rather', 'forced', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'accurate', 'artificiality', 'situation', 'being', 'goldfish', 'bowl', 'just', 'made', 'bad', 'situation', 'worse', 'fact', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'one', 'most', 'towering', 'achievements', 'Abby', 'Road', 'shortly', 'shows', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'situation', 'Let', 'Be', 'affected', 'creative', 'process', 'fact', 'songs', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'were', 'testament', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'were', 'ways', 'almost', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'look', 'rehearsals', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'depressing', 'parts', 'seeing', 'argue', 'are', 'also', 'parts', 'absolute', 'joy', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'overall', 'celebration', 'Beatles', 'such', 'important', 'movie']",Let It Be VHS

If you didn't know anything about the fab fours later years this is what you'll get out this movie: Band jamming in sound stage then cut away to band jamming in building then cut away to band jamming on roof - the end. The film only works if you have piror knowledge of the events of early 1969 that lead to the band demise. Thus film itself suffers from the same hurdle that most rock movies of this time come across: a lack of narrative. Why are they on the roof? What is the building they're jamming in, are they recording? And the sad fact is that there is footage out there that could rectify this.In 1996's 'The Beatles Anthology' we got the scenes of the band and crew discussing the concert on the roof, talking to the camera's about why they chose a sound stage and more importantly the aims of the whole 'Get Back' project. Even some subtitles at the bottom of the screen could give this mess a bit of direction. If this film ever gets released it needs a needs a new cut, including all the meetings the band has with the crew, the on camera interviews with Paul and of course some of the tense moments that occurred while making the movie. Yes, there is the famous scene of Paul and George arguing over how the lead to 'I've Got A Feeling' should be played but for the rest of the bickering that most Beatles fans have heard on bootlegs of outtakes have all been glossed over.On the positive side the performances are great, even if 'Let It Be' did boast some of the fabs weakest efforts the music is still worth sitting through the seemingly pointless scenes of dialogue. In saying that, 'Let It Be' is not a bad movie, in fact I'd say it's a great movie that's been poorly hacked up.

Again there appear to be plenty of conspiracy theorists around speculating about why this isn't on DVD yet. Most of them want to blame Paul...again (surprise surprise!)If Paul didn't want to be seen in bad light, why then include the Let It Be filmed ""Paul-George argument"" in the Anthology Series? Paul himself has admitted he can see how he might have contributed to certain tensions at the time. But remember, as others have pointed out, the band was a hotbed of various moods and emotions at the time...John, joined at the hip with Yoko, was ready to leave the Beatles to do his own thing; George's songwriting had developed significantly but was frustrated at the limited chances to showcase his work; Paul was trying to hold it all together but inadvertently alienated the other members in the process; Ringo being Ringo just went with the flow.  Plus the Apple thing was happening, the Klein management issues etc. etc.Bickering aside, what the film does reveal however is a band that could work together and play some great music when need be. I'm quite confident that another edit of the film would probably paint a different picture. Tensions occur in any band no matter how tight they are. These guys spent the best part of their youth together. That they made the brilliant ""Abbey Road"" after this is a testament to their huge talent.If a DVD were to be released, I would hope it's mixed in 5.1 and included a 2nd disc of unreleased footage and other special features.

I even bought Let It Be...Naked. Yet these were not enough for me. I have watched this DVD again and again, probably 100 times and more. It contains too much to mention: each Beatle's character and attitude at that time, relationship among them (as often discussed), tense and loose times during the session, yet the buzz of their music, which ends up with ""Rooftop Gig"". Also I am aware of that if a beginning fan who does not know them much or a light ""mania"" would watch this, he/she would say ""what's this all about?"" or just ""non-sense"". I am a ""hard-core"". If you follow their history, musically and personally, this film will be the gem though The Beatles don't share happy memories among them. Yet I can see some buzz and excitement during the session and ""Rooftop Gig"".I Do like to say that you should get this film in anyway available from any source available (mostly online) if you are a hard-core, rather than just waiting for an official release (Apple? EMI? Who knows?).Also, if I tag this film, I prefer ""Let It Be"" to ""Let It Be...Naked"".

You can hear some jokes and conversations as you hear in the film, vise versa. I understand Paul never agrees with Phil Specter's production, but we can listen to history (including the recording technology then, which causes some awkwardness and defects for the perfect standard).

796709,A3PBLIJGRM4ZJW,B000192Y3G,The Peripatetic Reader,"[1, 1]","Let it Be is a difficult film to watch. The Beatles were once on top of the world. Young, cocky, truly appearing to be enjoying their success, by 1969 they were physically, mentally and spiritually burned out.John was nursing a serious heroin habit. He only found satisfaction in the drug and in his new-found love interest, Yoko Ono. He seemed uninterested in making music, and as you watch him in this picture, when he is lucid, he is secretly waiting for the right moment to break away from the group.George was disgruntled. Frustrated at not being allowed to display his talents in the group, he was harboring deep resentments at the main songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, for holding him back. That sullen look you see in George's face is genuine. The ""highlight"" of the film is the argument he had with Paul. The result of that argument was George leaving the group for a few days until the other band members begged him to return. By the time the film was being made George had a cache of songs, and as you watch this film, he was secretly thinking what he can do with these songs. Of course, these songs became his three-LP album, All Things Must Pass, which was released after the Beatles broke up.Ringo is just Ringo, but he also left the band for a few days during the filming of this movie. The  distant look in his face is his attempt to distance himself from all the drama in the group.And then we have Paul. He is the only member of the band happy to be a Beatle. In this film he is constantly trying to lift the spirits of his band mates, mostly without success. On the surface, he appears to be a total control freak. This might very well be the case. But the spirits of the other members were so down, it is difficult to tell what were the real dynamics.The Grey Eminence, the Darth Vader of the group was Yoko Ono. She was not liked by most Beatle fans and despised by the other band members. This reviewer's memory when seeing this film for the first time in the theater was that someone in the audience emitted an audible hiss when the camera first panned on her face.For the longest time this movie was not available on DVD. For good reason. The four people we see on the screen are not the happy-go-lucky youths running down a street, chased by fans, nor the young lads peddling their bikes on a Carribean island. It is a depressing film, a documentary about the break-up of a band.See it for the Rooftop Concert. All the in-fighting, grumbling, and drama were forgotten, and for one brief moment it must have felt like old times. And so it will for you, watching the Beatles perform for the last time. Perhaps they were so happy because they knew, secretly, it would be their last concert, and they wanted the last one to be a good one, and create the magic they were known for, in a concert they will and should be remembered.",5,Portrait of the Dissolution of a Band,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,2852,"['Let', 'Be', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'Beatles', 'were', 'once', 'top', 'world', 'Young', 'cocky', 'truly', 'appearing', 'be', 'enjoying', 'success', '1969', 'were', 'physically', 'mentally', 'spiritually', 'burned', 'out.John', 'was', 'nursing', 'serious', 'heroin', 'habit', 'only', 'found', 'satisfaction', 'drug', 'new-found', 'love', 'interest', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'seemed', 'uninterested', 'making', 'music', 'watch', 'picture', 'when', 'lucid', 'secretly', 'waiting', 'right', 'moment', 'break', 'away', 'group.George', 'was', 'disgruntled', 'Frustrated', 'not', 'being', 'allowed', 'display', 'talents', 'group', 'was', 'harboring', 'deep', 'resentments', 'main', 'songwriters', 'Lennon', 'McCartney', 'holding', 'back', 'sullen', 'look', 'see', 'George', 'face', 'genuine', 'highlight', 'film', 'argument', 'had', 'Paul', 'result', 'argument', 'was', 'George', 'leaving', 'group', 'few', 'days', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'begged', 'return', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'George', 'had', 'cache', 'songs', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'secretly', 'thinking', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'songs', 'course', 'songs', 'became', 'three-LP', 'album', 'Things', 'Must', 'Pass', 'was', 'released', 'Beatles', 'broke', 'up.Ringo', 'just', 'Ringo', 'also', 'left', 'band', 'few', 'days', 'filming', 'movie', 'distant', 'look', 'face', 'attempt', 'distance', 'drama', 'group.And', 'then', 'have', 'Paul', 'only', 'member', 'band', 'happy', 'be', 'Beatle', 'film', 'constantly', 'trying', 'lift', 'spirits', 'band', 'mates', 'mostly', 'success', 'surface', 'be', 'total', 'control', 'freak', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'case', 'spirits', 'other', 'members', 'were', 'so', 'down', 'difficult', 'tell', 'what', 'were', 'real', 'dynamics.The', 'Grey', 'Eminence', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'group', 'was', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'was', 'not', 'liked', 'most', 'Beatle', 'fans', 'despised', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'reviewer', 'memory', 'when', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'theater', 'was', 'someone', 'audience', 'emitted', 'audible', 'hiss', 'when', 'camera', 'first', 'panned', 'face.For', 'longest', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'good', 'reason', 'four', 'people', 'see', 'screen', 'are', 'not', 'happy-go-lucky', 'youths', 'running', 'down', 'street', 'chased', 'fans', 'young', 'lads', 'peddling', 'bikes', 'Carribean', 'island', 'depressing', 'film', 'documentary', 'break-up', 'band.See', 'Rooftop', 'Concert', 'in-fighting', 'grumbling', 'drama', 'were', 'forgotten', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'old', 'times', 'will', 'watching', 'Beatles', 'perform', 'last', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'so', 'happy', 'knew', 'secretly', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'concert', 'wanted', 'last', 'one', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'create', 'magic', 'were', 'known', 'concert', 'will', 'should', 'be', 'remembered']",Let It Be VHS

Plus that this was filmed and recorded a year before the group spilt up, it should not be looked upon as thier swan song. Remember Paul got them, as he always did in the past, into Abbey Road Studios and with the help of Sir George Martin, recorded the excellent ""Abbey Road "" album. It's too bad those sessions were not recorded.I still though can't be helped to be drawn in someway to this film and album. I have enough bootlegs of the ""Get Back/Let It Be"" sessions, to know that some of the songs were very strong. Particulary John's, ""Don't Let Me Down"" with flubbed second verse but a full version of the song, as well as George's ""I Me Mine"" which we don't get a full version of in the film. The filming is very intimate giving the viewer the impression of being in the studio with the group. The one issue that has always bothered me that aside from ""The Long and Winding Road"", ""Let it Be"" and ""For You Blue"" and some jamming as well as the roof top sessions. A lot of the songs are left incomplete. There is an excellent jam at the Twickenham studios with both John and Paul at the mic, sort of remincent of when they performeed ""Ticket to Ride"" or ""Baby's in Black"" while on tour, perfoming ""Two of Us"" as a rocking number too bad this was cut short. Having a number of Beatles DVD's and a leatst two with many hours of outakes from the ""Get Back/Let it Be"" film, we are spared the John, Paul, Ringo and Yoko Ono jam session. This footage is hard to watch.All in all it's a needed piece of Beatles history and I am looking forward to seeing it on an official relsease DVD.John-""On behalf of the group and ourselves I hope we past the audition"".",4,A Needed Piece of Beatles History,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,2002,"['Being', 'Beatles', 'fan', 'more', '40', 'years', 'studying', 'aspect', 'thier', 'carrie', 'group', 'not', 'fitting', 'end', 'group', 'Given', 'fact', 'John', 'George', 'were', 'basically', 'finished', 'group', 'time', 'rather', 'sadly', 'how', 'Paul', 'was', 'trying', 'keep', 'things', 'going', 'good', 'old', 'Ringo', 'just', 'trying', 'keep', 'together', 'was', 'filmed', 'recorded', 'year', 'group', 'spilt', 'up', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'looked', 'thier', 'swan', 'song', 'Remember', 'Paul', 'got', 'always', 'did', 'past', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'Studios', 'help', 'Sir', 'George', 'Martin', 'recorded', 'excellent', 'Abbey', 'Road', 'album', 'too', 'bad', 'sessions', 'were', 'not', 'recorded.I', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'helped', 'be', 'drawn', 'someway', 'film', 'album', 'have', 'enough', 'bootlegs', 'Get', 'Back/Let', 'Be', 'sessions', 'know', 'songs', 'were', 'very', 'strong', 'Particulary', 'John', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Let', 'Me', 'Down', 'flubbed', 'second', 'verse', 'full', 'version', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'George', 'Me', 'Mine', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'version', 'film', 'filming', 'very', 'intimate', 'giving', 'viewer', 'impression', 'being', 'studio', 'group', 'one', 'issue', 'always', 'bothered', 'aside', 'Long', 'Winding', 'Road', 'Let', 'Be', 'Blue', 'jamming', 'as', 'well', 'roof', 'top', 'sessions', 'lot', 'songs', 'are', 'left', 'incomplete', 'excellent', 'jam', 'Twickenham', 'studios', 'John', 'Paul', 'mic', 'sort', 'remincent', 'when', 'performeed', 'Ticket', 'Ride', 'Baby', 'Black', 'tour', 'perfoming', 'Two', 'Us', 'rocking', 'number', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'Having', 'number', 'Beatles', 'DVD', 'leatst', 'two', 'many', 'hours', 'outakes', 'Get', 'Back/Let', 'Be', 'film', 'are', 'spared', 'John', 'Paul', 'Ringo', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'jam', 'session', 'footage', 'hard', 'watch.All', 'needed', 'piece', 'Beatles', 'history', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'official', 'relsease', 'DVD.John-', 'behalf', 'group', 'hope', 'audition']",Let It Be VHS
