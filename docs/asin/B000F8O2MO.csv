Sure there were 9 seasons, but I think most of the time the first few seasons are always the best.  With Coach, you get just a short season and an introduction to a family that is very interesting.  The secrets of future shows are hidden in the first few episodes.  Its a really great show that will grow on you as you move from one season to the next.",4,The First Season Was Really Fun,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",2013,400,"['remember', 'Coach', 'fondly', 'teenage', 'years', 'Sure', 'were', '9', 'seasons', 'think', 'most', 'time', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'are', 'always', 'best', 'Coach', 'get', 'just', 'short', 'season', 'introduction', 'family', 'very', 'interesting', 'secrets', 'future', 'shows', 'are', 'hidden', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'grow', 'move', 'one', 'season', 'next']",N/A
985436,A303XG5NI1OUNP,B000F8O2MO,Nathan,"[19, 22]","This is one of the best sitcoms ever. I was born in 76, and this show premiered in 89. I never watched it when it first aired. I think, because I didn't like football (and still don't like football), that I wouldn't enjoy a sitcom about a football coach. So I never gave it a chance. Until a few years ago, I seen a few reruns on TV and was hooked. The DVD release is a treat for me, because I don't have the USA network, and therefore haven't been able to even watch reruns. If you are a Seinfeld fan, or Curb Your Enthusiasm fan...and like sophisticated smart comedy, you will like this series! And if you are like me, and don't care for football...don't worry, you won't even notice the parts about football, because there is so much more going on besides that!!",5,GREAT entertainment!!,1158969600,"09 23, 2006",2006,765,"['one', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'was', 'born', '76', 'show', 'premiered', '89', 'never', 'watched', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'football', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'football', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'sitcom', 'football', 'coach', 'never', 'gave', 'chance', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'seen', 'few', 'reruns', 'TV', 'was', 'hooked', 'DVD', 'release', 'treat', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'USA', 'network', 'therefore', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'even', 'watch', 'reruns', 'are', 'Seinfeld', 'fan', 'Curb', 'Enthusiasm', 'fan', 'sophisticated', 'smart', 'comedy', 'will', 'like', 'series', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'football', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'parts', 'football', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'going']",N/A

Tryggvason,"[1, 1]","I watched Coach when it originally aired in my country and while I most likely did not see all of them, I remembered having fun watching them.  And I was right.  This show is well written with some hilarious moments scattered about.  But first and foremost (and this is usually the case with long running TV sitcoms) the cast is great and you never get tired of watching the central performers.Craig T. Nelson is excellent as Coach Hayden Fox, the head coach of the Minnesota Screaming Eagles.  What makes Nelson so fitting is his ability to play scenes very straight and he effortlessly switches from dramatic gestures to hilarious comedy.  In fact, when you look at the whole 9 seasons of Coach, some episodes are very dramatic and don't go for laughs at all and Nelson is terrific in every one of them.Matching him all the way is the lovely Shelley Fabares as his love interest Christine Armstrong.  Her character would develop well in the coming seasons, while here on Season 1 she mostly looks like a pushover.  Jerry Van Dyke and Bill Fagerbakke are excellent and they can make most anything look funny.  Claire Carey (as Coach's daughter Kelly) is only so so and she mostly exited the show in Season 5 as a regular.I highly recommend Season 1 of Coach.  You get a big supply of laughs and some dramatic eps as well, and that's what the shows do best: A combination of the two.",4,Great sitcom that balances humor and drama very well,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1383,"['watched', 'Coach', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'country', 'most', 'likely', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'remembered', 'having', 'fun', 'watching', 'was', 'right', 'show', 'well', 'written', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'scattered', 'first', 'foremost', 'usually', 'case', 'long', 'running', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'cast', 'great', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'central', 'performers.Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'excellent', 'Coach', 'Hayden', 'Fox', 'head', 'coach', 'Minnesota', 'Screaming', 'Eagles', 'What', 'Nelson', 'fitting', 'ability', 'play', 'scenes', 'very', 'straight', 'effortlessly', 'dramatic', 'gestures', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'fact', 'when', 'look', 'whole', '9', 'seasons', 'Coach', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'dramatic', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'laughs', 'Nelson', 'terrific', 'one', 'them.Matching', 'way', 'lovely', 'Shelley', 'Fabares', 'love', 'interest', 'Christine', 'Armstrong', 'character', 'would', 'develop', 'well', 'coming', 'seasons', 'here', 'Season', '1', 'mostly', 'pushover', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Bill', 'Fagerbakke', 'are', 'excellent', 'can', 'make', 'most', 'anything', 'look', 'funny', 'Claire', 'Carey', 'Coach', 'daughter', 'Kelly', 'only', 'so', 'so', 'mostly', 'exited', 'show', 'Season', '5', 'regular.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Season', '1', 'Coach', 'get', 'big', 'supply', 'laughs', 'dramatic', 'eps', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'shows', 'do', 'best', 'combination', 'two']",N/A
