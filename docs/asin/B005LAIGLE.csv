Mark Wahlberg's character, Chris, is pulled in to help his young brother in law pay off the debt he owes to the drug dealers.

1464228,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B005LAIGLE,Dr. James Gardner,"[68, 79]","""Contraband"" is a 2011 action film starring Mark Wahlberg as a former smuggler reluctantly drawn back into the game for one last score, this time to help his brother-in-law (Caleb Landry Jones) who got in too deep with the bad guys (Giovanni Ribisi).For the past few years Wahlberg has been cranking out the action films at a pace that truly amazes. He's been nominated twice for an Oscar (""The Fighter"" in 2010 and ""The Departed"" in 2006) and recognized for ""Three Kings"" (1999), and ""Four Brothers"" (2005), although my favorite Wahlberg role (and guilty pleasure) ""Shooter"" (2007) has been ignored on the awards circuit.If his awards were not sufficient praise, Wahlberg has delivered at the box office. Seven of his films have neared or topped the elusive $100 Million mark, and most of his films have been among the top 10.And if awards and box office clout aren't enough, Wahlberg has a second career as a producer, a role he served on this film and on Oscar nominated ""The Fighter"" (2010) as well as several TV series (""Broadwalk Empire"", ""Entourage"").Unfortunately, Wahlberg is about the best thing in this film, apart from some good action scenes with lots of explosions and a coy performance from J. K. Simmons who apparently got time off from his role as the Police Chief in ""The Closer"".Perhaps the problem is with the writers (Aaron Guzikowski, Arnaldur Indrioason, Oskar Jonasson) and director (Baltasar Kormakur), none of whom have much experience with American style action films. But they worked on an Icelandic thriller ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" (2008) and that film was the basis of this one. Or, more likely, the problem is that the villain, Giovanni Ribisi, simply carries no menace. Ribisi is a very talented actor (""Boiler Room"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Rum Diary""), but he's out of his depth in this genre.Reviews were unanimously poor.

Perhaps this flimsy film made sense in the original film from Iceland called `Reykjav&iacute;k Rotterdam' which starred the director of this film, Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, in the main role, but Aaron Guzikowski's adaptation of that film written by Arnaldur Indriason and &Oacute;skar J&oacute;nasson leaves so many holes and covers information with fast talking and loud visual and audio effects that the audience is pretty much let to its own concludions about whether or not to care about anyone or any thing in CONTRABAND. As the main character Chris Farrady (Mark Wahlberg) states `I've got to try and fix this. Trust me, I know what I'm doing.'  Well, that didn't work....As the condensed plot summary goes, `Chris Faraday (Wahlberg) once smuggled illegal items or contraband into the country on freighters. He left that life behind, got married has a wife (Kate Bekinsale) family and went legit. But when his brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) got involved with Briggs (a tattooed and smarmy Giovanni Ribisi), a drug dealer and when he blew a deal, Briggs demands restitution which he can't deliver. So Chris offers to find a way to pay him but the he threatens Chris' family if he doesn't deliver. So he gets on a freighter destined for Panama with his friend Danny (Lukas Haas) and he sets out to bring back some counterfeit currency. Briggs ""goes to see"" Chris' family. When Chris learns of this he asks his friend Sebastian (Ben Foster) to take care of them - big mistake.... He tells Chris that it would be better to bring drugs instead of the cash. The captain of the freighter (J.K. Simmons) is on the take and the strange weirdo dealer in Panama is Gonzalo (Diego Luna). Every other minute plans change and the bulk of the film is devoted to hide and seek and violence.With all the writers and scripts available it I always amazing how such fine actors as Kate Bekinsale, Ben Foster, Giovanni Ribisi, JK Simmons, Diego Luna and Mark Wahlberg can sign on to be a part of a film such as this.

1464245,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIGLE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","Well, Mark Wahlberg is up to his neck in another daring heist, except that CONTRABAND comes off as a poor cousin to THE ITALIAN JOB. What's a shame is that Wahlberg gets support from a roster of high profile Hollywood names, and so you'd think the script would've done this casting coup a service. Instead, we're treated - or maybe ""played with"" is a better word - to a routine caper. On doldrum days when the box office is slow, I might recommend CONTRABAND. But, right now, with an assembly of top notch feature films currently holding court? No, skip this 'til the DVD comes out.Breaking down the plot: Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) nowadays runs his own security system service, and he's content. But not so long ago, Chris used to run something entirely contrary to his current enterprise. In New Orleans, back in the day, Chris Farraday was a world class smuggler, bold and inventive. Today, he has a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and two young sons, and so he's walking the straight and narrow. But you know that old saw about just when you think you're out...When Chris's screw-up brother-in-law Andy fouls up a drug run and cheeses off the local crime boss (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris must step back into his old life to settle Andy's debt. At this stage of the story, if you anticipate CONTRABAND as a relentless action-thriller, you'd not be right. A huge chunk of Chris's master plan is to board a freight ship and use it to ferry his loot. That he runs up against the ship's suspicious Captain Camp (J.K.Simmons at his growly best) and manages to tweak him in the nose is just a bonus. On the freighter he meets the rest of his smuggling crew, and it's too bad the script fails to give them much to do. As it is, they don't really register on my radar, except for that one really cautious guy. The film shifts back and forth between Chris' onboard machinations and how his wife, Kate, and his kids are faring back home (they're not faring real well, considering they are continually menaced by Ribisi). Chris's best friend, Sebastian (Ben Foster) is tasked with protecting Chris's family. But since when has Ben Foster ever played a reliably straight-forward character? Well, maybe this time. The first half of the film plods along.The action finally heats up when the freighter arrives at its destination of Panama. Chris and Andy (and their cautious colleague) disembark and here is where I question the timeline. Confined to less than an hour to conduct his business, Chris manages to inadvertently tick off Panama City's current underworld kingpin, get involved in an armored truck heist, evade the policia, and sneak himself and his contraband onboard the freighter just as it's sailing away. This all seems a little too busy for me, but he's not called the ""Houdini of smuggling"" for nothing. Somewhere, Phileas Fogg has scheduled a few minutes in which to be impressed.This is a remake of the Icelandic 2009 thriller Reykjav&iacute;k-Rotterdam which starred Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, a guy who's switched hats because he ended up directing CONTRABAND. Based on his helm work here, I'm not so enthused to check out the original film. The best thing about CONTRABAND is Ben Foster, which is not at all surprising, seeing as Foster is usually the best thing in whatever film he's in. It's fun to see him gradually melt down. On the other hand, a shockingly blonde Kate Beckinsale takes on a thankless role. Giovanni Ribisi, usually a fine actor, adopts this absolutely grating voice (think a whinier Marlon Brando). Every time he spoke, my hand twitched reflexively to slap him upside the head. But this isn't an awful movie. It has merits. I get a kick out of how a Jackson Pollock painting was dismissed and discarded as tarpaulin. From the Panama City sequence on, I was invested. I'll say this for Mark Wahlberg, he's at his best when he's simmering with righteous fury. You don't want this cat to tell you that he's coming for you. And when he's not thrashing the ef out of them hooligans, he's outwitting them silly.

It is about smuggling/running drugs and counterfeit money.Scene 1 of this adventure begins in the harbor.  As a cargo ship is coming in, the police and Customs are swarming around in choppers.  Young Andy dumps 10 bricks of coke before the Customs agents board the ship.Scene 2 switches over to a wedding reception, where we meet Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Kate (Kate Beckensale).  Farraday used to be a runner himself, but he got out of it and became legitimate.  Chris started his own business, Farraday Security Systems.When the bad guys show up at the harbor for their package, young Andy tells them he had to dump it.  It's a no-brainer that the bad guys bust Andy up, primarily a guy named Briggs.  Andy calls his sister, Kate Farraday, from the hospital.  Since Chris still has ties to the bad guy network, he meets up with Briggs and tries to talk.  But Briggs just wants his money, and tells Chris that the debt belongs to Andy AND his whole family.In order to make some big money quickly and protect his wife and children, and to try to help Andy, Chris gets temporarily back into the business, traveling to Panama and back to New Orleans.  As you might expect, things are not as easy as Chris thought they would be.The movie held my interest the entire time.  It was interesting and had a decent amount of action.  Wahlberg was in the typical type role I see him in -- tough guy/protect what's mine/get even.  Beckensale's role was blah.  (Not her fault, the character had little to do except scream.)

1464284,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B005LAIGLE,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","In this plot-by-numbers thriller, Mark Wahlberg plays an ex-smuggler who is trying to get his life back on track with a legit alarm installation business. His cozy suburban life is thrown for a loop when his brother-in-law, following in his tracks, is forced to dump a package of CONTRABAND by a surprise border inspection. Now the brother-in-law is in it bad (to the tune of 700Gs) with the roughnecks who were expecting the package. Led by a scraggly and amoral Giovanni Ribisi, these unscrupulous no-good-niks get Wahlberg involved when they threaten to punish him and his family for his bro-in-law's major muck-up. Gosh darn it, now Wahlberg is pulled back into the world he's tried so hard to escape from, forced to pull one last job to keep his wife and kids out of the paws of these vicious thugs.I can ignore how derivative the plot is. This is an old, old, old story (ex-con is forced back in the biz by thugs who threaten his new life and livelihood), and the addition of a giant boat, huge pallets of ""funny money,"" and a plot twist you can see coming from fifty minutes away do nothing to add a creative spin to the tale. It's so formulaic, in fact, that I promptly forgot every character's name when the movie was over.Wahlberg is one of the few bankable stars left that hasn't completely alienated his fan base. His pretensions aren't very high, which helps, and he is smart enough to stick with what he's good at: being tough, sharp with a word, and cutting an imposing figure. It's fun to watch him, and even though his character here is as flat as a slice of processed cheese, he doesn't seem to be boring himself, and so the audience has a chance to avoid the same fate. Ribisi, too, gleefully chews the scenery as the movie's token Bad Guy Without Limits, and although his character behaves in ways that would normally get him arrested in seconds, his overall implausibility is dismissed by the sheer volume with which he plays the bad guy.There's action here, too, although it's equally implausible. Smuggling, it seems, is all about timing and foresight, and although Wahlberg's bunch gets thrown more than a few curve balls, they all seem to have the keenest sense of timing. Count how many times someone avoids detection or discovery by a literal hair's-breadth, and you'll probably hit double digits before the film's half-way mark. This long train of consistently close calls ends up having the opposite effect, deflating whatever tension the story might have built up. ""Let me guess,"" I said to my friend. ""In this scene, one of the smugglers accomplishes his task with half of a second to spare.""If you're older than thirteen, you've probably seen this movie before. You can guess who will win, how they will, and even what ""surprises"" the movie might have up its sleeve. It's like Mad Libs for movies, these kinds of plots. In this case, it's all done with workable skill and there's nothing glaringly awful about the film. It's just not very impressive or unique, either.

He is a retired smuggler of counterfeit money and other contraband (he don't do drugs!)  Now with a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and a couple of young children, he has his own security installation business.  When his brother-in-law gets in trouble with a mobster (a very effective and slimy Giovanni Ribisi) for losing a cocaine heist, Chris (Wahlberg) agrees to another run, coming out of retirement.  Surprisingly, all his enablers and companions are still in place from New Orleans to Panama.  This is one of those heist movies we've seen dozens of times.  You find yourself pulling for the success of the crime even knowing...well, it's a crime.  But of course, there is a noble cause.As in typical heist films, the plans are terribly complicated and convoluted, yet are created on short notice.  Also every detail must be pulled off without a hitch.  Timing must be perfect.  Yada, yada, yada.  Here's the kicker.  I got caught up in the intricacy and action sequences.  There are explosions and gunfights of course, but they don't overwhelm the film ala, Michael Bay.  If you are worn out from all of the award-worth films of November, December and early January, let this showy film cleanse your movie-watching palate.

1464340,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005LAIGLE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 7]","""Contraband"" presents a small conundrum. On the one hand, just about any new film released in the first few weeks of January is a film the studio has little or no confidence in. They are simply too busy concentrating their efforts on promoting their Award hopefuls. January is a dumping ground and they play films hoping to make some money and earn some promotion for the future DVD and download release. That's why the month is typically filled with horror films (""The Devil Inside"") and bad action films (""Underworld""). While ""Contraband"" would seem to fit this theory, it has a pretty respectable cast. Mark Wahlberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Ben Foster, Lukas Haas and J.K. Simmons populate this incredibly predictable action programmer. Ultimately, it isn't as bad as you might expect because the cast is much better than the material.Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) and his wife, Kate (Kate Beckinsale in the first of her two films released in two weeks. Why does this woman keep working? See my reviews of ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Click"", and ""The Aviator"" for arguments against her further employment in Hollywood. If you need further evidence, watch ""Van Helsing"" and ""Whiteout"") are happily living in Algiers, a suburb of New Orleans. Chris, a former smuggler, now owns and runs a security company, installing alarm systems in people's homes. One night, Kate gets a call from her brother, Andy (Caleb Landry-Jones) who is in the hospital. He was smuggling drugs into the country when Customs boarded the freighter he was working on. He dumped the cargo and now Briggs (Ribisi) insists he is still owed a lot of money for the missing drugs. If Andy can't repay the money, Briggs will come after Chris, Kate and their kids. Chris decides to do one last run, to pay off the debt to Briggs, and gets his best friend, Sebastian (Ben Foster), also a former smuggler, to keep an eye on Kate and the kids. Chris arranges for Andy, Danny (Lukas Haas) and some other friends to serve as crewmembers on Captain Camp's (J.K. Simmons) freighter. Camp knows Chris and doesn't like him, so he keeps an eye on him. Next stop, Panama.Naturally, the plan doesn't go as Chris envisioned and there are many complications. Will they be able to get their cargo? Will they be able to get it and return to the ship in time? Will they be able to hide it from Camp's prying eyes?Directed by Baltazar Kormakur, who played Wahlberg's role in ""Reykjavic - Rotterdam"", the film ""Contraband"" is based on, the new film is a pleasant diversion, which exceeded my low expectations.There is an economy to the narrative of ""Contraband"" that seems to insist we leave our disbelief among the puddles of sticky soda and popcorn on the movie theater floor. As the characters move about their business, we should be clicking our tongues and shouting at the screen ""Come on. That would never happen"". But the filmmakers simply keep moving the story forward. Their conceit seems to say, ""If we say it is so, then believe it."" And this is what most filmmakers do, they are creating the universe, they have the right. The success of the film depends on how well they make this work and how much we are willing to go along for the ride.Fortunately, the caliber of actors helps us make this leap a little faster.As soon as Chris finds out about his brother-in-law's situation, he goes to talk to Briggs, who he finds completely unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate; he wants the entire amount he is owed. There seems to be an unspoken code among the community; Briggs states Chris is responsible for Andy's debts and that seems to be law. This is one of those ""aw, come on"" moments. But I overlooked it and went along for the ride.There is a brief throwaway moment when someone says to Chris, ""don't tell me you aren't enjoying this"". This statement helps establish why the reformed smuggler would go to such great lengths to help Andy. He is bored playing the respectable businessman and needs the thrill, the adrenaline to keep going.Wahlberg is good, earnest and believable. He doesn't really have to try very hard because he has played this character, this role many times before.Giovanni Ribisi plays Briggs, a low-life criminal who lives in the Projects with his young daughter. Initially, his accent seems more than a little strange, but then you realize he is supposed to be Cajun and has adopted their dialect. What doesn't quite work is the speech pattern. He has the accent but he doesn't speak like the person he is supposed to be. Read a James Lee Burke book, watch ""The Big Easy"", visit New Orleans. Simply using the accent adds a layer of corniness to a performance that is already hammy and difficult to watch.Sebastian, Chris' best friend and confidant, is a subdued role for Ben Foster. Maybe he and Ribisi played Rock, Paper, Scissors to see who would play Briggs. Either could. Both have played similar characters in the past. Ribisi apparently lost. The most interesting thing about Sebastian is that he and Chris used to work as a team, smuggling things together. For this last job, Chris asks him to stay behind and watch Kate and the kids. Later, as his character deals with some complications, Foster maintains the character's slow burn persona. He looks like he could blow up at any moment and when he doesn't, Sebastian becomes more interesting.J.K. Simmons' Captain Camp enters the narrative late but he still manages to create one of the more interesting characters in the film. Camp has experience with Chris and because of this doesn't trust him and keeps a wary eye on the younger man. He also has an abnormal penchant for cleanliness, which is worked into the overall story in a unique and interesting way.Kate Beckinsale. If you are a devoted reader of my reviews you know I am not a fan. To say the least. Thankfully, she is not in a lot of the film. Wahlberg's character travels to Panama, taking the focus away from her. Then, a plot development ensures she has an even smaller impact on the story. Because of her limited screen time, she isn't terrible.When Chris begins to put his plan in motion, you quickly realize the plan will follow a pretty standard Hollywood rule that will dictate much of the narrative flow. Because of this, you know how the plan will unfold and the film becomes much less suspenseful.This problem, and an extremely predictable plot twist, cause ""Contraband"" to falter. But it doesn't falter as much as you might expect.Good for a bargain matinee or rental.",3,Very Good Cast Elevates Routine Movie,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,6466,"['Contraband', 'small',

I wish I could say Contraband was an amazing film, but it was your typical, shoot 'em up action thriller, although the plot was better than most. A lot of critics bashed this film because of its predictability, but what do you expect from these types of films? The story, about an ex-smuggler, returning to his old ways to pay off an unexpected debt, was easy to follow and full of cool action sequences. That's really all you can ask for from these films and I rather enjoyed it. If you don't like action movies, don't watch them! If you do like them, Contraband is a pretty good one and few action stars bring to the table the experience that Whalberg has. If you're looking for something that you don't really have to think about, that will hold your attention, and kill a couple of hours, go with Contraband.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,911,"['Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'certainly', 'genius', 'when', 'action', 'movies', 'top', 'game', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'Contraband', 'was', 'amazing', 'film', 'was', 'typical', 'shoot', 'up', 'action', 'thriller', 'plot', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'lot', 'critics', 'bashed', 'film', 'predictability', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'types', 'films', 'story', 'ex-smuggler', 'returning', 'old', 'ways', 'pay', 'off', 'unexpected', 'debt', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'full', 'cool', 'action', 'sequences', 'really', 'can', 'ask', 'films', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'action', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'do', 'Contraband', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'few', 'action', 'stars', 'bring', 'table', 'experience', 'Whalberg', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'think', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours', 'go', 'Contraband']",N/A

When his brother-in-law failed to deliver the goods to a sadistic drug dealer Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris is forced to do one last job: smuggling counterfeit $100 bills from Panama.The action thriller looks a bit like a throwback to an old-fashioned heist movie, though ""Contraband"" is actually a remake of 2008 Icelandic film ""Reykjav&iacute;k-Rotterdam"" starring Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, who now directs the new version. The by-the-numbers story of ""Contraband"" is filled with stock characters played by typecast actors, but the film is fast-paced and its action sequences are decent.For all its familiarity, ""Contraband"" is an entertaining action movie that benefits from slick direction, high production value and effective acting.",4,"(3.5 STARS) Familiar Premise, Still Pretty Entertaining",1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,912,"['Contraband', 'story', 'former', 'world-class', 'smuggler', 'Chris', 'Farraday', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'now', 'father', 'two', 'children', 'happily', 'married', 'Kate', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'When', 'brother-in-law', 'failed', 'deliver', 'goods', 'sadistic', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Briggs', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Chris', 'forced', 'do', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'smuggling', 'counterfeit', '100', 'bills', 'Panama.The', 'action', 'thriller', 'bit', 'throwback', 'old-fashioned', 'heist', 'movie', 'Contraband', 'actually', 'remake', '2008', 'Icelandic', 'film', 'Reykjav', 'iacute', 'k-Rotterdam', 'starring', 'Baltasar', 'Korm', 'aacute', 'who', 'now', 'new', 'version', 'by-the-numbers', 'story', 'Contraband', 'filled', 'stock', 'characters', 'played', 'typecast', 'actors', 'film', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'decent.For', 'familiarity', 'Contraband', 'entertaining', 'action', 'movie', 'benefits', 'slick', 'direction', 'high', 'production', 'value', 'effective', 'acting']",N/A

I was surprised to read about great acting and ""gritty"" feel. There is no grit whatsoever in Contraband. In fact I abandoned the movie about 15 min before the end, exactly because there was no engagement or grit. There are few things which are working against calling this a good movie:1. Boring dialogs. I guess nobody read the script or what? 50% of all dialogs are different characters asking Wahlberg how he is going to pull off his smuggling. He always responds something like ""have faith in me"". The other 50% is Wahlberg invariably asking for more time when on the phone with his accomplices.2. No attention to details. This is the primary reason why this movie has zero grit. They are pulling their stunts in hot and humid Panama City. Yet nobody is even break a sweat.Overall, instead of spending money on relatively expensive aerial shots, producers would have been better off spending on better script and actually waking up Mark Wahlberg. Because Mark looks very stiff in this movie.

Although Mark Wahlberg plays what he plays best: A low IQ blue-collar worker/thief, it still does not save this mediocre action doper film from the waste can.

Any C-rated actress could have filled this role (e.g. Lindsey Lohan stoned).  As they say, Kate couldn't resist a payday for 6 days of work, so she took the money and ran.  Even the bad guys in this film are pathetic, non-menacing.Mark has to stop thinking he's a great producer, actor, and judge of scripts, and fire his agent & manager, and return to being a simpleton sidekick of real A-list actors (e.g. George Clooney in Three Kings).
