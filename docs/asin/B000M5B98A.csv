It certainly was a black comedy; but it just leaves a person with a that kind of confused shock. I'm not quiet sure why but I liked it. It makes ""Little Miss Sunshine"" a family movie. I can't tell you exactly why I enjoyed this movie or why I'm glad I watched it, but I'll write about its plot and maybe that can convey my feelings.Augusten lives with his self absorbed, insane, childish mother (who also happens to be a horrible writer) and his alcoholic father. When their marriage starts to crumble, he is sent to live with his mother's egotistical, self absorbed, and crazy psychiatrist, Dr. Finch. Mrs. Finch is a depressed and unappreciated wreck, Hope (eldest daughter) is worshiping her father's footsteps as she follows them, and Natalie (youngest daughter) is a wanna-be college student with a dark and rude humor.Augusten, 15, has a homosexual affair with one of Dr. Finch's 35 year old students. Augusten walks in on his newly Lesbian mother, who ends up having more psychotic breaks than girlfriends. Dr Finch's family is financially drained and it comes out that Dr. Finch has a habit of taking in patient's children ... and their money.Augusten tries to cope and finally tries to break out of the Finch's madhouse and strive to live a normal life.I'm glad I watched this movie.

A sheer brilliant performence from Joseph Cross, Annette Benning and Evan Rachel Wood and so was the rest other cast. Joseph Cross as 'Augusten' is extremely believable, steals the show pretty easily, he is easily an easy appearence on screen and his chemistry with almost all cast members are remarkble, specially Natalie played beautifuly by Evan Rachel Wood. Augusten's relation with his mother played impeccably by Annette Benning is so unique, you give out your heart to her.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[15, 18]","Definitely one of the most dark psychological comedies to come along in years, RUNNING WITH SCISSORS has an excellent cast telling a truly warped story. What makes this even more interesting is that it's semi-autobiographical. Based on the life of Augusten Burroughs and his dysfunctional surroundings, young actor Joseph Cross does an excellent job in portraying what it must've been like to grow up an adolescent amidst the chaos of mental illness, yet come out the other end as a functioning adult.Annette Bening stars as Deidre Burroughs, Augusten's unstable mother, and does so brilliantly. Her mood swings and mental breakdowns are frightening, tear-jerky, and funny all at the same time. When she sets up Augusten to be adopted by her psychiatrist, the audience feels both a sense of relief and a terrible foreboding. Brian Cox stars as the manipulative yet strangely lovable psychoanalyst, Dr. Finch. His family is a mish-mash of his own kids and those he's adopted and taken advantage of financially. His wife Agnes, played superbly by Jill Clayburgh, is one of the shining lights in the film, giving us a much needed resting post to lean against while trying to grasp the amazing flaws of everyone else (she has her shortcomings, too, but they aren't as broad).The story pulls no punches either, showing how Augusten's early development lead him toward homosexuality, Dr. Finch discussing his masturbatorium (figure it out), Deidre exploring lesbianism after a nasty divorce from her husband (played very well by Alec Baldwin), and the discovery of bowel movements as prognosticators.The only downside to the entire movie was that it feels unbalanced, sometimes accelerating through scenes in mere seconds before grabbing traction again and moving fluidly forward.One could also see the screenplay being a complete disaster if it weren't for the all-star, powerhouse cast. Brian Cox, Annette Bening, Alec Baldwin, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Woods, Joseph Fiennes, and many, many others lend their ample talents to the film. But the ending certainly makes up for any lagging script qualities. To learn that Augusten survived this raucous period in his life and came out the other end still a productive member of society is something to marvel at.

The clutter and collections are exaggerated inside the house, too, so it looks like something out of a horror movie, a really scary one rather than just hilarious.

It helps if your own family tends toward the crazy with some very extreme and over the top members.  I qualify so I thought this was pretty good. I'm thankful to say that I never experienced anything as extreme as this author did though Burroughs, the author and the protagonist here, bases this upon his own life where his difficult parents break up, his mother gets even crazier and he is SENT TO LIVE WITH HIS MOTHER'S PSYCHIATRIST!  The shrink is really crazy yet he is certainly safer with the shrink than with his mother.  She is always just one step away from oblivion in her depression over her inability to realize the life she dreamed for herself.The author picks up a stepsister of sorts, Natalie, and also a stepmother.

They are fine for what they do but they are way down on the totem pole.I'm told that the book is funnier and now I'm really interested in reading it.

I am no psychiatrist so I am not even going to try to label her.  He also has an alcoholic father, Norman (Alec Baldwin), who seems to have little to no interest in his son.  In fact, because of his absence, I thought at the beginning of the film Augusten's parents were already divorced.Deirdre is more dependant on her son than he is on her, he seems to care for her, and she seems to lean on him.  She is an aspiring poet who lets her son skip school to do her hair and plan parties.  The mother and father fight right in front of Augusten without a thought to him or his feelings.  After a rather explosive fight they seek marital counseling and that's our introduction to the colorful Dr. Finch (Brian Cox).  Through a series of events Augusten ends up living with the Finch's and we are wrapped up in another household filled with the emotionally and mentally unstable.Despite his surroundings, you watch Augusten grow up to be relatively 'normal'.  In his need for stability and normalcy, he finds the unlikely hero in the form of the long suffering housewife of Dr.Finch, Agnes (Jill Clayburgh).  She really touched me in the way she cared for Augusten.With all the craziness that occurs in this film, it should be a lot darker than it is.  Surprisingly this movie makes humor out of situations that should horrify.  I laughed more than I cried; I giggled more than I gasped.

1043709,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000M5B98A,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[2, 2]","Friends and family alike have tried to scare me away from this movie. They never really gave a good reason why, only that the mere thought of somebody else watching it gave them the heeby jeebies.  Unfortunately for them the film stars Evan Rachel Wood so they were fighting a lost battle. And besides that I have always been a fair weathered fan of ""Nip/Tuck"" and was curious to see where Ryan Murphy would go now that he had ventured off into film. Murphy turned out to be a very important weak link and possible causation of the films failure, but for a first time director I can hardly complain. Sure, he really has no control of his tone as it shifts all over the board with no clear idea as to what type of film this is supposed to be.  And when things hit rock bottom, which they do with authority in this story, we the viewer are left to watch but are not invited to feel the pain along with these characters. Murphy has at least created something that is real, especially compared to the idealized, bleached versions of adolescence that are always hanging about. This might be one hideous look at one domestic situation but in it we can all find things to relate to. Weren't all of us confused and abandoned and neglected and highly medicated at that stage of our own lives? Weren't we all searching for family and approval, just like young Augusten Burroughs?This movie is based on his book which recollects his eventful childhood where he was given away by his self-proclaimed poet of a mother to her shrink. His dad (Alec Baldwin, playing a character surrounded by a family desperately in need of being called ""thoughtless pigs"") is too busy dealing with his own issues/getting sloshed at the bar to care. So Augusten moves in with Dr. Finch, his wife, and their two daughters. Now what this movie is really about is how nutso this family clan is and to show it Murphy marches out their eccentricities in a strong and steady stream. They move from cute (keeping the Christmas tree up year round) to unbelievable (eating of previously deceased and buried kitty cat) to disgusting (scientific examination of feces). But for all that craziness the film plods along as though we were visiting Dullsville. Normally this material would be right up my alley but here there is something missing.  Annette Bening is okay here as the mother, but she seriously needs to stop playing the same character. As the sisters Gwyneth Paltrow and Evan Rachel Wood seem miscast and not all that interested in trying that hard. Joseph Cross is left to play young Augusten and attacks the role with a moroseness that serves him well enough. The performance is perfectly good, just nothing to stop the presses over. His character needed something of a dark side. And while my friends and family may have been right, this is not a good movie; there really is no reason to fake outrage over this mediocre mess. **3/4",3,No More Whining About Your Childhood,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,2902,"['Friends', 'family', 'alike', 'have', 'tried', 'scare', 'away', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'gave', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'only', 'mere', 'thought', 'somebody', 'else', 'watching', 'gave', 'heeby', 'jeebies', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'stars', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'were', 'fighting', 'lost', 'battle', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fair', 'weathered', 'fan', 'Nip/Tuck', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'where', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'would', 'go', 'now', 'had', 'ventured', 'off', 'film', 'Murphy', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'important', 'weak', 'link', 'possible', 'causation', 'films', 'failure', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'can', 'hardly', 'complain', 'Sure', 'really', 'control', 'tone', 'board', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'type', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'when', 'things', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'do', 'authority', 'story', 'viewer', 'are', 'left', 'watch', 'are', 'not', 'invited', 'feel', 'pain', 'characters', 'Murphy', 'least', 'created', 'something', 'real', 'especially', 'compared', 'idealized', 'bleached', 'versions', 'adolescence', 'are', 'always', 'hanging', 'about', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'hideous', 'look', 'one', 'domestic', 'situation', 'can', 'find', 'things', 'relate', 'Were', ""n't"", 'confused', 'abandoned', 'neglected', 'highly', 'medicated', 'stage', 'own', 'lives', 'Were', ""n't"", 'searching', 'family', 'approval', 'just', 'young', 'Augusten', 'Burroughs', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'eventful', 'childhood', 'where', 'was', 'given', 'away', 'self-proclaimed', 'poet', 'mother', 'shrink', 'dad', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'playing', 'character', 'surrounded', 'family', 'desperately', 'need', 'being', 'called', 'thoughtless', 'pigs', 'too', 'busy', 'dealing', 'own', 'issues/getting', 'sloshed', 'bar', 'care', 'So', 'Augusten', 'moves', 'Dr.', 'Finch', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'Now', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'how', 'nutso', 'family', 'clan', 'show', 'Murphy', 'out', 'eccentricities', 'strong', 'steady', 'stream', 'move', 'cute', 'keeping', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'year', 'round', 'unbelievable', 'eating', 'previously', 'deceased', 'buried', 'kitty', 'cat', 'disgusting', 'scientific', 'examination', 'feces', 'craziness', 'film', 'plods', 'as', 'were', 'visiting', 'Dullsville', 'Normally', 'material', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'here', 'something', 'missing', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'okay', 'here', 'mother', 'seriously', 'stop', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'sisters', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'seem', 'miscast', 'not', 'interested', 'trying', 'hard', 'Joseph', 'Cross', 'left', 'play', 'young', 'Augusten', 'role', 'moroseness', 'well', 'enough', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'good', 'just', 'nothing', 'stop', 'presses', 'character', 'needed', 'something', 'dark', 'side', 'friends', 'family', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'really', 'reason', 'fake', 'outrage', 'mediocre', 'mess', '**3/4']",N/A

Watching ""Running with Scissors"" (great title btw) definitely peaked my interest enough that I will be buying and reading the second memoir called ""Dry,"" about his adult life. This movie had an exceptional A-grade cast and was superbly acted. The characters made up a highly dysfunctional family-of-sorts somehow acheiving the activities of daily living but with  a tension that at any moment things would go very badly, which I'm sure was what it must have been like for Augusten as a child. The film reminded me of ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" in genre and Gwyneth Paltrow has a similar role, but is much more unbalanced, here. All of the characters other than Augusten and Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood) have rather severe and untreated psychological issues.

That has nothing to do whatsoever with my review of this exploitation film.My family has twice been through this sort of life-altering series of events, and after seeing the film in the theater with great expectations, i wanted to gouge my eyes out. The treatment of mental illness was handled in a criminal manner, and I can only guess that this was done out of sheer stupidity or ignorance on the director's part.For people who have been through these tragedies before, this movie is merely a painful drudging up of the greatest sorrows and angers. (Don't see this movie.)  And for those who are unfamiliar with people in this condition, you should not be there at all. I only say this because the audience surrounding us in the theater laughed uproariosly during scenes in which we were crying. This is not the film to see for the average movie-goer with no background in severe mental illness. You would only become more ignorant for absorbing this film.SIMPLE FACT: good acting or bad, making the actions of people with these mental illnesses into big jokes, into prop gags, is just plain wrong. And that is what the director chose to do. The audience howled in laughter during the most soul-crushing parts (due to perverse or moronically skillful direction), when they should have been greatly saddened by the condition of the mentaly ill people. It was utterly appalling.I have not watched such an offensive, debasing film in a long time.  This movie exploits the mentally ill, while it makes the film-makers money. It makes those who have been through the pains of having helped family and friends with mental illnesses relive moments of terror unnecessarily. People inexperienced in this area who see the movie learn nothing or learn falshoods on the topic. The film is done in a trite manner with no regard to actually helping individuals with their lives. That alone is enough to say that this film is so horrible that there is no reason for anyone to see it ever. EVER. Never ever see this horrifyingly misguided explotation film.And if anyone who reads this was on the production staff: producers, (adaptation) writers, the director... please feel free to contact me on this forum. Then we can move somewhere more private (e.g. e-mail). I would not mind having some words with you.The unfortunate result for film viewers who have no dealings with the mentally ill on an intimate level more likely than not will come away from the movie thinking that severe mental illness is laughable at best and can be ignored at worst.

1043724,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000M5B98A,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 5]","Augusten Burroughs' best-selling 2002 childhood memoir is rife with such a twisted sense of humor that a reader can either ride with it or be appalled by it. As guided by ""Nip and Tuck"" writer/director Ryan Murphy, the movie follows the same polarity pretty faithfully, but the 2006 screen translation is so bumptious about its heightened sense of reality that it is hard to embrace the more humanistic aspects of Burroughs' traumatizing story. The convoluting plot focuses on Augusten as a young boy abandoned by his delusional, aspiring poetess mother Deirdre to live with her pompous, cavalier psychiatrist, Dr. Finch. From there, the movie follows him through adolescence as he recognizes himself as gay and goes into untested waters exacerbated by Augusten's unusual living situation.Coming from a broken home, he enters into the orbit of the even more dysfunctional Finch family where he comes to terms with his need for some semblance of order and emotional independence in his life. Burroughs' dark humor is served up by a stellar cast with varying levels of effectiveness. Joseph Cross plays Augusten in an overly pensive manner that makes it difficult to sympathize with his melancholic plight. Annette Bening, on the other hand, does a masterful turn as Deirdre, toning down the inherent flamboyance of the role in a more affecting way than she did in ""American Beauty"". Brian Cox subtly conveys the pixilated narcissism of Finch, and it's good to see Jill Clayburgh, however deglamorized, etch a memorable portrait as Finch's agoraphobic wife Agnes. Evan Rachel Wood does another wild-child turn as youngest daughter Natalie, who connects with Augusten's sense of isolation.In a smallish role that recalls a similar role in ""The Royal Tannenbaums"", Gwyneth Paltrow forlornly plays older daughter Hope as a morbid, cat-loving spinster, while her ""Shakespeare in Love' co-star Joseph Fiennes, sporting an unconvincing American accent, overdoes the role of angst-filled, adopted gay brother Neil. Richard Sherman's elaborate production design deserves special mention, especially in the way he has laid out the overstuffed Finch home, so impressive that it is featured in one of the three shorts included in the 2007 DVD. Burroughs himself is spotlighted in ""A Personal Memoir by Augusten Burroughs"", where he explains the genesis of the book and movie from his own life story, while ""Inside Outsiders"" has the cast (except Paltrow) explain how they approached their individual roles. However, this only highlights how the gallery of bizarre characters, taken as a whole, can be wearing over the course of the film's two-hour running time.

The director managed to stuff in just about everything Burroughs described--his mother's delusions, his father's alcholism, Dr. Finch's overstuffed house and overstuffed life--but it felt very untrue to the book. What is missing is Augusten Burroughs' wry, ironic wit and utter lack of self pity. Without his unique perspective, the portrayals seemed rather one-dimensional, almost typecast. His mother, for instance, was lacking in both humor and Southern eccentricity (""What shall I say to my press?"" she asked when informed of her son's impending movie.) Finch was played far too straight as well. (As a real person he did indeed dress as Santa Claus--without pants.) The Finch house in the movie looked like a carefully arranged set, not the quirky, pack-rat chaos which Burroughs described and which can still be found in this neck of the woods. Also missing was the feeling of the Northampton area, which I believe is essential to a real understanding of the life and times of the Turcotte  (Finch)family, whose ""eccentricities"" were well known. The ""pink house"" looked like something out of Hollywood, not the section of town adjacent to downtown Northampton where the Turcotte family actually lived. Given the local obsession with psychotic poetesses, I think that preserving more of the New England flavor which was so skillfully conveyed by the book would have enhanced the movie and made it fell less generic. With Burroughs' enormous talent, and the rich subject matter of all his books, I can only hope that if and when his other memoirs are made into films, he chooses a director who is less concerned with ""visuals"" and more faithful to the true intent of the author.",2,Hollow,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,1821,"['reading', 'book', 'movie', 'struck', 'empty', 'odd', 'feeling', 'come', 'away', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'crammed', 'director', 'managed', 'stuff', 'just', 'everything', 'Burroughs', 'described', 'mother', 'delusions', 'father', 'alcholism', 'Dr.', 'Finch', 'overstuffed', 'house', 'overstuffed', 'life', 'felt', 'very', 'untrue', 'book', 'What', 'missing', 'Augusten', 'Burroughs', 'wry', 'ironic', 'wit', 'utter', 'lack', 'self', 'pity', 'unique', 'perspective', 'portrayals', 'seemed', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'almost', 'typecast', 'mother', 'instance', 'was', 'lacking', 'humor', 'Southern', 'eccentricity', 'What', 'shall', 'say', 'press', 'asked', 'when', 'informed', 'son', 'impending', 'movie', 'Finch', 'was', 'played', 'far', 'too', 'straight', 'as', 'well', 'real', 'person', 'did', 'indeed', 'dress', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'pants', 'Finch', 'house', 'movie', 'looked', 'carefully', 'arranged', 'set', 'not', 'quirky', 'pack-rat', 'chaos', 'Burroughs', 'described', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'found', 'neck', 'woods', 'Also', 'missing', 'was', 'feeling', 'Northampton', 'area', 'believe', 'essential', 'real', 'understanding', 'life', 'times', 'Turcotte', 'Finch', 'family', 'eccentricities', 'were', 'well', 'known', 'pink', 'house', 'looked', 'something', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'section', 'town', 'adjacent', 'downtown', 'Northampton', 'where', 'Turcotte', 'family', 'actually', 'lived', 'Given', 'local', 'obsession', 'psychotic', 'poetesses', 'think', 'preserving', 'more', 'New', 'England', 'flavor', 'was', 'so', 'skillfully', 'conveyed', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'movie', 'made', 'fell', 'less', 'generic', 'Burroughs', 'enormous', 'talent', 'rich', 'subject', 'matter', 'books', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'when', 'other', 'memoirs', 'are', 'made', 'films', 'director', 'who', 'less', 'concerned', 'visuals', 'more', 'faithful', 'true', 'intent', 'author']",N/A

I wasn't even that wild about the book, and as the movie was not well-received by critics, I didn't expect much.Perhaps the low expectations helped to enhance my delight, but ""Running with Scissors"" is actually exceptionally good. Everyone in the cast provides a superlative acting job, as does director Ryan Murphy, and despite what some others have said, the movie IS cohesive. Yes indeed, most of the characters are exceedingly dysfunctional. That's what it's about; duh. Many critics pan Joseph Cross as being too ""flat"" or unresponsive to his surroundings as the central character of Augusten, but hey - that's precisely the point. He was a child, powerless to control his environment. I will concede however, that Cross' portrayal of Burroughs  possibly places him (Burroughs) in a more favorable light than he deserves. Those of us who have read his books are aware of his cynical and mean-spirited side, which he rationalizes by referring back to his rotten childhood; a forever circular reasoning.Amongst these tragic characters are laugh-aloud moments of dry wit. EX: Bookman's (Joseph Fiennes) guest appearance at Deirdre's (Annette Benning) poetry reading is hilarious, but definitely not in a silly sitcom way.

A family in turmoil as (Annette Benning and Alec Baldwin) mother and father have a large, violent falling out while son anxiously looks on. Enter a soon-to-be-revealed hack doctor, played so deliciously off-kilter by the always astounding Brian Cox, family life takes a nose dive and Augusten Burroughs is suddenly finding himself adopted by the doctor and some-what accepted into his clan of eccentric family members.This is an over the top film and it is based on actual events which makes everything that happens more awe inspiring. Some of the characters are so ""out of it"" it is hard to actually believe, but the content of what is portrayed is sworn to be true.Overall, this is a well acted film and every single actor occupies their character completely, each pulling off exceptional performances. The only flaw with the film that I could actually complain about was the fact that not one character was offered enough screen time or development to truly make you feel what they were going through. Only the lead gets that honor and Joseph Cross is stellar as he carries the story onward. It was a treat to see Gabrielle Union take on a challenging role as the second lesbian lover to Benning's depressed, doped up character. Another stand out turn goes to Gweyneth Paltrow for playing it nutty... and a laugh out loud moment comes at the expense of her hair-do after Augusten gets his hands on it.Yes, solid acting fluffed up with a few humerous moments as well as some truly heartbreaking ones...

1043732,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000M5B98A,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","For those legions of us who delighted in Augusten Burroughs' sharing of his exceedingly warped childhood in the memoir RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, this book to film transformation will be revelatory and extremely satisfying.  Until watching the DVD (not expecting a book of this nature could be successfully molded into a film, much less be a platform for Annette Bening to garner Golden Globe accolades for a role like Deirdre), it is impossible to believe that such a fine book could and is an even better movie.  Kudos to writer, director, producer Ryan Murphy for taking a one-person standup comedy book and mold it into a riotously funny and at the same time deeply moving story about the effects of childhood on our personality development.Augusten (first as 6-year old Jack Kaeding and later as brilliantly transformed by the very talented Joseph Cross) is a conflicted child whose mother Deirdre (Annette Bening in an Oscar deserving performance) is a bipolar poet wannabe with delusions of grandeur who drives her alcoholic husband Norman (Alec Baldwin) out of the house, preferring instead to form a lesbian relationship with Fern (Kristin Chenoweth) from one of her wildly dysfunctional poetry groups.  Deirdre's psychiatrist Dr. Finch (the always superb Brian Cox) plies her with pills and ultimately is the one to whom Deirdre gives Augusten up for adoption.  Finch lives in a grotesque house, but no more absurd than his mad family: his wife Agnes (Jill Clayburgh) eats cat kibbles and appears to be quite mad; Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow) is possessed by God and follows holy commands to bury the cat Freud; Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood) whose perception of her wild family leads her to be Augusten's ally; and Neil Bookman (Joseph Fiennes) a strange dark man who lives in a shed and introduces Augusten to his true sexual identity.  In this madhouse Augusten manipulates his way toward understanding adults and free thought, savoring his unusual experiences as fodder for later use, and getting a handle on his own dreams and ultimate escape from his twisted childhood to run off to New York and become a writer!The characters, no matter how bizarre and wacky, each have redeeming values, much to the finessing by Ryan Murphy of Augusten Burroughs' memoir.  What could have been a raucous mess of a film Murphy, with Burroughs' blessing, transformed into a sensitive statement about relationships, family, extended family, and the degree that harsh reality can actually supplant the growth of an artist.  The cast is uniformly splendid - Annette Bening is amazingly three-dimensional - and the choice of Joseph Cross as Augusten is completely on target for this re-thinking of an impossible book to film.

It is one of the most pointed, moving, blackly funny, and fierce family dysfunction stories I have ever seen.  Based upon the childhood memoirs of Augusten Burroughs (brilliantly played by Joseph Cross), a 14 year old who suffers the wrath of almost every caretaker in his life.  Annette Bening, just nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance and I hope the Oscar in later months, is dazzling and hypnotic and I think gives a more accomplished performance here than she did in ""American Beauty"" which is saying a lot.  Also features a fabulous comeback performance by Jill Clayburgh, and an unrecognizable, hysterical performance by Joseph Fiennes.  I would jump into a plot description, but I think it is best to go in fresh.  It must also be said that Alec Baldwin gives the best performance of his career as Augusten's alcoholic father.

1043737,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,B000M5B98A,James Morris,"[4, 5]","The amazing cast in this film is what convinced me to purchase the DVD, rather than the reviews which were, for the most part, disappointing.  At the end of the film I found it oddly satisfying, although unlike many recent movies I've seen, I kept vacillating between loving it one moment and hating it the next.The actors were all sensational, even if I didn't always number my favorites among them.  At the top of the list, Annette Bening and Jill Clayburgh both gave amazing performances, and I was hard pressed to decide which I liked better.  I have yet to see a bad performance by Brian Cox, and it was perhaps his presence alone that tipped the scales and resulted in my decision to purchase it.  And newcomer Joseph Cross, as the central character Augusten, was nothing short of a revelation.  Considering his age and experience, I fully expect that he will emerge eventually as a major talent.  For some reason, I barely recognized Kristen Chenoweth and Gwyneth Paltrow until well into the film.  This is not a bad thing, since both actresses have such strong personalities, that I often find it difficult to accept them in the roles of whatever characterizations they are portraying.I did not read the celebrated novel, which may be just as well for now.  There appears to be greatly divided opinions on whether the film has done the literary work justice, as there always is when a film is based on a book, whether memoir or fiction.  What matters, I decided, is whether or not I enjoyed it enough to consider picking up the book, and shortly into the film I found myself on the horns of a dilemma.  While I appreciated the nonsensical, comic element and the broad slapstick of the truly bizarre characters and situations, this story is based on an actual memoir.  Throughout the film, I kept thinking that these people, without exception, were just a little too surreal to be believable.  Taken as truth, it is difficult to enjoy the comedy aspect without simultaneously feeling horror for the plight of the young man.  Augusten's father is an alcoholic, his mother is a bi-polar schizophrenic, their home-life is fraught with constant drama and upheaval, and yet, when he is adopted by the eccentric psychiatrist who treats his mother, their totally dysfunctional existence makes his real home seem mundane.  I wasn't sure whether to cry or laugh in some spots and, therefore, I was never sure I was comfortable doing either.I did not have a moral objection to his sexual pairing with a 35 year-old man; when I was a gay adolescent, I was frequently the sexual aggressor on the few occasions when I managed to seduce an older man (and I rarely did, until I was 18).  And the film makes it plain that Augusten was quite aware of his own sexuality, and ready, willing and able when the time came to surrender his ""virginity"".  This was his choice and, frankly, at his age, I would have been delighted to attract someone of the physical appearance, if not the emotional instability, of the character Neal Bookman.  But it was not his sex life that was so alarming; we are asked to believe that Augusten finds himself living in a house that seems as impossibly dilapidated and as strangely designed as it is decaying, while abandoned by his parents, and adopted by a family of people who collectively seem to belong in the criminal ward of an insane asylum.  As much as I have always admired Brian Cox, his portrayal of the eccentric Dr. Finch presented a mental health professional who was beyond the scope of my experience and imagination, and I have met some strange people in my life.  As unbelievable as this doctor was, his family, from the embattled and frayed sanity of his wife Agnes (played, I must mention again, with amazing dexterity, understanding and compassion by Jill Clayburgh, an actress whose previous endeavors I have not always admired) through the ""Addams family"" sensibilities of his weird daughters, Hope and Natalie, made me wonder if it were even possible that this tableau of mental deficiencies could actually have existed.In the end, however, I decided two things.  One, it is probable (and certainly hopeful) that the excesses of this kooky bunch of lunatics were greatly exaggerated for comic effect at the pen of the real Augusten Burroughs.  Taken as a slapstick exaggeration of dysfunction, I allowed myself to admit that, as a comedy, this story was able to produce the intended laughs to qualify it as a success.  And, as a real-life narrative, one must conclude that the final escape for Augusten and his ability to triumph over such overwhelming odds is, if nothing else, an extraordinary testament to the human spirit.  It was this triumphant victory that dictated the hopeful tone of the final moments of this film, and I surprised myself when, after switching back and forth between feelings of horror, humor, disgust and absurd laughter, I was able to decide that the story was not only worthwhile, it was quite satisfying after all.In short, it took me the entire length of the film to decide if I liked it, but like it I did, and my inability to decide that I did like it until  the final credits were rolling, only added to my positive final assessment.",4,"Comedy or Tragedy?

1043739,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B000M5B98A,Joe Carugati,"[9, 10]","Based on the memoirs of Augusten Burroughs, ""Running with Scissors"" was a film that I didn't know much about and wasn't truly interested in seeing in the first place. I had caught glimpses of it here and there, but never actually took the time to sit down and watch it. Well, curiousity got the better of me. After all, any film that stars Annette Bening (""American Beauty""), Brian Cox (""Manhunter,""Zodiac""), Gwyneth Paltrow (""Se7en""), Joseph Fiennes (""Shakespeare in Love,"" ""Enemy at the Gates""), and Alec Baldwin (""The Departed) can't be that bad. Well, folks, it can be.The film revolves around the life of Augusten Burroughs in the 70's. As a child, he's raised by his bipolar, poet mother, Deirdre (Annette Bening) and his hard-working father (Alec Baldwin). Towards the beginning of his teenage years, Augusten (Joseph Cross) copes with his parents divorcing and then taking care of his mother, who knows she'll make it big in the poetry business someday. Deirdre begins to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox), to help her with her problems. Eventually, it comes to the conclusion that she needs Augusten out of her life if she ever wants to succeed with her dreams. The solution is to hand him over to live with Dr. Finch and his family, who consist of the loving, but quirky matriarch Agnes (Jill Clayburgh), the hot-headed Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood), the spiritual Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow), and the gay, adopted son, Neil (Joseph Fiennes), who Augusten begins to have feelings for. As years pass, Augusten begins to move past supporting his own mom and learns to start having to deal with his new family.I've never walked out of a movie in my entire life. Even if I hate what's happening on the screen and can't stand it anymore, I still stay, hoping for some good to happen. ""Running with Scissors"" is a film that I almost stopped, mainly because of how much I disliked it. It's about as interesting as watching paint dry while the only sound you can hear are people yelling and cursing obscenities at each other. If I had stopped watching this film, not only would I have not missed out on anything great, but I would have been better off.The film tries to be too quirky, but then tries to be too dramatic as well. There's no balance whatsoever. There is humor in the film, but it's quite dark. For instance, a character feels that her cat is going to die. She feels that she can speak to the cat and that the cat wants to die quickly. So what does she do? She puts a laundry basket over it so it can't move and it eventually dies from lack of water and food and the filmmakers play it off as a joke. Hilarious...no, sick and twisted. I didn't laugh once in the film, well, at least, not in the right spot (more on this later). Even though the Finch family is weird, there was no real reason to laugh at the situations they got themselves into because there was no purpose for them being weird. They're just weird. The dramatic aspect of the film didn't fare any better. I didn't understand any character choices whatsoever and no relationships were developed well enough to make me care about them. Again, the Finch family didn't feel like a family unit, but just a group of individuals living under the same roof. The film tried to be a drama with comedic bits, but it failed in that regard.Before I begin this part of the review, I want to say that the acting is fairly good in the film and not terrible by any means. The main problem with the entire film is the characters, who are so poorly written, that it's criminal. Annette Bening's character was the worst of the bunch, which is unfortunate, because she's a great actress in the first place (""American Beauty"" rules). If there's ever been a person I've wanted to slap in a film, it would be her character. Everytime she appeared on screen, I wanted to skip past it. The character is one-dimensional throughout the entire film. She's either angry, depressed, or drugged and that's it. I had no idea why Augusten still wanted to be with her, which made me care less about the story. Natalie, the chain-smoking, foul-mouthed daughter of Dr. Finch, also suffers from bad writing. She's annoying and complains about wanting to go to college, but talks about how she doesn't have money and other reasons hinder her. If we wanted to fall in love with her character, give her some drive and determination. Anyone can complain and moan about their situation. Big deal. Get over it and move on (this would be a good tagline for the film). Then, she tries to make the audience pity her in one scene and all I could do was laugh. And that laugh was the only one that came from me while I watched the entire film. I could go on and on about how much I loathed most (if not all) of the characters, but I don't want to waste that much more time on the film.Another issue I had with the film was the profanity. Now, I can handle large portions of bad language only if it serves the story and the situations that the characters have to deal with, but in ""Running with Scissors"" it just felt so overdone and unnecessary. It became mind-numbing and tedious after awhile that I wished I could just gag all of the actors' mouths. I don't know if the filmmakers were aiming for humor at those points, but they just came off as being dirty and not needed at all.The only reason I actually continued watching the film was Jill Clayburgh, the actress who played Agnes. As the mother of the household, she tries to keep everything together and everyone happy. Agnes is the most sympathetic character of the bunch and when she would get sad or angry, I felt that emotion due to the great acting by Clayburgh. In a film filled with unlikeable characters, I truly loved Clayburgh's performance and felt that it belonged in a better film. The final scene of the film with her and Joseph Cross was the best part of the film (not saying much), because of the character and the actress who portrayed her.Overall, ""Running with Scissors"" is not a good nor enjoyable film at all. It's not a comedy nor a drama either. The characters are terribly written and unlikeable and the story as a whole doesn't work well either. The only person that comes out of the rubble unscathed is Jill Clayburgh, who turns in a fine performance. Besides that, there's nothing great to write home about. I really wish I had just turned it off in the first place.",1,Running with Scissors,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,6382,"['Based', 'memoirs', 'Augusten', 'Burroughs', 'Running', 'Scissors', 'was',

Watching this was the first time I've ever liked a movie better than it's book. To me (and I'm in the minority on this) the book seemed unbelievable. A huge credit to the actors in this film. You could see their motives on their faces, they made unconscionable things human and believable. I don't know if anyone got an award for this, but many certainly should have. Especially Annette Benning. When I read the book, to me the mother was practically soul-less. I couldn't understand how any mother could abandon her child the way she did, she seemed to be a monster. Watching the movie brought to mind a whole host of things I hadn't considered... the drugs that were being prescribed to women during that time, what it must've felt like to be at the beginnings of women's full freedom. The freedom to do anything and the burden of doing everything are just par for the course to my generation, but to women in the 70's it must've been a strange overwhelming, new world. I imagine nervous breakdowns were all the rage.The down sides for me was it felt a little slow at times and certain things were not explained very well through the story. If you research the good doctor you'll find out that some things were flat out changed or skipped over & believe it or not he actually comes out in a BETTER light in both the movie and the book. It seems unreasonable, shocking or patently false but a little googling confirms an awful lot that you see here. Strange but true. I also didn't like the Disney-esque change from the book. Although, since Augusten's life had so few bright spots the movie might've been too difficult to watch without a little sunshine.I'd recommend this to someone looking to see a quirky drama or someone engaged in women's studies. If one is especially sensitive to the subjects of molestation, homosexuality or fecal matter, this should proabably be skipped. (I certainly could've lived without seeing some of this.) I'd also recommend that anyone watching the movie also read the book and do a little surfing around to get a little more background on the people represented herein.One last small thing was the house... it was exactly what I pictured as a read. I've never had a film feel like it popped out of my own mind before.

1043744,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B000M5B98A,Kendra,"[27, 29]","I don't know how I could have missed this when it first came out. Augusten Burroughs is my favorite memoirist and I've read all his books and praise them all.  So, when I heard that Running with Scissors was being made into a film I was thrilled. I think, though, when I saw that it was marketed as a comedy AND the reviews were just mediocre, I decided not to see it.  Big mistake.This is an amazing story.  And, the cast was incredible-- the acting absolutely superb.  I am just shocked at the poor reviews here. Not one thing was wrong with this movie. Really. Not one thing.Jill Clayburgh and Annette Benning should have received an Academy for their part in this. Brian Cox was fantastic. And Joseph Cross, as Augusten was absolutely perfect. I can't praise Cross enough and I don't think too many people would have been able to pull this character off. Knowing Burroughs from his books, you see he has a caustic yet self-deprecating wit.  But, to actually SEE him as the child he was-- maintaining his innocence while being exposed to horrendous circumstances he was exposed to actually made me appreciate Burroughs even more than I already do.  Alec Baldwin, as always, played his brief part perfectly-- with empathy and depth.Burroughs grew up in one of the most dysfunctional homes you will ever read about. After his parents divorced, he lived with his mentally ill and completely narcissistic mother until she handed Augusten over to her just-as-mentally-ill psychiatrist to raise him. The environment in this psychiatrist's home has to be seen (or read about) to be believed. Poor Augusten lived there for several years while his mother attempted to ""find herself"" and nurture herself at her son's expense.  She even had the psychiatrist adopt her son.Ironically, although it is difficult not to blame Burroughs' mother in all this- she's the epitome of narcissism-- the truth is, the MD is really the one to be reviled. Had his mother been treated by almost any other mental health professional rather than this one, it is likely everyone in Augusten's family would have been better off.  Instead of treating his patients, the doctor did everything to mistreat them. I would like to believe that he was just insane, too, with no evil intent.  But the truth is, I'm not so sure.Somehow, despite his childhood, Augusten Burroughs became an adult to be admired. He went through incredibly difficult times, even after he left the psychiatrist's home. But, he persevered and his character was not permanently damaged. When reading his other books, it's clear that he analyzes all his behaviors and feelings and strives to be the best person he can possibly be.This film is NOT a comedy. It has comedic elements, but it is a travesty that it was marketed as a comedy. One of the things that makes Burroughs' books so good is his dry (almost gallows) humor. But, his life isn't really a comedy. It's a tragedy that, thankfully, has a happy ending.

Did I ""enjoy"" this film?...NO.Did I love it?...yes!As crazy as this film may seem to some people,this was my life!!! It made total crazy,bizarre,funny,happy,sad sense.Dierdre Burroughs was my mother.I was Augusten.I remember all of the ""therapy sessions"", the ""new"" prescription drugs that the ""analyst"" prescribed.I remember the manic behaviors of my creative genius mother...and I remember the little boy caught in the crossfire, being raised by other ""nutty"" people;..... and I remember when I said ""ENOUGH!"" and left all of it, went to therapy,saw it for what it was.... and survived it all just like Augusten did!The 1970's was the ""self help""- Gesthalt/Jung -horoscope- analyst age.The 1960's set it up, and the 1970's ran with it....big time...and those of us who had parents that fell under it's spell either went with it or fell with them.Scream therapy was all the rage.Our medicine chests looked like mini-pharmacies.Our parents took the drugs and the ""analysts"" put we children on some drugs,too. All of my childhood friends were on the ""lavender pill"" (which to this day I still don.t know what it was called...it just kept me calm...of course I don't really remember being upset! hmm) Our parents were trying to ""find themselves"" and they had us kids!!!!! What a f***ing trip!!!!I said in the beginning...did I ""enjoy"" the film and answered NO. Well, it is never pleasant watching your own uncomfortable life on the screen where others laugh at it or say ""that was ridiculous"". All I can say is ""You would have had to have been there"".Will I view this film over and over again? ABSOLUTELY! Why? There are two phenomenal actings jobs in this film that create such hatred and sympathy in me; the characters portrayed by an  amazing Annette Bening and even better still Jill Clayburgh.These two veteran actresses  tackled VERY difficult and unlikeable and conflicted women.I know their characters, and Bening and Clayburgh have them complete through and through.Each are victims of a control beyond them.Both have made horrendous decisions (possibly selfish) with no thought as to the results that would have occurred on the children.Augusten (Joseph Cross) was caught in the crossfire.He was abandoned, and unfortunately was given no boundaries to go by. He became an adult way before he should have, yet he was still a child and continued to grow as one making both profitable and unprofitable decisions in life (see the DVD extras).(It is significant to note here that WOMEN were prescribed rather harsh anti-psychotic drugs from the '50's to the '70's that flipped them out completely.See ASHLEY JUDD'S performance in YA-YA SISTERHOOD and JULIANNE MOORE in THE HOURS. Drugs such as HALDOL,MILLTOWN were staples that ruined women's brains and subsequently their children's lives!)I am sure that reviews of this film will vary greatly due to differing experiences; but for me it was a complete uncomfortable yet profitable learning experience to realize that I am not alone and just how wonderfully far I have come.I am a very well adjusted individual and am pleased to say that my childhood of ""running with scissors"" allowed me to make hard but excellent choices for career,friends and life partner that have all been healthy and lasting.Some people do survive and flourish after scissors.Did I ""love"" this film? Not in the way that I ""loved"" films that thoroughly entertained me and I walked away singing.Not ""Scissors""...that didn't happen.I did leave, though, content in my place in life and I learned.This was a highly personal film for me.I write only so that someone might understand.You do not have to ""like"" this film at all...I could understand that.I would recommend Ang Lee's THE ICE STORM as a great companion movie.Anyone who specifically had their lives influenced by the ""analysis decade"" of the 1970's can benefit greatly by viewing these two films.I would also review THE DIVINE SECRETS

""Running With Scissors"" is one movie that you should avoid watching at all cost and just stick with the book.With the book, I laughed so hard at some of Burroughs' childhood memories with his mother's psychiatrist's dysfunctional family.  And 'dysfunctional' doesn't even describe this kooky family accurately.  I'm surprised Burroughs came out of this experience sane instead of lying in a white padded cell with nothing on but a straightjacket.This movie is just simply about Burroughs' over-extended stay with his mother's psychiatrist's family.  Burroughs' mother is a poetress...however, an unsuccessful one.  Her failure to establish herself as a recognized poetress has affected her mental health.  With his father out of the picture, his mother cannot handle taking care of Burroughs while dealing with personal issues.  So, with a secret deal with her doctor, she dumps Burroughs and takes off.  Burroughs has not choice but to make do with a strange family and their strange house.There was nothing funny in the movie.  There was nothing dark humor/comedy about it.  It was just dry.

In ""Running With Scissors"", the characters have the frailty of real life with some of the worst decision-making you'll ever see a parent make.The plot revolves around the codependent relationship of a mentally ill mother (Benning) and her precocious son (Cross) that develops early in life and fearfully projects a late Eodipus episode. Fortunately, that never happens even though the father is defeated in a different way. To make the family stew even more worthwhile, the father is alcholic and mom's psychiatrist is loony and perfectly portrayed by Brian Cox, a veteran character actor doing some of his best work in this film.This film is tragically realistic and equally as funny. Its first hour is full of one liners that will make you laugh out loud. When Benning's shrink visits her house, she asks if he wants a drink. ""No,"" Cox says, ""I want bologna slices with a side of horseradish."" These unexpectedly and acerbicly funny lines dominate the script in the first hour. Afterward, the movies turns a bit darker and young Augusten grows up, is cast with a new family, discovers his homosexuality, and plays out life growing up amidst madness.It shouldn't surprise you that families like the one portrayed here exist even if you don't see them in your neighborhood. This film is not the best portrait of reality but is a nice mix of black comedy and dysfunction that transcends many of Hollywood's glamourous trappings.

There seem to be many problems here. None of the characters really appeal to you. There are one or two that have redeemable qualities - but many are just out and out bad.

1043751,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000M5B98A,Melissa Niksic,"[16, 23]","If you're a fan of the book ""Running with Scissors,"" I think you'll be disappointed with the movie adaptation. I was.This film is based on Augusten Burroughs' memoir of the same name. Burroughs (played by Joseph Cross in the film) grew up in a household with an alcoholic father, Norman (Alec Baldwin), and a mentally unbalanced mother, Deirdre (Annette Bening). Augusten's father eventually walked out on his wife and son, leaving Augusten and Deirdre to fend for themselves. Unfortunately, Deirdre is so screwed up that she's unable to care for herself, let alone be a stable parent to Augusten. Enter Dr. Finch (Brian Cox), Deirdre's unorthodox psychiatrist. Augusten soon comes to realize that Dr. Finch's methods for treating patients are beyond crazy...and speaking of crazy, the entire Finch family is just as nutty as its patriarch. Augusten gets to experience the madness of the Finch household firsthand when Deirdre decides to let Dr. Finch and his wife Agnes (Jill Clayburgh) adopt her son. In addition to Dr. and Mrs. Finch, Augusten has to deal with sultry Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood), uptight Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Neil Bookman (Joseph Fiennes), the Finch's 35-year-old adopted schizophrenic son.Augusten goes through a lot during his time in the Finch household, including being involved in a homosexual relationship with Neil. Ultimately, Augusten realizes that the only way he'll be able to escape his mother and the Finch family is to take matters into his own hands, but he doesn't know if he's strong enough to do that.I think this movie was perfectly cast. The shining star of the film is Bening, who delivers an unbelievably fantastic performance as the troubled Deirdre. Fiennes also has some great scenes as Neil (the poetry reading session is one of my favorite scenes in the film). I think the problem with this film is the screenplay, which is pretty bad. There are so many outlandish things that are outlined in the book but do not translate to the big screen. I'm not surprised that the producers felt the need to tone things down somewhat: a movie with graphic homosexual love scenes, parental avocation of children having sex with middle-aged predators, and intense scrutiny of human feces probably wouldn't go over very well in most social circles. However, by omitting so many important details and toning down the material that actually did make the cut, the movie just doesn't have the same shock value as the book, which is a shame.The movie also seems to focus much more on Deirdre than the Finch family. As I mentioned before, Bening's performance is excellent and all her scenes are enjoyable to watch, but I think the Finch family should have been featured more, especially Dr. Finch himself. The doctor's character was never fully developed in the film at all.I also don't understand why certain things were changed drastically from the book.

Augusten is living a fairly normal existence with his alcoholic father (Baldwin) and his bopolar mother (Bening). Other than the fact that his mother is a frustrated, unpublished poet with dreams of fame, his life is pretty pat. Then, his mother begins seeing Dr. Finch (Cox), a psychiatrist who is at best, unorthodox, and at worst, preying on his patients. Soon after, Augusten's parents divorce, and his mother sends him to live with Finch and his odd extended family in a boarded-up old mansion. (Finch eventually formally adopts Augusten. Eeek.)The film, told in the memoir style, is Augusten's account of how he survived his tumultuous growing-up years in such an eccentric environment.Augusten notes at the beginning of the movie that no one will ever believe him. And it's true. It's hard to believe a mother as crazy as Diedre Burroughs. A shrink as crazy as Dr. Finch. A house as weird as the one Augusten grew up in. But the cast does their best to make it work. Bening is, as always, a triumph. Paltrow is eerily committed. I almost didn't even recognize Joseph Fiennes under all that hair.

1043754,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000M5B98A,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","Based on Augusten Burroughs' 2002 memoir about his dysfunctional childhood, ""Running With Scissors"" (2006), is like a blend of ""The Upside of Anger""(2005) and ""Tideland"" (2005). The film was not commercial enough for widespread theatrical release but has built up a decent size cult following and probably sold some books. If you don't like the film (or at least relate to it) it is probably because your family was not dysfunctional enough.As Paul Newman discovered when he made ""The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds"" (1972), stories about mentally disturbed mothers engaging in screaming matches don't make for upbeat movies; even with a theme of a child successfully overcoming adversity. So director Ryan Murphy was tasked by his producer with the objective of lightening up his screen adaptation of ""Scissors."" Unfortunately he was not entirely successful and the obvious comedic elements are awkwardly inserted and don't really work, as comedy anyway.Fortunately (at least for those able to relate to the film) his production designer and his post-production team save the day and the film achieves a nice lyrical quality. So watch for those moments that work best. These are the intricately edited montages matched to the playing of popular songs from the period (the film is set in the 1970's) including ""Bennie and the Jets"", ""The Year of the Cat"", and ""Blinded by the Light"". My favorite is the match-cut screams at about the midway point of the story. The film's final credits go out to ""Teach Your Children"", a little too obvious perhaps but a good match with the ironic tone that flows throughout the film.Momma's boy Augusten (Joseph Cross) is sent to live with his mother's well-intentioned but deeply disturbed psychiatrist Dr. Finch (Brian Cox), so basket case Mom (Annette Bening) can be properly sedated and focus on her bad poetry. Dr. Finch's household is a product of his own extreme weirdness, and is housed in a dilapidated pink mansion under the constant threat of IRS repossession. Rebellious daughter Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood basically playing her ""Upside of Anger"" character but with mega eye makeup), her Bible-directed sister (Gwyneth Paltrow-who nicely teases her role), his kibble-snacking wife Agnes (nicely underplayed by Jill Clayburgh), and a 35 year-old prone to violence adopted son (Joseph Fiennes).Augusten's mother is not a one dimensional Mommie Dearest. She's a complicated bundle of unfulfilled ambition with the occasional lucid moments when she is not pumped full tranquilizers. As the story moves forward she goes from being an Auntie Mame toward her adoring child to a self-absorbed free spirit. There is an anti-permissiveness subtext in much of this, with Augusten yearning for rules and structure in place of constant (usually unpleasant) surprises.Everyone in the cast delivers first-rate performances. If you can relate to the material, focus in on the best individual sequences, and overlook the director's inability to find a precise focus you should enjoy the film.Then again, what do I know?

1043755,A3D3YRAOMY3J12,B000M5B98A,"paygenie ""Pianist and sheet music collector""","[1, 3]","Let me start with this: I was very negatively biased toward this film before it even came out. I had read Augusten Burroughs' hard-to-believe memoir, ""Running with Scissors,"" and articles written about how Burroughs' had exaggerated and made up parts of his so-called true life story. It was apparent that Mr. Burroughs', having been abandoned by his mother and left in the care of her psychiatrist, endured a difficult adolescence, but Burroughs' account of his time at the Finch (not their real name) household sounds more like the imagination of a writer whose aim is just to shock readers with a ""how crazy can they be"" agenda.So I was kind of disgusted to learn the book had been optioned for a movie. I thought, let this so-called memoir die, quickly and quietly, please. On a chance encounter at the library, I picked up the DVD. I'm glad I did.The film does what the book does not: through excellent writing and direction by Ryan Murphy (I believe his feature film directorial debut) and amazing acting (Annette Bening's got all the buzz, but Alec Baldwin -- as Augusten's alcoholic and distant father, Joseph Fiennes -- as Augusten's lover twenty years his senior, and Evan Rachel Wood -- as Augusten's best friend who yearns for a life of her own away from her crazy family, all give heartbreaking performances) it connects the seemingly random vignettes into a painfully human portrait of the psychological baggage we all carry. It humanizes individuals rather than merely demonizing them as freaks.For example, in the book Agnes Finch, the wife of the crazy psychiatrist, is just a loon who nibbles on puppy kibble. In the movie, she becomes a surrogate mother to Augusten and a woman desperate to hold onto her family no matter how crazy, in a heartbreaking performance by Jill Clayburgh. Joseph Cross is fine as Augusten, and paired with Bening, and solidly portrays a son betrayed by his mother and still yearning for her affection.Though some of Burroughs' more outlandish moments are kept in the movie (Dr. Finch's masturbatorium is included, as is Augusten and Natalie's destruction of the kitchen ceiling), Murphy's careful scripting and the film editing (made seamless through classic 70s music, without resorting to being cliche) makes these seemingly bizarre scenarios believable in the world that is carefully crafted on the screen.That's where Burroughs' failed in his writing of his memoir: he is detached from his subjects, viewing them from a distance with disgust. So he couldn't recreate the chaotic world in which he grew up so that we could all believe him. The film instead draws you into the Finch household, thus succeeding in recreating the atmosphere of psychological torment, without keeping you at ""I don't believe this"" bay. Yet the film still doesnt avoid the skepticism that surrounded the book, either, as stated by Cross' Augusten (paraphrased): ""What's the difference whether this story is true? You won't believe me anyway.""If you don't take accuracy as the most important thing, you'll enjoy the film as an outstandingly-made family drama. Sadly, because of the furor surrounding the book, ""Running with Scissors"" the movie just didn't draw much of a crowd. Too bad for one of the best humanizing family dramas, that's almost as good as another film that came out in 2006 about a dysfunctional family: the much-loved ""Little Miss Sunshine.""",4,"Skip the book, see the film; a true talent in filmmaker Ryan Murphy",1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,3386,"['Let', 'start', 'was', 'very', 'negatively', 'biased', 'film', 'even', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'read', 'Augusten', 'Burroughs', 'hard-to-believe', 'memoir', 'Running', 'Scissors', 'articles', 'written', 'how', 'Burroughs', 'had', 'exaggerated', 'made', 'up', 'parts', 'so-called', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'apparent', 'Mr.', 'Burroughs', 'having', 'been', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'left', 'care', 'psychiatrist', 'endured', 'difficult', 'adolescence', 'Burroughs', 'account', 'time', 'Finch', 'not', 'real', 'name', 'household', 'more', 'imagination', 'writer', 'aim', 'just', 'shock', 'readers', 'how', 'crazy', 'can', 'be', 'was', 'kind', 'disgusted', 'learn', 'book', 'had', 'been', 'optioned', 'movie', 'thought', 'let', 'so-called', 'memoir', 'die', 'quickly', 'quietly', 'please', 'chance', 'encounter', 'library', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.The', 'film', 'what', 'book', 'not', 'excellent', 'writing', 'direction', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'believe', 'feature', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'amazing', 'acting', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'got', 'buzz', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Augusten', 'alcoholic', 'distant', 'father', 'Joseph', 'Fiennes', 'Augusten', 'lover', 'twenty', 'years', 'senior', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Augusten', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'life', 'own', 'away', 'crazy', 'family', 'give', 'heartbreaking', 'performances', 'seemingly', 'random', 'vignettes', 'painfully', 'human', 'portrait', 'psychological', 'baggage', 'carry', 'individuals', 'rather', 'merely', 'demonizing', 'freaks.For', 'example', 'book', 'Agnes', 'Finch', 'wife', 'crazy', 'psychiatrist', 'just', 'loon', 'who', 'puppy', 'kibble', 'movie', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'Augusten', 'woman', 'desperate', 'hold', 'family', 'matter', 'how', 'crazy', 'heartbreaking', 'performance', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'Joseph', 'Cross', 'fine', 'Augusten', 'paired', 'Bening', 'solidly', 'son', 'betrayed', 'mother', 'still', 'yearning', 'affection.Though', 'Burroughs', 'more', 'outlandish', 'moments', 'are', 'kept', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Finch', 'masturbatorium', 'included', 'Augusten', 'Natalie', 'destruction', 'kitchen', 'ceiling', 'Murphy', 'careful', 'scripting', 'film', 'editing', 'made', 'seamless', 'classic', '70s', 'music', 'resorting', 'being', 'cliche', 'seemingly', 'bizarre', 'scenarios', 'believable', 'world', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'screen.That', 'where', 'Burroughs', 'failed', 'writing', 'memoir', 'detached', 'subjects', 'viewing', 'distance', 'disgust', 'could', ""n't"", 'recreate', 'chaotic', 'world', 'grew', 'up', 'so', 'could', 'believe', 'film', 'instead', 'draws', 'Finch', 'household', 'thus', 'succeeding', 'recreating', 'atmosphere', 'psychological', 'torment', 'keeping', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'bay', 'film', 'still', 'skepticism', 'surrounded', 'book', 'either', 'stated', 'Cross', 'Augusten', 'paraphrased', 'What', 'difference', 'story', 'true', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'accuracy', 'most', 'important', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'outstandingly-made', 'family', 'drama', 'Sadly', 'furor', 'surrounding', 'book', 'Running', 'Scissors', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'draw', 'much', 'crowd', 'Too', 'bad', 'one', 'best', 'humanizing', 'family', 'dramas', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'came', 'out', '2006', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'much-loved', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine']",N/A

1043757,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B000M5B98A,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 1]","Several years ago, I attended C-SPAN's book tour in Chicago.  Amongst many writers promoting their upcoming books was Augustin Burroughs.  Although I never read his work, I knew his name and that he had a best selling memoir out -- at the time, when people were fabricating their own.  I guess Augustin's childhood was such a preposterous one that other writers tried to match it to some degree by fictionalizing parts of their own.  In any case, book reading was fun and Augustin was reading from his new book.  I could see that this is a writer who prides himself on seeing humor in the obscene world around us.  I was also struck by his openness and frankness that inlcued his sexual orientation as well.  So when this movie came out I had to see it.  I was hoping to capture his childhood and see how he became the man and writer that he is today.  And while the film will keep you mesmerized about his growing up, his parents, his parents' divorce and unbelievable life afterwards, you will truly enjoy Annette Bening's portrayal of the middle aged bi-polar woman who is incapable of being a mother and cannot cope with her own miserable life.

I suspect it took alot of guts for Augusten Burroughs to let this hen out, and for that, I gotta throw in a star-he was, according to the extras, genuinely trepidatious towards making this a film until he met Ryan Murphy, who wears three hats here as screenwriter, director, and producer.'Cause this is not a pretty tale: if this is reality, then it is 50 times stranger than fiction, beyond anything that say, Wes Anderson could imagine(he having mined the 'whacko family' subgenre a few times). Augusten's mother has delusions of grandeur about being an artist, and proceeds to embark on a journey of suffering and madness to become one- throwing 13 year-old Augusten's life into the hands of her shrink and his family. The shrink is a quack, treating with every discredited, discarded Freudian sublimation/repression theory one can think of. Oh, and he also has his family deeply ensconced in his madness. Mom goes lesbian, Augusten goes gay, and both of them search in vain for a place to belong-unfortunately, that place is not within the nexus of the Burroughs family. I think that is the heart of the movie, I don't know about the book. People suffer when they cannot appreciate what love they do have.I don't blame anyone for not liking this. There's plenty of reasons not to, but I find the writer rather brave if half of what was in this film really happened, and I suppose if that's what you like, against a killer 70's soft pop soundtrack, this is good stuff.

The character's gay, and Mr. Cross is believable as a gay would-be hairdresser (sorry, cosmetologist).  Most of the attention is going to be paid to Annette Bening's Deirdre Burroughs' performance, and Ms. Bening plays the self-indulgent, no-talent mother well, but the character is totally without sympathy.  Jill Clayburgh plays Agnes Finch as a sad-sack, overwhelmed loser, but is one of the few sympathetic characters in the film.  The beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow plays a character (Hope Finch) somewhat similar to her role in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (quirky to a fault).Overall, the movie was somewhat entertaining, but don't expect lots of laughs.  My thoughts were (1) the father played (well) by Alex Baldwin should have divorced (or better yet, never married) Deirdre; (2) Child protective Services would have had its hands full with the Finch's even more dysfunctional family; (3) getting Augusten out of both the Burroughs' and the Finch's house was what we all were waiting for; and (4) the IRS hounding of Mr. Finch was probably the best use of that agency in quite some time.I can't really recommend the movie, but it isn't as bad as the worst reviews here, nor as good as the five-star reviews.

When is the last time you saw a book-to-screen movie and ended up liking both the book and the movie equally?  I have never read the book, so I have nothing to compare this movie to.  And I can honestly say, I appreciate it for its cinematic meaning as a stand alone, book or not.Augusten Burroughs had a miserable childhood that makes for good screen time for sure.  I wanted to accept so much of this movie as just over-the-top shock value.  I found myself either laughing at the screen or scrunching my eyebrows in amazement.

1043766,A1YRYWY01L9BZ6,B000M5B98A,SORE EYES,"[5, 5]","A famous writer once said that all families are unhappy but no two families share the same unhappiness. Based on the memoir of Augusten Burroughs, Running With Scissors is the story of a dysfunctional family, but a dysfunctional family you've never seen before.Young Augusten (Jack Kaeden) is a chronic school skipper who stays at home to feed his mother Deidre's (Annette Benning) ego. Augusten lovingly puts curlers in Deidre's hair and attentively listens to her poetry readings at the living room microphone. Augusten optimistically assures Deidre that the poem ""really does sound like something you'd read in the New Yorker"".Deidre and Norm Burroughs (Alec Baldwin) are unhappy. They seek the help of a quack-California-psychiatrist who hooks Deidre on the pill du jour of the 70's-valium. Norm moves out. Deidre claims she is happy with the divorce because now she can ""concentrate on her writing"" but spends a good deal of time in bed-on pills and with her psychiatrist. Augusten is left at the psychiatrists home-a cupcake pink monstrosity that beats Grey Gardens on the squalor meter-while Deidre and Doctor Finch (Brian Cox) go to a motel. Mom never really returns to Augusten's life.Seeking love, Augusten is comforted by the amorous attention of a pediophile, Neil Bookman (Joseph Finnes) who is also a patient of Finch. Augusten sometimes returns home for weekend visits to witness the decline of his mother. Augusten is legally adopted by Finch so that Finch can get his hands on the severely addicted Deidre's money.This movie deals with themes that haven't been explored in popular culture, I suspect because the movie paying audience doesn't like to see their flaws so aptly displayed on screen-the selfishness of the baby-boomer generation, psychiatrist abuse, alcoholism, pill addiction (prozac anyone?), flattery and ego, pedophiles. Burroughs does an outstanding job of mixing some very dark stuff with humor. Still you'll cringe when Finch cripples his patients by matchmaking them to other dysfunctional patients and writes them another prescription. In one scene Finch encourages young Augusten to stage a suicide so that he won't have to attend school and presumably not be held accountable for Augusten's chronic ditching. Not only does Finch encourage a relationship between Augusten and Neil Bookman, but he sets his 13 year old daughter up with a violent 41 year old man who breaks her collar bone. Finch extorts $75,000 from the man telling him it is for his daughter's college fund, spending the money as soon as it is in his hands. Your skin will crawl when Finch's patients are reduced to communicating with the limited language and trite emotion of his psychobabble. And you'll shake your head watching Deidre run through one 70's fad after another trying to ""find herself"" and ""tap into her unconscious creative mind"". But you'll love the way these patterns of abuse unfold, like when Deidre begins an interpretive dance while hallucinating it is snowing in her bedroom before a candle wax laden mantle cum buddah shrine. All elements of film work together perfectly in this movie-settings, props, acting. It's wonderful. After seeing this movie you will have no doubt that the self-absorbed, do as you please, divorce is better for kids, free to be you and me mantra was the B.S. of the 1960's and 1970's.Benning shines in her role of tortured and oppressed-only in her own mind-Deidre. I watched this movie twice in a row just to see Benning's facial expressions. Alec Baldwin is entirely sympathetic and wonderful as the Dad trying to do the right thing, even when he hangs up on his son. Jill Clayburgh (Finch's wife) is complicated, abused, and astute all at once. Natalie (Evelyn Rachel Wood) is great as one of Finch's daughters and her part is so well written that even in her very last scene we are still learning that her bravado and indifference is a cover-up for some very deep pain and that her father has some sharp hooks in her. Evelyn Rachel Wood did a great job inThirteenas well and I can't wait to see more of her. Gwenneth is good, but she delivers a little of the same performance that she did inThe Royal Tenenbaums (The Criterion Collection). And you even end up loving Bookman the pediophile because Finnes is so stellar. Cross is so believable as a young Augusten-you can see both his pain and maturity and believe he could raise himself as he is left to do. Cox is great as the creepy Finch. You walk away from this movie thinking that no one else could have played these roles which in my mind means that these actors all deserve accolades.I liked two movies this year-Little Miss Sunshineand Running With Scissors. If Running doesn't receive several academy awards I will have lost all respect for the Academy. I think the movie might fail at the awards because as I explained, the baby-boomer Academy Award voting audience is going experience pain seeing their flaws accurately displayed on screen. Some reviewers have said that this movie is like The Royal Tennebaums. Except for Gwenneth, I found the comparison lacking. Burroughs delivers a mature and poignant humor which was missing in Tennebaums.

First of all, the acting not only of Annette Bening but of Joseph Cross and Jill Clayburgh is first-rate. And surely some of the book's humor and odd charm has been caught. Its deadpan comic style is nicely captured, for instance, in the scene where Cross asks to escape the zoo of the psychiatrist's house and instead to join Bening in her hotel stay because he ""loves the little soaps"" offered there.At the same time, the large-scale but necessary disappearance of the book's ironic narrator with his sharp eye for the ridiculous raises the question of whether the book was ever suitable material for an equally successful movie. What remains in the absence of the narrator is too much lurid or pathetic incident with too little ironic buffering. Like Austen's ""Emma"" which devolves in film versions into a mere period romance or ""The Great Gatsby"" which as a movie is reduced to a crime story about a bootlegger unlucky in love, ""Running With Scissors"" has been deprived of an extraordinarily rich dimension, one supplied by the story's teller and one which the camera can hardly rival.",4,"""Blunted Scissors""",1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1175,"['better', 'film', 'professional', 'newspaper', 'reviews', 'have', 'suggested', 'First', 'all', 'acting', 'not', 'only', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Joseph', 'Cross', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'first-rate', 'surely', 'book', 'humor', 'odd', 'charm', 'been', 'caught', 'deadpan', 'comic', 'style', 'nicely', 'captured', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'Cross', 'escape', 'zoo', 'psychiatrist', 'house', 'instead', 'join', 'Bening', 'hotel', 'stay', 'little', 'soaps', 'offered', 'same', 'time', 'large-scale', 'necessary', 'disappearance', 'book', 'ironic', 'narrator', 'sharp', 'eye', 'ridiculous', 'question', 'book', 'was', 'ever', 'suitable', 'material', 'equally', 'successful', 'movie', 'What', 'absence', 'narrator', 'too', 'much', 'lurid', 'pathetic', 'incident', 'too', 'little', 'ironic', 'buffering', 'Austen', 'Emma', 'film', 'versions', 'mere', 'period', 'romance', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'movie', 'reduced', 'crime', 'story', 'bootlegger', 'unlucky', 'love', 'Running', 'Scissors', 'been', 'deprived', 'extraordinarily', 'rich', 'dimension', 'one', 'supplied', 'story', 'teller', 'one', 'camera', 'can', 'hardly', 'rival']",N/A

How blissfully ignorant they are, and how luxurious their lives must be that they can simply turn a blind eye and turn this ""off"", walk away and go on about their cozy lives.well, what about someone who is forced to LIVE such a life, that you can't even stand to watch for under 2 hours?  what about someone who is born INTO such a life, and is forced to it hour upon hour day after day and YEAR AFTER YEAR?  Such as the life of those like augestene.  well, he did say that no body would believe him.  He's right.was that part about the abused and killed CAT REALLY NECESSARY?  SINCE WHEN DID IT BECOME OK TO ABUSE AND KILL FREAKING ANIMALS IN MOVIES?  Wow Hollywood is really getting away nowadays huh...first wth a drowned dog in Marisa Tomei's Danika, and now a starved, trapped cat in this movie.  And they're rated R?I want to point out Hollywood's betrayal of humanity by calling this movie a ""comedy"" and deeming the two characters to have ""survived it"".  First off there is nothing funny about augestine's life.  Second he does NOT survive it as shown here, except by leaving and admitting the truth of it all (first step), but he comes out GAY.  the second character, the girl who moves to ny with him, comes out to be a SHRINK.  That is not survival, when you dedicate your life and when your life is based on your childhood traumas.  abrupt change of subject:In the beginning of the movie, the incestous relationship between the mother (annette benning) and 5 year old augestene shows to be especially graphic and disgusting.  a scene is actually shown when augestene plays the ""mirror"" for his mother -- his face his face his face is shown -- o my God.  Then it goes on to the climax of this already very rated xxx part of the movie -- Augestene hugs her, at the age of FIVE(!) because SHE wants a hug.I agree that benning plays this disgusting, sick character very ... uhm, well.  But she already does that in ""American Beauty""..so nothing new there.All in all, this movie is enough for any human being to appreciate their lives, if they are NOT in this hell, understand their lives and how far they've come -- if they HAD BEEN in this hell, or become a little more empathic to those who have.  this would include ALL shrinks, gays, and other incapitates.  More on this point -- No one raised in a healthy way turns out gay.  No one raised in a heathy way becomes a shrink.  No one raised in a healthy way will spend thier free time writing such a review (as I'm writing).  No one raised in a healthy way turns out bulimic, anorexic, abusive (gwenth paltrow).  we're all in this movie, which one are you?

The rest is for anyone who enjoys a laugh at the freak-show expense of damaged and damaging characters.Well, not so fast . . . Bening is such an unsympathetic, one-demensional, self-absorbed, manipulative, moron that it is impossible to relate to her on any level, thus leaving us numb to both her character and Bening's acting.  Honestly, any mature actress could have played this part and in the same manner; therefore, I'm not so keen on this notion that Bening gives an ""acclaimed performance"" here.As for the rest of this film, I could not find a single ""laugh at the freak-show of damaged characters.""  There is NO ONE to connect with in this terrible story of self-absorbed and self-destructive characters and that is at the heart of this heartless film.  There is no one to love and/or cheer for.  NOT ONE.  Of this 2 hour and 10 minute film, I felt so drained and disgusted by the end of the first hour that I had to shut it off.Now I know someone is going to say, ""Hey, Steve, you should have given it a chance"" or ""if you would have watched the whole film you would have seen . . .""  Hey, listen, if I have to sit through 1-2 hours of hateful characters that I can't stomach and plot that just difts like dead wood on a calm lake to get to some clever ending or witness a sudden awakening by the major character, then it wasn't worth my attention.  A good ending or a good final third or fourth of a film does not save it or give it any credibility.  But that's just me . . .I have seen my share of dysfunctional family films and they were infinitely better.Little Miss Sunshinecomes to mind.  There are a number of annoying, destructive, and disgusting characters in that film, but there was love too and a storyline that went somewhere and was meaningful.  ""Scissors"" by the end of the first hour went nowhere, had not one character one could relate to or cheer on, and the characters where all so self-absorbed that love was nothing more than a four-letter-word in this film.  This was an abuse to the senses.Sorry, these kinds of films are just not in my taste.

Unfortunately, it was only on for a week at a few screens before closing, and having bought the DVD I can appreciate why.The book is Burrough's account of his childhood when his crazy mother leaves him to be looked after by her even crazier shrink and his family. It's a remarkable achievement as the author manages to make the often alarming events of his upbringing touching and funny.The film, though an accurate (but abridged) reflection of the book, seems to miss out on the fact that it's supposed to be a comedy. This is chiefly because it makes Augusten's mother the focus of the plot, when in the book it's her absence which is the driving force. Annette Bening does a fine portrayal of mental derangement but only captures the flavor of the novel occassionally, in for example, a bizarre poetry-reading she organises for her would-be literary friends.I liked Evan Rachel Wood's performance as Augusten's friend Natalie but she's only given a little screen time, when she should really be a central character. My favorite scenes in the novel - diving through the college waterfall and a trip whale-watching off Cape Cod - involve her but are omitted entirely here.The only time the movie truly flickers into life for me was during the closing credits, when the real-life Augusten Burroughs stands next to the actor playing his young self.

Augusten's mom is mentally ill and eventually signs his custody over to her psychologist. He and his wife live in a mess of a house, with 3 other kids, none of whom are their own, and all of whom are mentally ill. The ironic part to the whole thing is that the doctor who is supposed to help everyone seems to be more ill than anyone else. Joseph Cross is great as Augusten, and Brian Cox is hilarious as Dr. Finch. It seems as thou Cox is in everything, and he always gets those hysterical random lines. Annette Bening however steals the show. The movie was weird, the story is weird, and outside of the funny and psychotic parts, I was kind of bored. This movie wasn't great, Bening however was amazing. It's too bad this movie was so far out there and so far under the radar, because I truly believe she was Oscar worthy in this role.

In fact, the world is full of them!Ultimately, I think I have to give this a five star rating because it really had riveted me for the entire 2-plus hours. I think the acting was quite excellent by all characters: most were convincingly miserable. I can understand some of the comments expressed here about the film being out of balance and having over-the-top despicable characters (and yes, Annette Benning as the mother plays a totally self-absorbed nut case who can't see past her own narcisistic ego needs at the expense of all others), there is something very deep that was being brought out in the film: it has something to do with the basic human need for love and validation by those who are 'supposed to' love us: family, spouse, etc. However, like many dysfunctional families, we as individuals sometimes do not get that validation and all the characters in this film show the pain of that in one form or another.I gotta say, Jill Clayburgh as Agnes reveals a noble character eventually, near the films end that is quite touching and pretty surprising. The film deals with horrific relationship issues that are all shrouded in comedy, yet one can't really laugh without restraint because we know that we are talking about real life here, and the pain these people epitomize is an all too real reality. For the average person, this movie is sure to hit close to home on some level.So, not a feel good movie, although it's not without it's redeeming values. The son and main character, Augusten eventually extricates himself out of his emotional dependence on his mother and breaks her manipulative power over him, thus freeing himself out of his prison. Lots to contemplate here behind the comedy. I think it's a brave piece of storytelling. Some of it sickening, yet it is what life is made of: the predators and the exploited, who in turn become predators. But not all, and perhaps that's the film's most redeeming realization.",5,Wow... not your typical movie entertainment.,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2455,"['just', 'watched', 'film', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'rather', 'stunned', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'say', 'Good', 'bad', 'kinda', 'irrelevant', 'powerful', 'one', 'hand', 'black', 'comedy', 'human', 'relationship', 'dysfunction', 'other', 'vicious', 'parody', 'mental', 'health', 'arena', 'ok', ""'ll"", 'need', 'few', 'more', 'hands', 'here', 'third', 'hand', 'completely', 'insane', 'one', 'scene', 'more', 'insane', 'preceding', 'one', ""'re"", 'talking', 'box', 'lunacy', 'here', 'yet', 'ARE', 'people', 'nuts', 'world', 'fact', 'world', 'full', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'have', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'really', 'had', 'riveted', 'entire', '2-plus', 'hours', 'think', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'excellent', 'characters', 'most', 'were', 'convincingly', 'miserable', 'can', 'understand', 'comments', 'expressed', 'here', 'film', 'being', 'balance', 'having', 'over-the-top', 'despicable', 'characters', 'yes', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'mother', 'totally', 'self-absorbed', 'nut', 'case', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'own', 'narcisistic', 'ego', 'needs', 'expense', 'others', 'something', 'very', 'deep', 'was', 'being', 'brought', 'out', 'film', 'something', 'do', 'basic', 'human', 'need', 'love', 'validation', 'who', 'are', ""'supposed"", 'love', 'family', 'spouse', 'etc', 'However', 'many', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'individuals', 'sometimes', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'validation', 'characters', 'film', 'show', 'pain', 'one', 'form', 'another.I', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'Agnes', 'noble', 'character', 'eventually', 'films', 'end', 'quite', 'touching', 'pretty', 'surprising', 'film', 'deals', 'horrific', 'relationship', 'issues', 'are', 'shrouded', 'comedy', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'laugh', 'restraint', 'know', 'are', 'talking', 'real', 'life', 'here', 'pain', 'people', 'epitomize', 'too', 'real', 'reality', 'average', 'person', 'movie', 'sure', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'level.So', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'redeeming', 'values', 'son', 'main', 'character', 'Augusten', 'eventually', 'emotional', 'dependence', 'mother', 'manipulative', 'power', 'thus', 'freeing', 'prison', 'Lots', 'contemplate', 'here', 'comedy', 'think', 'brave', 'piece', 'storytelling', 'sickening', 'what', 'life', 'made', 'predators', 'exploited', 'who', 'turn', 'become', 'predators', 'not', 'perhaps', 'film', 'most', 'redeeming', 'realization']",N/A

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[2, 2]","I initially discovered Augsten Burroughs engrossing personal story a around this time last year when I discovered that one of my favorite television producers (Ryan Murphy, of `nip/tuck' and `popular' fame) was directing a feature film based on his debut novel, ""Running with Scissors.""  With the recommendation from Murphy as well as the comically entertaining cover the book, I broke down and purchased the book.It is an understatement calling the novel an engrossing masterpiece!  Very rarely do I find a novel that I literally cannot put down and read from cover to cover in the course of 14 hours, but `Running with Scissors' is one such book.  Obviously I was desperately looking forward to the feature-film release, and with the early critical praise, and the Oscar talk I was getting excited.  But imagine my disappointment when the movie finally arrived but it failed to convey the tone of the book.The movie follows the story closely (or as closely as 300 pages can be turned into 2 hours), but the charm, humor, and emotion get lost somewhere along the way.  I found myself watching the film and not laughing at a single moment, or even caring what about what the characters were feeling.  The story is heavily character driven, and without them it's just a snooze fest - which is exactly the best way to describe the film.  It seems like Murphy tried to convey the `zaniness' that made up the charm of the novel, but through several flat performances (although I must say Evan Rachel Wood and Annette Benning deserve every accolade they get) and very bad editing, this doesn't come across the screen.Do yourself a favor and read the book.

However, what I observed, were really great actors in cardboard roles.  I read about Burroughs' legal problems with the real family ""Scissors"" is based upon, in a Vanity Fair article.  No way could all of this be real.  To say he exaggerated has to be an understatement.  Obviously, his mother was either bipolar or a borderline personality, or a combination of both.  Her narcissism and self-absorption took dysfunction to new heights.  Even humor is mean-spirited, such as the wisecrack about looking like ""someone with Down's syndrome.""There is ZILCH human tenderness or depth in this movie (perhaps nor the book).  The only character who remotely comes close to humanity is Jill Clayburgh's victimized mother role, and here, she is reviled as a dog food-eating imbecile, incapable of standing up to her egomaniacal, insane psychiatrist husband.  Hollywood and the gay culture often revere aesthetic qualities, like beauty, sophistication and creativity.  In this movie, those qualities supercede more meaningful traits, such as decency and responsibility.Clayburgh's character attempts to be maternal, but this is subject to ridicule.  She prepares ""Hamburger Helper,"" and Augusten the troubled teenager eats it.  What is the underlying message of contempt?  That Middle Class America eats Hamburger Helper from our trough, while the two coasts, particularly L.A., dine on caviar, and that we, ordinary citizens, should kiss the ground for these pearl of wisdoms our entertainment industry tosses to us?Clayburgh removes the psychiatrist's stool from the toilet, as further proof of her absolute ""dog-like"" mentality.  Yet, it is Clayburgh's character who tries to reassure the Burroughs character in the end, at the bus stop.  So, he couldn't admire her for her kindness, because she scooped up `crap,' and ate dog food.  She was ugly.  He couldn't see that in this nutcracker suite of psychiatric case studies, that her (Clayburgh's) qualities were the only human ones.I wonder what Burroughs relationship was like with the ""real mom"" who tried to foster him.  Perhaps he aligned himself more closely with his narcissistic biological mother, while admitting she was a monster, at least she was `beautiful' and artistic.  Also, she projected `strength' because she screamed and acted like a diva.  Comparatively, the Jill Clayburgh character was just a homely, timid mom.In a voiceover, the Burroughs teen confesses a longing for `rules' and curfews.  What he really craves, is that someone cares about him enough to restrict him.  His mother is indifferent to his needs, she doesn't even care that he's being seduced by an unstable schizophrenic.  She's grateful and relieved, because it means she doesn't have to assume responsibility for her own son.  And she can only relate to Augusten in how he cares for her.I find it sickening that the only glimmer of decency in this entire torturous, cartoon-like film... was still subject to haughty, snotty ridicule.  (Thanks, ""Nip/Tuck"" director!)  The Clayburgh mom was the only adult who did not abandon this child, (Burroughs), or wasn't so totally blinded by her own needs, but thought of others... (think of how she was in the car/rain scene, pleading with Annette Bening's character to leave her husband alone, and to let her ""keep Augusten,"" because he was a part of the family.  Instead, Clayburgh was depicted as a dog food eating idiot who let her children dismiss her in a cruel and snide manner.  Even in the end, she simpers, saying she'll get rid of the Christmas tree.  Hats off to Jill Clayburgh, for shining her light through the homely appearance the film / book demanded of her... yet still being the only ray of hope.This is a bleak, profoundly cynical film, with exaggerations so outrageous that one questions their credibility and truth.  Even the humor and attempts to be clever can't save it... the insults, put-downs, and toilet references.Thanks though, for the reminder of how precious a healthy family really is, especially toward the creation of productive people who don't have to wallow in therapy for years, treat others cruelly or make excuses for their train wreck lives.  Also, the film is a warning.  It's dangerous it is to put psychology professionals or Hollywood on a pedestal.  Often, they are more crazy than us - and certainly, a lot more pretentious.In the end, I don't care how clever, rich or attractive you are.  I want to know if you have a soul.",1,"Bleak, Cynical, Tasteless...
