The film won the Discovery Award from the Toronto Film Festival.  The story is quite gripping & brings you into the lives, hopes and disappointments of the characters.  Blond Espen Klouman-Hoiner plays Erik whose novel is at first not successful.  His good looks, nervous energy, flashing a smile that quickly fades make for an edgy performance.  His best friend is Phillip.  Played well by Anders Danielsen Lie, they send off their novels on the same day.  As Phillip, Lie experiences initial success & then sinks into depression, writers block and pursues an existentialist questioning on the value of life.  After being institutionalized, he loses his desire to write.  Meanwhile, Erik rewrites and resubmits his book to great acclaim.  Both men idolize established reclusive writer Sten Egil Dahl played by the taciturn Sigmund Severud.  Erik connects with him and is affected by his idol's suicide.  At first, I wondered if the pals were more than friends.  They hang out with their buddies such as the egoistic Lars played by Christian Rubeck and the earthy Geir played by Pal Stokka.  Then we see that Phillip has had an obsessive romance with the lovely Kari played by Viktoria Winge.  This leads him to an apparent suicide attempt and close scrutiny by Erik and Phillip's mother.  Erik meanwhile has a superficial relationship with Lillian that he can't find a way to break off.  Silje Hagen plays Lillian, who eventually boots Erik, much to his puzzlement & relief.  Both men seem to find their way through life, not overly happy, but with enough satisfaction in accomplishment.  This is a special story with emotional depth and strong performances from fresh faces.

They both submit a book, hoping for publication. Phillip's book becomes an immediate smash, while Erik's is rejected. Phillip meets the girl of his dreams, but then things go awry, big time. He is eventually committed to a hospital ward. Meanwhile Erik keeps struggling to get his next book published. There are many additional sub-plots that I'm skipping, but I don't want to give away much further of the plot, you'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out. The movie focuses on love, friendship, professional and emotional struggles, and it plays out beautifully.In all, even when watching this for the second time, I was entertained, entralled by the performances and the overall direction of the movie.

1166150,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001AIRUOK,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 6]","The Norwegian drama, ""Reprise,"" is the first feature-length work by Danish-born director Joachim Trier - a premier effort that bodes great things for his future as a filmmaker.  He is clearly alive to the possibilities of the medium, as reflected in the original, highly idiosyncratic style he brings to the film.  Trier deftly employs many of the tools of the filmmaker's trade - narration, flashbacks, flash forwards, near-subliminal quick cuts to show imagined events, etc. - to convey his story.  Yet, rare for a newcomer, Trier never indulges in any of these ""tricks"" for their own sweet sake or to call attention to his own ingenuity; they are always placed at the service of the material, never the other way around..Best friends from childhood, Erik and Phillip share the hope of one day becoming writers whose works will go beyond the merely commercial to challenge the status quo - thereby earning them the coveted status of ""cult"" authors.  As it turns out, Phillip's novel is published, but Erik's is not, yet Phillip winds up paying a price for his success, namely an emotional breakdown that has Erik performing a near-round-the-clock suicide-prevention watch on his friend.  Meanwhile, Erik continues on with his writing, experiencing success and disappointment - both professional and personal - along the way.Erik and Phillip are both extremely complex characters, and Trier provides no penny-ante analysis to make them more easily understandable for the audience.  Sometimes it's hard to tell what exactly it is that is bothering the two, except that, in Philip's case at least, it might be actual mental illness that lies at the root of his problem.  Like many creative types, Erik and Phillip seem incapable of not over-analyzing and over-intellectualizing every single aspect of their lives, often resulting in a chronic dissatisfaction with themselves and the world around them.  As writers, they become obsessed with trying to convey every single nuance of life through language, and when they fail at that endeavor - as they inevitably do - the only viable option left for them seems to be either depression or madness.  As a consequence of all this, their relationships with women don't work out - and even their own longtime friendship threatens to come apart at the seams the deeper they go into brutal self-awareness.As Erik and Phillip, Espen Klouman-Hoiner and Anders Danielsen Lie give supple, sensitive performances, as does Viktoria Winge as Phillip's on-again/off-again love interest.  The screenplay is rich in texture and sophisticated in theme, while the filmmaking itself sparkles with bold creativity and unfettered imagination.As touching as it is thought-provoking, ""Reprise"" is a remarkably accomplished and assured piece of filmmaking - especially coming from a first timer.",4,a most impressive directorial debut,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,2817,"['Norwegian', 'drama', 'Reprise', 'first', 'feature-length', 'work', 'Danish-born', 'director', 'Joachim', 'Trier', 'premier', 'effort', 'great', 'things', 'future', 'filmmaker', 'clearly', 'alive', 'possibilities', 'medium', 'reflected', 'original', 'highly', 'idiosyncratic', 'style', 'film', 'Trier', 'deftly', 'many', 'tools', 'filmmaker', 'trade', 'narration', 'flashbacks', 'flash', 'forwards', 'near-subliminal', 'quick', 'cuts', 'show', 'imagined', 'events', 'etc', 'convey', 'story', 'rare', 'newcomer', 'Trier', 'never', 'tricks', 'own', 'sweet', 'sake', 'call', 'attention', 'own', 'ingenuity', 'are', 'always', 'placed', 'service', 'material', 'never', 'other', 'way', 'around..Best', 'friends', 'childhood', 'Erik', 'Phillip', 'share', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'becoming', 'writers', 'works', 'will', 'go', 'merely', 'commercial', 'challenge', 'status', 'quo', 'thereby', 'earning', 'coveted', 'status', 'cult', 'authors', 'out', 'Phillip', 'novel', 'published', 'Erik', 'not', 'yet', 'Phillip', 'up', 'paying', 'price', 'success', 'namely', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'Erik', 'performing', 'near-round-the-clock', 'suicide-prevention', 'watch', 'friend', 'Meanwhile', 'Erik', 'writing', 'experiencing', 'success', 'disappointment', 'professional', 'personal', 'way.Erik', 'Phillip', 'are', 'extremely', 'complex', 'characters', 'Trier', 'penny-ante', 'analysis', 'make', 'more', 'easily', 'understandable', 'audience', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'exactly', 'bothering', 'two', 'Philip', 'case', 'least', 'might', 'be', 'actual', 'mental', 'illness', 'root', 'problem', 'many', 'creative', 'types', 'Erik', 'Phillip', 'seem', 'incapable', 'not', 'over-analyzing', 'over-intellectualizing', 'single', 'aspect', 'lives', 'often', 'resulting', 'chronic', 'dissatisfaction', 'world', 'writers', 'become', 'obsessed', 'trying', 'convey', 'single', 'nuance', 'life', 'language', 'when', 'fail', 'endeavor', 'inevitably', 'do', 'only', 'viable', 'option', 'left', 'be', 'depression', 'madness', 'consequence', 'relationships', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'even', 'own', 'longtime', 'friendship', 'come', 'apart', 'seams', 'deeper', 'go', 'brutal', 'self-awareness.As', 'Erik', 'Phillip', 'Espen', 'Klouman-Hoiner', 'Anders', 'Danielsen', 'Lie', 'give', 'supple', 'sensitive', 'performances', 'Viktoria', 'Winge', 'Phillip', 'on-again/off-again', 'love', 'interest', 'screenplay', 'rich', 'texture', 'sophisticated', 'theme', 'filmmaking', 'sparkles', 'bold', 'creativity', 'unfettered', 'imagination.As', 'touching', 'thought-provoking', 'Reprise', 'remarkably', 'accomplished', 'assured', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'especially', 'coming', 'first', 'timer']",Reprise

They send their first novel out on the same day. Only Phillip's is published. Then Phillip meets Kari and his art seems like shallow inspiration compared to his passion for his girlfriend. For reasons which aren't made clear in the film, (a head injury from a car accident, passion, the pressure of fame?) Phillip has a nervous breakdown and enters a mental institution.When Phillip leaves the mental institution, Erik gets his book published while keeping a careful eye on Phillip. Phillip realizes he isn't the artist he thought he was. He has no desire to write and feels that his first success was a good regurgatation of a writer hero he and Erik both admire. He hints that he believes Erik's novel may be the same. Erik isn't willing to accept this and decides to leave behind the negative influences on his life in Oslo. Phillip reenters the mental institution-probably for good. Phillip is destroyed by the fact that his dreams were disappointing and Erik embarks on another course-reaffirming his life ambition by continuing to write.Gorgeously filmed, good acting and a stimulating script.
