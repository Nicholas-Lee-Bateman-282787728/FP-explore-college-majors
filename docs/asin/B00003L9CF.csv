A very realistic experience, with attention paid to the tiniest details and legalities - this isn't your average brainless Tarantino flick where undercover cops go around happily shooting anyone they want whenever they feel like it; this feels almost *real*! I doubt if the movie was actually based on a true story of an undercover policeman (unless the &quot;story&quot; is the obvious fact that thousands of policemen risk their lives every month working undercover all over the world), but if anything like it ever happened, you can safely bet that it happened exactly the way the movie tells it. Highly recommended, especially for anyone interested in true crime.

545564,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003L9CF,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","Those looking for a rousing shoot-em-up action picture will probably be disappointed by `In Too Deep.' Those looking for a more low-keyed, subdued  and thoughtful study of the realities of life as an undercover cop will,  however, find much in this film to admire and appreciate. Omar Epps stars  as a Cincinnati-based rookie cop, Officer Jeff Cole, who goes undercover to  nab a major cocaine dealer from New Jersey who calls himself `God,' (played  by rapper LL Cool J) and who, Godfather-like, involves himself heavily in  familial values and efforts to `help' the struggling members of his  blighted neighborhood. In its exploration of its subject, the film wisely  eschews the over-the-top fantasy heroics that afflict so many action films  and, instead, tethers itself to the harsh, often ugly realities of the  dangerous criminal world in which it is set. The movie builds much of its  drama and suspense by bringing to the foreground the fascinating logistics  that go into undercover police work, forcing us to witness first hand the  risks, the moral compromises (to be convincing, Cole has to snort cocaine  himself, for example) and the psychological ambiguities that invariably  accompany the job.Cole is a man who has been obsessed from the early  days of his underprivileged, slum-ridden childhood with making a difference  in a crime-infested world he knows all too well from first hand experience.  This makes him a natural choice for infiltrating this underworld existence  since his background has given him the understanding he needs as a  point-of-entry. Thus, as he embarks on this new and dangerous career, we  see the innate compassion he extends to those caught in the same  environment from which he has sprung, an empathy that, in the context of  his job, often leads him into a `softness' that clouds his judgment and  ends up endangering his life further. In addition, as he is accepted more  deeply into the inner circle of trust that God has set up around himself,  Cole begins to question his own loyalties - or so, at least, the offers in  charge of him begin to believe. (This, I imagine, is the undercover agent  version of the Stockholm Syndrome that afflicts so many kidnap victims,  often leading them to transfer their loyalties from their rescuers to their  abductors).The screenplay, though it could be sharper and more incisive  at times, occasionally achieves substance in its examination of just what  happens to an undercover agent's mind when he does indeed get `in too  deep.' In addition, the film frequently achieves moments of genuine  suspense, in truly scary scenes involving God's uncontrolled displays of  manic violence and torture and in moments when Cole's entire cover seems to  have been `blown.' In those moments, LL Cool J hits all the right notes in  his performance but, both he and Epps, unfortunately, lack the dramatic and  emotional range as actors necessary to make their quieter, more intimate  moments effectively credible. In addition, the dialogue often rings untrue,  especially in the conversations among the commanding officers played by  Stanley Tucci and, in another weak portrayal, Pam Grier among  others.With better performances, harder-edged dialogue and slightly more  energetic direction, `In Too Deep' might have been a great study of moral  conflict set within the context of an exciting policier. On the other hand,  the film could also have been much worse. As it is, `In Too Deep' respects  the seriousness of both its subject matter and its audience and provides a  number of powerful scenes - factors for which we are grateful but which  also make us yearn for the high quality film that might have been.",3,imperfect but interesting police film,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,3694,"['looking', 'rousing', 'shoot-em-up', 'action', 'picture', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Too', 'Deep', 'looking', 'more', 'low-keyed', 'subdued', 'thoughtful', 'study', 'realities', 'life', 'undercover', 'cop', 'will', 'however', 'find', 'much', 'film', 'admire', 'appreciate', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Cincinnati-based', 'rookie', 'cop', 'Officer', 'Jeff', 'Cole', 'who', 'undercover', 'nab', 'major', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'New', 'Jersey', 'who', 'God', 'played', 'rapper', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'who', 'Godfather-like', 'heavily', 'familial', 'values', 'efforts', 'help', 'struggling', 'members', 'blighted', 'neighborhood', 'exploration', 'subject', 'film', 'wisely', 'over-the-top', 'fantasy', 'heroics', 'afflict', 'so', 'many', 'action', 'films', 'instead', 'tethers', 'harsh', 'often', 'ugly', 'realities', 'dangerous', 'criminal', 'world', 'set', 'movie', 'much', 'drama', 'suspense', 'bringing', 'foreground', 'fascinating', 'logistics', 'go', 'undercover', 'police', 'work', 'forcing', 'witness', 'first', 'hand', 'risks', 'moral', 'compromises', 'be', 'convincing', 'Cole', 'snort', 'cocaine', 'example', 'psychological', 'ambiguities', 'invariably', 'accompany', 'job.Cole', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'obsessed', 'early', 'days', 'underprivileged', 'slum-ridden', 'childhood', 'making', 'difference', 'crime-infested', 'world', 'too', 'well', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'natural', 'choice', 'infiltrating', 'underworld', 'existence', 'background', 'given', 'understanding', 'point-of-entry', 'Thus', 'new', 'dangerous', 'career', 'see', 'innate', 'compassion', 'caught', 'same', 'environment', 'sprung', 'empathy', 'context', 'job', 'often', 'softness', 'judgment', 'up', 'endangering', 'life', 'further', 'addition', 'accepted', 'more', 'deeply', 'inner', 'circle', 'trust', 'God', 'set', 'up', 'Cole', 'question', 'own', 'loyalties', 'so', 'least', 'offers', 'charge', 'begin', 'believe', 'imagine', 'undercover', 'agent', 'version', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'so', 'many', 'kidnap', 'victims', 'often', 'leading', 'transfer', 'loyalties', 'rescuers', 'abductors', '.The', 'screenplay', 'could', 'be', 'sharper', 'more', 'incisive', 'times', 'occasionally', 'substance', 'examination', 'just', 'what', 'undercover', 'agent', 'mind', 'when', 'indeed', 'get', 'too', 'deep', 'addition', 'film', 'frequently', 'moments', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'truly', 'scary', 'scenes', 'involving', 'God', 'uncontrolled', 'displays', 'manic', 'violence', 'torture', 'moments', 'when', 'Cole', 'entire', 'cover', 'have', 'been', 'blown', 'moments', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'right', 'notes', 'performance', 'Epps', 'unfortunately', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'range', 'actors', 'necessary', 'make', 'quieter', 'more', 'intimate', 'moments', 'effectively', 'credible', 'addition', 'dialogue', 'often', 'untrue', 'especially', 'conversations', 'commanding', 'officers', 'played', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'weak', 'portrayal', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'others.With', 'better', 'performances', 'harder-edged', 'dialogue', 'slightly', 'more', 'energetic', 'direction', 'Too', 'Deep', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'study', 'moral', 'conflict', 'set', 'context', 'exciting', 'policier', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'Too', 'Deep', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'matter', 'audience', 'number', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'factors', 'are', 'grateful', 'also', 'make', 'yearn', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been']",In Too Deep VHS

545568,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00003L9CF,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","Action is a genre that is known for being way out there in terms of realism, with ridiculous special effects, shotty dialouge, and bad acting. Seldom is an action movie really focused on the story, instead it's always about the man who can do the impossible. In Too Deep was different though because it was based on a true story and there really weren't any expensive special effects. In this film, Omar Epps plays a rookie, undercover cop, whose first small assignment actually leads him into the number one crime syndicate in all of Cincinnati. The inexperienced cop uses his urban upbringing and street smarts to get him to the top, where he really has to decide which side he wants to be on. In Too Deep featured a great, real life story, that was on the level, I really enjoyed this film. On top of that Epps and LL Cool J were terrific opposing each other and giving strong performances. What I didn't care for was the blatant racism from Director Michael Rymer. Everything was very well done, but it is very obvious that the Writer/Director of this film was white, while the majority of the cast was black. What I witnessed was a film where all the people in charge were white, all the thugs were black, but it didn't end there. The white people spoke eloquently, while even the black officers and other non-affiliated cast members all spoke street. Every person from the rookie cops aging father to the man who ran the convenience store were dropping F bombs left and right, adding man to every other word, and constantly saying the N word. I understand the point of this movie was to be real, but part of that realism was that this gang had never been infiltrated because of how smart they were. Instead of being portrayed as smooth and savvy, the leaders of the gang were portrayed as ignorant thugs and that really takes away from the film.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,1851,"['Action', 'genre', 'known', 'being', 'way', 'there', 'terms', 'realism', 'ridiculous', 'special', 'effects', 'shotty', 'dialouge', 'bad', 'acting', 'Seldom', 'action', 'movie', 'really', 'focused', 'story', 'instead', 'always', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'impossible', 'Too', 'Deep', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'rookie', 'undercover', 'cop', 'first', 'small', 'assignment', 'actually', 'number', 'one', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'Cincinnati', 'inexperienced', 'cop', 'urban', 'upbringing', 'street', 'smarts', 'get', 'top', 'where', 'really', 'decide', 'side', 'be', 'Too', 'Deep', 'featured', 'great', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'was', 'level', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'top', 'Epps', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'were', 'terrific', 'opposing', 'other', 'giving', 'strong', 'performances', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'blatant', 'racism', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Rymer', 'Everything', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'obvious', 'Writer/Director', 'film', 'was', 'white', 'majority', 'cast', 'was', 'black', 'What', 'witnessed', 'was', 'film', 'where', 'people', 'charge', 'were', 'white', 'thugs', 'were', 'black', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'white', 'people', 'spoke', 'eloquently', 'even', 'black', 'officers', 'other', 'non-affiliated', 'cast', 'members', 'spoke', 'street', 'person', 'rookie', 'aging', 'father', 'man', 'who', 'ran', 'convenience', 'store', 'were', 'dropping', 'F', 'bombs', 'left', 'right', 'adding', 'man', 'other', 'word', 'constantly', 'saying', 'N', 'word', 'understand', 'point', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'real', 'part', 'realism', 'was', 'gang', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'infiltrated', 'how', 'smart', 'were', 'Instead', 'being', 'portrayed', 'smooth', 'savvy', 'leaders', 'gang', 'were', 'portrayed', 'ignorant', 'thugs', 'really', 'away', 'film']",In Too Deep VHS
