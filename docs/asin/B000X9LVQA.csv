All of his videos and game reviews are so poorly made that he tries to make a decent easy or challenging games look horrible stupid and unfair (but who is he kidding?) he also can't get most of his facts straight, his humor is very stale unfunny which he has to add a whole bunch of pointless special green screen effects to try to make his videos look funny but their not and he's a real bad imitation of the most popular internet show AVGN (AKA the angry video game nerd).Thats the reason why I have heard of the irate gamer is because im a big fan of the AVGN and james rolfes videos, I watch all of his stuff on you tube and he gives us a great trip down to  the greatist nostalgiac memory lane and he is so hilarious and smart at what he does, but chris bores is just the opposite of all these things and I don't know why some people love and support this hack.You want great internet actors and real gamers? check out on Youtube:1 The angry video game nerd2 The nostalgia critic (movie reviewer)3 Wiiviewer4 retrogamer35 classic game roomAnd avoid the irate gamer!James rolfe rules!

If you really like him, then go on his youtube channel and watch all these videos for free.  Why would anyone waste their hard earned money on this crap.

It's pathetic that on this DVD, the review of TMNT that lifted direct quotes from the AVGN's review that was released a few months prior to the Irate Gamers have mysteriously been removed. Just like the ""No comments allowed"" option has been switched on to every Irate Gamer video upload on youtube.Irate Gamer has the knowledge and creativity to make a decent video, well, when it comes to video effects that is, but when it comes to originality and humor, copying someone else and claiming you have never heard of them when confronted about it is what kills any potential you had at being a success story.The other thing about this DVD, is it should have already been banned from the market and Irate Gamer should have been sued for copyright infringement. At least the AVGN explained that in his review of Back To The Future (NES) he applied to get copyright permission to use the short clips from the actual movie, but was not granted the OK, so they where removed from his DVD release. However, Irate Gamer, in ...what a coincidence... his back to the future video that contains clips from the movies, amongst other reviews that included clips from movies, have not been removed. And there is no copyright OK from any of the clips he used from any of the companies that own the rights to those movies.So, buy it if you really must, but beware you are receiving a bad imitation of somebody else, useless bonus features, and copyright infringing material.",1,He's not gonna take you back to the past,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,1620,"['Irate', 'gamer', 'simply', 'rip-off', 'angry', 'video-game', 'nerd', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'looking', 'other', 'reviews', 'yet', 'probably', 'review', 'here', 'already', 'said', 'pathetic', 'DVD', 'review', 'TMNT', 'lifted', 'direct', 'quotes', 'AVGN', 'review', 'was', 'released', 'few', 'months', 'prior', 'Irate', 'Gamers', 'have', 'mysteriously', 'been', 'removed', 'Just', 'No', 'comments', 'allowed', 'option', 'been', 'switched', 'Irate', 'Gamer', 'video', 'upload', 'youtube.Irate', 'Gamer', 'knowledge', 'creativity', 'make', 'decent', 'video', 'well', 'when', 'video', 'effects', 'when', 'originality', 'humor', 'copying', 'someone', 'else', 'claiming', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'when', 'confronted', 'what', 'potential', 'had', 'being', 'success', 'story.The', 'other', 'thing', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'banned', 'market', 'Irate', 'Gamer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'sued', 'copyright', 'infringement', 'least', 'AVGN', 'explained', 'review', 'Back', 'Future', 'NES', 'applied', 'get', 'copyright', 'permission', 'use', 'short', 'clips', 'actual', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'granted', 'OK', 'where', 'removed', 'DVD', 'release', 'However', 'Irate', 'Gamer', 'what', 'coincidence', 'back', 'future', 'video', 'clips', 'movies', 'other', 'reviews', 'included', 'clips', 'movies', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'removed', 'copyright', 'OK', 'clips', 'used', 'companies', 'own', 'rights', 'movies.So', 'buy', 'really', 'must', 'are', 'receiving', 'bad', 'imitation', 'somebody', 'else', 'useless', 'bonus', 'features', 'copyright', 'infringing', 'material']",The
