Fairbanks""","[9, 12]","Made on a shoestring in Europe, this filmization of Richard Wright's literary classic has little to recommend it in the way of production  values, yet it is of definite interest due to the casting of Wright himself  in the lead role of Bigger Thomas.  Already middle-aged at the time, Wright  is a good twenty years too old for the part and his skills as an actor fall  dramatically short of his talents as a writer.  Nonetheless, I can think of  no other &quot;serious&quot; author who has appeared on-screen in a film  version of one of his novels (Norman Mailer, of course, directed a movie  based on his &quot;Tough Guys Don't Dance&quot;), and for that reason, this  otherwise amateurish version of &quot;Native Son&quot; ranks as a curio.  Admirers of the writer and his novel are not likely to be impressed by what  they see here but, approached as a novelty, this film is worth a look.",2,"Amateurish, but of definite interest",927590400,"05 25, 1999",1999,893,"['Made', 'shoestring', 'Europe', 'filmization', 'Richard', 'Wright', 'literary', 'classic', 'little', 'recommend', 'way', 'production', 'values', 'definite', 'interest', 'due', 'casting', 'Wright', 'lead', 'role', 'Bigger', 'Thomas', 'Already', 'middle-aged', 'time', 'Wright', 'good', 'twenty', 'years', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'skills', 'actor', 'fall', 'dramatically', 'short', 'talents', 'writer', 'Nonetheless', 'can', 'think', 'other', 'quot', 'serious', 'quot', 'author', 'who', 'appeared', 'on-screen', 'film', 'version', 'one', 'novels', 'Norman', 'Mailer', 'course', 'directed', 'movie', 'based', 'quot', 'Tough', 'Guys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Dance', 'quot', 'reason', 'otherwise', 'amateurish', 'version', 'quot', 'Native', 'Son', 'quot', 'ranks', 'curio', 'Admirers', 'writer', 'novel', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'impressed', 'what', 'see', 'here', 'approached', 'novelty', 'film', 'look']",Native Son VHS

But when I see a movie with production values as lousy as ""Native Son,"" I can understand why it's so bad. Low money, bad actors, a marginal script, worst director ever, and still having to secure shooting locations outside America because of the adapted novel writer's communist attachments. However, as bad as this movie is, I'd still watch this than suffer through a cinematic mistake about talking rat dogs.A lot of the movie is wholly different from the book, probably for aesthetic reasons. For instance, when you only have enough dough for 90 minutes or so of storytelling, it's smart to zip through throwaway sections of book, like Bigger Thomas' arguments with his sister or scenes of him reading the newspaper all the time.Several things are changed or missing from the book and none of it matters because it's still a whole, meaningful and sensible story despite its many shortcomings. The movie is just so badly acted though, it's sometimes laughable. Wright is not Bigger Thomas, he's a totally different guy from the screwed up hood in the novel. He's a nice person who is clearly trying to act tough and not doing it believably even for two seconds. And somebody should have taught him how to run like a man before this movie was made.Gosh what a bad film. But it's better than anything I ever shot, so whatever.",3,hmmm....,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,1517,"['Sometimes', 'someone', 'together', 'piece', 'expensive', 'garbage', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Chihuahua', 'might', 'think', 'yourself', 'money', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'used', 'better', 'purpose', 'elsewhere', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'as', 'lousy', 'Native', 'Son', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'bad', 'Low', 'money', 'bad', 'actors', 'marginal', 'script', 'worst', 'director', 'ever', 'still', 'having', 'secure', 'shooting', 'locations', 'America', 'adapted', 'novel', 'writer', 'communist', 'attachments', 'However', 'as', 'bad', 'movie', ""'d"", 'still', 'watch', 'suffer', 'cinematic', 'mistake', 'talking', 'rat', 'dogs.A', 'lot', 'movie', 'wholly', 'different', 'book', 'probably', 'aesthetic', 'reasons', 'instance', 'when', 'only', 'have', 'enough', 'dough', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'storytelling', 'smart', 'zip', 'throwaway', 'sections', 'book', 'Bigger', 'Thomas', 'arguments', 'sister', 'scenes', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'time.Several', 'things', 'are', 'changed', 'missing', 'book', 'none', 'still', 'whole', 'meaningful', 'sensible', 'story', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'badly', 'acted', 'sometimes', 'laughable', 'Wright', 'not', 'Bigger', 'Thomas', 'totally', 'different', 'guy', 'screwed', 'up', 'hood', 'novel', 'nice', 'person', 'who', 'clearly', 'trying', 'act', 'tough', 'not', 'doing', 'believably', 'even', 'two', 'seconds', 'somebody', 'should', 'have', 'taught', 'how', 'run', 'man', 'movie', 'was', 'made.Gosh', 'what', 'bad', 'film', 'better', 'anything', 'ever', 'shot', 'so', 'whatever']",Native Son VHS
