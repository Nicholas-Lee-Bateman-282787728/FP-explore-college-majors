Some witty dialogue, and the teens felt like real teenagers in high school, but some of the plot stuff seemed pretty generic. Still, in lesser hands this could have been awful, with the kids coming off and whiners and spoiled brats. Instead they seemed like individuals with real problems (at least with problems that seem real to them). I just could have lived without some of the cliched student-vs-authority plotlines.

Nothing even remotely interesting or humorous about the storyline ever really came. A teenage boy pretends to be a counselor of some sorts by distributing drugs in a school bathroom. In addition to that, other classmates would frequently visit him and ask for guidance.Charlie Bartlett started off as someone everyone at his school disliked, but eventually he found an ability to win over most of his school mates.  The transition from someone who wasn't liked at all to someone EVERYONE liked never really clicked or made sense from a storyline point of view, unless I missed something very very obvious.  It's hard to miss something obvious about a storyline laid out in such an easy to follow way, so yeah... I don't get it.I never really found anything particularly interesting about this storyline, nor any of the characters (such as Charlie Bartlett himself, his mother, or the guy who portrayed the bully in the beginning). I just don't get the appeal. What *is* the appeal?  Was I supposed to be laughing, treating it as a drama, WHAT exactly?

1155804,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00175VSBC,Brian E. Erland,"[7, 11]","The '08 release `Charlie Bartlett' is one of those all too prevalent ""teenagers know everything, adults don't have a clue"" films, so if you choose to sit down and watch understand that you've made a conscious choice to substitute substance and reality for an hour or so in search of a little mindless entertainment. Now with the chosen parameters stated the obvious question is does this film deliver the entertainment value you're anticipating? For me the answer is yes.Anton Yelchin is terrific in the part of Charlie Bartlett, troubled rich kid at a new high school looking for popularity. The film is clearly cut from the mold of the ever popular `Ferris Bueller's Day Off' and Anton is every bit as smooth and disarming as Matthew Broderick was in the '86 classic. Like `Ferris Bueller', Charlie soon becomes the undisputed God of the school to the consternation of `Power That Be', especially Principal Gardner (Robert Downey Jr.) who has to deal with the irrepressible Charlie on and off campus when he starts dating his daughter Susan (Kat Dennings).The cast is excellent, the music invigorating and the storyline consistently entertaining from beginning to end. If you're in the mood for an updated re-visioning of `Ferris Bueller's Day Off' with a somewhat darker, edgier atmosphere in keeping with the times you'll enjoy `Charlie Bartlett'.",4,"""I'll See You In The Sequel!"" ~ Ferris Bueller 2008",1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,1351,"['release', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'one', 'too', 'prevalent', 'teenagers', 'know', 'everything', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'films', 'so', 'choose', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'made', 'conscious', 'choice', 'substitute', 'substance', 'reality', 'hour', 'so', 'search', 'little', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'Now', 'chosen', 'parameters', 'stated', 'obvious', 'question', 'film', 'deliver', 'entertainment', 'value', ""'re"", 'anticipating', 'answer', 'yes.Anton', 'Yelchin', 'terrific', 'part', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'troubled', 'rich', 'kid', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'looking', 'popularity', 'film', 'clearly', 'cut', 'mold', 'ever', 'popular', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Anton', 'bit', 'smooth', 'disarming', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'was', ""'86"", 'classic', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Charlie', 'soon', 'undisputed', 'God', 'school', 'consternation', 'Power', 'Be', 'especially', 'Principal', 'Gardner', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'deal', 'irrepressible', 'Charlie', 'off', 'campus', 'when', 'dating', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Kat', 'Dennings', '.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'music', 'invigorating', 'storyline', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', ""'re"", 'mood', 'updated', 're-visioning', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'edgier', 'atmosphere', 'keeping', 'times', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett']",N/A

Richard Downey Jr. does a wonderful job as a principal and father. I don't recall laughing this much at the truth in years. It is refreshing to see movies like this brooch difficult problems that students really have and with a twist that may seem to crazy to believe. I wouldn't put it past the fact this may be based on a true story. Charlie is having trouble staying in the private schools his mother puts him in since his dad went off to prison.She finally puts him in a public school. At first he finds he is an outsider, but then by actually listening to the students he finds a niche that makes him very popular. His prescriptions for their mental health may not be any better than those his psychiatrists give him , but he learns along the way and ends up giving sound advice.

1155806,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00175VSBC,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 20]","I remember the exact moment I stopped liking ""Charlie Bartlett"": the title character (Anton Yelchin) sits at a piano with his mother (Hope Davis), and as he plays, they both sing ""Those Were the Days"" from ""All in the Family."" This moment occurred less than five minutes into the film, so what does this say about the remaining ninety-two minutes? Not a heck of a lot, since practically every minute features one of the most unrealistic characters of recent memory. Charlie Bartlett--a rich young man who was expelled from every private high school he ever attended--does not represent the cool kid we'd like to be friends with, nor is he someone we'd actually like to be; he's nothing more than a strange kid that does strange things in a desperate attempt to be popular. Now in public school, he distributes prescription drugs to his high school classmates, all while providing free counsel in the boys' bathroom. The drugs were collected from many therapists, including his own. They were prescribed so nonchalantly that I never once believed the therapists were doing their job.The silliest part is that his drug dealing makes him the most popular kid in school, and this is despite dressing in expensive suits, carrying an attach&eacute; case everywhere he goes, and speaking in words that are pathetic instead of funny. It's the classic Zero to Hero scenario, switching from being ignored to being idolized almost overnight. He even wins over the school bully, Murphy Bivens (Tyler Hilton), converting him from a violent hothead into a business partner. It's hard to imagine that satire was this movie's goal, since this isn't the way satire works. A film shouldn't flaunt its eccentricities if it doesn't stop to make some kind of commentary; otherwise, you have film that's weird just for the sake of being weird. ""Charlie Bartlett"" is exactly that, telling a story about people with problems that are absolutely nothing like real problems. Even if they were real, they certainly could never be solved as easily as they are in this film.The self-appointed psychiatrist begins building his reputation by sharing his Ritalin at a school dance. He was prescribed that particular drug because he had trouble concentrating in school--all he could think about was a fantasy of standing on a concert stage, shouting ""Hello! My name is Charlie Bartlett, and I'm not alone!"" to throngs of screaming fans. His reaction to the medication is not a good one; at one point, he runs down the street in the middle of the night in nothing but his underwear, ranting incoherently. Since he understands what his pills capable of, he decides to share them with everyone else, because, obviously, dealing will make you popular.It isn't until the next day that his reputation is set in stone. Bartlett is approached by Kip Crombwell (Mark Rendall), a lanky young kid who suffers from depression and panic attacks. He begs Bartlett for some kind of medication, and not being one to displease his classmates, Bartlett does a little medical research and finds out that Xanax is the best medicine for those symptoms. After tricking his therapist into prescribing it for him, Bartlett gives the pills to Crombwell for a modest fee. Thus a business is born, as are regular treatment sessions in which Bartlett sits in one bathroom stall while the patient sits in another. Pretty soon, a line of patients extends the entire length of the hallway, and this is because--wouldn't you know it--they actually feel better talking to him. Little do they know that Bartlett is about as messed up as they are, with an imprisoned father and an insane mother weighing heavily on his warped mind.Stories like this inevitably include a love interest, which in this case involves Bartlett and Susan Gardner (Kat Dennings). What Susan sees in Bartlett, I'll never understand; the two may have a few things in common, but they could not be more different as far as personalities are concerned. The main objective of this character is to create conflict, not only for Bartlett, but also for her father (Robert Downey, Jr.), who happens to be the school's Principal. Here's a character that adds the most melodrama: after coming home from work, he pours himself glass after glass of heavy booze. He too is the product of a bad relationship, but the problems run deeper than that. None of the students respect him, especially since he allowed surveillance cameras to be installed around the campus' student lounge. He now faces a full-blown teenage uprising, one that's directly influenced by the infamous Charlie Bartlett.If the filmmakers were aiming to make some kind of a meaningful statement about being a teenager, something went horribly wrong. But the film's biggest failure is assuming that we'd invest in the title character, someone who could never exist in real life, no matter how much we'd want him to. ""Charlie Bartlett"" is one of the biggest miscalculations I've ever seen, a needlessly bizarre film that thinks it's being witty but is actually being annoying. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, the personality quirks are piled on far too thick, and I absolutely hated the story, a lame-brained idea that couldn't find a balance between drama and comedy. Movies like this simply don't offer anything, not even an excuse to indulge in mindless absurdity.",2,I Was a Teenage Psychiatrist,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,5339,"['remember', 'exact', 'moment',

1155808,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B00175VSBC,Danielle Turchiano,"[2, 4]","As a smart and creative kid from a troubled family, Anton Yelchin's role as the title character in Charlie Bartlett can't help but recall his in last year's quirky comedy Running With Scissors.  Yelchin wears the same earnest grin and puppy dog wide eyes to play the harmless, innocent little boy who holds the true value of his intelligence and therefore his threatening nature as a deep secret.  The depth of his performance offers a duality to Charlie: is he just a precocious kid or a devious schemer with much greater plans, managing to dupe us all?  Charlie Bartlett plays with the idea of perception versus reality in an increasingly paranoid society, and unfortunately the result is just as muddied and messy as a ""brain on drugs,"" for lack of better terminology.In a quest for friendship and acceptance at his new high school, Charlie uses his cunning to convince doctors to right prescriptions for psychiatric drugs that he then sells to his classmates.  An innate entrepreneur, Charlie is able to hone his skills due to his dippy and indulgent mother (Hope Davis)'s quest to just be the boy's friend.  She shelters him with limos and private schools and ""the estate"" but keeps her emotional distance, undoubtedly hurt by his father's past actions and afraid to get too close to another of the gender, even if he is her own son.  The only other parental figure in the film is the school's principal (Robert Downey Jr.) and father of Charlie's crush (Kat Demmings).  As an alcoholic-workaholic, he is the stereotypical overprotective father, checking up on the boy he sees as a threat to his daughter's purity without considering her role in the relationship.  It's a sobering look at Downey Jr., who is hardened and jaded in the way he always is, but in playing a father and a role model, it just takes him to another level.Director Jon Poll picked an incomparable cast, but without them, Charlie Bartlett would never have gotten a wide release.  Its look at the effects and use of prescription medication is hardly revolutionary; there is no strong message for or against the way they are handed out like candy in society or even in this film.  Events take place one after the other in a surreally heightened timeline, stripping the story of its believability and truth.  The same is said for the conclusions characters draw and the consequences (or lack thereof) they suffer for their actions; there are ups and downs within every ten minutes, making it feel like the film itself should be on some sort of mood stabilizer.  Perhaps these were conscious choices on Poll's part, but with the manic feel of Charlie Bartlett in tone, material, and editing, it's doubtful.  Poll just tries to do too much, and unfortunately his actors get swallowed up in it all.Charlie Bartlett on DVD offers three blas&eacute; commentary tracks from Poll, which is just as narcissistic as Charlie himself, opening the film by standing on a stage, listening to hundreds of his peers chant his name.  Considering Poll just seems to have gotten lucky with some of his choices and on the whole seemed to be flying by the seat of his pants with ""this whole directing thing,"" one commentary can be considered stretching his knowledge and insight, but three is just downright ridiculous.  They could have easily been condensed into one, and the result still would have been underwhelming.  If anything, it would have been nice to hear from the film's saving graces instead of behind-the-scenes players whose approaches were questionable.""The Restroom Confessional"" is a clip that, at two minutes, can't really be called a featurette, featuring the cast and crew of Charlie Bartlett sitting in Charlie's infamous ""office,"" venting their frustrations.  It's cute but forgettable and would only add something to the disc if it were funnier.Everyone in Charlie's world is fit for psychiatric evaluation, and the writing delivers them in a flat, obvious, expositional way, that distracts from the rich and detailed individual performances.  Charlie Bartlett preaches a message from an adolescent boy's mouth, and unfortunately it just makes Poll and his film seem that much more sophomoric.  As a child who just wants to be liked and who is trying to hard to be a man, he is an odd choice to be ""the professional,"" but he, and the film in general, is desperate to prove that sometimes all one needs to initiate change is a genuinely sympathetic ear.",3,Starts Strong But Then Starts An A.D.D Rant,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,4429,"['smart', 'creative', 'kid', 'troubled', 'family', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'role', 'title', 'character', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'recall', 'last', 'year', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'Running', 'Scissors', 'Yelchin', 'same', 'earnest', 'grin', 'puppy', 'dog', 'wide', 'eyes', 'play', 'harmless', 'innocent', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'true', 'value', 'intelligence', 'therefore', 'threatening', 'nature', 'deep', 'secret', 'depth', 'performance', 'duality', 'Charlie', 'just', 'precocious', 'kid', 'devious', 'schemer', 'much', 'greater', 'plans', 'managing', 'dupe', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'idea', 'perception', 'versus', 'reality', 'increasingly', 'paranoid', 'society', 'unfortunately', 'result', 'just', 'muddied', 'messy', 'brain', 'drugs', 'lack', 'better', 'terminology.In', 'quest', 'friendship', 'acceptance', 'new', 'high', 'school', 'Charlie', 'cunning', 'convince', 'doctors', 'right', 'prescriptions', 'psychiatric', 'drugs', 'then', 'classmates', 'innate', 'entrepreneur', 'Charlie', 'able', 'hone', 'skills', 'due', 'dippy', 'indulgent', 'mother', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'quest', 'just', 'be', 'boy', 'friend', 'limos', 'private', 'schools', 'estate', 'emotional', 'distance', 'undoubtedly', 'hurt', 'father', 'past', 'actions', 'afraid', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'gender', 'even', 'own', 'son', 'only', 'other', 'parental', 'figure', 'film', 'school', 'principal', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'father', 'Charlie', 'crush', 'Kat', 'Demmings', 'alcoholic-workaholic', 'stereotypical', 'overprotective', 'father', 'checking', 'up', 'boy', 'threat', 'daughter', 'purity', 'considering', 'role', 'relationship', 'sobering', 'look', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'hardened', 'jaded', 'way', 'always', 'playing', 'father', 'role', 'model', 'just', 'level.Director', 'Jon', 'Poll', 'picked', 'incomparable', 'cast', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'gotten', 'wide', 'release', 'look', 'effects', 'use', 'prescription', 'medication', 'hardly', 'revolutionary', 'strong', 'message', 'way', 'are', 'handed', 'out', 'candy', 'society', 'even', 'film', 'Events', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'other', 'surreally', 'heightened', 'timeline', 'stripping', 'story', 'believability', 'truth', 'same', 'said', 'conclusions', 'characters', 'draw', 'consequences', 'lack', 'thereof', 'suffer', 'actions', 'are', 'ups', 'downs', 'ten', 'minutes', 'making', 'feel', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'sort', 'mood', 'stabilizer', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'conscious', 'choices', 'Poll', 'part', 'manic', 'feel', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'tone', 'material', 'editing', 'doubtful', 'Poll', 'just', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'unfortunately', 'actors', 'get', 'swallowed', 'up', 'Bartlett', 'DVD', 'offers', 'three', 'blas', 'eacute', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Poll', 'just', 'as', 'narcissistic', 'Charlie', 'opening', 'film', 'standing', 'stage', 'listening', 'hundreds', 'peers', 'chant', 'name', 'Considering', 'Poll', 'just', 'have', 'gotten', 'lucky', 'choices', 'whole', 'seemed', 'be', 'flying', 'seat', 'pants', 'whole', 'directing', 'thing', 'one', 'commentary', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'stretching', 'knowledge', 'insight', 'three', 'just', 'downright', 'ridiculous', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'condensed', 'one', 'result', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'underwhelming', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'film', 'saving', 'graces', 'instead', 'behind-the-scenes', 'players', 'approaches', 'were', 'questionable', 'Restroom', 'Confessional', 'clip', 'two', 'minutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'called', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'cast', 'crew', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'sitting', 'Charlie', 'infamous', 'office', 'venting', 'frustrations', 'cute', 'forgettable', 'would', 'only', 'add', 'something', 'disc', 'were', 'funnier.Everyone', 'Charlie', 'world', 'fit', 'psychiatric', 'evaluation', 'writing', 'flat', 'obvious', 'expositional', 'way', 'rich', 'detailed', 'individual', 'performances', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'message', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'mouth', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'Poll', 'film', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'sophomoric', 'child', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'liked', 'who', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'man', 'odd', 'choice', 'be', 'professional', 'film', 'general', 'desperate', 'prove', 'sometimes', 'one', 'needs', 'initiate', 'change', 'genuinely', 'sympathetic', 'ear']",N/A

As a former high school teacher, I would say it gives a great sense of the hip, shallow, energetic, cool, narcissistic, troubled, attractive, lost teens of our era in a unique way. As with my review of Cider House Rules, the young characters, especially Charlie Bartlett, seem to be talented, attractive, and gifted at one level, but looked at dispassionately, their behaviors are negative to an extreme, and in Charlie's case even criminal. He finds a way to play psychiatrist to the troubled teens in the high school, listening to their problems and then, incredibly, dispensing various prescription psychiatric drugs to them.  It's a big money making enterprise, and he's ""doing good."" However, this moralist could not help by remain aware that such action on a big scale is a felony and that in real life, this guy -- portrayed as a sly but basically good kid -- would be put away. He and the students seemed devoid of a moral sense and although they seem cute or innocent in a sense, it is impossible for me not to see their persistent engagement in negative activities and negative thinking as a character disorder. They go about all their crapola with no sense of guilt, embarrassment, or shame. It's all just another day as a teen! How different from the portrayal of teen negativity in the classic ""Blackboard Jungle"" with Glenn Ford.I am recommending this film because it seems to me that it gives a sense of the modern teen mentality. They are negative, stylish, and boy do they have self-esteem (except for one character who tries to kill himself). Sweetness, delicacy of feeling, seriousness, caring, dignity, pleasantness, and gracious, loving demeanors are not to be found.

In my instance, we moved to rural Alabama after having lived in Germany, South Carolina, Taiwan, and Michigan.  In addition to the ""foreign"" accent that I had that was slightly northern, I, also, was one of those short, smart aleck PIA's.In Charlie's case, after being kicked-out of every private school there is, he is faced with the inevitable situation of having to attend public school, where he has confrontations with the school bully, played exceptionally well by Tyler Hilton, tries to get serious with an attractive girl student, who he doesn't realize is the principal's daughter, and butts heads with the principal, played in an understated way by Robert Downey Jr. Toss-in a mother who is half-flaky, a situation with his father we never quite understand (Hey what's a little tax evasion among the rich) and you have Charlie's situation.Along the way, Charlie, played by Anton Yelchin, finds, through ""chemistry,"" a way to interrelate to the other students by becoming a pseudo drug-dealer/counselor, with the counselor concept becoming a way that he fulfills himself.In Charlie's case, he is successful, and to this end, he constantly strives to help others as a means of finding something worthwhile about himself.I thought ""Charlie Bartlett"" was a good movie, much better than most people seem to be giving it credit, but I can understand where they are coming from with regards to their criticism, for it doesn't seem this could happen, but trust me, this could, and probably does more than the teachers realize.I only give this movie four stars because of two scenes, both come at the piano, where, first, Charlie and his mom, pleyed by Hope Davis, sing ""Those were he Days,"" ala ""All in the Family;"" and the second when Charlie and the principal's daughter, Kat Dennings, play and sing at the piano.  Both lacked any lead-in to the scene, and could have been left-out without much impact on the movie, although Kat's scene did show a dice of her you didn't always see otherwise.Overall the movie showed that sometimes we choose life's roles, and sometimes those roles are chosen for us, but whatever is the case, we all have roles...at the very least they are to set a bad example, and at the most, they are to inspire.By the end of the movie we see how Charlie, his mother, his girlfriend, and his principal all inspire....",4,Charlie Bartlett...Role Model?,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,2772,"['movie', 'reviews', 'more', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'are', 'place', 'quite', 'unusual', 'teen', 'angst', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'loved', 'one', 'group', 'age', 'panned', 'another.As', 'someone', 'late', '50', 'who', 'was', 'Air', 'Force', 'brat', 'seemed', 'move', 'two', 'years', 'so', 'father', 'retired', 'service', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'found', 'be', 'credible', 'movie', 'instance', 'moved', 'rural', 'Alabama', 'having', 'lived', 'Germany', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Taiwan', 'Michigan', 'addition', 'foreign', 'accent', 'had', 'was', 'slightly', 'northern', 'also', 'was', 'one', 'short', 'smart', 'aleck', ""PIA's.In"", 'Charlie', 'case', 'being', 'kicked-out', 'private', 'school', 'faced', 'inevitable', 'situation', 'having', 'attend', 'public', 'school', 'where', 'confrontations', 'school', 'bully', 'played', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'Tyler', 'Hilton', 'get', 'serious', 'attractive', 'girl', 'student', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', 'principal', 'daughter', 'butts', 'heads', 'principal', 'played', 'understated', 'way', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Toss-in', 'mother', 'who', 'half-flaky', 'situation', 'father', 'never', 'quite', 'understand', 'Hey', 'what', 'little', 'tax', 'evasion', 'rich', 'have', 'Charlie', 'situation.Along', 'way', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'chemistry', 'way', 'interrelate', 'other', 'students', 'becoming', 'pseudo', 'drug-dealer/counselor', 'counselor', 'concept', 'becoming', 'way', 'himself.In', 'Charlie', 'case', 'successful', 'end', 'constantly', 'help', 'others', 'means', 'finding', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'himself.I', 'thought', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'giving', 'credit', 'can', 'understand', 'where', 'are', 'coming', 'regards', 'criticism', ""n't"", 'seem', 'could', 'happen', 'could', 'probably', 'more', 'teachers', 'realize.I', 'only', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'two', 'scenes', 'come', 'piano', 'where', 'first', 'Charlie', 'mom', 'pleyed', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'sing', 'were', 'Family', 'second', 'when', 'Charlie', 'principal', 'daughter', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'play', 'sing', 'piano', 'lacked', 'lead-in', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left-out', 'much', 'impact', 'movie', 'Kat', 'scene', 'did', 'show', 'dice', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'see', 'otherwise.Overall', 'movie', 'showed', 'sometimes', 'choose', 'life', 'roles', 'sometimes', 'roles', 'are', 'chosen', 'case', 'have', 'roles', 'very', 'least', 'are', 'set', 'bad', 'example', 'most', 'are', 'inspire.By', 'end', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'girlfriend', 'principal', 'inspire']",N/A

Sidhu ""Cylon God.""","[0, 1]","Plot:America takes on their version of `About a Boy', only he's older and wants to become a popular kid by selling drugs and counselling, working his way through the headmaster (Downey Jr.), his daughter and as the schools illegal pharmacist.My Review:After being kicked out of a private school, Charlie Bartlett (Anton Yelchin) is sent to a public school hoping he can fit in more than the likes of the Vaudevillian school boys of higher class status. Bear in mind this is no way to be considered in the same terms and likes of say `Superbad', `Knocked Up' or clever gem `Juno'.Charlie Bartlett is the type of character that is depicted that being rich and likable don't really work, even the rich and well-brought up crave a lower sense of likeness and popularity that doesn't come easy being higher-class, it's all about making a very simple and if naive rich kid become the most popular boy in school, in effect he does.What do some teenagers wish for, security, comfort and the one thing in school: popularity. The film starts off with a scene that involves Charlie standing in front of crowds of adoring peers and strangers, which is an apt allegory to the films events that do eventually see the boy become `the man'.He starts off with the typical picked-on student look of a blazer and a briefcase in which most students carry joint for a quick buzz before class, through the eventual encounter of a bully confrontation, and through that uses the bully to help launder drugs and therapy sessions in the toilets to students who just need to talk, operating craftily, yet daft, plighting schemes to win their approval.Hope Davis plays his atypical mother who blames his current school crisis, though Charlie wouldn't call it that, on her genial conditions that have seem to have been passed down. Davis is given a lot less substance for a 90 minute short but her subtle comedy of a dopey but stern character has resounding success.Charlie Bartlett really gets going seeing the type of student is need of some relief through his fictional conditions of say `panic-attack' prone or just in need of some Ritalin. Charlie's desire for acceptance range against the dangers of selling prescription drugs to his classmates. There is substance there to ponder and ponder you shall but not before you get a great laugh from Charlie's reaction to a dose of Ritalin.Robert Downey Jr. is underused, although given a history for his character that could play out well, even on his part he puts on a big scene performance that doesn't really feel like it's the one you waited for. As a result the film is cut short like a class finishing too early for anything to sink in. It needed some more revision and maybe some homework to work things over. All in all, a good feel good short depiction of an exemplary teenage life.Verdict:it is an interesting premise that just doesn't tie up all the loose ends, however another witty comedy that also has a prescription of feeling good.

1155815,A1Q0HZQ8NY3MBU,B00175VSBC,James N. Kraut,"[0, 0]","Ferris and Charlie are both charismatic high school boys with authority issues and there the similarity ends. First of all, the big difference between Charlie Bartlett and Ferris Beuhler's Day Off lies in the movies' fundamental attitudes. Ferris Beuhler, a straight-forward comedy, is about the adventures of a charming high school guy who cleverly and somewhat endearingly cons his way out of every mess and challenge that attempts to thwart his intention of taking the day off from school. Charlie Bartlett, on the other hand, is essentially a drama, dealing with the struggles of a sensitive, yet traumatized adolescent boy whose lack of effective parenting sets the stage for a crisis that ultimately changes his life. While I admit that there's a preposterous quality to the idea of a high school kid setting up shop as his school's resident therapist and psychiatrist, I was drawn to the movie for just that reason. We live in times where the unlikely appears far more often than we expect. The rules are no longer fixed and the daily headlines bear out the breakneck speed with which our culture is careening off into increasingly unlikely scenarios. Was 9/11 unlikely? Colombine? Today's financial upheavals?I found the Charlie character played well - a good mix of sly, adaptive bravado with arresting innocence and vulnerability. Nor did I find the mother unbelievable. In fact, I've known a lot of mothers with startlingly similar personalities, so if anything, her character troubled me because of what it evoked from my experience, not because of its failure to be able to come off as credible. The school bully was a bit more two-dimensional, although it was amusing how he and Charlie resolved their differences. Robert Downey Jr. was quite effective as the unraveling man in a position of upholding authority and order.I think my biggest problem with the film - a relatively minor one - was how neatly everything fell into place at the end. Yes, it could have happened, but not so quickly and conveniently. Charlie's struggles - and those of the characters around him - would likely have taken much more time, work and pain to resolve.

(the bully, the nerd, the suicidal loner, the sexy kids, the football heroes, the narrow minded and apparently out of touch principal etc.) and each one is handled with a level of creativity unequaled in any film in this genre.And the most important character, Charlie, is treated as a very complex person who does lots of things that are goofy, and some that are downright dangerous, but beneath it is a remarkable intelligent and sensitive person who begins to emerge because of the love and care of outside adults (including his principal and a cop), peers and even his infantile mom and unseen dad.Charlie is the natural leader who discovers how heavy that burden is and chooses to be both a kid and an emerging  as the film draws to a close.Anton Yelchin is the heart of the movie in more ways than one.

As he moves from one private school to another, by the time he finally begins to become popular he is expelled. The problem is that his popularity comes from doing something illegal. Charlie, ever the opportunist, has a creative and entrepreneurial mind for providing things that high school students should not have. As is the way (generally) with high school students, what they can't have is what they are willing to pay for. And Charlie will accept that risk to be popular. Now he has been kicked out of every private school and is left with only one option: public school. A series of events lead Charlie to his next big idea: provide a little medication and a lot of opportunity to unburden themselves of their problems. And just like that, Charlie Bartlett began helping fellow students cope with their problems...from the boy's bathroom.Anton Yelchin stars as the movie's title character. He, if you have seen it, is the kidnapped boy in the movie Alpha Dog. In both movies he plays a charming, though slightly awkward, young man. While I am worried that he wouldn't be as successful in a more mature role, I think he was a great casting choice to be Charlie Bartlett.The story was a little hokey. The characters were a little clich&eacute;. I concede those two points, but still contend that this is a good movie. I enjoyed how the movie did not shy away from those things, but rather embraced them.

This includes sitting in the stall of the boys' restroom at the public school he now attends, dispensing medical and psychiatric advice - along with an assortment of prescription drugs he`s wrangled out of his therapist - to an appreciative (and appreciatively doped-up) student body.  The real trouble begins when Charlie eventually comes under the radar of the school's paranoid (but actually kind of cool) principal, both for his illegal activities in the john and for the romantic interest he's taken in the man's own daughter, who also happens to be a student at the school.Written by Gustin Nash and directed by Jon Poll, ""Charlie Bartlett"" is a cut above the average teen comedy thanks to generally sophisticated writing, winning performances by Anton Yelchin, Robert Downey, Jr., Hope Davis and Kat Dennings and the satirical swipe it takes at a culture that subscribes to the notion that a pharmaceutical a day will keep the blues away.  The movie also comes replete with a couple of nice, comfy moral lessons to make us all feel better about ourselves in the end - namely, that we shouldn't compromise our integrity to achieve popularity, and that we need to learn to channel our creativity in a more ""positive"" direction if  we hope to make anything of ourselves in this life.In short, ""Charlie Bartlett"" is a ""daring"" comedy that doesn't really dare very much when all is said and done.  Yet, while the movie does lose much of its edge in the second half - succumbing to too many ""feel good"" comedy cliches and only-in-the-movies moments - it still manages to leave us smiling in the end.",3,flawed but enjoyable teen comedy,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,1732,"['***1/2Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'precocious', 'enterprising', 'prep', 'school', 'reject', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'be', 'popular', 'sitting', 'stall', 'boys', 'restroom', 'public', 'school', 'now', 'dispensing', 'medical', 'psychiatric', 'advice', 'assortment', 'prescription', 'drugs', 's', 'wrangled', 'therapist', 'appreciative', 'appreciatively', 'doped-up', 'student', 'body', 'real', 'trouble', 'when', 'Charlie', 'eventually', 'radar', 'school', 'paranoid', 'actually', 'kind', 'cool', 'principal', 'illegal', 'activities', 'john', 'romantic', 'interest', 'taken', 'man', 'own', 'daughter', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'student', 'school.Written', 'Gustin', 'Nash', 'directed', 'Jon', 'Poll', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'cut', 'average', 'teen', 'comedy', 'thanks', 'generally', 'sophisticated', 'writing', 'winning', 'performances', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'satirical', 'swipe', 'culture', 'notion', 'pharmaceutical', 'day', 'will', 'keep', 'blues', 'away', 'movie', 'also', 'replete', 'couple', 'nice', 'comfy', 'moral', 'lessons', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'ourselves', 'end', 'namely', 'should', ""n't"", 'compromise', 'integrity', 'achieve', 'popularity', 'need', 'learn', 'channel', 'creativity', 'more', 'positive', 'direction', 'hope', 'make', 'anything', 'ourselves', 'life.In', 'short', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'daring', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'really', 'dare', 'very', 'much', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'movie', 'lose', 'much', 'edge', 'second', 'half', 'succumbing', 'too', 'many', 'feel', 'good', 'comedy', 'cliches', 'only-in-the-movies', 'moments', 'still', 'leave', 'smiling', 'end']",N/A
1155832,A3G5B9IXVO48,B00175VSBC,Rudiger,"[0, 1]","""Charlie Bartlett"" can't seem to decide if it's a teen movie with some higher aspirations or a satire a la ""Rushmore"" or ""Election"" as set in a teen movie context. It certainly has many of the cliches of a teen movie - a high school populated exclusively by misfit ogres or beautiful party animals, a students vs. authority subplot and, in by far its worst scene, a god-awful dance montage - and these make for enjoyability as well as irritability.There's certainly no problem with the acting. Anton Yelchin plays the naive but charismatic Charlie with pleasing gusto, and most of the other students fill in their roles nicely. Among the adults, Hope Davis does well as Charlie's easily-manipulated and (involuntarily) idle rich mother. And, as usual, Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene he's in as the sometimes funny, mostly very sad principal, driven to alcoholism by a job he needs but doesn't want and seeing his daughter become increasingly more distant.The film's flaw, and it's a big one, is that it's too easy. In plot terms we can forgive the improbable rise of Charlie in his new public school. His common-sense advice as well as his provision of all varieties of over-the-counter drugs, while fancifully presented, is easy to imagine working on so unworldly a group as suburban high schoolers. The movie nearly veers in a direction to expose the ultimate shallowness of this approach, particularly in the encounters between Yelchin and Downey, but the movie ends on such a neat note that I can't help but suspect that the film's creators have fallen for it themselves.It's still worth a look. High school movies will be with us forever, and you can do a lot worse than ""Charlie Bartlett.""",3,Enjoyable with some major flaws,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1701,"['Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'teen', 'movie', 'higher', 'aspirations', 'satire', 'la', 'Rushmore', 'Election', 'set', 'teen', 'movie', 'context', 'certainly', 'many', 'cliches', 'teen', 'movie', 'high', 'school', 'populated', 'exclusively', 'misfit', 'ogres', 'beautiful', 'party', 'animals', 'students', 'vs.', 'authority', 'subplot', 'far', 'worst', 'scene', 'god-awful', 'dance', 'montage', 'make', 'enjoyability', 'as', 'well', 'irritability.There', 'certainly', 'problem', 'acting', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'naive', 'charismatic', 'Charlie', 'pleasing', 'gusto', 'most', 'other', 'students', 'fill', 'roles', 'nicely', 'adults', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'well', 'Charlie', 'easily-manipulated', 'involuntarily', 'idle', 'rich', 'mother', 'usual', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'steals', 'scene', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'mostly', 'very', 'sad', 'principal', 'driven', 'alcoholism', 'job', ""n't"", 'want', 'seeing', 'daughter', 'become', 'increasingly', 'more', 'distant.The', 'film', 'flaw', 'big', 'one', 'too', 'easy', 'plot', 'terms', 'can', 'forgive', 'improbable', 'rise', 'Charlie', 'new', 'public', 'school', 'common-sense', 'advice', 'as', 'well', 'provision', 'varieties', 'over-the-counter', 'drugs', 'fancifully', 'presented', 'easy', 'imagine', 'working', 'so', 'unworldly', 'group', 'suburban', 'high', 'schoolers', 'movie', 'nearly', 'veers', 'direction', 'expose', 'ultimate', 'shallowness', 'approach', 'particularly', 'encounters', 'Yelchin', 'Downey', 'movie', 'neat', 'note', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'suspect', 'film', 'creators', 'have', 'fallen', 'still', 'look', 'High', 'school', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett']",N/A

1155834,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00175VSBC,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 5]","Alternating between serious drama and comic absurdity, Charlie Bartlett never settles on a consistent mood, which in turn mixes the messages it attempts to deliver. At times the comedy works well, and at others the heartfelt drama attains admirable poignancy, but as a whole the film never reaches an equilibrium that demands emotional participation. Bartlett is a passive movie, one that requires nothing from its audience, but also gives little. Not without an authenticity in portraying the habits and pandemonium of youth, it satisfies in the end with a feeling of accomplishment, but doesn't offer the remembrance of a more emotional involvement.Charlie Bartlett (Anton Yelchin) is a high school troublemaker, not one purposely out to cause mayhem, but one driven by his ceaseless quest to be needed. After being kicked out of every private school in the city, Charlie winds up at Western Summit Public High School where he immediately finds himself outcast once again. Ignored by the popular kids and bullied by the bullies, Bartlett devises a plan to garner the attention he desperately seeks. Working with bully-turned-business partner Murphy (Tyler Hilton), Charlie sets up a psychiatry office out of the boys' bathroom and begins advising those with problems and prescribing pills from the limitless supply he acquires from his own personal shrink. Finding his calling by trying to fix others' emotional predicaments, Bartlett seems to have finally attained the popularity he's always wanted, but things begin to spiral out of control when the suspicious Principal Gardner (Robert Downey Jr.) starts to wise up to his games and young Charlie falls in love with Gardner's daughter Susan (Kat Dennings).Anton Yelchin turns in an enthusiastic performance as the soft-spoken Charlie Bartlett and creates as likeable a character as the script allows. His motives and excuses (he's just a kid after all) often conflict with truly identifying with this rushed-into-adulthood, wanna-be psychiatrist, but when reality isn't inexplicably working in his favor, his trials and triumphs garner a more deserved appreciation. Kat Dennings plays an adequate love interest but never surpasses the confines of her character's stereotypes. Both young stars are outshone by the ever-entertaining Robert Downey Jr. whose quirky nature makes for a rather unexpected principal, but an engaging one nonetheless. Hope Davis also steals the scenes she appears in with her troubled-to-the-point-of-carefree-insanity wealthy mother that means well but lacks any parental disciplinary fortitude.The primary downfall to Charlie Bartlett's comedy-drama structure is that it doesn't balance the two genres with the realistic appropriateness required to sustain its more authentic approach to portraying high school life. Initially it attempts to be flat-out comedy, with the introduction of estranged characters, capricious high school shenanigans and general youth mischievousness - and then sharply shifts to serious drama. The predicament Bartlett will face is finding its audience. Teens that are attracted by the zany trailer will undoubtedly be disappointed by the time the anti-drug, anti-promiscuity singing montage occurs towards the conclusion, and adults won't have the patience for the fantastical portrayal of adolescent angst. While some pieces may have general appeal, not enough of it can cater to one demographic adequately.Charlie Bartlett retains the more realistic endeavors of misguided youth, but allows its comedic antics to constantly veer the film away from such studious precision. The majority of conflicts, while carefully realized, end up working in Charlie's favor far too easily and the charming sincerity rapidly diminishes. Our protagonist overcomes adversity with hard work no doubt, but also relies heavily on the money readily available to him - something most other fictitious aspiring instigators must achieve without. It's certainly easier to accomplish things when you're rich, but such generous financing could have been overlooked had the alternating bouts of humor and seriousness not hindered the realism so laboriously pursued.- The Massie Twins",3,Charlie Bartlett Movie Review,1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,4168,"['Alternating', 'serious', 'drama', 'comic', 'absurdity', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'never', 'consistent', 'mood', 'turn', 'mixes', 'messages', 'deliver', 'times', 'comedy', 'well', 'others', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'admirable', 'poignancy', 'whole', 'film', 'never', 'equilibrium', 'emotional', 'participation', 'Bartlett', 'passive', 'movie', 'one', 'nothing', 'audience', 'also', 'little', 'Not', 'authenticity', 'portraying', 'habits', 'pandemonium', 'youth', 'end', 'feeling', 'accomplishment', ""n't"", 'offer', 'remembrance', 'more', 'emotional', 'involvement.Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'high', 'school', 'troublemaker', 'not', 'one', 'purposely', 'cause', 'mayhem', 'one', 'driven', 'ceaseless', 'quest', 'be', 'needed', 'being', 'kicked', 'private', 'school', 'city', 'Charlie', 'up', 'Western', 'Summit', 'Public', 'High', 'School', 'where', 'immediately', 'outcast', 'once', 'again', 'Ignored', 'popular', 'kids', 'bullied', 'bullies', 'Bartlett', 'plan', 'garner', 'attention', 'desperately', 'Working', 'bully-turned-business', 'partner', 'Murphy', 'Tyler', 'Hilton', 'Charlie', 'up', 'psychiatry', 'office', 'boys', 'bathroom', 'advising', 'problems', 'prescribing', 'pills', 'limitless', 'supply', 'own', 'personal', 'shrink', 'Finding', 'calling', 'trying', 'fix', 'others', 'emotional', 'predicaments', 'Bartlett', 'have', 'finally', 'attained', 'popularity', 'always', 'wanted', 'things', 'begin', 'spiral', 'control', 'when', 'suspicious', 'Principal', 'Gardner', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'wise', 'up', 'games', 'young', 'Charlie', 'love', 'Gardner', 'daughter', 'Susan', 'Kat', 'Dennings', '.Anton', 'Yelchin', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'soft-spoken', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'likeable', 'character', 'script', 'motives', 'excuses', 'just', 'kid', 'often', 'conflict', 'truly', 'identifying', 'rushed-into-adulthood', 'wanna-be', 'psychiatrist', 'when', 'reality', ""n't"", 'inexplicably', 'working', 'favor', 'trials', 'triumphs', 'garner', 'more', 'deserved', 'appreciation', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'adequate', 'love', 'interest', 'never', 'confines', 'character', 'stereotypes', 'young', 'stars', 'are', 'outshone', 'ever-entertaining', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'quirky', 'nature', 'rather', 'unexpected', 'principal', 'engaging', 'one', 'nonetheless', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'also', 'scenes', 'troubled-to-the-point-of-carefree-insanity', 'wealthy', 'mother', 'well', 'parental', 'disciplinary', 'fortitude.The', 'primary', 'downfall', 'Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'comedy-drama', 'structure', ""n't"", 'balance', 'two', 'genres', 'realistic', 'appropriateness', 'required', 'sustain', 'more', 'authentic', 'approach', 'portraying', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'Initially', 'be', 'flat-out', 'comedy', 'introduction', 'estranged', 'characters', 'capricious', 'high', 'school', 'shenanigans', 'general', 'youth', 'mischievousness', 'then', 'sharply', 'shifts', 'serious', 'drama', 'predicament', 'Bartlett', 'will', 'face', 'finding', 'audience', 'are', 'attracted', 'zany', 'trailer', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'disappointed', 'time', 'anti-drug', 'anti-promiscuity', 'singing', 'montage', 'conclusion', 'adults', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'fantastical', 'portrayal', 'adolescent', 'angst', 'pieces', 'may', 'have', 'general', 'appeal', 'not', 'enough', 'can', 'cater', 'one', 'demographic', 'adequately.Charlie', 'Bartlett', 'more', 'realistic', 'endeavors', 'misguided', 'youth', 'comedic', 'antics', 'constantly', 'veer', 'film', 'away', 'such', 'studious', 'precision', 'majority', 'conflicts', 'carefully', 'realized', 'end', 'up', 'working', 'Charlie', 'favor', 'far', 'too', 'easily', 'charming', 'sincerity', 'rapidly', 'protagonist', 'adversity', 'hard', 'work', 'doubt', 'also', 'heavily', 'money', 'readily', 'available', 'something', 'most', 'other', 'fictitious', 'aspiring', 'instigators', 'must', 'achieve', 'certainly', 'easier', 'accomplish', 'things', 'when', ""'re"", 'rich', 'such', 'generous', 'financing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'had', 'alternating', 'bouts', 'humor', 'seriousness', 'not', 'hindered', 'realism', 'so', 'laboriously', 'pursued.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

It is time to head back to basics with a little of todays appeal. Charlie Bartlett is a rich boy kicked out of his elite prep school so he decides to go to regualr public school. His wishy washy mom who doesn't really have much say in the matter just wants him to be happy and make friends. He enters a world of tight clicks and very pissed off teenagers and he wonders why everyone can't just be happy and cruise through life. So starting as a perscription drug pusher he ends up being a voice for the students to seek advice. His willingness to listen allows the students to let their guard down and realize they are not all different as they thought.This movie really blends the classic John Hughes comedies of old with other classic coming of age films such as The Graduate. It moves a bit slow but the acting is very high quality and the story is pretty fresh and fun to watch. Robert Downey Jr. gives an amazing performace as the principal of the public school.
