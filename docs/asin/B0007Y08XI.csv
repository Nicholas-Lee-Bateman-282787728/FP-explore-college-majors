894919,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0007Y08XI,Brian E. Erland,"[18, 18]","`Bitter Harvest' released in '01 is a fascinating blending of an enchanting Irish countryside circa '24, first love and what could have been a life of quiet contentment for the citizens of the town of Skillet if not for the obsessive, irrational mindset of one mean-spirited local named Harry (Colm Meaney).Harry is convinced that the measure of his personal greatness is measured by his enemies. Hence he decides to make the most successful man in the community his chosen adversary. Fueled by a series of dreams in which he envisions himself turning into a great tree, he devotes himself to his hatred as though fueled by a revelation from God.`Bitter Harvest' is cinematically mesmerizing with an excellent soundtrack and wonderful performances by the entire cast. Cillian Murphy delivers a strong, though understated performance and Kerry Condon is lovely as his love interest Eileen. However the magic in this film is conjured up by Colm Meaney. Following the bizarre journey of Harry's mental machinations in an effort to destroy his would-be adversary is what makes this film so enthralling.",4,"""I Had The Dream Again, About The Tree""",1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,1098,"['Bitter', 'Harvest', 'released', ""'01"", 'fascinating', 'blending', 'enchanting', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'circa', ""'24"", 'first', 'love', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'life', 'quiet', 'contentment', 'citizens', 'town', 'Skillet', 'not', 'obsessive', 'irrational', 'mindset', 'one', 'mean-spirited', 'local', 'named', 'Harry', 'Colm', 'Meaney', '.Harry', 'convinced', 'measure', 'personal', 'greatness', 'measured', 'enemies', 'Hence', 'make', 'most', 'successful', 'man', 'community', 'chosen', 'adversary', 'Fueled', 'series', 'dreams', 'turning', 'great', 'tree', 'hatred', 'fueled', 'revelation', 'God.', 'Bitter', 'Harvest', 'cinematically', 'mesmerizing', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'strong', 'though', 'understated', 'performance', 'Kerry', 'Condon', 'lovely', 'love', 'interest', 'Eileen', 'However', 'magic', 'film', 'conjured', 'up', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Following', 'bizarre', 'journey', 'Harry', 'mental', 'machinations', 'effort', 'destroy', 'would-be', 'adversary', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'enthralling']",Bitter Harvest

Blowing up buildings, sex scenes that really don't fit the film, violence for no reason. I'm enjoying films from other countries more and more and this one is fantastic. A human story told beautifully and the acting is just wonderful. None of that Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise acting but real true acting. The actors are just real ppl they aren't barbie or ken dolls, they have crooked teeth and real bodies. In addition to the fact they can really act.

In it's own way this film does service to the book. It could not help it since Patrick Hamilton, the way he writes is so cinematic. So plenty of inspiration to make a film from the book. Great film. Nowhere near the intrigue and illumination of the novel but still a great film in it's own different way.Hamilton wrote for the screen before media and industry took their toll. Why oh why is this earlier film not on dvd. If you have netflix you can catch it there. Shame i am still trying to find Bitter Harvest on dvd. Please the book. It reads like a film.

894923,A3O2Y1MVIY77IE,B0007Y08XI,"Mary McGreevey ""frwhiskey""","[0, 0]","This Chinese folktale, directed by a Serbian, takes place in 1924 Skillet, the real back-of-beyond in post-WW1 rural Ireland.  Poverty, rain and hard lives are set against beautiful rugged scenery.  The farmers grow cabbages, have sheep and cattle.  The small town where they trade and buy necessities is controlled by the pub owner, who drives his own car.  The rest are still on horses and carts.  Women do a lot of housework in the kitchen and laundry.  Water on turf stoves needs constant boiling.It is the world my own mother was born into back in 1929 in County Mayo, fourth child on a farm near Swinford.  So I watched this with particular interest.The main characters are the pubowner, his wife; a newly acquired &#34;girl&#34; to do some work and then be sold off, a grudge-ridden father and his son, and the local priest.Everyone knows everyone else's business and there is no free and easy living.  There's a lot of recrimination and guilt and anger.The plot consists of the small farmer deciding to make the pubowner his sworn enemy, to harass him and accuse him of injustices, which to the viewer almost seems laughable.  The pubowner barely pays any attention to a small and poor farmer, rather more interested in having affairs, acquiring more properties, throwing parties in his pub and having a good time.Rather than delve into plot details, let me just say that this is a film of surprisingly good and suspenseful turns, like a good old yarn spun by Agatha Christie.  People count for their personalities:  it determines what they do next, and they evolve throughout the film.The Irish accent and the wet woolen clothes, the white freckled and reddish faces, the thick hair and the bad teeth - all these old Irish characteristics make the people seem absolutely real.Like all Irish films made about the past, especially out in the country, it seems to be a story of universal truth that lingers in the mind.Careful that you don't mix this film up with films and books of the same title; in England it's called &#34;When Harry Became a Tree&#34;.",4,The Irish Alzheimers:  Forget everything but your grudges,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2063,"['Chinese', 'folktale', 'directed', 'Serbian', 'place', '1924', 'Skillet', 'real', 'back-of-beyond', 'post-WW1', 'rural', 'Ireland', 'Poverty', 'rain', 'hard', 'lives', 'are', 'set', 'beautiful', 'rugged', 'scenery', 'farmers', 'grow', 'cabbages', 'have', 'sheep', 'cattle', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'trade', 'buy', 'necessities', 'controlled', 'pub', 'owner', 'who', 'own', 'car', 'rest', 'are', 'still', 'horses', 'carts', 'Women', 'do', 'lot', 'housework', 'kitchen', 'laundry', 'Water', 'turf', 'stoves', 'constant', 'boiling.It', 'world', 'own', 'mother', 'was', 'born', 'back', '1929', 'County', 'Mayo', 'fourth', 'child', 'farm', 'Swinford', 'So', 'watched', 'particular', 'interest.The', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'pubowner', 'wife', 'newly', 'acquired', '34', 'girl', '34', 'do', 'work', 'then', 'be', 'sold', 'off', 'grudge-ridden', 'father', 'son', 'local', 'priest.Everyone', 'everyone', 'else', 'business', 'free', 'easy', 'living', 'lot', 'recrimination', 'guilt', 'anger.The', 'plot', 'small', 'farmer', 'deciding', 'make', 'pubowner', 'sworn', 'enemy', 'harass', 'accuse', 'injustices', 'viewer', 'almost', 'laughable', 'pubowner', 'barely', 'attention', 'small', 'poor', 'farmer', 'rather', 'more', 'interested', 'having', 'affairs', 'acquiring', 'more', 'properties', 'throwing', 'parties', 'pub', 'having', 'good', 'time.Rather', 'delve', 'plot', 'details', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'turns', 'good', 'old', 'yarn', 'spun', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'People', 'count', 'personalities', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'evolve', 'film.The', 'Irish', 'accent', 'wet', 'woolen', 'clothes', 'white', 'freckled', 'reddish', 'thick', 'hair', 'bad', 'teeth', 'old', 'Irish', 'characteristics', 'make', 'people', 'seem', 'absolutely', 'Irish', 'films', 'made', 'past', 'especially', 'out', 'country', 'be', 'story', 'universal', 'truth', 'lingers', 'mind.Careful', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'film', 'up', 'films', 'books', 'same', 'title', 'England', 'called', '34', 'When', 'Harry', 'Became', 'Tree', '34']",Bitter Harvest

Colm Meaney was extraordinary in this movie. The things he does to get back at his enemy is comical at times. The scenes with Cillian are funny to watch because of his character and his relationship with his wife. The ending though is a sad one.
