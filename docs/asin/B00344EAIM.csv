Those who have never experienced years of being targets by bullies will not understand the truly scary thing about this film: that the same thing that the victims did toward their tormentors is the same thing that you would almost want to do toward your tormentors.The victims are examples of those who were terrorized by bullies for one reason or another.  The victims are lost, along, often suicidal, because of the torment that is faced daily by bullies.  The victims want to turn the table around, the victims want to give their tormentors a dose of the same medicine.  A dose that would last a lifetime.  Not so much to kill, but to make it abundantly clear what torment has done to the souls of the victims and what torment has shown to the souls of the bullies.Through this movie, you can almost understand the very cause of teen suicide because of bullying (as we've seen recently in the news) or teen violence (such as school shootings) because of bullying.  Bullying is a very primal power in our school systems today, and the movie deals with a very honest look at what...deep inside the minds, maybe not in the forefront, but somewhere in the minds of the victims...the victims sometimes wish to do toward the tormentors.  The vast amount of targets of bullies in their school days will not do what is shown in this film, nor for that matter kill themselves or cause violence at schools, but somewhere, deep inside, this movie shows what lurks in the background of those who are targets.This movie is frightening because of the implications.

As it turns out I am actually glad that I gave it a chance.  I only gave it 3 stars for a few reasons that I will detail.Working in a school for 12 years and also going to school never showed me this type of bullying experience for myself or my students.  I'm sure this type of thing happens in some places, but I had a hard time with it.  The acting in the movie was subpar especially with the 3 ""mean girls"".  Trying to identify with any character was difficult especially as the movie went on.  The leader of the bullied students was a bully in his own right and I think I missed that initially as it is subtle.This is a movie with a fairly powerful message, but I do feel as though it is overly presented in a sadistic way.

The high-school jocks, the prom queen, the ""cool"" kids who no one thought were ""cool.""  And you just wanted to be left alone.  But, today, they make millions playing pro football, while you worry--day to day--how you are going to ""make ends meet"".  It is your worst nightmare:  One of these bullies actually makes it to the NBA, the NFL, or NHL.  What could be worse than having one of ""those"" bullies end up as a national celebrity or pro football star?  You know what I'm talking about:  Lance Armstrong ""hero-worship"".  Society worships the rich, the mean-kids, those with looks and money...but no real accomplishments--except for their later felony records.  We all suspected Lance Armstrong was a liar.  We all knew he was just like all the rest of the mean kids.  This film gives those who were bullied some ""mental"" revenge.  Columbine High School?  We don't know why.  But some of us SUSPECT bullying might have had something to do with it.  And that was THEIR revenge.  Have you ever noticed when somebody dies, we all say great things about them at the funeral and wake.  Isn't that the time to really tell the truth?  This movie does that.  It tells the truth of the thoughts inside the mind of the ""bullied"".  And it takes you there.  No, the acting isn't great.  It could be alot more violent and gory.  But that isn't what this movie is about.  This movie is about confusing mental pain with physical pain:  a football player's pain from a hard-tackle, is nothing like the mental anguish inflicted upon the high-school nerd who must live with those memories every day.  I suspect those two infamous kids at Columbine were MADE evil, by the evil surrounding them--the evil the press is afraid to tell us about.  The movie isn't about about Columbine.  It IS about the NEXT Columbine.  It will happen.  We just don't know when or where.Kids every day go to school, study, mind their own business.  But some of them are bullied.  The know the only real solution is revenge--and they plot that revenge for the rest of their lives; few get it.  This movie is about ""the final"" days of a nerd's revenge on the mean kids.  But what about the ""good kid"" who suffers collateral damage and loses his life just because he happens to be at the wrong spot at the wrong time?

1320596,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B00344EAIM,Anthony Pittore,"[1, 1]","Over the past few years, After Dark Films has brought us an annual series of horror movies known as the ""8 Films to Die For."" This marathon is supposed to include horror films that are ""too shocking"" or ""scary"" for regular theatres. Sadly, very few of the films come close to be ""too shocking"" for theatres, and are often just not good enough to be theatrically released regularly.With 'The Final,' the storyline did not seem like something that would typically be a part of the After Dark marathon, but more of a thriller in the vein of Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant.' The story focuses on a group of abused/ignored/troubled teens who, after considerable planning, decide to seek revenge on the ""higher class"" of popular students in their high school by throwing a costume party and inviting all of those that have wronged them for a wicked trap.The first thing that this film had going for it was the true & honest hatred the filmmakers created for the ""popular kids."" Even as someone who had a good time in my school years, I severely wanted to see these kids get some hardcore vengeance sent down upon them. They were cruel, disgusting, and absolutely horrible. The revenge-seekers, on the other hand, all seemed legitimately nice enough where they weren't the creepy Columbine-type nutjobs. This is a real credit to Jason Kabolati's writing and Joey Stewart's actor direction. Another positive for the film was the gore & violence. Not only was it realistic and cringe-inducing, but it was creative as well.The film did have its problems, however. The acting, mainly from the ""popular kids,"" was borderline terrible, most notably Justin Arnold as Bradley. The outcasts were acceptable enough, but the popular kids were actually difficult to watch at times. The script also had its problems. Much of the dialogue was repetitive and uninteresting (from both sides of the vengeance line). Also, since the story turns to the vengeance plot after only about 30 minutes, the film begins to drag after a while since there's very little difference from the first 30 minutes and any time after that. Perhaps this would have worked more as a 'Masters of Horror'-length short film. Slimming this film down to under an hour probably would have done it a great deal of good.Overall, 'The Final' is one of the better films in the After Dark horror series and it does work well enough as a modern revenge flick. However, it does suffer from a less-than-stellar script and some subpar acting which brings both the entertainment and shock values down. With a better cast and a bit of polishing on the script, this film could have been quite a bit better. However, it was still worthy of a watch and is a welcome entry to the genre among all the remakes we've been suffering through for the past few years.Final Verdict: 6/10.-AP3-",3,Interesting & thoughtful modern revenge flick,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,2813,"['past', 'few', 'years', 'Dark', 'Films', 'brought', 'annual', 'series', 'horror', 'movies', 'known', '8', 'Films', 'Die', 'marathon', 'supposed', 'include', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'too', 'shocking', 'scary', 'regular', 'theatres', 'Sadly', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'come', 'close', 'be', 'too', 'shocking', 'theatres', 'are', 'often', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'theatrically', 'released', 'regularly.With', 'Final', 'storyline', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'something', 'would', 'typically', 'be', 'part', 'Dark', 'marathon', 'more', 'thriller', 'vein', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', ""'Elephant"", 'story', 'group', 'abused/ignored/troubled', 'teens', 'who', 'considerable', 'planning', 'decide', 'seek', 'revenge', 'higher', 'class', 'popular', 'students', 'high', 'school', 'throwing', 'costume', 'party', 'inviting', 'have', 'wronged', 'wicked', 'trap.The', 'first', 'thing', 'film', 'had', 'going', 'was', 'true', 'honest', 'hatred', 'filmmakers', 'created', 'popular', 'kids', 'Even', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'school', 'years', 'severely', 'wanted', 'see', 'kids', 'get', 'hardcore', 'vengeance', 'sent', 'down', 'were', 'cruel', 'disgusting', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'revenge-seekers', 'other', 'hand', 'seemed', 'legitimately', 'nice', 'enough', 'where', 'were', ""n't"", 'creepy', 'Columbine-type', 'nutjobs', 'real', 'credit', 'Jason', 'Kabolati', 'writing', 'Joey', 'Stewart', 'actor', 'direction', 'positive', 'film', 'was', 'gore', 'violence', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'realistic', 'cringe-inducing', 'was', 'creative', 'well.The', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'problems', 'however', 'acting', 'mainly', 'popular', 'kids', 'was', 'borderline', 'terrible', 'most', 'notably', 'Justin', 'Arnold', 'Bradley', 'outcasts', 'were', 'acceptable', 'enough', 'popular', 'kids', 'were', 'actually', 'difficult', 'watch', 'times', 'script', 'also', 'had', 'problems', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'repetitive', 'uninteresting', 'sides', 'vengeance', 'line', 'Also', 'story', 'vengeance', 'plot', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'drag', 'while', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'more', ""'Masters"", ""Horror'-length"", 'short', 'film', 'Slimming', 'film', 'down', 'hour', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'deal', 'good.Overall', 'Final', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'Dark', 'horror', 'series', 'work', 'well', 'enough', 'modern', 'revenge', 'flick', 'However', 'suffer', 'less-than-stellar', 'script', 'subpar', 'acting', 'entertainment', 'shock', 'values', 'down', 'better', 'cast', 'bit', 'polishing', 'script', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'However', 'was', 'still', 'worthy', 'watch', 'welcome', 'entry', 'genre', 'remakes', ""'ve"", 'been', 'suffering', 'past', 'few', 'years.Final', 'Verdict', '6/10.-AP3-']",N/A

Julin Julin Julin Julin. Oh my gosh. Queen of the scream queens in my eyes. I fell for her the moment I saw her in Sweatshop as a girl who got crushed by an anvil, and here she plays a girl who gets her face burned off. It's a torture porn success story.The first time I heard the term &#34;torture porn&#34; I was in an auditorium for a screening of the movie Otis. The lead actor said it was intended as a spoof on the &#34;torture porn genre.&#34; Everybody laughed, and then on came the movie and it was honest to god not all that good but really gorey and the whole audience was...nonplussed. But I was very curious.Years later I encountered Evil Dead Trap II, Gozu, Hostel, Misa: Dark Angel, Inland Empire, and I started to realize that I have a special love for the darkness that only movies can deliver, and a particular fascination for that weird joke genre of torture porn.This movie is an example of it, and you don't really have to be a perv to enjoy it, because it has a story, and the story is even pretty compelling. It's all about a group of bullied high school students who enact revenge on the popular kids in their school, secretly circulating invitations to a hot party in a remote, woodsy location. There's not a lot of suspense here, not a lot of subtle psychological buildup. We learn early on of the plan, and the rest of the movie is us watching them carry it out. It was really interesting to see the torturer kids, the Outcasts, prepare for the party by joining hands and challenging God to give them a sign to make them stop. A lot of work goes into developing the outcasts. It would have been better to have a little more idea of who the popular kids were...but then, Julin is among their ranks. Julin......sigh...Oh, sorry, did I miss something. Anyway, this movie has a few other flaws. There's a little too much of Marc Donato as Dane pontificating and just running at the mouth. He's a good actor and his Russian roulette scene was beautiful, and he made an awesome fanatic, but all the words made the action drag. But the actors' commitment to the work is awesome. There's a particularly good scene by standout Lindsay Seidel where she does the needle bit from Takashi Miike that was neat to see, but then you feel guilty watching it, because the kids in the popular &#34;victim group&#34; are played by good actors and they're whimpering and in pain, and it takes you to this place that's all conflicted inside, with primal urges and big emotions and heavy duty moral convictions&#8212;that's where torture porn is supposed to take you, not to some vapid voyeuristic bloodlust place like the parents in the world are worried about...at least that's how I get to sleep at night, telling myself that.

1320599,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B00344EAIM,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[0, 0]","I caught The Final on Amazon Instant Video awhile ago and was not impressed. At the time, I did not feel the urge to review the film as it did not have much of an impact on me, but it seems to be popping up every time I search for a horror movie these days, even on other websites. The more I run into it, the more it has soured in my memory.Let me be clear: The Final is not your typical low-budget horror hackjob. Yes, it is apparent by the sets and the acting that this is a b-movie, but that isn't what ruined it for me. My issue is with the execution of the story. The Final is a simple revenge tale that pits the bullied against the bullies, an intriguing concept that, unfortunately, fails miserably here.The major problem? With one or two exceptions, the bullied kids are not people with whom the viewer can sympathize. It becomes apparent early in the film that they are all just as cruel, just as mean, and incredibly more violent than the bullies. Because of this, it was not long before I found myself cheering for the bullies. The horrors they are subjected to throughout The Final do not represent righteous justice in glorious action; on the contrary, they suffer unjustified torture accompanied by a relentless barrage of ""this-is-what-you-did-to-us, woe is me"" speeches from the ringleader of the bullied kids. By the end of the film I was tempted to fast forward through this whiner's insufferable monologues, but it never came to that.Really, The Final is nothing more than torture-porn for bullied kids, and it doesn't even succeed completely at that since the amount of outright gore is pretty low.

1320605,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00344EAIM,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 9]","We've all had moments, I'm sure, when we wish we could get back at those who picked on us in high school. That doesn't mean there's an excuse for movies like ""The Final."" This is an ugly, cruel, sadistic, irredeemable revenge fantasy that places no value on human life, nor does it entertain the possibility of hope. It's vile and nihilistic, a story with no message except that life is pointless and not worth living. There isn't a single likeable character, although from the way they're portrayed, it's clear that we were meant to side with the torturers, who go to levels that have the dubious distinction of being both implausible and immoral. Don't make the mistake of believing it's a commentary on society, violence, or acceptance - it serves no purpose other than to be perverse. Seeing this movie was a depressing experience, one I hope to never again go through.The story focuses on five high school kids, all outcasts: Emily (Lindsay Seidel), Ravi (Vincent Silochan), Jack (Eric Isenhower), Andy (Travis Tedford), and their leader, Dane (Marc Donato), who right from the start shows disturbing suicidal tendencies and is an unhealthy influence on the other four. They devise a scheme to invite all the mean, popular kids to a party, which is located in what I think is a farmhouse that just happens to be in the middle of nowhere. Once they arrive, the five outcasts serve the popular kids punch spiked with a powerful sedative, which makes them all pass out. When they awaken, they're not only tethered together via iron shackles, they're also at the mercy of the outcasts, who dress in horror movie costumes complete with masks. Dane takes the idea one step further by using a voice altering machine like Ghost Face in ""Scream.""And that when the games begin. I will not describe them, although I'm sure your imagination will be more than sufficient to fill in the blanks. I will say, however, that it was intertwined with a completely ill-fitting subplot involving the one kid the five outcasts didn't hate. His name is Kurtis (Jascha Washington), and through events too ridiculous to repeat, he winds up tied to a chair in the home of an insane military freak. What this man is doing in this movie is beyond me. So far as I can tell, he's there only to be just as crazy, just as mean, and just as violent as the high school outcasts, making the whole thing one big exercise in merciless brutality.As I sat there, I tried to wrap my mind around the fact that this was just a horror movie, that it was supposed to be bloody and violent, that it was made for entertainment and nothing else. I really did try. But then came a shot in which Dane opens a box filled with artillery weapons, one of which he lifts up and happily poses with, and I could only think of the Columbine shootings, an incident this film was clearly inspired by. To make light of such a tragedy in a gory teen slasher film is not merely in bad taste, it's downright reprehensible.And yet the audience I sat with took it all as a fun night out, continuously laughing, wooing at the screen, applauding when someone died a horrible death. My god - they were actually enjoying this. I was so disturbed by them that, as soon as the film ended, I quickly left the theater in the hopes that no one would comment to me about how awesome it was. You see, that has happened to me from time to time, and when it comes to the bad movies, it often takes a great deal of effort to stop myself from ranting at these people. If someone had approached me this time around, I don't think I would have been able to suppress my disgust. If anything, I probably would have accused him or her of being a vicarious murderer.I truly hated this movie. Everything it stands for - the notion that teenage bullying, depression, and homicide is somehow entertaining, the belief that suicide is the answer to all of life's problems, the pleasure taken from torturing and maiming in the most abhorrent of ways - is wrong on every level imaginable. It's sick, brazen, and relentless, and I'm sorry for ever having seen it. To any prospective commenters ready to tell me off for not getting ""The Final"": I'm glad I didn't get it. There's no context under which I can see this story making sense, nor is there anything to be gained by telling this story in this particular way.

1320613,A4MF6S6TSGS8T,B00344EAIM,F. Gwin,"[1, 8]","Do you like to nitpick movies while you are watching them? I do, and this movie has so many flaws I don't even know where to start.- The characters are completely unlikeable and forgettable. You have to be able to watch a movie and like at least one character, but the only character they set up as likable is a complete idiot. The ""jerks"" from school aren't just jerks, they are stereotypical personality-less airheads. The ""nerds"" aren't vulnerable unstable children who form a massive plan together, they are literally all deranged psychopaths (thus I will be referring to them as psychos from now on). Whose side am I supposed to be on movie? The only likable character is also a complete idiot, and there is also an over the top stereotypical vietnam veteran in this movie... And I couldn't even remember a single name because the characters are just stereotypical forgettable cut-outs.- The dialogue is extremely forced. If you are going to watch this movie then pay attention to how many lines sound natural. The head psychopath is completely over the top melodramatic, coup that with the forced dialogue and this movie had me face-palming the whole way through.- Common sense flaws are through the roof. Several times while watching this I was yelling at the complete idiots on scene to do something that would obviously set them free (or at least try to escape). The jerks don't even try to escape in this movie. At one point none of the psychos have a gun, and the head psycho kneels over and takes off his mask for the main jerk. At this point the main psychos' gun is lying on the floor in from of the main jerk, and rather than use both his feet to kick the head psycho in the face and grab his gun (killing at least one or two out of five of them) he just sits there making no attempt to fight back. The prisoners aren't even really tied down either. I mean, they couldn't walk very far if they got up, but they could have easily converged on one of the psychos that walked between them, or they could stop the psychos from torturing their friends. Also, remember how I said the jerks never fight back in this movie? Well, the movie keeps cutting back and forth to having different jerks in a chair that they are tortured in. But again, DID THEY NOT EVEN TRY TO FIGHT BACK WHEN UNCHAINED AND WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM? Especially after seeing what happened to the others in the chair??? And don't even get me started on the likable character! When he shows up at the party where they drug everyone, the psychos regret that he is there but say that they'll have to include him in the torture anyway because it's to late to get him to leave. Then they drug everyone so that they fall asleep and chain them up. If you don't want to hurt the likable guy them just tie him up in a different room! You don't HAVE to torture him at all. And when he escapes into the forest the psychos just randomly stop chasing him for no reason so he gets away. Also, when the likable character is ""captured"" by the vietnam veteran, the VV is completely over-the-top against him until he mentions that his dad used to be in the army. The VV then suddenly pulls a complete 180 and is convinced that the likable character is a good guy. Talk about having no consistency, right? I could go on and on but I think I have made my point.- Continuity flaws are terrible as well. There are spoilers in this next section so be aware. At one point in this movie the psycho dressed as a clown is killed, but in the very next shot he is shown riding a four wheeler alongside the other psychos who went to chase the likable character. Two of the other psychos are also killed, but they are both still alive in the very next shot until the end of the movie. It's like the writers just stopped trying at that point.- For a movie that tries to be horrific and scary, this movie has no blood effects. I'm serious. The only blood I saw in the movie was on a small hand towel that a girl was holding to conceal her obviously-not-cut-off fingers. That's right! You see people have their fingers cut off, have their faces melted, get stabbed in the throat, and have their kneecaps bust out, and there are NO BLOOD EFFECTS. How low was there budget? If this movie had good gore perhaps the completely retarded characters and setup could be forgiven. But no, I guess this movie sucks all the way through.I love watching bad horror movies and nitpicking them, and it's really rare that I come across a movie this flawed. It has no redeemable qualities whatsoever!

The flaws fall into the teen stereotypes, such as the bully jocks, the clueless rich girls, the cool hip hop kid and the withdrawn social outcasts, The saw like torure scenes and the overall lack of suspense. It's strengths, I would say would be the production value, the pacing, acting, and the overall message that the film leaves you with. This film, if you stay with it, will leave you disturbed, repulsed, and remind you of the tragedy that, for some unfortunate few, is high school. Throughout the film, memories of my own teenage years went through my mind. I myself was bullied and seen other kids get treated even worse. Sure, you hated your tormenters, even fantasized about kicking their butts, but you'd never tried to, either through fear of what may happen or just because you were a good enough person to rise above it. And that's the overall tragedy of The Final, all these kids could've risen above the abuse, supported each other, and made something out of their lives. Instead, they chose revenge and scarred the bullies like they did them, only physically, which it what they, the outcasts carried inside. I recommend to see the final for this reason only to make people ponder about what goes on in the school hallways and the minds of the tortured youth.

All the kids that are bullied seem to come from specific backgrounds that bullies use for stereotypical jokes that strike us as extremely hurtful, a slap in the face of the American mindset (just look at all the Anti-Islam jokes that are in chain e-mails, 'nuff said). I'm not one for torture movies (never watched the Hostel movies, and thought only the 2nd Saw in the Saw series was really good), but this, from the trailer, I knew I wanted without reading any reviews. Kids getting tortured by school bullies who think they're too good for the system to notice, and, therefore, get away with whatever they do. And the only popular kid who's not a jerk is really enjoyable as a person, not a humanized monster. Beyond him, you can tell there's reasons to hate the popular crowd and sympathize with the outcasts. The slightest bit of humor in this movie was okay, and I'm glad it didn't interfere with the overall tone and atmosphere in this film, where you can feel that nobody seems to have any hope.Spiritually, there's a small group prayer to God, and people challenge the kids torturing everyone and ask who they thought they were to ""play God"", only for a witty, if misguided, answer. Toward the end, it did get depressing, for a reason, and, if you really pay attention to all that happens, and not compartmentalize everything, you may even feel a devastatingly useful message about how hurtful bullying is to those who are bullied and how the cruelty is one-sided. And even when the one time that heaviest swearing happens, the price is paid. A tricky intro scene that helps close the movie as well, it shows it's not always as traightforward as people want to think of life.

1320624,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B00344EAIM,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[3, 3]","This movie started out with a lot of potential. You have a group of kids that are unfairly victimized by various bullies - for example, Emily is bullied by the popular girls while a few of the guys are being picked on by the jocks and preppies. These kids get together and decide to plan revenge on all the kids who are mean to them. And believe me, some of the bullies are MEAN - they go so far as to destroy one of their victim's cameras just because they can.So the victims decide to host a party. The ending is foreshadowed at the beginning with a short clip of what happens after the party (centering on one of the former bullies) before going back to the events before the party, where one teacher is giving a history lecture on how the Han Dynasty would sometimes punish its opponents not with death but with disfigurement - something that the bullies' victims take to heart.I gave this story 3 stars because while it was tight in some parts, it started to unravel in some other parts. I felt extremely disappointed when the Indian kid was turned onto by his friends simply because he tried to help one of the others escape (he was not invited to the party because he was to be 'spared', but showed up nonetheless) That to me just did not work in this story. However, this is still a story worth watching. You cannot help but feel that the bullies are getting what is coming to them, especially if you yourself have been a victim of bullying in your life, and some of the punishments (especially to the really mean, tough jock) are rather fitting for their offenses.The movie is very dark, even for the victims themselves, but is still an interesting one to watch.

I couldn't agree more: The Final, an After Dark Horrorfest 4 selection, is Hell. And not the ""cool"" Hell like a Mondo, like a Cannibal, like a Nekromantik sprung on a first date. It's the Hell of a movie that is so mediocre it's not even entertainingly bad. It can't be laughed at, gamed, or cajoled into an eye-rolling joke. It's something you just stare at and sigh.The Final follows the attempted redemption of five trod-upon kids: Audition Gal, Curly Gas Mask, Banjocrow, Unfunny Clown, and Officer Nazi. I say 5, but it's more likely 7 or 8 since the Unfunny Clown comes back to life in some reused footage, and Banjocrow and Officer Nazi have misleading stand-ins whose only purpose is to die randomly in the surrounding woods. These 5 to 8 kids are Columbine material: always picked on, always found in the bathroom with something worth breaking, always reciting manifestos of ""woe is me"". There's goth poetry from Audition Gal, ""THE TIME IS NOW!!!!!!111!"" rhetoric from Curly Gas Mask, circle jerks asking God to approve their plan by NOT sending them a sign, and a whole host of other groan-inducing cliches that make you want to join in and be a bully alongside the super jocks and their snobbish girlfriends. Cos, you know, they've gotta be in there too or it's not a horror movie.Actually, that's true: it's not a horror movie and Curly Gas Mask makes that abundantly clear when he informs his captured tormentors that he doesn't intend to kill anyone. The movie poster's chalkboard states ""I will not kill my classmates"" and that's a joke on us: it's more positive affirmation than remedial confirmation. The Final is not torture porn though it wants to be: lopped off fingers don't spray blood (or even drip), nothing is agonizing, and the only deaths are knife stabs or gun shots. There's no sleaze either, as the Valley Girls who dress up in Spencer Gifts police uniforms for the requisite costume party never do anything even moderately alluring and similarly affirm that ""[our costumes] scream we love sex, but not with [the viewer]"". Nor is this an eye-opening treatise on school society and violence: it's merely the same poor soapboxing we're already tired of, but the characters all go through the motions anyways, becoming convenient shills for Curly to launch into another snakeoil tirade. It doesn't Get Better.Every so often, something interesting shines through, but it's only interesting because it's in this movie, not because it's unique, original, or follows through: an attempt to hide the face of every adult authority, the token black guy blaming the travesty on his own racial slur to get the cops involved, the fingerless girlfriend changing her mind about inflicting pain back on her boyfriend, and so on. But each of these is outweighed by the suffocating forces of suck: the next door savior is gasp... a villain!, the didactic Jigsaw voice-over ending, tension-less threatening because we know no one will die, and more.Like the requisite ""guns in a wooden crate"", The Final contains the same lamentable payload of most teen horror attempts: cliches, overacting, and cribbing from answer keys of movies long since passed. Instead of ""bugging out"" when ""the cops!"" pulled it over, it should have, like you, screamed ""Dude!

Durham ""Big Evil""","[10, 15]","For every Saw and Hostel torture fest that is merely sadism for the sake of sadism, here comes The Final; a torture flick that actually bears a message.  Part of the fourth year of the After Dark Horrorfest lineup, The Final revolves around a group of misfit teens, who decide to take brutal revenge on a handful of the popular kids who have made their lives more than miserable for so long.  Sadistic, graphic, and almost more brutal than it should be to fully get its point across, The Final surprisingly works well for what it is because it is all too easy to sympathize with the kids doing all the torturing.  That, and the performance of Lindsay Seidel as the all too cute, and all too demented, Emily make The Final better than it really should be.  Though it overstates its point ad nauseum, The Final is a worthwhile endeavor regardless, and is better than any recent Saw flick could ever hope to be either for that matter.",3,Surprisingly not bad,1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,931,"['Saw', 'Hostel', 'torture', 'fest', 'merely', 'sadism', 'sake', 'sadism', 'here', 'Final', 'torture', 'flick', 'actually', 'message', 'Part', 'fourth', 'year', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'lineup', 'Final', 'group', 'misfit', 'teens', 'who', 'decide', 'take', 'brutal', 'revenge', 'handful', 'popular', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'lives', 'more', 'miserable', 'so', 'long', 'Sadistic', 'graphic', 'almost', 'more', 'brutal', 'should', 'be', 'fully', 'get', 'point', 'Final', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'what', 'too', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'kids', 'doing', 'torturing', 'performance', 'Lindsay', 'Seidel', 'too', 'cute', 'too', 'demented', 'Emily', 'make', 'Final', 'better', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'point', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Final', 'worthwhile', 'endeavor', 'regardless', 'better', 'recent', 'Saw', 'flick', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'be', 'either', 'matter']",N/A
1320631,A1NKJJCBBYVP4V,B00344EAIM,"Philip C. Perron ""Philip""","[2, 5]","A revenge flick, that's exactly what this film is, and it is a revenge flick to extremes.  Basically the film is the typical high school nerds being picked on by the ""cool"" kids to the point where their teenage lives cannot even be called ""lives"" since they live in utter fear, depression, or simply ennui.  Nothing good happens around the unpopular kids.  The cheerleaders or the beauty queens insult and belittle our pretty but ""dorky"" girl.  The science and math kids are absolutely tortured by our sport stars and prom kings.  I guess nothing new or original can happen in the setup to such a film.  We've seen it all before.  Mean Girls, Heathers, Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, you name the high school comedy or drama, and you have the same characters but with even maybe a more sadistic edge from the popular kids.  So the director/screenwriting team's attempts to make you hate the popular kids definately took me out of my viewing experience because I was saying to myself:  ""they are trying as hard as they can to make me hate certain characters.""During the second part of the film, we have our revenge.  The revenge is complete megalomaniacal and unfortunately for me made me hate the nerds even more than the popular kids.  The ""lead"" nerd is really just a psychopath with no empathy in him whatsoever.  And most of his followers, including the nerdy girl, are the same and if any of them have second doubts it felt to me completely unreal since they too were psychopaths and it was too hard for me to even think they had any conscious to change or want to stop their revenge.  Those being ""punished"" come to horrible ends and even when some beg or ask for forgiveness, forget it.  And the exposition.  We get way too much and it all is a bunch of nonsense ... the nerds didn't become murdering torturers because of their caste, they were pyschopaths the moment they were born.To wrap the film up, even the surivors of the revenge come to horrible ends of their own (suicide, drugs, depression, whatever) and the director/writer seem to think you'll cheer that too when by this point I was completely the opposite.  The popular kids were so ruined by the nerds (or psychopaths), that they were victims 100% and that's what I felt completely.  Definately not what the director/writer were hoping.Lastly, there is a middle aged war veteran in the film that plays a large part but most certainly should not have been in the film; it slows it down and is almost comical.  And there is another character, a fellow student who performs R&B; and is friendly with the nerds, that is out of place in this same sequence of the film and the character is written way too unrealistic and poorly.So to round up, the film was an utter disaster in its attempts at whatever the director/screenwriter were trying to get at.  The characters were unsympathetic at the very least.  The whole war veteran set piece was unnecessary and B-movie nonsense.  All in all, you'd think I'd not recommend this film.  But no, watch it.  It is a horror film and it is technically well done.  There were some really good shots, lightning effects, acting, and edits.  It isn't a complete waste of time but just don't get your hopes up.",2,Mediocre entry to horrorfest films,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,3215,"['revenge', 'flick', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'revenge', 'flick', 'extremes', 'Basically', 'film', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'nerds', 'being', 'picked', 'cool', 'kids', 'point', 'where', 'teenage', 'lives', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'called', 'lives', 'live', 'utter', 'fear', 'depression', 'simply', 'ennui', 'Nothing', 'good', 'happens', 'unpopular', 'kids', 'cheerleaders', 'beauty', 'insult', 'belittle', 'pretty', 'dorky', 'girl', 'science', 'math', 'kids', 'are', 'absolutely', 'tortured', 'sport', 'stars', 'prom', 'kings', 'guess', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'can', 'happen', 'setup', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Heathers', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'name', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'drama', 'have', 'same', 'characters', 'even', 'maybe', 'more', 'sadistic', 'edge', 'popular', 'kids', 'director/screenwriting', 'team', 'attempts', 'make', 'hate', 'popular', 'kids', 'definately', 'took', 'viewing', 'experience', 'was', 'saying', 'myself', 'are', 'trying', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'make', 'hate', 'certain', 'characters', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'have', 'revenge', 'revenge', 'complete', 'megalomaniacal', 'unfortunately', 'made', 'hate', 'nerds', 'even', 'more', 'popular', 'kids', 'lead', 'nerd', 'really', 'just', 'psychopath', 'empathy', 'whatsoever', 'most', 'followers', 'including', 'nerdy', 'girl', 'are', 'same', 'have', 'second', 'doubts', 'felt', 'completely', 'unreal', 'too', 'were', 'psychopaths', 'was', 'too', 'hard', 'even', 'think', 'had', 'conscious', 'change', 'want', 'stop', 'revenge', 'being', 'punished', 'come', 'horrible', 'ends', 'even', 'when', 'beg', 'ask', 'forgiveness', 'forget', 'exposition', 'get', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'bunch', 'nonsense', 'nerds', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'murdering', 'torturers', 'caste', 'were', 'pyschopaths', 'moment', 'were', 'born.To', 'film', 'up', 'even', 'surivors', 'revenge', 'come', 'horrible', 'ends', 'own', 'suicide', 'drugs', 'depression', 'director/writer', 'seem', 'think', ""'ll"", 'cheer', 'too', 'when', 'point', 'was', 'completely', 'opposite', 'popular', 'kids', 'were', 'so', 'ruined', 'nerds', 'psychopaths', 'were', 'victims', '100', '%', 'what', 'felt', 'completely', 'Definately', 'not', 'what', 'director/writer', 'were', 'hoping.Lastly', 'middle', 'aged', 'war', 'veteran', 'film', 'large', 'part', 'most', 'certainly', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'down', 'almost', 'comical', 'character', 'fellow', 'student', 'who', 'R', 'B', 'friendly', 'nerds', 'place', 'same', 'sequence', 'film', 'character', 'written', 'way', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'poorly.So', 'round', 'up', 'film', 'was', 'utter', 'disaster', 'attempts', 'director/screenwriter', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'characters', 'were', 'unsympathetic', 'very', 'least', 'whole', 'war', 'veteran', 'set', 'piece', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'B-movie', 'nonsense', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'not', 'recommend', 'film', 'watch', 'horror', 'film', 'technically', 'well', 'done', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'shots', 'lightning', 'effects', 'acting', 'edits', ""n't"", 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up']",N/A
1320632,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00344EAIM,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Final (Joey Stewart, 2010)Stewart, an AD on a number of successful TV shows (Wishbone, Walker: Texas Ranger, et al.), tries his hand at feature directing with The Final, which aspires to be a torture-porn film with a message but can't quite bring either side of that ""with"" off correctly. Which is not to say this is necessarily a bad movie; there's some enjoyment to be had out of it, if you can sail your way past some of the sillier moments and a few massive plot holes, but it's not going to be on anyone's hit parade.Plot: a group of bullied students conspire to get the high school's elite bullies trapped at their secluded after-prom party and teach them a lesson.Yep, that's it. There are a few rules (the conspirators make a pact that they will not kill any of their captives, for example), but that's the gist. As a plot, it's not a bad one (IMDB's trivia says it's actually ""based on true events"", though we all know what that means), and where you saw this thing will probably affect whether you can make sense of some of it (Syfy edited two key scenes out, IMDB tells me, so rent the DVD, but some things--such as the identities of the ""guards"" in the woods--were left on the cutting-room floor altogether, and probably shouldn't have been). But as far as plots go, it's simple. And there's no dearth of acting talent here. Dane, the leader of the outcasts, spent a few years doing time on Degrassi: The Next Generation, as well as appearing in movies as diverse as The Sweet Hereafter and White Oleander. Similarly, the most sympathetic of the captured showed up in Big Momma's House and Enemy of the State. We're not dealing with amateur actors here, and that's probably the film's major saving grace; the story isn't all that compelling (and if you saw it on cable, I'm sure the compelling bits were strongly edited), but it's well-acted, and that's something.As for the behind-the-scenes work, it's competent, though nothing more than that. Stewart knows where to put a camera to decent, though not necessarily maximum, effect (and seems to have learned a good deal of that from post-James Wan Saw-franchise directors, unfortunately). Dave McFarland handled the cinematography, and the fact that he has twenty-six cinematography credits on IMDB and even I've never heard of any of them but this film is telling. (Of the three other films IMDB lists at the top of his page, which are supposedly the four most ""popular"" based on whatever odd heuristics they use, 2007 shocker Cult, starring Taryn Manning, is the most popular by sheer number of votes, and it has less than eight hundred; The Final, as I write this, is closing in on three thousand, not an out-of-the-ordinary number for an After Dark Horrorfest picture.) Set Designer Eric Whitney did the best work of the tech folks, but then given that three-quarters of the movie takes place in two locations, one could argue his job was also the easiest of the lot. But that secluded cabin is pretty darned awesome.As a side note, IMDB also tells me both of the project's executive producers died in close proximity to this film--one just before shooting was completed and one just after.

THE FINAL is that fantasy lived out by a handful of mistreated teenagers, who turn the tables on their tormentors with a night of torture and sermonizing - intending to ""teach them a lesson.""  After luring them to a supposed mega-party out on an isolated ranch, they drug, tie up, and subsequently torture the bullies - not intending to kill, but rather to unleash their rage.Sounds interesting?  Dark and rife with possibility?  I thought so too, and in the hands of an expert storyteller, this could have been a fascinating psychological thriller, exploring revenge, remorse, redemption, etc . . .However, that is not what we have here.  There are several really compelling scenes, but the sum isn't equal to its parts. The movie makes a fatal error, and that is that we never really get a sense that the bullies are all that bad.  They taunt, throw milk at them, ultimately break a camera - and for this they are tortured and maimed!?  If we are meant to feel sorry for the bullied kids, we don't - they just come off as psychopathic monsters.What's worse is the severely overdramatic writing and performances concerning the bullied kids.  They act and speak as if they've survived a Nazi death camp.  Blank stares, lines about hell and doing God's will, even praying for God to give them a sign that they are doing the right thing (how nice of them to give Him an opportunity to intervene). And while they torture, they slowly pace back in forth before their cowed and captive audience, delivering wise sermons about what years of bullying has turned them into, and the lessons these bullies will learn and blah-blah-blah . . .Every line they utter is full of meaning, darkness, pathos . . . by the time they begin their third round of torture, you just want them to shut up and shoot everyone already!  The filmmakers think they've put together a really profound and thought-provoking film, as evidenced by the final line from the torturers - ""there are more of us out there"" - before he takes his own life.  How deep  . . . give me a break!In short, the whole proceeding feels like the kind of movie you'd get if you gave a camera to a group of horror-crazed high school kids.  They have an interesting idea, they just can't make anything compelling out of it!Early on, there is a scene where the bullied kids look forlornly at the bullies - they already have their plan in place - and one of them says, ""all those years of watching horror films - let's put them to use.""  This, then, paves the way for the filmmakers to rip-off movies like AUDITION, SAW, even NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN - but rather than coming off as homage, it only serves to remind the viewer of the better, far superior horror films out there.

In this case, it's a version of a revenge fantasy from those bullied by high school students getting revenge on the 'popular' kids who torment them. Given the enduring quality of this theme in American cinema, there's probably a good film to be made about this that would be driven by an actual understanding of human psychology that would be meaningful. This film, however, isn't that film.

1320641,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00344EAIM,trebe,"[0, 0]","Revenge pictures involving students have been done before, however The Final (2010) takes the concept to a mass scale, as a group of abused high school students, takes their revenge on another group of students they perceive have wronged them.  Part of After Dark Horrorfest Volume 4, director Joey Stewart's presentation is very dramatic, full of ceremony, and gratuitously violent.  Although the reality factor is close to nil, the film does not back away from being brutal and sadistic, featuring and glorifying torture and disfigurement.With deeds ranging from being just being petty and mean, to physical violence, the film shows various students being put down, bullied, and hassled by some of the beautiful and cool kids.  Dane (Marc Donata) is the leader of the downtrodden group of outcasts, who having reached their limit, are plotting revenge on a grand and deadly scale.Quite easily, the outcasts trick the cool kids, by inviting them to a bogus masquerade party at an isolated house in the woods.  After being drugged, the offenders wake up and find themselves prisoners in chains, in a large room, where their captors still wearing masks, stand over them condemning them for their past deeds.  From this point forward, the film is mostly a series of ceremonious torture scenes, that may make you squirm a bit.  The torture is often accompanied by eerie banjo music.  One involves a girl given the choice of clipping off the fingers of another hostage.  After she declines, the other hostage is given the same grim proposition.  This is topped by Dane's sadistic knifework, that is reminiscent of a scene from Wolf Creek.A couple of hostages manage to escape into the woods, taking the scene from the chamber of torture to the outdoors, where the mayhem continues.  It's a rough neighborhood, as after escaping, Kurtis (Jascha Washington) one of the hostages, is first threatened at gunpoint by a cop, and then knocked out and tied up by a nutty neighbor (Matthew Posey).  Eventually Kurtis manages to call the police.  As things begin to unravel, the resolve of the outcasts begins to wane, and those that remain decide their own fate.The actions of the disgruntled students in The Final might be compared to the events at Columbine, however those killings were largely random, involved explosives, and were not directed at gaining revenge against specific persons.  While perhaps cloaked as a warning to those that engage in bullying, that their ""actions have consequences"", The Final is mostly an extension of the revenge and torture genre, taken to a very mean and sick extreme.  Vicious and brutal, the ceremoniously administered punishments mainly appeal to the dark side of human nature, glorifying the infliction of pain.The outcasts are in no way heroic or noble, and are not justified in their actions.  That a few in the group have some remorse, is perhaps the most positive thing that can be said about these twisted individuals.  Some films promote sadistic acts as part their marketing, but fail to deliver.  The Final is one that actually comes close to reaching a cold-hearted sadistic place, and crossing over into gratuitous exploitation.  The cast also features Lindsay Seidel, Eric Isenhower, Justin Arnold, and Julin.  The writing and dialog are quite dreadful, and the gore is not done particularly well.  This is one party that is definitely not for the squeamish.",2,a sadistic and unflinching tale of vengeance...,1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,3400,"['Revenge', 'pictures', 'involving', 'students', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'however', 'Final', '2010', 'concept', 'mass', 'scale', 'group', 'abused', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'revenge', 'group', 'students', 'perceive', 'have', 'wronged', 'Part', 'Dark', 'Horrorfest', 'Volume', '4', 'director', 'Joey', 'Stewart', 'presentation', 'very', 'dramatic', 'full', 'ceremony', 'gratuitously', 'violent', 'reality', 'factor', 'close', 'nil', 'film', 'not', 'back', 'away', 'being', 'brutal', 'sadistic', 'featuring', 'glorifying', 'torture', 'disfigurement.With', 'deeds', 'ranging', 'being', 'just', 'being', 'petty', 'mean', 'physical', 'violence', 'film', 'various', 'students', 'being', 'put', 'down', 'bullied', 'hassled', 'beautiful', 'cool', 'kids', 'Dane', 'Marc', 'Donata', 'leader', 'downtrodden', 'group', 'outcasts', 'who', 'having', 'reached', 'limit', 'are', 'plotting', 'revenge', 'grand', 'deadly', 'scale.Quite', 'easily', 'outcasts', 'trick', 'cool', 'kids', 'inviting', 'bogus', 'masquerade', 'party', 'isolated', 'house', 'woods', 'being', 'drugged', 'offenders', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'prisoners', 'chains', 'large', 'room', 'where', 'captors', 'still', 'wearing', 'masks', 'stand', 'condemning', 'past', 'deeds', 'point', 'forward', 'film', 'mostly', 'series', 'ceremonious', 'torture', 'scenes', 'may', 'make', 'squirm', 'bit', 'torture', 'often', 'accompanied', 'eerie', 'banjo', 'music', 'One', 'girl', 'given', 'choice', 'clipping', 'off', 'fingers', 'hostage', 'other', 'hostage', 'given', 'same', 'grim', 'proposition', 'topped', 'Dane', 'sadistic', 'knifework', 'reminiscent', 'scene', 'Wolf', 'Creek.A', 'couple', 'hostages', 'manage', 'escape', 'woods', 'taking', 'scene', 'chamber', 'torture', 'outdoors', 'where', 'mayhem', 'rough', 'neighborhood', 'escaping', 'Kurtis', 'Jascha', 'Washington', 'one', 'hostages', 'first', 'threatened', 'gunpoint', 'cop', 'then', 'knocked', 'out', 'tied', 'up', 'nutty', 'neighbor', 'Matthew', 'Posey', 'Eventually', 'Kurtis', 'call', 'police', 'things', 'begin', 'unravel', 'resolve', 'outcasts', 'wane', 'remain', 'decide', 'own', 'fate.The', 'actions', 'disgruntled', 'students', 'Final', 'might', 'be', 'compared', 'events', 'Columbine', 'however', 'killings', 'were', 'largely', 'random', 'involved', 'explosives', 'were', 'not', 'directed', 'gaining', 'revenge', 'specific', 'persons', 'perhaps', 'cloaked', 'warning', 'engage', 'bullying', 'actions', 'have', 'consequences', 'Final', 'mostly', 'extension', 'revenge', 'torture', 'genre', 'taken', 'very', 'mean', 'sick', 'extreme', 'Vicious', 'brutal', 'ceremoniously', 'administered', 'punishments', 'mainly', 'appeal', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'glorifying', 'infliction', 'pain.The', 'outcasts', 'are', 'way', 'heroic', 'noble', 'are', 'not', 'justified', 'actions', 'few', 'group', 'have', 'remorse', 'perhaps', 'most', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'twisted', 'individuals', 'films', 'promote', 'sadistic', 'acts', 'part', 'marketing', 'fail', 'deliver', 'Final', 'one', 'actually', 'close', 'reaching', 'cold-hearted', 'sadistic', 'place', 'crossing', 'over', 'gratuitous', 'exploitation', 'cast', 'also', 'Lindsay', 'Seidel', 'Eric', 'Isenhower', 'Justin', 'Arnold', 'Julin', 'writing', 'dialog', 'are', 'quite', 'dreadful', 'gore', 'not', 'done', 'particularly', 'well', 'one', 'party', 'definitely', 'not', 'squeamish']",N/A
