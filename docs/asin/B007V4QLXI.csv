1538463,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B007V4QLXI,Einsatz,"[6, 6]","The title alone promises that this is a crazy/cartoony idea, and thank goodness, it's a comedy.  Filled with puns and referential jokes and a particularly loopy performance by Corin Nemec; I was chuckling throughout.  This is definitely a shark movie that I'm putting in my collection.  What a nutty concept, it's funny and people die in droves!Of course, this movie would be nothing without Corin Nemec's bizarre performance as a ne'er-do-well prodigal son who keeps bouncing into scenes like a manic nincompoop.  His character is pompous, sleazy, pathetic, and a hoot.  He manages the impossible by taking a villainous role and making it strangely endearing.  His life saving technique alone was sadly hilarious.  Then too, there were his off the mark impressions of his dad.  He was a marvel to watch.I applaud the people involved who took a tired retread and made it fresh.  Yes, it's an obvious rip-off of the Jaws formula.  They even have their version of the crusty old shark expert (who has to be heard to be believed!).  But so what, Jaws wasn't funny, this is; therein lies the difference.  Whether you like this movie or not depends entirely on your sense of humor.  If you like things slightly off kilter, you'll love it.  But.  If you can't accept this type of humor, you will wonder what's the point.  You might even find it a tad dumb.  (There are those, however, who highly esteem this type of movie for just those reasons, it's dopey and it's fun.)I'm glad I took a chance and bought it.

However, the movie is decent enough for watching once. If you don't mind watching a cheap B-grade thriller with some pretty bad CGI effects and over the top plots. Then this movie shouldn't disappoint.Corin Nemec (Stargate Sg1) plays Jimmy Green, a slimy businessman who returns to his home, on an island, to propose to the mayor, who happens to be his father, that they can put their island on the map by setting up a weeks event for college kids, something like Cancun/Burning Man etc.. However, there is a problem. It seems the island has a shark problem. Only these sharks are not your average shark. They swim in sand! After killing one shark, they think the island is safe, so 1000's of kids flock to the island, only the party is only just beginning... for the rest of the sand sharks!Expect to see some lame acting here and there, especially by the guy who thinks he is Popeye The Sailor Man, some pretty bad visual effects and an expected lame ending. However, it's not bad enough to turn off, so you can make it to the end, but I doubt you will think the film is a keeper, but check it out once if it interests you.

Being a fan of cheesy creature features, I didn't expect anything but to love this film, and I did.The film opens with two 20-somethings riding dirt bikes in a desert-looking place who soon find themselves falling victim to, well, a sand shark. One of the victims decapitated heads is discovered by what appears to be the only two cops on the small island of White Sand, John Stone (Eric Scott Woods), and his daughter Brenda (Vanessa Evigan). The two ultimately decide it was indeed a shark attack, but because of how far the decapitated head was from the shore makes them question how. Fast forward about 20 minutes later, and the two decide to call in Dr. Sandy Powers (Brooke Hogan), a scientist who specifies in sharks.Because of the lack of tourists on White Sand island, the town's mayor's son, Jimmy (Corin Nemec), who happens to be Brenda's ex-love interest, decides to throw a beach party in hopes that it would revitalize the island.A few shark attacks later, John, Brenda, and Sandy try to prevent the party in fear of more shark attacks, but Jimmy of course ignores their warning, which of course leads to the death of many bad-acting partying college students.Throw in some decent low-budget effects, lame CGI sharks, ridiculous dialogue, and some B-list actors, and what you get is this beautiful gem, otherwise known as Sand Sharks.I was actually surprised at how good the movie was, to be honest. Watching this film, I didn't expect much more than another campy B-movie flick, but this movie seemed to deliver a little bit more than most SyFy-esque films.The characters were very B-movie. You've got the cop with a troubled past, the daughter who isn't over her ex, her heartless ex, and the scientist who is just as clueless as everyone else. To my surprise, these actors weren't too bad for the most part. Yeah, they all had their moments, but how else could you react to a CGI sand shark attacking you?The effects weren't the best I've ever seen, but they definitely weren't the worst, especially for a B-movie, but, how realistic can you get with a low-budget, anyway? The shark was probably the most unrealistic thing about the effects, which is to be expected anyway, and the bright red blood, of course.Overall, you're going to either love this film or you're going to hate it, that all depends on your tolerance for these types of movies. If you're looking to have a good time with a few friends, then this is your movie, but, if you're looking for something serious, you're better off checking out something else.",4,Pure B-Movie Fun,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,2688,"['When', 'coming', 'film', 'called', 'Sand', 'Sharks', 'pretty', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'hate', 'depending', 'how', 'view', 'B-movies', 'Being', 'fan', 'cheesy', 'creature', 'features', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'love', 'film', 'did.The', 'film', 'opens', 'two', '20-somethings', 'riding', 'dirt', 'bikes', 'desert-looking', 'place', 'who', 'soon', 'find', 'falling', 'victim', 'well', 'sand', 'shark', 'One', 'victims', 'decapitated', 'heads', 'discovered', 'what', 'be', 'only', 'two', 'cops', 'small', 'island', 'White', 'Sand', 'John', 'Stone', 'Eric', 'Scott', 'Woods', 'daughter', 'Brenda', 'Vanessa', 'Evigan', 'two', 'ultimately', 'was', 'indeed', 'shark', 'attack', 'how', 'far', 'decapitated', 'head', 'was', 'shore', 'question', 'how', 'Fast', 'forward', '20', 'minutes', 'later', 'two', 'decide', 'call', 'Dr.', 'Sandy', 'Powers', 'Brooke', 'Hogan', 'scientist', 'who', 'sharks.Because', 'lack', 'tourists', 'White', 'Sand', 'island', 'town', 'mayor', 'son', 'Jimmy', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'who', 'be', 'Brenda', 'ex-love', 'interest', 'throw', 'beach', 'party', 'hopes', 'would', 'revitalize', 'island.A', 'few', 'shark', 'attacks', 'later', 'John', 'Brenda', 'Sandy', 'try', 'prevent', 'party', 'fear', 'more', 'shark', 'attacks', 'Jimmy', 'course', 'ignores', 'warning', 'course', 'leads', 'death', 'many', 'bad-acting', 'partying', 'college', 'students.Throw', 'decent', 'low-budget', 'effects', 'lame', 'CGI', 'sharks', 'ridiculous', 'dialogue', 'B-list', 'actors', 'what', 'get', 'beautiful', 'gem', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Sand', 'Sharks.I', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'honest', 'Watching', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'more', 'campy', 'B-movie', 'flick', 'movie', 'seemed', 'deliver', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'most', 'SyFy-esque', 'films.The', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'B-movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'cop', 'troubled', 'past', 'daughter', 'who', ""n't"", 'ex', 'heartless', 'ex', 'scientist', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'clueless', 'everyone', 'else', 'surprise', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'most', 'part', 'Yeah', 'had', 'moments', 'how', 'else', 'could', 'react', 'CGI', 'sand', 'shark', 'attacking', 'effects', 'were', ""n't"", 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'definitely', 'were', ""n't"", 'worst', 'especially', 'B-movie', 'how', 'realistic', 'can', 'get', 'low-budget', 'anyway', 'shark', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'thing', 'effects', 'be', 'expected', 'anyway', 'bright', 'red', 'blood', 'course.Overall', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'hate', 'tolerance', 'types', 'movies', ""'re"", 'looking', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'few', 'friends', 'then', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'serious', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'checking', 'out', 'something', 'else']",N/A
