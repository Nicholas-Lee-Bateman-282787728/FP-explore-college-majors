Finally, someone figured out that making a little money is better than making none at all! Or whatever it took to release the series. When I saw that The Rogues was available, I immediately ordered it, didn't even care about the quality of the copy. But as soon as I fed it into the DVD player and heard that iconic theme music, I was transported back in time. Absolutely terrific! Good quality of the copy (at least the episodes I've enjoyed), good sound, wide screen, and very entertaining.",5,Like finding a lost Treasure,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,584,"['Ever', 'first', 'saw', 'TV', 'series', 'many', 'decades', 'have', 'been', 'searching', 'DVD', 'Finally', 'someone', 'figured', 'out', 'making', 'little', 'money', 'better', 'making', 'none', 'took', 'release', 'series', 'When', 'saw', 'Rogues', 'was', 'available', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'quality', 'copy', 'as', 'soon', 'fed', 'DVD', 'player', 'heard', 'iconic', 'theme', 'music', 'was', 'transported', 'back', 'time', 'Absolutely', 'terrific', 'Good', 'quality', 'copy', 'least', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'good', 'sound', 'wide', 'screen', 'very', 'entertaining']",The Rogues-Volume One-TWO DVD Set-10 Classic Episodes

1408215,A1FDX34BXFXNS8,B004HCAZSO,"Eric Rachut ""Furor teutonicus""","[22, 22]","This was a short-lived (one season, thirty episodes) series about a family of conmen, the chief members of which are played by Gig Young (American branch), David Niven (British) and Charles Boyer (French), with Gladys Cooper as the matriarch and Robert Coote as a British secondary player.  In each case, the mark is a greedy, often dishonest and always unsympathetic character; the interest is in seeing how this otherwise shrewd ""victim"" can be successfully duped.  Ten of the shows are on these DND's and they are of passable quality.  Before now, the only way to see these was to buy German-dubbed versions with English subtitles.  The plots and the acting are excellent - the series won the Golden Globe award - and if you haven't heard of it or seen it since the sixties, you are in for a pleasant experience.",5,AVAILABLE,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,815,"['was', 'short-lived', 'one', 'season', 'thirty', 'episodes', 'series', 'family', 'conmen', 'chief', 'members', 'are', 'played', 'Gig', 'Young', 'American', 'branch', 'David', 'Niven', 'British', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'French', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'matriarch', 'Robert', 'Coote', 'British', 'secondary', 'player', 'case', 'mark', 'greedy', 'often', 'dishonest', 'always', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'interest', 'seeing', 'how', 'otherwise', 'victim', 'can', 'be', 'successfully', 'duped', 'Ten', 'shows', 'are', 'DND', 'are', 'passable', 'quality', 'now', 'only', 'way', 'see', 'was', 'buy', 'German-dubbed', 'versions', 'English', 'subtitles', 'plots', 'acting', 'are', 'excellent', 'series', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'seen', 'sixties', 'are', 'pleasant', 'experience']",The Rogues-Volume One-TWO DVD Set-10 Classic Episodes
1408216,A15C8E35JMSIEY,B004HCAZSO,GA Russell,"[4, 4]","My late dad's two favorite television shows were The Rogues and Mister Peepers.  I had never seen either, so I purchased DVDs of both.The Rogues was broadcast only one season, 1964-65.  It received the Golden Globe Award for Best New Television Series.  Gladys Cooper and Robert Coote were nominated for Best Supporting Actor Golden Globes.The ten episodes in this box are classic television.  Every one makes you laugh when it is over.Each episode is a caper, usually an attempt to swindle a swindler.  I imagine that aficianados of 60s caper movies will particularly appreciate this box.In my view, the real star of the show was Robert Coote who received secondary billing.  He was a talent!Highly recommended.  Too bad a box of the complete series is not available in the US.",5,Classic television,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,778,"['late', 'dad', 'two', 'favorite', 'television', 'shows', 'were', 'Rogues', 'Mister', 'Peepers', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'either', 'purchased', 'DVDs', 'both.The', 'Rogues', 'was', 'broadcast', 'only', 'one', 'season', '1964-65', 'received', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Award', 'Best', 'New', 'Television', 'Series', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'Robert', 'Coote', 'were', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Golden', 'Globes.The', 'ten', 'box', 'are', 'classic', 'television', 'one', 'when', 'over.Each', 'episode', 'caper', 'usually', 'attempt', 'swindle', 'swindler', 'imagine', 'aficianados', '60s', 'caper', 'movies', 'will', 'particularly', 'appreciate', 'box.In', 'view', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'was', 'Robert', 'Coote', 'who', 'received', 'secondary', 'billing', 'was', 'talent', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Too', 'bad', 'box', 'complete', 'series', 'not', 'available', 'US']",The Rogues-Volume One-TWO DVD Set-10 Classic Episodes
1408217,A2TRAK2BJ69HCP,B004HCAZSO,G.H. Morgan,"[0, 0]","The Rogues was an interesting story about good bad guys, as far as I can tell. The formula of the show seems to be a British family that appears to be wealthy by means of stealing.However, though they are thieves they end up robbing from other thieves thus justifying their actions. They travel to exotic places and end up helping others in need with a touch of humor.For something a little different and entertaining, I would highly recommend this.The Rogues-Volume One-TWO DVD Set-10 Classic Episodes",5,The Rogues on DVD.

The writing is superb - even if the characters do not always take themselves seriously.  The  ""Star Power"" is unequallled in any other tv series of the period. I can only assume that it cost so much to produce that they ended production after one season.Ii have recently been watching many different series from this period. Of all the contemporary dramas,  this one has best stood the test of time.  The writing is engaging even after fifty years.I would encourage you to watch a sample episode on you tube - then get the complete series..
