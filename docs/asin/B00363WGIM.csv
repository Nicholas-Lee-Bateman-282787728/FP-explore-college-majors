I used to watch this when I was younger and loved the creepy opening theme song and commentary, listening to that again made me smile. :) These episodes are cheesy but awesome, I love shows like this. :)I honestly don't know what people are talking about when they say the music is totally different and that it ruins the dvd's- unless you're completely obsessed with the show you would never notice, I couldn't tell. If you watched these shows when you were young and loved them and want to buy them to watch them again, you'll never notice any difference in the music?? I think only people who watch the show religiously would notice a difference. The opening theme song is the same so that's all that mattered to me.The only negative (and it's really not a big deal) is that the sound is a little dull so you have to turn your tv up louder than usual and a tiny bit distorted but it's really no big deal to press up on the remote control.I highly recommend all the seasons of Tales From the Darkside, if you loved the show when you were growing up, you'll love these dvd's!",5,Great Show!,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,1106,"['Love', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'used', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'loved', 'creepy', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'commentary', 'listening', 'again', 'made', 'smile', 'episodes', 'are', 'cheesy', 'awesome', 'love', 'shows', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'when', 'say', 'music', 'totally', 'different', ""dvd's-"", ""'re"", 'completely', 'obsessed', 'show', 'would', 'never', 'notice', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'watched', 'shows', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'loved', 'want', 'buy', 'watch', 'again', ""'ll"", 'never', 'notice', 'difference', 'music', 'think', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'religiously', 'would', 'notice', 'difference', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'same', 'mattered', 'me.The', 'only', 'negative', 'really', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'sound', 'little', 'dull', 'have', 'turn', 'tv', 'up', 'louder', 'usual', 'tiny', 'bit', 'distorted', 'really', 'big', 'deal', 'press', 'up', 'remote', 'control.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'seasons', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'loved', 'show', 'when', 'were', 'growing', 'up', ""'ll"", 'love', 'dvd']",N/A
1327160,A1ORZVQS8C1VVT,B00363WGIM,EcoActive,"[7, 8]",This was a great series on a low budget but some of the stories were really great and scary. The one area that was not great was the video quality? Yeah from the 80's but still should have been way better. Extremely soft and have to watch on computer because the big screen really looks fuzzy with these episodes.Agagin their great stories and would still purchase it. I recorded a bunch off tv and they even seem better so not sure how CBS did these.Enjoy....,4,The series that could scare you!,1278460800,"07 7, 2010",2010,460,"['was', 'great', 'series', 'low', 'budget', 'stories', 'were', 'really', 'great', 'scary', 'one', 'area', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'video', 'quality', 'Yeah', '80', 'still', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'better', 'Extremely', 'soft', 'have', 'watch', 'computer', 'big', 'screen', 'really', 'fuzzy', 'episodes.Agagin', 'great', 'stories', 'would', 'still', 'purchase', 'recorded', 'bunch', 'tv', 'even', 'seem', 'better', 'so', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'CBS', 'did', 'these.Enjoy']",N/A

1327162,A3MHZMU0K3X6Q7,B00363WGIM,J. Dollak,"[10, 13]","I occasionally got to see episodes of Tales From the Darkside while I was growing up.  As a kid, the show was unusually creepy.  As an adult, it's not scary at all, but it's charming.  For a TV anthology show, it's pretty good.  Sure, there's nearly no gore, the cast and sets are limited, and there are a few dull episodes.  But the show holds interest pretty well.  The scripts are campy.  There are occasional twists that either obvious, or they're nonsensical.This season has some really nice episodes in it- I enjoyed I Can't Help Saying Goodbye, and The Milkman Cometh (which plays very much like a Twilight Zone episode).There are also some really poorly done episodes.  In particular, Auld Acquaintances is possibly the worst episode I've seen.There's another one, My Own Place, which seems to be a really puzzling episode.  I suspect there was a message to it, but I'm not sure what it was.If you know enough about horror anthology shows to not expect much, you'll probably like this.  It's a charming series.",5,Looking forward to the fourth season release,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1018,"['occasionally', 'got', 'see', 'episodes', 'Tales', 'Darkside', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'kid', 'show', 'was', 'unusually', 'creepy', 'adult', 'not', 'scary', 'charming', 'TV', 'anthology', 'show', 'pretty', 'good', 'Sure', 'nearly', 'gore', 'cast', 'sets', 'are', 'limited', 'are', 'few', 'dull', 'episodes', 'show', 'interest', 'pretty', 'well', 'scripts', 'are', 'campy', 'are', 'occasional', 'twists', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'nonsensical.This', 'season', 'really', 'nice', 'episodes', 'it-', 'enjoyed', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Help', 'Saying', 'Goodbye', 'Milkman', 'Cometh', 'very', 'much', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'are', 'also', 'really', 'poorly', 'done', 'episodes', 'particular', 'Auld', 'Acquaintances', 'possibly', 'worst', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'one', 'My', 'Own', 'Place', 'be', 'really', 'puzzling', 'episode', 'suspect', 'was', 'message', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'know', 'enough', 'horror', 'anthology', 'shows', 'not', 'expect', 'much', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'charming', 'series']",N/A
