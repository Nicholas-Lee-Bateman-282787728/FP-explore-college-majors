If I could see what was happening, I would be able to tell one about it.The film is based as a Korean ghost story, and for one, I am not into ghost stories.  It can be very confusing as to what is the essence of a ghost or what is reality.  Supposedly, with two sisters who go back to their father's house and are met by a step-mother, but one sister is already dead before we realize it. It is bloody, violent, and just plain weird.There is just way too much going on for anyone to grasp the storyline, determine who is who, what is what and why is why?  To me, it is a mess of a film.

882738,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B0007M2374,Ace-of-Stars,"[18, 24]","*The Korean folk tale of ""Rose and Lotus"" has as it's main antagonist that most ubiquitous of all mean-spirited people -- the fearsome & loathsome 'Wicked Step-Mother.' And, consistent with her international sisterhood, the hapless targets of her jealousy-induced maltreatment come in the form of step-'DAUGHTERS' whom she is now forced to accept as new additions to her ""family"" and as new responsibilities in what would normally be her happy & comfortable life.But unlike their Western counterparts, nasty stepmoms in Asian fables tend to be in existing MARITAL RELATIONSHIPS with the fathers of their step-daughters. It is this aspect of the original fable of ""Rose and Lotus"" that makes the story so intense. This is likely the reason why the filmmakers chose to name this film (marketed under the English language title, ""A TALE OF TWO SISTERS"") after that classic Korean tale: ""JANGHWA, HONGRYEON.""Bearing little resemblance to the original story of ""Janghwa & Hongryeon""-- except for the abusive conniving stepmother, the sister pair of who must endure her obvious dislike of having them around, and the weak clueless father --this movie is more of (for lack of a better description) a ""psychological thriller ghost story."" This movie cuts across genres to create a rather unique, and rather involving, piece of film entertainment -- so much so that it is next to impossible to reveal anything about the movie and not run the risk of revealing too much.Our 'stepmom' in the story is a (former? current?) nurse who appears to be ""certifiable,"" if you know what I mean, and it makes the viewer wonder what in the world ""Dad"" could have possibly seen in this woman that would make him want to dissolve his marriage to his children's mother (a reserved, quiet, almost invisible woman) in favor of a borderline straightjacket case. We are not given any explanation as to why ""Dr. Dad"" chose to end his marriage with his wife, but the cad could have at least had class enough to not to... well... I'll just have to let you see for yourself to understand and appreciate on your own. And the other two women in Dad's life-- his daughters Soo-Mi and Soo-Yeon (which I'm told also mean 'rose' and 'lotus' but I cannot yet confirm this) --are none too happy about his decision to ditch their beloved mom for the invading & imposing new hussy (but what can two young teenaged girls do about it?).The movie offers several shocking surprise revelations in big ways, so that once the first major and startling secret is revealed you expect that the film would soon begin wrapping itself up -- but then comes the next big reveal -- then the next -- then the next! So all the while, as you thought the story simply couldn't drag out the drama any more, the climaxes come fast & furious one on top of the other! Granted, they are still relatively mellow by Western standards, but they are not intended to get your adrenaline pumping: they are intended to put your brain in gear and have you do some mental sleuthing, which is one of the beauties of this film -- combining tense scenes and a few scares with thought-provoking analysis!The cover imagery used is very misleading (don't go looking for a lot of blood & splatter, because there isn't any), but if you appreciate movies that can manipulate your fears while at the same time forcing you to think & draw some of your own conclusions (because not everything is 'tidied-up' at the end, but leaves just enough for the viewers to play around with), then this is a film that will appeal to you.

The story is chilling and scary, the acting is wonderful, and the country house setting is exquisitely creepy.  I recommend this movie wholeheartedly, but here's the caveat: most Asian horror is an acquired taste for western viewers, and this is no exception.  If you are willing to invest the time to think about the story (I had to watch it twice to understand everything) then you'll be rewarded.  It's the kind of movie that will stay with you for years, and there's always a new detail to add to the scariness.A non-spoiler plot summary:  Su-Mi and her sister Su-Yeon come home to discover that they have a new stepmother; the beautiful and icy Eun-Joo isn't overly thrilled to have the girls around, and Su-Mi must protect her weaker little sister against Eun-Joo's casual cruelty.  The family home, deep in the countryside, is haunted by several ghosts and Su-Mi grows more and more frantic in her efforts to defeat the wicked stepmother and save Su-Yeon.  The last 15 minutes leave viewers reeling from revelation after revelation about what actually happened, and continues to happen, in the house.I know that a lot of viewers get frustrated with the jumble of non-linear events and I wish there was an easy way to explain the chronology without ruining the story.  There are several very good discussions floating around the internet, if you feel like you missed the point.And if this doesn't sound like a movie you'd like but you're interested in other Asian horror flicks, try Cello (also Korean) or the Eye (Hong Kong)--both great movies, but much more straightforward.",5,Best Asian horror...but an acquired taste,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,1666,"[""'re"", 'fan', 'Asian', 'horror', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'story', 'chilling', 'scary', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'country', 'house', 'setting', 'exquisitely', 'creepy', 'recommend', 'movie', 'wholeheartedly', 'here', 'caveat', 'most', 'Asian', 'horror', 'acquired', 'taste', 'western', 'viewers', 'exception', 'are', 'willing', 'invest', 'time', 'think', 'story', 'had', 'watch', 'twice', 'understand', 'everything', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'years', 'always', 'new', 'detail', 'add', 'scariness.A', 'non-spoiler', 'plot', 'summary', 'Su-Mi', 'sister', 'Su-Yeon', 'come', 'home', 'discover', 'have', 'new', 'stepmother', 'beautiful', 'icy', 'Eun-Joo', ""n't"", 'overly', 'thrilled', 'have', 'girls', 'Su-Mi', 'must', 'protect', 'weaker', 'little', 'sister', 'Eun-Joo', 'casual', 'cruelty', 'family', 'home', 'deep', 'countryside', 'haunted', 'several', 'ghosts', 'Su-Mi', 'grows', 'more', 'more', 'frantic', 'efforts', 'defeat', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'save', 'Su-Yeon', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'leave', 'viewers', 'reeling', 'revelation', 'revelation', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'happen', 'house.I', 'know', 'lot', 'viewers', 'get', 'frustrated', 'jumble', 'non-linear', 'events', 'wish', 'was', 'easy', 'way', 'explain', 'chronology', 'ruining', 'story', 'are', 'several', 'very', 'good', 'discussions', 'floating', 'internet', 'feel', 'missed', 'point.And', ""n't"", 'sound', 'movie', ""'d"", 'like', ""'re"", 'interested', 'other', 'Asian', 'horror', 'flicks', 'try', 'Cello', 'also', 'Korean', 'Eye', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'great', 'movies', 'much', 'more', 'straightforward']",N/A

It defies categorization, and it is certainly not what you want to watch if you are looking for a night of light horror-splatter entertainment. The movie, though, IS creepy. Indeed, it's one of the creepiest movies I ever saw, probably beaten only by Alien, Carpenter's The Thing, and a few others.Acting is superb, and the two ""sisters"", young as they are, are incredibly believable in their roles. The performance of Yeom Jeong-ah, who plays the ""evil"" stepmother, is incredible as well. The director and screenwriter, in my humble opinion, is a genius. This is not a movie that you want to rent in  videocassette. The cinematography is SUPERB, and you NEED to watch this movie on a good screen, without lights on. Not because the movie is scary, but because light and color are used masterfully, and you do not want to miss a detail.One astonishing aspect of this masterpiece is the use of color. With few rare (green) exceptions, blue and red are the vastly dominant colors. The colors, indeed, seem to be one of the major characters in the story.Last but not least, as many other reviewers have pointed out, this is not your typical ""horror"" movie with ghosts & monsters. This is as much about ghosts as about the way the human mind copes with inconceivable tragedies. Indeed, different viewers will probably disagree on the true meaning of the conclusion.

882748,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B0007M2374,Anticlimacus,"[1, 2]","This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made. I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making. It's practically perfect in all of them - a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.""The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema. I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute. Quite literally, Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels. A seemingly insignificant object may be shown - a rack of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack, a bottle of pills, etc. - but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more - a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene (or perhaps the movie in total), which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront. Such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie, but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a rapid-fire, relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness, lest they miss something important. In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this? It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summarized by Zaphod B Goode on IMDb, who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent, unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. He posits that Ji-woon Kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that. In reality, however, nothing could be further from the truth. A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the EXACT occurrences of each and every scene of the film. If our good friend Zaphod had been paying attention, he would have noticed - for example - the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's assertion of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them. Can Ji-woon Kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film? I think not.Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod that cannot ""get"" A Tale of Two Sisters, because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence. The movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You need only put them together. Remember, the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind - he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that - when completed - bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe.Don't misunderstand me. There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. A Tale of Two Sisters is not. It's ironic that Zaphod claims Darko to be more masterfully constructed than A Tale of Two Sisters, especially considering that Darko not only provides almost NO objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich&eacute; that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence. I'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence, but the contrast is an important one. Although it does perplex me that Zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort. He apparently likes his ""intelligent"" films in the most superficial form possible. This is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself. Just read the threads by Opiemar within the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned OBVIOUS.Just watch it.

""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is very beautiful, accurately-paced, thrilling and magic picture. The plot is rather complicated and I can tell only the beginning: two sisters return to their father and stepmother from a mental home. Everyone is acting rather strange - one of the sisters is very timid and browbeaten, the other one is impudent and brash. Father is self-contained and we can not understand what's on his mind. Stepmom seems way over happy for her stepdaughters' arrival but later we see everything is not exactly as it seems. Soon some strange thing begin to happen in the house...Movie's events are intricate and it's possible that after watching it you'd want to watch it for the second time to understand all.

882752,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0007M2374,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[6, 10]","`A Tale of Two Sisters' by Korean director, Kim Jee-Woon is a deeply psychological horror movie very much in the tradition of `The Shining', `The Sixth Sense' and Alfred Hitchcock's best work where the basis of the horror is almost entirely in the mind of either the victim (`The Sixth Sense') or the perp (`The Shining'). This is not to say there is no suggestion of supernatural agent, but this agent is very much in the background, pulling the strings of the deranged / possessed human agent.The $64 question about this movie is whether the unraveling of the story is gloriously subtle or simply obscure. Before answering that question, I will affirm that the director and his technical support crew went to great lengths in their blocking and framing shots to achieve exactly the effect they wanted to come across on the screen. Even so mundane a detail as the wallpaper on the set representing the interior of the family house is done with great care, to the point where they were even proud of the fact that the wallpaper featured in the title sequence was based on a English 19th century William Morris design. The evidence of the care taken in laying out the movie is mostly in the numerous commentaries and `making of' features among the extras. Whether the end result is a masterwork of subtlety or a gallant failure, the extras are a fine contribution to an understanding of several aspects of filmmaking.I am almost certain that `The Sixth Sense' was a major influence on this film's writer / director. The clearest homage to that film is in the prominent place of red in the two sisters' clothes in the opening scenes of the film and in the red fruits found on the house property, on the girls' way to the boat dock. This `homage' is even more obvious when you hear how much care the art director took in planing the design and colors in each scene.The most important fact about the plot is that the older sister suffers from a multiple personality disorder. One sees in the very first scene that she suffers from some kind of psychopathology, but it is not clear what it is. The kicker is that the multiple personalities are represented on the screen by different actors!!! On my first viewing, I thought it odd that two, and maybe even three of the actors looked so much alike. Major casting decisions are often made in order to distinguish the appearance of one character from the other. But on discovering from the commentary that these three actors are really representing three aspects of the same person, all this became clear.One of the most marvelous things about `The Sixth Sense' is how it played out it's main secret in plain sight and revealed the secret at the end of the movie in such a way that everything fell into place in an instant. That moment of `clicking' never happened in this movie. I suspect that is because the actions caused by the hidden facts of the character(s) did not really hold together that well. We did not see a jigsaw puzzle where we are unable to identify the picture until the last piece is laid into place, whereupon all things become clear and all the threads come together in our understanding.I don't think the failure was due to a lack of skill, but due to excess ambition. The auteur was reaching beyond his grasp and he tried to do too much in one movie. The multiple personality plot is complicated by the addition of some kind of spirit or ghost in the house whose part in the plot is simply not very well integrated.I have not seen any of Kim Jee-Woon's other films, but the evidence of this one make me want to see him improve in his craft, as he has an overabundance of talent for marshaling all the different crafts which go into making a movie. He just needs to focus a bit more to heighten the audience's final `Ah Ha' epiphany of understanding.Hidden meaning does not necessarily make a movie bad, as long as the context in which the search for meaning captures the imagination. The meaning behind `2001' took me at least five viewings to unravel to my satisfaction, but the journey was so well furnished with eye candy and both plausible and interesting twists in the plot that the search itself was rewarding. What ruins a movie is loose ends and dangling improbabilities.If you are a student of film or are looking for something different, this movie is especially rewarding. It's hidden meanings, deep film technique, and convoluted plot will keep you watching it many times over. If you like your horror obvious, stick with Wes Craven, George Romero, and John Carpenter.",4,Excellent Filmmaking and Acting.

A deeply moving character drama at heart, A TALE OF TWO SISTERS is made most effective by Su-jeong Lim and Geun-Young Moon's touching performances. Jung-ah Yum is equally impressive as the girls' wicked stepmother, whose incredible range allows her to deceive the audience from the very start. Director Ji-woon Kim is a master of his medium, displaying a complete control over the light, color, texture, and mood of his film. The elegant score continues to accentuate the underlying emotion as well. Kim introduces a strong symbolism, primarily through his use of the color red as a central motif to foreshadow future events. Each of the subtle elements in the film lead up to shocking but well played reveal that is sure to astonish its audiences. A TALE OF TWO SISTERS therefore benefits from repeated viewings in order for the viewer to truly appreciate the craftsmanship that went into the intricately designed finale.

Scream was huge so we got 2 sequels, Urban Legend, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The remake of the Ring was successful so we got that one, its sequel, Pulse, Dark Water and apparently there's more coming. Being incredibly disappointed with the recent wave of horror which emphasize gore over creepiness, I started to check out the so-called J(or K)-Horror wave of movies. Hearing great things about this film, I walked in thinking I wasn't going to be able to sleep but instead you get a rich character based story that so happens to have creepy elements.Su-Mi and Su-yeon are sisters who return home after their mother has died. They live with their father and step-mother who's less than welcoming to the girls. Things seem fine if a bit too quiet and uncomfortable when strange things start happening around the house. This is just the backdrop though for the tension between the girls and their step-mother and figuring out how they all are connected and what the deeper story is becomes the main focus.When I meant with ""walked in with one thing.."" is I basically thought this was going to be one big out-and-out creepfest like this thing was one of the most scariest and creepiest things you'll see. Instead, I find a film with a slow moving plot, lots of characterization and ""actor"" moments and very few big-time creep moments. Now that doesn't mean that this wouldn't creep out someone else and outright scare them but for me it was a different kind of horror as it was more psychological based rather than big scares one right after the other.One thing I will admit though is the film's certainly gorgeous with big bold colors, an unsettling atmosphere and well composed shots. It's probably one of the better ""shot"" horror films I've seen since there's a certain artistry to it all and not just simply filming stuff. With this, there's always something to watch and study. Acting-wise it's top form too and it's strange seeing foreign actors do big emotional parts that don't become show-y whereas American actors here almost have an ""Oscar mode"" scene where they yell as loud as they can (which from now on, I'm referring to as ""Sean Penn syndrome"").Is it a film worth picking up? Definately but keep in mind it's probably not your typical idea of ""horror"" with jump scares every 10 minutes.

Like most Asian horror that we're becoming inundated with these days, ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" takes atmospheric creepiness and suspense to an extreme level, but, leaves you at the end wondering what exactly WAS the story you just saw.After reading a few of the reviews here, I've learned I should have watched the film again with commentary, and maybe it would have made more sense, but, as it was, when the credits rolled I felt unfulfilled. Where this film succeeds however, is through its visuals and pacing. The film is not awash in gore as many American films are, which results in having the scenes that do show blood be that much more unnerving. Also like many Asian horror films, the pacing in some places gets quite slow, forcing you to watch the nearly silent movie interaction between the characters, which isn't always a bad thing.My biggest regret about this film is that the montage at the end, which is supposedly meant to leave the viewer with some sense of insight into what had REALLY happened....but it created more questions than it answered.... to the point that even the next day my girlfriend and I were still saying, ""But... that one part still doesn't make sense....""",4,Don't let my star rating fool you.....,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,1747,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'rating', 'fool', 'film', '5', 'Stars', 'pacing', 'filming', '5', 'stars', 'acting', 'only', '2', 'plot', 'storytelling', 'So', '4', 'Stars', 'overall.Young', 'Su-Mi', 'even', 'younger', 'sister', 'Su-Yeon', 'return', 'home', 'father', 'abusive', 'stepmother', 'being', 'hospitalized', 'mental', 'institution', 'following', 'death', 'biological', 'mother.From', 'movie', 'confusing', 'path', 'where', 'realize', 'house', 'haunted', 'more', 'just', 'memories', 'dead', 'mother', 'bizarre', 'happenings', 'begin', 'slowly', 'pile', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'Asian', 'horror', ""'re"", 'becoming', 'inundated', 'days', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'atmospheric', 'creepiness', 'suspense', 'extreme', 'level', 'end', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'WAS', 'story', 'just', 'saw.After', 'reading', 'few', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'should', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'commentary', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'was', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'felt', 'unfulfilled', 'Where', 'film', 'however', 'visuals', 'pacing', 'film', 'not', 'awash', 'gore', 'many', 'American', 'films', 'are', 'results', 'having', 'scenes', 'do', 'show', 'blood', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'unnerving', 'Also', 'many', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'pacing', 'places', 'quite', 'slow', 'forcing', 'watch', 'nearly', 'silent', 'movie', 'interaction', 'characters', ""n't"", 'always', 'bad', 'thing.My', 'biggest', 'regret', 'film', 'montage', 'end', 'supposedly', 'meant', 'leave', 'viewer', 'sense', 'insight', 'what', 'had', 'REALLY', 'happened', '.but', 'created', 'more', 'questions', 'answered', 'point', 'even', 'next', 'day', 'girlfriend', 'were', 'still', 'saying', 'one', 'part', 'still', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense']",N/A

Cleverly mixing elements of sincere drama and gut-wrenching horror, writer/director Ji-woon Kim hand delivers one of the most beautifully done horror films of recent years.  Everything from the set pieces to the orchestral arrangements is designed to evoke fear in the viewer, but everything is glossed over with a sense of sadness and sheer compassion for the films victims, a sense of confusion and earnest longing for answers that makes this a far different experience than most American made horror films...this one has heart.Asian horror films are probably best known for their graphic use of `shock-horror', complete with strange and almost satanic depictions of abuse, murder and torture...but `A Tale of Two Sisters' is deeper than that.  There are some startling scenes and some gore albeit mild, but it's more complex than it is horrific.  This is a deeply unsettling story that unfolds as the clock ticks; it's not just a random collage of blood and guts.The film follows two sisters, Soo-mi (Su-jeong Lim, brilliant acting!!!) and her younger sister Soo-yeon (Geun-yeon Mun) as they return home after a stay at the hospital.  The viewer is immediately made aware of their lack of enthusiasm for their current situation.  Their father is reclusive and their step-mother Eun-joo (Jung-ah Yum) is somewhat schizophrenic, one minute overly excited and nice and the next downright cruel and domineering.  Soo-mi is the overprotective sister, and she immediately begins butting heads with her stepmother in regards to her treatment of Soo-yeon, but there's more to it than that, and as the sun falls and the nighttime arrives things happen in that house that would drive anyone mad.Expertly crafted from a Korean fairy-tale (I thought fairy-tales were supposed to be happy), `A Tale of Two Sisters' is bound to scare you witless and keep you guessing.  It's surprising that Hollywood hasn't decided to Americanize this one, but I hope they don't for the raw texture that exists in this film is bound to be lost in a glossy remake.

882760,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0007M2374,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[6, 9]","Of the wave of Korean horror that's come out, A Tale of Two Sisters comes out tops over the high school horror trilogy (Whispering Corridors, Memento Mori, and Wishing Stairs) and the Korean version of the Ring.  That's because elements of madness, psychology, and dramatic tragedy of the Bae family emerge to make it more than just a simple horror film.Two young sisters, Bae Su-Mi and Bae Su-Yeon (pronounced Suyonee), return to their nice large lakeside home after a stint at a mental hospital, where they are greeted by Eun-Joo, their new stepmother.  Initially portrayed as being a bit too cheery, Eun-Joo is pretty harsh.  Their father, Bae Mu-Hyun, a quiet bespectacled man, though worried about Su-Mi, seems quite powerless.  He even admits to Su-Mi that she must be angry at him for being such a bad father.As siblings, Su-Mi is clearly the more dominant and more talkative one, emerging as the protective older sister of the shyer Su-Yeon.  Su-Mi is resentful at the way Eun-Joo tries to insert herself into their home.  One conflict emerges when Su-Mi puts her father's folded pajamas on his bed.  Eun-Joo, who later carries another set of PJ's, is a bit taken back, but reminds her stepdaughter that the clothes is her job now.Part of that is that Su-Mi still misses her late mother, as evidenced when she goes to the warehouse and brings back a box of her mother's possessions, including old photos.  A brief but wonderful scene is where the normally placid Su-Yeon becomes animated when seeing the box's contents.  However, when Su-Mi discovers marks on Su-Yeon's wrists, she gets angry and acts against her stepmother, which accelerates hostilities between her and Eun-Joo to the point that someone is lugging a bloody bag that could fit a human being within.Indeed, it looks like Eun-Joo is the wicked stepmother, as in a rage, she locks poor Su-Yeon in the wardrobe.  But when Myu-Hyong's relatives come over for dinner, Eun-Joo acts like a manic basketcase, telling an anecdote about a man who took off his clothes whenever it rained, and cracking up, to which the relatives stare at her in stony silence.  Is that why Mu-Hyun gives Eun Joo some medication?But it's more than that, as there is a ghostly presence in the house, which causes to have Mi-Hee, Mu-Hyun's sister-in-law, a raging fit.  Su-Yeon is frightened by strange thumping sounds from the hallway and someone opening her door.  And there is the by now much-used visual of the woman with long black hair covering her face in a nightmarish sequence.There are not one but two twists that necessitates one to think back to what has transpired and subsequently, to watch the movie a second time to see what actually happened.  Both of them are double whammys that rival the revelations seen in say, The Sixth Sense, The Others, and The Usual Suspects.  One clues is something Eun-Joo says at the dinner table to her guests--""our mum.""The troika of female actresses really make this film work.  Yeom Jeong-A as the temperamental Eun-Joo does great work here, playing a woman on the edge trying to validate her authority in a new household, as does Im Soo-Joong as Su-mi, who sees herself as the proper successor to her late mother.

882761,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007M2374,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 6]","A Tale of Two Sisters is billed as a horror movie, but please don't confuse this fascinating, multi-layered story with the sort of simple-minded horror films coming out of Hollywood.  The stigma attached to horror movies in the West doesn't apply when you talk about Asian horror - solely because Asian filmmakers continue to develop horror as an art form built upon subtlety, complexity, and the deepest of human emotions.  A Tale of Two Sisters is high art indeed.  There are some genuinely creepy scenes in this movie, but that is not where the true horror of the story lies - and that is what makes this such a mesmerizing movie.This isn't a simple tale, as it starts you out feeling a little unbalanced and compels you to figure out what is really going on as reality and fantasy begin to blur more and more.  You might be confused at more than one point.  And then, once you've had your Aha moment, the film continues to pull you down dark, twisted paths.  This is truly an unforgettable film that virtually compels you to watch it through a second time.  Then, if you still have questions, there are two distinct commentaries on the DVD (I only watched the one with the director and the actresses who played the two sisters - but it was everything a commentary should be).When you see this film - and you really should see it - it's important that you leave your Westernized expectations behind you.  This isn't about things that go bump in the night - although, as I've said, several scenes are deliciously creepy.  This is a tragic and exceedingly human story about the love between two sisters, terrible events that shatter the lives of their whole family, and the debilitating effect that regret can have on a person.  I am not even going to describe the plot of the film here because it should be seen without any expectations by the viewer.  The film is so complex and beautifully structured that every little thing that happens is important.  That's why a second viewing leaves you even more impressed than you were after the first viewing.  Kim Jee-Woon is a true craftsman of the art of moviemaking, and young Su-jeong Lim and Geun-yeong Mun are really quite amazing in their portrayal of the tragic sisters.Some seem to find the film too confusing, and I'm not sure why this is.  It's true that the story invokes flashbacks at times, but there are plenty of clues along the way - and the main revelations are quite forcefully presented.  In a sense, the movie moves forward in order to take you backward, back to a beginning in which all things are made clear.  It's a rich and amazingly moving way to tell a story, especially when that story resonates with as much emotional power as this one.",5,A creepy masterpiece that resonates with emotional power,1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,2711,"['Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'billed', 'horror', 'movie', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'fascinating', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'sort', 'simple-minded', 'horror', 'films', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'stigma', 'attached', 'horror', 'movies', 'West', ""n't"", 'apply', 'when', 'talk', 'Asian', 'horror', 'solely', 'Asian', 'filmmakers', 'continue', 'develop', 'horror', 'art', 'form', 'built', 'subtlety', 'complexity', 'deepest', 'human', 'emotions', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'high', 'art', 'indeed', 'are', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'movie', 'not', 'where', 'true', 'horror', 'story', 'what', 'such', 'mesmerizing', 'movie.This', ""n't"", 'simple', 'tale', 'out', 'feeling', 'little', 'unbalanced', 'compels', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'begin', 'blur', 'more', 'more', 'might', 'be', 'confused', 'more', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'once', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Aha', 'moment', 'film', 'pull', 'down', 'dark', 'twisted', 'paths', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'virtually', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'Then', 'still', 'have', 'questions', 'are', 'two', 'distinct', 'commentaries', 'DVD', 'only', 'watched', 'one', 'director', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'two', 'sisters', 'was', 'everything', 'commentary', 'should', 'be', '.When', 'see', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'important', 'leave', 'Westernized', 'expectations', ""n't"", 'about', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', ""'ve"", 'said', 'several', 'scenes', 'are', 'deliciously', 'creepy', 'tragic', 'exceedingly', 'human', 'story', 'love', 'two', 'sisters', 'terrible', 'events', 'shatter', 'lives', 'whole', 'family', 'debilitating', 'effect', 'regret', 'can', 'have', 'person', 'am', 'not', 'even', 'going', 'describe', 'plot', 'film', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'expectations', 'viewer', 'film', 'so', 'complex', 'beautifully', 'structured', 'little', 'thing', 'important', 'why', 'second', 'viewing', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'were', 'first', 'viewing', 'Kim', 'Jee-Woon', 'true', 'craftsman', 'art', 'moviemaking', 'young', 'Su-jeong', 'Lim', 'Geun-yeong', 'Mun', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'amazing', 'portrayal', 'tragic', 'sisters.Some', 'seem', 'find', 'film', 'too', 'confusing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'true', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'times', 'are', 'plenty', 'clues', 'way', 'main', 'revelations', 'are', 'quite', 'forcefully', 'presented', 'sense', 'movie', 'forward', 'order', 'take', 'backward', 'back', 'beginning', 'things', 'are', 'made', 'clear', 'rich', 'amazingly', 'moving', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'especially', 'when', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'emotional', 'power', 'one']",N/A

There's also tragedy in this family's past that is not mentioned but slowly unearths until it explodes to the surface.

882764,A1COAX8KHFQHE3,B0007M2374,David Roth,"[3, 4]","A Tale of Two Sisters is one of the most beautifully gripping movies I have seen a very long time. It is the tale of a family who is reunited when their daughters return home. However they aren't a happy family. The two girls have never accepted their step-mother into the family and are often at odds with her and this emotional conflict is really the focal point of the whole story.Let me say this right now, the film is catagorized as a horror movie, but it is more of a psychological horror. I know I'm being nit-picky but there is a huge difference in expectations between the two. The art direction and visuals (along with some superb performances from the cast) sets the stage for a twisting tale that will have you questioning what is really going on inside of this house. Things just don't seem right, and in all honesty, don't expect to figure it out in one sitting. After watching the film I had several guesses, but it wasn't until finishing my third viewing that I think I have finally come to the definitive solution, but I'm not gonna get into that, that would spoil the whole fun.Perhaps that is part of the charm of the movie. Like many other Asian Horror/Psychological Horror films, everything is not spelled out for you. There are a lot of blanks that are left for the viewer to piece together. One of the most amusing things is coming up with a solution and then rewatching the movie, only to have to reconfigure your ideas.As I stated earlier the performance of the cast is what really steals the movie. Primarilly that of the step-mother and eldest daugther (Yeon Jeong-ah and Su-Jeong Lim respectively). Yeon portrays the step mother in such a way that you will hate her in one scene and than no more than five minutes later feel genuinely sorry for her situation. It is the performances of the actors that make the whole movie come together.While the movie does have its share of jumpy moments, it is primarilly a psychological mind game between you and the movie. So for those of you who love a great tale of mystery and drama (and enjoy the freedom to figure out what really happened for yourself) I cannot recommend another movie more than this. Even if you aren't a fan on foreign film and subtitles, you should still strongly consider giving this film a chance. If not, you'll have to wait until the American remake is released in a couple of years (and we all know that won't be nearly as good....).",5,The best movie I have seen in a long time...,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,2429,"['Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'gripping', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'tale', 'family', 'who', 'reunited', 'when', 'daughters', 'return', 'home', 'However', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'family', 'two', 'girls', 'have', 'never', 'accepted', 'step-mother', 'family', 'are', 'often', 'odds', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'really', 'focal', 'point', 'whole', 'story.Let', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'film', 'catagorized', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'psychological', 'horror', 'know', ""'m"", 'being', 'nit-picky', 'huge', 'difference', 'expectations', 'two', 'art', 'direction', 'visuals', 'superb', 'performances', 'cast', 'stage', 'twisting', 'tale', 'will', 'have', 'questioning', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'inside', 'house', 'Things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'honesty', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'sitting', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'several', 'guesses', 'was', ""n't"", 'finishing', 'third', 'viewing', 'think', 'have', 'finally', 'come', 'definitive', 'solution', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'get', 'would', 'spoil', 'whole', 'fun.Perhaps', 'part', 'charm', 'movie', 'many', 'other', 'Asian', 'Horror/Psychological', 'Horror', 'films', 'everything', 'not', 'spelled', 'out', 'are', 'lot', 'blanks', 'are', 'left', 'viewer', 'piece', 'together', 'One', 'most', 'amusing', 'things', 'coming', 'up', 'solution', 'then', 'rewatching', 'movie', 'only', 'have', 'reconfigure', 'ideas.As', 'stated', 'earlier', 'performance', 'cast', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'Primarilly', 'step-mother', 'eldest', 'daugther', 'Yeon', 'Jeong-ah', 'Su-Jeong', 'Lim', 'respectively', 'Yeon', 'step', 'mother', 'such', 'way', 'will', 'hate', 'one', 'scene', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'later', 'feel', 'genuinely', 'sorry', 'situation', 'performances', 'actors', 'make', 'whole', 'movie', 'come', 'movie', 'have', 'share', 'jumpy', 'moments', 'primarilly', 'psychological', 'mind', 'game', 'movie', 'So', 'who', 'love', 'great', 'tale', 'mystery', 'drama', 'enjoy', 'freedom', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'more', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'foreign', 'film', 'subtitles', 'should', 'still', 'strongly', 'consider', 'giving', 'film', 'chance', 'not', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'American', 'remake', 'released', 'couple', 'years', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'as', 'good']",N/A

I was expecting it to be a type of slasher film (the bloody family portrait is misleading) thank goodness it wasn't. It was genuinely scary and creepy. The house was as much a character as the human players, hiding and shielding from the outside all the secrets that lay within it's walls. It's a tragic story of loss and revenge. Though there is a side story of possible ghosts existing with the family, the main focus is the relationship between the family members, especially between the wicked step-mother and her step daughters.While the story focuses on the present, we are given flashes of what happened prior and how the family broke apart. The two sisters are now living in the house with their distant and cluelessly, remorseful father and his new wife, who doesn't seem all together right in the head herself. We are not given exact answers as for what happened in the past but are left to use our imagination on several points of interest.(Possible spoilers) We are briefly given clues that the girls' mother may have been sick (mentally?) and that a nurse (who became the new wife) was brought into the house by the father to help take care of his wife. It is suggested an affair happened and the father chose his lover over his wife. The ex-wife then dies, the daughters go crazy and end up in a mental hospital while the father marries his lover.This is what is portrayed on screen, but two surprise twists shatter that image and changes everything.What you see is not all that lurks beneath the facade of this horror snow white tale. There are twists and turns and shocks that leave you with that tingly eerie feeling. It's not a horror story in the traditional sense of the word, but a horror does exist, and it nearly impossible to run away from. This is the kind of film that required a few viewings before you can get a real sense of the story, but you won't regret seeing more than once. It's a lot to take in a single viewing.(Spoiler)As for the ghost(s), yes there is one or possible two and they do play an important role in the story. But the focus is on the two sisters and the new life fate has dealt them.I enjoyed it more than Ringu, which had been my favorite Asian horror film until now.

There's something of Polanski's ""Repulsion"" here, and of other Asian ghost story movies. There are many very creepy sequences, and the movie is very well acted and edited. ""Sisters"" is also beautifully photographed and directed. Indeed, the last image is one of the most poignant you will ever see in any movie, in the way it parallels an image from the opening minutes of the film, and is certainly among the most moving images I've seen in any horror film. The score is unusual for a horror movie, often being dominated by acoustic guitar that reminded me of European art cinema. The music is oddly appropriate, though, and helps convey the strong sense of  pathos which runs throughout the film.The story does become difficult to follow in the last third or so of the movie.

How did Su-Yeon really die? What was the relationship between the father and the stepmother before the real mom died? It was implied that they were having an affair, but it's unclear.

Well, when it's this good, how could you not be? A Tale of Two Sisters is a complex, deeply troubling work that takes it's time to draw you in to its'characters lives before turning the inevitable screw and the wait is intoxicating.The story centers around two young sisters(gorgeuosly brought to life by Su-joeng Lim and Guen-yeong Mun) returning home from what is never actually said but can only be a mental institution. As they rediscover their home, we are brought achingly carefully into their world. The house they live in is imposing,unwelcoming and cold... it sooon becomes clear that the house is an extension of their parents. Their father is a distant, introverted man who walks through the house seemingly without notice or care for much and their stepmother (Jung-ah Yum-introduced in a gleefully funny and at the same time bizarre and disturbing entrance) so overdoes the maternal that it becomes clear quite quickly that she is hiding something dark. Thats really about all I can say without giving too much away except that as the story unfolds and realities begin to merge or break apart completly, the horror starts to introduce itself as well.Calling this a ghost story is like calling Moby Dick a story about a big fish. Of course there are some great scare moments, but what impressed me was the atmosophere, the buidup and the characters. The house itself I have to mention again, mirroring the cold of the father and at the same time the surface ""aren't we a happy family"" obessive evil that lurks inside the heart of the stepmother, providing a setting that so becomes a part of the story it becomes a character itself. Of course it would just be an empty shell without characters to fill it and all actors here do beautiful work. Watchers of horror movies quickly become accustomed to cookie -cutter characters and mock relationships so when we find a movie with real people to care for, it heightens everything to a level beyond mere jump scares. And once we care for the main protagonists, it makes it that much harder to see it all fall apart in an extrmely heart-wrenching climax. Again, I can't go further.You'll appreciate why I can't say more whe you see it, but just make sure you know that this film is so much more than an old-run-of-the-mill twisting turning ghost fable that if you knew how it was going to end up it wouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this engrossing movie 1 iota.",5,A tale of intense recommendation,1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,2556,"['So', 'here', 'have', 'yet', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'movie', 'possible', 'still', 'be', 'intrigued', 'what', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'norm', 'horror', 'cinema', 'Well', 'when', 'good', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'complex', 'deeply', 'troubling', 'work', 'time', 'draw', ""its'characters"", 'lives', 'turning', 'inevitable', 'screw', 'wait', 'intoxicating.The', 'story', 'centers', 'two', 'young', 'sisters', 'gorgeuosly', 'brought', 'life', 'Su-joeng', 'Lim', 'Guen-yeong', 'Mun', 'returning', 'home', 'what', 'never', 'actually', 'said', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'mental', 'institution', 'rediscover', 'home', 'are', 'brought', 'achingly', 'carefully', 'world', 'house', 'live', 'imposing', 'unwelcoming', 'cold', 'becomes', 'clear', 'house', 'extension', 'parents', 'father', 'distant', 'introverted', 'man', 'who', 'house', 'seemingly', 'notice', 'care', 'much', 'stepmother', 'Jung-ah', 'Yum-introduced', 'gleefully', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'bizarre', 'disturbing', 'entrance', 'so', 'maternal', 'clear', 'quite', 'quickly', 'hiding', 'something', 'dark', 'Thats', 'really', 'can', 'say', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'except', 'story', 'unfolds', 'realities', 'begin', 'merge', 'break', 'apart', 'completly', 'horror', 'introduce', 'well.Calling', 'ghost', 'story', 'calling', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'story', 'big', 'fish', 'course', 'are', 'great', 'scare', 'moments', 'what', 'impressed', 'was', 'atmosophere', 'buidup', 'characters', 'house', 'have', 'mention', 'again', 'mirroring', 'cold', 'father', 'same', 'time', 'surface', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'family', 'obessive', 'evil', 'heart', 'stepmother', 'providing', 'setting', 'so', 'part', 'story', 'character', 'course', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'empty', 'shell', 'characters', 'fill', 'actors', 'here', 'do', 'beautiful', 'work', 'Watchers', 'horror', 'movies', 'quickly', 'become', 'accustomed', 'cookie', '-cutter', 'characters', 'mock', 'relationships', 'so', 'when', 'find', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'care', 'everything', 'level', 'mere', 'jump', 'scares', 'once', 'care', 'main', 'protagonists', 'much', 'harder', 'see', 'fall', 'apart', 'extrmely', 'heart-wrenching', 'climax', 'Again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'further.You', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'whe', 'see', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'old-run-of-the-mill', 'twisting', 'turning', 'ghost', 'fable', 'knew', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'engrossing', 'movie', '1', 'iota']",N/A

People often compare it to ""Ringu"" and other well-known Asian horror flicks, but I believe they have nothing on this one.The story starts off simple enough: two sisters return home after the death of their mother and have to deal with an evil stepmother. In addition, the house appears haunted. But it's not what it seems. It's never what it seems.The representation of the supernatural is pretty much the same as in all other Asian horror films, so if you're seen ""Ringu"" and ""Ju-On"", there will be no surprises on that front. The surprise, for me, was that the supernatural turned out the lesser focus of this movie, if at all. The main focus is on humanity, on emotional and psychological spectrum.I will admit that the flow of the movie is quite confusing for most of its duration. Nothing makes sense. Many things seem weird, pointless, or out of continuity. There are two major twists, the first of which makes absolutely no sense until the second one occurs. STICK WITH IT! When you reach the end, it'll all make sense, and be well worth it. Where movies like ""Ringu"" or ""Ju-On"" fall short or leave you hanging, ""The Tale Of Two Sisters"" does not. It delivers tenfold. If you just go with it, you'll be handsomely rewarded.It's wonderfully shot and convincingly acted.

I think the movie should be categorized as some sort of mini-masterpiece.  This is a cut above other movies of the genre: genuinely suspenseful, intelligent, brilliantly acted and visually stunning. The film tells the story of two sisters living with their seemly emotionally unstable stepmother (Jung-ah Yum gives an award caliber performance) and a well-intentioned, but distant father. The family is one big ticking bomb, ready to explode at any given time. Adding gasoline to the fire, the girls may or may not be seeing paranormal manifestations. If you've seen other modern Asian horror films, I don't have to tell you that nothing in the film is as it appears to be. At some point, there is even a fabulous twist that would make David Lynch very proud.Most of the previous reviewers has advice to watch this film twice which I too agree. Simply because you'll get a greater affect, almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All of these are handled superbly by Lim Su-jeong as Su-mi, the lead character. Also worthy of particular mention is Yum Jung-ah, who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother.While it has its scary moments, this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it. It's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery. It grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end - and possibly beyond!

It takes the trope of the Asian Ghost Movie--where spoken-word lore acts as metaphor for the cycle of violence, cruelty, and victim-psychology--and spins it into something a little more compelling, and certainly a little more sinister.  Where a movie like, say, The Ring (or perhaps Whispering Corridors), deals with urban folklore or the myth of rumor, A Tale of Two Sisters is set up as fairytale.  And where other Asian horrors use the idea of a cyclical ""curse""--often a rage harbored by a woman scorned--to suggest that each victim of cruelty in turn creates new victims, A Tale of Two Sisters is about a different kind of curse: the horror of memory, and the hauntings of guilt, it would seem.Two sisters have returned to live with their aloof, impotent father, and with their stepmother, a cruel and icily beautiful woman.  As stranger and stranger things fill the house, the two girls perceive that they are being victimized by the evil new mother.  And the stepmother is particularly human in that she retaliates when she, too, feels herself wronged.  The father is interesting if only for his absence: the women of the house fight for his attention and affection, and he withdraws further into himself, terrified they will make themselves ""ill, again.""  As pieces of each individual history slowly comes to the surface, in a slow process of remembering and revelation, the story becomes infinitely more horrifying.Modeled after the classic fairy tale character cast (siblings, aloof father, conniving stepmother), the characters quickly realize that something in their large guest mansion is amiss. And while certainly many ghostly horrors follow, the real horror is what has happened in this house, and what has willingly, deliberately been forgotten. And that's exactly as it should be.A Tale of Two Sisters, for all its ornate convolution, is an ultimately satisfying movie.  I first saw it in its limited theatrical release in the United States, and its moments of ghost-terror were strong enough to cause a great deal of squirming and crying out in the audience.  But these ghostly sequences are not what carry the movie.  Instead, its marvelous story, melancholy and incredibly devastating--and made only more fulfilling with repeated viewings and clarity--evolves this movie into so much more than a simple horror film.  And its terrible denouement is incredibly satisfying, in that it ultimately singles out who was truly in the wrong all along, and exacts justice and vengeance on that person in a truly oogly scene.Other Asian horrors have used the spoken-word urban myth/folklore trope as a metaphor that steps lightly around the cyclical nature of abuse and victim's psychology, but A Tale of Two Sisters is a grand achievement in that in reenvisions the genre and considers a different kind of victim's psychology, the sort fueled by complete and total guilt.",5,the power of guilt,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,2943,"['Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'might', 'be', 'finest', 'Asian', 'horror', 'yet', 'trope', 'Asian', 'Ghost', 'Movie', 'where', 'spoken-word', 'lore', 'acts', 'metaphor', 'cycle', 'violence', 'cruelty', 'victim-psychology', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'compelling', 'certainly', 'little', 'more', 'sinister', 'Where', 'movie', 'say', 'Ring', 'perhaps', 'Whispering', 'Corridors', 'deals', 'urban', 'folklore', 'myth', 'rumor', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'set', 'up', 'fairytale', 'where', 'other', 'Asian', 'horrors', 'use', 'idea', 'cyclical', 'curse', 'often', 'rage', 'harbored', 'woman', 'scorned', 'suggest', 'victim', 'cruelty', 'turn', 'new', 'victims', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'different', 'kind', 'curse', 'horror', 'memory', 'hauntings', 'guilt', 'would', 'seem.Two', 'sisters', 'have', 'returned', 'live', 'aloof', 'impotent', 'father', 'stepmother', 'cruel', 'icily', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'stranger', 'stranger', 'things', 'fill', 'house', 'two', 'girls', 'perceive', 'are', 'being', 'victimized', 'evil', 'new', 'mother', 'stepmother', 'particularly', 'human', 'when', 'too', 'feels', 'wronged', 'father', 'interesting', 'only', 'absence', 'women', 'house', 'fight', 'attention', 'affection', 'further', 'terrified', 'will', 'make', 'ill', 'again', 'pieces', 'individual', 'history', 'slowly', 'surface', 'slow', 'process', 'remembering', 'revelation', 'story', 'infinitely', 'more', 'horrifying.Modeled', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'character', 'cast', 'siblings', 'aloof', 'father', 'conniving', 'stepmother', 'characters', 'quickly', 'realize', 'something', 'large', 'guest', 'mansion', 'amiss', 'certainly', 'many', 'ghostly', 'horrors', 'follow', 'real', 'horror', 'what', 'happened', 'house', 'willingly', 'deliberately', 'been', 'forgotten', 'exactly', 'should', 'be.A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'ornate', 'convolution', 'ultimately', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'first', 'saw', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'United', 'States', 'moments', 'ghost-terror', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'cause', 'great', 'deal', 'squirming', 'crying', 'out', 'audience', 'ghostly', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'carry', 'movie', 'Instead', 'marvelous', 'story', 'melancholy', 'incredibly', 'devastating', 'made', 'only', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'clarity', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'simple', 'horror', 'film', 'terrible', 'denouement', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'ultimately', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'truly', 'wrong', 'justice', 'vengeance', 'person', 'truly', 'oogly', 'scene.Other', 'Asian', 'horrors', 'have', 'used', 'spoken-word', 'urban', 'myth/folklore', 'trope', 'metaphor', 'lightly', 'cyclical', 'nature', 'abuse', 'victim', 'psychology', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'grand', 'achievement', 'reenvisions', 'genre', 'different', 'kind', 'victim', 'psychology', 'sort', 'fueled', 'complete', 'total', 'guilt']",N/A

882784,A1O0F4QDAMEKVB,B0007M2374,Joey Comeau,"[7, 8]","I hated A Tale of Two Sisters the first time I watched it. Well, to be more specific, I loved it until the very end and then I hated it. It was the story of two young sisters moving into an old house with their father and their new step-mother. It was beautiful and slow and involving, and then I got to the end and was so frustrated by the twists that it ruined the whole movie for me. It seemed like the only way it made sense was if everyone in the movie was crazy. I felt betrayed by my investment in the characters and the film itself.I never really intended to give it another chance. But then last year I watched another film by the director (Kim Jee-Woon). His revenge thriller I Saw the Devil was also beautiful, and held together so perfectly that I wondered if maybe I had missed something when watching Sisters.So I sat down to watch it again, this time already knowing the movie's secrets, hoping that I'd been wrong. And right from the very beginning, I could tell that I had. Everything was intentional, from the timing of certain shots to the smallest expression on a character's face. All of it hinted at something coming, every shot served to build up just the right tension.And again I was impressed with how beautiful it was, with how amazing the actors were (especially Moon Geun Young as Su-yeon, whose constant confused sadness is heartbreaking, and Yeom Jeong-ah as the now-sinister, now-manic Eun-joo). In some ways this movie is a spiritual sister to The Others. It is beautiful and sad and strange, and it is much more about tragedy than about horror.But then the horror is amazing as well. A scene early in the film starts out as just another Japanese-influenced ""long-black-haired girl-ghost"" scare, until you notice that the ghost's head is twisted strangely to the side. And then you hear the slight creaking sound, and the gentle back and forth swaying of the ghost, even as she walks forward. She is hanging. It's a connection between the ghost and her death that suddenly makes that same old black hair frightening again, like when I first saw Samara's inhuman movement in The Ring.Kim Jee-Woon is a meticulous and imaginative director. There are twists, at the end, and then there are reveals unrelated to that twist. It is a layered and uncommonly satisfying ending. My original impression, that the movie only made sense if every character was crazy, is sort of embarrassing now. I could only have come to that conclusion because I wasn't paying enough attention.  This is a careful and intelligent film. The director was giving me the benefit of the doubt, and I didn't hold up my end of the bargain.",5,the benefit of the doubt,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,2638,"['hated', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Well', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'loved', 'very', 'end', 'then', 'hated', 'was', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'sisters', 'moving', 'old', 'house', 'father', 'new', 'step-mother', 'was', 'beautiful', 'slow', 'involving', 'then', 'got', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'frustrated', 'twists', 'ruined', 'whole', 'movie', 'seemed', 'only', 'way', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'everyone', 'movie', 'was', 'crazy', 'felt', 'betrayed', 'investment', 'characters', 'film', 'itself.I', 'never', 'really', 'intended', 'give', 'chance', 'then', 'last', 'year', 'watched', 'film', 'director', 'Kim', 'Jee-Woon', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'Saw', 'Devil', 'was', 'also', 'beautiful', 'held', 'together', 'so', 'perfectly', 'wondered', 'maybe', 'had', 'missed', 'something', 'when', 'watching', 'Sisters.So', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'again', 'time', 'already', 'knowing', 'movie', 'secrets', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'been', 'wrong', 'right', 'very', 'beginning', 'could', 'tell', 'had', 'Everything', 'was', 'intentional', 'timing', 'certain', 'shots', 'smallest', 'expression', 'character', 'face', 'hinted', 'something', 'coming', 'shot', 'served', 'build', 'up', 'just', 'right', 'tension.And', 'again', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'beautiful', 'was', 'how', 'amazing', 'actors', 'were', 'especially', 'Moon', 'Geun', 'Young', 'Su-yeon', 'constant', 'confused', 'sadness', 'heartbreaking', 'Yeom', 'Jeong-ah', 'now-sinister', 'now-manic', 'Eun-joo', 'ways', 'movie', 'spiritual', 'sister', 'Others', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'strange', 'much', 'more', 'tragedy', 'about', 'horror.But', 'then', 'horror', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'out', 'as', 'just', 'Japanese-influenced', 'long-black-haired', 'girl-ghost', 'scare', 'notice', 'ghost', 'head', 'twisted', 'strangely', 'side', 'then', 'hear', 'slight', 'creaking', 'sound', 'gentle', 'back', 'forth', 'swaying', 'ghost', 'even', 'forward', 'hanging', 'connection', 'ghost', 'death', 'suddenly', 'same', 'old', 'black', 'hair', 'frightening', 'again', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Samara', 'inhuman', 'movement', 'Ring.Kim', 'Jee-Woon', 'meticulous', 'imaginative', 'director', 'are', 'twists', 'end', 'then', 'are', 'reveals', 'unrelated', 'twist', 'layered', 'uncommonly', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'original', 'impression', 'movie', 'only', 'made', 'sense', 'character', 'was', 'crazy', 'sort', 'embarrassing', 'now', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'enough', 'attention', 'careful', 'intelligent', 'film', 'director', 'was', 'giving', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'end', 'bargain']",N/A

I have to warn you.  This movie is VERY disturbing.  But, at the center, it is a horror movie with a broken heart.I don't want to spoil the movie but if ever a movie needed spoilers, it's this one.  So many people find the movie difficult to understand.  I suggest that it could be a story about a young girls lapse into schizophrenia.  In this regard, it would help the viewer immensely to understand that the actual, REAL step-mother NEVER makes an appearance in the movie until the last twenty minutes of the film.  It bothers me that so many reviewers talk about the step-mother as being a monster when the step-mother is absent through the majority of the film.There are so many stand-out scenes in this movie that are chilling or frightening or heart-breaking.  I have watched this movie over and over again and I still get terrified at the one scene where Su-Mi is in bed and the ghost eerily approaches her with strange buzzing noise in the background.One of the most poignant, heart-wrenching scenes in this movie is when the father confronts Su-mi.  The acting in this scene is absolutely amazing.The remembrance scene that recalls the tragedy the movie centers around is nothing short of heartbreaking.  The step-mother wants to intercede but Su-mi comes out of her room and spews such venom at her that the step-mother is enraged and does nothing.  And Su-mi walks away, ignorant of the tragedy enfolding in another room inside the house.Su-mi lives with the agonizing pain that comes with realizing: ""if only I hadn't done this or said that.""  She knows it's too late and life has forever changed for her.  Her actions, or lack thereof, can never be undone.  The heartbreak is too much for Su-mi to bear.  She creates a false universe where she rewrites the script and brings the dead back to life -- to be tormented by her alter-ego villian.Yes there is a ghost in the movie.

This is definitely one of those films like ""The Crying Game"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" where you can ruin it by giving too much away.Today, horror cinema is dominated commercially by the U.S. and Japan.  American horror films tend to be gore films with few scares and lots of violence.  Japanese horror films are more psychological with more scares and less violence but little plot.  Korean horror films usually follow the formula of Japanese horror but don't usually match the quality.  This film is an outstanding exception.  Like most other Korean horror films, this is a psychological horror although it's partially a thriller.  However, unlike most of its peers, it has a very strong plot.  Although the stories are quite a bit different, I would compare this movie to ""The Sixth Sense"".  Both films are intelligent, scary, and emotionally powerful.  That last element is rare in the horror genre and it's nice to see for a change.  Horror and thriller films are simply more effective when you can connect with the characters and their pain.  Usually, they are just meat.This film is one part a ghost story, one part a film about domestic abuse, and one part a film about mental illness.  It follows two teenage girls who return home from a mental hospital.  Their stepmother is outwardly friendly but is slowly revealed to be an abusive monster.  The father is a good man with good intentions but he's complacent and does a poor job at listening to his daughters' cries for help.  Oh, and their house is apparently haunted.The movie does a good job at amping up each of the important elements at an appropriate pace and tying them together through the plotline.  The ghost story is introduced early, but the topics of domestic abuse and mental illness are gradually built up until the movie turns into an absolute emotional whirlwind.  The film also does an excellent job at portraying the daughters sympathetically and in a way that we can truly connect with the characters.  The movie is also genuinely scary.Some people complain that this movie is ""confusing"".  It's definitely a thinking man's horror/thriller.  Sometimes it's a little hard to follow, but I'd say it's easier to follow than other artsy films like Mulholland Dr. (which I LOVE).  The last few scenes reveal a lot and clear up quite a bit of the confusion.  However, it's definitely one of those films that you have to watch repeatedly to understand everything.If you don't mind a heady and somewhat artsy take on the horror and thriller genres, then I'd recommend picking this one up immediately.",5,One of the best horror films in modern cinema,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,2608,"[""'ll"", 'keep', 'spoilers', 'down', 'minimum', 'definitely', 'one', 'films', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'where', 'can', 'ruin', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away.Today', 'horror', 'cinema', 'dominated', 'commercially', 'U.S.', 'Japan', 'American', 'horror', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'gore', 'films', 'few', 'scares', 'lots', 'violence', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'psychological', 'more', 'scares', 'less', 'violence', 'little', 'plot', 'Korean', 'horror', 'films', 'usually', 'follow', 'formula', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'match', 'quality', 'film', 'outstanding', 'exception', 'most', 'other', 'Korean', 'horror', 'films', 'psychological', 'horror', 'partially', 'thriller', 'However', 'most', 'peers', 'very', 'strong', 'plot', 'stories', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'different', 'would', 'compare', 'movie', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'films', 'are', 'intelligent', 'scary', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'last', 'element', 'rare', 'horror', 'genre', 'nice', 'see', 'change', 'Horror', 'thriller', 'films', 'are', 'simply', 'more', 'effective', 'when', 'can', 'connect', 'characters', 'pain', 'Usually', 'are', 'just', 'meat.This', 'film', 'one', 'part', 'ghost', 'story', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'one', 'part', 'film', 'mental', 'illness', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'return', 'home', 'mental', 'hospital', 'stepmother', 'outwardly', 'friendly', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'be', 'abusive', 'monster', 'father', 'good', 'man', 'good', 'intentions', 'complacent', 'poor', 'job', 'listening', 'daughters', 'cries', 'help', 'Oh', 'house', 'apparently', 'haunted.The', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'amping', 'up', 'important', 'elements', 'appropriate', 'pace', 'tying', 'together', 'plotline', 'ghost', 'story', 'introduced', 'early', 'topics', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'mental', 'illness', 'are', 'gradually', 'built', 'up', 'movie', 'absolute', 'emotional', 'whirlwind', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'daughters', 'sympathetically', 'way', 'can', 'truly', 'connect', 'characters', 'movie', 'also', 'genuinely', 'scary.Some', 'people', 'complain', 'movie', 'confusing', 'definitely', 'thinking', 'man', 'horror/thriller', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', ""'d"", 'say', 'easier', 'follow', 'other', 'artsy', 'films', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'LOVE', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'reveal', 'lot', 'clear', 'up', 'quite', 'bit', 'confusion', 'However', 'definitely', 'one', 'films', 'have', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'understand', 'everything.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'heady', 'somewhat', 'artsy', 'take', 'horror', 'thriller', 'genres', 'then', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'picking', 'one', 'up', 'immediately']",N/A

The older sister always tries to protect her little sister from their new stepmother but doesn't always succeed. Strange things happen to the oldest sister but her father seems to be in his own world, not noticing what the dynamics are of the relationship between his daughters and new wife. The story takes several twists before the end and leaves you a bit confused about what actually took place, especially as it bounces back and forth between past and present. In the end, I think I get what the story was trying to tell us but I also think the writers could have left out a twist or two, making it easier to understand.Update: 02/09: I truly didn't understand this film the first time I saw it and decided I needed to watch it again. After a second viewing, all the pieces come together and created a cohesive whole. The movie is actually genius; it just takes some creative thinking to understand it all.

It is well filmed and there are a few visually interesting sets, but it was no more beautiful (or not as beautiful, even) and did not have any more depth than several other horrors/psycho-thrillers I've seen.I didn't like how convoluted and weird it became near the end, but that was not the most crucial misstep. The movie just simply wasn't that interesting. The characters all seem irrational and unsympathetic. The film moves slowly, which is fine at first, but when coupled with the strange behavior of the characters you start to lose interest. I didn't feel like it was meaningful, either. There is a tragedy at the heart of the story, but the character most affected by it isn't relate-able or likeable, and something in the bizarre way it's presented distances the viewer from any emotional response.I was also hoping for more originality. I'd never seen a Korean horror, so I was expecting some different techniques. But there was nothing really innovative in the method of filming. And even though I am only slightly acquainted with Asian horror, even I could pick out tropes that felt pretty stale. A vengeful, silent, long-haired spirit... photographs with faces scratched out... spirits hiding in strange, dark places throughout the house... etc. Though I didn't understand the twist ending completely, what I saw did not feel very shocking or new. The twist actually involved elements that were unoriginal in all types of horror.It's true I did not come away from this movie with a strong sense of disgust or aversion. Actually, I didn't come away with any strong feelings at all. This is one of those movies where, at the end, you shake your head, feel vaguely cheated of time, but shrug and move on with your day without any real desire to watch the movie again. Understanding all the puzzle pieces and the twist ending wouldn't matter, because there is no true connection to the film itself.

Their father awaits them with his new bride - Eun-joo, once a nurse on the father's staff.  Su-Mi is intensely angry with both her father and her new stepmother, and from this broken relationship, the film moves forward.  But this quickly turns into far more than a wicked stepmother film.Bit by bit director Ji-woon Kim makes it apparent that there is something deeply wrong.  Bad dreams turn into bad reality and back again as viewers learn not to trust the evidence of their eyes.  Kim uses a lot of sudden inserts that will have you hitting the pause and step buttons repeatedly, but to no avail.  It is a wicked woman, an insane girl, or a haunted house that lies at the dark center of this bleak tale?This is not so much a horror story as dark tale of characters in search of a resolution - one that uses horror as its metaphor.  Gestures and glances leave no doubt in anyone's mind that behind the characters words lies a secret that divides them onto separate parts.  Only the two young girls seem to find solace together, but their quiet moments are continually disturbed by their step-mother, who seems mad as a hatter.  But, as you can probably tell now from this review, almost nothing is as it seems.The direction really is brilliant.  Careful use of color and shadow make their rural home into a haunted gothic mansion.  Memories, not ghosts though, are the lurkers in the shadow, and it is up to the viewer to try to find the real thread in a truly layered plot.  Images, especially the use of hair and facial profiles contribute to the double meanings.  The acting is also excellent, a far cry from the what we're used to in oriental horror.  Having watched Ringu recently I can honestly say that this is the better film.Have somebody with you when you watch this film.

However, if you enjoy a good thriller - then this is definitely the movie for you.  I really enjoyed this movie and repeated viewings only enhanced it.This story of two sisters who return to a fractured family after being away grabs you from the start - what can't Su-mi remember?  and are the things she remembers accurate or dreams?  I won't go into too much detail in fear of giving anything away but rest assured this plot is gripping.  The viewer is intently focused on the plot as it unfolds before you in a most unnatural way.  Certain dialogues are repeated throughout the film by different actors with different connotations and in different time periods.  This is confusing at first (but much of what is going on is a mystery and somewhat confusing) and then makes sense of everything at the very end.  The truth of exactly what did happen in the past is chilling and explains why we first meet Su-mi in a mental ward, why the step-mother is taking pills and why the father is withdrawn. The theme of wicked step-mothers locking children in closets, older sister protecting the younger one and others are universal and are immediately identified by the audience who is artfully drawn in by Ji-woon Kim's retelling of a haunting Korean folktale.A very masterful piece of film making that stays with you.  The writing, cinematography, acting and direction are all superb.

Carter,"[7, 10]","With the sudden influx of Asian Horror movies recently, especially Korean you might be forgiven for thinking this is just another Ringu/Ju-On type rip-off.  However what we have here is a hugely thoughtful Drama/Horror/Psychological classic.  I've actually watched this 4 times already and each time I seem to catch new nuances in it that just add to the enjoyment.  The most gorgeous looking Horror movie (if you want to call it that) you'll ever see.  Rich Red/Brown tones and intensely detailed cinematography.  As with the best Horror movies you have to empathize with the lead characters otherwise all is lost as you won't care what happens to them.  You are immediately drawn to the wonderfully acted lead Character's, the sister's in question & again as with the best Horror films the fewer character's the better.  Here there are only four main characters, but you'll find yourself engrossed in each one.  The acting here is top notch and is complimented in every aspect by the delicate touch and excellent timing of sure-handed Director 'Kim Jee-Woon'.  It is a film that is involving on so many different levels.  As a horror film, psychological drama and mystery.  You'll be wondering right up to the end who did what and why and even then you might need to watch it again to fully get to grips with what you just witnessed.  Totally enthralling, edge of your seat & engrossing cinematic fare.  It is certainly in the top 10 of Asian Horror films along with 'Ringu', 'Ju-On' & 'Kairo' but retains its own sense of self as a completely unique entity.  A movie you should watch to broaden your horizons as to what is on offer from the Koran film-world.  Kudos to the wonderful packaging Tartan Asia Extreme has done here.  I particularly like the slip-case cover & it was oh so gratifying to see the Actor's interviewed and showing such humility and excitement for the project without the usual Hollywoodisms (pardon my bad English).  This movie will remain with you for a long time and I think makes for great re-viewing to see if there's anything you missed.

Some of the events just stuck with me over the years because I hadn't seen anything like it before in horror. Being the horror buff I am I loaded this movie up to find out it was that great movie I saw before... and I watched it again. The second time it seems like a different movie because you know what's going on but, you pay a lot more attention to the characters interactions. I enjoyed this film because I like how it builds up the story. You know something is wrong but you can't quite put your finger on it.Aside from the supernatural aspects the movie isn't far off of what can happens to someones mind after they suffer a horrific event like the main character which is what makes the movie believable and even more interested. ***spoiler here*** Su-mi losses both her mother and her sister. She's filled with guilt for not being there to save her sister from being crushed to death, or to save her mother from killing herself. She blames her step mother for causing all the trauma,and her father for being so cold and not understanding how his actions hurt everyone. To not being able to handle the events Su-Mi in her mind created an image of her mother having ""died"", her father re-marrying, and her and her sister being forced to move in and live with them now.That is the Scenario Su-Mi created in her head. The hatred she had for her step mother was so intense that she became a personality of hers that tormented both her and the image of her sister in her mind.  The only thing that's never clear is if her sister was a ghost or just a image created by Su-mi. There is a ghost of her sister, and one of her mother in the house but they look different from the images Su-mi sees. So what you take is that the occurrences in the movie are events Su-mi created but the twist is that her mother and sister are actually real ghost in the house looking for revenge. The real loop hole is when Su-mi sees the ghost of her mother...she doesn't recognize her. ***end spoiler***overall great movie but sure to be overlooked and cheapened by hollywood knock offs.",5,See this before any cheap remake!,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,2188,"['originally', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'called', 'first', 'caught', 'Cable', 'even', 'then', 'caught', 'attention', 'events', 'just', 'stuck', 'years', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'horror', 'Being', 'horror', 'buff', 'am', 'loaded', 'movie', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'saw', 'watched', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'different', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'pay', 'lot', 'more', 'attention', 'characters', 'interactions', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'like', 'how', 'story', 'know', 'something', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'it.Aside', 'supernatural', 'movie', ""n't"", 'far', 'what', 'can', 'happens', 'someones', 'mind', 'suffer', 'horrific', 'event', 'main', 'character', 'what', 'movie', 'believable', 'even', 'more', 'interested', '***spoiler', 'here***', 'Su-mi', 'losses', 'mother', 'sister', 'filled', 'guilt', 'not', 'being', 'there', 'save', 'sister', 'being', 'crushed', 'death', 'save', 'mother', 'killing', 'step', 'mother', 'causing', 'trauma', 'father', 'being', 'so', 'cold', 'not', 'understanding', 'how', 'actions', 'hurt', 'everyone', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'handle', 'events', 'Su-Mi', 'mind', 'created', 'image', 'mother', 'having', 'died', 'father', 're-marrying', 'sister', 'being', 'forced', 'move', 'live', 'Scenario', 'Su-Mi', 'created', 'head', 'hatred', 'had', 'step', 'mother', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'became', 'personality', 'hers', 'tormented', 'image', 'sister', 'mind', 'only', 'thing', 'never', 'clear', 'sister', 'was', 'ghost', 'just', 'image', 'created', 'Su-mi', 'ghost', 'sister', 'one', 'mother', 'house', 'look', 'different', 'images', 'Su-mi', 'sees', 'what', 'take', 'occurrences', 'movie', 'are', 'events', 'Su-mi', 'created', 'twist', 'mother', 'sister', 'are', 'actually', 'real', 'ghost', 'house', 'looking', 'revenge', 'real', 'loop', 'hole', 'when', 'Su-mi', 'ghost', 'mother', ""n't"", 'recognize', '***end', 'spoiler***overall', 'great', 'movie', 'sure', 'be', 'overlooked', 'cheapened', 'hollywood', 'knock', 'offs']",N/A

The use of sound effects to heighten suspense throughout the film is amazing.  The HK version of the DVD which I ended up purchasing does an excellent job of recreating this atmosphere and was mixed in DTS-ES 6.1 channel sound, a format that is usually reserved for blockbuster action movies in the US.  Its a shame it isn't used more often in horror as the sound of something coming up behind you can be much scarier than whats going on onscreen.Aside from the sound, there is plenty to recommend this film by.  The plot is twisty and doesn't ever slow down long enought to break the spell of the story.  The visuals are also very well done and work well in blurring the line between fantasy and reality.  The acting was excellent from my viewpoint as a non-Korean speaker.  Overall, this is a top notch production that will scare you while making you think.

882800,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0007M2374,Matthew King,"[29, 31]","First impressions should not always be taken as par for the course.  That&#8217;s the lesson I&#8217;ve learned after my second viewing of this Korean film.  While impressed at the technical wizardry of director Ji-woon Kim, his film still left me with a sour taste in my mouth after the initial viewing.  &#8220;A tale of two sisters&#8221; is one of those films that has a major twist in the plot that makes you rethink the entire events you&#8217;ve previously seen.  If done right this technique can be a clever move, however it seems to have been done to death in the thrillers of the past 5 years or so. As soon as the credits rolled a strange combination of feeling dumb and disappointed hit me and I felt like I&#8217;d missed the whole point of the movie.  But although dismayed once the credit rolled I still could not get this film out of my head.  The very next day I decided to give it another viewing and I&#8217;m glad I did.  All of a sudden, key pieces of dialogue revealed themselves to be much more important than previously thought and actions that were once confusing suddenly made a lot more sense.  This is a film that commands a second viewing to be fully appreciated.  Trust me on this one.Sisters Su-mi (the older and strong-willed sister) and Su-yeon (the younger and more timid one) return to their father&#8217;s home, a large rural and gothic house, after being away at the hospital due to extended and unspecified illnesses.  Almost immediately after arriving, their shallow, condescending stepmother is on their case accusing and criticizing them for an assortment of things like not cleaning their rooms, being messy, supposedly being rude, etc.  Relationships between the three of them deteriorate to the point where the two sisters begin to suffer not only verbal but physical abuse, all while the stepfather looks on passively.  Just when tensions begin to reach a boiling point, the stepfather reveals a shocking plot point that turns the entire story on its head and makes us rethink the entire movie we&#8217;re watching.Technically, this film is highly accomplished, more than just about any of the other high-profile horror movies to come out of Asia in recent years.  From the complex plot, to the perfect casting and gorgeous cinematography every aspect of this film is a wonder to behold.  Its ability to creep out the viewer is inspiring: it has a control over light and shadow that is amazing.  Even what happens during the day is spooky, as the film has a beautiful portrait to it, a mix of flashy colors and shadows that lends it a surrealistic feel.  The house where the entirety of the movie occurs is a truly creepy place where secrets and dangers seem to lurk behind every door.  Several sequences such as the ghostly appearances in the girls&#8217; rooms and under the sink, as well as the dinner with relatives are the ultimate in creepiness.Another thing I enjoyed immensely was the chemistry between the two sisters.  Obviously the two love each other, are very close and understand each other perfectly.  The big sister is always taking care of the little one, the little one always looking to the big sister for guidance.  Their strong relationship adds so much to the power of the movie and its eeriness because you feel that something will soon crash down and shatter their little world into pieces.  A few of the scenes however were kind of derivative of other Asian fright films such as the woman crawling in the bedroom scene which reminded me suspiciously of the one in Ju-on: the Grudge.  Also, the whole idea that some characters might be ghosts is similar to recent thrillers such as &#8220;The Others&#8221; and &#8220;The Sixth Sense&#8221;.  But unlike these two films, &#8220;A tale of two sisters&#8221; stands much better to numerous repeat viewings because the twist is not at the heart of everything.  Beautiful and tragic, this one&#8217;s a must if you love Asian ghost chillers.",4,Heartfelt human tragedy and the madness that ensues,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,3956,"['First', 'impressions', 'should', 'not', 'always', 'be', 'taken', 'par', 'course', '8217', 'lesson', '8217', 've', 'learned', 'second', 'viewing', 'Korean', 'film', 'impressed', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'director', 'Ji-woon', 'Kim', 'film', 'still', 'left', 'sour', 'taste', 'mouth', 'initial', 'viewing', '8220', 'tale', 'two', 'sisters', '8221', 'one', 'films', 'major', 'twist', 'plot', 'rethink', 'entire', 'events', '8217', 'previously', 'seen', 'done', 'right', 'technique', 'can', 'be', 'clever', 'move', 'however', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'thrillers', 'past', '5', 'years', 'so', 'As', 'soon', 'credits', 'rolled', 'strange', 'combination', 'feeling', 'dumb', 'disappointed', 'hit', 'felt', '8217', 'd', 'missed', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'dismayed', 'credit', 'rolled', 'still', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'film', 'head', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'decided', 'give', 'viewing', '8217', 'glad', 'did', 'sudden', 'key', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'revealed', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'previously', 'thought', 'actions', 'were', 'once', 'confusing', 'suddenly', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'Trust', 'one.Sisters', 'Su-mi', 'older', 'strong-willed', 'sister', 'Su-yeon', 'younger', 'more', 'timid', 'one', 'return', 'father', '8217', 'home', 'large', 'rural', 'gothic', 'house', 'being', 'away', 'hospital', 'due', 'extended', 'unspecified', 'illnesses', 'Almost', 'immediately', 'arriving', 'shallow', 'condescending', 'stepmother', 'case', 'accusing', 'criticizing', 'assortment', 'things', 'not', 'cleaning', 'rooms', 'being', 'messy', 'supposedly', 'being', 'rude', 'etc', 'Relationships', 'three', 'deteriorate', 'point', 'where', 'two', 'sisters', 'begin', 'suffer', 'not', 'only', 'verbal', 'physical', 'abuse', 'stepfather', 'passively', 'Just', 'when', 'tensions', 'begin', 'reach', 'boiling', 'point', 'stepfather', 'shocking', 'plot', 'point', 'entire', 'story', 'head', 'rethink', 'entire', 'movie', '8217', 're', 'watching.Technically', 'film', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'more', 'just', 'other', 'high-profile', 'horror', 'movies', 'come', 'Asia', 'recent', 'years', 'complex', 'plot', 'perfect', 'casting', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'aspect', 'film', 'wonder', 'behold', 'ability', 'creep', 'out', 'viewer', 'inspiring', 'control', 'light', 'shadow', 'amazing', 'Even', 'what', 'day', 'spooky', 'film', 'beautiful', 'portrait', 'mix', 'flashy', 'colors', 'shadows', 'surrealistic', 'feel', 'house', 'where', 'entirety', 'movie', 'truly', 'creepy', 'place', 'where', 'secrets', 'dangers', 'seem', 'lurk', 'door', 'Several', 'sequences', 'such', 'ghostly', 'appearances', 'girls', '8217', 'rooms', 'sink', 'as', 'well', 'dinner', 'relatives', 'are', 'ultimate', 'creepiness.Another', 'thing', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'was', 'chemistry', 'two', 'sisters', 'Obviously', 'two', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'understand', 'other', 'perfectly', 'big', 'sister', 'always', 'taking', 'care', 'little', 'one', 'little', 'one', 'always', 'looking', 'big', 'sister', 'guidance', 'strong', 'relationship', 'so', 'much', 'power', 'movie', 'eeriness', 'feel', 'something', 'will', 'soon', 'crash', 'down', 'shatter', 'little', 'world', 'pieces', 'few', 'scenes', 'however', 'were', 'kind', 'derivative', 'other', 'Asian', 'fright', 'films', 'such', 'woman', 'crawling', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'reminded', 'suspiciously', 'one', 'Ju-on', 'Grudge', 'Also', 'whole', 'idea', 'characters', 'might', 'be', 'ghosts', 'similar', 'recent', 'thrillers', 'such', '8220', 'Others', '8221', '8220', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '8221', 'two', 'films', '8220', 'tale', 'two', 'sisters', '8221', 'much', 'better', 'numerous', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'twist', 'not', 'heart', 'everything', 'Beautiful', 'tragic', 'one', '8217', 's', 'must', 'love', 'Asian', 'ghost', 'chillers']",N/A

A Tale Of Two Sisters is one of those films which doesn't really fit into any film genre.The first hour is trying to fit bits of jigsaw into the wrong sections, while you try to work out exactly what is going on. Without revealing too much about the plot, it's about two sisters coming home from the mental hospital, to their silent father, and their overly desperate to please (or is she?) stepmother. The sisters stick together, and try to seemingly force their stepmother out, but she's there to stay.The last half hour or so of the film is where everything tries to click into place, and will leave you working it out for a good while afterwards. Originally, I did feel let down by the ending, but after sitting, and working it out, I realised it wasn't so bad.As with most of these style films, don't sit there and try to figure out what's going to happen before it does.

882803,A4RQ549E9K6B4,B0007M2374,Michael S. Fleischer,"[2, 4]","Magnificently recreated from a Korean folktale, A Tale of Two Sisters, produced by Sir Laosson Dara for iPictures and Tartan Asia Extreme (2003), impresses thoughtful filmgoers with its dazzling imagery, complex plot twists, and seeming incongruities, which are wedded to a full complement of visceral shocks and shudders.Su-Yueng's (Geun-yeong Mun) older sister, Su-mi (Su-jeong Lim), recently institutionalized, cannot recall the upheaval that destroyed her family at its country lakehouse, frustrating her psychiatrist. Prescription in hand, the girls' father, Dr. Mu-hyeon (Kap-su Kim) chauffeurs the brooding remnant home, journeying through tropical thickets, lush river valleys, and verdant mountains. Tall thistles rhythmically willow to the film's counter-intuitive score, an enchanting composition by Byung-woo Lee.Among the spate of psychological thrillers in the J- and K-horror tradition that have made their way to our shores from half a world away, this award-winning film is a masterpiece--thanks, in part, to the brilliant performances of actresses, Su-jeong Lim (Su-mi) and Jung-ah Yum (Eun-ju), the writing and direction of Ji-woon Kim, cinematography and art direction of Mo-gae Lee and Geun-hyeon Jo, and the imaginative film editing of Hyeon-mi Lee, The film's relevance derives from Kim's intrepid statements about the social and psychological tolls victims' pay in broken families, which is as much a potent issue overseas as it is in America. Kim et al., dramatically segue them into a top-tier, compelling and suspenseful horror-mystery.The sisters saunter out of their father's car upon arrival and sensuously reorient themselves to their surroundings, warming to the sun. The chords of piano crescendo to the intensifying strains of guitar, violin, viola, and cello, as the pair rush out a pier adjoining a nearby wharf, seat themselves at its precipice, and broadcast their arrival by dipping their toes into cool, placid waters, generating eddies and ripples.Throughout life, but particularly in childhood, each of us develops a sense of identity from the way we believe significant others perceive and judge us, as if they were reflecting pools. Charles Horton Cooley labeled this phenomenon, ""the looking glass self"" or ""empathic introspection."" For shattered minds, ridden by guilt and regret, the currents of distressed consciousness distort what we internalize from others, even if it comforts us. Preternatural angels and demons, real and imagined, mirror our self-perceptions. For aeons, they have stalked us, appearing in our cave art, dreams, nightmares, and hallucinations. Perhaps the wellsprings of ""multiple personality disorder"" (IDC-9) or ""dissociative identity disorder"" (DSM-IV-TR), the most dangerous of these entities may be the poltergeists summoned by traumatized adolescent girls through ""recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis,"" as researched by Nandor Fodor. This was the theory advanced by novelist, Brent Monahan, and director, Courtney Solomon, as the source of the Bell Witch, in their interpretation of actual events that included a death on a 19th Century Tennessee farm in ""An American Haunting"" (Lionsgate, 2005). They dare us to face our most vexing secrets lest they remain forever cloaked behind ochre walls, painted veils, bedroom wardrobes, or concealed beneath bathroom and kitchen fixtures. They keep vigilance over our troubled souls from the muted corners of mind and matter, agitating us to become who or what we will--or confront what will become of us.Under a glowering full moon, nighttime tells a different tale of two sisters, and their fractured world. Within a restless house of haunted mirrors and broken glass reside painful memories of an absent mother. Su-mi recollects her from old photos and personal effects retrieved from flowered boxes that her mum once ribboned with love. She shares them with Su-yueng--to the angst of their stepmother. Eun-ju (Jung-ah Yum) is an icy albeit beautiful nurse whom the sisters' aloof and self-absorbed father met at work, and later married, after she tended to their mother. Su-mi despises her, and Eun-ju returns the favor in spades.In a notable scene, Eun-ju shrieks with laughter amid the pairs' uncle and aunt, who have been invited by Mu-hyeon to what should have been a quiet, candlelight dinner. With Mozart's Violin Concerto #5, providing the background music, she recounts an old tale about their neighbor, a farmer, otherwise uninteresting, who uncharacteristically stripped-off his clothing whenever it rained while plowing his fields, often in full view of travelers who might be motoring along an abutting highway. After prodding her guests to remember the amusing story, Eun-ju sours in disgust at their professed ignorance and confusion. Su-mi's aunt drops to the floor, lapsing into an epileptic seizure, which nearly chokes her to death, but successfully kills the evening. On their return trip, the sisters' aunt tells their uncle that while she lie convulsing on the floor she spotted a ghostly girl hiding underneath the kitchen sink. A similar entity entered the bedrooms of Su-mi and her sister the previous night. There is a fascinating bond that ties Su-mi, Su-yueng, and Eun-Ju to the metaphysical wraith. The latter's gripping role, as a silent storyteller, though brief, will chill filmgoers with the details that underlie the devastating family history, shown in fleeting fragments and flashback. Suffice it to say that what we see of ourselves, as mirrored in others, often is re-visited when we become their reflecting pools.An ""American"" adaptation of A Tale of Two Sisters, starring Arielle Kebbel and Emily Browning, along with David Straihairn, Elizabeth Banks, and Maya Massar recently concluded filming in Bowen Island, British Columbia, Canada. Shot by British directors, Charles and Thomas Guard, the picture is scheduled for release later in 2008--all the best.

It's a little of both but more so a ghost story.For those who have seen this film the title is a kind of wink at Charles Dickens A Tale of Two Cities if your familiar with the concept of that story.  I mean that in comparing the two sisters to the two cities not just the title itself which is obviously more direct.The film has some effective scares that will make you jump along with a good DTS track so keep the volume turned up.  Also has some freaky visuals.A Tale of Two Sisters is also a very good looking film with nice  cinematography and an effective score.The plot isn't exactly linear, I would advise whoever is going to sit down and watch this film to have as little interruptions as possible and pause it for bathroom breaks.  The very first scene is key so make sure you pay attention.This could have gotten five stars but my one negative would be it was just a bit too confusing and after it is over you do end up asking yourself a lot of questions and there are some plot holes but I did not however get a chance to look into some of the special features which may fill in some of these holes.

882806,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007M2374,mirasreviews,"[142, 152]","""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is a rarity among horror films that combines genuine human drama with spookiness. And it goes one better in presenting the audience with a multi-layered mystery that reveals itself gradually. Teenaged Su-mi (Im Su-jeong) and her younger sister Su-yeon (Moon Geun-yeong) return home to their father and stepmother after a stay at a mental hospital. Su-mi is outspoken, resentful of her stepmother, and always protective of the more reserved Su-yeon. Shortly after the girls arrive, strange things begin to happen around the house. Su-mi is plagued by horrific nightmares that may or may not be real. Objects seem to replicate themselves. Images of people appear and disappear. Their stepmother (Yeom Jeong-ah) blames the girls and then the house. Su-mi blames her stepmother. Their father (Kim Kab-su) blames everyone's inability to adjust to their new circumstances. Events from the past which are alluded to but never explained may hold the answer. Or is an otherworldly presence at work?It's not surprising that ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" owes much of its success to its credibility. The relationships of these people - the resentful and protective older sister, the concerned but frustrated father, the cold and jealous stepmother- are in the forefront of the narrative, not secondary to the horror. Deep-seated emotions drive the characters, not fear. Unlike most horror or mystery films, we understand less of what's going on than the characters do. Writer/director Kim Ji-woon keeps the audience in the dark until nearly the end of the film. Since these are credible characters, we want to understand what's happening to them, and that sustains our interest. Layers of the mystery are peeled away gradually, revealing a genuine human tragedy with horrific implications.""A Tale of Two Sisters"" will appeal to fans of psychological thrillers as well as horror. I found the film more gripping than frightening. It has a story to tell -rather than just creeping you out. The film doesn't suffer from underwriting or bad writing that I've come to expect from Asian horror films -or from horror films in general. If anything, ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is more complicated than it needs to be at a few points. Production values also seem pretty high. Fine cinematography beautifully contrasts the idyllic, bright countryside surrounding the family's lovely old home with its dark, oppressive interior. In Korean with English or Spanish subtitles.The DVD (Tartan Video 2005): There are reportedly 2 versions of this Tartan DVD: a single disc that is rated R and a two-disc set that is unrated. I assume it's unrated only because the bonus material hasn't been rated. The disc I saw was the first disc of the 2-disc set. It includes a trailer and two audio commentaries (in Korean with subtitles). The first commentary is by writer/director Kim Ji-woon, director of photography Lee Mo-gae, and lighting director O Seung-chui. This is a scene-by-scene analysis of how the story, tone, and characters are expressed through photography and lighting, including framing, lighting design, and camera movements. It's quite a good commentary if you're interested in the filmmaking process. The second commentary is with writer/director Kim Ji-woon and the actresses who played the sisters, Im Su-jeong and Moon Geun-yeong. Kim gives further commentary about his decisions and intentions and prompts the actresses to comment on their performances. Sorry, I have not seen the second disc of bonus material.",5,A Horror Film with Genuine Human Drama.,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,3512,"['Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'rarity', 'horror', 'films', 'combines', 'genuine', 'human', 'drama', 'spookiness', 'one', 'better', 'presenting', 'audience', 'multi-layered', 'mystery', 'gradually', 'Teenaged', 'Su-mi', 'Im', 'Su-jeong', 'younger', 'sister', 'Su-yeon', 'Moon', 'Geun-yeong', 'return', 'home', 'father', 'stepmother', 'stay', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Su-mi', 'outspoken', 'resentful', 'stepmother', 'always', 'protective', 'more', 'reserved', 'Su-yeon', 'Shortly', 'girls', 'arrive', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'house', 'Su-mi', 'plagued', 'horrific', 'nightmares', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'real', 'Objects', 'seem', 'replicate', 'Images', 'people', 'appear', 'disappear', 'stepmother', 'Yeom', 'Jeong-ah', 'girls', 'then', 'house', 'Su-mi', 'stepmother', 'father', 'Kim', 'Kab-su', 'everyone', 'inability', 'adjust', 'new', 'circumstances', 'Events', 'past', 'are', 'alluded', 'never', 'explained', 'may', 'hold', 'answer', 'otherworldly', 'presence', 'work', 'not', 'surprising', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'owes', 'much', 'success', 'credibility', 'relationships', 'people', 'resentful', 'protective', 'older', 'sister', 'concerned', 'frustrated', 'father', 'cold', 'jealous', 'stepmother-', 'are', 'forefront', 'narrative', 'not', 'secondary', 'horror', 'Deep-seated', 'emotions', 'drive', 'characters', 'not', 'fear', 'most', 'horror', 'mystery', 'films', 'understand', 'less', 'what', 'going', 'characters', 'do', 'Writer/director', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'audience', 'dark', 'nearly', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'credible', 'characters', 'want', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'interest', 'Layers', 'mystery', 'are', 'peeled', 'away', 'gradually', 'revealing', 'genuine', 'human', 'tragedy', 'horrific', 'implications', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'as', 'well', 'horror', 'found', 'film', 'more', 'gripping', 'frightening', 'story', 'tell', '-rather', 'just', 'creeping', 'film', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'underwriting', 'bad', 'writing', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', '-or', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'anything', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'more', 'complicated', 'be', 'few', 'points', 'Production', 'values', 'also', 'seem', 'pretty', 'high', 'Fine', 'cinematography', 'beautifully', 'idyllic', 'bright', 'countryside', 'surrounding', 'family', 'lovely', 'old', 'home', 'dark', 'oppressive', 'interior', 'Korean', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles.The', 'DVD', 'Tartan', 'Video', '2005', 'are', 'reportedly', '2', 'versions', 'Tartan', 'DVD', 'single', 'disc', 'rated', 'R', 'two-disc', 'set', 'unrated', 'assume', 'unrated', 'only', 'bonus', 'material', ""n't"", 'been', 'rated', 'disc', 'saw', 'was', 'first', 'disc', '2-disc', 'set', 'trailer', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'Korean', 'subtitles', 'first', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'director', 'photography', 'Lee', 'Mo-gae', 'lighting', 'director', 'O', 'Seung-chui', 'scene-by-scene', 'analysis', 'how', 'story', 'tone', 'characters', 'are', 'expressed', 'photography', 'lighting', 'including', 'framing', 'lighting', 'design', 'camera', 'movements', 'quite', 'good', 'commentary', ""'re"", 'interested', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'second', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Kim', 'Ji-woon', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'sisters', 'Im', 'Su-jeong', 'Moon', 'Geun-yeong', 'Kim', 'further', 'commentary', 'decisions', 'intentions', 'actresses', 'comment', 'performances', 'Sorry', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'second', 'disc', 'bonus', 'material']",N/A

Of course, as in all Asian horror, things are not always what they seem.I'd heard great things about this film from Asian horror afficionados, and had been looking for a copy to rent for a while. I finally broke down and bought one; I'm glad I did since this is the kind of film that rewards repeat viewing, and am happy to report that it lives up to the hype as one of the most thrilling and psychologically rich horror pictures of the past decade.  Fans of Asian horror will definitely want to check this one out.The cinematography and sound design is potent -- muted colors, chiaroscuro; creaking floor boards and screams.  What surprised me was how seldom the film creates a sudden scare - this isn't about shock value but about tone and slow realizations with horrific impact.  The director knows how to evoke the very real horrors of being alone in a room, hearing inscrutable noises.  The actors inhabit their roles thoroughly, and the emphasis throughout is on the very real relationships in a broken family, and the apparently supernatural elements are always secondary to this.  The story is rich and complex, and unravels its mysteries only gradually, to the point where a full appreciation of the psychological and supernatural elements at play may require repeated viewings.  This is not one of those easy thrillers that lays out all the clues neatly, and then has someone sum them all up for you in the end in case you missed anything.  Still, while the film is rich enough to sustain a range of interpretations, there are no loose ends, and everything can be pieced together by the attentive viewer.  Well worth watching, a few times, for those who like their horror to include mystery and enigma, and who prefer psychological complexity to tidy explanations.",4,"Believe the hype - a creepy and compelling psychological horror thriller, depicting a broken family",1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,1975,"['Two', 'sisters', 'come', 'home', 'extended', 'stay', 'hospital', 'where', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'father', 'unaware', 'unwilling', 'protect', 'controlling', 'vindictive', 'step-mother', 'course', 'Asian', 'horror', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'what', 'seem.I', ""'d"", 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'film', 'Asian', 'horror', 'afficionados', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'copy', 'rent', 'while', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'bought', 'one', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'kind', 'film', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'up', 'hype', 'one', 'most', 'thrilling', 'psychologically', 'rich', 'horror', 'pictures', 'past', 'decade', 'Fans', 'Asian', 'horror', 'will', 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'one', 'out.The', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'design', 'potent', 'muted', 'colors', 'chiaroscuro', 'creaking', 'floor', 'boards', 'screams', 'What', 'surprised', 'was', 'how', 'seldom', 'film', 'sudden', 'scare', ""n't"", 'shock', 'value', 'tone', 'slow', 'realizations', 'horrific', 'impact', 'director', 'how', 'evoke', 'very', 'real', 'horrors', 'being', 'alone', 'room', 'hearing', 'inscrutable', 'noises', 'actors', 'inhabit', 'roles', 'thoroughly', 'emphasis', 'very', 'real', 'relationships', 'broken', 'family', 'apparently', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'are', 'always', 'secondary', 'story', 'rich', 'complex', 'mysteries', 'only', 'gradually', 'point', 'where', 'full', 'appreciation', 'psychological', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'play', 'may', 'require', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'not', 'one', 'easy', 'thrillers', 'clues', 'neatly', 'then', 'someone', 'sum', 'up', 'end', 'case', 'missed', 'anything', 'Still', 'film', 'rich', 'enough', 'sustain', 'range', 'interpretations', 'are', 'loose', 'ends', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'pieced', 'together', 'attentive', 'viewer', 'Well', 'watching', 'few', 'times', 'who', 'like', 'horror', 'include', 'mystery', 'enigma', 'who', 'prefer', 'psychological', 'complexity', 'tidy', 'explanations']",N/A

Upon arriving, they clash with their distant father and cruel stepmother. To make matters worse, strange things are occurring leading to the presence of something supernatural.'A Tale of Two Sisters' is in my opinion one of the greatest horror films ever made. It's beautifully shot, masterfully written and features some great performances from the cast. It's really hard for me to pinpoint one thing that rises above the rest as I could go on at length on any given area. While it's definitely more of an ""artistic"" film, there's still some pretty scary and deeply disturbing stuff here as well. Definitely worth watching with the lights off and the sound turned up.Without spoiling anything, the film's ending is probably one of the most effective examples of its kind. The twist is much more than your typical cheap shock and watching it again really puts the entire film into a different emotional perspective. Even if you think you know what's going on, you definitely won't be prepared for the full extent of it. This is a film that definitely rewards repeat viewings.Features-wise, the DVD is stacked. Foreign films are usually neglected in this area but Tartan has given this a high-quality release. On the first disc we get two commentary tracks; the first features the director, cinematographer and lighting director, and the second has director speaking with the two lead actresses. Out of the two I preferred listening to the one with the actresses but it's still great to have both.The second disc has numerous featurettes as well as deleted scenes. The bulk of them focus on how the film was made, but the highlights for me were the interviews with the cast. Particularly touching is Geun-yeong Mun's (she plays the younger sister) in which she starts to tear up upon recalling her time on the set and how the rest of the crew threw her a birthday party. The deleted scenes provide an interesting insight into the film's storyline, but frustrating thing is that the only audio and subtitle tracks are with the director's commentary. It would have been nice to view them as-is.Overall, the film is wonderful and it's matched by the quality of Tartan's presentation.

I like a twisty, complex plot development and had no problems with the layers of memory and flashback used in this film but....ultimately they lead nowhere. I had to look up on the internet what actually happened in this movie but apparently, there is no real consensus.  My husband was soooo mad after we viewed this film!

The cinematography was outstanding...it was beautiful to watch.  The acting was superb!  2 of the main characters were children and they played their roles excellently.  The mood of the film was...macabre.  I kept waiting for something really dramatic to occur because the film did keep you......disturbed.

882825,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0007M2374,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[6, 8]","This review, unlike many others here, will be spoiler-free :-)""A Tale of Two Sisters"" begins simply enough; two sisters, rebellious Soo-mi and shy Soo-yeon, arrive back to their father's house after a period of time spent, accoring to the DVD case, in hospital. Their new stepmother Eun-joo greets them with a warmth which quickly spills over into irritation and hostility, when the strainedness of their situation and supernatural goings-on begin to wear down the facade of seemingly ordinary family life.Firstly, the performances. Su-jeong Lim as Soo-mi and Jung-ah Yum as Eun-joo give rare performances: incandescent and full of life and energy, here are two women not hampered by the usual restrictions of the horror genre. At best an antagonistic relationship, their dynamic is so compelling that, since the plot essentially unfolds back-to-front, they anchor the viewer in their world by strength of their powers of character creation. Their scene in the middle of the night, at the tea-table and their fight scene towards the end of the movie are, even without the horror premise, chilling enough as to stay in the viewer's memory, long after the credits roll.They do have ample support in front of the camera, however, and the role of Soo-yeon is amply (if a little predictably) portrayed by Geun-yeong Mun. Kap-su Kim as harangued father-figure Bae Moo-hyeon is good, too, but his is neither a large nor a very sympathetic role. Still, he plays it convincingly enough, and finally comes into his own by the film's end.Direction is absolutely spellbinding, as is the cinematography. Ji-woon Kim has thrown out almost all of the traditional visual elements of Asian horror (such as tastefully desaturated colours, long still shots, stop-motion camerawork, etc.), replacing them instead with an unbelievably rich palette of colour and light. Reds are very red, blues are deep and tranquil, blacks are never flat. His use of light and shadow is superlative, and his restrictive camerawork - wardrobe shots, facial close-ups, worm's-eye views, etc., lend a sense of claustrophobia and creeping dread to an already-impressive and hugely effective arsenal of shock moments. His skill at building tension in a such a jaded genre as Horror recalls Hitchcock, and the level of originality with which he treats an ostensibly simplistic storyline is masterful.There's no viable comparison out there to ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". ""Ringu"", ""Dark Water"", ""Ju-On"", ""Into the Mirror"" - all wonderful movies, and each highly deserving of the praise that's heaped upon them. This is different - very different - but wholly deserving of the same level of praise. Visually, chronologically, and emotionally, ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is a total departure from what we in the west are used to within the Asian horror genre, and it's an extremely successful, totally welcome departure.A word of advice to the potential viewer: just let it all wash over you. Don't try to compare it to other movies, and don't try to make sense out of the plot. All is explained in the final frames, and the climax, though not shocking, is all the more effective and memorable because of what has gone before.Totally recommended as a purchase.",5,Gloriously confusing and very beautiful; the connoisseur's horror movie,1132790400,"11 24, 2005",2005,3207,"['review', 'many', 'others', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'spoiler-free', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'simply', 'enough', 'two', 'sisters', 'rebellious', 'Soo-mi', 'shy', 'Soo-yeon', 'arrive', 'back', 'father', 'house', 'period', 'time', 'spent', 'accoring', 'DVD', 'case', 'hospital', 'new', 'stepmother', 'Eun-joo', 'warmth', 'quickly', 'over', 'irritation', 'hostility', 'when', 'strainedness', 'situation', 'supernatural', 'goings-on', 'begin', 'wear', 'down', 'facade', 'seemingly', 'ordinary', 'family', 'life.Firstly', 'performances', 'Su-jeong', 'Lim', 'Soo-mi', 'Jung-ah', 'Yum', 'Eun-joo', 'give', 'rare', 'performances', 'incandescent', 'full', 'life', 'energy', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'not', 'hampered', 'usual', 'restrictions', 'horror', 'genre', 'best', 'antagonistic', 'relationship', 'dynamic', 'so', 'compelling', 'plot', 'essentially', 'unfolds', 'back-to-front', 'anchor', 'viewer', 'world', 'strength', 'powers', 'character', 'creation', 'scene', 'middle', 'night', 'tea-table', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'even', 'horror', 'premise', 'chilling', 'enough', 'stay', 'viewer', 'memory', 'long', 'credits', 'roll.They', 'do', 'have', 'ample', 'support', 'front', 'camera', 'however', 'role', 'Soo-yeon', 'amply', 'little', 'predictably', 'portrayed', 'Geun-yeong', 'Mun', 'Kap-su', 'Kim', 'harangued', 'father-figure', 'Bae', 'Moo-hyeon', 'good', 'too', 'large', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'Still', 'convincingly', 'enough', 'finally', 'own', 'film', 'end.Direction', 'absolutely', 'spellbinding', 'cinematography', 'Ji-woon', 'Kim', 'thrown', 'out', 'almost', 'traditional', 'visual', 'elements', 'Asian', 'horror', 'such', 'tastefully', 'desaturated', 'colours', 'long', 'still', 'shots', 'stop-motion', 'camerawork', 'etc', 'replacing', 'instead', 'unbelievably', 'rich', 'palette', 'colour', 'light', 'Reds', 'are', 'very', 'red', 'blues', 'are', 'deep', 'tranquil', 'blacks', 'are', 'never', 'flat', 'use', 'light', 'shadow', 'superlative', 'restrictive', 'camerawork', 'wardrobe', 'shots', 'facial', 'close-ups', ""worm's-eye"", 'views', 'etc.', 'lend', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'creeping', 'dread', 'already-impressive', 'hugely', 'effective', 'arsenal', 'shock', 'moments', 'skill', 'building', 'tension', 'such', 'jaded', 'genre', 'Horror', 'Hitchcock', 'level', 'originality', 'ostensibly', 'simplistic', 'storyline', 'viable', 'comparison', 'there', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'Ringu', 'Dark', 'Water', 'Ju-On', 'Mirror', 'wonderful', 'movies', 'highly', 'deserving', 'praise', 'heaped', 'different', 'very', 'different', 'wholly', 'deserving', 'same', 'level', 'praise', 'Visually', 'chronologically', 'emotionally', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'total', 'departure', 'what', 'west', 'are', 'used', 'Asian', 'horror', 'genre', 'extremely', 'successful', 'totally', 'welcome', 'departure.A', 'word', 'advice', 'potential', 'viewer', 'just', 'let', 'wash', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'compare', 'other', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'plot', 'explained', 'final', 'frames', 'climax', 'not', 'shocking', 'more', 'effective', 'memorable', 'what', 'gone', 'before.Totally', 'recommended', 'purchase']",N/A

No one's exactly sure what happens in the final twenty minutes of this movie. Everyone's got an opinion, though. I'm no different from anyone else in this regard.What I do know: we start in the middle of the story. The titular two sisters, Su-Mi (...ing's Su-jeon Lim) and Su-Yeoh (Geun-Yeong Moon, recently of Young Bride), are home from the hospital after something that we haven't quite figured out. (The truth is, in fact, danced around the entire film, but you'll figure it out pretty quick.) As one expects to find in any fairy tale, there is an evil stepmother, Eun-joo (Jung-ah Yum, recently seen on this side of the pond in Three...Extremes), although ""evil"" in this case translates to ""overeager, somewhat obnoxious, and a bit vacuous."" Their father, Moo-hyeon (Spin Kick's Kap-su Kim) is distant and stressed-out, and tries to keep the peace, but seems burdened by some weight we are not yet able to see; letting out his frustrations in furtive phone conversations when no one else is around.The story progresses somewhat straightforwardly, actually, until we hit the big reveal. (The big reveal is not what you think it is, and it's likely the big reveal will not be what you guess it is, either.) After that is when people start seeing different interpretations of the fragments that pass before our eyes.Whatever your conclusions, though, you're sure to find a good deal to like in this creepy, stylish thriller. Whether it's the flawless camerawork, the subtle nods to other Asian horror films, the acting of the principals (Kim, though his part is small, brings an odd David Carradine-esque fatalism to it that's both surprising and completely right), the little details in the settings that turn it from an average creepfest into the kind of movie that gets people discussing its final twenty minutes for days on end. *** ",4,Intriguing.,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,1993,"['Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'Kim', 'Ji-Woon', '2003', 'most', 'common', 'reaction', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'Internet', 'message', 'boards', 'like', 'be', 'confusion', 'one', 'exactly', 'sure', 'what', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Everyone', 'got', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'different', 'anyone', 'else', 'regard.What', 'do', 'know', 'start', 'middle', 'story', 'titular', 'two', 'sisters', 'Su-Mi', 'ing', 'Su-jeon', 'Lim', 'Su-Yeoh', 'Geun-Yeong', 'Moon', 'recently', 'Young', 'Bride', 'are', 'home', 'hospital', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figured', 'out', 'truth', 'fact', 'danced', 'entire', 'film', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'pretty', 'quick', 'one', 'find', 'fairy', 'tale', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'Eun-joo', 'Jung-ah', 'Yum', 'recently', 'seen', 'side', 'pond', 'Three', 'Extremes', 'evil', 'case', 'overeager', 'somewhat', 'obnoxious', 'bit', 'vacuous', 'father', 'Moo-hyeon', 'Spin', 'Kick', 'Kap-su', 'Kim', 'distant', 'stressed-out', 'tries', 'keep', 'peace', 'burdened', 'weight', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'able', 'see', 'letting', 'out', 'frustrations', 'furtive', 'phone', 'conversations', 'when', 'one', 'else', 'around.The', 'story', 'somewhat', 'straightforwardly', 'actually', 'hit', 'big', 'reveal', 'big', 'reveal', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'likely', 'big', 'reveal', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'guess', 'either', 'when', 'people', 'start', 'seeing', 'different', 'interpretations', 'fragments', 'pass', 'eyes.Whatever', 'conclusions', 'though', ""'re"", 'sure', 'find', 'good', 'deal', 'like', 'creepy', 'stylish', 'thriller', 'flawless', 'camerawork', 'subtle', 'nods', 'other', 'Asian', 'horror', 'films', 'acting', 'principals', 'Kim', 'part', 'small', 'odd', 'David', 'Carradine-esque', 'fatalism', 'surprising', 'completely', 'right', 'little', 'details', 'settings', 'turn', 'average', 'creepfest', 'kind', 'movie', 'people', 'discussing', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'days', 'end', '***']",N/A

It was almost like something you try to get into but cant but onceyou ""i"" (in this case) had the key in hand it unlocked it with a simple turn of the key.This movie could really drive someone crazy as far as trying to understand it. Let me breakit down for you if you have just watched it and are like ""WHAT!?!"" First of all though i wantto mention the actors all in this movie were all great and the scenery ranged from the scopeof horrid to golden. Soundtrack was Superb. Now lets get to the bottom warining do not readpast this point unless you want to read spoilers of this film.There were two sisters one of which was named Su-Mi and the other of which is namedSu-Yueon.Su-Mi, Su-mi was admitted to the hospital after her learning her mother is dead the culpritwho is the step mother. Let me stop here because im giving you the straight up facts of thefilm, that is reading through all the lines to give you the vision past all what seems likeconfusion, most of which youll never even get while watching the film until later. Su-Mi'sstepmother has issues of her own to say the least, when Su-Mi arrives home from the hospitaldistraught from the death of her mother, her father although a bit dismayed through the filmgoes on and brings her home anyways. Her and her sister Su-Yueon go about having a hard timewith the stepmother, but it is revealed Su-Mi is the one who is really become twisted, out ofall the anger and frustration she begins to have delusions, one of the most powerfull is thather sister (a cute little girl by the way) is still alive. She hates herself and becomes a bitpsychotic but its all under the surface of the story. She blames herself in a way for hersisters death and her mothers. Her sister Su-Yueon although she appears throughout the filmin the powerfull force of memories and rememberance of how sweet the past was, actually diedwhile finding her mother dead in the closet. Su-Yueon becomes ver distressed and the onceshe gets closer the closet a huge one becomes unstable and falls on top of her killing her aswell. Yes all that on top of that with her mother on top of her.Su-Mi goes about some twisted inside rage and goes about pointing out the one thats beenbothering them her and Su-Yueon is her Stepmother, which is correct but she acts out andpersonifies her stepmother as herself not litterally acting like she is the stepmother butin a twisted way blaming her stepmother for all thats wrong with her which is also a fact.But in this film its beautifully written out because she finds out that she begins to under-stand that she was doing cruel things, and in her own perversion she Empathetically morphsthe responsibility for all things that are twisted into one single vision. This is the reasonthis movie tossed a lot of people off the road along the ride. When for example there isscenery of her step mother doing cruel things and its actually her spirit being haunted bywhat her stepmother did to get with her father. Nothing is ever really trully what it seems.In the end there is freedom, and this is why you see the girl walking out of the house tellingher stepmother ive had enough of this and she leaves walking into a field just outside thefront of the house of golden wheat and wind. Her father and stepmother end up taking her backto the hospital but when they get back Both Su-Mi and Su-Yueon are there together swinging onthe swing, her father sees them at least symbolically he feels they are there, the impressionof them end credits. Magnificent film, i hope i got it all right for you people, if not crapi want to see the movie i just imagined! Lol, pfff.

882833,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0007M2374,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 3]","Okay, even though ""A Tale Of Two Sisters"" came out in 2004 I just saw it for the first time recently; its 2004 release date may make this statement somewhat less relevant than if it was brand new but I've still got to say it: just when you start to fear that maybe you've seen all the really radical twists out there and nothing is going to be able to have that same level of surprise revelations, along comes something like A Tale Of Two Sisters.With a ""Sixth Sense""/""Identity"" level twist in there, it also manages to perform the seemingly contradictory feat of having one of the most ambiguous endings ever seen.  The movie's resolution leaves some things even more uncertain but confused than they were at the beginning, but not in a frustrating way - it's left open in a way that's chilling and haunting.Two young girls, Soo-mi and Soo-yeon, return to the country home of their father and stepmother after a period of hospitilzation for some undisclosed problem.  From the beginning, the beauty of the home and its idyllic setting in the Korean countryside is at sharp odds with the almost palpable tension surrounding the homecoming.  It's clear that something unfortunate or disturbing happened at this house in the not too distant past, and though all four of the movie's main characters seem to know what it was, there seems to be an unspoken agreement not to mention it specifically, and characters reference it only obliquely or through their actions.  Therefore the viewer is in the dark and is left to piece together subtle, tantalizing clues.  You start to get more ideas where things are going after a while; I hesitate to say too much about the second half.  Suffice it to say that the twist is major, and that rather than coming right at the end of the movie, A Tale Of Two Sisters continues on a ways past that key shock and gets, if anything, even weirder.The lighting, the sound work, the pacing of even the most 'ordinary' scenes - all kinds of stuff that you often don't notice in a movie unless it's really Bad and fouls things up, is done here so spot-on perfect from start to finish that it's essential to comment on.  All these production values make otherwise attractive scenes downright gorgeous, and make otherwise tense scenes utterly riveting.  The mysterious, just slightly otherwordly (just enough to make you wonder...) atmosphere created in here is remarkable.  And the acting is astonishing; Korean films seem to be very well done in this respect and this is in the top tier.In a movie with relatively little dialogue and even less action (until the end portions of the movie) so much could have gone wrong: the whole movie could have dragged, any number of things could have come off contrived rather than potent, the ambiguous nature of the resolutions could have been maddening rather than rewarding.  Somehow though, everything fit together perfectly.  The way there so many ways to go off the rails would make me extremely wary about the prospects for this movie's upcoming remake even if there wasn't such a glut of them (I actually love a lot of remakes, it's just there's Way too many of them right at the moment).  If ever the chances of lightning striking twice seemed slim this would be it.  I'm not going to urge people to not see the new one (I couldn't if I wanted to, since I haven't seen it myself yet) but this is a case where, if you think it looks good, I'd urge you to not wait just on the basis of the original being subtitled, which I know still puts a lot of people off.  But if you take a chance on subtitles (granted, most of the people reading this are probably already into foreign-language movies) you're likely to discover that there's a ton of great stuff out there in numerous languages that's every bit as good as the best English-language movies.  Now, the remake might turn out to be good too, but this Definately is.On the subject of foreign-language movies (for the benefit of those who might be new to them, which, again, probably doesn't apply to most people reading this) one area where South Korea really excels is with horror movies, like this one.  There's a slew of high-quality ones right here on Amazon, and in addition to A Tale Of Two Sisters two of the best ones I can recommend areThe UninvitedandThe Host (Two-Disc Collector's Edition).",5,"Possibly The Greatest 'Ambiguous ' Movie Ever, Plus Great Twists And Turns",1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,4322,"['Okay', 'even', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'just', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'recently', '2004', 'release', 'date', 'may', 'make', 'statement', 'somewhat', 'less', 'relevant', 'was', 'brand', 'new', ""'ve"", 'still', 'got', 'say', 'just', 'when', 'start', 'fear', 'maybe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'radical', 'twists', 'there', 'nothing', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'same', 'level', 'surprise', 'revelations', 'something', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters.With', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '/', 'Identity', 'level', 'twist', 'there', 'also', 'perform', 'seemingly', 'contradictory', 'feat', 'having', 'one', 'most', 'ambiguous', 'endings', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'resolution', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'uncertain', 'confused', 'were', 'beginning', 'not', 'frustrating', 'way', 'left', 'open', 'way', 'chilling', 'haunting.Two', 'young', 'girls', 'Soo-mi', 'Soo-yeon', 'return', 'country', 'home', 'father', 'stepmother', 'period', 'hospitilzation', 'undisclosed', 'problem', 'beginning', 'beauty', 'home', 'idyllic', 'setting', 'Korean', 'countryside', 'sharp', 'odds', 'almost', 'palpable', 'tension', 'surrounding', 'homecoming', 'clear', 'something', 'unfortunate', 'disturbing', 'happened', 'house', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'past', 'four', 'movie', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'unspoken', 'agreement', 'not', 'mention', 'specifically', 'characters', 'reference', 'only', 'obliquely', 'actions', 'viewer', 'dark', 'left', 'piece', 'together', 'subtle', 'tantalizing', 'clues', 'start', 'get', 'more', 'ideas', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'while', 'hesitate', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'second', 'half', 'Suffice', 'say', 'twist', 'major', 'rather', 'coming', 'right', 'end', 'movie', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'ways', 'key', 'shock', 'anything', 'even', 'weirder.The', 'lighting', 'sound', 'work', 'pacing', 'even', 'most', ""'ordinary"", 'scenes', 'kinds', 'stuff', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'movie', 'really', 'Bad', 'fouls', 'things', 'up', 'done', 'here', 'so', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'start', 'finish', 'essential', 'comment', 'production', 'values', 'make', 'otherwise', 'attractive', 'scenes', 'downright', 'gorgeous', 'make', 'otherwise', 'tense', 'scenes', 'utterly', 'riveting', 'mysterious', 'just', 'slightly', 'otherwordly', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'wonder', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'here', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'astonishing', 'Korean', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'respect', 'top', 'tier.In', 'movie', 'relatively', 'little', 'dialogue', 'even', 'less', 'action', 'end', 'portions', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'wrong', 'whole', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'dragged', 'number', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'contrived', 'rather', 'potent', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'resolutions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'maddening', 'rather', 'rewarding', 'Somehow', 'everything', 'fit', 'together', 'perfectly', 'way', 'there', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'go', 'off', 'rails', 'would', 'make', 'extremely', 'wary', 'prospects', 'movie', 'upcoming', 'remake', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'glut', 'actually', 'love', 'lot', 'remakes', 'just', 'Way', 'too', 'many', 'right', 'moment', 'ever', 'chances', 'lightning', 'striking', 'twice', 'seemed', 'slim', 'would', 'be', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'urge', 'people', 'not', 'see', 'new', 'one', 'could', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'case', 'where', 'think', 'good', ""'d"", 'urge', 'not', 'wait', 'just', 'basis', 'original', 'being', 'subtitled', 'know', 'still', 'lot', 'people', 'take', 'chance', 'subtitles', 'granted', 'most', 'people', 'reading', 'are', 'probably', 'already', 'foreign-language', 'movies', ""'re"", 'likely', 'discover', 'ton', 'great', 'stuff', 'there', 'numerous', 'languages', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'best', 'English-language', 'movies', 'Now', 'remake', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'too', 'Definately', 'subject', 'foreign-language', 'movies', 'benefit', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'new', 'again', 'probably', ""n't"", 'apply', 'most', 'people', 'reading', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'South', 'Korea', 'really', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'slew', 'high-quality', 'ones', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'addition', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'two', 'best', 'ones', 'can', 'recommend', 'areThe', 'UninvitedandThe', 'Host', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition']",N/A

This movie is a masterpiece. It is difficult to describe the film as anything other than a feast for the eyes and senses. It is visually stunning with camera work that rivals anything I have ever seen. Those interested in cinematography will be masterfully impressed. The acting is Oscar quality, something that is rare in many foreign films. The musical score is wondrous. The writing is tight and is so subtle that the revelations that the script brings slowly broadsides the viewer. It drags us kicking and screaming into the dark world that emerges. The film has a creepy quality worthy of Lovecraft, a visual quality worthy of only the finest directors, and a story that is so character driven that I found myself riveted to the screen for the entire film. The horror that unfolds is a metaphor in reality for so many things. In a sense the film almost has a ""Cinderella from Hell"" quality. The sins of the characters are played out in such a psychological manner that the ghostly elements seem almost plausible. It is important to note that ghosts do not scare me. I do not believe in hauntings from the dead. Yet, this film is so rich that I was able to completely dispel my sense of disbelief and allow it to carry me away. The sense of loss and horror makes this film stick with you. It works its way into your subconscious, and honestly, had me very disturbed at its conclusion. I watched it in the daytime. It would be best enjoyed in total darkness in a chilly room with a pal or a date. I have purposely stayed completely away from plot details because the discovery of this masterpiece should come naturally and without warning. Suffice it to say that of the many films I have seen and reviewed, (I would guess thousands)this movie now sits in my top ten list of all time. For me, it is a rare thing when a movie unseats a film from my list. A Tale of Two Sisters does just that. Yes, folks, it is that good. I do not have a single criticism. The film is flawless.

882842,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0007M2374,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[11, 13]","Based on a Korean folktale, writer/director Kim Jee-Won (The same guy who gave us the fantastic ""A Bittersweet Life"" ) has crafted an intelligent, absorbing piece of psychological terror that may stay with you for a long time. ""A TALE OF TWO SISTERS"" is the type of film that may sometimes confuse the viewer, but that confusion is part of its compelling and immersive nature. Pseudo-intellectuals will no doubt have a ball trying to de-code just what this film is all about. The film is part ghost story and part psychological thriller and does not rely on gross-out sequences or cheap scares. Yes, you guessed it, this fabulous film has been marked by Hollywood for remake hell, the news of this just made me cringe.Two very close sisters, Su-mi (Im Su-Jung) and Su-yeon (Moon Geun-Young) return home to their father's dark and foreboding house after a stay in the hospital. Su-mi, the elder of the two, have always been protective of Su-yeon. Their stepmother, Eun-joo (played by beauteous Yeom Jung-Ah) have ruled the household with an iron fist; and meek Su-yeon is incapable of defending herself against the abuse by the stepmother. Their father is taciturn and burdened while Eun-joo greets the two with forced enthusiasm. The two sisters are now back after a long absence in the household, living under the same roof with their stepmother is a nightmare for them. To make matters worse, strange things begin to occur. A strange terrifying presence is being felt in the house. Is this the stepmother trying to scare them or something more sinister?""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is anything but a conventional supernatural horror film. The film draws its strengths from the way it is structured, the film is methodical, cryptic, sometimes confusing and is perfect for multiple viewings. The number of subtle details and clues almost seem endless, the story will catch you by surprise and cause you to drop your guard. One would do well in watching it more than once just so you can see its depths of its script. The first time I saw this film, I was a little annoyed but after awhile, it dawned on me that this film may actually be one of the most compelling psychological horror thrillers I've seen in a long time.The film is actually divided into two acts. The first act deals with the sisters return, while the second half is actually more fragmented than one would think. The first act gives the clues and subtle details. The questions you have to ask yourself are: 1) What is happening to this family? 2) How did it come to this? 3) Why is their father acting so insensitive? The answers are there, and one needs to pay attention. The second half is where all the answers lie, most of the answers are told backwards and the viewer will have to put the sequences all together.The film's foreshadowing holds back the answers in a very compelling manner. The twists and turns will force the viewer to work and the more you see, the more the viewer will get sucked in. Those easily frustrated and annoyed would be well off watching it with someone with a knack for putting together Lynchian-type thrillers. Patience is a must for this type of film. Make certain that the film has your undivided attention, the hints and clues are there. I promise you that the film is set up quite well, and the answers will be there---Well, at least most of the answers, anyway. The film is a clever blend of fantasy, memory and the supernatural. The film won't encourage you to become indifferent but will create an atmosphere full of puzzling structure that works well, so well that it is similar to a fable and a mind-bender; both aspects work in harmony and complements everything else.Aside from its involving storyline, the film's cinematography and direction is the film's biggest strength. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, but maintains that dark and ominous feel. The lighting effects and the atmosphere exudes sheer creepiness, all the while looking quite alluring. The spectacular screenplay is also matched by the cast's powerful performances. Look closely, and you will see the intricacies of the two sisters and their relationship to their parents. Key elements in their roles are played well by Im Soo-Jung and Moon Geun-Young. Their change of emotions are one of the film's very effective trump cards. Beauteous Yeum Jung-Ah (Tell Me Something) is excellent, she plays the stepmother with frightening fervor and an unhinged vitality.Before I begin to ruin the film's experience and start listing the things to look for, I think I should stop here. I have seen this film two times before, and the third time I saw it to prepare for this review, I even uncovered some much more deeper details to the film which I believed I may have missed the first two times. This is the beauty of this film, the film's impact is so compelling that it remains in my mind. The film's ambition is so far reaching that its wonderful experience will be derived from the effort in trying to find all the subtle clues and details.Don't expect a bloody ""gorefest"" or a conventional horror film that relies on scares when you watch this film. The film's beauty borders more on the cerebral side and its psychological aspects will more than likely make the most experienced movie watcher (like me) work. The subtle involvement of ghosts, the traditional imagery that almost gives it an old-fashioned feel is terrific. I hate to take back something I've stated before in my review of ""Spider Forest"" but I have to say it; ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" may well match or even exceed ""Spider Forest"" in terms of compelling material and screenplay (after this third viewing).Those who love mind-benders and psychological horror will be delighted, for this film is one of the very best horror films from South Korea.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is one of the best Korean psychological thriller/horror movies that I've watched [and believe me, I've watched many]. The story centers around sisters Soo-Mi and Su-Yeon who have been away from home for awhile [undergoing treatment for an illness]. Initially they seem happy to be home, until they meet their stepmother. It is obvious the girls do not take to their stepmom, but their dad seems ignorant of the fact. Then the creepy happenings begin...Delving further into the plot will only add to the confusion, for there are many layers to this story. Though the plot unfolds slowly, it manages to grip the viewer - and in fact, I had to watch this movie more than once in order to figure out exactly what was happening. The performances by the cast is credible, and the two girls portraying the troubled sisters are amazing. As with the actress portraying the stepmom, their vivid facial expressions provide as much clues to their emotions as the dialogue. As I watched the movie, my sympathy for them grew, but at some point, I started to question if they were characters to be sympathized with or was there a more sinister aspect to them? This is the conundrum of ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" - one is not sure of what is transpiring, right up until the end [and even then, all questions may not be answered, which is why I had to watch it again!].But, it is worth watching - it's an insightful and creepy movie, a true psychological thriller which is high on atmosphere. The house itself reminds one of a spooky haunted house-type that is rich in Gothic imagery, and almost takes a life of its own. In fact, the house is as much a character in the movie as the actors. Those who love atmospheric horror stories and psychological thrillers will find lots to appreciate and dissect in this movie.",5,You may have to watch this more than once...,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,1867,"['order', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'one', 'best', 'Korean', 'psychological', 'thriller/horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched', '[', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'many', ']', 'story', 'centers', 'sisters', 'Soo-Mi', 'Su-Yeon', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'away', 'home', 'awhile', '[', 'undergoing', 'treatment', 'illness', ']', 'Initially', 'seem', 'happy', 'be', 'home', 'meet', 'stepmother', 'obvious', 'girls', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'stepmom', 'dad', 'ignorant', 'fact', 'Then', 'creepy', 'happenings', 'begin', 'Delving', 'further', 'plot', 'will', 'only', 'add', 'confusion', 'are', 'many', 'layers', 'story', 'plot', 'slowly', 'grip', 'viewer', 'fact', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'order', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'performances', 'cast', 'credible', 'two', 'girls', 'portraying', 'troubled', 'sisters', 'are', 'amazing', 'actress', 'portraying', 'stepmom', 'vivid', 'facial', 'expressions', 'provide', 'much', 'clues', 'emotions', 'dialogue', 'watched', 'movie', 'sympathy', 'grew', 'point', 'started', 'question', 'were', 'characters', 'be', 'sympathized', 'was', 'more', 'sinister', 'aspect', 'conundrum', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Sisters', 'one', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'transpiring', 'right', 'up', 'end', '[', 'even', 'then', 'questions', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'answered', 'why', 'had', 'watch', 'again', ']', '.But', 'worth', 'watching', 'insightful', 'creepy', 'movie', 'true', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'high', 'atmosphere', 'house', 'one', 'spooky', 'haunted', 'house-type', 'rich', 'Gothic', 'imagery', 'almost', 'life', 'own', 'fact', 'house', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'movie', 'actors', 'who', 'love', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'stories', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'will', 'find', 'lots', 'appreciate', 'dissect', 'movie']",N/A
