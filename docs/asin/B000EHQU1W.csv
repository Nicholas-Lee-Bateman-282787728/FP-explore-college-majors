He watched it everyday for about a week, and just like that, he was able to master his letter recognition and their phonetics. He also loves the dvd about vowels. He keeps on singing the vowel songs. Even I was entertained by it. Nothing beats leapfrog if u want your toddler to learn the letters the easy way.",5,"Great, great product!!!",1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,392,"['Such', 'great', 'product', 'then', '3-year', 'old', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'letter', 'factory', 'watched', 'week', 'just', 'was', 'able', 'master', 'letter', 'recognition', 'phonetics', 'also', 'dvd', 'vowels', 'singing', 'vowel', 'songs', 'Even', 'was', 'entertained', 'Nothing', 'beats', 'leapfrog', 'u', 'want', 'toddler', 'learn', 'letters', 'easy', 'way']",Leapfrog Learning: 5-Pack Set (Talking Words Factory / Talking Words Factory II / Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory / Letter Factory / Math Circus)

My daughter started watching ""The Letter Factory"" when she was two years old.  By the time she turned three, she could recognize all the letters, upper and lower case, and she knew the sounds they made. The other titles in the series are just as fun and each teach new skills.

We have only had it for about 1 month and his knowledge of the letters has already improved noticeably. We only watch the first 3 DVDs out of the 5 in the pack for now, until he speaks a little more. He loves it and we use the interactive games in the options menu to practice what he viewed in the DVD, praising him everytime he gets an answer correctly. I think it is a great product BUT I remind parents that your involvement in learning is key. My wife and I don't just sit our son down to watch the DVDs and go do something else, one of us will sit there and say the letters/words with him as if we too are just learning and that adds a level of interest and fun for him.

972993,A5S40MHKXE4Y6,B000EHQU1W,"Tamara L. ""T""","[31, 33]","Every morning when my 28 month old daughter wakes up she says ""I want to watch the green frogs"".  She has learned all her beginning phonics and she sings the ""sounds"" song from ""The Letter Factory"" DVD everywhere.  We even sing it in the grocery store to keep her ""engaged"" in something constructive.  She also has learned how to read simple words (""The Talking Words Factor"" and ""Code Word Caper"") and now she is very interested in learning to read.  She asks me to spell different words all the time.  She even knows how to spell her first name ""Melody"" and even her last name.  The ""Math Circus"" DVD is fabulous too.  I only wish that it focused on counting past ten, too.  Now we count as we do errands in the car and we sing ""The Numbers Song"".  These DVDs really have jump-started her interest in learning to read and to count.I recommended these DVDs to my nephew who did not have as much interest in learning his numbers or letters and now he is on his way to reading, too.These are fabulous.Update:  January 2008.  My daughter is now three.  She just had her third birthday and she requested a ""green frog"" birthday.  She enjoys watching the Leapfrog DVDs so much.  She is continuing to learn both math and reading.  She now sounds out almost every word she sees, including words on cereal boxes and road signs, not to mention words in her books.  She tells her 16 month old brother to ""sound it out"" when they are playing and they are looking at books or anything with words.  Amazingly, my son only knows how to speak a little over a handful of words, but at 16 months, he knows over 50% of his phonics as I quiz him on the alphabet.  So,I continue to highly recommend this set of learning DVDs.",5,GREAT!!!
