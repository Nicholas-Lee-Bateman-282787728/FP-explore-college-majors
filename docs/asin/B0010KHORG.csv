First of all, Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher left this season and even though they show up in the series finale, the magic is gone. Jackie and Fez finally end up together and even though people were upset by that pairing, I kinda always thought they belonged together. The rest of the season is pretty forgettable, I am giving this show 3-star rating because the cast is talented and some of the stories do put a smile on my face.

1125582,ACX8YW2D5EGP6,B0010KHORG,"Alexandra Stephens ""dreamgirl0922""","[80, 97]",Yeah I said it. Season 8 sucked. It wasn't a really season at all. It was just something the writers scrapped together to get by and it wasn't good at all. First of all Randy? What the heck? What was the point of him except to be a hole filler for Eric. And he didn't even do a good job. He was horrible and just a big slut. Donna deserved something better. Okay second of all Jackie and Fez? Okay yes go through the whole entire series and you can see some scenes where you wonder if they'll end up together but to actually have it happen? It was horrible. I mean yes the things they did to each other before they got together to get back at each other was hilarious I'll give the writers that much but the rest of it after they actually got there....I couldn't watch it. It wasn't right. But the worst thing of all...the stripper. Okay why did Hyde have to go marry the stripper? I mean i loved Jackie and Hyde together and personally i think they were just as perfect for each other as Donna and Eric. But to have him go off and marry a stripper just wasn't right. They were making him too much like Bud when they'd already worked so hard to prove that he wasn't anything like him. So it was just a let down to see that all just disappear. That all the hard work Hyde put into proving he was a good man went poof the second that blonde bimbo walked in the room. I don't know maybe someone else has a different opinion of this and hates what I'm saying but i think this season could have been so much better. Lets hope that in the future there's like a reunion special and they rectify what they have done and make their loyal fans happy.

But like most long-running sitcoms, it probably went on for a season or two longer than it should have, and the quality suffered greatly as a result.I'm sure most here know the story.  The principle cast was signed on for the initial 6 seasons, but signed on for an additional 7th season on the general understanding that #7 would (in all likelihood) be the last.  However, the ratings were still strong enough and costs were still relatively low, that Fox decided to renew it for an 8th season.  Unfortunately, Topher Grace's movie career was budding at the time (what happened there, on a side note?), as was Ashton Kutcher's.  Grace would leave at the end of Season 7, while Kutcher would leave a couple of episodes into the 8th.  And while the remaining cast was still plenty talented, they just couldn't fill the void of losing Grace and Kutcher.Really the only reason to purchase this season is to complete your series set.

For some unknown reason the witers chose NOT to have Topher Grace come back as lead character &#34;Eric Forman&#34; with an excuse of him being in Africa. To top it all off the writers also decided to write out Aston Kutchers character &#34;Michael Kelso&#34; (him being the goofiest of them all) as well! Being the good sport I am I stuck with it. Don't get me wrong. This season wasn't a total flop. It just didn't top the others. We do get a big FAT surprise (actually two) at the end though right before the big countdown to 1980.

1125593,AZJ1Y5POXFVNW,B0010KHORG,E. Hirschberg,"[1, 3]","Season eight of That '70s Show is the last season for this wonderful series. With Eric and Kelso gone (Kelso stays until the fourth or fifth episode, then moves to Chicago to help raise his daughter Betsy), there is a gap in the characters. This problem is fixed pretty quickly, with Randy and Samantha being featured in the show for quite a bit of this season. The idea of Randy in my opinion was not a great one, it seems as if the writers tried to make us miss Eric and Kelso less by giving Randy some of the qualities that they had. Season eight starts and ends well, but to me the middle 11 or 12 episodes are not as great as the episodes from previous seasons. I would not say that season eight is the best season, but I also would not call it the worst season of That '70s Show. To me Randy was not really a necessary character, I think they should have written him out of the storylines earlier and had Eric come back an episode or two prior to his series finale return. In addition, Randy seemed to lack humor when saying lines that the writers of the scripts thought were funny. The other characters seem as funny as ever, I really think Randy is the only character who seems to lack any sort of humorous side. Aside from the missing characters, new relationships occur. Donna and Randy get together, as well as Fez and Jackie towards the end of the series. In addition, we find out that Hyde has married a stripper (Samantha), which is not one of this season's best plotlines. Some characters have changed a lot over the eight seasons the show ran, but some characters like Red and Kitty really did not change too much and remained the same for the most part. Is season eight worth buying? Yes, even if the only reason you buy it is to see what happened to some of your favorite characters. Some episodes are up to the standards of the earlier seasons, others aren't.

1125594,A60PQSFWSQK8K,B0010KHORG,Erik Rupp,"[5, 9]","I missed out on That 70's Show during it's initial network run, but after watching a couple episodes on FX I realized that this was a great show and immediately went out and bought the first 3 seasons on DVD.  I grew up as a younger child in the 70's, and I was pleased to see that for the most part they got it right.  It looked and felt like the 70's.  But, what's more important, the producers & writers came up with characters and stories that transcended the decade it's set in.That 70's Show may be based on some real experiences that the producers had, but those experiences were fit into a format very similar to Happy Days.  Eric is Richie, Kelso is Potsie, Fez is Ralph (sort of), and Hyde is a down to earth (non superhuman or supercool) Fonzie.  The show is set in Wisconsin, not far from the Cunningham's Milwaukee setting.  They even reference Happy Days several times, and had both Marion Ross AND Tom Bosley guest star on the show!The biggest similarity plot wise was when Ron Howard left the show the producers of Happy Days conveniently had him get drafted and sent both he and Ralph Malph (Donny Most left the show at the same time) to Greenland.  Here, when Topher Grace left the show the producers sent him (Eric) to Africa!  Clearly, the whole Africa thing was an in-joke about the Richie to Greenland thing - and a convenient way to write Eric out of the show for the final season.A lot has been written and said about the final season - that it isn't any good, that the show had run out of steam, and that they never should have made the eighth season in the first place.  While it's true that the final season clearly misses Eric and Kelso, it isn't nearly as bad as most of the negative reviews and comments would have you believe.The season 8 episodes are still laugh out loud funny.  Mr & Mrs Forman are still fantastic.  Donna is still Donna - one of the most well grounded characters on the show.  Jackie continues to grow as a person, and while many people disagree with her budding interest in Fez in the eighth season, it was set up in the very first season.  Over the course of several episodes over the years it was clear that she would be interested in Fez - if he weren't a damned foreigner!  He always put her on a pedestal and treated her with near worship - just like she always wanted Kelso (and, later, Hyde) to do.  The relationship may not have had the depth of the Jackie/Hyde relationship - but it was only given a couple of episodes to develop.  The Jackie/Hyde relationship was given several years.Randy is another issue that seems to gnaw at many fans.  Yeah, he was kind of forced into the show by the producers - he literally just shows up in the circle at the record store!  His character is a bit of an amalgam of Eric, Kelso, and Hyde (he's got some of Eric's sensitivity, Kelso's vanity and good looks, and is fairly cool, like Hyde), but he doesn't really have his own thing.  Josh Myers plays him as written, trying to fit him into the show like he's always been there.  But, taken in context, Randy isn't all that bad.  He does have some good moments, but lacks the depth that the rest of the characters have, and that may be part of the problem that many fans of the show have with him.  One thing to remember about Randy, though - he is a very accurate presentation of a certain character type that really existed back in the 70's.  VERY accurate.Hyde's marriage to the stripper takes him back to his more rough around the edges and immature version of Hyde from the first season or two, but they forgot to include the social and political awareness that he had during that time.  On the other hand, he's also still one of the best and funniest characters on the show.  The episode where he helps Red sell his heart medication is hilarious!  Hyde's journey through the eighth season shows him overreacting to the Jackie/Chicago debacle in the beginning, but later coming to grips with the fact that marrying the stripper (and not having it annulled) was stupid and immature.Some other highlights of the eighth season include the appearance of Mary Tyler Moore as a morning show TV host, and Don Knotts' appearance as Mr. Furley (more or less).The bottom line is that there is still a lot of entertainment here in the eighth and final season of That 70's Show.

After watching the last season of this show and reading the reviews I agree and disagree with other people.First of all I don't get why people completely hate it. Yes it's going to go down as the worst season because Eric (Topher Grace) and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) aren't there. Nothing can replace them or even come close to seasons 1-7. That's fine. But storylines aren't the strength of this show anyways. The dumb but really funny comedy and smoking circles are the strength of this show. And that will always be there. A lot of stuff they do they would have done if Eric and Kelso were there anyways. And you have to remember Topher and Ashton chose to leave the show so they did the best they could.Also the finale is very good. Kelso and Eric both come back and I thought it was an awesome way to show in their own discreet way that Eric and Donna. will always probably be together. Also it finishes nicely for the other characters. If you don't at least like  the finale I don't think you can call  yourself a fan of the show.Now there are some things I didn't like. Even though I like the personality of  Randy. He completely doesn't fit in with these guys. Saying that the gang barely ever had communication with anyone outside of the group it's a little  weird. Also I hated how they ended things with Jackie and Hyde. As much  as I loved those two together I don't mind Jackie ending up with Fez. I find it  both cool and ironic. Hyde and her never got it together. I just hated how they ended it. I just hoped that it would end better and more real then himmarrying a stripper. That's just a joke. It doesn't make sense on any level.He tells Jackie he's not ready to get married. Then he stays married to arandom stripper because she's a stripper. That's probably what I hate themost. Other then that it's just the lack of presence of Eric and Hyde.But overall this whole show is friggin amazing. I will always love it. Like I said the 8th is probably the worst because of characters. But don't fool yourselfthe comedy is still good so I still enjoyed it as much as I could. Especially the finale. This will always be the number 1 stoner show man.,3,The Final Season,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,2252,"['am', 'someone', 'who', 'fan', 'seasons', '1-7', '70s', 'Show', 'show', 'general', 'watching', 'last', 'season', 'show', 'reading', 'reviews', 'agree', 'disagree', 'other', 'people.First', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'people', 'completely', 'hate', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'worst', 'season', 'Eric', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Kelso', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'Nothing', 'can', 'replace', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'seasons', '1-7', 'fine', 'storylines', 'are', ""n't"", 'strength', 'show', 'dumb', 'really', 'funny', 'comedy', 'smoking', 'circles', 'are', 'strength', 'show', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'lot', 'stuff', 'do', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'Eric', 'Kelso', 'were', 'anyways', 'have', 'remember', 'Topher', 'Ashton', 'chose', 'leave', 'show', 'did', 'best', 'could.Also', 'finale', 'very', 'good', 'Kelso', 'Eric', 'come', 'back', 'thought', 'was', 'awesome', 'way', 'show', 'own', 'discreet', 'way', 'Eric', 'Donna', 'will', 'always', 'probably', 'be', 'together', 'Also', 'nicely', 'other', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'least', 'finale', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'call', 'fan', 'show.Now', 'are', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Even', 'like', 'personality', 'Randy', 'completely', ""n't"", 'fit', 'guys', 'Saying', 'gang', 'barely', 'ever', 'had', 'communication', 'anyone', 'group', 'little', 'weird', 'Also', 'hated', 'how', 'ended', 'things', 'Jackie', 'Hyde', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'two', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Jackie', 'ending', 'up', 'Fez', 'find', 'cool', 'ironic', 'Hyde', 'never', 'got', 'together', 'just', 'hated', 'how', 'ended', 'just', 'hoped', 'would', 'end', 'better', 'more', 'real', 'then', 'himmarrying', 'stripper', 'just', 'joke', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'level.He', 'tells', 'Jackie', 'not', 'ready', 'get', 'married', 'Then', 'married', 'arandom', 'stripper', 'stripper', 'probably', 'what', 'hate', 'themost', 'Other', 'then', 'just', 'lack', 'presence', 'Eric', 'Hyde.But', 'overall', 'whole', 'show', 'friggin', 'amazing', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'said', '8th', 'probably', 'worst', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'fool', 'yourselfthe', 'comedy', 'still', 'good', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'Especially', 'finale', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'number', '1', 'stoner', 'show', 'man']",N/A

With the loss of its two big characters, the addition of one lousy character, and nearly seven seasons of almost perfection, the show had finally run its course.Now that's not to say the season was a complete failure. There are a few very funny episodes scattered through out, like when Jacki goes to work for a popular talk show hostess (played by 70's icon Mary Tyler Moore), Hyde getting married to a stripper, and a few others as well. So it wasn't like the season was an almost complete loss.And I will say this, when it came time for the producers to end the show, they definintly did it right. The finale really made up for weak season, with plot elements succesfully tied up, all the characters showing up, and of course, the heart and humor was there, all without the episode feeling overstuffed and convulted. In fact, I would go as far as to rank the series finale as one of the best in recent television.For those who have loved the season, buy the set for the series finale.

1125612,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B0010KHORG,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[5, 6]","Season 8 was hated by most fans, and I mean put the emphasis on HATED. A few things explains that; Eric was ""in Africa"" and was not present at all in season 8 except for the finale (actor Topher Grace wanted to move on in his acting career and was working on Spiderman 3 at the time), Kelso was only present in a handful of episodes including the finale, Hyde married Samantha (a stripper he met in Vegas), plus the new guy who is supposed to fill in as some kind of replacement for Eric's absence, Randy, was generally poorly received.Looking at it that way it's easy to see why season 8 is constantly said to be the worst and weak. Plus looking at an entire season without Eric seems impossible, he is such an important part of the show; after all this is HIS family, HIS friends, HIS basement...well you get the idea and you just can't ignore that fact. Kelso was present for a few episodes and it certainly helped but he too was an important part of That 70's Show (actor Ashton Kutcher also wanted to move on with his acting career and at the time was filming The Guardian). That said I didn't hate the new guy Randy, you either love him or hate him, I thought he was an interesting character. If you hate Randy I understand you, it's kinda hard to swallow that he is supposed to replace Eric, however if you hate it you are not alone, Fez did too and it made this situation very funny! (You could probably appeal to how Fez feels!) Many fans felt that breaking up Hyde and Jackie was a big mistake and many feel a particularly low point of the season was when an erotic dancer Hyde married arrived to Point Place. Also many fans of the show felt that the Jackie-Fez relationship should never have happened and was another msitake. There are still a few memorable episodes but hardcore fans of the first 7 seasons will probably not find much to enjoy out of season 8 except the finale.As hated as it is season 8 does have its good moments, for instance look at the finale, it was done in a proper manner and Eric and Kelso are back. If there's one thing you have to like about season 8 it's the finale! Season 8 also lead to some interesting scenarios, having Fez and Jackie live together was quite funny at times and Hyde owning and managing a record store was terrific. There's also more of Hyde's father and his sister from season 7, and Fez's relationship with his landlord Phantom was neat. I wish some things would have been different so that season 8 could be a proper ending season to the show but you have to understand that they had a contract for an 8th season and even if they lost 2 of the main actors they had to continue. Maybe fan would have preferred to have the show end with season 7, maybe that was the thing to do but I don't hate season 8 just like I don't love it. I don't think season 8 was absolute garbage nor do I think that it was the worst season ever in the history of television. It's obviously the weakest season of the show but I still enjoyed it for what it was. However I'm not sure I can really recommend it! I'll give it 3 stars.",3,That 70's Show Took Quite A Turn In Season 8,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,3071,"['Season', '8', 'was', 'hated', 'most', 'fans', 'mean', 'put', 'emphasis', 'HATED', 'A', 'few', 'things', 'Eric', 'was', 'Africa', 'was', 'not', 'present', 'season', '8', 'finale', 'actor', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'wanted', 'move', 'acting', 'career', 'was', 'working', 'Spiderman', '3', 'time', 'Kelso', 'was', 'only', 'present', 'handful', 'episodes', 'including', 'finale', 'Hyde', 'married', 'Samantha', 'stripper', 'met', 'Vegas', 'new', 'guy', 'who', 'supposed', 'fill', 'as', 'kind', 'replacement', 'Eric', 'absence', 'Randy', 'was', 'generally', 'poorly', 'received.Looking', 'way', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'season', '8', 'constantly', 'said', 'be', 'worst', 'weak', 'looking', 'entire', 'season', 'Eric', 'impossible', 'such', 'important', 'part', 'show', 'HIS', 'family', 'HIS', 'HIS', 'basement', 'well', 'get', 'idea', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'fact', 'Kelso', 'was', 'present', 'few', 'episodes', 'certainly', 'helped', 'too', 'was', 'important', 'part', '70', 'Show', 'actor', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'also', 'wanted', 'move', 'acting', 'career', 'time', 'was', 'filming', 'Guardian', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'new', 'guy', 'Randy', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'character', 'hate', 'Randy', 'understand', 'kinda', 'hard', 'swallow', 'supposed', 'replace', 'Eric', 'however', 'hate', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'Fez', 'did', 'too', 'made', 'situation', 'very', 'funny', 'could', 'probably', 'appeal', 'how', 'Fez', 'Many', 'fans', 'felt', 'breaking', 'up', 'Hyde', 'Jackie', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'many', 'feel', 'particularly', 'low', 'point', 'season', 'was', 'when', 'erotic', 'dancer', 'Hyde', 'married', 'arrived', 'Point', 'Place', 'Also', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'felt', 'Jackie-Fez', 'relationship', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'was', 'msitake', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'first', '7', 'seasons', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'season', '8', 'finale.As', 'hated', 'season', '8', 'have', 'good', 'moments', 'instance', 'look', 'finale', 'was', 'done', 'proper', 'manner', 'Eric', 'Kelso', 'are', 'back', 'one', 'thing', 'have', 'like', 'season', '8', 'finale', 'Season', '8', 'also', 'lead', 'interesting', 'scenarios', 'having', 'Fez', 'Jackie', 'live', 'together', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'times', 'Hyde', 'owning', 'managing', 'record', 'store', 'was', 'terrific', 'also', 'more', 'Hyde', 'father', 'sister', 'season', '7', 'Fez', 'relationship', 'landlord', 'Phantom', 'was', 'neat', 'wish', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'so', 'season', '8', 'could', 'be', 'proper', 'ending', 'season', 'show', 'have', 'understand', 'had', 'contract', '8th', 'season', 'even', 'lost', '2', 'main', 'actors', 'had', 'continue', 'Maybe', 'fan', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'have', 'show', 'end', 'season', '7', 'maybe', 'was', 'thing', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'season', '8', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'season', '8', 'was', 'absolute', 'garbage', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'worst', 'season', 'ever', 'history', 'television', 'obviously', 'weakest', 'season', 'show', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'really', 'recommend', ""'ll"", 'give', '3', 'stars']",N/A

I rented it a couple of years ago and I thought it was going to be great. I pictured a good well structured ending but I was disappointed. After I learned that Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher had left the show, I kind of had a bad feeling that the show was going to fall apart. I mean, the show was based on solely one character--Eric. Or at least, everything revolved around the life of this character. If you remove the main character, well, you can be sure is not going to be the same. The show lost its essence. It was not as funny anymore. It seemed to me that the makers of the show completely forgot about Eric throughout season 8.
