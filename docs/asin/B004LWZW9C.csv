I just fell in love with it since the beginning, because it's not only about the holidays, it gives an amazing message to all the people.Full of dreams, and maybe sometimes cheesy, ""New Year's Eve"" delivers the thing that the movie is made for: light entertainment, but somehow it made my heart melt.The cast was amazing, some plots were strong (Robert DeNiro) and some others weak (Lea Michele/Ashton Kutcher) but the Michelle Pfeiffer story was my favorite one.Anyway, I can't wait to buy this film!

Of course people will call this film predictable and cheesy just like all the romantic built movies, but honestly there is not one romantic type of movie that is not predictable. Of course you know what's going to happen at the end since it's called a romantic movie. I personally loved this movie, it had a lot of laughs and a couple parts where I got teary eyed. The movie has well put together characters and a very good plot. The ending just like Valentine's Day where it brought characters throughout the movie together some predictable and some were the complete opposite of predictable. I Love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies or likes Valentine's Day. Who cares what the critics say they are wrong most of the time.

I just gave you a scooch of the experience of watching New Year's Eve, a movie overstuffed with characters who exposite who they are, what they are doing, and their motivations. The result is a sad spectacle of A and B list actors almost painfully going through the motions with stilted dialogue, explaining to the audience at every turn exactly the implications of the plot developments. ""We're not sure if we'll be able to fix it."" ""But we must fix it before midnight!"" ""We want to have the baby right after midnight so we can get the prize money!"" I mean, are you kidding me with this dialogue?To sum up, I really hated this boring and pointless movie and didn't care about what happened to any of the characters at all. There was one short scene in which a woman was mean to an aspiring actress server that was well done. Right after that there's a speech with a woman holding a dog with no less than three continuity errors involving the position of the dog. (My wife pointed this out. I was proud of her. It's the kind of movie where you notice these kinds of things, as they are the most interesting aspects of the movie.)As a sidenote, earlier in the day I watchedWe're the Millers (Blu-ray+DVD+UltraViolet Combo Pack), which was incredibly hilarious and well done. Watch that instead.Another note: whoever was able to assemble this cast deserves some kind of award. A shame they were all squandered. (Caveat: Sofia Vergara is amazing as usual.) It's kind of like one of those yogurt places where you can get all kinds of toppings. Amazing toppings, but the yogurt is actually dog poo.

1416891,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B004LWZW9C,Brad Baker,"[1, 7]","""New Years Eve"" is the lives of several couples and singles in New York who connect over the course of the holiday. Eventually, they all go to Times Square to see the ball drop at midnight. Hector Elizondo is a repairman who arrives at the last minute to repair the ball. Two young attractives locked in an elevator; a rock-star's ex-girl friend returns for his concert; and a middle-aged spinster quits her job and falls for Zac Efron. Hmmmmm....There's some funny stuff here. But tacky is two pregnant women trying to force/forward their baby's birth to win a $25,000 contest. Tacky. Not funny. It's all wrapped in fluffy, TV-sitcom land. A frail, sickly old man is played by a frail, sickly Robert de Niro. Most excellent is his nurse, played by Halle Berry. The real bonus in ""New Years Eve"" is the talent, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Alyssa Milano(I didn't see her), Jessica Biel, Penny Marshall, Hilary Swank, Ryan Seacrest, Michael Bloomberg, Matthew Broderick, Jon Bon Jovi, James Belushi, Sarah Jessica Parker, John Lithgow, and a very bored-looking Ashton Kurcher.

Compared to ""Pretty Woman"", ""New Year's Eve"" is an about to be cancelled sitcom.""New Year's Eve"" takes on eight different stories in the lives of New Yorkers preparing for the 2012 Times Square ball drop. The stories may or may not intertwine. One thing to note about the movie is that they had no problem getting a treasure of recognizable to Oscar winning or deserving actors. For instance, Hilary Swank, Oscar winner twice, plays the ball drop organizer. Halle Berry, another Oscar winner, plays a nurse overlooking a dieing patient played by Robert DeNiro who's won two Oscars himself and probably should have won more. Michelle Pfeiffer, nominated three times for Oscar, plays a timid lady who wants to learn how to live, all in one night.Despite the presence of these fantastic actors, much of the acting and scenes appear to be unprepared or rushed. It was as if they all got their scripts and two days later, filmed it.  Although to be fair, the storylines that involved Swank, Berry and DeNiro were the ones that hit home with me the most.There are poignant moments in ""New Year's Eve"". There were even a few moments where I was even touched. Some of the elements that a movie about New Year's Eve should have were done well. Say goodbye. Say hello. Live better. Give more. Learn from mistakes. Spend time with loved ones. Although as a comedy, the movie fails badly. The funniest moments of the film were at the conclusion of the movie when they aired a blooper reel during the closing credits.I'm not a big fan of these type movies where they are telling multiple stories and bouncing back and forth. You don't get a true feeling of relation to the characters and it's hard to get into a flow with a story when it's changing every five minutes. Although Robert DeNiro proves that a great actor can hook you in a matter of seconds. Unfortunately, he's one actor and one story in a movie full of dozens of actors and multiple stories.""New Year's Eve"" does take you right smack dab in the middle of a night in New York City during the ball drop ceremony, which is a cool thing if you've never been, but it has a thrown together feel and it cheapens the movie. The final twenty minutes of the movie were fun, but the movie as a whole was unpolished and disappointing.",1,OSCAR winning stars and a RAZZY winning screenplay,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",2011,2715,"['New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'latest', 'release', 'Director', 'Gary', 'Marshall', 'writer', 'Katherine', 'Fugate', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'previously', 'released', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'have', 'holiday', 'theme', 'going', 'here', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'gimmick', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'day', 'Marshall', 'had', 'share', 'smash', 'hits', 'long', 'career', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'films', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'big', 'one', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Compared', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'be', 'cancelled', 'sitcom', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'eight', 'different', 'stories', 'lives', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'preparing', '2012', 'Times', 'Square', 'ball', 'drop', 'stories', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'intertwine', 'One', 'thing', 'note', 'movie', 'had', 'problem', 'getting', 'treasure', 'recognizable', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'deserving', 'actors', 'instance', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'twice', 'ball', 'drop', 'organizer', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'nurse', 'overlooking', 'dieing', 'patient', 'played', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'who', 'won', 'two', 'Oscars', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'more', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'nominated', 'three', 'times', 'Oscar', 'timid', 'lady', 'who', 'learn', 'how', 'live', 'one', 'presence', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'much', 'acting', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'unprepared', 'rushed', 'was', 'got', 'scripts', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'filmed', 'be', 'fair', 'storylines', 'involved', 'Swank', 'Berry', 'DeNiro', 'were', 'ones', 'hit', 'home', 'are', 'poignant', 'moments', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'were', 'even', 'few', 'moments', 'where', 'was', 'even', 'touched', 'elements', 'movie', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'should', 'have', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'Say', 'goodbye', 'Say', 'hello', 'Live', 'better', 'Give', 'more', 'Learn', 'mistakes', 'Spend', 'time', 'loved', 'ones', 'comedy', 'movie', 'badly', 'funniest', 'moments', 'film', 'were', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'when', 'aired', 'blooper', 'reel', 'closing', 'credits.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'type', 'movies', 'where', 'are', 'telling', 'multiple', 'stories', 'bouncing', 'back', 'forth', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'true', 'feeling', 'relation', 'characters', 'hard', 'get', 'flow', 'story', 'when', 'changing', 'five', 'minutes', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'great', 'actor', 'can', 'hook', 'matter', 'seconds', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'actor', 'one', 'story', 'movie', 'full', 'dozens', 'actors', 'multiple', 'stories', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'take', 'right', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'night', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'ball', 'drop', 'ceremony', 'cool', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'thrown', 'together', 'feel', 'movie', 'final', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'were', 'fun', 'movie', 'whole', 'was', 'unpolished', 'disappointing']",N/A

But the bouncing around from micro story to micro story works OK because it gives the actors involved a chance to come on set for a day or two of work and leave unstressed and financially healthy.

Allow me to elaborate: Two couples competing to have the first baby in the new year; a teenager who disobeys her mother to run about Times Square with her crush, a man who has been waiting AN ENTIRE YEAR to re-meet some lady with whom he shared a moment on NYE 2011, a bitter guy who hates NYE for really no good reason; and so on and so forth.  Seriously, is this how deep our lives get?  Something about this is just too bothersome to me.  Maybe it was the lack of diversity insofar as to whom this movie was targeted--a very middle class to upper middle class, American audience.  Maybe it was because the Ball dropping in Times Square supposedly set the tone for the hopes and dreams of not only everyone in the country but in the world.  It's commercial.  It's materialistic.  It's disingenuously saccharine.  But above all, it's 1-dimensional.  Don't get me wrong, there were some good moments for me--usually the scenes involving Hilary Swank.  But overall, this movie needs to retire with the New Year.But as the title suggests, some people like this sappy, gimmicky stuff.  And that's ok.  I've given ""Valentine's Day"" a chance.  I gave this a chance.  No more.

I had great expectation and been patiently waiting the DVD to arrive at my mail box. After watching it I just felt being robbed of 2 hours of my life. Seeing so many great actors in this movie really excited me, but the movie is just plain boring and such a disappointment. The storyline is so plain and weak, the characters totally lack of connection and no sparks between each couples whatsoever. The actors, being all A-list big names and all, played horribly like they didn't even care. The only one that actually caught my eye and was playing his role decently with efforts is Zac Efron. The others, including Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, were so bad like they didn't get paid making this movie. I thought Valentine's Day was bad enough, but New Year's Eve is just unbearable.

1416926,AIO247KHD2O40,B004LWZW9C,James N Simpson,"[3, 4]","New Year's Eve with a massive line up of household name actors is such a letdown due to the fact they are all playing characters we already know them as, just with different names. Lithgow pretty much just replayed Dr Dick Solomon from 3rd Rock from the Sun.  Lea Michele's character Elise might have well have just been named Rachel as she was exactly the same as that character from Glee, even singing a duet song as Bon Jovi does his side of it in a kitchen miles away while she's stuck in an elevator. If the plot had just said Rachel Berry got a gig to back up Jensen and got stuck in an elevator this could have been an episode of Glee.  Why get Jon Bon Jovi to play a singer?  Gee what a stretch for him.  He's been trying to become an actor for a few decades now, if he can't play anything but a face for the same old same old written female character to fall in love with or a singer, in this case both, then it's time to maybe stick to being in a rock band Jon. Hiegel played the same character we've seen over and over again in her movies since she left Grey's Anatomy. Why not have Jon playing Ashton Kutcher's character or John Lithgow's and have one of them be the singer instead?  Would have provided a bit of an acting challenge for everyone?  Kutcher as the guy who has let himself go by growing a beard and wearing pyjamas outside his apartment is just playing whatever his character's name was who replaced Charlie Sheen in Two and a Half Men which was based on Kelso from That 70s Show to begin with. Ava was just Gloria from Modern Family, complete with the over the top exaggerated mispronunciations of the English language written for Gloria.  I like that character but if I'm watching Sofia Vergara in something that isn't Modern Family I want to believe her next line isn't going to be Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy! I don't understand why any of these actors took these roles, the thing history has taught us, is to cash in on your fame while you've got a huge fan base from your popular TV show and film investors chasing ticket sales are prepared to cast you, play something completely different so when that show ends you aren't typecast.There's some plot spoilers in the rest of this review if you choose to keep reading. The only decent acting was from Abigail Breslin playing the daughter who is the victim of an overprotective paranoid parent played by Sarah Jessica Parker.  However she had a very poor script to follow, it's unlikely in the real world an older teenager so determined to want to spend New Year's Eve with her friends wouldn't argue it a bit more forcibly when you're actually in Manhattan rather than go home and sneak out your bedroom window (where Hollywood style we don't ever have security screens let alone fly screens making this possible) so early in the day you know you're mother will find out anyway. Plus when you see your boyfriend kissing some other girl from your school in a lengthy kiss you'd have to be an absolute idiot to just take them back.  Even if she believed he didn't instigate it, he didn't push the other girl away at any time either.  Parker as the paranoid parent plays that well, but being the one a much younger Josh Duhamel is pushing away beautiful girls his own age throwing themselves at him to see again is a bit of a stretch. Even if you buy that, how did she organise a horse drawn carriage in a few minutes and why even bother before you know if he is even there being that you haven't even left your daughter at least half an hour after the scheduled meeting time.Other than Breslin, surprisingly it was Zac Efron that was one of the only other actors who provided a bit of acting away from his normal role, along with Michelle Pfeiffer who he as a courier decides to help have a sort of midlife crisis revelation and start to live life possibly for her first time ever.  Deniro as a lonely dyeing patient was also good as was Halle Berry as his nurse.  But really everyone else just replayed characters they play in sitcoms making the overall viewing experience very predictable and disappointing. This movie has an opportunity to be something great with the cast that signed on, it's a shame they obviously couldn't afford any decent writers or couldn't be bothered as they knew fans of those celebrities would watch this anyway. Possibly the actors themselves don't have the ability to play anything beyond what they already do.

I kind of liked it.  Nice fluff.  It's an ensemble cast set up just like in ""Valentine's Day"" except this one is on ""New Year's Eve"".  Some of the pairings include, Sarah Jessica Parker & Abigail Breslin who play Mother and Daughter offering one of the more bouncier & interesting pairings in the film.  Josh Duhamel searches diligently for his soul mate he met & lost one year ago.  Jessica Biel & Seth Meyers play husband and wife in one of the more unnecessary subplots in the film.  Robert DeNiro & Halle Berry manage to bring deep emotion into the lackluster words printed on the script thus making it believable.  Katherine Heigl & Sofia Vergara give us light comic relief in their bits.Despite the critics attacks on the film they do manage to praise one tiny element within each of their scathing reviews.  They loved the Michelle Pfieffer - Zac Efron sequences, more or less calling it the film's saving grace.  I agree.  I could've watched the entire movie with just them and be fine.  If only the entire movie could've surfaced around their characters.  They were the only actors that actually developed and fleshed out the roles they were playing as much as they could.  It ended up being the surprising charm behind the film and thus allowing me to give it one more star necessary just for them.Most of us have guilty pleasures and we want to escape the stresses, depressions and feelings of isolation in our lives and simply escape into a fantasy.  ""New Year's Eve"" can accomplish that.The film is a completely unrealistic and contrived world, yet it's bright, fun and full of love. There are many out there exhausted with fighting our day to day battles and watching another overblown shoot 'em up movie with no point.

It has real humor, great complex characters and humongous heart. Don't miss this. Another great script from Katherine Fugate in the same vain as last year's ""Valentine's Day"" (which she also wrote)- this film has the same concept of 20 characters with 5 story lines that all end up in the same place and crossing each other's paths! Directed by Garry Marshall himself (""Pretty Women"", ""Valentine's Day"", ""The Princess Diaries"", ""Beaches"") - the film takes the lives of a depressed and self-deprecating worker (Michelle Pfieffer of `The Fabulous Baker Boys') who is challenged and amazed by a young currier carrier (Zac Efron of `High School Musical') - and - a negatively scarred young comic book illustrator (Ashton Kutcher of `Two and a half Men') and a confident yet fearful background singer (Lea Michele of `Glee') forced to learn about each other in the confines of one space for hours - and - a mother (Sarah Jessica Parker of `Sex In The City') and her daughter (Abigail Breslin of `Kitt Kittridge') learning that although they have each other...they need to expand their own hearts to the opposite sex - and - a first-class Chef (Katherine Heigl of `Roswell', `The Ugly Truth') in a cross romance with a career driven rock star (Jon Bon Jovi of `Ali McBeal')...And - a lonely man (Robert De Niro of `Raging Bull') who's dying is befriended by a sympathetic nurse (Halle Barry of `X-Men', `Monsters Ball') with a major hole in her life - and - two pregnant mothers (Jessica Biel of `The A Team', `7h Heaven' and Sarah Paulson of `Serenity')with their husbands (Seth Meyers of `SNL', Valentine's Day' and Til Schwieger of `The Three Musketeers', Inglorious Bastards') competing for the births of their babies to happen before midnight New Year's Eve - and - a project coordinator of the New York New Year's Eve celebration at times square wh has a morale and social delema working through her job and her heart played by Hilary Swank (`Million Dollar Baby', `Boys Don't Cry') with the confused life of Josh Duhamel (`Transformers')...And - sprinkle in the memorable performances of actors like Cary Elwes , Hector Alizondo, James Belushi Sophia Vergara, John Lithgow, Russel Peters, Larry Miller, Jack McGee, Yeardly Smith, Ludacris and Penny Marshall (Garry's younger sister!) - you a very entertaining movie. You will literally, laugh and cry - sometimes at the same time too! Great family film with a ot of real-life typr situations that make all the characters believable.

1416940,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B004LWZW9C,M. Bullions,"[3, 7]","I hated and loved 2010's ""Valentine's Day"", Garry Marshall's attempt at ""Love Actually"". This film had almost two dozen big names, and had stories that I had seen done in countless films before. There was nothing original about it, but it was a pleasant way to spend a few hours. In the end, I did kind of like it. I hated the way that it didn't give its characters enough time to grow into anything more but caricatures, but it made me smile. I enjoyed the ways that the stories came together in the end, I guess you could say.I was hoping that ""New Year's Eve"", which may as well have been a sequel to ""Valentine's Day"", having the same filmmakers, and a slew of other big names, would be an improved version of ""Valentine's Day"". This one had the exact same effect. It had half-stories that felt extremely gimmicky, a cast that was eager to please, but didn't have any place to go, because they weren't given anything interesting to do. I blame Katherine Fugate for doing to this, what she did to ""Valentine's Day"" a few years ago.I like a GOOD romantic comedy. I can forgive an unrealistic or unoriginal story if the cast is amiable and charming enough, but this one is unforgivable. I had a nice time at the actual movie, because it was pleasant enough for me to temporarily overlook its obvious shortcomings. It threw its two dozen fantastic actors (this time including some Oscar winners such as Hilary Swank, Halle Berry and Robert DeNiro) into trivial scenarios that end up being less than they began, which is saying alot.For examples of why this film is so ridiculous, I will bother to explain some of its idiotic excuses for plotlines. Katherine Heigl plays the scorned woman, who was broken up with by Jon Bon Jovi the previous New Year's. Robert DeNiro is a dying man whose last wish before dying is to see the ball drop in Times Square one last time before he croaks, and Halle Berry is his nurse. ""Little Miss Sunshine""`s Abigail Breslin is a rebellious teenager who wants to go to a party, and her mother (Sarah Jessica Parker) won't let her.These stories have been done to death, and the characters are caricatures once again. The festive nature of New Year's makes it watchable, albeit barely. I enjoyed seeing so many actors that I recognized, but they were simply not given enough material to work with, that could have possibly saved this train wreck. For example, I love Sofia Vergara on the television program ""Modern Family"", because she is absolutely hilarious, making a character that could have been a dry caricature her own, and making her character detailed and exciting. She only brings life to the few scenes that she is given, although she is reduced to a ""sidekick"" role who doesn't even have her own story line.I was glad to see Lea Michele working in a project that wasn't ""Glee"", but she has a stupid part in this, playing a background singer (yeah right...) who is stuck in an elevator with Ashton Kutcher, who apparently hates everything about New Year's. I understand the characters in ""Valentine's Day"" who hated the holiday that the film was celebrating, but come on now. Who hates new year's?While I don't understand how this film's budget was large enough to pay all of its actors, I can tell that the script was probably scribbled down in a few hours. Not very much attention and money was paid to cinematography, and there is an upsetting amount of product placement scattered throughout the film. Like I said, I had a nice time watching this. I thought it was a pleasant way to spend a few hours. But now that it is the new year, it has zero re-watch value. Once I thought about the film that I had seen, I realized how easy it was to hate.Grade: D+",2,New Year's Eve: A beautiful hot mess,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,3696,"['hated', 'loved', '2010', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'attempt', 'Love', 'Actually', 'film', 'had', 'almost', 'two', 'dozen', 'big', 'names', 'had', 'stories', 'had', 'seen', 'done', 'countless', 'films', 'was', 'nothing', 'original', 'was', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'end', 'did', 'kind', 'hated', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'characters', 'enough', 'time', 'grow', 'anything', 'more', 'caricatures', 'made', 'smile', 'enjoyed', 'ways', 'stories', 'came', 'together', 'end', 'guess', 'could', 'say.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'sequel', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'having', 'same', 'filmmakers', 'slew', 'other', 'big', 'names', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'version', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'one', 'had', 'exact', 'same', 'effect', 'had', 'half-stories', 'felt', 'extremely', 'gimmicky', 'cast', 'was', 'eager', 'please', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'place', 'go', 'were', ""n't"", 'given', 'anything', 'interesting', 'do', 'blame', 'Katherine', 'Fugate', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'few', 'years', 'ago.I', 'GOOD', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'can', 'forgive', 'unrealistic', 'unoriginal', 'story', 'cast', 'amiable', 'charming', 'enough', 'one', 'unforgivable', 'had', 'nice', 'time', 'actual', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'temporarily', 'overlook', 'obvious', 'shortcomings', 'threw', 'two', 'dozen', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'time', 'including', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'such', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'trivial', 'scenarios', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'less', 'began', 'saying', 'alot.For', 'examples', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'will', 'bother', 'explain', 'idiotic', 'excuses', 'plotlines', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'scorned', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'broken', 'up', 'Jon', 'Bon', 'Jovi', 'previous', 'New', 'Year', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'dying', 'man', 'last', 'wish', 'dying', 'see', 'ball', 'drop', 'Times', 'Square', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'nurse', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 's', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'rebellious', 'teenager', 'who', 'go', 'party', 'mother', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'her.These', 'stories', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'characters', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'festive', 'nature', 'New', 'Year', 'watchable', 'albeit', 'barely', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'recognized', 'were', 'simply', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'material', 'work', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'saved', 'train', 'wreck', 'example', 'love', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'television', 'program', 'Modern', 'Family', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'making', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'dry', 'caricature', 'own', 'making', 'character', 'detailed', 'exciting', 'only', 'life', 'few', 'scenes', 'given', 'reduced', 'sidekick', 'role', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'own', 'story', 'line.I', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'Lea', 'Michele', 'working', 'project', 'was', ""n't"", 'Glee', 'stupid', 'part', 'playing', 'background', 'singer', 'yeah', 'right', 'who', 'stuck', 'elevator', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'apparently', 'everything', 'New', 'Year', 'understand', 'characters', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'who', 'hated', 'holiday', 'film', 'was', 'celebrating', 'come', 'now', 'Who', 'new', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'film', 'budget', 'was', 'large', 'enough', 'pay', 'actors', 'can', 'tell', 'script', 'was', 'probably', 'scribbled', 'down', 'few', 'hours', 'Not', 'very', 'much', 'attention', 'money', 'was', 'paid', 'cinematography', 'upsetting', 'amount', 'product', 'placement', 'scattered', 'film', 'said', 'had', 'nice', 'time', 'watching', 'thought', 'was', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'now', 'new', 'year', 'zero', 're-watch', 'value', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'realized', 'how', 'easy', 'was', 'hate.Grade', 'D+']",N/A

Rredictable from the first instant to the last, it's as shallow and lifeless as they come. At some point, somebody involved must have had an impulse that was sincere and genuine, but there is no shred of authenticity left in this deathly film. New Year's Eve is a pastiche of numerous stories, most of them retreads, acted out by a large cast of celebrities. Only a handful of characters are given the opportunity to become at all ""real,"" and many are just shallow and annoying anyway, so the viewer has little reason to care how the various trivial complications work out (though it's obvious that they will). Anyone looking for genuine human depth in the characters will not find it, though Halle Berry and Hilary Swank do breathe life into their parts. This film it its own kind of pornography. Heaven knows there's nothing remotely sexy about it; it's just that everyone is clearly faking it all the way through in a laughingly obvious way. The soundtrack is equally heavy-handed and obvious. Even viewers who simply want to eyeball the attractive cast members will be disappointed. Everybody's bundled up and hatted or pregnant or in some other way made unglamourous (except K. Heigl in an amazingly slinky dress, but she's such an unbearable, self-absorbed character that there's no appeal). The setting -- New York -- is also presented in a flat, dull, mostly ugly manner. I thought I would enjoy this film -- just looking for a light, charming couple of hours -- but it's such a cynical construction, so utterly heavy-handed and fake, that it made me really depressed. Yeah, the narrator gives us a dumb little lecture at the end about hope or something, but at that point I was sullen and pissed off at Garry Marshall's horrible direction. He, and everyone involved in this piece of crap, should be ashamed of themselves. I hope it lost a load of money, and I advise DVD buyers... not to.

The appeal to act in this film by so many great actors like Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Hallee Berry, Michelle Pfeiffer and the like must be the campy fun they must have had on the set (the closing credits with outtakes and bloopers is funnier than the actual movie).

This movie is a great romantic love story and just as good as Valentine's Day. It's the perfect movie to end the old year and begin the new. This movie has Halle Berry who plays a nurse named Aimee trying to help a cancer patient on his last day of life. Jessica Biel plays a pregnant woman named Tess trying to have the 1st baby at midnight. Jon Bon Jovi plays a singer named Jensen that tries to win back the love of his life. Abigail Breslin plays Hailey who wants to spend the evening with her boyfriend in Times Square Robert DeNiro's character, Stan is the saddest and wants to see the ball drop one last time. Josh Duhamel plays Sam, a man hoping to meet up with a woman he met on New Year's Eve the year before. Ashton Kutcher plays Randy, a heart-broken man that gets stuck on the elevator with a woman named Elise and begin to fall in love. Hillary Swank plays Claire, Vice-President of the Times Square Alliance that tries to get the ball to drop before midnight. Finally, we have Michelle Pfeiffer who plays Ingrid. Ingrid was my favorite character in the whole movie. She asks Zac Efron's character, Paul to help her complete her New Years resolutions by midnight.

Though the differences between ""New Year's Eve"" and the cloying ""Valentine's Day"" aren't great they are substantial enough.  While VD dealt solely with romantic love as connectedness NYE opens up the range of things that connect us, from people to brotherhood/ sisterhood to friendships to locales to even work and competitive egos.  And,yes, romantic love is in there too.  Anyone who has seen VD has already essentially seen NYE but NYE is still worth watching for its very warm and even pained humanity and essentially kind heart.  There aren't a lot of movies out there that pull this off.  There are several relational storylines that stand out but, for me, the one that stands out the most sees Paul (Zac Efron), a young and energetic courier about town who has bigger dreams, encounter Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), a homely old maid who has decided that life has passed her by and she wants to do a bunch of things (like a bucket list) all in one day.  She has tickets to a hot concert that she couldn't care less about but would fly Paul to the moon and so she challenges Paul to make her dreams come true (and, no, none of them are sexual at all) all in a day.  Now these dreams are impossible as some of them require intercontinental travle.  Aha, but Paul is a smart one and he finds unexpected ways to make Ingrid's dreams come true.  And she truly lives on that day and Paul's initially selfish goal of doing this for Ingrid (he sees her as a means to an end) morphs into seeing her for her sake.

Unfortunately, ""New Year's Eve,"" ends up plodding through its 118 minutes without giving any of them a chance to do what they can do.Set in New Year's Eve, New York, the film follows the life of such characters as Claire (Hilary Swank), Vice-President of the Times Square Alliance; a terminally-ill patient Stan (Robert De Niro) who wants to see the ball drop; a hard-working record company secretary Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), who just quit the job; a successful chef Laura (Katherine Heigl) and her ex-boyfriend Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi); and New Year's Eve hating comic book writer Randy (Ashton Kutcher) who is trapped in an elevator with Elise (Lea Michelle), and so on.I can keep on writing the names: Halle Berry, Jessica Biel, Abigail Breslin, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Josh Duhamel, Zac Efron, Cary Elwes, Hector Elizondo, Seth Meyers, Alyssa Milano, Sarah Jessica Parker, Til Schweiger and Sof&iacute;a Vergara, as well as cameos from Matthew Broderick, Common, Carla Gugino, John Lithgow, Larry Miller ... should I continue?Too many characters clutter up the screen and none of them is fleshed out enough.
