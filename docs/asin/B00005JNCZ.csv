628990,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B00005JNCZ,A. Hickman,"[16, 20]","This beautiful movie deserves a wider audience than it's likely to get.  The casting is top-drawer, the scenery breath-taking, and the story inspirational.  What more can you ask of a movie?  Apparently, a good number of reviewers would ask a lot more.  They would ask that Che had never been Che, the Communist, and that millions of human beings in the 20th century had never flirted with alternative forms of government; otherwise, they won't have anything to do with this movie.  How sad.  They are guilty of the ad hominem fallacy, the one that, as they should have learned in logic class, plays to prejudices, emotions, and special interests, rather than to reason.  So Che had a dream of a United Latin America-what of that? You can see how little came of it.  Che himself was killed in Bolivia in a Quixotic attempt to stir up the same kind of rebellion he had sired, with Castro, in Cuba.  But I'm not going to hold any of that against the young Ernesto who is depicted in Walter Salles' film, nor against his companion Alberto.  For one thing, they remind me too much of myself.  I once had ideals, many wrong-headed.  I sometimes wonder what might have come of me had I acted upon them.  As for the film, it is an experience that is a must for anyone with any curiosity about the world, although I understand that curiosity is discouraged in schoolrooms today, where the point of an education seems to be to establish our superiority over our neighbors.  Here is a travelogue that should amaze those among us who have never peeked below the 30th parallel and asked what the other half of ""America"" looks like.  The prospect of Machu Picchu alone is enough to evoke the wanderlust.  And what subversive message does Ernesto, the young medical student, learn on the way to maturity?  It's summarized in Ernesto's speech in the dance scene at the leprosarium: ""We [Latins] constitute a single Mestizo race, which from Mexico to the Magellen Straits bears notable ethnographical similarities,"" and so he proposes a toast ""to Peru and to a United Latin America.""  It never happened.  It was a dream.  Che's critics got the last laugh.  But the film captures the dream beautifully, and for a moment we may even believe it's possible.  We still go to the movies to dream, don't we?",5,The dream is over?,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,2284,"['beautiful', 'movie', 'wider', 'audience', 'likely', 'get', 'casting', 'top-drawer', 'scenery', 'breath-taking', 'story', 'inspirational', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'movie', 'Apparently', 'good', 'number', 'reviewers', 'would', 'ask', 'lot', 'more', 'would', 'ask', 'Che', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'Che', 'Communist', 'millions', 'human', 'beings', '20th', 'century', 'had', 'never', 'flirted', 'alternative', 'forms', 'government', 'otherwise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'movie', 'How', 'sad', 'are', 'guilty', 'ad', 'hominem', 'fallacy', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'learned', 'logic', 'class', 'prejudices', 'emotions', 'special', 'interests', 'rather', 'reason', 'So', 'Che', 'had', 'dream', 'United', 'Latin', 'America-what', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'came', 'Che', 'was', 'killed', 'Bolivia', 'Quixotic', 'attempt', 'stir', 'up', 'same', 'kind', 'rebellion', 'had', 'sired', 'Castro', 'Cuba', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'hold', 'young', 'Ernesto', 'who', 'depicted', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'film', 'companion', 'Alberto', 'one', 'thing', 'remind', 'too', 'much', 'once', 'had', 'ideals', 'many', 'wrong-headed', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'had', 'acted', 'film', 'experience', 'must', 'anyone', 'curiosity', 'world', 'understand', 'curiosity', 'discouraged', 'schoolrooms', 'today', 'where', 'point', 'education', 'be', 'establish', 'superiority', 'neighbors', 'Here', 'travelogue', 'should', 'amaze', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'peeked', '30th', 'parallel', 'asked', 'what', 'other', 'half', 'America', 'prospect', 'Machu', 'Picchu', 'alone', 'enough', 'evoke', 'wanderlust', 'what', 'subversive', 'message', 'Ernesto', 'young', 'medical', 'student', 'learn', 'way', 'maturity', 'summarized', 'Ernesto', 'speech', 'dance', 'scene', 'leprosarium', '[', 'Latins', ']', 'constitute', 'single', 'Mestizo', 'race', 'Mexico', 'Magellen', 'Straits', 'notable', 'ethnographical', 'similarities', 'so', 'toast', 'Peru', 'United', 'Latin', 'America', 'never', 'happened', 'was', 'dream', 'Che', 'critics', 'got', 'last', 'laugh', 'film', 'dream', 'beautifully', 'moment', 'may', 'even', 'believe', 'possible', 'still', 'go', 'movies', 'dream', 'do', ""n't""]",N/A

628992,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JNCZ,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 3]","I have reviewed a biography of the life and works of the Latin American communist revolutionary (I think that is how he wanted to see himself rather than simply as an Argentine) Ernesto ""Che' Guevara elsewhere in this space and make no bones about my admiration for his revolutionary skill and ardor while also noting my political differences. In a world that in the year 2007 is filled to the brim with fake `heroes' that today's youth are pushed to emulate Che was the real thing. A man of revolutionary conviction. The film under review, however, is a little difference take on Che's life from a time before he became a world-known revolutionary  fighter and icon. Apparently this film is based on his diaries written while he and another footloose  companion were traveling the highways and byways of Latin America on motorcycle, foot, boat, cart or by any other mode of transportation that would move them forward. During that fateful trip middle class professional (doctor) Che has his eyes opened to the geographic beauty of his continent but also to the grim underside of life for the masses. We, unfortunately, are painfully aware of how those travels ultimately end in the hills of Bolivia pursued by literally all of the security forces in the Western world.Does this early life study of Che work? As a member of the Generation of '68 I am very, very familiar with the wanderlust that drove many of my generation, myself included, to seek salvation and companionship of kindred spirits on the roads of America and elsewhere. We rode those old  Volkwagen buses to the ground in that pursuit and when they failed we hitchhiked (nobody does that anymore and, unfortunately, nobody should with all the weirdness out there on the mean roads of America these days).  Che got the urge to find 'himself' before Kerouac's Beat Generation classic On the Road and we got it as a result of that work so this struggle against personal alienation has been going on for a while now. However, that physical liberation from parental authority and the norms of bourgesois existence do not in themselves necesaarily produce anything except an existential traveler. If one did not know before hand that this film was about Che then, while it was interesting, cinematically  beautiful and the interplay between the two travelers was well-acted it could have been about a fair percentage of the children of post-World War II generation.The missing link is the politics. In a word the search for revolutionary politics. And that is the real problem with the unfolding of the story here. Based on this presentation it is hard to pinpoint what in Che's experiences acted as a catalyst for  `enlightening' him beyond some liberal sentimentality about the miseries of existence seen on his travels that would lead to a revolutionary understanding of the need to overthrow the old regimes. Yes, I know that to recruit people to revolution these days we will be dealing with bright, articulate, thoughtful, concerned liberals like Che in this film's period but I believe that the makers of this film took a dive on the politics. If they had wanted to honor the memory of Che then they did a disservice to that memory by reducing him to a inoffensive character serviceable to the liberal milieu. If they merely , as I assume, wanted to ride  the wave of popularity for a real icon for international youth then I have even greater political differences with their use of Che's legacy.",3,ON THE ROAD WITH 'CHE',1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,3464,"['have', 'reviewed', 'biography', 'life', 'works', 'Latin', 'American', 'communist', 'revolutionary', 'think', 'how', 'wanted', 'see', 'rather', 'simply', 'Argentine', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'elsewhere', 'space', 'make', 'bones', 'admiration', 'revolutionary', 'skill', 'ardor', 'also', 'noting', 'political', 'differences', 'world', 'year', '2007', 'filled', 'brim', 'fake', 'heroes', 'today', 'youth', 'are', 'pushed', 'emulate', 'Che', 'was', 'real', 'thing', 'man', 'revolutionary', 'conviction', 'film', 'review', 'however', 'little', 'difference', 'take', 'Che', 'life', 'time', 'became', 'world-known', 'revolutionary', 'fighter', 'icon', 'Apparently', 'film', 'based', 'diaries', 'written', 'footloose', 'companion', 'were', 'traveling', 'highways', 'byways', 'Latin', 'America', 'motorcycle', 'foot', 'boat', 'cart', 'other', 'mode', 'transportation', 'would', 'move', 'forward', 'fateful', 'trip', 'middle', 'class', 'professional', 'doctor', 'Che', 'eyes', 'opened', 'geographic', 'beauty', 'continent', 'also', 'grim', 'underside', 'life', 'masses', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'painfully', 'aware', 'how', 'travels', 'ultimately', 'end', 'hills', 'Bolivia', 'pursued', 'literally', 'security', 'forces', 'Western', 'world.Does', 'early', 'life', 'study', 'Che', 'work', 'member', 'Generation', ""'68"", 'am', 'very', 'very', 'familiar', 'wanderlust', 'drove', 'many', 'generation', 'included', 'seek', 'salvation', 'companionship', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'roads', 'America', 'elsewhere', 'rode', 'old', 'Volkwagen', 'ground', 'pursuit', 'when', 'failed', 'hitchhiked', 'nobody', 'anymore', 'unfortunately', 'nobody', 'should', 'weirdness', 'there', 'mean', 'roads', 'America', 'days', 'Che', 'got', 'urge', 'find', 'Kerouac', 'Beat', 'Generation', 'Road', 'got', 'result', 'work', 'so', 'struggle', 'personal', 'alienation', 'been', 'going', 'while', 'now', 'However', 'physical', 'liberation', 'parental', 'authority', 'norms', 'bourgesois', 'existence', 'do', 'not', 'necesaarily', 'produce', 'anything', 'existential', 'traveler', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'hand', 'film', 'was', 'Che', 'then', 'was', 'interesting', 'cinematically', 'beautiful', 'interplay', 'two', 'travelers', 'was', 'well-acted', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fair', 'percentage', 'children', 'post-World', 'War', 'II', 'generation.The', 'missing', 'link', 'politics', 'word', 'search', 'revolutionary', 'politics', 'real', 'problem', 'unfolding', 'story', 'here', 'Based', 'presentation', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'Che', 'experiences', 'acted', 'catalyst', 'enlightening', 'liberal', 'sentimentality', 'miseries', 'existence', 'seen', 'travels', 'would', 'lead', 'revolutionary', 'understanding', 'need', 'overthrow', 'old', 'regimes', 'Yes', 'know', 'recruit', 'people', 'revolution', 'days', 'will', 'be', 'dealing', 'bright', 'articulate', 'thoughtful', 'concerned', 'liberals', 'Che', 'film', 'period', 'believe', 'makers', 'film', 'took', 'dive', 'politics', 'had', 'wanted', 'honor', 'memory', 'Che', 'then', 'did', 'disservice', 'memory', 'reducing', 'inoffensive', 'character', 'serviceable', 'liberal', 'milieu', 'merely', 'assume', 'wanted', 'ride', 'wave', 'popularity', 'real', 'icon', 'international', 'youth', 'then', 'have', 'even', 'greater', 'political', 'differences', 'use', 'Che', 'legacy']",N/A
628993,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JNCZ,Alistair McHarg,"[6, 8]","Not hard to figure out why this film has been embraced by the knee-jerk, politically correct, art-house set.  Like JFK and Duane Allman, Che Guevara died at the ideal time to put a halo around his reputation.  Revolution was in the air, it was 1967, and young Americans were casting about for new role models because their old ones were - in a word - hideous.  Magically the face of Che became ubiquitous, he was - in an intellectually lazy way - symbolic of brave revolution in the face of tyranny.  That the truth of his legacy is almost the antithesis of those ideals was not important then, he was a T-shirt!The filmmakers cleverly tapped this ludicrous and sentimental vein, much the way the makers of Ray did, but the extra juice of self-righteous liberal elitism makes the mixture that much more intoxicating.  Add to that the outrageous good looks of the lead, Gael Garcia Bernal, and you have a budding thug and executioner you'd gladly introduce to mom and dad.  The film's most interesting and charismatic character dies halfway through the film - I'm referring of course to the 1939 Norton motorcycle after which the movie is named.The star of the film, and its much-needed redeeming factor, is the countryside of South America.  Viewers will be happiest when the land is simply allowed to do the talking, and the protagonists watch along with them.  In those moments when we are invited to imagine what an 8,000-mile journey through such a land must have felt like, we connect.  We do not connect through the dialogue.  For a couple of revolutionaries-in-training, these guys rarely - if ever - say anything that informs character, much less indicates change.  One can certainly understand how witnessing injustice could shape a vague desire to improve the world through direct action, but such a transformation is difficult to express on film - and you won't see it here.A movie deconstructing the hippie-era mythology about Che and revealing him for the closed-minded brute he was would have been much more interesting - although not as pretty.",3,The Motorcycle Diatribes,1185235200,"07 24, 2007",2007,2059,"['Not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'film', 'been', 'embraced', 'knee-jerk', 'politically', 'correct', 'art-house', 'set', 'JFK', 'Duane', 'Allman', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'died', 'ideal', 'time', 'put', 'halo', 'reputation', 'Revolution', 'was', 'air', 'was', '1967', 'young', 'Americans', 'were', 'casting', 'about', 'new', 'role', 'models', 'old', 'ones', 'were', 'word', 'hideous', 'Magically', 'face', 'Che', 'became', 'ubiquitous', 'was', 'intellectually', 'lazy', 'way', 'symbolic', 'brave', 'revolution', 'face', 'tyranny', 'truth', 'legacy', 'almost', 'antithesis', 'ideals', 'was', 'not', 'important', 'then', 'was', 'T-shirt', 'filmmakers', 'cleverly', 'tapped', 'ludicrous', 'sentimental', 'vein', 'much', 'way', 'makers', 'Ray', 'did', 'extra', 'juice', 'self-righteous', 'liberal', 'elitism', 'mixture', 'much', 'more', 'intoxicating', 'Add', 'outrageous', 'good', 'looks', 'lead', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'have', 'budding', 'thug', 'executioner', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'introduce', 'mom', 'dad', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'charismatic', 'character', 'halfway', 'film', ""'m"", 'referring', 'course', '1939', 'Norton', 'motorcycle', 'movie', 'named.The', 'star', 'film', 'much-needed', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'countryside', 'South', 'America', 'Viewers', 'will', 'be', 'happiest', 'when', 'land', 'simply', 'allowed', 'do', 'talking', 'protagonists', 'watch', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'invited', 'imagine', 'what', '8,000-mile', 'journey', 'land', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'connect', 'do', 'not', 'connect', 'dialogue', 'couple', 'revolutionaries-in-training', 'guys', 'rarely', 'ever', 'say', 'anything', 'character', 'much', 'less', 'indicates', 'change', 'One', 'can', 'certainly', 'understand', 'how', 'witnessing', 'injustice', 'could', 'shape', 'vague', 'desire', 'improve', 'world', 'direct', 'action', 'transformation', 'difficult', 'express', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'here.A', 'movie', 'deconstructing', 'hippie-era', 'mythology', 'Che', 'revealing', 'closed-minded', 'brute', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'not', 'pretty']",N/A

Acting is good, photography is splendid. The gradual transformation of Che is well constructed. The characters' stay in the clinic for lepers is convincing (with the exception of the sequence with Che swimming to the other side) and touching.The ""politics"" is dealt with badly. The anti-capitalist dialogues are silly and very superficial, and I do not write this because I think they are baseless (I am sure they are not). The last sentence we read on the screen is the culmination of this distorted view of Che. I realize that this is the story of Che before he became Che, and so it could be judged without reference to what came in this story's future, but then the director should have taken care of sparing us the hagiographical conclusion about ""poor"" Che being murdered with the cooperation of the CIA. This is what really debased the whole movie to me.I do have sympathy for someone who abandons a quiet and pampered life to fight for worthy ideals, but we should not forget that these ideas are what created Fidel Castro's Cuba (or North Korea, or Cambodia).

These were the days when ""Che"" was simply ""Ernesto"", a medical student from Buenos Aires on an extended road trip.There are two themes that dominate this film.  Firstly, the magnificent grandeur of the South American landscape through which they travel.  From the extremes of the Atacama Desert to the snows of the Andes Mountains to the jungles of the Amazon, ""Diaries"" is truly spectacular.  The second theme is the political awakening of Guevara.  He slowly transforms from mere medical student to a young man with a desire to change the world.The history of events subsequent to ""Diaries"" is well known.  Guevara eventually travels to Mexico and joins up with Fidel Castro to overthrow the Batista government in Cuba culminating with success in January 1959.  He then becomes a Cuban government minister before travelling to the Congo and then, later, Bolivia, to ferment further revolution.  His death is ignominious as he is killed in the mountains of Bolivia before being unceremoniously discarded.

For the most part a buddy film outlining an extended voyage within South America, there is absolutely nothing, save for one one, totally misplaced scene, which gives even a scintilla of an idea that here was an idealistic young professional on a journey of discovery that would lead him to revolutionary politics. The misplaced scene, towards the end of the film, is a birthday party at which ""Che"" makes what amounts to a plea for pan-American unity. It is in no way prepared, nor is it followed up. The end title cards giving a very brief summary of Che's life and death are hardly intuited by any action or dialogue during the course of the film. There is not a single episode suggesting how the young medical student becomes transformed into a Marxist radical - although from a purely utopian perspective, it is easy enough to intuit the missing pieces.What results, then, is a highly idealized portrait in which the central action of the film, the journey, produces nothing more earthshattering than a few attacks of asthma, and serious stares out into infinity. All Che's scribbling in his diaries remains, except for a few out of context quotations, mysterious.Personally, I would have preferred a much more substantial look at how the man went through his metamorphosis - even while keeping the travelogue and photographical/sociological portraits of the various indigenous peoples visited along the way. The real voyage was an interior one, psychologically, spiritually, politically - and going from cosmopolitan Buenos Aires to snow covered mountains in Chile to the long journey up the Amazon River is just far too vague a way to treat such a man, regardless of how you judge his politics or his actions in life.",4,A disturbing film for all the wrong reasons,1109030400,"02 22, 2005",2005,1975,"['Considering', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevarra', 'historical', 'importance', 'Socialist', 'Revolutionary', 'era', 'Latin', 'America', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'beautiful', 'captivating', 'visually', 'highly', 'misleading', 'portrait', 'Revolutionary-in-the-making', 'most', 'part', 'buddy', 'film', 'outlining', 'extended', 'voyage', 'South', 'America', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'save', 'one', 'one', 'totally', 'misplaced', 'scene', 'even', 'scintilla', 'idea', 'here', 'was', 'idealistic', 'young', 'professional', 'journey', 'discovery', 'would', 'lead', 'revolutionary', 'politics', 'misplaced', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'birthday', 'party', 'Che', 'what', 'amounts', 'plea', 'pan-American', 'unity', 'way', 'prepared', 'followed', 'up', 'end', 'title', 'cards', 'giving', 'very', 'brief', 'summary', 'Che', 'life', 'death', 'are', 'hardly', 'intuited', 'action', 'dialogue', 'course', 'film', 'not', 'single', 'episode', 'suggesting', 'how', 'young', 'medical', 'student', 'transformed', 'Marxist', 'radical', 'purely', 'utopian', 'perspective', 'easy', 'enough', 'intuit', 'missing', 'pieces.What', 'results', 'then', 'highly', 'idealized', 'portrait', 'central', 'action', 'film', 'journey', 'nothing', 'more', 'earthshattering', 'few', 'attacks', 'asthma', 'serious', 'stares', 'out', 'infinity', 'Che', 'scribbling', 'diaries', 'few', 'context', 'quotations', 'mysterious.Personally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'much', 'more', 'substantial', 'look', 'how', 'man', 'went', 'metamorphosis', 'even', 'keeping', 'travelogue', 'photographical/sociological', 'portraits', 'various', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'visited', 'way', 'real', 'voyage', 'was', 'interior', 'one', 'psychologically', 'spiritually', 'politically', 'going', 'cosmopolitan', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'snow', 'covered', 'mountains', 'Chile', 'long', 'journey', 'Amazon', 'River', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'vague', 'way', 'treat', 'such', 'man', 'regardless', 'how', 'judge', 'politics', 'actions', 'life']",N/A

629004,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JNCZ,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[54, 66]","This is a tough review to write because of the subject matter we're dealing with: a militant revolutionary who became Castro's right-hand man during the 1959 Cuban revolt. But here in THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES film, we don't see this man; we see instead the formation of the person whom this man (Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara played by the talented Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal)would become. He's a young idealist living in South America when he and a friend (Alberto Granado played by up-and-coming actor Rodrigo de la Serna) decide to take a road trip across the continent before bellying down into their chosen carriers in medicine.The film succeeds in giving us a very myopic view of these two men: Guevara for the initial changes he begins to go through as he witnesses injustices to the low and poor; Granado for his love of women and grudging dedication to Guevara. We travel with them on a 1939 Norton 500 motorcycle (my hat's off to the two actors who had to ACTUALLY learn to ride one of these behemoths!) as they argue with each other over money, their deficient form of transportation, and Guevara's unflinching honesty when asked delicate questions (this is brought into focus when they first meet a man - who looks very German - in a small village and asks Che and Granado to look at a lump on his neck, which Granado diagnoses as a cyst but Che calls a tumor).The cinematography was done exceptionally well on a small budget. The beauty of Machu Picchu, the green forests of Peru, the nothingness of various deserts, all added great visuals for the viewer.The film's faults lay with its omissions. Yes, Che was a thinking man. Yes, Che was concerned with humanity as a whole. But Che was also somewhat of a bigot. He didn't like blacks, jews, and homosexuals (read the book THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES). So when he shows his concern for lepers in a colony along the Amazon River, we're only see a part of this complex man. Granted, for a film you need to have your audience empathize with the main character, but this also pulls us into the shallow end of the depths that this man was. The convoluted sections of Che's life might have added an extra level of understanding for film viewers, especially those who have knowledge of his later life when he becomes an executioner of spies and deserters, quite a dichotomy compared to the hippocratic oath he took when becoming a doctor - the oath basically promising to ""do no harm.""But, again, I can understand why the film makers decided to omit these sections. We are, after all, seeing only the early life of Che, a fomenting of ideas that would change his life forever. But I think we have to be careful when looking at such a potentially volatile subject and controversial man, and only showing the ""sunnier"" side of Che to a new generation of movie-goers. More research is needed if one really wishes to understand the levels of Che.",3,A Myopic Look at an Iconic Figure,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2883,"['tough', 'review', 'write', 'subject', 'matter', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'militant', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'became', 'Castro', 'right-hand', 'man', '1959', 'Cuban', 'revolt', 'here', 'THE', 'MOTORCYCLE', 'DIARIES', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'man', 'see', 'instead', 'formation', 'person', 'whom', 'man', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'played', 'talented', 'Gael', 'Garc', 'iacute', 'Bernal', 'would', 'become', 'young', 'idealist', 'living', 'South', 'America', 'when', 'friend', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'played', 'up-and-coming', 'actor', 'Rodrigo', 'la', 'Serna', 'decide', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'continent', 'bellying', 'down', 'chosen', 'carriers', 'medicine.The', 'film', 'giving', 'very', 'myopic', 'view', 'two', 'men', 'Guevara', 'initial', 'changes', 'go', 'as', 'injustices', 'low', 'poor', 'Granado', 'love', 'women', 'grudging', 'dedication', 'Guevara', 'travel', '1939', 'Norton', '500', 'motorcycle', 'hat', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'ACTUALLY', 'learn', 'ride', 'one', 'behemoths', 'argue', 'other', 'money', 'deficient', 'form', 'transportation', 'Guevara', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'when', 'asked', 'delicate', 'questions', 'brought', 'focus', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'German', 'small', 'village', 'Che', 'Granado', 'look', 'lump', 'neck', 'Granado', 'cyst', 'Che', 'tumor', '.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'done', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'small', 'budget', 'beauty', 'Machu', 'Picchu', 'green', 'forests', 'Peru', 'nothingness', 'various', 'deserts', 'added', 'great', 'visuals', 'viewer.The', 'film', 'faults', 'lay', 'omissions', 'Yes', 'Che', 'was', 'thinking', 'man', 'Yes', 'Che', 'was', 'concerned', 'humanity', 'whole', 'Che', 'was', 'also', 'somewhat', 'bigot', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'blacks', 'jews', 'homosexuals', 'read', 'book', 'THE', 'MOTORCYCLE', 'DIARIES', 'So', 'when', 'concern', 'lepers', 'colony', 'Amazon', 'River', ""'re"", 'only', 'see', 'part', 'complex', 'man', 'Granted', 'film', 'need', 'have', 'audience', 'empathize', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'shallow', 'end', 'depths', 'man', 'was', 'convoluted', 'sections', 'Che', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'extra', 'level', 'understanding', 'film', 'viewers', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'knowledge', 'later', 'life', 'when', 'executioner', 'spies', 'deserters', 'quite', 'dichotomy', 'compared', 'hippocratic', 'oath', 'took', 'when', 'becoming', 'doctor', 'oath', 'basically', 'promising', 'do', 'harm', 'again', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'makers', 'decided', 'omit', 'sections', 'are', 'seeing', 'only', 'early', 'life', 'Che', 'fomenting', 'ideas', 'would', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'think', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'when', 'looking', 'potentially', 'volatile', 'subject', 'controversial', 'man', 'only', 'showing', 'sunnier', 'side', 'Che', 'new', 'generation', 'movie-goers', 'More', 'research', 'needed', 'one', 'really', 'understand', 'levels', 'Che']",N/A

Whether I'm taking a long vacation trip of one week or more or just a weekend getaway to a nearby resort, I'm always ready for some travel excitement. In this movie, the two lead characters are also very fond of travel. They hop aboard a motorcycle and proceed to traverse throughout South America, making for an entertaining film that combines travel adventure and politics to create a mesmerizing film with a strong message.This movie is based on a real- life event that occurred in the 1950's when Ernesto Guevara set off across the South American continent with his friend on the back of a motorcycle. Some might recognize the Guevara name from history- he was one of the people responsible for leading the Cuban revolution that brought Castro to power. He was on his way to perform medical work as part of his college internship and decided to make a long adventure out of it rather than flying directly to his destination.Among this film's strong points, which include the directing, the acting, and the hot Latin babes, the quality that stands out more than anything is the cinematography. The two young men depart form their native Argentina, head west to Chile, then north to Peru and ultimately to Venezuela. Along the way, the viewer is treated to great natural scenery like the Andes Mountains, the Atacama Desert, and the Amazon River. There is also some great man- made scenery as well, like that of an ancient Inca ruin in Peru. And there are some politically tragic scenes, like those that depict the unethical treatment received by peasants and others during this time in history.The direction of this movie is superb, and it is intended to get the viewer to think about social and economic justice. Supposedly, Guevara's traveling experience and the acts of injustice he encountered formed the basis for his decision to help lead the Cuban revolution. It's a little strange that he would forge a relationship with Castro's Cuba, since little or nothing in that island nation bears any resemblance to justice. But this is what happened, and this movie is based loosely on Guevara's eye- opening travel adventure.Some people will be turned off by a movie like this because of its obvious political leanings and its subtle endorsement of socialism as a political ideal. I certainly don't agree with any type of government philosophy based on authoritarianism. But I urge viewers not to let this dissuade them from watching this film. It offers great scenery, flawless direction, and great performances by the large cast of characters. Toss your political beliefs aside and give this film a chance.

Medical student Guevara was unusual in that he became a leader instead of remaining a medic.Basically, The Motorcycle Diaries does not present a whole picture of Che Guevara's growth.  It is mainly a nice exhibition of countryside cinematography.  Its something of a buddies on the road picture.

629014,A95SF04RX9G8,B00005JNCZ,"Christopher Moyer ""moyer.privatjokr.com""","[6, 9]","The Motorcycle Diaries tells the story of a life-changing journey that future Cuban revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado made on a motorcycle through South America in 1952. At the time, Guevara was 23 years old, and Granado was 29. They set out to see the continent that they called home, but had really only experienced through books, but they ended up irrevocably changed by the South America that they found.Guevara is played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who Mexican film fans will know from Y Tu Mama Tambien and Amores Perros, and Granado is played by Rodrigo de la Serna in his film debut. The two young men, Guevara a medical student and Granado a biochemist, set out on this journey for the sake of traveling and maybe meeting some girls along the way. The plan is to ride ""The Mighty One,"" Granado's less-than-pristine motorcycle from their native Argentina, up the coast of Chile, through Peru, and ending up in Venezuela for Granado's 30th birthday.Carrying almost no cash with them, they pose as prominent Argentinian doctors in order to get food and shelter along the way. Eventually, ""The Mighty One"" breaks down, and their pace slows as they make the decision to continue on foot. Here they end up inadvertantly meeting the South America that isn't described in books, poverty-stricken folks who are essentially homeless in their own land, desperate for work so they can provide for their families. Guevara and Granado end up at a leper colony in San Pablo, Peru, where Guevara notes that the Amazon River divides the ill and the healthy, and he realizes that this is not the only division he has noticed. There is a ton of injustice in the world, and Guevara is learning that maybe he needs to do something about it.The Motorcycle Diaries isn't so much about Che Guevara as it is about the plight of the poor people in the world. What we see in South America, through Guevara's eyes, are people without any opportunity to make any advances because of political divisions. These people can work all their lives and make no progress. It really makes you think about all of things in life that we take for granted, and think that maybe there's something that each one of us can do to make things better. Or at least we can try.I'm no expert on the life of Che Guevara, but he later became an associate of Castro and helped lead the revolution in Cuba that installed a Communist government. Some may say that he took his ideals too far, but this film is not concerned with that part of Guevara's life. The part of his life that is depicted in The Motorcycle Diaries certainly paints him as brash and idealistic and serves to show that it is important to stand up for what you believe in, and not simply let your world dictate who you are. Unfortunately for the people of Cuba, Guevara was later more interested in dictating what was right for them than letting them do so for themselves.",5,Really intriguing in its depiction of South America,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,2923,"['Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'story', 'life-changing', 'journey', 'future', 'Cuban', 'revolutionary', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'friend', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'made', 'motorcycle', 'South', 'America', '1952', 'time', 'Guevara', 'was', '23', 'years', 'old', 'Granado', 'was', '29', 'set', 'out', 'see', 'continent', 'called', 'home', 'had', 'really', 'only', 'experienced', 'books', 'ended', 'up', 'irrevocably', 'changed', 'South', 'America', 'found.Guevara', 'played', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'who', 'Mexican', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'Amores', 'Perros', 'Granado', 'played', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'film', 'debut', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'Guevara', 'medical', 'student', 'Granado', 'biochemist', 'set', 'out', 'journey', 'sake', 'traveling', 'maybe', 'meeting', 'girls', 'way', 'plan', 'ride', 'Mighty', 'One', 'Granado', 'less-than-pristine', 'motorcycle', 'native', 'Argentina', 'up', 'coast', 'Chile', 'Peru', 'ending', 'up', 'Venezuela', 'Granado', '30th', 'birthday.Carrying', 'almost', 'cash', 'pose', 'prominent', 'Argentinian', 'doctors', 'order', 'get', 'food', 'shelter', 'way', 'Eventually', 'Mighty', 'One', 'down', 'pace', 'make', 'decision', 'continue', 'foot', 'Here', 'end', 'up', 'inadvertantly', 'meeting', 'South', 'America', ""n't"", 'described', 'books', 'poverty-stricken', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'essentially', 'homeless', 'own', 'land', 'desperate', 'work', 'so', 'can', 'provide', 'families', 'Guevara', 'Granado', 'end', 'up', 'leper', 'colony', 'San', 'Pablo', 'Peru', 'where', 'Guevara', 'Amazon', 'River', 'ill', 'healthy', 'not', 'only', 'division', 'noticed', 'ton', 'injustice', 'world', 'Guevara', 'learning', 'maybe', 'do', 'something', 'it.The', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'plight', 'poor', 'people', 'world', 'What', 'see', 'South', 'America', 'Guevara', 'eyes', 'are', 'people', 'opportunity', 'make', 'advances', 'political', 'divisions', 'people', 'can', 'work', 'lives', 'make', 'progress', 'really', 'think', 'things', 'life', 'take', 'granted', 'think', 'maybe', 'something', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'make', 'things', 'better', 'least', 'can', 'try.I', ""'m"", 'expert', 'life', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'later', 'became', 'associate', 'Castro', 'helped', 'lead', 'revolution', 'Cuba', 'installed', 'Communist', 'government', 'may', 'say', 'took', 'ideals', 'too', 'far', 'film', 'not', 'concerned', 'part', 'Guevara', 'life', 'part', 'life', 'depicted', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'certainly', 'brash', 'idealistic', 'show', 'important', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'believe', 'not', 'simply', 'let', 'world', 'dictate', 'who', 'are', 'Unfortunately', 'people', 'Cuba', 'Guevara', 'was', 'later', 'more', 'interested', 'dictating', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'letting', 'do', 'so']",N/A

While his last name is mentioned a couple times and Che, not once did it occur to me that it meaning him. In reflecting on the film, it had a different resonance. Instead of being a road trip movie about things that change your life, it ended up becoming a look into a life who had enough with things and wanted change. Sure we can disagree with the methods but it's quite a look into a famous leader's backstory.2 friends living in Argentina, Alberto and Ernesto, decide to do what they had been planning for awhile: a big motorcycle trip around South America and ending in a leper colony for volunteer work. Several minor mishaps happen such as a storm or constant motorcycle problems but they gradually get introduced to the problems facing many people which starts to affect Ernesto in a big way.First off, the film is anchored with 2 great performances, especially by Gael Garcia Bernal as Ernesto who manages to say a lot just simply by his expression or his gestures. Second, the cinematography is great with picturesque shots of the countryside including an ancient Mayan civilization. The film never gets preachy, showing that after-school special ""we are the world"" stuff a lot of these films have. One minor complaint is that the film just feels long at times. And poor Mia Maestro, the only worthwhile character in Poseidon and they write her off and she doesn't last long on Alias. Here, she's in a few scenes at the beginning than she disappears for the entire film. Not to mention the end credits don't mention what became of her.Now for the Che Guevera aspect: watching him do very daring things in the film, particularly involving the leper colony he volunteered at makes you appreciate the social awareness he was starting to now see, as well as trying to promote. Some would describe the man as a hero, others see him as merely a revolutionary who wanted change by any means necessary which of course brings up the ends vs means question. Like many popular figures, he ended up becoming one of the more well-known and influential people even if certain things were questionable.It's certainly a watchable film although I probably wouldn't watch it twice. It's a great character study where your eyes get opened to everything beyond your comfort zone and I think we can all relate.",5,"A quiet and above all....""nice"" film",1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,2487,"['got', 'confession', 'make', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'said', 'friend', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'connect', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'controversial', 'communist', 'revolutionary', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'last', 'name', 'mentioned', 'couple', 'times', 'Che', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'occur', 'meaning', 'reflecting', 'film', 'had', 'different', 'resonance', 'Instead', 'being', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'things', 'change', 'life', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'look', 'life', 'who', 'had', 'enough', 'things', 'wanted', 'change', 'Sure', 'can', 'disagree', 'methods', 'quite', 'look', 'famous', 'leader', 'backstory.2', 'friends', 'living', 'Argentina', 'Alberto', 'Ernesto', 'decide', 'do', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'planning', 'awhile', 'big', 'motorcycle', 'trip', 'South', 'America', 'ending', 'leper', 'colony', 'volunteer', 'work', 'Several', 'minor', 'mishaps', 'happen', 'such', 'storm', 'constant', 'motorcycle', 'problems', 'gradually', 'get', 'introduced', 'problems', 'facing', 'many', 'people', 'affect', 'Ernesto', 'big', 'way.First', 'film', 'anchored', '2', 'great', 'performances', 'especially', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Ernesto', 'who', 'say', 'lot', 'just', 'simply', 'expression', 'gestures', 'Second', 'cinematography', 'great', 'picturesque', 'shots', 'countryside', 'including', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'film', 'never', 'preachy', 'showing', 'after-school', 'special', 'are', 'world', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'One', 'minor', 'complaint', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'long', 'times', 'poor', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'character', 'Poseidon', 'write', 'off', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Alias', 'Here', 'few', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'entire', 'film', 'Not', 'mention', 'end', 'credits', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'what', 'became', 'her.Now', 'Che', 'Guevera', 'aspect', 'watching', 'do', 'very', 'daring', 'things', 'film', 'particularly', 'involving', 'leper', 'colony', 'volunteered', 'appreciate', 'social', 'awareness', 'was', 'starting', 'now', 'see', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'promote', 'would', 'describe', 'man', 'hero', 'others', 'see', 'merely', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'wanted', 'change', 'means', 'necessary', 'course', 'up', 'ends', 'vs', 'question', 'many', 'popular', 'figures', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'one', 'more', 'well-known', 'influential', 'people', 'even', 'certain', 'things', 'were', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'film', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'twice', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'where', 'eyes', 'get', 'opened', 'everything', 'comfort', 'zone', 'think', 'can', 'relate']",N/A

The film, based upon the book of the same name, culled from the diaries of Ernesto `Che' Guevara (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), the mass murdering top henchman of Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution, attempts to portray the monster as an all-caring near-Christ-like figure. Now, I am not one who's a PC stickler when it comes to art and truth, but the fact is this film is a) bad history, and b) even worse art. While not quite as bad a film as Monster, for its better visuals than that feminist ode to girl power via serial murder, the earlier film at least acknowledged that its subject was a mass murderer, even as it excused it. By contrast, The Motorcycle Diaries not only glosses over Che's massive crimes against humanity, but gives absolutely no hint that such evil ever resided in the man. He was Latin America's Osama bin Laden before there was an Osama bin Laden. Yet, to the recrudescent Hollywood PC Elitists he is a hero, simply because he opposed America. That, alone, to them, erases all of the blood on his hands, even though he was enamored of the Soviet Union's genocidal methods. Yet, George W. Bush, a man I certainly do not admire, is utterly reviled for his crimes against humanity, even though his `cause' is arguably only just as ignoble and ineffective as Che's ultimately was.The film, which was lauded at the Sundance Film Festival, and widely touted by executive producer and political naf, Robert Redford, follows spoiled rich kid Che's months-long trek, at age 23, across South America with an older pal named Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna), 29. The film, while filled with beautiful vistas of the countryside, is not particularly well shot by director Walter Salles nor cinematographer Eric Gautier, as there is none of the lingering sumptuousness that one finds in Lawrence Of Arabia, nor Kundun, films made by filmic masters like David Lean and Martin Scorsese. Instead, we get filmic postcards, not engaging realities. The framing of the shots sometimes seems as if it were done by a tourist who was in a hurry to get through whatever area he was traveling through. It also plumbs virtually every clich&eacute; of the two genres it inhabits- the buddy film and the coming of age road film. On the buddy side you have handsome, serious, empathetic Che, who-like George Washington, cannot tell a lie- he rips a doctor's poorly worded novel after his pal praises I- telling the old man to stick to medicine (would that someone had told Che the same thing!), and the chubby, fast-talking sidekick, Alberto, on a continual poon hunt. They get in to wacky adventures, constantly crash their motorcycle, and escape disaster by the skins of their teeth. On the road picture side, Che falls in love with a beautiful girl, but breaks her heart, the two meet strange people and grow up, chase girls, and idyllic vistas inspire the duo to talk like a bad screenwriter's imagination of what depth is, especially when at Maachu Picchu. If this insipidity is what Screenwriter's 101 feels reconstructed conversations should be, well....yeesh. In short, this is one foreign film whose subtitles do not matter vis-&agrave;-vis dubbing because they are bad either way.... Despite being made by a Brazilian filmmaker, this film is thoroughly Hollywood, and bound to polarize. Simpleminded Leftists have and will praise it to the hilt, despite its manifest flaws, all because they will not bother to check out the facts. Rightists will damn the film, sight unseen, thereby missing the chance to rip its poor artistry and only justify the many delusions of their enemies, by showing them they are correct that Rightists cannot separate art from reality, either.

And to create a film to represent the lives of complex historical figures is a daunting task, yet Walter Salles has proven that he is more than capable of creating such a film. In The Motorcycle Diaries we are shown an approximation of the early life of Ernesto Guevara, the man who would eventually recognized worldwide as the revolutionary Che Guevara.The story begins in Argentina where friends Ernesto Guevara (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) and Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) decide to take a motorcycle trip across South America. Both are studying to become doctors but are restless and wish to see more of their land, learn more of its history, people and culture. Their trek will take them on an amazing journey of over 8000 kilometers and will end in Venezuela at the Guajira Peninsula. Their route will take them through Buenos Aires, Patagonia, Chile, the Andes and into the Peruvian Amazon. They get off to a rough start, barely avoiding serious accidents and experiencing numerous mechanical problems. The motorcycle, a Norton 500 from 1939, is dilapidated and causes many difficulties. But their early misadventures are soon overshadowed by their realization that much of South America is divided, culturally and economically. Ernesto and Alberto witness the turmoil of their land and it changes them profoundly. While Alberto acknowledges the troubles of the people and sympathizes with them, Ernesto takes them to heart and understands the need for action. The faces of the downtrodden, the diseased and the impoverished haunt him. A new conviction is born within him, a new cause for his existence and he is given something to fight for. He craves revolution and the unity of Latin America.The film gives a humanistic portrait of a man who has been idolized by young political radicals, respected by social reformers and admired by philosophers. But the man known as Che is more than just a symbol of revolution. He was above all a complicated man capable of sincerity, compassion and instituting great change. For those who are already familiar with his life, this film will deepen your understanding and appreciation of him. For those unfamiliar with Che, the film is a wonderful introduction to a fascinating man.The film is driven by powerful performances from its two leading men, who enrich their characters with impetuosity, angst, empathy and humor. The music ingeniously captures the flavor of South American culture while imbuing the film with the angst of youthful rebellion.

There the sick are separated from the caregivers by a river, even though lepers in treatment are not contagious.A lot of The Motorcycle Diaries feels contrived (especially the melodramatic climax) to paint a saintly portrait of the future revolutionary and guerilla (who would become known by the regional nickname ""Che""), giving him few flaws aside from a typically human libido. Although, only de la Serna is allowed to take that to its full lustiness, leaving Bernal to play ""romantic.""But it is effective storytelling nonetheless, mostly due to the genuine performances by Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna, a actual relative of Guevara, but Eric Gautier's cinematography also makes good use of the locations to offer a sense of time and place.Fans of the political side of Guevara will appreciate a few allusions to his future, but you don't have to be a supporter to enjoy the ""buddy movie"" aspects of The Motorcycle Diaries, and the ""coming of age"" of a couple of young men, on its own terms.",4,Don't have to be a Che-head,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,1651,"['Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'riveting', 'performance', 'young', 'Ernesto', 'Guevara', 'la', 'Serna', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'film', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'based', 'book', 'participants', 'Guevara', 'Notes', 'Latin', 'American', 'Journey', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'Traveling', 'Che.Guevara', 'Granado', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'are', 'two', 'Argentinian', 'medical', 'students', 'who', 'decide', 'trek', 'South', 'America', 'twenty-year-old', 'motorcycle', 'hoping', 'arrive', 'Venezuela', 'time', 'Granado', 'thirtieth', 'birthday.The', 'trip', 'many', 'ways', 'bringing', 'out', 'true', 'natures', 'especially', 'arrive', 'destination', 'leprosy', 'clinic', 'Guevara', 'specialty', 'sick', 'are', 'separated', 'caregivers', 'river', 'even', 'lepers', 'treatment', 'are', 'not', 'contagious.A', 'lot', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'contrived', 'especially', 'melodramatic', 'climax', 'paint', 'saintly', 'portrait', 'future', 'revolutionary', 'guerilla', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'known', 'regional', 'nickname', 'Che', 'giving', 'few', 'flaws', 'aside', 'typically', 'human', 'libido', 'only', 'la', 'Serna', 'allowed', 'take', 'full', 'lustiness', 'leaving', 'Bernal', 'play', 'romantic', 'effective', 'storytelling', 'nonetheless', 'mostly', 'due', 'genuine', 'performances', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'actual', 'relative', 'Guevara', 'Eric', 'Gautier', 'cinematography', 'also', 'good', 'use', 'locations', 'offer', 'sense', 'time', 'place.Fans', 'political', 'side', 'Guevara', 'will', 'appreciate', 'few', 'allusions', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'supporter', 'enjoy', 'buddy', 'movie', 'aspects', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'coming', 'age', 'couple', 'young', 'men', 'own', 'terms']",N/A

He documented these adventures in a diary and this film dramatizes some of his entries, along with Granado's memoirs, and examines some of the experiences that led to Che's political awakening.Walter Salles fills his movie with beautiful scenery: the green, rolling hills of Argentina and the snowy roads and fog-enshrouded mountains of Chile. At times his movie is a romanticized view of Che's early life but it also resists the urge to put him on a pedestal in favour of showing him as a young man with faults and desires just like anyone else. It does show, however, the seeds of what would result in the legendary figure he became. The Motorcycle Diaries is about two men becoming aware of the world around them and learning what it means to truly help and serve your fellow man.There are four deleted scenes totaling eight and half minutes.

Along the way they encounter exploited miners, indigenous Indians, and disenfranchised lepers, and the geographical pilgrimmage turns into a political awakening. As Ernesto remarks at the end of the film, ""I'm no longer me, at least the me I used to be."" You can enjoy this film as a coming-of-age travel narrative with spectacular scenery of Incan ruins and the Andes mountains. As a political documentary of its main subject, the revolutionary Che Guevara, it is at best romantic and incomplete. The founder with Fidel Castro of the 1956 Cuban Revolution, with later exploits in Congo and Bolivia, Guevara was murdered in Bolivia in 1967 at the age of 39. Still, there is something deeply powerful about the ""pedagogy of the poor"" learned from real life experiences of injustice and oppression such as are recounted here, and which are the lot of a disproportionate number of people in our world.

The film has a high level of production quality. Good, sympathetic acting is shown against a compelling cinemascape of a vast, untamed land. Che Guevara is shown as well motivated and inspired by his love for the people of the land and hatred of injustice. Good intentions apparently explain and excuse all, else how can you explain the deification of a violent executioner? The film excuses and does not explain Che's own injustices. There is a certain arrogance in the willingness to impose one's own political views by deadly force that is never revealed or addressed. At one level, I enjoyed the story being told by the movie, but I could never reconcile the movie I saw with the history I knew. Motorcycle Diaries fails in its ambition to explain (justify?) Che Guevara. But it succeeds in extending the pro-revolutionary brand represented by the ubiquitous Che t-shirts. Is this just celebrating rejection of the status quo?

Instead, they learn of many unfortunate events occurring, especially hunger, poverty, and corrupt government.  As medical students, they help several families with pride.  This true story shares what influenced Che Guevera to become an active militant radical in the Cuban Revolution in the 1960's.  Though it doesn't portray him in his famous activism, this film still shall touch viewer's hearts.  Many hated him, many loved him.  Regardless, this film wonderfully portrays him.The passion and the emotion lingers throughout ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" as they portray the families and the communities in pain.  As the two young men help them, the film shows how this epidemic effects everyone.  Therefore this is more than just a film of a road trip.  This is a film about friendship, heroism, and hope.  The emotional impact adds with Gael Garcia Bernal's beautiful performance as Che Guevera.  His talents prove that not many others can play him in such levels.  He alone gives this film the right theme for each individual scene.  Though all the other main actors also offer powerful performance, Bernal's remains the standout.  Such film quality leads to a wonderful unforgettable conclusion.""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is a touching film that will surely please its audiences for a long time.

It is also fair to describe the famous screen artist as a stereotypical useful idiot.  His production of The Motorcycle Diaries is a leftist whitewash of a very evil man, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara.  The enslavement of Cuba is greatly due to his efforts.  In the final years of this monster's relatively short life, Fidel Castro's close friend and comrade murdered people without hesitation.  Sometimes for next to nothing. When in doubt, Guevara felt it was better to put a bullet into the head of a perceived enemy of the revolution.  Was he always such a despicable creature?  The short answer: no.  According to this film, Che was once an idealist who valued truth and interacted with other human beings in a very generous manner.  There seems to be little evidence to suggest in 1952 that he would ever turn into a blood thirsty Marxist ideologue.  On the contrary, one might have more readily predicted Che would invent a cure for leprosy.We observe Ernesto Guevara traveling through South America with his buddy Alberto Granado.  They have more time than money.  This is suppose to be their voyage of discovery before returning to the serious duties of earning a good income and fulfilling their career ambitions.  There are hints of their left-wing political leanings, but for the most part they seem like wild and crazy guys seeking adventure and a good time.  The Motorcycle Diaries fails to deliver.  I want to know what happened to Che immediately after his trip.  Who did he meet that pushed him over the edge?  What finally enticed Guevara to become a political extremist?

I could really relate to this experience, as I have also found this to be true in my own life.  I give kudos to the writers of this film who wrote a very layered piece which could relate to individuals on many levels and the actors were on point in their portrayals.  Robert Redford is the executive producer on this film and made a wonderful choice in taking on this film.  A true tribute to his development and experiences with the Sundance Film Institute.The most important thing the movie reflects is truth and self-realization.  The truth that 2 friends wil be parting ways and what path each one will choose.  One comfortable and safe, the other difficult and challenging.  It was a truly human film that made me reflect on the choices of my life and what my life would have been had I made different choices.

The script -- which tells the idealized story of a continent-spanning, soul-transforming road trip taken by a young Ernesto ""Fuser"" Guevara (later to be known as ""Che"") -- is a masterpiece of understatement and economy, and the acting is uniformly terrific.  I honestly don't think there is a single weak link anywhere to be found in this film: other than the arguably simplistic portrayal of a potent historical character, this is as perfect a movie as you'll ever see.

629032,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JNCZ,Ed Uyeshima,"[21, 26]","When I visited South America on my own extended trip a couple of years ago, I was amazed how many times I saw pictures of Che Guevara everywhere I went....cafes, outdoor bulletin boards, art galleries, even department stores. Now I understand why. Having just read his diary, I was greatly anticipating this film, and my interest only heightened when I started seeing the travelogue shots in the previews. I am happy to report the film surpasses my expectations on almost every level. It is exquisite - perceptively directed, beautifully photographed and wondrously acted by a cast headed by two charismatic actors who tap deep into the hearts and souls of their characters. Whereas the book is more observational, the movie provides a more involving feeling in its portrait of a young man on the brink of his political awakening. It starts out somewhat deceptively as a comic buddy picture with the young Ernesto Guevara (pre-Che), a medical student, leaving his family and accompanying his seemingly more worldly pal Alberto Granado, a biochemist, on a dilapidated 1939 Norton motorbike traversing South America from their native Buenos Aires to Caracas. It is obvious what Alberto's hormonally charged intentions are on this months-long journey, but at 23, Ernesto is at a more sensitive juncture in his life where his encounters and observations have a deeper impact on his ideology.What I really like about the film is how it changes in tone and texture as the boys' hunt for adventure evolves into life-changing experiences for both of them. The motorbike acts as a metaphor for this change, as it unsurprisingly breaks down forcing them to open their eyes to the poverty and quiet struggle of the local people in each of the countries they visit. The story winds through wintry Patagonia, the blistering Atacama Desert, the awe-inspiring Machu Picchu and several towns in between. But the most touching passage takes place at the San Pablo leper colony in the Peruvian Amazon basin, where Ernesto bonds deeply with the lepers to the chagrin of the local nuns. His night swim across the Amazon, struggling for air through his asthma, is a powerful scene among many in this subtly potent film.As he proved with his wonderful ""Central Station"", director Walter Salles has an acute ability to connect his characters to their settings in deeply emotional ways. He is the ideal choice to guide this road movie. As Guevara, Gael Garcia Bernal transcends his Tiger Beat, teen heartthrob looks and delivers a deeply touching performance, as he grows from a big city innocent to a haunted young man ready to take on a greater cause than his medical career. He does an especially strong job in conveying his character's unblinking honesty and displaying unexpected acts of rage and compassion. Just as good is Rodrigo de la Serna in his feature film debut as Granado, effortlessly showing his character's bravado and humor while finding his own bumpy way in the world. His reactions to his buddy's political declaration at the birthday party, and to his own feelings during their goodbye at the end, are among the most poignant moments in the movie. In fact, much of the film's power comes from their palpable chemistry and unforced rapport. They are instantly and completely believable as best friends. And much more than the book, the film builds a solid emotional bridge between the young innocent and the Communist revolutionary Guevara was to become. If you are not aware of his fate, it is briefly summarized in subtitles at the end, and the coda with the real Granado is moving. While this may be the most glowing portrayal of a Communist-in-the-making since Warren Beatty's film about John Reed, ""Reds"", don't let that stop you from seeing this mesmerizing work. This is a wonderfully heartfelt film.**ADDENDUM ABOUT THE DVD RELEASE POSTED ON FEBRUARY 18, 2005**There are three extended deleted scenes included in the DVD package, none indispensable but still valuable for the additional context they provide to an essentially episodic movie. I particularly liked the sequence with the blind truck driver risking the lives of the two vagabonds as he swerves perilously on a treacherous mountain road. The obligatory making-of documentary is helpful, and includes comments from Salles, screenwriter Jose Rivera and executive producer Robert Redford. There are also a  couple of brief Spanish-language TV interviews with Bernal and a quick interview with the film's composer, Gustavo Santaolalla.",5,Buddy Picture Reaches Far Deeper Into the Heart,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,4498,"['When', 'visited', 'South', 'America', 'own', 'extended', 'trip', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'saw', 'pictures', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'everywhere', 'went', '.cafes', 'outdoor', 'bulletin', 'boards', 'art', 'galleries', 'even', 'department', 'stores', 'Now', 'understand', 'why', 'Having', 'just', 'read', 'diary', 'was', 'greatly', 'anticipating', 'film', 'interest', 'only', 'heightened', 'when', 'started', 'seeing', 'travelogue', 'shots', 'previews', 'am', 'happy', 'report', 'film', 'surpasses', 'expectations', 'almost', 'level', 'exquisite', 'perceptively', 'directed', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'wondrously', 'acted', 'cast', 'headed', 'two', 'charismatic', 'actors', 'who', 'tap', 'deep', 'hearts', 'souls', 'characters', 'book', 'more', 'observational', 'movie', 'more', 'involving', 'feeling', 'portrait', 'young', 'man', 'brink', 'political', 'awakening', 'out', 'somewhat', 'deceptively', 'comic', 'buddy', 'picture', 'young', 'Ernesto', 'Guevara', 'pre-Che', 'medical', 'student', 'leaving', 'family', 'accompanying', 'seemingly', 'more', 'worldly', 'pal', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'biochemist', 'dilapidated', '1939', 'Norton', 'traversing', 'South', 'America', 'native', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'Caracas', 'obvious', 'what', 'Alberto', 'hormonally', 'charged', 'intentions', 'are', 'months-long', 'journey', '23', 'Ernesto', 'more', 'sensitive', 'juncture', 'life', 'where', 'encounters', 'observations', 'have', 'deeper', 'impact', 'ideology.What', 'really', 'film', 'how', 'tone', 'texture', 'boys', 'hunt', 'adventure', 'life-changing', 'experiences', 'motorbike', 'acts', 'metaphor', 'change', 'unsurprisingly', 'down', 'forcing', 'open', 'eyes', 'poverty', 'quiet', 'struggle', 'local', 'people', 'countries', 'visit', 'story', 'wintry', 'Patagonia', 'blistering', 'Atacama', 'Desert', 'awe-inspiring', 'Machu', 'Picchu', 'several', 'towns', 'most', 'touching', 'passage', 'place', 'San', 'Pablo', 'leper', 'colony', 'Peruvian', 'Amazon', 'basin', 'where', 'Ernesto', 'bonds', 'deeply', 'lepers', 'chagrin', 'local', 'nuns', 'night', 'swim', 'Amazon', 'struggling', 'air', 'asthma', 'powerful', 'scene', 'many', 'subtly', 'potent', 'film.As', 'proved', 'wonderful', 'Central', 'Station', 'director', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'acute', 'ability', 'connect', 'characters', 'settings', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'ways', 'ideal', 'choice', 'guide', 'road', 'movie', 'Guevara', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Tiger', 'Beat', 'teen', 'heartthrob', 'looks', 'deeply', 'touching', 'performance', 'big', 'city', 'innocent', 'haunted', 'young', 'man', 'ready', 'take', 'greater', 'cause', 'medical', 'career', 'especially', 'strong', 'job', 'conveying', 'character', 'unblinking', 'honesty', 'displaying', 'unexpected', 'acts', 'rage', 'compassion', 'Just', 'good', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'Granado', 'effortlessly', 'showing', 'character', 'bravado', 'humor', 'finding', 'own', 'bumpy', 'way', 'world', 'reactions', 'buddy', 'political', 'declaration', 'birthday', 'party', 'own', 'feelings', 'goodbye', 'end', 'are', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'movie', 'fact', 'much', 'film', 'power', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'unforced', 'rapport', 'are', 'instantly', 'completely', 'believable', 'best', 'friends', 'much', 'more', 'book', 'film', 'solid', 'emotional', 'bridge', 'young', 'innocent', 'Communist', 'revolutionary', 'Guevara', 'was', 'become', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'fate', 'briefly', 'summarized', 'subtitles', 'end', 'coda', 'real', 'Granado', 'moving', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'glowing', 'portrayal', 'Communist-in-the-making', 'Warren', 'Beatty', 'film', 'John', 'Reed', 'Reds', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'seeing', 'mesmerizing', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'heartfelt', 'film', '**ADDENDUM', 'THE', 'DVD', 'RELEASE', 'POSTED', 'ON', 'FEBRUARY', '18', '2005**There', 'are', 'three', 'extended', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'DVD', 'package', 'none', 'indispensable', 'still', 'valuable', 'additional', 'context', 'provide', 'essentially', 'episodic', 'movie', 'particularly', 'liked', 'sequence', 'blind', 'truck', 'driver', 'risking', 'lives', 'two', 'vagabonds', 'perilously', 'treacherous', 'mountain', 'road', 'obligatory', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'helpful', 'comments', 'Salles', 'screenwriter', 'Jose', 'Rivera', 'executive', 'producer', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'brief', 'Spanish-language', 'TV', 'interviews', 'Bernal', 'quick', 'interview', 'film', 'composer', 'Gustavo', 'Santaolalla']",N/A
629033,A1RS4HDCCCFF3,B00005JNCZ,Ein Stein,"[4, 6]","Great flick. I first caught this during my Spanish 1 class and I loved it not only because I found the subject matter (that of Che Guevara) to be interesting but because it has a quality about it that is intended to inspire and awaken the romantic in anyone. This is basically a road movie about friendship and self-awakening. Alberto and Ernesto are two medical students (a pharmacist and a doctor) who take to the roads of South America in a journey that would forever change their lives and set a winding path towards their respective destinies. A lot of people probably don't know much about Che Guevara (but man oh man, look at all the people who wear the shirts with his face on it). He was a hero to some but he is also subject to criticism by many. Like him or not, there is no denying that he was a revolutionary who helped changed the political landscape of Cuba and potentially the entire of Latin America if not for his untimely death. But this movie does not talk of him in that manner. On the contrary, we see him here as a very impressionable young man and we get inklings of who he would become as the movie progresses. I won't give away anything else but suffice to say that this film is touching because of the level of humanity that it encompasses and not because it is a movie about Guevara and Guevara alone. As a matter of fact, I found Alberto more likeable and engaging because of his ""ahem"" womanistic and happy-go-lucky personality which does a great job in contrasting with Ernesto's seriousness.I've read my Latin American history in college and I just can't put those things into context when viewing this movie because there is no substitute for the personal aspect that it brings. I only wish that there was more because as the ending approached, I truly felt a strong sense of attachment to the protagonists and the characters they encounter. Watch this movie. You won't regret it one bit.My gripe with the dvd version is with regards to the poor English subtitling, it's the type that kind of gets in the way of a good movie (bad grammar).

629035,A1CHOKV10NEI8X,B00005JNCZ,"E. M. Van Court ""Van""","[3, 5]","""The Motorcycle Diaries"" averaged three stars, including three on its merits as film.  Lets look at the other factors first.As propaganda; as a mass media product intended to shape attitudes and influence people, five stars.  The imagery is powerful and emotionally persuasive, the story makes the point clear, and the subject of this fictionalized account of ""Che"" Guevara's journey across South America will do much to keep a communist/socialist/popular revolutionary in the same mindset as his or her comrades.  Even a fairly hardened Capitalist will hesitate at the depiction of the plight of miners in South America.  Powerful appeals to emotion, plus the iconic value of ""Che"" make this an extremely competent bit of psychological campaigning whether or not you buy it or the agenda it pushes.As an interpretation of a book: a dismal failure; one star.  Che's book was funny, light-hearted, and depicted a very human man barely out of adolescence, trying to find himself, liquor, and physical intimacy (maybe not in that order...).  He was able to laugh at himself.  This movie misses that altogether.  Ernesto may be depicted as human, a subject of sympathy, or even youthfully foolish at times, but never as the one to laugh at, and never really laughing at himself.  The changes in events and parts of the book that were ignored make this evident; that the filmakers took themselves and their cause more seriously than anyone outside their cause can.As film;  Three stars; it was OK, but only OK.  The story depended too much on Che being Che as opposed to any other young physician traveling through South America, where the book had other merits.  It was also to preachy abouth the political message; a less direct approach could have won it a broader audience.  The scenery of Latin America is the real star of the film, varied but always magnificent and captured well by the filmmakers.  The real star in my mind is the lady who played Silvia, a young woman with leprosy, with a lovely face despite her ailment.  She played the role with heart, and was brilliant as she regained hope and a desire to live, despite her daily suffering.As it relates to current events: Although Che had little in common with a modern irhabi and munafiquun (false Muslims who commit murder that defiles Islam), Che was a physician who took up arms for a cause.  This movie depicts a heavily fictionalized account of what shaped this change.

629036,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00005JNCZ,Erica Anderson,"[4, 5]","""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is one of those rare films that one should see on the big screen. Having just watched the film on dvd, I wished that I did take the time to see the film in the theatre last year. The film is based on a road trip that the late Communist/Latino revolutionary Ernesto `Che' Guevara took with his best friend Alberto Granado in South America. The two friends wanted to explore South America as they have never seen it. Gael Garcia Bernal from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"",  and ""Bad Education"" plays the young Ernesto `Che' Guevara and Rodrigo de la Serna as Alberto Granado. The first half of the film begins as a road flick where two friends decides on a whim to travel the country by motorcycle but during the second half, the viewer sees the nature of the film turn serious as Ernesto and Alberto starts encountering various locals who are impoverished and are suffering under the tyranny of their local government. Gael Garcia Bernal's performance as a young Che Guevara was truly impressive. There is a quiet intensity about him as an actor that made me believe that he was Che Guevara. Rodrigo de la Serna was a delight to watch as Che's womanizing, playful companion and was just as much fun to watch as Gael Garcia was as Che. The scenery was breathtaking. I truly felt like I was in South America personally. Throughout the first half of the film I always wondered where on earth the two friends found gas for the motorcycle because all I saw was them driving in desolated areas of the country where there is no gas stations. The Latin-tinged film score was excellent. It complimented each scene. Nothing loud and bombastic like in American films where the music almost overwhelms the scenes. The second hour of the film is easily the strongest moments of the film. Seeing Che and Alberto interact with the patients of a leper colony was deeply moving. I especially liked the interaction between Che and a young woman who refused to have surgery. Another great scene was when Che and Alberto arrived at the colony and shook hands with a couple of the residents without gloves as a symbolic gesture. All in all I loved the film. The performances by Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna were excellent and were a joy to watch. The bonus features were far from disappointing. Lots of bonus goodies. I really enjoyed the making of the film and the conversation with Alberto Granado.",5,A brief glimpse of Che Guevara before his revolutionary days,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,2406,"['Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'one', 'should', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'Having', 'just', 'watched', 'film', 'dvd', 'wished', 'did', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'theatre', 'last', 'year', 'film', 'based', 'road', 'trip', 'late', 'Communist/Latino', 'revolutionary', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'took', 'best', 'friend', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'South', 'America', 'two', 'friends', 'wanted', 'explore', 'South', 'America', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Y', 'Tu', 'Mama', 'Tambien', 'Bad', 'Education', 'young', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'road', 'flick', 'where', 'two', 'friends', 'whim', 'travel', 'country', 'motorcycle', 'second', 'half', 'viewer', 'nature', 'film', 'turn', 'serious', 'Ernesto', 'Alberto', 'encountering', 'various', 'locals', 'who', 'are', 'impoverished', 'are', 'suffering', 'tyranny', 'local', 'government', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'performance', 'young', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'was', 'truly', 'impressive', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'about', 'actor', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'Rodrigo', 'la', 'Serna', 'was', 'delight', 'watch', 'Che', 'womanizing', 'playful', 'companion', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'was', 'Che', 'scenery', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'truly', 'felt', 'was', 'South', 'America', 'personally', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'always', 'wondered', 'where', 'two', 'friends', 'found', 'gas', 'motorcycle', 'saw', 'was', 'driving', 'desolated', 'areas', 'country', 'where', 'gas', 'stations', 'Latin-tinged', 'film', 'score', 'was', 'excellent', 'complimented', 'scene', 'Nothing', 'loud', 'bombastic', 'like', 'American', 'films', 'where', 'music', 'almost', 'scenes', 'second', 'hour', 'film', 'easily', 'strongest', 'moments', 'film', 'Seeing', 'Che', 'Alberto', 'interact', 'patients', 'leper', 'colony', 'was', 'deeply', 'moving', 'especially', 'liked', 'interaction', 'Che', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'refused', 'have', 'surgery', 'great', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Che', 'Alberto', 'arrived', 'colony', 'shook', 'hands', 'couple', 'residents', 'gloves', 'symbolic', 'gesture', 'loved', 'film', 'performances', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'were', 'excellent', 'were', 'joy', 'watch', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', 'far', 'disappointing', 'Lots', 'bonus', 'goodies', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'film', 'conversation', 'Alberto', 'Granado']",N/A

629040,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JNCZ,Grady Harp,"[7, 9]","THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is certainly one of the finest films of the year - a daring, compassionate re-creation of the journey of two young, well-to-do Argentinean lads who leave their privileged positions of biochemist and fourth year Medical student to follow their idea of traveling by motorcycle from their native Buenos Aires down to Patagonia, up through Chile, Peru, Colombia to Venezuela.  Sounds like a light hearted Trip Movie, but instead this journey, factually made by one Ernesto (aka 'Che' and 'Fuser') Guevara de la Serna and his close friend Alberto Granado ('Chubby'), is one of the most touching and sensitive passages into self acceptance and awareness of the world as a place where equality of people is a microscopic speck of illusion that is revealed by a carefully constructed script by Jose Rivera based on the diaries of both of these men made during and after their journey.  Walter Salles (""Behind the Sun"", ""Central Station"") once again proves himself a director who can infuse his vision of a story with uncomplicated directness of approach, having the sensitivity to allow his well-chosen actors to create wholly believable, three-dimensional characters, whether the actors are the leads or simply minor roles that hold the camera's eye for seconds.Taken as simply a movie to enjoy, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is as beautiful as a National Geographic Magazine feature on the Amazon and the deserted and populated lands of South America.  But given his re-creation of Che Guevara's and Alberto Granado's meaningful excursion into manhood this movie goes far beyond entertainment and enters that rarefied arena of psychobiography.  Traveling on an old motorcycle, the two lads encounter hunger, accidents, lusting after women at every stop, ingratiating panhandling, and the gradual revelation of the quality of life of the indigenous peoples of South America.  They are touched by the plights of the people, the people in turn love the boys, and they eventually spend three weeks living and working in a leprosarium run by the nuns, adding their knowledge of medicine to helping not only the physical needs of the lepers but finding ways to break the psychosocial ostracism that historically curses the 'unclean'.  Breaking down these barriers, forming strong relationships with those tending the lepers as well as the lepers themselves, lays the seeds of 'revolution' or Change in the minds of the lads, especially Ernesto or 'Che'.  The film does not begin to preach or to make the Che Guevara of Cuban militancy fame a hero:  it doesn't have to, as the transformation in the mind of Che is so beautifully subtle.  The journey has given him the  insight that he must devote himself to changing the inequality and poverty of his America.  The events that followed this Motorcycle journey are provided in voice over, black and white footage of people's faces, and a final scene in Havana at the ending of the film. No more need be said.Gael Garcia Bernal gives an incredibly thoughtful, stunning portrayal of Che, saying so much more with his eyes, his body language (especially as he suffers through his own physical demon of asthma attacks), and his perfect embodiment of the spirit  of a man who becomes enlightened by the peasants he comes to love.  Bernal is already a brilliant actor and a magnetic screen presence, and if he is not nominated for an Oscar for this unique, artful role it will be a major surprise. His is a career to watch!  Likewise Rodrigo de la Serna is completely immersed in his role as Alberto and shows the same quality of quiet growth as a character as the movie progresses.  ALL of the many extras in this huge cast are memorable: the leper colony abounds with some of the most touching human beings ever captured on film.  The camera work, the musical scoring, the obvious commitment on the part of everyone involved in this glorious picture - every aspect of THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is exactly right.

Humberto Fontova helps us remember the real Che:""When you saw the beaming look on Che's face as the victims were tied to the stake and blasted apart by the firing squad,"" said a former Cuban political prisoner Roberto Martin-Perez ... ""you saw there was something seriously, seriously wrong with Che Guevara."" As commander of the La Cabana execution yard, Che often shattered the skull of the condemned man (or boy) by firing the coup de grace himself. When other duties tore him away from his beloved execution yard, he consoled himself by viewing the slaughter. Che's second-story office in Havana's La Cabana prison had a section of wall torn out so he could watch his darling firing-squads at work.Even as a youth, Ernesto Guevara's writings revealed a serious mental illness. ""My nostrils dilate while savoring the acrid odor of gunpowder and blood. Crazy with fury I will stain my rifle red while slaughtering any vencido that falls in my hands!"" This passage is from Ernesto Guevara's famous Motorcycle Diaries, though Robert Redford somehow overlooked it while directing his heart-warming movie.The Spanish word vencido, by the way, translates into ""defeated"" or ""surrendered.""And indeed, ""the ""acrid odor of gunpowder and blood"" very, very rarely reached Guevara's nostrils from anything properly describable as combat. It mostly came from the close-range murders of defenseless men (and boys.) Carlos Machado was 15 years old in 1963 when the bullets from the firing squad shattered his body. His twin brother and father collapsed beside Carlos from the same volley. All had resisted Castro and Che's theft of their humble family farm, all refused blindfolds and all died sneering at their Communist murderers, as did thousands of their valiant countrymen.The one genuine accomplishment in Che Guevara's life was the mass-murder of defenseless men and boys. Under his own gun dozens died. Under his orders thousands crumpled. At everything else Che Guevara failed abysmally, even comically.During his Bolivian ""guerrilla"" campaign, Che split his forces whereupon they got hopelessly lost and bumbled around, half-starved, half-clothed and half-shod, without any contact with each other for 6 months before being wiped out. They ... seemed incapable of applying a compass reading to a map. They spent much of the time walking in circles and were usually within a mile of each other. During this blundering they often engaged in ferocious firefights against each other.""You hate to laugh at anything associated with Che, who murdered so many defenseless men and boys,"" says Felix Rodriguez, the Cuban-American CIA officer who played a key role in tracking him down in Bolivia.

It's ditched about a quarter way through the film, a 1939 Norton 500 classic called ""The Mighty One"".The black sputtering sleek machine, bleeding oil and begging another mile possessed a lot more rebel spirit than Che Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal), the legendary revolutionary depicted here in this autobiographical story as a reserved young man with the budding awareness of social injustice in 1950's South America. He's a good hearted humanist and unfortunately, aside from the glare of his sympathetic heart, we never do learn what makes this infamous historical figure tick. We know he'd give you the shirt off his back, give away his last money to the needy, question the ideology of Christian missionaries swapping needed food for sermon, but when he's asked by a budding novelist to critique the work, his brutal honesty and derogative comments are treated with the reserve of noble causes as if we're to understand he's painfully truthful as well. Here Gael Garcia Bernal, more so than in Pedro Almodovar's gay oriented ""Bad Education"", is a bit of a real drag. ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" brings no face to Che Guevara. It's just a point by point filming of his writing where issues of urgency; the selfish provincialism of South American countries, the overwhelming of ingenuous peoples, are merely chapter headings in what amounts to a feeble character study. But I liked the bike. I liked the South American history and scenery. I liked his riding partner's (Rodrigo De la Serna) snaky dancing.

He performed for the Cuban revolution what Heinrich Himmler performed for the Nazis. Everything Che Guevara did was directed by Fidel Castro. Early on, when they were in the mountains, Castro realized that Che seemed to relish executing little farm boys. There were executions carried out, carried out in the mountains, of so-called informers. I interviewed many people who witnessed those executions. There was no due process.Che Guevara wrote a letter to his father in 1957 and to his abandoned wife. In the letter to her, he wrote, ""I'm here in Cuba's hills, alive and thirsting for blood."" Then, to his father, ""I really like killing."" The man was a clinical sadist, whereas Fidel Castro you could describe as a psychopath in that the murders did not affect him one way or the other. It was a means to an end - the consolidation of his one-man rule. Che has a famous quote, where he wrote, a revolutionary has to become ""a cold killing machine."" The thing was, Che Guevara was anything but cold. He was a warm killing machine. He relished the slaughter.And Hollywood can't stop making movies idolizing him, which helps to place this recent essay by Jonah Goldberg into context.[...]If you are aware of what Che was & want to buy the movie, fine.

Of course, to start the trip, you would never think it would be the stuff of change, but alas, meeting people from all walks of life would dare to tempt your thoughts, expose you to more than you thought, and expand a world before you. Such was the journey of Ernesto and Alberto, two young doctors in search of wine, women, and song, and end up finding a world in need. Such is the amaingly quiet and stunning film ""The Motorcycle Diaries"".Here we have two impressionable lads, who dare to set out on a journey around South America, and in turn, find much more than they bargained for. In order to reach a leper colony where they hope to spend some time, Ernesto and Alberto use a motorcycle, fondly dubbed ""The Mighty One"". Leaving Buenos Aries, they seemingly run into everything along the road, including, rather enjoyably, a cow. However, soon, when the motorcycle is history, and the two must set out on their feet, the reality of the hardships of people in the world come to them, and they experience it firsthand. While the experiences are shared between the two, it is Ernesto, who will become the infamous Cuban revolutionary Che, who takes these people to his heart and it profoundly begins to work his thinking.This film can rightfully be called half of a two buddies on the road picture, with the other half being a picture of great social commentary. Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal is amazing as Ernesto. His depth of feeling as an actor penetrates every cel of this film, and his performance is Oscar worthy. Equally worth is Rodrigo De la Serna's performance as the heavy (?) Alberto, who plays perfect accompaniment to Gael. When Ernesto becomes embroiled in his thoughts, Rodrigo carries the audience with him until the end in tremendous fashion.One thing about this movie will haunt me for years. The filmmakers decided, towards the end of the movie, to film the different people's of Latin America in black and white, almost as if their pictures are being taken.

629054,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00005JNCZ,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[5, 12]","In January, 1952, 23 year-old Ernesto Guevera de la Serna, called ""Fuser,"" with affection, along with good friend, Alberto Granado, began an eight month-long epic journey, (almost 5000 miles) - an adventure of a lifetime - which was to have a tremendous impact on both of their lives. Ernesto still had a semester to go before he would finish medical school with a specialization in leprosy. Granado was a biochemist, about to begin his career. The two rode the ""The Mighty One,"" an old 1939 Norton 500 motorcycle, on its last legs. Beginning in Buenos Aires, they traveled west to Patagonia, then crossed the border into Chile and headed north, across the rugged Andes to Machu Picchu, Peru. After a stay with a doctor friend and mentor in Lima, they volunteered their services at the San Pablo Leper Colony in the Peruvian Amazon. Arriving in Caracas, Venezuela, in time for Alberto's 30th birthday, Ernesto and Alberto achieved their goal - under duress. ""The Mighty One"" gave out on them before they reached Valparaiso, Chile, with most of their trip ahead of them. Filled with idealism and dreams, they were not deterred. The two men used their feet and thumbs, to make their way across a continent.""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is much more than a historical travel film. It is a moving drama about the human spirit, rife with comedic moments, as Alberto and Fuser banter, argue, and provide each other with conversation and companionship on the road. Granado's attachment to his beloved motorcycle is hilarious, as is his highly developed art of bullsh*t. His charm and gift of gab come in extremely handy when money and transportation are needed. And his eye for women never fails. Ernesto, an extremely sensitive person, lacks this smooth-talking manner. Oddly enough, for one so perceptive, he is almost brutal in his honesty, often to his own detriment. Neither of the men had ever been outside their native Argentina before. They meet hundreds of people along the way, from all stations in life. But because of their lack of funds, they almost always share company, and whatever food and shelter are available, with the poor. Ernesto is especially moved and angered by the poverty and injustice he witnesses. This growing awareness of the vast differences in social and economic circumstances between the wealthy few, and the multitude who barely eke out an existence, all over Latin America, begins a process of transformation for Ernesto. And this transformation is the driving force behind the film. The tremendous transition from middle class professional to future revolutionary, begins on this journey.Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal, as Ernesto Guevara, and Rodrigo De la Serna, as Alberto, (the real life cousin of Ch&eacute; Guevara), give extraordinarily nuanced performances. The two actors are the film's very heart, soul and energy. De la Serna provides humor and warmth, an excellent contrast to Garcia Bernal's more serious, intense young Ernesto. The supporting cast also excels -  from a pair of Chilean sisters, to the lepers at the San Pablo colony, a desperately poor couple looking for work at the Anaconda mines, and various others - the acting is superb!A variety of exquisite South American landscapes, in all kinds of weather, are beautifully portrayed. The shots of Machu Picchu and Cuzco are phenomenal. Living portraits, in black and white, of the people encountered along the way, are one of the movie's highlights. I am personally touched by ""The Motorcycle Diaries."" I lived in Central and South America for 15 years, and traveled many of the roads that Guevara and Grenado passed along, years before me - although, fortunately I had much better transportation. I worked for a non-governmental, non-profit relief organization. The poverty and hopelessness that were documented in the ""Motorcycle Diaries,"" still exist today. Although modern technology has reached the cities, the beautiful scenery of the countryside is the same, as are the faces of the people, their songs, dances, native dress, languages and dialects. At the movie's conclusion, the final shot is of the now very old Alberto Grenado, the man who made this famous trip back in 1952.I am moved at how well Brazillian director Walter Salles captured the peoples of South America, their cultures and ambiance, and the content of the diaries. He has remained faithful to the literary sources - Alberto Grenado's book and the notebooks of Ernesto Guevara, which were not found until long after his death, and only published in 1993. When he wrote of his trip, he did so with the youthful idealism of a 23 year-old, not knowing his future role in history. It is this fresh, idealistic perspective, and the genuine expression of social consciousness, that makes the film so powerful. Although no political agenda is promoted here, the film does explain some of the passion behind the decisions that Ernesto Guevara made later in life.I say BRAVO to all who participated in making this movie and highly recommend it.JANA",5,The Trip Of A Lifetime With A Lifelong Impact!,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,5012,"['January', '1952', '23', 'year-old', 'Ernesto', 'Guevera', 'la', 'Serna',

629055,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B00005JNCZ,Jeffery Mingo,"[6, 10]","Ebert slammed this film, basically saying Che was a nasty authoritarian and that it's pointless to honor him.  I heard Che was a homophobe.  I think I read that in Quiroga's ""Tropics of Desire.""  Now it may be presentist for me to say that, but the point is that you won't be seeing me wear his face on a shirt.  I ain't no fan of his.  Still, this movie was compelling in many ways.So Che and his buddy Alberto go on a trip through South America.  It's funny that it is called ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" when they only travel partially by motorcycle.  Then again circumnavigation is credited to Magellen even though he died in the Philippines.  This was an interesting filmic contribution to men's studies.  There are so many architypes here.  Males leave their comfortable homes to see the world and prove themselves.  They chase women along the way.  They have a love-hate relationship with money.  There are conflicts between the alpha and beta male.  Men get over by telling lies.  Men both hate their buddies and are devoted to them.  And the list goes on.The important point in this movie is that Che learns about oppression based upon race, class, political affiliation, and disability.  However, I wish the characters could have examined their privilege more.  I highly doubt that a black man, a Native man, or a woman of any race could have freely moved around South America in the 1950s with ease, and they certainly couldn't have run out of money and been given new money so freely.  It is also significant that Che and Alberto only traveled in Spanish-speaking countries.  I noticed that there were few blacks in this film.  I think it would have been different had the two Argentinians traveled to Surinam (English-speaking) or Brazil (Portuguese-speaking).  But maybe they purposefully did not want to be linguistic strangers on top of being foreigners.Many critics have raved about the visual landscapes here.  They were nice, but I wasn't in awe with them as I had expected to be.  You only see one llama in this film. You see a river, but I don't think it's the Amazon.  I guess the diversity in South America, to me, revolves around the people.  And I think we only saw a slice of that here.Alberto is often refered to as ""fat"" or ""chubby"" here.  Yes, he was larger than Che.  But there wasn't a contrast like Laurel and Hardy.  I'm not sure if food scarcity would have made people in the 1950s, especially those from developing countries, analyze weight differently than we do.  Then again, newspapers say there is an obesity crisis in the United States and Europe, so maybe I'm a skewed judge.I once saw a Latino artistic troupe on public television.  The Latino artist said, ""The Latino man is known for three things:  fighting, dancing, and making love.""  In this film, some characters refuse to do some or all of those activities.  But they definitely came up as themes.  They definitely played a role in defining manhood, tacitly Latino manhood, here.  Alice Walker once said of Castro, ""I love Fidel, but I wish he could dance.""  Che couldn't dance in this film.  I wonder if Fidel and Che ever broached that topic after this voyage and before Alice met him.A huge aspect of this film is Alberto and Che fighting over who could keep and use the American dollars Che had.  It was disturbing but informative to see that even in the 1950s, U.S. currency had such power.Like Cubans, Argentinians must drop the ending and syllables in some words.  One character said ""prosperidad"" and the s was clearly lacking from it.  When Javier Bardem played Reinaldo Arenas in ""Before Night Falls"" many articles noted that the Spanish actor had to learn how to speak like a Cuban.  I haven't heard any article says that Gael Garcia Bernal, a Mexican national, had to learn to speak with an Argentinian accent.  In the same way that Vin Diesel is always playing the muscular guy in the predominately-white male clique (""Band of Brothers"", ""Knockaround Guys"", ""Wall Street"", etc.), now that I've seen ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and this, I'm worried that Bernal may be typecast as one partner in buddy adventures.  Recently he said he refuses to play the limited Latino roles that Hollywood keeps offering to him.  Go, boy!I heard critics say they hated seeing Tina Turner in ""What's Love Got to Do with It?"" after Angela Bassett spent 90 great minutes portraying her.  But they show the real-life Alberto de la Serna here and it really adds to the fim.  First off, I'm impressed that he's still alive, especially given that Che was assassinated.  They also show actual photos of the two men during their trip.  I loved this.  It powerfully reminds you that this really happened.  I  liked the way the two Aboriginal women in ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" are shown at the end too.When I saw the film, the theater was packed.  When I began clapping at the end, the audience followed suit. Taken ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" as the initiator, I love seeing American audiences appreciating and not shying away from foreign films with subtitles.The film was really moving.  It ran a little too long.  Still, big thumbs up!",4,che & buddy,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,5113,"['Ebert', 'slammed', 'film', 'basically', 'saying', 'Che', 'was', 'nasty', 'authoritarian', 'pointless', 'honor', 'heard',

I am pleased to see that he convincingly managed to overcome geographical barriers, to accomplish a high standard of film making. The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and reminded me how little of the South American landscape we ever see on film in the U.S. The cinematographer has pulled off a major feat in shooting a period film in slightly grainy, sometimes shaky hand-held. No crane shots or sepia tinting here-the film quality immerses you in Guevara and Granado's experiences and makes them feel very immediate, without sacrificing any sense of history. A film like this is long overdue, and it deserves wide distribution.""Diaries"" runs smoothly and effortlessly, without a trace of boredom. It is frequently funny and it makes the audience aware of deep emotions inside the minds of two young adventurers, who were bound to change their lives forever. I am glad that ""Diaries"" did not try to make a political speech or to explain to us why Guevara was a revolutionary man. It simply shows two friends traveling together, with completely different personalities but profound affection and respect for each others idealism.Upon reading the credits, one can clearly see that this is joint project, done by people who are deeply involved with good, non-commercial film making.

629057,A1SMFD252FTJP9,B00005JNCZ,Jerika,"[24, 27]","...I want to offer an almost-opposite reaction. Yes, I admit I went into the theater not knowing a) much at all about Che Guevara, or b) that the film was even about Che. I was mesmerized all the way through, by the subtle messages about the plight of working-class Latin Americans, by the sweeping landscapes and by the fantastic performances. Once I (finally) figured out that the Ernesto Guevara in this film was indeed *the* Ernesto Guevara, I thought, ""How brilliant."" It doesn't set out to portray him as a saint (as a previous reviewer said), or as a villain-in-the-making. It's a very rare thing in cinema, or history studies in general: a portrait of a man as a man. What you make of the path Che later chose as a result of these experiences is a different matter entirely, and one frankly not related to this film at all.Some have cried, ""Would you enjoy a movie that portrayed a young Hitler sympathetically?"" My answer: a) that's really not an accurate comparison, and b) maybe, if it were this well written and acted and filmed. Imagine the story of the Beer Hall Putsch told in such a way that we really got into the youthful main character's mind to discover its workings and motivations. It wouldn't excuse what he did, but explain it in a more insightful way than the boiled-down mush we are served in our history books.

It's Germany, 1906, and we're following the picaresque adventures of 17 year old Adolf Hitler and his comedic sidekick August Kubizek. As our romantic young heroes flirt with fraulein all over scenic Austria and Bavaria and get into scraps with local yokels, among other wacky misadventures, they experience a political awakening as they witness the various depradations which the Jews are inflicting upon the German people. Among other crimes, we see the lascivious Jewish pimp selling the flesh of kidnapped 13 year old Aryan girls and the greedy Jewish capitalist cheating the German workers out of a living wage. In the film's climactic moment, after attending a performance of Wagner's stirring anthem to freedom- Rienzi- young Adolf and August climb the Freienberg hill overlooking Linz and Adolf, standing heroically in the moonlight with his blue eyes ablaze with purpose and an other-worldly determination, makes an impassioned declaration that from that moment forth he would live only for Germany and would one day lead her people out of their current bondage into a glorious future of freedom and justice for all. To the ecstatic theme of some Wagnerian crescendo, our film climaxes with a closeup of Adolf, his beautiful face ringed by the moon in a saintly halo.Sound outrageous? Then why aren't you outraged at the identical cinematic treatment given to Che Guevara, a murderous thug whose life's goal was to violently force mankind into slavery under the most blood-soaked, anti-human ideological system in history? This is a great movie- the story is absorbing; the characters are eminently likeable and sympathetic; the cinematography is stunningly lush and beautiful. But looming over it all is the fact that this is a hagiography for a psychotic mass murderer. One shudders to wonder that if a mere glamorous photograph of Che from the 1960s succeeded in beguiling 2 generations of feebleminded college radicals, then what kind of effect will this expertly rendered piece of totalitarian propaganda have on today's youth and future generations of young morons?It would be futile to try to enumerate this madman's thousands of crimes here. The interested reader could easily uncover the truth through a quick internet search. Suffice it to say that during the Cuban Missile Crisis he agitated to start a nuclear war and hoped to build his Maoist paradise amidst the radioactive ashes. Che is dead and his most fitting monuments are the concentration camps and mass graves he left behind. The larger issue is that this is yet another example- as if it were needed- of the mental perversion and hypocrisy of Hollywood. Whose idolatrous biopic should we expect next? Stalin's? Mao's? Bin Laden's? Hollywood is a fetid dumpster, breeding disease and infestation throughout the world, and any American who financially supports its products is a fool who is paying for his own contamination and eventual destruction.",3,Beautiful movie.

629059,A1K1609GB49BLX,B00005JNCZ,"Joel Marcus Johnson ""chesapeakebishop""","[29, 59]","There are many reasons one would like to give five stars to this film: the writing and acting, costuming, music, the engaging cinematography. Even the interviews with the Chilean indegenas incorporated into the screenplay, though not in the book, are so spontaneous as to be convincing. And I could even give stars for the ""historical fiction"" portions of the film, so many of them having been added, replacing the author's diary experiences.That said, the problem with this film is that it is absent the truth. Not much research would have been required to truthfully establish the mental condition of the protagonist. At this time of his life, his education was troubled, his personality and sexual identity ambiguous. Symptomatic of these protean divisions was that he wore in those days the same soiled shirt day after day, what he called the ""shirt of the week,"" his offensive trademark body odor disenchanting his friends, and especially his colleague students of the medical school.Given his mother's 22 years of narcissism and her control over Ernesto, and his father's flamboyant philandering and failure in odd business ventures, so weak was the wiring of his mental grid into which to integrate a personality. His mother's control was such that his failure in Miramar to receive the hand of Chichina, a high school-aged girl, was a self-fulfilling prophecy, heightened by his stink, a loss desired and manipulated by his mother purposefully approving his adolescent behavior of not bathing. If a giddy teeny-bopper will not love a boy who smells on purpose, Chichina or any other, such a neurotic, self-obsessive madre will. This is the benefit of being wed to one's mother.The film is poignant, however, even as fiction. For as we know Ernesto's mental decline over the course of his remaining few years, it is sad to reflect that the adolescent portrayed in the movie is experiencing the last rational days of his life. For not ten years will pass before his catalogue of neuroses grows to such weight that it cracks into psychotic rage in battle. He obtains license to kill. That most basic of psychological identifiers, his name, is displaced by a nickname which is not even a diminutive, but a meaningless jibe at the Argentine vocal tic, 'che', conferred upon him by the equally sexually ambiguous Fidel Castro. Fidel replaces his mother, his new controller. The grateful Che writes love poetry to his Fidel.After the revolution, the only mental mechanism by which he may justify his recent homicidal euphoria in war is to accept and revel in his first position as director and judge of the political revenge court at La Cabana. Being entrusted with this task by the new mother is all the approbation his battered and subservient ego needs to convince himself that he really is a good dog. This is all the permission he needs to execute so many thousands of political prisoners, and to create his very own boys club, all under the same roof. How thin a mental membrane lay between the desires for death and sex!A little later in his short life, after a succession of administrative disasters and his several exiles by Fidel, he fails again at warfare in Africa. In his psychological immobilization becoming unacceptable even to himself, he changes his appearance, shaving his head. He takes on a new persona, displacing the old, frustrated Che with yet another new name. His natural mother now dead, his replacement mother having become reticent, Ernesto by any name must now become his own mother. And this is his final failure.But he will have one terminal success. His mothers must be punished. He poorly plans a revolution in Bolivia, to which he rushes, advertizing his location. He is successful at something in that he creates his total immolation, his self-disintegration by suicide at the hands of others.If this film passes for truth without further consideration of who Ernesto was before the bike ride, and what that boy would become, then we need to make it the first in a series glamorizing the adolescence of all terrorists and dictators, making of each ""The Little Plowboy Who Whistled O'er the Lea"". Say, the boyhood Hitler strolling the Alps, innocently day-dreaming of the day he'll be rewarded with his own chalet at Berchtesgarden. Or Osama bin Laden, eyes glazed over, fantasizing the seventy-two virgins awaiting him for his rigthteousness.However, the scene of Alberto and Ernesto struggling with the motorcycle in the snow is very good.",1,Travelogue into Tragedy,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",2005,4478,"['are', 'many', 'reasons', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'film', 'writing', 'acting', 'costuming', 'music', 'engaging', 'cinematography', 'Even', 'interviews', 'Chilean', 'indegenas', 'incorporated', 'screenplay', 'not', 'book', 'are', 'so', 'spontaneous', 'be', 'convincing', 'could', 'even', 'give', 'stars', 'historical', 'fiction', 'portions', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'having', 'been', 'added', 'replacing', 'author', 'diary', 'experiences.That', 'said', 'problem', 'film', 'absent', 'truth', 'Not', 'much', 'research', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'required', 'truthfully', 'establish', 'mental', 'condition', 'protagonist', 'time', 'life', 'education', 'was', 'troubled', 'personality', 'sexual', 'identity', 'ambiguous', 'Symptomatic', 'protean', 'divisions', 'was', 'wore', 'days', 'same', 'soiled', 'shirt', 'day', 'day', 'what', 'called', 'shirt', 'week', 'offensive', 'trademark', 'body', 'disenchanting', 'friends', 'especially', 'colleague', 'students', 'medical', 'school.Given', 'mother', '22', 'years', 'narcissism', 'control', 'Ernesto', 'father', 'flamboyant', 'philandering', 'failure', 'odd', 'business', 'ventures', 'so', 'weak', 'was', 'wiring', 'mental', 'grid', 'integrate', 'personality', 'mother', 'control', 'was', 'such', 'failure', 'Miramar', 'receive', 'hand', 'Chichina', 'high', 'school-aged', 'girl', 'was', 'self-fulfilling', 'prophecy', 'heightened', 'stink', 'loss', 'desired', 'manipulated', 'mother', 'purposefully', 'approving', 'adolescent', 'behavior', 'not', 'bathing', 'giddy', 'teeny-bopper', 'will', 'not', 'love', 'boy', 'who', 'purpose', 'Chichina', 'other', 'such', 'neurotic', 'self-obsessive', 'madre', 'will', 'benefit', 'being', 'wed', 'one', 'mother.The', 'film', 'poignant', 'however', 'even', 'fiction', 'know', 'Ernesto', 'mental', 'decline', 'course', 'remaining', 'few', 'years', 'sad', 'reflect', 'adolescent', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'experiencing', 'last', 'rational', 'days', 'life', 'not', 'ten', 'years', 'will', 'pass', 'catalogue', 'neuroses', 'grows', 'such', 'weight', 'psychotic', 'rage', 'battle', 'license', 'kill', 'most', 'basic', 'psychological', 'identifiers', 'name', 'displaced', 'nickname', 'not', 'even', 'diminutive', 'meaningless', 'jibe', 'Argentine', 'vocal', 'tic', ""'che"", 'conferred', 'equally', 'sexually', 'ambiguous', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'Fidel', 'mother', 'new', 'controller', 'grateful', 'Che', 'love', 'poetry', 'Fidel.After', 'revolution', 'only', 'mental', 'mechanism', 'may', 'justify', 'recent', 'homicidal', 'euphoria', 'war', 'accept', 'revel', 'first', 'position', 'director', 'judge', 'political', 'revenge', 'court', 'La', 'Cabana', 'Being', 'entrusted', 'task', 'new', 'mother', 'approbation', 'battered', 'subservient', 'ego', 'needs', 'convince', 'really', 'good', 'dog', 'permission', 'execute', 'so', 'many', 'thousands', 'political', 'prisoners', 'create', 'very', 'own', 'boys', 'club', 'same', 'roof', 'How', 'thin', 'mental', 'membrane', 'lay', 'desires', 'death', 'sex', 'little', 'later', 'short', 'life', 'succession', 'administrative', 'disasters', 'several', 'exiles', 'Fidel', 'again', 'warfare', 'Africa', 'psychological', 'immobilization', 'becoming', 'unacceptable', 'even', 'appearance', 'shaving', 'head', 'new', 'persona', 'displacing', 'old', 'frustrated', 'Che', 'yet', 'new', 'name', 'natural', 'mother', 'now', 'dead', 'replacement', 'mother', 'having', 'become', 'reticent', 'Ernesto', 'name', 'must', 'now', 'become', 'own', 'mother', 'final', 'failure.But', 'will', 'have', 'one', 'terminal', 'success', 'mothers', 'must', 'be', 'punished', 'poorly', 'revolution', 'Bolivia', 'advertizing', 'location', 'successful', 'something', 'total', 'immolation', 'self-disintegration', 'suicide', 'hands', 'others.If', 'film', 'truth', 'further', 'consideration', 'who', 'Ernesto', 'was', 'bike', 'ride', 'what', 'boy', 'would', 'become', 'then', 'need', 'make', 'first', 'series', 'glamorizing', 'adolescence', 'terrorists', 'dictators', 'making', 'Little', 'Plowboy', 'Who', 'Whistled', ""O'er"", 'Lea', 'Say', 'boyhood', 'Hitler', 'strolling', 'Alps', 'innocently', 'day-dreaming', 'day', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded', 'own', 'chalet', 'Berchtesgarden', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'eyes', 'glazed', 'fantasizing', 'seventy-two', 'virgins', 'awaiting', 'rigthteousness.However', 'scene', 'Alberto', 'Ernesto', 'struggling', 'motorcycle', 'snow', 'very', 'good']",N/A

First of all, the two men making the road trip ride on a motorcycle instead of taking a car.  Second, the trip is through South America in the 1950s.  And third, a bunch of wild, American college students aren't the ones venturing out; it's Alberto Granado and his friend, Che Guevara.""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is based on Che's journals of the same name-journals which described the road trip he took at only 23, a semester before graduating from medical school.The film version of ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is an excellent adaptation of Che's memoir, showing the leader of the Cuban revolution in a light with which most people are unfamiliar.  When we think of famous people of the past, it's easy to only think of the time while they were famous.  So in ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" it's interesting to see Che as a young man-a man who hadn't yet defined his ideologies.  His ideologies didn't become well-defined until after his trip through South America, (which the film doesn't cover, but I'm guessing will be the focus of Steven Soderbergh's upcoming Che project), but I could see him thinking and changing as he traveled across the continent.""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is thankfully subtle, showing Che not as an inflated hero, but as a likable human being.  When Che (Gael Garcia Bernal) leaves home with his friend Alberto (Rodrigo De la Serna), he hopes to learn a lot about the world and himself, but, like any regular person, he also hopes to have a good time.  And even though the trip is difficult, he does manage to have fun.  But his fun isn't what sticks with him the most; it's the poverty he sees.Throughout his journey, Che is astounded by the inequities of the world; he is disheartened that he can comfortably attend medical school while an equally worthy person in Chile or Peru can't find a good job.

629066,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JNCZ,Joseph Haschka,"[6, 10]","THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES has an Argentine medical student and his biochemist pal on a backpacking road trip. There'd be nothing remarkable about the story except that it's ostensibly true and the student eventually matured into Che Guevara, that revolutionary whose memory is revered by dissidents and the politically correct everywhere.Gael Garcia Bernal is Ernesto Guevara, who, with one year of med school remaining, is off with Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) on a 12,000+ kilometer lark through Argentina, Chile, Peru and points north on the latter's decrepit motorcycle in search of adventure, self discovery, and babes. As the bike gives up it's ghost at about the film's midpoint, the title THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES may be misleading. But, you get the picture. In any case, whether they're walking or riding, Granado is the bon vivant, while Guevara is the serious, upper middle class, young man, whose conscience is troubled by the amount of social stratification and capitalist oppression of the masses that he observes along the way.  By the film's conclusion, Ernesto is beginning to evolve into the ""Che"" that ultimately entered history as Fidel Castro's lieutenant in the Cuban Revolution.The film is notable for the lush scenery and spectacular locations of South America, and which include the Incan ruins of Machu Picchu and a riverside leper colony, where the boys donate their volunteer services. Machu Picchu was real; I can't vouch for the authenticity of the leprosarium. (Indeed, I was impressed with the apparent authenticity of the lepers' afflictions. Were they actually people stricken with Mycobacterium leprae, or just actors with strategically applied body make-up?) The movie also has it's humorous moments, especially during the first half when our heroes stuttering progression across the landscape comprises a series of road mishaps on the motorcycle. Here, that's what constitutes male bonding.During the ending credits, Guevara's death is attributed to the evil Central Intelligence Agency, which had Che murdered when he sought to export The Glorious Revolution to the South American mainland. Oooh, there's the Machiavellian CIA, again! However, since Che's efforts helped make Cuba into a Third World armpit for these past five decades, perhaps the American taxpayer, since unable to buy his Havanas at the corner cigar shop, got his money's worth in the end.I would've liked THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES more without the political message that's been long since discredited. But, that's just me, an unreconstructed Cold War Neanderthal.

629068,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00005JNCZ,J R Zullo,"[6, 9]","""The motorcycle diaries"" is Walter Salles' (from ""Central station"" and ""Behind the sun"") latest movie. This time the brazilian director manages a multi-country latin american crew and actors, in a film that tells the story of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara de la Serna, in his first and, maybe, most important revolution: the one that took place inside himself.""The motorcycle diaries"", based on the homonimous book by Guevara, is a first person account of the trip two argentinian friends took early in their lives, throughout the South American continent, beginning in Buenos Aires and ending in Venezuela. One of those friends was the young Guevara (not yet ""Che""), one year before completing his medicine college. The other one is Alberto Granado, pharmaceutic, a little older, a funny, easy-going bon-vivant. We can describe them as a restless pair, but even they don't know what their restless is about. All they know is that this trip will be utterly important in their lives, and they couldn't be more correct. In Chile, they get to know the terrible conditions of the copper miners; in Peru, they work in a leprosary. All this among many other adventurous, funny and memorable moments.To me, the most interesting fact in the movie is that it shows the early life of Che Guevara. I was expecting a movie about political ideologies and revolutions, and got a subtle, beautiful, emotional movie, feelings that no politics could ever arise in myself. Mexican Gael Garcia Bernal and argentinian Rodrigo de la Serna are almost perfect in their roles. It feels they have known each other for years. It's impossible for the viewer to stand indifferent to what they do on screen.There are two other things that come to mind as good features in ""The motorcycle diaries"". First, the fantastic cinematography. From the rural argentininan landscape, through the desertic mining fields of Chile, through Macchu-Pichu, to the Peruvian Amazon, this is certainly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. And by that I don't mean endless and meaningless landscape or sunset shots. Every frame on the movie has the purpose to bring the viewers closer to the characters, making us climb abord with them on their motorcycle, or in a boat, or even on foot through the cold desert's night. The second thing is Walters Salles' direction. As this is a movie based on real events, Salles' experience with documentaries comes really at hand. It's impossible not to imagine this movie as real, authentic, in a powerful way.This is a movie that must be watched, since words will not come close to what it really is.Grade 9.4/10",5,A movie in a higher level,1086652800,"06 8, 2004",2004,2606,"['motorcycle', 'diaries', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'Central', 'station', 'sun', 'latest', 'movie', 'time', 'brazilian', 'director', 'multi-country', 'latin', 'american', 'crew', 'actors', 'film', 'story', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'first', 'maybe', 'most', 'important', 'revolution', 'one', 'took', 'place', 'motorcycle', 'diaries', 'based', 'homonimous', 'book', 'Guevara', 'first', 'person', 'account', 'trip', 'two', 'argentinian', 'friends', 'took', 'early', 'lives', 'South', 'American', 'continent', 'beginning', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'ending', 'Venezuela', 'One', 'friends', 'was', 'young', 'Guevara', 'not', 'yet', 'Che', 'one', 'year', 'completing', 'medicine', 'college', 'other', 'one', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'pharmaceutic', 'little', 'older', 'funny', 'easy-going', 'bon-vivant', 'can', 'describe', 'restless', 'pair', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'restless', 'know', 'trip', 'will', 'be', 'utterly', 'important', 'lives', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'correct', 'Chile', 'get', 'know', 'terrible', 'conditions', 'copper', 'miners', 'Peru', 'work', 'leprosary', 'many', 'other', 'adventurous', 'funny', 'memorable', 'moments.To', 'most', 'interesting', 'fact', 'movie', 'early', 'life', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'was', 'expecting', 'movie', 'political', 'ideologies', 'revolutions', 'got', 'subtle', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'movie', 'feelings', 'politics', 'could', 'ever', 'arise', 'Mexican', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'argentinian', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'are', 'almost', 'perfect', 'roles', 'have', 'known', 'other', 'years', 'impossible', 'viewer', 'stand', 'indifferent', 'what', 'do', 'screen.There', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'things', 'come', 'mind', 'good', 'features', 'motorcycle', 'diaries', 'First', 'fantastic', 'cinematography', 'rural', 'argentininan', 'landscape', 'desertic', 'mining', 'fields', 'Chile', 'Macchu-Pichu', 'Peruvian', 'Amazon', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'endless', 'meaningless', 'landscape', 'sunset', 'shots', 'frame', 'movie', 'purpose', 'bring', 'viewers', 'closer', 'characters', 'making', 'climb', 'abord', 'motorcycle', 'boat', 'even', 'foot', 'cold', 'desert', 'night', 'second', 'thing', 'Walters', 'Salles', 'direction', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'Salles', 'experience', 'documentaries', 'really', 'hand', 'impossible', 'not', 'imagine', 'movie', 'real', 'authentic', 'powerful', 'way.This', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'words', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'what', 'really', 'is.Grade', '9.4/10']",N/A

These concepts are seldom taught in academic settings besides spiritual and philosophical classes.  A person's beliefs and moral values illustrate the persona of an individual, and it is often how people connect to one another.  Motorcycle Diaries offers some insights to how these beliefs and morals might have been acquired on a long journey through the South American continent.The 23-year old Ernesto Guevara de la Serna (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal ) who has gained the nickname El Fuser and later became renowned through the name Che plans a long motorcycle trip with his friend Alberto Granado (Rodrigo De la Serna).  The trip is expected to bring them to Venezuela for Alberto's 30th birthday, and on the journey they anticipate meeting several beautiful women to sway.  The two friends do not look at life too seriously, as they expect this journey to become a fantasy come true where they get to do things they have dreamed of for years.  When the day comes they pack up on the ""Mighty One"", a leaky motorcycle from 1938 that is to bring them to their destination.Carelessly Fuser and Alberto begin their dream trip while almost getting into an accident before they leave the block where Fuser's family lives.  Not thinking of it too much of it the two young men continue their adventure into uncharted territory.  There are several small incidents where they fall with the motorcycle, which could have had dire consequences.  These moments offer a strong opportunity to look into how these two young men observe the world, as it gives some insights to the securities and comforts in which they were brought up.  It also gives a perspective on how ignorant these two young men truly are about the world, despite having advanced degrees or almost finished doctoral degrees.  Furthermore, the name of the motorcycle, the Might One, offers a perceptive analogy with some irony as it gives more detailed depictions of how reckless and absent minded they are in regards to their journey.  Their preconceived notions and dreams have also distorted their perception on how they approach their long journey.The first stop on the long journey is a visit to Fuser's girlfriend, Chichina (Mia Maestro), who lives in an idyllic Alp mansion that seems to be completely out of place.  Even Alberto comments on the mansion's appearance.  However, this first stop visualizes the two friend's dreamy vision of the venture.  This visit to Chichina offers a deeper development of Fuser's personality, which depicts a righteously romantic character.  When they leave it is hard on both Chichina and Fuser, but the trip is something he has to do for himself.Slowly the two traveling companions begin their true journey through the harsh, yet beautiful terrain of Patagonia while ascending the southern portion of the Andes.  They face adversity through weather and wind, hunger, and mechanical breakdown, but they persist on without the idea of ever quitting. Fuser has 15 dollars in his pocket that he received from Chichina, but he does not intend to use it.  Lividly Alberto expresses that the money could help them get out of trouble, but Fuser remains firm on not using the money.The film's turning point arrives when Fuser receives a letter from Chichina, which evidently causes Fuser to feel emotional pain.  The sound in the following scenes brings the audience a thundering murmur, as if Fuser is about to explode.  The scene that shows an elevator going down until the screen turns black visualizes Fuser's emotional state.  This is followed by Fuser sitting in complete silence on a beach by the Pacific Ocean and while in deep contemplation he rereads the letter.  All Alfredo can do is sit and watch his friend, as even his talkative nature does not know how to approach the situation.  When Fuser breaks the silence he behaves more seriously, as if his previous idealistic perception had been shattered and he had been forced to rethink his approach to the world.The rest of the journey slows down as Fuser begins to take his time to get to know the people and the land through which he is traveling.  Through the people Fuser and Alberto begin to see the injustice in the world-something they never could have imagined, as it is not written in the books they have read.  It seems as if they begin to question the foundation upon which they have been brought up, and begin to criticize rules and regulations.Walter Salles who also directed the critically acclaimed Behind the Sun (2001) makes Motorcycle Diaries, which depicts Che Guevara before the years when he led the coup in Cuba.  The film does not glorify Che's political achievements as a communistic revolutionary, but depicts how he might have acquired his values and ideas that made him the man he later became.  This is what makes the film accessible for all viewers, as it is not a political film. It is a film that depicts how a man might have changed, and acquired wisdom to make the decisions he made later in life. In essence, it is a film about learning.The cinematography that Salles employs through cinematographer Eric Gautier is marvelous.  An example is the way camera is used during movement, which brings the audience a jerky and bumpy experience, which brings the film a more authentic feel in the same way as a private home video filmed with a handheld camera.  There are also many other scenes that elevate the cinematic experience, for instance, the many close ups of Alberto and Che's faces.  Those unaware should know that this film is based on a true story; however, it does not point this out in the beginning as most films based on reality do.  This is a clever way of making the film even more enjoyable, which in the end will offer much for the viewers to contemplate through the many hardships that Che and Alberto face.",5,Che's Journey to

629076,A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ,B00005JNCZ,Larry Scantlebury,"[5, 16]","OK. It's a good movie. Worth seeing. The photography is fantastic and the transition between affluent fun to social conscience is handled nicely and nearly seamlessly.Americans, North Americans, probably make the better films. This is not necessarily a good thing. It's just the way it is. We have more highly trained actors, more equipment, more advanced technology and let's face it, more money. So seeing the 'best foreign film(s) of the year' has an element of 'how ARE the Joneses doing?'And in that regard, this film comes out well. $25.00 date night film? Possibly not. Without the adulation of a lot of cleavage and somber men at the Oscars? Possibly not.Garcia Bernal does a great job as Ernesto Guevara, and although less sexy or sensual I thought Rodrigo de la Serna was the better actor as Che's compatriot travelling in South America on the last fling before responsibility, de la Serna as a biochemist and Che in medicine.Their trip through South America in 1952 does sow the (at least) recognition of social injustice and the frequent and painful victory of money and greed over humanity. It seems tasteless to point out that historically this concept, inhumanity to their fellows by the ruling class, is about 6000 years old. Ain't nothing new here, Che.The problem that arises for us as viewers (you still need viewers to make it successful unless you're into that ""tree falling"" philosophy) is that this tends to canonize Che. If so, the quality of the movie should be sufficient to withstand the fact that a lot of people aren't going to sit around and accept that view. They're not going to buy into it.The movie does seem to encourage that and giving it credit, witstand it. Perhaps this is not so for those that see Che as a romantic Don Quixote reflected in their reaction to those who would point out that Che became a violent revolutionary, involved in the imprisonment of thousands and the death of at least hundreds. This is part of his life, or the life that he embraced, and critics need to feel a willingness to point that out in the absence of villification. It is a valid point.One reviwer mentions that Che had a choice too, he could have become Ghandi. He chose Trotsky. That's his decision and it runs afoul of what we have formulated as human social justice for the above mentioned 6000 years.If you make a movie about Mother Teresa, you may not like her because she's a woman. You may not like her because she's a Christian. But you can't say she believes in the violent overthrow of the governmemt. With Che, it's a fair shot.Another fair point for us, the Norte Americanos, is that we are sometimes bigoted in our views. And the heavy handedness in which we pool all of South America, Central America, Mexico and Puerto Rico into the ""latino"" umbrella, has painful recollections of life in the United States pre-Civil Rights Act of 1964, which in and of itself had it's own shortcomings. And we did that with this competent film as well. Perhaps serving up Antonio Banderas and Carlos Santana at the Oscars as ""latinos"" was another unintended racial slight. Yet Jorge Drexler coming up on stage to accept the award for Best Music and not making a tedious political speech (it's the Oscars, not the Party's National Convention) but rather singing his song was pretty good, wasn't it? 4 stars.

629078,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JNCZ,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 4]","Brazilian director Walter Salles Jr. has done a good job of elevating Brazilian cinema to the international audience.  In an era where DVD distribution is making foreign language films more accessible and giving them a broader audience, his timing is perfect.  This year his first American feature ""Dark Water"" starring Jennifer Connelly was released.  With ""Central Station,"" ""Foreign Land,"" & ""Exposure,"" he's created an important body of work.  ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" does not strike me as intended to be a docu-drama, even though it is based on real-life people.  Dealing with the younger parts of the characters' lives, we see a more carefree existence set against the gorgeous backdrop of South America in Argentina, Chile, Peru & Venezuela.The film did receive its share of recognition.  The British academy awards recognized the quality of the film by nominating it for Best Picture and its stars for Best Actor & Best Supporting Actor.  The British academy did vote it as Best Foreign Language film.  I read it won the Oscar for best song, although I confess I can't hum a few bars of that tune. Jose Rivera's screenplay was nominated for Oscar's Best Adapted Screenplay.  It was produced by Robert Redford.As Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, Gael Garcia Bernal portrays him as a serious and thoughtful young medical doctor.  Quite different than the cross-dresser he played in ""Bad Education,"" Bernal gives one of the scariest portrayals of an asthma attack I've ever seen!  ""Fuser,"" as he's nicknamed, is not a saint, as the scene where he attempts to seduce the wife of a man who is repairing his motorcycle for free attests.  However, he does become increasingly serious as he sees the plight of the miners, their treatment by the mining companies, and eventually works in a leper colony where even the Christian missionaries seem somewhat inhospitable.  His buddy Alberto Granado is the perfect foil, not as handsome and more portly, he swaggers with a delightful flare throughout this, his first film performance.  I was impressed in the DVD extras how Mexican actor Bernal did ""pray"" that Guevara would find his portrayal of his life acceptable.  The film is not a fast-paced film, but moves methodically and certainly, allowing the camera to linger on the faces of the people and for the care in their faces to sink in.  I thought it was a very good cinematic piece that provoked thought.  Sometimes if we seek to understand others, even if we don't approve of their decisions, it can help us to place them in the context of how they live.

629079,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00005JNCZ,Linda Linguvic,"[2, 3]","This 2004 film tells the story of the motorcycle trip Ernesto Guevara de la Sena and his friend Alberto Granado took in 1952 from Argentina to Peru.  Ernesto was a medical student and Alberto was a biochemist and they were privileged middle class Argentineans. Supposedly, that trip changed their politics forever, and Ernesto later became the revolutionary Che Guevara, the inspirational hero of a whole generation.  But this film is not about those later politics although this particularly trip was instrumental in raising the young mens' consciousness about the hardships and exploitation of South America's poor.The film is in Spanish with Gael Garcia Benal cast as the young Ernesto and Rodrigo De La Serna cast as Alberto.  Both are good in their roles although the screenplay itself lacks depth.  Mostly, it plays like a travelogue in which the two young men are always the observers.  And, in spite of a few short paragraphs which were so over-the-top with righteous indignation and political fervor that I actually found myself giggling, their adventures consisted mostly of having their motorcycle break down and meeting some native people. And then there were some overly-romanticized scenes in a leper colony.In real life, both of these young men wrote diaries and these diaries have been published and re-published many times.  I understand that sometimes their narratives conflicted.  And, as many of their adventures were described in a sketchy manner, it was the screenwriters who fleshed out this plot.  It might not have been such an interesting story though if Che Guevara didn't later become famous.  Mostly, it played like a coming-of-age story.Personally, I like to read about travels to places I know I'll never see.  That's why I had such hope for this film.  I had even read a book entitled ""Chasing Che"" by Patrick Symmes, who personally followed the trail taken by Guevara and Granado about fifty years later.  I loved that book and hoped to discover in this film that combination of adventure and discomfort that created a turning place in their lives.  Sadly, the film did not deliver this for me.I think The Motorcycle Diaries is a film that tried hard (actually a little too hard) to recapture the spirit of the open road and add a little political correctness at the same time.  But the adventures seemed disjointed and the injustices they witnessed were lightweight compared to other films which deal with the same issues.

Although I work in the ""capitalistic"" financial services sector and am a few years shy of 60, I was, and continue to be, a great admirer of Che Guevara.This movie captures a 10,000 km journey throughout South America that a young, footloose 23 year old Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara embarked on with his good friend, Alberto Granada, in 1952. On countless occasions, the film provides the viewer with some breathtaking images of South America as seen through the eyes of a couple of guys on the back of a motorcycle - ""The Mighty One"". My god - what a beautiful continent.Along the way, a very subtle change takes place within Che. The Che depicted in this film give us a view of a young man, calm and shy, a bad dancer, asthmatic, but above all close to his fellow man and sensitive to the injustices that he discovers along the roads. In one poignant moment, Ernesto tells his mother that he spent one cold night next to a young destitute couple, but that this night brought him closer to the human race. Moreover, he offers them the 15 dollars that his girlfriend had entrusted to him to buy a bathing suit. At Machu Pichu, a young Che wonders how a revolution could happen without guns. He wonders how the local Indians could be driven off the lands that they faithfully worked. This beuatifully crafted film gives the viewer a glimpse into the mind of the young Che's political and philosophical awakening as he comes into direct contact with the generous, friendly working-class men and women whom he would later champion as a communist revolutionary.But above all, I found the closing shot of a now-old Alberto Granada watching a plane depart particularily poignant. He was a delightful and personable friend to Ernesto and loyal to a fault. I'm not at all surprised that Commandante Che Guevara reached out to him following the successful overthrow of Batista during the Cuban revolution and a half a century later, Granada successfully founded a medical clinic to treat his adopted countryjmen in Cuba.As a Canadian, perhaps we have a less myopic view of Che Guevara/ Cuba. We don't necessarily see him only through a narrow prism as some ""blood thirsty marxist revolutionary"".""After Guevara's death, Jean-Paul Sartre would declare him to be ""not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age"" and the ""era's most perfect man"" . Sartre would also compliment Che Guevara by professing that ""he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel""This film gives us a glimpse of the man that Sartre talked about.Regardless of your political views, this is a wonderful film that I would highly recommend.",5,A 20th Century Iconic Figure In The Making,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,2807,"['enjoyed', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'many', 'many', 'levels.Che', 'Guevara', 'once', 'said', 'true', 'revolutionary', 'guided', 'great', 'feelings', 'love', 'work', 'capitalistic', 'financial', 'services', 'sector', 'am', 'few', 'years', 'shy', '60', 'was', 'continue', 'be', 'great', 'admirer', 'Che', 'Guevara.This', 'movie', '10,000', 'km', 'journey', 'South', 'America', 'young', 'footloose', '23', 'year', 'old', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'embarked', 'good', 'friend', 'Alberto', 'Granada', '1952', 'countless', 'occasions', 'film', 'viewer', 'breathtaking', 'images', 'South', 'America', 'seen', 'eyes', 'couple', 'guys', 'back', 'motorcycle', 'Mighty', 'One', 'god', 'what', 'beautiful', 'continent.Along', 'way', 'very', 'subtle', 'change', 'place', 'Che', 'Che', 'depicted', 'film', 'give', 'view', 'young', 'man', 'calm', 'shy', 'bad', 'dancer', 'asthmatic', 'close', 'fellow', 'man', 'sensitive', 'injustices', 'roads', 'one', 'poignant', 'moment', 'Ernesto', 'mother', 'spent', 'one', 'cold', 'night', 'young', 'destitute', 'couple', 'night', 'brought', 'closer', 'human', 'race', 'Moreover', '15', 'dollars', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'entrusted', 'buy', 'bathing', 'suit', 'Machu', 'Pichu', 'young', 'Che', 'how', 'revolution', 'could', 'happen', 'guns', 'how', 'local', 'Indians', 'could', 'be', 'driven', 'off', 'lands', 'faithfully', 'worked', 'beuatifully', 'crafted', 'film', 'viewer', 'glimpse', 'mind', 'young', 'Che', 'political', 'philosophical', 'awakening', 'direct', 'contact', 'generous', 'friendly', 'working-class', 'men', 'women', 'whom', 'would', 'later', 'champion', 'communist', 'revolutionary.But', 'found', 'closing', 'shot', 'now-old', 'Alberto', 'Granada', 'watching', 'plane', 'depart', 'particularily', 'poignant', 'was', 'delightful', 'personable', 'friend', 'Ernesto', 'loyal', 'fault', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'Commandante', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'reached', 'out', 'following', 'successful', 'overthrow', 'Batista', 'Cuban', 'revolution', 'half', 'century', 'later', 'Granada', 'successfully', 'founded', 'medical', 'clinic', 'treat', 'adopted', 'countryjmen', 'Cuba.As', 'Canadian', 'perhaps', 'have', 'less', 'myopic', 'view', 'Che', 'Guevara/', 'Cuba', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'see', 'only', 'narrow', 'prism', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'marxist', 'revolutionary', 'Guevara', 'death', 'Jean-Paul', 'Sartre', 'would', 'declare', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'intellectual', 'also', 'most', 'complete', 'human', 'being', 'age', 'era', 'most', 'perfect', 'man', 'Sartre', 'would', 'also', 'compliment', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'professing', 'lived', 'words', 'spoke', 'own', 'actions', 'story', 'story', 'world', 'ran', 'parallel', 'film', 'glimpse', 'man', 'Sartre', 'talked', 'about.Regardless', 'political', 'views', 'wonderful', 'film', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[5, 8]","This movie tells us the story of two young men, and the adventure that would change the way they saw the world. The travellers, medical student Ernesto Guevara and biochemist Alberto Granado, decide to start a journey across South America. In January 1952 they begin their quest in an old motorcycle, without too much money but eager to visit new countries in order to learn more about South America and its inhabitants. As minutes go by, you will start to feel part of their journey, and absorb the different scenes, events and people that end up making an indelible impression on them.Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal plays a believable Ernesto Guevara, the person that would later be known as ""Che"". Rodrigo de la Serna is just as convincing as Alberto Granado, and he makes us laugh from time to time with his antics. However, the main characters aren't them, but the people they encounter in their travels, and that add up to represent people of all South America who suffered from differents kinds of injustice. We aren't shown the people that were well-off, although we get a glimpse of their lives when Ernesto visits his girlfriend before he starts his journey. Rather, we are faced with the problems of those who lived in less fortunate circumstances, for example aborigines that had been expelled of their lands, or poor people that couldn't find a job and had to travel looking for one. The spectator is also shown people who helped those in need, for example in the hospital for leprosy patients that Ernesto and Alberto visited with the purpose of learning more about the disease...""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is based on the two books that Guevara and Granados wrote about their travel: ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" by Guevara and ""With Che Through Latin America"" by Alberto Granado. It is highly likely that those books helped Brazilian director Walter Salles to make a film that sounds so true, but he obviously also contributed, and a lot, to make a film that is far from the banal, and that appeals to those who watch it. I think that it is also worthwhile to point out that the director avoided any kind of ideological preaching, something that could have been tiresome. Salles stresses, instead, that the journey was an occasion for self-discovery...All in all, I think that you won't regret watching ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". It isn't an eulogy about ""Che"" Guevara but rather a film that gives us the chance of learning what kind of experiences molded the way in which he viewed things.

Of course, when a movie like Y Tu Mama Tambien or the deeply moving Motorcycle Diaries comes along, you realize he's a star even in the U.S. for good reason. In Diaries, Bernal portrays a young pre-revolutionary Che Guevara on a life-changing roadtrip around South America with the restrained ease of a pro. Accompanied by his med school buddy, Alberto (Rodrigo de la Serna, charming in his first big role), they experience the poverty and injustice in their continent that later sows the seeds for the actions that made Che famous. Yeah, all the 'road-trip-movie' ingredients are here, but director Walter Salles manages to layer the story with a deeper theme that makes it all cohesive: a road trip of grandiose notions and goals is reduced to the need to help humanity in its most direct form. Yes, both main characters (Che, especially) suffer from a biopic-typical tidying up of personality (i.e. - these guys are about as flawed as Mother Teresa), but with Gustava Santaolalla's atmospheric guitar music and Eric Gautier's warm cinematography, Diaries and all its flaws become a satisfying cinematic experience that swells to a rewarding, if somewhat trite, finale. The message of Diaries is powerful, though, no matter how schmaltzy it may be. As the tagline goes, ""Let the world change you...and you can change the world."" Sounds good to me.

And while we now know Che Guevara as a revolutionary and a comrade of Fidel Castro's, ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" ends well before this phase of Che's life.As it is, this movie is quite beautiful to behold but unfortunately for those of us who know the whole (or even parts of the) story of Che's move from vagabond, /medical student/Doctor to a Communist revolutionary, responsible for many deaths, can only be taken aback at the portrayal of Che as a sort of latter-day combination Mother Teresa,Lenin and suburban teenager. (The screen literally lights up though, when the luminous Bernal smiles)While it is true that Guevara and Granado set out on this trip without a care in the world except a hunger to see what is ""out there,"" I have to question the motives of the film maker in presenting this true-to-a-point yet evasive view of Che and all he was to become.With all that said, the film is beautifully and artfully shot by cinematographer Eric Gautier and the mise en scene is cluttered with the beauty that is South America. The duo's bumpy journey by raft, ferry but mostly on foot is characterized by humor, arguing and a deep recognition of how much better they have it than most of the people with whom they come in contact.There are many things that I love about ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" Bernal and de la Serna for two, but nonetheless I have a lingering bad taste in my mouth about the ritual cleansing of a man who on the one hand said that ""the true revolutionary is guided by love"" but in reality was more Ivan the Terrible than St Francis.",4,The Cleansing,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,1973,"['come', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'looking', 'new', 'Millennium', 'easy', 'living/', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'cycle', 'road', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'more', 'Gulliver', 'Travels', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'film', 'based', 'diaries', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'kept', 'trip', 'South', 'America', 'accompanied', 'friend', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'Rodrigo', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'now', 'know', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'revolutionary', 'comrade', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'well', 'phase', 'Che', 'life.As', 'movie', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'behold', 'unfortunately', 'who', 'know', 'whole', 'even', 'parts', 'story', 'Che', 'move', 'vagabond', '/medical', 'student/Doctor', 'Communist', 'revolutionary', 'responsible', 'many', 'deaths', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'aback', 'portrayal', 'Che', 'sort', 'latter-day', 'combination', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'Lenin', 'suburban', 'teenager', 'screen', 'literally', 'up', 'though', 'when', 'luminous', 'Bernal', 'smiles', 'true', 'Guevara', 'Granado', 'set', 'out', 'trip', 'care', 'world', 'hunger', 'see', 'what', 'there', 'have', 'question', 'motives', 'film', 'maker', 'presenting', 'true-to-a-point', 'yet', 'evasive', 'view', 'Che', 'was', 'become.With', 'said', 'film', 'beautifully', 'artfully', 'shot', 'cinematographer', 'Eric', 'Gautier', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'cluttered', 'beauty', 'South', 'America', 'duo', 'bumpy', 'journey', 'raft', 'ferry', 'mostly', 'foot', 'characterized', 'humor', 'arguing', 'deep', 'recognition', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'most', 'people', 'whom', 'come', 'contact.There', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'love', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'Bernal', 'de', 'la', 'Serna', 'two', 'nonetheless', 'have', 'lingering', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'ritual', 'cleansing', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'hand', 'said', 'true', 'revolutionary', 'guided', 'love', 'reality', 'was', 'more', 'Ivan', 'Terrible', 'St', 'Francis']",N/A

The scenery is outstanding, the actors are good, the story is interesting, etc.  So what's the problem?The issue is that we are watching a film that puts a person who did horrible things into an extremely positive light.  Che Gueverra is shown to be a Christlike figure in this film.  He never does anything wrong and he has an affinity to take care of lepers.  We see him hurt for the poor people he encounters on his journey and we see him try to help them.  The actor playing Che has a lot of charisma and the viewer can't help but pull for him.What the film doesn't show are the crimes against humanity and the ultimate outcome of his efforts to ""help"" others.  Was he a bad person, or a saint at heart like the film shows?  Well, I can't look into his heart, but I can say that his actions brought a lot of pain and oppression on innocents.  Why then, do we celebrate his life with a film like this?I was able to enjoy the film at face value, imagining that it was just some fictional account.  And by that standard this is a 5 star film up until the last scene, where the viewer is told that Che was ""murdered under the approval of the CIA"".

I immediately ran out to look up whatever biography I could find on Ernesto Guevara, a larger-than-life character who is pathologically reviled by many in the United States even today, but abroad, is an icon on the scale of Mohammed Ali.How one perceives this historical figure is rooted in rich and poor, North vs. South, propertied versus the rest.  This is why so many Americans still loathe Guevara fourty years after his CIA-assisted death - he challenged Pax Americana.  The film only shows us the very young Guevara, uncertain, not particularly socially skilled, but hugely empathic.""Motorcycle Diaries"" dwells on the distinctions of class and poverty.  Why does the film show mineworkers tramping to the mines, Bolivian indiginous peasants, lepers?  Guevara isn't born to these conditions, he has to see and experience them in a very tactile way, even though he is born to privilege and his journey with his friend starts very much as a student lark -after all, he has to save his $15 in American money to buy his girlfriend a gift.The seductiveness of this lyrical film is that many reviews considered the movie to be apolitical.  The film is actually very political in its quiet way, in explaining, mostly with pictures and few words, the roots of Guevara's agrarian radicalism.  Guevara's political philosphy was not the grey-suited, ossified Soviet-speak (see some of my other reviews for examples) but a bottom-up, worms-eye approach to social change.  In the early years of the Cuban government, Guevara pushed for universal education, health care, and recognition for the lowest rungs of the social classes.  These did not spontaneously generate out of thin air; they were born, in part, by experiences including what is in this film.  Make no mistake - this movie is properly subversive with an ""S"", even though many people still think this is another harmless ""buddy"" movie.The film is laced with some four-letter subtitles but nothing a public middle-schooler hasn't heard.  My two teen age boys were captivated by the story.  (""You let your children see this movie?  you Communist!""  Well, what of it?

It really is beautifully photographed and captures the very essence of the young man's perspective on discovering the world.But at about the same time the boys' antique Norton blows its motor, so the film blows its narrative and veers off the dirt road and into a field of sacred cows. And as the last reel arrives it is clear there are sanctimonious cowpats aplenty: an honest, beautiful film becomes revisionist, people's poet-venerating nonsense.As we get to know him we discover Ernesto (pre Che, at this point known as ""Fuser"") isn't quite the lecherous med-student on Spring Break we were led to believe: quite the sensitive young thing, he cannot lie, even to hide painful truths; he discovers and rails against oppression; he has a Diana-like compassion for the sick, poor and helpless (no rubber gloves for him when he meets the lepers, thank you very much!); and, though badly asthmatic, he is prepared to swim across the Amazon in the dead of night simply to say farewell to his leper friends. No matter that it's never been so much as attempted before (and in real life would surely be suicidal), nor yet that there is a boat available, nor indeed that he could quite reasonably wait until the morning to bid farewell. As an unsympathetic Mother Superior watches glumly from the jetty, you might almost say Guevara walks on water.It's not exactly subtle, but those on the educated left will love it: our local cinema, nestled in quiet, affluent, but Guardian-reading East Finchley, greeted the end credits with spontaneous applause.Good grief.Olly Buxton",3,"Beautiful, likeable film degenerates into revisionist humbug",1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,1759,"['first', 'hour', 'film', 'magical', 'stunning', 'South', 'American', 'scenery', 'grandiose', 'cinematography', 'two', 'likeable', 'young', 'bon-vivants', 'set', 'epic', 'journey', 'really', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'very', 'essence', 'young', 'man', 'perspective', 'discovering', 'world.But', 'same', 'time', 'boys', 'antique', 'Norton', 'motor', 'film', 'narrative', 'veers', 'dirt', 'road', 'field', 'sacred', 'cows', 'last', 'reel', 'arrives', 'clear', 'are', 'sanctimonious', 'cowpats', 'aplenty', 'honest', 'beautiful', 'film', 'becomes', 'revisionist', 'people', 'poet-venerating', 'nonsense.As', 'get', 'know', 'discover', 'Ernesto', 'pre', 'Che', 'point', 'known', 'Fuser', ""n't"", 'quite', 'lecherous', 'med-student', 'Spring', 'Break', 'were', 'led', 'believe', 'quite', 'sensitive', 'young', 'thing', 'can', 'not', 'lie', 'even', 'hide', 'painful', 'truths', 'rails', 'oppression', 'Diana-like', 'compassion', 'sick', 'poor', 'helpless', 'rubber', 'gloves', 'when', 'lepers', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'though', 'badly', 'asthmatic', 'prepared', 'swim', 'Amazon', 'dead', 'night', 'simply', 'say', 'farewell', 'leper', 'friends', 'matter', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'attempted', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'surely', 'be', 'suicidal', 'yet', 'boat', 'available', 'indeed', 'could', 'quite', 'reasonably', 'wait', 'morning', 'bid', 'farewell', 'unsympathetic', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'watches', 'glumly', 'jetty', 'might', 'almost', 'say', 'Guevara', 'walks', 'water.It', 'not', 'exactly', 'subtle', 'educated', 'left', 'will', 'love', 'local', 'cinema', 'nestled', 'quiet', 'affluent', 'Guardian-reading', 'East', 'Finchley', 'greeted', 'end', 'spontaneous', 'applause.Good', 'grief.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

629100,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005JNCZ,Randy Keehn,"[5, 10]","I was somewhat apprehensive about this movie knowing that it's main character was a youthful ""Che"" Guevara.  I was concerned that the movie would try to get me to ""accept"" the path that Guevera's life took in later years.  This movie stated from the beginning that this was not it's intention by saying it was just the story of two friends on a trip together; nothing else.  Although the concluding remarks referred to his later years, the events portrayed in this movie could have inspired a positive change in the lives of many ""mainstream"" persons including ourselves.That aside, let me say that this is a GREAT movie.  It's one of those movies that makes you wonder if you've graded too many others with a ""5 star"" rating: there just aren't all that many out there as good as ""Motorcyle Diaries"".  The scope of the movie, the message it conveys and the many subtle ways it conveys it, the quality of the acting, the excellence of the directing, the supurb film editing, and, especially, the excellence of its' cinematography; all these come together in nothing short of a masterpiece.  It is the story of two young men who, in 1952, decide to take a motorcycle trip through South America.  They start in their home town of Buenos Aires, Argentina, head south then over to Chile and up eventually to Venezuela.  All of this on a shoe string budget.The beauty of the film is how Ernesto (Che) Guevara gradually becomes enlightened to the many injustices of the world through his own personal experiences.  It begins with a sense of knowing what it is like to be to be perceived as a member of the ""lower"" class.  We get enough of a background in the beginning to understand that Ernesto and his cousin are from at least the upper middle class.  Yet, in their beat up motorcycle and meager possessions, they are perchieved as less by their economic peers.  This treatment affects Ernesto and starts to open his eyes to other injustices.  In Chile, he and his cousin nearly meet their end at the hands of Chilean men who believe that they have insulted the honor of one ot their women.  The shouts of ""Let's get those Argentine @#%$**@#'s"" gave Ernesto a perception on the injustice of political borders seperating people of the same race and culture.  In the mining region of Northern Chile he is hit with a sense of the economic injustices of the haves vs the have nots.  This is exacerbated by the knowledge that the larger land owners have muscled out the smaller land owners pushing them into poverty and dependence.  Ultimately they come to their primary destination; a leper colony in Amazonian Peru.  Even there exists a hierarchy based on health and position as well as an unnecessary seperation based on prejudice and arrogance.  At the end of his journey, Ernesto recognizes that he is, indeed, a changed man.  We are changed as well.I let my defenses down midway through the movie when I realized that the screen writer had given us a reasonably accurate picture of life in South America in the 1950's.  Much of South America remains little changed from what was portrayed in ""Motorcycle Diaries"".  I lived in Chile one summer in 1969 and I can attest that poverty in South America makes poverty in North America appear to be life in the middle class.  I am not trying to demean our own impoverished in this coutry nor ignore their needs.  However, once you have seen the real poverty of Latin America, it touches you in a way that you cannot forget.  What Ernesto Guevara did with this knowledge is another story and the knowledge of those future actions need not interfere with enjoying this outstanding movie.The photography, as I mentioned, is outstanding.  From the Andes to the Amazon, we are treated to a view of a world we seldom see.  I was led to wonder just how great it would have been to see this film on the big screen.If I have any sort of objection to the movie, it is due to my overly practical nature.  These two men ran out of money early in their trip and had to make do finding help for food and lodging.  However, they always had gas in their engine even though they had no money and even though they traveled, by my estimation, many miles between gas stations.  Sorry, but that point seemed to always be in the back of my mind.The DVD I rented gave the English or Spanish option.  I chose the English option and got the sound in Spanish with English subtitles.  That didn't bother me but it may bother some.  It has been my experience that one tends to pay greater attention to a movie with subtitles because you don't let your eyes wander from the screen as much.  With Engligh language films you can go into the kitchen to grab something while listening to the dialogue or background music to cue you if things start to get intense.  With subtitles there is no time to do other things.  I don't think you'd want to be doing anything else while watching ""Motorcycle Diaries"".  This is a movie that commands all of our attention.",5,Roots of Revolution,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,4964,"['was', 'somewhat', 'apprehensive', 'movie', 'knowing', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'youthful', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'was', 'concerned', 'movie', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'accept', 'path', 'Guevera', 'life', 'took', 'later', 'years', 'movie', 'stated', 'beginning', 'was', 'not', 'intention', 'saying', 'was', 'just', 'story', 'two', 'friends', 'trip', 'together', 'nothing', 'else', 'concluding', 'remarks', 'referred', 'later', 'years', 'events', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'inspired', 'positive', 'change', 'lives', 'many', 'mainstream', 'persons', 'including', 'aside', 'let', 'say', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'one', 'movies', 'wonder', ""'ve"", 'graded', 'too', 'many', 'others', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'there', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'that', 'many', 'out', 'there', 'as', 'good', 'Motorcyle', 'Diaries', 'scope', 'movie', 'message', 'many', 'subtle', 'ways', 'quality', 'acting', 'excellence', 'directing', 'supurb', 'film', 'editing', 'especially', 'excellence', 'cinematography', 'come', 'together', 'nothing', 'short', 'masterpiece', 'story', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', '1952', 'decide', 'take', 'motorcycle', 'trip', 'South', 'America', 'start', 'home', 'town', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'Argentina', 'head', 'south', 'then', 'Chile', 'up', 'eventually', 'Venezuela', 'shoe', 'string', 'budget.The', 'beauty', 'film', 'how', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'gradually', 'enlightened', 'many', 'injustices', 'world', 'own', 'personal', 'experiences', 'sense', 'knowing', 'what', 'be', 'be', 'perceived', 'member', 'lower', 'class', 'get', 'enough', 'background', 'beginning', 'understand', 'Ernesto', 'cousin', 'are', 'least', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'beat', 'up', 'motorcycle', 'meager', 'possessions', 'are', 'perchieved', 'less', 'economic', 'peers', 'treatment', 'Ernesto', 'open', 'eyes', 'other', 'injustices', 'Chile', 'cousin', 'nearly', 'meet', 'end', 'hands', 'Chilean', 'men', 'who', 'believe', 'have', 'insulted', 'honor', 'one', 'women', 'shouts', 'Let', 'get', 'Argentine', '@', '%', '**', '@', 'gave', 'Ernesto', 'perception', 'injustice', 'political', 'borders', 'seperating', 'people', 'same', 'race', 'culture', 'mining', 'region', 'Northern', 'Chile', 'hit', 'sense', 'economic', 'injustices', 'haves', 'vs', 'have', 'nots', 'exacerbated', 'knowledge', 'larger', 'land', 'owners', 'have', 'muscled', 'out', 'smaller', 'land', 'owners', 'pushing', 'poverty', 'dependence', 'Ultimately', 'come', 'primary', 'destination', 'leper', 'colony', 'Amazonian', 'Peru', 'Even', 'hierarchy', 'based', 'health', 'position', 'as', 'well', 'unnecessary', 'seperation', 'based', 'prejudice', 'arrogance', 'end', 'journey', 'Ernesto', 'indeed', 'changed', 'man', 'are', 'changed', 'well.I', 'let', 'defenses', 'down', 'midway', 'movie', 'when', 'realized', 'screen', 'writer', 'had', 'given', 'reasonably', 'accurate', 'picture', 'life', 'South', 'America', '1950', 'Much', 'South', 'America', 'little', 'changed', 'what', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'lived', 'Chile', 'one', 'summer', '1969', 'can', 'attest', 'poverty', 'South', 'America', 'poverty', 'North', 'America', 'appear', 'be', 'life', 'middle', 'class', 'am', 'not', 'trying', 'demean', 'own', 'impoverished', 'coutry', 'ignore', 'needs', 'However', 'once', 'have', 'seen', 'real', 'poverty', 'Latin', 'America', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'What', 'Ernesto', 'Guevara', 'did', 'knowledge', 'story', 'knowledge', 'future', 'actions', 'need', 'not', 'interfere', 'enjoying', 'outstanding', 'movie.The', 'photography', 'mentioned', 'outstanding', 'Andes', 'Amazon', 'are', 'treated', 'view', 'world', 'seldom', 'see', 'was', 'led', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'film', 'big', 'screen.If', 'have', 'sort', 'objection', 'movie', 'due', 'overly', 'practical', 'nature', 'two', 'men', 'ran', 'money', 'early', 'trip', 'had', 'make', 'do', 'finding', 'help', 'food', 'lodging', 'However', 'always', 'had', 'gas', 'engine', 'even', 'had', 'money', 'even', 'traveled', 'estimation', 'many', 'miles', 'gas', 'stations', 'Sorry', 'point', 'seemed', 'always', 'be', 'back', 'mind.The', 'DVD', 'rented', 'gave', 'English', 'Spanish', 'option', 'chose', 'English', 'option', 'got', 'sound', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'may', 'bother', 'been', 'experience', 'one', 'pay', 'greater', 'attention', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'eyes', 'wander', 'screen', 'much', 'Engligh', 'language', 'films', 'can', 'go', 'kitchen', 'grab', 'something', 'listening', 'dialogue', 'background', 'music', 'cue', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'intense', 'subtitles', 'time', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'want', 'be', 'doing', 'anything', 'else', 'watching', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'movie', 'attention']",N/A

Fulton,"[3, 6]","A beautiful exploration of how a road trip across Latin America in 1952 makes a lasting impression on a pair of idealistic young medical students, one of whom would later go on to become the Communist revolutionary Che Guevara. As they meet rural peasants who don't have adequate medical care, any land rights or any other basic necessities, we watch as the seeds of social change are planted in young Che's mind. The acting is good, there are many humorous moments, and the movie makes use of local actors which adds to the feeling of authenticity as the men travel through different Latin American countries.  The chief negative aspect of this movie is that Che is portrayed as being a very decent and  honorable man which may be inconsistent with how many view him in real life.  As I don't pretend to know Che's real life story, I enjoyed the movie as it was presented and skipped on passing judgment on fact.",5,lets take a road trip!,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,913,"['beautiful', 'exploration', 'how', 'road', 'trip', 'Latin', 'America', '1952', 'lasting', 'impression', 'pair', 'idealistic', 'young', 'medical', 'students', 'one', 'whom', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'become', 'Communist', 'revolutionary', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'meet', 'rural', 'peasants', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'adequate', 'medical', 'care', 'land', 'rights', 'other', 'basic', 'necessities', 'watch', 'seeds', 'social', 'change', 'are', 'planted', 'young', 'Che', 'mind', 'acting', 'good', 'are', 'many', 'humorous', 'moments', 'movie', 'use', 'local', 'actors', 'feeling', 'authenticity', 'men', 'travel', 'different', 'Latin', 'American', 'countries', 'chief', 'negative', 'aspect', 'movie', 'Che', 'portrayed', 'being', 'very', 'decent', 'honorable', 'man', 'may', 'be', 'inconsistent', 'how', 'many', 'view', 'real', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'know', 'Che', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'presented', 'skipped', 'passing', 'judgment', 'fact']",N/A

The death of Che Guevara that year meant little to me because he was ""a bad guy"".  A later film, ""Che"" (1969 with Omar Sharif) was such a bomb, Che has never been given the recognition that is due. ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is a well-made film by the brilliant Walter Salles, and stars the excellent Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna as Che and his good friend, Alberto Granado, as they set out to discover the South American countryside, from Argentina, to Chile & Peru, ending in Colombia; the film ends there. This is a buddy movie, with humor, adventure and purpose. Che's discovery of man's inhumanity to man started with this trip, and the rest is history. Breath-taking cinematography by Eric Gautier, and an unobtrusive but effective score by Gustavo Santaolalla add to the enjoyment. The two leads have wonderful chemistry, and it all comes together for an exciting ride, with an award-winning script by Jose Rivera. The DVD extras are insightful, especially noting that Che's daughter, Aleila, and Alberto Granado himself both give their absolute blessing to the proceedings.

629103,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JNCZ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","The Motorcycle Diaries (Walter Salles, 2004)The Motorcycle Diaries is the story of a roadtrip taken by two friends, Che Guevara (The Crime of Father Amaro's Gael Garcia Bernal) and Alberto Granado (TV actor Rodrigo de la Serna, a second cousin of the actual Che Guevara). The movie, based on Guevara's memoirs, is the story of how Che went from being just another bourgeois medical student to being a crusader for workers' rights and an idol to communists around the globe. As such, the movie has been much castigated in America as being a glorification of communism or the like.In fact, Guevara's great awakening takes a somewhat surprising back seat to the journey itself here, and that's one of the things that makes The Motorcycle Diaries into such a wonderful, and watchable, movie. Bernal and De la Serna are both fine actors, and the chemistry between the two is easily the equal of that to be found in any Hollywood buddy-cop movie of the last ten years. Director Walter Salles (Central Station) and screenwriter Jose Rivera (Eerie, Indiana) decided, quite rightly, to focus on that chemistry, to make The Motorcycle Diaries the story of a friendship that happens to contain a political awakening, rather than a political awakening that happens to be couched within a friendship, and it makes all the difference.

629105,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JNCZ,Robert Moore,"[270, 294]","As most potential viewers know, this film is based on diaries and letters to home written by Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara during a motorcycle and foot tour of a significant portion of South America during the early 1950s, years before Guevara achieved international renown as a Communist and Latino revolutionary.  Thus, the film functions as an attempt to get at the heart of the person who preceded the myth.  The film is therefore difficult to judge as pure cinema.  Is this, on its own merits, a great film?  Or is it a great film about Che Guevara?  Interestingly, the person I saw this film with knew absolutely nothing about the subject of the film before it started, and did not connect Ernesto Guevara with Che Guevara until very late in the film.  Her reaction was interesting.  Until she realized that it was about Che, she says that she considered it a decent but only slightly above average ""road"" picture, but it gained considerably in her estimation once she realized who the film was about.  I think she was correct, and I would agree with those who feel that what merits the film has depends to some degree on who the film is about.  If Ernesto hadn't become Che, it would be a good film but of considerably less interest than it is.The film does a good job of rooting Che's eventual concern with the liberation of the oppressed by depicting his broad and constant encounters with everyday people throughout the continent.  Camus wrote that it was important to side with the victims and not the executioners, and in his travels Ernesto spends most of his time with the victims.  His near-epic exposure to the continent clearly condition his sympathies and inform his vision.  At the end of the film it is easy to understand why Che chose a life dedicated to aiding the oppressed in Cuba and elsewhere.  The great question left unanswered, and the one reason one can find Che's life morally troubling, is why he felt that the causes he espoused demanded a violent, military response.  Why follow in the steps of Trotsky and Lenin rather than Gandhi?  Apart from a single line which merely hints that Che felt violence might be necessary, the film doesn't come anywhere close to answering this question.In many ways, the star of the film is the South American continent.  I have seen many films over the years set in one corner of the continent or another, but none provided a panoramic view.  This film, however, by swinging through Argentina, Chile, Peru, Columbia, and Venezuela provides a graphic impression of the continent's immense geographical diversity, expanse, and enormous beautiful.  I don't think it would be possible to see this film without a deep urge to visit the land.  The scene shot in Machu Picchu reveals the incredible beauty of the site better than anything else I have ever seen.Gael Garcia Bernal is a remarkably handsome, talented young actor, formerly best known for one of the two young men in Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and is outstanding in portraying the young Che Guevara.  One suspects that his days as an actor in primarily Latin productions is close to an end, his next several projects originating in Hollywood.  Rodrigo De la Serna does not have the enormous charisma of Bernal, but he more than holds his own in the film.

629106,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JNCZ,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","***1/2In 1952, a promising young medical student named Ernesto Guevara de la Serna set off on an epic journey that would take him and his buddy, Alberto Granada, from their home in Buenos Aires to the northernmost tip of Venezuela.  The things Ernesto saw and the people he met along the way would wind up changing not only his life but the lives of the countless people who were soon to become his followers.  For that man would become known to history as `Che' Guevara, the Marxist revolutionary who, to this day, for good or for ill, remains an iconic figure to many downtrodden and oppressed peoples of the world - and a symbol of Communist tyranny to others.""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is based on Guevara's own writings about the trip.  Even so, the film is never totally successful at showing how this rather modest young man became one of the world's leading revolutionary figures.  Although the movie is extremely well made from a technical standpoint, the first half plays like any other road trip movie, chronicling the boys' encounters with various people and their mishaps with the motorcycle.  In the second half, however, we begin to see the stirring of a social conscience in Guevara that would become the focal point of all his future activities.  As he encounters more and more indigent people suffering at the hands of an indifferent ruling class, Guevara becomes acutely aware of the great divide that exists between wealth and poverty in the world and the great human and social injustice that such a gulf leads to.  As a result, the second half of the movie is more interesting than the first.  However, even here, something seems to be missing.  Is it that we just don't see enough real suffering on the part of the people Guevara encounters?  Or is it that Gael Garcia Bernal, fine actor though he is, is simply too passive, too much an observer to convince us that his character would later go on to become such a key mover of world events?This is not to say that ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" doesn't have moments of great beauty and power, only that it never reveals much to us about the interior workings of the man who is its subject.  In addition to the confident directing by Walter Salles and the fluid editing and camerawork, the film has a rich musical score, filled with flavorful Spanish rhythms, provided by Gustavo Santaolalla, who recently won an Academy Award for his even more beautiful work in ""Brokeback Mountain.""Even 46 years after his death, Guevara still remains a lightning rod for controversy, with as many people lining up to despise him as to honor him.  Certainly the Castro revolution in Cuba, in which Guevara played so prominent a part, hardly led to a land of plenty or a life of freedom for the horribly oppressed people there.  ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" because it only covers Guevara's pre-revolutionary years, is able to bypass all that messiness and paint the man in largely glowing and positive terms.  Thus, the movie fails to catch the irony of a man who began as a defender of oppressed people eventually helping to install a system in which his own group became the oppressors themselves.  A movie on that subject might make for a more searching and pointed film than this one turns out to be, but ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" still has much to recommend it.",3,uneven but often fascinating film,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,3312,"['***1/2In', '1952', 'promising', 'young', 'medical', 'student', 'named', 'Ernesto', 'Guevara', 'la', 'Serna', 'set', 'off', 'epic', 'journey', 'would', 'take', 'buddy', 'Alberto', 'Granada', 'home', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'northernmost', 'tip', 'Venezuela', 'things', 'Ernesto', 'saw', 'people', 'met', 'way', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'changing', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'lives', 'countless', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'soon', 'become', 'followers', 'man', 'would', 'become', 'known', 'history', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'Marxist', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'day', 'good', 'ill', 'iconic', 'figure', 'many', 'downtrodden', 'oppressed', 'peoples', 'world', 'symbol', 'Communist', 'tyranny', 'others', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'based', 'Guevara', 'own', 'writings', 'trip', 'Even', 'so', 'film', 'never', 'totally', 'successful', 'showing', 'how', 'rather', 'modest', 'young', 'man', 'became', 'one', 'world', 'leading', 'revolutionary', 'figures', 'movie', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'first', 'half', 'plays', 'other', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'chronicling', 'boys', 'encounters', 'various', 'people', 'mishaps', 'motorcycle', 'second', 'half', 'however', 'begin', 'see', 'stirring', 'social', 'conscience', 'Guevara', 'would', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'future', 'activities', 'more', 'more', 'indigent', 'people', 'suffering', 'hands', 'indifferent', 'ruling', 'class', 'Guevara', 'acutely', 'aware', 'great', 'divide', 'wealth', 'poverty', 'world', 'great', 'human', 'social', 'injustice', 'gulf', 'result', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'first', 'However', 'even', 'here', 'something', 'be', 'missing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'real', 'suffering', 'part', 'people', 'Guevara', 'encounters', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'fine', 'actor', 'simply', 'too', 'passive', 'too', 'much', 'observer', 'convince', 'character', 'would', 'later', 'go', 'become', 'such', 'key', 'mover', 'world', 'events', 'not', 'say', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', ""n't"", 'have', 'moments', 'great', 'beauty', 'power', 'only', 'never', 'much', 'interior', 'workings', 'man', 'who', 'subject', 'addition', 'confident', 'directing', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'fluid', 'editing', 'camerawork', 'film', 'rich', 'musical', 'score', 'filled', 'flavorful', 'Spanish', 'rhythms', 'provided', 'Gustavo', 'Santaolalla', 'who', 'recently', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'work', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Even', '46', 'years', 'death', 'Guevara', 'still', 'lightning', 'rod', 'controversy', 'many', 'people', 'lining', 'up', 'despise', 'honor', 'Certainly', 'Castro', 'revolution', 'Cuba', 'Guevara', 'played', 'so', 'prominent', 'part', 'hardly', 'led', 'land', 'plenty', 'life', 'freedom', 'horribly', 'oppressed', 'people', 'there', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'only', 'Guevara', 'pre-revolutionary', 'years', 'able', 'bypass', 'messiness', 'paint', 'man', 'largely', 'glowing', 'positive', 'terms', 'Thus', 'movie', 'catch', 'irony', 'man', 'who', 'began', 'defender', 'oppressed', 'people', 'eventually', 'helping', 'install', 'system', 'own', 'group', 'became', 'oppressors', 'movie', 'subject', 'might', 'make', 'more', 'searching', 'pointed', 'film', 'one', 'out', 'be', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'still', 'much', 'recommend']",N/A

629108,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JNCZ,Sebastian Fernandez,"[5, 7]","Let me start by stating in clear terms that those that are looking for the story of El Che as a revolutionary will be disappointed, since the film does not stretch into this area of his life. This is what happened to my wife, who was expecting a lot more than the movie delivered, but luckily I was aware of what the topic was, and found it extremely interesting. The reason being that it depicts extremely well how Ernesto Guevara grasped the reality of the Latin American and its people, and how these facts affected and changed him into what he later became.At the beginning, we find two friends, Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara and Alberto Granado, who have an urge to really get to know South America, to get away from civilization and to get closer to the land. That is why they decide to go on a road trip that will take them throughout the continent, exploring areas that they only know about through books. They leave Buenos Aires with the goal of reaching Venezuela in four months; their equipment is an old motorcycle, ""The Mighty One"", and the method to reach their goal is improvisation.The two friends show striking similarities in their way of looking at the world, but also considerable differences in their behavior. Alberto is more gregarious and can convince other people of almost anything through the use of his wit and talents as a kind of ""con artist"". Ernesto, a student of medicine, who is close to getting his degree, is more introverted and takes things a lot more seriously. And even though the movie does not go deeply into his ideology, it still shows how vigorously he reacts to injustice and need.In my opinion, the director Walter Salles tried to provide the viewers with a morsel of the experiences of El Che in this trip, but without going too deeply into an ideology that would make some people uncomfortable. I understand that in this way, Salles is trying to attract a wider audience; those that are interested in going deeper, will have to do it using additional sources. What the movie does do, is provide the viewers with spectacular images of an amazing continent. The breathtaking scene in Machu Pichu is one of the highest points in this area, and the reflections about how the Spanish exterminated the amazing Inca civilization filled me with sorrow and regret.Gael Garcia Bernal proves that he has all the qualities that make a successful actor, presenting a polished performance. He even delivers a very believable Argentinean accent, and the only department in which he comes short is the physical differences with El Che, but of course, there is not much he can do regarding this. Rodrigo De la Serna holds his end of the bargain pretty well, especially through his spontaneity, adding a humorous tone that helps move things along.The extras include a couple of deleted scenes that I would not have excluded, and an interview with the real Alberto Granado, who has been living in Cuba for a long time. There is also a brief interview with Santaolla, who did an outstanding work with the music in this film, by incorporating the sounds of South America. The music includes an inspiring song that has been nominated for an Oscar: ""Al Otro Lado del Rio"" by Jorge Drexler.",4,"""So much injustice""",1109462400,"02 27, 2005",2005,3207,"['Let', 'start', 'stating', 'clear', 'terms', 'are', 'looking', 'story', 'El', 'Che', 'revolutionary', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'not', 'stretch', 'area', 'life', 'happened', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'movie', 'delivered', 'luckily', 'was', 'aware', 'what', 'topic', 'was', 'found', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'reason', 'being', 'extremely', 'well', 'how', 'Ernesto', 'Guevara', 'grasped', 'reality', 'Latin', 'American', 'people', 'how', 'facts', 'affected', 'changed', 'what', 'later', 'became.At', 'beginning', 'find', 'two', 'friends', 'Ernesto', 'Che', 'Guevara', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'who', 'have', 'urge', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'South', 'America', 'get', 'away', 'civilization', 'get', 'closer', 'land', 'why', 'decide', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'will', 'take', 'continent', 'exploring', 'areas', 'only', 'know', 'books', 'leave', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'goal', 'reaching', 'Venezuela', 'four', 'months', 'equipment', 'old', 'motorcycle', 'Mighty', 'One', 'method', 'reach', 'goal', 'improvisation.The', 'two', 'friends', 'show', 'striking', 'similarities', 'way', 'looking', 'world', 'also', 'considerable', 'differences', 'behavior', 'Alberto', 'more', 'gregarious', 'can', 'convince', 'other', 'people', 'almost', 'anything', 'use', 'wit', 'talents', 'kind', 'con', 'artist', 'Ernesto', 'student', 'medicine', 'who', 'close', 'getting', 'degree', 'more', 'introverted', 'things', 'lot', 'more', 'seriously', 'even', 'movie', 'not', 'go', 'deeply', 'ideology', 'still', 'how', 'vigorously', 'injustice', 'need.In', 'opinion', 'director', 'Walter', 'Salles', 'tried', 'provide', 'viewers', 'morsel', 'experiences', 'El', 'Che', 'trip', 'going', 'too', 'deeply', 'ideology', 'would', 'make', 'people', 'uncomfortable', 'understand', 'way', 'Salles', 'trying', 'attract', 'wider', 'audience', 'are', 'interested', 'going', 'deeper', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'using', 'additional', 'sources', 'What', 'movie', 'do', 'viewers', 'spectacular', 'images', 'amazing', 'continent', 'breathtaking', 'scene', 'Machu', 'Pichu', 'one', 'highest', 'points', 'area', 'reflections', 'how', 'Spanish', 'exterminated', 'amazing', 'Inca', 'civilization', 'filled', 'sorrow', 'regret.Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'qualities', 'make', 'successful', 'actor', 'presenting', 'polished', 'performance', 'even', 'very', 'believable', 'Argentinean', 'accent', 'only', 'department', 'short', 'physical', 'differences', 'El', 'Che', 'course', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'regarding', 'Rodrigo', 'De', 'la', 'Serna', 'end', 'bargain', 'pretty', 'well', 'especially', 'spontaneity', 'adding', 'humorous', 'tone', 'move', 'things', 'along.The', 'extras', 'include', 'couple', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'excluded', 'interview', 'real', 'Alberto', 'Granado', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'Cuba', 'long', 'time', 'also', 'brief', 'interview', 'Santaolla', 'who', 'did', 'outstanding', 'work', 'music', 'film', 'incorporating', 'sounds', 'South', 'America', 'music', 'inspiring', 'song', 'been', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Al', 'Otro', 'Lado', 'del', 'Rio', 'Jorge', 'Drexler']",N/A

A great sense of unity is created by this movie; the score, the performances, the costumes, the sets, the scenery... all of it works together to create a very beautiful and emotionally powerful film.Gael Garcia Bernal, the best thing to ever come out of Mexico, stars as a young Che Guevera, in the years before all of his political activity.

He wants to live more, see more. And Guevera is the perfect partner for the trip.Only, the pair will be faced with many hardships and battles during their journey, the hardest of all concerning a prolonged stay at a leprosy comunity, wehre Guevera will learn more than just a few things about life itself.Although the movie could have benefited from a few trims to shorten its long running time, none of it ever feels really superfluous. It's true that the film never truly gives us a clue as to why Guevera became the revolutionary figure that he was in his last years asd a political activist, but as a self-exploratory journey, the movie hits all the right buttons.I was often awed by the beauty and sadness of it all.

The director is wise not to weigh his narrative down with too many explicit allusions to his eventual activist zeal.Whatever it's political underpinnings, at least it's a gorgeous looking picture, a trekker's fantasy that catalogs the ramshackle journey of a couple of young men who hailed from good stock, but gave all that up to set off on a rinkydink motorcycle to see places they'd only read about and meet people they'd never imagined.It is difficult not to fall in love with the stunning imagery that pervades the film, as we watch a neorealistic camera cut a vast Latin American skein from the snow-covered Andes, to the mysterious ruins of Machu Picchu, to a sprawling Chilean desert and a Peruvian river that the young Guevara swims across in the film's climax -- all physical destinations to be reached and crossed as well as stages in our protagonist's spiritual and psychological growth.Some traces of ham-handedness may be evident in the latter half, when Guevara speaks with a homeless person or a coarse day labor manager or an ostracized leper. But Bernal does a fabulous job of maintaining a perfect dose of traveler's passivity coupled with boyish inquisitiveness.Thinking back, the movie could also have thrown in some measure of a conclusive message into the fray, but the guitar strumming that serves as a backdrop to the closing credits simply overtakes that thought in my mind.

Nemeth,"[8, 11]","This film has remarkably beautiful photography, commendable acting, and, early on, undeniably amusing scenes of camaraderie between the young, relatively well-off Che and his road trip companion as they travel through South America, frequently slumming among the genuine poor. Unfortunately though, the film's vision becomes finally evasive, if not downright cowardly. If Salles had made a film, say, about infamous young Adolf in his days as an aspiring, high-minded artist, while wholly ignoring his later destructive actions once in power, yet returning to finish his story with a tacked on, real world eulogy by a former storm trooper, there'd be hell to pay. Because this film, likewise, does not confine itself completely to its hero's idealistic youth, but seeks instead, through the eulogy by his actual, now aged buddy, to impinge upon our real world assessment of the historical Che, it tumbles out of art and into easy, fashionable propaganda. Salles' vision seems to have been distorted by an adherence to some simple-minded notions, that caring words count more than actual later deeds, and that a lily, if of the left, even should it come to fester, will not smell far worse than weeds.",3,"His Youthful Words, But Not His Grownup Deeds",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,1200,"['film', 'remarkably', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'commendable', 'acting', 'early', 'undeniably', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'camaraderie', 'young', 'relatively', 'well-off', 'Che', 'road', 'trip', 'companion', 'travel', 'South', 'America', 'frequently', 'slumming', 'genuine', 'poor', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'vision', 'finally', 'evasive', 'not', 'downright', 'cowardly', 'Salles', 'had', 'made', 'film', 'say', 'about', 'infamous', 'young', 'Adolf', 'days', 'aspiring', 'high-minded', 'artist', 'wholly', 'ignoring', 'later', 'destructive', 'actions', 'once', 'power', 'yet', 'returning', 'finish', 'story', 'tacked', 'real', 'world', 'eulogy', 'former', 'storm', 'trooper', ""'d"", 'be', 'hell', 'pay', 'film', 'likewise', 'not', 'confine', 'completely', 'hero', 'idealistic', 'youth', 'instead', 'eulogy', 'actual', 'now', 'aged', 'buddy', 'impinge', 'real', 'world', 'assessment', 'historical', 'Che', 'art', 'easy', 'fashionable', 'propaganda', 'Salles', 'vision', 'have', 'been', 'distorted', 'adherence', 'simple-minded', 'notions', 'caring', 'words', 'count', 'more', 'actual', 'later', 'deeds', 'lily', 'left', 'even', 'should', 'come', 'fester', 'will', 'not', 'smell', 'far', 'worse', 'weeds']",N/A

Young Che (Ernesto), portrayed by the well-cast, eye candy (attractive) Gael Garcia Bernal: bonds with the common people (""I like your face"" says one rural dweller approvingly), sacrifices for the poor, has empathy for the sick, heals the lepers, knows his own suffering and vulnerability, and strongly hints that he will dedicate his life to fighting the growing INJUSTICE they find.  In other words, young Che is presented as a very Christ-like figure.  But the final moments of the film give away a strong political bias -- Che was inexplicably murdered ""BY THE CIA.""  So we have this saintly, Christ-like man-child at the end of a transformative journey which takes him to the cusp of adulthood  -- but whose life was cut short by the US government agency equated with all the evil above.  The film would be beautiful if it was simply about 2 young men unknown to this day and age.  Because the story is obviously about a historical figure (a revolutionary leader who led armed rebellions involving lots of bloodshed) there are puzzling gaps -- how could such an vulnerable asthmatic become a jungle-based commando?

Gueverra at the time did not have much money and he and his travelling companion set of on a battered old motor cycle. Che was a final year medical student in Argentina the wealthiest of the South American countries. He and his companion soon ran out of money and had to scam their way around trying to get free food and accommodation. Some of the scams were elaborate and involved passing themselves off as qualified and famous medical practitioners.Che is of course famous as he became one of the lieutenants of Fidel Castro the insurgent who overthrew the Basta regime and set up the first and only communist state in America. The diaries that Che kept of his 1952 journey are of some significance in charting the change in his life from being a middle class aspiring doctor to becoming a social revolutionary. His biographers suggest that it was on this trip that he became aware of the degree of poverty in South America and also the fact that the existing power structures were somewhat corrupt.As a film the main strength is the rendition of the landscape. If one reads the biography of Che one finds that he engaged widely in all sorts of petty dishonesty during the trip. The film tries to paint a more sanitised portrait showing him to be reluctant to slip into dishonesty and his reluctance slowed down his more amoral friend. There is a tendency of the film to suggest a slight saintliness and that he was a sort of St Francis type character with a regard for the poor.This of course is somewhat at variance with how those who have become prominent communists act in practice. Most successful communists tend to be somewhat insensitive and ruthless in their interpersonal dealings.  Che was a successful and tough military leader(at least before Bolivia) rather than being a Argentinian version of Ghandi.Despite all that the film is rather pleasant.

Firstly it's about the unknown youth of one of the world's most well known people and most iconic legends known throughout the world; and of course the poster boy of millions of students in the 70's. Secondly, it's a road movie, and I love road movies of all kinds, whether they are factual, funny, dramatic, sad, introspective or a mix of all these things. Thirdly, it's just a great movie and a buddy movie about friendship and bromance between two youths who are in many ways very different but are as we say in England 'best mates'. Fourthly, it goes throughout South America from country to country showing off this wonderful and magnificent continent in all its beauty and splendour; I think many of us who live in small compact countries have a dream of travelling throughout big continents and just seeing what there is in such huge places. Fifthly, the road movie is often a metaphor for life, and the journey taken on the road to here there and everywhere becomes symbolic of the journey we all make in life; from being a baby to being a kid; from being a kid to becoming a teenager; from being a teenager to being a young adult; from being a young adult to becoming... a slightly older adult! It happens to us all.The film has no bad parts in it and the script and the acting are top-notch; they picked very good actors for the roles. Of course, the film is in Spanish, so you need subtitles if you can't speak that language but this in no way detracts from the film, lending it in fact an exotic air; well it is South America after all.

629123,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JNCZ,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","First, I must say 'The Motorcycle Diaries' might be off-putting for some of you as it is the portrait of 'Che' Guevara, the revolutionalist.  Thankfully, the film shows the young days of him in 1952, before he flies to Cuba.  There is a political undercurrent in the film, but it is no socialist message or whatever message from the director Walter Salles ('Central Station') or the co-executive producer Robert Redford.Back then, 52 years ago, Ernest Guevara is a medical student living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who decides to travel around the South America, with his friend Alberto.  They ride on a big, old motercycle, and leaves the city to head for the north, without making any detailed plans for the travel.  They were very young -- Ernest 23, Albelto 30.  And they know that the experience would change their life, and as it turns out, is does, perhaps more than they expected.The film follows almost exactly the route of their 8,000 miles travel (and shot in the story's time order).  You know, the name of 'road movie' should be applied to this kind of film, which conveys the humid air of the rivers, the snowy road of Chile, and the moutanious land and the ruined city in Peru.  To watch the film is to feel the life of the places, and this is the best thing you can find in 'The Motorcycle Diaries.'During the travel, as you see, Guevara undergoes a spiritual change, witnessing the poverty of the exploited people.  As I said before, the film does NOT show much of this side, for considering the many facts about the complex history of South America, it is a tricky business to include politics.  The film basically remains personal -- personal accounts of the travelling, which changed one youth's mind.  As to the results of the changes, the opinions would naturally divide.Gael Garcia Bernal ('And Your Mother Too') gives a convincing image as Guevara while Rodrigo de la Serna from Argentina is equally effective as Albelto.  Though Mia Maestro plays the sweetheart of Guevara, and pretty impressive, the film is about the two men, one of whom is still remembered in the history.  What happened to the other person, you will see at the end of the film.The film, I am afraid, tends to admire these two travellers (who often talk like womanizers, but the film never shows their actual deeds).

The movie is an often quite boring look into a motorcycle ride Che made with a fellow ""doctor"" (neither were exactly) to see what exactly was happening in South America. It ends with the two going to a leper colony and seeing the hardships of the natives. What the movie does show is how idealistic and somewhat naive the young Che is. He is seeing that they need to do something. There is hardly any plot to the movie and hardly anything actually happens to them. The acting, though, is superb.

This film by Brazilian director Walter Salles and starring Gael Garcia Bernal follows Ernesto Guevara and his friend Alberto Granado as they travel 5000 miles in 4 months from their native Argentina to Chile, Peru, Columbia, and Venezuela through spectacular scenery on a beat up motorcycle. We learn much about the character of Dr. Guevara as a young man and his identification with the oppressed indigenous people of South America, especially the lepers he treats as humans, not untouchables.The movie ends with a line from the famous poem Romance Sonambula by revolutionary Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca: ""yo ya no soy yo"" (I am no longer myself) to indicate how much this trip changed his perspective on life.
