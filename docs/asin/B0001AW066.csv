Monica and Chandler get married and Rachel is pregnant but it goes into more detail next season. Joey goes back on Days of our Lives and Phoebe is as funny as ever when she freaks out over nothing.

Monica and Chandler are engaged and the whole season revolves around the wedding which takes place in the season finale. I really like the episode, The One with Phoebe's Cookies, it's hilarious. The One with All the Cheesecakes and the Christmas Candy are also standouts. A lot of guest stars appeared in this season like Susan Sarandon, Jason Alexander, Denise Richards, and Kathleen Turner.

This is probably my favorite season of the show, despite some apparent behind the scenes issues, I personally think this is the season that sort-of reinvented the show.  Maybe it was just the fact that I can name a dozen things I didn't like about season 6, but it may also be that season 7 was just that good.

The episodes aired completely uncut with added footage are enjoyable, and the gag reel is fun.  The commentaries are my favorite, they provide such great insight into the 'heart' of the show and what it  was to create it.  I only wish we could've gotten a commentary by any of the cast members, particulary Jennifer, who did such a great one on ""The Good Girl"". However, Marta Kauffman, Kevin Bright and David Crane are just as good.The rest of the set lacks in subtance.  Screen tests, storyboards, interviews & original scripts would have been welcome additions.  Friends was such a phenomenon on television, its a shame to not see more promotional material and behind-the-scenes bits. Perhaps on the 10th season DVD?I bought the set for the episodes because they are the core of the show. The funny, the dramatic, the silly.  The moments we know so well.

They all plan to go out to The Ritz for drinks, in celebration of Monica and Chandler's love. But while everyone is in the midst of getting dressed, Monica finds Rachel and Ross kissing each other passionately, right outside Monica's apartment. The kiss was initiated by a little flirtation between the two. Monica becomes angered, for she feels that Rachel is trying to steal Monica's thunder.Meantime, Rachel, who has been working at Ralph Lauren for almost two years now, has been made an executive in her department. Not only is she a big exec, she has also been made part of the hiring team, where she is allowed to hire an assistant for herself. She has two interviews for the job. The first is a woman named Hilda, who is more than qualified for the job. Rachel is considering giving the job to Hilda, until she meets her second interview: Tag Jones. Tag is 25 year old inexperienced business office worker, but Rachel is completely breathtaken by his naturally good looks. She ponders over it with Chandler and Phoebe, who tell her that the right thing to do is to hire Hilda because she is qualified for the job. But hires Tag instead. Phoebe meets Tag and is a little surprised at Rachel, where she tells her that because he is now her assistant, she cannot get involved with him. Meantime, Monica and Chandler discuss how it is important to tell each other their secrets. Chandler tells Monica how Ross had a certain accident while on Space Mountain in Disney World. Monica decides to Ross finds out about Monica knowing, leading Ross to tell Monica that, while he and Ross were in a bar, back in college, Chandler met a woman and began kissing her. It is revealed that it wasn't a woman, but a man.In another episode, while working in her restaurant's kitchen, Monica runs into none other than...Janice. They catch up on how they are doing until Janice spots the ring on Monica's finger. Monica tells Chandler about who she ran into. Monica reveals that Janice is dating a guy named Clark and that, ""...she also kind of invited herself to the wedding."". Chandler gets upset, but Monica didn't know what to do. Chandler says that it would have been much easier to lie. Monica reveals that he can lie to her on Saturday night because he and Monica are going to dinner with Janice and Clark. They try to stop her from coming to the wedding by telling her that no friends are invited and that it is strictly family. But Janice twists that around in thinking that they consider her to be family. Later, Janice stops by and asks to spend the night with them, for she is touched at thinking that they look at her as family. But Monica finally gets her to leave the apartment and not show up at the wedding by lying in saying that Chandler still has feelings for her. Meanwhile, Joey has a one-night stand with a girl named Erin. He has Rachel tell her that he is not looking for a relationship, but Rachel and Phoebe warms up to her. Rachel and Phoebe persuade Joey to give her a chance, for they really like Erin.On Thanksgiving, Rachel invites Tag over, for he had just broken up with his girlfriend. She figures that this may be her chance to tell Tag how she feels about him. She finally tells him out on the terrist, but he finds that his car is being stolen. Phoebe reveals that she has a dog in her room named Clunkers. The dog belongs to a couple of friends of Phoebe's and she volunteered to watch him, while they were on vacation, but Chandler reveals that he is afraid of dogs. Chandler has also taught the gang a game, where you have to try and write down all 50 states in six minutes. That does not sound like a problem, but here's the catch, you have to write them down from memory. Ross tries it and gets all 50, but Chandler finds that Ross forget four states, where he tells Ross that if he does not figure out the last four states, he gets no dinner. Rachel and Tag talk about their conversation, leading them into a dating relationship.The season ends with Monica and Chandler's wedding. Chandler's much mentioned, but never before-seen, father, Charles Bing is invited to the wedding. Chandler takes off in fear of getting married. Ross finds him and helps him feel better, but Chandler finds out from Rachel and Phoebe that Monica is pregnant. Monica reveals that she is not, but who is? Who is pregnant? ...Rachel.Buy the complete seventh season and you'll find yourself getting a seventh surgery, repairing your split sides. You'll all enjoy it.

798477,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0001AW066,Craig MACKINNON,"[2, 2]","There are some sitcoms that required ""growing up"" before they became really good - and Friends is one of those.  Early seasons had distracting gimmicks like monkeys and triplets.  Later seasons relied on the performances and writing and were better as a result.  Season 7 is a solid season all the way through, with the underlying theme of preparation for Monica and Chandler's wedding appearing in most of the episodes.  Thus, the entire season has a narrative flow of sorts, but every episode is still stand-alone and watchable by itself.Other reviews have listed the entire set of shows, so there is no need for me to repeat that.  Some others have mentioned that the season is somewhat bland.  Perhaps this is most true for those viewers invested primarily in the Rachel-Ross Axis, especially in the light of the upcoming Season 8 that re-introduces that entire storyline (through Rachel's pregnancy).  I, for one, do not miss it.  There are plenty of ""soap-opera moments"" in this season, but I prefer such moments to be centred on the soundstage where Joey is filming ""Days of Our Lives"".All in all, it is a solid and very funny season.  There are lots of guest stars - a personal favourite is Susan Sarandon as a soap opera queen.  The box set is exactly what you'd expect if you've bought previous seasons of the show - there are a few commentaries (which often have a few neat tidbits but which also tend to cheerleading at times), there is a little quiz, and so on.  However, the best part of having the show on DVD is to be able to watch it uncut and without advertisements.  Friends is also one of those shows that improves when you see the episodes together - the underlying comraderie and warmth of the cast is emphasized, and it makes the inside runnning jokes funnier.",4,The Season with Monica and Changler's Wedding,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,1783,"['are', 'sitcoms', 'required', 'growing', 'up', 'became', 'really', 'good', 'Friends', 'one', 'Early', 'seasons', 'had', 'distracting', 'gimmicks', 'monkeys', 'triplets', 'Later', 'seasons', 'relied', 'performances', 'writing', 'were', 'better', 'result', 'Season', '7', 'solid', 'season', 'way', 'underlying', 'theme', 'preparation', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'wedding', 'appearing', 'most', 'episodes', 'Thus', 'entire', 'season', 'narrative', 'flow', 'sorts', 'episode', 'still', 'stand-alone', 'watchable', 'itself.Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'listed', 'entire', 'set', 'shows', 'need', 'repeat', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'season', 'somewhat', 'bland', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'true', 'viewers', 'invested', 'primarily', 'Rachel-Ross', 'Axis', 'especially', 'light', 'upcoming', 'Season', '8', 're-introduces', 'entire', 'storyline', 'Rachel', 'pregnancy', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'are', 'plenty', 'soap-opera', 'moments', 'season', 'prefer', 'such', 'moments', 'be', 'centred', 'soundstage', 'where', 'Joey', 'filming', 'Days', 'Lives', '.All', 'solid', 'very', 'funny', 'season', 'are', 'lots', 'guest', 'stars', 'personal', 'favourite', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'soap', 'opera', 'queen', 'box', 'set', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'few', 'commentaries', 'often', 'have', 'few', 'neat', 'tidbits', 'also', 'tend', 'cheerleading', 'times', 'little', 'quiz', 'so', 'However', 'best', 'part', 'having', 'show', 'DVD', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'uncut', 'advertisements', 'Friends', 'also', 'one', 'shows', 'when', 'see', 'episodes', 'together', 'underlying', 'comraderie', 'warmth', 'cast', 'emphasized', 'inside', 'runnning', 'jokes', 'funnier']",Friends: Season 7

798483,ARX984I8G47K5,B0001AW066,friendsfan,"[7, 11]","The seventh season of ""Friends"" represents the show at it's worst. It seems as if the writers and producers were running out of steam and were losing some of the hillarious creativity that made the show Must See for the previous six seasons. The actors did what they could to try to elevate the material but, for the only time during the show's run, the cast seemed bored and detatached. Something was just amiss during this season in general. The show had a strange feel to it and to a new viewer, the once mighty ""Friends"" may have seemed like a medicore sitcom that was overhyped for no reason. Maybe  for the first time the loyal fans of the show felt that maybe it was time to bow out (thankfully season eight reinvogorated the writers, the cast, and the audience and provided a renassiance of sorts that would last until the end of the show's run). The entire season revolved around Monica and Chandler's wedding and every other storyline seems to be filler until the writer's could marry the two off in a May-Sweeps season ending episode. I believe this was the season when Perry's drug addiction was reaching its climax and, for the first and only time, his personal troubles began to affect his acting (thankfully Perry recovered and did the right thing by taking time off to get his problems in order). Chandler who once was arguably the funniest character on primetime, now became a corny shadow of himself. Monica reached an all time controlling high as she planned her wedding, and Cox again finds herself in a thankless role. To her credit, Cox does make Monica amusing and still tries to retain her likeability, but the writers prove too strong for the nearly unfailing Cox and Monica becomes a caricature (it will still be another season or two before Monica is restored to a multi-layered charming character again). Rachel's major storyline involved her relationship with her much younger assistant Tag. Rachel's work situations are always funny and Aniston again plays Rachel to a charming, if somewhat befuddled, T (as most fans know however it is not until season 8 when Aniston is really given the material and opportunity to shine). Phoebe is again not given a lot to do this season but mainly support the other characters, and again, Kudrow proves to be unfailing in her portrayal. Kudrow is maybe the only actor who is not bogged down with the material this season and she saves even some of the worst episodes (i.e ""TOW Rosita Dies""- hysterical Phoebe moments as a telemarketer trying to stop Jason Alexander from committing suicide). LeBlanc's Joey gets to reprise his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on DOOL. LeBlanc is funny and, along with Kudrow, he is also able to provide some memorable lines and scenes in an otherwise bleak season. Schwimmer's Ross is not really given much of a story arc this season and Schwimmer is effective and funny in his role. While season seven is problematic, it is still ""Friends"" after all so there are bound to be some meorable episodes, including, ""TOW Monica's Thunder,"" ""TOW Phoebe's Cookies"" (absolutely hysterical Pheebs/Monica story and scenes), ""TOW Rachel's Assistant,"" ""TOW Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs"" (it's a Thanksgiving episode so it's bound to be a highlight), ""TOW They're Up All Night,"" ""TOW They All Turn Thirty"" (Aniston feels so funny and real here and the flashbacks to all their thirtieth birthdays are classic), ""TOW Monica and Chandler's Wedding"" (a great episode all around every actor is finally back on their game here and the episode itself feels like it belongs in one of ""Friends"" earlier and funnier seasons. This episode also provides one of the greatest shocks in ""Friends"" history and sets the stage for one of the stories that will rejuvenate the following season..Rachel's pregnancy).",3,"The worst season of ""Friends""",1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,3775,"['seventh', 'season', 'Friends', 'show', 'worst', 'writers', 'producers', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'were', 'losing', 'hillarious', 'creativity', 'made', 'show', 'Must', 'See', 'previous', 'six', 'seasons', 'actors', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'try', 'elevate', 'material', 'only', 'time', 'show', 'run', 'cast', 'seemed', 'bored', 'detatached', 'Something', 'was', 'just', 'amiss', 'season', 'general', 'show', 'had', 'strange', 'feel', 'new', 'viewer', 'once', 'mighty', 'Friends', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'medicore', 'sitcom', 'was', 'overhyped', 'reason', 'Maybe', 'first', 'time', 'loyal', 'fans', 'show', 'felt', 'maybe', 'was', 'time', 'bow', 'out', 'thankfully', 'season', 'eight', 'reinvogorated', 'writers', 'cast', 'audience', 'provided', 'renassiance', 'sorts', 'would', 'last', 'end', 'show', 'run', 'entire', 'season', 'revolved', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'wedding', 'other', 'storyline', 'be', 'filler', 'writer', 'could', 'marry', 'two', 'May-Sweeps', 'season', 'ending', 'episode', 'believe', 'was', 'season', 'when', 'Perry', 'drug', 'addiction', 'was', 'reaching', 'climax', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'personal', 'troubles', 'began', 'affect', 'acting', 'thankfully', 'Perry', 'recovered', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'taking', 'time', 'off', 'get', 'problems', 'order', 'Chandler', 'who', 'once', 'was', 'arguably', 'funniest', 'character', 'primetime', 'now', 'became', 'corny', 'shadow', 'Monica', 'reached', 'time', 'controlling', 'high', 'planned', 'wedding', 'Cox', 'again', 'thankless', 'role', 'credit', 'Cox', 'make', 'Monica', 'amusing', 'still', 'retain', 'likeability', 'writers', 'prove', 'too', 'strong', 'nearly', 'unfailing', 'Cox', 'Monica', 'caricature', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'season', 'two', 'Monica', 'restored', 'multi-layered', 'charming', 'character', 'again', 'Rachel', 'major', 'storyline', 'involved', 'relationship', 'much', 'younger', 'assistant', 'Tag', 'Rachel', 'work', 'situations', 'are', 'always', 'funny', 'Aniston', 'again', 'Rachel', 'charming', 'somewhat', 'befuddled', 'T', 'most', 'fans', 'know', 'however', 'not', 'season', '8', 'when', 'Aniston', 'really', 'given', 'material', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'Phoebe', 'again', 'not', 'given', 'lot', 'do', 'season', 'mainly', 'support', 'other', 'characters', 'again', 'Kudrow', 'be', 'unfailing', 'portrayal', 'Kudrow', 'maybe', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'not', 'bogged', 'down', 'material', 'season', 'even', 'worst', 'episodes', 'i.e', 'TOW', 'Rosita', 'Dies', 'hysterical', 'Phoebe', 'moments', 'telemarketer', 'trying', 'stop', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'committing', 'suicide', 'LeBlanc', 'Joey', 'reprise', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Drake', 'Ramoray', 'DOOL', 'LeBlanc', 'funny', 'Kudrow', 'also', 'able', 'provide', 'memorable', 'lines', 'scenes', 'otherwise', 'bleak', 'season', 'Schwimmer', 'Ross', 'not', 'really', 'given', 'much', 'story', 'arc', 'season', 'Schwimmer', 'effective', 'funny', 'role', 'season', 'seven', 'problematic', 'still', 'Friends', 'so', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'meorable', 'episodes', 'including', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Thunder', 'TOW', 'Phoebe', 'Cookies', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'Pheebs/Monica', 'story', 'scenes', 'TOW', 'Rachel', 'Assistant', 'TOW', 'Chandler', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Dogs', 'Thanksgiving', 'episode', 'bound', 'be', 'highlight', 'TOW', ""'re"", 'Up', 'Night', 'TOW', 'Turn', 'Thirty', 'Aniston', 'feels', 'so', 'funny', 'real', 'here', 'flashbacks', 'thirtieth', 'birthdays', 'are', 'classic', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'Wedding', 'great', 'episode', 'actor', 'finally', 'back', 'game', 'here', 'episode', 'one', 'Friends', 'earlier', 'funnier', 'seasons', 'episode', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'shocks', 'Friends', 'history', 'stage', 'one', 'stories', 'will', 'rejuvenate', 'following', 'season..Rachel', 'pregnancy']",Friends: Season 7

They were spoiled by NBC and Warner in a way no sitcom star ever was.In interviews (like the recent Jay Leno's Tonight Show, the day of the last episode, or even in Oprah) all the cast have an extremely annoying aloof attitude towards the interview. They don't seem interested at all in the questions, of giving new information, of enjoying it (Schwimmer being the most boring of them, and Le Blanc the more friendly - but one can not say if that's because he knows he will remain at the spotlight with his spin-off ""Joey"" and still need ""audience acceptance""....)They are rich and they really live like extremely rich people, all with buying houses that cost more than three million dollars, and I've never heard any donation or charity work made by them.As another reviewer put it, the fact that, up until now, there are simply NO interviews or introduction by ANY of the six cast members can show only indifference.That's it.

798502,A1DL0EDVWPSPEW,B0001AW066,"Ryan Matthews ""montvil""","[1, 1]","I can't say with confidence that I have a least favorite season of this show. Of course, I don't think as a whole Season 7 is the show's weak point, but after noticing it was the only season receiving less than a 4 stars, I didn't think it got a fair rap.The primary issue is that there's only so much the writers can do when the season's 'A Story' was already developed at the end of Season 6. With everybody invested in Chandler and Monica's wedding, there really couldn't be any heavy story lines involving the other four characters that would divide an audience's attention. If you will, the writers couldn't allow anything to ""steal Monica's thunder.""High Points:- Chandler & Monica's Engagement Picture- Rachel teaches Joey how to sail- Joey & Ross's napping secret- Ross's library book- The Hanukkah story as told by the Holiday Armadillo, Santa and Superman- The One Where They All Turn 30- Joey's return to 'Days of Our Lives'- Monica reveals the ugly truth about London to Chandler- The One Where They're Up All Night (probably one of my favorite episodes in the whole series)- Joey's 'Soapie' Award- Denise Richards guest stars as Monica and Ross's hot cousin- Rachel runs into an old sorority sister (Winona Ryder) she made out with in college- Chandler & Monica fly out to Vegas to reconcile with Chandler's father and invite him to the weddingThe only throbbing flaw I found in Season 7 was in the 30th birthday episode. It revolves around Rachel's birthday and proceeds to flashbacks of everyone else's 30th. The only problem is that in Season 1's episode 'The Ick Factor', Monica reveals she is 26, which would've made her 30 in Season 5. Since Rachel's birthday is in Season 7 and Monica and Rachel knew each other from school, you have to assume they were the same age. I just wish the time line had been better, but I understand it's something the writers have to deal with.Weak Points:- Monica tries to recover an old cookie recipe passed down in Phoebe's family- Joey's lead on Mac And C.H.E.E.S.E.- The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs- The One With The Cheap Wedding DressThe whole season was a simple stall. I thought the writers did an excellent job with it and the acting was tremendous, as usual. Season 7 also entailed probably the most gripping Season Finale of the series and set the stage for a remarkable eighth season. This is a 5 star season any way you slice it. The worst of 'Friends', if this is it, is still one of the best things on TV.Grade: A-",5,From 'Friends' to Family: A Season 7 Review,1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,2488,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'confidence', 'have', 'least', 'favorite', 'season', 'show', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'whole', 'Season', '7', 'show', 'weak', 'point', 'noticing', 'was', 'only', 'season', 'receiving', 'less', '4', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'got', 'fair', 'rap.The', 'primary', 'issue', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'writers', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'season', 'A', 'Story', 'was', 'already', 'developed', 'end', 'Season', '6', 'everybody', 'invested', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'wedding', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'heavy', 'story', 'lines', 'involving', 'other', 'four', 'characters', 'would', 'divide', 'audience', 'attention', 'will', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'allow', 'anything', 'steal', 'Monica', 'thunder', 'High', 'Points', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'Engagement', 'Picture-', 'Rachel', 'teaches', 'Joey', 'how', 'sail-', 'Joey', 'Ross', 'napping', 'secret-', 'Ross', 'library', 'book-', 'Hanukkah', 'story', 'told', 'Holiday', 'Armadillo', 'Santa', 'Superman-', 'One', 'Where', 'Turn', '30-', 'Joey', 'return', ""'Days"", ""Lives'-"", 'Monica', 'ugly', 'truth', 'London', 'Chandler-', 'One', 'Where', ""'re"", 'Up', 'Night', 'probably', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'whole', 'series', 'Joey', ""'Soapie"", 'Award-', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'guest', 'stars', 'Monica', 'Ross', 'hot', 'cousin-', 'Rachel', 'old', 'sorority', 'sister', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'made', 'out', 'college-', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'out', 'Vegas', 'reconcile', 'Chandler', 'father', 'invite', 'weddingThe', 'only', 'throbbing', 'flaw', 'found', 'Season', '7', 'was', '30th', 'birthday', 'episode', 'Rachel', 'birthday', 'proceeds', 'flashbacks', 'everyone', 'else', '30th', 'only', 'problem', 'Season', '1', 'episode', ""'The"", 'Ick', 'Factor', 'Monica', '26', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', '30', 'Season', '5', 'Rachel', 'birthday', 'Season', '7', 'Monica', 'Rachel', 'knew', 'other', 'school', 'have', 'assume', 'were', 'same', 'age', 'just', 'wish', 'time', 'line', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'understand', 'something', 'writers', 'have', 'deal', 'with.Weak', 'Points', 'Monica', 'recover', 'old', 'cookie', 'recipe', 'passed', 'down', 'Phoebe', 'family-', 'Joey', 'lead', 'Mac', 'C.H.E.E.S.E.-', 'One', 'Where', 'Chandler', 'Does', ""n't"", 'Dogs-', 'One', 'Cheap', 'Wedding', 'DressThe', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'simple', 'stall', 'thought', 'writers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'acting', 'was', 'tremendous', 'usual', 'Season', '7', 'also', 'entailed', 'probably', 'most', 'gripping', 'Season', 'Finale', 'series', 'set', 'stage', 'remarkable', 'eighth', 'season', '5', 'star', 'season', 'way', 'slice', 'worst', ""'Friends"", 'still', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'TV.Grade', 'A-']",Friends: Season 7

798507,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B0001AW066,Thayer,"[7, 7]","Season 7 is probably known to the Friends fan community as the dark years probably until Season 10 came along. Everything plunged all at the same time, the ratings, the hype, creativity, personal lives of the cast (Matthew Perry's addiction), and that show called Survivor: Australian Outback. But of course I have to mention that the season was doomed from the very start because critics are already panning the season because they anticipated that the season would be populated by the predictable wedding preparation plotlines for Chandler and Monica's wedding and it didn't help that the season did focus too much to it.But years have passed and people can now view Season 7 without the distraction and preconceptions and I myself think it is a hugely underrated season. Standout episodes have to be TOW Monica's Thunder, TOW Rachel's Assistant, TOW the Nap Partners (very funny, bridesmaid competition), TOW They All Turn Thirty (hugely entertaining episodes, Lisa Kudrow especially stole all scenes she was in), TOW Joey's New Brain, TOW Monica and Ross' Cousin, and the big finale TOW Chandler and Monica's wedding.A lot of people think that Matt le Blanc was the MVP of Season 7 and they could be right. But personally I think Season 7 is one the most ensemble-based seasons of Friends, nobody took really the spotlight. Everybody got a fine share of episodes like Jennifer Aniston in TOW Rachel's Book, David Schwimmer in TOW Monica and Ross' Cousin, Lisa Kudrow in TOW they all turn thirty and TO the Cheesecakes, le blanc in TOW Monica's Thunder and Cox and Perry in TOW Chandler and Monica's Wedding.Compared to other seasons of Friends, season 7 is probably still the weakest but that doesn't say much because the show at it's weakest still delivers superb episodes.Grade: A-",5,Friends Season 7: Surviving The Survivor,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1787,"['Season', '7', 'probably', 'known', 'Friends', 'fan', 'community', 'dark', 'years', 'probably', 'Season', '10', 'came', 'along', 'Everything', 'plunged', 'same', 'time', 'ratings', 'hype', 'creativity', 'personal', 'lives', 'cast', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'addiction', 'show', 'called', 'Survivor', 'Australian', 'Outback', 'course', 'have', 'mention', 'season', 'was', 'doomed', 'very', 'start', 'critics', 'are', 'already', 'panning', 'season', 'anticipated', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'populated', 'predictable', 'wedding', 'preparation', 'plotlines', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'wedding', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'season', 'did', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'it.But', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'people', 'can', 'now', 'view', 'Season', '7', 'distraction', 'preconceptions', 'think', 'hugely', 'underrated', 'season', 'Standout', 'episodes', 'have', 'be', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Thunder', 'TOW', 'Rachel', 'Assistant', 'TOW', 'Nap', 'Partners', 'very', 'funny', 'bridesmaid', 'competition', 'TOW', 'Turn', 'Thirty', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'especially', 'stole', 'scenes', 'was', 'TOW', 'Joey', 'New', 'Brain', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Ross', 'Cousin', 'big', 'finale', 'TOW', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'wedding.A', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'Matt', 'le', 'Blanc', 'was', 'MVP', 'Season', '7', 'could', 'be', 'right', 'personally', 'think', 'Season', '7', 'one', 'most', 'ensemble-based', 'seasons', 'Friends', 'nobody', 'took', 'really', 'spotlight', 'Everybody', 'got', 'fine', 'share', 'episodes', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'TOW', 'Rachel', 'Book', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Ross', 'Cousin', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'TOW', 'turn', 'thirty', 'TO', 'Cheesecakes', 'le', 'blanc', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Thunder', 'Cox', 'Perry', 'TOW', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'Wedding.Compared', 'other', 'seasons', 'Friends', 'season', '7', 'probably', 'still', 'weakest', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'show', 'weakest', 'still', 'superb', 'episodes.Grade', 'A-']",Friends: Season 7

I own the first seven seasons, and they are some of the best DVDs I own.Funniest episodes of FRIENDS: THE COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON are:*The One with Phoebe's Cookies - Any episode with a story based on Phoebe's childhood/family is going to be hilarious, and this one doesn't disappoint. Phoebe's grandma left her the recipe to her top-secret, best-ever chocolate chip cookies, but Phoebe loses the recipe in a fire. Her and Monica go on a mission to recreate the cookies, which ends up with a hilariously ironic conclusion. My favorite episode of the season.*The One where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs - When Phoebe tries to hide a dog in Monica and Chandler's apartment, the gang finds out Chandler's big secret: he hates dogs. This is one of those episodes that you can quote over and over again, with hilarious bits of dialogue (such as: ""You don't like ice cream?"" ""It's too cold!"").*The One with the Holiday Armadillo - All the holiday episodes of Friends are great, and this one is one of the best. Ross wants to teach Ben about Chanukah, and he decides to dress up to make Ben more interested. Somehow he ends up dressed as a giant armadillo, which is worth a ton of laughs.Every episode on FRIENDS: THE COMPLETE SEVENTH SEASON is hilarious. You get to see Chandler and Monica get married, Monica becomes known as the ""candy lady,"" and everyone turns 30/talks about their thirtieth birthdays.Overall grade - A",5,You can't go wrong with Friends DVDs,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,1528,"['huge', 'fan', 'show', 'Friends', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'FRIENDS', 'COMPLETE', 'SEVENTH', 'SEASON', 'DVD', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'own', 'first', 'seven', 'seasons', 'are', 'best', 'DVDs', 'own.Funniest', 'episodes', 'FRIENDS', 'COMPLETE', 'SEVENTH', 'SEASON', 'are', '*The', 'One', 'Phoebe', 'Cookies', 'episode', 'story', 'based', 'Phoebe', 'childhood/family', 'going', 'be', 'hilarious', 'one', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Phoebe', 'grandma', 'left', 'recipe', 'top-secret', 'best-ever', 'chocolate', 'chip', 'cookies', 'Phoebe', 'recipe', 'fire', 'Monica', 'go', 'mission', 'recreate', 'cookies', 'up', 'hilariously', 'ironic', 'conclusion', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', '*The', 'One', 'where', 'Chandler', ""n't"", 'Dogs', 'When', 'Phoebe', 'hide', 'dog', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'apartment', 'gang', 'out', 'Chandler', 'big', 'secret', 'dogs', 'one', 'episodes', 'can', 'quote', 'over', 'again', 'hilarious', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ice', 'cream', 'too', 'cold', '*The', 'One', 'Holiday', 'Armadillo', 'holiday', 'episodes', 'Friends', 'are', 'great', 'one', 'one', 'best', 'Ross', 'teach', 'Ben', 'Chanukah', 'dress', 'up', 'make', 'Ben', 'more', 'interested', 'up', 'dressed', 'giant', 'armadillo', 'ton', 'laughs.Every', 'episode', 'FRIENDS', 'COMPLETE', 'SEVENTH', 'SEASON', 'hilarious', 'get', 'see', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'get', 'married', 'Monica', 'known', 'candy', 'lady', 'everyone', '30/talks', 'thirtieth', 'birthdays.Overall', 'grade', 'A']",Friends: Season 7
