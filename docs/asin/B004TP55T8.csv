1427827,A1ITCVZ46MUB3A,B004TP55T8,A Hot Whizzer Summer...,"[1, 2]","Baka and test follows the story of class F. They go to a unique school where classes are split based on test scores. The best students get all the money and equipment in class A, while the worst students get stuck with nothing in Class F. However, students can earn better supplies and equipment by quite literally battling other classes, using their test scores as their battle points.This anime is absolutely hilarious, filled with tons of visual gags. This is the first anime I have ever watched that I would have no problem watching again and again. I watched one episode twice in a row, and found tons of hilarious things I had completely missed the first time through.The season, in and of itself, is very satisfying. The story starts out strong, sits for most of the mid season, but with good reason, and then ends strongly. You will most likely be satisfied with the ending to. There is another season in progress, but I wonder what will happen to continue the series, which seems to have finished up pretty well.There is not any complete nudity although the anime possesses of some partial nudity. The language is OK as well. The comedy is often very visual with a fair amount of slapstick too. I would highly recommend this anime for anyone who wants a couple of laughs and is OK with some stupid humor.",5,The Funniest Anime I have watched to date,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,1313,"['Baka', 'test', 'story', 'class', 'F.', 'go', 'unique', 'school', 'where', 'classes', 'are', 'split', 'based', 'test', 'scores', 'best', 'students', 'get', 'money', 'equipment', 'class', 'A', 'worst', 'students', 'get', 'stuck', 'nothing', 'Class', 'F.', 'However', 'students', 'can', 'earn', 'better', 'supplies', 'equipment', 'quite', 'literally', 'battling', 'other', 'classes', 'using', 'test', 'scores', 'battle', 'points.This', 'anime', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'filled', 'tons', 'visual', 'gags', 'first', 'anime', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'would', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'twice', 'row', 'found', 'tons', 'hilarious', 'things', 'had', 'completely', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'through.The', 'season', 'very', 'satisfying', 'story', 'out', 'strong', 'sits', 'most', 'mid', 'season', 'good', 'reason', 'then', 'strongly', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'season', 'progress', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'continue', 'series', 'have', 'finished', 'up', 'pretty', 'not', 'complete', 'nudity', 'anime', 'possesses', 'partial', 'nudity', 'language', 'OK', 'as', 'well', 'comedy', 'often', 'very', 'visual', 'fair', 'amount', 'slapstick', 'too', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anime', 'anyone', 'who', 'couple', 'laughs', 'OK', 'stupid', 'humor']",Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - Season One

1427837,A182VTJIIEVM37,B004TP55T8,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 2]","My god, when this anime came out, I was interested with the cute artwork and the story concept and then I ended up being thrown into a wild ride.This anime is hilarious. I ended up laughing in the first episode and the humor never dies down.The story is about how students are basically put in classes based on their test scores (ouch I hate to be in that school). The main character Akihisa is apparently the dumbest guy in the entire school getting the worse grade and ending up in the worse class (F) with pretty much every guy there except his childhood friend Minami who is only there because she couldn't read the kanji after coming back from Germany and Himeji who ended up fainting during the test due to getting a cold. There goal the entire series is to defeat Class A and get out of the dump known as Class F.As the summary suspects, Class F will always have to fail to keep the status quo, but that doesn't stop these action scenes from being cool (as well as the comedy.)All the characters are surprisingly well developed despite following the stereotype. Actually the anime has a point that if class F stays the way they are, they will never be able to defeat Class A so they have to step up their game and develop in order to win and it shows a lot in this series (and the novel does a great job expanding on the characters personalities and backstories). I think the main character Akihisa is the best example of character development. He's the biggest idiot in the series and by maintaining the status quo has actually caused problems for the people around him to the point that his older sister had to move in with him to take care of him (since at the beginning, he doesn't have enough money to pay for anything given he spends it on video games...sounds like me!) Akihisa has shown that despite being an idiot he is talented in other fields such as cooking and if he actually DOES study, he can get a higher score on a test. In the novel, he actually ends up getting good at history to the point that his summon has evolved to the point of being able to beat people in history (he develops a love for history in the novel similar to how Minami's strong point is math and Kouta's strong point is health and PE).With that said, I must confess there is ONE FLAW that makes me rank this anime down. The humor is hilarious, but I think the problem is the double standard that is involved in the comedy. All the males tend to get the blunt of all bad things happening to them, but if everything was gender reversed, it wouldn't be funny (unless the entire school was full of girls). And it gets to the point where you actually feel bad for Akihisa and Yuuji and start to hate the female characters who can brake their bones, poison them and get off scott free despite them starting the problem. I generally hate Shoko as a result. People love her because she's a ""moe-moe yandere"" but she's a straight up ""Jerk Sue"" and all the things she does to Yuuji is straight up domestic abuse. Yes I laugh when she tasers him and drags him to the movie theaters and I do feel sorry for Yuuji when she burned his porn (I still laughed at that), the things that I don't find funny are her poking him in the eye because he wasn't looking in her direction by chance (I hate yandere characters like this), breaking into his house (privacy woman), trying to drown him and then resurrect him (NOT FUNNY. That could have actually killed him compared to the taser) and then trying to force him into marriage multiple times (I don't find this funny because if they're married, that means, she's free to do whatever she wants with him and since she has attempted to get into his pants...I shiver at the thought) and even though the series is saying that Yuuji deserves this treatment and he should be lucky to have a beautiful girl like Shoko, episode 7 was basically everyone saying that this type of abuse is okay and tried to give her a sympathetic moment. My answer is no. Someone like this does not deserve sympathy and most of her antics aren't funny.Alas, this is a funny anime all and all and more people like Shoko than I do (but I hate yandere characters in general) and should watch/buy it whenever you have the time.",4,One of the Funniest Animes Out There With One Major Flaw,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,4221,"['god', 'when', 'anime', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'interested', 'cute', 'artwork', 'story', 'concept', 'then', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'thrown', 'wild', 'ride.This', 'anime', 'hilarious', 'ended', 'up', 'laughing', 'first', 'episode', 'humor', 'never', 'down.The', 'story', 'how', 'students', 'are', 'basically', 'put', 'classes', 'based', 'test', 'scores', 'ouch', 'hate', 'be', 'school', 'main', 'character', 'Akihisa', 'apparently', 'dumbest', 'guy', 'entire', 'school', 'getting', 'worse', 'grade', 'ending', 'up', 'worse', 'class', 'F', 'pretty', 'much', 'guy', 'there', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Minami', 'who', 'only', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'kanji', 'coming', 'back', 'Germany', 'Himeji', 'who', 'ended', 'up', 'fainting', 'test', 'due', 'getting', 'cold', 'goal', 'entire', 'series', 'defeat', 'Class', 'A', 'get', 'dump', 'known', 'Class', 'F.As', 'summary', 'suspects', 'Class', 'F', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'fail', 'keep', 'status', 'quo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'action', 'scenes', 'being', 'cool', 'as', 'well', 'comedy', 'characters', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'developed', 'following', 'stereotype', 'Actually', 'anime', 'point', 'class', 'F', 'way', 'are', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'defeat', 'Class', 'A', 'so', 'have', 'step', 'up', 'game', 'develop', 'order', 'win', 'lot', 'series', 'novel', 'great', 'job', 'expanding', 'characters', 'personalities', 'backstories', 'think', 'main', 'character', 'Akihisa', 'best', 'example', 'character', 'development', 'biggest', 'idiot', 'series', 'maintaining', 'status', 'quo', 'actually', 'caused', 'problems', 'people', 'point', 'older', 'sister', 'had', 'move', 'take', 'care', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'anything', 'given', 'video', 'games', 'Akihisa', 'shown', 'being', 'idiot', 'talented', 'other', 'fields', 'such', 'cooking', 'actually', 'DOES', 'study', 'can', 'get', 'higher', 'score', 'test', 'novel', 'actually', 'up', 'getting', 'good', 'history', 'point', 'summon', 'evolved', 'point', 'being', 'able', 'beat', 'people', 'history', 'love', 'history', 'novel', 'similar', 'how', 'Minami', 'strong', 'point', 'math', 'Kouta', 'strong', 'point', 'health', 'PE', '.With', 'said', 'must', 'confess', 'ONE', 'FLAW', 'rank', 'anime', 'down', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'think', 'problem', 'double', 'standard', 'involved', 'comedy', 'males', 'tend', 'get', 'blunt', 'bad', 'things', 'happening', 'everything', 'was', 'gender', 'reversed', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'funny', 'entire', 'school', 'was', 'full', 'girls', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'feel', 'bad', 'Akihisa', 'Yuuji', 'start', 'hate', 'female', 'characters', 'who', 'can', 'brake', 'bones', 'poison', 'get', 'off', 'scott', 'free', 'starting', 'problem', 'generally', 'hate', 'Shoko', 'result', 'People', 'love', 'moe-moe', 'yandere', 'straight', 'Jerk', 'Sue', 'things', 'Yuuji', 'straight', 'up', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Yes', 'laugh', 'when', 'movie', 'theaters', 'do', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Yuuji', 'when', 'burned', 'porn', 'still', 'laughed', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'are', 'poking', 'eye', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'direction', 'chance', 'hate', 'yandere', 'characters', 'breaking', 'house', 'privacy', 'woman', 'trying', 'drown', 'then', 'resurrect', 'NOT', 'FUNNY', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'killed', 'compared', 'taser', 'then', 'trying', 'force', 'marriage', 'multiple', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', ""'re"", 'married', 'free', 'do', 'attempted', 'get', 'pants', 'shiver', 'thought', 'even', 'series', 'saying', 'Yuuji', 'treatment', 'should', 'be', 'lucky', 'have', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Shoko', 'episode', '7', 'was', 'basically', 'everyone', 'saying', 'type', 'abuse', 'okay', 'tried', 'give', 'sympathetic', 'moment', 'answer', 'Someone', 'not', 'deserve', 'sympathy', 'most', 'antics', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny.Alas', 'funny', 'anime', 'more', 'people', 'Shoko', 'do', 'hate', 'yandere', 'characters', 'general', 'should', 'watch/buy', 'whenever', 'have', 'time']",Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - Season One

The students are placed in their class according to their test scores. A is the highest and F is the lowest. Yoshi is in class F. The students at the school settle their differences by battling with avatars. The winners get school equipment from the losers. Because of this, class F uses cardboard boxes for tables and doesn't have chairs. Despite being a class of dummies, there are some pretty interesting characters in class F. 2 of them happen to be pretty girls, and they both have a crush on Yoshi. One of them is a tomboy that is pretty much catnip for lesbians, and the other is a sweet and charming girl that every guy is nuts over. One of these girls may just win Yoshii's affections, but will he have to survive the avatar battles and stave off hunger before he can focus on that stuff.This anime is pretty fun. There are some interesting characters, and some great comedy. The animation is really great, and the soundtrack is cool. My only complaint with this one is the story. Baka and Test doesn't really have one. It's basically just goofiness. There's nothing wrong with that. School Rumble proves that an anime can survive off of goofiness, but this is nowhere near that funny. This series could easily be awesome, but the lack of drama halts it at above average.

1427846,AFV2584U13XP3,B004TP55T8,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[2, 4]","At first I wasn't sure what to make of the series but after seeing the whole season it turned out to be both endearing and very entertaining as you see the class of 2-F try their hands from everything from study hall to teen romance.  The small basic short info is you have the class of 2-F the supposed losers of school who try their best to get out from their reputation as being the school idiots,  our beloved male teen character Akihisa Yoshii who while not the best academically(Though he is a very good cook) tries his best to preserve the dignity of his friends in class 2-F as well as keep happy his romantic love interest Mizuki Himeji a well endowed female student who though is in class 2-F possesses a high IQ but because of a mishap has been placed in the lowest class instead.  Of course the series has a side part where the students can summon a pokeman style avatar to fight for them in school battles,  you see if one class battles another and wins they can switch their class equipment for the defeated class ones and this is especially helpful as the lower rank classes have poorer mediocre equipment then the higher ranked classes do which is one of the basic reasons for these class duels.  Almost all the characters are endearing even some of the bullies from the upper classes and throughout the series you'll see relationships start between supposed rivals as well as a few unrequited relationships as well.  The animation is very enjoyable to watch and the soundtrack fits the series hilarity very good,  the voice cast for the subbed and dubbed fit their character roles very well too and as you hear them bring the emotional effects in their roles during scenes especially the hilarious scenes you be very much entertained as well as let out a laugh or two.  I haven't looked at the Blu-ray edition yet so I can't tell you if the video quality is more noticeable than with the standard dvd though with the regular dvds the video quality is still excellent.  So if you're looking for the next hilarious anime or just a good series one here's a very enjoyable one to try out....UPDATE 08-13-11I forgot to put this info out a few days ago so my apologies,  someone asked if this set has any extras and yes it does the regular dvds in this set are three.  Two of the dvds have the series on them and the third has the added bonus features on it and it is surprisingly entertaining.  Added on the bonus dvd other then the promotional commercials,  textless intro/ending songs are some cure little anime shorts of the beloved characters of the series.  There are about three short anime stories from about three to five minutes long,  the one I think most people will enjoy the most is where we have the main students from class 2-F and two from class 2-A playing a game called king where the winner can order any of the other participants to do whatever they want  and the hilarious hijinx that happen when we see who wins the power of a king.  I haven't checked out the Blu-ray dvds yet but I think the bonus features are on the second blu-ray but I'm not sure,  but still enjoy the entertaining anime shorts regardless with the regular dvd I'm sure you'll let out a laugh or two after watching them...",5,Entertaining Series But Sad To See It's So Short,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,3226,"['first', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'series', 'seeing', 'whole', 'season', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'endearing', 'very', 'entertaining', 'see', 'class', '2-F', 'try', 'hands', 'everything', 'study', 'hall', 'teen', 'romance', 'small', 'basic', 'short', 'info', 'have', 'class', '2-F', 'supposed', 'losers', 'school', 'who', 'try', 'best', 'get', 'out', 'reputation', 'being', 'school', 'idiots', 'beloved', 'male', 'teen', 'character', 'Akihisa', 'Yoshii', 'who', 'not', 'best', 'academically', 'very', 'good', 'cook', 'best', 'preserve', 'dignity', 'friends', 'class', '2-F', 'as', 'well', 'keep', 'happy', 'romantic', 'love', 'interest', 'Mizuki', 'Himeji', 'well', 'endowed', 'female', 'student', 'who', 'class', '2-F', 'high', 'IQ', 'mishap', 'been', 'placed', 'lowest', 'class', 'instead', 'course', 'series', 'side', 'part', 'where', 'students', 'can', 'summon', 'pokeman', 'style', 'avatar', 'fight', 'school', 'battles', 'see', 'one', 'class', 'can', 'switch', 'class', 'equipment', 'defeated', 'class', 'ones', 'especially', 'helpful', 'lower', 'rank', 'classes', 'have', 'poorer', 'mediocre', 'equipment', 'then', 'higher', 'ranked', 'classes', 'do', 'one', 'basic', 'reasons', 'class', 'duels', 'Almost', 'characters', 'are', 'endearing', 'even', 'bullies', 'upper', 'classes', 'series', ""'ll"", 'see', 'relationships', 'start', 'supposed', 'rivals', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'unrequited', 'relationships', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'hilarity', 'very', 'good', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'fit', 'character', 'roles', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'hear', 'bring', 'emotional', 'effects', 'roles', 'scenes', 'especially', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'entertained', 'as', 'well', 'let', 'out', 'laugh', 'two', 'have', ""n't"", 'looked', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'yet', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'video', 'quality', 'more', 'noticeable', 'standard', 'dvd', 'regular', 'dvds', 'video', 'quality', 'still', 'excellent', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'next', 'hilarious', 'anime', 'just', 'good', 'series', 'one', 'here', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'try', 'out', '.UPDATE', '08-13-11I', 'forgot', 'put', 'info', 'out', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'apologies', 'someone', 'asked', 'set', 'extras', 'yes', 'regular', 'dvds', 'set', 'are', 'three', 'Two', 'dvds', 'have', 'series', 'third', 'added', 'bonus', 'features', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining', 'Added', 'bonus', 'other', 'then', 'promotional', 'commercials', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'are', 'cure', 'little', 'anime', 'shorts', 'beloved', 'characters', 'series', 'are', 'three', 'short', 'anime', 'stories', 'three', 'five', 'minutes', 'long', 'one', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'enjoy', 'most', 'where', 'have', 'main', 'students', 'class', '2-F', 'two', 'class', '2-A', 'playing', 'game', 'called', 'king', 'where', 'winner', 'can', 'order', 'other', 'participants', 'do', 'want', 'hilarious', 'hijinx', 'when', 'see', 'who', 'power', 'king', 'have', ""n't"", 'checked', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'dvds', 'yet', 'think', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'second', 'blu-ray', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'still', 'enjoy', 'entertaining', 'anime', 'shorts', 'regardless', 'regular', 'dvd', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'let', 'out', 'laugh', 'two', 'watching']",Baka & Test: Summon the Beasts - Season One
1427847,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B004TP55T8,Sean,"[0, 1]","f you were to take anime as art reflecting the real world you would figure Japanese high schools to be places full of huge chested girls, oblivious guys who don't realize that six girls want to pork him, and you'd probably get the idea that Japanese high school kids get nosebleeds upon seeing the cleavage of a woman. These are not actually true as Japanese high schools are not much better than any other high schools and the only reason anime treats high school as a place of fun, violence, chests, and more chests is because it makes high school a much more exciting place than it actually is.Baka and Test reflects the real world almost as well as the Jersey Shore. It is in fact so opposite of the real world it is probably a mirror dimension. The high school is a place of tests, tests, and more tests. Upon entrance, you take a test that decides what class you will be in, A through F. F is of course the idiots and A is the nerds. F students have to deal with crappy wooden tables and pillows while A gets personal desks, lounge chairs, tables, a refreshment bar, and a giant wall of television screens. Our hero is Yoshi, a complete idiot who has a friend in Himeji, a very smart girl who wound up in the F class for getting sick and leaving during the placement test, thus giving her a zero. Together with their friends in the class they battle their way to the top through the use of avatars. Everyone in the school has one that has stats dependent on how well they do on tests in various subjects. Thus, the higher the grade, the harder their avatars hit. It's pretty much a school version of a JRPG where instead of health potions, students run to take recovery tests during battles to regain lost hit points. It's a rather smart idea I must say and actually works out kind of well. I don't think watching people compare test scores and take tests has been this exciting.This plot of the underdogs taking on the big guys is of course a clich&eacute; but works perfectly well here due to the peppering of strange and eclectic characters that ultimately lends this series the comedy aspect it should be known for. The plot is both downright ridiculous and hilarious and while there is not a lot of plot to go around, there is enough to add some semi-serious bits in throughout.There are a couple of problems with the plot. There is a lot of romance being thrown around and it doesn't really go anywhere. A love letter by a certain character is never given to another certain character despite this love letter being a main point of the plot. Another thing I found was I don't understand the science behind an avatar being hurt and Yoshi feeling it. Nobody else can feel their avatar's being hurt, only Yoshi can because of his terrible scores, but it still seems nonsensical. But that's just a tiny complaint that shouldn't even matter considering I'm watching a show to laugh, not get a deep, engaging, realistic plot.And I did laugh, and so will you. This show is replete with sexual humor that may turn some people away but when an anime uses Apocalypse Now Redux in a joke, I think it deserves a cookie. On top of that was a random cameo by Miku Hatsune (whose back is turned in Class B) and it also references other anime. Yes, it does have lots of chests. And as I've previously stated, chests do not a good joke make. This anime somehow made me laugh at chests. That's right. I laughed at boob jokes. I didn't laugh at the constant use of Himeji's breasts and Yoshi's sister's breasts as some form of fan service I guess, but I did laugh at Shimada's constantly comparing her breasts to Himeji's and being jealous. The overabundance of boobies also spills over into how characters act, which creates a particularly silly character but we'll talk about him in a moment.The animation is nothing fantastic. It has this look as if it were a colored-in manga but it's not a style I found particularly appealing. The dots everywhere and the sometimes rather dull colors made it seem like an older anime, maybe 2005-ish. The animation also seemed rather lackluster in the fight scenes where a lot of the time we see an overhead view with little circles representing the characters instead of watching the characters actually fight. While this is not a huge issue, I feel as if the animators were lazy when producing these segments.Sound quality is actually good. I committed high treason and watched the dub which turned out to be rather pleasant. None of the voices were grating and I felt that it actually kept the integrity of the original script without taking away any of the funny bits. Now the opening and closing on the other hand are another matter altogether. The opening is lame and basic and could have been tacked onto anything. The ending is meh, not bad but not particularly good.The characters are what make this show what it is. Yoshi is the oblivious idiot, a character archetypical of the genre but hilarious nonetheless. Himeji has big boobs and about as little personality as one would expect from the love interest. Shimada is the hot-headed and overly violent girl who does not like her tiny boobs being made fun of. She likes Yoshi, as does Himeji though they never fight over him. They seem to be a unified effort all the time. The problem with Shimada is the fact that another girl is in love with her and is stalking the crap out of her. The same can actually be said of Yoshi who is being teased by a gay guy from Class A a lot of times.Class representative of class F, Sakamoto is in a contract with the representative of A, Kirishima. Kirishima wants to marry him and does everything she can to be with him while Sakamoto wants nothing to do with it leading to some hilarious moments.Hideyoshi is quite possibly one of the most interesting and hilarious characters of the show. A guy who looks like a girl but constantly dresses like a girl for whatever reason. The girls are jealous of how hot he is as a girl and the guys all seem to find him attractive as well. This leads to utter confusion half the time and while Hideyoshi's character is never explained (why does he dress like a girl if he wants to be treated as a guy?) he still provides enough hilarious moments to make that question void.Finally, Kouta is a hentai who takes pictures of everyone's boobs and panties and is constantly dying of nosebleeds. He has started a book on the boobs of all the girls in the school. He is utterly hilarious.And we can't forget Iron Man, the remedial class teacher. When a student dies during a battle with their avatars Iron Man swoops in like a superhero and takes them to remedial classes. This guy is freaking great.There's also Yoshi's sister who seems to want to have sex with him. I won't explain any further because the anime doesn't either.What else is there to say about this show? It made me laugh every episode and while it may feel a little inconsistent at times (the semi-serious episodes and the flat out comedy episodes aren't mixed together proportionally) it still is one of the most entertaining comedy anime I've seen. Sure it doesn't wrap up tightly, sure it doesn't have an amazing story, but who cares? It's freaking hilarious. The characters are not all original but all together make a memorable group of idiots. The action isn't real well done but is negated by the absolutely laugh out loud writing. There are lots of jiggly boobies for all the fan boys but also a lot of jokes concerning both American and Japanese culture.It's a fun ride that a fan of comedy anime may want to take if he or she hasn't already. I found it to be more entertaining then it should be, but loved it all the more for that.I'm giving Baka and Test a 7.5/10",4,Fan Service,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,7702,"['f', 'were', 'take',
