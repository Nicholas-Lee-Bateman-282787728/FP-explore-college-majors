Don't expect the obvious, slapstick-based French humor of a Francis Veber movie.But this movie pretends to be more than a comedy. I have to agree with the other reviewer who called this &quot;pretentious French nonsense.&quot; That's pretty much what this is -- take it from a foreign film fan who has several French movies on his all-time favorites list.This is the sort of film where the characters almost always say the opposite of what they feel -- just for effect. Rarely is there any real dialogue. All the characters (unlikable, for the most part) tend to make pronouncements that have nothing to do with what the other character just said.The main character, in particular, is unbearable. In this movie, he is irresistibly attractive to men and women alike, but the source of his allure remains a mystery throughout. We see him as selfish, uninteresting, depressed, confused and entirely unaware of his internal thoughts and feelings.I'd recommend giving this a pass.",1,Confusion of intent,1081641600,"04 11, 2004",2004,1083,"['What', 'was', 'intent', 'film', 'Oh', 'yes', 'call', 'comedy', 'suppose', 'very', 'dry', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'obvious', 'slapstick-based', 'French', 'humor', 'Francis', 'Veber', 'movie.But', 'movie', 'be', 'more', 'comedy', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'who', 'called', 'quot', 'pretentious', 'French', 'nonsense.', 'quot', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'take', 'foreign', 'film', 'fan', 'who', 'several', 'French', 'movies', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'list.This', 'sort', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'almost', 'always', 'say', 'opposite', 'what', 'feel', 'just', 'effect', 'Rarely', 'there', 'real', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'unlikable', 'most', 'part', 'tend', 'make', 'pronouncements', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'what', 'other', 'character', 'just', 'said.The', 'main', 'character', 'particular', 'unbearable', 'movie', 'irresistibly', 'attractive', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'source', 'allure', 'mystery', 'see', 'selfish', 'uninteresting', 'depressed', 'confused', 'entirely', 'unaware', 'internal', 'thoughts', 'feelings.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'giving', 'pass']",N/A

It's rather dark and ugly story, and if you like to connect with at least one character, you'll be hard-pressed to do it in the movie.  If anyone, I felt sorry for Christophe, the young man who would have done anything for Alain, except Alain was incapable of commitment and coming to terms with his sexuality.  While the story line is a common theme, I found the film at times slow and disconnected.  Although I cared less for most of the characters, the acting itself was good.  Nothing outstanding from the standpoint of cinematography.  I see it's listed as a ""romantic satire"" - don't be fooled. What I recall most from the film is how a series of people with apparent low self-worth chase about the confused and disrespecting Alain.  if this theme catches your fancy for 90 minutes, have at it.

781553,A2BRVLLGGLX08G,B0000E6FOP,Cookie Crook,"[2, 4]","Confusion of Genders, directed by Ilan Duran Cohen, looks at the lives of several young people living in the city. Alain (Pascal Gregory) and Laurence (Nathalie Richard) play lawyers who are sleeping with each other and sometimes love each other, then hate each other then love each other again. Alain as it turns out is bi-sexual or gay (not really sure) and develops a strong sexual relationship for Christophre (Cyrille Thouvenin) a young farm boy. This story only becomes more disorganized when one of Alain clients Marc (Vincent Martinez) wants him to deliver a message to his ex-girlfriend Babbette (Julie Guyet) and if Alain does this then he will have sex with him. Alain wants this in the beginning, but then develops feeling for Babbett, while still having feelings for Christophre and also for Laurence.If you have made it through all this, then you can see why Confusion of Genders really starts to deteriate at a rapid pace from having potential of developing real human emotions and relations to a free for all in the sack. The main character, Alain, acts like a hormonal teenager trying to screw anything with a hole and Laurence keeps taking this man back; you wonder were her smarts are (she is a lawyer) . The director does nothing to steer this film in anyway and just lets it meander until it could be an advertisement for an STD commercial. This movie does nothing to explore human emotion or how genders effect those emotions/relationships, but adds only chaos and revulsion to be in any type of relationship with people who really don't love themselves.",2,Gender Benders,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,1576,"['Confusion', 'Genders', 'directed', 'Ilan', 'Duran', 'Cohen', 'lives', 'several', 'young', 'people', 'living', 'city', 'Alain', 'Pascal', 'Gregory', 'Laurence', 'Nathalie', 'Richard', 'play', 'lawyers', 'who', 'are', 'sleeping', 'other', 'sometimes', 'love', 'other', 'then', 'hate', 'other', 'then', 'love', 'other', 'again', 'out', 'bi-sexual', 'gay', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'strong', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Christophre', 'Cyrille', 'Thouvenin', 'young', 'farm', 'boy', 'story', 'only', 'more', 'disorganized', 'when', 'one', 'Alain', 'clients', 'Marc', 'Vincent', 'Martinez', 'deliver', 'message', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Babbette', 'Julie', 'Guyet', 'Alain', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'sex', 'Alain', 'beginning', 'then', 'feeling', 'Babbett', 'still', 'having', 'feelings', 'Christophre', 'also', 'Laurence.If', 'have', 'made', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Confusion', 'Genders', 'really', 'deteriate', 'rapid', 'pace', 'having', 'potential', 'developing', 'real', 'human', 'emotions', 'relations', 'free', 'sack', 'main', 'character', 'Alain', 'hormonal', 'teenager', 'trying', 'screw', 'anything', 'hole', 'Laurence', 'taking', 'man', 'back', 'wonder', 'were', 'smarts', 'are', 'lawyer', 'director', 'nothing', 'steer', 'film', 'anyway', 'just', 'lets', 'meander', 'could', 'be', 'advertisement', 'STD', 'commercial', 'movie', 'nothing', 'explore', 'human', 'emotion', 'how', 'genders', 'effect', 'emotions/relationships', 'only', 'chaos', 'revulsion', 'be', 'type', 'relationship', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'love']",N/A

781555,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000E6FOP,Grady Harp,"[5, 6]","CONFUSION OF GENDERS  is one of those odd Gallic films that mixes angst with social comment, a generous dollop of both heterosexual and homosexual trysts, Gallic humor, and bizarre philosophy - and it does so with considerable panache.  While some would categorize this as a cerebral sexual romp, the quality of the film as directed by Ilan Duran Cohen is indeed fast paced but covers more comment about contemporary sexual mores than most.Alain (Pascal Greggory) is a lawyer working for Laurence (Nathalie Richard), is frankly bisexual, and the two volley the concept of a marriage of convenience.  Though Alain is frank with Laurence that he prefers men sexually, he does want a normal life and family.  Enter Christophe (Cyrille Thouvenin) a very young lad who prefers older men and within moments Alain is bedding Christophe.  Yet he also has a physical liaison with Laurence.  Alain is assigned a case of a prisoner up for murder and in visiting Marc (Vincent Martinez) in the prison, Alain is asked to contact Marc's girlfriend Babette (Julie Guyet) to transmit his messages of love - in return for proposed sexual favors for Alain!  Alain's interplay with Babette is yet another excursion into exploring relationships.How these disparate characters intertwine both in and out of bed and the consequences of the acting out the spectrum of sexuality is comical yet also with a tinge of reality that results in life changes for most of the people involved.  Each of the actors is excellent and there is enough eye candy for viewers in search of same!  And though some may react as though this were a French soap opera for the big screen, there is a lot more food for thought that develops after the final closing scenes.  Recommended for those who enjoy double entendres.  In French with English subtitles.

Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[0, 0]","In ""Confusion of Genders,"" French director Ilan Duran Cohen's central character Alain (Pascal Greggory) has so many sexual alliances that you literally have to draw a diagram with him in the center and arrrows pointing to his many lovers to keep the story straight. (No pun intended.) He and his legal colleague Laurence (Nathalie Richard) manage to make a baby although they each acknowledge that they are not in love with each other. (""Love is a prison."" On the other hand, someone in the film opines that ""a marriage of convenience is so sad."") Then Alain is pursued-- and caught-- by the young frisky Christophe (Cyrille Thouvenin) and they eventually move in together while the pregnant Laurence is pretty much left on her own. (One of the most erotic scenes in the film has Christophe and Alain brushing their teeth while wearing only their underwear.) Alain also gets a crush on a client of his, Marc, (Vincent Martinez) who is in prison for murder and wants him to be the go-between to take messages to his girlfriend Babette (Julie Gayet), a quite beautiful hairdresser. As you would suspect by now, Alain is attracted to her as well.To call Alain indecisive is an understatement. While his ego must be bursting with all these different people of both sexes vying for his affection, I had trouble grasping his charisma. But then I'm not French. The movie, on the other hand, is beautifully filmed.
