77958,A2H0T0PY5IMEFX,0788600931,Alan Dale Daniel,"[122, 141]","This DVD is a good overview of the assassination of Kennedy.  True, it does focus on the conspiracy theories and it is not an unbiased look at the evidence; however, the interviews with people who have a lot to say are engrossing and the ""evidence"" produced is thought provoking.There is no doubt that evidence exists to dispute the findings of the Warren Commission report on the assassination of President Kennedy.  This DVD presents a lot of that evidence in a organized fashion.  It is good to actually see the people interviewed who say the shots were coming from the grassy knoll.  I liked looking at the photographic evidence that critics claim show a person (badge man) shooting from the knoll (I don't see anything).  The DVD at least allows you to see the people and the evidence and make a lot of judgments for yourself.A lot of the witnesses are not convincing to me, and a lot of the so called evidence just looks like junk.  I have a natural tendency to distrust testimony from strippers (or former strippers) and I don't see what others say is clearly present in certain photographs.  I am a lawyer (not a trial lawyer) so I suppose I look at evidence a little differently than most and probably take a more skeptical view, but I still like to see it myself and not let someone else tell me what something shows or who to believe.I think the DVD does raise significant questions about the killing of the President as presented by the Warren Report on the assassination.  I have read portions of the Warren Report and I have read a few books on this subject authored by both the critics and those who support the Commission's conclusions.  While I would say this DVD does contain some speculation that is impossible for the viewer to make an independent decision on, and it contains a lot of language that is less than clinical, it does present a lot of solid evidence.  Actual interviews with the Dallas police officers who were there and who talked with Oswald and Ruby are just invaluable.  So are a lot of the other interviews.  Just a list of those who have been sent to an early grave that had facts to support a shot being fired from the grassy knoll is unnerving.  To see some of those same people on screen telling their story near in time to the killing of the President is compelling.  If you believe what they have to say a lot of the Warren Commission's findings are not accurate.If you are not interested in mysteries this isn't for you.  In the end there are a lot of theories that can be supported depending on which set of facts you find to be most important.  The assassination of President Kennedy is a mystery because so much is left unexplained.  For example, there is no doubt the evidence in the National Archives has been corrupted.  The brain is missing and at least some other evidence has disappeared.  Once evidence has been tampered with a person is allowed to believe it is all under suspicion.  The evidence is the foundation of analysis, and when that is gone mystery remains.So the viewer will not get a solid ""we have it all figured out"" explanation at the end.  No murderer jumps up to confess in the last scene and reveal all.  The mystery remains and the uncomfortable feeling that comes with mystery - real mystery - is there.  We will probably never figure it out because the list of ""oops"" or whatever is almost endless.  Criminal incompetence on the part of the Secret Service, incompetent medical examiners, missing evidence, incompetent police procedures, consistent failures to follow even the most elemental criminal evidence protection steps, failures to tape or record critical interrogations, failure to follow up important information, investigators ignoring certain aspects of the case (who were the men who displayed Secret Service credentials to the police on the day of the murder), inconsistent statements from important witnesses etc.  This is a real mystery.A lot of people are murdered every year without explanation.  The real world can be a messy and inhospitable place.  We tend to want to think that the murder of the President of the United States would be different.  With some of the best police agencies in the world working on the case we could figure it out and close the file and be at least comfortable with the idea that we know what happened.  This film will not allow you to think that way.  This was a messy event with a lot going wrong - as it usually does - and this DVD lets you know that.  No nice world tied up in a nice package with a bow on it.  No...this is reality.  And a lot of it.A very good DVD and well worth the price.",5,Detailed Review,1079481600,"03 17, 2004",2004,4620,"['DVD', 'good', 'overview', 'assassination', 'Kennedy', 'True', 'focus', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'not', 'unbiased', 'look', 'evidence', 'however', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'say', 'are', 'engrossing', 'evidence', 'produced', 'thought', 'provoking.There', 'doubt', 'evidence', 'exists', 'dispute', 'findings', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'report', 'assassination', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'DVD', 'lot', 'evidence', 'organized', 'fashion', 'good', 'actually', 'see', 'people', 'interviewed', 'who', 'say', 'shots', 'were', 'coming', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'liked', 'looking', 'photographic', 'evidence', 'critics', 'claim', 'show', 'person', 'man', 'shooting', 'knoll', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'DVD', 'least', 'allows', 'see', 'people', 'evidence', 'make', 'lot', 'judgments', 'yourself.A', 'lot', 'witnesses', 'are', 'not', 'convincing', 'lot', 'so', 'called', 'evidence', 'just', 'junk', 'have', 'natural', 'tendency', 'distrust', 'testimony', 'strippers', 'former', 'strippers', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'others', 'say', 'clearly', 'present', 'certain', 'photographs', 'am', 'lawyer', 'not', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'so', 'suppose', 'look', 'evidence', 'little', 'differently', 'most', 'probably', 'take', 'more', 'skeptical', 'view', 'still', 'see', 'not', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'tell', 'what', 'something', 'shows', 'who', 'believe.I', 'think', 'DVD', 'raise', 'significant', 'questions', 'killing', 'President', 'presented', 'Warren', 'Report', 'assassination', 'have', 'read', 'portions', 'Warren', 'Report', 'have', 'read', 'few', 'books', 'subject', 'authored', 'critics', 'who', 'support', 'Commission', 'conclusions', 'would', 'say', 'DVD', 'contain', 'speculation', 'impossible', 'viewer', 'make', 'independent', 'decision', 'lot', 'language', 'less', 'clinical', 'present', 'lot', 'solid', 'evidence', 'Actual', 'interviews', 'Dallas', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'who', 'talked', 'Oswald', 'Ruby', 'are', 'just', 'invaluable', 'So', 'are', 'lot', 'other', 'interviews', 'Just', 'list', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'early', 'grave', 'had', 'facts', 'support', 'shot', 'being', 'fired', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'unnerving', 'see', 'same', 'people', 'screen', 'telling', 'story', 'time', 'killing', 'President', 'compelling', 'believe', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'lot', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'findings', 'are', 'not', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'mysteries', ""n't"", 'end', 'are', 'lot', 'theories', 'can', 'be', 'supported', 'depending', 'set', 'facts', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'assassination', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'mystery', 'so', 'much', 'left', 'unexplained', 'example', 'doubt', 'evidence', 'National', 'Archives', 'been', 'corrupted', 'brain', 'missing', 'least', 'other', 'evidence', 'disappeared', 'Once', 'evidence', 'been', 'tampered', 'person', 'allowed', 'believe', 'suspicion', 'evidence', 'foundation', 'analysis', 'when', 'gone', 'mystery', 'remains.So', 'viewer', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'solid', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'explanation', 'end', 'murderer', 'up', 'confess', 'last', 'scene', 'reveal', 'mystery', 'uncomfortable', 'feeling', 'mystery', 'real', 'mystery', 'there', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'list', 'oops', 'almost', 'endless', 'Criminal', 'incompetence', 'part', 'Secret', 'Service', 'incompetent', 'medical', 'examiners', 'missing', 'evidence', 'incompetent', 'police', 'procedures', 'consistent', 'failures', 'follow', 'even', 'most', 'elemental', 'criminal', 'evidence', 'protection', 'steps', 'failures', 'tape', 'record', 'critical', 'interrogations', 'failure', 'follow', 'up', 'important', 'information', 'investigators', 'ignoring', 'certain', 'aspects', 'case', 'who', 'were', 'men', 'who', 'displayed', 'Secret', 'Service', 'credentials', 'police', 'day', 'murder', 'inconsistent', 'statements', 'important', 'witnesses', 'etc', 'real', 'mystery.A', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'murdered', 'year', 'explanation', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'messy', 'inhospitable', 'place', 'tend', 'want', 'think', 'murder', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'best', 'police', 'agencies', 'world', 'working', 'case', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'close', 'file', 'be', 'least', 'comfortable', 'idea', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'think', 'way', 'was', 'messy', 'event', 'lot', 'going', 'wrong', 'usually', 'DVD', 'know', 'nice', 'world', 'tied', 'up', 'nice', 'package', 'bow', 'reality', 'lot', 'it.A', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'well', 'price']",The Men Who Killed Kennedy VHS
77959,AGEIT17HENDIS,0788600931,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 10]","Those of us who are interested in history often come across situations where we have to defend the notion that there are conspiracies in history but not all history is a conspiracy. In modern times, with the possible future exception of 9/11, the `mystery' of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963 has played into the hands of those who see history merely as a conspiracy. I have read more than my fair share of books on the subject, most recently the late Norman Mailer's book on Oswald, and here I review a documentary from 1988 that, in essence, merely adds fuel to the fire of that controversy. At this remove however, in 2008, I think it is clear that the conspiracy mongers have had their day on the subject and have come up short. Not through lack of trying, though.Given my leftward political trajectory since the time of the assassination one would think that I would be amenable to some theory of high-level governmental, corporate or criminal conspiracy. As a teenager I campaigned for Kennedy in 1960. I was shocked and dismayed by his murder, throwing away a political notebook that I kept and swearing off politics forever. That resolve obviously did not last long. I am, moreover, more than willing to believe that governmental officials, corporate officers and criminal masterminds are willing to anything to keep their positions of power. However, it just does not wash here. Part of the problem is there are just too many theories to fit the facts.The real problem with the various conspiracy theories is that they ask us to suspend disbelieve for their theories even greater than the botched up job that the Warren Commission provided. These theories inevitably work between the lines of that report. I think the classic example in this documentary, that can stand for my opinion in general, is when one of the conspiracy theorists very calmly states his propositions about how the Warren Report botched things and then, as calmly cites four possible groups of conspirators who could have done the deed, anti-Castro Cubans, disgruntled CIA rogue elements, disgruntled militarists and Mafia-types. Well that narrows the field considerably, doesn't it?But here is the kicker- I am convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald was capable of doing the murder by himself, that he did it and that he stands before history as having done it. Grand conspiracy theories that deny the role of the individual in history do so in this case for no apparent reason. That `theory' may not be sexy enough for some but Oswald should have his fifteen minutes of fame. Unless someone produces the `smoking gun' missing in all other theories-in short, a real named person (or persons) who did the deed let us leave it at that.",4,Who Killed John F.

Two of the men that were implicated as the trigger men in this video were shown to be at France in prison during the time of the assasination. I actually think this should NOT ever be shown on the History channel since so much of this video has shown to be completely wrong.Still it is fun to watch, for the real story read ""Reclaiming History"" which makes a lot more sense overall, though it is a long read. The book is really strong on Oswald's background. I learned a lot that I did not know though I have been reading about the JFK assasination for years on end.It is really hard to prove a conspiracy DIDN'T happen. If you just stick to the actual evidence, it points to Oswald acted alone (and if you read his background it is not all that surprising).The evidence on Oswald is overwhelming.

This film does not seem to try to focus on anyone theory, which I found refreshing. This documentary, rather, attempts to look at the events in Dallas and events afterwards as seen through the eyes of many different people.  There are, for example, interviews with the doctors at Parkland that inform the viewer of their valiant attempts to resucitate the President, funeral director Paul Groody who explains what happened when agents approached him about scars on Oswald's body, and how an exhumation was done in 1981 to confirm the identity of the body. There are interviews with Dallas policeman who recount the arrest of Oswald, and the televised murder of Oswald. The New Orlean's connection is also included with interviews of Jim Garrison who explains his theory about the role that Guy Bannister was suppposed to have played in the assasssination.  One of the most interesting theories is toward the beginning in which the viewer is told of an elaborate plot involving the Corsicans! The new photographic evidence supplied here by Gary Mack has probably caused some to rethink the events in Dallas.

77973,A1FDW1SPYKB354,0788600931,David Von Pein,"[12, 41]","The A&E; documentary series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" is a very popular multi-part program, with many people boldly proclaiming that it ""proves a conspiracy existed to kill President Kennedy in 1963"". But, in my personal opinion, such conspiracy-""proving"" declarations are misplaced when it comes to ""TMWKK"" or any of the other ""Pro-CT"" books, videos, or TV shows that have been showered upon the public since the day JFK was slain on a Dallas street on November 22nd, 1963.Virtually everything within the 9-part mini-series TMWKK (the first six of which were released on home video in both VHS and DVD formats) that the program's producers tout as evidence of conspiracy has been explained in non-conspiratorial ways both before and since these episodes originally aired.I'm a ""Lone-Nutter"" and am not the least bit bashful in admitting to that less-than-widely-popular assassination stance. I firmly believe that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting all by himself, took his $21 mail-order Mannlicher-Carcano rifle with him to work at the Texas School Book Depository on the morning of 11/22/63, and got extremely lucky when he found he had the whole sixth floor of that building to himself at precisely the time when JFK's motorcade slowly drove through Dealey Plaza at 12:30 PM on that Friday afternoon. Oswald then squeezed off three shots from his bolt-action military rifle in approximately 8.2 seconds, killing the President and severely wounding Texas Governor John Connally.Every last bit of the physical evidence (and a whole bunch of circumstantial evidence as well) leads to the above ""LN"" scenario involving only Lee Oswald being the true scenario with respect to who killed John Kennedy.There is so much evidence to show that Oswald was the lone killer of JFK that lawyer and author Vincent T. Bugliosi was prompted to make the following gutsy statement in 1986:""Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming that he carried out the tragic shooting all by himself. In fact, you could throw 80 percent of the evidence against him out the window and there would still be more than enough left to convince any reasonable person of his sole role in the crime."" -- V. BugliosiI, for one, find it difficult to disagree with anything Mr. Bugliosi has to say with respect to the JFK assassination, mainly because he knows the case like the back of his hand and possesses a level of built-in ""common sense"" that seems to gush forth in every book he's ever written or in any case he ever brought to trial in a court of law. And VB's common sense and logical thinking (plus his vast knowledge of the evidence in the JFK case) are hard things for conspiracy theorists to combat.Vincent even once ""prosecuted"" Lee Oswald for JFK's murder....albeit just in a ""simulated"" sense. It was in 1986 when Mr. Bugliosi secured a ""Guilty"" verdict out of a sworn-in jury from Dallas during the 21-hour televised docu-trial, ""On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald"".Below I've re-printed another unambiguous comment made a few years ago by Mr. Bugliosi, leaving no doubt as to who Vince thinks is solely responsible for JFK's death:""There was no plot, no conspiracy. JFK wasn't murdered by anti-Castro Cubans, the mob, or rogue CIA agents. In almost 40 years, there has not been one scintilla of proof tying the assassination to anyone but Oswald. There have been theories, but no evidence. Oswald had the motive, the opportunity, and the skill to kill President Kennedy."" -- V. BugliosiPart #4 of ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" (titled ""The Patsy"") is the portion of this cable-TV mini-series which boils my blood more than any other single installment. Mainly because it's just so downright silly! And the contemptible comments that came from the lips of former New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison at the end of the program are just beyond belief (and beyond ludicrous as well). Garrison made the following statement as Part 4 of TMWKK drew to a close (a quote which was even accompanied by a few crocodile tears, no less, making these comments even more laughable):""Lee Oswald was totally, unequivocally, completely innocent of the assassination .... and the fact that history, or in the re-writing of history, disinformation has made a villain out of this young man who wanted nothing more than to be a fine Marine .... is in some ways the greatest injustice of all."" -- J. GarrisonNow, for a conspiracy believer to say that Lee Oswald might have been part of some kind of a conspiracy on 11/22 is one thing -- but to elevate this obvious murderer (just by using the J.D. Tippit killing as one example, without even factoring in the Kennedy slaying) to the stature of a fallen martyr, as Garrison did via that quote, just reeks with disingenuousness. Such hollow glorification and unjustifiable praise of Oswald is just sickening, in my view.Keep in mind that the above quote came out of the mouth of the same Earling Carothers (""Jim"") Garrison who stated in a 1967 ""Playboy"" Magazine interview that he was still (as of late 1967) of the opinion that Lee Oswald might very well have been standing on the Depository's front steps at the time Kennedy was being killed.......""The Altgens photograph indicates the very real possibility that at the moment Oswald was supposed to have been crouching in the sixth-floor window of the Depository shooting Kennedy, he may actually have been standing outside the front door watching the Presidential motorcade."" -- J. Garrison; Via October 1967 issue of ""Playboy""Now, that Garrison quote above was uttered three full years after Billy Lovelady testified to the Warren Commission that it was Lovelady, and not Oswald, who is seen in the Altgens photo. And still Garrison had the gall to cast doubts about the identity of the man in the doorway in that interview. Disgraceful.A very rarely-seen video clip of Marguerite Oswald, LHO's mother, is also part of ""The Patsy"" installment of TMWKK. It shows Marguerite visiting her son's grave shortly after Lee's death at the hands of Jack Ruby, and is a clip that is both sad and hysterically-funny at the same time. Although, unlike Garrison's similar teary-eyed eulogy in this same program, at least Marguerite Oswald has the excuse of being the assassin's mother, and therefore a built-in flesh-and-blood bias is obviously seeping into her hilarious cemetery statement, which follows:""Lee Harvey Oswald, my son, even after his death, has done more for his country than any other living human being."" -- Marguerite OswaldI'm afraid I cannot hold back the boisterous laughter each time I replay that news clip showing Mrs. Oswald making the above statement. I know she was mourning the loss of her 24-year-old son -- but, given the evidence that says Marguerite's boy was unquestionably guilty of killing multiple human beings in 1963, such an inaccurate and off-the-wall statement can only elicit laughter from anyone who has studied the Kennedy and Tippit murder cases.One of the main reasons I find Part 4 (""The Patsy"") so silly is because the ""plotters"" (per this program and according to just about every CTer I've ever encountered) evidently couldn't have cared less that their ""Frame The Lone Patsy"" plan was almost certain to fail right from the get-go due to the fact they (the proverbial and always-unknown and unidentified ""plotters/assassins/evil-doers"") had assigned MULTIPLE gunmen to fire bullets into John Kennedy's body on November 22. Which means that a whole bunch of stuff was going to need to be ""fixed"" and ""planted"" and re-arranged after the shooting in order for ALL of the evidence to shine back on JUST Lee Oswald and his one rifle in the Book Depository.Therefore, via such an illogical ""Multi-Gun"" Patsy Plot, unless every frontal shot totally misses everybody and everything on Elm Street, there was bound to be lots of evidence of conspiracy to ""cover up"" immediately after the shooting stopped.How could any band of conspirators, needing just Lee Oswald blamed for the assassination, possibly have been so brazen and reckless (and brainless) to have thought (on November 21st) that it was a good idea to frame their one fall guy by shooting the President with many different guns, from several different angles?To put it bluntly -- There is simply no way in the world that anyone wanting to frame one man in the Depository would have placed multiple shooters (front and rear) in Dealey Plaza to kill the one target, when the job could just as easily have been carried out by placing a single shooter in the ""Sniper's Nest"" of the Book Depository (thereby eliminating the need for any after-the-fact ""planting"" and/or ""body alterations"", etc.). And, per my own beliefs, the job WAS, indeed, accomplished by just one person (Oswald) firing from that one window.Another ridiculous portion of one of the most commonly-believed ""Patsy"" plots (as depicted in Oliver Stone's movie, 'JFK') is the part where these ace ""plotters"" evidently couldn't care less where their ""Patsy"" was located at the exact time of JFK's murder. Because, per Stone's film, Oswald is free to roam around on the lower floors of the Depository at his leisure. Which means, if he's seen by anybody at 12:30, Oswald has an airtight alibi that gets him off the hook for killing JFK, and thusly the entire pre-arranged ""Frame Oswald As The Lone Patsy"" plan goes up in a puff of smoke -- all because the plotters were too stupid to keep the Patsy where they needed him during the shooting.Quite predictably, nobody involved with TMWKK programs believes that the ""Single-Bullet Theory"" is the correct version of the way Kennedy and Connally were wounded. But, again, when some common sense is applied to this aspect of the assassination, the ""SBT"" becomes the only possible and logical way the victims could have been injured. Believing otherwise opens up the floodgates for a wide array of nonsensical theories and sheer guesswork as to how it ""really"" happened. With such unsupported theories featuring multiple bullets that enter Kennedy's upper body and never exit at all.Then the CTers have to explain away the disappearance of all the various bullets that pelted JFK and JBC. All of the missiles within any ""conspiracy""-slanted version of the event just simply vanish off the planet without a trace. Plus there's the ""sideways-entering"" bullet that went into Connally's back, which obviously hit something (or someone) before striking the Governor.In short -- ANY theory that CTers are forced to ""substitute"" for the SBT lacks any common sense whatsoever and certainly lacks any hard evidence of ever having occurred. And, moreover, any alternative conspiracy scenario to the Warren Commission's very-logical Single-Bullet Conclusion is just flat-out stupid-sounding when compared to the SBT version of events.The Single-Bullet Theory is a theory declared to be true by both the WC and the HSCA, and is a scenario that involves absolutely ZERO ""loose ends"" whatsoever. It's a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence in the case. Evidence such as:JFK and JBC being aligned in the car to ""receive"" the Single Bullet (CE399) from Oswald's gun being fired from the TSBD. .... The downward angle of the wounds in both victims is consistent with one bullet going through both men. .... The ""oblong""-shaped back wound on JBC is consistent with the SBT. .... The Zapruder Film shows JFK and JBC reacting at very nearly an identical point in time to first being hit by gunfire. .... Not a single bullet was found inside JFK's back or neck. .... No whole bullets were found in the back-seat areas of the limo. .... And -- Bullet CE399, found near Connally's stretcher in Parkland Hospital, was definitively linked to Oswald's rifle.So, once you can get past the silly notion that a conspirator ""planted"" Bullet CE399, or would have even WANTED to ""plant"" CE399 in the hospital (AT A TIME BEFORE SAID CONSPIRATOR COULD HAVE POSSIBLY KNOWN IF SUCH A PLANTED BULLET WOULD TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTRA, UNNEEDED BULLET IN THE CASE THAT MIGHT BLOW THE WHOLE PLOT WIDE OPEN), it then becomes fairly clear that the ONE and ONLY bullet found anywhere near the two victims, a bullet that came out of a gun that was found in a building overlooking the location of the assassination, is the one and only bullet that caused all of Governor Connally's wounds and JFK's non-fatal wounds.What I'd really like to have happen is for some crackerjack CTer to provide a reasonable and believable conspiracy-based alternative to the SBT that uses logic and, above all, the known evidence in the case (or at least a percentage of it) and the two victims' known wound locations.I've yet to hear such a reasonable-sounding alternative. Because in order to postulate such an anti-SBT ""alternative"", a conspiracy theorist has to actually purport that TWO bullets (from high-powered rifles no doubt--because WHY would some idiotic plotters use just a couple of BB guns to kill the President with?) -- TWO bullets -- just STOP inside JFK's soft flesh in his neck and back...without striking a single bone or solid object in his body. Why? And, more importantly, HOW could this have possibly occurred? Two ""misfires""? Come now!And that CTer has to also purport that THREE different gunmen did the damage to TWO different victims at the EXACT same time (per the Z-Film timeframe....and if not ""exactly"" the same time, then certainly within well under 1.5 seconds of one another, which eliminates the idea that just a mere two shooters could have accomplished this ""alternate"" version of the 2-victim wounding).And that same CTer has to postulate that the THREE wounds on TWO men, occurring virtually at the same instant and being caused by THREE separate guns....ALL somehow, some way, by some act of the Almighty, just happened to align themselves into a triple-wound pattern that would FOOL all of the official Government investigative panels that would be poring over the case in the months and years after 11/22/63 into thinking (falsely, mind you!) that these THREE bullet wounds from THREE guns were all probably caused by just ONE single bullet found at Parkland Memorial Hospital.Some great ""alternative"", huh? Anybody want to take it to Vegas and see if anyone bites?Or --- The only other ""alternative"" is to say that a bullet did go all the way through JFK, but somehow (via some weird Kreskin-like magically-swerving bullet) missed John Connally seated directly in front of JFK's neck.And then that CT alternative has to incorporate yet another ""disappearing bullet"" (among several in this case that were never seen by any non-plotters) that struck the limo someplace.....and the hole(s) in the limo were somehow stitched up by the ever-efficient ""Conspiracy Cover-Up"" branch of Martha Stewart & Associates, Inc. in a brief timespan between Dallas and the time Robert Frazier examined the limo for damage (and found NONE in the back-seat and jump-seat areas) on the night of November 22nd at the White House garage.Each of the above ""alternatives"" totally ignores all of the known evidence in the case...plus they both totally ignore ordinary garden-variety common sense as well.I think I'd rather stick with the known facts in evidence -- which is physical evidence that I have no reason at all to think was (or even could have been) ALL faked and/or manipulated by an impeccably-perfect ""Let's Frame Oswald"" team of cover-up agents.And once a person who has looked at the physical evidence in the JFK case gets to the ""This Stuff Couldn't Possibly Have ALL Been Faked"" point (including the wealth of evidence showing Oswald to be guilty of killing Officer J.D. Tippit too), then only three obvious words remain to be uttered aloud -- OSWALD DID IT!-------------------""Almost all of the current books on the subject deal with conspiracy theories.

For this shameful perversion of what the true facts of the JFK Assassination are (which to put it bluntly, is that Oswald did it and Oswald acted alone) to advertise  it with the title &quot;The truth shall set you free&quot; is the biggest  joke imaginable.  Oswald was seen by Howard Brennan firing his last shot.  19 of 20 forensic pathologists say unequivocably that JFK was shot only  twice and from behind.  The overwhelming majority of earwitnesses say only  three shots were fired.  All competent photo experts have authenticated  JFK's x-rays and autopsy photos, and the three &quot;tramps&quot; were  identified as nothing more than tramps when the original Dallas police  records were released several years ago.  Oswald murdered J.D. Tippit and  was seen by eleven witnesses doing so.  Oswald had no alibi, saying he was  eating lunch at the time of the shooting with &quot;Junior&quot; except  that &quot;Junior Jarman&quot; was on the fifth floor at the time of the  assassination and was photographed in the fifth floor window.This video  is only of value to those who want to see an amateur job of propaganda at  its worst, not history.",1,A Dishonest Telling,950659200,"02 16, 2000",2000,1209,"['could', 'have', 'given', 'zero', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'shameful', 'perversion', 'what', 'true', 'facts', 'JFK', 'Assassination', 'are', 'put', 'bluntly', 'Oswald', 'did', 'Oswald', 'acted', 'alone', 'advertise', 'title', 'quot', 'truth', 'shall', 'set', 'free', 'quot', 'biggest', 'joke', 'imaginable', 'Oswald', 'was', 'seen', 'Howard', 'Brennan', 'firing', 'last', 'shot', '19', '20', 'forensic', 'pathologists', 'say', 'unequivocably', 'JFK', 'was', 'shot', 'only', 'twice', 'behind', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'earwitnesses', 'say', 'only', 'three', 'shots', 'were', 'fired', 'competent', 'photo', 'experts', 'have', 'authenticated', 'JFK', 'x-rays', 'autopsy', 'photos', 'three', 'quot', 'quot', 'were', 'identified', 'nothing', 'more', 'tramps', 'when', 'original', 'Dallas', 'police', 'records', 'were', 'released', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Oswald', 'murdered', 'J.D', 'Tippit', 'was', 'seen', 'eleven', 'witnesses', 'doing', 'so', 'Oswald', 'had', 'alibi', 'saying', 'was', 'eating', 'lunch', 'time', 'shooting', 'quot', 'Junior', 'quot', 'quot', 'Junior', 'Jarman', 'quot', 'was', 'fifth', 'floor', 'time', 'assassination', 'was', 'photographed', 'fifth', 'floor', 'window.This', 'video', 'only', 'value', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'amateur', 'job', 'propaganda', 'worst', 'not', 'history']",The Men Who Killed Kennedy VHS

I can't understand how anyone could believe the Warren Commission Report after seeing this series.  The Zapruder film clearly shows a large chunk of Kennedy's head being blown backwards.  How could one shot fired from the rear do this?  Any fool can see he had to be shot from the front. The doctors who treated Kennedy at Parkland Hospital said that he was shot in the right temple area.  People who handled the body said that Kennedy had a large hole in the back of his head.  Are they all lying?  Peter Jennings conveniently left these questions out of his whitewashed account, &quot;Beyond Conspiracy,&quot; and his documentary didn't even show the end of the Zapruder film until the end of the program; and then they didn't bother to comment on the shot from the front.I'm not a conspiracy nut; I just want the truth.

Three more episodes were made in 2003. The Documetary series was shown annually on A&E & The History Channel from 1991-2004, after the allegations of LBJ's Involvement in the final segment became heated , the series hasn't been seen since, which is certainly a shame because 8 of the 9 parts have nothing to do with Johnson whatsoever. Part 7 on the Medical cover up, and a lengthy overview of possible tampering with the Presidential limo may be the most explosive revelations in the entire series.Many of the Researchers/Authors/Witnesses are no longer around such as Col. Fletcher Prouty, Gov. John Connally who makes some very moving comments as does Sen. Ralph Yarborough,,Witness and Photographer Maj.

Also, this is better than when it was shown on TV in the 90's as there is about 5 extra minutes of footage per episode till the fifth one, longer interviews,& a couple new ones that were originally edited due to time constraints.  .",4,Most Comprehensive JFK Assassination Documentary,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,1765,"['Documentary', 'originally', 'made', 'BBC', 'Nigel', 'Turner', '1988', 'was', 'five', 'part', 'series', 'then', 'sixth', 'instal', 'ment', 'was', 'added', '1995', 'Three', 'more', 'episodes', 'were', 'made', '2003', 'Documetary', 'series', 'was', 'shown', 'annually', 'A', 'E', 'History', 'Channel', '1991-2004', 'allegations', 'LBJ', 'Involvement', 'final', 'segment', 'became', 'heated', 'series', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'certainly', 'shame', '8', '9', 'parts', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Johnson', 'whatsoever', 'Part', '7', 'Medical', 'cover', 'up', 'lengthy', 'overview', 'possible', 'tampering', 'Presidential', 'limo', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'explosive', 'revelations', 'entire', 'series.Many', 'Researchers/Authors/Witnesses', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'around', 'such', 'Col.', 'Fletcher', 'Prouty', 'Gov', 'John', 'Connally', 'who', 'very', 'moving', 'comments', 'Sen.', 'Ralph', 'Yarborough', ',Witness', 'Photographer', 'Maj.', 'Phil', 'Willis', 'Author', 'Harold', 'Weisberg', '2', 'alleged', 'Eyewitnesses', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'gunman', 'Gordon', 'Arnold', 'Ed', 'Hoffman', 'Author', 'Larry', 'Ray', 'Harris', 'Author', 'Seth', 'Kantor', 'who', 'wrote', 'litte', 'known', 'excellent', 'book', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'many', 'former', 'Police', 'Officers', 'Dallas', 'name', 'some.The', 'afforementioned', 'Turner', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'inserting', 'archival', 'footage', 'contempraneous', 'interviews', 'are', 'succinct', 'quite', 'revealing', 'Nothing', 'boring', 'here', 'only', 'drawback', 'few', 'witnessess', 'may', 'be', 'embellishing', 'fabricating', 'highly', 'provocative', 'important', 'say', 'few', 'years', 'wan', 'na', 'hear', 'what', 'particular', 'person', 'say', 'gone', 'good', 'historical', 'documetary', 'have', 'Also', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', '90', '5', 'extra', 'minutes', 'footage', 'episode', 'fifth', 'one', 'longer', 'interviews', 'couple', 'new', 'ones', 'were', 'originally', 'edited', 'due', 'time', 'constraints']",The Men Who Killed Kennedy VHS
77979,A3TDEHA4IVHHSG,0788600931,"Graham Hill ""Movie & TV Historian""","[32, 36]","When it comes to the JFK assasination??? Well lets just say as numerous polls indicate, most people don't believe what was put out by the Warren Commission. The British documentary series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"", was the only televised challenge that had the guts to speak it's mind, namely through producer Nigel Turner. First presented in 1988, Turner and his team assembled a great deal of testimony and research to dispute the ""all so convenient and miraculous"" facts that were offered up as gospel. ""The Single Bullet Theory"" being the weapon to blow away all those that dare doubt their government. But then being British myself and realising like many others what the killing of JFK has had on not just US but World history. I made sure that I watched this series when it had first aired on A&E.; And what a revelation! Now I had already had my eyes opened, when the 1973 Burt Lancaster film ""Executive Action"", laid out many of the same findings, only hidden within the semi-fictional framework of not naming anyone. But this series started to fill in the gaps and start naming the cast of characters. Now this subject is certainly something that you can literally write volumes on, but to my simple way of thinking, you either blindly believe that one single person could kill JFK -with the worst possible choice of rifle; getting himself photographed with said rifle beforehand; being lucky enough to have Kennedy totally exposed in the limo -a virtual sitting duck; having in the first place, the luck and money to get discharged from the Marine Corp and being granted without any troble at all,a visa to Russia -and so on and so on, not to mention all those convenient deaths, accidents and suicides for years to come. Well to my mind at least -theres room for doubt!It's the absolute body of doubt that makes the case for the series. Although serious damage was done to it's credibility when the so called ""Marseille-drug hitmen connection"" was prooved false. But that does not or should not alter all the evidence it has prooved. Which brings us to the final three installments of this nine part expose. Certainly the most controversial and indicting of all -part 7. ""The Smoking Guns"", part 8. ""The Love Affair"" and finally the bombshell part 9. ""The Guilty Men"". These three parts were aired on the History Channel on the 40th anniversary of the assasination. The first night the channel aired all three, I missed it. But the second night when they were repeated, a station disclaimer was added before each commercial break and the show aired without any cuts. Still, anger had been raised but the parent company Disney, held firm. They were released on dvd together with the rest of the series and then -they were suddenly no more. Totally pulled from release with the company deeply apologizing for having aired the series in the first place. Evenso, I managed to tape them from that second night anyway and I'm glad I did. Talk about in demand! That final part 9. ""The Guilty Men"" produced in 2003, the part that implicates Lyndon Baines Johnson himself, through none other than one of his attorneys Barr McClellan. Incidently at the time of all this, his son Scott just happened to be George W. Bush's press secretary. Now you don't have to panic if you missed the airing or couldn't get your hands on a copy of the tape or dvd, because Barr McClellan put it all down in his book ""Blood, Money & Power"" which is still available on Amazon. I guess LBJ's dedicated and ageing supporters, felt safe in the fact that the public don't read much anymore.In conclusion though, this is a series worthy of debate. Personally I believe there was a conspiracy and a big one! Oswald was the ultimate fall guy and it wasn't just the presidential limo that took a big RIGHT turn into Deeley Plaza that November day. As for papers being released in the future, well you got to believe if anything was written down it's long gone now, along with anyone who even slightly witnessed anything. Such is the way with history and the struggle for power and wealth. And again being British -just look at our long, long history of bloody murder and state secrets!",5,THE MEN WHO KILLED KENNEDY  -are still killing!,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,4164,"['When', 'JFK', 'assasination', 'Well', 'just', 'say', 'numerous', 'polls', 'indicate', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'British', 'documentary', 'series', 'Men', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'only', 'televised', 'challenge', 'had', 'guts', 'speak', 'mind', 'namely', 'producer', 'Nigel', 'Turner', 'First', 'presented', '1988', 'Turner', 'team', 'assembled', 'great', 'deal', 'testimony', 'research', 'dispute', 'so', 'convenient', 'miraculous', 'facts', 'were', 'offered', 'up', 'gospel', 'Single', 'Bullet', 'Theory', 'being', 'weapon', 'blow', 'away', 'dare', 'doubt', 'government', 'then', 'being', 'British', 'realising', 'many', 'others', 'what', 'killing', 'JFK', 'had', 'not', 'just', 'US', 'World', 'history', 'made', 'sure', 'watched', 'series', 'when', 'had', 'first', 'aired', 'A', 'E', 'what', 'revelation', 'Now', 'had', 'already', 'had', 'eyes', 'opened', 'when', '1973', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'film', 'Executive', 'Action', 'laid', 'out', 'many', 'same', 'findings', 'only', 'semi-fictional', 'framework', 'not', 'naming', 'anyone', 'series', 'started', 'fill', 'gaps', 'start', 'naming', 'cast', 'characters', 'Now', 'subject', 'certainly', 'something', 'can', 'literally', 'write', 'volumes', 'simple', 'way', 'thinking', 'either', 'blindly', 'believe', 'one', 'single', 'person', 'could', 'kill', 'JFK', '-with', 'worst', 'possible', 'choice', 'rifle', 'getting', 'photographed', 'said', 'rifle', 'beforehand', 'being', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'Kennedy', 'totally', 'exposed', 'limo', '-a', 'virtual', 'sitting', 'duck', 'having', 'first', 'place', 'luck', 'money', 'get', 'discharged', 'Marine', 'Corp', 'being', 'granted', 'troble', 'visa', 'Russia', '-and', 'so', 'so', 'not', 'mention', 'convenient', 'deaths', 'accidents', 'suicides', 'years', 'come', 'Well', 'mind', 'least', '-theres', 'room', 'doubt', 'absolute', 'body', 'doubt', 'case', 'series', 'serious', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'credibility', 'when', 'so', 'called', 'Marseille-drug', 'hitmen', 'connection', 'was', 'prooved', 'false', 'not', 'should', 'not', 'alter', 'evidence', 'prooved', 'Which', 'final', 'three', 'installments', 'nine', 'part', 'expose', 'Certainly', 'most', 'controversial', 'indicting', '-part', '7', 'Smoking', 'Guns', 'part', '8', 'Love', 'Affair', 'finally', 'bombshell', 'part', '9', 'Guilty', 'Men', 'three', 'parts', 'were', 'aired', 'History', 'Channel', '40th', 'anniversary', 'assasination', 'first', 'night', 'channel', 'aired', 'three', 'missed', 'second', 'night', 'when', 'were', 'repeated', 'station', 'disclaimer', 'was', 'added', 'commercial', 'break', 'show', 'aired', 'cuts', 'Still', 'anger', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'parent', 'company', 'Disney', 'held', 'firm', 'were', 'released', 'dvd', 'together', 'rest', 'series', 'then', '-they', 'were', 'suddenly', 'no', 'more', 'Totally', 'pulled', 'release', 'company', 'deeply', 'apologizing', 'having', 'aired', 'series', 'first', 'place', 'Evenso', 'managed', 'tape', 'second', 'night', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Talk', 'demand', 'final', 'part', '9', 'Guilty', 'Men', 'produced', '2003', 'part', 'Lyndon', 'Baines', 'Johnson', 'none', 'other', 'one', 'attorneys', 'Barr', 'McClellan', 'Incidently', 'time', 'son', 'Scott', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'press', 'secretary', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'panic', 'missed', 'airing', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'tape', 'dvd', 'Barr', 'McClellan', 'put', 'down', 'book', 'Blood', 'Money', 'Power', 'still', 'available', 'Amazon', 'guess', 'LBJ', 'dedicated', 'ageing', 'supporters', 'felt', 'safe', 'fact', 'public', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'much', 'anymore.In', 'conclusion', 'series', 'worthy', 'debate', 'Personally', 'believe', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'big', 'one', 'Oswald', 'was', 'ultimate', 'fall', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'presidential', 'limo', 'took', 'big', 'RIGHT', 'turn', 'Deeley', 'Plaza', 'November', 'day', 'papers', 'being', 'released', 'future', 'well', 'got', 'believe', 'anything', 'was', 'written', 'down', 'long', 'gone', 'now', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'slightly', 'witnessed', 'anything', 'Such', 'way', 'history', 'struggle', 'power', 'wealth', 'again', 'being', 'British', '-just', 'look', 'long', 'long', 'history', 'bloody', 'murder', 'state', 'secrets']",The Men Who Killed Kennedy VHS

77985,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0788600931,Joker,"[4, 5]","I first saw the multi-episode documentary The Men Who Killed Kennedy in November 2003 on the History Channel.  I have ALL the  episodes, including ones that aren't included in this set I'm reviewing.  This is a riveting, interesting documentary.  Whether you're a conspiracy believer or subscribe to the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I think you'll find this documentary very interesting to watch.Here are the episodes:1. The Coup d'Etat2. The Forces Of Darkness3. The Cover-Up4. The Patsy5. The Witnesses6. The Truth Shall Make You Free7. The Smoking Guns (not included in this set)8. The Love Affair (not included in this set)9. The Guilty Men (not included in this set)The original series was broadcast in the UK in 1988, which was 25 years after the assassination.  In the 22 years since it was broadcast, a lot of other fascinating programs have aired on various TV channels.  Knowledge about the assassination has grown exponentially since 1988, as have advances in forensic science and ways of understanding what happened.  Just like everyone else, I have my own opinions about what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  I've watched this documentary and countless others on The History Channel, The Discovery Channel, CNN, FOX News, and other networks.  I've also done my own research.Some of the programs I have seen and taped over the years include:JFK: Beyond The Magic BulletJFK: Beyond ConspiracyJFK: 3 Shots That Changed AmericaJFK: Case Not ClosedJFK: Inside The Target CarJFK: Altered StatesmanWho Murdered JFK?24 Hours After The Kennedy AssassinationJFK: The Day That Changed AmericaImage Of An AssassinationDeath In Dealey PlazaNot all of these programs deal with the controversy about the assassination, but most of them do.Not everything in this documentary is necessarily true, you can go to the bank on that.  The History Channel acknowledges this, as they did their own research into some of the material that was presented in the series, but it's still a fascinating program to watch.  What this documentary basically is designed to do is open up peoples' minds and get them thinking.  The title is ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"", which obviously means it's geared toward conspiracy theorists and rejects the idea of a lone gunman.Without going into a lot of specifics, I'll just sum up this documentary this way:  It's controversial, interesting, fascinating, thought-provoking, historic, nostalgic, and will really make you question a lot of things about the assassination and the time period in which it happened and what has gone on in this country in the decades since, especially if you're a conspiracy theorist.If you can get your hands on the episodes from 2003 (The Smoking Guns, The Love Affair, and The Guilty Men), it will REALLY open your mind.My favorite episodes in the whole series are The Cover-Up, The Witnesses, The Patsy, The Coup d'Etat, The Smoking Guns, and The Guilty Men.If you're a JFK assassination buff, then this documentary will provide your fix for the day.

BUT, since we are still owned by the rich and powerful, they STILL, don't want you to find out the truth.Here is what I have learned....The rich and powerful still own each and every one of us. Look at what happened to the only President to stand up to them.They blew his head apart, while emory roberts (head of our president's secret service detail for that day) set him up and sat back and watched it happen. I wonder how much it costs to buy an agent. roberts even called back a agent that was going to help, after our president was hit, by the 2nd bullet. The first one missed.johnson knew too, look at the smile on his face, in the motorcade. He knew exactly what was going to happen. He and his oil buddies in Texas got together, (The BU#@ Family) to figure it out.THEY WANTED THEIR WAR IN FING VIETNAM. Johnsons carreer was over, and he wanted to be President, (No matter the cost)That's why Johnson was covered and pushed down by Rufus Youngblood, (a honest agent) after he ""saw some commotion in the President's car"". He leaped out of the front seat, and covered johnson. After he had johnson covered and safe, he heard the final two shots. It's all in his report. How did he leap over the back, of johnsons car while the other agent's behind, and in Kennedy's car did nothing.Then about the agents in the front seat of the presidential car, The president, said quite clearly ""My God, I'm hit"" before he passed out. Then the driver practically stops, and looks back, like he is waiting......... ""Oh there it is, the kill shot. Punch it."" Almost like he was expecting it. They LET our President get assassinated! Then emory roberts radios back to johnsons car ""They got him. They got him.""

Like so many other JFK conspiracy theories, this production does not let the facts of the assassination get in the way of telling a good story.  And to anyone who has any knowledge of the facts of the case, (the hard physical evidence), ""The Men that Killed Kennedy"" is nothing more than sheer speculation and immaginary happenings. The ""proof"" of the conspiracy comes from very questionable and unreliable sources, sources that cannot be trusted to gain the truth. There is no hard provable evidence here; rather, its speculation and imagination.Completely at odds with the Warren Commission's findings that Lee Oswald acted alone in killing JFK, this production posits a grand conspiracy involving hundreds of people, many in the uppermost levels of our government.  Clearly, to anyone who has a working knowledge of the Kennedy assassination, this ""conspiracy"" is another in a long line of unprovable theories.  There is absolutely no documentation or hard evidence that there was a grand conspiracy to kill JFK, and this film does nothing to further the case.Rather than waste your precious time viewing an immaginary theory, why not invest yourself in the facts of the case by reading ""Case Closed"", by Gerald Posner, or ""Marina and Lee"", by Prisilla McMillian?  These books will ground you in the facts about the case and the assassin, not unsupported fairy tales. You must also view the computer analysis of the Zapruder film produced by Meyers and Vaughan, which proves beyond all reasonable doubt that the two bullets which killed Kennedy and injured Connally came from the 6th floor SE window of the Texas Schoolbook Depository (and not the grassy knoll, or a storm sewer, the overpass, etc., etc.).Two thumbs down for this long-winded (yawn) convoluted presentation.konedog",1,Complete Imaginary Rubbish!,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,1917,"['Men', 'Killed', 'Kennedy', 'ponderous', '9-part', 'series', 'details', 'huge', 'intricate', 'conspiracy', 'kill', 'President', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'JFK', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'production', 'not', 'let', 'facts', 'assassination', 'get', 'way', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'anyone', 'who', 'knowledge', 'facts', 'case', 'hard', 'physical', 'evidence', 'Men', 'Killed', 'Kennedy', 'nothing', 'more', 'sheer', 'speculation', 'immaginary', 'happenings', 'proof', 'conspiracy', 'very', 'questionable', 'unreliable', 'sources', 'sources', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'trusted', 'gain', 'truth', 'hard', 'provable', 'evidence', 'here', 'rather', 'speculation', 'imagination.Completely', 'odds', 'Warren', 'Commission', 'findings', 'Lee', 'Oswald', 'acted', 'alone', 'killing', 'JFK', 'production', 'grand', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'hundreds', 'people', 'many', 'uppermost', 'levels', 'government', 'Clearly', 'anyone', 'who', 'working', 'knowledge', 'Kennedy', 'assassination', 'conspiracy', 'long', 'line', 'unprovable', 'theories', 'absolutely', 'documentation', 'hard', 'evidence', 'was', 'grand', 'conspiracy', 'kill', 'JFK', 'film', 'nothing', 'further', 'case.Rather', 'waste', 'precious', 'time', 'viewing', 'immaginary', 'theory', 'why', 'not', 'invest', 'facts', 'case', 'reading', 'Case', 'Closed', 'Gerald', 'Posner', 'Marina', 'Lee', 'Prisilla', 'McMillian', 'books', 'will', 'ground', 'facts', 'case', 'assassin', 'not', 'unsupported', 'fairy', 'tales', 'must', 'also', 'view', 'computer', 'analysis', 'Zapruder', 'film', 'produced', 'Meyers', 'Vaughan', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'two', 'bullets', 'killed', 'Kennedy', 'injured', 'Connally', 'came', '6th', 'floor', 'SE', 'window', 'Texas', 'Schoolbook', 'Depository', 'not', 'grassy', 'knoll', 'storm', 'sewer', 'overpass', 'etc.', 'etc', '.Two', 'thumbs', 'down', 'long-winded', 'yawn', 'convoluted', 'presentation.konedog']",The Men Who Killed Kennedy VHS

He acted alone, there was no conspiracy.So why do I say disappointing? For years I believed that Kennedy's assassination was, and HAD to be a very carefully planned conspiracy. Many things added fuel to my belief; the political climate of the time, Jack Ruby popping up out of nowhere and shooting Oswald before any trial inquest could be done, the ""grassy knoll"", the ""magic bullet"", the apparent conflicting eye (ear) witness testimony, etc., etc. I simply could not accept the notion of some looser nutcase killing the President of the United States. It just did not balance in my mind. The answer could not be that simple, I thought. I realized that I (like Agent Mulder) WANTED TO BELIEVE. The Warren Commission Report, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations report, just added to the mystery. No one believed the Warren Report, it was full of mistakes. Even LBJ (though not publicly) was convinced that Castro was somehow behind the assassination. Then there was E. Howard Hunts ""confession"" when he thought he was dying.I have always given equal time to both schools of thought; the ""conspiracy"" theory, and the ""lone gunman"" theory. I have spent a small fortune on books, videos, and trips to the National Archives. At some point in my research, I came to realize that even the best conspiracy theories lacked any good evidence. In fact, I was able to debunk every single one.The KEY to understanding this case is the one thing that is sadly overlooked or ignored by conspiracy buffs. The key is Lee Harvey Oswald HIMSELF.When you understand this man's life, the people close to him, and his history, the pieces of the puzzle fit together at last.I would urge anyone who is truly interested, and who TRULY wants to know the truth, to study the best books on both sides of the debate. Do a thorough study. Cross reference points of interest, and take no one's word as Gospel.Sometimes, we don't want to know the truth. Everyone loves a mystery, and ""conspiracies"" are very alluring. They are also very big business. The truth in this case is only as complex as the troubled mind of one man; Lee Harvey Oswald.""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" is a very interesting introduction into some of the common conspiracy theories. View it critically. I also strongly recommend the following:""Image of an Assassination"" - A new look at the Zapruder film.

77994,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,0788600931,Newton Ooi,"[5, 7]","Where were you when JFK was shot?  This is a question often asked among those who lived through this time in history.  The producers of this 2-disc DVD set asked this question to many of those who were actually in Dallas that fateful day in 1963.  And they also ask what they say and what they heard.  The responses shown here generally reflect a view that JFK was hit in the head by a bullet from the front shot at approximately ground level, which directly contradicts the Warren Commission report.  The movie also interviews dozens of individuals who were involved in the aftermath; including doctors present at the autopsy, police officers who dealt with either Oswald or Jack Ruby, and journalists who covered the case first hand.The movie is taken from a History Channel serial and comes in the format of six episodes.  Each of the episodes deals with a different aspect of the assasination.  One episode focuses on Lee Harvey Oswald, another focuses on physical evidence such as acoustics and ballistics, another episode recreates events the day of the shooting, etc, etc...  Probably the most intriguing episode is the first two which produce evidence hinting that French assassins hired by the US mob shot Kennedy.Overall, this series presents a lot of primary evidence that contradict the findings of the Warren commission, and even challenge the possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald participated in the killing.  The pace of the show is great, slow enough for everyone to get their words in.  What was really nice were the interviews; each interviewee got time to provide lengthy and detailed answers.There are several things that could have been improved to make this good series great.  First, at the beginning of each and every interview, subtitles should be provided that give the name and title (doctor, police officer, witness, etc...) of each person.  This is especially important given the large number of individuals interviewed.  Second, there should have been one additional episode that went through the findings of the Warren Commission.  The Warren Commission report is thousands of pages long, and all but the most avid history buffs have never read a page of it.  As such, the entire series should have included one episode that comprehensively went over the history and findings of the Warren Commission.  Third, for a family that lost two of its sons, this show makes no mention of what other Kennedy family members have said about the assasinations.  This would have made a nice conclusion to the entire series.  Fourth, the organization of the entire serial could have been vastly improved.  The first episode should have went over the events as happened that all agree upon; from JFK's flight into Dallas to the conclusion of the Warren Commission.  The second episode should have explored in detail the Warren Commission report.  The third episode should have presented evidence not included in the Warren report.  The remainder of the episodes should then focus on contradictions between the Warren report and other evidence.

Not even leaches like Gerald Posner could ever have the type of impact that this series has had.You will NOT be disappointed in The Men Who Killed Kennedy Series.

77997,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,0788600931,Phil S.,"[2, 2]","Thanks to the Reviewer who pointed of what's missing from this DVD package? (Re. Chapters). That's a central theme to this astonishing production - what's missing from the places where the hardest evidence should be housed?Absolutely over-running with hitherto unknown, lesser-discussed facts and intelligent speculation, all discs cry out for revisitation, slo-mo'ing, freeze-framing, all the way through.Characters like Joseph Milteer are given due coverage, unlike Gerald Posner's book where this extemist was reduced to a tiny footnote. This DVD does not carve in concrete tha the Secret service in Dallas was not alerted to a very plot against JFK in Miami, though the implication is that the FBI and the Secret Service had (an intentional) ""failure to communicate"".At times, we must consider this DVD-set with ""1988"" in mind. There's very little about General walker, Jack Ruby, David Ferrie, and others, which really tighten up the argument or belief that there was more than one shootist in Texas, on 11-22-63.There's a mind-boggling segment features ablow-up of the Mary Moorman photo which reveals cloudy figures of three individuals, one a Military man with a home movie camera (he's given alot of footage here!) and two men standing either behind a white wall or picket fence. At first, even the most anti-Warren Commisssion viewer might say, yeah, color it in...big deal. But it is revealed that two researchers spent years on theblow-up. And one man in an apparent hardhat has been photgraphed from other angles (seen in another DVD) to show that perhaps this was not a case of an ink-blot gone astray.Vey powerful is the part suggesting that (1) autopsy photos were modified and (2) JFK's brain was mostly removed between Dallas and Washington, D.C.Still, we do not have 100% ""evidence"" of the *fatal* blow coming from Kennedy's ""right front"". Spaeking with a Doctor Of Physics, personally, I got a very learned but ""typical"" answer that ""if a person's brain explodes"", then his body flails about and initial impact physics is not relevant. Again, we are dealing with ""1988"", so new ballistics details have come out on the subject; very convincing evidence that most likely LHO did not fire a *rifle* on that day.The ""Three assassins"" from France idea was new to me at the time and is very hard to follow on this documentary. I've had to replay that part (on my VHS tape of yore) about 45 times. One thing is strongly asserted though: a guy from France, identified as a very businesslike killer for profit, stood atop the Grassy Knoll.If you just want one source for 11-22-63, this is probably the best, though the viewer must constantly look for supporting ideas/facts from newer sources.The copy/narrative is excellent - I first watched this as a TV Special, with an American narrator. Here we have the presumptive original (English) voice.[Note: Although it appears that three Chapters are missing, this DVD-set has post 1988 material].",4,Incomplete but essential,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,2954,"['Thanks', 'Reviewer', 'who', 'pointed', 'what', 'missing', 'DVD', 'package', 'Re', 'Chapters', 'central', 'theme', 'astonishing', 'production', 'what', 'missing', 'places', 'where', 'hardest', 'evidence', 'should', 'be', 'housed', 'Absolutely', 'over-running', 'hitherto', 'unknown', 'lesser-discussed', 'facts', 'intelligent', 'speculation', 'discs', 'cry', 'out', 'revisitation', ""slo-mo'ing"", 'freeze-framing', 'way', 'through.Characters', 'Joseph', 'Milteer', 'are', 'given', 'due', 'coverage', 'Gerald', 'Posner', 'book', 'where', 'extemist', 'was', 'reduced', 'tiny', 'footnote', 'DVD', 'not', 'carve', 'concrete', 'tha', 'Secret', 'service', 'Dallas', 'was', 'not', 'alerted', 'very', 'plot', 'JFK', 'Miami', 'implication', 'FBI', 'Secret', 'Service', 'had', 'intentional', 'failure', 'communicate', '.At', 'times', 'must', 'consider', 'DVD-set', '1988', 'mind', 'very', 'little', 'General', 'walker', 'Jack', 'Ruby', 'David', 'Ferrie', 'others', 'really', 'up', 'argument', 'belief', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'shootist', 'Texas', '11-22-63.There', 'mind-boggling', 'segment', 'ablow-up', 'Mary', 'Moorman', 'photo', 'cloudy', 'figures', 'three', 'individuals', 'one', 'Military', 'man', 'home', 'movie', 'camera', 'given', 'alot', 'footage', 'here', 'two', 'men', 'standing', 'either', 'white', 'wall', 'picket', 'fence', 'first', 'even', 'most', 'anti-Warren', 'Commisssion', 'viewer', 'might', 'say', 'yeah', 'color', 'big', 'deal', 'revealed', 'two', 'researchers', 'spent', 'years', 'theblow-up', 'one', 'man', 'apparent', 'hardhat', 'been', 'photgraphed', 'other', 'angles', 'seen', 'DVD', 'show', 'perhaps', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'ink-blot', 'gone', 'astray.Vey', 'powerful', 'part', 'suggesting', '1', 'autopsy', 'photos', 'were', 'modified', '2', 'JFK', 'brain', 'was', 'mostly', 'removed', 'Dallas', 'Washington', 'D.C.Still', 'do', 'not', 'have', '100', '%', 'evidence', '*fatal*', 'blow', 'coming', 'Kennedy', 'right', 'front', 'Spaeking', 'Doctor', 'Physics', 'personally', 'got', 'very', 'learned', 'typical', 'answer', 'person', 'brain', 'explodes', 'then', 'body', 'initial', 'impact', 'physics', 'not', 'relevant', 'Again', 'are', 'dealing', '1988', 'so', 'new', 'ballistics', 'details', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'subject', 'very', 'convincing', 'evidence', 'most', 'likely', 'LHO', 'did', 'not', 'fire', '*rifle*', 'day.The', 'Three', 'assassins', 'France', 'idea', 'was', 'new', 'time', 'very', 'hard', 'follow', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'had', 'replay', 'part', 'VHS', 'tape', 'yore', '45', 'times', 'One', 'thing', 'strongly', 'asserted', 'guy', 'France', 'identified', 'very', 'businesslike', 'killer', 'profit', 'stood', 'Grassy', 'Knoll.If', 'just', 'want', 'one', 'source', '11-22-63', 'probably', 'best', 'viewer', 'must', 'constantly', 'look', 'supporting', 'ideas/facts', 'newer', 'sources.The', 'copy/narrative', 'excellent', 'first', 'watched', 'TV', 'Special', 'American', 'narrator', 'Here', 'have', 'presumptive', 'original', 'English', 'voice', '[', 'Note', 'three', 'Chapters', 'are', 'missing', 'DVD-set', 'post', '1988', 'material', ']']",The Men Who Killed Kennedy VHS

Too many of them have one bias or another, and the results are usually a collection of half-truths and tantalizing but ultimately unusable evidence. These types of slanted investigations hold true for the Oswald-did-it-alone camp, as well as for the everybody-except-for-Walter-Cronkite-did-it school. The Men Who Killed Kennedy is no exception.To the newly arrived investigator into the events of 11/22/63, there is a lot of intriguing speculation here, some of which has not been disputed. Still, there is a lot of shaky goings-on here. The ""computer enhancement"" that proves that David Ferrie was one of the shooters is an embarrassing case of ""computer manipulation"". And the guy shooting from the sewer? How did I ever miss that!?!?! Of course! That explains everything!

The first double dvd set contained: Volume 1 - The Coup d'Etat, The Forces of Darkness, The Cover-Up; and Volume 2 - The Patsy, The Witnesses, and The Truth Shal Set You Free. The second dvd set contained: Volume 1 - The Smoking Guns, and The Love Affair; and Volume 2 - The Guilty Men.The cover shown on this advert is for the 1st of the double dvd sets. The 2nd cover has a more plain vanilla History channel logo. If there are other production sets, please post.The 2nd set is perhaps the most controversial. The Love Affair describes a romantic affair between Judith Baker and Lee Osward. She was a cancer researcher gone astray and involved in a scheme to inject Fidel Castro with a virulent cancer which in its preliminary stages was tested on an unwitting subject in a US mental hospital. If you can find it anywhere, it is worth viewing. I have read that it has never again been aired on TV.Volume 2 of the 2nd set - The Guilty Men - incriminates LBJ and other prominent Texans and Hoover in the cover-up if not the planning of the assassination. This last segment is now officially suppressed. You cannot find it anywhere unless in used copy. This episode is viewable in YouTube but in fair quality and in 5 segments. How important is this last dvd? Read the comments on Barr McClelland's book:Blood, Money & Power: How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K.Who did the shooting? When this documentary was aired, Mr Turner put together the best known evidence. Since no prosecutor has dared touch the issue since Jim Garrison, we are left with uncertain theorizing about Italian shooters (some claim one of the segments is now discreted because two of the possible Italian assassins claim an alibi). Recenly attention has focused on a James Files (a Google search will lead to an alleged confession - extraordinarily believeable but questions remain). Does 1 group of shooters rule out another? No.Is absolutely everything alleged in the documentary true? No doubt there are weaknesses. Yet no one has proven anything to be absolutely incorrect. Is it possible the Italian Mafia was not involved? Yes. Is it possible that James Files was 1 of the shooters (Google search).

And while some effort is made to identify certain key assassination figures, a lot of the pieces of the puzzle are left for the viewer to put together - not all of it is spelled out for the audience.The interviews alone make this tape worth the buying price, and the footage of Dealey Plaza. This type of information just doesn't come across the same in the pages of a book.

So hearing these accounts along with other information we are basically able to draw our own conclusions just as law enforcement might.As for the assassin or more likely assassins I was most intrigued by the location of the storm drain that offered a concealed position, access for escape and the trajectory for the fatal head shot.As this review is for a shortened version the star rating I give it is less than it would be otherwise.

It was a scattershot effort (of course, the subject is as rococo as rococo gets) and it wasn't perfect, but it had many, many worthwhile pieces of material and interviews, all mixed in together, to be dismissed.In 1995, the History Channel commissioned the same producer to do a chapter 6, ""The Truth Shall Make You Free"". Also some good data, though this time it made the Kennedys look a bit slimier than I appreciate, but that seems to be the media-view today: (Insisting that Bobby maintained ""Operation Mongoose"" against Castro singlehandedly, even after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the poor CIA a hapless pawn in Bobby's evil plans.... yeah, right. Richard Helms would be thrilled). Although Lt. Dan Marvin's interview may have been the most chilling of the entire series.But the real interesting thing is what happened in 2003 when the History Channel, on the 40th anniversary of JFK's assassination, aired 3 additional, new chapters: 7, 8 and 9...I've seen them. These new chapters present mostly old but not-unsubstantially backed-up material about Oswald, as well as ""rumor"" about a certain ex-president's alleged complicity in the assassination.In some circles, it caused an uproar, with Lady Bird, President Carter and Bill Moyers (whom I like very much) reportedly leading the charge to eradicate the Final Chapters from the airwaves and from the market [which is why it's ""out of stock"" now]. The MWKK version still available only includes chapters 1 thru 6.But I wonder: what's the big deal? Students of this subject aren't going to be shocked by the content...
