The other 2 films about  him for me are better.

It flip flopped back and forth in time and showed alot of scenes where Bundy was drinking....drinking near a campfire, drinking while walking down a hall, drinking while driving a beetle, drinking while sitting in a parked beetle.  The movie didn't explain that he was living with a woman while the murders were done..nor did it mention the ski lodge or the 12 year old girl he kidnapped.  The movie was poorly acted, badly directed, lacked alot of information and was just boring.  I watched The Deliberate Stranger a while back and that was an enjoyable Bundy movie....this one was a waste of time and I am glad I didn't pay more than $2.00 for it.",1,this was just bad...,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,754,"['Oh', 'barely', 'made', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'horribly', 'acted', 'missing', 'alot', 'parts', 'flip', 'flopped', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'showed', 'alot', 'scenes', 'where', 'Bundy', 'was', 'drinking', '.drinking', 'campfire', 'drinking', 'walking', 'down', 'hall', 'drinking', 'driving', 'beetle', 'drinking', 'sitting', 'parked', 'beetle', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'explain', 'was', 'living', 'woman', 'murders', 'were', 'done..nor', 'did', 'mention', 'ski', 'lodge', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'acted', 'badly', 'directed', 'lacked', 'alot', 'information', 'was', 'just', 'boring', 'watched', 'Deliberate', 'Stranger', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'Bundy', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'more', '2.00']",Ted Bundy

1255048,AGQY11NLQJ2JL,B00283QEKW,Medusa,"[4, 6]","We all know the life story of Bundy and his killing sprees. The movie tells the infamous, gory details and the insanity he displayed in court. I believe the acting was over the top because it showed that Bundy acted strangely when talking to women, when in reality he acted normal and charming.Perhaps, the most important detail that was left out is that his victims didn't know the truth about him, but during his trial and when it became obvious how evil he was, women were falling head over heels for him. I can't forget the court scene when all women there colored their hair brown and parted it in the middle because they thought Bundy liked it. The fact that some women will fall for bad guys and be fascinated by them is as dark a mystery as the evil Bundy possessed!""The real problem is in the hearts and minds of men.

I thought Corin Nemec did an admirable job as Ted Bundy as did Jen Nikolaisen as his girlfriend Stephanie.  I loved the scene in the restaurant after they rekindle their romance.  The scene in the dorm with the two sleeping coeds is definitely the most gruesome scene in the movie, but this film missed out with a soundtrack that simply didn't fit and some hokey acting by others (the sheriff who arrests him in the desert, the warden and the officer on the stand).  Don't get me wrong, this is a must for those who enjoy serial killer flicks.

1255050,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00283QEKW,Todd Smith,"[2, 2]","Corin Nemec pairs with Director Michael Feifer on their fourth direct-to-video profile of a serial killer. This time the one they chose was Ted Bundy and the movie is not as advertised. Even though their other collaborations have been less than steller, I decided to watch this one, because it was described as a ""drama that traces the path of this charming icon serial killer."" From that, I was hoping to see a biographical film and that's the way it started out. After a half-hour or so, the film unfortunately descended into a blood bath. Ever since establishing himself with the hilarious teen comedy, Parker Lewis Can't Lose, Corky Nemec has turned to the dark side and seems to thrive on playing these twisted evil men. The former teen idol is terrific and gives a really strong performance, but it was the only thing of note in this film. After introducing us to Bundy, the writers stop focusing on the man and focus on his crimes. For the final hour of this film that's all you see, until a macabre ending which tries to show Bundy as some kind of hero, who never had a chance, because of his circumstances. The man brutally butchered as many as seventy woman, but according to this film, it's not his fault, he's just a child who never grew up. The whole premise of the film was ridiculous, it's a blood bath that tries to make Ted Bundy into some kind of victim and it's a slap in the face to the families of his victims. As much as I enjoy seeing Corin Nemec play a psychopath, I'm done with these snuff films that glorify the most evil men the world has even known.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,1577,"['Corin', 'Nemec', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Feifer', 'fourth', 'direct-to-video', 'profile', 'serial', 'killer', 'time', 'one', 'chose', 'was', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'movie', 'not', 'advertised', 'Even', 'other', 'collaborations', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'steller', 'decided', 'watch', 'one', 'was', 'described', 'drama', 'path', 'charming', 'icon', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'biographical', 'film', 'way', 'started', 'out', 'half-hour', 'so', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'descended', 'blood', 'bath', 'Ever', 'establishing', 'hilarious', 'teen', 'comedy', 'Parker', 'Lewis', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Lose', 'Corky', 'Nemec', 'turned', 'dark', 'side', 'thrive', 'playing', 'twisted', 'evil', 'men', 'former', 'teen', 'idol', 'terrific', 'really', 'strong', 'performance', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'note', 'film', 'introducing', 'Bundy', 'writers', 'stop', 'focusing', 'man', 'focus', 'crimes', 'final', 'hour', 'film', 'see', 'macabre', 'ending', 'show', 'Bundy', 'kind', 'hero', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'circumstances', 'man', 'brutally', 'butchered', 'as', 'many', 'seventy', 'woman', 'according', 'film', 'not', 'fault', 'just', 'child', 'who', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'whole', 'premise', 'film', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'blood', 'bath', 'make', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'kind', 'victim', 'slap', 'face', 'families', 'victims', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'play', 'psychopath', ""'m"", 'done', 'snuff', 'films', 'glorify', 'most', 'evil', 'men', 'world', 'even', 'known']",Ted Bundy
