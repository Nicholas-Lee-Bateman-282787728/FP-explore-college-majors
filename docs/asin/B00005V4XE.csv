687414,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00005V4XE,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[7, 9]","""Homicidal"" is a very odd horror film from the master of gimmicks, William Castle. Well it's not really that odd, as the plot and structure are inspired and almost stolen from Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". But it is notably weirder and schlockier, not least of all due to the inclusion of the ""Fright Break""...but more on that later! The film begins by introducing us to a mysterious blonde woman named Emily who gets married to a complete stranger and then stabs the man conducting the wedding ceremony to death, right in the middle of it. Not bad for starters! Emily flees the scene and turns up back at the home she shares with a  mute, wheelchair-bound, elderly woman named Helga. As Emily's behaviour starts to attract suspicion, it's clear that Helga wants to warn people about Emily, but being unable to speak she is unable to make her fears known.Let me say straight away that the actress playing the character of Emily is terrific. To be honest I don't know how much of the effectiveness is down to her being a bad actress or a good one, but I've seldom seen such an out-there performance by someone playing a psychopath, and the mysteriously named Jean Arless (not really an unknown actress, but actually Joan Marshall under a pseudonym) manages to pull it off with great aplomb. Wavering between seductiveness, brittle anger and sheer hysteria, Emily will keep your attention on the screen every time she appears...when her eyes start widening and she grits her teeth, you really believe this is a character capable of doing anything. The fact that she's dolled up like some crazed Doris Day-style, apple-pie cutie with candyfloss blond curls and big starched skirts only adds to her obvious dementia...no wonder Emily is one of my all-time favourite horror movie psychos!Sadly when the deranged Emily is off-screen, the film suffers as its several weaker areas become more apparent. Although there's plenty of action, the other characters are mostly dull and insipid, especially the heroine Miriam and her boyfriend, who are far too sensible and predictably nice to be of much interest. Most troubling of all is the character of Miriam's brother Warren, who almost ruins the film with some very odd appearances. The film has a huge shock twist ending, but it's unlikely to surprise anyone, even someone without any prior information about the plot, which is a shame.But there is still plenty to enjoy. One highlight being Emily's fabulous vandalism of a flower shop. The other being the ""Fright Break""...ah yes. ""Homicidal"" benefits from being one of the few William Castle films with a gimmick that still works when being watched on televison rather than in a theatre. At a certain point in the film, a clock suddenly and unexpectedly appears on the screen and an announcer declares : ""This is the Fright Break...""! Basically, the audience is given the chance to leave if they are too scared to watch what is about to happen...then, when the timer reaches zero, the action re-starts! It looks hilarious and adds a great interactive dimension. You'll have a lot of fun watching this movie.",4,Bonkers,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,3100,"['Homicidal', 'very', 'odd', 'horror', 'film', 'master', 'gimmicks', 'William', 'Castle', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'odd', 'plot', 'structure', 'are', 'inspired', 'almost', 'stolen', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'notably', 'weirder', 'schlockier', 'not', 'least', 'due', 'inclusion', 'Fright', 'Break', 'more', 'later', 'film', 'introducing', 'mysterious', 'blonde', 'woman', 'named', 'Emily', 'who', 'married', 'complete', 'stranger', 'then', 'stabs', 'man', 'conducting', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'death', 'right', 'middle', 'Not', 'bad', 'starters', 'Emily', 'scene', 'up', 'back', 'home', 'shares', 'mute', 'wheelchair-bound', 'elderly', 'woman', 'named', 'Helga', 'Emily', 'behaviour', 'attract', 'suspicion', 'clear', 'Helga', 'warn', 'people', 'Emily', 'being', 'unable', 'speak', 'unable', 'make', 'fears', 'known.Let', 'say', 'straight', 'away', 'actress', 'playing', 'character', 'Emily', 'terrific', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'effectiveness', 'down', 'being', 'bad', 'actress', 'good', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seldom', 'seen', 'out-there', 'performance', 'someone', 'playing', 'psychopath', 'mysteriously', 'named', 'Jean', 'Arless', 'not', 'really', 'unknown', 'actress', 'actually', 'Joan', 'Marshall', 'pseudonym', 'pull', 'off', 'great', 'aplomb', 'Wavering', 'seductiveness', 'brittle', 'anger', 'sheer', 'hysteria', 'Emily', 'will', 'keep', 'attention', 'screen', 'time', 'when', 'eyes', 'start', 'widening', 'teeth', 'really', 'believe', 'character', 'capable', 'doing', 'anything', 'fact', 'dolled', 'up', 'crazed', 'Doris', 'Day-style', 'apple-pie', 'cutie', 'candyfloss', 'blond', 'curls', 'big', 'starched', 'skirts', 'only', 'obvious', 'dementia', 'wonder', 'Emily', 'one', 'all-time', 'favourite', 'horror', 'movie', 'psychos', 'Sadly', 'when', 'deranged', 'Emily', 'off-screen', 'film', 'suffers', 'several', 'weaker', 'areas', 'become', 'more', 'apparent', 'plenty', 'action', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'dull', 'insipid', 'especially', 'heroine', 'Miriam', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'sensible', 'predictably', 'nice', 'be', 'much', 'interest', 'Most', 'troubling', 'character', 'Miriam', 'brother', 'Warren', 'who', 'almost', 'film', 'very', 'odd', 'appearances', 'film', 'huge', 'shock', 'twist', 'ending', 'unlikely', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'even', 'someone', 'prior', 'information', 'plot', 'shame.But', 'still', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'One', 'highlight', 'being', 'Emily', 'fabulous', 'vandalism', 'flower', 'shop', 'other', 'being', 'Fright', 'Break', 'ah', 'yes', 'Homicidal', 'benefits', 'being', 'one', 'few', 'William', 'Castle', 'films', 'gimmick', 'still', 'when', 'being', 'watched', 'televison', 'rather', 'theatre', 'certain', 'point', 'film', 'clock', 'suddenly', 'unexpectedly', 'screen', 'announcer', 'Fright', 'Break', 'Basically', 'audience', 'given', 'chance', 'leave', 'are', 'too', 'scared', 'watch', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'then', 'when', 'timer', 'zero', 'action', 'hilarious', 'great', 'interactive', 'dimension', ""'ll"", 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie']",Homicidal

687417,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B00005V4XE,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[2, 4]","A few of William Castle's dvd movies are becoming harder to buy these days for some reason; they seem to be going out of circulation. Maybe the powers that be will be releasing a fun boxed set one of these days.For those who have not yet seen ""Homicidal"", it is definitely worthwhile if you enjoy those ""so bad they're good"" horror films of the 50's and 60's... particularly if you like anything that's over the top. Well, over the top and collapsed in a heap on the other side.Much of the film does not makes sense, and much of it is laughable (which is the true joy of it).So, that's my advice to newbies.And now for those who are already acquainted with ""Homicidal"", and Emily, Warren, Miriam, and the 'Fright Break':(Spoilers ahead.)I enjoy William Castle's treats. Sure, they're not cinematic horror gems, nor are they the junk of Ed Wood (which I also appreciate). I am not stating anything new when I say that ""Homicidal"" is sort of a blatant ripoff of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". More about that in a moment.One of the characters in ""Homicidal"" is named Miriam Webster. Why the screenwriter chose this moniker (since it already belongs to the dictionary) is beyond me. Okay, so it's the Merriam Webster Dictionary. But when you hear the name, it clicks instantly.For me, William Castle's ""Homicidal"" is a hoot... not as much as his other flicks, but still a hoot.The first murder is so in-your-face and over the top, I crack up every time I see it. It is so strangely photographed, filled with odd closeups and weird angles. Emily seems to delight in the act. It's a sensational sequence, and made even funnier by the fact that on the close shot of the stabbing, the figures are reversed. In the previous full shot, Emily is standing on the right, and the justice of the peace is on the left. As the stabbing is shown, she is somehow on the left side of the screen, and his torso is on the right. It's things like this that I hate. Whoever shot and edited this scene should be throttled, then tarred and feathered. Then pointed at and laughed at.And the justice of the peace grasping onto the drapery just smacks of Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) grasping at the shower curtain in ""Psycho"". Honestly, they really had no shame here.Another blatant borrowing from ""Psycho"" is that Emily's hotel room is laid out very similiarly to Cabin 1 of The Bates Motel.It's all about as subtle as Mardi Gras, isn't it?It actually takes quite a while to figure out the relationships of the characters in this film (a sign of poor writing). At first viewing one might wonder who Emily is to Miriam, who Carl is to Miriam, who Warren is to Helga, and so on... It's rather frustrating on first viewing. And it could have so easily and quickly been clarified by the writer.I think the entire twist is spoiled as soon as Warren makes his first appearance. I don't know how naive movie audiences were in 1961 but I have a feeling that they knew something was up with this strange, petite fellow (whose voice sounded like it wasn't even in the room with the other character he's speaking to; dubbed voices so often sound like they're in a recording booth and not the room of the scene that's being filmed).The characters of Miriam, Carl, and the detective are all clueless because it never occurs to them that Warren and Emily are never seen together at the same time. It's really very funny.There's a lot of funny in this film. When Emily takes Helga to the top of the stairs, then says ""Helga! Now!!!"" and puts the skinny knife at Helga's neck (then the screen fades to black). We're supposed to believe that Helga's head gets sliced off easily, as if it were made of Play Doh?This could have been a decent tale of deceiving the inheritance, but it fails, and ends up being a joke with a flat punchline.I must admit that Mr. Castle's gimmick here, the Fright Break, is hilarious. I would imagine that nobody in theaters back then would have left during this period.I only give three stars because ""Homicidal"", to me, lacks as much fun as other Castle concoctions like ""Strait-Jacket"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"".It's sad, really, because this movie is very much an attempt to trump Hitchock for the success of ""Psycho"", or to cash in on Hitchock's success. Castle could have tried something original. But it's interesting that Hitchcock looked at the horror films of the 1950's that were cheaply made but not scary, and then he made a cheap but extremely scary film of his own.I do enjoy watching ""Homicidal"", because it's so pathetic and ridiculous. But there's an ugly little aftertaste that lingers when I'm done.What's most amusing to me personally is that while Warren looks like a girl in drag, Emily looks like a man in drag.",3,Sensational Horror that's Awful (and yet awfully funny),1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,4711,"['few', 'William', 'Castle', 'dvd', 'movies', 'are', 'becoming', 'harder', 'buy', 'days', 'reason', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'circulation', 'Maybe', 'powers', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'releasing', 'fun', 'boxed', 'set', 'one', 'days.For', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'Homicidal', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'enjoy', 'so', 'bad', ""'re"", 'good', 'horror', 'films', '50', '60', 'particularly', 'like', 'anything', 'top', 'Well', 'top', 'collapsed', 'heap', 'other', 'side.Much', 'film', 'not', 'sense', 'much', 'laughable', 'true', 'joy', 'advice', 'newbies.And', 'now', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'acquainted', 'Homicidal', 'Emily', 'Warren', 'Miriam', ""'Fright"", 'Break', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'enjoy', 'William', 'Castle', 'treats', 'Sure', ""'re"", 'not', 'cinematic', 'horror', 'gems', 'are', 'junk', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'also', 'appreciate', 'am', 'not', 'stating', 'anything', 'new', 'when', 'say', 'Homicidal', 'sort', 'blatant', 'ripoff', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'More', 'moment.One', 'characters', 'Homicidal', 'named', 'Miriam', 'Webster', 'Why', 'screenwriter', 'chose', 'moniker', 'already', 'dictionary', 'Okay', 'Merriam', 'Webster', 'Dictionary', 'when', 'hear', 'name', 'instantly.For', 'William', 'Castle', 'Homicidal', 'hoot', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'flicks', 'still', 'hoot.The', 'first', 'murder', 'so', 'in-your-face', 'top', 'crack', 'up', 'time', 'see', 'so', 'strangely', 'photographed', 'filled', 'odd', 'closeups', 'weird', 'angles', 'Emily', 'delight', 'act', 'sensational', 'sequence', 'made', 'even', 'funnier', 'fact', 'close', 'shot', 'stabbing', 'figures', 'are', 'reversed', 'previous', 'full', 'shot', 'Emily', 'standing', 'right', 'justice', 'peace', 'left', 'stabbing', 'shown', 'somehow', 'left', 'side', 'screen', 'torso', 'right', 'things', 'hate', 'Whoever', 'shot', 'edited', 'scene', 'should', 'be', 'throttled', 'then', 'tarred', 'feathered', 'Then', 'pointed', 'laughed', 'justice', 'peace', 'grasping', 'drapery', 'just', 'smacks', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'Marion', 'Crane', 'grasping', 'shower', 'curtain', 'Psycho', 'Honestly', 'really', 'had', 'shame', 'here.Another', 'blatant', 'borrowing', 'Psycho', 'Emily', 'hotel', 'room', 'laid', 'out', 'very', 'similiarly', 'Cabin', '1', 'Bates', 'Motel.It', 'as', 'subtle', 'Mardi', 'Gras', ""n't"", 'actually', 'while', 'figure', 'out', 'relationships', 'characters', 'film', 'sign', 'poor', 'writing', 'first', 'viewing', 'one', 'might', 'wonder', 'who', 'Emily', 'Miriam', 'who', 'Carl', 'Miriam', 'who', 'Warren', 'Helga', 'so', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'first', 'viewing', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'easily', 'quickly', 'been', 'clarified', 'writer.I', 'think', 'entire', 'twist', 'spoiled', 'as', 'soon', 'Warren', 'first', 'appearance', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'naive', 'movie', 'audiences', 'were', '1961', 'have', 'feeling', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'up', 'strange', 'petite', 'fellow', 'voice', 'sounded', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'room', 'other', 'character', 'speaking', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'so', 'often', 'sound', ""'re"", 'recording', 'booth', 'not', 'room', 'scene', 'being', 'filmed', '.The', 'characters', 'Miriam', 'Carl', 'detective', 'are', 'clueless', 'never', 'Warren', 'Emily', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'together', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'very', 'funny.There', 'lot', 'funny', 'film', 'When', 'Emily', 'Helga', 'top', 'stairs', 'then', 'Helga', 'Now', 'skinny', 'knife', 'Helga', 'neck', 'then', 'screen', 'black', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'Helga', 'head', 'sliced', 'off', 'easily', 'were', 'made', 'Play', 'Doh', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'tale', 'deceiving', 'inheritance', 'up', 'being', 'joke', 'flat', 'punchline.I', 'must', 'admit', 'Mr.', 'Castle', 'gimmick', 'here', 'Fright', 'Break', 'hilarious', 'would', 'imagine', 'nobody', 'theaters', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'only', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'Homicidal', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'other', 'Castle', 'concoctions', 'Strait-Jacket', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', '.It', 'sad', 'really', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'attempt', 'trump', 'Hitchock', 'success', 'Psycho', 'cash', 'Hitchock', 'success', 'Castle', 'could', 'have', 'tried', 'something', 'original', 'interesting', 'Hitchcock', 'looked', 'horror', 'films', '1950', 'were', 'cheaply', 'made', 'not', 'scary', 'then', 'made', 'cheap', 'extremely', 'scary', 'film', 'own.I', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Homicidal', 'so', 'pathetic', 'ridiculous', 'ugly', 'little', 'aftertaste', 'when', ""'m"", 'most', 'amusing', 'personally', 'Warren', 'girl', 'drag', 'Emily', 'man', 'drag']",Homicidal
687418,AAV7I6CYFZ2DB,B00005V4XE,Barry Eysman,"[13, 16]","DVD of ""Homicidal"" by William Castle...... It's especially terrific to see William Castle's""Homicidal"" on DVD, looking and soundingcrisp and new. It's an eerie, sometimes almostunbearably creepy film that proves like his otherhorror films, he was more than showman, he wasa fine filmmaker as well. Because his films werebasically aimed at the kid audience, it's especialfun that this one concerns, in addition tohomicide (which was considered safe viewing forus, somehow), homosexuality, transsexualismand transvestitism. Coming not that long afterthe Christine Jorgensen sex change landmark,could Castle have had this in mind? Perhaps. Ican see him smiling round that huge cigar,knowing he pulled another fast one, and wassubtly subverting legions of children whoseparents thought they were only seeing anotherspook film.With fine performances by Jean Arliss (at last weknow a bit about her, thanks to the fun, nostalgicfeaturette ""Psychette"" on the DVD, that has alsovintage clips of Castle, the joyous hucksterism,the glee at all the money to be made--priceless),always heroic Glenn Corbett, and especially thelovely, talented Patricia Breslin, a script by RobbWhite that jaggedly gets in the nerves and twistsand turns most excruciatingly, and excellentblack and white photography that excelsespecially in this transfer, we enter Castlecountry that is bleak and grim and daring. Whenthe justice of the peace (the great JamesWesterfield) gets it in the stomach, it still is goryenough, still shocking, even when you alreadyhave seen the film several times before. It's all ahaunted house distorting mirror show. Wherehorrible revenge is exacted because of crueltyexperienced in childhood. Where there is anunrelenting justice that comes from the core ofthe character, that old desire to right wrongs thatcan safely be righted in films. And of coursewhen Helga gets decapitated--how can a personbe faulted for cheering?One of the neatest lines ever in film is spoken ina manic whispery trill by Arliss, as she tellscreepy old wheelchair bound mute helplessHelga that the justice of the peace""died--screammmming."" Just remembering thatchills me. The delicious claustrophobia, thewoman who seems like not exactly a woman,with the impressive knife, in the shadow house,making one afraid of her, hypnotized by her, andvery very frightened. It seems the movie takesplace on the weekend. Probably because thatwas when it played. It makes the murders, andthat babbling well meaning doctor who bumblesto a rescue at the end, Corbett's  kind, stalwartdruggist character, Breslin's character'scompassion and decency, Emily's touching sosadly, so gently, the top of the head of a littleboy at the malt counter, a fascinating littlepuzzle, needing to be seen more than once, andalways nettled by Emily, who almost begs us tolook behind the mask, and by Warren whoseown mask belies his masculinity. Something iswonderfully frightfully wrong with these twopersons.It must be a terrible thing, the charade Emily andWarren were forced to play all their lives. I can'tthink of much worse, than the robbing ofidentity, getting everything mixed up, not havinga place in one's self that is one's own. Castle'sfilm asks some serious questions. It's his mostcarefully conceived thoughtful film.Seeing Castle's films on DVD makes one feel athome again. When you could look at a moviescreen and know you had a friend orchestratingthe proceedings. Castle always gave us ourmoney's worth and more. With the gimmicks,the fright break, the cardboard skeletoncareening over audiences, the electric buzzers inthe seats, the coward's corner, the tingler loosein the audience, all the elements to all his variousmovies said this--it's fun to be scared, to be putoff guard, to be thrilled, and then feel a littleloopy after the shock wears off. ""Homicidal""especially haunts. Arliss--we know a bit moreabout her from the ""Psychette""--cold,implacable, is impossible to forget. Alwaysbaffling before the secret is revealed in thefeaturette, or is it?, was the question of whoplayed Emily and who played Warren, realitythus skewered, which was good enough forchildren because when you're a kid, little doesseem real, and as an adult, even less. The scene,before the curtain call, of the fallen doll and thewhip (yes, the whip) on it strikes the right chordof chortle, sadness, scares and the terriblebusiness of revisiting the past when the past is anightmare.The movie is beautifully atmospheric, from thatseedy motel to that dark creep fest of the twistedsouls in that house, and that long long descent ofthe staircase elevator chair coming down anddown with Helga's head perched precariously onher shoulders and then falling, in shadow,off--well, sleep came with difficulty that summernight when I first saw the movie on TV. Andthat was just fine. Castle always took usseriously. He did not condescend to us. Hewanted to show us a good time. These DVDs hewould have absolutely been overjoyed with.  It'sa movie to luxuriate in. To dwell in. It meanssomething. Castle told us childhood is a sucker'sgame too-- right under the noses of Those WhoSaid Just the Opposite. The movie's about morethan murders of the body.  Telling us then andperhaps now, it's a ...scary world, childhoodincluded, don't trust anybody. They ARE afteryou. For no one is as they appear.Like all real classics, you see them years later,there are levels there you didn't noticebefore.

That said, the understated chiller HOMICIDAL is one of his best movies. Marion Webster (Jean Arliss) is a Danish nurse with an American accent, who happens to have HOMICIDAL tendencies (as you'd guess by the title). This first announces itself in the scene where she disembowels the chaplain who conducts her wedding ceremony. Needless to say, the honeymoon doesn't even get underway. Pretty soon Marion is on the lam with the cops are tailing her.Marion finds a new job caring for Helga (Eugenie Leontovich) an elderly woman confined to a wheelchair following a stroke.. Predictably Marion takes advantage of the poor old girl and physically and psychologically torments her, even though Helga tries tapping out warnings to her relatives that she is being abused by this pretty young blond. Or is she?Of course, no Castle movie would be the same without the gimmick. That would be like Herschell Gordon Lewis without the gore and guts, or Russ Meyer without the boobies. For HOMICIDAL, Castle has inserted a 45 second &quot;Fright Break&quot; as a build up to what is to be the movies most notorious sequence to allow timid viewers to leave the room!! Add to this a laughable climactic plot &quot;twist&quot; and you have one of his most entertaining movies.

687424,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00005V4XE,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[10, 10]","One of the most pre-eminent showmen in Hollywood, William Castle, director of such films as The Tingler (1959) and House on Haunted Hill (1959) released Homicidal in 1961, one year after the release of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, Psycho.  Some will say it's a blatant rip off of Psycho, and others will say it's more of a homage, but either way, it's a very entertaining film.The story starts off showing a woman, played by actress Jean Arliss aka Joan Marshall, checking into a hotel and offering a bellboy two grand to marry her.  The bellboy is naturally curious, but the lure of the humongous pile of greenbacks keeps his queries to a minimum.  They arrive at the Justice of the Peace, late in the evening, and the ceremony proceeds, only to end in a very grisly, visceral murder.  Confused?  I was too, but all will be revealed as the film progresses.  The film's plot is fairly intricate, involving murder, money, and mayhem.  The story mainly takes place in a small, southern California town focusing on the remaining family members, a brother and sister, Carl and Miriam Webster, both sharing the same father but different mothers.  Jean Arliss plays Emily, a live-in caretaker for the now elderly mute woman confined to a wheelchair that cared for Warren while he was growing up.  A dark, mysterious family secret drives the film that maintains a stranglehold on the viewer's attention until the very end.  The plot seems very convoluted at the beginning, but the pieces slowly start to fall into place.  I really don't want to get into specifics about the movie, as I fear I will give something away to someone who hasn't see the film, but I will say that Castle really was able to provide suspense pretty much throughout.  You may be able to figure out the twist ending, as I caught on to it later in the film, but it was still very creepy when all was revealed at the end.  There were some plotting gaps, and some of the exposition seemed a bit clunky and forced, but the movie appeared to have as more working for it as it did against it, helping to keep us interested through the 87 minute running time.William Castle, being the showman he was, usually incorporated gimmicks into his movies, ranging from buzzers in theater seats to provide a 'shock' to various patrons for The Tingler (1959) to plastic skeletons suspended on a wire that would fly from the screen towards the audience for the film House on Haunted Hill (1958).  In Homicidal, the gimmick was called Fear Break.  This incorporated certificates that moviegoers would get prior to the start of the feature, which would allow people to get their money back if they got too scared and wanted to leave, but there was a catch.  The Fear Break occurred near the end of the movie, with a 45 second stop clock appearing on the screen, and voice over stating that things were going to get really scary after this point, so if you wanted to leave, do so now.  The catch to redeeming your certificate in order to get you money back was you had to stand in the Coward's Corner, near the exit, until all the movie viewers who stayed had filed out.  Given that this would probably be very embarrassing, I doubt many people tried to take advantage of this gimmick.  It was pretty obvious Castle tried to emulate Hitchcock in many areas, and there are similarities between this film and Psycho, but where Hitchcock was a master director at building up tension and suspense in often subtle methods, Castle more or less would forgo subtly for sensationalism and give it to you both barrels in the face.  Effective, yes, but, in my opinion, nowhere near as frightening.  Castle always seemed a showman first and foremost, and second, a director.This picture on this DVD looks really wonderful, but in standard format.  I was curious as to if someone was going to go through the trouble of digitally remastering a movie, why not present it in its' original format?  Oh well...special features includes trailers for two other Castle films, Straight-Jacket (1964) and Mr. Sardonicus (1961) and a great featurette titled ""Psychette: William Castle and Homicidal"".  If you haven't seen this film before, do not watch the featurette before the movie, as it will give away the 'surprising and shocking' ending.  What would have been a great addition to this would have been a reproduction of the certificate that was handed out at the original screenings on the movie.  While this film is certainly derivative to Hitchcock's Psycho, Homicidal doesn't hold up nearly as well, but then, how many movies could?Cookieman108",4,"""I don't like your eyes, Helga....they see too much!""",1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,4577,"['One', 'most', 'pre-eminent', 'showmen', 'Hollywood', 'William', 'Castle', 'director', 'such', 'films', 'Tingler', '1959', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', '1959', 'released', 'Homicidal', '1961', 'one', 'year', 'release', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'masterpiece', 'Psycho', 'will', 'say', 'blatant', 'rip', 'Psycho', 'others', 'will', 'say', 'more', 'homage', 'way', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film.The', 'story', 'showing', 'woman', 'played', 'actress', 'Jean', 'Arliss', 'aka', 'Joan', 'Marshall', 'checking', 'hotel', 'offering', 'bellboy', 'two', 'grand', 'marry', 'bellboy', 'naturally', 'curious', 'lure', 'humongous', 'pile', 'greenbacks', 'queries', 'minimum', 'arrive', 'Justice', 'Peace', 'late', 'evening', 'ceremony', 'proceeds', 'only', 'end', 'very', 'grisly', 'visceral', 'murder', 'Confused', 'was', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'film', 'film', 'plot', 'fairly', 'intricate', 'involving', 'murder', 'money', 'mayhem', 'story', 'mainly', 'place', 'small', 'southern', 'California', 'town', 'focusing', 'remaining', 'family', 'members', 'brother', 'sister', 'Carl', 'Miriam', 'Webster', 'sharing', 'same', 'father', 'different', 'mothers', 'Jean', 'Arliss', 'Emily', 'live-in', 'caretaker', 'now', 'elderly', 'mute', 'woman', 'confined', 'wheelchair', 'cared', 'Warren', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'family', 'secret', 'film', 'stranglehold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'very', 'end', 'plot', 'very', 'convoluted', 'beginning', 'pieces', 'slowly', 'start', 'fall', 'place', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'specifics', 'movie', 'fear', 'will', 'give', 'something', 'away', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'Castle', 'really', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'suspense', 'pretty', 'much', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'twist', 'ending', 'caught', 'later', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'creepy', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'end', 'were', 'plotting', 'gaps', 'exposition', 'seemed', 'bit', 'clunky', 'forced', 'movie', 'appeared', 'have', 'more', 'working', 'did', 'helping', 'keep', 'interested', '87', 'minute', 'running', 'time.William', 'Castle', 'being', 'showman', 'was', 'usually', 'incorporated', 'gimmicks', 'movies', 'ranging', 'buzzers', 'theater', 'seats', 'provide', ""'shock"", 'various', 'patrons', 'Tingler', '1959', 'plastic', 'skeletons', 'suspended', 'wire', 'would', 'fly', 'screen', 'audience', 'film', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', '1958', 'Homicidal', 'gimmick', 'was', 'called', 'Fear', 'Break', 'incorporated', 'certificates', 'moviegoers', 'would', 'get', 'prior', 'start', 'feature', 'would', 'allow', 'people', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'got', 'too', 'scared', 'wanted', 'leave', 'there', 'was', 'catch', 'Fear', 'Break', 'occurred', 'end', 'movie', '45', 'second', 'stop', 'clock', 'appearing', 'screen', 'voice', 'stating', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'really', 'scary', 'point', 'wanted', 'leave', 'do', 'so', 'now', 'catch', 'redeeming', 'certificate', 'order', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'was', 'had', 'stand', 'Coward', 'Corner', 'exit', 'movie', 'viewers', 'who', 'stayed', 'had', 'filed', 'out', 'Given', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'very', 'embarrassing', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'tried', 'take', 'advantage', 'gimmick', 'was', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Castle', 'tried', 'emulate', 'Hitchcock', 'many', 'areas', 'are', 'similarities', 'film', 'Psycho', 'where', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'master', 'director', 'building', 'up', 'tension', 'suspense', 'often', 'subtle', 'methods', 'Castle', 'more', 'less', 'would', 'forgo', 'subtly', 'sensationalism', 'give', 'barrels', 'face', 'Effective', 'yes', 'opinion', 'nowhere', 'frightening', 'Castle', 'always', 'seemed', 'showman', 'first', 'foremost', 'second', 'director.This', 'picture', 'DVD', 'really', 'wonderful', 'standard', 'format', 'was', 'curious', 'someone', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'trouble', 'digitally', 'remastering', 'movie', 'why', 'not', 'present', 'original', 'format', 'Oh', 'well', 'special', 'features', 'trailers', 'two', 'other', 'Castle', 'films', 'Straight-Jacket', '1964', 'Mr.', 'Sardonicus', '1961', 'great', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Psychette', 'William', 'Castle', 'Homicidal', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'featurette', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'away', ""'surprising"", 'shocking', 'ending', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'addition', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'reproduction', 'certificate', 'was', 'handed', 'out', 'original', 'screenings', 'movie', 'film', 'certainly', 'derivative', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'Homicidal', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'could', 'Cookieman108']",Homicidal
687425,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005V4XE,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 4]","WORD OF WARNING. The DVD has a small but enjoyable package of extras including a making-of-documentary called ""Psychette."" If you have never seen HOMICIDAL, do NOT watch the documentary until you've seen the film: in true spoiler fashion, it reveals the film's famous surprise ending. That said--William Castle ""borrowed"" rather liberally from Hitchcock's slightly earlier PSYCHO for this tale of a knife-wielding blonde beauty--but as usual, he gave it his showman's spin. In theatrical release, the film featured a ""fright break."" As the action approaches a climax, a clockface appears on the screen and Castle himself urges those too terrified to return to the lobby for a full refund. But there was, of course, a catch: you had to walk (usually in yellow footsteps applied to the carpet) past the jeering audience and agree to sit in ""The Coward's Corner"" until the movie was over and every one had filed out past you! Needless to say, few (if any) movie-goers ever took him up on it.But the famous ""Fright Break"" isn't the only thing HOMICIDAL has going for it. The story itself is more sophistocated than that of most William Castle films, and the female leads are quite effective. Jean Arless, a surprising beauty, is quite startling as ""The Homicidal Girl""--a blonde bombshell who has a way with a knife--while both Patricia Breslin and Eugenie Leontovich are quite convincing as two of those on her list of intended victims. And lastly, the film offers a surprise conclusion that can still blindside some less suspecting viewers even today. That aside, HOMICIDAL has plenty of camp appeal, all of it resting on Jean Arless' WAY over the top performance as she entices, ices, and slices her way from one victim to the next--and as one reviewer has already remarked, you'll feel pretty sure that Annie Lennox borrowed Arless' look (and in some pretty unexpected ways, too) for several of her videos.I must admit that I don't consider HOMICIDAL in the same league with other William Castle schlock-favorites such as 13 GHOSTS, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, or STRAIT-JACKET--largely, I think, because it seems Castle really is making a bid for cinematic respectability here and that sorta detracts from the fun.

I also enjoyed the scene involving an ominous black briefcase containing a slip of paper with a prescription on it. The briefcase opens, we cut away and we don't see what's inside. And why does Emily need a heavy black briefcase to carry a slip of paper? The scene in the floral shop is a classic.

687430,A5ZJFVV0564T6,B00005V4XE,"Ilona Novotny ""Eccentric""","[3, 3]","Alfred Hitchcock may very well have borrowed a page from gimmick king William Castle's book when he devised the advertising campaign for his legendary shocker, ""Psycho"". The advertisements for ""Psycho"" strongly stated that one one would be allowed into the theater once the picture had started, and this was strictly enforced.  Some theaters even provided chairs for patrons to sit in while waiting on line for the next showing!  A great publicity move for a great movie. Which now brings us back to Mr. Castle. The gimmick for ""Homicidal"" was a ""Fright Break"", which came just before the climax of the film. A clock appeared on the screen, allowing 45 seconds for viewers who were ""too frightened"" to stay for the end of the picture to leave, but they would have to stand in ""Coward's Corner"", a yellow-painted booth in the lobby. These chickenhearts would also have to sign a certificate which stated, ""I am a bona fide coward"". Oh, that Bill Castle! ""Homicidal"" is the story of a tall, willowy blonde named Emily who happens to be a psychotic, knife-wielding killer. Emily pays a hunky bellhop $2,000 to marry her in a midnight ceremony, and then stabs the justice of the peace to death! Since Emily is far too young to blame her sudden nasty behavior on hormones, it's obvious that she has a couple of screws loose. Taking it on the lam following the rather unorthodox ceremony, leaving the groom at the altar (now that's a switch!), Emily dashes to her car and drives off to the gloomy old house where she lives with her husband Warren, a rather epicene-looking young man.  They have recently returned from Denmark with Helga, Warren's former nursemaid, who is now wheelchair-bound, mute and paralyzed due to a stroke. Helga distrusts and fears Emily (wouldn't you be a little nervous around this loony Barbie doll?), and knows too much for her own good.  Warren's half-sister Miriam doesn't care too much for Emily either, and is rather disturbed by her strange and unpleasant behavior. The fact that Emily went into Miriam's flower shop and destroyed several figurines and a wedding wreath doesn't exactly endear her to Miriam. I won't divulge any more of the plot (I've probably told too much already), but the film has a reasonable amount of suspense, builds very nicely to its climax, and may genuinely surprise some with its ""twist"". The film is more of a homage than a rip-off of ""Psycho"", and is at least more interesting and entertaining than Brian DePalma's shrill ""homages"", the tiresome sequels, and the awful Gus Van Sant remake.  The late Joan Marshall, acting under the pseudonym ""Jean Arless"", is very good as the lovely, twisted Emily, and renowned stage actress Eugenie Leontovich is quite good as the noisy Helga (she can't speak, but she makes a hell of a ruckus anyway!) Patricia Breslin and Glenn Corbett lend good support as Miriam and the befuddled bellhop. The great Hugo Friedhofer composed the music score. Having composed for such ""respectable"" films as ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", ""The Lodger"", and ""The Rains of Ranchipur"", one can only assume that he was paid well for this ""B"". To give William Castle his due, the film is directed with visual flair and style, and I would safely guess that he must have sat through ""Psycho"" at least 20 times!The picture and sound quality on the DVD are excellent, the picture quality unbelievably sharp and rich. The ""making of"" featurette, ""Psychette"", is fun, including footage of Mr.Castle asking theater patrons how they liked the picture, ""I liked it much better than 'Psycho'!"" (gulp!), but it is all-too-brief. ""Homicidal"" is not the disturbing, stay-with-you cinematic masterpiece that ""Psycho"" is, but it is a lot of fun. It has that wonderful thread (hell, rope!) of ludicrousness that runs through it, the unmistakable hallmark of a William Castle film.  One final observation: earlier in this review, I stated that William Castle must have seen ""Psycho"" at least 20 times. I have a strong belief that Eurythmics' Annie Lennox must have seen ""Homicidal"" just as many!",5,"...""Who was that man I saw you with?""",1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,4052,"['Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'borrowed', 'page', 'gimmick', 'king', 'William', 'Castle', 'book', 'when', 'devised', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'legendary', 'shocker', 'Psycho', 'advertisements', 'Psycho', 'strongly', 'stated', 'one', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'theater', 'picture', 'had', 'started', 'was', 'strictly', 'enforced', 'theaters', 'even', 'provided', 'chairs', 'patrons', 'sit', 'waiting', 'line', 'next', 'showing', 'great', 'publicity', 'move', 'great', 'movie', 'now', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Castle', 'gimmick', 'Homicidal', 'was', 'Fright', 'Break', 'came', 'just', 'climax', 'film', 'clock', 'appeared', 'screen', 'allowing', '45', 'seconds', 'viewers', 'who', 'were', 'too', 'frightened', 'stay', 'end', 'picture', 'leave', 'would', 'have', 'stand', 'Coward', 'Corner', 'yellow-painted', 'booth', 'lobby', 'chickenhearts', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'sign', 'certificate', 'stated', 'am', 'bona', 'fide', 'coward', 'Oh', 'Bill', 'Castle', 'Homicidal', 'story', 'tall', 'willowy', 'blonde', 'named', 'Emily', 'who', 'be', 'psychotic', 'knife-wielding', 'killer', 'Emily', 'hunky', 'bellhop', '2,000', 'marry', 'midnight', 'ceremony', 'then', 'stabs', 'justice', 'peace', 'death', 'Emily', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'blame', 'sudden', 'nasty', 'behavior', 'hormones', 'obvious', 'couple', 'screws', 'loose', 'Taking', 'lam', 'following', 'rather', 'unorthodox', 'ceremony', 'leaving', 'groom', 'altar', 'now', 'switch', 'Emily', 'car', 'off', 'gloomy', 'old', 'house', 'where', 'husband', 'Warren', 'rather', 'epicene-looking', 'young', 'man', 'have', 'recently', 'returned', 'Denmark', 'Helga', 'Warren', 'former', 'nursemaid', 'who', 'now', 'wheelchair-bound', 'mute', 'paralyzed', 'due', 'stroke', 'Helga', 'distrusts', 'fears', 'Emily', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'little', 'nervous', 'loony', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'too', 'much', 'own', 'good', 'Warren', 'half-sister', 'Miriam', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'much', 'Emily', 'rather', 'disturbed', 'strange', 'unpleasant', 'behavior', 'fact', 'Emily', 'went', 'Miriam', 'flower', 'shop', 'destroyed', 'several', 'figurines', 'wedding', 'wreath', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'endear', 'Miriam', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'more', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'told', 'too', 'much', 'already', 'film', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'suspense', 'very', 'nicely', 'climax', 'may', 'genuinely', 'surprise', 'twist', 'film', 'more', 'homage', 'rip-off', 'Psycho', 'least', 'more', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'Brian', 'DePalma', 'shrill', 'homages', 'tiresome', 'sequels', 'awful', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'remake', 'late', 'Joan', 'Marshall', 'acting', 'pseudonym', 'Jean', 'Arless', 'very', 'good', 'lovely', 'twisted', 'Emily', 'renowned', 'stage', 'actress', 'Eugenie', 'Leontovich', 'quite', 'good', 'noisy', 'Helga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'hell', 'ruckus', 'anyway', 'Patricia', 'Breslin', 'Glenn', 'Corbett', 'lend', 'good', 'support', 'Miriam', 'befuddled', 'bellhop', 'great', 'Hugo', 'Friedhofer', 'composed', 'music', 'score', 'Having', 'composed', 'such', 'respectable', 'films', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'Lodger', 'Rains', 'Ranchipur', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'paid', 'well', 'B', 'give', 'William', 'Castle', 'due', 'film', 'directed', 'visual', 'flair', 'style', 'would', 'safely', 'guess', 'must', 'have', 'sat', 'Psycho', 'least', '20', 'times', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'are', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'unbelievably', 'sharp', 'rich', 'making', 'featurette', 'Psychette', 'fun', 'including', 'footage', 'Mr.Castle', 'asking', 'theater', 'patrons', 'how', 'liked', 'picture', 'liked', 'much', 'better', ""'Psycho"", 'gulp', 'all-too-brief', 'Homicidal', 'not', 'disturbing', 'stay-with-you', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Psycho', 'lot', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'thread', 'hell', 'rope', 'ludicrousness', 'unmistakable', 'hallmark', 'William', 'Castle', 'film', 'One', 'final', 'observation', 'earlier', 'review', 'stated', 'William', 'Castle', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'Psycho', 'least', '20', 'times', 'have', 'strong', 'belief', 'Eurythmics', 'Annie', 'Lennox', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'Homicidal', 'just', 'many']",Homicidal

""Homicidal"" was one I had not seen and so, having been recommended to me due to it's strange Solvang, California (a quaint, Danish tourist trap of a community north of Santa Barbara) setting, I immediately moved it to the top of my queue. It was the typical William castle romp only, instead of the supernatural elements and technical gimmickry one would come to expect from Castle, this one offered more psychological chills with many ideas, and even some shots hilariously and incongruously lifted right from Hitchcock's Psycho, released only 1 year earlier. And this time Castle's gimmick was a twist ending, (DON""T watch the making of documentary on the disc before the film, as I did, as it immediately give away the surprise ending and could ruin the film for the viewer) and a ""Fright Break"" in which, just before the films climax it literally pauses for 45 seconds and a clock appears on the screen allowing audience members that are too frightened by the film time to exit and put themselves on display in the ""Coward's Corner"" of the theater lobby for all the braver patrons to see and scorn as they file out.

This is just the beginning of a very weird tale and one of William Castle's more effective shockers. The blonde, Emily, is a nurse for a mute wheelchair bound old woman--Helga--a former nanny to Warren and Miriam, a brother and sister who grew up in the big spooky old house where Helga and Emily reside. While the murder is under investigation, it becomes apparent that Emily is up to more unsavory doings. She implicates Miriam in the murder and claims she's ""married"" Warren (a strangely unmasculine sort) leaving Miriam as the unlikely focus of the investigation. Warren and Emily are never seen together. Helga is terrified of Emily (with good reason it soon turns out) and can communicate only by pounding a doorknob on the arm of her wheelchair. Emily is threatening Helga when no one is around. There's evidence of child abuse involving Helga and ""Warren"" as a child and a hint that ""Emily"" has just returned from Denmark. The climax features Castle's gimmick of a ""Fright Break""---a clock appears on the screen giving the audience one minute to run before all hell breaks loose. This is a creepy little puzzler that is just plain enjoyable to watch. Jean Arless is dynamic as ""Emily"" and the DVD transfer is immaculate. The cast encore at the end is an eye opener.

Anyone who knows the films of William Castle knows that they are schlocky, gimmicky & always entertaining. I saw this as a child and was frightened repeatedly; it never came out on video so I taped it off AMC or TMC. Imagine my surprise on DVD, a perfectly crisp & clear transfer with great sound...and Von Dexter has composed the scores for Castle's best films, and he does not disappoint. The DVD is great because it has extras...spoilers, for those who haven't seen this...one previous reviewer... gave away the suprise ending. Never mind. Even knowing this film well encourages repeated viewings. Jean Arless, of course, is the centerpiece here, and it's a good thing she didn't use her real name (the actress, Jean Marshall, didn't want to be ""type-cast""...). It's really an exercise in over-acting and she did not hold back! I don't know how Castle convinced the great acting coach, Eugenie Leontovich, to perform in his film, but it's a treasure. She doesn't actually have a lot to do except glower & look scared, but it's a confident display of a true master. Glenn Corbett and Patricia Breslin (a popular TV actress of the period, The Jackie Cooper Show) were very good-looking and played the ingenue sweethearts that you genuinely liked. I would like to know what happened to Richard Rust (the handsome Jim Nesbitt character). He died young, but his career should've been grander. OK...so, notice this: When the detective visits Breslin at her flower shop, has Nesbitt identify her, and they leave...why does he put on the police car siren as they drive away? What doctor prescribed the prescription that Emily went to fill? When Corbett's character suggests to Warren that it was ""a similar pattern as the Adrins murder""...to what was he referring? There are so many inconsistancies, most of which come to mind after the resolution of the plot, and, sure, Castle said it was an homage to ""Psycho"" (checking into a hotel, etc.) and some of the well-directed camerawork showed the Hitchcockian shots that reminded the audience that they should keep alert (the knife in the magazine, etc.). Remember when doctors made house calls...? He happened to be in the neighborhood? William Castle is not one of our greatest directors of all time. But, to be sure, he probably took more pride in his work than most. He also worked exclusively with original screenplays. They may be criticized for being derivitive, but he certainly made every film his own, and carried it one step further. I like this film, on many levels...but I happen to be an afficiado of bad acting and unbelievable plots. 13 GHOSTS had humor; THE TINGLER was certainly far-fetched (but kept everyone wondering) and HOMICIDAL was probably his most well-plotted, just enough to make it ""special"" from PSYCHO. If you've read this far, you're probably a fan of the film. And, so am I. CASTLE RULES! When will ""Macabre"" be available?Only drawback is that it's not in Widescreen.

Roger Corman gave us trash on a non-existant budget that was fun. Mr. B.I.G., Bert I. Gordon gave us well,...BIG: AMAZING COLLOSAL MAN, CYCLOPS, GIANT SPIDER INVASION, BEGINNING OF THE END, etc., and again fun.William Castle is all together a different story. He had the ability to make a low budget go a long way and generate such classics as Vincent Price's HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and THE TINGLER. Riding the crest of Hitchcock's PSYCHO and Aldrich's WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? Castle placed Joan Crawford into STRAIT JACKET and Barbara Stanwick into THE NIGHT WALKER, both highly suspenseful, credible motion pictures on minimalistic budgets. And unlike Corman and Gordon, Castle's films had a real polish to them, a fine noirish feel with competent acting and production values.And so, HOMICIDAL, which I belive is Castle's best film by far. I truly liked it better than PSYCO, which outside the shower scene, is nowhere near as interesting and ultimately disturbing as HOMICIDAL. Jean Arliss, simply outstanding!

687444,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005V4XE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Homicidal (William Castle, 1961)Oh, my god. I cannot believe I didn't see that ending coming. The funny thing is, less than thirty seconds before the Big Reveal, I'd said to myself, ""man, it seems like Castle really ripped off [name of movie that would give away the big surprise]!"" And yet my jaw still hit the floor. Because of this, I'm inclined to rate Homicidal a lot higher than I would have, William Castle joints are, by and large, basement-budget potboilers short on talent and long on cheap thrills, but even a cheap thrill really works once in a while, and man, did it ever here.Homicidal opens with a bang--we meet a blonde bombshell named Emily (TV stalwart Joan Marshall in one of her few big-screen appearances) who checks into a hotel, specifies a handsome bellhop, and then propositions him--two thousand dollars if he'll marry her on September 6th. He accepts, and the two of them head out to see Alfred S. Adrims, Justice of the Peace (The Absent-Minded Professor's James Westerfield), late at night. He agrees to do the ceremony despite the late hour, but it ends with quite a surprise--Emily repeatedly stabs him, then runs off, leaving her new husband and a screaming widow in the lurch. She repairs to the family homestead to lay low until the investigation blows over, but while there, she finds herself attracted to Karl (Midway's Glenn Corbett), not only the local druggist, but also the steady boyfriend of Emily's half-sister Miriam (I Saw What You Did's Patricia Breslin). But that's not all there is to this story, not at all...I realized what I'd been missing when trolling IMDB for information on the actors: the screenplay was written by the brilliant Robb White, equally adept as a screenwriter (he also partnered with Castle on the latter's other best flick, Thirteen Ghosts) and a novelist (Up Periscope, Deathwatch).

She has a habit of stabbing people to death, vandalizing flower shops, being a straight up b*$!h, and other assorted mischief.  She's been brought to America by her husband, Warren and is taking care of an invalid mute woman at their home.  Warren's half sister is thrown into the mix as well, and pretty soon what we got here is a mystery involving murder, family and inheritance.  William Castle decided to take a break from ghosties and monsters and take a....ahem....stab at Alfred Hitchcock/Robert Bloch kind of material.  I must say he does a very good job, better than you think he would with this kind of material.  Even his little campy introduction and the famous ""fright break"" doesn't hurt any of the mystery or suspense of the film, but simply reminds you you're watching a William Castle film.  It's extremely derivative of ""Psycho"", but nobody seems to complain about this because it's so blatantly obvious that that's what Castle is doing, and he makes no attempts to hide it, but rather winks at the audience about it.  It's not a spoof though, nor is it really campy(only the intro and the ""fright break""), it's actually a good movie.  Some people actually like it more than Psycho(as shown in the featurette).

I got that, but I also got a pretty taut little thriller.  The first murder is suprisingly gory and quite shocking and sets the tone for the rest of this flick.  ""Jean Arless"" is riveting as the bad girl anti-heroine; she looks like serial-killer Barbie, and comes complete with Solvang death mansion.  She has a great way of half-crooning, half-hissing her lines (like the title to this review) that's fairly creepy.  The supporting cast is okay, and the location is pretty neat: Solvang in the 60's before it turned completely into a dutch-themed tourist trap.  This is one of those movies that work well with a really low budget.  Shooting in the early morning gives the dusty, deserted streets of the one-horse town a really desolate feeling that makes the shops and houses of Solvang really enjoyably creepy.  And there are enough red herrings that some people (including me- I guessed totally wrong) will be actually surprised at the ending.
