1671547,A7POR5U851RYI,B00FG1N9VU,Sylvia Domingue,"[0, 0]","My love for the Mannings all started with the family patriach Archie Manning in 1969. He was a great quarterback who had the talent but unfortunately played for below 500 teams throughout his NFL career. I always thought that was so unfair to Archie.But his football prowess was passed on to his two sons, Peyton & Eli, who have 3 Super Bowl MVPs & 3 Super Bowl rings between them. Peyton Manning has accumulated NFL records that are untouchable for years to come & is 2nd all time in total yards, pass attempts & pass completions. Eli himself has blossomed from being Peyton's younger brother to a 2 time Super Bowl winner & one of the NFLs most elite quarterbacks. And to think it all started with papa Archie Manning. If all this information doesnot varify or solidify proof that The Mannings are the greatest football family of all time, then those who question or doubt these facts must be living in a parelllel universe.",5,The Mannings: America's Football Family,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,926,"['love', 'Mannings', 'started', 'family', 'patriach', 'Archie', 'Manning', '1969', 'was', 'great', 'quarterback', 'who', 'had', 'talent', 'unfortunately', 'played', '500', 'teams', 'NFL', 'career', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'unfair', 'Archie.But', 'football', 'prowess', 'was', 'passed', 'two', 'sons', 'Peyton', 'Eli', 'who', 'have', '3', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'MVPs', '3', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'rings', 'Peyton', 'Manning', 'accumulated', 'NFL', 'records', 'are', 'untouchable', 'years', 'come', '2nd', 'time', 'total', 'yards', 'pass', 'attempts', 'pass', 'completions', 'Eli', 'blossomed', 'being', 'Peyton', 'younger', 'brother', '2', 'time', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'winner', 'one', 'NFLs', 'most', 'elite', 'quarterbacks', 'think', 'started', 'papa', 'Archie', 'Manning', 'information', 'doesnot', 'varify', 'solidify', 'proof', 'Mannings', 'are', 'greatest', 'football', 'family', 'time', 'then', 'who', 'question', 'doubt', 'facts', 'must', 'be', 'living', 'parelllel', 'universe']",ESPN: The Book of Manning
