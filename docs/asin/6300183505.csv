It has her incredible performance of Ball and Chain at Monterey ('67), some Cheap Thrills studio sessions ('68), Woodstock ('69), and Calgary ('70).  She blows away the audience on Dick Cavett with Move Over and breaks down during the High School reunion interviews.  Where she came from in Port Arthur, TX is such a contrast to who she was.  And who she was was the incarnation of the Spirit of the 1960s counter-culture.We get 2 great performances of Piece of My Heart, one of Tell Mama, Try, and Summertime both live and in studio.  If you really get into this you might, just might, see God in Janis.  She seeps sexuality in her performances, and reveals substantial depth of insight and intellect when interviewed.  Even as we are in the midst of our 21st century Brittany Spears culture, we can go back to this and know there was once an unflinching soaring eagle in free flight.",5,"Excellent documentary shows the heart, and spirit of Janis",1064534400,"09 26, 2003",2003,1004,"['1974', 'documentary', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'best', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'spontaneous', 'interviews', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Ball', 'Chain', 'Monterey', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', 'studio', 'sessions', 'Woodstock', 'Calgary', 'away', 'audience', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'Move', 'Over', 'breaks', 'down', 'High', 'School', 'reunion', 'interviews', 'Where', 'came', 'Port', 'Arthur', 'TX', 'such', 'contrast', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'was', 'incarnation', 'Spirit', '1960s', 'counter-culture.We', 'get', '2', 'great', 'performances', 'Piece', 'My', 'Heart', 'one', 'Tell', 'Mama', 'Try', 'Summertime', 'live', 'studio', 'really', 'get', 'might', 'just', 'might', 'see', 'God', 'Janis', 'sexuality', 'performances', 'reveals', 'substantial', 'depth', 'insight', 'intellect', 'when', 'interviewed', 'Even', 'are', 'midst', '21st', 'century', 'Brittany', 'Spears', 'culture', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'know', 'was', 'once', 'unflinching', 'soaring', 'eagle', 'free', 'flight']",Janis: The Way She Was VHS

Instead I was merely shown a few short interviews spliced between concert performances.  There is no depth here, unless you read between the lines of her music (which tells a very strong story and yet just isn&#8217;t enough here).

Some of her greatest hits are featured here (""Ball and Chain,"" ""Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)"" and ""Move Over,"" among others).  There really was never anyone quite like Janis, and there never will be.  She had a combination of fiery sexuality, heartwrenching lyrics and the ability to deliver songs filled with feeling and passion, at times, even wailing the lyrics.

203492,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300183505,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 0]","How disappointing that this remarkable performance film is not currently on DVD (in North America anyway).What's notable about JANIS is that while it's billed as a documementary,  it really IS a performance film (mainly).  After Janis died in 1970, there was so much analysis over WHO she was and WHAT she meant, but the subtitle to this film (at least for the video version is simply ""THE WAY SHE WAS,"" and after all the verbiage that proliferated in the early to mid-70s, it turns out that the best way to find out ""how she was"" really is to see her in her performance--and while it's truly unfortunate that there really all that much performance footage available from Janis' relatively short career, the filmmakers managed to assemble much of the best available stuff for this 1974 classic rock'n'roll film.So, yeah, it's technically a documentary, and the interview segments give you additional insight into Janis' personage AND persona, the assumption is that the viewer pretty much KNOWS most of that stuff anyway.  Do you need someone else telling you that beneath that tough exterior was a (hyper)sensitive interior?  I doubt it.  In the intervening years, the ""mean mean mama"" of a tune like ""Turtle Blues"" has become inextricably mingled with the ""Little Girl Blue.""  Actually, it was ever thus.  The trick was how those tensions all played out on stage and in the recording studio.  It was in her performances that all her contradictions came out and blended seamlessly, for the most part.Interesting too that the clips from her final months show Janis to be in good voice, for the most part, and reasonably energized onstage.  One of the reasons her management supposedly refused to have the existing footage of her Woodstock performance (a bit more than a year before her death) included in the documentary of the same name was that her performance was iffy at best. (Some say she was strung out.)  The clips included here show her perhaps not at her absolute best, but solid enough.  I don't know how many bands you could say were in absolute top form at that event.  And at the time, inspired performances seemed to be almost beside the point--when what was INSPRIRATIONAL (allegedly) was just being there.As for the Full Tilt Boogie clips from her final year, well, it has been stated that that group WAS tight and, in many ways, the most technically proficient of all her three bands.  Still some of the live tracks that surfaced in audio form on the posthumous JOPLIN IN CONCERT album showed considerable vocal strain.  Turns out that some of the video included in the film is from the exact same performances (the Canadian train tour) and with the visual to augment the performances, you'd swear she was in rare form.  So she can't quite duplicate live the scathing wails from the studio version of ""Try,"" for instance.  She's working the band--and the audience--and ultimately making it WORK.Back in the late 60s, it would have been next to impossible to do a film of a single concert.  The marketing of packaging an entire show on film or video seems to have mainly come about only later--as a by-product of the home video revolution.  In format, JANIS really isn't all THAT different from WOODSTOCK, MONTERREY POP or MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMEN, say.  It is basically a compilation of various performances, some on stage some from television, tacked together in less-than-strict chronologial order.But since it was compiled posthumously, there may well have been a temptation to do interview segments with, I dunno, people like Chet Helms or Sam Andrew--or more peripheral figures in Janis' life (like Grace Slick, say) or maybe people you'd never heard of but who claimed to be close like publicist/biographer Myra Friedman.  Wisely, they avoided that trap.  By 1974, I think people were all talked out (and had heard enough) about Janis' troubled life and hard times.  What they needed a sense of was what was it about her live performances that was so magic.If it can't quite capture the magic of an actual live performance, this film at least gives the contemporary audience a clue as to what all the fuss was all about.  And it does a pretty good job of it.  Kudos to filmmakers Howard Alk and Seaton Findley for taking the mainly-music approach.  It may not tell the whole story.  But it does pretty much show you ""the way she was.",4,THE WAY SHE WAS...AS REFLECTED IN HER MUSIC.,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,4356,"['How', 'disappointing', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'film', 'not', 'currently', 'DVD', 'North', 'America', 'anyway', '.What', 'notable', 'JANIS', 'billed', 'documementary', 'really', 'performance', 'film', 'mainly', 'Janis', 'died', '1970', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'analysis', 'WHO', 'was', 'WHAT', 'meant', 'subtitle', 'film', 'least', 'video', 'version', 'simply', 'WAY', 'SHE', 'WAS', 'verbiage', 'proliferated', 'early', 'mid-70s', 'out', 'best', 'way', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'was', 'really', 'see', 'performance', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'really', 'much', 'performance', 'footage', 'available', 'Janis', 'relatively', 'short', 'career', 'filmmakers', 'managed', 'assemble', 'much', 'best', 'available', 'stuff', '1974', 'classic', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'film.So', 'yeah', 'technically', 'documentary', 'interview', 'segments', 'give', 'additional', 'insight', 'Janis', 'personage', 'persona', 'assumption', 'viewer', 'pretty', 'much', 'KNOWS', 'most', 'stuff', 'anyway', 'Do', 'need', 'someone', 'else', 'telling', 'beneath', 'tough', 'exterior', 'was', 'hyper', 'sensitive', 'interior', 'doubt', 'intervening', 'years', 'mean', 'mean', 'mama', 'tune', 'Turtle', 'Blues', 'become', 'inextricably', 'mingled', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Blue', 'Actually', 'was', 'ever', 'thus', 'trick', 'was', 'how', 'tensions', 'played', 'out', 'stage', 'recording', 'studio', 'was', 'performances', 'contradictions', 'came', 'out', 'blended', 'seamlessly', 'most', 'part.Interesting', 'too', 'clips', 'final', 'months', 'show', 'Janis', 'be', 'good', 'voice', 'most', 'part', 'reasonably', 'energized', 'onstage', 'One', 'reasons', 'management', 'supposedly', 'refused', 'have', 'existing', 'footage', 'Woodstock', 'performance', 'bit', 'more', 'year', 'death', 'included', 'documentary', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'performance', 'was', 'iffy', 'best', 'say', 'was', 'strung', 'out', 'clips', 'included', 'here', 'show', 'perhaps', 'not', 'absolute', 'best', 'solid', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'bands', 'could', 'say', 'were', 'absolute', 'top', 'form', 'event', 'time', 'inspired', 'performances', 'seemed', 'be', 'almost', 'point', 'when', 'what', 'was', 'INSPRIRATIONAL', 'allegedly', 'was', 'just', 'being', 'there.As', 'Full', 'Tilt', 'Boogie', 'clips', 'final', 'year', 'well', 'been', 'stated', 'group', 'WAS', 'tight', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'technically', 'proficient', 'three', 'bands', 'Still', 'live', 'tracks', 'surfaced', 'audio', 'form', 'posthumous', 'JOPLIN', 'IN', 'CONCERT', 'album', 'showed', 'considerable', 'vocal', 'strain', 'out', 'video', 'included', 'film', 'exact', 'same', 'performances', 'Canadian', 'train', 'tour', 'visual', 'augment', 'performances', ""'d"", 'swear', 'was', 'rare', 'form', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'duplicate', 'live', 'scathing', 'wails', 'studio', 'version', 'Try', 'instance', 'working', 'band', 'audience', 'ultimately', 'making', 'WORK.Back', 'late', '60s', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'next', 'impossible', 'do', 'film', 'single', 'concert', 'marketing', 'packaging', 'entire', 'show', 'film', 'video', 'have', 'mainly', 'come', 'only', 'later', 'by-product', 'home', 'video', 'revolution', 'format', 'JANIS', 'really', ""n't"", 'different', 'WOODSTOCK', 'MONTERREY', 'POP', 'MAD', 'DOGS', 'AND', 'ENGLISHMEN', 'say', 'basically', 'compilation', 'various', 'performances', 'stage', 'television', 'tacked', 'together', 'less-than-strict', 'chronologial', 'order.But', 'was', 'compiled', 'posthumously', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'temptation', 'do', 'interview', 'segments', 'dunno', 'people', 'Chet', 'Helms', 'Sam', 'Andrew', 'more', 'peripheral', 'figures', 'Janis', 'life', 'Grace', 'Slick', 'say', 'maybe', 'people', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'close', 'publicist/biographer', 'Myra', 'Friedman', 'Wisely', 'avoided', 'trap', '1974', 'think', 'people', 'were', 'talked', 'out', 'had', 'heard', 'enough', 'Janis', 'troubled', 'life', 'hard', 'times', 'What', 'needed', 'sense', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'performances', 'was', 'so', 'magic.If', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'magic', 'actual', 'live', 'performance', 'film', 'least', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'clue', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Kudos', 'filmmakers', 'Howard', 'Alk', 'Seaton', 'Findley', 'taking', 'mainly-music', 'approach', 'may', 'not', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'way', 'was']",Janis: The Way She Was VHS

The photos were tiny, but I marvelled at a woman who looked to be wailing like a wild animal - hair frizzy and flying, mouth open wide enough to swallow the rest of the 8 X 10 book! Then my first experience of hearing her voice was in 1980 - I heard 'Move Over' on the radio one Sunday lunchtime, and I could not continue eating my food! I hadn't heard a woman sound like that and I was enthralled.

It should also be noted that Grace Slick, along with members of the Jefferson Airplane, were good friends with Janis and all lived in the San Francisco Haight-Asbury area as they build their music careers. Grace and Janis were THE two women of the 60's that were pivotal in shaping rock music as we know it today.",5,Fantastic Video,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,434,"['fantastic', 'compilation', 'video', 'Janis', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Janis', 'music', 'was', '25', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'Grace', 'Slick', 'members', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'were', 'good', 'friends', 'Janis', 'lived', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Haight-Asbury', 'area', 'build', 'music', 'careers', 'Grace', 'Janis', 'were', 'THE', 'two', 'women', '60', 'were', 'pivotal', 'shaping', 'rock', 'music', 'know', 'today']",Janis: The Way She Was VHS

There's lots of scenes of Janis talking and early pics of her life. She comes across as having been honest and unpretentious. Her high school reunion scene is funny and sad at the same time and it's the only place where she appears uncomfortable. The music is great and this film is well put together.

203498,A178LLZ84A2JB5,6300183505,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[1, 1]","This film chronicles the life and times, of singer Janis Joplin.  She was one of the most important rock icon, of the 60s. And not only because of her incredibly intense singing style, but also because Janis lived life on her own terms. No other female rock singer before Janis, ever conveyed the blistering, fierce emotions, that were typical of her stage performances.The film shows Janis in several live performances, over the course of her career. Including her spectacular performances on the Dick Cavette Show, at Woodstock, the Montery Pop Festival, etc.  Much of this movie also includes several interviews, with Janis herself.  She speaks frankly about why she chose to be a singer, her relationship with her family, and her difficulties growing-up in her ultraconservative hometown, Port Arthur, Texas.Janis is even shown attending her High school reunion in Port Arthur, after she becomes famous. She felt vindicated afterwards.Those who had humiliated her when she was in High school, wereclamoring to suck-up to her, when she attended her reunion. This film included footage of Janis rehearsing and recording, with thebands that she sang with; Big Brothet & The Holding Company, The Kosmic Blues Band, and The Full-Tilt Boogie Band.  She had her ups and downs with her band members; Big Brother felt that Janis deserted them, when she decided to leave the band.Janis had a reputation for being this tough chick, who was hard-drinking, loud, foul-mouthed, and displaying a raunchy, uninhibited  sexuality. But, as the interviews with her revealed, Janis was also a sensitive and intelligent young woman. And she exuded an aching, emotional vulnerability. Beneath her veneer of bravado, Janis had the same insecurities as the rest of us.If you're a Janis Joplin fan, this film is a must-see.",5,Great film about Janis Joplin.,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1802,"['film', 'life', 'times', 'singer', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'rock', 'icon', '60s', 'not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'intense', 'singing', 'style', 'also', 'Janis', 'lived', 'life', 'own', 'terms', 'other', 'female', 'rock', 'singer', 'Janis', 'ever', 'conveyed', 'blistering', 'fierce', 'emotions', 'were', 'typical', 'stage', 'performances.The', 'film', 'shows', 'Janis', 'several', 'live', 'performances', 'course', 'career', 'Including', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'Dick', 'Cavette', 'Show', 'Woodstock', 'Montery', 'Pop', 'Festival', 'etc', 'Much', 'movie', 'also', 'several', 'interviews', 'Janis', 'frankly', 'why', 'chose', 'be', 'singer', 'relationship', 'family', 'difficulties', 'growing-up', 'ultraconservative', 'hometown', 'Port', 'Arthur', 'Texas.Janis', 'even', 'shown', 'attending', 'High', 'school', 'reunion', 'Port', 'Arthur', 'famous', 'felt', 'vindicated', 'afterwards.Those', 'who', 'had', 'humiliated', 'when', 'was', 'High', 'school', 'wereclamoring', 'suck-up', 'when', 'attended', 'reunion', 'film', 'included', 'footage', 'Janis', 'rehearsing', 'recording', 'thebands', 'sang', 'Big', 'Brothet', 'Holding', 'Company', 'Kosmic', 'Blues', 'Band', 'Full-Tilt', 'Boogie', 'Band', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'band', 'members', 'Big', 'Brother', 'felt', 'Janis', 'deserted', 'when', 'decided', 'leave', 'band.Janis', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'tough', 'chick', 'who', 'was', 'hard-drinking', 'loud', 'foul-mouthed', 'displaying', 'raunchy', 'uninhibited', 'sexuality', 'interviews', 'revealed', 'Janis', 'was', 'also', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', 'exuded', 'aching', 'emotional', 'vulnerability', 'veneer', 'bravado', 'Janis', 'had', 'same', 'insecurities', 'rest', 'us.If', ""'re"", 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'fan', 'film', 'must-see']",Janis: The Way She Was VHS
