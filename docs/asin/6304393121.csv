No other words to put it.Everyone from Brenda Blethyn to Timothy Spall to Marianna Jean Baptiste, to Claire Rushbrook, all take turns stealing scenes in performances that are so natural and on point that at times, it doesn't even feel like they're acting. This is true acting that cuts straight to the heart.The script is wonderful in that it provides so many little details that one wouldn't think to include in a movie. Just the smallest things which somehow bring the characters to life.A wonderful film that is never going to get any acclaim because this is all about the actors.No special effects or halle berry sex scenes.

Seriously people, what&#8217;s with the lack of available DVDs?Emotionally driven yet astutely reserved, &#8216;Secrets & Lies&#8217; drifts along at a pace that keeps us intently glued to the screen without unveiling too much, too soon.  This story of a black woman who traces her birth mother down to a white woman living a lie and frantically so, is one of real depth and character.  What makes the film work so well is the tremendous cast, from Oscar nominees Brenda Blethyn and Marianne Jean-Baptiste to the real lingering presence, Timothy Spall and his scene partner, Phyllis Logan.  Spall is a marvelous example of bottled up emotions, displaying just enough to keep us constantly tuned into his next move.  Blethyn is frantic and chaotic, effectively so, and there really is nothing more heartwarming than the smile across Jean-Baptiste&#8217;s face as she takes in the reality of her new family.&#8216;Secrets & Lies&#8217; has some dark elements, but Leigh directs this in such a way that it all feels so organically pure.  Even when the foreknowledge that something unspeakable has taken place or will take place or will be unveiled, there is something bittersweet (the emphasis on &#8216;sweet&#8217;) about the whole thing, which makes it feel honest and heartfelt.This is considered Leigh&#8217;s finest film, for a reason.",5,This really deserves to be more accessible than it is!,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,1673,"['Mike', 'Leigh', 'way', 'spinning', 'stories', 'disgruntled', 'families', 'way', 'so', 'effortless', 'light', 'monumental', 'weight', 'often', 'associated', '8216', 'Secrets', 'Lies', '8217', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'films', 'one', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'also', 'one', 'hardest', 'come', 'Seriously', 'people', 'what', '8217', 's', 'lack', 'available', 'DVDs', 'Emotionally', 'driven', 'yet', 'astutely', 'reserved', '8216', 'Secrets', 'Lies', '8217', 'drifts', 'pace', 'intently', 'glued', 'screen', 'unveiling', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'story', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'birth', 'down', 'white', 'woman', 'living', 'lie', 'frantically', 'so', 'one', 'real', 'depth', 'character', 'What', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'tremendous', 'cast', 'Oscar', 'nominees', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'real', 'lingering', 'presence', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'scene', 'partner', 'Phyllis', 'Logan', 'Spall', 'marvelous', 'example', 'bottled', 'up', 'emotions', 'displaying', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'constantly', 'tuned', 'next', 'move', 'Blethyn', 'frantic', 'chaotic', 'effectively', 'so', 'there', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'heartwarming', 'smile', 'Jean-Baptiste', '8217', 's', 'face', 'reality', 'new', 'family.', '8216', 'Secrets', 'Lies', '8217', 'dark', 'elements', 'Leigh', 'such', 'way', 'feels', 'so', 'organically', 'pure', 'Even', 'when', 'foreknowledge', 'something', 'unspeakable', 'taken', 'place', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'will', 'be', 'unveiled', 'something', 'bittersweet', 'emphasis', '8216', '8217', 'whole', 'thing', 'feel', 'honest', 'heartfelt.This', 'considered', 'Leigh', '8217', 'finest', 'film', 'reason']",Secrets & Lies VHS

The British writer and director has been making  ugly, challenging, and consistently winning dramas for twenty-five years,  and it's about time he gained some popular attention. Here it's Hortense  (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) who gets Leigh's star treatment. She's a black  optometrist in search of her biological mommy who, it turns out, is a  comical cockney white woman named Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn).With more  courage than I have, Hortense shares coffee with the poor, disheveled  woman. This scene is a gem of slow-burning recognition and pain, as Cynthia  realizes that the successful black woman before her is indeed her child.  The two then meet again and develop a fast friendship.Meanwhile Cyn's  chubby brother--a gentle soul named Maurice (Timothy Spall)--is busy  keeping his photography studio solvent. Too bad he can't do the same for  his family (Do these people belong on Jerry Springer, or what?).Leigh  makes the ordinary transcendent.

It is not overdrawn, overlong, or too far out of the realm of reality. The story is unusual, the script is well written, the cast is very down to earth seeming (which is something special about British films. Real people seem to populate the cast rather than out of this world beauties). Blethyn is excellent in her role as a beleaguered single mother, rather ditzy,...and not overly bright. She struggles to make ends meet and to take care of her daughter, who is also not the most pleasant person to get along with. A second storyline focuses on Blethyn&#8217;s character&#8217;s brother, Maurice, who is a photographer. He is heartbroken because he and his wife have done everything in the world to try to have children but cannot. They are the only other two people in the world, besides Blethyn, who know that Blethyn once gave birth to a child (when she was barely a teen herself) which she gave up for adoption. One day a woman named Hortense phones Blethyn and tells her that she is the daughter Blethyn once gave up for adoption. Blethyn is horrified, and this starts her emotional roller coaster and her awakening a whole host of new feelings about this daughter. They start up a relationship, but only after Blethyn is reluctantly forced to conquer the fact that this abandoned daughter is black. At first she is incredulous and refuses to believe it and says she never had sex with a black man, but she has a breakdown when she realises she did. It is not clearly spelled out for us (which is another fabulous aspect of foreign films which leave much to the viewer&#8217;s conjecture) but it is alluded to that Blethyn may have been raped by Hortense&#8217;s father. Blethyn hides the relationship with Hortense from the daughter she has reared and also from her brother and his wife, until she invites Hortense to a birthday party for her younger daughter and introduces her as a friend from work. Eventually Blethyn breaks down and cries (as she often does throughout the movie, which lends emotional credibility but is incredibly hard on the ears) and confesses that Hortense is her daughter. This creates a huge amount of turmoil but all turns out all right in the end.

Hortense, a black successful optometrist, is highly curious about the identity of her birthmother as she has been aware since childhood that she was adopted. Through an adoption agency she receives the papers that prove the identity of her birth mother, which initially seems to be erroneous, as she appears to be white. Hortense then decides to take the big step to contact her birth mother whom she has never known for over thirty years.The mother, Cynthia Rose Purley, (Brenda Blethyn) a chain smoking co-dependent anxiety ridden factory worker lives in the same council house, which her parents lived in as she nursed them to their death bed. Cynthia shares the house with her daughter, Roxanne (Claire Rushbrook), who works as a street cleaner. The relationship between Roxanne and Cynthia is strained as Cynthia is clinging onto Roxanne through questions and continuous hassle. Roxanne is also spoiled by Cynthia's younger and successful brother Maurice (Timothy Spall) and his wife, which seems to add strain between Cynthia and Roxanne.Secrets & Lies is a wonderful film that projects a family's lack of communication and difficulty in understanding one another. Mike Leigh touches the very essence of humanity as the family avoids the difficult issues through white lies and tiny secrets. The family creates several little fabrications that have been complied over several decades and when Hortense appears she functions as catalyst for the truth. It should be mentioned that the secret of Hortense is only a minor part of the all the secrets.The intimate direction of Mike Leigh creates an authentic family atmosphere that is brought to the audience as if it was the audience's own family. This generates a genuine feeling within the audience as the story unfolds. The cast performs brilliantly as they enhance the cinematic quality of the story. Brenda Blethyn performs as Cynthia with real conviction, and she received the reward for best actress for this part in Cannes in 1996.

418571,A16QODENBJVUI1,6304393121,Robert Moore,"[5, 5]","I find it impossible to recommend this movie strongly enough.  I recently saw it for the first time, and oddly enough knew next to nothing about it.  A year or so ago I saw TOPSY-TURVY with some friends, and they were raving about Mike Leigh as a filmmaker.  So, when looking through my local video store for something new and intersting to view, two names jumped out at me from the box:  Mike Leigh and Brenda Blethyn, whose performance in LITTLE VOICE had impressed me greatly.I absolutely loved TOPSY-TURVY, but I am not sure but that SECRETS AND LIES is the stronger film.  Less flashy, and I can easily imagine someone who does not enjoy dealing exclusively with interpersonal dynamics not particularly enjoying this.  But for anyone who can appreciate an intense family drama, this film will be tough to top.But the thing that most impressed me about SECRETS AND LIES is the acting.  Brenda Blethyn was even better here than she was in LITTLE VOICE.  In fact, I honestly do not know of any performance by an actor or actress anywhere that I can say is demonstrably better.  I just sat in front of my VCR agog at her performance.  I later read that she won the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Awards, and the Golden Globe Awards.  The only award she failed to win was the Oscar, for which she was nominated, but which went instead to Frances MacDormand in FARGO.  I loved FARGO and thought MacDormand did a great job, but if you watch these two performances side by side, you gain additional proof that the voters for the Oscars either do not watch all the films or see this as a sort of popularity contest.  Frances MacDormand's performance was cute and her accent was convincing, but Brenda Blethyn's performance was the emotional equivalent of a fist to the guts.  Brenda Blethyn should have swept all the acting awards that year with ease.  I honestly do not remember a performance anywhere in which so much genuine, intense, and overwhelming emotion is projected.  If you have not seen this movie, you owe it to yourself just to see Brenda Blethyn inconceivably great performance.I was also pleased to see Timothy Spall again, who did such an excellent job of playing so sympathetically Richard Temple (the actor who created the title role in THE MIKAIDO) in TOPSY-TURVY.  I have not seen him in every many roles, but after seeing him perform so well in these two very, very different roles, I very much want to see him again.",5,So many excellent reasons to see this stunning film,988934400,"05 4, 2001",2001,2472,"['find', 'impossible', 'recommend', 'movie', 'strongly', 'enough', 'recently', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'oddly', 'enough', 'knew', 'next', 'nothing', 'year', 'so', 'saw', 'TOPSY-TURVY', 'friends', 'were', 'raving', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'filmmaker', 'So', 'when', 'looking', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'something', 'new', 'intersting', 'view', 'two', 'names', 'jumped', 'out', 'box', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'performance', 'LITTLE', 'VOICE', 'had', 'impressed', 'greatly.I', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'TOPSY-TURVY', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'SECRETS', 'AND', 'LIES', 'stronger', 'film', 'Less', 'flashy', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'enjoy', 'dealing', 'exclusively', 'interpersonal', 'dynamics', 'not', 'particularly', 'enjoying', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'intense', 'family', 'drama', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'tough', 'top.But', 'thing', 'most', 'impressed', 'SECRETS', 'AND', 'LIES', 'acting', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'here', 'was', 'LITTLE', 'VOICE', 'fact', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'performance', 'actor', 'actress', 'can', 'say', 'demonstrably', 'better', 'just', 'sat', 'front', 'VCR', 'agog', 'performance', 'later', 'read', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Award', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'British', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Awards', 'only', 'award', 'failed', 'win', 'was', 'Oscar', 'was', 'nominated', 'went', 'instead', 'Frances', 'MacDormand', 'FARGO', 'loved', 'FARGO', 'thought', 'MacDormand', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'watch', 'two', 'performances', 'side', 'side', 'gain', 'additional', 'proof', 'voters', 'Oscars', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'films', 'see', 'sort', 'popularity', 'contest', 'Frances', 'MacDormand', 'performance', 'was', 'cute', 'accent', 'was', 'convincing', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'performance', 'was', 'emotional', 'equivalent', 'fist', 'guts', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'should', 'have', 'swept', 'acting', 'awards', 'year', 'ease', 'honestly', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'performance', 'anywhere', 'so', 'much', 'genuine', 'intense', 'overwhelming', 'emotion', 'projected', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'owe', 'yourself', 'just', 'see', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'inconceivably', 'great', 'performance.I', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'see', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'again', 'who', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'so', 'sympathetically', 'Richard', 'Temple', 'actor', 'who', 'created', 'title', 'role', 'THE', 'MIKAIDO', 'TOPSY-TURVY', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'roles', 'seeing', 'perform', 'so', 'well', 'two', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'roles', 'very', 'much', 'want', 'see', 'again']",Secrets & Lies VHS
418572,A2GQOI25E6UY25,6304393121,RolloTomasi,"[25, 26]","A mild-mannered, intelligent young black woman (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) tracks down her birth mother, Cynthia Purley (Brenda Blethyn), who just happens to be white. That's only the central plot thread in Mike Leigh's very poignant, very funny, very smart family drama, which received well-deserved Oscar nominations for best picture, best director, best actress, best supporting actress, and best original screenplay. A keenly observed piece set in middle-class and upper middle-class England, &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; offers such an abundance of riches it's hard to know where to begin.The plot is fairly simple, though the emotions beneath it aren't. Cynthia is initially afraid to meet the child she gave up years ago, but eventually opens up and discovers that her long-lost daughter, Hortense, is not only a sweet and refined young lady, but the possible source of the love and affection she wants so badly. She receives none of that sort of attention from her other daughter, Roxanne, a bitter, sharp-tongued council worker who, like her secret half-sister, was conceived out of wedlock. Adding to the tension is Cynthia's relationship with her brother, Maurice, and his socially ambitious wife, Monica. The latter is pained by her inability to have a child, and particularly despises Cynthia, who is able to bear children but, in Monica's mind, unable to provide them with the family environment and opportunities that she can. All of these threads converge at an afternoon birthday party, during which all the pent-up secrets and lies explode like a sequence of fireworks. Emotions are laid bare, the past is revealed, and finally, the film hints, the healing process can begin.A synopsis really doesn't do full justice to the sheer impact of this film. In fact, it's almost insulting--and irrelevant--to discuss plot at all. &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; isn't about plot in the conventional sense; it's about people. Each character is a complex, fully realized human being, brought to life by superior acting. Brenda Blethyn in particular does a spectacular job, and her Cynthia emerges as one of the most hilarious, endearing, and noble human portraits I've ever seen captured on film. Marianne Jean-Baptiste has a less showy role, but she occupies it with equally genuine warmth and humility. The other performances are consistently excellent, with Timothy Spall (Maurice) and Phyllis Long (Monica), who play tortured but thoroughly sympathetic characters, among the standouts.The actors are complimented by Leigh's superb direction. Each shot has clearly been carefully thought-out, but the camera is so unobtrusive, so casually observing, that it lends &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; an almost documentary-like feel. And yet, Leigh's compassion for all his characters leaks through every frame. One of the best scenes in the film takes place in a teashop, with Cynthia and Hortense sharing a first meeting that moves from initial awkwardness to humor and hilarity, to intense sadness and finally to catharsis and relief. The scene is an unbroken, unedited single shot lasting for nearly eight minutes, and Blethyn and Jean-Baptiste sustain the dramatic tension for that long without missing a beat. It is a seamless culmination of acting, writing, and cinematography, and represents (I think) one of the most remarkable and honest shots ever committed to celluloid.Therein lies the secret to the success of &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot;--every moment in the film feels real. That quality is aided by the fact that, as is the case in all of Leigh's other films, the screenplay is a collaboration between both writer/director and actors. The dialogue never sounds scripted or contrived because most of it has been improvised by the actors themselves; thus, it's no wonder that the characters all but leap off the screen, and that spending time with them is such an engaging and rewarding experience.Some have criticized the film's overly &quot;happy&quot; ending, claiming that it feels a bit too pat to be real. I disagree. The conclusion, though admittedly more optimistic a resolution than most conflicted families can expect, remains utterly true to the characters' personalities and backgrounds. Actually, Leigh trumps the notion that all films attempting to illuminate the human condition must be overly bleak and pessimistic.&quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; is not a fast-paced film, and at 152 minutes, it's quite long. It could have gone on for hours and hours as far as I was concerned. Mike Leigh has confirmed my long-held notion that American cinema could definitely learn a thing or two from the sure-and-steady British. Without a doubt, one of the best films, if not the best, of 1996.",5,A triumph,965088000,"08 1, 2000",2000,4718,"['mild-mannered', 'intelligent', 'young', 'black', 'woman', 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'down', 'birth', 'mother', 'Cynthia', 'Purley', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'white', 'only', 'central', 'plot', 'thread', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'very', 'poignant', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'smart', 'family', 'drama', 'received', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'director', 'best', 'actress', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'best', 'original', 'screenplay', 'keenly', 'observed', 'piece', 'set', 'middle-class', 'upper', 'middle-class', 'England', 'quot', 'Secrets', 'amp', 'Lies', 'quot', 'offers', 'abundance', 'riches', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'begin.The', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'emotions', 'are', ""n't"", 'Cynthia', 'initially', 'afraid', 'meet', 'child', 'gave', 'up', 'years', 'ago', 'eventually', 'up', 'discovers', 'long-lost', 'daughter', 'Hortense', 'not', 'only', 'sweet', 'refined', 'young', 'lady', 'possible', 'source', 'love', 'affection', 'so', 'badly', 'none', 'sort', 'attention', 'other', 'daughter', 'Roxanne', 'bitter', 'sharp-tongued', 'council', 'worker', 'who', 'secret', 'half-sister', 'was', 'conceived', 'wedlock', 'Adding', 'tension', 'Cynthia', 'relationship', 'brother', 'Maurice', 'socially', 'ambitious', 'wife', 'Monica', 'latter', 'pained', 'inability', 'have', 'child', 'particularly', 'despises', 'Cynthia', 'who', 'able', 'bear', 'children', 'Monica', 'mind', 'unable', 'provide', 'family', 'environment', 'opportunities', 'can', 'threads', 'converge', 'afternoon', 'birthday', 'party', 'pent-up', 'secrets', 'explode', 'sequence', 'fireworks', 'Emotions', 'are', 'laid', 'bare', 'past', 'revealed', 'finally', 'film', 'hints', 'healing', 'process', 'can', 'begin.A', 'synopsis', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'full', 'justice', 'sheer', 'impact', 'film', 'fact', 'almost', 'insulting', 'irrelevant', 'discuss', 'plot', 'quot', 'Secrets', 'amp', 'Lies', 'quot', ""n't"", 'about', 'plot', 'conventional', 'sense', 'people', 'character', 'complex', 'fully', 'realized', 'human', 'being', 'brought', 'life', 'superior', 'acting', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'particular', 'spectacular', 'job', 'Cynthia', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'endearing', 'noble', 'human', 'portraits', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'captured', 'film', 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'less', 'showy', 'role', 'equally', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'humility', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'consistently', 'excellent', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'Maurice', 'Phyllis', 'Long', 'Monica', 'who', 'play', 'tortured', 'thoroughly', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'standouts.The', 'actors', 'are', 'complimented', 'Leigh', 'superb', 'direction', 'shot', 'clearly', 'been', 'carefully', 'thought-out', 'camera', 'so', 'unobtrusive', 'so', 'casually', 'observing', 'quot', 'Secrets', 'amp', 'Lies', 'quot', 'almost', 'documentary-like', 'feel', 'yet', 'Leigh', 'compassion', 'characters', 'leaks', 'frame', 'One', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'place', 'teashop', 'Cynthia', 'Hortense', 'sharing', 'first', 'meeting', 'initial', 'awkwardness', 'humor', 'hilarity', 'intense', 'sadness', 'finally', 'catharsis', 'relief', 'scene', 'unbroken', 'unedited', 'single', 'shot', 'lasting', 'nearly', 'eight', 'minutes', 'Blethyn', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'sustain', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'long', 'missing', 'beat', 'seamless', 'culmination', 'acting', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'remarkable', 'honest', 'shots', 'ever', 'committed', 'celluloid.Therein', 'secret', 'success', 'quot', 'Secrets', 'amp', 'Lies', 'quot', 'moment', 'film', 'feels', 'real', 'quality', 'aided', 'fact', 'that', 'case', 'Leigh', 'other', 'films', 'screenplay', 'collaboration', 'writer/director', 'actors', 'dialogue', 'never', 'scripted', 'contrived', 'most', 'been', 'improvised', 'actors', 'thus', 'wonder', 'characters', 'leap', 'off', 'screen', 'spending', 'time', 'such', 'engaging', 'rewarding', 'experience.Some', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'overly', 'quot', 'happy', 'quot', 'ending', 'claiming', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'be', 'real', 'disagree', 'conclusion', 'though', 'admittedly', 'more', 'optimistic', 'resolution', 'most', 'conflicted', 'families', 'can', 'expect', 'utterly', 'true', 'characters', 'personalities', 'backgrounds', 'Actually', 'Leigh', 'notion', 'films', 'attempting', 'illuminate', 'human', 'condition', 'must', 'be', 'overly', 'bleak', 'pessimistic.', 'quot', 'Secrets', 'amp', 'Lies', 'quot', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'film', '152', 'minutes', 'quite', 'long', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'hours', 'hours', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'confirmed', 'long-held', 'notion', 'American', 'cinema', 'could', 'definitely', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'sure-and-steady', 'British', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'not', 'best', '1996']",Secrets & Lies VHS

Finally available on DVD to coincide with the Oscar nomination actress Imelda Staunton received for ""Vera"" (another film directed by Leigh), ""Secrets and Lies"" tells the story of a successful and well-to-do black woman Hortense Cumberbatch ( Oscar nominated Marianne Jean-Baptiste of ""Without a Trace"") who tracks down her birth mother. It seems her mother was a lower-class white woman named Monica Purley (Brenda Blethyn, Golden Globe winner and multiple Oscar nominee). Monica denies that she's Hortense's mother but gradually comes to accept and embrace her daughter despite their differences. A bittersweet comedy full of commanding performances, ""Secrets and Lies"" was a surprising box office success (hence its recognition by the Academy and the multiple nominations it deservedly earned). With rewarding performances all around and Leigh's naturalistic style, ""Secrets and Lies"" was a winner whether or not it pulled down any gold at Oscar time. Not bad for a guy who used to play in a band with Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music fame.Many of Leigh's films feature uncompromising performances and partially improvised scripts. This collaborative method makes Leigh's films both unique and memorable even when they aren't very good. Luckily, ""Secrets and Lies"" is very, very good.Sadly, this is a pretty bare bones affair. We get the original theatrical trailer and the theatrical trailers for ""Author! Author!"", ""Blood & Wine"" and ""Class Action"". It's a pity as 10 years on, it might have been interesting to catch up with the actors and the impact that their Oscar nominations had on their respective careers. There's also no commentary track but the drama speakes pretty well for itself.A terrific, bittersweet comedy ""Secrets and Lies"" details the ordinary secrets we keep to ourselves and hide from each other. Leigh's marvelous direction and the ensemble cast's terrific performances elevate this from a simple movie-of-the-week on something like the Lifetime channel. Leigh's inspired approach to improvising much of the movie's dialogue with his cast (based on his character sketches and background story) creates a drama that is much closer to neo-realism in approach than just about any other film made within the last two decades. Although Leigh's made a number of stunning films, ""Secrets and Lies"" certainly deserves its reputation as one of his finest glimpses behind the curtain of subterfuge that's a part of the ordinary people in this terrific story.",5,Classic Mike Leigh flick finally makes it to DVD,1110153600,"03 7, 2005",2005,2549,"['Dysfunction', 'better', 'function', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'Finally', 'available', 'DVD', 'coincide', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'actress', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'received', 'Vera', 'film', 'directed', 'Leigh', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'story', 'successful', 'well-to-do', 'black', 'woman', 'Hortense', 'Cumberbatch', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Marianne', 'Jean-Baptiste', 'Trace', 'who', 'down', 'birth', 'mother', 'mother', 'was', 'lower-class', 'white', 'woman', 'named', 'Monica', 'Purley', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'winner', 'multiple', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Monica', 'Hortense', 'mother', 'gradually', 'accept', 'embrace', 'daughter', 'differences', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', 'full', 'commanding', 'performances', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'was', 'surprising', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'hence', 'recognition', 'Academy', 'multiple', 'nominations', 'deservedly', 'earned', 'rewarding', 'performances', 'around', 'Leigh', 'naturalistic', 'style', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'was', 'winner', 'not', 'pulled', 'down', 'gold', 'Oscar', 'time', 'Not', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'used', 'play', 'band', 'Bryan', 'Ferry', 'Roxy', 'Music', 'fame.Many', 'Leigh', 'films', 'feature', 'uncompromising', 'performances', 'partially', 'improvised', 'scripts', 'collaborative', 'method', 'Leigh', 'films', 'unique', 'memorable', 'even', 'when', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Luckily', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'very', 'very', 'good.Sadly', 'pretty', 'bare', 'bones', 'affair', 'get', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'Author', 'Author', 'Blood', 'Wine', 'Class', 'Action', 'pity', '10', 'years', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'catch', 'up', 'actors', 'impact', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'had', 'respective', 'careers', 'also', 'commentary', 'track', 'drama', 'pretty', 'well', 'itself.A', 'terrific', 'bittersweet', 'comedy', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'details', 'ordinary', 'secrets', 'keep', 'ourselves', 'hide', 'other', 'Leigh', 'marvelous', 'direction', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'terrific', 'elevate', 'simple', 'movie-of-the-week', 'something', 'Lifetime', 'channel', 'Leigh', 'inspired', 'approach', 'improvising', 'much', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'cast', 'based', 'character', 'sketches', 'background', 'story', 'drama', 'much', 'closer', 'neo-realism', 'approach', 'just', 'other', 'film', 'made', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'Leigh', 'made', 'number', 'stunning', 'films', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'certainly', 'reputation', 'one', 'finest', 'glimpses', 'curtain', 'subterfuge', 'part', 'ordinary', 'people', 'terrific', 'story']",Secrets & Lies VHS

In Secrets and Lies, Leigh draws incredible, multi-dimensional performances out of a talented cast headed by Brenda Blethyn and Timothy Spall; quite the finest performances I have seen in a Leigh film.There is no need for lengthy analysis here. As usual, the director does not aspire to grandeur, but simply presents his characters with utter sincerity and conviction, and allowing us to travel with them on their journies. The tension culminates in a brilliantly acted climax and a touching, low-key final scene reminiscent of that of his earlier, and inferior, Life is Sweet.",5,Leigh's greatest?,1061856000,"08 26, 2003",2003,647,"['Sit', 'back', 'savour', 'genius', 'master', 'storyteller', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'Leigh', 'incredible', 'multi-dimensional', 'performances', 'talented', 'cast', 'headed', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Timothy', 'Spall', 'quite', 'finest', 'performances', 'have', 'seen', 'Leigh', 'need', 'lengthy', 'analysis', 'here', 'usual', 'director', 'not', 'aspire', 'grandeur', 'simply', 'characters', 'utter', 'sincerity', 'conviction', 'allowing', 'travel', 'journies', 'tension', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'climax', 'touching', 'low-key', 'final', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'inferior', 'Life', 'Sweet']",Secrets & Lies VHS
