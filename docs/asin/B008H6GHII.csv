1553317,A1VRVLZG5SQMDI,B008H6GHII,Alex S,"[1, 21]","I do not own the complete series set but share the surprise, and disappointment, of other reviewers regarding the quality of the packaging. I own 1,000s of DVD sets and expected that this set was comprised of individual season sets. The packing and the price indicate that strongly.The packaging looks like it includes individual sets and charging $50 for 5 seasons of a show for which individual seasons cost an average of $10 suggests that you get the individual season sets. I predict that this turkey will ultimately go for around $25.Turning to the series itself, a friend and I were just discussing how Aaron Spelling made HUGE suckers out of the American public in the mid-70s to late 80s. No one ever would have mistaken his productions for Masterpiece Theater, but I only realized while fast-forwarding through Tivoed episodes of ""Angels"" how little actual plot that show, and its companion series ""The Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island,"" had.In the case of ""Boat"" and ""Island,"" each of the three stories per episode only had roughly five minutes of actual plot. The episodes themselves were roughly 45 minutes. Ten minutes was devoted to the setup and another ten minutes went into the wrap-up and ""amusing"" scene among the crew or Roarke and Tattoo. This left approximately 20 minutes total to actually tell three very predictable stories.In the case of ""Angels,"" watching each fast-forwarded episode took no more than 20 minutes. The innocent of the week would show up and have John Forsythe brief the angels on his or her case. The angels would then establish their undercover roles, there would be minimal detection, at least 20 minutes of an unduly long chase, and five minutes of wrap-up followed by a brief segment in which the angels would make middle-aged and competent Bosley feel like an impotent doddering old man.There are much better, and comparably priced, escapist shows from that era out there. I still enjoy the equally dated ""Remington Steele,"" which at least shows some creativity in most of its chase scenes.",1,One of the Worst Shows Ever,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",2012,2036,"['do', 'not', 'own', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'share', 'surprise', 'disappointment', 'other', 'reviewers', 'regarding', 'quality', 'packaging', 'own', '1,000s', 'DVD', 'sets', 'expected', 'set', 'was', 'comprised', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'packing', 'price', 'indicate', 'strongly.The', 'packaging', 'individual', 'sets', 'charging', '50', '5', 'seasons', 'show', 'individual', 'seasons', 'cost', 'average', '10', 'get', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'predict', 'turkey', 'will', 'ultimately', 'go', 'around', '25.Turning', 'series', 'friend', 'were', 'just', 'discussing', 'how', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'made', 'HUGE', 'suckers', 'American', 'public', 'mid-70s', 'late', '80s', 'one', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'mistaken', 'productions', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'only', 'realized', 'fast-forwarding', 'Tivoed', 'episodes', 'Angels', 'how', 'little', 'actual', 'plot', 'show', 'companion', 'series', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'case', 'Boat', 'Island', 'three', 'stories', 'episode', 'only', 'had', 'roughly', 'five', 'minutes', 'actual', 'plot', 'episodes', 'were', 'roughly', '45', 'minutes', 'Ten', 'minutes', 'was', 'devoted', 'setup', 'ten', 'minutes', 'went', 'wrap-up', 'amusing', 'scene', 'crew', 'Roarke', 'Tattoo', 'left', 'approximately', '20', 'minutes', 'total', 'actually', 'tell', 'three', 'very', 'predictable', 'stories.In', 'case', 'Angels', 'watching', 'fast-forwarded', 'episode', 'took', 'more', '20', 'minutes', 'innocent', 'week', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'have', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'brief', 'angels', 'case', 'angels', 'would', 'then', 'establish', 'undercover', 'roles', 'would', 'be', 'minimal', 'detection', 'least', '20', 'minutes', 'unduly', 'long', 'chase', 'five', 'minutes', 'wrap-up', 'followed', 'brief', 'segment', 'angels', 'would', 'make', 'middle-aged', 'competent', 'Bosley', 'feel', 'impotent', 'doddering', 'old', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'comparably', 'priced', 'escapist', 'shows', 'era', 'there', 'still', 'enjoy', 'equally', 'dated', 'Remington', 'Steele', 'least', 'shows', 'creativity', 'most', 'chase', 'scenes']",Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series
1553318,A1EVD37ULFNOKU,B008H6GHII,"Andrew Frankel ""Huge movie collector""","[1, 1]","So here's the deal, I bought this set for $37. Was I surprised that the inside packaging was crappy, yes, but it was $37. The show is not streaming on Netflix, and I really wanted to watch this series. I saw a lot of episodes growing up, but never in the right order because it was already syndicated by then and this was before VCR+ was around. Fun show, typical of the late 70's and early 80's. They tried to remake it and I prefer the original series. The complaints about this have mainly been packaging, and maybe back in 2010 when this was released it would irritate the people who bought 1-4 prior and could not get 5 without waiting, but if you are like me who doesn't/didn't own any of the seasons individually, this is a great way to get them. I put all my DVD boxes in storage and catalog all my discs in sleeves anyways, so the packaging to me is not important.

1553322,A281387UUS2IN5,B008H6GHII,Beantown Jim,"[0, 0]","I am wondering why so many comments about the packaging of the product.  Like many people, the packaging is discarded by me as packaging from the factory takes up way too much storage space.  This is not the Gutenberg Bible, people.Charlie's Angels featured the most beautiful women ever to be seen on broadcast TV, from Jaclyn Smith to Farrah Fawcett, with the superhot Cheryl Ladd and Tanya Roberts as added attractions.All of the shows had just enough plot, just enough humor, and just enough drama to carry your attention thru an hour long program.  The Angels were not only beautiful but endearing, at least a little bit.  Unlike beauties like Bo Derek and Pamela Anderson, Jacky Smith and Farrah seemed to be genuinely nice and human.The show parallelled Mission Impossible insofar as there was a leader on tape or phone, not appearing, using a collection of actors[i.e. the 'Angels'] to examine a problem and solve it using their leader's directions, but with a bit of their own improvisation.One final word: if you never saw the TV series, you might be surprised that it was so, umm, modest.  Even for TV standards, the series now could be rated PG, even G.

I already have $80.00 invested in the series with seasons 1-4. And additional $45.00 is just too much to ask for one season. That's $120.00 all together with little to no chance to recoup any of it. Yes, I can attempt, and I do mean attempt (everyone else will be trying to do the same thing and getting even $5.00 out of each set will be difficult), to resell my duplicate seasons, but let's remember that Sony is the worst at complete series packaging. The discs will all probably be on some kind of plastic hub with no protection in between the discs. Scratched discs are a definate possibility. Flimsy cardboard outer casing. The whole thing will be an absolute nightmare. Until season 5 is released as a stand alone, Sony isn't getting another dime from me for Charlies Angels. I already have the seasons that I most wanted anyway. The final season is the pits. Bad packaging, bad season, double dipping on seasons 1-4, where is the logic in buying this again? None that I can see. Definate pass on this.Note: it has been revealed that this set will be on a plastic spindle hub like the complete Soap, Good Times and other such sets from Sony. WAY cheap. Yeah, again no sale Sony.Further Note: It has been stated by Sony on tvshowsondvd.com that there will be a later release of Season 5 by itself.

Well I got it for a birthday present but some of the reviews are right about the packaging one side came unglued from the back cover, my sister got it and i glad,i wont be buying the season 5 it would be useless due to the way they put it together ,you can go online and get every season episodes so that way you know what each season is about.so now i done with my complete charlie's angels,all 5 seasons,the 2 movies and the reboot of charlie's angels.  I will not buy season 5, I suggest that you buy this set and forget the season 5 by itself there is not guide to it like there isn't on this but however your not getting dvd-r,you are at least getting discs that shows their faces like the other season,  the charlies angels sites shows that they are just plain white discs with no pictures of them and no episode guide either.  so I am now done, I printed out the episode guide of all 5 seasons off the internet so i wont worry about season 5 stand alone dvd set.",5,charlie's angels season 5,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2214,"['i', 'rest', 'feel', 'crazy', 'have', 'buy', 'season', '1,2,3,4', 'now', 'having', 'rebuy', '4', 'seasons', 'again', 'however', 'i', 'kinda', 'figure', 'only', 'way', 'i', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'season', '5', 'i', 'brought', 'season', '5', 'back', 'march', 'year', 'i', 'offer', 'however', 'person', 'never', 'sent', 'i', 'do', 'have', 'season', 'dvr', 'itunes', 'i', 'wanted', 'out', 'dvd', 'i', 'can', 'finish', 'angels', 'yes', 'i', 'did', 'buy', 'reboot', 'well', 'never', 'be', 'original', '6', 'angels', 'i', 'have', '2', 'movies', 'i', 'been', 'angel', 'fan', 'years', 'now', 'will', 'have', 'been', '3', 'yrs', '2', 'months', 'season', '4', 'came', 'out', 'dvd', 'price', 'buy', 'very', 'cheap', 'just', 'shame', 'have', 'have', '2', 'season', 'one', 'season', '5', 'maybe', 'then', 'may', 'put', 'season', '5', 'stand', 'alone', 'season', 'who', 'packaging', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'other', 'series', 'heard', 'i', 'dream', 'jeannie', 'wild', 'wild', 'west', 'case', 'then', 'put', 'season', '5', 'different', 'package', 'i', 'can', 'have', 'i', 'also', 'have', 'season', 'one', 'again', 'charlie', 'angels', 'lunch', 'box', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'open', 'hey', 'way', 'least', 'i', 'can', 'say', 'i', 'will', 'finally', 'have', 'angels', 'old', 'new', 'be', 'finally', 'done', 'Well', 'got', 'birthday', 'present', 'reviews', 'are', 'right', 'packaging', 'one', 'side', 'came', 'unglued', 'back', 'cover', 'sister', 'got', 'i', 'glad', 'i', 'wont', 'be', 'buying', 'season', '5', 'would', 'be', 'useless', 'due', 'way', 'put', 'together', 'can', 'go', 'online', 'get', 'season', 'so', 'way', 'know', 'what', 'season', 'about.so', 'now', 'done', 'complete', 'charlie', 'angels', '5', 'seasons', '2', 'movies', 'reboot', 'charlie', 'angels', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'season', '5', 'suggest', 'buy', 'set', 'forget', 'season', '5', 'not', 'guide', ""n't"", 'however', 'not', 'getting', 'dvd-r', 'are', 'least', 'getting', 'discs', 'other', 'season', 'charlies', 'angels', 'sites', 'shows', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'white', 'discs', 'pictures', 'episode', 'guide', 'either', 'so', 'am', 'now', 'done', 'printed', 'out', 'episode', 'guide', '5', 'seasons', 'internet', 'so', 'i', 'wont', 'worry', 'season', '5', 'stand', 'alone', 'dvd', 'set']",Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series

1553336,A2T1VQFDNXGMAU,B008H6GHII,"D. Hill ""dhill757""","[0, 0]","Everything other reviewers have said about this box set's packaging is the truth: there are two spindles that hold all of the discs in place, ""locked"" by two cardboard fixtures that you place over the spindles. Having said that, this arrangement is much better than the Marilyn Monroe box set, where the dics are forever slipping and sliding out of their cardboard envelopes, and so, arriving scratched. I bought both at the same time. The Marilyn set has several scratched discs that won't play, freeze up, etc. Charlie's Angels had one out of the 27 which was defective and I get the idea it was due to the pressing, not the packaging. Also, not one of the discs was scratched. If you can get this for thirty dollars or less, it is well worth the money and will not disappoint.Now onto the product itself, since most people are just reviewing the packaging. This is actually the first time I have seen the complete series, what a blast! Farrah was a phenomenom at the time, and it would have been nice to have seen her stay at least another season. It was news to me that she did another six episodes after season one, because I only caught the show occasionally in the 70s. She was also so athletic, too, I had totally forgotten the famous skateboard sequence. Cheryl Ladd was a great replacement in season two, interesting the episodes where she and Farrah are together as 'sisters.' And Jaclyn Smith? A classic beauty. The one miscast to me was Kate Jackson. She was awesome when she first started out on Dark Shadows and in the Rookies, by Charlie's Angels, she had lost some of her appeal and her mind looks like it is elsewhere, evidently it was as she left after season three. Which brings me to Shelly Hack, how gorgeous she was! Personally, I would have kept her on as she made a nice compliment to Jaclyn Smith and put one of the two of them in the 'leader' role. The studio, of course, lost faith in her and replaced her with Tania Roberts, who was interesting, too, but had even less chemistry with the others.I was also surprised at all the guest stars in the show when they were either at the end of their careers or just staring out: Robert Englund, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kim Basinger (in the Angels in Chains episode, no less), Stephen Collins, Timothy Dalton, Kim Cattral (who was very hot when she was young), just to name a few. Everybody who was going to be anybody ended up in Charlie's Angels at one time or another, it seems. In a behind the scenes featurette, the show's producers admit that they had a hard time reinventing the show over time. Isn't that the truth, by season five they were repeating all the same storylines they were doing in season one (Jaclyn Smith, for instance, gets shot three times, even in the series finale), and Farrah gets kidnapped and taken cross country in a truck while later the same thing happens to Cheryl Ladd. The show has its flaws, but still, what a terrific trip down memory lane seeing all five seasons at once was! Highly recommended, if you can get past the spindles!",5,"Charlie's Angels, the Complete Series",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,3033,"['Everything', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'box', 'set', 'packaging', 'truth', 'are', 'two', 'spindles', 'hold', 'discs', 'place', 'locked', 'two', 'cardboard', 'fixtures', 'place', 'spindles', 'Having', 'said', 'arrangement', 'much', 'better', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'box', 'set', 'where', 'dics', 'are', 'forever', 'slipping', 'sliding', 'cardboard', 'envelopes', 'so', 'arriving', 'scratched', 'bought', 'same', 'time', 'Marilyn', 'set', 'several', 'scratched', 'discs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'freeze', 'up', 'etc', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'had', 'one', '27', 'was', 'defective', 'get', 'idea', 'was', 'due', 'pressing', 'not', 'packaging', 'Also', 'not', 'one', 'discs', 'was', 'scratched', 'can', 'get', 'thirty', 'dollars', 'less', 'well', 'money', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint.Now', 'product', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'just', 'reviewing', 'packaging', 'actually', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'complete', 'series', 'what', 'blast', 'Farrah', 'was', 'phenomenom', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'seen', 'stay', 'least', 'season', 'was', 'news', 'did', 'six', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'only', 'caught', 'show', 'occasionally', '70s', 'was', 'also', 'so', 'athletic', 'too', 'had', 'totally', 'forgotten', 'famous', 'skateboard', 'sequence', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'was', 'great', 'replacement', 'season', 'two', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'where', 'Farrah', 'are', 'together', ""'sisters"", 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'A', 'classic', 'beauty', 'one', 'miscast', 'was', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'was', 'awesome', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'out', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Rookies', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'had', 'lost', 'appeal', 'mind', 'elsewhere', 'evidently', 'was', 'left', 'season', 'three', 'Shelly', 'Hack', 'how', 'gorgeous', 'was', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'made', 'nice', 'compliment', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'put', 'one', 'two', ""'leader"", 'role', 'studio', 'course', 'lost', 'faith', 'replaced', 'Tania', 'Roberts', 'who', 'was', 'interesting', 'too', 'had', 'even', 'less', 'chemistry', 'others.I', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'guest', 'stars', 'show', 'when', 'were', 'either', 'end', 'careers', 'just', 'staring', 'out', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Angels', 'Chains', 'episode', 'less', 'Stephen', 'Collins', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Kim', 'Cattral', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'hot', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'Everybody', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'anybody', 'ended', 'up', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'one', 'time', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'show', 'producers', 'admit', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'reinventing', 'show', 'time', ""n't"", 'truth', 'season', 'five', 'were', 'repeating', 'same', 'storylines', 'were', 'doing', 'season', 'one', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'instance', 'shot', 'three', 'times', 'even', 'series', 'finale', 'Farrah', 'kidnapped', 'taken', 'cross', 'country', 'truck', 'later', 'same', 'thing', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'show', 'flaws', 'still', 'what', 'terrific', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'seeing', 'five', 'seasons', 'once', 'was', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'can', 'get', 'spindles']",Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series

1553340,AEDHD7LIGEKB2,B008H6GHII,Fan Boy 15,"[6, 7]","Though I would've preferred a metal tin (see Justice League Complete Series)for the outer box, a decent enough cardboard material is used. The lone Amazon pic shows the first two of the four different sets of Angels on the left side of the outer box (in all their Silver Convention glory). The right side pleasantly shows the latter two sets of angels. Each of the four inside flaps are dedicated to one of the four sets of Angels, fully covered with photos from that phase. Most of which are from the indidivual season sets. A few new pictures along with each Angel's name appears on the flaps that cover each spindle. Which brings me to the main issue ... the two spindles which hold both stacks of discs. Though not as bad I first thought, a series so great as this deserves the five-star treatment and not some budget packaging. The discs seem somewhat secure in the cheap plastic holders but the inevitability of scratching will probably occur after the first removal. Which causes me to rethink ditching my individual season sets. Because even though I loathe thin cases, they're still better than spindles. There's also no booklet, just an episode list/insert inside the box. The discs of Seasons 1-4 all seem identical to the ones from the indidivual sets, with no added special features or remastering. Also, no special mention of Season Five's debut on dvd and the artwork on those discs are basically the photo from the box (which also appears on Amazon's CA : Season Five homemade item page). Cosmetically speaking, this box rocks but because of the disc housing inside and lack of booklet, the set gets a low rating. Word to the wise, wait for the individual Season Five. A better package would've consisted of the same outer box housing 5 individual 14mm cases (which hold 5-6 disc) and a booklet/episode guide along with whatever exclusive goodie I'm sure Sony could've throne in. See Riptide or Jem Complete Series for examples.Season Five breakdown*No Special Features or Previews*No Special Options (subtitles, closed captioning or anything else)*Lackluster Menu : no big Charlie's Angels: Season ... logo on the menu screen like the other sets have, just the small black Angels silohette with the disc number. Disc 1: has a Kelly pic while the remaining three discs show all three Angels. The design is slightly more modern than the menus of Seasons 1-4, but very generic at best.

However, the plastic spindles are very cheap and there are cardboard inserts to keep the stacked discs in place. The set looks very nice until you open it up and see how the discs are stacked. **NOTE** See the photos I posted of this in the IMAGES Section of this product.There are no new bonus features included which is a shame, only the ""Angels Forever"" featurette that originally appeared on the Season 1 set that came out way back in 2003. Still, this was a must-have for me, having waited FOREVER for Season 5 on DVD. Now I wish I would have waited though for the stand-alone release that is rumoured to be coming out later. I will probably buy that and sell this set.We kick off the final season with a two-parter that forgoes the exotic location shooting of season-openers past and brings us instead a standard case of murder and corruption within the modeling industry, introducing us to scrappy, tough-talking final Angel Julie Rogers (the stunning, statuesque Tanya Roberts).Due to an actors' strike in 1980, the fifth season was truncated and only 16 episodes produced. The team spirit that was missing from Season 4 is re-established here even if the scripts are hit-and-miss. Some of the series' worst episodes show up in Season 5--from the boring ""Mr. Galaxy"" and ""He Married an Angel"" to the cringe-worthy ""Moonshinin' Angels"" and ""Chorus Line Angels"".Some of the best episodes of Season 5 include ""Angel on the Line"" which features Kelly squaring off against a deranged transvestite in the one of the series' (unintentionally) funniest scenes; ""Hula Angels"" has a terrific turn from guest villainess Joanna Cassidy; while ""Island Angels"" boasts a guest-star roster including Carol Lynley, Lyle Waggoner, Randolph Mantooth, Barbi Benton and more.The outer box is sturdy and looks great and the inner case has great photos of ALL the Angels, but the stacked discs on cheap spindle make this a lousy set.",1,Better Off Waiting for Season 5 On Its Own,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,2040,"['better', 'packaging', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'release', 'price', 'even', 'having', 'double-dip', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'However', 'plastic', 'spindles', 'are', 'very', 'cheap', 'are', 'cardboard', 'inserts', 'keep', 'stacked', 'discs', 'place', 'set', 'very', 'nice', 'open', 'up', 'see', 'how', 'discs', 'are', 'stacked', 'See', 'photos', 'posted', 'IMAGES', 'Section', 'are', 'new', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'shame', 'only', 'Angels', 'Forever', 'featurette', 'originally', 'appeared', 'Season', '1', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'way', 'back', '2003', 'Still', 'was', 'must-have', 'having', 'waited', 'FOREVER', 'Season', '5', 'DVD', 'Now', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'waited', 'stand-alone', 'release', 'rumoured', 'be', 'coming', 'out', 'later', 'will', 'probably', 'buy', 'sell', 'set.We', 'kick', 'off', 'final', 'season', 'two-parter', 'exotic', 'location', 'shooting', 'season-openers', 'past', 'instead', 'standard', 'case', 'murder', 'corruption', 'modeling', 'industry', 'introducing', 'scrappy', 'tough-talking', 'final', 'Angel', 'Julie', 'Rogers', 'stunning', 'statuesque', 'Tanya', 'Roberts', '.Due', 'actors', 'strike', '1980', 'fifth', 'season', 'was', 'truncated', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'produced', 'team', 'spirit', 'was', 'missing', 'Season', '4', 're-established', 'here', 'even', 'scripts', 'are', 'hit-and-miss', 'series', 'worst', 'episodes', 'show', 'up', 'Season', '5', 'boring', 'Mr.', 'Galaxy', 'Married', 'Angel', 'cringe-worthy', 'Moonshinin', 'Angels', 'Chorus', 'Line', 'Angels', '.Some', 'best', 'episodes', 'Season', '5', 'include', 'Angel', 'Line', 'Kelly', 'squaring', 'off', 'deranged', 'transvestite', 'one', 'series', 'unintentionally', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'Hula', 'Angels', 'terrific', 'turn', 'guest', 'villainess', 'Joanna', 'Cassidy', 'Island', 'Angels', 'guest-star', 'roster', 'including', 'Carol', 'Lynley', 'Lyle', 'Waggoner', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'Barbi', 'Benton', 'more.The', 'outer', 'box', 'sturdy', 'great', 'inner', 'case', 'great', 'photos', 'Angels', 'stacked', 'discs', 'cheap', 'spindle', 'make', 'lousy', 'set']",Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series

It came in a glorious box that spelled out ""I am a glamorousseries that ended up having six very sexy and talented actresses in my history"". Iwas very excited to open the box, but when I did, I was shot down so fast my handsshook, my nerves were shot to pieces, and I said to myself ""My God, the boxsetfrom hell"". It was like opening your favourite box of candy and finding one'snightmare inside, but nightmares only last until your nerves carm down.The dvds are piled on top of each other with no protection what-so-ever, with a bitof crappy cardboard and flimsy plastic to hold them in place. I dread the thoughtof what will happen if the cardboard or plastic becomes useless. I made a pact withthe Devil and swore that I will sit down and watch all the discs to see if theywork, as my nerves will not be the same until I do.While you are watching the series (all 91 1/2 hours) the discs have to be left outor pulled out again and again to see the next disc, which is a nightmare. I keptthem in sleeves off book cover discs while I watched them. There are 11 discs ofseasons 1-2 on one side and 16 discs of seasons 3-5 on the other side.The show was exciting for the 1970s as three women working for a mysterious man(Charlie) as private eyes. The Police Academies where Charlie found them would notmiss them, as they were not suited for the dangerous jobs they had to do, so theyopted for the less dangerous job as private investigators.The only issue I have with this series was with the Angels wanting to see Charlie.In one episode Charlie was kidnapped, so, if the Angels wanted to find out aboutwho Charlie was, a private eye worth half his or her salt would have no troublefinding out.It was good to see the Angels again, but this series was no different from a dozenother private eye shows, but the Angels made it easier to digest, and it was worthwatching.It would be impossible to review each episode or each disc, but I enjoyed the seriesagain, even though I had been on a time consuming mission of my own this time. Theepisodes are flawless with no negatives about the dvds, everything was as it shouldbe.Aaron Spelling was a MEGA producer who had produced many successful TV shows, whichthis series was but one of them. The Angels were cast perfectly for the show, soFarrah Fawcett-Majors, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson were superstars overnight. Thismade it even harder for Cheryl Ladd, Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts, who followedin the series.If one can get pass the opening of this box, then I would recommend it to anyone,but it will take a few basic steps to protect the discs while watching them. Irecommend you do what I did, keep them in single sleeves or cases until you arefinished one side of the box. Be careful with the packaging as it will not take anyrough treatment.I would love to give this boxset 5 stars, but it will only get 3 instead. If thestorage went into as much thought as the box itself, it would have been 100%(perfect), but alas it wasn't. So it is at the detriment of the series that theychose the cheapest way out, and have such a stigma associated with such a beautifulboxset. It is by far the worst packaging I have seen so far.

And they became the sexiest, most eye-popping crime-stopping private eyes to ever grace TV.On September 22, 1976, ""Charlies Angels"" premiered, making Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith overnight superstars. The series continued for five unforgettable seasons and included four different sets of Angels. When Fawcett left after the first season (she returned in the third and fourth seasons as a guest star in six episodes), she was replaced by cheryl Ladd, who played her little sister. The fourth season introduced new Angel Shelly Hack, who replaced Jackson, and in the fifth season, we meet the final Angel, Tanya Roberts, who replaced Hack. The series co-starred David Doyle as John Bosley and was produced by TV legends Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg.""Charlies Angels"" The Complete Series contains all the glamour, guns, hair, bikinis, high-kicking action and dangerous intrigue packaged into 117 episodes, include the original pilot, plus the ""Angels Forever"" featurette!A week ago, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment announced their September 25th plans to release Charlie's Angels - The Complete Series as a 27-DVD set, with all five seasons of the original 1976 show. Now we've gotten front and rear box art for this gift package, which is currently the only way to get the show's fifth season.

For some reason the entry at Amazon has been renamed from ""The Complete Series"" to a breakdown that this set contains ""Season 1, Season 2, etc...""; the complete series set of Rescue Me (which Sony releases the same day) has also been listed at Amazon this way for a week now. We don't consider this to be anything to worry about; it's just some titling nuttiness that will probably be resolved before you know it.The other question we've been getting concerns how this Complete Series package is the only way to get the show's final season. We asked Sony about a separate Season 5 set, and they tell us it will come later on. So if you already own the first four seasons on DVD, then it would make sense to wait. We'll alert you when that individual S5 title is coming, so stay tuned!Taken from: [...]",5,All Calm down!!,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,2917,"['got', '[', ']', 'complete', 'series', 'yes', 'season', '5', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'seperately', 'See', 'belowCharlie', 'Angels', 'Front/Rear', 'Box', 'Art', ""'The"", 'Complete', 'Series', 'Word', 'Separate', ""5'September"", '25th', 'release', 'entire', 'show', 'run', 'time', 'holidays', 'then', 'separate', 'S5', 'set', 'down', 'roadPosted', 'David', 'Lambert7/30/2012Once', 'time', 'were', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'went', 'work', 'Charles', 'Townsend', 'mysterious', 'man', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'detective', 'agency', 'became', 'sexiest', 'most', 'eye-popping', 'crime-stopping', 'private', 'eyes', 'ever', 'grace', 'TV.On', 'September', '22', '1976', 'Charlies', 'Angels', 'premiered', 'making', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'overnight', 'superstars', 'series', 'continued', 'five', 'unforgettable', 'seasons', 'included', 'four', 'different', 'sets', 'Angels', 'When', 'Fawcett', 'left', 'first', 'season', 'returned', 'third', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'guest', 'star', 'six', 'episodes', 'was', 'replaced', 'cheryl', 'Ladd', 'who', 'played', 'little', 'sister', 'fourth', 'season', 'introduced', 'new', 'Angel', 'Shelly', 'Hack', 'who', 'replaced', 'Jackson', 'fifth', 'season', 'meet', 'final', 'Angel', 'Tanya', 'Roberts', 'who', 'replaced', 'Hack', 'series', 'co-starred', 'David', 'Doyle', 'John', 'Bosley', 'was', 'produced', 'TV', 'legends', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'Leonard', 'Goldberg', 'Charlies', 'Angels', 'Complete', 'Series', 'glamour', 'guns', 'hair', 'bikinis', 'high-kicking', 'action', 'dangerous', 'intrigue', 'packaged', '117', 'episodes', 'include', 'original', 'pilot', 'Angels', 'Forever', 'featurette', 'week', 'ago', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'announced', 'September', '25th', 'plans', 'release', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Complete', 'Series', '27-DVD', 'set', 'five', 'seasons', 'original', '1976', 'show', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'front', 'rear', 'box', 'art', 'gift', 'package', 'currently', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'show', 'fifth', 'season', 'only', 'bonus', 'material', 'title', 'will', 'be', 'Angels', 'Forever', 'featurette', 'mentioned', 'studio', 'description', 'was', 'made', '2003', 'DVD', 'release', 'first', 'season.You', ""'ll"", 'see', 'package', 'art', 'sides', 'shown', 'pre-order', 'button', 'link', 'Amazon', 'reason', 'entry', 'Amazon', 'been', 'renamed', 'Complete', 'Series', 'breakdown', 'set', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '2', 'etc', 'complete', 'series', 'set', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'Sony', 'same', 'day', 'also', 'been', 'listed', 'Amazon', 'way', 'week', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'anything', 'worry', 'just', 'titling', 'nuttiness', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'resolved', 'know', 'it.The', 'other', 'question', ""'ve"", 'been', 'getting', 'concerns', 'how', 'Complete', 'Series', 'package', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'show', 'final', 'season', 'asked', 'Sony', 'separate', 'Season', '5', 'set', 'tell', 'will', 'come', 'later', 'So', 'already', 'own', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'then', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'wait', ""'ll"", 'alert', 'when', 'individual', 'S5', 'title', 'coming', 'so', 'stay', 'tuned', 'Taken', '[', ']']",Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series

After making fans wait years for season 5, Sony gave us the option of getting it on DVD-R DVDs with no art work, or getting the complete series, which ironically is cheaper than season 5.  Unfortunately, the complete series must have required Sony to invest at least $1.49 (in total) on the packaging and art work!You get two 5 cent plastic cases that hold the season 1-4 previously released DVDs, with no additional art work or even a simple episode description, and 4 season 5 DVDs held down at the bottom under a 1 cent cardboard cut out.  FYI - lose or destroy that cardboard cutout and your DVDs will be in a free fall.  Of course, nothing keeps the DVDs from scratching as they are just piled up in the two spindles.I am confident Sony will make millions of dollars on this set because the fans of this show will buy it.  I did.  I would just like to appeal to the investors and ask you if you don't see this the same way I do - - this is the most compelling argument for bootleg DVDs I can imagine.

Anyway, I won't comment on the series as I have in other reviews on individual seasons. But I agree with the other reviews in that the package was a little disappointing. There are these cheap flimsy trays that two seasons of DVDs stack on top of each other as you force them down over a pole in the center of the tray. The pole fits through the center hole of the DVD. The problem is the DVDs scrap against the cheap plastic like fingernails over a chalkboard. And you feel like you are going to break the DVDs as you have to continuously force them off and on the pole tray. The tray itself appears as if it cannot support the weight of the DVD stack and might easily tear leaving you with loose DVDs to worry about. The sturdy cardboard encasing for the DVD trays is first rate. Good design. But the trays just sit there  inside loosely. They are not attached to the envelope.

Debuting in the fall of 1976 the police drama quickly became a Top 10 show, made stars out of its three leads (Kate Jackson, Farrah-Fawcett-Majors and Jaclyn Smith) and put ABC on the map as the #1 network.Even when Farrah and Kate Jackson left the series the show still had a very loyal audience who followed the angles/police detectives week after week for five seasons ending, sadly in 1981.It was actually Kate Jackson who was responsible for the title of the show. Originally named ""The Alley Cats"", Jackson suggested to the producers that it didn't sound right and that having ""angels"" in the title sounded more promising. It was also Kate who came up with the idea of having Charlie not be seen by the anglels or the audience to give the show a kind of mystery. These ploys worked and thus ""Charlie's Angels"" was born.Finally, fans can enjoy all five seasons worth of shows (110 episodes) in one complete package at a very good price. I know many have complained that they already have the first four seasons and have to spend extra cash just to get season five, but there is still a possiblity the studio may release season 5 as a solo set.I am just ecstatic that ""Charlie's Angels"" will live on in posterity in wonderful DVD format!",5,"""Once Upon A Time There Were Three Little Girls Who Went To The Police Academy...""",1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,1375,"['Charlie', 'Angels', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'well', 'remembered', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'series', 'network', 'television', 'United', 'States', 'Debuting', 'fall', '1976', 'police', 'drama', 'quickly', 'became', 'Top', '10', 'show', 'made', 'stars', 'three', 'leads', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'Farrah-Fawcett-Majors', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'put', 'ABC', 'map', '1', 'network.Even', 'when', 'Farrah', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'left', 'series', 'show', 'still', 'had', 'very', 'loyal', 'audience', 'who', 'followed', 'angles/police', 'detectives', 'week', 'week', 'five', 'seasons', 'ending', 'sadly', '1981.It', 'was', 'actually', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'title', 'show', 'Originally', 'named', 'Alley', 'Cats', 'Jackson', 'suggested', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', 'having', 'angels', 'title', 'sounded', 'more', 'promising', 'was', 'also', 'Kate', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'having', 'Charlie', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'anglels', 'audience', 'give', 'show', 'kind', 'mystery', 'ploys', 'worked', 'thus', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'was', 'born.Finally', 'fans', 'can', 'enjoy', 'five', 'seasons', 'worth', 'shows', '110', 'episodes', 'one', 'complete', 'package', 'very', 'good', 'price', 'know', 'many', 'have', 'complained', 'already', 'have', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'have', 'spend', 'extra', 'cash', 'just', 'get', 'season', 'five', 'still', 'possiblity', 'studio', 'may', 'release', 'season', '5', 'solo', 'set.I', 'am', 'just', 'ecstatic', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'will', 'live', 'posterity', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'format']",Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series

Since 2010, I've ordered seasons one through four separately from Amazon. I absolutely loved the seasons. The packaging could've been better, though. But the point is: I searched for like two years for season five's DVD release. I kept thinking: ""What's the hold up? Sells for the first four years were pretty good and this show has a loyal following and several petitions to release season five.""FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS SETOne day I went searching for ""upcoming Charlie's Angels DVD releases"" and I found Amazon's page showcasing that Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series was available for pre-order. I was so mad. I thought that Sony had just lost their minds. I looked into the package, though. At first, I saw no clues for a separate season five DVD release. I was eager to see to complete series, though.BUYING THE BOX SETSo, not at Amazon, but at my local Wal-Mart, I bought the complete series... just for season five. It was like $37 total. Not too bad, I guess. But yet it was, figuring I already had seasons one through four and because I was just buying the set to get sixteen episodes on what was reported to be just four DVDs.OFFICIAL REVIEW FOR THE SETWhen I got home and opened the box I saw the real problem was just to come. The outside of the box is very glossy and has the Charlie's Angels logo with ""Charlie's Angels the complete series. All 5 seasons and 27 discs"" typed on the outer layer. Turning to the left side I saw cast photos of the first three seasons, and on the right, for seasons four and five. The main box set slides out of the outer box and you see several tiny pictures that are something our snap shots. You flip it over, the same style of, but different, pictures are there. Most of these pictures were from seasons one through three. When I opened it up, I saw similar pictures, but these pictures were all from seasons four and five. I finally started thinking: ""Where on Earth are the DVDs?"" You open the binding yet again and see more pictures on the far left and far right. It has a profile shot of each Angel, with their Angel, not real, name listed below it. Dead in the center there is a quote box that says ""Good Morning, Angels..."" I must say I was pleased with the artwork and quality of the pictures, but was disturbed because of the cardboard packaging. Then I saw the long waited DVDs. They are stacked in two black prongs. On the left side you have seasons one and two and on the right you have seasons three to five. There is no protection for the DVDs. They are just stacked on top of each other. To keep the DVDs in place there is a stiff cardboard over the DVDs. I was so angered by this. Fans have waited nine years and this is what we are awarded with? There are absolutely nothing new about the DVDs, no new special features.

The discs are stacked on top of each other in a big flimsy container. I removed them and stored them in individual paper sleeves. The outer box has lots of nice photos of all the Angels. I previously had bought each individual season (1-4) of the show but I wanted season 5 so badly that I sold them on Ebay and put the money towards this ""complete"" set. However, I noticed several episodes are edited down from their original broadcast versions. The set features the EXACT same DVDs that the previous seasons 1-4 sets contained, so there are no new bonus features unfortunately. I was hoping for some new featurettes, commentaries or retrospective documentaries, but sadly no. If you can find this set for less than $40, it's still a good bargain, especially considering how ridiculously overpriced Season 5 is currently by itself.

1553381,AH91ZJ8W8NCLR,B008H6GHII,Yes Fan,"[2, 2]","After reading all the negative reviews here, I was hesitant to purchase Charlie's Angels The Complete Series.  I am glad I did, too.  I found the box set to be complete and exactly what I wanted.  Yes, the DVDs were on 2 separate spindle, secured in place with a cardboard top, yet they were stacked neatly and in order of the season, so it was a breeze to transfer them in order into my DVD case.  There is also a nice reference card noting the season, the disc, and the episode (which fits nicely in the DVD case for reference).  The foldable double box inside the outer box folds apart with a montage of scenes from Charlie's Angels on the inside.  For this price, I found this to be an EXCELLENT deal.  If you want a detailed description of each episode, you can always go online and look it up.  There are several websites that cater specifically to big Charlie's Angels fans.  This compilation is great.  As long as I have the season, disc, and episode title, I am happy.  So, disregard all these negative reviews-they were submitted obviously by people who are just way too picky and are misers looking for the best at a reduced price.  If you are a Charlie's Angels fan, GET THIS!  Do like I did and transfer all the discs to a DVD case where you have ease of access, as well as access to the included index of season/disc/episode.  I give it 5 stars for the prismatic/holographic paper that lines the inside of the case alone!  This would make the PERFECT gift for ANY Charlie's Angels fan.
