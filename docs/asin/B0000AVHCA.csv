768361,A33L7G4E8CID3,B0000AVHCA,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[98, 102]","The first Law and Order Spinoff series, Law and Order: SVU is an often stark and depressing look into the most destructive crimes being committed today. This series offers an uncompromising look into the minds of some truly disturbing sex offenders and reminds us about what happens every day that we'd rather just ignore. Occasionally lurid and often brilliant, this show combines Law and Order's entertaining, 'ripped-from-the-headlines' storytelling while reminding its audience about what is casually glossed over in the news every night.Although the original Law and Order was very much a story-driven show, this incarnation focused much more on the lives of the detectives on the Special Victims Unit. Christopher Meloni plays Detective Stabler, a family man who is very dedicated to his work. The fact that he has a wife and daughters makes him a very interesting character and adds to his movivation to get the job done, to get the bad guys off the street, so that it won't be his daughters being abused next. His partner, Detective Bensen, is played by Mariska Hargitay. She is in the work for different reasons. The fact that she herself was the product of a rape makes her also a very interesting character, as her motivations for being in the unit are very complicated. Richard Belser reprises his role from 'Homicide' as Detective John Munch, and he brings a lot of black humor to the show. It's just fun to watch him work, and Belser is a terriffic actor. His partner in the first year was Michelle Hurd, although she would later be supplanted by Ice-T. Hurd played a slightly off-kilter policewoman who wasn't quite prepared for the rigors of the job and was forced off the squad at year's end. Rounding out the cast was Dann Florek, reprising his role as Captain Cragen from the original Law and Order. I loved him in that series, and he is great here, too, walking the line between being tough and supportive with his detectives.Although more emphasis was placed on the characters, this was still Law and Order, and that meant that the stories would have to be pretty darn good. And they were. The first season dealt with a plethora of sex abuses including rape, incest, child abuse, statutory rape, and more. Subsequent seasons would have a greater variety of story devices, but the first season was definitely a firm foundation for what turned out to be a fine series.Bottom line: if you feel the need to be happy or uplifted after watching a program, this might not be for you. It is sad, haunting, and some of the stories will stick with you for a long time, much like the crimes it depicts. However, it has a ring of truth to it, it is still thrilling, and occasionally, we see an episode that really makes one think about a society which can produce such miscreants. Not a feel-good show at all, but an important one. Highly recommended.",5,Gritty and Important,1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,2860,"['first', 'Law', 'Order', 'Spinoff', 'series', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'often', 'stark', 'depressing', 'look', 'most', 'destructive', 'crimes', 'being', 'committed', 'today', 'series', 'uncompromising', 'look', 'minds', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'sex', 'offenders', 'what', 'day', ""'d"", 'rather', 'just', 'ignore', 'Occasionally', 'lurid', 'often', 'brilliant', 'show', 'Law', 'Order', 'entertaining', ""'ripped-from-the-headlines"", 'storytelling', 'reminding', 'audience', 'what', 'casually', 'glossed', 'over', 'news', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'story-driven', 'show', 'incarnation', 'focused', 'much', 'more', 'lives', 'detectives', 'Special', 'Victims', 'Unit', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'Detective', 'Stabler', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'dedicated', 'work', 'fact', 'wife', 'daughters', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'movivation', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'get', 'bad', 'guys', 'street', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'daughters', 'being', 'abused', 'next', 'partner', 'Detective', 'Bensen', 'played', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'work', 'different', 'reasons', 'fact', 'was', 'product', 'rape', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'motivations', 'being', 'unit', 'are', 'very', 'complicated', 'Richard', 'Belser', 'role', ""'Homicide"", 'Detective', 'John', 'Munch', 'lot', 'black', 'humor', 'show', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'work', 'Belser', 'terriffic', 'actor', 'partner', 'first', 'year', 'was', 'Michelle', 'Hurd', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'supplanted', 'Ice-T.', 'Hurd', 'played', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'policewoman', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'prepared', 'rigors', 'job', 'was', 'forced', 'off', 'squad', 'year', 'end', 'Rounding', 'out', 'cast', 'was', 'Dann', 'Florek', 'reprising', 'role', 'Captain', 'Cragen', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'loved', 'series', 'great', 'here', 'too', 'walking', 'line', 'being', 'tough', 'supportive', 'detectives.Although', 'more', 'emphasis', 'was', 'placed', 'characters', 'was', 'still', 'Law', 'Order', 'meant', 'stories', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'were', 'first', 'season', 'dealt', 'plethora', 'sex', 'abuses', 'including', 'rape', 'incest', 'child', 'abuse', 'statutory', 'rape', 'more', 'Subsequent', 'seasons', 'would', 'have', 'greater', 'variety', 'story', 'devices', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'definitely', 'firm', 'foundation', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'fine', 'series.Bottom', 'line', 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'happy', 'uplifted', 'watching', 'program', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'sad', 'haunting', 'stories', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'time', 'much', 'crimes', 'However', 'ring', 'truth', 'still', 'thrilling', 'occasionally', 'see', 'episode', 'really', 'one', 'think', 'society', 'can', 'produce', 'such', 'miscreants', 'Not', 'feel-good', 'show', 'important', 'one', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

The writing is top-notch, the acting is great, and the cases tend to strike an emotional chord within us who want to see sex offenders brought to justice.  I won't bore you with an episode-by-episode rundown.  The show is set up differently from regular Law & Order in that you actually get to know the characters from their private lives and why they react to certain crimes and criminals the way they do.Now, the question you want answered is: Is it worth the money?  The series alone is.  It's highly entertaining and captivating.  The special features are a little scarce, with only two good but short featurettes.  In my opinion, ever dvd set of a television series should really go all out with the features.  Let the public in on the process!  Give us some outtakes and behind the scenes goodies.  We know you have them!  The show gets 5 stars, the set 4.

ALL of the bad guys are white males.  If a victim's family happens to be conservative or traditional, they are presented as partly at fault for the victim's demise.  One episode was contrived (to reveal it would be a semi spoiler).  A foot patrol cop was invited to a party of glitterati and he brought his camcorder, how convenient!  Even the illegal immigrants are white East Europeans.  In NYC are there not even cases that only involve people of color?However, just like Liberals who watch 24 for its virtues; L&O; SVU has its strong points.  Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni do well as Benson and Stabler.  You believe that a single career woman and a father of four can work well together without asking how.

But there is one reason why the 27th precinct's Detective at the scene wants to hand over the case to Manhattan Special Victims. Who ever killed the guy took his ""cigar."" Unlike the first CSI spin-off, Special Victims Unit focuses the subject matter of rape and abuse. There are some murder throughout this season, but most of it focuses on rapists and pedophiles. The victims are mostly children and women in these heinous crimes.The members of this unit are:Detective Elliot Stabler, a devout Catholic, a husband and father of four. He has to deal with the worst in human nature every time he pulls out of the driveway and leaves his loving family. We see as he tries to raise his kids knowing what he experienced at work.Detective Olivia Benson, a product of rape and probably the most dedicated Detective in Manhattan's Special Victims. Unlike the family man that is Stabler, Olivia never has time for a serious relationship. Most of her time is put into her job. She is the heart of Special Victims.Detective John Munch, retired from Baltimore PD's Homicide Unit, John moved to New York and decided to work in Special Victims, a huge contrast from Homicide, where the victims are usually cold stiffs on an operating table as opposed to the live victims whose tormenting stories touch your soul, even if you're as world-weary as Munch.Detective Monique Jeffries, the only other female detective in a sex crimes unit. Her motivations aren't never shown as to why she joined Special Victims. I liked the electricity between her and Munch when they had to become partners. His chauvinistic remarks and her feminine comebacks.Detective Brian Cassidy, Munch's first partner on the show. He is not one of the main characters in the intro titles, but maybe he should've been. Watching Munch with Cassidy was like watching him train his protege. But I'm sure that you all know that this partnership did not last. See why.Detective Ken Briscoe on the show he was Lennie's Nephew, but in reality, he is Jerry's son.Captain Donald Cragen, a recovering alcoholic who transferred from Anti-Coruption. After three years with the 27th and two run-ins with Mike Logan we see Captain Cragen again. Now he's in charge of running Manhattan's Special Victims Unit located in the 13th Precinct. With his wife dead he looks for another reason not to grab the bottle. And the answer is, the job.In this season you will see some our current struggles with deviants such as predators who hide among a crowded subway car or behind a computer screen. There is also the topic of taboo and human sexuality. In fact, i found that the topic of sex was more open in this season than in any other. But you are a fan of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, then go ahead and get the first year. This is the year that started it off. There are alums from Law & Order making guest appearances including: Angie Harmon, J.K Simmons, Carolyn McCormick, Jerry Orbach, Jesse L. Martin, Leslie Hendrix, Sam Waterston and Steven Hill. Also be on the lookout for the crossover episode ""Entitled."" NOTE: You will not find the concluding episode on this DVD set. Part II is on ""season 10"" of the ""original Law & Order.""

The brainchild of Law & Order creator Dick Wolf (former writer for hit TV shows such as Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice), Law & Order SVU is filmed on location in New York City. It follows the traditional half-police drama/half-courtroom drama format that made its forerunner a smashing success, yet SVU focuses exclusively on sexually based offenses...Law & Order SVU tells the story of a group of dedicated detectives who work for the elite group known as the Special Victims Unit. Capt. Donald Cragen (Dann Florek) heads up the unit which includes four regular detectives - Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), John Munch (Richard Belzer), and Odafin Tutuola (Ice-T). While investigating rapes, murders, and other vicious crimes, the detectives often consult with police psychologist Dr. George Huang (B.D. Wong) who provides special insight into the minds of suspected predators. Once the detectives gather the necessary evidence, they turn their case over to Assistant District Attorney Casey Novak (Diane Neal) who brokers deals and prosecutes the cases that put these nefarious criminals behind bars...The Law & Order SVU (Season 1) DVD features a number of dramatic episodes including the series premiere ""Payback"" in which a cab driver is discovered stabbed to death with his genitals cut off. When detectives Stabler and Benson investigate, they find out that the man is a former soldier from the Serbo-Croatian conflict and that he was a rapist. Benson, a child of rape, is sympathetic to the actions of rape victims, and Stabler must keep her from crossing the line to protect the probable suspects...

768372,A3PFYGUA9E0V0M,B0000AVHCA,"Bryan J. Peterson ""I'm not blind drunk, I'm j...","[0, 0]","I was never a particular fan of the original Law and Order. But I instantly took to its first spinoff, Special Victims Unit (SVU), when my mother introduced me to it some years back. Admittedly the show had already been on for a few seasons by then and so I was unfamiliar with the backgrounds of the various characters. But I became enough of a fan to react withdelight when I discovered that the series was available on DVD.Special Victims unit, unlike the original, brings to light a disturbing issue that until then was almost never brought up directly on television, sex crimes. Everything from rape to child molestation to domestic abuse, SVU sheds a light on the disturbing and unspeakable things we as individuals can do to one another, as well as the emotional and psychological effects those crimes can have, not only on the victims but also on the investigators who work tirelessly to bring the perpetrators to justice. One thing is for certain. If you want constant laughs, don't watch this. Oh John Munch in particular can and often does provide a bit of comic relief in the earlier seasons but that isn't the series' primary focus.THe first season of SVU introduces us to detectives Eliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), as well as all the rest of the squad. The season opens with Payback, as the squad is investigating the murder and castration of a taxi driver. As often happens however, the investigation quickly reveals a disturbing side to the victim that suggests that his murderer may have had good reason to hate him, as well as ample justification for the crime. Others include ""...or just look like one,"" in which a would-be model is raped and her body dropped off in front of a hospital. This particular case hits close to home for Stabler, whose daughter Maureen seems to be exhibiting the classic signs of an eating disorder. In Wanderlust, a travel writer is murdered seemingly after having just had sex. Suspicion quickly falls on the disfunctional family of the man's former landlord, particularly when it's discovered that her minor daughter may have been having a sexual relationship with the deceased. In CLosure, the squad is faced with a baffling series of rapes in which the perpetrator asks his victims if they like it and then forces them to shower afterwards and steels a piece of jewelry from each of them. This story ark isn't resolved until the second season. In CHat Room, a girl claims to have been raped by a man she met on the internet, leading the SVU into the world of online pedofilia. In Limitations, the SVU is ordered once and for all to close an unsolved case of three rapes before the Statute of Limitations expires in a matter of days. THings become complicated however when one of the victims appears to be protecting the perpetrator on religious grounds. In Nocturn, a laundromat turns in some disturbing photos of a young boy, leading the SVU to investigate a piano teacher for longterm child molestation. They discover a series of tapes chronicling the life of a boy named Evan, but when they track him down they discover that his testimony may not be of any help since he's more deeply scarred than any of them realized. In Remorse, a local reporter tries to catch her rapist by discussing the incident on the news. During the investigation, Munch quickly becomes attached to the courageous woman. In Contact, the detectives find themselves faced with a series of subway rapes perpetrated by a flash and dash assailant and a number of possible suspects. THe season ends with Slaves, in which the SVU detectives find themselves investigating the disappearance of a young Romanian woman while at the same time contending with psychological evaluations by the higher-ups, who warn Captain Cragen that one of his detectives may no longer be fit for their job.All in all, SVU season one gets the series off to a solid start and as the later seasons will show, it only gets better from here. And the DVD set features some excellent extras, among them interviews with the cast and a tour of the SVU set with Dan FLorek (Captain Cragen) as the guide. So it's definitely worth owning. And I intend to collect the entire series as finances permit.",5,Powerful and gripping.,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,4229,"['was', 'never', 'particular', 'fan', 'original', 'Law', 'Order', 'instantly', 'took', 'first', 'spinoff', 'Special', 'Victims', 'Unit', 'SVU', 'when', 'mother', 'introduced', 'years', 'back', 'Admittedly', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'few', 'seasons', 'then', 'so', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'backgrounds', 'various', 'characters', 'became', 'enough', 'fan', 'react', 'withdelight', 'when', 'discovered', 'series', 'was', 'available', 'DVD.Special', 'Victims', 'unit', 'original', 'light', 'disturbing', 'issue', 'then', 'was', 'almost', 'never', 'brought', 'up', 'directly', 'television', 'sex', 'crimes', 'Everything', 'rape', 'child', 'molestation', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'SVU', 'light', 'disturbing', 'unspeakable', 'things', 'individuals', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'effects', 'crimes', 'can', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'victims', 'also', 'investigators', 'who', 'work', 'tirelessly', 'bring', 'perpetrators', 'justice', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'want', 'constant', 'laughs', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Oh', 'John', 'Munch', 'particular', 'can', 'often', 'provide', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief', 'earlier', 'seasons', ""n't"", 'series', 'primary', 'focus.THe', 'first', 'season', 'SVU', 'introduces', 'detectives', 'Eliot', 'Stabler', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'Olivia', 'Benson', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'as', 'well', 'rest', 'squad', 'season', 'Payback', 'squad', 'investigating', 'murder', 'castration', 'taxi', 'driver', 'often', 'however', 'investigation', 'quickly', 'disturbing', 'side', 'victim', 'murderer', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'reason', 'hate', 'as', 'well', 'ample', 'justification', 'crime', 'Others', 'include', 'just', 'look', 'one', 'would-be', 'model', 'raped', 'body', 'dropped', 'off', 'front', 'hospital', 'particular', 'case', 'close', 'home', 'Stabler', 'daughter', 'Maureen', 'be', 'exhibiting', 'classic', 'signs', 'eating', 'disorder', 'Wanderlust', 'travel', 'writer', 'murdered', 'seemingly', 'having', 'just', 'had', 'sex', 'Suspicion', 'quickly', 'disfunctional', 'family', 'man', 'former', 'landlord', 'particularly', 'when', 'discovered', 'minor', 'daughter', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'deceased', 'CLosure', 'squad', 'faced', 'baffling', 'series', 'rapes', 'perpetrator', 'victims', 'like', 'then', 'shower', 'afterwards', 'steels', 'piece', 'jewelry', 'story', 'ark', ""n't"", 'resolved', 'second', 'season', 'CHat', 'Room', 'girl', 'claims', 'have', 'been', 'raped', 'man', 'met', 'internet', 'leading', 'SVU', 'world', 'online', 'pedofilia', 'Limitations', 'SVU', 'ordered', 'once', 'close', 'unsolved', 'case', 'three', 'rapes', 'Statute', 'Limitations', 'matter', 'days', 'THings', 'become', 'complicated', 'however', 'when', 'one', 'victims', 'be', 'protecting', 'perpetrator', 'religious', 'grounds', 'Nocturn', 'laundromat', 'disturbing', 'photos', 'young', 'boy', 'leading', 'SVU', 'investigate', 'piano', 'teacher', 'longterm', 'child', 'molestation', 'discover', 'series', 'tapes', 'chronicling', 'life', 'boy', 'named', 'Evan', 'when', 'track', 'down', 'discover', 'testimony', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'help', 'more', 'deeply', 'scarred', 'realized', 'Remorse', 'local', 'reporter', 'tries', 'catch', 'rapist', 'discussing', 'incident', 'news', 'investigation', 'Munch', 'quickly', 'attached', 'courageous', 'woman', 'Contact', 'detectives', 'find', 'faced', 'series', 'subway', 'rapes', 'perpetrated', 'flash', 'dash', 'assailant', 'number', 'possible', 'suspects', 'THe', 'season', 'Slaves', 'SVU', 'detectives', 'find', 'investigating', 'disappearance', 'young', 'Romanian', 'woman', 'same', 'time', 'contending', 'psychological', 'evaluations', 'higher-ups', 'who', 'warn', 'Captain', 'Cragen', 'one', 'detectives', 'may', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'fit', 'job.All', 'SVU', 'season', 'one', 'series', 'solid', 'start', 'later', 'seasons', 'will', 'show', 'only', 'better', 'here', 'DVD', 'set', 'excellent', 'extras', 'interviews', 'cast', 'tour', 'SVU', 'set', 'Dan', 'FLorek', 'Captain', 'Cragen', 'guide', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning', 'intend', 'collect', 'entire', 'series', 'finances', 'permit']",N/A

768383,A3N2SZKSUQNS6F,B0000AVHCA,K. Downey,"[37, 39]","Dick Wolf masterminded another great spin-off from the Law & Order franchise with Law & Order SVU (originally titled Sex Crimes)which consistently now ranks in the top 20 shows. This DVD set is an exciting way to capture the beginnings of the series and to see how much growth has occurred in the writing and character development. The series manages to tackle a number of gripping sexually based subjects without being exploitative. In fact, the writing on this series is top-notch and never seems to grow stale or contrived.As the intro to each episode states, the SVU, or Special Victims Unit, is in charge of particularly heinous crimes that are sexually based. Lead detectives are Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni). Detective Munch (Richard Belzer) is paired first with Cassidy (Dean Winters) and later with Jefferies (Michelle Hurd). Ice-T doesn't become Munch's partner until season two. The entire group of detectives is commanded by Captain Don Cragen (Dann Florek).As a previous viewer stated there are commercials at the beginning of disc one, but on that disc only. The set includes 22 full length episodes including the pilot for the series. Two featurettes are also on the final disc. Special Victims Unit: The Beginning features cast members and producers giving insight into the making of and success of the show.

Unfortunately, in later years, the producers of SVU have written Munch off as a secondary character, when he should always be front and center.  While other actors swagger and chew scenery, Belzer conveys Munch's compassion exquisitely and with subtlety.  It's a performance that has been sadly underappreciated for many years through many series, except by the fans.Ice-T's Fin is definitely is best ever partner, but Fin doesn't appear until the second season.  Until then, we must deal with two weaker &quot;partners&quot; (no reflection on the actors, it's just clear the writers didn't know what to do with them), although at least we have the one year when Munch was in the spotlight as a character.I don't find the quality of the release technically any worse than the usual grade of DVD season releases for other shows, though SVU deserves better.",5,Terrific show in the year when Munch actually had lines,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,937,"['watch', 'SVU', 'Richard', 'Belzer', 'subtle', 'tragic-comic', 'performance', 'John', 'Munch', 'Unfortunately', 'later', 'years', 'producers', 'SVU', 'have', 'written', 'Munch', 'off', 'secondary', 'character', 'when', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'front', 'center', 'other', 'actors', 'swagger', 'chew', 'scenery', 'Belzer', 'Munch', 'compassion', 'exquisitely', 'subtlety', 'performance', 'been', 'sadly', 'underappreciated', 'many', 'years', 'many', 'series', 'fans.Ice-T', 'Fin', 'definitely', 'best', 'ever', 'partner', 'Fin', ""n't"", 'appear', 'second', 'season', 'then', 'must', 'deal', 'two', 'weaker', 'quot', 'partners', 'quot', 'reflection', 'actors', 'just', 'clear', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'least', 'have', 'one', 'year', 'when', 'Munch', 'was', 'spotlight', 'character.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'quality', 'release', 'technically', 'worse', 'usual', 'grade', 'DVD', 'season', 'releases', 'other', 'shows', 'SVU', 'better']",N/A
768394,A3T0OTH5072YRE,B0000AVHCA,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[0, 0]","I always feel a tad depraved when watching this show.  After all, it's the Special Victims Unit, child molestation, rape, elder abuse, just a slew of bad things to take in through your video screen.  And it's that whole train wreck scenario, you can't look away.  But then I have to remind myself that despite the subject matter, there is a slew of great actors and actresses on this show and that's the real reason I watch.  Granted there's a reason human beings are attracted to crime, we're naturally curious creatures, but we have compassion too, and this show also allows us to exercise that side of our emotions as well.  So as horrible as the subject matter is, I continue to watch it because it gives me hope the bad guys can get caught and justice can be served.Season One is of course the beginning of it all.  Because this show is still running, and still had most of it's core cast members.  As the first season there are some flaws in it, things that were still being developed and people getting a feel for the characters.  Since this is aired on television more often than not, I hazard a guess that most people who start watching this show won't start at the beginning, but if they do, this is where they get introduced to some of the key characters.Characters:Olivia Benson: Mariksa HargitayElliot Stabler: Christopher MeloniJohn Munch: Richard BelzerDonald Cragen: Dann FlorekThese are the characters you want to watch for, the core cast.  Hargitay is best known for her work on this show and she seems very dedicated to it.  Her role as Olivia Benson is always done wonderfully because she is so full of compassion but can still remain tough at the same time.  She focuses on the case but does let her emotions rule her sometimes.  And while her story is a little all over the place in this season, in later seasons she becomes the strongest character.  Meloni as Stabler also does a tremendous job.  He's the family man who takes things home that he doesn't mean to, but wants to protect his family and can't help but be overprotective.  He's the tough guy but also a good guy, who's looking out for the best interest of the victims.  And Richard Belzer, his role as Munch, the sarcastic conspiracy theory detective who still wants to do good for the world is fantastic.  He adds levity to the hard topics but still recognizes that they are trying to protect the innocent.  And Florek, well it just wouldn't be SVU without Captain Cragen.There are other characters of course, but most don't last past this season.  That's not to say they weren't good actors.  They were, and I really miss some of them in the later seasons, but there parts can be crucial.  Munch has several partners in this show and both of them are fantastic.  Jeffries, played by Michelle Hurd, is a pretty sassy and tough woman, and I like some of the quick retorts she has for the criminals.  Detective Cassidy, played by Dean Winters, is actually one of my favorites.  He's a bit immature but a good guy at heart, and surprisingly sensitive.  Makes me melt every time I see him on screen.All the episodes revolve around hard topics.  Sex, rape, bondage, child molestation, child porn, every horrible thing you can think of is explored in this series.  Obviously this is not a show for children.  And it's tragic, there are several episodes that will bring you to tears and others that will make you install six locks on your door, even if you live in a small town.  I hate to say that they will make you rethink how safe you are, but if it brings a little caution to the reckless, I can't say that's a bad thing.  I believe in general people are good, but you have your anomalies.  In addition to the different cases with each episode, there are sub-plots that run the whole season.  Like Stabler's family life, and Benson's parentage.  Which means that even while you don't have to watch them in order, it is worth it just to keep up with those sub-plots.While I'm not going to describe every episode here, I do want to point out a few of my favorites.  In fact, the premier episode ""Payback"" is one of the ones that stands out for me because of how sad one of the victims make me feel.  In Payback, a cabdriver is found castrated and it is later learned that he was wanted for War Crimes against women in his native country.  As they look to find his killer, they can't help but feel saddened by the violence he has taken against his victims.  Another episode, ""Russian Love Poem"" was also interesting in the way it described desire and loyalty and people's perverse notions of them.  The episode deals with a man found murdered in his bondage suit and his Russian mistress as the most likely suspect.  All of the episodes have some kind of lesson to be learned in them though, even if it's just a lesson in how horrific people can be to each other.And while the episodes could have been a little better polished with the dialogue (some felt stitled and unnatural to me between the detectives) I think that as each episode progressed it got better and better as they actors fell into their roles.  Even watching the last episode to the first you can see growth in the characters.  So I can forgive that maybe it wasn't as professional in the beginning as it was towards the end.  The only other complaint that I would have is that the camera shots weren't always the greatest, clarity was missing sometimes or movement didn't seem natural.  Of course the detectives were always center stage which is good, but I think there could have been some more polishing there as well.A fantastic series and this was a solid start to that series.  I always recommend watching something in order, and you won't be sorry if you start with this season.  It's the building block for everything.Review by M.

What the original series lacked is made up for in 'SVU' namely, a close look into the lives of the characters.  Meloni (Det. Stabler) is the guy you would want for a father or brother... while Det. Benson (Hagerty), is someone you'd like to just embrace and comfort her pain, (knowing of course that she'd never allow it). Most of these characters are well developed in their roles, but never cease to surprise us with something we weren't expecting.  As for the DVD quality, as i recall, Dick Wolf's fight with the networks was regarding the usage of non 35mm film, for the sole purpose of giving the L&O shows a more gritty texture, and not something from a home video camera. It works.  You know what they say, ""If something works, don't mess with it.""  My only true disapointment in the show was seeing Det. Jeffries resign.  But let me side bar with you for a moment, and take you down memory lane with some other shows for the purpose of contrast. The original Star Trek, The A-Team, Gilligans Island, and oh sooooo many more... what do all these shows have in common? By the end of every show, each person was back in their respective place. Those Trekkers out there know that if you wore a red uniform in the original Star Trek you were as good as dead (even if it did take 5 minutes) but no main character ever resigned or was truly killed by shows end. The 'A-Team' for those of you who don't know, were supposed to be ex-green beret, and no one ever left or died on that show!  My point is that Dick Wolf's Law & Order Franchise (including SVU) broke all the stereo types. It incorporates drama with occasional humour, and draws you close enough to feel the pain of the characters involved.  That's what good acting is all about folks, connecting with the audience. The Icing on the proverbial cake, however, has been the strong women throughout this series.  The Assistant District Attourney's alone have been the result of some great casting. My only advice to Mr. Wolf (As if he needed any) Is to more fully develope Ice-T's character, and perhaps the M.E.",5,L&O Special Victims Unit - A Thought Provoking Series,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,2188,"['poor', 'opinion', 'given', 'Florida', 'just', 'that-', 'opinion', 'Now', 'here', 'opinion', 'enthralling', 'show', 'What', 'original', 'series', 'lacked', 'made', 'up', ""'SVU"", 'namely', 'close', 'look', 'lives', 'characters', 'Meloni', 'Det', 'Stabler', 'guy', 'would', 'want', 'father', 'brother', 'Det', 'Benson', 'Hagerty', 'someone', ""'d"", 'like', 'just', 'embrace', 'comfort', 'pain', 'knowing', 'course', ""'d"", 'never', 'allow', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'roles', 'never', 'cease', 'surprise', 'something', 'were', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'DVD', 'quality', 'i', 'recall', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'fight', 'networks', 'was', 'regarding', 'usage', 'non', '35mm', 'film', 'sole', 'purpose', 'giving', 'L', 'O', 'more', 'gritty', 'texture', 'not', 'something', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'something', 'works', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'only', 'true', 'disapointment', 'show', 'was', 'seeing', 'Det', 'Jeffries', 'resign', 'let', 'side', 'bar', 'moment', 'take', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'other', 'shows', 'purpose', 'contrast', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'A-Team', 'Gilligans', 'Island', 'oh', 'sooooo', 'many', 'more', 'what', 'do', 'shows', 'have', 'common', 'end', 'show', 'person', 'was', 'back', 'respective', 'place', 'Trekkers', 'out', 'there', 'know', 'wore', 'red', 'uniform', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'were', 'as', 'good', 'dead', 'even', 'did', 'take', '5', 'minutes', 'main', 'character', 'ever', 'resigned', 'was', 'truly', 'killed', 'shows', 'end', 'A-Team', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'ex-green', 'beret', 'one', 'ever', 'left', 'died', 'show', 'point', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'Law', 'Order', 'Franchise', 'including', 'SVU', 'broke', 'stereo', 'types', 'drama', 'occasional', 'humour', 'close', 'enough', 'feel', 'pain', 'characters', 'involved', 'what', 'good', 'acting', 'folks', 'connecting', 'audience', 'Icing', 'proverbial', 'cake', 'however', 'been', 'strong', 'women', 'series', 'Assistant', 'District', 'Attourney', 'alone', 'have', 'been', 'result', 'great', 'casting', 'only', 'advice', 'Mr.', 'Wolf', 'needed', 'more', 'fully', 'develope', 'Ice-T', 'character', 'perhaps', 'M.E']",N/A
