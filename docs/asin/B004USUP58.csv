I fast forwarded it a bit though because it was so mindlessly dull and I wanted something to happen. Finally a boat tipped over. Some people decided to swim. They find a turtle shell. Then some get eaten by a shark. That's the whole movie. Just scenes of water under, on top, the moon, people swimming. It was like watching a documentary. The ending was horrible. It wasn't a real ending. They just stopped the movie and did text on the screen to tell you show it ends.I started laughing hysterically after this  movie was over because it just numbed my mind so much. It was ALMOST suspenseful at parts, but the suspense ending up just being frustration. It took forever for them to swim to land after they saw it. He swam faster to the floaty thing than he swam to the land. It felt like days passed and it wasn't that far away.This movie is good if you want to watch a documentary about people floating in the water. But if you want a scary shark movie this is not it. I rented it because of the reviews. NO IDEA why it has good reviews. If you are scared or excited by this then it does not take much to scare or excite you. I should also mention a good portion of the movie is filled with close ups of a guys face as he looks under water for a shark. Just over and over. Close up of his face to look for the shark. Then he doesn't really do anything about it. Just looks at it. And either says ""I don't see it"" or ""I see it"" like that really helps.",2,No clue why this has so many good reviews.,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1613,"['almost', 'stopped', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'money', 'had', 'spent', 'renting', 'so', 'figured', ""'d"", 'try', 'finish', 'up', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'bit', 'was', 'so', 'mindlessly', 'dull', 'wanted', 'something', 'happen', 'Finally', 'boat', 'tipped', 'over', 'people', 'decided', 'swim', 'find', 'turtle', 'shell', 'Then', 'get', 'eaten', 'shark', 'whole', 'movie', 'Just', 'scenes', 'water', 'top', 'moon', 'people', 'swimming', 'was', 'watching', 'documentary', 'ending', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'ending', 'just', 'stopped', 'movie', 'did', 'text', 'screen', 'tell', 'show', 'ends.I', 'started', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'just', 'numbed', 'mind', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'ALMOST', 'suspenseful', 'parts', 'suspense', 'ending', 'up', 'just', 'being', 'frustration', 'took', 'forever', 'swim', 'land', 'saw', 'swam', 'faster', 'floaty', 'thing', 'land', 'felt', 'like', 'days', 'passed', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'away.This', 'movie', 'good', 'want', 'watch', 'documentary', 'people', 'floating', 'water', 'want', 'scary', 'shark', 'movie', 'not', 'rented', 'reviews', 'NO', 'IDEA', 'why', 'good', 'reviews', 'are', 'scared', 'excited', 'then', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'scare', 'excite', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'filled', 'close', 'ups', 'guys', 'face', 'water', 'shark', 'Just', 'over', 'Close', 'face', 'look', 'shark', 'Then', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'see', 'really']",N/A
1428533,AJRZ98VIOES0U,B004USUP58,Argyle Ronin,"[0, 0]","The Reef, like ""Open Water"" before it, is about a group of divers (shipwrecked swimmers in this instance) who get picked off one-by-one by a man eating Great White. This Great White is especially hungry as he is hunting for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and probably a midnight snack.This movie is loosely based on true events. In 1983, Ray Boundy was the sole survivor of a shipwreck off the coast of Queensland after his other 2 crew mates were eaten alive by a Tiger Shark. Apply the same setting (Queensland), add 2 more crew members, switch out the Tiger Shark for a Great White, and you have The Reef. The director filmed a similar Crocodile attack movie prior to this shark tale, so he likes the killer animal premise.Is The Reef like Jaws? No way. Deep Blue Sea? Nope. This is a straight-up low-budget cult flick. The actors are decent, not remarkable. The scenes that include the shark up close are done pretty well. The story is minimal.

E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Maybe I've become desensitized to shark movies over the years, but I was honestly bored until the final 30 minutes- this is when the actual shark attacks *finally* get underway.  Everything taking place before this was your typical build-up of friends partying and going on a boat ride only to find that something happens and they're left stranded in the water.  We've seen this type of storytelling in every kind of shark movie ever.  Wanna know why?Because that's really the only thing you CAN create when it comes to shark attacks.  Oh, and what are the odds the shark would suddenly become exceptionally vicious right when the remaining survivors spot a resting area?  Come on!  It took forever for the survivors to reach safe ground- it was always *just* a few hundred yards away!Well the Reef does do a few things right.  First of all the acting is pretty good, especially by the female actress who plays lead role.  Her screaming and yelling during a shark attack actually struck me as believable.  You can sense a distinct type of screaming that really DOES sound like someone's life is in serious danger.  I sensed an authentic scream with her skills.  Excellent job there.  Another thing the Reef does correctly is occasionally show the survivors swimming for their lives in an attempt to escape the shark and the camera view does a magnificent job showing the people swimming from a sharks point of view and just how vulnerable we really are in that situation.  Gee no wonder the shark always wins- we're too slow!Overall, well if you're in the mood for another shark attack suspense, this movie probably falls a little short thanks to taking nearly an hour for the first attack to happen- the rest of the time is taken up with a VERY slow-moving atmosphere that fails to leave an impression on me due to being predictable, and the other reason I'm taking away one star is because all shark movies are basically the same since there's not much you can really do with this popular, worn out formula.

BLACK WATER director Andrew Traucki returns with another survival horror film entitled THE REEF, which is Australia's answer to OPEN WATER. Although it is very similar in structure, THE REEF fails to generate the same impact that OPEN WATER had on audiences in 2003 despite the inclusion of a menacing Great White that threatens the divers. Its greatest downfall is that Traucki's characters do nothing to draw the audience in to their perilous plight, and the larger cast sets the film up to be a body count picture (which Traucki does deliver). Like in BLACK WATER, however, THE REEF provides many more shocks and surprises that will have viewers jumping out of their seats! Traucki uses the same expert composites to place the shark right next to his actors for a number of jarring attacks. The use of real footage taken from right alongside all of the action gives the film a heightened sense of authenticity as well. With stronger central characters, THE REEF could have been a much more powerful film, but it is still sure to appeal to fans that were disappointed in OPEN WATER's overall inaction.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,ILHM Reviews: The Reef,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1299,"['snorkeling', 'trip', 'Great', 'Barrier', 'Reef', 'deadly', 'small', 'group', 'friends', 'when', 'boat', 'strikes', 'bottom', 'capsizes', 'shark', 'infested', 'waters', 'BLACK', 'WATER', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Traucki', 'survival', 'horror', 'film', 'entitled', 'THE', 'REEF', 'Australia', 'answer', 'OPEN', 'WATER', 'very', 'similar', 'structure', 'THE', 'REEF', 'generate', 'same', 'impact', 'OPEN', 'WATER', 'had', 'audiences', '2003', 'inclusion', 'menacing', 'Great', 'White', 'divers', 'greatest', 'downfall', 'Traucki', 'characters', 'do', 'nothing', 'draw', 'audience', 'perilous', 'plight', 'larger', 'cast', 'sets', 'film', 'up', 'be', 'body', 'count', 'picture', 'Traucki', 'deliver', 'BLACK', 'WATER', 'however', 'THE', 'REEF', 'many', 'more', 'shocks', 'surprises', 'will', 'have', 'viewers', 'jumping', 'seats', 'Traucki', 'same', 'expert', 'composites', 'place', 'shark', 'right', 'next', 'actors', 'number', 'jarring', 'attacks', 'use', 'real', 'footage', 'taken', 'right', 'action', 'film', 'heightened', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'as', 'well', 'stronger', 'central', 'characters', 'THE', 'REEF', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'still', 'sure', 'appeal', 'fans', 'were', 'disappointed', 'OPEN', 'WATER', 'overall', 'inaction.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

1428541,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B004USUP58,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 5]","Personally, I never plan to be in a situation where I have to choose between swimming through shark-infested waters to possible safety and staying atop a capsized sinking boat with very little chance of being rescued.  Unfortunately, that's exactly the situation the characters of The Reef find themselves in when their boat strikes a reef and capsizes in the waters of Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  Those beautiful blue Pacific waters aren't so inviting when you're suddenly forced to ponder the dangers that lie beneath.  It's true that The Reef follows the standard formula in a genre that is already bursting with shark attack movies in recent years, but this one is well worth watching because it is based on a true story (albeit loosely, with a number of significant changes) and, more importantly, it hits all the right buttons of fear, suspense, and realism.The trip was supposed to be a holiday for Luke (Damian Walshe-Howling), his friend Matt (Gyton Grantley), Matt's girlfriend Suzie (Adrienne Pickering), and Matt's sister (and Luke's former girlfriend) Kate (Zoe Naylor) - and so it was until their yacht hit a reef and capsized.  With the keel pretty much laid open, Luke lays out the group's options.  Option 1 is to stay on the slowly sinking boat and hope they are rescued before it goes down - but there is very little traffic in that area, the boat's old distress beacon can only be picked up by a plane flying overhead,  and the current is pushing them out toward the ocean.  Option 2 is to swim for it to Turtle Island twelve miles away.  Luke's sole crewman is adamant about staying with the boat because he knows they are in shark-infested waters, but Luke thinks their only realistic chance is to swim for it.  Personally, I would be staying there with Warren - no doubt about it.  No one even mentions the fact that, sharks or no sharks, any miscalculation on Luke's part would mean the swimmers would never find land of any type.We never get on intimate terms with these characters, but they're all likable enough for you to care what happens to them.  Being a great lover of sharks, I sometimes find myself pulling for the shark over annoying or patently unlikable characters, but that was not the case in The Reef.  This is one serious example of nature's perfect killing machine, to boot.  This shark looks like he's been in more than a few scrapes in his time - he's big, he's bad, and he's totally unstoppable.  It's no wonder the characters panic every time he puts in an appearance - and realistic panic it is.  They do exactly what they shouldn't do, splashing around all over the place as they cling to one another in fear.  The actresses do a particularly good job of demonstrating shock - particularly Zoe Naylor, whose over-the-top facial expressions would be laughable in any other situation.  As far as I'm concerned, though, there's no such thing as overacting when it comes to displaying the fear of being eaten alive by a magnificent shark.One of the great things about this Australian movie is that it was actually shot out on the water (in Harvey Bay), and the shark footage is real (shot specifically for this movie).  For an entire month, the actors spent up to ten hours a day, six days a week in the water (presumably, inside a large, protective tank) dealing with weather changes and some serious skin wrinkling.  At one point, Damian Walshe-Howling had to be rushed to a hospital after being stung by a poisonous fish.  The point is -- these aren't a bunch of dopes in a studio pool relying on CGI sharks.  They're as close to actually swimming with the sharks as anyone but a complete lunatic could be.

1428547,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004USUP58,DVD Verdict,"[9, 10]","Judge Patrick Naugle, DVD Verdict-- To look at the cover of The Reef you would assume one of two things. The first would be that this is a chintzy, fourth rate B-movie from a studio cashing in on every other killer shark movie made in the past decade, especially the upcoming big budget thriller Shark Night 3D (which, by the way, looks flippin' awesome...but I digress). The second would be that this is one of those Roger Corman produced Syfy station clunkers about various slimy, horrible monsters/reptiles/mutations/hybrids that battle each other under a San Francisco bridge. The good news is you'd be wrong on both counts: The Reef is a small but tightly tuned thriller that gets the job done when it comes to killer sharks and fleshy bodies floating around in the water.The Reef is one of those movies that is scary not because it's well constructed (although it's put together well) and not because it uses music to maximum effect (although that's not bad, either). No, The Reef is scary because it drops you into a situation that, even in the hands of Ed Wood or Uwe Boll, would make you crap your pants on a Sunday in the middle of a rainstorm. It's pretty hard to screw up throwing sane, competent adults into the middle of the ocean with mindless eating machines.The Reef is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen in 1080p resolution. This is a very good looking image that has sharp colors and a very crisp picture. Much of the film takes place outdoors on the open sea and the bright blues of both the open ocean and the clear skies make for a vibrant, often brightly lit picture. No noticeable defects can be seen during the film's runtime. Overall Image Entertainment has done a very fine job with this transfer.The soundtrack is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and, while adequate to the film, doesn't leave a lot to be desired in the way of giving your sound system a hearty workout. There are some sporadic moments when the rear and front speakers kick in to give the viewer a nice surround sound feel--mainly during the shark attacks--but this is a mostly front heavy sound mix filled with moments of ambient sound (and some scary music). Also included on this disc are English SDH and Spanish subtitles.There is little in the way of extra features on The Reef. All viewers get is a fairly short making-of featurette titled ""Shooting with Sharks"" which has some talking head interviews with the cast and the crew, behind-the-scenes footage and other EPK materials you'd find on typical promo pieces.-Full review at dvdverdict.com",4,Style over substance and thrills over violence,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,2546,"['Judge', 'Patrick', 'Naugle', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'look', 'cover', 'Reef', 'would', 'assume', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'would', 'be', 'chintzy', 'fourth', 'rate', 'B-movie', 'studio', 'cashing', 'other', 'killer', 'shark', 'movie', 'made', 'past', 'decade', 'especially', 'upcoming', 'big', 'budget', 'thriller', 'Shark', 'Night', '3D', 'way', 'flippin', 'awesome', 'digress', 'second', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'produced', 'Syfy', 'station', 'clunkers', 'various', 'slimy', 'horrible', 'monsters/reptiles/mutations/hybrids', 'battle', 'other', 'San', 'Francisco', 'bridge', 'good', 'news', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'counts', 'Reef', 'small', 'tightly', 'tuned', 'thriller', 'job', 'done', 'when', 'killer', 'sharks', 'fleshy', 'bodies', 'floating', 'around', 'water.The', 'Reef', 'one', 'movies', 'scary', 'not', 'well', 'constructed', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'not', 'music', 'maximum', 'effect', 'not', 'bad', 'No', 'Reef', 'scary', 'situation', 'even', 'hands', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'would', 'make', 'crap', 'pants', 'Sunday', 'middle', 'rainstorm', 'pretty', 'hard', 'screw', 'up', 'throwing', 'sane', 'competent', 'adults', 'middle', 'ocean', 'mindless', 'eating', 'machines.The', 'Reef', 'presented', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', '1080p', 'resolution', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'image', 'sharp', 'colors', 'very', 'crisp', 'picture', 'Much', 'film', 'place', 'outdoors', 'open', 'sea', 'bright', 'blues', 'open', 'ocean', 'clear', 'skies', 'make', 'vibrant', 'often', 'brightly', 'lit', 'picture', 'noticeable', 'defects', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'film', 'runtime', 'Overall', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'done', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'transfer.The', 'soundtrack', 'presented', '5.1', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'adequate', 'film', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'way', 'giving', 'sound', 'system', 'hearty', 'workout', 'are', 'sporadic', 'moments', 'when', 'rear', 'front', 'speakers', 'kick', 'give', 'viewer', 'nice', 'surround', 'sound', 'feel', 'mainly', 'shark', 'attacks', 'mostly', 'front', 'heavy', 'sound', 'mix', 'filled', 'moments', 'ambient', 'sound', 'scary', 'music', 'Also', 'included', 'disc', 'are', 'English', 'SDH', 'Spanish', 'little', 'way', 'extra', 'features', 'Reef', 'viewers', 'get', 'fairly', 'short', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Shooting', 'Sharks', 'talking', 'head', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'other', 'EPK', 'materials', ""'d"", 'find', 'typical', 'promo', 'pieces.-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",N/A

One minute it was sailing along, the next minute, everyone was under (in) the upside down boat.  The continuity was mishandled; there were time issues throughout this movie.  It wasn't only the water that was choppy.  The setup was a few brief vignettes that did nothing in the way of introducing the victims (I meant cast of characters).  If it wasn't for their frenzied shouting of ""Matty"" and ""Suzie"" at two key moments, I would never have known the names of at least 2 of the 5 characters involved.  A minimal amount of acting skills was required.  Basically, this was about a shark rarely seen.  The level of suspense was rudimentary at best.  It isn't difficult to play upon an inherent fear...what could be in the water below us!?  This movie was adequate.On the nonsensical side of things: apparently there were no lifejackets to be had.  They didn't bother patching the raft they ruined earlier.  No spear guns either, not so much as a butter knife for protection, no flares, the EPIRB was ancient and needed planes directly overhead to receive a signal.

There's no way for the viewer to tell how much the story was tweeked for filming purposes but the producers/ director conveyed this in a very unsensational, unexploitative. manner.Here's the scoop. Set in Australia, five friends (three guys and two women) set out on a cruise. About ten miles from shore their boat hits a reef and capsizes. There is little hope of rescue so they need to swim the ten miles back without getting eaten by sharks.I liked this. The shark thing has been done any number of times in film and I'm a bit surprised they keep rebooting it, but here you can see why. Everything in this movie happens in a very believable manner. The viewer is introduced to the characters just well enough in the beginning to sort them out. You don't get types. Just real people. When the boat hits the reef one of the two veterans in the group lays out their options logically. Nothing is trumped up. Just 'it is what it is' and this is our best course of action. Four go. One opts to stay. They hit the water and head back to shore. Then the sharks happen. These are not over-the-top Jaws style attacks. They're very quick and, though unspectacular, still carry a gravity in the way the players react. The final kill might have been a bit much but they could have played it a lot heavier and, thankfully, they didn't.It's shot and cut well. The actors all do a stand-up job.

The three survivors were attacked by one or more Tiger sharks, and only the captain was able to swim to a reef where he was rescued by searchers.""The Reef"" tells the story of four friends who are forced to abandon their overturned small yacht off the coast of North Queensland when the boat's keel is torn off by impact with rock or coral. There is little time for character development in the short time that elapses before tragedy strikes the travellers.Fearing that the boat will be carried further out to sea by the current or sink, the four decide to swim to Turtle Island which is believed to be about ten miles away. On their long swim they are constantly stalked by one of the most fearsome predators in the sea - a Great White shark. The impact of the story is greatly enhanced by the refusal of the film makers to fall back on unrealistic CGI sharks. As they are repeatedly attacked by the Great White, the actors appear to be actually in the sea with a real shark. The cinematography, both above and below water, deserves the highest marks. Without giving the story away, it can be said that the film has some truly frightening moments, and the sense of unrelenting menace creates almost unbearable tension and raises this film well above ""Open Water"" on a scare factor rating.The product of 15 million years of evolution, the Great White is probably the most intelligent shark in the sea, and noted for its ability to lift its head out of the water to appraise its prey or those who are hunting it, as was seen in ""Jaws"". Attack images of the outthrust jaws of Great White sharks are truly nightmarish and the film makers have not erred in placing this monster close to Turtle Island which is located at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef.

The way in which the movie puts you amongst the actors is really well done. You feel like you are there with them. When the camera dips under the surface of the water with the bobbing motion of the waves you get little glimpses of what lies beneath. The tension is unbearable at times and I felt sick with fear. It's the anticipation of the oncoming attack that had me wriggling in my seat. Believe me, when the first attack comes you will bang your head off the ceiling in fright.I admit that this is my worst fear. Being stalked by a predator in their own territory. Especially in the ocean by a Great White. You get moments of respite to catch your breath and lower your stress levels. That just adds to the tension as these guys have to push on to reach dry land.

A little while later the yacht capsizes and ends up w/ a hole in it.  Luke suggests to the group that they take a chance and swim back to that tiny island rather than take a chance and drift out further on the capsized yacht.  Everyone except Luke's working buddy agrees to swim back to the island; being a fisherman, he knows the waters have sharks in them.  Luke salvages a floatation board, breaks it, and divided the pieces to aid in swimming.  Luke guesses the island is 12 miles away and they should make it there in three hours.  Once they head out, drowning is the least of their worries.Of course, the hook of this movie is the suspense in which there is plenty of.  The gore and/or blood factor was not overused.

1428571,A2HLCXPW1HP0QB,B004USUP58,"T. Burns ""Slackjaw""","[29, 31]","It's hard to compare this movie to others. It was loosely based on a true story with some obvious liberties for plot.  It fell beneath the radar as it was an Austrailian made film.  Just in its release there were places banning the movie due to the expected effect that it would have on Austrailian tourism. Perhaps this is because it is a very realisticly made movie taking place in an area of Austrailia which is reknown for seals as well as the Apex predators that feed on them. The reefs are a beauty unlike any other but harbor many dangers. There is much realism in the production value here. By this I mean that they used only real sharks in the filming of the movie. No CGI effects to ""muddy the water"" here. The actors were in the water at times with a true Great White shark.I think that these facts add to the tension. And tension is what this movie gives you over and over.I will not spoil the fun but the basic plot takes 4 aussies out on a chartered boat together in search of a deserted island. They find it without any problem but within about 20 minutes of the film the subject matter takes a turn. The boat they are on hits a Reef in the middle of the night turning a nice trip into a fight for survival. Being in a remote area with no planes flying over is a recipe for disaster.  Some 12 miles away from the island they just visited (perhaps the size of a gymnasium) they find themselves in the water with no supplies (all washed into the ocean).  They climb on top of the far too damaged bottom of the boat and plan their next step.  The captain of the boat (a commercial fisherman and sea salt) makes the most prophetic and educated statement of the movie which is chilling to those with a fear of the ocean and it's elements,  ""I've fished these waters for years and I know what is in these waters. You will never get me into this water. I will stay on the boat no matter what!""Herein lies the tension of the film.  Forced with either staying on the boat until they are found (and possibly moving deeper into sea and more into trouble on the current that is pulling them to ?) OR making a life or death swim 12 miles through shark infested water to get back to the island they were forced to leave after a very brief visit.  I will not go into the whos and what's but some stay and some leave and what happens from here is over 1 hour of a life or death struggle with the fears that many of us dream about while safely out of said water.The biggest reason to watch this movie is because of the way it plays with you psychologically.  Early in the film one of the main characters has just gotten into the water for the first time and after several minutes of magnificent underwater life it all of a sudden gets extremely calm all around her. Like the sound has been completely taken away.  She looks around her, to the right, the left, behind her... And then she sees a shark swimming deep below the surface in the craggy reef.  She doesn't know what to do. Swim away? Sit still?  This is the mood that the directors are going for and it is achieved. A haunting sense of the unknown, of being in a situation you can't possible control.  This movie is well acted, well paced and enjoyable if you like a good scare or the uncomfortable feeling like that scare is slowly circling you and sizing you up..  At that point it is just too late...On the negatives a certain reef scene near the end is just a little too scripted to fit and I will give no more away.  Other than that particular scene near the end of the film it felt genuine and scary!In short, I highly reccomend this film.  It is not likely at your local rental store as it was not domestically touted but it is a truly well made and tense shark attack movie based on a true story.

1428573,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004USUP58,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","""Based on the true events,"" a 2010 Australian film ""The Reef"" follows the story of a group of five friends on vacation, whose yacht capsizes while sailing on the coral reef. In the middle of the ocean, with no land in sight, they have to make a tough decision: to stay or to swim. And for those who chose the latter there is another question: Is it safe?Filmed on location (and apparently with no computer graphics), ""The Reef"" benefits from its authentic scenery, but needs much better storytelling. I can accept cardboard characters and their boring romance as long as the film delivers the goods, which arrive too slowly. Much of the film's running time is spent on waiting for something to happen, and the wait is too long.You get some nice suspense during the shark attack scenes, which, however, start to look repetitious after a while, with characters doing the same things over and over again. This is to some extent understandable as what the completely defenseless humans in the shark-infested waters can do in reality is very limited, but at the same time diminishes the film's entertainment value considerably.""The Reef"" is written and directed by Andrew Traucki, who has directed (with David Nerlich) ""Black Water"" in 2007, a suspense movie with a similar storyline.

1428575,A2O0LIVTTFU75I,B004USUP58,W Mianecke,"[1, 2]","Okay, I feel like a heel for criticizing the sort of movie I've been waiting for for years. A normal-sized, real great white shark! Just as the many smaller REAL sharks in the film OPEN WATER were JUST AS SCARY if not more so and far more believable than some gargantuan special effect, this movie shows that any normal unarmed human being is going to be terrified and vulnerable floundering in the water with an approximately 10 foot long apex predator. I can't help but compare this to the team's previous film, BLACK WATER. The difference for me is, in BLACK WATER, I felt I was given enough time at the start to get to know and care about the characters AND it was difficult to predict who would be left alive, if any of them. In THE REEF, I felt the backstory for the two ""main"" protagonists was WAY too cliche'ed, as was their character development throughout the ordeal. Also, I almost hate to say it but the tension just went on and on and on and got to be too much. Sure, this was believable, but, the repeated shots of the actors gaping around looking shell-shocked started to become unintentionally comical after a while. Finally, I'm still undecided about the nature of the attacks. POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE- I felt the whole being yanked under, coming up once and then being yanked under for good just didn't quite make sense, given that this was not a huge shark which could swallow someone in two bites. The movie is so realistic and yet the attacks don't seem to jive with all the research I've read about how great whites DO hunt. I guess it was a budgetary concern but not one person was assaulted with the shark speeding straight up from below. But, as I said, I'm still on the fence about this. And the end, while also realistic and not at all the usual cliche'ed final confrontation (which one could argue wasn't the case with BLACK WATER) the realism made the viewing experience rather anti-climactic and ""is that it?"" for me. OPEN WATER had a similar effect, but, that was so clearly a TRAGEDY and I could empathize with the character's final choice. Overall, though, this is such an admirable film, and it's so nice to see real-looking people and not wise-cracking waxed-chested young male models as the leads. And this film contains one of the most joltingly realistic-looking scenes of a shark suddenly surfacing RIGHT NEXT TO REAL PEOPLE. AHHHHH! This alone brought me back to the so-thrilled-to-be-terrified feeling of seeing the original JAWS in a crowded theater when it was first released. Very cool.",4,NO CGI!
