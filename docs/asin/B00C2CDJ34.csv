1641500,AROVSENHMWEXO,B00C2CDJ34,orvuus,"[0, 0]","I got this movie primarily for &#34;The Blob,&#34; though I wanted to revisit Fright Night as well.  Both movies looked good -- no extras or subtitles -- but I never watched The Blob due to poor reviews when it came out, and I can see I missed out.  It is really a good movie, and though it is gory at times, it is always done for a reason and does not seem gratuitous.  The premise is highly believeable.  After watching Fright Night again I remembered what a good movie it was -- and how it was not really a great movie at the same time.  Twilight Time put out a nice blu ray for this which is now fetching astronomical prices, and though it would be nice to see on blu ray, frankly it is not such a good movie that I would pay a collector's price to see it on blu ray.",4,Two out of four ain't bad,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,771,"['got', 'movie', 'primarily', '34', 'Blob', '34', 'wanted', 'revisit', 'Fright', 'Night', 'as', 'well', 'movies', 'looked', 'good', 'extras', 'subtitles', 'never', 'watched', 'Blob', 'due', 'poor', 'reviews', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'missed', 'out', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'gory', 'times', 'always', 'done', 'reason', 'not', 'seem', 'gratuitous', 'premise', 'highly', 'believeable', 'watching', 'Fright', 'Night', 'again', 'remembered', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'Twilight', 'Time', 'put', 'out', 'nice', 'blu', 'ray', 'now', 'fetching', 'astronomical', 'prices', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'blu', 'ray', 'frankly', 'not', 'such', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'pay', 'collector', 'price', 'see', 'blu', 'ray']",The Blob

The Blob and Christine on one, Fright Night and The Seventh Sign on the other. All the movies are anamorphic widescreen and the picture quality is pretty solid considering 2 movies are on one dvd. There are no English or Spanish subtitles on any of the movies but there is closed captioning (English only) which you can receive through your tv set. The problem with cc is that cc will not work if your bluray or dvd player is connected to your t.v. via hdmi cable. All the single dvds of these movies had subtitles so I don't know why they are not included in this set. I was considering deducting a star for that but I don't need subtitles myself just wanted to give a heads up to those that do.The Blob - This is the 1988 remake not the original.  The movie is presented in 1:85 anamorphic widescreen. There are no extras. The original dvd from 2001 only had a trailer as an extra.Christine - The movie is presented in 2:35 anamorphic widescreen. There are no extras. It appears to be the same transfer used on the 2004 Special Edition dvd of Christine. The SE had a bunch of good special features. An audio commentary with John Carpenter and Keith Gordon, three featurettes, and 20 deleted scenes (about 26 minutes). It's too bad these extras weren't on this set. They were obviously left off to make room for the Blob.Fright Night - This is my favorite movie in the set. The movie is presented in 2:35 anamorphic widescreen. There are no extras. This is a good way to obtain this movie since the original dvd is now out of print. This is the same transfer and the only extra on the original was a trailer.The Seventh Sign - The movie is presented in 2:35 anamorphic widescreen.  There are no extras. The original dvd was a flipper dvd with this transfer on one side and a pan & scan transfer on the other. There were no extras on that dvd either (unless you consider the p&s; transfer an extra). Not even a trailer.",5,Four movies for the price of one!,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,2038,"['picked', 'up', '4-pack', '5', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'happy.The', 'set', '2', 'single-sided', 'dual', 'layered', 'dvds', '2', 'movies', 'Blob', 'Christine', 'one', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'solid', 'considering', '2', 'movies', 'are', 'one', 'dvd', 'are', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'movies', 'closed', 'captioning', 'English', 'only', 'can', 'receive', 'tv', 'set', 'problem', 'cc', 'cc', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'bluray', 'dvd', 'player', 'connected', 't.v', 'hdmi', 'cable', 'single', 'dvds', 'movies', 'had', 'subtitles', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'are', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'was', 'considering', 'deducting', 'star', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'subtitles', 'just', 'wanted', 'give', 'heads', 'up', 'do.The', 'Blob', '1988', 'remake', 'not', 'original', 'movie', 'presented', '1:85', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'are', 'extras', 'original', 'dvd', '2001', 'only', 'had', 'trailer', 'extra.Christine', 'movie', 'presented', '2:35', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'are', 'extras', 'be', 'same', 'transfer', 'used', '2004', 'Special', 'Edition', 'dvd', 'Christine', 'SE', 'had', 'bunch', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'three', 'featurettes', '20', 'deleted', 'scenes', '26', 'minutes', 'too', 'bad', 'extras', 'were', ""n't"", 'set', 'were', 'obviously', 'left', 'off', 'make', 'room', 'Blob.Fright', 'Night', 'favorite', 'movie', 'set', 'movie', 'presented', '2:35', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'are', 'extras', 'good', 'way', 'obtain', 'movie', 'original', 'dvd', 'now', 'print', 'same', 'transfer', 'only', 'extra', 'original', 'was', 'trailer.The', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'movie', 'presented', '2:35', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'are', 'extras', 'original', 'dvd', 'was', 'flipper', 'dvd', 'transfer', 'one', 'side', 'pan', 'scan', 'transfer', 'other', 'were', 'extras', 'dvd', 'consider', 'p', 's', 'transfer', 'extra', 'Not', 'even', 'trailer']",The Blob
