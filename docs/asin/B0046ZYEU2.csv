It's also a fun story about American Indians (excuse me, Liberals: to be politically correct, &#34;Native Americans&#34;. although when you told them what to be called, you never asked hem what they preferred to be called, and what they still are...INDIAN!).

But there are those who have a dream and pursue it even when others don't think they are so smart.  I felt really sad when Graham Greene appeared as a veteran but still capable of defending a friend.  Philbert named his brown &#34;pony&#34; car the right name, Protector.  Later the car would go down into a canyon and Philbert was thought to have been killed.  But he came up saying his pony had thrown him.  His pony protected him.To some this would be a funny movie, to others it would seem silly in this modern day.  Not all Indian people are completely assimilated into the &#34;modern days&#34; culture.

1387975,A32EVG7Y33H4RJ,B0046ZYEU2,JazzFeathers,"[0, 0]","I watched the film after having read the book, which is always an interesting experience. In this case, it was particularly interesting because, in many ways, I liked the film better than the book.One of the reasons is that the film is tighter. Where the book is divided into many short episodes peppering the larger story of Philbert and Buddy&#8217;s journey to get Buddy&#8217;s sister out of jail, the film focuses on the main story, trying to make the most sense out of it. And actually, some episodes become clearer in the light of the larger story. Even some changes in the plot and in the characters&#8217; reasons make the story stronger, in my opinion.Where Philbert is basically the same character as in the book - a very naf guy, very trustful, oriented to tradition where he finds his strength and reasons - Buddy is quite a different character. Where in the book he&#8217;s a bitter veteran that doesn&#8217;t believe in anything or anyone anymore, in the film he&#8217;s an activist, that believes in principles even if he doesn&#8217;t believe in people (not even his people) anymore.In a sense, this makes the relationship between the two characters more meaningful for me. It is the same relationship with the same evolution as in the book, at its core, but in the film it becomes sharper because of the sharper contrast between Philbert&#8217;s idealism/trust and Buddy&#8217;s mistrust/activism. The way their outlook on life converged in the evolving of the story takes up more sense, it comes across more effectively in the film, in my opinion.Some episodes are missing from the film, which in a couple cases is a shame. But Jimmy&#8217;s and the veterans&#8217; episode is still there, and I&#8217;m very happy about it. It&#8217;s one of the strongest episodes in the books as well as in the film. It is a very touchy episode with a brilliant Graham Green in the role of Jimmy.",4,Activism and Idealism on the road,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1901,"['watched', 'film', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'always', 'interesting', 'experience', 'case', 'was', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'many', 'ways', 'liked', 'film', 'better', 'book.One', 'reasons', 'film', 'tighter', 'Where', 'book', 'divided', 'many', 'short', 'episodes', 'peppering', 'larger', 'story', 'Philbert', 'Buddy', '8217', 'journey', 'get', 'Buddy', '8217', 'sister', 'jail', 'film', 'main', 'story', 'trying', 'make', 'most', 'sense', 'actually', 'episodes', 'become', 'clearer', 'light', 'larger', 'story', 'Even', 'changes', 'plot', 'characters', '8217', 'reasons', 'make', 'story', 'stronger', 'opinion.Where', 'Philbert', 'basically', 'same', 'character', 'book', 'very', 'naf', 'guy', 'very', 'trustful', 'oriented', 'tradition', 'where', 'strength', 'reasons', 'Buddy', 'quite', 'different', 'character', 'Where', 'book', '8217', 's', 'bitter', 'veteran', 'doesn', '8217', 'believe', 'anything', 'anyone', 'anymore', 'film', '8217', 'activist', 'principles', 'even', '8217', 'believe', 'people', 'not', 'even', 'people', 'anymore.In', 'sense', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters', 'more', 'meaningful', 'same', 'relationship', 'same', 'evolution', 'book', 'core', 'film', 'sharper', 'sharper', 'contrast', 'Philbert', '8217', 'idealism/trust', 'Buddy', '8217', 's', 'mistrust/activism', 'way', 'outlook', 'life', 'converged', 'evolving', 'story', 'up', 'more', 'sense', 'more', 'effectively', 'film', 'opinion.Some', 'episodes', 'are', 'missing', 'film', 'couple', 'cases', 'shame', 'Jimmy', '8217', 's', 'veterans', '8217', 'episode', 'still', 'there', '8217', 'very', 'happy', '8217', 'one', 'strongest', 'episodes', 'books', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'very', 'touchy', 'episode', 'brilliant', 'Graham', 'Green', 'role', 'Jimmy']",N/A

Recognizable from the beginning is Gary Farmer who has a presence in many similar films including Smoke Signals, Skins, Sioux City, and Ghost Dog (not Native American-themed, but there Farmer is). Farmer's character is an amiable, spiritually-driven fellow with a deep appreciation of culture who does not mind smashing a safe if necessary. Hilarious. In contrast to Farmer's laid back character is that of A Martinez, a type-A driven hot-head who loses his temper and knocks down obstacles with determined impatience. The two men join on a road trip to check on a family member. Along the way, both men share their philosophies on how to live the life. While enjoyable, if just for the nostalgia of seeing A Martinez wreck his way across the screen, production values on the other movies named in this review may make the themes come across clearer.

The reasons to watch this film are: good story, good acting, good direction, good teachings, good environmental themes and teaching that we can all find peace and our own path - via connecting to our own spirit, with the help of ancestors, but not necessarily with the help of elders. It's producers are a respectful film company in the UK including former Beatle - George Harrison. This film is very timely with the current Idle NO More movement in Canada, and now the US, bringing attention to continuing treaty rights violations, corporate negotiations for resource rights, environmental protection and the power gathering, dancing and drumming - power of the Pow Wow. I like the stops along the Pow Wow highway at power gathering points, which mirrors the steps along each of our own life's road ... sometimes gathering power, sometimes giving power away.

1387982,AGOVJ0FDL7FZ2,B0046ZYEU2,Ms February,"[1, 13]","First of all, this movie was filmed in the early 80's and it's very obviously dated. But then a lot of very good, enduring movies are also dated. This, however, is not a very good, enduring movie.Where it fails for me is in the screenplay, the directing and the acting. The screenplay seemed to be trying to take the movie through a poorly conceived maze with a director who was unaware of how to put effective story material together and actors who were just trying to get through their lines without screwing up.It seems like they were trying to squeeze too many details into too short of a movie (87 minutes), so none of it comes across convincingly or with any entertainment value. Apart from a couple of performers, the acting is subpar at best and the plot elements seem just strewn together in a poorly thought out manner.There are moments that are touching and rise above the mediocrity of the rest of the film, but not enough to save the film from being dragged down by it's many lessor elements. A significant conflict early in the film is left completely unresolved, and the plot and subplot have very weak development. There is almost no sense of character development, either. The one character that does have a measurable degree of development is very poorly established at the outset of the movie, and his acting is unfortunately one of the weakest performances of all. Perhaps that is why he wasn't given many lines. At the beginning of the movie we meet him in a bar where he sees a cheezy used-car commercial, after which he goes to some glorified junk yard and trades some bourbon and marijuana for a mangled car that he picks out without any forethought, after what appears to be a brief vision of ponies running. There is great opportunity for development and humor here, but it is never adequately explored in the movie. It is just one more plot element that seems to be there, just because.This is a story that had great potential but in my opinion was ultimately undone by too many shortcomings.",1,Dull and ungrounded,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,2019,"['First', 'all', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'early', '80', 'very', 'obviously', 'dated', 'then', 'lot', 'very', 'good', 'enduring', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'dated', 'however', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'enduring', 'movie.Where', 'screenplay', 'directing', 'acting', 'screenplay', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'take', 'movie', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'maze', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'unaware', 'how', 'put', 'effective', 'story', 'material', 'together', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'lines', 'screwing', 'up.It', 'were', 'trying', 'squeeze', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'too', 'short', 'movie', '87', 'minutes', 'none', 'convincingly', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Apart', 'couple', 'performers', 'acting', 'subpar', 'best', 'plot', 'elements', 'seem', 'just', 'strewn', 'together', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'touching', 'rise', 'mediocrity', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'being', 'dragged', 'down', 'many', 'lessor', 'elements', 'significant', 'conflict', 'early', 'film', 'left', 'completely', 'unresolved', 'plot', 'subplot', 'have', 'very', 'weak', 'development', 'almost', 'sense', 'character', 'development', 'either', 'one', 'character', 'have', 'measurable', 'degree', 'development', 'very', 'poorly', 'established', 'outset', 'movie', 'acting', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'weakest', 'performances', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'many', 'lines', 'beginning', 'movie', 'meet', 'bar', 'where', 'cheezy', 'used-car', 'commercial', 'glorified', 'junk', 'yard', 'bourbon', 'marijuana', 'mangled', 'car', 'out', 'forethought', 'what', 'be', 'brief', 'vision', 'ponies', 'running', 'great', 'opportunity', 'development', 'humor', 'here', 'never', 'adequately', 'explored', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'plot', 'element', 'be', 'there', 'just', 'because.This', 'story', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'opinion', 'was', 'ultimately', 'undone', 'too', 'many', 'shortcomings']",N/A
