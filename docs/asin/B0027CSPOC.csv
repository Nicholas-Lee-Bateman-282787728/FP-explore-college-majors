Instead of a normal 'Special Edition' box set that my have one extra item. This comes with papers that makes you feel like you were actually just brought into the DHARMA initiative. It comes in a white 3 ring binder which automatically had me jumping. Everything inside makes you feel like you were about to start your new job. The DVD's themselves come in very nice plastic holders ,although, I don't know about their choice of paper covers instead of actual cardboard covers. One of mine were rather crinkled and bent (I might talk to amazon about exchanging it but I don't know yet). I am one of the crazed fans who refuses to open the back of the envelope so I can't say much about that.My only concern and complaint is after spending all this money- they chose to have a patch be very specific to certain kits. I didn't get the patch but it bugged me to think that they would make it seem like we will run out and buy another kit and to think that those kits (because they were in short supply) will end up being worth more than the none extra patch kit bugs me too.Like I said though, GET IT IF YOU ARE A LOST FAN!

1254006,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B0027CSPOC,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[11, 26]","This set is designed to steal the money of people who are dedicated to the show. Everything about the packaging amounts to the most cynical sort of explotation.What do you get for all the money:(1) A song thats been available on itunes for months.(2) A VHS tape containing an amaturish reworked version of a orientation film already seen in the show. Why do I want to go find a VCR to watch something I've mostly already seen and which adds absolutely NOTHING to what was already seen. Its not important. Its not entertaining.(3) A bunch of printed extras full of bad jokes and without any interesting content. There is only one exception. There is a truce document included that is the kind of content people want. But it requires that the packaging be damaged to look at it.(4) A bunch of patches. And they cared *so much* that some packages have an extra patch (the submarine). When your down to putting bonus items in something this expensive, its just tacky.(5) Its nonstandard size. It doesn't fit on shelves and it doesn't fit into most DVD collections.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who actually wanted to watch the season. This is strictly a rare collectors item that you never open and put somewhere for a few years in the hope that it increases in value.

1254009,A3HF7ZSF6FL92Q,B0027CSPOC,Stuart Donna,"[1, 2]",As I read through these reviews I was kind of surprised by some of them. If you are a fan of the show I don't understand why you wouldn't love this. I don't think the price is bad for this what you get. I paid under 80 bucks and that including taxes and shipping. I like the packaging its fun and its got me pumped for the final season to start. I guess they could have done something more expensive and maybe used a hardwood case instead of the cardboard box that the folder comes.  And maybe they could have used the more traditional DVD holder case that houses all the DVD's together like they did for the past season's offering. I have to say I like the DVD holders in this set. I like how they look like old floppy discs from the early 80's. Sure they are made of paper but if they would have made the kit nicer it probably would have cost a lot more and I most likely wouldn't have been able to afford it. So I think it was nice that they offered up a nice collectable for under 80 buck. If you're not sure if you want this collectors edition all I can say is for me it is worth the money but you can still just get the normal season 5 DVD release if you disagree.,5,I love it,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,1170,"['read', 'reviews', 'was', 'kind', 'surprised', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'price', 'bad', 'what', 'get', 'paid', '80', 'bucks', 'including', 'taxes', 'shipping', 'packaging', 'fun', 'got', 'pumped', 'final', 'season', 'start', 'guess', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'more', 'expensive', 'maybe', 'used', 'hardwood', 'case', 'instead', 'cardboard', 'box', 'folder', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'traditional', 'DVD', 'holder', 'case', 'houses', 'DVD', 'together', 'did', 'past', 'season', 'offering', 'have', 'say', 'DVD', 'holders', 'set', 'like', 'how', 'look', 'old', 'floppy', 'discs', 'early', '80', 'Sure', 'are', 'made', 'paper', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'kit', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'cost', 'lot', 'more', 'most', 'likely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'afford', 'So', 'think', 'was', 'nice', 'offered', 'up', 'nice', 'collectable', '80', 'buck', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'want', 'collectors', 'edition', 'can', 'say', 'money', 'can', 'still', 'just', 'get', 'normal', 'season', '5', 'DVD', 'release', 'disagree']",N/A
