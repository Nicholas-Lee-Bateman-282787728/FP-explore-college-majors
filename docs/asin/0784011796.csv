It is a masterpiece in control, and a director's ability to create mood - in the true spirit of independent cinema style, in display with all it glory (and gratuitousness).* Mise-en-scene: The figure behavior of Max Cohen appealed to me - strange, erratic and inconsistent - it furthered the narrative to establish a man truly on the edge.* While I did not feel personally for Cohen's character, I enjoyed being a voyeur and following his track to see where he would end up.  My goal was very narrative driven and I don't think the director's aim was for us to empathize with the character - it was more to get us interested in him -which we do quite acutely.* I did not particularly care for the gangster angle, but I guess it was important to keep the less-artsy crowd hooked on and to drive the narrative forward in a linear fashion.* Cinematography: The mood was built both by the choice of wide angled lenses used at very close distances to distort the images and give the `crazy world' feel. Camera height is used effectively to convey an impending feeling of something waiting to happen or lurking around the corner.* Sound &amp; Editing: The director's total skill and control on these two stylistic elements is what makes this film an imperfect masterpiece. I so enjoyed the complimenting of the sound bridges to give the impending feeling of foreboding. Yet the sound was hip and a departure from earlier noir works where it created only mood. The editing was totally maverick and the mixing of superimpositions with quick and flash cuts gave a more music-video feel which was fast and slick - thoroughly enjoyable in the end.",5,Vintage Noir with the Hip Hop Twist,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,1844,"['PI', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', '1ST', 'Feature', 'Film', '/', 'U.S.', '1998', '4', 'STARS', 'November', '2003', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'film', 'symbolic', 'Film', 'Noir', '50', 'Touch', 'Evil', 'Trial', 'more', 'technically', 'savvy', 'masterpiece', 'control', 'director', 'ability', 'create', 'mood', 'true', 'spirit', 'independent', 'cinema', 'style', 'display', 'glory', 'gratuitousness', '*', 'Mise-en-scene', 'figure', 'behavior', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'appealed', 'strange', 'erratic', 'inconsistent', 'furthered', 'narrative', 'establish', 'man', 'truly', 'edge', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'personally', 'Cohen', 'character', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'voyeur', 'following', 'track', 'see', 'where', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'goal', 'was', 'very', 'narrative', 'driven', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'director', 'aim', 'was', 'empathize', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'get', 'interested', '-which', 'do', 'quite', 'acutely', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'care', 'gangster', 'angle', 'guess', 'was', 'important', 'keep', 'less-artsy', 'crowd', 'hooked', 'drive', 'narrative', 'forward', 'linear', 'fashion', '*', 'Cinematography', 'mood', 'was', 'built', 'choice', 'wide', 'angled', 'lenses', 'used', 'very', 'close', 'distances', 'distort', 'images', 'give', 'crazy', 'world', 'feel', 'Camera', 'height', 'used', 'effectively', 'convey', 'impending', 'feeling', 'something', 'waiting', 'happen', 'lurking', 'corner', '*', 'Sound', 'amp', 'Editing', 'director', 'total', 'skill', 'control', 'two', 'stylistic', 'elements', 'what', 'film', 'imperfect', 'masterpiece', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'complimenting', 'sound', 'give', 'impending', 'feeling', 'foreboding', 'sound', 'was', 'hip', 'departure', 'earlier', 'noir', 'where', 'created', 'only', 'mood', 'editing', 'was', 'totally', 'maverick', 'mixing', 'superimpositions', 'quick', 'flash', 'cuts', 'gave', 'more', 'music-video', 'feel', 'was', 'fast', 'slick', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'end']",N/A
76319,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,0784011796,A Customer,"[1, 8]","Summary:Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a brilliant mathematician who is trying to predict stock values using his mathematical wizardry.  He has turned his apartment into a giant computer and spends every waking hour working on mathematical problems.  When approached by a fellow Jew involved with Cabalah, Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman), Max learns about the existence of a 216 digit number that is supposed to hold the key to, well, everything - including stock values and the true name of God spoken by the ancient high priests of Israel.  Consulting with his mentor, Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), Max is informed that it might exist, but Sol also warns him that once he fixates on a specific number he will begin to see it everywhere.It's not clear whether Max takes his advice or not, but Max seems to solve what the number is, only to be attacked by a number of people that want the number.  Eventually he is able to escape from all of these attacks only to succumb to his own insanity.My Comments:Two friends highly recommended this movie.  As was the case with Donnie Darko, it was described as a 'mind trip'.  And, as was the case with Donnie Darko, I think this movie fails to fully realize its potential.  Yes, the idea that pretty much everything in the universe can be represented mathematically is cool.  Also cool is the idea that perhaps there is a single number that holds the key to unraveling all of the mysteries of the universe.  But the story used to explore this idea just doesn't cut it.The story isn't necessarily full of holes, it just doesn't make much sense.  The biggest problem is Max's headaches, if that's what they really are.  I'm guessing they are supposed to be hyper-severe migraines that result in him hallucinating at times.  Max also seems to be somewhat paranoid, though his paranoia seems to be somewhat based in reality.  In the end, the headaches just turn into an excuse to kill Max off without actually dealing with what the consequences would have been if someone had actually discovered the 'almighty number' that solves everything.  It was really disappointing and much shallower than I think most people want to believe.  Yes, it had potential, but all of that potential rested in Max actually doing something with the information he discovered.  Instead, Max takes a drill to his head and kills himself.  Whoopee.I'm sure defenders of the movie will turn around and say, &quot;But consider the budget.  They really couldn't do much beyond what they did.&quot;  Well, that's probably true.  But if they had a better story, they could have gotten a better budget.As for the acting, Sean Gullette was pretty good.  Once again, the big problem here is the headaches.  Even though Sean Gullette plays a convincing, introverted mathematician, I don't think even he really knew what to do with the headaches.  They don't seem to have a basis in reality (i.e., no one has ever had anything like this before), which make them hard to portray convincingly.  So, yes, Sean's performance was pretty good, but considering the story didn't make a lot of sense, he didn't have much to work with.  The rest of the cast was for the most part bearable, with the exception of Pamela Hart (Marcy Dawson from Lancet Percy).  I'm guessing she only has minimal experience acting, because she didn't seem to be doing it in this movie.Overall, the concept was cool, but the delivery was wanting.  The incorporation of the migraines, if that's what they were, was a copout for a story that wasn't going anywhere.  Whether this was because of a non-existent budget or a bad story doesn't matter to me.  Perhaps I was expecting a real 'mind trip', but what I got was just a dull, throbbing in my temporal lobe.  Not recommended.",3,The math fixation is cool; but the movie falls short,1068854400,"11 15, 2003",2003,3751,"['Summary', 'Maximillian', 'Cohen', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'brilliant', 'mathematician', 'who', 'trying', 'predict', 'stock', 'values', 'using', 'mathematical', 'wizardry', 'turned', 'apartment', 'giant', 'computer', 'waking', 'hour', 'working', 'mathematical', 'problems', 'When', 'approached', 'fellow', 'Jew', 'involved', 'Cabalah', 'Lenny', 'Meyer', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'Max', 'existence', '216', 'digit', 'number', 'supposed', 'hold', 'key', 'well', 'everything', 'including', 'stock', 'values', 'true', 'name', 'God', 'spoken', 'ancient', 'high', 'priests', 'Israel', 'Consulting', 'mentor', 'Sol', 'Robeson', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'Max', 'informed', 'might', 'exist', 'Sol', 'also', 'once', 'specific', 'number', 'will', 'begin', 'see', 'everywhere.It', 'not', 'clear', 'Max', 'advice', 'not', 'Max', 'solve', 'what', 'number', 'only', 'be', 'attacked', 'number', 'people', 'want', 'number', 'Eventually', 'able', 'escape', 'attacks', 'only', 'succumb', 'own', 'insanity.My', 'Comments', 'Two', 'friends', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie', 'was', 'case', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'was', 'described', ""'mind"", 'trip', 'was', 'case', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'think', 'movie', 'fully', 'realize', 'potential', 'Yes', 'idea', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'universe', 'can', 'be', 'represented', 'mathematically', 'cool', 'Also', 'cool', 'idea', 'perhaps', 'single', 'number', 'key', 'unraveling', 'mysteries', 'universe', 'story', 'used', 'explore', 'idea', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'it.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'full', 'holes', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Max', 'headaches', 'what', 'really', 'are', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'hyper-severe', 'migraines', 'result', 'hallucinating', 'times', 'Max', 'also', 'be', 'somewhat', 'paranoid', 'paranoia', 'be', 'somewhat', 'based', 'reality', 'end', 'headaches', 'just', 'turn', 'excuse', 'kill', 'Max', 'actually', 'dealing', 'what', 'consequences', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'someone', 'had', 'actually', 'discovered', ""'almighty"", 'number', 'everything', 'was', 'really', 'disappointing', 'much', 'shallower', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'believe', 'Yes', 'had', 'potential', 'potential', 'rested', 'Max', 'actually', 'doing', 'something', 'information', 'discovered', 'Instead', 'Max', 'drill', 'head', 'Whoopee.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'defenders', 'movie', 'will', 'turn', 'around', 'say', 'quot', 'consider', 'budget', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'what', 'did.', 'quot', 'Well', 'probably', 'true', 'had', 'better', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'budget.As', 'acting', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Once', 'again', 'big', 'problem', 'here', 'headaches', 'Even', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'convincing', 'introverted', 'mathematician', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'really', 'knew', 'what', 'do', 'headaches', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'basis', 'reality', 'i.e.', 'one', 'ever', 'had', 'anything', 'before', 'make', 'hard', 'portray', 'convincingly', 'So', 'yes', 'Sean', 'performance', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'bearable', 'exception', 'Pamela', 'Hart', 'Marcy', 'Dawson', 'Lancet', 'Percy', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'only', 'minimal', 'experience', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'doing', 'movie.Overall', 'concept', 'was', 'cool', 'delivery', 'was', 'wanting', 'incorporation', 'migraines', 'what', 'were', 'was', 'copout', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'was', 'non-existent', 'budget', 'bad', 'story', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'expecting', 'real', 'trip', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'just', 'dull', 'throbbing', 'temporal', 'lobe', 'Not', 'recommended']",N/A

76324,AF1VHA7BVWLO1,0784011796,Alexia Komaux,"[2, 3]","Darren Aronofsky could be called a film genius. Requiem for a Dream is considered to be one of the best movies of recent memory (and, from what I saw of it, I can agree), and has many of the same techniques as his previous film, Pi. Pi is one of those movies that you need to see many times in order to have everything sink in, but you don't really want to see it again. The images stick in your head, and it's a subconsciously terrifying experience.Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius. He analyzes numbers, and soon recognizes a pattern in the stock market. But that doesn't satisfy him. He keeps on going, as people want to use his mathematical abilities for their own selfish reasons. Max struggles with his various mental and physiological problems as he's working with this-so much that if you watch it once you can't distinguish between reality and Max's mind.Aronofsky makes this movie on parking meter money (less than $10,000), yet it's one of the most stylish movies of recent memory. Shot in black/white (there is barely any grey) with a type of vision that leaves edges to the imagination, Pi works in its own little world. With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works. The theories that the movie puts in your head are complete bull-honky, but they're presented in a way that you can't help believing.Well acted all around, especially by Guellette, Pi is not for everyone. There's many disturbing moments, involving brains and power tools. The second-to-last scene, just so you know, was actually done, no special effects. Overall, Pi is a very good, trippy movie that's not for everyone.

Second, this film meets one of my personal criteria for a very good to great film in that it offers filmmakers / photographers good content to dig into, admire and learn from. Shot in black and white, the film has a certain 1960's-frenzied cheez-sci-fi style (maybe it was the weird, buzzing ambient score?) to it, but not to such a degree that it gets in the way. The cinematography actually reminded me of some segments from &quot;Fight Club&quot;, believe it or not. Other reviewers either liked or were turned off by the pseudo-math that supports the plot - one man's search for underlying order in a chaotic, apparently random universe. Simply put, one cannot tell if this search is a schizophrenic episode or the result of a man's mind trying to comprehend something it was not designed to. They missed the simple fact that this ambiguity drives the whole plot. Sean Gullette never gives us a clue as to whether he's a genius or an annoying axe-grinder convinced that JFK was assassinated by the Moonies / &quot;Blue Blockers&quot; are a government mind-control device / there is an underlying, absolute, predictable order to the universe. Okay, just #3, but still... Gullette's performance, especially in &quot;wing nut&quot; mode, is great. By the end, he's shaved his head and recollects the best of Robert DeNiro in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; in his intensity, although his character is not required to jump off a personal cliff quite so high as DeNiro's. Like all great films, this one leaves audiences with more questions than answers. As an added benefit, the math, while simple, is presented in such a way that anyone could see what might compel a person to spend their lives studying abstract number theory. The only thing that keeps me from giving 4-5 stars is that this film is work to watch - it is NOT &quot;entertainment&quot; per se, and people shopping for &quot;entertainment&quot; tend to focus on &quot;# stars (x out of y)&quot; as criteria.

It's a wakeup call for people like me, who are sick and tired of the same old recycled Hollywood flicks that desperately  attempt to make money with big stars and special effects, and no plot.  I  liked it for that reason.  The other reason is that with each viewing of  it, something new is uncovered.  It's really well wrought.  The grainy,  16mm camerawork gives it an eerie, paranoid feel to it.  I also think it  gives the film it's artistic qualities.  There are still scenes in this  film that totally leave me stuck, although I was able to comprehend some of  the more bizarre hallucinatory sequences after watching them more than  once.  As for this DVD, it's very nice.  I don't think that the picture  quality will look much different from the tape, except in sharpness and an  absence of tape wrinkles.  Also, I hate to say, that the DVD format is the  only place that &quot;Pi&quot; is available for purchase.  The tape is over  $100, and the chances of getting it on laserdisc are unlikely.

If a psychological struggle has no basis in reality, it ceases to become a struggle and just becomes some fiction perpetrated on the world by a hack. There is supposedly a psychological struggle in Pi, but it is so far-fetched and fabricated that its basis in reality is tenuous at best. Max Cohen is a genius (how?) who studies number theory (why?) to make a Great Discovery of some kind. We're not too clear on the details of this, obviously, because Darren Aronofsky is a pretentious filmmaker and not a scientist, and thus cannot give us any details that range beyond ""extremely shallow."" But that's okay, since the point isn't the plot - the point is all the meaningless fluff Aronofsky throws on to mask the incompetent lack of a plot. Thus, we get absolutely random shots of a pulsating brain (representing, like, his emotional stress or something, man), a smattering of Jewish mysticism (with no information that couldn't be discovered in a five-minute Internet search, mind you - wouldn't want our film to have substance, here), Oriental philosophy (a Go board! how deep!), a techno soundtrack (how edgy!), a ponderous script rife with weighty one-liners, overacting, and best of all, grainy black and white.So Aronofsky is big on style. Maybe he'd be a half-decent cinematographer, although his ""innovative camera angles"" strike me as soulless and banal. But he is not a cinematographer; he is a director, and one who thinks he's an artist, no less. And I'm sure he'd say I just didn't understaaand his film. Oh, but I do understand - I understand that this film banks manipulatively on the fact that most people know just about as much about mathematics, mysticism or psychology as its creator, and thus would harp upon the ""depth"" of these things just because they were included. Pi is not the story of a man sliding into insanity, it is the story of what an arrogant, Harvard-graduated director thinks a man sliding into insanity is like, complete with a whole arbitrarily assembled collage of previously used ""symbols"" that he thought were cool when he first saw them, and a veneer of Philosophy Lite - all the clever words and cool concepts without the whole profundity thing.

This is a film for fans of David Lynch's early work, or for low-budget, twisted, ingenious neo-noir, psychological thrillers such as Christopher Nolan'sFollowingor Lynch'sEraserhead. Often Kafkesque in its strange but endlessly fascinating subject matter, and so smart and mind-blowing it will give you migraines, Pi represents a stunning debut by Darren Aronofsky, later to be famous for films such as Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, and Black Swan.Pi was made on a shoestring budget of $60,000, shot on cheap high-reversal black-and-white film, starring many actors known personally to Aronofsky, who also wrote the screenplay and the story, produced, and directed the film. It further marks the first of several profitable collaborations between actorMark Margolisand composerClint Mansell, whose dark, edgy score brilliantly fits the disturbing, claustrophobic, cerebral tone of the film.Pi encompasses themes such as numbers, patterns, the Torah, algorithms, codes, secret languages, obsession, paranoia, fear, self-destruction, and the dangers of knowledge; in short, all my favourite themes. In a world where most thrillers have buff heroes running from huge explosions or punching/shooting each other for half the running time, it is comforting to know films like Pi exist; smartly written, quietly tense, effectively acted, low-budget films for a smart, thinking audience.We need more films like 3.141592653589793238462...I could go on.

This film is far more cohesive and straightforward and grounded in reality, although the main character apparently becomes increasingly neurotic as the film progresses.Basically it is about a respected young mathematician with the social skills of your average hermit trying to develope a method of predicting the stock market on his homemade computer. Meanwhile an evil group (brokerage company, CIA, whatever ... their identity is not really revealed) keeps him under surveillance and tries to get him to make a Faustian deal to reveal any formula he developes to them.  Eventually he reaches a breakthrough when he becomes interested in the mystical Jewish philosophy of Kabbalah and finds parallels between it and mathematical theory.  As a result his understanding of math becomes increasingly philosophical, and he begins to note patterns in everything, learns how to predict the market and winds up being pursued by the unidentified group as well as zealous Kabbalists who all want to use him.  He also, perhaps, winds up learning to communicate with God (or else he goes insane)(or both).  This last bit of confusion is not because the movie is confusing, but because it cleverly leaves some events open to several equally supportable interpretations.Don't worry if you're not really into math or the Kabbalah, Pi is still very entertaining.  It has excellent acting and great photography (despite the obviously low budget).  But if you are into such things, the movie also does manage to make excellent parallels between theoretical mathematics and Kabbalah (however you want to spell it) while presenting both accurately, and is mind expanding and thought provoking.  Pi reflects an increasingly strong trend amongst theorists of finding parallels between pure science and mysticism (e.g. quantum physics and zen buddhism) whatever significance you might want to read into that.  My only problem with the movie is its title: the concept of Pi is not actually discussed!

76354,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,0784011796,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","This is a stunning movie by Darren Aronofsky with a unique vision, but it is not for everyone. Shot in sharp, grainy, bold black and white, it is the story of an obsessed mathematics whiz named Max who might be more than slightly mad: he triple locks himself in his apartment, avoids people like they're infectious and works continually upon a complex self-made computer named EUCLID in order to unlock secret patterns in the universe. He knows this order exists, though his only real friend and mentor Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis) insists it doesn't. Max, however, sees it all around him: in the newspaper, in art, in the swirls of cream in his coffee -- the only problem is he isn't sure what it will look like when it comes.  He certainly doesn't think it will look like this long tangle of numbers his computer spits out, even one 216 numbers long.An unfortunate sign he's on to something, however, is that people will not leave him alone. They're following him, constantly, and the tension is driving him mad...his migraines seem to slice into his brain. If he's lucky, he just blacks out after a few agonizing minutes. But lately he's been seeing things: dark visions of bleeding men and dark, angry people, leering faces, and he's also hearing horrible, discordant noises that batter him from within. Those trying to cling to him believe he is onto something - while some market traders have indeed been tracking him in the hope that Max will make them rich, some Kabballistic Jews are on his tail in their belief he may just be able to help them discover the true name of God...a 216-number sequence.It bears mentioning that I have seen, and admired, two previous Aronofsky movies -The WrestlerandBlack Swan- which I thought were terrific.  Some years earlier I had quit watching one -The Fountain- which I felt was interminably dull. Yet I found PI to be enthralling; I began it an hour before midnight after a long day and told myself I would just get a taste of it and turn it off when I was tired - yet the first moment I even thought of what time it was occurred about seven minutes before the credits rolled. I had been thatenthralled.What is accomplished most successfully here is Sean Gullette's portrayal of Max with all his ""frayed edges,"" a man whose bright, facile mind fuels his pyrotechnic manias, and it is indicative of Aronofsky's skilled direction that we often feel we are seeing the world through his eyes. This presents, of course, its own problem: as anyone who has taken a literature course knows, Crazy Man = Unreliable Narrator. But we have enough to go on here to realize that it doesn't particularly matter if EVERYTHING Max is relating to us via his narration is true; the story as I have related it to you is enough to carry the day. Max is brilliant; his computer program is inspired, and he is an untapped source others want to use to their own ends.Another note: cinematographer Matthew Libatique deserves a great deal of credit...the stark contrasts and almost overdeveloped film are symbolic of his rigid view and his anger at those in his way, as well as the fact that for him, the ""answers"" are, indeed, black and white...clear...like math. Likewise, credit should also go to Clint Mansell, who put together the musical score - it's full of strident, chaotic electronic music, IDM and hip hop that thump and jar and epitomize the jangling paranoia and rage and tension evident continually.Of importance, too, is the fact that the ending is satisfying. Aronofsky settles the issue, and the movie will present a resolution. Like Max, we the audience get to come to a place where there is an understanding.(A NOTE: if you give a negative review, please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)",4,Order in Chaos/Chaos in Order,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,3741,"['stunning', 'movie', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'unique', 'vision', 'not', 'everyone', 'Shot', 'sharp', 'grainy', 'bold', 'black', 'white', 'story', 'obsessed', 'mathematics', 'whiz', 'named', 'Max', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'slightly', 'mad', 'locks', 'apartment', 'avoids', 'people', ""'re"", 'infectious', 'continually', 'complex', 'self-made', 'computer', 'named', 'EUCLID', 'order', 'unlock', 'secret', 'patterns', 'universe', 'order', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'mentor', 'Sol', 'Robeson', 'Mark', 'Margolis', ""n't"", 'Max', 'however', 'newspaper', 'art', 'swirls', 'cream', 'coffee', 'only', 'problem', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'will', 'look', 'when', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'look', 'long', 'tangle', 'numbers', 'computer', 'out', 'even', 'one', '216', 'numbers', 'long.An', 'unfortunate', 'sign', 'something', 'however', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'alone', ""'re"", 'following', 'constantly', 'tension', 'driving', 'mad', 'migraines', 'seem', 'slice', 'brain', 'lucky', 'just', 'out', 'few', 'agonizing', 'minutes', 'lately', 'been', 'seeing', 'things', 'dark', 'visions', 'bleeding', 'men', 'dark', 'angry', 'people', 'leering', 'also', 'hearing', 'horrible', 'discordant', 'noises', 'batter', 'trying', 'cling', 'believe', 'something', 'market', 'traders', 'have', 'indeed', 'been', 'tracking', 'hope', 'Max', 'will', 'make', 'rich', 'Kabballistic', 'Jews', 'are', 'tail', 'belief', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'discover', 'true', 'name', 'God', '216-number', 'sequence.It', 'bears', 'mentioning', 'have', 'seen', 'admired', 'two', 'previous', 'Aronofsky', 'movies', '-The', 'WrestlerandBlack', 'Swan-', 'thought', 'were', 'terrific', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'quit', 'watching', 'one', '-The', 'Fountain-', 'felt', 'was', 'interminably', 'dull', 'found', 'PI', 'be', 'enthralling', 'began', 'hour', 'midnight', 'long', 'day', 'told', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'taste', 'turn', 'off', 'when', 'was', 'tired', 'yet', 'first', 'moment', 'even', 'thought', 'what', 'time', 'was', 'occurred', 'seven', 'minutes', 'credits', 'rolled', 'had', 'been', 'thatenthralled.What', 'accomplished', 'most', 'successfully', 'here', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'portrayal', 'Max', 'frayed', 'edges', 'man', 'bright', 'facile', 'mind', 'fuels', 'pyrotechnic', 'manias', 'indicative', 'Aronofsky', 'skilled', 'direction', 'often', 'feel', 'are', 'seeing', 'world', 'eyes', 'course', 'own', 'problem', 'anyone', 'who', 'taken', 'literature', 'course', 'knows', 'Crazy', 'Man', '=', 'Unreliable', 'Narrator', 'have', 'enough', 'go', 'here', 'realize', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'matter', 'EVERYTHING', 'Max', 'relating', 'narration', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'related', 'enough', 'carry', 'day', 'Max', 'brilliant', 'computer', 'program', 'inspired', 'untapped', 'source', 'others', 'want', 'use', 'own', 'ends.Another', 'note', 'cinematographer', 'Matthew', 'Libatique', 'great', 'deal', 'credit', 'stark', 'contrasts', 'almost', 'overdeveloped', 'film', 'are', 'symbolic', 'rigid', 'view', 'anger', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'answers', 'are', 'indeed', 'black', 'white', 'clear', 'math', 'Likewise', 'credit', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'musical', 'score', 'full', 'strident', 'chaotic', 'electronic', 'music', 'IDM', 'hip', 'hop', 'thump', 'jar', 'epitomize', 'jangling', 'paranoia', 'rage', 'tension', 'evident', 'continually.Of', 'importance', 'too', 'fact', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'Aronofsky', 'issue', 'movie', 'will', 'present', 'resolution', 'Max', 'audience', 'get', 'come', 'place', 'where', 'understanding', 'NOTE', 'give', 'negative', 'review', 'please', 'leave', 'comment', 'help', 'do', 'better', 'next', 'time']",N/A

76357,A3UYDJLYVS6GQX,0784011796,"C. A. Lemley ""Cal""","[5, 19]","When a movie producer in 1998 foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain-black, white and jittery gray, the result had better be good. That fraction of members of the technicolor-drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money, push Play alongside Mr. Benefit-Of-A-Doubt and strain to see if it works. Thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically, that of color. The problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that, despite some grand intention, DO NOT WORK, or, in the alternative, DO NOT WORK AS WELL. Citing two examples - SIN CITY which is near-tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white, tantamount to robbery, and GOOD NIGHT AMERICA which is all and about the same. The dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together, there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one's mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one's point, one might be better served as a charcoal artist. Color is the medium of life. From a budgetary perspective, black and white films save money as the 'challenges' of color, which, in a good feature, can be excessive, are thus eliminated. Yet complications arise - for instance - I wasn't sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy's hand. Similarly, the entire cast in SIN CITY could have been wearing hot pink, in shades of course, and we would never know. Yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie - or is it? One wonders, however, that, if PI production would have had more money, would they have opted for color? Moot point. It's done.Notwithstanding the obvious that I don't prefer black and white movies and incidentally don't know lots of people who do, PI, although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work, clever symbolism and high-octane guts, seems to lanquish for other reasons. Despite PI's visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot-wired throughout, spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves, after Max's third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost. As as result, the movie stays earthbound, weighted down by a mediocre revolving-door plotline (obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind), unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there, failing repetitive effect and thin, uninspiring 2-D support cast, leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay. Unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad-hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive. Despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn't won. The themes inspiring PI have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine - airborne one second, belly down the next. As a fine creative exercise, the creators are praised for their effort and bravery - PI is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush-hour traffic and commands the watcher's attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in.

There is a lady from Wall Street, Marcy Dawson (Pamela Hart), all sweet talk, but she doesn't care about him--just wants to get at what's in his head.-----------------------Maximillian Cohen: I'm trying to understand our world. I don't deal with petty materialists like you.====================The Kaballah scholars aren't much better. Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman) tries to befriend him in a coffee shop, but who's to say he wasn't sent by the rabbi to win him over? They are trying to unravel the mystery of the Torah and are searching for a 216 digit number that Max may have discovered. It could be the name of God. Who does Max think he is? If he has the number he was only a vessel with a delivery meant for them. He is unworthy, and isn't pure enough to receive it. That might explain the headaches.-----------------------Maximillian Cohen: It was given to me. It's inside of me. It's changing me.Ephraim: It's killing you, because you are not ready to receive it.====================Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), another mathematician who was working with Max on a project involving Pi, has good advice to offer him, but he is getting old, and wants to abandon the search. Sol has a Russian accent and though it is never spoken, has number tattoos on his wrist that indicate he may have spent time in prison--perhaps in Siberia? Max grows increasingly paranoid and obsessed with his search. Sol tries to console him, telling him that even Archimedes had to take a bath before he could proclaim ""Eureka!""-----------------------Sol Robeson: This is insanity, Max.Maximillian Cohen: Or maybe it's genius.====================Then there is Jenna (Kristyn Mae-Anne Lao). She has no ulterior motive--no hidden agenda. She is a kid who just likes to play with her calculator and is fascinated by how Max can instantly solve any equation she gives him in his head. At one point Jenna asks Max for the result of the division of 748 by 238. This simplifies to the fraction 22/7, the result is 3.1428 which is a good approximation of pi often taught in primary schools--accurate to three digits.Though Jenna and Sol offer him some solace, he mostly puts his faith in math:-----------------------Maximillian Cohen: 11:15, restate my assumptions:1. Mathematics is the language of nature.2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers.3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge.Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.====================On the other hand, the number Max is searching for is 216 digits long. 216 is 6x6x6; 666 is the ""number of the beast"" according to the Book of Revelation. The black and white photography, shot high contrast, and Max's headaches, paranoia, and obsession create an atmosphere not unlike David Lynch's Eraserhead, but in this case Max is holding the eraser and standing before a blackboard of feverish calculations. Another film to compare and contrast Pi with is The Number 23,  directed by Joel Schumacher; starring Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen. Though The Number 23 is quite different than Pi, both films share an obsessive, mystical fascination with numbers.-----------------------Maximillian Cohen: When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun, so when I was six I did...====================13:07, restate my assumptions:1. Darren Aronofsky wrote and directed Pi and then went on to direct The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, and Black Swan.2. Pi was shot in black and white on a budget of $60,000, raised mostly from individual contributions from family and friends of $100 each.3. Cohen means priest in Hebrew and most people with this last name could theoretically trace their lineage all the way back to Levi, one of the 12 tribes of Israel. Their similar DNA shows that Cohens are Levites, the priestly cast.4. A large part of what makes Pi a fascinating film is the fascination of numbers themselves. Fractals, the Fibonacci Sequence, the search for a pattern in Pi, patterns in nature, or the stock market... There is even a search by Kaballah scholars for a 216 digit number that could be the name of God, the key to the universe...Therefore: The Bottom Line is that Pi is an intriguing film by a talented director that will be enjoyed by people who like to have their thoughts stimulated while they are being entertained.-----------------------Maximillian Cohen: Something's going on.

Directed by Darren Aronofsky, the hyper-kinetic pacing and surreal black and white imagery forced their way off the screen and into my mind.  While some may call this an 'artsy' film, others may be intrigued and drawn into this interesting, yet slightly flawed, film.The story centers around Max Cohen (Sean Gullette), a reclusive mathematician who sees the world mainly as numbers, and who has one of the creepier apartments I've ever seen.  Everything can be broken down into mathematic formulas and equations to be deciphered and understood.  His work up until this point has been to try and discern the pattern within the stock market, to determine order within the structured chaos of the financial world.  As he gets closer to the ultimate answer, outside forces that want to use his knowledge for their own purposes close in and try to persuade him to their will.  Internal forces also come into play, as the closer Max gets to the answer, them more he finds a sort of madness setting in...does he crack the code?  What answers lie behind the numbers everyone wants?Here is a very intriguing film that may not be for everyone.  The black and white imagery is fast paced, and the music almost a constant throbbing in your ear, providing the viewer a mere glimpse of the madness that begins to envelope the main character.  Some of the scenes reminded me much of David Lynch's Eraserhead (1977), which may still be available on DVD at Lynch's website, but this film did not rely on the viewer to wallow around in the mire of artistic ambiguity to try and decode what was happening on the screen.  Some of the scenes harsh, but the representation was pretty clear, although hard to take at times as the symbolism was laid on a bit thick at times.  A certain amount was left to the viewers' own interpretation, but I think that ultimately fell within the scope of the story.There are quite a bit of special features including commentary tracks that may help to shed light on some of the more curious aspects of the film, lost scenes (aren't they really deleted scenes?  I mean 'lost' means not found, and yet, here they are), production notes, cast and crew information, a music video, and some trailers.Cookieman108",4,3.1415926535897932384626433832795,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,2324,"['Pi', '1998', 'disturbing', 'little', 'movie', 'found', 'entirely', 'annoying', 'same', 'time', 'interesting', 'Directed', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'hyper-kinetic', 'pacing', 'surreal', 'black', 'white', 'imagery', 'forced', 'way', 'screen', 'mind', 'may', 'call', ""'artsy"", 'film', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'intrigued', 'drawn', 'interesting', 'yet', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'film.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'reclusive', 'mathematician', 'who', 'world', 'mainly', 'numbers', 'who', 'one', 'creepier', 'apartments', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Everything', 'can', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'mathematic', 'formulas', 'equations', 'be', 'deciphered', 'understood', 'work', 'up', 'point', 'been', 'try', 'discern', 'pattern', 'stock', 'market', 'determine', 'order', 'structured', 'chaos', 'financial', 'world', 'closer', 'ultimate', 'answer', 'outside', 'forces', 'want', 'use', 'knowledge', 'own', 'purposes', 'close', 'try', 'persuade', 'will', 'Internal', 'forces', 'also', 'come', 'play', 'closer', 'Max', 'answer', 'more', 'sort', 'madness', 'setting', 'crack', 'code', 'What', 'lie', 'numbers', 'everyone', 'Here', 'very', 'intriguing', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'black', 'white', 'imagery', 'fast', 'paced', 'music', 'almost', 'constant', 'throbbing', 'ear', 'providing', 'viewer', 'mere', 'glimpse', 'madness', 'envelope', 'main', 'character', 'scenes', 'reminded', 'much', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Eraserhead', '1977', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'Lynch', 'website', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'rely', 'viewer', 'wallow', 'around', 'mire', 'artistic', 'ambiguity', 'try', 'decode', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'screen', 'scenes', 'harsh', 'representation', 'was', 'pretty', 'clear', 'hard', 'take', 'times', 'symbolism', 'was', 'laid', 'bit', 'thick', 'times', 'certain', 'amount', 'was', 'left', 'viewers', 'own', 'interpretation', 'think', 'ultimately', 'fell', 'scope', 'story.There', 'are', 'quite', 'bit', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'may', 'help', 'shed', 'light', 'more', 'curious', 'aspects', 'film', 'lost', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mean', 'not', 'found', 'yet', 'here', 'are', 'production', 'notes', 'cast', 'crew', 'information', 'music', 'video', 'trailers.Cookieman108']",N/A

Meanwhile, he wants no part of any of these people.Our hero, the numbers freak, thinks the entire world revolves around numbers.

76373,A1AWIMIVWGIER,0784011796,Dana Garrett,"[6, 13]","The Untied States has a long and probably singular contempt for intellectual pursuit, stemming mostly from its Puritan roots.  In fact, this film could easily have been premised on the biblical verse: &quot;Of the making of many books there is no end and much study is weariness to the flesh.&quot;The film concerns a mathematician's (Max Cohen's) quest to find an underlying structure to all reality that can be expressed mathematically.  Of course, his quest is cast as an obsession that makes him somewhat antisocial and gives him extreme debilitating migraines that he attempts to palliate through various drugs.  He hopes to discover this underlying mathematical structure for noble purposes like predicting outcomes in the stock market.  In the Puritan worldview, people given to intellectual pursuits cannot be motivated by worthwhile concerns.  His pursuit comes to the attention of corporate gangsters and Jewish mystics.  The former want to use his formula to plot their investments, while the latter want it in order to find the mathematical expression that can be translated into the (lost) secret name of God.  Both groups strong-arm Max, indicating that there is no real spiritual difference between them.  I found the parallel of greed with Jews disturbing.In the end, Max lobotomizes himself by drilling a hole in his head.  He can no longer do relatively simple computations and has all the docile pleasantness of Forrest Gump, the American ideal.  Ignorance is bliss.  The entire movie turns on this clich&eacute;.Ironically, the choice of black and white was appropriate for the film.  It parallels nicely the false dilemma the film presents: either we live with a tortured dysfunctional intelligence or a tranquil ignorance.

Therefore, there are patterns everwhere in nature.502884197169399375105820974944He's a mathematical supergenius but a severe misanthrope and so introverted, he makes me look like Bill Clinton. He's very disconnected with society and spends time around the clock on his problem, helped by a regimen of pills. His computer setup is a muddled patchwork system that is a reflection of the chaos and disorder of his mind. He finds solace visiting his old mentor Sol Robeson, with whom he plays go.592307816406286208998628034825Sol's pearls of wisdom are lost on Max. Sol sees the world as chaotic, without any order. He explains the go board as a microcosm of the universe, where an infinite number of reflects a complex and chaotic universe. His parable of Archimedes (Eureka!) is also lost on Max. Ever the voice of reason, Sol tells Max there's more to life than mathematics and to take some time off, to take a bath like Archimedes.342117067982148086513282306647A group of agents want him to figure out the pattern to the stock market but he refuses them, turned off by their representative's persistent and pushy approach. At first, anyway.Max also meets the more extraverted Lenny Meyer, a Hasidic Jew who's also into math theory, but using the Torah as his data set. The dual use of the Hebrew alphabet as numbers and sums was a fascinating thing I never knew about.093844609550582231725359408128When Max's computer crashes, it spits out a long digit that may be a similar digit that caused Sol's computer to crash back when he was calculating pi. When Lenny mentions a 216 digit word that may hold the key to his search, Max teams up with him.481117450284102701938521105559References to the Golden Spiral and ratio of the rectangles by Pythagoras, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Fibonacci sequence will be of delight to scientific-minded. For those who don't know the Fibonacci, start with 1 and 1. The sum of the first two numbers equals the third, resulting in 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,56, etc. The ratio theta, which is the quotient of two numbers in the series, reaches 1.6180339887499, for anyone interested. Take a rectangle with a ratio of that to 1. Make that rectangle a square and the remaining smaller rectangle has that same ratio theta. Cool?644622948954930381964428810975This b&w; independent wonder by Darren Aronofsky is full of swimmingly dizzying shots to emulate the chaos of the city and in Max's mind. Bizarre imagery also comes into play, such as the mystery man with the bleeding hand, the brain, and his visions and dreams. This movie seeks to create a common ground between rational science and religious mysticism, as represented by Max and Lenny. There's also the opposing viewpoints of an ordered universe (Max) of patterns versus chaos (Sol). Top honors go to Sean Gullette (Max), Mark Margolis (Sol), and Ben Shenkman (Lenny). So, why call the movie Pi? Because pi is a decimal that's irrational, nonterminating, nonrepeating, just like a go game.12:30 AM, finished writing review for 3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279 5028841971 6939937510 5820974944 5923078164 0628620899 8628034825 3421170679 8214808651 3282306647 0938446095 5058223172",4,3.141592653589793238462643383279....,1028851200,"08 9, 2002",2002,3574,"['12:05', 'AM', 'began', 'writing', 'review', 'Pi', 'amazing', 'film', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky.Mathematician', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'obsessively', 'trying', 'find', 'pattern', 'way', 'stock', 'market', 'rises', 'falls', 'three', 'fundamental', 'assumptions', '1', 'Mathematics', 'language', 'nature', '2', 'Everything', 'can', 'be', 'represented', 'understood', 'numbers', '3', 'graph', 'number', 'system', 'emerge', 'Therefore', 'are', 'patterns', 'everwhere', 'nature.502884197169399375105820974944He', 'mathematical', 'supergenius', 'severe', 'misanthrope', 'so', 'introverted', 'look', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'very', 'disconnected', 'society', 'spends', 'time', 'clock', 'problem', 'helped', 'regimen', 'pills', 'computer', 'setup', 'muddled', 'patchwork', 'system', 'reflection', 'chaos', 'disorder', 'mind', 'solace', 'visiting', 'old', 'mentor', 'Sol', 'Robeson', 'whom', 'go.592307816406286208998628034825Sol', 'pearls', 'wisdom', 'are', 'lost', 'Max', 'Sol', 'world', 'chaotic', 'order', 'go', 'board', 'microcosm', 'universe', 'where', 'infinite', 'number', 'complex', 'chaotic', 'universe', 'parable', 'Archimedes', 'Eureka', 'also', 'lost', 'Max', 'Ever', 'voice', 'reason', 'Sol', 'Max', 'more', 'life', 'mathematics', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'take', 'bath', 'Archimedes.342117067982148086513282306647A', 'group', 'agents', 'want', 'figure', 'out', 'pattern', 'stock', 'market', 'turned', 'off', 'representative', 'persistent', 'pushy', 'approach', 'first', 'anyway.Max', 'also', 'more', 'extraverted', 'Lenny', 'Meyer', 'Hasidic', 'Jew', 'who', 'also', 'math', 'theory', 'using', 'Torah', 'data', 'set', 'dual', 'use', 'Hebrew', 'alphabet', 'numbers', 'sums', 'was', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'never', 'knew', 'about.093844609550582231725359408128When', 'Max', 'computer', 'crashes', 'out', 'long', 'digit', 'may', 'be', 'similar', 'digit', 'caused', 'Sol', 'computer', 'crash', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'calculating', 'pi', 'When', 'Lenny', '216', 'digit', 'word', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'search', 'Max', 'up', 'him.481117450284102701938521105559References', 'Golden', 'Spiral', 'ratio', 'rectangles', 'Pythagoras', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'Fibonacci', 'sequence', 'will', 'be', 'delight', 'scientific-minded', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Fibonacci', 'start', '1', '1', 'sum', 'first', 'two', 'numbers', 'equals', 'third', 'resulting', '1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,56', 'etc', 'ratio', 'theta', 'quotient', 'two', 'numbers', 'series', '1.6180339887499', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Take', 'rectangle', 'ratio', '1', 'Make', 'rectangle', 'square', 'remaining', 'smaller', 'rectangle', 'same', 'ratio', 'theta', 'Cool', '644622948954930381964428810975This', 'b', 'w', 'independent', 'wonder', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'full', 'swimmingly', 'dizzying', 'shots', 'emulate', 'chaos', 'city', 'Max', 'mind', 'Bizarre', 'imagery', 'also', 'play', 'such', 'mystery', 'man', 'bleeding', 'hand', 'brain', 'visions', 'dreams', 'movie', 'create', 'common', 'ground', 'rational', 'science', 'religious', 'mysticism', 'represented', 'Max', 'Lenny', 'also', 'opposing', 'viewpoints', 'ordered', 'universe', 'Max', 'patterns', 'versus', 'chaos', 'Sol', 'Top', 'honors', 'go', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'Max', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'Sol', 'Ben', 'Shenkman', 'Lenny', 'So', 'why', 'call', 'movie', 'Pi', 'pi', 'decimal', 'irrational', 'nonterminating', 'nonrepeating', 'just', 'go', 'game.12:30', 'AM', 'finished', 'writing', 'review', '3.1415926535', '8979323846', '2643383279', '5028841971', '6939937510', '5820974944', '5923078164', '0628620899', '8628034825', '3421170679', '8214808651', '3282306647', '0938446095', '5058223172']",N/A

76378,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,0784011796,Dave,"[2, 2]","From the content of a few other reviews I thought this film might be interesting given its taunted mathematical theme.  However, there was no real mathematical content to support the story.  The main character, Max, never demonstrated any of the intellectual talent he was supposed to possess.  Instead he was in essence a mystic who believed in a predictable and understandable mathematical structure of nature but demonstrated only a superficial basis for such a belief.  Because the film had little substance, it had to inject Max's unsuccessful attempts to predict the price movement of individual stocks as well as touching upon deciphering the mythical mathematical code that underlies the Torah in order to meet the length of a feature film.  The absurdity of these sideshows further detracted from Max's credibility as a mathematician.Max, who was mentally unbalanced at the beginning of the film, descended into the chaos of his imagination and became self-destructive.  It is unclear how much of this was drug induced hallucination.  I would draw a parallel between him and a man who is obsessed with finding a god who is driven crazy by the unfulfilled expectation of actually finding one, thus he falsely claims success.  This story is much more about mental illness than mathematical or scientific theory and findings.  The injection of more credibility into Max at the onset of the film would have enabled the filmmakers to show a much more drastic decline in Max's condition.  Instead, he only went the short way from very nuts to completely nuts.  It might have some appeal to those who have an interest in psychiatry, but I suspect those who have such an interest would possess a scientific curiosity that this film will leave unsatisfied.I would have rated the film with one star, but I must admit I have seen a few that were worse.",2,Disappointing,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,1850,"['content', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'thought', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'given', 'taunted', 'mathematical', 'theme', 'However', 'was', 'real', 'mathematical', 'content', 'support', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'Max', 'never', 'demonstrated', 'intellectual', 'talent', 'was', 'supposed', 'possess', 'Instead', 'was', 'essence', 'mystic', 'who', 'believed', 'predictable', 'understandable', 'mathematical', 'structure', 'nature', 'demonstrated', 'only', 'superficial', 'basis', 'belief', 'film', 'had', 'little', 'substance', 'had', 'inject', 'Max', 'unsuccessful', 'attempts', 'predict', 'price', 'movement', 'individual', 'stocks', 'as', 'well', 'touching', 'deciphering', 'mythical', 'mathematical', 'code', 'Torah', 'order', 'meet', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'absurdity', 'sideshows', 'further', 'detracted', 'Max', 'credibility', 'mathematician.Max', 'who', 'was', 'mentally', 'unbalanced', 'beginning', 'film', 'descended', 'chaos', 'imagination', 'became', 'self-destructive', 'unclear', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'drug', 'induced', 'hallucination', 'would', 'draw', 'parallel', 'man', 'who', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'god', 'who', 'driven', 'crazy', 'unfulfilled', 'expectation', 'actually', 'finding', 'one', 'thus', 'falsely', 'success', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'mental', 'illness', 'mathematical', 'scientific', 'theory', 'findings', 'injection', 'more', 'credibility', 'Max', 'onset', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'enabled', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'drastic', 'decline', 'Max', 'condition', 'Instead', 'only', 'went', 'short', 'way', 'very', 'nuts', 'completely', 'nuts', 'might', 'have', 'appeal', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'psychiatry', 'suspect', 'who', 'have', 'interest', 'would', 'possess', 'scientific', 'curiosity', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'unsatisfied.I', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'were', 'worse']",N/A

76383,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0784011796,Dennis Littrell,"[23, 27]","Pi, I understand, has now been factored to over a billion places.  My question: are the digits random?  Anybody out there know?  This film does not answer that question (nor does it address it).  What it asks is, are numbers the language of life?  Max Cohen, mathematical genius, believes they are.  There is a pattern, and he would like to find it, partly because it's there and partly for use in the stock market.  So would some other people.  He is thus tormented both within and without.One of the things that made this a successful commercial film (for an indie venture, of course) is the fine acting by Sean Gullette who plays Max Cohen.  He was entirely convincing as a reclusive and paranoid mathematical genius; but he is also a man like Einstein who emanates charisma and something perhaps beyond charm.  Also effective was the story by Director Darren Aronofsky, which, unlike some indie films, actually had a plot with clear conflicts.  The choice of Pamela Hart, a strong black woman as a kind of hit woman from Wall Street was excellent.  Also very good was Mark Margolis as Cohen's mentor, Sol Robeson.  Aimed at a popular audience were, alas, some chase scenes; but they were not badly done, and even seemed appropriate, although I think there should be a moratorium placed on subway chase scenes in movies, at least for the next decade or so.  Also aimed at a popular audience was some of the violent images, in particular the scene where Cohen places the power drill to his temple, like the barrel of an executioner's handgun, turns it on and presses.  Kids love that shtick.  (I could hardly watch.)Much of the detail was completely veracious, the spiral as an example of complexity in nature, or the wonderful re-enactment of the programmer's moment of truth just before he hits the return key and finds out if his creation will run, crash or go into infinite loop; or a group of fundamental religious people (in this case Hasidic Jews) believing that some sort of numerology will miraculously reveal some major truth of their religion; or even the fact that Max Cohen still used five and one-quarter inch floppies for his data.  Also wondrously right was the spider/moth sticky cocoon that gummed up his computer, or the little girl who multiplies on her calculator and then asks Max for the answer, delighted when he gets it right.  That a stock market bonanza served as the El Dorado of number crunchers was also right on target.  And an especially good fit was the techno rock in the background.But some of this was definitely wrong.  The idea that Sol Robeson would think Max's computer had become or was becoming &quot;conscious&quot; was too much of a leap.  Or the notion that the human brain, or any brain for that matter, could predict stock prices as they come out of the ticker is absurd.  Complexity theory would argue strongly that such specific data, like the number of rain drops in a storm tomorrow, is in principle impossible to predict.  I also didn't like the resolution which allows us to treat whichever of the foregone scenes we like as dream-fantasies.  I don't like plots that are resolved by &quot;it was a dream&quot; mechanisms, even, or especially, retrospective ones.But movies are about images and the image of Cohen's head and his brain and of what hard, metallic things can do to it, is something that lingers long after the lights have come up.  Indeed what makes this an engrossing movie is its psychological and visual content.  The stark, grainy black and white cinematography actually enhance our appreciation.  Indeed, light and dark and other dichotomies are part of the expression of Aronofsky's vision.  He juxtaposes contrasting elements of our culture, of the mind and of nature to tease us into seeing that the world is vastly more mysterious than we can imagine.  There is order and there is chaos.  There is number and there is the organism that is an expression of number.  There is rationality and there is insanity.  There is the soft, fragile brain and the hard electrodes.  There is the game of go, more complex than chess, the wooden board with the simple lines and the black and white pebbles that spring open the door to chaos (the mathematical kind).  And there is life, fragile, uncertain, teetering on the edge, and in the fuzzy distance there is the shimmering certainly of a fundamental religion.  Aronsky catches all of this and ends up with an electronic poem camouflaged as a movie.",4,Not really about 3.14159... per se,981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,4465,"['Pi', 'understand', 'now', 'been', 'factored', 'billion', 'places', 'question', 'are', 'digits', 'random', 'Anybody', 'there', 'know', 'film', 'not', 'answer', 'question', 'address', 'What', 'are', 'numbers', 'language', 'life', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'are', 'pattern', 'would', 'like', 'find', 'partly', 'there', 'partly', 'use', 'stock', 'market', 'So', 'would', 'other', 'people', 'thus', 'tormented', 'without.One', 'things', 'made', 'successful', 'commercial', 'film', 'indie', 'venture', 'course', 'fine', 'acting', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'who', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'was', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'reclusive', 'paranoid', 'mathematical', 'genius', 'also', 'man', 'Einstein', 'who', 'charisma', 'something', 'perhaps', 'charm', 'Also', 'effective', 'was', 'story', 'Director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'indie', 'films', 'actually', 'had', 'plot', 'clear', 'conflicts', 'choice', 'Pamela', 'Hart', 'strong', 'black', 'woman', 'kind', 'hit', 'woman', 'Wall', 'Street', 'was', 'excellent', 'Also', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'Cohen', 'mentor', 'Sol', 'Robeson', 'Aimed', 'popular', 'audience', 'were', 'alas', 'chase', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'badly', 'done', 'even', 'seemed', 'appropriate', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'moratorium', 'placed', 'subway', 'chase', 'scenes', 'movies', 'least', 'next', 'decade', 'so', 'Also', 'aimed', 'popular', 'audience', 'was', 'violent', 'images', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'Cohen', 'power', 'drill', 'temple', 'barrel', 'executioner', 'handgun', 'presses', 'Kids', 'love', 'shtick', 'could', 'hardly', 'watch', 'Much', 'detail', 'was', 'completely', 'veracious', 'spiral', 'example', 'complexity', 'nature', 'wonderful', 're-enactment', 'programmer', 'moment', 'truth', 'just', 'return', 'key', 'out', 'creation', 'will', 'run', 'crash', 'go', 'infinite', 'loop', 'group', 'fundamental', 'religious', 'people', 'case', 'Hasidic', 'Jews', 'believing', 'sort', 'numerology', 'will', 'miraculously', 'reveal', 'major', 'truth', 'religion', 'even', 'fact', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'still', 'used', 'five', 'one-quarter', 'inch', 'floppies', 'data', 'Also', 'wondrously', 'right', 'was', 'spider/moth', 'sticky', 'cocoon', 'gummed', 'up', 'computer', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'calculator', 'then', 'Max', 'answer', 'delighted', 'when', 'right', 'stock', 'market', 'bonanza', 'served', 'El', 'Dorado', 'number', 'crunchers', 'was', 'also', 'right', 'target', 'especially', 'good', 'fit', 'was', 'techno', 'rock', 'background.But', 'was', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'idea', 'Sol', 'Robeson', 'would', 'think', 'Max', 'computer', 'had', 'become', 'was', 'becoming', 'quot', 'conscious', 'quot', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'leap', 'notion', 'human', 'brain', 'brain', 'matter', 'could', 'predict', 'stock', 'prices', 'come', 'ticker', 'absurd', 'Complexity', 'theory', 'would', 'argue', 'strongly', 'such', 'specific', 'data', 'number', 'rain', 'drops', 'storm', 'tomorrow', 'principle', 'impossible', 'predict', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'resolution', 'treat', 'whichever', 'foregone', 'dream-fantasies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'plots', 'are', 'resolved', 'quot', 'was', 'dream', 'quot', 'mechanisms', 'even', 'especially', 'retrospective', 'ones.But', 'movies', 'are', 'images', 'image', 'Cohen', 'head', 'brain', 'what', 'hard', 'metallic', 'things', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'lingers', 'long', 'lights', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'Indeed', 'what', 'engrossing', 'movie', 'psychological', 'visual', 'content', 'stark', 'grainy', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'actually', 'enhance', 'appreciation', 'Indeed', 'light', 'dark', 'other', 'dichotomies', 'are', 'part', 'expression', 'Aronofsky', 'vision', 'contrasting', 'elements', 'culture', 'mind', 'nature', 'tease', 'seeing', 'world', 'vastly', 'more', 'mysterious', 'can', 'imagine', 'order', 'chaos', 'number', 'organism', 'expression', 'number', 'rationality', 'insanity', 'soft', 'fragile', 'brain', 'hard', 'electrodes', 'game', 'go', 'more', 'complex', 'chess', 'wooden', 'board', 'simple', 'lines', 'black', 'white', 'pebbles', 'spring', 'open', 'door', 'chaos', 'mathematical', 'kind', 'life', 'fragile', 'uncertain', 'teetering', 'edge', 'fuzzy', 'distance', 'shimmering', 'certainly', 'fundamental', 'religion', 'Aronsky', 'up', 'electronic', 'poem', 'camouflaged', 'movie']",N/A

76389,AJFQCJXYDEQYO,0784011796,dronecaster,"[10, 12]","Pi is unquestionably one of the most audacious feature-length films in recent memory, largely because the questions that it raises are not only theoretical but also, in the truest sense, larger than life. Director Darren Aronofsky's debut is a wild ride to both the frontier of intellectual inquiry as well as the physical consequences such inquiries can have on those who ask the &quot;big questions&quot;, namely in this case Max Cohen, the brilliant mathematician played to perfection by Sean Gullette. This is a film that would appeal to every Einstein and Stephen Hawking in the world as well as those who have a layman's interest in theoretical mathematics. It has long been suspected that there is a direct relationship between the number pi (3.1415...) and the striking similarities we humans see in both the organic and inorganic in nature, in this case, the tormented Cohen sees a relationship between the golden spiral (based on studies by the ancient Greeks) and pi. However, the real question is: is his intense personality governed by the fact that such a relationship exists and his anxiousnees to prove it to the world or is he simply hellbent to find such a relationship, and in essence becoming the most brilliant mathematician of his time (maybe of all time)? Because the &quot;mystery&quot; of pi is not uncovered, the film leaves far more questions unanswered than answered, thus lending the film its profoundly stark, disturbing atmosphere of both intrique as well as terror.At first, Max is only interested in finding a relationship between pi and the inner mechanics of the stock market, NOT in an effort to beat it to become fabulously wealthy but to further prove that the pattern(s) dictated by pi not only exist in nature, but that they also have a hand in everyday human activities. True, it may be a bit too much to swallow, but Aronofsky's script, direction and Gullette's lucid performance makes these ideas ever more tantalizing, even if they are &quot;far out&quot; (or are they?).Though largely reclusive, Max does have one close friend: a mentor/former professor Sol (Mark Margolis) who he visits regularly to play the Japanesse board game &quot;Go&quot; (if the spelling is wrong, I stand corrected) which incidentally serves as Sol's basis for the idea that the universe is largely chaotic, rather than ordered and patterned, countering Max's efforts to connect pi with a dominating pattern (the golden spiral) that exists throughout the cosmos. Sol bases this on his own research into pi, which he says spans four decades and ended in no significant discoveries to back up Max's ideas. Sol seems to come from the side of Shakespeare's &quot;Macbeth&quot;: that the search for patterns in pi is essentially &quot;a 'tale' told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot; Though this film doesn't refer to anything else in Western literature other than the writings of Archimedes and da Vinci, there are clearly parallels between what Max's search entails and other literary works which concentrate on the many complexities of the human condition.While on his &quot;crusade&quot;, Max encounters a Jewish mystic (Lenny) in the coffee shop he frequents who also has a deep-seated interest in number theory. Rather than finding a relationship between patterns and the stock market like Max, Lenny is interested in finding a similar pattern in the Torah which would reveal &quot;the true name of God&quot;. Along with this, Max is pursued by Wall Street tycoons interested in his research, one of which claims to have studied his papers on the subject (Marcy Dawson). Along with the pressures that Max places on himself to find a unifying theory for both the stock market as well as the universe at large, he is pressured to a greater extent by these two different forces with equally different objectives. This drives Max &quot;over the edge&quot;, as Sol warned him, a breakdown so severe that he personally injures himself to the extent that it eliminates any and all possibility of future research on the one love of his life.Coupled with an appropiately dark, atmospheric IDM soundtrack with contributions by Autechre, Orbital, Spacetime Continuum and the brilliant theme by Clint Mansell, Pi does fall rather nicely into the category of science-fiction/fantasy, but it is also a tragedy as well, showing the limits of human ambition, in this case on the part of Max. I felt it was one of the best films of the late 1990s, and one which should be required viewing for anyone even remotely interested in how number theory can (and may not) tie in with human concerns of everyday life, the universe, and in the minds of religious mystics, the great beyond.",5,A different twist on a search for a grand unifying theory,1006560000,"11 24, 2001",2001,4712,"['Pi', 'unquestionably', 'one', 'most', 'audacious', 'feature-length', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'largely', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'theoretical', 'also', 'truest', 'sense', 'larger', 'life', 'Director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'debut', 'wild', 'ride', 'frontier', 'intellectual', 'inquiry', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'consequences', 'such', 'inquiries', 'can', 'have', 'who', 'ask', 'quot', 'big', 'questions', 'quot', 'namely', 'case', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'brilliant', 'mathematician', 'played', 'perfection', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'film', 'would', 'appeal', 'Einstein', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'have', 'layman', 'interest', 'theoretical', 'mathematics', 'long', 'been', 'suspected', 'direct', 'relationship', 'number', 'pi', '3.1415', 'striking', 'similarities', 'humans', 'see', 'organic', 'inorganic', 'nature', 'case', 'tormented', 'Cohen', 'relationship', 'golden', 'spiral', 'based', 'studies', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'pi', 'However', 'real', 'question', 'intense', 'personality', 'governed', 'fact', 'relationship', 'anxiousnees', 'prove', 'world', 'simply', 'hellbent', 'find', 'such', 'relationship', 'essence', 'becoming', 'most', 'brilliant', 'mathematician', 'time', 'maybe', 'time', 'quot', 'mystery', 'quot', 'pi', 'not', 'uncovered', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'answered', 'thus', 'lending', 'film', 'profoundly', 'stark', 'disturbing', 'atmosphere', 'intrique', 'as', 'well', 'terror.At', 'first', 'Max', 'only', 'interested', 'finding', 'relationship', 'pi', 'inner', 'mechanics', 'stock', 'market', 'NOT', 'effort', 'beat', 'become', 'fabulously', 'wealthy', 'further', 'prove', 'pattern', 'dictated', 'pi', 'not', 'only', 'exist', 'nature', 'also', 'have', 'hand', 'everyday', 'human', 'activities', 'True', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'swallow', 'Aronofsky', 'script', 'direction', 'Gullette', 'lucid', 'performance', 'ideas', 'ever', 'more', 'tantalizing', 'even', 'are', 'quot', 'far', 'quot', 'are', 'largely', 'reclusive', 'Max', 'have', 'one', 'close', 'friend', 'mentor/former', 'professor', 'Sol', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'who', 'regularly', 'play', 'Japanesse', 'board', 'game', 'quot', 'Go', 'quot', 'spelling', 'wrong', 'stand', 'corrected', 'incidentally', 'Sol', 'basis', 'idea', 'universe', 'largely', 'chaotic', 'rather', 'ordered', 'patterned', 'countering', 'Max', 'efforts', 'connect', 'pi', 'dominating', 'pattern', 'golden', 'spiral', 'cosmos', 'Sol', 'own', 'research', 'pi', 'four', 'decades', 'ended', 'significant', 'discoveries', 'back', 'up', 'Max', 'ideas', 'Sol', 'come', 'side', 'Shakespeare', 'quot', 'Macbeth', 'quot', 'search', 'patterns', 'pi', 'essentially', 'quot', ""'tale"", 'told', 'idiot', 'full', 'sound', 'fury', 'signifying', 'nothing.', 'quot', 'film', ""n't"", 'refer', 'anything', 'else', 'Western', 'literature', 'other', 'writings', 'Archimedes', 'da', 'Vinci', 'are', 'clearly', 'parallels', 'what', 'Max', 'search', 'entails', 'other', 'literary', 'works', 'concentrate', 'many', 'complexities', 'human', 'condition.While', 'quot', 'crusade', 'quot', 'Max', 'Jewish', 'mystic', 'Lenny', 'coffee', 'shop', 'who', 'also', 'deep-seated', 'interest', 'number', 'theory', 'Rather', 'finding', 'relationship', 'patterns', 'stock', 'market', 'Max', 'Lenny', 'interested', 'finding', 'similar', 'pattern', 'Torah', 'would', 'reveal', 'quot', 'true', 'name', 'God', 'quot', 'Max', 'pursued', 'Wall', 'Street', 'tycoons', 'interested', 'research', 'one', 'claims', 'have', 'studied', 'papers', 'subject', 'Marcy', 'Dawson', 'pressures', 'Max', 'find', 'unifying', 'theory', 'stock', 'market', 'as', 'well', 'universe', 'large', 'pressured', 'greater', 'extent', 'two', 'different', 'forces', 'equally', 'different', 'objectives', 'Max', 'quot', 'edge', 'quot', 'Sol', 'warned', 'breakdown', 'so', 'severe', 'personally', 'extent', 'possibility', 'future', 'research', 'one', 'love', 'life.Coupled', 'appropiately', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'IDM', 'soundtrack', 'contributions', 'Autechre', 'Orbital', 'Spacetime', 'Continuum', 'brilliant', 'theme', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'Pi', 'fall', 'rather', 'nicely', 'category', 'science-fiction/fantasy', 'also', 'tragedy', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'limits', 'human', 'ambition', 'case', 'part', 'Max', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'late', '1990s', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'how', 'number', 'theory', 'can', 'may', 'not', 'tie', 'human', 'concerns', 'everyday', 'life', 'universe', 'minds', 'religious', 'mystics', 'great']",N/A

76391,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,0784011796,Earl Hazell,"[4, 5]","This movie is powerfully and beautifully subversive. It doesn't just simply tackle the world of INNER space, merging the psychological with the scientific and mystical like its fraternal/spiritual twin THE MATRIX.  Nor does it heavyhandedly demand you to make the kind of simple choices that are really nothing more than candy for a mind aching for the nutrients of provocative challenging thought or even, secretly, spiritual crises.  (Questions that ignore the relevance of the movie's theme, like &quot;is Max [the main character] really crazy or just a genius? or both?&quot;, the way the new Kevin Spacey vehicle K-PAX engenders [is he an E.T., or just a psychotic? Or both?&quot;].  After a while that becomes like &quot;do you think the people in this porno movie are falling in love, or no?&quot;).This movie is powerfully, joyously, triumphantly unsettling and subversive, becuase it reveals the emperor that has no clothes in many of the philosphical questions we ask routinely of ourselves.  We ask these powerful questions at parties and during some international crisis, but with a manufactured profundity to hide the degree to which we have exorcised pondering their actual implications from our everyday intellectual and emotional lives.  Is there really a God?  What is sanity, really?  What is the relevance of religion in a post-Einstein/Freudian/Tech stock/Prozac world? What can ancient history teach us about the modern present...  We don't really care to have a legitimate answer to these questions because they are now designed to have us continue sleeping before they are even asked, whether outright or cryptically; not to really wake us up.  But logical, simple yet scientific questions about the innate structure of reality...the possible high order that defines it and the universe, above and beyond illusion of randomness, duality and chaos...the implications of a world that is really all just levels of energy and their unifying, &quot;harmonic&quot; relationships to human consciousness and being--right down to how we define and express the very concepts (like love, happiness, freedom, enlightenment, reality and yes,  GOD) that form the basis of our everyday lives... These kind of questions still frighten us, because you can't ask them without receiving some information that will shock your world, whether the complete answer agrees with your preconceptions, doesn't, or never fully comes.  We can argue the existence of God, but what can we say about the existence of the golden ratio, the Fibonacci Series, or Pi?  And what do we do if it IS in the Bible and Torah and the architecture of the Pyramids as much as it is in nature?The movie PI takes this fundamental theme/question of our modern world--*do you have the courage to question your existence, before it questions you?*--and riffs on it like Charlie Parker on the chords of the blues.  &quot;Forget the characters and their lives; I'll make them interesting only because bad character development would distract you even more&quot; Aranofsky (the writer and director) seems to say to us. &quot;Let's talk about order vs. chaos, and the proof of both that helps declare the other an illusion.  Knowing that, perhaps, only one gives the illusion of the other the relevance and respect that it deserves: making IT the real *reality* by definition.  And then let's deal with the implications of believeing in the supremacy or existence of either--or both--to the human mind, and the human heart, considering how virutally anything else we talk about in life is a metaphor for one or the other anyway.PI is the kind of movie that doesn't just make philosophy fun (removing it from the spoiling hands of many a philosopher). It makes it relevant.  The acting is done very well; the filming effect of gritty, harsh, and stark black and white color is very effective.  And it is very, very weird.  It gets into the mind of a man who is erasing that fine, ever-erased line spearating genius from insanity as enlightenment approaches.  This is an important film, however, because of how deeply it moves you.  It can even change your way of thinking by bringing up what it does.If you can name your favorite Twilight Zone rerun in less than five seconds, this movie will become an imporant part of your discography.

So I can add a few points for the newcomer to the film, and perhaps answer queries about the movie itself.What begins with the mathematician fishing for the solution to the stock exchange ends in his discovery of God. That's right: he discovers God. When his PC and then even his electrical system begin creating life, which somehow attracts carpenter ants, we know he's got more than just a spooky number in there.It is very, very clever of the makers never to show the audience this number. A good thing.Paranoid, suffering blinding migraines and other sensory disturbances, the mathematician finds a certain release--and this is how the film introduces some to the results of studying the Kabalah. This man is clearly not so religious, he's not studying the Kabalah. He's gone beyond that.In the stunning, noir thriller, the mathematician is pursued by a silly girl who really likes him, by the government who really wants his work (the men in black pursue him, but it is a black lady!), and by a knowledge-hungry Hasidic Jewish community who is trying to lure him back into the fold. They are the most interesting, for they have revealed to the mathematician that he has found God--who is HE to deserve that knowledge all for himself? Who is he to hoard it all forever?Well, he is the discoverer...or is he the Chosen One??I think the actor Gulette is very sexy in this film. A few shots of him are quite sexual and provocative, and I wonder to this day why that was done. A very revealing shot of him sitting in a chair finds the camera nestled neatly in his crotch. Personally, I loved it. I still don't get it.His final solution is to drill a hole in his skull--or cause a superficial wound, I'm not clear what he did. This relieves his migraines and possibly erases his incessant genius with numbers. The allegory, of turning away and paying a small price in exchange for what would have been a very high price, is a life lesson.This film is unforgettable; over the years I've had pals ask me, ""What the heck is that movie called, the one with the crazy scientist whose computer comes to life?""--and I always know which film they mean. There are some younger people who think the film dates back to the 1970s. There is a 1970s quality to it, and that is a part I love.

When his computer spits out a strange number while self-destructing the  protagonist automatically assumes that it is the meaning of life. Well, of  course it is. Then the Hassidics get involved and explain to him that the  216 digit number is actually the name of God. Well, of course it is. Makes  sense to me. All the while we're waiting for some kind of payoff,  especially since this film has been positively reviewed. What we get is the  main character standing in a white room, and then drilling into the side of  his head. What the hell does that mean? He saw God? He doesn't want the  number in his head anymore? He has a headache? Your guess is as good as  mine. This movie is filled to the brim with dropping things out of nowhere  and not explaining them, or doing anything with them. This is a sixth grade  creative writing story set to celluloid. About the only thing I liked was  the opening title sequence. The music, sort of new wave techno promises a  fresh new story, it lied. The tone plays like a cross between Brazil and  Erasorhead. The problem is, both of those films had something to say about  society, this one has nothing to offer except that maybe computer geeks  really ARE as weird as we're afraid they are. I can't emphasize enouph how  annoying it was to have things brought up and then dropped. The swirls,  what significance were they? How did they have anything to do with 216? Or  the mark on his head, what was it? What did it mean? Was it an ancient  symbol? Did it have some mathematical significance? What was his  relationship with the woman? Why after everyone kidnaps him do they  suddenly decide to let him go? Why did the old man die? They said he had a  stroke but did it have something to do with 216? If so (which they somewhat  imply) how in the hell can a number written on a piece of paper kill you?  Why does he shave his head? Why is this character such a weirdo in the  first place? We don't have any clue to his background or why he mistrusts  people at all &quot;He just DOES!&quot; I suspect the writer/director would  say. I suppose this is the same response a sixth grader would give about  his creative writing story. Well, I'm an adult, and I expect a little more.  This is my advise, rewrite the story. This time actually try to tie things  together. Don't just bring things up and drop them. Examples: swirls, mark  on head, THE STOCK MARKET! I spent the entire movie thinking he was going  to raid the stockmarket, at the end they just drop it completely! Now that  you've written a coherant story, add a little character to your character!  Now how about an ending. The end is very important because it JUSTIFIES  SPENDING MY TIME WITH YOUR STORY!!!  How about paying off some of your promises?

It also features some great computer filtering processes and editing.Aside form being completely  UN-Hollywood (and all the better for it, regardless of what any other  reviews say), it takes the viewer through a certain set of motions in a  certain sequence to achieve a certain effect. That effect being an  atmosphere of chaos, cathexis, frustration and paranoia. Disney, this  ain't!Perhaps, the reason some reviewers didn't enjoy PI, has to do with  exactly that. They called it amateurish and shallow, with a storyline that  is more befitting of a poorly executed art film, but I beg to differ. There  are a few things that in the case of PI, absolutely PRECEDE the content of  the storyline. Those things are: Composition, Design, Texture, and  Depth.  These are elements that, as a viewer, affect your reaction to ABSTRACT  pieces. These are elements that allow you to completely divorce the visuals  from any linear coherence your mind may have been searching for. For me the  storyline was inconsequential.If you watch the film with this in mind,  you are certainly going to enjoy going for a ride into a black and white  abyss of textures and shapes.

The plot includes too much of the mathematical detail (and medical detail, listing all the drugs Cohen was taking!), often coming across as nurdy.The solution seemed too straightforward and practical, with many details lacking here (unlike in the build-up).  I thought the final mix might include emotions, basically a more relationship-centric argument, especially as the plot did allude to the potential for something to happen between Cohen and his neighbour, but this didn't come up at all.This all said, Darren Aronofsky is clearly a very talented director.  His use of the black&white; medium and close-up camera shots in Pi were a stroke of genius - it certainly helped one get into Cohen's mind.  Requiem for a Dream is an outstanding movie but Pi fails to deliver because he took on a very weighty and complex subject in his first attempt at a motion picture.  The problem lies in the screenplay (which he co-wrote), and not his direction, however.It is interesting to note Aronofsky's use of some of the effects that he would later use in Requiem for a Dream, especially the fast-forward pill-popping sequence which was always worth a chuckle in both movies (in a dark sort of way).",3,Too detailed and open-ended,1056412800,"06 24, 2003",2003,1394,"['Being', 'mathematical', 'person', 'have', 'Masters', 'degree', 'Statistics', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'was', 'left', 'dangling', 'plot', 'too', 'much', 'mathematical', 'detail', 'medical', 'detail', 'listing', 'drugs', 'Cohen', 'was', 'taking', 'often', 'coming', 'nurdy.The', 'solution', 'seemed', 'too', 'straightforward', 'practical', 'many', 'details', 'lacking', 'here', 'build-up', 'thought', 'final', 'mix', 'might', 'include', 'emotions', 'basically', 'more', 'relationship-centric', 'argument', 'especially', 'plot', 'did', 'allude', 'potential', 'something', 'happen', 'Cohen', 'neighbour', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'all.This', 'said', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'clearly', 'very', 'talented', 'director', 'use', 'black', 'white', 'medium', 'close-up', 'camera', 'shots', 'Pi', 'were', 'stroke', 'genius', 'certainly', 'helped', 'one', 'get', 'Cohen', 'mind', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'Pi', 'deliver', 'took', 'very', 'weighty', 'complex', 'subject', 'first', 'attempt', 'motion', 'picture', 'problem', 'screenplay', 'co-wrote', 'not', 'direction', 'however.It', 'interesting', 'note', 'Aronofsky', 'use', 'effects', 'would', 'later', 'use', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'especially', 'fast-forward', 'pill-popping', 'sequence', 'was', 'always', 'chuckle', 'movies', 'dark', 'sort', 'way']",N/A

Looking for the structure of a thing,the theory, the pattern, is something that fascinates me. It is part of the work I do. This film is therefore very appealing to me. No, a better word is compelling. The young man in this film is searching for a (or THE)pattern, the structure of random numbers, the web inherent in Chaos theory. Other, more selfish people in the film try to use the protagonist, but those people are also searching. The Hasidic man is searching for the structure of the Deity, the numeric key to the name of G-d. The stock broker is searching for the overall numeric pattern of the Market. All seek an explanation, born out of Wonder. So, I can't bring myself to dislike any of the people in the film who are searching for the Answer, the Structure. All of us, to a greater or lesser degree, are searching for answers, the why of things. The search for the why or how of things is what enobles men and women. As a Buddhist, I should say ""the path is the Goal,"" but that is too pat an answer, even if it is correct. This film is a wonderful examination of our shared obsession of Seeking. It explores both the depth of mind and the limitation of Mind. It is as engrossing and compelling a film as any I've ever seen. I recommend it.

76426,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,0784011796,Jeff  Farrow,"[0, 1]","This extraordinary b&w; (as in ""black"" & ""white"") film is called Pi because it represents geometric value. The term ""geometry"" was first known in the ancient world as ""geomancy."" I noticed other reviewers felt ""gypped"" because the film was not in color. I can't imagine it any other way--it deals in numerals & figures--the b&w; concept is totally appropriate and masterfully done.I have been interested in the metaphysical/alchemical concept of ""The Great Work"" for a long time. Recently I've re-focused on the subject after reviewing certain books & films (see links list below.) There are various interpretations of The Work, and there's no easy way to explain it, but I'll try: The Great Work is known as Jivanmukti in Hindu philosophy & refers to a complex system of Yoga (""yoke"" or uniting) the devotee with Divinity; microcosm to Macrocosm; subject to the object; Cosmic Consciousness. In alchemical terms it is the search for the fabled Philosopher's Stone that can turn base metal into gold. Historically The Great Work has also played a role in magick ritual--both ""white"" & ""black""--and has been described as a ""dangerous path""--one that has reportedly driven Adepts mad.In modern terms The Great Woek can be seen as the quest for finding The Theory Of Everything (TOE) in astro-physics and advanced mathematical terms.Such is the background of ""The Work"" in a very capsulated overview.In Pi the dramatic focus is on the hero's obsession to figure out the perfect number to play the stock market. This is obviously a  materialistic interpretation of The Work. However, as the hero becomes increasingly strung out, deeper ramifications take hold of his mind.The film is remarkable in its stark, often grainy blend of black & white images, brought together in a surrealist/existentialist cauldron that borders on madness itself. There are very few actors in the movie, but their performances are deftly displayed by expert direction. Reportedly the movie was produced on a $60,000 budget.This is an extremely visceral film & brutal in its examination of the political & religious exploitation of The Work. Some people are bound to be offended by certain aspects of this movie. For example, the protagonist is a secular Jew who meets a wise cracking, supposedly religious Jew who gets him involved with a rabbinical group of Jews who are working with Kabbalah, The Zohar & a computerized ""Old Testament Code."" Their goal is to enter the mind of god, to control the elemental power of creation.These are the antagonists who, along the anti-hero's deteriorating mental state, degenerate into downright sinister characters. This aspect of PI might be a problem for some people, because the scenario comes dangerously close to reinforcing the International Jewish Conspiracy garbage promoted in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (i.e. that an evil ""Cabal"" of Jews run the world.) Maybe I'm reading too much into the script; I tend to see everything as a Political Conspiracy these days. I'll have to assume director Aranofsky knew what he was doing in regards to this aspect or possible interpretation of his absolutely brilliant film.Throughout the movie the hero keeps gulping down handfuls of what I presume are amphetamine & he obviously has been up for a very, very long time.This reminded me of the strange, unsolved case of Philip Taylor Kramer who disappeared along with his van on 12. February 1996. Kramer was a bassist in the 60's band Iron Butterfly. He was also a brilliant mathematician, computer programmer & technological visionary who apparently had top level government clearance. Reportedly he had been working on a faster-than-light communications system.Before vanishing off the planet, Kramer called 911 from his van, claiming that he was going to commit suicide. His disappearance was almost immediately reported & extensive searches made; but neither Kramer nor his vehicle was ever found, not a single trace.The following quotes are from: [deleted because external hyperlinks aren't permitted on Amazon reviews--readers can go to a search of Kramer. This one is posted under ""skeptictank""]:""I observed the growing rumors and the widening conspiracy yet I didn't think much of it -- until KTLA News here in Los Angeles ran a short five minute report on his disappearance and confirmed that Kramer had indeed been working on a faster-than-light communications system. KTLA reported that Representative James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio was concerned about Kramer's disappearance due to the fact that Kramer held nuclear-oriented security clearances tied to the MX Missile project and due to the type of mathematical research Kramer was working on.""""What is in agreement is that Kramer's mental stability was slipping. Just days before he disappeared, he stated that the Earth was going to end due to a supernova; that his father, a Professor of engineering at Youngstown University in Ohio, was really a god; that Jennifer, his wife, was really Mother Earth. As they were looking for a new home several days before his disappearance, he told his wife that he was frightened that people were going to come for him. ""Honey, we're going to have to live behind walls. Honey, people are going to want to get at me.""""Perhaps Kramer actually believed that he had stumbled upon an astounding breakthrough. The paranoia expressed tends to make me think that perhaps Philip Kramer disappeared to try to protect his wife and family from what he believed were dangerous government agencies who would eventually come after him after news of his breakthrough became known to them. That leads me to think that, if he is still alive and simply in hiding, he will eventually resurface and perhaps try to either start a laboratory of his own to developed his breakthrough else find a laboratory he feels he can trust and sign on with them.""12 years later Philip Taylor Kramer is still missing & presumed dead.In a cryptic phone message to his wife, Kramer sounded like a person suffering from a manic psychotic overload--much like our friend in Pi. Perhaps he found the Key to The Work in music & advanced technology. We may never know the real story. I will say this: It's harder to dispose of a body than one might imagine (or so Agatha Christie once wrote.) Were he & his van Beamed Up? Was he the victim of dabbling in the Occult and The Work? Did he commit the perfect suicide?There are core elements in the Kramer mystery that run parallel in Pi.We may never know the real story.It's interesting how when you start to focus on a

While studying this in his almost Hellish apartment, he discovers the ultimate number -- the name of God in mathematical terms. Its a discovery that finds him pursued by by both men of greed (an overly aggresive Wall Street firm) and God (a group of Kabbalists).

Shot in jarring black and white, and using a variety of bizarre camera angles to convey the first person, it breaks new ground in the ways that a general audience movie can be shot.  More intriguing, however, is the plot.Simply put, this movie follows a mathematician as he peruses an underlying pattern in the stock market., and later the universe.  Along the way he deals with an undefined neurological disorder, as well as Wall Street thugs and Jewish mystics.  As he comes closer and closer to this pattern, which becomes a representation of some sort of organizing force (God) in creation, he slips further and further into paranoia.  In the end, the director seems to be questioning whether the pursuit of the divine is ultimately self defeating.  Could it be that searching for the pattern in all things is a refutation of the beauty of creation?Most of the reviews of this movie seem to have heaped it with either praise or scorn.  The reality, I think, lies somewhere in between.  On the one hand, this is an intriguingly shot, genuinely original film.  On the other it is somewhat shallow; the viewer is left to draw conclusions that might have been better served by being explicitly spelled out.  I happen to like it when books or movies do this, but that's more of a personality trait than the hallmark of a great artist.  In the end, ""Pi"" is a pleasant diversion from many of the mundane films being made today, and it will certainly leave you thinking.

Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[14, 17]","Since I just recently reviewed director Darren Aronofsky's sophomore effort, I figured I might as well review this one too.I like it a lot myself, but it won't be for all tastes (even for all who like _Requiem for a Dream_). It's bizarre in all the right ways, but if you don't like things a little surreal, you won't care for this film.The setup is simple enough: Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is looking for 'patterns in pi' -- the famous transcendental number that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and that (like Euler's number e) keeps cropping up all over the place in mathematical investigations of pretty much everything. Max is convinced that if he could grok that pattern (and through it, the underlying pattern of all of nature), he'd be able e.g. to predict the ups and downs of stock prices.Is he a 'mathematician'? Hardly. We do see some evidence that he's a lightning calculator, but -- despite some brief references to actual mathematics here and there -- Max's own 'investigations' look like the same sort of nonsense long perpetrated by pseudomathematical cranks. He's also subject to really nasty migraines that send him careening into hallucination. And yet -- his mentor Sol (Mark Margolis) suggests that at one time Max _was_ a promising and even brilliant mathematician, and at one point Max's stock market predictions appear to be uncannily accurate.Overall, though, Sol is on the mark when he implies that Max has gone in for numerology. Somebody else thinks so too, and regards that as a good thing: Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman), a Hasidic Jew who is investigating number patterns in the Torah in order to discern the Name of God. He gloms onto Max and starts teaching him not only about Torah observance (there's a nice scene where the two of them put on tefillin and start to recite the Shema) but also about Kabbalah -- specifically Hebrew numerology, a.k.a. gematria, although the film doesn't use that word. (The gematria stuff is accurately presented but, again, the math is not; at one point Max suggests -- and a rabbi appears to agree -- that the Hasidim have actually tried intoning the phonetic equivalents of every single possible 216-digit number, a feat that, with a hundred people at a time each intoning one name per minute, would have taken them on the order of ten-to-the-208th-power years.)There's also some corporate entity after Max's secrets as well. So Max, whose 'research' looks to be nothing more than sheer crankery, is nevertheless at the center of a whirlwind of conspiratorial activity for some reason. Is it because he's really onto something? Or is this all just -- a la _Foucault's Pendulum_ -- an echo of Eco?You probably won't be sure of the answer to that question even _after_ watching the movie -- even after watching it repeatedly. At least, after numerous viewing myself, _I_ still don't know exactly what's supposed to have transpired here. But some people (like me) enjoy that in a movie. (At any rate, the internal resolution of Max's distress works out about the same way on any interpretation of the external events.)The film was produced on a budget of, I think, about a dollar and eighty-seven cents, so don't be looking for ILM-level special effects here. The whole megillah is brilliantly shot in grainy black and white and backed with a spare, disturbing score by Clint Mansell. Gullette pretty much carries the entire film, with the help of an excellent but very small additional cast.This is, in short, the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing.

I knew that one way or another, Max would self-destruct. ... this movie is proof that emotions count more than intelligence. not a bad debut for a director who uses great cinematography (Darren Aronofsky), but his directorial debut was missing something his next movie (Requiem For A Dream) that would have me create any sense of compassion for his characters: some human-like qualities, and emotions.",3,faith in chaos = no personality,1028851200,"08 9, 2002",2002,1755,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'disturbing', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'viewed', 'i', 'liked', 'how', 'was', 'shot', '16mm', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'giving', ""'indie"", 'approach', 'due', 'opaque', 'themes', 'colours', 'making', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'disquieting.the', 'movie', 'antisocial', 'psychotic', 'reclusive', 'mathematician', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'who', 'patterns', 'everything', 'tries', 'come', 'up', '216', 'digit', 'number', 'describe', 'pattern', 'stock', 'market', 'Hasitic', 'Jews', 'lead', 'find', 'number', 'define', 'true', 'meaning', 'God', 'near-stalker', 'business', 'tycoon', 'find', 'equation', 'make', 'major', 'bang', 'stock', 'market', 'yes', 'was', 'brilliant', 'yes', 'was', 'genius', 'man', 'had', 'personality', 'whatsoever', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'went', 'spells', 'migranes', 'head', 'trauma', 'sometimes', 'vehement', 'outbursts', 'frustration', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'look', 'dirty', 'piece', 'paper', 'rejected', 'idea', 'smelly', 'garbage', 'can', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'course', 'was', 'tortured', 'seemed', 'have', 'compassion', 'outside', 'world', 'trauma', 'was', 'only', 'caused', 'failure', 'intelligence', 'therefore', 'meaning', 'had', 'sympathy', 'him.the', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'climax', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'even', 'leading', 'same', 'few', 'times', 'show', 'having', 'fit', 'major', 'headache', 'knew', 'one', 'way', 'Max', 'would', 'self-destruct', 'movie', 'proof', 'emotions', 'count', 'more', 'intelligence', 'not', 'bad', 'debut', 'director', 'who', 'great', 'cinematography', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'directorial', 'debut', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'next', 'movie', 'Requiem', 'A', 'Dream', 'would', 'have', 'create', 'sense', 'compassion', 'characters', 'human-like', 'qualities', 'emotions']",N/A

His paranoia is evident as he has practically barricaded himself into his apartment with several redundant locks (like Jack N. in ""As Good as it Gets""), and only ventures out to meet with his old teacher. His prefessor recommends that he slow down.  Max, his fameous and best student is trying to computer model the governing dynamics of the stock market, while his mentor and old professor has been looking for patterns in pi (3.14159, etc.). I suppose working on these objectives is enough to drive anyone over the edge, but his professor actually does die mysteriously from something half way through the film.Although the much overused theme of a paranoid scientist living in the 90's appears on film once again, this movie was really well done. The film featured some great photography using enhanced contrast B&W; film stock, neat shots of multi-ethnick lower Manhattan and New York's fameous subway system with lots of atmosphere, and a really interesting plot guaranteed to drive you insaneA nice, even charming side feature of the film occurs when Max is approached by a very friendly but odd person who asks him if he is Jewish. A few moments later, just like a regular customer of one of New York's fameous Mitvos-Mobiles, Max is praying and learning how to be a good jew.  He soon finds out that his good natured host is also using math to study jewish scripture.  Hold onto your sanity, now we are really off to the races.One sign I noticed of a low budget film was the bald skull cap that Max wore after he shaved his head. You could see wrinkles all over the poorly fitted prop.  I think you will like this film as it has many subtle touches.  I also enjoyed the opening graphics which looked like they were taken from some advanced work in mathematics.

Within these un-secured parallels  the questions still unanswered, yet closer to our minds, in a film considered a genius epic, undertaken within a maelstrom of mistrust and self-loathing analysis.Take for example, the duality expressed by our protagonist's immense desire for security and secrecy i.e. a multitude of door locks and his desire for complete academic openness, as indicators of man's classical battle between trust and distrust. Additionally, the total disregard of the venerable 216 as the true name of deity, while concerning himself with its focus on the idolatry nature of ""Pi"" reflects the demonic duality with angelic forces, as foretold in the Holy Bible.Upon viewing, one can plainly see the self-destruction of his computers as an attempt to free contemporary society from the rigors similarly dealt with in the Garden of Eden through serpents and rounded fruits, while the numbers bandied about through stock market manipulations clearly relates those presently living with post- Apocalyptic dissipation of our current days' diminishing totals. How clear it becomes to liken his being told ""Take a bath or there will be only chaos, never order"" to the societal cleansing required to re-structure contemporary life in a self-effacing manner.Only with a scrutinized vision can one interpret the film's depth and care for analysis and retribution toward self. When performing his mind cleansing lobotomy he relinquishes his hold on the structure and knowledge afforded to a select few while developing the ability to smile when speaking to a child. Are we not being castigated for viewing the world around us through our cerebral acuities while ignoring the passions of our heart? I think that the oft repeated visual of a removed brain being repeatedly stabbed and poked in rapid order affirms that query. The making of a classic film, told through symbolism and stretching the peripherals of our own boundaries can be clearly identified upon its viewing.The use of spiral to signify the epiphany of life and its continuing struggles help define the nature of this film as it meanders through Freud's cabal of Id, Super Ego, and the manipulative and societal securing Ego to both explain the intellectual struggles and shifting compasses of moral turpitudes with which we approach our lives. It is with these identifiable and subliminal messages of text and vision upon which this film operates. Its beauty, horror, and self-effacing mockery perhaps defines us and our search for placement in this and other possible universes perhaps more clearly than any other current film. The progress established through its parables and the questions raised through its visions are why ""Pi"" should be considered  a select film, best reserved for those seeking honesty and the hidden structure of the smallest pebble on Earth, while still bowing before the graces from beyond.",5,"""Pi"" as an Allegorical Explanation of Life",1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,3263,"['Pi', 'Allegorical', 'Explanation', 'LifeAs', 'film', 'concerned', 'explanations', 'life', 'inner', 'sanctums', 'reason', 'existing', 'man', 'role', 'borders', 'Pi', 'unravels', 'nebulous', 'borders', 'conveying', 'galley', 'allegories', 'mystic', 'bridges', 'religious', 'underpinnings', 'score', 'senses', 'successfully', 'opening', 'eyes', 'unrealized', 'passions', 'un-secured', 'parallels', 'questions', 'still', 'unanswered', 'yet', 'closer', 'minds', 'film', 'considered', 'genius', 'epic', 'undertaken', 'maelstrom', 'mistrust', 'self-loathing', 'analysis.Take', 'example', 'duality', 'expressed', 'protagonist', 'immense', 'desire', 'security', 'secrecy', 'i.e', 'multitude', 'door', 'locks', 'desire', 'complete', 'academic', 'openness', 'indicators', 'man', 'classical', 'battle', 'trust', 'distrust', 'Additionally', 'total', 'disregard', 'venerable', '216', 'true', 'name', 'deity', 'concerning', 'focus', 'idolatry', 'nature', 'Pi', 'demonic', 'duality', 'angelic', 'forces', 'foretold', 'Holy', 'Bible.Upon', 'viewing', 'one', 'can', 'plainly', 'see', 'self-destruction', 'computers', 'attempt', 'free', 'contemporary', 'society', 'rigors', 'similarly', 'dealt', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'serpents', 'rounded', 'fruits', 'numbers', 'bandied', 'stock', 'market', 'manipulations', 'clearly', 'presently', 'living', 'post-', 'Apocalyptic', 'dissipation', 'current', 'days', 'diminishing', 'totals', 'How', 'clear', 'liken', 'being', 'told', 'Take', 'bath', 'will', 'be', 'only', 'chaos', 'never', 'order', 'societal', 'cleansing', 'required', 're-structure', 'contemporary', 'life', 'self-effacing', 'manner.Only', 'scrutinized', 'vision', 'can', 'one', 'interpret', 'film', 'depth', 'care', 'analysis', 'retribution', 'self', 'When', 'performing', 'mind', 'cleansing', 'lobotomy', 'hold', 'structure', 'knowledge', 'afforded', 'select', 'few', 'developing', 'ability', 'smile', 'when', 'speaking', 'child', 'Are', 'not', 'being', 'castigated', 'viewing', 'world', 'cerebral', 'acuities', 'ignoring', 'passions', 'heart', 'think', 'oft', 'repeated', 'visual', 'removed', 'brain', 'being', 'repeatedly', 'stabbed', 'poked', 'rapid', 'order', 'affirms', 'query', 'making', 'classic', 'film', 'told', 'symbolism', 'stretching', 'peripherals', 'own', 'boundaries', 'can', 'be', 'clearly', 'identified', 'viewing.The', 'use', 'spiral', 'signify', 'epiphany', 'life', 'continuing', 'struggles', 'help', 'define', 'nature', 'film', 'Freud', 'cabal', 'Id', 'Super', 'Ego', 'manipulative', 'societal', 'securing', 'Ego', 'explain', 'intellectual', 'struggles', 'shifting', 'compasses', 'moral', 'turpitudes', 'approach', 'lives', 'identifiable', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'text', 'vision', 'film', 'beauty', 'horror', 'self-effacing', 'mockery', 'perhaps', 'search', 'placement', 'other', 'possible', 'universes', 'perhaps', 'more', 'clearly', 'other', 'current', 'film', 'progress', 'established', 'parables', 'questions', 'raised', 'visions', 'are', 'why', 'Pi', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'select', 'film', 'best', 'reserved', 'seeking', 'honesty', 'hidden', 'structure', 'smallest', 'pebble', 'Earth', 'still', 'bowing', 'graces']",N/A

He has intense headaches and is heavily self-medicated (""Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, adrenalin injections, high dose ibuprofen, steroids, Trager Mentastics, violent exercise, cafergot suppositories, caffeine, acupuncture, marijuana, Percodan, Midrine, Tenormin, Sansert, homeopathics - no results, no results""). After getting closer to an answer, his computer crashes in mid-printout, but the number is retained in Max's mind. Framed as sort of a mathematical thriller, Max is hounded by some Hassidic Jews who are searching for numerical meaning in the Torah, and some Wall Street types who try to bribe him with a new computer chip, for the number he now has in his head. After the suicide of his mathematical tutor, Max has more intense headaches, and Max destroys his computer.The photography uses some innovative techniques, including the ""Snorry cam"", and the recurrent pill-popping scene is also used in Aronofsky's next film (in color), ""Requiem For a Dream"". The film has some beautiful imagery, and some disturbing images, such as an exposed brain, reminiscent of ""Eraserhead"".The reasonably-priced DVD has a commentary by director Aronofsky, a commentary by actor Sean Gullette, deleted scenes, and other goodies.

He's a sympathetic character and it is a tribute to his fine acting that it was possible for me to identify with him.The setting is the rundown area of New York's Chinatown, where our hero lives behind triple locked doors.  His computer takes up a whole room and the only resemblance to any computers I've known in my lifetime is the fact that it has a screen and a keyboard.  The one person he trusts is his aging mathematics professor who has long ago given up looking for those patterns in numbers which have been searched for by madmen and scholars from the beginning of time.  A young Orthodox Jewish man befriends him and gets him interested in the secrets of numbers in the Torah.  There's also a high-profile Wall Street firm which wants to use his findings to make millions.  The plot might be strange but it moves with the speed of light and there's no time to stop and think about the logic of it all.  Before I knew it, I was drawn into the story which included some chase scenes through the New York subway system.Certainly, this is not a film for everyone.

Darren Aronofsky, writer and director of 'PI', has created a film that is every bit as engaging as its 'big' brothers - in reality, even more so.Mathematician Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is on a quest.  He is convinced that underlying the chaos of the stock market is a pristine order, a mathematical rule with which he can prove that everything can be reduced to numbers.  His mentor and teacher is Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), who was forced to give up his own investigations into PI when he suffered a mysterious stroke.Cohen's investigation takes him far beyond the gyrations of the stock market into the mystical Kaballah and an intense questioning of the basic nature of reality.  His tool for this journey is the silent, inanimate computer, Euclid, who seems to deconstruct Cohen's universe further with each strike of the return key.  Even when Robeson urges Cohen to take a break from a quest which is clearly destroying the mathematician, torturing him with horrific headaches and hallucinations, Max is unable to stop.  He is drawn step by step into the irrevocable gap between the sacred and the mundane.Made with reversal film which heightens the contrast between light and dark, the film provides a continuous flow of symbolic content which plays in harmony with the world of ideas from with it is drawn.  Ants and electric drills, computer chips and the swirls of cream in a cup of coffee all seem to have otherworldly referents.  Aronofsky and Gullette, by some strange archaic alchemy have managed to create the seeming of layer after layer of possible meaning.  To me the film itself becomes a non-repeating pattern where chaos mimics reality.This film satisfies on many levels, starting with a question, finding an answer, and then discovering the next question.  It is visually brilliant.  Film director Matthew Libatique proves himself a genius, and Matthew Maraffi's production design is amazing.  Euclid is created out of scrap and loose parts, but manages to take on a full life of its own.  The acting is simply perfect.  This is a film for late night coffee house conversations, appealing to both the paranoid and the believer.Notable additional contents of the DVD are two full length commentaries on the film one by Aronofsky and the other by Gullette.

76466,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,0784011796,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[0, 1]","The kindest thing I can say for this movie is that I watched it very intently for the nearly hour and a half that it ran.  Sometimes my interest wanes in movies, and I become distracted by other things, or I can be doing something else while watching the movie, and not miss anything.  This time, I didn't want to look away from the screen because I found myself mostly interested in what was going on, though I'm not really sure why that was, since I wasn't that deeply impressed by the movie.Being the sort of movie this was, I didn't know any of the actors, but I felt that Sean Guletter, who played Max, the main character, did a good job of portraying the paranoia that he was supposed to be feeling as the movie progressed.  There were others, whose names I can't remember, that also did a good job.  The man who portrayed Max's mentor was a good choice, and I felt he gave the movie more of a depth than it might have otherwise had.The general plot of the movie was that a mathematician was trying to find the numerical code that is embedded into everything in the universe, to solve the great riddle of the universe.  From this, everything else evolves, the Rabbi's who want to use Max to their own ends to decipher the Torah and find the true name of God, and the wall street fatcats who want to crack the stock market.  Intermixed with all this is Max's own hallucinations, caused by the severe headaches he's experienced ever since staring directily into the sun as a child, until he had lost his sight for a while.I had several problems with the movie; one of which was when Max's mentor told him about computers becoming aware of their own existence as they approached solving the riddle of the universe, and then they would self destruct.  Huh?  To me, that was an assumption beyond the ridiculous, and deeply detracted from any belief in the movie.  Another scene was one in which Max sits looking at a stock report running across his ticker, and is able to predict with 100% accuracy what the stocks will be at.  Another head shaker as far as I was concerned.Now, I don't mind movies that make you think a little bit at their conclusion, but generally, I like my movies to be like any other ticket I would buy.  You plunk down your money, you might not be sure of all the stops along the way, but when you get to the end of the line, you know where you are.  This movie presents you with an ending, but then right after that, it presents you with another one, not really leaving you knowing where you are.  Personally, I would have preferred if they had stopped with the first one, it made more sense to me that way.  Another thing, the ending was just sort of out there, they could have actually have put it in anywhere up to about a half hour earlier, and not really have lost anything in the story.I can't highly recommend this movie, but it did hold my interest most of the time, so I would at least recommend you rent it once, just to see for yourself.  I'm glad I saw it the one time, but it's not one I'll ever add to my collection.",3,"Has its moments, but still, ultimately fails",991094400,"05 29, 2001",2001,3055,"['kindest', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'watched', 'very', 'intently', 'nearly', 'hour', 'half', 'ran', 'Sometimes', 'interest', 'wanes', 'movies', 'become', 'distracted', 'other', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'watching', 'movie', 'not', 'miss', 'anything', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'found', 'mostly', 'interested', 'what', 'was', 'going', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'deeply', 'impressed', 'movie.Being', 'sort', 'movie', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'actors', 'felt', 'Sean', 'Guletter', 'who', 'played', 'Max', 'main', 'character', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'paranoia', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'movie', 'progressed', 'were', 'others', 'names', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'man', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Max', 'mentor', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'felt', 'gave', 'movie', 'more', 'depth', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'had.The', 'general', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'mathematician', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'numerical', 'code', 'embedded', 'everything', 'universe', 'solve', 'great', 'riddle', 'universe', 'everything', 'else', 'Rabbi', 'who', 'want', 'use', 'Max', 'own', 'ends', 'decipher', 'Torah', 'find', 'true', 'name', 'God', 'wall', 'street', 'fatcats', 'who', 'want', 'crack', 'stock', 'market', 'Intermixed', 'Max', 'own', 'hallucinations', 'caused', 'severe', 'experienced', 'ever', 'staring', 'directily', 'sun', 'child', 'had', 'lost', 'sight', 'while.I', 'had', 'several', 'problems', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'when', 'Max', 'mentor', 'told', 'computers', 'becoming', 'aware', 'own', 'existence', 'approached', 'solving', 'riddle', 'universe', 'then', 'would', 'self', 'destruct', 'Huh', 'was', 'assumption', 'ridiculous', 'deeply', 'detracted', 'belief', 'movie', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'Max', 'looking', 'stock', 'report', 'running', 'ticker', 'able', 'predict', '100', '%', 'accuracy', 'what', 'stocks', 'will', 'be', 'head', 'shaker', 'as', 'far', 'was', 'concerned.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movies', 'make', 'think', 'little', 'bit', 'conclusion', 'generally', 'like', 'movies', 'be', 'other', 'ticket', 'would', 'buy', 'plunk', 'down', 'money', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'sure', 'stops', 'way', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'line', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'movie', 'ending', 'then', 'right', 'one', 'not', 'really', 'leaving', 'knowing', 'where', 'are', 'Personally', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'had', 'stopped', 'first', 'one', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'way', 'thing', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'sort', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'actually', 'have', 'put', 'anywhere', 'half', 'hour', 'earlier', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'lost', 'anything', 'story.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'most', 'time', 'would', 'least', 'recommend', 'rent', 'once', 'just', 'see', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Movies are a driving force in entertainment. If a film is poorly done, we quickly realize it. We can think of such movies as celluloid equivalents of drawing stick men or happy faces. Others really entertain us, yet we rarely consider the art of how these were done. When a movie like Titanic costs $200,000,000, the implication is that throwing money at a project is all it takes. In fact, it takes a genius to work successfully on such a large canvas.At the other end of the spectrum are pictures such as Pi. These are works by talented filmmakers who, so far, have limited reputations and even less money. The cost of a score of these films costs less than the publicity campaign of one major studio release. In this low budget area, we often find true artistry, simply because lack of funds makes innovation a necessity. While the results are not always successful, the effort is always there.Pi, the story of brilliant mathematician whose work drives him to insanity, succeeds brilliantly. Filmed in black and white on location in Manhattan, it's a ""X files"" story of patterns, visions, covert operations, crashing computers, and Creation itself. Based on science theory rather than science fiction, it is frightening because it is possible.It has long been accepted that the Universe might be understood through mathematical equations. What Pi suggests is that the obsessive pursuit of such knowledge could drive someone to insanity. I suspect that it would, perhaps because it would make one so different and apart from the rest of humanity. As Sol, Sean Guilette gives a first-rate performance. It's often hard to have empathy for a character this obsessive and humorless, but Guilette manages to involve us, even when we've no idea where Sol is coming from.Director Darren Aronofsky, like others before him, may have set his career in motion with this little seen movie. His co-writer, Sean Gullette, is also Pi's star. The techno-industrial music by Clint Marsel is a rare example of a film's score being an integral part of the plot. This music, along with tight editing and good acting, causes some scenes to become so intense that you almost feel what the main character is feeling.For those viewers who like to step outside the mainstream, Pi is highly recommended.",5,"Superior, inventive thriller",1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2390,"['often', 'said', 'movies', 'are', 'art', 'form', 'really', 'believe', 'true', 'often', 'lose', 'sight', 'idea', 'Movies', 'are', 'driving', 'force', 'entertainment', 'film', 'poorly', 'done', 'quickly', 'realize', 'can', 'think', 'such', 'movies', 'celluloid', 'equivalents', 'drawing', 'stick', 'men', 'happy', 'Others', 'really', 'entertain', 'yet', 'rarely', 'consider', 'art', 'how', 'were', 'done', 'When', 'movie', 'Titanic', '200,000,000', 'implication', 'throwing', 'money', 'project', 'fact', 'genius', 'work', 'successfully', 'large', 'canvas.At', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'are', 'pictures', 'such', 'Pi', 'are', 'works', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'limited', 'reputations', 'even', 'less', 'money', 'cost', 'score', 'films', 'less', 'publicity', 'campaign', 'one', 'major', 'studio', 'release', 'low', 'budget', 'area', 'often', 'find', 'true', 'artistry', 'simply', 'lack', 'funds', 'innovation', 'necessity', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'successful', 'effort', 'always', 'there.Pi', 'story', 'brilliant', 'mathematician', 'work', 'insanity', 'brilliantly', 'Filmed', 'black', 'white', 'location', 'Manhattan', 'X', 'files', 'story', 'patterns', 'visions', 'covert', 'operations', 'crashing', 'computers', 'Creation', 'Based', 'science', 'theory', 'rather', 'science', 'fiction', 'frightening', 'possible.It', 'long', 'been', 'accepted', 'Universe', 'might', 'be', 'understood', 'mathematical', 'equations', 'What', 'Pi', 'obsessive', 'pursuit', 'such', 'knowledge', 'could', 'drive', 'someone', 'insanity', 'suspect', 'would', 'perhaps', 'would', 'make', 'one', 'so', 'different', 'apart', 'rest', 'humanity', 'Sol', 'Sean', 'Guilette', 'first-rate', 'performance', 'often', 'hard', 'have', 'empathy', 'character', 'obsessive', 'humorless', 'Guilette', 'involve', 'even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'idea', 'where', 'Sol', 'coming', 'from.Director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'others', 'may', 'have', 'set', 'career', 'motion', 'little', 'seen', 'movie', 'co-writer', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'also', 'Pi', 'star', 'techno-industrial', 'music', 'Clint', 'Marsel', 'rare', 'example', 'film', 'score', 'being', 'integral', 'part', 'plot', 'music', 'tight', 'editing', 'good', 'acting', 'scenes', 'become', 'so', 'intense', 'almost', 'feel', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'feeling.For', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'step', 'mainstream', 'Pi', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

76473,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0784011796,Michael Crane,"[3, 3]","""Pi"" is an outstanding and complex thriller with brains and structure.  For such a low budget film, this great movie shows you that greatness doesn't have to only come out of big budget films with well-known stars.  It is a film that gets in your head and stays with you long after it is over.This dark and quiet thriller is about Maximilian Cohen, a brilliant mathematician who believes that everything in life revolves around patterns and numbers.  For years he has been trying to find this pattern that could unlock everything we see and know.  He starts with the stock market, the ultimate system of ordered chaos.  The deeper he digs, the more insane he becomes.  And the more he finds out, the more danger he is thrown into.  The pattern itself proves to be just as deadly as the people who are after him.  The twists and complexity will leave you in awe.While this movie may be confusing at times, it still does its job and keeps us intrigued throughout the duration of the film.  The acting and writing is really remarkable.  Sean Gullette is very convincing as Max.  I don't think there is anybody else who could've gotten the job done.  Everybody else was also great in it as well.  The film is also a debut from Darren Aronofsky; and a powerful one at that.  Very well written and directed.  Some of the camera techniques are really great and allow you to get inside of the main character's head.The DVD is great as well.  The picture quality is really good, considering it is a black and white film.  (The black and white actually enriches the film more.  It would've been less effective in color.)  The sound is really great too.  Some of the extras are 2 commentary tracks, a behind the scenes montage, lost scenes, trailers, a music video, and more.  Very satisfactory.""Pi"" is a movie that requires you to think throughout the film and after.  It's a film that will mostly appeal to those who like quiet and unique thrillers.  There's no non-stop shootings or explosions in this movie.  And it's not a film that everyone is going to like.  However, seeing that the movie is only 85 minutes long, why not give it a shot?

Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 3]","When my parents came to visit to celebrate my father's birthday, my wife rented Pi, an ""indie sci-fi"" film as described by Netflix.  When I used those two words to describe the movie, he said, ""oh great, I've never seen an Indian science fiction movie!""Pi was not made by Indians.  And it's not really a science fiction movie.  It's more of a weird fiction movie, extrapolating a single idea and obsessing over it.  Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a brilliant, eccentric mathematician who is convinced he can apply the laws of mathematics to nature, and by proxy, the stock market.  Since the stock market is a reflection of humanity, which is a reflection of nature, he believes there is a pattern that can be mathematically predicted.  Predict the stock market and get rich, right?From the beginning, we're never sure why Max wants so badly to pursue this path to power.  Is he sick of being poor?  Perhaps it's to succeed where his mentor, Sol Robenson (Mark Margolis), failed.  Sol's stroke stopped him from puzzling out of the answer, which is precisely 216 characters long.And so we have two philosophies that are actually one and the same: that mathematics of sufficient scope IS nature. Or in other words, the entire universe could be predicted if we just had enough computing power to handle it.  Which could be interpreted as the definition of God.  This dichotomy manifests as the Kabbalist Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman) on one side and the corporate goon Marcy Dawson (Pamela Hart) on the other.  Meyer seeks to reclaim the connection with the heavens through the Tetragrammaton, the name of God, and he believes it's 216 characters long.  Dawson just wants Max to figure out the secret of the stock market, presumably to make a lot of money.  It's the old religion vs. science debate.The stark black and white film further delineates Pi's either/or approach.  It's so washed out that it begins to induce the migraines Max experiences as he gets ever closer to the truth.  Aronofsky is a master of translating human misery through visceral images, and the whip-snapshot sequences of Requiem for a Dream's drug addiction are in full evidence here. Even the soundtrack sounds similar, which plucks at the nerve endings in your gums with ever-increasing urgency.Pi isn't a bad film, but it's intellectually challenging.  There's precious little science in Pi, or valid mathematics, or even an accurate portrayal of Kabablism. It uses artistic license to make its point -- that the nature of God is beyond human ken - and ultimately beats the viewer over the head with it in the end.

When it finally came around to home video, I rented it and was blown away! How could this film not get national  attention? Was it because it was in b&amp;w? Was it because the actors were  basically unknowns? I don't think so, as so many famous movies have met the  same criteria. I beleive that it was the general, cerebral plot that  confused audiences and kept general theatres from playing this movie  nationally. It is one of the most evocotive, intense stories I've seen in  quite a long time. As the main character is drawn into this crazy  mathematical world of trying to solve the equation of PI, he systematically  withdraws from the world and descends into madness, much like Max Von Sydow  as the tortured artist in Hour of the Wolf.His only tie to reality is his  role model/mentor, an old mathematician who realizes in his twilight years  that he has squandered most of his life away trying to solve the unsolvable  problem of computing PI. He seems to want to save the main character from  ruining his life in the same fruitless pursuit;or is that really the  reason? The next stage in the story is why this film only gets 4 stars. It  turns out that in trying to decipher PI, the man comes across a repeated  pattern in the mathematical solution that could hold the real meaning of  biblical scriptures! Thus he is caught up in a war between 2 factions; one  that wants the solution and another that wants it supressed.It becomes a  cool X-Files type story, but deviates from what I thought was going to be a  movie strictly about the psychological breakdown of a man obsessed, which  would have made for just an equally engaging film!

76480,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0784011796,Mike Stone,"[23, 27]","&quot;Pi&quot; is a tough film to pin down.  Some people go in looking for a complex dissertation on number theory, an explanation of the magic code that will explain the universe, and the true name of God.  I think this tact is a mistake.  Sure, all of these elements and questions are here, but they're not meant to be taken seriously.  Director/writer Darren Aronofsky and writer/star Sean Gullette have distracted their audience with a nifty little McGuffin (Hitchcock's term for a device or plot element that drives the movie forward, but is inconsequential enough to be discarded after it's done its job).  The movie is not about the 216-digit number that Max accidentally stumbles across, and is nearly killed for.  What we're really watching is a portrayal of obsession.  What happens when one man puts on his blinders, plunges forth into the abyss, and nearly destroys himself in the process?I'm not going to tell you what happens, but I will tell you this: it ain't pretty.  Much of the stuff here is pretty gruesome.  Gullette looks every bit the tortured math genius: wild hair, constant 5 o'clock shadow, empty eyes, hunched posture, pale skin, bony fingers.  He begins the film as a tortured loner, and proceeds to descend from there into a state of self-imposed madness.  It is gradual, but palpable.  Gullette does a fine job detailing Max, showing his angst and torment quite clearly.  I would have liked, however, if he gave Max some humanity by also giving him some humour.  Thankfully there is some humour injected into this otherwise dark tale in other places.  Max is repeatedly confronted by what can only be described as a hip-hop Kabalist.  The character of Lenny Meyer adds some much-needed levity to the film.  He torments Max in coffee shops and on the street with his motormouth ramblings about how number theory intersects with the Kaballah.  Max, for his part, looks on with bemused frustration, further portraying his difficulty when dealing with actual people.Aronofsky, who is a proficient visual stylist, gets his first chance to shine here.  Techniques that he would later expand and abuse in the engrossing but ponderous &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; make their first appearances in this lower budget effort.  One particularly stylish device uses manic quick cuts to portray the rhythm and the ritual of Max taking his headache medicine.  It was overbearing when used in &quot;Requiem&quot;, but fits in nicely here.  It is repeated over and over, a technique Aronofsky also likes to employ with his dialogue.  There is one story that opens the film, about how when Max was a little boy he forced himself to stare into the sun, which pops up from time to time.  We don't understand the implications of this story right away (apparently it is the cause of Max's migraines), but after hearing it several times, and living with Max in his own personal hell, it becomes more potent.I usually not go for movies that double as surrealistic mood pieces, and judging from the other reviews here I wouldn't enjoy David Lynch's &quot;Eraserhead&quot;.  But &quot;Pi&quot; has a couple of my favourite cinema motifs: obsession, loneliness, and genius.  Throw in a healthy dose of mathematical theory (but not too much) and the remnants of a thriller plot and you've got a movie that dares to engage both your mind and your senses.[*Shakespeare's &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, 1.1.62-3]",4,No man's Pi is freed from his ambitious finger*,1002067200,"10 3, 2001",2001,3407,"['quot', 'Pi', 'quot', 'tough', 'film', 'pin', 'down', 'people', 'go', 'looking', 'complex', 'dissertation', 'number', 'theory', 'explanation', 'magic', 'code', 'will', 'explain', 'universe', 'true', 'name', 'God', 'think', 'tact', 'mistake', 'Sure', 'elements', 'questions', 'are', 'here', ""'re"", 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Director/writer', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'writer/star', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'have', 'distracted', 'audience', 'nifty', 'little', 'McGuffin', 'Hitchcock', 'term', 'device', 'plot', 'element', 'movie', 'forward', 'inconsequential', 'enough', 'be', 'discarded', 'done', 'job', 'movie', 'not', '216-digit', 'number', 'Max', 'accidentally', 'nearly', 'killed', 'What', ""'re"", 'really', 'watching', 'portrayal', 'obsession', 'What', 'when', 'one', 'man', 'blinders', 'plunges', 'forth', 'abyss', 'nearly', 'process', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'will', 'tell', 'ai', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'Much', 'stuff', 'here', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'Gullette', 'bit', 'tortured', 'math', 'genius', 'wild', 'hair', 'constant', '5', ""o'clock"", 'shadow', 'empty', 'eyes', 'hunched', 'posture', 'pale', 'skin', 'bony', 'fingers', 'film', 'tortured', 'loner', 'proceeds', 'descend', 'there', 'state', 'self-imposed', 'madness', 'gradual', 'palpable', 'Gullette', 'fine', 'job', 'detailing', 'Max', 'showing', 'angst', 'torment', 'quite', 'clearly', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'however', 'gave', 'Max', 'humanity', 'also', 'giving', 'humour', 'Thankfully', 'humour', 'injected', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'tale', 'other', 'places', 'Max', 'repeatedly', 'confronted', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'hip-hop', 'Kabalist', 'character', 'Lenny', 'Meyer', 'much-needed', 'levity', 'film', 'Max', 'coffee', 'shops', 'street', 'motormouth', 'ramblings', 'how', 'number', 'theory', 'intersects', 'Kaballah', 'Max', 'part', 'bemused', 'frustration', 'further', 'portraying', 'difficulty', 'when', 'dealing', 'actual', 'people.Aronofsky', 'who', 'proficient', 'visual', 'stylist', 'first', 'chance', 'shine', 'here', 'Techniques', 'would', 'later', 'expand', 'abuse', 'engrossing', 'ponderous', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'quot', 'make', 'first', 'appearances', 'lower', 'budget', 'effort', 'One', 'particularly', 'stylish', 'device', 'manic', 'quick', 'cuts', 'portray', 'rhythm', 'ritual', 'Max', 'taking', 'headache', 'medicine', 'was', 'overbearing', 'when', 'used', 'quot', 'Requiem', 'quot', 'fits', 'nicely', 'here', 'repeated', 'over', 'technique', 'Aronofsky', 'also', 'employ', 'dialogue', 'one', 'story', 'film', 'how', 'when', 'Max', 'was', 'little', 'boy', 'forced', 'stare', 'sun', 'time', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'implications', 'story', 'right', 'away', 'apparently', 'cause', 'Max', 'migraines', 'hearing', 'several', 'times', 'living', 'Max', 'own', 'personal', 'hell', 'more', 'potent.I', 'usually', 'not', 'go', 'movies', 'double', 'surrealistic', 'mood', 'pieces', 'judging', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'David', 'Lynch', 'quot', 'Eraserhead', 'quot', 'quot', 'Pi', 'quot', 'couple', 'favourite', 'cinema', 'motifs', 'obsession', 'loneliness', 'genius', 'Throw', 'healthy', 'dose', 'mathematical', 'theory', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'remnants', 'thriller', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'engage', 'mind', 'senses', '*Shakespeare', 'quot', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'quot', '1.1.62-3', ']']",N/A

Accusations that the film is more about numerology than mathematics miss the point by a mile, i.e. there is a vital scene in which the main character is plainly warned that his obsessive pattern search will lead him into the non-science desert of numerology;3. Max's search for the 216 digit name of God is not a simple descent into mystical hooey: his investigation of the Torah, like the stock market, is a search for an underlying pattern in a chaotic system. He is intrigued by the possibility of arriving at a fundamental insight into the universe by this discovery. Ultimately his fallacy is not the assumption that this pattern exists, but his presumption that his brain could encompass the entire world.Enough philosophy - the black and white photography is stark and unsettling, the minor characters are memorable (Lenny and Sol are standouts), the soundtrack is refreshingly modern and engaging without being obtrusive, and the whole is laden with a creepy atmosphere of cold cerebral obsession (this quality probably being the main reason people either love or hate this film).Reasons for some dissatisfaction might include the hallucination sequences being only vaguely delineated from the rest of the narrative, which causes some confusion, and the discontinuity of the plot, in which story and character are artfully sketched rather than fully filled out.The ending is also problematic, but it is unsatisfying only in as much as total comprehension of the universe by the human mind is an impossible dream.

The movie is entirely in black and white and attempts to portray an intense atmosphere of heady thought.  The central character Max Cohen is a mathematician obsessed with the quest for meaning in numbers.  He describes mathematics as the language of nature and notes the role of mathematics in explaining various natural phenomena.  In particular, he seems to be enamored of chaos theory (the idea that small changes in initial conditions may lead to large changes in outcome) and expresses the idea that the spiral is a universal form found in nature.  He lives alone in an apartment where he has set up a supercomputer (nicknamed ""Euclid"") that attempts to predict the stock market.  While obsessively working on these problems he encounters a Hassidic Jew who attempts to introduce him to the Kabbalah (a form of Jewish mysticism).  However, it is at this point that his mentor tells him that dabbling in such things amounts to numerology and that by leaving behind the trappings of scientific rigor he is moving into the realm of mysticism.  He is also followed by a group of people representing a large corporation who hope to use his discoveries to control the stock market.  It is while conducting his researches that he mysteriously finds a 216 digit number which may hold the key to the mysteries of the universe.  His mentor theorizes that his computer has attained consciousness and this number is highly important in that respect.  Followed by corporate Wall Street hopefuls and Jewish fanatics who hope to use this number believed to encode the name of God to bring the Messiah, and plagued by increasingly growing headaches, the mathematician faces an imminent crisis.  To see how this crisis is resolved (and ultimately unresolved) you must watch the movie.  Ultimately the movie asks us to question the very nature of reality and asks us why mathematics should pose such a profound tool in our understanding of that reality.

Two groups of people are also after this number:  A set of Jewish extremists and a set of vicious Wall Street brokers.  Then the race is on to see who can control the pattern of Pi.

76496,A1ZI8FWGLC2HJ3,0784011796,nutune,"[0, 0]","""Pi"" is Director Darren Aronofsky's dark, offbeat docudrama-like film about a delusional math whiz on a paradoxical quest to understand the world.Maximillian Cohen is fixated on pi, an irrational number that mirrors his state of mind as well as the nature of his ambition. He believes all truth can be explained by mathematical patterns, and sets out on an ambitious search for proof by applying his theory to the stock market. As he attempts to crack the market's code, Cohen goes to extremes to achieve a breakthrough at the expense of his stability.The rest of this review may be a spoiler, however, it's intended as an analysis of the artistic value of the work that many viewers have missed, including the person who wrote the movie's description. There is much more going on than meets the eye. If the events are taken at face value, a different picture emerges, one that is nonsensical.In Pi, Aronofsky simulates psychosis from the point of view of his main character: A bleak, obtuse, distorted and confusing world. The director's varied techniques portray Cohen's reality.By having Cohen narrate the story, Aronofsky slowly reveals the complexity of his protagonist, who commands the delivery of the story, but lacks insight concerning the events of his life. Cohen reads his time stamped journal entries in a monotone, punctuated with mathematical factoids and discoveries. Scenes appearing like Funhouse mirrors depict Cohen's warped perspective. A grainy, high contrast black and white picture symbolizes his harsh reality. While he's able to resolve complex equations, he is unable to process weightier matters, namely, the futility of his ambition.In his quest for truth, sub-plots depict Cohen either in a state of delusion or lucidity, placing the viewer on an experiential or voyeuristic psychotic ride. Cohen compulsively repeats, ""My mother told me never to look into the sun"", along with a confabulation involving his eyes that reveals an inflated self concept. These scenes segue into altered states with visual imagery of spinning, blinding light and unusual camera perspectives that create the illusion of looking into the sun. Cohen's utterance foreshadows the future.The paradox of Cohen's quest is the impediment his mind presents to his lofty ambition, dividing him against himself. Cohen's insatiable desire to grasp infinity sets him on a self-destructive course. Aronofsky uses various techniques to depict the vanity of Cohen's quest.As Cohen believes a breakthrough is imminent, the pace of events and the level of danger heighten commensurate with his psychotic episodes. Feeling entrapped, Cohen initially internalizes his anger, venting it on his uncooperative head for presenting an obstacle to his ambitions. He has seizure like events beginning with intense head pain that segues into psychotic episodes where he loses touch with reality. He beats his head when he's been racking his brain, applying an increasing degree of force and invasion. His neatly combed hair becomes disheveled then disappears, until he resembles a dark eyed, bald Frankenstein.A hallucinating Cohen probes his gray matter with a pen and with each press, a train whistle blows. When he probes too deeply, the whistle blares as he sees the train heading toward him. Cohen is momentarily horrified, cowering in a fetal position before beginning his quest anew.The increasingly reclusive and paranoid Cohen systematically cages himself, his research secrets and his prized possession Euclid, a supercomputer, within the confines of his quadruple-bolted studio apartment. As he views neighbors and other visitors through the distorted glass of the door's peep-hole, interactions outside mirror the lens of Cohen's mind, with faces and personalities resembling caricatures of the real persons.He tolerates and seems annoyed with a compassionate neighbor woman and child. A short lived acquaintance with Lenny, a Hassidic Jew, begins on the common ground of numerical patterns as a key to truth and sours as the paranoid Cohen ascribes ulterior motives to him. Other relationships turn from cordial or friendly to hostile. Examined carefully, it is clear these scenes are depicted as Cohen perceives them, and not as events occurred.Cohen's perceptions, that others are hindering his progress or attempting to steal his research, are depicted through unusual camera angles, distorted voices and faces, and scenes that fade to black. His systematic dosing of several medications, including one for schizophrenia, is given emphasis through rhythmic sound effects that mimic a musical score or pinball machine. Aronofsky confuses the viewer, mirroring Cohen's altered states, intentionally creating doubt as to what actually transpired.Cohen's world becomes so singularly focused that he sees everything within the context of his obsession with numbers. Even something as benign as a trail of bug droppings in his supercomputer necessitates microscopic inspection. Within a sample he discovers a pattern likened to a mythical secret of life. On a quest to become immortal, Cohen has a taste, believing he has attained an exclusive gift.  The warnings of a professor friend and a rabbi are met with defiant rebuttals from the unstoppable Cohen.The archetypal Icarus continues to soar until he melts down into a violent rampage within his apartment.  Cohen appears to attack his head violently enough to cause his own death.  But he emerges in the next scene appearing lucid, a hat covering his head. The conclusion sets up an endless loop or cycle of sorts, symbolic of pi, and includes a dose of optimism as Cohen is brought back to reality, at least for the moment.Aronofsky's depiction of the main character from within his mind is an unusual point of view from which the subject has been explored. Many of his techniques are artfully rendered.  He makes it difficult, however, to connect with Cohen. We are made to observe his frustration and self-deception, yet are kept at an emotional distance.The lack of connection may have been Aronofsky's intent. Cohen's relationships are limited to a superficial level. The friends and acquaintances who attempt to connect with him are unable to do so at any influential level, particularly those who are concerned with his well being. Aronofsky places the audience in the mind of these characters by creating distance.For his efforts in tackling the weighty subject of truth and allusions to impending disaster, Aronofsky fails to humanize the character and deliver a moral.  His character is a type of Icarus, yet his actions yield dissimilar consequences, making his meltdown anticlimactic.  Neither he nor anyone else is affected by his failed pursuit in any meaningful way. There is a hint of a moral at the end, as Cohen observes a mathematical prodigy and seems to have a reality check. He is slightly more human, yet the ending is flat.  A character experiencing this degree of turmoil ought to evoke strong emotions, not indifference.The dark quality of the film detracts from the content, including grotesque graphic scenes and language occurring in the context of delusions (about a half dozen occurrences late in the film), that goes from zero to sixty to zero without warning as Cohen continues his downward spiral.""Pi"" is the first of Aronofsky's films.

Shot in hi-contrast, grainy monotone, Pi has a beautifully edgy feel of film noir about it, and the performances of the small cast are outstanding.The black and white film, the quick, jerky shots and quirky camera angles boost the paranoid effect, and just like the mathematical patterns in nature, the narrative recurs methodically (there's an interesting contrast between Max, who believes everything in nature - including the stock market - can be reduced to a pattern and therefore predicted, and his former mentor who cries ""there's more to life than numbers!"").We see the world from the perspective of obsessive number theorist Max Cohen, whose routine-based life gives the film its rhythm. By a series of repeated actions - Max stating his assumptions, peering through his peephole, unlocking the five locks on his door, visiting a diner, riding the subway, popping his medication, tooling around on his computer, waking up with a bloody nose - we get a handle on the world inside the movie. But even this view is flawed: Max's grip on lucidity is punctuated by ever-more frequent and violent psychotic episodes, which are - well, seem to be - followed by hallucinations. Sometimes the only way of telling what's real and what isn't - is to judge by where you are in Max's daily cycle (i.e. ""Is it just after a psychotic reaction? Then this must be a hallucination"" etc.).Which kind of means you have to be concentrating the whole time to keep up with what's going on. Pi therefore isn't an easy movie to watch - it won't just wash over you.On the other hand, this very quality compromises any chance Pi might have to make a whole lot of sense. The supporting characters aren't well integrated - they can't be; the style of filming won't allow it, and it's even worse at aiding narrative - net result, you're left none the wiser about a lot of fairly central things: who are these bad characters from Wall Street, and why are they chasing Max? What about the Hassidic ""good guys"" (are they good guys?) and their theory that Max has unwittingly discovered God's true name in a number sequence? What point does the film make about it? What's the significance of the brain Max keeps hallucinating about? Why does he shave off his hair and start obsessing about something inside his head?Most importantly, why is the movie called Pi at all, when it's actually about spiral theory and the golden section?Questions, questions, questions. Maybe I'm over-analysing and the point is you're *meant* to let the film wash over you without making any sense. Pi is well enough executed and its sheer notion of rhythm and pattern (in the film as well as in nature) is interesting enough by itself to sustain the picture, so it gets a solid vote from me.",4,Stylish but confusing film noir,1017360000,"03 29, 2002",2002,2786,"['Well', 'dead', 'classy', 'sure', 'Shot', 'hi-contrast', 'grainy', 'monotone', 'Pi', 'beautifully', 'edgy', 'feel', 'film', 'noir', 'performances', 'small', 'cast', 'are', 'outstanding.The', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'quick', 'jerky', 'shots', 'quirky', 'camera', 'boost', 'paranoid', 'effect', 'just', 'mathematical', 'patterns', 'nature', 'narrative', 'recurs', 'methodically', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'Max', 'who', 'everything', 'nature', 'including', 'stock', 'market', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'pattern', 'therefore', 'predicted', 'former', 'mentor', 'who', 'more', 'life', 'numbers', '.We', 'see', 'world', 'perspective', 'obsessive', 'number', 'theorist', 'Max', 'Cohen', 'routine-based', 'life', 'film', 'rhythm', 'series', 'repeated', 'actions', 'Max', 'stating', 'assumptions', 'peering', 'peephole', 'unlocking', 'five', 'locks', 'door', 'visiting', 'diner', 'riding', 'subway', 'popping', 'medication', 'tooling', 'around', 'computer', 'waking', 'up', 'bloody', 'nose', 'get', 'handle', 'world', 'movie', 'even', 'view', 'flawed', 'Max', 'grip', 'lucidity', 'punctuated', 'ever-more', 'frequent', 'violent', 'psychotic', 'episodes', 'are', 'well', 'seem', 'be', 'followed', 'hallucinations', 'Sometimes', 'only', 'way', 'telling', 'what', 'real', 'what', ""n't"", 'judge', 'where', 'are', 'Max', 'daily', 'cycle', 'i.e', 'just', 'psychotic', 'reaction', 'Then', 'must', 'be', 'hallucination', 'etc', '.Which', 'kind', 'means', 'have', 'be', 'concentrating', 'whole', 'time', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'Pi', 'therefore', ""n't"", 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'just', 'wash', 'over', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'quality', 'compromises', 'chance', 'Pi', 'might', 'have', 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'sense', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'integrated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'style', 'filming', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'even', 'worse', 'aiding', 'narrative', 'net', 'result', ""'re"", 'left', 'none', 'wiser', 'lot', 'fairly', 'central', 'things', 'who', 'are', 'bad', 'characters', 'Wall', 'Street', 'why', 'are', 'chasing', 'Max', 'What', 'Hassidic', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'theory', 'Max', 'unwittingly', 'discovered', 'God', 'true', 'name', 'number', 'sequence', 'What', 'point', 'film', 'make', 'What', 'significance', 'brain', 'Max', 'hallucinating', 'Why', 'shave', 'off', 'hair', 'start', 'obsessing', 'something', 'head', 'Most', 'importantly', 'why', 'movie', 'called', 'Pi', 'when', 'actually', 'spiral', 'theory', 'golden', 'section', 'Questions', 'questions', 'questions', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'over-analysing', 'point', ""'re"", '*meant*', 'let', 'film', 'wash', 'making', 'sense', 'Pi', 'well', 'enough', 'executed', 'sheer', 'notion', 'rhythm', 'pattern', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'nature', 'interesting', 'enough', 'sustain', 'picture', 'solid', 'vote']",N/A

Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[17, 21]","Some information is simply not safe for us--not because there is something wrong with its  possession in the abstract, but because it is the sort of thing we humans are not well suited to cope  with. There are various things we simply ought not not to know. If we did not have to live our  lives amidst a fog of uncertainty about a whole range of matters that are actually of fundamental  interest and importance to us, it would no longer be a human mode of existence that we would live.  Instead we would become a being of another sort, perhaps angelic, perhaps machine-like, but  certainly not human.  -Nicholas Rescher, an essay entitled Forbidden KnowledgeIn his excellent book, Forbidden Knowledge (see Orrin's review), Roger Shattuck discussed the  persistence and continued relevance of one of the central themes of Western Civilization : the idea that  certain kinds of knowledge have been placed, quite specifically and intentionally, beyond our reach  because we do not have the capacity, at this time, to handle them, or to wield them responsibly.  I've  no idea if Darren Aronofsky had read Shattuck's book before making this movie, nor whether  Professor Shattuck has ever commented upon the film, but it perfectly illustrates the point.In Aronofsky's film, a brilliant young mathematician, Max Cohen (Sean Gullette), believes in several  precepts :(1) that mathematics is the language of the universe  (2) nature can be expressed in numbers, and  (3) there are patterns everywhere in nature.Most importantly, he believes that we should be able to perceive and interpret the patterns, to  comprehend the language, and that he is on the verge of doing so.  Yet, while patterns seem to emerge  at every turn, from a swirl of cream in a coffee cup to a seashell at Coney Island, the meanings of  these patterns remain maddeningly elusive.Meanwhile, both a vicious Wall Street henchwoman and a Hassidic Jew approach Max about his  work, the first thinking he's about to figure out the hidden patterns in the Market, the latter thinking  he can decipher the numerical code hidden in the Torah.  Max however has hit an impasse, including  crashing his computer, and turns to his mentor for help.  Like Max, he too was once a brilliant, cocky  young mathematician, but he's had a stroke and now just sits in his apartment playing the game of Go.And just in case all that isn't enough, Max has paralyzing headaches brought on by an incident from  his youth, an incident which evokes Daedalus :9:22. Personal note: When I was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So one  day when I was six, I did ... the next day I had my first headache.Whether physical or mental in nature, Max's headaches are soon accompanied by nosebleeds,  hallucinations, and a mounting sense of paranoia, as his grip on reality begins to slip away.Aronofsky achieves some sense of the disjointed and terrifying world that Max is living in by setting  the film in a decaying tenement in Brooklyn, shooting in Black and White, manipulating the film to  make it incredibly grainy, actually mounting a camera on Sean Gullette (the actor playing Max) so  that on tracking shots we're moving with him but looking right in his face, etc.  Some of these  techniques work better than others, but all serve to give the film such an unusual look that it is very  much its own distinctive world.But most of all there are the ideas.  Max's hubris--his belief that the universe's secrets are lurking just  beyond his line of sight or his chain of thought, and even more important, that he in particular has  been given the capacity to finally perceive them and that when they are revealed he will be able to  handle them--is shared by so many of the great heroes of our culture, from Adam and Eve to Dr.  Frankenstein, to Faust, and so on.  (Like Faust he even makes a deal with the Wall Streeters in order  to get a new, extraordinarily powerful processor for his computer.)  The message of the film, as in all  of its predecessors, that no matter the quality of the individual--no matter the genius, or the purity, or  the ambition--Man is simply not ready to share in these secrets, is so profoundly antithetical to our  Age of Reason that it is a pleasant shock to find an artist who's still resorting to it.  And, amazingly  enough, this mythical lesson is still just as powerful today as it has been throughout human history.You can't really discuss the end of the film without ruining it for first time viewers.  Suffice it to say  that the denouement is both shocking and inevitable.  This is a movie that not everyone will  like--mostly due to the unusual look of the film, Max's sometimes off-putting behavior, and some  genuinely disturbing images--but if you stick with it and at least accept the visual style, you'll be  treated to a compelling version of one of our oldest, but still most relevant, stories.GRADE : A+",5,read Roger Shattuck's Forbidden Knowledge

An intense obsession to discover the greatest secret of the universe is really more about greed than curiosity, and that's what this film clearly depicts. But this film is deeper than that, and weirder than that. In the end this genius, through a desperate act, gives up his faith in chaos by surrendering to chaos instead. And finally he is free. I think this film missed greatness by spending too much time on artsy filming and the sheer madness of the lead character, which is explained almost not at all.

76504,ALXZ64A9OAPJ8,0784011796,"Phrodoe ""Child Of The Kindly Midwest""","[38, 41]","Pi is one of the better independent low-budget films I've seen in the last couple of years. It's a strange, twisted, subversive film, which takes as its thesis the idea that it's possible to know too much, to ask too many questions, for one's own good. A good example is the troubled protagonist of Pi, played to chilling perfection by Sean Gullette, who struggles with both the outside world and himself in his quest for the ultimate knowledge -- an equation which will tie together everything, from the beginnings of the universe to the chaotic ups and downs of the stock market. He is spied upon by unnamed big business interests, hoping to cash in on the latter idea; he is spied upon by Hasidic Jews who hope to cash in on the former idea; both sets of spies add the perfect element of paranoia to the film, and convince you that there is far more going on here than meets the eye, far more going on than is being talked about. The ideas put forth in later scenes bear this out -- boy, do they! -- but I wouldn't want to spoil that for you. The events of Pi, especially in the later scenes, are so surprising that any discussion of the plot would be totally unfair -- like telling someone who hasn't seen Citizen Kane what Rosebud is. So instead I'll confine myself to theme and character, which are sort of intertwined in this film. Gullette's character is a genius mathematician (as you might expect), a child prodigy of sorts who has always, we are told by his narration, courted such dangerous ideas and notions...and has paid the price for his arrogance more than once. He suffers from migranes -- really serious, agonizing ones which give him nosebleeds and vicious hallucinations, and which no painkillers seem able to stop or tame. (In fact the depictions of the migranes are amongst the film's best sequences; I watched it with a friend of mine who suffers from such headaches, and he said that these scenes were pretty close to what he experienced, at least in the feeling those scenes evoked.) It is during or just after the onset of these migranes that Gullette's character seems to receive his greatest revelations and insights -- and here the filmmakers use a technique of showing bright light as the literal image of these insights, a bit of symbolism that is almost, but not quite, clumsy and overdone. I believe it's by their sheer conviction that it works that the filmmakers are able to pull it off at all. In fact, it's through the use of this symbolism (light=knowledge) that Pi does some of its best work. It's used to illustrate the thesis I mentioned earlier, that it's possible to want to know too much for one's own good; Gullette's character relates how as a child, he stared too long into the sun, possibly triggering his migranes and his gift for numbers at the same time...which is why both seem intertwined in his perceptions. The use of light in the migrane sequences, and Gullette's subsequent gifts of insight, not only are symbolic but provide foreshadowing -- is he staring into the sun again? If so, what damage will he do this time? And as the plot slowly reveals where it is going, those questions become not only more difficult to answer, but more unsettling to even ask.Pi was shot in black and white, which I find entirely appropriate. The harsh images created by the cinematography are a perfect echo for the harsh story, spoken in a language of such harsh rhythms...like the song a puppet sings when it siezes the strings of its own puppeteer. It may take more than one viewing to get everything out of this film, because there's a lot packed into it...but the more you watch it, the more rewarding it is. I would heartily reccommend Pi to any lover of experimental film.",4,No Safety In Numbers,981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,3720,"['Pi', 'one', 'better', 'independent', 'low-budget', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'strange', 'twisted', 'subversive', 'film', 'thesis', 'idea', 'possible', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'one', 'own', 'good', 'good', 'example', 'troubled', 'protagonist', 'Pi', 'played', 'chilling', 'perfection', 'Sean', 'Gullette', 'who', 'outside', 'world', 'quest', 'ultimate', 'knowledge', 'equation', 'will', 'tie', 'together', 'everything', 'beginnings', 'universe', 'chaotic', 'ups', 'downs', 'stock', 'market', 'spied', 'unnamed', 'big', 'business', 'interests', 'hoping', 'cash', 'latter', 'idea', 'spied', 'Hasidic', 'Jews', 'who', 'hope', 'cash', 'former', 'idea', 'sets', 'spies', 'add', 'perfect', 'element', 'paranoia', 'film', 'convince', 'far', 'more', 'going', 'here', 'eye', 'far', 'more', 'going', 'being', 'talked', 'ideas', 'put', 'forth', 'later', 'scenes', 'out', 'boy', 'do', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'events', 'Pi', 'especially', 'later', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'surprising', 'discussion', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'unfair', 'telling', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'what', 'Rosebud', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'confine', 'theme', 'character', 'are', 'sort', 'intertwined', 'film', 'Gullette', 'character', 'genius', 'mathematician', 'might', 'expect', 'child', 'prodigy', 'sorts', 'who', 'always', 'are', 'told', 'narration', 'courted', 'such', 'dangerous', 'ideas', 'notions', 'paid', 'price', 'arrogance', 'more', 'once', 'migranes', 'really', 'serious', 'agonizing', 'ones', 'give', 'nosebleeds', 'vicious', 'hallucinations', 'painkillers', 'seem', 'able', 'stop', 'tame', 'fact', 'depictions', 'migranes', 'are', 'film', 'best', 'sequences', 'watched', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'such', 'headaches', 'said', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'close', 'what', 'experienced', 'least', 'feeling', 'scenes', 'evoked', 'just', 'onset', 'migranes', 'Gullette', 'character', 'receive', 'greatest', 'revelations', 'insights', 'here', 'filmmakers', 'use', 'technique', 'showing', 'bright', 'light', 'literal', 'image', 'insights', 'bit', 'symbolism', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'clumsy', 'overdone', 'believe', 'sheer', 'conviction', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'fact', 'use', 'symbolism', 'light=knowledge', 'Pi', 'best', 'work', 'used', 'illustrate', 'thesis', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'possible', 'want', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'own', 'good', 'Gullette', 'character', 'how', 'child', 'stared', 'too', 'long', 'sun', 'possibly', 'triggering', 'migranes', 'gift', 'numbers', 'same', 'time', 'why', 'seem', 'intertwined', 'perceptions', 'use', 'light', 'migrane', 'sequences', 'Gullette', 'subsequent', 'gifts', 'insight', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'symbolic', 'provide', 'foreshadowing', 'staring', 'sun', 'again', 'so', 'what', 'damage', 'will', 'do', 'time', 'plot', 'slowly', 'reveals', 'where', 'going', 'questions', 'become', 'not', 'only', 'more', 'difficult', 'answer', 'more', 'unsettling', 'even', 'ask.Pi', 'was', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'find', 'entirely', 'appropriate', 'harsh', 'images', 'created', 'cinematography', 'are', 'perfect', 'echo', 'harsh', 'story', 'spoken', 'language', 'such', 'harsh', 'rhythms', 'song', 'puppet', 'sings', 'when', 'strings', 'own', 'puppeteer', 'may', 'take', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'get', 'everything', 'film', 'lot', 'packed', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'rewarding', 'would', 'heartily', 'reccommend', 'Pi', 'lover', 'experimental', 'film']",N/A

Not one of just a good story, cool ideas, nice visuals, but was well aware of the music and 'colors' and symmetry. Darren Aronofsky's debut film 'Pi,' based on the Greek letter and mathematical formula is a superb look into a genius' nightmare. Can we really call him genius? Perhaps, perhaps not, but he was teetering on insanity. If one is insane, I would hesitate to label genius on that person (more pressure). Although it looked at the religious aspect of numbers, it more specifically was about the Kabbalah in which, like the Greek letter system, the letters pertained to numbers. The Rabbis were, here, attempting to translate the Torah into numbers to attain the &quot;true knowledge&quot;, and then chasing our wizard around town. Likewise a powerful corporation is chasing him around with superduper high speed chips for his (commodore 64?) computer to punch out numbers faster in return of his work. Although I found the math part exciting, from Pythagoras to Archimedes and so on, they were small integrals to move the drama forward. What mattered mostly was the internal world of our friendly genius. A unique resolution to low budget film making it as stated &quot;When I was 6 years old, my mother told me not to look into the sun.&quot; He did! Everything went black, then white, then he regained his vision. But he could only see the world in black and white!! This is the key element in why he enjoys numbers because there are no grey areas (and!!) that the film is shown through his eyes, in black and white. Wonderful!!! What more can a film have?

I purchased Pi long ago off a bargain rack.  I hated it on the first view but thought there's something to this film I'm not getting.  It sat for years on the movie shelf, even making its way into the ""sell"" bin several times but I always pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.When we upgraded our system to HD I watched it again.  Now I hated it even more due to the intentional film style.  Back it went to the shelf but there was a nagging thought that I'm still missing something.Finally, one Saturday as I was deciding what movie to watch I saw Pi hibernating on the shelf.  I grabbed it and thought about watching it with the director's comments.  BINGO!!!!  Not only was Darren surprisingly entertaining, he explained with a dry wit all the things that drove me crazy in the film.  Plus he went into fun backstory detail how he was able to complete the movie on a $60k budget.  When I watched the movie again I was able to see the film from his POV and it went from no stars to five stars for me and became a personal favorite.For all those who enjoy the film and want to be entertained, watch the director's comments.

And, actually, everything they said was right. It's smart, it's fast-paced enough to leave the viewer  breathless, it's witty in its own twisted way, and it never shies away from  any of the gory details. It's a film that makes mathematics interesting.  It's informed by the Cronenberg/Giger axis of biomechanics, which cannot in  any way be a bad thing. So what was it about this film that left me cold?Two possibilities.1. Many people also priased its originality--  wrongly. Pi came out not long after the whole Bible Code scam, and much of  the underlying plot is patterned on the Bible Code. I can't recall whether  it had been exposed as a scam by the time Pi was conceived (which would at  least make it satire), which is throwing me off. I'm willing to give  Aronofsky the benefit of the doubt here.2. A simple problem  translating from big screen to small. It just didn't absorb me the way I  felt it would. I LIKE math.That's not to say there weren't elements  of the film that worked, and worked very well; Sean Gullette is an actor  from whom we should be hearing much more, the soundtrack is fantastic, and  Aronofsky may have a bright career in front of him if he can come up with  more original material.

This adds up to a shallow take on a profound subject, and it trades on the subject's genuine profundity in order to gives itself airs.

Both Orwellian and Kafka-esque in its mood, the film is photographed in black and white, which only enhances the moods of paranoia, delusion and  grandeur which Max exhibits.  The soundtrack will probably irritate most  viewers...much of the music sounds like nails scratching on a blackboard.  However, the soundtrack greatly adds to the story and accentuates  everything which Max experiences throughout the story.  Pi has some deep  concepts as well.  Many of us probably detested math, algebra and  trigonometry in high school.  Yet, Max explains mathematics as a form of  communciation in which everything can be expressed.  Too bad I never had  mathematics explained to me in this manner.  I might have shown more  interest in my homework.  Max's genius leads the viewer on a pathway to  hell as Max attempts to break the enigmatic code of &quot;216&quot;, and  fight for his life against Wall Street corporate thugs seeking his secrets,  and Ultra-Orthodox Hassidic Jews attempting to discover the secrets of God.

Ocassionally these sorts of arty farty movies are outstanding, occassionaly they are so-so, and sometimes they are a flop. This fits in the middle for me, with the following reasons.The idea was first class. A mathematical recluse, highly intelligent, with an existential existance, serching for a pattern to the stockmarket, and the natural world at large. He is ever so close to a complex formula he believes is the basis not only for the stockmarket, but for much of nature. The world has patterns, the language of nature is math, or so he believes. He has brief encounters with numerological sects, who somehow find out about him, and corporate thuggery, who want to steal his formulas for the stockmarket. (These experiences incidentally don't do a great deal with his tendancy to paranioa).But although these ideas are very good, the film never gets off the ground. The encounters with religious sects could have been done with more subtlety, and developed more carefully. People who encounter religious-like sects don't usually do so with all bells ringing, usually one is drawn in deep before the reality manifests itself (eg Eyes Wide Shut). The corporate thugs also aren't stupid, they needed to be portrayed more deceptively, and developed more carefully. The film overall has little structure, even though these ideas themselves are very good.And where is the escapist music? Where is the dreaming peace of the paraniod recluse? And the film needn't have been all dark; contrast light with dark, and the dark becomes more potent, and more meaningful.Arty movie, great ideas, but could have been so much better.",2,Had more potential,985305600,"03 23, 2001",2001,1666,"['was', 'trifle', 'disappointed', 'film', 'Ocassionally', 'sorts', 'arty', 'farty', 'movies', 'are', 'outstanding', 'are', 'so-so', 'sometimes', 'are', 'flop', 'middle', 'following', 'reasons.The', 'idea', 'was', 'first', 'class', 'mathematical', 'recluse', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'existential', 'existance', 'serching', 'pattern', 'stockmarket', 'natural', 'world', 'large', 'ever', 'so', 'close', 'complex', 'formula', 'basis', 'not', 'only', 'stockmarket', 'much', 'nature', 'world', 'patterns', 'language', 'nature', 'math', 'so', 'brief', 'encounters', 'numerological', 'sects', 'who', 'somehow', 'find', 'out', 'corporate', 'thuggery', 'who', 'want', 'steal', 'formulas', 'stockmarket', 'experiences', 'incidentally', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'deal', 'tendancy', 'paranioa', '.But', 'ideas', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'never', 'ground', 'encounters', 'religious', 'sects', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'subtlety', 'developed', 'more', 'carefully', 'People', 'who', 'encounter', 'religious-like', 'sects', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', 'so', 'bells', 'ringing', 'usually', 'one', 'drawn', 'deep', 'reality', 'eg', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'corporate', 'thugs', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'needed', 'be', 'portrayed', 'more', 'deceptively', 'developed', 'more', 'carefully', 'film', 'overall', 'little', 'structure', 'even', 'ideas', 'are', 'very', 'good.And', 'where', 'escapist', 'music', 'Where', 'dreaming', 'peace', 'paraniod', 'recluse', 'film', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'dark', 'contrast', 'light', 'dark', 'dark', 'more', 'potent', 'more', 'meaningful.Arty', 'movie', 'great', 'ideas', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better']",N/A

According to some of my more religious friends, a lot of this stuff isn't Biblically accurate, but I could care less.  The man doesn't believe in the existence of a higher power.  Everything is based in math and tangible principles.

Wait a minute, physics = applied math.  Basically, most physicists (theoretical or otherwise) buy into this.  Heck, anyone with a science background in their education knows this is the basis for all science.  Look at quantum mechanics and quantum physics: there was a proof of of the unifying theorems to be true, but I honestly didn't follow if peer review held up:[...]Even if not, the point is we keep finding mathematical equations that describe our universe given *some* assumption that usually doesn't quite hold.  This doesn't mean there doesn't exist some equation that perhaps is beyond our grasp.  A philosophical principle says we'll never know: if you are part *of* a system, you can never fully understand that system.  Take this example: if you are part of a 2D world, how can you understand and see it from a 3D being's point of view?  It's a little simple, but it's along those lines.  As 2D entities, we could probably make lots of observations, but our fundamental abilities to think and observe are limited.  We live in a world, a universe, a system that we are pieces of, part and parcel.  Remember Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?  Maybe just by thinking, and being aware of those thoughts, you changed something, very small, in this universe (part of you).WARNING: direct spoilers avoided, but per usual, some references to movie content made that some may want to avoid.Back to PI: it just takes the idea that a genius, Max, comes across a ""magic"" 216 digit number that is quite important.  Depending on your beliefs and interpretation, let's him completely understand this world, or see, or be ""God"".  Then he's got financial moguls and the Jewish religion after him.  Obviously they buy into this idea, too.What makes the movie work in my opinion is basic (and sudden, last-minute) character transformation.  Watch it and you'll see.  I personally can understand the moral (avoiding stating for spoiler reasons).  I don't agree, I'd personally prefer to understand, like Max :)I've seen this 4-5 times, usually showing it to someone who has missed it or one of the generation younger than me.  It never gets old.Oh, and it was made during the ""golden age of electronica"", so it's got a wicked soundtrack including songs by Orbital, Massive Attack, Clint Marshall, and more.  The music and cinematography also make the movie great to watch.  Max suffers from headaches ever since, as a child, he stared at the sun until he went (temporarily) blind.  With each headache, comes a blackout.

To do this he lives in a ""world within a world"" of his own where his personal (and almost alive, brings to mind HAL) computer is the size of his room and where he seems to be cabled-in with it as he tries for the breakthrough.But simoultaneously, the number he's looking for seems to be of great importance for a sect of Orthodox Jews who consider it to be the one that will unlock the secrets of god as well.Metaphysics meet science and science meets insanity in an incredible film that has already earned characterisations that range from classic to cult.And for good reason too. Shot entirely in black and white and on very low budget ""Pi"" reminds everyone that independent cinema remains the only true hope for the thinking viewers. The main character (you've never seen him before but you will agree he's a perfect match for the role) is ultra-convincing and the few other characters that appear are carefully casted and compliment the movie as well.Allthough i'm not aware if ""Pi"" won any awards for photography i would be shocked if it hasn't. Camera and photography-wise the film is an undisputed masterpiece. The director and crew have done an astonishing job to capture the claustrophobic story and throughout one has the feeling that he's watching this whole thing from up close.Numerology freaks as well as conspiracy theorists will have a field day with this as it's full of references from beginning to end.Some have criticised the ending, but think about it: how could you possibly end this film in a way that would ""universally"" satisfy the audience??? You simply can't. If you would that'd mean that you would have to come up not only with a great film but with the equation to end all equations as well, and i mean, come on, we're asking for a bit too much here.As i watched it i thought (halfway during the movie) that the end would be critical but eventually i realised that this is besides the point, as ""Pi"" intends to serve more as food for thought rather than offer answers. It intends to show a stranger's struggle for answers so it could function as a mirror for anyone seeking similar answers too. And it manages that in a very eerie way.

There are really no twists, not much mystery, but it has some holes. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie, that left me in the dark, but that didn't matter, b/c it didn't seem relevant to the story. A lot was left up to interpretation, but it didn't affect the understanding of the movie itself. I think a lot of the visuals were there just for the sake of being there, to maybe add some darkness to the movie, but not affect what the point is. It's really just the story of a man who challenges himself, but has come across something that is putting up a good fight. Max, the main character, is trying to find a pattern in the world, nature and everything. He uses math as his universal language , and Pi as his tool of comprehension.

76575,AEGBJ94DCVH5Y,0784011796,x_bruce,"[3, 3]","$60,000. That's not most film industry grunt's pay. To make a film on this kind of budget is incredible. To make a good film and create some charater to the look and sound is amazing. I take exception with the main review's sound and film quality scores of 2 out of 5. The quality of the film is grainy and the music is brash along with dark ambient washes of sound.While not breathtaking in terms of technology their effectiveness is central to the film. The other critical remark that really puzzled me regarded how accurate the mathematic models were and thus the film was poor.Let's step back. We aren't watching the story of applied mathematics with a $6 million dollar budget, we are watching a deeply personal work that exploits it's budgetary compromises.The 16mm format is grainy and frequently overlight, we follow a genius who is searching, or perhaps tormented, by the hypothesis that all life can be broken down to a mathematical formula.Sean Gullette's character Max is hounded by a Wall Street parasite and Hassidic Jews, both interested in his work for different reasons. His one friend, an old professor and seeming mentor is his one place where he can unwind but even that gets poisoned as the film progresses and results in tragedy.Max stared into the sun against his mother's advice as a child. After regaining lost sight he experiences headaches which as the film progresses are discussed and happen off camera but build in intensity and are visualized as torment.Nothing is as it seems in this mildly science fiction like film and in the end the resolution is as extreme and personal as the build.Pi is a difficult movie to explain, the film has a lot of interesting shots and visualizations of what Max is going through, much of it representational rather than the typical hollywood film that would smack you over the head with exactly what is happening because you are too stupid to figure it out from the story. Think the last scene of Minority Report which guts an otherwise good film.See Pi for the multilayered performances, philosophies and craft that went into this film. The person that transferred the graphic on the DVD probably made more money than Pi cost to make. That impresses me but it's Darren Aronofsky's at times impressionistic, sometimes surreal approach that combines with good acting to make for a terrific film - at any cost.",4,A Great Film On A Astonishing Budget,1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,2372,"['60,000', 'not', 'most', 'film', 'industry', 'grunt', 'pay', 'make', 'film', 'kind', 'budget', 'incredible', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'create', 'charater', 'look', 'sound', 'amazing', 'take', 'exception', 'main', 'review', 'sound', 'film', 'quality', 'scores', '2', '5', 'quality', 'film', 'grainy', 'music', 'brash', 'dark', 'ambient', 'washes', 'sound.While', 'not', 'breathtaking', 'terms', 'technology', 'effectiveness', 'central', 'film', 'other', 'critical', 'remark', 'really', 'puzzled', 'regarded', 'how', 'accurate', 'mathematic', 'models', 'were', 'thus', 'film', 'was', 'poor.Let', 'step', 'back', 'are', ""n't"", 'watching', 'story', 'applied', 'mathematics', '6', 'million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'are', 'watching', 'deeply', 'personal', 'work', 'budgetary', 'compromises.The', '16mm', 'format', 'grainy', 'frequently', 'overlight', 'follow', 'genius', 'who', 'searching', 'perhaps', 'tormented', 'hypothesis', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'mathematical', 'formula.Sean', 'Gullette', 'character', 'Max', 'hounded', 'Wall', 'Street', 'parasite', 'Hassidic', 'Jews', 'interested', 'work', 'different', 'reasons', 'one', 'friend', 'old', 'professor', 'seeming', 'mentor', 'one', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'unwind', 'even', 'poisoned', 'film', 'progresses', 'results', 'tragedy.Max', 'stared', 'sun', 'mother', 'advice', 'child', 'regaining', 'lost', 'sight', 'headaches', 'film', 'progresses', 'are', 'discussed', 'happen', 'off', 'camera', 'build', 'intensity', 'are', 'visualized', 'torment.Nothing', 'mildly', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'end', 'resolution', 'extreme', 'personal', 'build.Pi', 'difficult', 'movie', 'explain', 'film', 'lot', 'interesting', 'shots', 'visualizations', 'what', 'Max', 'going', 'much', 'rather', 'typical', 'hollywood', 'film', 'would', 'smack', 'head', 'exactly', 'what', 'happening', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'figure', 'out', 'story', 'Think', 'last', 'scene', 'Minority', 'Report', 'otherwise', 'good', 'film.See', 'Pi', 'multilayered', 'performances', 'philosophies', 'craft', 'went', 'film', 'person', 'transferred', 'graphic', 'DVD', 'probably', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'Pi', 'cost', 'make', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'times', 'impressionistic', 'sometimes', 'surreal', 'approach', 'combines', 'good', 'acting', 'make', 'terrific', 'film', 'cost']",N/A

The Computer gets attacked by real bugs leaving a mucously slime recalling what the Alien designed by HR Giger leaves behind.This is a wild one, my friends.The music utilized included the Massive Attack's now ubiquitous masterwork &quot;Angel&quot;.(Note to Readers: Pick up Mezzanine by the Massive.

(A real life mathematician long ago had determined that the stock market is more random as in random Browning Motion, by the by, using something closer to probability formulae--but, I digress) When he gets close to knowing that code--he's seen the number, he's printed the number and tossed it in the city park trash, he even has this 216 digit number in his subconscienceness--a group of Hassidic Jews who turn out to be a bit Mafia like and contrastly a group from an unnamed Corporation shows up. Further helping our hero to sink deeper into his mania, I might add.What happens? What?--me tell? See the film. I would tell you this, though.
