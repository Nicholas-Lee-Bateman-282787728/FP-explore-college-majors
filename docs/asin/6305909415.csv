I've not read Nightfall but I have read a couple of Asimov's Foundation books (Prelude to Foundation twice). I wanted to see if there were any movies out there of his work. Nightfall was the only one I found so far, so I wanted to check it out...Well, aside from cute Jennifer Burns and finding a few Space-y shots intriguing (for my 2nd star), I'm convinced it doesn't do the book justice---or rather it ruins it. Right away I thought, 'Serious? Low-budget, crappy, acting?, weak, 2000?...etc.' I thought part of it was made in 1970's. Really unfortunate I say. I wonder if they actually collaborated with the man for input or simply went from the book and applied their subpar film skills for such a work.I hope better Asimov films rise from truly talented filmmakers. I'm hoping for Prelude to Foundation 'cuz it's my favorite. And the actress shouldn't just be cute (sorry Jen), but cute AND a great actor.",2,Bleh...,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,1002,"['Probably', 'only', 'difference', 'average', 'review', 'here', 'mine', 'extra', 'star', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'Nightfall', 'have', 'read', 'couple', 'Asimov', 'Foundation', 'books', 'Prelude', 'Foundation', 'twice', 'wanted', 'see', 'were', 'movies', 'there', 'work', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'found', 'so', 'far', 'wanted', 'check', 'out', 'Well', 'aside', 'cute', 'Jennifer', 'Burns', 'finding', 'few', 'Space-y', 'shots', 'intriguing', '2nd', 'star', ""'m"", 'convinced', ""n't"", 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'rather', 'Right', 'away', 'thought', ""'Serious"", 'Low-budget', 'crappy', 'acting', 'weak', '2000', 'etc', 'thought', 'part', 'was', 'made', '1970', 'Really', 'unfortunate', 'say', 'wonder', 'actually', 'collaborated', 'man', 'input', 'simply', 'went', 'book', 'applied', 'subpar', 'film', 'skills', 'work.I', 'hope', 'better', 'Asimov', 'films', 'rise', 'truly', 'talented', 'filmmakers', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'Prelude', 'Foundation', 'favorite', 'actress', 'should', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'cute', 'sorry', 'Jen', 'cute', 'great', 'actor']",N/A

It was next expanded into a novel that received mixed reviews.  It has now further deteriorated into a dreadful film.This film was far below B movie standards.  Every element of it was poorly done.  I've seen better acting in high school assembly halls.  The screenplay was horrible with dialogue so bad it could make you retch.  The music was shrill and the sound quality poor.  The special effects were below 1960's standards.  Even the editing was poor.  The whole film was simply pathetic.Asimov's original theme of the battle between science and religion was almost completely lost in an attempt to make the story into a ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" adventure.  The explanation of why darkness fell on the planet centered on the eclipse of one sun, but failed to explain what happened to the other five.This film was abysmal.  I rated it a 2/10.

483005,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6305909415,Martin Asiner,"[25, 26]","When I first read Isaac Asimov's short story ""Nightfall"", I was stunned and left gasping at its powerhouse of a closing. When I finished watching the filmed version, I was also stunned and left gasping--but for quite different reasons. All the mystery and beauty of the short story that sought to explain a millenia old phenomenon of a planet's first and last nightfall was not only lost in the movie, but even on a technical level of competence, from the wretched directing of Paul Mayersberg to the incompetent acting of David Birney and David Carradine, this movie quite unintentionally presents both a challenge and a dilemma to those whose job it is to pass judgment on its merits. For truly abysmal efforts like ROBOT MONSTER or PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, these efforts nevertheless retain the saving grace of something that clicks with the audience, whether that something be the excessive exuberance of John Barrows waving his arms in a gorilla suit from ROBOT MONSTER or the perversely androgynous heavy-handedness of director Ed Wood in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Even 'bad' movies can have a style of their own that comes into play usually late at night in a marijuana filled college recreation room. But what separates the fun of enjoyable bad movies from the torture of having to sit through garbage like NIGHTFALL is the deadening seriousness of the collective hands of all concerned from director to writer to actor. In such movies as this, there is nowhere to be found any lightness of attitude or just plain old fun. It is as if such films serve only to remind the audience that there are indeed moments in our lives that call for infinite patience while someone drives sharp needles under our fingernails. Yet, I do not want to have to pay for such dubious pleasure.

Incredibly, the 2000 version of ""Nightfall"" is NOT the first movie 'based' (whatever that word may mean when it appears on a movie screen credit) on Asimov' classic parable/intellectual horror story.  A ""cheapie"" (cheaper than the 2000 version -- if that is even conceivable) version was released in 1988, directed by Paul Mayersberg, and starred David Birney, Sarah Douglas, Alexis Kanner, Andra Millian and died deservedly in the independent theaters after a one week run.  (I actually comprised the entire audience at one showing in LA.)  Contemporary reviews of the 1988 version have commented that the film seemed to have been written and filmed while the entire cast and production crew was stoned, one of four features that connects this version with the 2000 version, the second being that monumental effort was taken to expunge the film of any premise, plot, character or themetic similarities to Asimov's short story, the third that together these films do not merit one star, and the fourth, that they may be &lt;shudder> the first two of an inexorable twelve-year cycle of remakes (literary eclipses?) of the Asimov story, the next due in 2012.

This is the type of movie that Holywood producers see and think ""Well, if it was written as a book first, we might as well throw away the script now."" It gives a bad name to movies based on books.I have never read the original book, Nightfall, and have hardly touched any of Asimov's works, but this movie makes me want to keep away from any books by the ""Renowned"" and ""Award Winning"" author.The movie was obviously filmed in India and uses locals as extras. The only people with lines are Caucasian except for the two ""villains"" who spend more time making faces while speaking than they do making any sense of the lines they have been fed. David Caridine has never been a good actor. The ""Kung Fu"" series I consider a pathetic excuse for a joke. The only good thing about this movie is the art on the DVD/VHS cover.The leads are two caucasian women in mid-eighties clothing with bulky purses that contain laser-pistols. They use a modern telescopic camera lens on an antique telescope found in a cave; that would be laughable if they bothered to take a moment to exploit it a bit. Good or bad, not one person in this film is even slightly attractive. Whatever the producers of this film were thinking when they made it, or whatever they were on, it was really a huge waste of time and money.Don't waste your money on this...UPDATE!I read the short story by Isaac Asimov and watched the movie one more time... Suffice it to say, my first impressions were correct.In the original story, the people are on a planet that is surrounded by three suns and once every 3000 years there is a nightfall. The people are terrified of the dark and cannot even stand to pass through a dark tunnel for five minutes before going insane.The casting, as I mentioned before, is horrible. The acting is... well... there's not much here to mention.The movie tore apart what Isaac Asimov wrote (a suspensful thriller of a tale) and made it into a crappy wanna-be action flick that is about as fun as watching a toilet spin the dirty water down the hole in the bottom.My apologies to those who have seen this movie, even though I had nothing to do with the creation of it.My warning to all who hold a mild curiosity for this film.
