So clean, perfect rainy day movie. I love Doris Day and James Garner kept me glued to the screen, he was so incredibly handsome! Wasnt expecting the eye candy, and the chemistry between the two was so sweet, you can't help loving them. The comedic writing/acting and action was reminiscent of what we see today, you sort of don't feel like you're watching something so old, some older movies can seem kind of hokey. I think that is partly because today some people are so de-synthesized that vulgarity and rawness is what makes a movie funny for them, but this was a nice change.

502337,AJLW1DZSHOVGW,B00000IBME,"Elaine Campbell ""Desert Dweller""","[7, 8]","Because it doesn't try to imitate its great predecessor, ""My Favorite Wife."" And James Garner does not try to copy the impossible-to-be-copied Cary Grant. And Doris Day looks the other way from the delightful performance of Irene Dunne. THEY ARE ALL OFF TO A NEW START, ONLY FOCUSING ON WHAT'S BEFORE THEM, guided by the skilled director, Michael Gordon. The result is a very different approach to a wonderful story. And lots of laughs are to be had.For those of you who have seen neither film, the gist of the plot is that Garner's wife is believed to have died in a shipwreck five years before. One day after her being declared legally dead, and Garner remarrying (an aptly coy, slightly spoiled bratish Polly Bergen), guess who shows up? Not a new girl in town!Complications abound, and with them endless laughs. The name of the game here is slapstick: excellently and adroitly done. Day is exhuberant, and her comedic timing is at its best. Her facial expressions, especially when they are quick and unexpected, are hilarious. As for Garner, I think this film is one of his best. His flair for comedy stands out, and he is at his most engaging.Three cheers also for supporting cast members: who can imagine this film without the wry humanity of Thelma Ritter, the confused judge (with much reason) played by the ever-talented Edgar Buchanan, and Don Knotts, in one of the funniest scenes in film comedy as a timid shoe clerk waiting on his customer, Ms. Day.This is one I'll watch whenever I need a good laugh. Or just cheering up. It can't fail.Sadly, this story was in the process of being remade a second time at 20th Century Fox, with Dean Martin in the lead role, Cyd Charrise in Bergen's role, and Wally Cox in Knott's', when the other major star of the film met with an untimely death. Her name was Marilyn Monroe. It was dusted off and remade into this delightful brew a year later. Martin Melcher, Ms. Day's husband, was at the helm as producer, and, although their marriage eventually became mainly a business arrangement, he should receive great credit in forming, guiding and maintaining her career.",5,WHY THIS MOVIE WORKS!!,1038614400,"11 30, 2002",2002,2115,"[""n't"", 'try', 'imitate', 'great', 'predecessor', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'James', 'Garner', 'not', 'try', 'copy', 'impossible-to-be-copied', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Doris', 'Day', 'other', 'way', 'delightful', 'performance', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'THEY', 'ARE', 'ALL', 'OFF', 'TO', 'A', 'NEW', 'START', 'ONLY', 'FOCUSING', 'ON', 'WHAT', 'BEFORE', 'THEM', 'guided', 'skilled', 'director', 'Michael', 'Gordon', 'result', 'very', 'different', 'approach', 'wonderful', 'story', 'lots', 'laughs', 'are', 'be', 'had.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'gist', 'plot', 'Garner', 'wife', 'believed', 'have', 'died', 'shipwreck', 'five', 'years', 'before', 'One', 'day', 'being', 'declared', 'legally', 'dead', 'Garner', 'remarrying', 'aptly', 'coy', 'slightly', 'spoiled', 'bratish', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'guess', 'who', 'up', 'Not', 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'Complications', 'abound', 'endless', 'laughs', 'name', 'game', 'here', 'slapstick', 'excellently', 'adroitly', 'done', 'Day', 'exhuberant', 'comedic', 'timing', 'best', 'facial', 'expressions', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'quick', 'unexpected', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Garner', 'think', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'flair', 'comedy', 'stands', 'out', 'most', 'engaging.Three', 'cheers', 'also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'can', 'imagine', 'film', 'wry', 'humanity', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'confused', 'judge', 'much', 'reason', 'played', 'ever-talented', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film', 'comedy', 'timid', 'shoe', 'clerk', 'waiting', 'customer', 'Ms.', 'Day.This', 'one', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'whenever', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'just', 'cheering', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fail.Sadly', 'story', 'was', 'process', 'being', 'remade', 'second', 'time', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'lead', 'role', 'Cyd', 'Charrise', 'Bergen', 'role', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'Knott', 'when', 'other', 'major', 'star', 'film', 'met', 'untimely', 'death', 'name', 'was', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'dusted', 'off', 'remade', 'delightful', 'brew', 'year', 'later', 'Martin', 'Melcher', 'Ms.', 'Day', 'husband', 'was', 'helm', 'producer', 'marriage', 'eventually', 'became', 'mainly', 'business', 'arrangement', 'should', 'receive', 'great', 'credit', 'forming', 'guiding', 'maintaining', 'career']",N/A

This is a silly movie where the viewer is to expect James Garner to be insanely jealous because his wife was stranded on an island with another man after a plane crash.

502345,A276M3NSIY9B82,B00000IBME,Harry Brewer,"[3, 3]","Move Over, Darling was the first of two pairings for Doris Day & James Garner. Move Over, Darling is easily the best of the two. It was directed by Michael Gordon, producers were Aaron Rosenberg & Martin Melcher (husband to Ms. Day). Even Terry Melcher (son & later record producer for Paul Revere & the Raiders) co-wrote the opening credits song.The film opens with Ellen Arden (Doris Day) arriving in California on a U.S. Navy submarine. She's been missing for five years after a plane crash in the Pacific. Nick Arden (James Garner) is a lawyer who is (was) married to her. After five years he's having her declared legally dead so that he may marry Bianca Steele (Polly Bergen). Judge Bryson (Edgar Buchanan) oversees the case. He has only two scenes in the movie & he's hilarious in both.All the incidents stem from Nick Arden's new marriage to Ms. Steele & the arrival of Mrs. Arden. Ellen does everything she can to keep Nick's marriage from being consummated. Nick still loves his first wife & would rather be with her but he doesn't know how, or isn't brave enough, to tell his second wife who he would rather be with. A lot of comical situations occur throughout the movie. The biggest stems from the fact that there was a man on the island with Ellen for the five years. Steve Burkett (Chuck Connors) was the other man & he's not anything like the man that Ellen initially describes. She gets a shoe salesman (Don Knotts) to portray the island man.There are several bonus features included with the DVD. They are: ""The Amazing Road to Move Over, Darling"", ""Doris Day vs. Marilyn Monroe"", ""A Conversation With Polly Bergen"", a photo gallery & a 1911 film by D.W. Griffith from 1911 ""Enoch Arden"" Part 2"". If the film seems familiar, it is, it's a remake of My Favorite Wife that starred Cary Grant & Irene Dunne. This was also the film that Marilyn Monroe was working on when she passed away.

The most memorable scenes were of Marilyn Monroe swimming completly naked.  All were happy and swell on the set.  Then all of a sudden, Marilyn became ill and either showed up late on the set or called in sick too often.  This cost the production to much expense.  Ultimatly, Marilyn Monroe was fired and production of the film was shut down.  They were going to hire Lee Remick.  In a surprise turn of events, the frustrated Dean Martin had a change of heart and said that he would finish the film and then agreed he would do it only if Marilyn returned.  All agreed to return to the project.  But as bad fate would have it, Marilyn Monroe passed away from an accidental overdose.  Only 37 minutes of footage was useful.  The project was over.However, in 2001, American Movie Classics cable network aired a documentary, &quot;Marilyn Monore: The Final Days&quot; for the first time ever.  The 37 minutes of footage was professionally put together to make a mini-movie.  It was broadcast for the first time on American Movie Classics and it included the nude swimming scenes so beautifully and tastfully done.Now this &quot;Something's Got To Give&quot; film was brought back together again, but with a new cast and a new title, Move Over, Darling (1963).  Some of the original sets were used.The cast chosen: Doris Day, James Garner, Polly Bergen, Thelma Ritter, Fred Clark, Don Knotts with John Astin, Pat Harington Jr and Chuck Connors.

This is one of the few times where the re-make is better than the original. While the Grant/Dunne version is good, this one, to my complete surprise, is far better and far funnier.Directed by Michael Gordon, who also directed Ms. Day in ""Pillow Talk"", the film has a deft, light touch. It plays well as the light-hearted, romantic comedy that it is. Doris Day is delightful as the long lost wife and mother, believed to have been lost at sea, who is rescued from a desert island five years later and returns to her husband and family. Upon her return, she discovers that just that very morning her husband (James Garner) has had her declared legally dead and married another woman (Polly Bergen).The film focuses on the first wife's efforts to get her husband to tell his second wife that the first wife has returned. When the husband discovers, however, that his first wife spent those five years on the island with another man, Steve (Chuck Connors), and that they called each other Adam and Eve, jealousy rears its ugly head. Doris Day tries to defuse this by introducing a Casper Milquetoast type of guy (Don Knotts) as the Adam from the island, not knowing that her husband has already seen Steve and discovered him to be a hunk (Chuck Connors). There are a series of very funny scenes involving all of the parties in different conbinations. Doris Day's mother-in-law (Thelma Ritter), however, brings the nonsense to a head and its eventual, satisfactory conclusion.Doris Day is terrific as the long lost wife. Her perky, light comedic touch is perfect, and when she plays the part of a Swedish masseuse, she will have you laughing uproariously. James Garner is funny as the husband who must make a definitive choice. Thelma Ritter is perfect as the practical, no nonsense mother-in-law who ensures that all is well that ends well.

Koblentz,"[2, 2]","In Move Over Darling, Doris Day escapes from her ""Polly Purebread"" roles in films perfected with Rock Hudson, and comes into her own as a woman who tries to reclaim what was rightfully hers, with an all star staff providing all star comedic results in a perfect farce format.An updating of the Cary Grant-Irene Dunn film My Favorite Wife, this film also has the shadow of Marilyn Monroe's final and uncompleted movie ""Something's Got to Give"" (Monroe's inability to stick to a filming sequence ruined the project and her death ended all hope of salvaging the film), Move Over Darling has been regulated to an asterick on Day's well know film career, and was one of the last of 1960s comedies to make it to DVD format.The plot is pure Hollywood.  Doris plays Ellen Wagstaff Arden, who we meet immediatly after she has been rescued from a tropical Island for five years that she shared with another survivor of a ship wreck.  After revealing herself to she shocked mother-in-law (played to the hilt by Themla Ritter) Doris discovers that she has two problems.  The first is that just that morning her husband Nick (James Garner) has had declared legally dead so (this is the second problem) he can marry Bianca (Polly Bergen).  The film follows Doris as she tries to reclaim her husband (who would prefer Ellen over Bianca any day) who just can't seem to get out the words to tell Bianca that Ellen is still alive.  Also appearing in teh film at his comic best if Edgar Buchannan (sic) as the confused judge who has to sort out the whole legal mess.Move Over Darling is solid entertainment, beautiful sets, and well acted.

502385,AT07UZQQR7ZEH,B00000IBME,"Stephen H. Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[1, 1]","MOVE OVER, DARLING (1963) offers delightful romantic comedy fun for fans of Doris Day and James Garner.  This color and CinemaScope remake of the Irene Dunne-Cary Grant MY FAVORITE WIFE (1940) is so close to the B&W; original that WIFE's writers get screenplay credit.  DARLING is about a man (Garner) marrying his second wife (Polly Bergen) and honeymooning in a fancy Monterey hotel when his first wife (Day) shows  up alive after a several year's absence.  So we have a screwball comedy treatment of bigamy, with Bergen in suite C wondering why Garner keeps going to Doris in suite A or down to the hotel lobby for an all evening shave..Whole scenes here are duplicated in WIFE, sometimes with the same dialogue.  But I like DARLING more because it adds a wild car chase and a hilarious scene with Doris going in an open convertible through a carwash.  And the supporting cast here is spectacular:  Thelma Ritter, Fred Clark, Don Knotts, John Astin, Edgar Buchanan as the Judge, Chuck Connors as hunky ""Adam"", the list goes on.  All are wonderful.  WIFE cannot begin to match them, despite a good script.MOVE OVER, DARLING is not a musical.  There are no songs.  But this was the 1960's, when Doris was making romantic comedies with (ironically) Cary Grant or James Garner, and not musicals.  This started out as a vehicle called SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE, with Marilyn Monroe, and was left unfinished with Marilyn's tragic death in 1962.  It was revamped a year later into DARLING with Day and Garner and Bergen.  Complicating matters is that MY FAVORITE WIFE is itself a remake of the D. W. Griffith silent drama, ENOCH ARDEN (1911), based on the poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson!  That version plays complete at 35 minutes as a wonderful bonus with DARLING; it has been supplied from the Library of Congress.Besides all that exists of ENOCH ARDEN, liberal bonuses with MOVE OVER, DARLING include a behind-the-scenes filmmaking documentary, a Marilyn vs. Doris featurette, and a welcome chat with a still-beautiful Polly Bergen.  It's not a masterpiece, but still one of Doris Day's most enjoyable films.

Ms.Day was always at her best whenever she was paired with her friend Rock Hudson but on this occasion, she co-starred with James Garner. Still, in this delightful re-make of the Cary Crant classic ""My Favorite Wife"", she was surrounded by an all-star cast, making it one of her better ""Hudson-free"" efforts.The plot features the return of a beautiful woman (Day) who was beleived dead, but instead of jubilation, this event causes problems when it coincides with the departure of her now-remarried husband (Garner) on his honeymoon! Hi-jinks ensue!Although this film has it's moments, I think I would have preferred it in its original incarnation as ""Something's Got to Give"". This was the film that Marilyn Monroe was working on before she passed away and ""Ratpacker"" Dean Martin would have played the husband, while actor Wally Cox would have appeared in the role portrayed by Don Knotts in the Doris Day version. Due to  Marilyn's ""unreliability"", which caused costly shooting delays, production was stopped and the film was shelved.  After Marilyn's passing and Martin's departure due to other commitments, the decision was made to start from scratch.Doris and Garner do a fine job but I feel the teaming of Monroe with Martin, two ""sexual outlaws"", would have been explosive!",3,"Doris ,The Homewrecker?",1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,1384,"['marvelous', 'Doris', 'Day', 'romp', 'one', 'high', 'points', 'not', 'always', 'effective', 'film', 'career', 'Ms.Day', 'was', 'always', 'best', 'whenever', 'was', 'paired', 'friend', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'occasion', 'co-starred', 'James', 'Garner', 'Still', 'delightful', 're-make', 'Cary', 'Crant', 'classic', 'Favorite', 'Wife', 'was', 'surrounded', 'all-star', 'cast', 'making', 'one', 'better', 'Hudson-free', 'efforts.The', 'plot', 'return', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Day', 'who', 'was', 'beleived', 'dead', 'instead', 'jubilation', 'event', 'problems', 'when', 'departure', 'now-remarried', 'husband', 'Garner', 'honeymoon', 'Hi-jinks', 'ensue', 'film', 'moments', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'original', 'incarnation', 'Something', 'Got', 'Give', 'was', 'film', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'working', 'passed', 'away', 'Ratpacker', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'husband', 'actor', 'Wally', 'Cox', 'would', 'have', 'appeared', 'role', 'portrayed', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Doris', 'Day', 'version', 'Due', 'Marilyn', 'unreliability', 'caused', 'costly', 'shooting', 'delays', 'production', 'was', 'stopped', 'film', 'was', 'shelved', 'Marilyn', 'passing', 'Martin', 'departure', 'due', 'other', 'commitments', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'start', 'scratch.Doris', 'Garner', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'feel', 'teaming', 'Monroe', 'Martin', 'two', 'sexual', 'outlaws', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'explosive']",N/A

She ranked #1 at the box office in 1960 and from 1962 to 1964. So when ""Move Over, Darling"" was released in late 1963, Day was the biggest female star in the world! Though the film has a good (yet goofy and silly) plot I find it very enjoyable. Doris does extremely well as Ellen Wagstaff Arden (""Eve""), James Garner as Nicolas ""Nick"" Arden, Polly Bergen as Bianca Steele Arden, Thelma Ritter as Grace Arden, Fred Clark as Mr. Codd, Don Knotts as the Shoe Clerk, Chuck Connors as Steven Burkett (""Adam""), Edgar Buchanan as Judge Bryson, and John Astin as Clyde Prokey. This cast is superb, and the film gets a A to A- grade.Now the only reason I didn't give the film five stars was because I believe the film would've been better when it was titled ""Something's Got to Give"" (1962) and starred Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin, and Cyd Charisse. But after several refusals to show up for work, Monroe was fired. The studio (20th Century-Fox) offered the part to Kim Novak and Shirley MacLaine, whom both turned it down. Fox then assinged Lee Remick to the part. However, Dean Martin refused of Remick's casting and walked off the set. Eventually Monroe was re-assigned to the picture. Before filming re-began, however, Monroe died under mysterious causings on August 4, 1962 at the age of 36.But on the basis of the performances give by the stars of ""Move Over, Darling"", I suggest you buy the film and give it a must needed chance to shine.",4,Move Over Darling,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,1552,"['must', 'admit', ""'m"", 'bigger/more', 'respected', 'fan', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Doris', 'Day', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'comedienne', 'ranked', '1', 'box', 'office', '1960', '1962', '1964', 'So', 'when', 'Move', 'Over', 'Darling', 'was', 'released', 'late', '1963', 'Day', 'was', 'biggest', 'female', 'star', 'world', 'film', 'good', 'yet', 'goofy', 'silly', 'plot', 'find', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Doris', 'extremely', 'well', 'Ellen', 'Wagstaff', 'Arden', 'Eve', 'James', 'Garner', 'Nicolas', 'Nick', 'Arden', 'Polly', 'Bergen', 'Bianca', 'Steele', 'Arden', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'Grace', 'Arden', 'Fred', 'Clark', 'Mr.', 'Codd', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'Shoe', 'Clerk', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Steven', 'Burkett', 'Adam', 'Edgar', 'Buchanan', 'Judge', 'Bryson', 'John', 'Astin', 'Clyde', 'Prokey', 'cast', 'superb', 'film', 'A', 'A-', 'grade.Now', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'believe', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'when', 'was', 'titled', 'Something', 'Got', 'Give', '1962', 'starred', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Cyd', 'Charisse', 'several', 'refusals', 'show', 'up', 'work', 'Monroe', 'was', 'fired', 'studio', '20th', 'Century-Fox', 'offered', 'part', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'whom', 'turned', 'down', 'Fox', 'then', 'assinged', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'part', 'However', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'refused', 'Remick', 'casting', 'walked', 'off', 'set', 'Eventually', 'Monroe', 'was', 're-assigned', 'picture', 'filming', 're-began', 'however', 'Monroe', 'died', 'mysterious', 'causings', 'August', '4', '1962', 'age', '36.But', 'basis', 'performances', 'give', 'stars', 'Move', 'Over', 'Darling', 'suggest', 'buy', 'film', 'give', 'must', 'needed', 'chance', 'shine']",N/A
