1667788,A18D87U8CUN0F9,B00EMAGJOU,"Jason Harrington ""Trucker Hater Magazine""","[2, 6]","This was easily the most disappointing movie I have seen all year. I had expectations, as a fan of Michael Cera (and a fan of movies about hallucinogens); My expectations were that he would be making me laugh, and that in some way the film would be visually interesting, but no. The movie is supposed to be about acceptance, I think I read, like accepting people and some kind of togetherness type moral to the story. I started off just sort of bored for the first hour, then slowly built up a strong distaste for Cera's ill-prepared character, who I realize was designed to be annoying. But then, in the middle of the movie the same thing happened regarding my feelings towards Hoffman's character; I could not stand either one of them, even after they started their hallucinogenic journey or whatever. I, much like the characters, waited through the majority of their adventure to see how their hallucinogenic experience would go, only to realize there would be no slick visual interpretation of their experience, but rather just a long episode of the viewer being trapped on the outside of two wildly annoying characters, who could hardly make easy laughs seem fun (a dysfunctional hippie chick wandering the desert nude should not be rendered so unwatchable). I love art films, especially when the stories actually have resolution (which this mostly does have), but I would place ""Youth in Revolt"" at the top of the Cera filmography, and I would place Crystal Fairy below the bottom of the list in a place were I can hope to forget it ever happened. Really, I hated it that bad...and it was one of my top-5 films I wanted to see the most this year. I was prepared not to like it, but the boring parts were the only relief from the aggravating parts, and there were no other parts.",1,I hope Michael Cera never does this to me again,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,1784,"['was', 'easily', 'most', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'had', 'expectations', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'fan', 'movies', 'hallucinogens', 'expectations', 'were', 'would', 'be', 'making', 'laugh', 'way', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'visually', 'interesting', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'acceptance', 'think', 'read', 'accepting', 'people', 'kind', 'togetherness', 'type', 'moral', 'story', 'started', 'off', 'just', 'sort', 'bored', 'first', 'hour', 'then', 'slowly', 'built', 'up', 'strong', 'distaste', 'Cera', 'ill-prepared', 'character', 'who', 'realize', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'annoying', 'then', 'middle', 'movie', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'regarding', 'feelings', 'Hoffman', 'character', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'one', 'even', 'started', 'hallucinogenic', 'journey', 'much', 'characters', 'waited', 'majority', 'adventure', 'see', 'how', 'hallucinogenic', 'experience', 'would', 'go', 'only', 'realize', 'would', 'be', 'slick', 'visual', 'interpretation', 'experience', 'rather', 'just', 'long', 'episode', 'viewer', 'being', 'trapped', 'outside', 'two', 'wildly', 'annoying', 'characters', 'who', 'could', 'hardly', 'make', 'easy', 'laughs', 'seem', 'fun', 'dysfunctional', 'hippie', 'chick', 'wandering', 'desert', 'nude', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'rendered', 'so', 'unwatchable', 'love', 'art', 'films', 'especially', 'when', 'stories', 'actually', 'have', 'resolution', 'mostly', 'have', 'would', 'place', 'Youth', 'Revolt', 'top', 'Cera', 'filmography', 'would', 'place', 'Crystal', 'Fairy', 'bottom', 'list', 'place', 'were', 'can', 'hope', 'forget', 'ever', 'happened', 'Really', 'hated', 'bad', 'was', 'one', 'top-5', 'films', 'wanted', 'see', 'most', 'year', 'was', 'prepared', 'not', 'like', 'boring', 'parts', 'were', 'only', 'relief', 'aggravating', 'parts', 'were', 'other', 'parts']",Crystal Fairy & The Magical Cactus

The viewer, or better put, the viewer as voyeur of the mundane, is dragged through a series of events that barely have context or purpose.  There is no journey here, unless one considers a string of tedious, disjointed scenes a journey.  Michael Cera's performance is shallow and disappointing. He delivers his lines in a monotone.  He does not make the character of Jamie believable.  None of the characters of the three Chilean brothers is developed.  They are just there -- like extras.  I have no idea why three sweet and kind Chilean brothers would put up with an immoral, callous, self-absorbed, obnoxious jerk.

1667792,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00EMAGJOU,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 2]","WARNING: SPOILERSI didn't hate this film, but I almost did. The only thing keeping me from dropping the rating down to one star was the authenticity of the performances. Our two leads were incredibly annoying people, so that's not saying a whole lot, but I still give the actors kudos for being so believable.The movie follows Jamie (Michael Cera), your proto-typical American blowhard, vacationing abroad in Chile. He's pompous, self-absorbed, rude, loud, abrasive, and thinks you should be able to solve any problem by throwing money at it. He has no time to get to know people, let alone care about them. In fact, his number one goal is to score a famous drug -- a drink called San Pedro -- that can only be made from the skin of a special cactus. Along the way, Jamie's crew is joined by Crystal Fairy, a girl who encompasses every single hippie cliche you could ever think of, including but not limited to hairiness, free-spirited monologues, casual nudity, and an obsession with vibes and magical rocks. Needless to say, Jamie hates Crystal Fairy from the get-go, and the two of them struggle to find a way to co-exist on the journey to go get messed up on drugs.Writer/Director Sebastian Silva said the film was inspired by a true story, an experience he had that (according to the interview), taught him how to care for and connect with other people. This should be all you need to know in order to figure out where the movie is heading. Even though the script tosses in a few out-there surprises, they are all minor and mild and pretty much secondary to the story.In other words (here's the spoiler), the movie is basically about how Jamie learns how to appreciate Crystal Fairy's Free Love attitude. How does he do that? By taking drugs.Now, hey, I'm not going to sit here and say that you can't learn anything from drugs. People throughout history have claimed to have eye-opening experiences with them. However, drugs are essentially insular experiences, and it's really, really hard to translate a drug epiphany onto the screen without making it seem cheesy or fake. Likewise, Jamie's a jerk for many reasons, but the biggest of them is his mindless obsession to get the San Pedro drug. I guess it's supposed to be ironic that it is that same drug that shows him how to love Crystal Fairy? Maybe. It just seemed lazy and disingenuous to me. Like the drug was the cause of and solution to all of his problems (to crib from Homer Simpson).This is made muddier by the fact that Crystal Fairy, for all of her charms, IS a pretty annoying person. I have nothing against hippies per se, but she does plow through the trip like a meteor, and although she's constantly preaching about going with the flow and bending with the wind, she also sets herself up as the predominate presence. Even though she embodies a free-for-all, come-what-may attitude, she still insists that everyone follow her rules or accept her topics of conversation. While Jamie was an inexcusable jerk, his annoyance of Crystal Fairy wasn't based on nothing, that's for sure.But the movie doesn't want you to think that, and the final moments of the story are so casually dismissive that they seem tacked on solely for the sake of redeeming (or at least justifying) every annoying idiosyncrasy found in Crystal Fairy. It felt cheap and implausible.Only worth it for Cera's ability to so thoroughly play against type, as well as Hoffman's gung-ho performance, the rest of the film is shallow, hollow, and not even fractionally as insightful or meaningful as it thinks it is: pretty much like most drug experiences.",2,Are You An American Jerk?

1667794,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00EMAGJOU,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[12, 12]","This is a piercingly gentle tale of self-discovery and drugs. But it's not your typical drug movie - it's not wacky nor scary. It's not about the delights of drugs, nor the dangers.The always-fascinating Michael Cera plays a self-absorbed, insensitive college kid named Jamie who is on a quest to try mescaline. He travels to Chile and plans a trip to find the necessary cactus with some friends. He ends up being joined by a hippie girl full of cosmic consciousness, and they have a passive-aggressive battle over control of the road trip.This movie is utterly real, probably because it is mostly improvised. The small group of actors cobbled the story together in a week while living together in Chile, and then filmed it. It's based on a real experience and people that director Sebastian Silva knew. Gabby Hoffman, who plays Crystal, admits she was actually on mescaline when they filmed the drug trip scene.I've known people like this. I've been people like this. This movie is so awkwardly authentic that I found myself laughing and wincing at the same time (Jamie's fascination with Huxley's &#34;The Doors of Perception&#34; is an especially nice touch - it's so stereotypical). The drug trip is realistic, and it illustrates the fact that psychoactive drugs can cause changes in you - but not the ones you may have been expecting. The changes tend to be much less spectacular and much more private than people think.This is a movie about ego, perception, compassion, and realizing that the world is never quite like you want it to be.If you've never been through this chapter in your life, you will likely find the movie boring, anti-climactic, and maybe even poorly acted. But if you can relate to what's going on, this is one of the best movies of it's kind. Hell, it's one of the only movies of it's kind.",5,"If you've been through this yourself, you may love it.

1667798,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00EMAGJOU,Turfseer,"[0, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Chilean writer/director Sebasti&aacute;n Silva was successful with his auspicious 2009 debut, 'The Maid'. But here, with his sophomore effort, Crystal Fairy & The Magical Cactus, he proffers up a real vanity project, marked by unmistakable self-indulgence.Joining him in this slight affair is Michael Cera, whose star power obviously got the film bankrolled. Cera plays Jamie, an obnoxious version of himself. He finds himself at a party with a friend, Champa, in Santiago, Chile, where he scores some cocaine and boasts about his knowledge of Aldous Huxley's 'Doors of Perception'. He soon runs into Crystal Fairy, a hippie, earth-mother type, who isn't shy about disrobing in later scenes and showing off her hairy armpits. Jaime insults Crystal about her dancing abilities and jokingly mentions that he and his friend (along with his two brothers) will be taking a three hour trip to score some San Pedro cacti and its by-product: pure mescaline; it's mainly Jaime's plan, who intends to imbibe the psychedelic substance, at the beaches of the Atacama desert.Much to Jaime's chagrin, while driving to the town up north where they'll be looking for the cactus, Crystal calls and surprisingly informs Jaime that she'll be meeting him and the boys in town. Jaime ramps up his overbearing demeanor, as the group knocks on the doors of residents who have large stalks of San Pedro cacti, growing in their front yards. None of the residents seem to be interested in giving Jaime and his posse a piece so Jaime simply cuts off one and the group doesn't seem to be upset by his immoral actions.When the group finally arrives at the seashore, Crystal goes off by herself, communing with nature and Jaime boils some cactus and gets high on the mescaline. I understand that Cera actually did get high during the filming but none of his dreamy 'trips' are illustrated visually--he merely parades around the beach, making an ass of himself, as he did before. Later, during a campfire, Crystal reveals that she was raped, after being led away from some kind of new age gathering she was attending. Crystal also reveals that she works as a dominatrix, which doesn't seem to perturb any of Jaime's pals. As for the Chilean group, they really have little to do throughout the film, except ensure that Jaime, doesn't get too out of hand.Somewhere there's a solid, well-developed story here, but most of the lines are improvised and everything ends up rambling. Some judicious editing could have improved the story quite a bit, but Mr. Silva was probably having too much fun during the shooting of the film, to think about that. Silva has an ear for dialogue and certainly the Chilean landscape will keep your eyes glued to the screen.
