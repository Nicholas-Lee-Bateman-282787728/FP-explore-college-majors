510481,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B00000K4ZO,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[0, 0]","This is yet another delightful Tony Gatlif film on the life of the Rom people in Eastern Europe. This story (unlikeLatcho Drom--- VHS) is ostensibly at least, fiction. A young Frenchman named St&eacute;phane (Romain Duris) travels by foot (in winter) to Romania to find an obscure Rom singer whose recordings his father had sent him. His father disappeared from his life, and St&eacute;phane therefore believes he cannot go on until he finds her.In the process, St&eacute;phane meets and effectively joins a Roma family --- and falls hopelessly in love with a gorgeous woman.Fiction or not, overall, the film reflects the genuine condition of the impoverished Rom people of Romania --- including their lifestyle, music and joi de vivre. It's a look at Romania's totally delightful (albeit simultaneously despised) Rom subculture.Shot in the Romanian village of Cretulesti, the cast is largely composed of Rom people, some of them renowned musicians --- such as Izidor Serban, and his family Angela, Vasile and Ioan. Other great Rom talents are also included here. It's an all together fabulous creation.The story ends quite tragically, and also in all likelihood doesn't differ greatly from the Rom reality in rural Romania.The film is in French, Romanian and Rom, with subtitles offered in English, French and other languages.---Alyssa A.

510482,A28B47KE7UJDZH,B00000K4ZO,e1x56u$*w#,"[28, 31]","In an era when Hollywood has degenerated to the point of only being able to crank out such &quot;masterpieces&quot; as the Austin Powers series, &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot;, or recycling old ideas in new and even shoddier versions like &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and &quot;Walking Tall&quot;, it's reassuring to see that filmmakers outside the good ol' U.S. of A. can still manage to make films which deal with real human emotions rather than crass cynicism.This movie focuses on the story of a young Frenchman who inherits an old casette tape that his anthropologist father once made of a traditional Gypsy singer. Seeing her voice as a link to his dead father and a channel for his grief, he sets off on an obsessive quest to far-flung Romania in search of the songstress.Watching this movie which was shot entirely on location in the Romanian countryside, I was struck at how lucky we are these days, as until the end of the Cold War just a few years ago, an Algerian director shooting a film with a French actor in the wilds of Romania would have been a totally unimaginable thing. And it was a treat watching a film which is entirely in Romany (aka Gypsy) language, along with some French and Romanian.In Romania, the youth goes to a Romany (Gypsy) village. But being unable to understand even a word of each other's language, the villagers have fun making sport of him by heaping him with obscenitites. But eventually he does make friends and gradually becomes drawn into the fabric of Romany daily life. Along the way, we the viewers also come to experience and understand the carefree and spirited zest for life that permeates Romany culture.The film also includes a love story, but director Gatlif chooses to ultimately make his film a much larger commentary on the uncertain and difficult life for the minority Romany, given the ethnic tensions and discrimination they experience with the majority Romanians.So if you're sick of Hollywood's version of &quot;Reality&quot; and would like a glimpse at a fresh and different perspective on the world, I HIGHLY recommend this movie.-- But hurry! McDonalds has opened in Romania too, and you just know the crew for the next &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; flick can't be far behind!P.S. -- This film NEEDS a DVD version NOW!!",5,A breath of fresh air from outside the Hollywood cesspool,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,2306,"['era', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'degenerated', 'point', 'only', 'being', 'able', 'crank', 'out', 'such', 'quot', 'masterpieces', 'quot', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'series', 'quot', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'quot', 'quot', 'American', 'Pie', 'quot', 'recycling', 'old', 'ideas', 'new', 'even', 'shoddier', 'versions', 'quot', 'Starsky', 'amp', 'Hutch', 'quot', 'quot', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'quot', 'reassuring', 'see', 'filmmakers', 'good', 'ol', 'U.S.', 'A.', 'can', 'still', 'manage', 'make', 'films', 'deal', 'real', 'human', 'emotions', 'rather', 'crass', 'cynicism.This', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'Frenchman', 'who', 'old', 'casette', 'tape', 'anthropologist', 'father', 'once', 'made', 'traditional', 'Gypsy', 'singer', 'Seeing', 'voice', 'link', 'dead', 'father', 'channel', 'grief', 'off', 'obsessive', 'quest', 'far-flung', 'Romania', 'search', 'songstress.Watching', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'location', 'Romanian', 'countryside', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'lucky', 'are', 'days', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Algerian', 'director', 'shooting', 'film', 'French', 'actor', 'wilds', 'Romania', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'unimaginable', 'thing', 'was', 'treat', 'watching', 'film', 'entirely', 'Romany', 'Gypsy', 'language', 'French', 'Romanian.In', 'Romania', 'youth', 'Romany', 'Gypsy', 'village', 'being', 'unable', 'understand', 'even', 'word', 'other', 'language', 'villagers', 'have', 'fun', 'making', 'sport', 'heaping', 'obscenitites', 'eventually', 'make', 'friends', 'gradually', 'drawn', 'fabric', 'Romany', 'daily', 'life', 'way', 'viewers', 'also', 'come', 'experience', 'understand', 'carefree', 'spirited', 'zest', 'life', 'Romany', 'culture.The', 'film', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'director', 'Gatlif', 'ultimately', 'make', 'film', 'much', 'larger', 'commentary', 'uncertain', 'difficult', 'life', 'minority', 'Romany', 'given', 'ethnic', 'tensions', 'discrimination', 'experience', 'majority', 'Romanians.So', ""'re"", 'sick', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'quot', 'Reality', 'quot', 'would', 'like', 'glimpse', 'fresh', 'different', 'perspective', 'world', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'movie.', 'hurry', 'McDonalds', 'opened', 'Romania', 'too', 'just', 'know', 'crew', 'next', 'quot', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'quot', 'flick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'far', 'P.S', 'film', 'DVD', 'version', 'NOW']",The Crazy Stranger VHS
510483,A10LRVZJ2NUKTU,B00000K4ZO,Jesus Santos,"[0, 0]","The Movie Gadjo Dilo which is translated to The Crazy Stranger one can see the struggle of fitting in. The main character, Stephane, has to pretend to act like one of the gypsies in a small town filled with them so that he can chase after the singer his dad use to sing him when he was younger. As audiences we know what is like to have dreams, but in this movie we see the main character chasing his dream and even though communication is lacking throughout the movie we see how both characters laugh and enjoy each others presence.This movie is also set in a modern time since we constantly see translations of the way that teenagers and young adults talk. For instance, Stephane falls for a girl named Sabina who is portrayed as a whore for having left her husband and returning to town. In doing this she did something outside her culture which is frowned upon since woman are supposed to be obedient and tied down to one man. In this love scene we see their passionate love and we see their larger than life personality which makes the audience relate to these characters. Aside from that we see that their great flaw is one of exploring and redefining themselves which is why their attraction was so potent. All in all, audience can agree that the best part of this movie is that culture had a lot to do with the morals that were passed down, however, one must pave the way of the life we want to follow.",5,Art and Exile,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1410,"['Movie', 'Gadjo', 'Dilo', 'translated', 'Crazy', 'Stranger', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'struggle', 'fitting', 'main', 'character', 'Stephane', 'pretend', 'act', 'one', 'gypsies', 'small', 'town', 'filled', 'so', 'can', 'chase', 'singer', 'dad', 'use', 'sing', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'audiences', 'know', 'what', 'have', 'dreams', 'movie', 'see', 'main', 'character', 'chasing', 'dream', 'even', 'communication', 'lacking', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'others', 'presence.This', 'movie', 'also', 'set', 'modern', 'time', 'constantly', 'see', 'translations', 'way', 'teenagers', 'young', 'adults', 'talk', 'instance', 'Stephane', 'girl', 'named', 'Sabina', 'who', 'portrayed', 'whore', 'having', 'left', 'husband', 'returning', 'town', 'doing', 'did', 'something', 'culture', 'frowned', 'woman', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'obedient', 'tied', 'down', 'one', 'man', 'love', 'scene', 'see', 'passionate', 'love', 'see', 'larger', 'life', 'personality', 'audience', 'relate', 'characters', 'Aside', 'see', 'great', 'flaw', 'one', 'exploring', 'redefining', 'why', 'attraction', 'was', 'so', 'potent', 'audience', 'can', 'agree', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'culture', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'morals', 'were', 'passed', 'down', 'however', 'must', 'pave', 'way', 'life', 'want', 'follow']",The Crazy Stranger VHS

The French boy lands in a Gypsy village, hosted by an old man who is a musician and who promises to bring him to the singer the boy is looking for.  There is not a lot of complicated plot, but the charm of the film is seeing the culture.  Wow!  Visually and musically this is a feast.  I loved the costumes the women wore and had to wonder if they always dress that way....and where did they get these great fabrics?!  Then...there is the music.  It takes a while for the film to get into the music, but once they are invited to a wedding, you know you're on your way for a treat.There's a nice romance involved, between the boy and one of the Gypsy girls who is a breath of fresh air to any tired old movie goer.  She sings, she dances, she flirts, she curses, she runs naked through the woods.  No wonder the French boy falls in love with her; who wouldn't?The music and the open passion of the people is truly touching.  As difficult as their lives are, I envied them the freedom to express themselves as they do.  Howling at the death of a loved one, dancing at his grave, striking the ground with your fists....all seem more natural and much more preferable to me than the buttoned-up ways our culture marks such events.  It made me want to go there....although I know I won't.

Unfortunately this one has far less of the sublime music and tries to tell a story.  A young Parisian fellow travels to Romania to find a favorite Gypsy singer of his late father's.  He enters a Romany (Gypsy) village and is unable to leave, though I can't imagine why.  All the residents do is complain and curse in incredibly foul expletives.  Any child old enough to read should not be allowed to watch this endless barrage of foul profanity.  If a child is too young to read the subtitles then it would be ok since the dialogue is in Romanes, French, and Romanian.  The only redeeming feature of this film, other than the occasional musical moments, is the opportunity to view the life of an oft-ignored culture, but this film is a wholly unpleasant experience.",2,French guy gets stuck in Gypsy village,1041033600,"12 28, 2002",2002,934,"['Having', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'patient', 'non-narrative', 'pacing', 'Latcho', 'Drom', 'friends', 'tracked', 'down', 'other', 'Gypsy-themed', 'film', 'same', 'director', 'Tony', 'Gatlif', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'far', 'less', 'sublime', 'music', 'tries', 'tell', 'story', 'young', 'Parisian', 'fellow', 'travels', 'Romania', 'find', 'favorite', 'Gypsy', 'singer', 'late', 'father', 'Romany', 'Gypsy', 'village', 'unable', 'leave', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'residents', 'do', 'complain', 'curse', 'incredibly', 'foul', 'expletives', 'child', 'old', 'enough', 'read', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'watch', 'endless', 'barrage', 'foul', 'profanity', 'child', 'too', 'young', 'read', 'subtitles', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'ok', 'dialogue', 'Romanes', 'French', 'Romanian', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'film', 'other', 'occasional', 'musical', 'moments', 'opportunity', 'view', 'life', 'oft-ignored', 'culture', 'film', 'wholly', 'unpleasant', 'experience']",The Crazy Stranger VHS
