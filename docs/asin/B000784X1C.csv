Six-year-old Caitlin is a deeply disturbed child whose violent and disruptive behavior prevents her from attending school or day care with other youngsters. However, Special Education teacher Maggie Barnard  senses that there is a great intelligence in Caitlin, and she believes Caitlin can be taught if someone can find out how to reach her. However, not everyone Maggie works with agrees with her assessment, and as she attempts to break through the walls of anger and abuse that surround Caitlin's mind, she must also do battle with a system that sometimes does more harm than good to kids.This is  such  a well done movie and is a movie that  you find yourself watching again  and again,theres just  something so good about it!",5,WONDERFUL  MOVIE!!,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,870,"['woman', 'who', 'troubled', 'child', 'must', 'go', 'law', 'order', 'help', 'made-for-TV', 'drama', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'Six-year-old', 'Caitlin', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'child', 'violent', 'disruptive', 'behavior', 'prevents', 'attending', 'school', 'day', 'care', 'other', 'youngsters', 'However', 'Special', 'Education', 'teacher', 'Maggie', 'Barnard', 'great', 'intelligence', 'Caitlin', 'Caitlin', 'can', 'be', 'taught', 'someone', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'reach', 'However', 'not', 'everyone', 'Maggie', 'agrees', 'assessment', 'break', 'walls', 'anger', 'abuse', 'surround', 'Caitlin', 'mind', 'must', 'also', 'do', 'battle', 'system', 'sometimes', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'kids.This', 'such', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'movie', 'find', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'theres', 'just', 'something', 'so', 'good']",Untamed Love

877973,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B000784X1C,Don R. Holloway,"[0, 0]","This movie claims to be based on the book ""One Child"" by Torey Hayden, but I have read the book and this movie is a very superficial rip-off of the book. The movie overlooks many important details from the book and doesn't take time to properly develop the characters. If you read the book, you come away feeling like you have experienced something life changing. That's because Torey Hayden writes with such intense feeling and emotional depth. This movie barely touches the surface of what we find in the book. The movie, of course, is about a dedicated special education teacher who tries to break through the wall of defenses that this six-year-old girl has built up around her. The child has suffered so much abuse and neglect that she is incapable of trusting anyone. The movie doesn't spend enough time showing what this child was like before the teacher finally broke through to her. And the movie also doesn't spend enough time exploring the range of emotions that go through the mind of the teacher (as well as the other children) as the child slowly begins to emerge from her self-imposed emotional prison to join the real world. I have found that movies are almost never as good as the books they are based on. But at least some movies try to get close to what the book is saying. However, this movie doesn't even seem to try. It just glosses over the book in a half-hearted attempt to entertain its audience and toy with their emotions without giving them anything of real substance. Well, I say ""shame on them"". In my honest opinion you should forget this movie and read the book. The book was published in 1981 and is available through Amazon.com. If you read the book first, I can almost guarantee you won't like the movie. At least that was my experience.",2,An Uninspired Movie Based on a Very Inspiring Book,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,1772,"['movie', 'be', 'based', 'book', 'One', 'Child', 'Torey', 'Hayden', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'very', 'superficial', 'rip-off', 'book', 'movie', 'many', 'important', 'details', 'book', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'properly', 'develop', 'characters', 'read', 'book', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'have', 'experienced', 'something', 'life', 'changing', 'Torey', 'Hayden', 'such', 'intense', 'feeling', 'emotional', 'depth', 'movie', 'barely', 'surface', 'what', 'find', 'book', 'movie', 'course', 'dedicated', 'special', 'education', 'teacher', 'who', 'break', 'wall', 'defenses', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'built', 'up', 'child', 'suffered', 'so', 'much', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'incapable', 'trusting', 'anyone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'showing', 'what', 'child', 'was', 'teacher', 'finally', 'broke', 'movie', 'also', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'exploring', 'range', 'emotions', 'go', 'mind', 'teacher', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'children', 'child', 'slowly', 'emerge', 'self-imposed', 'emotional', 'prison', 'join', 'real', 'world', 'have', 'found', 'movies', 'are', 'almost', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'books', 'are', 'based', 'least', 'movies', 'try', 'get', 'close', 'what', 'book', 'saying', 'However', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'try', 'just', 'over', 'book', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'entertain', 'audience', 'toy', 'emotions', 'giving', 'anything', 'real', 'substance', 'Well', 'say', 'shame', 'honest', 'opinion', 'should', 'forget', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'book', 'was', 'published', '1981', 'available', 'Amazon.com', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'least', 'was', 'experience']",Untamed Love

I bought this movie, and I still think it's good. Kathy Lee Crosby plays the teacher, Maggie, and does a wonderful job. She lives with her boyfriend, and Kathy Lee is a special education teacher at a public school. One day she gets a new student, Caitlin, played by Ashlee Lauren, and she's a trouble child that was left by her mother at a young age, by abandonment. She ties her to a fence on the freeway and never comes back for her, so she's raised by her poverty stricken father, who is so poor he can't afford clothes and proper things for little Caitlin. She is only six years old, and she's is evil. She vandalizes property, smears excrement on walls and attacks other children in the classroom. The state has branded her as psychotic. When Maggie tests Caitlin, she realizes how smart she is, and finds that she is way above her age level. With love from her teacher, and patience, she turns herself around, and becomes a more ""tamed child"", and can function properly in class. Just when Caitlin is doing so well in school, she gets molested by her father's friend while in his care. Caitlin then has a major setback, but is so loved by her teacher, she comes around and survives the ordeal. Maggie does such an awesome job with Caitlin that she even challenges the law to help her be educated. This is a true story about what a person can do for someone else they feel is worth the time and effort. Because of this teacher, Caitlin got to live a normal life and be put into a normal classroom in just one year.",4,Untamed Love,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",2008,1603,"['was', 'made', 'television', 'movie', 'saw', 'teen', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'bought', 'movie', 'still', 'think', 'good', 'Kathy', 'Lee', 'Crosby', 'teacher', 'Maggie', 'wonderful', 'job', 'boyfriend', 'Kathy', 'Lee', 'special', 'education', 'teacher', 'public', 'school', 'One', 'day', 'new', 'student', 'Caitlin', 'played', 'Ashlee', 'Lauren', 'trouble', 'child', 'was', 'left', 'mother', 'young', 'age', 'abandonment', 'fence', 'freeway', 'never', 'back', 'her', 'raised', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'father', 'who', 'so', 'poor', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'clothes', 'proper', 'things', 'little', 'Caitlin', 'only', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'evil', 'property', 'excrement', 'walls', 'other', 'children', 'classroom', 'state', 'branded', 'psychotic', 'When', 'Maggie', 'Caitlin', 'how', 'smart', 'way', 'age', 'level', 'love', 'teacher', 'patience', 'more', 'tamed', 'child', 'can', 'function', 'properly', 'class', 'Just', 'when', 'Caitlin', 'doing', 'so', 'well', 'school', 'molested', 'father', 'friend', 'care', 'Caitlin', 'then', 'major', 'setback', 'so', 'loved', 'teacher', 'around', 'ordeal', 'Maggie', 'awesome', 'job', 'Caitlin', 'even', 'law', 'help', 'be', 'educated', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'person', 'can', 'do', 'someone', 'else', 'feel', 'time', 'effort', 'teacher', 'Caitlin', 'got', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'be', 'put', 'normal', 'classroom', 'just', 'one', 'year']",Untamed Love
