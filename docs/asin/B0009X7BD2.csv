While Lock Stock is probably most famous, it is more of a comedy-a smart funny crime comedy, and Layer Cake more edgy and brutal.Ultimately it becomes about XXXX's inadvertent road to freedom, a twisty road at that, and like the metaphor of the cake it is named after, isn't too substantial, though tastes and looks good.Daniel Craig is clearly going to be around, as he has built on the work he did in Road to Perdition, Munich and probably his upcoming Bond-ness.

915946,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B0009X7BD2,Andrew Desmond,"[56, 66]","""Layer Cake"" is of that increasingly popular film genre that goes by the loose title of British gangsterism.  ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" comes to mind although this film is more a black comedy than ""Layer Cake"" which strives to remain true to its roots.The essence of the film is that the lead character, XXXX, played by Daniel Craig is trying to retire from the drug trade.  He's had enough, is now comfortably well off and has played the game carefully and by the rules, to the extent that rules exist.  However, his retirement is postponed as he is drawn into an ever more complex web of intrigue and double crossing.  He finds himself being exposed to greater risk that he would normally accept.  He is forced to operate outside his comfort zone.The film is well placed and totally entrancing as the viewer is gradually sucked in to this nether world of crime.  His cohorts seem quite believable as do the lords of the game and the shadowy Bosnian mafia that lurks as a background threat.  The plotting is complex and the deals always tense with big stakes being played.  The film has ""street cred"".The film's ending is unexpected.

915947,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0009X7BD2,Andy Orrock,"[2, 2]","I saw the US Premiere of 'Layer Cake' on April 28, 2005 at the USA Film Festival in Dallas.  As an added treat, star Daniel Craig (who portrays the film's elusive, nameless protagonist) was there to give the film a brief (and I mean *brief*) introduction.  We had recently seen 'The Mother,' and we were blown away by Mr. Craig's acting abilities and taken in (like many others I'm sure) by those piercing blue eyes of his.  In 'Layer Cake,' Craig is as different as can be than the carpenter he played in 'The Mother.'  And, the buzz welling up around him right now as the next potential James Bond tells you everything you need to know about what the industry thinks of him: it's like betting on an undiscovered growth stock.I've read 'Layer Cake,' and I think Matthew Vaughn (producer of Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock...') and writer J.J. Connolly have done a great job getting a dense, detail-laden story onto the screen.  You've always got to leave something on the floor to get the essence of a story across.  On the minus side, that means that some of the book's richer characterizations - Morty (George Harris) and Gene (the great Colm Meaney) - had to get thinned out.  In the case of Morty, thinned *way* out.  He's a complex, hair-trigger brooder in the book.  In the film, he's maybe got 50 words throughout.  And my wife reminded me of the book's wonderful passages about Gene, trooping around London with a backpack full of bricks to toughen himself up.  We know in the film that Gene's a tough nut, but it's presented to us in quick swatches.On the plus side though, the book is filled with crosses, double-crosses and triple-crosses.  This serpentine path becomes a *lot* clearer on the screen frankly.  Especially the parts where the UK guys get tangled up with a Serbian crew.  The movie is smart to clarify focus on and clarify that part of the story line, which I thought was rather murky in the book.And, personally, I was not pleased to see the the parts of Master Cody (Dexter Fletcher) and sidekick Tiptoes (Steve John Shepherd) trimmed down.  Again, I understand the need to get a nice compact 104-minute movie, but I thought that Connolly's single best-written scene in the novel was a meeting between Craig's character and Cody in an old English barbershop, with Cody getting a haircut, pedicure, and straight-razor shave all while going through a faux, jingoistic rant to his barber about immigration, crime and other red-meat issues while portraying his buddy (Craig's character) as an English-less South American transplant.  And that doesn't begin to do justice to Connolly's writing of this scene.For those of you who have read the book though, you're in for a real shocker at the end of the film.  Vaughn and Connolly go for quite a different ending here, and it packs a very unexpected wallop.",5,Great adaptation of Connolly's novel,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,2837,"['saw', 'US', 'Premiere', ""'Layer"", 'Cake', 'April', '28', '2005', 'USA', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Dallas', 'added', 'treat', 'star', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'film', 'elusive', 'nameless', 'protagonist', 'was', 'there', 'give', 'film', 'brief', 'mean', '*brief*', 'introduction', 'had', 'recently', 'seen', ""'The"", 'Mother', 'were', 'blown', 'away', 'Mr.', 'Craig', 'acting', 'abilities', 'taken', 'many', 'others', ""'m"", 'sure', 'piercing', 'blue', 'eyes', ""'Layer"", 'Cake', 'Craig', 'as', 'different', 'can', 'be', 'carpenter', 'played', ""'The"", 'Mother', 'buzz', 'welling', 'up', 'right', 'now', 'next', 'potential', 'James', 'Bond', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'industry', 'betting', 'undiscovered', 'growth', 'stock.I', ""'ve"", 'read', ""'Layer"", 'Cake', 'think', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'producer', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', ""'Snatch"", ""'Lock"", 'Stock', 'J.J.', 'Connolly', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'getting', 'dense', 'detail-laden', 'story', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'always', 'got', 'leave', 'something', 'floor', 'get', 'essence', 'story', 'minus', 'side', 'book', 'richer', 'characterizations', 'Morty', 'George', 'Harris', 'Gene', 'great', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'had', 'get', 'thinned', 'out', 'case', 'Morty', 'thinned', 'out', 'complex', 'hair-trigger', 'brooder', 'book', 'film', 'maybe', 'got', '50', 'words', 'wife', 'reminded', 'book', 'wonderful', 'passages', 'Gene', 'trooping', 'London', 'backpack', 'full', 'bricks', 'toughen', 'up', 'know', 'film', 'Gene', 'tough', 'nut', 'presented', 'quick', 'swatches.On', 'plus', 'side', 'book', 'filled', 'crosses', 'double-crosses', 'triple-crosses', 'serpentine', 'path', '*lot*', 'clearer', 'screen', 'frankly', 'Especially', 'parts', 'where', 'UK', 'guys', 'get', 'tangled', 'up', 'Serbian', 'crew', 'movie', 'smart', 'clarify', 'focus', 'clarify', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'murky', 'book.And', 'personally', 'was', 'not', 'pleased', 'see', 'parts', 'Master', 'Cody', 'Dexter', 'Fletcher', 'sidekick', 'Tiptoes', 'Steve', 'John', 'Shepherd', 'trimmed', 'down', 'Again', 'understand', 'need', 'get', 'nice', 'compact', '104-minute', 'movie', 'thought', 'Connolly', 'single', 'best-written', 'scene', 'novel', 'was', 'meeting', 'Craig', 'character', 'Cody', 'old', 'English', 'barbershop', 'Cody', 'getting', 'haircut', 'pedicure', 'straight-razor', 'shave', 'going', 'faux', 'jingoistic', 'rant', 'barber', 'immigration', 'crime', 'other', 'red-meat', 'issues', 'portraying', 'buddy', 'Craig', 'character', 'English-less', 'South', 'American', 'transplant', ""n't"", 'begin', 'do', 'justice', 'Connolly', 'writing', 'scene.For', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', ""'re"", 'real', 'shocker', 'end', 'film', 'Vaughn', 'Connolly', 'go', 'quite', 'different', 'ending', 'here', 'very', 'unexpected', 'wallop']",Layer Cake

Instead of a tongue-in-cheek British crime comedy, this movie tries to show a realistic view of the various forms of underground crime in London.  The characters are gritty and human, the dialogue is snappy, and instead of random violence right and left with no consequences to show for it, every shooting, knifing and other killing in this film has a profound effect on the characters, who actually show remorse, nervousness and other honest emotions.Layer Cake will definitely appeal to fans of the aforementioned films, but don't expect a zany comedy.

That best describes LAYER CAKE, director Matthew Vaughn's (SNATCH) crime-drama about a man with no name who's need to get out of the drug running business leads him to a surprising end.Daniel Craig (CASINO ROYALE) stars as XXXX (he has no official name but one can surmise that it may have to do with a Faustish character). He wants out of his illegal drug profession but is swept back into play by a large market intro of ecstasy by a wacked-out guy named the Duke (Jamie Foreman). XXXX's boss orders him to meet with the Duke and to find out what happened to a friend's daughter who'd disappeared with her boyfriend.Come to find out, XXXX's boss is out to pull a fast one on this supposed friend with the missing daughter by kidnaping her himself (should XXXX find her) and forcing a showdown that'll allow his boss sole access to the street-bound ecstasy.But an additional layer of deceit quickly gets piled on as we learn that the Duke stole the ecstasy from a very nasty character called Dragan. Dragan is not to be messed with, killing anyone or anything that gets in his way. We never see Dragan but only hear his ominous voice or the back of his head.Another layer is added as XXXX learns that his boss is actually a police informant and Craig's character is forced to kill him in order to survive -- something that wreaks havoc on XXXX's sleep and psyche ...for a while.XXXX's friends Gene (Colm Meaney) and Morty (George Harris) act as grounding forces that keep XXXX in line, until he kills their boss and Gene is forced to thrash him in order to get the truth from him.The final layer involves a sort of femme fatale named Tammy (Sienna Miller, CASANOVA) whom XXXX becomes infatuated with and will unknowingly bring about his downfall in the most ironic of circumstances (not having to do with drugs or money at all).An entertaining if overly drawn-out layering of plots that sometimes feel forced or contrived and other times hitting their mark, Layer Cake is an interesting look at Daniel Craig just prior to his rise to the 007 ranks.Personally, I prefer director Vaughn's aforementioned Snatch and his now cultish LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS to this flick.

Sadly, they are not done right here.  In ""Layer Cake,"" the actors cannot be faulted; they do a great job with the material.  The cinematography is interesting and very good.

I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone who liked the movie.  I don't care when a movie doesn't follow a book exactly, I try to judge the movie as it's own thing.  The book was so dense, with so much going on, a strict interpretation would be impossible.  You can't argue that the screenwriter didn't follow the author's intent either since J J Connolly wrote the screenplay.  I'm surprised at the degree to which the book and movie differed but I'm glad for this.  It allowed me to follow the plot and who's who while still enjoying the twists and turns.  The movie does move along quickly.  It's hard to catch some of the dialog which isn't always a problem but there were a few times I'm sure I would have been lost if not for the book.  I actually watched it through with subtitles after the first viewing.I thought the casting was good.  Daniel Craig did a great job, and I've always liked Colm Meany's work.

915960,A1V8ZE9BH0WTXE,B0009X7BD2,cinephiliagal,"[0, 0]","Like Fight Club, you never learn the name of the primary character -- played by Daniel Craig -- whose perspective Layer Cake portrays. (That is the ONLY thing it has in common with Fight Club, rest assured.)Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch grabbed a lot of attention as neo British gangster flicks, breathing new life into an old genre. And they do deserve the hype, imo.But Guy Ritchie's gangster films (except Revolver) have hearty senses of humour about themselves, as well as lots of gun wielding. Layer Cake and Sexy Beast (with an absolutely terrifying Ben Kingsley -- yes! -- as a psychotic head thug gangster) take themselves much more seriously, and therefore the violence that occurs is more viscerally affecting and less amusing and cartoonish.As a result, you're a bit more invested in the characters of Layer Cake, and the payoff is therefore different and somewhat more satisfying. This isn't to say Layer Cake is humor-less -- it isn't. But the humor is more subtle than the Guy Ritchie flicks; it doesn't smack you in the face so much as nudge you and wink knowingly. It's less slapstick and more satirical and cynical.Layer Cake has multiple intertwined stories because of the conflicting desires, motivations, and orders of the characters in the ensemble cast. The characters consist of higher up criminals who the Narrator (Craig, formally known as ""XXXX"" in the credits) sells drugs for, the Narrator himself, some corrupt law enforcement, and some amateur gangsters who want to jump into the big time. He's not at the bottom layer of the cake, but he's definitely got layers above him.However, the basic premise is one we've seen before: career criminal plans to pull major job and then retire happily ever after. But, thanks to the greed and machinations of rivals, superiors, and law enforcement, and a special side job he's supposed to take care of, nothing goes as planned. Thus the completion of his plans and his life, let alone his happily-ever-after retirement, are in jeopardy.The way that the plot manages to pull the rug out from under you with twists is not as important as the execution. The cinematography is gorgeous, the camera work is streamlined; not a shot is wasted, and almost everything shown is important to the plot later on.I love the kind of film where you have to PAY ATTENTION to truly get what's going on, and this is Layer Cake. If you try to surf the net or do other things while having this on in the background, you probably won't be impressed. But if you actually sit down to WATCH it, without distractions, you'll find plot points and criss-crosses galore to keep you guessing.Such a film doesn't have to perfectly resolve itself -- look at Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep, with Bogart and Bacall -- but it's amazingly cool that it captivates your attention WITHOUT massive violence, explosions, and gunfire. I need this more now than ever before.Maybe it's just me, but I've developed a sort of ""blockbuster movie fatigue"" caused by a steady diet of 90s-00s American blockbuster big budget films. They're always trying to top the one that came before with more/bigger special effects/CGI, tightly choreographed interpersonal violence/hand-to-hand combat, and some kind of large-scale mass destruction of big material objects or buildings, preferably employing major firepower and screeching metal.Eddie Izzard jokes in ""Dress To Kill"" that the Brits are known for ""the smaller films"" like ""A Room With A View of a Staircase and a Pond"", but his comparison of British and American films is particularly apt (and if you've never seen it, Google for it on Youtube; it's hilarious, as is Eddie).But I LIKE the fact that Layer Cake is tightly focused on what happens to a small, loyal crew of guys; I LIKE that the fate of the world or industrialized civilization doesn't ""hang in the balance"" -- like it unrealistically does in so many of those big, dumb, exciting blockbuster flicks. I LIKE that what Layer Cake has to say about the world, society and -- yes -- class can be told via the microcosm of the small(ish) world of the characters in the film.And I like the fact that the career criminal played by Craig is entirely non-thug-like; when he has to resort to gun violence, it's nowhere near as blase as it is in American movies (which is probably at least one reason why, come to think of it, I suffer from blockbuster fatigue). It gives Layer Cake a definite non-American perspective.(You *should* be upset by having to wield a gun or people around you doing so. Part of what's wrong here is that gun usage upsets no one and it's no big deal  -- and consequently tons more people are killed by guns in the US, even when you adjust for population, than in other first-world nations. I know; I work in an inner city ER, where far too many kids under 20 come in with gunshot wounds. Every day in Chicago, once the weather gets warm, multiple people are getting shot, some fatally. Which is why we are the murder capital of the US off and on, as we were in the 90s, vying with NY, LA and Detroit for top honors of most homicides. Sigh. Ok, off soapbox now.)Anyway, the (surprising?) humanity of the protagonist makes movies like Layer Cake and its characters so much more realistic than any blockbuster, despite all their stylized cool.And cool it is. The ensemble cast is great. Craig's character's two right hand men are played by Colm Meaney (ST: TNG and ST: DS9, as well as many other UK and US productions), and George Harris (you've seen him if you watch BBC programs on PBS or BBC America; he's been in lots of stuff). One of the amateurs is played by Burn Gorman (Bleak House, Torchwood). The plotting is pretty tight, including flashbacks you think are pointless, but are NOT.All in all, well worth your money for rental or purchase. If you like Lock, Stock and Snatch, you will probably like this. If you like Sexy Beast, you will almost certainly like Layer Cake.And while I'm at it, I'll recommend In Bruges as well, although it's almost an anti-gangster gangster flick in setting and execution, at least 2/3-3/4 of the way through the film... but is still wildly entertaining.There's more bathos in Guy Ritchie's flicks, and more pathos in Layer Cake, Sexy Beast, and (especially) In Bruges. But this is a genre I like -- neo-British gangster flicks -- and Layer Cake is an especially great specimen.Note: if you are not a native of the United Kingdom, you may need to watch Layer Cake multiple times to get all the dialog... or else put the subtitles on (I did both). It stands up to repeat viewing, definitely.",5,"a cool, assured spin on the neo-British gangster flick",1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,6607,"['Fight', 'Club', 'never', 'learn', 'name', 'primary',

""I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine.""This guy, identified as XXXX in the end credits, deals only in neatly wrapped kilos; he employs a smart chemist, a slick accountant and a loyal posse of heavies; he has a legitimate business on the side and he tools around London in a sleek silver Audi (station wagon).And while he might be a ""T-shirt and jeans"" kind of guy, he sports very expensive-looking T-shirts and jeans.Of course, the only reason crime thrillers stress the professionalism of their main characters is so we can watch as circumstances eventually force them to break their own rules and pay a stiff price.Those circumstances appear in the form of Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham) a grumpy upper-level gangster who summons XXXX and demands two sketchy favors of him. XXXX complies and quickly finds himself up to his earlobes in thugs, mols, Serbian assassins and the kind of bottom-feeders he likes to shun.""Layer Cake"" was directed by Matthew Vaughn, who previously produced Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."" All three movies have a lot in common but Ritchie's amped-up films bounce off the walls and onto the ceiling; Vaughn's is colder and more calculating - to use a Brit pop analogy, if Ritchie's movies are akin to the strutting, pub brawlers Oasis, Vaughn's is the orchestral-but-grooving The Verve.Eventually, though, the plot becomes ridiculously complicated. While it is possible to make sense of all the scams and double-crosses, the movie is a lot more interesting when it focuses on characters instead of twists and coincidences and two particularly exaggerated violent beatings. By the last act, the movie is just chasing its own tail... and yet, somehow, it's a hard movie to dislike.Despite its terrible title (a euphemism for the gangster hierarchy) but it oozes cool: XXXX is played by Daniel Craig who could almost be a gaunt, slightly freeze-dried Steve McQueen circa ""Bullitt"" ; the great Michael Gambon shows up as a phlegmatic, aging tiger of a mob boss; Sienna Miller wanders through long enough to model lingerie to the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" ; and though this is his first film, Vaughn really knows how to move a story along with style.If he can keep the plot from overwhelming the characters next time around, he might turn out to be a really good director.",4,"""Cake"" is overcomplicated but seriously cool",1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,2521,"['Even', 'name', 'never', 'revealed', 'course', 'British', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'get', 'know', 'hero', 'very', 'well', 'very', 'fast', ""'m"", 'not', 'gangster', ""'m"", 'businessman', 'commodity', 'be', 'cocaine', 'guy', 'identified', 'XXXX', 'end', 'credits', 'deals', 'only', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'kilos', 'smart', 'chemist', 'slick', 'accountant', 'loyal', 'posse', 'heavies', 'legitimate', 'business', 'side', 'around', 'London', 'sleek', 'silver', 'Audi', 'station', 'wagon', '.And', 'might', 'be', 'T-shirt', 'jeans', 'kind', 'guy', 'sports', 'very', 'expensive-looking', 'T-shirts', 'jeans.Of', 'course', 'only', 'reason', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'stress', 'professionalism', 'main', 'characters', 'can', 'watch', 'circumstances', 'eventually', 'force', 'break', 'own', 'rules', 'pay', 'stiff', 'price.Those', 'circumstances', 'appear', 'form', 'Jimmy', 'Kenneth', 'Cranham', 'grumpy', 'upper-level', 'gangster', 'who', 'XXXX', 'demands', 'two', 'sketchy', 'favors', 'complies', 'quickly', 'up', 'earlobes', 'thugs', 'mols', 'Serbian', 'assassins', 'kind', 'bottom-feeders', 'shun', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'was', 'directed', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'previously', 'produced', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'Snatch', 'three', 'movies', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'Ritchie', 'amped-up', 'films', 'bounce', 'off', 'walls', 'ceiling', 'Vaughn', 'colder', 'more', 'calculating', 'use', 'Brit', 'pop', 'analogy', 'Ritchie', 'movies', 'are', 'akin', 'strutting', 'pub', 'brawlers', 'Oasis', 'Vaughn', 'orchestral-but-grooving', 'Verve.Eventually', 'though', 'plot', 'ridiculously', 'complicated', 'possible', 'make', 'sense', 'scams', 'double-crosses', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'characters', 'instead', 'twists', 'coincidences', 'two', 'particularly', 'exaggerated', 'violent', 'beatings', 'last', 'act', 'movie', 'just', 'chasing', 'own', 'tail', 'yet', 'somehow', 'hard', 'movie', 'dislike.Despite', 'terrible', 'title', 'euphemism', 'gangster', 'hierarchy', 'cool', 'XXXX', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'gaunt', 'slightly', 'freeze-dried', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Bullitt', 'great', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'up', 'phlegmatic', 'aging', 'tiger', 'mob', 'boss', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'wanders', 'long', 'enough', 'model', 'lingerie', 'Stones', 'Gim', 'Shelter', 'first', 'film', 'Vaughn', 'really', 'how', 'move', 'story', 'style.If', 'can', 'keep', 'plot', 'overwhelming', 'characters', 'next', 'time', 'around', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'director']",Layer Cake

But there's one last job......there's always ""one last job"".I could watch this film over and over - it really is that good. British gangster/crime movies of the first decade of the 21st century seem to have been dominated by Guy Richie's manic, self-important creations. Layer Cake comes in under the radar as a more complex and thoughtful look at the seedier side of life, but (mostly) avoiding the crimes of pomposity or slapstick.First off, it's gloriously shot with some classic camera work, intimate and expansive by turn and a crackling backing track (fave scene is the drive to the club to the tune of The Cult's She Sells Sanctuary). Then the cast - a veritable who's-who of the (then) young turks and old guard of British acting. Craig strikes sparks off Michael Gambon (probably the best of the bunch here) and Kenneth Cranham, Jamie Foreman and Sally Hawkins add an element of unstable comedy value and George Harris and Colm Meany mix salt-of-the-earth chumminess with shocking savagery. Yes, some of these performances are a little OTT and the Richie heritage does show through; on the other hand, Craig plays his part just right as a nice-guy-baddie-with-no-name with a cheeky nod to his forthcoming Bond role. In fact, his performance in Layer Cake significantly tops anything he's done so far as 007.The story is good value too; typical crime caper stuff, multi-layered, pacy, ambiguous and amusing - lots to watch and lots to keep up with. Maybe it founders in its predictability but I'm not going to score it down for that - it's more than made up for by the glorious mosaic of actors, their faultless performances and the rich visual experience.Dialogue? There are some classic lines here - archetypal Britflic hard man stuff.

915969,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0009X7BD2,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","Boasting a whole litany of reasons for its R rating, Layer Cake delivers a hard-nosed, well-paced, intricate plot revolving around drugs, murder, and the games hoods of the three-piece-suit variety like to play.  I must emphasize the word intricate - not being a natural devotee of gangster films, I had a little trouble keeping up with some of the twists - there's a pretty large number of heavies involved here, and some of the guys' thick accents didn't make things any easier for me.  Basically, I just sat back and took everything as it came - even if it meant running into D just when I had figured out the connections between A, B, and C.  I'm not saying the movie doesn't make sense, though, because it does - it's just more complicated than your typical mindless thriller.  It is a nice change, however, to watch a movie that actually encourages the act of thinking on the part of the viewer.I'll get in trouble if I try to describe too much of the plot.  You've got this nameless dude (Daniel Craig), who's sort of upper middle class in the whole fancy gangster regime, who has no choice but to finally get his hands dirty on what he intends to be his last job.  First, he's got to find the girl of one of his boss's associates, and second, he's got to arrange for the sale of a cool million pops of Ecstasy.  Unfortunately, those drugs are in the hands of a big-mouthed flunkie calling himself the Duke, and he stole them from some tough Serbian joes who just aren't going to take that kind of thing lying down.  Things just don't go according to plan from the start, especially when our unnamed protagonist's own associates are liable to go off half-cocked at any given moment, but the whole mess is made even more complicated when another slimy fatcat joins the fun.  All of these people are connected, some going way back, but I would need several diagrams and about a half hour to explain all that.  All you need to know is that our anti-hero finds himself in a real bind, stuck between the drugs he can't get his hands on and one of Europe's most dangerous hitmen - and with friends like this fellow has, he really doesn't need any enemies.It's the ultimate game of survival for our protagonist, as he'll have to outwit, outplay, and outlast all of the other players in the game.  You have to sort of like the guy, just because everyone else is slimier than he is.  There's a girl in the mix, too, of course, but it's violence rather than nudity that wins this film its R rating.  All of these guys play for keeps, and it's inevitable that the weak and stupid get offed.  I would have liked to have seen more blood (as head shots really should be messier than they are here), but I certainly can't complain about the level of violence on display in Layer Cake.  The whole thing is a cool, sleek production with a darn good soundtrack (including the obligatory Gimme Shelter), a challenging storyline, and impressive performances by all concerned (with Michael Gambon, as you might expect, standing head and shoulders above the rest).

Problem is, he gets enmeshed in a theft of pills from a psychotic Serbian drug lord. The connection that puts Craig's character in the hot seat is dubious at best: he asked to move the pills by his supplier of cocaine and then the Serbian quickly assumes Craig is responsible for stealing the pills resulting in Craig on the run, trying to get out, etc. All this runs around in circles with the usual drug-dealer killing, shooting, chasing, fighting, that would be more interesting if slimmed down and better told.

Somebody there is a good programmer!). This British import, adapted by J.J. Connolly from his novel, is a taut crime drama that moves with the sleek menace of a tiger. Imagine THE BIG SLEEP with an ever-so slightly more coherent plot and, as its protagonist, a prosperous, wily drug dealer looking to retire after one last score instead of tough but noble private eye Philip Marlowe. Our hero's problem is that he's a careful, calculating businessman in a dicey business where he's surrounded by loose cannons who shoot, stab, or punch first and ask questions later. Director Matthew Vaughn has been best known as Guy Ritchie's producer, but in his directorial debut Vaughn is like Martin Scorsese to Ritchie's Barry Sonnenfeld (that's meant as a compliment to all concerned, I assure you). It helps that Vaughn gets excellent performances from Daniel Craig as our cool but in-over-his-head unnamed antihero (usually films and books that refuse to name their main character strike me as trying too hard to be clever, but it works here), Michael Gambon nearly stealing the show as a cultured but ruthless narcotics kingpin, Colm Meaney and THE INTERPRETER's George Harris as our protagonist's partners in crime, and many folks from Guy Ritchie's films. Sienna Miller doesn't get to do much beyond being eye candy, but she's tasty eye candy indeed. I'm as heterosexual a gal as they come, but after seeing lithe, leggy Miller strip down to black lingerie and garters, I couldn't help thinking, ""That Jude Law is one lucky guy!"" :-) One of the things I liked about LC is that the protagonist, while thoughtful and competent, is never quite as clever as he thinks he is; somehow everybody manages to be one step ahead of him, if only because they're all so damned unpredictable. Though I've only seen Daniel Craig in three of his many films (the other two were THE ROAD TO PERDITION and THE JACKET), he's clearly one of those actors who never looks or sounds the same from role to role, so if he does indeed end up being Pierce Brosnan's successor as James Bond as rumored, it'll be interesting to see how he fares playing the same character in more than one film! :-) In any case, Craig certainly lives up to the ""new Steve McQueen"" rep that LC has garnered him. I look forward to seeing what he'll do next.  The impressive stash of DVD extras include a making-of doc, a TIME OUT Q&A with Craig and Vaughn, an enjoyable and insightful commentary track by Vaughn and Connolly, the various posters considered, and enough deleted scenes to make a second movie.",5,Chameleon Craig Does a Steve McQueen in Brutal But Sleek Thriller,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2834,"['art', 'house', 'release', 'everywhere', 'else', 'civilized', 'world', 'LAYER', 'CAKE', 'LC', 'unexpectedly', 'premiered', 'area', 'Lehigh', 'Valley', '4', 'theater', 'Easton', 'joint', 'started', 'second-run', 'theater', 'been', 'getting', 'acclaimed', 'imports', 'indies', 'lately', 'too', 'Somebody', 'good', 'programmer', 'British', 'import', 'adapted', 'J.J.', 'Connolly', 'novel', 'taut', 'crime', 'drama', 'sleek', 'menace', 'tiger', 'Imagine', 'THE', 'BIG', 'SLEEP', 'ever-so', 'slightly', 'more', 'coherent', 'plot', 'protagonist', 'prosperous', 'wily', 'drug', 'dealer', 'looking', 'retire', 'one', 'last', 'score', 'instead', 'tough', 'noble', 'private', 'eye', 'Philip', 'Marlowe', 'hero', 'problem', 'careful', 'calculating', 'businessman', 'dicey', 'business', 'where', 'surrounded', 'loose', 'cannons', 'who', 'shoot', 'stab', 'punch', 'first', 'ask', 'questions', 'later', 'Director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'been', 'best', 'known', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'producer', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Vaughn', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Ritchie', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'meant', 'compliment', 'concerned', 'assure', 'Vaughn', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'cool', 'in-over-his-head', 'unnamed', 'antihero', 'usually', 'films', 'books', 'refuse', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'strike', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'clever', 'here', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'nearly', 'stealing', 'show', 'cultured', 'ruthless', 'narcotics', 'kingpin', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'THE', 'INTERPRETER', 'George', 'Harris', 'protagonist', 'partners', 'crime', 'many', 'folks', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'films', 'Sienna', 'Miller', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'much', 'being', 'eye', 'candy', 'tasty', 'eye', 'candy', 'indeed', ""'m"", 'heterosexual', 'gal', 'come', 'seeing', 'lithe', 'leggy', 'Miller', 'strip', 'down', 'black', 'lingerie', 'garters', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'Jude', 'Law', 'one', 'lucky', 'guy', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'LC', 'protagonist', 'thoughtful', 'competent', 'never', 'quite', 'as', 'clever', 'somehow', 'everybody', 'be', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'only', ""'re"", 'so', 'damned', 'unpredictable', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'three', 'many', 'films', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'PERDITION', 'THE', 'JACKET', 'clearly', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'never', 'same', 'role', 'role', 'so', 'indeed', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'successor', 'James', 'Bond', 'rumored', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'more', 'one', 'film', 'case', 'Craig', 'certainly', 'up', 'new', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'rep', 'LC', 'garnered', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'next', 'impressive', 'stash', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'making-of', 'doc', 'TIME', 'OUT', 'Q', 'A', 'Craig', 'Vaughn', 'enjoyable', 'insightful', 'commentary', 'track', 'Vaughn', 'Connolly', 'various', 'posters', 'considered', 'enough', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'make', 'second', 'movie']",Layer Cake

Layer Cake's heart is in the right place, with a setup so familiar it may as well have come straight from the same brainstorming sessions that produced the duo's earlier collaborations. But try as it might, this film just can't manage to grant its players the same kind of mettle that was so present in those preceding pictures. They're lifeless before running into a violent end, going through the motions but lacking the conviction to make their words feel authentic.

Connolly from his own novel of the same name. Unfortunately, Connolly allows complicated subplots to overwhelm the story and distract from the characters. Even superb acting by the entire cast, coupled with Michael Vaughn's excellent directing cannot overcome the cliches and contrived situations such as Craig's kidnapping or the film ending. This could have been a great movie and failure to achieve greatness is more noticeable than if it were just another run-of-the-mill crime story. However, it is enjoyable especially because the cast is great.Daniel Craig plays Mr. X, an upper-echelon cocaine broker masquerading as an upscale real-estate agent in London's wealthy West End. Craig works for Jimmy Price (played by Kenneth Cranham), a manipulative, violent, backstabbing cocaine kingpin. Jimmy is a solid part of the plot foundation but this story is not about cocaine dealers. It is about losing control of your life due to circumstances far beyond control.Unfortunately, the script at times gets lost in a complex web of complicated sub-plots about Serbian drug lords, assassins, African swindlers, low-life hustlers, heroin addicts, mercenaries, and upper crust British billionaires.Director Michael Vaughn does a great job and the cinematography is excellent as is the acting, soundtrack, and production value.

WRONG!Instead, I was pleased to watch a stylish and sexy movie about a drug dealer who is growing weary of the trade, his band of not so merry men, and the last caper they all get sent on as a crew.Daniel Craig stars as the movie's unnamed protagonist.  Throughout the movie, we see this man's cold calculating charm and street though wisdom carry him from situation to situation.  What starts out as a simple ""last task"" for his drug supplier turns into a maelstrom which the protagonist is quickly sucked into.The protagonist's desire to get out of the drug scene is clear, and the movie highlights how much of a vacuum is created when one is in the world of organized crime.  Much like Carlito in Carlito's way or like Henry Hill in ""Goodfellas"", our hero finds himself stuck in a world he has slipped into and can not get out of.The actors do a great job in this movie, and fans of Star Trek will be psyched to see Colm Meaney in a very different role than he usually plays.  He is surprisignly believable as a vicious and brutal killer.  Also for the Trek fans, Tom Hardy (Shinzon from Star Trek X, this time with hair) also does a great job as a member of the protagonist's crew.George Harris is amazing as the protagonist's main sidekick and number two man.  This character actor (we've been seeing him as the ""black guy"" in a lot of movies since the first Indiana Jones) plays his role with a sense of silent cool that is uncanny.  He has one scene that involves an ex-partner in crime that leaves no doubt about who this character is and what it is that he does best.While I found the ending of this movie somewhat unsatisfactory, fans of heist movies or mob movies will enjoy this peek into London's underworld.

So I wasn't expecting much from ""Layer Cake,"" which I knew wasn't even a Guy Ritchie flick but a flick directed by the PRODUCER of ""Lock, Stock, etc."" and ""Snatch."" Things didn't look promising. However, I read a review by Roger Ebert that compared ""Layer Cake"" to ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" and mentioned that unlike Ritchie's other films, this one took itself seriously. I decided to give it a try.I was blown away. ""Layer Cake"" is lean, mean, tough, and, ultimately, tragic. It is a gangster film in the tradition of ""The Long Good Friday,"" and if it doesn't have the epic scope that elevated ""Casino"" above other entries in the genre it's got echoes of that Scorcese masterpiece and a lot of good stuff of its own vintage.Like ""Casino,"" ""Layer Cake"" tells the story of a man who is very, very good at being a criminal, but makes the mistake of believing that he can stop being one. Both DeNiro's Sam Rothstein and Daniel Craig's unnamed drug dealer want to go straight, but quickly find that they've gotten in too deep, that people depend on them, and that those people will not just let them walk away. Craig's drug dealer is a smart, but self-centered man who believes he's better than the guys he works for and the guys who work for him. By the end of the film, he's learned his lesson.Craig's slimy, serpentine performance is very convincing and effective. It's hard to see how anybody watched this film and saw the next James Bond, but that's beside the point. He's surrounded by similarly talented performers in the always dependable Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon. Sienna Miller, who plays his love interest, radiates so much warmth and sensuality that it's not difficult to believe that Craig's dealer would be distracted by her, even when it becomes clear that next week is not promised for him.The film also looks great. Though it was shot on the cheap, you wouldn't know it for a second, as the compositions in every scene are superb and everything has a cold, barren, metallic feel to it that perfectly suits the tone of the movie. This isn't the London you've got in your minds' eye-- this is a place without history, without culture, without values. It's a bleak, soulless world. There's nothing comfortable about it.What impressed me most about ""Layer Cake,"" however, was not the tragic arc of the story, nor the performances, or the cinematography. It was the fact that the film didn't make mistakes, anywhere. There were no unnecessary scenes, no comic relief that didn't emerge organically out of the material, no attempts to placate the audience or make them feel better about what they were watching. The soundtrack doesn't provide easy emotional cues but picks its spots and nails them, then fades back and lets us draw our own conclusions about what we see. The romantic subplot that develops doesn't seem like an attempt to engage those put off by the rough stuff-- it's a vital part of the story, even if we don't realize it at first. The violence is profuse, but relatively bloodless-- it's cold, and businesslike, not passionate. Just like the characters engaged in it.Finally, there are scenes that are so good, they inspire a kind of awe. I'm thinking first of a scene in which a character says precisely the wrong thing at the wrong time and violence erupts in such a controlled way that you'd think it was premeditated. Then, there's the scene with Craig and Miller in the hotel room, which is sexy without being exploitive and ends in a very unexpected way. Lastly, there's the final scene-- both the set-up, with Craig walking away from his table of friends, thinking hard, and the payoff, when the inevitable takes place just when we're thinking the movie's let its protagonist too easily off the hook.Three great scenes. No bad scenes. No mistakes. No messiness. ""Layer Cake"" is an excellent film.Rated R: Contains a remarkably limited amount of graphic violence, but a lot of people get shot; there are also some brief glimpses of sexual activity, lots of drug talk (and some, but not much, use), and language throughout",5,"The best pure gangster film since ""Casino""",1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,4209,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'fan', 'thought', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'was', 'cute', 'not', 'compelling', 'thought', 'Snatch', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'flick', 'flick', 'directed', 'PRODUCER', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'etc', 'Snatch', 'Things', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'promising', 'However', 'read', 'review', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'compared', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', 'mentioned', 'Ritchie', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'took', 'seriously', 'decided', 'give', 'try.I', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'lean', 'mean', 'tough', 'ultimately', 'gangster', 'film', 'tradition', 'Long', 'Good', 'Friday', ""n't"", 'have', 'epic', 'scope', 'elevated', 'Casino', 'other', 'entries', 'genre', 'got', 'echoes', 'Scorcese', 'masterpiece', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'own', 'vintage.Like', 'Casino', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'being', 'criminal', 'mistake', 'believing', 'can', 'stop', 'being', 'one', 'DeNiro', 'Sam', 'Rothstein', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'unnamed', 'drug', 'dealer', 'want', 'go', 'straight', 'quickly', 'find', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'too', 'deep', 'people', 'depend', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'just', 'let', 'walk', 'away', 'Craig', 'drug', 'dealer', 'smart', 'self-centered', 'man', 'who', 'better', 'guys', 'guys', 'who', 'work', 'end', 'film', 'learned', 'lesson.Craig', 'slimy', 'serpentine', 'performance', 'very', 'convincing', 'effective', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'anybody', 'watched', 'film', 'saw', 'next', 'James', 'Bond', 'beside', 'point', 'surrounded', 'similarly', 'talented', 'performers', 'always', 'dependable', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'so', 'much', 'warmth', 'sensuality', 'not', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Craig', 'dealer', 'would', 'be', 'distracted', 'even', 'when', 'clear', 'next', 'week', 'not', 'promised', 'him.The', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'was', 'shot', 'cheap', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'second', 'compositions', 'scene', 'are', 'superb', 'everything', 'cold', 'barren', 'metallic', 'feel', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'tone', 'movie', ""n't"", 'London', ""'ve"", 'got', 'minds', 'eye', 'place', 'history', 'culture', 'values', 'bleak', 'soulless', 'world', 'nothing', 'comfortable', 'it.What', 'impressed', 'most', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'tragic', 'arc', 'story', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'was', 'fact', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistakes', 'anywhere', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'comic', 'relief', 'did', ""n't"", 'emerge', 'organically', 'material', 'attempts', 'placate', 'audience', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'what', 'were', 'watching', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'provide', 'easy', 'emotional', 'cues', 'spots', 'nails', 'then', 'back', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'what', 'see', 'romantic', 'subplot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'attempt', 'engage', 'put', 'off', 'rough', 'stuff', 'vital', 'part', 'story', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'first', 'violence', 'profuse', 'relatively', 'bloodless', 'cold', 'businesslike', 'not', 'passionate', 'Just', 'characters', 'engaged', 'it.Finally', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'inspire', 'kind', 'awe', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'first', 'scene', 'character', 'precisely', 'wrong', 'thing', 'wrong', 'time', 'violence', 'erupts', 'such', 'controlled', 'way', ""'d"", 'think', 'was', 'premeditated', 'Then', 'scene', 'Craig', 'Miller', 'hotel', 'room', 'sexy', 'being', 'exploitive', 'very', 'unexpected', 'way', 'Lastly', 'final', 'scene', 'set-up', 'Craig', 'walking', 'away', 'table', 'friends', 'thinking', 'hard', 'payoff', 'when', 'inevitable', 'place', 'just', 'when', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'movie', 'let', 'protagonist', 'too', 'easily', 'hook.Three', 'great', 'scenes', 'bad', 'scenes', 'mistakes', 'messiness', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'excellent', 'film.Rated', 'R', 'remarkably', 'limited', 'amount', 'graphic', 'violence', 'lot', 'people', 'get', 'shot', 'are', 'also', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'sexual', 'activity', 'lots', 'drug', 'talk', 'not', 'much', 'use', 'language']",Layer Cake

You have to work at this one but in the end the work pays off - sort of.To begin with the main character (Daniel Craig) is a nameless 'good criminal' middleman working quietly producing Ecstasy pills.  His motto is work small, stay quiet, pay your people on time, and get out when you can.  The remainder of the story is how our nameless 'hero' becomes insidiously involved in the various layers of his chosen crime of drug trafficking and the results of his blood-streaked rise to the top layer of the cake.  There are so many characters involved in this story (each well acted, tidy cameos) that soon you lose track of who's who and who just got whacked.  It is a violent climb to the top and a surprise ending that in retrospect should have seemed apparent.Daniel Craig plays his heart out with this character and he is joined by such luminaries as Michael Gambon and Colm Meany in pulling off a pulsating crime drama.  Yes, it is in the same realm as 'The Usual Suspects' and other British wham bang high-density flicks.  The goods are delivered - but the question arises as to who cares?

Connolly's excellent crime novel about an unnamed young drug dealer/cutter (Daniel Craig) who's trying to save enough money to retire from his criminal life. This film adaptation written by the author and a directing debut for Mathew Vaughn is a credible but underwhelming effort.While the plot of the film 'Layer Cake' follows more-or-less closely to the novel it never really feels like it goes anywhere. Everything you see in this movie you've seen in other gangster films, especially if you're a Guy Ritchie fan. That's not to say that it's bad or anything and director Vaughn uses some really colorful locales and has some great (and strange) use of music. Unfortunatly his camera work gets hung up on slow zooming and these close-ups of Daniel Craig's face which add nothing to the experience (at least not for me). The filmmakers might have intended for there to be some voice-over work in these close-ups but ultimatly any effect seems lost (though by the end I had a photographic memory of Daniel Craig's facial structure).One thing I love about this film (and the novel) is how it uses dialogue to move the story forward as opposed to action. The dialogue is (usually) very snappy and the actors do a great job of bringing their colorful characters to life especially Daniel Craig, George Harris and Colm MeaneyLike I said, Layer Cake isn't a bad film at all it's just not a very memorable one. This WAS Mathew Vaughn's first film but he did a much better job with Stardust and Kick-Ass.

916001,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B0009X7BD2,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 6]","""Layer Cake"" was slightly entertaining but fell flat for me. I still have to give credit to film director Matthew Vaughn for his first feature film. He made a name for himself producing the crime-comedy classics ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"". Vaughn abandons the cheeky and comedic nature of those two films and attempts to make a serious crime film. The results are decidedly uneven, as the movie is a stylish but hollow outing.In here we have XXX (Daniel Craig) who is a man who wants to get out of the game when he reaches the height of his success. He finds forces that he can not control pulling him towards the life is trying to leave. He solves his problem and feels like he has won when suddenly there is one last surprise. Matthew Vaughn guides the film in a cool, professional manner but it lacks the needed energy. This film lacks the vitality, humor and whiz-bang camera work of the aforementioned Guy Ritchie crime flicks. It also lacks the character development and drama to work convincingly as a straight-faced crime thriller. The problem is that XXXX as presented here simply isn't an interesting protagonist. Make him likable or make him detestable, but don't make him bland and anonymous. The side characters, with the notable exception of the commanding Eddie Temple played by Michael Gambon, are similarly underdeveloped.All this is particularly disappointing given that J.J. Connolly himself adapted his novel for the screen. I read this novel a while back and thought it was a great piece of pulp writing. Not only is the nameless narrator a distinct and dynamic character, he is surrounded by other well-defined characters, and the story includes heavy doses of humor and great intrigue and plot twists. Director Matthew Vaughn stated that many of the funny scenes from Connolly's screenplay were omitted in an apparent attempt to distance himself from ""Lock Stock"" and ""Snatch"". Additionally, some of the best characters from the book like Morty and Gene are underdeveloped stock characters in the movie, although both George Harris and Colm Meaney do as good a job as could be expected with what they're given. One issue I have is that if Vaughn was so dead set on making this a serious movie there was plenty of material to draw from in order to do a better job of developing and fleshing out the characters.""Layer Cake"" clocks in at about an hour and forty minutes and easily could have been a half hour longer, which would have provided ample time to build drama and make the characters more interesting.

When I complained to people they said see Layer Cake and you'll see why he was chosen to to do X-Men 3. Now that I saw the movie I really wish he didn't drop out of doing X-3. Now that he is out and Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) is in, it might really suck lol.Anyway Danial Craig (The Road to Perdition) plays a cocaine dealer who wants out but is in for one more deal. It goes horribly wrong though and people start getting killed. He even finds that he has to hold a gun for the first time in his life. Him looking for a gun that suits him is one of the best scenes.

916010,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0009X7BD2,Kevin Killian,"[2, 6]","Good showcase for Daniel Craig, but those of you who come to LAYER CAKE hoping to see something of Sienna Miller, beware, she's in it for about 5 minutes despite her prominent placement on the DVD case.  However she's nearly naked so that might be worth it for Miller fans.  First she appears in a club, acting wild, clumping up and down on the dancefloor while Daniel Craig and his buddies look on.  She's more Edie Sedgwick in this than she was as Edie Sedgwick, and introduced to Craig, she leans over him and slips her phone number into his breast pocket.  Hugging her naif boyfriend, she mouths ""Call me"" to Craig, silently, but you could read her lips from fifty miles away.  She's not much of a dancer, is she, but who cares.The plot of LAYER CAKE is extremely convoluted and I expect that few people who watch it will be able to catch all of it.  Even J J Connolly, who wrote the novel the movie's based on, and the screenplay, has said that a few of Matthew Vaughan's directorial tricks have left him befuddled and he forgot who did what to whom by the end of the movie.  I think he also forgot to give Sienna Miller much of a part.  Next time she runs into the film it's to have sex with Daniel Craig, which she begins with great abandon by pushing him down onto a set of satin sheets, then wriggling off of him to run into the bathroom and dress herself even more provocatively, with silk stockings and garter belt, than when she came in.  It doesn't take her long, but by the time she gets back into the bedroom Daniel Craig's been kidnapped and stuffed into a laundry cart by two goons masquerading as Room Service.  The look on her face is priceless as she surveys the mussed up bed and the empty room, disappointed in love again.  ""She's quite a ball of fire, isn't she?"" my wife commented, with that tone of voice I always decipher as either deep fascination or absolute repulsion.""I'm not sure what you want me to say,"" I countered.  Finally Sienna Miller returns for her final scene which I won't spoil except by hinting that she begins the scene elated and ""up,"" and ends it with a cry, thus proving she's capable as well as an eternal tabloid grabber.

916011,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0009X7BD2,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 4]","Perception of life is usually in the eye of the beholder, and in Layer Cake it is in the eye of Daniel Craig's unnamed character who the film refers to as XXXX in the end credits.  Through XXXX's vision the audience will learn the hard lesson of commerce in the British underworld where on can be on the top one-day, and on the bottom the next.  The title itself plays metaphorically with the different levels of societal classes, and how one strives to reach the top.  Director Matthew Vaughn, who produced Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000), makes his directorial debut with a stylish crime story that follows the footsteps of his friend and director Guy Ritchie.  Yet, it feels more like a British treatment of Goodfellas (1990) that provides an amusingly sharp portrayal of how drugs can complicate the British underworld and society.A detailed opening accompanied by XXXX's voice-over delivers a historical and personal perspective on how drugs have changed the socioeconomic tendencies of the underworld.  Vaughn also makes it visually clear through clever mise-en-scene and astonishing photography how boundaries between the law and lawless might eventually diffuse itself, due to the enormous sums of profit collected by the illegal drug industry.  In addition, XXXX's clarifies the customers demand for drugs in the eloquently statement, ""Give people what they want: good times today, stupid tomorrow.""  In essence, XXXX captures society's lack of patience and the customers' addictions in the minute statement.  Thus, XXXX claims that he is a professional and discreet businessman providing this need for those who are needy while accumulating sufficient wealth to retire.Crime does pay, or at least that is the idea, that audience will receive in the opening of Layer Cake, as XXXX shows his plans of retirement.  However, retirement will have to wait when Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), a powerful gangster, requests his help.  It is a task out of the ordinary for XXXX who realizes that he has no choice and must push up his retirement date.  At the same time, a wannabe gangster named the Duke has acquired an obscene amount of ecstasy pills from an unknown location, which XXXX tries to acquire for Jimmy.  If this would not be enough, XXXX falls in love with a stunning blond that any fool would consider a sign of trouble.  This and much more begin to blend into an intriguing concoction that never will be predictable, or boring.Layer Cake might have similarities with other gangster films; however, Vaughn generates a refreshing story of gangsters in the British society where the connecting factor between classes is drugs.  Much of the success in the film rests within Daniel Craig's sophisticated character that possess several fascinating traits.  In addition, his frequent and small voice-overs that illustrate his thoughts deliver an additional attention-grabbing aspect to the story.  Layer Cake pretty much focuses on XXXX, and his perspective on life and his status.  There are several excellent actors such as Colm Meaney, George Harris, Kenneth Cranham, and Michael Gambon that helps contrast XXXX's persona, which also augments the audience's fascination with the film.  All of the cinematic facets are linked under Vaugn's terrific debut, as a director that delivers a phenomenal action thriller that will keep the audience smiling until the end.",4,A Surprisingly Good Gangster Drama...,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,3404,"['Perception', 'life', 'usually', 'eye', 'beholder', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'eye', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'unnamed', 'character', 'who', 'film', 'refers', 'XXXX', 'end', 'credits', 'XXXX', 'vision', 'audience', 'will', 'learn', 'hard', 'lesson', 'commerce', 'British', 'underworld', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'top', 'one-day', 'bottom', 'next', 'title', 'metaphorically', 'different', 'levels', 'societal', 'classes', 'how', 'one', 'reach', 'top', 'Director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'produced', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', '1998', 'Snatch', '2000', 'directorial', 'debut', 'stylish', 'crime', 'story', 'footsteps', 'friend', 'director', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'more', 'British', 'treatment', 'Goodfellas', '1990', 'amusingly', 'sharp', 'portrayal', 'how', 'drugs', 'can', 'complicate', 'British', 'underworld', 'society.A', 'detailed', 'opening', 'accompanied', 'XXXX', 'voice-over', 'historical', 'personal', 'perspective', 'how', 'drugs', 'have', 'changed', 'socioeconomic', 'tendencies', 'underworld', 'Vaughn', 'also', 'visually', 'clear', 'clever', 'mise-en-scene', 'astonishing', 'photography', 'how', 'boundaries', 'law', 'lawless', 'might', 'eventually', 'diffuse', 'due', 'enormous', 'sums', 'profit', 'collected', 'illegal', 'drug', 'industry', 'addition', 'XXXX', 'clarifies', 'customers', 'demand', 'drugs', 'eloquently', 'statement', 'Give', 'people', 'what', 'want', 'good', 'times', 'today', 'stupid', 'tomorrow', 'essence', 'XXXX', 'society', 'lack', 'patience', 'customers', 'addictions', 'minute', 'statement', 'Thus', 'XXXX', 'professional', 'discreet', 'businessman', 'providing', 'need', 'who', 'are', 'needy', 'accumulating', 'sufficient', 'wealth', 'retire.Crime', 'pay', 'least', 'idea', 'audience', 'will', 'receive', 'opening', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'XXXX', 'plans', 'retirement', 'However', 'retirement', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'when', 'Jimmy', 'Price', 'Kenneth', 'Cranham', 'powerful', 'gangster', 'help', 'task', 'ordinary', 'XXXX', 'who', 'choice', 'must', 'push', 'up', 'retirement', 'date', 'same', 'time', 'wannabe', 'gangster', 'named', 'Duke', 'acquired', 'obscene', 'amount', 'ecstasy', 'pills', 'unknown', 'location', 'XXXX', 'acquire', 'Jimmy', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'XXXX', 'love', 'stunning', 'blond', 'fool', 'would', 'consider', 'sign', 'trouble', 'much', 'more', 'begin', 'blend', 'intriguing', 'concoction', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'predictable', 'boring.Layer', 'Cake', 'might', 'have', 'similarities', 'other', 'gangster', 'films', 'however', 'Vaughn', 'refreshing', 'story', 'gangsters', 'British', 'society', 'where', 'connecting', 'factor', 'classes', 'drugs', 'Much', 'success', 'film', 'rests', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'sophisticated', 'character', 'possess', 'several', 'fascinating', 'traits', 'addition', 'frequent', 'small', 'voice-overs', 'illustrate', 'thoughts', 'deliver', 'additional', 'attention-grabbing', 'aspect', 'story', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'pretty', 'much', 'focuses', 'XXXX', 'perspective', 'life', 'status', 'are', 'several', 'excellent', 'actors', 'such', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'George', 'Harris', 'Kenneth', 'Cranham', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'contrast', 'XXXX', 'persona', 'also', 'audience', 'fascination', 'film', 'cinematic', 'facets', 'are', 'linked', 'Vaugn', 'terrific', 'debut', 'director', 'phenomenal', 'action', 'thriller', 'will', 'keep', 'audience', 'smiling', 'end']",Layer Cake

It's a well-shot film with many interesting angles and colorful moments which benefit from the hi-def. Director Vaughn doesn't have Ritchie's genius for camera movement but for his first effort behind the lens LC is decent enough, and Craig is about as good as he gets here, which is quite good.Craig is upstaged by many of the supporting cast, though, especially Meaney and Gambon. Meaney is becoming the new Michael Caine,  ubiquitous in most every Brit and Irish film of the last decade, but it's all to the good as he always delivers the goods, and LC is no exception. Gambon is also excellent as usual. The score by Lisa Gerrard is solid and she delivers some of her patented distant wails which work well here as they're never too in your face. Or ears.The real hero of Layer Cake is JJ Connolly, writer of the screenplay and the novel it's based on. The movie has a perfect opening in a drugstore, which sums up our society's addiction to both drugs and pointless drug wars. If the whole film had stayed that tight this would be a modern classic, but it soon veers into semi-standard new Brit gangster film, though this is among the best of the bunch. The plot seems simple but we soon see how byzantine it all is, until the very end which is really a bit of a waste in some ways, though perhaps realistic, whatever that means in this context.But I'd recommend Layer Cake in any case to all fans of sharp dialogue and interesting plot twists; if you liked The Usual Suspects and Lock Stock, this is their offspring and you're bound to like it too.",4,Excellent blu-ray transfer of a good movie,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1657,"['liked', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'blu-ray', 'very', 'nice', 'upgrade', 'well-shot', 'film', 'many', 'interesting', 'angles', 'colorful', 'moments', 'benefit', 'hi-def', 'Director', 'Vaughn', ""n't"", 'have', 'Ritchie', 'genius', 'camera', 'movement', 'first', 'effort', 'lens', 'LC', 'decent', 'enough', 'Craig', 'as', 'good', 'here', 'quite', 'good.Craig', 'upstaged', 'many', 'supporting', 'cast', 'though', 'especially', 'Meaney', 'Gambon', 'Meaney', 'becoming', 'new', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'ubiquitous', 'most', 'Brit', 'Irish', 'film', 'last', 'decade', 'good', 'always', 'goods', 'LC', 'exception', 'Gambon', 'also', 'excellent', 'usual', 'score', 'Lisa', 'Gerrard', 'solid', 'patented', 'distant', 'wails', 'work', 'well', 'here', ""'re"", 'never', 'too', 'face', 'ears.The', 'real', 'hero', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'JJ', 'Connolly', 'writer', 'screenplay', 'novel', 'based', 'movie', 'perfect', 'opening', 'drugstore', 'sums', 'up', 'society', 'addiction', 'drugs', 'pointless', 'drug', 'wars', 'whole', 'film', 'had', 'stayed', 'tight', 'would', 'be', 'modern', 'classic', 'soon', 'veers', 'semi-standard', 'new', 'Brit', 'gangster', 'film', 'best', 'bunch', 'plot', 'simple', 'soon', 'see', 'how', 'byzantine', 'very', 'end', 'really', 'bit', 'waste', 'ways', 'perhaps', 'realistic', 'context.But', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'case', 'fans', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'liked', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'offspring', ""'re"", 'bound', 'like', 'too']",Layer Cake

Bernabo,"[0, 1]","At the beginning of ""L4yer Cake"" a mid-level English criminal who traffics in cocaine explains the world in which he lives, which sets up his goal of getting out while he is still alive and unincarcerated. If there is anything we know from such films, it is that getting away is difficult, not just because of the inherent nature of the business or because others do thing to keep bringing you back in, but also because in such stories the pivotal moment that means success or failure for such efforts is either lurking in the shadows or rears its ugly head at the absolute wrong time. So as soon as the main character talks about his desire to walk away from this life and the credits start rolling, we know full well this is not a good sign.The character played by Daniel Craig (we never learn his name: he is identified in the credits as XXXX, apparently so we do not confuse him with a Vin Diesel character) is clearly competent as his chosen profession. He is not stupid and he is not greedy, two things definitely in his favor. The problem is that he is called to a meeting with Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), the next fellow up on the food chain. An ecstasy deal has turned into a complete disaster and Jimmy tells our hero (or should I just say protagonist?) to figure out what happened and fix it. As if that is not enough reason to start banging his head against the wall, he is also told to find out what happened to the daughter of Jimmy's boss, Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon). She is missing, and the reasons for it cannot be good. Plus you get the feeling that Temple is the sort who shoots the messenger, but not until he makes them suffer horribly. Ironically, keeping his nose clean (so to speak), means others are finding reasons to rub it in messes not of his own making. This means things are going to get worse, with no promise of them ever becoming better. Being smart might not be enough to get out of this one alive.""L4yer Cake"" was directed by Matthew Vaughn, who was involved in producing Guy Ritchie's films ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoing Barrles"" and ""Snatch."" Apparently he was taking notes. But as a first time director Vaughn was helped by the fact that author J.J. Connolly adapted his own novel, which makes sense since he knows the labyrinth of the narrative better than anyone else. There was a point when I was wondering how the film's main character got involved with the rest of these crooks, because they are mostly thugs, the sort who blow somebody away and then keep the incriminating gun because it is their favorite. XXXX is too good for this world and every time somebody notices that he is smart it never really seems to be a compliment because the observation always comes from a character who could be thinking that this guy is smart enough to get things done and make money, but the more likely interpretation that showing you are intelligent is liking pulling up your shirt to reveal an Uzi tucked in your pants. You cannot be too smart in this world, because that can be just as fatal as being too dumb. The only different is who gets you the cops get the dumb ones, while the smart ones are going to get taken down by their own. We are rooting for XXXX, but we are not going to put any money down on his chances.We have a hard time figuring out what is really happening because XXXX is having just a hard time figuring things out, and his life is on the line. People do not believe him when he is telling the truth so he knows full well that when he tries to tell people the truth being believed is not a likely outcome. You have to stay ahead of the game and our hero is missing what must be entire chapters from the rule book. The bits and pieces he picks up are helping a bit, but he has to have the whole thing figure out before the final piece is put into place. Early on I gleaned onto the idea that it was really what XXXX did not know that was the potentially fatal flaw in accomplishing his assigned tasks, so when it was revealed I was waiting for it. The key thing with ""L4yer Cake,"" assuming that you like this genre in the first place, is that the revelation is a fitting capstone to the roller coaster ride we are on.Although the tone and the characters are nothing like it, the movie that ""L4yer Cake"" reminded me of was not ""The Usual Suspects"" or anything obvious like that, but rather ""The Sting.""

916022,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0009X7BD2,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I rather liked this 2004 British ganster film, even if it is not really a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.This is the story of an Unnamed Man (Daniel Craig) who is a succesful drug dealer, working with two trusted associates, Gene (Colm Meaney) and Morty (George Harris). Having made enough money Unnamed Man plans to retire from the drug dealing business for good. His plans are however contradicted by his dangerous business partner and main cocaine supplier Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), who wants him to do something unusual - and saying ""no"" to Jimmy Price comes usually with such a high price that it is not really an option... In the same time, a unstable moronic gangster named Duke (Jamie Foreman) and his even more unstable and moronic girlfriend/partner in crime Slasher (Sally Hawkins) contact Price with an offer to sell one million ecstasy tablets - and the Unnamed Man is charged to deal with this thing too... I will say no more about the story.This film was clearly influenced by the great success of earlier Guy Ritchie's films ""Lock, stock and two smoking barrels"" and ""Snatch"", but it is somehow more serious, more realistic and darker, even if there is still some humour and some really over-the-top-and-out-there characters, like Duke, Slasher, Lucky the Hitman (Paul Orchard) and especially Dragan (Dragan Micanovic), The Horrible Incredible Invisible Invincible Serbian Hitman...))) There is of course a lot of double-crossing, triple-crossing and according to my calculations in one case there is even a tetra crossing...))) Language is strong, action pace is good, dead bodies drop at regular basis and of course there is an attractive gangster moll, a hot vixen named Tammy (Sienna Miller), adept of temptation by phone...I usually don't like Daniel Craig very much (I refuse to consider his Bond films as being real Bond films and can't wait to see him replaced...) but in this film he does very well and the character he plays is well thought and well done. The accumulation of plots is similar to the technique used in Guy Ritchie's films and is well kept under control, with most of things being solved towards the end. I must however warn you, that the ending is a cliffhanger - and for my personal taste, when such thing doesn't lead to a second part, it is a rather a poor idea.Bottom line, this is a very honest gangster film, not as funny or good as the two masterpieces cited above but still good enough that for his third gangster film, 2008 ""Rockn'rolla"", Guy Ritchie actually copied a lot from ""Layer cake""... I will keep my DVD for possible another viewing in the future. Enjoy!",4,"""I'm not a gangster.

It follows an honorable crook, which we know only as XXXX (Daniel Craig), who specializes in trafficking cocaine.  XXXX's strategy is to never get involved directly with the criminal element, surrounding himself with other honorable criminals who in turn conduct themselves professionally.  It's all a very neat arrangement on the surface, and XXXX thinks he's got the system beat.  He plans to retire and disappear from the business. WARNING: As we eat this cake, there's bound to be some juicy spoilers inside.Peel back a layer... and it turns out that XXXX actually has a boss, Jimmy Price (Kenneth Craham).  He demands XXXX personally track down Charlie, the daughter of Price's fellow crime boss Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon, an evil version of Dumbeldore!).  This violates XXXX's rule of never getting personally involved, but he has no choice.Peel back a layer...and Price also wants XXXX to organize the distribution of ""super ecstasy"" tablets from The Duke (Jamie Foreman). Except that the drugs were actually stolen from a Serbian gang, who is intent on tracking them down and murdering everyone involved.Peel back a layer...and we discover that Price is quite vindictive.  He wants XXXX to actually kidnap Charlie in a twisted revenge plot against Temple. It seems Price doesn't like the idea that XXXX thinks he can retire and wants him dead - if Temple's men don't kill him, drug dealers certainly will.Peel back a layer...and we finally get to the best part of the cake.  Nobody is innocent. The professional associates have all committed their own heinous crimes for petty reasons: clubbing snitches to bloody pulps, killing people they dislike, and hiding corpses in freezers. This awful truth requires XXXX to get his hands dirty and he does so in the most thuggish fashion.The visual direction in Layer Cake is superb, using Matthew Vaughn's trademark whiplash style that he perfected inLock, Stock & Two Smoking BarrelsandSnatch. It makes what could be a standard drug dealing tale much more interesting. Although the accents are hard to follow at times, the acting is top notch.  XXXX is a complex character that gives Craig an opportunity to experience extreme violence, utter defeat, passionate lust, and a host of other emotions beyond the reach of the Bond films.Although Layer Cake narrative can be circuitous, stick with it.

916031,A8RI16EA6F1KA,B0009X7BD2,Michael S. Dewey,"[0, 0]","Not your ""James Bond"" Daniel Craig role in this movie, which consists of a down and dirty melange of assorted thuggies and druggies in a complex tale of double and triple dealings in the ""layered"" London/Western Europe drug empire. Craig's role as ""XXXX"" starts out as an interloper/middle man for the London big-wig drug kingpins, which is a left-handed way of saying he keeps his hands clean of the normal day-to-day street operations and makes big cash as a squeaky-clean go-between for the money men. But the so called Mr. Big, Jimmie Price (Kenneth Cranham), has some additional work for our pristine college boy that most assuredly leads him into unsavory territories where he must get his hands dirty (and bloody). His normal crew of Clarkie, Mortie and Terry are now to include the likes of Gene, Duke, Slasher, Sydney etc., who comprise some the street riff-raff he has to associate with to carry out the boss' directives. Add to that, another big boss emerges who may, in fact, be the ""real"" Main Man. The local constabulary along with the Liverpool boys also have some pivotal involvement in this nefarious mix.What ensues is a complicated but engrossing tale of criminal crosses and double-crosses as the Serbs, the Liverpool boys and others in the London mob and law enforcement intersect one anothers' paths in this melodramatic tour-de-force. The layers of our metaphorical cake are eventually stripped aside and lead to a most dramatic conclusion. I don't think I'll see another crime film of this mettle for quite some time. The contributions by all involved in this project were realistic, poignant and entertaining. My only negative takes on the film are the occasional scenes of gratuitous violence that I, for one, can do without.

916033,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0009X7BD2,mirasreviews,"[1, 2]","""Layer Cake"" is the first film directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced  1998's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and 2000's ""Snatch"". Like those films, ""Layer Cake"" takes place in Great Britain's criminal underworld, so Vaughn is very much in his element. It is based on the novel by J.J. Connelly, who also wrote the screenplay. The novel is known for its accurate exposition of the drug-dealing underworld, and a rough cut of the film was criticized for having too much of that and not enough plot. The final cut of the film doesn't have those problems, but it is long and languorous at times due to exposition and simple lingering on some scenes. The film's protagonist and sometimes-narrator is nameless throughout the film, an idiosyncrasy that the audience may or may not notice, but which struck me right away, since I was taking notes and couldn't catch his name. The protagonist is listed as ""XXXX"" in the film's credits and press kit, so that's what I'll call him.The story concerns a successful cocaine dealer (Daniel Craig), who is scrupulously careful in how he does business and whom he does it with. ""I'm not a gangster. I'm a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine,"" he says. He keeps a low profile, keeps the clients happy, keeps his supplier happy, only deals with a small coterie of associates, and doesn't get caught. But he believes in quitting while he's ahead. Before he can, his supplier Jimmy Price (Kenneth Granham) asks him to find a buyer for a large shipment of Ecstasy pills and to do favor: retrieve the errant daughter of prominent businessman Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon). It sounds simple, and our nameless purveyor of contraband reluctantly accepts. But it turns out that the guy who wants to sell the ecstasy, the Duke (Jamie Foreman), stole the pills from a Serbian drug lord in Amsterdam. The Serbian has sent his ferociously violent henchman Dragan (Dragan Micanovic) after the pills. Eddie Temple doesn't want his daughter found and is a man of grander agendas. And our man finds himself caught in the middle, immersed in a world of violence and inscrutable scheming that has gotten completely out of control.One of the most interesting aspects of ""Layer Cake"" is the opening sequence, which introduces us to the concept of illicit drugs as an opportunity to make big money while they remain illegal, a status which our protagonist believes cannot last. ""So until Prohibition ends, make hay while the sun shines.""  That's what the people on every level of the ""layer cake"" do. We also get occasional glimpses of the early days of the modern drug business in Great Britain, since some of the characters have been in it since the 1960s. Director Matthew Vaughn creates a sense of evolution of the illicit drug trade, whose modern incarnation started among hippies in the 1960s and may end in big business of the 21st century. The anonymous cocaine dealer XXXX is somewhere in the middle, a savvy businessman exploiting Prohibition to his own ends and loathe to contend with the lowlifes who still permeate the business. Daniel Craig does a good job of this character who comes out of nowhere and has limited ties to anything. He's put-upon, trapped, and we never really know if he is clever enough to cope with his situation or not. ""Layer Cake"" is a clever, modern gangster film that's a little too long, but at least the unnecessary shots are visually interesting.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): Bonus features include 2 featurettes, deleted scenes and alternate endings, story boards, posters, and an audio commentary. There are 14 deleted scenes and 2 alternative endings with optional director commentary. If you thought the ending in the movie was questionable, as I did, you might prefer one of these. ""Storyboard Comparisons"" (3  minutes) for 2 scenes show storyboards as we watch film of the finished scene for comparison.  ""Q&A; Screening with Matthew Vaughn and Daniel Craig"" (29 minutes) is a question and answer session with the director and actor at the National Film Theatre in London, September 2004. ""The Making of Layer Cake"" (6 minutes) features short interviews with the director and cast in which they  describe their characters. ""Poster Explorations"" shows 24 posters. In the audio commentary, director/producer Matthew Vaughn and writer J. J. Connelly discuss story, characters, editing and directorial decisions, and how the filmmakers got some of the shots.

916034,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B0009X7BD2,Mir,"[3, 4]","I first noticed Daniel Craig in the first Tomb Raider flick. I thought he was good looking, loved his voice, but didn't really feel anything like the ""it"" that Angelina Jolie puts out (in contrast to Gerard Butler, who held his own very well with Angelina in the second TR flick).But in this one, Daniel Craig OWNS the screen. It's very hard to look at anyone else when he's there. And it's his magnetism and the constant plot twists that make this film highly watchable. It's stylishly directed, and the casting is really faboo--Michael Gambon, with a very strange fakey tan look, is, as usual, a blast to listen to and watch. His homely face acts up a storm. Daniel Craig, with a sort of semi-wrecked handsomeness--look at those deep-set, small, haunted eyes, those grooves and creases that contrast with that smooth blond hair, that constant natural pout that makes it seem as if he's always plotting something or regretting something. The supporting cast do their jobs, too--Colm Meaney, Sienna Miller, Tom Hardy, etc.This is not a cheerful world, this world of drug dealers with their secrets, their machinations, their grudges, their vengefulness, their greed, their odd loyalties and betrayals. And it's not supposed to be cheerful--even if sometimes the predicaments our protagonist gets into seem nearly comical in their complexity and jolts.So, Daniel Craig plays the dealer ready to leave his criminal world, retire, and take a hot blond chick with him to post-criminal happyland. Unfortunately, fate is against his plan. His boss orders him to do this last job, you see, and this last job is anything but simple. (I won't go into the plot much, since other posts here do that in great detail, down to the last twist, nearly. Help yourself to any spoilers here you wish. I'll skip spoiling the twists, okay?) Every time Mr. X turns around, something gets in his way--and the bodies start piling up. And he's doing everything he can to get out of the tangle and end up alive--and with blondie--and find a life out of the layer cake that is the hierarchy of the criminal world.I thought the ending was perfect, given everything that's come before.BTW, watching this AFTER Casino Royale makes it very clear why Craig was a viable candidate for the Bond job. Look at the way he handles Gene's (Colm) gun, very Bondish. Look at how he walks--the confidence--when he's suited up. Look at the way his eyes can grow deadly cold, and always have this ghost haunting them. Perfect for the new, more serious, less gimmicky Bond.I grew up with Sean Connery as the definitive Bond. No one displaced him, even the charming and handsome Mr. Brosnan. After Casino Royale, Craig is my favorite Bond. And in THIS film, LAYER CAKE, the elements that made him a fabulous, driven, lithe, fast, menacing, love-smitten James Bond are all in evidence.Daniel Craig is on my list of fave actors now, after Casino Royale and Layer Cake. He's got ""it"", and both films reflect it. So, the main reason to watch this plot-twisty film is Mr. Craig.Mir",4,"Lots of Twists, Snazzy, & A Charismatic Daniel Craig",1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,3030,"['first', 'noticed', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'first', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'flick', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'looking', 'loved', 'voice', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'anything', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'out', 'contrast', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'who', 'held', 'own', 'very', 'well', 'Angelina', 'second', 'TR', 'flick', '.But', 'one', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'OWNS', 'screen', 'very', 'hard', 'look', 'anyone', 'else', 'when', 'there', 'magnetism', 'constant', 'plot', 'twists', 'make', 'film', 'highly', 'watchable', 'stylishly', 'directed', 'casting', 'really', 'faboo', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'very', 'strange', 'fakey', 'tan', 'look', 'usual', 'blast', 'listen', 'watch', 'homely', 'face', 'up', 'storm', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'sort', 'semi-wrecked', 'handsomeness', 'look', 'deep-set', 'small', 'haunted', 'eyes', 'grooves', 'creases', 'contrast', 'smooth', 'blond', 'hair', 'constant', 'natural', 'pout', 'seem', 'always', 'plotting', 'something', 'regretting', 'something', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'jobs', 'too', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'etc.This', 'not', 'cheerful', 'world', 'world', 'drug', 'dealers', 'secrets', 'machinations', 'grudges', 'vengefulness', 'greed', 'odd', 'loyalties', 'betrayals', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'cheerful', 'even', 'sometimes', 'predicaments', 'protagonist', 'seem', 'nearly', 'comical', 'complexity', 'jolts.So', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'dealer', 'ready', 'leave', 'criminal', 'world', 'retire', 'take', 'hot', 'blond', 'chick', 'post-criminal', 'happyland', 'Unfortunately', 'fate', 'plan', 'boss', 'orders', 'do', 'last', 'job', 'see', 'last', 'job', 'anything', 'simple', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'much', 'other', 'posts', 'here', 'do', 'great', 'detail', 'down', 'last', 'twist', 'nearly', 'Help', 'spoilers', 'here', 'wish', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'spoiling', 'twists', 'okay', 'time', 'Mr.', 'X', 'around', 'something', 'way', 'bodies', 'start', 'piling', 'up', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'get', 'tangle', 'end', 'up', 'alive', 'blondie', 'find', 'life', 'layer', 'cake', 'hierarchy', 'criminal', 'world.I', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'perfect', 'given', 'everything', 'come', 'before.BTW', 'watching', 'AFTER', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'very', 'clear', 'why', 'Craig', 'was', 'viable', 'candidate', 'Bond', 'job', 'Look', 'way', 'Gene', 'Colm', 'gun', 'very', 'Bondish', 'Look', 'how', 'confidence', 'when', 'suited', 'up', 'Look', 'way', 'eyes', 'can', 'grow', 'deadly', 'cold', 'always', 'have', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'Perfect', 'new', 'more', 'serious', 'less', 'gimmicky', 'Bond.I', 'grew', 'up', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'definitive', 'Bond', 'one', 'displaced', 'even', 'charming', 'handsome', 'Mr.', 'Brosnan', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Craig', 'favorite', 'Bond', 'THIS', 'film', 'LAYER', 'CAKE', 'elements', 'made', 'fabulous', 'driven', 'lithe', 'fast', 'menacing', 'love-smitten', 'James', 'Bond', 'are', 'evidence.Daniel', 'Craig', 'list', 'fave', 'actors', 'now', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'got', 'films', 'reflect', 'So', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'plot-twisty', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Craig.Mir']",Layer Cake
916035,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,B0009X7BD2,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[17, 20]","Not knowing what to expect, this was one of those movies that surprised and then kept on surprising. ""The Layer Cake"" is perhaps the most complete movie I have seen in a long while, with elements inter-linking all through to provide a varied and wild concoction of violence, humour and thrill.The unnamed main character, (Daniel Craig), narrates the movie of his dealings in the underworld's drug scene, dispensing his wisdom all the while, including his ""golden rules"" for dealing drugs. XXXX gets involved with a deal regarding some pills, and also gets pulled into a favour for a criminal leader further up the food chain. The plot twists and turns, and there is an array of very colourful characters, with equally colourful dialogue.As noted by another reviewer, the musical score just blends effortlessly with the movie, making scenes more poignant and lending itself well to the overall feel of the movie itself.The humour, though not a major feature, is there in its subtle way. A good example is the sex scene that almost was, until XXXX got nabbed by some very serious looking and large fellows. Irony abounds all through the movie, though humour is definitely not the mainstay of the plot.The ending, (I won't spoil it), is excellent, and makes the preceding movie seem all the more powerful, especially in regard to XXXX's narrations.

916041,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,B0009X7BD2,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[0, 2]","Layer Cake is a black comedy that is a good deal more comedic than black.  Daniel Craig, not yet beefed up to play James Bond, is great as a mid-level drug dealer who is doing quite well and doing the smart thing:  investing most of his money with a reputable broker, recommended by his boss, Jimmy Price, played by Kenneth Cranham.  Craig's character is planning to use his investments to retire early, something he'll be announcing soon.  But first there are a few loose ends.Jimmy Price's boss, occupying the very top layer of the multi-tiered ranks of big-city British drug dealing, wants his wayward daughter found and returned.  She's fallen victim to the same sneeze-inducing white powder that makes them all rich, and she's split from rehab with her junkie boyfriend.Locating runaways is not Daniel Craig's thing, so he farms the job out to a couple of young friends, guys who spend a lot of their time very persuasively affecting a cultivated British accent because young American female tourists respond so much better to their affectations than to their natural working class patois.  The guys are slick, smooth, glib and funny, and more effective at tracking down missing junkies, especially dead ones, than I had expected.Anyhow, by now you've got the plot, insofar as there is one:  Daniel Craig wants to retire early and the rest of the movie consists largely of obliquely connected events, each one just another obstacle in Craig's way, and each one more hilarious than the other.  Plot or no plot, this is Daniel Craig's best film, and the supporting cast is sensational.  Every time I see Sally Hawkins, no matter what sort of role she's playing, I think of her as Slasher, a foul-mouthed, histrionic, gun moll and girl friend to one of the more inept characters with whom Craig has reason to deal.Colm Meany is also excellent.  In his funniest scene, he beats Daniel Craig to a pulp atop an open freezer filled with filleted fish, thinking Craig has betrayed him.  Hard to believe that 007 could get so badly battered by a middle-aged Irishman, who subsequently apologizes for his error.  But, as we've already noted, this was before Craig beefed up.Craig's sidekick, Morte, played by George Harris, has an uproarious beating scene of his own, when he exacts revenge on a no-count jerk who's reckless over-indulgence cost Morte ten years in prison.  He almost kills the guy!I know.  I know.  How can beating be funny?  But even if you don't like violence, you've just got to laugh.  Imagine the three stooges given the appearance and demeanor of 21st Century British sophisticates, but who are otherwise pretty much the same as always.  You'll even laugh when you see a self-assured hit man take a hit himself from a bullet fired right through the scope of his rifle and into his eye.  Hardly a sound.  It takes a second or two before we figure out what has happened.Though advertised as an action-packed thriller, Layer Cake is really a vehicle for a series of loosely related, very violent, very funny, sometimes complicated scenes of the sort that Brits do so well.  (Think of Rock'n'Rolla.)  This is definitely not a film that takes itself too seriously, though the acting and comedic timing are as good as they get.  The ending will prompt just about everyone watching to do a double-take and exclaim with total surprise ""What the ... !!!Layer Cake is definitely a keeper.  I've watched it a dozen times and still find it very entertaining.  And be alert for the tension-relieving joke about an Irishman who found another man with his wife ...",5,What Plot?

I couldn't have been more wrong, and I was pleasantly surprised by that; this is a much straighter gangster picture than I was expecting, far more Get Carter than Gangster No. 1, and that worked much to its credit. Vaughn, Ritchie's longtime producer, has since gone on to direct Stardust and Kick-Ass, and in hindsight, how did he make a gangster movie this good, anyway?Our unnamed protagonist, referred to in the credits as XXXX (Daniel Craig, who became the new James Bond a year after this movie was released), is a British cocaine dealer on the verge of retirement. (One of his rules: ""get good and get out."") Unfortunately, his boss, Jimmy (Kenneth Cranham, recently seen in Hot Fuzz), catches him with one foot out the door with a ""request"" for a job that's not usually up his alley: find Charlie (Nathalie Lunghi in, to date, her only big-screen appearance), the drug-addled daughter of Eddie (Longitude's Michael Gambon), a surface-respectable gangster much farther up the food chain. Worse off, Jimmy also wants him to broker a deal for two million pounds' worth of pharmaceutical-grade Ecstasy that's fallen into the hands of an incompetent fool who goes by the name of The Duke (Gangster No. 1's Jamie Foreman--who actually is the son of a gangster). All is going reasonably well, or as well as can be expected given that everything got knocked into a cocked hat the second Jimmy said ""do me a favor"", until a couple of complications get in the way. The first, as it always is, is a girl. Her name's Tammy (Factory Girl's Sienna Miller), and she's the girlfriend of Sidney (Bright Star's Ben Whishaw), a small-time dealer our hero questions while trying to discover the source of all this Ecstasy. The second is, in fact, that source; it seems the drugs were stolen from a Serbian drug lord named Dragan (RockNRolla's Dragan Micanovic), a guy notorious for stopping at nothing to redress grievances to his operation as messily as possible. There's a lot more to it, but we'd be getting into spoiler territory there.It's kind of hard to believe that Daniel Craig, who's now a household name, was still on the rise as recently as 2004, but when Layer Cake was released, while British audiences were quite familiar with him from TV appearances (among them The Ice House, an adaptation of Minette Walters' classic first novel), Americans had caught him in Elizabeth, Road to Perdition, and if they were paying attention I Dreamed of Africa. (No one actually saw Tomb Raider.) It was just after Layer Cake that his career took off; in quick succession came Munich, Casino Royale, and The Invasion. (Your career taking off doesn't automatically mean all your films are great. Worse, The Invasion was followed up by The Golden Compass. If he hadn't already been James Bond....) Everyone knows how good an actor he is now, so telling you how good he is here will be kind of redundant. For that matter, this entire cast pretty much speaks for itself.

916049,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009X7BD2,Robert Moore,"[5, 14]","On a one to five rating, this one dropped from a four to a two in the last ten seconds.  I want to defend this statement, but yet avoid giving the specifics of what happened.  Let me just say that the ending was not organically connected with the rest of the movie, but felt tacked on.  In any good movie, all the various bits need to be in some sense connected from beginning to end.  Otherwise, some bit might be narratively unconnected with all the rest.  Unfortunately, here a profoundly random ending was stapled onto the very end, completely altering the meaning of everything that went before.  Now, I can easily imagine various explanations why the film was given the ending it had, but the truth of the matter is that all of these explanations will be things brought from outside the film to explain something inside it.  Flowing from the movie itself, the ending is utterly without narrative meaning.Before the ending, I hadn't thought it was a perfect film, but I did think it was a fairly enjoyable one.  I felt that the exposition of the story was a tad muddled at times and that visually the film sometimes revealed Matthew Vaughan's background as a producer rather than a director, but there was a fabulous collection of characters, and I very much enjoyed their interaction with one another.  Daniel Craig in particular was fabulous in the central role, but many other superb actors fill out the large number of parts.  Colm Meaney and Michael Gambon in particular are superb in their rols, but the film keeps coming back to Craig and his steely blue eyes.The plot revolves around a highly disciplined cocaine dealer who suddenly finds himself in an intensely chaotic situation.  He quickly finds that his code and plans are useless when confronted with the messiness of real life (which is also the point of the rather stupid ending--but it is a point that was so clearly made earlier that an ending more in keeping with the rest of the story would have been better, an ending that shows that good philosophy doesn't always lead to good narrative).  Daniel Craig's character (we never learn his name) is pulled into a couple of messes, one involving consumating a drug buy with some extremely unprofessional crooks who have stolen a large amount of pills from a Serbian drug lord and the other the hunt for a magnate's drug abusing daughter.  He finds that the drug buy was a set up and the search for the daughter actually the search for someone to use as a hostage.  Things get messier and messier, but our hero manages to pull things more or less together despite multiple bumps in the road, until the rather unpleasant and unexpected ending.I'm not sure whether to recommend this film to others or not.  Until the tacked on ending, it was a fairly enjoyable film.  I have read that Guy Ritchie had been slated for a long time to direct it.  He and Matthew Vaughan had collaborated on LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS and SNATCH, but the magic that was contained in those two films was lacking here (as it was in the fiasco they jointly created in SWEPT AWAY).  Perhaps Ritchie's abscence was the difference.  Perhaps it was the screenplay, which was produced by the author of the novel.  For whatever reason, the film as a whole is less successful by a considerable margin than the two films that preceded it, and its ending is among the worst I've ever seen in a film.  I guess my first recommendation would be to see it, but try to cut out a few seconds before it stutters to an end.",2,Wretched ending ruins otherwise solid film,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,3509,"['one', 'five', 'rating', 'one', 'dropped', 'four', 'two', 'last', 'ten', 'seconds', 'want', 'defend', 'statement', 'yet', 'avoid', 'giving', 'specifics', 'what', 'happened', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'organically', 'connected', 'rest', 'movie', 'felt', 'tacked', 'good', 'movie', 'various', 'bits', 'need', 'be', 'sense', 'connected', 'beginning', 'end', 'Otherwise', 'bit', 'might', 'be', 'narratively', 'unconnected', 'rest', 'Unfortunately', 'here', 'profoundly', 'random', 'ending', 'was', 'stapled', 'very', 'end', 'completely', 'altering', 'meaning', 'everything', 'went', 'Now', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'various', 'explanations', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'ending', 'had', 'truth', 'matter', 'explanations', 'will', 'be', 'things', 'brought', 'film', 'explain', 'something', 'Flowing', 'movie', 'ending', 'utterly', 'narrative', 'meaning.Before', 'ending', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'film', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'felt', 'exposition', 'story', 'was', 'tad', 'muddled', 'times', 'visually', 'film', 'sometimes', 'revealed', 'Matthew', 'Vaughan', 'background', 'producer', 'rather', 'director', 'there', 'was', 'fabulous', 'collection', 'characters', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'interaction', 'one', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'particular', 'was', 'fabulous', 'central', 'role', 'many', 'other', 'superb', 'actors', 'fill', 'out', 'large', 'number', 'parts', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'particular', 'are', 'superb', 'rols', 'film', 'coming', 'back', 'Craig', 'steely', 'blue', 'eyes.The', 'plot', 'around', 'highly', 'disciplined', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'who', 'suddenly', 'intensely', 'chaotic', 'situation', 'quickly', 'code', 'plans', 'are', 'useless', 'when', 'confronted', 'messiness', 'real', 'life', 'also', 'point', 'rather', 'stupid', 'ending', 'point', 'was', 'so', 'clearly', 'made', 'earlier', 'ending', 'more', 'keeping', 'rest', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'ending', 'good', 'philosophy', ""n't"", 'always', 'lead', 'good', 'narrative', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'character', 'never', 'learn', 'name', 'pulled', 'couple', 'messes', 'one', 'involving', 'consumating', 'drug', 'buy', 'extremely', 'unprofessional', 'crooks', 'who', 'have', 'stolen', 'large', 'amount', 'pills', 'Serbian', 'drug', 'lord', 'other', 'hunt', 'magnate', 'drug', 'abusing', 'daughter', 'drug', 'buy', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'search', 'daughter', 'actually', 'search', 'someone', 'use', 'hostage', 'Things', 'get', 'messier', 'messier', 'hero', 'pull', 'things', 'more', 'less', 'together', 'multiple', 'bumps', 'road', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'unexpected', 'ending.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'recommend', 'film', 'others', 'not', 'tacked', 'ending', 'was', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'have', 'read', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'had', 'been', 'slated', 'long', 'time', 'direct', 'Matthew', 'Vaughan', 'had', 'collaborated', 'LOCK', 'STOCK', 'AND', 'TWO', 'SMOKING', 'BARRELS', 'SNATCH', 'magic', 'was', 'contained', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'lacking', 'here', 'was', 'fiasco', 'jointly', 'created', 'SWEPT', 'AWAY', 'Perhaps', 'Ritchie', 'abscence', 'was', 'difference', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'screenplay', 'was', 'produced', 'author', 'novel', 'reason', 'film', 'whole', 'less', 'successful', 'considerable', 'margin', 'two', 'films', 'preceded', 'ending', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'guess', 'first', 'recommendation', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'try', 'cut', 'out', 'few', 'seconds', 'end']",Layer Cake

That treachery and even murder are occupational hazards of his world, and yuppie overconfidence its principal sin.The script is punchy. Non-fat. Memorable lines. The music is pitch-perfect, and lends beautifully to the tension. Expect to have densely exciting layers created and then unraveled as you go along, not knowing exactly what will happen next. Right until the very denouement, which some may find contentious but one that I think installs just the kind of moral hook that seemed to have been missing from the entire film. I've always believed that the ending can make or mar a film, and this one here is a classic.A fine production, as foxy as they come. What Lord of War was to gun running, this is to the dreary world of drug dealing. Highly recommended purchase. This one will stand to repeat viewings.

Even though the source material has some fun in it, similar to the two previously mentioned films, the life is stripped out of Layer Cake in this crime world quasi-drama where 3 story lines (well... 3 *main* story lines) intersect at one person whose life gets turned upside down in an instant.But all the story lines lay flat.  There are no characters that you really care about enough to stay with.  They feel almost too polished because they are supposed to be uber-cool drug dealers.  But that also makes them very forgetable.  There is no character development that makes them jump off the page.  This makes the movie dull.It is not a total loss though.  There are cool concepts.  Guilt of murder, retribution, and endless double crossing are just a few.  None are taken to full developement, but are good points to ponder what could have been.  There are nice cinematic shots, which is also interesting.  And there are a few points (including the ending) that I think were pleasant departures from the norm.  These factors make it 'not boring.'In feel, it actually reminded me of 'Lucky Number Slevin.'  Not in story line (although the crime bosses and double cross components are there), but rather in overall style.  That movie is better than Layer Cake.

The rumor is that he will be the next James Bond and I think it would revitalize the lame 007 series, as Daniel Craig has that cool, amused, and yet dangerous masculine grace that Sean Connery had. He brings to mind Steve McQueen, but without the petulance. And without the turtleneck sweater.""Layer Cake"" is a smashing addition to the britster genre. There is something more appealing about British no-good-niks as compared to our American variety. Even the way they swear seems, well, civilized. Daniel Craig plays the hero of this frenetic movie, smugly assuring us that he is a ""businessman"" whose trade is illegal drugs. His life is all icy calm and he's in control and about to retire at the top of his game. I say, old chap: fuggedaboutit. How little control over his life he actually has is slowly revealed during the course of the movie, during which everything goes awry. It starts with a command from the local boss to find a woman, the daughter of ""an old friend"". There's a shipment of a million ecstasty tabs stolen from some Serbian mobsters (seriously bad dudes...the scariest in the movie), an attempt to move them, the Serbians want them back, and the ""old friend"" (Eddie, played by the inestimable Michael Gambon looking like an embalmed goat in a perfect suit) steps in to show everyone what is really going on. The plot is very convoluted and in fact, I recommend not trying to think too much but instead to pay attention and let it all wash over you. All will be revealed in the end, after about 6 twists which come breathlessly fast. And you'll be going ""Ohhhh!!!"".There is a lot of religious iconography in this movie, including the fact that our our central hero has no name. He teases us with this fact at the final denouement near the end of the movie. I enjoy picking this stuff out and it was not too heavy-handed with the exception of the shower/baptism scene.

916069,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B0009X7BD2,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[2, 3]","While I can only imagine it - the very idea, the entire concept, of an entire planet or world coming apart is fascinating to imagine.  What would go first?  The poles? The land masses - would the seas heave, would everything that has been hidden below the surface suddenly rise, topple, killing everyone and everything all at once?  A fantasy to be sure, but this is exactly what happens in L4YER CAKE - its just not a planet, it's a man - and it's his world and everything just below the surface is starting to rise.L4YER CAKE answers the question: Is that all there is?  Almost as old as film itself, the crime drama has been with us for a very long time.  We've seen some highs, and too many lows to count - and for most, they may be wondering what, if anything, there is left to say about the subject.  L4YER CAKE offers us a new look into the underworld and the New World Order paved over and built on top of it (just count the number of city skyline shots, and new buildings under construction).  In this new world, everything runs to schedule, payments are made on time and in the right amounts.  Ship dates are met, street dates are kept, and the product and the money flows.  Profits soar and everyone is happy - and most of all Mr. X (Daniel Craig) the very polish of the apple.  He's clean, he's neat, he's picky, he sticks to his plans, his phone and to the business at hand - and seeing where the market is going, he's decided to cash in his chips and retire.  He's a business man through and through - even in a job where violence and death are just one good scratch away.  In short - he's the modern criminal - just above legal, alibi ready and waiting.And L4YER CAKE could have stuck to its guns here - but instead it gives us an almost reverse ""rise to power"" story by having Mr. X already at the top.  Already rich.  Already well respected.  There's no need to climb - it's all just a long fall here.  And the farther he falls, the more layers that are stripped away, the more power (and more respect) he gains - but none of it comes cheap.A tight script, excellent performances - often beautiful and creative camera work help to raise L4YER CAKE to a new level.  Fast when it needs to be, violent in all the right places (there are no murders for just effect here - everyone dies for a reason) it is at once a new kind of animal and yet a tribute to everything that has come before it.  There's comdey, drama - touches of James Bond and a direct connection to CHINATOWN that works just as well, and means just as much.  L4YER CAKE works just as well as a ganster film as it does as a dream - because there are moments when you begin to wonder what is real, and what is unreal.  Numbers play an important part in this film - from the title, to house numbers and more.  Our Mr. X is just that - he has no given name (or does he?).  L4YER CAKE bears repeat viewings, slow motion and freeze frames to get the full effect - so those with working thumbs prepare to press PUASE often.The disc comes feature packed - there's a host of deleated scenes and two alternate endings that do not work (the one at the end of the film is perfect - and adds more fuel to the fire as to what is real and what is not).  Commentary is included, and while a bit slow - and little tech heavy (music, sets, actors - too hot one day, too cold the next - you know the drill) is serviceable.For everyone who has been in for the long haul when it comes to gangster films - L4YER CAKE is a great payoff, and for those just jumping it - it's a great place to start, and then work backwards from.

Of course, none of this is going to be as simple as all that.""Layer Cake"", the new British gangster film from director Matthew Vaughn, is the latest in a string of stylish films depicting gangsters and drug dealers produced by the same people who worked on ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"".Much like the earlier films by Guy Ritchie, ""Layer Cake"" has a sweeping visual style. I don't mean that the style is grand, but the camera moves a lot. The movements are very fluid and stylish and this helps to add a lot of visual panache to the film. Following the character played by Daniel Craig (who is not named in the film) as he walks towards a door, the camera may then pick up another character as they walk out of a door in another building. Or the camera may focus on a golf ball in one persons hand and the shot changes to a close-up on another character's eye.A character might relate a story, as the camera pans across the room, moving across a doorway, into the room where the story is set. We then watch the images of the story, as the character describes them. Frequently, the camera continues moving out of the room and back into the room of the story teller. The transition is usually brief but effective. Watching the other events keeps things moving, but also keeps them interesting, because we are looking at a visual of the events being described, rather than just listening to a description.Because of these transition elements, there are very few traditional `cuts' in the film, allowing the viewer to really lose themselves in the story. It is an effective way to bring us into this world. To help us believe that we are a part of the story and the action.This is also the type of film where everyone has the same facial expression throughout. They're gangsters. They are supposed to be heartless bastards. Normally, this would drive me crazy, but in this film, it works. Craig's character is not quite the hardened criminal that he portrays. He is a normal guy, who happens to be very successful in his trade. One of the reasons he wants out of the business is that he can't handle the violence. He maintains a stony grimace because he has to. If he doesn't, he will be killed. The few times circumstances seem to be out of his control, he does reveal a little emotion. This helps make his character all the more real, and helps to make the lack of emotion in the remainder of the film seem all the more necessary. If they show emotion, they could get robbed, killed, or worse.The story is nothing new. We have all seen dozens of films in which a criminal wants to retire. Everyone makes it more difficult for him than he wants. Every character wants something from every other character. Again, nothing new. But ""Cake"" takes this to a new extreme. As they say, the Devils in the details. As we watch the story unfold, it becomes more and more complicated. Every character wants something from someone else, but they are also working other angles and cons, double-crossing the people double-crossing them while working angles on third or fourth parties, who are probably double-crossing yet other people. Some may need a scorecard to keep all of the machinations straight. I'm not even sure I followed everything. Because there is so much going on, I was never bored.""Layer Cake"" is a stylish, interesting, involving film about people you would never want to meet on a street corner.",4,"Sylish, involving, perhaps too complicated.",1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,3915,"['successful', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'retire', 'Everyone', 'know', 'help', 'one', 'last', 'project', 'errand', 'favor', 'Jimmy', 'Kenneth', 'Cranham', 'boss', 'help', 'find', 'daughter', 'rival', 'Eddie', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'daughter', 'slipped', 'drugs', 'gone', 'missing', 'Gene', 'Colm', 'Meaney', 'crew', 'want', 'help', 'one', 'last', 'large', 'order', 'E', 'pills', 'Amsterdam', 'also', 'Sammy', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'girlfriend', 'rival', 'love', 'course', 'none', 'going', 'be', 'as', 'simple', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'new', 'British', 'gangster', 'film', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'latest', 'string', 'stylish', 'films', 'depicting', 'gangsters', 'drug', 'dealers', 'produced', 'same', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'Snatch', '.Much', 'earlier', 'films', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'sweeping', 'visual', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'style', 'grand', 'camera', 'lot', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'fluid', 'stylish', 'add', 'lot', 'visual', 'panache', 'film', 'Following', 'character', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'who', 'not', 'named', 'film', 'door', 'camera', 'may', 'then', 'pick', 'up', 'character', 'walk', 'door', 'building', 'camera', 'may', 'focus', 'golf', 'ball', 'one', 'persons', 'hand', 'shot', 'changes', 'close-up', 'character', 'eye.A', 'character', 'might', 'relate', 'story', 'camera', 'room', 'moving', 'doorway', 'room', 'where', 'story', 'set', 'then', 'watch', 'images', 'story', 'character', 'Frequently', 'camera', 'moving', 'room', 'back', 'room', 'story', 'teller', 'transition', 'usually', 'brief', 'effective', 'Watching', 'other', 'events', 'things', 'moving', 'also', 'interesting', 'are', 'looking', 'visual', 'events', 'being', 'described', 'rather', 'just', 'listening', 'description.Because', 'transition', 'elements', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'traditional', 'cuts', 'film', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'really', 'lose', 'story', 'effective', 'way', 'bring', 'world', 'help', 'believe', 'are', 'part', 'story', 'action.This', 'also', 'type', 'film', 'where', 'everyone', 'same', 'facial', 'expression', ""'re"", 'gangsters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'heartless', 'bastards', 'Normally', 'would', 'drive', 'crazy', 'film', 'Craig', 'character', 'not', 'quite', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'normal', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'trade', 'One', 'reasons', 'business', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'violence', 'stony', 'grimace', ""n't"", 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'few', 'times', 'circumstances', 'seem', 'be', 'control', 'reveal', 'little', 'emotion', 'make', 'character', 'more', 'real', 'make', 'lack', 'emotion', 'remainder', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'necessary', 'show', 'emotion', 'could', 'get', 'robbed', 'killed', 'worse.The', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'have', 'seen', 'dozens', 'films', 'criminal', 'retire', 'Everyone', 'more', 'difficult', 'character', 'something', 'other', 'character', 'Again', 'nothing', 'new', 'Cake', 'new', 'extreme', 'say', 'Devils', 'details', 'watch', 'story', 'unfold', 'more', 'more', 'complicated', 'character', 'something', 'someone', 'else', 'are', 'also', 'working', 'other', 'angles', 'cons', 'double-crossing', 'people', 'double-crossing', 'working', 'angles', 'third', 'fourth', 'parties', 'who', 'are', 'probably', 'double-crossing', 'yet', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'need', 'scorecard', 'keep', 'machinations', 'straight', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'followed', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'stylish', 'interesting', 'involving', 'film', 'people', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'meet', 'street', 'corner']",Layer Cake

Then the problems just drop in his lap - crime boss Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) wants the impossible, reckless drug dealer The Duke (Jamie Foreman) is desperate to make cash of his huge collection of pills, and a sly crime boss (Dragan Micanovic) wants XXXX dead.  Also, XXXX falls in love with a beautiful blonde (Sienna Miller) and befriends a wise crime boss (Michael Gambon).The cast is great.  Daniel Craig is fantastic - he'll make a very fine, albeit quite different 007.  George Harris and Colm Meaney are very good as XXXX's business partners, Morty and Gene.  Gambon is especially fine, playing a character quite different from his most popular role, Albus Dumbledore.Matthew Vaughn, who produced Guy Ritchie's hits ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."", makes an astounding directorial debut.  There's some amazing stuff in here.  To me, the most amazing scene of the film involves a murder inside a cafe.  It was so unusually filmed and edited, it just blew me away.The screenplay, by J.J. Connolly from his novel, is absorbing, occasionally funny, and very well-written.  There's also an excellent soundtrack, including songs from The Cult and The Rolling Stones and a great score by Ilan Eshkeri & Lisa Gerrard.""Layer Cake"" blew me away.

916072,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009X7BD2,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","The trend of UK gangster films keeps going on with `Layer Cake.' Matthew Vaughn, producer of successful `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and `Snatch,' debuts in the movie world as director with `Layer Cake' very stylish thriller about an unnamed cocaine dealer (Daniel Craig) who finds himself trapped in a tight spot without his knowing. `Layer Cake' is about this protagonist (only referred to as XXXX) and other gangsters (mostly with unique personalities), and after all, is about who can eat his cake and have it.The film starts with Daniel Craig's character confidently talking to us about the rules of the business, and showing how he manages his jobs as a professional dealer carefully and methodically. During this introductory part you see the underworld where XXXX lives as he sees it, how the business is carried out, and some of his trusted partners or his immediate superior Gene (Colm Meaney).When he thinks everything is fine, he is ordered by his boss to find a missing girl. Then things start to go wrong: his partner suddenly beats someone in a diner; a Serb mobster threatens him to give what he doesn't have; and a mysterious gentleman appears before him, telling him something he should have known long before.[LAYER ONE TOO MANY] The film successfully keeps us guessing with tightly edited sequences, but perhaps its surprises are more effective with one less twist in the second half. The photography is all stylish, and the actors did fine jobs, especially Daniel Craig who manages to give depth to his unnamed character, and Michael Gambon who steals every scene with the chilling menace hidden behind his quiet attitudes.Unlike Guy Ritchie films, you cannot say `Layer Cake' is a trend-setting film, not because this British noir is inferior to others, but simply because it arrived several years too late.

916073,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0009X7BD2,Turfseer,"[1, 2]","*** This review contains spoilers ***Here's a movie that I had to watch four times to basically understand what was going on. And I'm still not completely sure about all the details of the plot. Part of the problem was those thick British accents and all the local references which I was clueless about. Fortunately, I swallowed my pride and put on the English subtitles for my third and fourth viewings. Boy did that help! And the pithy Wikipedia plot summary also worked wonders!Layer Cake is based on J.J. Connolly's talky novel and you could say that the film version is dialogue heavy. Sometimes that's a good thing (the dialogue is very clever) but at other times, scenes seem a bit too long and draggy.We never learn the the name of the protagonist who's played by Daniel Craig (the character is referred to 'XXXX' in the credits--let's just call him 'Craig' for short). Craig reminds me very much of a modern-day Steve McQueen. He's a drug dealer who views himself as a businessman, not a thug. His supplier is the older gangster Jimmy Price who summons Craig to a ritzy club for lunch and demands that he find Charlotte, the drug addict daughter of Eddie Temple who's disappeared (Temple, another older gangster is far more sophisticated than the impulsive Jimmy). The search for the missing daughter is merely a sub-plot in the film; the main plot involves Jimmy ordering Craig to purchase a large amount of Ecstasy pills under the control of 'The Duke', a foul-mouthed psychopath who always has Slasher at his side, a nervous nilly of a girlfriend who always seems to be putting her foot in her mouth.Director Matthew Vaughn (who produced Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock & Barrel') has made it a point that he wanted to make a 'serious' gangster picture and not copy Ritchie's style which often employs humor (mainly black comedy). Unfortunately, some of the characters in Layer Cake are unintentionally funny. Take for example Duke and Slasher fumbling for directions as they try to locate the Serbians' lair. And what about when Slasher loses control of her machine gun during the robbery and shoots one of the workers? Other instances of pure idiocy occur later in the film.I had a hard time believing that Duke and his hapless crew could so easily rip off the nasty Serbs (how exactly do they catch the Serbs by surprise?). And why doesn't The Duke simply kill the Serbians--they are supposed to be ruthless, aren't they? The Duke ends up falsely bragging on the street that Craig is connected with him and before you know it, the Serbians are after him too! Craig and his crew want to slap The Duke around for his indiscretion, but when they arrive at the boatyard where Duke's middleman was working on moving the purloined merchandise, they find the man dead, obviously the victim of the Serb's enforcer, the dark assassin, Dragan.I forgot to mention that Craig has already met Duke's gangster wannabe nephew and his sexy girlfriend, Tammy (Sienna Miller). The story begins to drag when Craig's hired associates find Charlotte's boyfriend, Kinky, dead up at the drug rehab facility (the scene could have been easily cut by a good ten minutes). And then there's Director Vaughn trying to imitate early Tarrantino when he has Craig's right hand man, Morty, stomp and scald low-life Freddie Hurst (Jimmy's right hand man, Gene, explains to Craig in a flashback that years ago, Freddie was responsible for Morty going to prison for ten years-- the bizarre tales involves a hoodlum committing suicide in a crowded restaurant, Morty being found with the body in the back of the van by the police after Freddie falls asleep as the getaway driver).More unintentional comedy occurs after Gene gives Craig a gun. Craig can't help himself as he blurts out his tremendous disdain for the use of firearms and the next minute he's deftly wielding a weapon and has morphed into a professional assassin. Somehow the character transformation is supposed to be funny but I just didn't get it.  Sienna Miller has one short unconsummated sex scene with Craig who's suddenly kidnapped by Temple who plays him a recording proving that Jimmy is a police informer. More dumb criminals: Jimmy, it turns out, has been suckered into a bad investment by some African scam artists. In the most ludicrous scene in the entire movie, Craig somehow gains access to Jimmy's estate and murders him (how does he get past security?). Despite no longer having access to his laundered money (his accountant has flown the coop), Craig makes a deal with Eddie to sell him the stolen Ecstasy pills. Oh yes, more silly Tarrantino stuff: Jean beats Craig to a pulp for killing Jimmy but then forgives him after hearing the recording of Jimmy spilling the beans. Craig is as dumb as the rest when he convinces his Liverpool gang associates to lend him their hit man so they can ambush Dragan in a public park. Wouldn't you know it, but Dragan has been waiting for them all along and easily takes out the hit-man.The Layer Cake climax seems rushed (and not very 'layered'). The police end up confiscating the pills during a raid and Dragan lets Craig off the hook once he brings him Duke's decapitated head in a cooler (the Serbs aren't upset since they're now manufacturing gobs of Ecstasy pills). How does Eddie end up with the loot? I think two of Craig's associates manage to pilfer some in an armed robbery of a Serb courier (?). As for Craig, the gang wants to make him the new boss but just as he walks out, he's cut down by Sidney, the Duke's nephew, who's jealous that Craig has taken his girl.I'm afraid 'Layer Cake'has a few too many 'layers' for me. With its unnecessary subplots, gratuitous violence and convoluted plot that doesn't always make sense, I can't claim to be a big fan. On the other hand, I did enjoy trying to figure out what was going on.

916074,A2MNMZMM6BGLTA,B0009X7BD2,"Uncle Chino ""Johnny""","[1, 8]",I had heard about this movie and was curious to see it. I knew that Daniel Craig was picked to be the new James Bond and I liked him in Tomb Raider and in Munich. This movie was ok but just ok. I thought that it had too many characters and too much going on and it was too long. But I guess for as much as they were trying to get in you needed that much time. I just didn't enjoy the movie that much. Craig was ok but nothing great and Sienna Miller? Come on. I mean she was on the cover and on the back of the box and her part amounted to that of a potted plant. Of course they did have her in a ligerie scene that went no where but for her to even be on the box for as small as her role was was ridiculous. The other characters were ok but there were just too many and because there were too many they were all pretty much under developed and hard to follow.
