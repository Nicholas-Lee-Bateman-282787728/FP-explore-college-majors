512365,A3QXG5YRNR4EQX,B00001YXCD,Brian,"[5, 12]","This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  In fact, it's literally used up my crappy movie quota for the entire next year and maybe the year beyond that.  There's a number of issues on why this movie is so unfathomably bad.- For one, the entire budget apparently was spent getting actors Christopher Walkin and William Dafoe.  So, everything else was done on a shoestring.  This is not of itself bad.  But the money was clearly not used wisely.  Which means they have a number of scenes that break the cardinal rule of movies which is show it, don't say it.- Main characters, whose acting is also equally bad to the production values, spend time in scenes talking about what they're doing, have done, and will do, rather than using any sense of cinematography to *show* the viewer.- The guy the main characters are ""attacking"" never appears in the movie outside them watching a few quick scenes of him in surveillance videos.  Again, this would be fine if the videos gave any sense of the character at all.  Such brilliant lines are uttered like ""Look at him.  He's a genius"" in response to a 3 second video of an asian man flipping over a circuit board the same as a chimp in a cage would flip over a rock.  Your pet dog could come up with better dialog than this.- There's virtually no direction at all.  This movie attempts to appear both gritty and noire at the same time and manages to fail at both.  There's a bunch of scenes of the wet street after rain and blacked out characters running in front of a light source.  This should, in theory, look cool and art-deco, but it just ends up looking like a 12-year old produced this with his mom's VHS video recorder for a Jr High School class.- William Gibson is an interesting writer, but his movies have never translated well to film.  Johny Neumonic was a pretty lackluster film, but looks amazing in comparison to this.  The story here is likely to go over a lot of normal people's heads, but given the crowd that would be attracted to this movie to begin with (scifi fans), it is likely to end up insulting the target audience quite a bit through wasting their time and mental prowess through poor quality, horribly wooden acting, and transparent and shallow plot.If you're considering this movie I suggest going for a walk and thinking a bit or going fishing instead.  There's far more intellectual grit to be had via these activities over wasting your valuable time with movies like this that should seriously be banished off the face of the earth and hidden from alien species in case they ever land here for fear of what they may think of the human species for nonsense such as this.",1,Should be launched into the sun to save humanity,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,2651,"['easily', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fact', 'literally', 'used', 'up', 'crappy', 'movie', 'quota', 'entire', 'next', 'year', 'maybe', 'year', 'number', 'issues', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'unfathomably', 'bad.-', 'one', 'entire', 'budget', 'apparently', 'was', 'spent', 'getting', 'actors', 'Christopher', 'Walkin', 'William', 'Dafoe', 'So', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'done', 'shoestring', 'not', 'bad', 'money', 'was', 'clearly', 'not', 'used', 'wisely', 'Which', 'have', 'number', 'scenes', 'break', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'movies', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'it.-', 'Main', 'characters', 'acting', 'also', 'equally', 'bad', 'production', 'values', 'spend', 'time', 'scenes', 'talking', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'have', 'done', 'will', 'do', 'rather', 'using', 'sense', 'cinematography', '*show*', 'viewer.-', 'guy', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'attacking', 'never', 'movie', 'watching', 'few', 'quick', 'scenes', 'surveillance', 'videos', 'Again', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'videos', 'gave', 'sense', 'character', 'Such', 'brilliant', 'lines', 'are', 'uttered', 'Look', 'genius', 'response', '3', 'second', 'video', 'asian', 'man', 'flipping', 'circuit', 'board', 'same', 'chimp', 'cage', 'would', 'flip', 'rock', 'pet', 'dog', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'dialog', 'this.-', 'virtually', 'direction', 'movie', 'appear', 'gritty', 'noire', 'same', 'time', 'manages', 'fail', 'bunch', 'scenes', 'wet', 'street', 'rain', 'blacked', 'out', 'characters', 'running', 'front', 'light', 'source', 'should', 'theory', 'look', 'cool', 'art-deco', 'just', 'up', 'looking', '12-year', 'old', 'produced', 'mom', 'VHS', 'video', 'recorder', 'Jr', 'High', 'School', 'class.-', 'William', 'Gibson', 'interesting', 'writer', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'translated', 'well', 'film', 'Johny', 'Neumonic', 'was', 'pretty', 'lackluster', 'film', 'amazing', 'comparison', 'story', 'here', 'likely', 'go', 'over', 'lot', 'normal', 'people', 'heads', 'given', 'crowd', 'would', 'be', 'attracted', 'movie', 'begin', 'scifi', 'fans', 'likely', 'end', 'up', 'insulting', 'target', 'audience', 'quite', 'bit', 'wasting', 'time', 'mental', 'prowess', 'poor', 'quality', 'horribly', 'wooden', 'acting', 'transparent', 'shallow', 'plot.If', ""'re"", 'considering', 'movie', 'suggest', 'going', 'walk', 'thinking', 'bit', 'going', 'fishing', 'instead', 'far', 'more', 'intellectual', 'grit', 'be', 'had', 'activities', 'wasting', 'valuable', 'time', 'movies', 'should', 'seriously', 'be', 'banished', 'face', 'earth', 'hidden', 'alien', 'species', 'case', 'ever', 'land', 'here', 'fear', 'what', 'may', 'think', 'human', 'species', 'nonsense', 'such']",New Rose Hotel

However, I've seen most of Abel Ferrara's films and liked them plus I generally go for anything with Willem Dafoe in it.  Walken is a favorite too.  Hubby absolutely adored it and would probably go the whole 5 stars if he were writing this, which puts him at variance with almost everyone.  I can't go that far but I will go 4 stars.  The plot is not that tricky.  What is tricky is knowing what moment of time you are in with the characters.  At any given moment you can be at the start, middle or end of the story. In this it rather resembles &quot;Memento,&quot; which is in the theaters now.  Ferrara should have considered changes in lighting or some other visual key to cue the viewers into this time shifts.  I've seen this done by shooting part of a film in black and white and the rest in color.  I've also seen one time sequence shot in all cool or blue tones while the rest of the movie is shot in reddish hot tones.  In short, there are ways to make this easier on the viewer.  The plot is that Walken and Dafoe are going to make an Asian scientist fall in love with a call girl they've just met, Sandy.  Sandy will bewitch the scientist and he will go wherever she wants him to go. Industrialists will pay Walken and Dafoe big money for the con.  They in turn will pay Sandy a million dollars as her share.  The question becomes though who is conning whom. While Dafoe is busy falling in love with Sandy, he doesn't follow through on tracing the various leads about her which come into his hands. One irony I couldn't get over was Dafoe being stunned by someone else's beauty, when, in his prime, he had to have been one of the most beautiful people on the planet. Move this back to the 1980s and probably no one would be looking at the call girls in this film! My absolute favorite movie by Ferrara is &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; with Harvey Keitel in the starring role.  Keitel gives the performance of his life in that film and it is much easier to follow than this one. Before you totally write off this film maker, you might give that one a a try if all the negative reviews on this one are too much for you.",4,We Liked It &amp; Even Watched It Twice!,990144000,"05 18, 2001",2001,2216,"['Apparently', 'most', 'viewers', 'hate', 'movie', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'follow', 'grant', 'However', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'films', 'liked', 'generally', 'go', 'anything', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Walken', 'favorite', 'too', 'Hubby', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'would', 'probably', 'go', 'whole', '5', 'stars', 'were', 'writing', 'variance', 'almost', 'everyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'will', 'go', '4', 'stars', 'plot', 'not', 'tricky', 'What', 'tricky', 'knowing', 'what', 'moment', 'time', 'are', 'characters', 'given', 'moment', 'can', 'be', 'start', 'middle', 'end', 'story', 'rather', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'theaters', 'now', 'Ferrara', 'should', 'have', 'considered', 'changes', 'lighting', 'other', 'visual', 'key', 'cue', 'viewers', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'shooting', 'part', 'film', 'black', 'white', 'rest', 'color', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'one', 'time', 'sequence', 'shot', 'cool', 'blue', 'tones', 'rest', 'movie', 'shot', 'reddish', 'hot', 'tones', 'short', 'are', 'ways', 'make', 'easier', 'viewer', 'plot', 'Walken', 'Dafoe', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'Asian', 'scientist', 'fall', 'love', 'call', 'girl', ""'ve"", 'just', 'met', 'Sandy', 'Sandy', 'will', 'bewitch', 'scientist', 'will', 'go', 'wherever', 'go', 'Industrialists', 'will', 'pay', 'Walken', 'Dafoe', 'big', 'money', 'con', 'turn', 'will', 'pay', 'Sandy', 'million', 'dollars', 'share', 'question', 'who', 'conning', 'whom', 'Dafoe', 'busy', 'falling', 'love', 'Sandy', ""n't"", 'follow', 'tracing', 'various', 'leads', 'come', 'hands', 'One', 'irony', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'over', 'was', 'Dafoe', 'being', 'stunned', 'someone', 'else', 'beauty', 'when', 'prime', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'people', 'planet', 'Move', 'back', '1980s', 'probably', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'looking', 'call', 'girls', 'film', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Ferrara', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'quot', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'starring', 'role', 'Keitel', 'performance', 'life', 'film', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'one', 'totally', 'write', 'off', 'film', 'maker', 'might', 'give', 'one', 'try', 'negative', 'reviews', 'one', 'are', 'too', 'much']",New Rose Hotel
512367,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00001YXCD,D. Mok,"[2, 5]","I bought this one because a) it's hard to find on video and b) the idiosyncratic Asia Argento is in it.  Interesting to follow her career up to this point, a mix of strange arthouse films (New Rose Hotel, B. Monkey)  and European productions (Phantom of the Opera, La Reine Margot).But New  Rose Hotel was an eyesore.Abel Ferrara's continued pretenses towards  some kind of metaphysical statement are beginning to annoy greatly.  New  Rose Hotel is just as heavy-handed, drug-clouded, boring, and pretentiously  acted as any '90s Ferrara film (aside from the more accessible commercial  fare The Body Snatchers and the acclaimed Bad Lieutenant).  Ferrara manages  to take two great actors, Willem Dafoe and Asia Argento, and direct them in  such a way as to eliminate both of them of any charm whatsoever.  His idea  of internal complexity seems to be letting Dafoe sit in the dark with a  pensive expression on his face.  And Christopher Walken?  He's been  sleepwalking all the way through the '90s, saddled with role after role  where he tries to be cool and impenetrable, succeeding only in being a  nuisance.The DVD's filmographies are interesting as is the &quot;trivia  game&quot; concept, though the film itself is so incredibly uninvolving  that I would hardly recommend adding this DVD to a collection.",1,Feels like yanking off a molar with thumb and forefinger.,947116800,"01 6, 2000",2000,1312,"['bought', 'one', 'hard', 'find', 'video', 'b', 'idiosyncratic', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'Interesting', 'follow', 'career', 'up', 'point', 'mix', 'strange', 'arthouse', 'films', 'New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'B.', 'Monkey', 'European', 'productions', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'La', 'Reine', 'Margot', '.But', 'New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'was', 'eyesore.Abel', 'Ferrara', 'continued', 'pretenses', 'towards', 'kind', 'metaphysical', 'statement', 'are', 'beginning', 'annoy', 'greatly', 'New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'just', 'heavy-handed', 'drug-clouded', 'boring', 'pretentiously', 'acted', ""'90s"", 'Ferrara', 'film', 'aside', 'more', 'accessible', 'commercial', 'fare', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'acclaimed', 'Bad', 'Lieutenant', 'Ferrara', 'take', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'direct', 'way', 'eliminate', 'charm', 'whatsoever', 'idea', 'internal', 'complexity', 'be', 'letting', 'Dafoe', 'sit', 'dark', 'pensive', 'expression', 'face', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'been', 'sleepwalking', 'way', ""'90s"", 'saddled', 'role', 'role', 'where', 'be', 'cool', 'impenetrable', 'succeeding', 'only', 'being', 'nuisance.The', 'DVD', 'filmographies', 'are', 'interesting', 'quot', 'game', 'quot', 'concept', 'film', 'so', 'incredibly', 'uninvolving', 'would', 'hardly', 'recommend', 'adding', 'DVD', 'collection']",New Rose Hotel
512368,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B00001YXCD,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","As the Cyberpunk genre of Science Fiction writing grew in both authorship and readership, it only made sense that Hollywood would try it's hand at re-creating it in film. The results have been mostly dismal. Johnny Mnemonic and Paycheck might have had the plot elements but were way short of the ""feel"" so prevalent in the writing. Maybe they suffered from the star power or excessive budgeting or whatever but they were way short of the mark.Enter Abel Ferrara. I'll say up front I like much of his work, with The King of New York being my favorite. The first time I saw it I was a bit confused as to all the things going on in the plot line, but the feeling of the film stayed with me to the point where I had to see it again. Now it's in my library and I watch it a couple of times a year. This is what makes this film mostly (but not entirely) successful. Of the several movies I've seen delving into Cyberpunk this is the one that comes closest to approaching the feeling of the Gibsian not too distant future, over technologized, over incorporated society. Things are moving at a breakneck pace and the stakes are high. The genius stroke in technology can put one company on top and another in the grave and that's pretty much what is happening here. Chris Walken and Willem Defoe are the primaries in a scheme to get a top engineer from one company to another and things go really bad.The plot is great to a point but the problem is that it doesn't really end. It stops. The climax comes way too early and there's no reason to keep the movie going but it does for what seems like forever. I won't spoil things but Defoe ends up in a cubby hole at ""The New Rose Hotel"" replaying the events in his mind and the viewer must now re-watch many of the scenes he's already watched. Was the script that bad or did they simply run out of money. Maybe they thought they had a 90 minute movie and only had 75 minutes after the final cut.

It is this director's raw talent in directing, as seen in all his gritty thrillers, combined with a great SF author and good job by the screen writer. I do not write reviews about romances or comedies, and I wish some others who do not care for a genre would offer the same courtesy. This is an excellent film. I had no trouble following the story, but had read the short story 10 years prior- so was vaguely familiar.

512374,A7FDSGMP1F8PA,B00001YXCD,John M. Thompson,"[9, 14]","But preternaturally awful in film.Since Gibson's accomplishments as a writer of science fiction include the  coining of the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; and several field-advancing novels that  shaped the  entire course of the cyberpunk sub-genre, it seems an amazing  thing that a  half-decent film based on one of his books either:A) Cannot be made.  B) Cannot be made even with him writing the screenplay.  C) Cannot be made  with a trillion dollars and an executive order compelling  every last  American citizen to watch and enjoy it.Some of us have had the  misfortune of watching _Johnny Mnemonic_, an  extrapolation by Gibson on  one of his short stories from the _Burning  Chrome_ collection.  Even in a  career as uneven as Keanu Reeves has had,  it's one of the weaker efforts  in a portfolio that includes _Point Break_._Point Break_.  For the love  of God.This latest effort, also taken from the aforementioned  collection of short  stories, is called _New Rose Hotel_, which stars  Christopher Walken, Willem  Dafoe and Asia Argento, an actress of whom I  had not previously heard.  The  plot, insofar as it goes, is that a  maverick researcher from one genetic  engineering concern in Germany is  wanted by another in Japan.  Walken and  Dafoe engage in a sort of  intellectual larceny by convincing the unhappy and  talented to disappear  from their current employers and relocate to one who  pays Walken and  Dafoe.  Asia Argento, whose name and soft Italo-Hispanic  contralto suggest  a career that will unfold between the hours of 2 and 6  a.m. on Cinemax,  plays a postmodern lounge singer whose act includes two  other women  kissing and caressing her through each song.  Walken has the  brilliant  idea to recruit Argento to seduce his quarry for corporate  relocation, and  it falls to Dafoe to train her properly through no fewer  than three nude  sequences.I love the work of William Gibson and want to see it onscreen  in as many well-conceived adaptations as Hollywood's small collective mind  will permit.  This film is not under that category, and in fact is so far  away from  being in it that particles of light currently at that category  may not reach  this film for several decades.  I guess that I can forgive  Dafoe and Walken  - we all have balloon mortgage payments or bone-marrow  transplants or  something that might justify appearing in this for some  undisclosed fortune  - and Asia Argento will probably never have a chance  to work in more  dignified settings.Apparently the director's idea of  conveying a dark, near-future setting is  to film his researcher in grainy  segments that look like an extremely weak  television signal for a show  that no one wants to view.  The omnipresence  and power of the corporation,  Japanese culture and all of Gibson's other  touches that define the  contiguous world of his books are not here.  Anywhere.  The coffin hotel of  the New Rose outside of Narita International  is as close as it gets, and  by the time you see that you have tired  completely of the film's last  third, which is Dafoe and Walken having  flashbacks of the film's  uninteresting first two-thirds.Even though I felt suspicious of a DVD  title priced less than one night at  the base theater with Junior Mints, I  felt that a smaller-scale film  released without any pretense of competing  at the box office might be worth  it.  Possibly.  But don't buy, rent or  allow yourself to waste precious  hours of consciousness on this.",1,William Gibson: Great in Print...,962841600,"07 6, 2000",2000,3486,"['preternaturally', 'awful', 'film.Since', 'Gibson', 'accomplishments', 'writer', 'science', 'fiction', 'include', 'coining', 'term', 'quot', 'cyberspace', 'quot', 'several', 'field-advancing', 'novels', 'shaped', 'entire', 'course', 'cyberpunk', 'sub-genre', 'amazing', 'thing', 'half-decent', 'film', 'based', 'one', 'books', 'Can', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'B', 'Can', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'even', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'C', 'Can', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'trillion', 'dollars', 'executive', 'order', 'compelling', 'last', 'American', 'citizen', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'it.Some', 'have', 'had', 'misfortune', 'watching', '_Johnny', 'Mnemonic_', 'extrapolation', 'Gibson', 'one', 'short', 'stories', '_Burning', 'Chrome_', 'collection', 'Even', 'career', 'as', 'uneven', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'had', 'one', 'weaker', 'efforts', 'portfolio', '_Point', 'Break_._Point', 'Break_', 'love', 'God.This', 'latest', 'effort', 'also', 'taken', 'aforementioned', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'called', '_New', 'Rose', 'Hotel_', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'actress', 'whom', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'heard', 'plot', 'insofar', 'maverick', 'researcher', 'one', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'concern', 'Germany', 'wanted', 'Japan', 'Walken', 'Dafoe', 'engage', 'sort', 'intellectual', 'larceny', 'convincing', 'unhappy', 'talented', 'disappear', 'current', 'employers', 'relocate', 'one', 'who', 'Walken', 'Dafoe', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'name', 'soft', 'Italo-Hispanic', 'contralto', 'suggest', 'career', 'will', 'unfold', 'hours', '2', '6', 'a.m.', 'Cinemax', 'postmodern', 'lounge', 'singer', 'act', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'kissing', 'caressing', 'song', 'Walken', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'recruit', 'Argento', 'seduce', 'quarry', 'corporate', 'relocation', 'Dafoe', 'train', 'properly', 'fewer', 'three', 'nude', 'sequences.I', 'love', 'work', 'William', 'Gibson', 'want', 'see', 'onscreen', 'as', 'many', 'well-conceived', 'adaptations', 'Hollywood', 'small', 'collective', 'mind', 'will', 'permit', 'film', 'not', 'category', 'fact', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'being', 'light', 'currently', 'category', 'may', 'not', 'reach', 'film', 'several', 'decades', 'guess', 'can', 'forgive', 'Dafoe', 'Walken', 'have', 'balloon', 'mortgage', 'payments', 'bone-marrow', 'transplants', 'something', 'might', 'justify', 'appearing', 'undisclosed', 'fortune', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'work', 'more', 'dignified', 'settings.Apparently', 'director', 'idea', 'conveying', 'dark', 'near-future', 'setting', 'film', 'researcher', 'grainy', 'segments', 'look', 'extremely', 'weak', 'television', 'signal', 'show', 'one', 'view', 'omnipresence', 'power', 'corporation', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Gibson', 'other', 'touches', 'define', 'contiguous', 'world', 'books', 'are', 'not', 'here', 'Anywhere', 'coffin', 'hotel', 'New', 'Rose', 'Narita', 'International', 'as', 'close', 'time', 'see', 'have', 'tired', 'completely', 'film', 'last', 'third', 'Dafoe', 'Walken', 'having', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'uninteresting', 'first', 'two-thirds.Even', 'felt', 'suspicious', 'DVD', 'title', 'priced', 'less', 'one', 'night', 'base', 'theater', 'Junior', 'Mints', 'felt', 'smaller-scale', 'film', 'released', 'pretense', 'competing', 'box', 'office', 'might', 'be', 'Possibly', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'rent', 'allow', 'waste', 'precious', 'hours', 'consciousness']",New Rose Hotel

It probably isn't as funny as I thought it was, but I couldn't stop laughing.The rest of the movie  is dreary and slow. I really hate to condemn honest attempts at artistic  expression, and I believe that this is an honest attempt. Ferrera makes  demands on his audience--which is fine; there's no excuse for laziness--but  when those demands are met, they ought to be rewarded.  This movie does not  reward what can only be called the stoic endurance of anyone who manages to  sit through it.Other reviews have outlined the plot, so I don't need to  repeat it here.  I will say, though, that Walken and Defoe are horribly  misused in this movie.  Art doesn't need to be boring.  Tolstoy doesn't  bore us.  Hemingway doesn't bore us.  Orson Welles doesn't bore us.  Hitchcock doesn't bore us.  Why does Ferrera sacrifice content at the altar  of style?  This movie isn't only tedious, it is *needlessly* tedious.  The  movie takes a good idea, a good story, and ruins it.  You'll pull your hair  out watching Willem Defoe agonize alone in a tiny hotel room for 20  minutes.  Guess what he's agonizing over: Love.  Yawn.

Two corporate spies (Fox and X) are hired by a company (Hosaka)try to steal this Japanese scientist (Hiroshi) from one of their rivals (Maas).  The two spies end up using a call girl (Sandii) to seduce the scientist and convince him to switch sides.  X soon falls in love with Sandii and has trouble accepting her affair with Hiroshi(despite the fact that's what X and Fox hired her for).  However, everything is going according to plan and Hiroshi defects to Hosaka.  Because of this, X and Fox become millionaires overnight. Unfortunately, the plan backfires when Sandii backstabs Fox and X by defecting to Maas.  In the process of her defection; she is able to reprogram a DNA sequencer (?) that ends up killing Hiroshi and all of the top minds at Hosaka in a lab in Marrakesh that Fox and X set up to hide Hiroshi.  Hosaka first makes the millions of dollars they paid X and Fox disappear before they even had a chance to spend it and then come after Fox and X (who they believe double-crossed them when in fact Sandii double-crossed them too).  Fox gets killed and X ends up hiding out at the New Rose Hotel reminscing about what went wrong.Great story, right?  Well, if you watched the movie, you wouldn't have been able to made sense of the plot above.  It was only after reading Mr. Gibson's story that I understood the plot.

512378,A320WBLY7OKRUG,B00001YXCD,Max Zorn,"[1, 2]","Sometimes making a feature length film from a short story can work, as the director can elaborate and add texture to the story. Most of the time, short stories make bad movies, and New Rose Hotel exemplifies why. About half-way through this interesting (but ultimately empty) film, the story noticeably looses steam and goes into ""filler"" mode, where we get a bunch of flash-backs on things we've already seen. But I've jumped ahead. Here's the story.Christopher Walken and Willem DeFoe are free-lancers in a sort of dystopia of corporate rule, emotional distance, and meaningless sex. They basically ""turn"" high-level corporate employees, getting paid for facilitating the ""defection"" of these ""stars"" from one company to another - the right people can mean billions to a company's bottom line. Like many movies, we join our ""heroes"" at a critical point, where they are this/close to either the motherload score or a body bag.Enter the off-beat, talented and unconventionally gorgeous Asia Argento as the hooker with the heart of gold (or maybe stone), who they task to ""turn"" a big-time scientist-type genius dud. Needless to say, things start off one way, then twists happen that spin the story in a different direction, all complicated by DeFoe falling for the sexy Argento.Walken is excellent here, as he's allowed to really go with it, spouting lines only he can deliver, making those faces and even doing a little song and dance. DeFoe is...DeFoe - always solid, but given a character that is not completely realized, and a story that is a little transparent. But Argento is the show - sexy, tattooed and hard-to-take-your-eyes-off in a fairly explicit role (the Euros are so comfortable with their bodies...). Also ""stars"" Gretchen Mol in what is nothing more than a glorified cameo (I'm guessing some scenes wound up on the cutting room floor). See ""much more"" of her in the Bettie Page flick inwhich she stars.Unfortunately, as mentioned, the story runs out of steam, gets very ""noire""-ishly conventional, and wraps itself up quickly and unfulfillingly, as if its double-parked. It seems as if its making a statement early on (greed, nations ruled by corporations, etc...), then loses its way.Would have given this 2 stars if not for the luscious Argento, who brings a raw sexuality to her performance.

As a film it's great, obviously not the greatest thing, but it was pretty intimate. It wasn't a big ending or it wasn't much an action thriller, it wasn't that kind of picture at all. But, it was definitely a picture about the characters. The look of the film was very interesting and very dark, the score was pretty great, the acting too, great. I think Ferrara made a great film, that seems to really be something that's been misunderstood. I haven't read the William Gibson short story so i don't know how much it differs from the original story, but adaptations are hardly ever perfect, maybe a few times, but what counts is the film on it's own.

512383,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B00001YXCD,Richard Ross,"[1, 1]","New Rose Hotel, based on the short story by William Gibson , is a very confusing yet entertaining film from director Abel Ferrara. You might not be clear on what is actually happening, not at first anyway, but you will be certain of how Abel fell for his leading lady Asia Argento. The two dated for a while after the making of this film. Argento is not only incredibly sexy but she can also act. She's the best thing going for this film which stars Christopher Walken as Fox and Willem Defoe as X. The film takes place sometime in the future and major corporations are stealing top scientists from rival companies. Fox and X are trying to lure a Japanese scientist to their company. They hire a struggling prostitute and dancer named Sandi (Argento) to seduce him. She agrees to do it after they tell her how much they are going to pay her. X starts tutoring her in how to be seductive and the two fall for each other. Several steamy sex scenes follow and Fox gets wind of his partner's new fling. He worries that this will jeopardize their mission but also their friendship. Walken does a good job of showing the fear that Fox has as the older of the two who worries that his young protege is going to leave him. The basic plot is very similar to that of a classic film noir where two guys use a beautiful young woman to get information about a mystery man. One of the guys falls for the girl, the other guy gets suspicious, and someone dies. For the film's first hour it seems like scenes are being cut short and we aren't getting the full story. Abel plays the full scenes during the film's last half hour cluing us in on what he was hiding. This makes that portion of the film the most exciting since we're finally getting the full story and by this time we're invested in what  happens to X and Sandi. The acting from the three leads is excellent and there is a lot of humor in the film. Early on there is a scene between Walken and Defoe that starts off scripted and ends on a hilarious rant improvised by both men. It's a nice Abel touch. Many of the people who worked on this film worked on Abel's previous film ""The Funeral"" including Walken, Gretchen Mol, Annabella Sciorra, and Victor Argo. This film also has a great score by Ferrara regular Schooly D. Definitely worth checking out for Abel fans or for any of the three stars.",3,Abel meets his match in Asia Argento,1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,2340,"['New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'William', 'Gibson', 'very', 'confusing', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'film', 'director', 'Abel', 'Ferrara', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'clear', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'not', 'first', 'anyway', 'will', 'be', 'certain', 'how', 'Abel', 'fell', 'leading', 'lady', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'two', 'dated', 'while', 'making', 'film', 'Argento', 'not', 'only', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'can', 'also', 'act', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'film', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Fox', 'Willem', 'Defoe', 'X', 'film', 'place', 'sometime', 'future', 'major', 'corporations', 'are', 'stealing', 'top', 'scientists', 'rival', 'companies', 'Fox', 'X', 'are', 'trying', 'lure', 'Japanese', 'scientist', 'company', 'hire', 'struggling', 'prostitute', 'dancer', 'named', 'Sandi', 'Argento', 'seduce', 'do', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'going', 'pay', 'X', 'tutoring', 'how', 'be', 'seductive', 'two', 'fall', 'other', 'Several', 'steamy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'follow', 'Fox', 'wind', 'partner', 'new', 'fling', 'will', 'jeopardize', 'mission', 'also', 'friendship', 'Walken', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'fear', 'Fox', 'older', 'two', 'who', 'young', 'protege', 'going', 'leave', 'basic', 'plot', 'very', 'similar', 'classic', 'film', 'noir', 'where', 'two', 'guys', 'use', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'get', 'information', 'mystery', 'man', 'One', 'guys', 'girl', 'other', 'guy', 'suspicious', 'someone', 'dies', 'film', 'first', 'hour', 'scenes', 'are', 'being', 'cut', 'short', 'are', ""n't"", 'getting', 'full', 'story', 'Abel', 'full', 'scenes', 'film', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'cluing', 'what', 'was', 'hiding', 'portion', 'film', 'most', 'exciting', ""'re"", 'finally', 'getting', 'full', 'story', 'time', ""'re"", 'invested', 'what', 'X', 'Sandi', 'acting', 'three', 'leads', 'excellent', 'lot', 'humor', 'film', 'Early', 'scene', 'Walken', 'Defoe', 'scripted', 'hilarious', 'rant', 'improvised', 'men', 'nice', 'Abel', 'touch', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'film', 'worked', 'Abel', 'previous', 'film', 'Funeral', 'including', 'Walken', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'Annabella', 'Sciorra', 'Victor', 'Argo', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'score', 'Ferrara', 'regular', 'Schooly', 'D.', 'Definitely', 'checking', 'out', 'Abel', 'fans', 'three', 'stars']",New Rose Hotel
512384,A384MT68QQGNJ7,B00001YXCD,Sean Curtin,"[3, 3]","Look, it's like this.The story New Rose Hotel, by William Gibson is one which hilights the decay of society through peoples own self destructive impulses and that never ending bain of humanity greed.As a story, New Rose Hotel is to be honest way to short to even contemplate making a movie out of it.  There's just not enough there and when I watch the movie, it shows immensely.  Dafoe and Walken are 2 of my favourite actors and there performance together I found to be of good status.  What this movie needed to do was give the viewer a good explanation as to the status of the society , this different world, basically an atmosphere.  Instead it gives you a blurred corporate scene and then your thrown into a bar with women that can't sing and the 2 main characters forcing themselves to make out there enjoying the poor entertainment.  The exchanging of information should have been more secretive and when people wispered in others ears you should have been given a zoom on that audio. Then there was the main guts of the story, with the nano technologist.  This was what could have been the movies saviour, alas it was brushed over and the conversations where the main focus of the movie.  This brings me to my last annoyance. The person in charge of camera directing should have been .... Instead of seeing people interacting together at important sections of the story, you got terrible close ups of single faces that were below amateur quality and destracted you from the dialogue.  All in all Gibson should have written extra material for the movie and a lot more should have been spent on atmosphere to enhance the intrigue of the story, even if it meant getting more cost effective actors. ...I like to end with a positive note, and the only one I can make as far as capturing the story goes, is that the end scene that Dafoe acted out at the end was effective enough.If your like me and a fan of William Gibson and these two great actors, you may want this movie as part of your collection, but I tell you now, after your first viewing it's one that will sit and gather dust very quickly.",2,A movie that could have been.,1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,2103,"['Look', 'this.The', 'story', 'New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'William', 'Gibson', 'one', 'decay', 'society', 'peoples', 'own', 'self', 'destructive', 'impulses', 'never', 'ending', 'bain', 'humanity', 'greed.As', 'story', 'New', 'Rose', 'Hotel', 'be', 'honest', 'way', 'short', 'even', 'contemplate', 'making', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'there', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'immensely', 'Dafoe', 'Walken', 'are', '2', 'favourite', 'actors', 'performance', 'together', 'found', 'be', 'good', 'status', 'What', 'movie', 'needed', 'do', 'was', 'give', 'viewer', 'good', 'explanation', 'status', 'society', 'different', 'world', 'basically', 'atmosphere', 'Instead', 'blurred', 'corporate', 'scene', 'then', 'thrown', 'bar', 'women', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sing', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'forcing', 'make', 'out', 'there', 'enjoying', 'poor', 'entertainment', 'exchanging', 'information', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'secretive', 'when', 'people', 'wispered', 'others', 'ears', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'zoom', 'audio', 'Then', 'was', 'main', 'guts', 'story', 'nano', 'technologist', 'was', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movies', 'saviour', 'alas', 'was', 'brushed', 'conversations', 'where', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'last', 'annoyance', 'person', 'charge', 'camera', 'directing', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Instead', 'seeing', 'people', 'interacting', 'together', 'important', 'sections', 'story', 'got', 'terrible', 'close', 'ups', 'single', 'were', 'amateur', 'quality', 'destracted', 'dialogue', 'Gibson', 'should', 'have', 'written', 'extra', 'material', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'atmosphere', 'enhance', 'intrigue', 'story', 'even', 'meant', 'getting', 'more', 'cost', 'effective', 'actors', 'like', 'end', 'positive', 'note', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'as', 'far', 'capturing', 'story', 'end', 'scene', 'Dafoe', 'acted', 'out', 'end', 'was', 'effective', 'enough.If', 'fan', 'William', 'Gibson', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'may', 'want', 'movie', 'part', 'collection', 'tell', 'now', 'first', 'viewing', 'one', 'will', 'sit', 'gather', 'dust', 'very', 'quickly']",New Rose Hotel
512385,A2FOYJX7CWI45P,B00001YXCD,Wearing the Crimson Mask,"[5, 5]","I have real mixed feelings about this one.  It's very strong in some aspects and very weak in others.  I still enjoyed the movie (would really give it 3.5 stars though), but at the same, I'm not sure I could recommend it to anyone who's not a fan of William Gibson.First of all, I think the film did a pretty good job of realizing the story.  The characterization, dialogue, plot, themes and tone were pretty well represented for me.  The tricky thing here is that the story is about 15 pages long and takes place entirely in a Tokyo Capsule Hotel, with the protagonist in a state of utter despair and ennui as he starts piecing together what went wrong through a series of flashbacks, all the while knowing that his time left is slipping away.  Granted, that's not really going to flesh out a 90 minute feature, so I was willing to accept the way it's presented.  Sometimes you have to make concessions when a book is filmed, and overall I don't think any of this compromised the integrity.The acting was great, and they had some great dialogue to work with.  Walken and Dafoe are as superb as you'd expect.  One of the film's best strengths is the noiry con-man banter between the two.  Honestly I didn't know much about Asia Argento (I kind of assumed she was Dario's daughter, and cynically thought, ""great, nepotism from a B-movie zombie guy"") but she really held her own with these two heavy-weights, really well for a young lady whose first language is not English.  I didn't need any convincing that she could seduce anyone certainly, and it doesn't hurt that she's half naked a lot of the time.  Not a fan of that tattoo though, too tacky for me.The plot might be a bit inaccessible for some.  In some ways it's very slow, there's not a lot of action, or when there is, we don't necessarily see it.  A Gibson fan would feel right at home with a premise involving the corporate espionage between MAAS and Hosaka.  But for someone walking in cold, it might be a bit hard to grasp the different forces at play.  Even having read the story, some of the indirect action took place on one character's PDA - which was monochrome and small, making me question - who is this, where are they and what's going on?The budget on the movie was obviously not great, but again, I was OK with this aspect in some respects, but turned off by others.  This movie is very low-tech by Gibson's standards, but his appeal for me is not in sci-fi gimmicks, but the social effects of these mechanisms.  That didn't bother me, if anything it helps, because visual tekkie effects usually don't age well.  What did kind of turn me off, the movie takes place in Tokyo, Marakesh and Europe, but each time they changed locales, they'd show just some stock footage video of the city and then dump you in some generic hotel or restaurant.  Sorry but it was not only unconvincing, but detracting since it kept screaming to me ""I am a low budget movie!""Love the story, love the acting, love Asia Argento and her friends, love the tone and dialogue.  But overall it didn't satisfy due to an equal number of detractions.Mixed bag.  I enjoyed it, but when viewed as a total package, I don't know if I could recommend this to many people outside of WG fans.
