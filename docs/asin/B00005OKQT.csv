It is so heart-felt, so honest, so idealistic in a way that is actually humanly possible! It's the kind of idealism that nourishes a child well. So much has changed in the world, but I was glad to be reminded of that soft center that had been cultivated within me in my childhood and which I associated to completely with this music. Everytime I hear it, honest to God and I feel slightly embarassed about this, I kind of always want to cry. Great funk influences, great folk influences, terrific Diana Ross track, a few really funny pieces, and SO RETRO!!!! Honestly, there is alot to make this valuable to so many different people. So many generations. I keep wondering when I'm going to hear some of it sampled in some spaced out electronica.

I grew up with this TV show as a kid in the early 70s, not unlike many others here, and have never forgotten the timeless messages that permeate its presentation.  Free to Be You and Me is for kids of all ages in any generation.  One of my favorites is when Marlo Thomas and Mel Brooks are the voices of the babies, but my absolute favorite, which can't be of much surprise, is the New Seekers singing the title track.  Between this and most anything Sid and Marty Krofft have ever put out, I feel fairly confident that out-of-date to some people means nothing to small children who just love to be entertained and learn valuable lessons.  I love to sit and watch this sort of thing with them, we can have a great time doing it, and we can hope the generation behind us will embrace it and spread the love.

672623,ARU2H2PYTNCAX,B00005OKQT,e_j_buster,"[0, 0]","Don't believe the other reviews saying that there is a positive message in this video.  There is NOT a positive message in this video.  This video is intended to contribute to the destruction of our society by emasculating boys and encouraging girls to wait until later in life to start a family or to possibly not start a family at all.  This video tries to teach girls that it is admirable to choose `exploring the world' before choosing to have a family.I knew that I was in for some serious social engineering when, during the opening song, we see Marlo Thomas pretending to operate a jack-hammer while singing something about how girls can do anything they want, including jobs that most females are not physically capable of doing.  My point here is not chauvinistic.  My point here is that this video is trying to encourage girls to want things that they would not naturally want.I watched this video mainly to see Marlo Thomas.  But we don't see much of her in this video.  Most of the video is filled with animated segments and disturbing puppetry.One of the animated segments is about a boy (William) who wants a doll.  When his father finds out that William wants a doll, he's not too thrilled about the idea.  So he buys William a baseball glove and some other sports equipment.  William grows to love sports and he even excels at sports.  But he still wants a doll.  Finally, his grandmother buys William a doll as a gift.  The moral of the story is that there is nothing wrong with a boy who wants to play with dolls.  In fact, in this video, the outlandish assertion is made that it is actually a positive thing for William to play with dolls.  It is explained at the end of the segment that playing with a doll will help William learn how to take care of a baby when he becomes a father.  I kid you not.  This video seriously states that playing with dolls will help a boy learn how to take care of a baby.  If you don't believe me, watch the video yourself.There is another segment in this video called, ""It's alright to cry.""  This segment encourages boys to cry.  It states that boys who don't cry are sissies.  Great, just what this country needs, a bunch of boys who are crybabies and who love to play with dolls.There are many other disturbing messages in this video.  But this review is already getting pretty long.  So I'll end it now by saying that I am giving this video a five star rating because the attempt at social engineering is so obvious and over-the-top that it is fascinating to behold.  I had to watch it twice to believe what I was seeing.  If you enjoy studying the social engineering that has been going on throughout the years, I highly recommend watching `Free To Be You And Me'.

672628,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005OKQT,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Free To Be You And Me stars Marlo Thomas, Harry Belafonte, Rosey Grier, Michael Jackson, Kris Kristopherson and others who lend their voices to the animated shorts that make up this brief but very sweet message directed at children. Simply put, Free To Be You And Me tells children that they should love their fellow human beings as brothers and sisters; and children learn that they can and should try to achieve their dreams in childhood and especially in adulthood as well.While some scenarios feature the actors going through routines to show that anything is possible (and remember, Marlo Thomas posing as a construction worker was practically radical back in 1974), other scenarios are animated. The animation isn't always the greatest, but it's more than adequate and it helps to impart a meaningful message anyway. For example, in one animated scenario we meet a King's daughter named Atalanta. She doesn't feel so sure that she wants to get married despite the fact that her father the King (the symbol of authority and what society expects for a young woman) wants her to get married right away. When there is a contest to see who can win the right to marry Atalanta, she meets her match in a young man named John from the village. John and Atalanta come in tied for first place; and John is wise enough to know that Atalanta has to want to marry him and that she cannot be forced to marry simply because that's what other people in society expect for a young woman to do.Another wonderful animated scenario concerns a young boy named Dudley Pippin. Dudley is accused by his teacher of spilling paint all over the floor at school. Although Dudley denies it, his teacher doesn't believe him and makes him clean up the mess long after all the other children have gone home. Dudley then goes home--but on his way home he meets the principal who tells Dudley that it's OK to cry about being so misunderstood by his teacher. This animated segment leads straight into the very famous (well, it was very famous at the time) segment in which the ultra-macho football star Rosey Grier sings ""It's All Right To Cry"" while playing the guitar. ""It's All Right To Cry"" is very masterfully done and Rosey doesn't falter one bit.In general, the other segments teach children that it's OK to be in touch with their feelings about friends, siblings and their parents. There's even a segment on the importance of letting a young boy have a doll--so that he can see what it's like to be a father when he grows up to have his own children.Overall, Free To Be You And Me doesn't lack much. The quality of the print could have been cleaned up somewhat; but it's all so good that this is really minor. I highly recommend this film for children to watch; it might also stimulate some meaningful conversation between parents and their children, too.",5,it deserves twenty stars,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,2834,"['Free', 'Be', 'Me', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'Rosey', 'Grier', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Kris', 'Kristopherson', 'others', 'who', 'lend', 'voices', 'animated', 'shorts', 'make', 'up', 'brief', 'very', 'sweet', 'message', 'directed', 'children', 'Simply', 'put', 'Free', 'Be', 'Me', 'children', 'should', 'love', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'children', 'learn', 'can', 'should', 'try', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'childhood', 'especially', 'adulthood', 'well.While', 'scenarios', 'feature', 'actors', 'going', 'routines', 'show', 'anything', 'possible', 'remember', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'posing', 'construction', 'worker', 'was', 'practically', 'radical', 'back', '1974', 'other', 'scenarios', 'are', 'animated', 'animation', ""n't"", 'always', 'greatest', 'more', 'adequate', 'impart', 'meaningful', 'message', 'anyway', 'example', 'one', 'animated', 'scenario', 'meet', 'King', 'daughter', 'named', 'Atalanta', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'sure', 'get', 'married', 'fact', 'father', 'King', 'symbol', 'authority', 'what', 'society', 'young', 'woman', 'get', 'married', 'right', 'away', 'When', 'contest', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'win', 'right', 'marry', 'Atalanta', 'match', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'John', 'village', 'John', 'Atalanta', 'come', 'tied', 'first', 'place', 'John', 'wise', 'enough', 'know', 'Atalanta', 'want', 'marry', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'marry', 'simply', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'society', 'expect', 'young', 'woman', 'do.Another', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'scenario', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Dudley', 'Pippin', 'Dudley', 'accused', 'teacher', 'spilling', 'paint', 'floor', 'school', 'Dudley', 'teacher', ""n't"", 'believe', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'long', 'other', 'children', 'have', 'gone', 'home', 'Dudley', 'then', 'home', 'way', 'home', 'principal', 'who', 'Dudley', 'OK', 'cry', 'being', 'so', 'misunderstood', 'teacher', 'animated', 'segment', 'straight', 'very', 'famous', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'famous', 'time', 'segment', 'ultra-macho', 'football', 'star', 'Rosey', 'Grier', 'All', 'Right', 'Cry', 'playing', 'guitar', 'All', 'Right', 'Cry', 'very', 'masterfully', 'done', 'Rosey', ""n't"", 'falter', 'one', 'bit.In', 'general', 'other', 'segments', 'teach', 'children', 'OK', 'be', 'touch', 'feelings', 'friends', 'siblings', 'parents', 'even', 'segment', 'importance', 'letting', 'young', 'boy', 'have', 'doll', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'be', 'father', 'when', 'up', 'have', 'own', 'children.Overall', 'Free', 'Be', 'Me', ""n't"", 'lack', 'much', 'quality', 'print', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'somewhat', 'so', 'good', 'really', 'minor', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'children', 'watch', 'might', 'also', 'stimulate', 'meaningful', 'conversation', 'parents', 'children', 'too']",N/A

The DVD has versions of songs not on the CD (a young Michael Jackson for example).BUTThe DVD quality is pretty bad.  It looks like someone put a video camera on a tripod and pointed it at the wall showing the old film on a screen (complete with things blocking the view) - I'm serious.  They didn't remaster it or even do a quality transfer.This may be the only version you will see on DVD so holding off may not be wise if you have no other copy.
