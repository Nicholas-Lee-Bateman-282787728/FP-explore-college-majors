I would have liked more one-on-one interviews with Adele herself specific to the documentary. I should have had a clue when the dvd came in and noticed the disclaimer that neither Adele or her management had any involvement with the project - red flag! Lots of snippets from on-air-appearances and bits of her singing songs, some of which I had seen on youtube already, and a few new to me, but over all I wasn't impressed, especially for $14.99. Wish I had spent my $ to buy her live performance at the Royal Albert Hall dvd instead, which I have viewed via YouTube and want to have for my permanent collection. You get to know the REAL Adele in that piece, so much better than this supposed documentary. It's just OK....save your $$ on this one - sure wish I had.",2,Just ok...,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,916,"['dvd', 'had', 'interesting', 'information', 'Adele', 'earlier', 'teen', 'years', 'really', 'more', 'who', 'were', 'around', 'career', 'developed', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'one-on-one', 'interviews', 'Adele', 'specific', 'documentary', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'clue', 'when', 'dvd', 'came', 'noticed', 'disclaimer', 'Adele', 'management', 'had', 'involvement', 'project', 'red', 'flag', 'Lots', 'snippets', 'on-air-appearances', 'bits', 'singing', 'songs', 'had', 'seen', 'youtube', 'already', 'few', 'new', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'especially', '14.99', 'Wish', 'had', 'spent', 'buy', 'live', 'performance', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'dvd', 'instead', 'have', 'viewed', 'YouTube', 'want', 'have', 'permanent', 'collection', 'get', 'know', 'REAL', 'Adele', 'piece', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'supposed', 'documentary', 'just', 'OK', '.save', 'one', 'sure', 'wish', 'had']",Adele - The Only Way Is Up

There were a lot of people talking about Adele, and a little of Adele through the years, talking too.  References to songs might be accompanied by a bar or so of the song, but mainly I wanted to turn this off and watch &#34;Adele live at the Royal Albert&#34;.
