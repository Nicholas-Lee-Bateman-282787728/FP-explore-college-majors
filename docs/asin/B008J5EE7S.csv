I watched it about 25 times because it was soooo fascinating.I have been riding motorcycles since I was 15 years old and NO ONE ever taught me how to do the things that &#34;Motorman&#34; teaches on this video. I feel like I've been a &#34;novice&#34; rider all these decades and, just now, feel like I am a skilled rider.I used these techniques in negotiating the notoriously dangerous Tail of The Dragon which made my treacherous ride so much more enjoyable without killing myself.I highly recommend everyone who wants to not only survive riding but thrive while riding to snag this video and to view it over and over again with all the riding buddies you care about.Way to go &#34;Amazing-zon&#34;!!!~",5,My Riding Improved 1000% By Viewing This DVD.

With my oldest son starting to ride again after a 2 year hiatus, I thought it was time to finally get the DVD.  All I can say is that I wish I had bought it sooner for all of us to view.The video goes over the three skills / techniques riders need to develop in order to bring their riding ability to the next level.  And it does it in an easy to understand method.  The exercises shown are very good, and shown in an order that builds on each other.Although the instruction is very good, I think that some of the video shots could have been a bit better.  There are times where I thought that if the video had been zoomed in a little closer, that it might have been more beneficial for the viewer.",4,"Good video for new riders, or those looking to improve their skills.",1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,783,"['have', 'been', 'considering', 'buying', 'video', 'awhile', 'held', 'off', 'reason', 'oldest', 'son', 'starting', 'ride', 'again', '2', 'year', 'hiatus', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'finally', 'get', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'wish', 'had', 'bought', 'sooner', 'view.The', 'video', 'three', 'skills', '/', 'techniques', 'riders', 'need', 'develop', 'order', 'bring', 'riding', 'ability', 'next', 'level', 'easy', 'understand', 'method', 'exercises', 'shown', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'shown', 'order', 'instruction', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'video', 'shots', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'thought', 'video', 'had', 'been', 'zoomed', 'little', 'closer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'beneficial', 'viewer']",N/A
