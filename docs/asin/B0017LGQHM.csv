I do not know how accurate the storytelling and filming actually are, but it doesn't matter.  This is a nice Mother's Day gift about a smart, brave, beautiful little animal and her huge, colorful family.My only regret is that Sean Astin, the narrator of the original three seasons. did not provide the narration for this last film, dedicated to Flower.  Apparently Whoopie Goldberg is the narrator for the fourth season (the ""Next Generation"" pun inescapable, especially with Whoopi, to Star trek fans).  I would have preferred Sean Astin, but this does nothing to detract from the enjoyment of the film.  Buy it and give it to a favorite mother.",5,For Flower,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,768,"['sweet', 'little', 'film', 'tribute', 'Flower', 'beloved', 'Mama', 'Meerkat', 'who', 'died', 'filming', 'third', 'season', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'storytelling', 'filming', 'actually', 'are', ""n't"", 'matter', 'nice', 'Mother', 'Day', 'gift', 'smart', 'brave', 'beautiful', 'little', 'animal', 'huge', 'colorful', 'family.My', 'only', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'narrator', 'original', 'three', 'seasons', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'narration', 'last', 'film', 'dedicated', 'Flower', 'Apparently', 'Whoopie', 'Goldberg', 'narrator', 'fourth', 'season', 'Next', 'Generation', 'pun', 'inescapable', 'especially', 'Whoopi', 'Star', 'trek', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'nothing', 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'Buy', 'give', 'favorite', 'mother']",Meerkat Manor: The Story Begins
