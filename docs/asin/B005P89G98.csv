I had previously enjoyed the far superior '10 Men Out' and 'Guys And Balls,' but this one tried my patience. It plays like a neverending one-act stage piece shot outdoors, as if moving the action of 'Boys In The Band' from a NY apartment to a small soccer field. The characters bicker and bitch loudly and ferociously for the entire film. Some restraint here and there was, apparently, never a consideration. And, yes, you'll need English Subtitles to understand half of what they're rattling off. I'm afraid drag queen banter runs very thin with me. Though the film tackles issues of self indentity and homophobia, the endles prattle wears thin very quickly. It wore me out after 15 minutes: I had to finish this thing in segments, just to see if it was going anywhere. (It does - eventually.) I wish gay writers would not confuse being witty with being bitchy: the former is a pleasure, the latter a drag - no pun intended. The two stars are for the eye candy, and the young cast's efforts to make this one-gag effort come alive, but the ""script"" looks to have been shot as they went along; characters keep popping up as if only to stretch out the proceedings so as to get a feature length film out of a 30 minute short subject.

(i.e., ""Broken hearts club"" and ""Summer Storm"").  I really derived much pleasure watching the hysterical antics of both teams and listening to the very funny banter between the characters.  Of course there are serious issues to deal with (such as: drug addiction, homophobia, family loyalties, relationship problems, acceptance of what one is, etc.)All of the problems are dealt with in often amusing ways.  As has been previously stated before, ""Kickoff"" has loads of ""heart"".This film is so well directed, filmed and, most of all, acted.  Thanks to the acting, I adored all of the characters even the frustrated wives, girlfriends along with the boyfriend of one of the players that use to be a fierce bully, even the super macho, steroid-crazed star of the straight team.If you want some light entertainment that will make you have some good laughs, buy this film.  I  used the ""subtitles"" because that British accents got a little ""thick"" and the dialog is very funny; you'll want to ""catch"" every line.(I must add that the film became extremly wonderful to me when the gay team became known as a gay team rather then just a good soccer team that was winning the match.

There's an eclectic, ensemble cast of misfit footballers, representing a range of gay stereotypes, trying to come together as a team and to terms with who they are.

1497048,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005P89G98,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[13, 15]","At last a film that does what it says on the box. I pre- ordered this a month before release and was hoping that it would meet half my expectations; it has done more than that.The plot is pretty straightforward, in that a gay 5 a side football (or soccer to our American chums) team wants to enter the Sunday Soccer league, but the `captain' is desperate to keep their gayness hidden. He has left it to his boyfriend to order the kit and he chooses pink (sorry fuscia!). In a fit of anger he tears off the tops of all the team, and things just get sexier from that point.That is not a plot spoiler, as I kinda knew that was the point of the film. But what happens is a story of all of the participants, as they face up to the many demons that face them. We have fag hags, misplaced attraction, and a step dad who just wants to do the right thing. This is not a sex fuelled film, but more a study in relationships, and with a real south London twist.To quote the cover the referee `Elton Glixton struggles to control this testosterone tsunami as rude boys meet bum boys in this outrageous new British comedy.' Whilst there is a lot of humour, there is so much more, and I really got more from this than I was expecting. I intend to watch again and cannot recommend this highly enough.At 98 mins long this is not an epic but considering it is all about a footie match that lasts less than an hour; it is ruddy excellent. This is my favourite Peccadillo (UK) presentation since Summer sturm, and a real one man effort in the shape of Rikki Beadle Blair, who wrote, produced and directed as well as acting in this little gem, you may remeber him from 'Fit', and a few of the cast from this too.
