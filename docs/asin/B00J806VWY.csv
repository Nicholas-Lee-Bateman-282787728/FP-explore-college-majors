My only gripe was at times the subtitles were really hard to understand, which for me makes movies I have to read more taxing. But There is no news when this movie will get a US release so any fan that wants to see this movie as bad as I did this is small and rather trivial problem. The subtitles are not to bad so if you are dying to see this you won't regret getting this copy till the real release hits",3,This movie is anime fan gold,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,513,"['loved', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'awesome', 'see', 'characters', 'brought', 'life', 'such', 'great', 'fun', 'why', 'only', 'gripe', 'was', 'times', 'subtitles', 'were', 'really', 'hard', 'understand', 'movies', 'have', 'read', 'more', 'taxing', 'news', 'when', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'US', 'release', 'so', 'fan', 'see', 'movie', 'as', 'bad', 'did', 'small', 'rather', 'trivial', 'problem', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'so', 'are', 'dying', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'getting', 'copy', 'real', 'release', 'hits']",Gatchaman Live Action Movie Battle of the Planets G-Force Science Ninja Team (Japanese Movie with English Sub - All Region DVD)

1695832,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00J806VWY,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[9, 13]","One of my earliest childhood memories was watching the Americanized version of the Japanese-import cartoon GATCHAMAN, known here in the States as BATTLE OF THE PLANETS. It's a cool premise and a fun show, with five ""fearless young orphans defending the Earth's entire galaxy"" from alien threats. I was obsessed with the show because my very young eyes had never seen anything quite like it. But that was the late 70's. Since then, the show had gone through a really awful Americanization in the early 90's simply called G-FORCE that aired on the Cartoon Network. But back in Japan in the mid-90's, it was being given a much better anime treatment, going back to the original name GATCHAMAN, with the same characters, but with not only superior animation but far better storytelling as well. Still riding on the nostalgia popularity of the show, the Japanese studio Nikkatsu finally released, after years of development hell, a live-action feature film based on the successful cartoon. And while GATCHAMAN delivers a good deal of fan service and some really terrific CG effects, the end result is pretty far from what we'd hoped from years of waiting.The film plays around with the concepts and the origins of the major characters we know and love from the series, and finally deigns to give us an explanation into how the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman got their abilities. There's a maguffin called the G-Element that is used by the members of Gatchaman: Ken (the leader), Joe (the angry 2nd-in-command), Jun (the girl), Ryu (the bruiser), and Jinpei (the kid) all have the G-Element running through their battle suits to give them flight capabilities and superhuman strength. And then there's the leader of the Galactor, the alien race that looks to enslave the world, who they capture and bring to their base at the International Science Organization. He pulls a Joker/Khan/Loki and escapes, but not before a big reveal that has some surprising emotional heft to it. Then we get killer satellites, a floating island fortress, and the appearence of the most awesome tech the show ever created, which is Gatchaman's ship, the Firey Phoenix.The opening of the film is very impressive. To see the team flying around the streets of Tokyo battling the forces of the Galactor, using the iconic moves and weapons they're known for is easily the high-point of the film. There isn't really a moment of that opening that looks any lesser than a big-budget American comic-book film. Several squees from my inner child were let out during those moments. The character development, particularly that of Ken and Joe, is well-handled. However, whatever currency is spent in the first act is almost depleted in an incredibly sluggish second act that, while having a really cool reveal, is such a snooze and really deflates any sense of urgency to the film. The third act of the film is enough to save it from being a total bore, but just enough. If a film like G.I. JOE: RETALIATION knew enough to have a really cool second-act action sequence, it seems like any action filmmaker should know this as an axiom. So, it essentially suffers from the same problem as many of the Toho GODZILLA films; it has a big opening and a pretty cool ending, but there's too much downtime.GATCHAMAN is a fun film that will bring back lots of cool childhood memories particularly in the first act, but after that, it's all pretty much downhill.",3,Science Ninja Team Gatchaman gets the live-action treatment.,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,3410,"['One', 'earliest', 'childhood', 'memories', 'was', 'watching', 'Americanized', 'version', 'Japanese-import', 'cartoon', 'GATCHAMAN', 'known', 'here', 'States', 'BATTLE', 'THE', 'PLANETS', 'cool', 'premise', 'fun', 'show', 'five', 'fearless', 'young', 'orphans', 'defending', 'Earth', 'entire', 'galaxy', 'alien', 'threats', 'was', 'obsessed', 'show', 'very', 'young', 'eyes', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'was', 'late', '70', 'then', 'show', 'had', 'gone', 'really', 'awful', 'Americanization', 'early', '90', 'simply', 'called', 'G-FORCE', 'aired', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'back', 'Japan', 'mid-90', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'much', 'better', 'anime', 'treatment', 'going', 'back', 'original', 'name', 'GATCHAMAN', 'same', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'superior', 'animation', 'far', 'better', 'storytelling', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'riding', 'nostalgia', 'popularity', 'show', 'Japanese', 'studio', 'Nikkatsu', 'finally', 'released', 'years', 'development', 'hell', 'live-action', 'feature', 'film', 'based', 'successful', 'cartoon', 'GATCHAMAN', 'good', 'deal', 'fan', 'service', 'really', 'terrific', 'CG', 'effects', 'end', 'result', 'pretty', 'far', 'what', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'years', 'waiting.The', 'film', 'plays', 'concepts', 'origins', 'major', 'characters', 'know', 'love', 'series', 'finally', 'deigns', 'give', 'explanation', 'how', 'Science', 'Ninja', 'Team', 'Gatchaman', 'got', 'abilities', 'maguffin', 'called', 'G-Element', 'used', 'members', 'Gatchaman', 'Ken', 'leader', 'Joe', 'angry', '2nd-in-command', 'Jun', 'girl', 'Ryu', 'bruiser', 'Jinpei', 'kid', 'have', 'G-Element', 'running', 'battle', 'suits', 'give', 'flight', 'capabilities', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'then', 'leader', 'Galactor', 'alien', 'race', 'enslave', 'world', 'who', 'capture', 'bring', 'base', 'International', 'Science', 'Organization', 'Joker/Khan/Loki', 'escapes', 'not', 'big', 'reveal', 'surprising', 'emotional', 'heft', 'Then', 'get', 'killer', 'satellites', 'floating', 'island', 'fortress', 'appearence', 'most', 'awesome', 'tech', 'show', 'ever', 'created', 'Gatchaman', 'ship', 'Firey', 'Phoenix.The', 'opening', 'film', 'very', 'impressive', 'see', 'team', 'flying', 'streets', 'Tokyo', 'battling', 'forces', 'Galactor', 'using', 'iconic', 'moves', 'weapons', ""'re"", 'known', 'easily', 'high-point', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'moment', 'opening', 'lesser', 'big-budget', 'American', 'comic-book', 'film', 'Several', 'squees', 'inner', 'child', 'were', 'let', 'out', 'moments', 'character', 'development', 'particularly', 'Ken', 'Joe', 'well-handled', 'However', 'whatever', 'currency', 'spent', 'first', 'act', 'almost', 'depleted', 'incredibly', 'sluggish', 'second', 'act', 'having', 'really', 'cool', 'reveal', 'such', 'snooze', 'really', 'sense', 'urgency', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'film', 'enough', 'save', 'being', 'total', 'bore', 'just', 'enough', 'film', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'RETALIATION', 'knew', 'enough', 'have', 'really', 'cool', 'second-act', 'action', 'sequence', 'action', 'filmmaker', 'should', 'know', 'axiom', 'So', 'essentially', 'same', 'problem', 'many', 'Toho', 'GODZILLA', 'films', 'big', 'opening', 'pretty', 'cool', 'ending', 'too', 'much', 'downtime.GATCHAMAN', 'fun', 'film', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'lots', 'cool', 'childhood', 'memories', 'particularly', 'first', 'act', 'pretty', 'much', 'downhill']",Gatchaman Live Action Movie Battle of the Planets G-Force Science Ninja Team (Japanese Movie with English Sub - All Region DVD)

I loved Gatchaman, Gatchaman II, and Gatchaman F(ighter), and see no reason why they had to be chopped, channeled, badly dubbed, and twisted into Americanese in order to make them more accessible to their viewership.  'Battle' went one step lower, by adding totally out of place and extraneous animation (if you can call it that) plus an obligatory 'cute' robot to dumb down the proceedings and explain what's already been quite adequately explained, thank you, and fill up time lost from hacking out scenes of violence and more mature situations that they figured poor little sensitive American kiddies couldn't handle..Therefore, my review is of the live action version of the anime series that I loved.  Considering that 'Jet Man' went down pretty much the same road about twenty years ago, not bad.  The actors weren't painful, and the special effects were decent.  All in all, though, I think I'll just plug in my ancient videotapes and watch the real thing.",3,Not a fan of 'Battle',1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,1071,"['most', 'American', 'fans', 'consider', ""'Battle"", 'Planets', 'G', 'Force', 'monumental', 'waste', 'time', 'loved', 'Gatchaman', 'Gatchaman', 'II', 'Gatchaman', 'F', 'ighter', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'had', 'be', 'chopped', 'channeled', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'twisted', 'Americanese', 'order', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'viewership', 'went', 'one', 'step', 'lower', 'adding', 'totally', 'place', 'extraneous', 'animation', 'can', 'call', 'obligatory', ""'cute"", 'robot', 'dumb', 'down', 'proceedings', 'explain', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'quite', 'adequately', 'explained', 'thank', 'fill', 'up', 'time', 'lost', 'hacking', 'out', 'scenes', 'violence', 'more', 'mature', 'situations', 'figured', 'poor', 'little', 'sensitive', 'American', 'kiddies', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle..Therefore', 'review', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'anime', 'series', 'loved', 'Considering', ""'Jet"", 'Man', 'went', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'road', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'bad', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'painful', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'decent', 'think', ""'ll"", 'just', 'plug', 'ancient', 'videotapes', 'watch', 'real', 'thing']",Gatchaman Live Action Movie Battle of the Planets G-Force Science Ninja Team (Japanese Movie with English Sub - All Region DVD)
1695834,A36E1WMU0OLNB9,B00J806VWY,Kid Kyoto,"[0, 0]","So Battle of the Planets/G-Force/Gatchaman was an old favorite from my childhood.  So I was pretty pumped to hear about a live action version and snapped up a copy of the Malaysian version with English subtitles.And yeah it was a nice try, but it was a major disappointment.The FX are very cheap, other than the first battle there's nothing here you won't see in a Power Rangers episode and even that first battle has some major problems.  The Gatchaman team bounce from building to building like parkour traceurs on speed, but the animators just aren't up to the job, the figures shift sizes in impossible ways that destroy suspension of disbelief.After that initial battle the movie grinds to a halt with the team lounging around in ugly jumpsuits and having endless flashbacks until we get to the climax.  For some odd reason the producers thought that what we really want in a Gatchaman movie is an indepth exportation of the characters, their motivations and doubts, rather than say, Science Ninjas kick butt.  But I suppose it's a way to keep the effects budget down.Then we get to the final battle but even that's nothing we've not seen a thousand times before with karate fights among cheap sets.Dr Nambu gets some special praise, he looks like he just got off the bus from 1970 and is most authentic looking character in the film.The subtitles are good for a laugh or two, done by someone with an arms-length relationship with the English language.  The character Joe for example is called Joe in Japanese, his name even pops up in some English text.  But it's translated throughout as George.But honestly even a better translation wouldn't make this mediocre adaptation worth watching.I'd recommend picking up the original anime and giving this a miss.",2,For nostalgia purposes only,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,1762,"['So', 'Battle', 'Planets/G-Force/Gatchaman', 'was', 'old', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'was', 'pretty', 'pumped', 'hear', 'live', 'action', 'version', 'snapped', 'up', 'copy', 'Malaysian', 'version', 'English', 'subtitles.And', 'yeah', 'was', 'nice', 'try', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment.The', 'FX', 'are', 'very', 'cheap', 'other', 'first', 'battle', 'nothing', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'episode', 'even', 'first', 'battle', 'major', 'problems', 'Gatchaman', 'team', 'bounce', 'building', 'building', 'parkour', 'traceurs', 'speed', 'animators', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'job', 'figures', 'shift', 'sizes', 'impossible', 'ways', 'destroy', 'suspension', 'disbelief.After', 'initial', 'battle', 'movie', 'halt', 'team', 'lounging', 'around', 'ugly', 'jumpsuits', 'having', 'endless', 'flashbacks', 'get', 'climax', 'odd', 'reason', 'producers', 'thought', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'Gatchaman', 'movie', 'indepth', 'exportation', 'characters', 'motivations', 'doubts', 'rather', 'say', 'Science', 'Ninjas', 'kick', 'butt', 'suppose', 'way', 'keep', 'effects', 'budget', 'down.Then', 'get', 'final', 'battle', 'even', 'nothing', ""'ve"", 'not', 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'karate', 'fights', 'cheap', 'sets.Dr', 'Nambu', 'special', 'praise', 'just', 'got', 'off', 'bus', '1970', 'most', 'authentic', 'looking', 'character', 'film.The', 'subtitles', 'are', 'good', 'laugh', 'two', 'done', 'someone', 'arms-length', 'relationship', 'English', 'language', 'character', 'Joe', 'example', 'called', 'Joe', 'Japanese', 'name', 'even', 'up', 'English', 'text', 'translated', 'George.But', 'honestly', 'even', 'better', 'translation', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'mediocre', 'adaptation', 'watching.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'original', 'anime', 'giving', 'miss']",Gatchaman Live Action Movie Battle of the Planets G-Force Science Ninja Team (Japanese Movie with English Sub - All Region DVD)

I agree with the previous reviewer it is a good movie despite many harsh reviews. I must say that I am a little bias because I used to watch the anime as a child casually as it was well before my time. The original Battle if the Planets movie is a classic piece of anime. This movie starts out with great action then hits a long lull with character development then finishes strong. The dialogue at some times seemed very silly and so did the special effects which bothered me a little but how realistic can you look in bird costumes? I could compare this to other Anime inspired live action movies ""Casshern"" which seems overly long and literally beats a sad desperation into its viewers with violent and poignant scenes. I would also compare it to ""Goemon"" which is a masterpiece in cinematic and directorial cinema and is strong in plot, character, and special effects, but is not directly inspired by any anime but anime movies themselves. The last movie I would compare it to is Space Battleship Yamato which is very different from the original anime but still an excellent movie. The Gatchaman movie is a lighter movie than Goemon, Casshern, or Space Battleship Yamato. This Gatchaman movie does not receive as high marks for me as Goemon or Space Battleship Yamato which were both 5 star movies. However, it does fit with being at least a 4 star movie like the live action Casshern which follows its anime roots in similar fashion. I would recommend this movie to fans of the original anime but warn you may be slightly disappointed. I am bias towards liking this movie for nostalgia reasons. The original anime and movie were very good but Gatchaman crowds is a pile of rubbish. The plot of this movie does vary considerably from the original if I remember the original correctly, it has been a while. I would recommend this movie to both fans and non fans alike because it is a decent movie and because I realize that unfortunately this movie has recieved a lukewarm reception by westerners. I would say overall this is a very enjoyable movie.",4,Decent Movie if you are a Gatchaman Fan!,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,2164,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'English', 'language', 'version', 'watched', 'Japanese', 'review', 'may', 'not', 'be', '100', '%', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'good', 'movie', 'many', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'little', 'bias', 'used', 'watch', 'anime', 'child', 'casually', 'was', 'well', 'time', 'original', 'Battle', 'Planets', 'movie', 'classic', 'piece', 'anime', 'movie', 'out', 'great', 'action', 'then', 'long', 'lull', 'character', 'development', 'then', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'times', 'seemed', 'very', 'silly', 'so', 'did', 'special', 'effects', 'bothered', 'little', 'how', 'realistic', 'can', 'look', 'bird', 'costumes', 'could', 'compare', 'other', 'Anime', 'inspired', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'Casshern', 'overly', 'long', 'literally', 'sad', 'desperation', 'viewers', 'violent', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'would', 'also', 'compare', 'Goemon', 'masterpiece', 'cinematic', 'directorial', 'cinema', 'strong', 'plot', 'character', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'directly', 'inspired', 'anime', 'anime', 'movies', 'last', 'movie', 'would', 'compare', 'Space', 'Battleship', 'Yamato', 'very', 'different', 'original', 'anime', 'still', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Gatchaman', 'movie', 'lighter', 'movie', 'Goemon', 'Casshern', 'Space', 'Battleship', 'Yamato', 'Gatchaman', 'movie', 'not', 'receive', 'high', 'marks', 'Goemon', 'Space', 'Battleship', 'Yamato', 'were', '5', 'star', 'movies', 'However', 'fit', 'being', 'least', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'live', 'action', 'Casshern', 'anime', 'roots', 'similar', 'fashion', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'original', 'anime', 'warn', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'am', 'bias', 'towards', 'liking', 'movie', 'nostalgia', 'reasons', 'original', 'anime', 'movie', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Gatchaman', 'pile', 'rubbish', 'plot', 'movie', 'vary', 'considerably', 'original', 'remember', 'original', 'correctly', 'been', 'while', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'fans', 'non', 'fans', 'alike', 'decent', 'movie', 'realize', 'unfortunately', 'movie', 'recieved', 'lukewarm', 'reception', 'westerners', 'would', 'say', 'overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",Gatchaman Live Action Movie Battle of the Planets G-Force Science Ninja Team (Japanese Movie with English Sub - All Region DVD)
