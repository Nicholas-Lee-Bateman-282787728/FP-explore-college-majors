I admit that I stopped watching JAG at the end of the first season, but through a good friend of mine, I started watching season 2. The almost mystical relationship that develops between Harm and Mac is difficult to understand at first, but for those that watched the future episodes for the series, it laid it's ground rules in season 2. I think that all of us would agree that the chemistry between Harm and Mac is something that we all wish for, but we hope that it doesn't take 10 years to figure it all out. I have to say thank you to the makers of this DVD set. We the fans of JAG have waited a long time for these to become available to us, and I'm sure we all hope the the remaining seasons are soon to follow on DVD.

The writing is fantastic and really well thought out. I love dramas that have to do with the military and this series does not disappoint. All of the actors, at some point, get a chance to shine.

While the second season apparently didn't run the number of episodes that I would consider a full season and I would have liked a little more explanation in the commentaries about why, everything about the DVD set will make it one of my favorites (until seasons 3 through 10 -- or were there 11 seasons -- come out).  If you aren't familiar with the plotline, Don Belisario and crew do a great job of bringing you up to date.  Get it with season one, since Kate re-appears from time to time and it would be nice to put her in context as Harm's original partner (although the pairing was short-lived).

1011307,A3LYLMNCN0JPQH,B000H7JCJQ,J. Woodward,"[1, 1]","I am a huge fan of JAG and watched all ten seasons as they aired. Like most good tv series, what made it work so well for me was the chemistry of the cast. One can easily accept the dramatic licence used to constantly place the main characters into implausible and dangerous situations ala Captain James T. Kirk. Ultimately, JAG is about the relationship between Harm & Mac (partners, friends, romantics) which was exploited superbly over the show's 10 season run. Despite my concerns over the technical quality of the discs which I'll try to express below, these DVD sets are a must for true fans of the show.My only disappointment is the quality of the video which raises some questions I simply can't answer. Having gone to HD a few years back, I was able to watch the final seasons in 16x9 widescreen and hi-definition on a 100"" screen. It was absolutely awesome. The JAG DVD's are in 4x3 aspect ratio with lots of motion artifacts. By way of comparison, Belisario's NCIS DVD's seem to have a much superior image quality. At first, I assumed this is due to technology advancements in the cameras used to shoot the episides and later seasons of JAG will look equally as good.I have seen episodes of ""The Equalizer"" and ""Law & Order"" from the same or earlier time frame rebroadcast on HD channels. While not as good as the images on current over the air HD broadcasts, they appear to at least be shot in widescreen and ""upconverted."" I haven't seen dvd's of these shows as a comparison, but now wonder whether the early JAG seasons could at least be presented in 16x9. DVD's are scanned at 480i. Nevertheless, newer DVD players such as what I am utilizing seem to be able to get exceptional results upconverting. For some reason, the early JAG DVD's don't match up very well. Whether this is an issue with the telecine process or a comparison of apples to oranges, I simply can't say.",4,focusing primarily on the video transfer to dvd,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1886,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'JAG', 'watched', 'ten', 'seasons', 'aired', 'most', 'good', 'tv', 'series', 'what', 'made', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'accept', 'dramatic', 'licence', 'used', 'constantly', 'place', 'main', 'characters', 'implausible', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'ala', 'Captain', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'Ultimately', 'JAG', 'relationship', 'Harm', 'Mac', 'partners', 'friends', 'romantics', 'was', 'exploited', 'superbly', 'show', '10', 'season', 'run', 'concerns', 'technical', 'quality', 'discs', ""'ll"", 'try', 'express', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'must', 'true', 'fans', 'show.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'quality', 'video', 'questions', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'Having', 'gone', 'HD', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'final', 'seasons', '16x9', 'widescreen', 'hi-definition', '100', 'screen', 'was', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'JAG', 'DVD', 'are', '4x3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'lots', 'motion', 'artifacts', 'way', 'comparison', 'Belisario', 'NCIS', 'DVD', 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'superior', 'image', 'quality', 'first', 'assumed', 'due', 'technology', 'advancements', 'cameras', 'used', 'shoot', 'episides', 'later', 'seasons', 'JAG', 'will', 'look', 'equally', 'good.I', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'Equalizer', 'Law', 'Order', 'same', 'earlier', 'time', 'frame', 'rebroadcast', 'HD', 'channels', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'images', 'current', 'air', 'HD', 'broadcasts', 'appear', 'least', 'be', 'shot', 'widescreen', 'upconverted', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'dvd', 'shows', 'comparison', 'now', 'wonder', 'early', 'JAG', 'seasons', 'could', 'least', 'be', 'presented', '16x9', 'DVD', 'are', 'scanned', '480i', 'Nevertheless', 'newer', 'DVD', 'players', 'such', 'what', 'am', 'utilizing', 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'exceptional', 'results', 'upconverting', 'reason', 'early', 'JAG', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'issue', 'telecine', 'process', 'comparison', 'apples', 'oranges', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say']",JAG

This series had lots of action, drama, some light comedy spots here and there and the development of the characters and the interplay made this a highly entertaining, especially between the admiral and his 2 star judge advocates. My husband and I watched this series from the beginning Season 1 which aired on NBC. The network opted not to renew JAG and so it switched to CBS after a short absence where it aired from season 2 to the end. I'm sure the NBC executives regret that decision! This was the series which would ultimately create another winning series spin-off,  NCIS which just completed it's 7 season and which now airs in JAGS old Tuesday night time slot also on CBS. This series gave the average viewer an inside look to some of the goings on in our military and the politics of the time. It also very tastefully worked into the story line the tragedy of the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and our ongoing fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Al Queda. The series was very entertaining and had nice top notch acting, writing and directing.

Top notch acting and original plots keep the fascination high throughout the show. But what makes JAG exceptional is the interaction between Rab(David James Elliott) and Sarah MacKenzie(Catherine Bell). The suspense of waiting for the next lapse in their purely professional behavior toward each other is  what makes the show so spectacular.

It had its moments, but for the most part i thought it was one of the most poorly written shows on TV.but there are a lot of things i liked about this show. they had some of the best actors on TV. (including from season one) the cimenatography was one of the best on TV. it always had a movie feel to it. the music is incredibly memorable. it had one of the greatest music themes in TV history.they got the technical aspects right. down to the uniform code and the lingo both military and legal.but what i never liked about the show was it was incredibly cliched. the storylines throughout the series were quite hard and even improbable to believe. except for harm and mac the characters never really grew and they constantly contradicted themselves in discussing their own histories. they had great actors but hardly no real scripts to match it. it is not that i find the characters hard to believe in. it just that they were on there so long that i just got used to them and how they were acting. i never really cared for them except for a few moments during the course of the series.But i did believe in Harm and Mac. i understood and got the chemistry between the two. they were a team definetly - i bought it. it was like watching a good pitcher and catcher during a game. they will probably go down in history as one of the great partnerings in television.  but that is as far as it went. they had good chemistry. but not much else.the series itself as a whole could have done much better. the potiential was there. but like i said, it was an incrediably cliched show that pandered to the 45 and up audience that presented itself as an in your face die-hard yeah military - i'm not going to rock the boat - show. it never ventured from that premise. it never told the same tired stories that they did from a different perspective. no real depth ever attempted, they will never be confused with Law & Order or MASH which are the best Miliatary and legal shows on tv. but i realized that was never the producers point.  so inspite of my criticisms. i still enjoyed the show. and the reason for me, at least, is simple. CATHERIME BELL!from the time Catherine Bell was introduced it became - slowly but surely - her show. i think i'm not alone in that.  she is what made the show fun and worth coming back too. week after week. David James Elliot did a good job. but you can only do so much with that character. and that was exhausted really after the third season. Sarah Mackenzie was the same way. she really was just a female version of Harm. but that is what made Catherime so great. she brought herself to the role. her personality was in all over Mac. she is a woman that does not take herself too seriously and that is what she made mac become. that was really the only difference between Harm and Mac. one did not take themself too seriously. the other did very much. Catherine and Mac had a genuine sense of humor, i never got that from DJE and Harm. it was like he tried to hard to show he had one.when DJE threatened to quit the show. i think it would have been a safe bet that the show would have survived nicely without him. as a matter of fact i think that was what there intentions were. to make the show about sarah. i think it would have been a little better even. but if CB had left. i don't know if it could have lasted too much longer.but all that being said. i like the Second Season. i will reccommend it. i don't have the first season. i don't want it. to me Catherine Bell was the star of the show. the reason to watch it and the reason to own this DVD and the rest the show that is sure to come.",4,"Catherine Bell's introduction, it was her series from that point on.",1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,3673,"['i', 'bought', 'DVD', 'not', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'had', 'moments', 'most', 'part', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'poorly', 'written', 'TV.but', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'i', 'liked', 'show', 'had', 'best', 'actors', 'TV', 'including', 'season', 'one', 'cimenatography', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'always', 'had', 'movie', 'feel', 'music', 'incredibly', 'memorable', 'had', 'one', 'greatest', 'music', 'themes', 'TV', 'history.they', 'got', 'technical', 'aspects', 'right', 'down', 'uniform', 'code', 'lingo', 'military', 'legal.but', 'what', 'i', 'never', 'liked', 'show', 'was', 'was', 'incredibly', 'cliched', 'storylines', 'series', 'were', 'quite', 'hard', 'even', 'improbable', 'believe', 'harm', 'mac', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'grew', 'constantly', 'contradicted', 'discussing', 'own', 'histories', 'had', 'great', 'actors', 'hardly', 'real', 'scripts', 'match', 'not', 'i', 'find', 'characters', 'hard', 'believe', 'just', 'were', 'so', 'long', 'i', 'just', 'got', 'used', 'how', 'were', 'acting', 'i', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'few', 'moments', 'course', 'series.But', 'i', 'did', 'believe', 'Harm', 'Mac', 'i', 'understood', 'got', 'chemistry', 'two', 'were', 'team', 'definetly', 'i', 'bought', 'was', 'watching', 'good', 'pitcher', 'catcher', 'game', 'will', 'probably', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'one', 'great', 'partnerings', 'television', 'as', 'far', 'went', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'not', 'much', 'else.the', 'series', 'whole', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'potiential', 'was', 'there', 'i', 'said', 'was', 'incrediably', 'cliched', 'show', 'pandered', '45', 'up', 'audience', 'presented', 'face', 'die-hard', 'yeah', 'military', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'rock', 'boat', 'show', 'never', 'ventured', 'premise', 'never', 'told', 'same', 'tired', 'stories', 'did', 'different', 'perspective', 'real', 'depth', 'ever', 'attempted', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'confused', 'Law', 'Order', 'MASH', 'are', 'best', 'Miliatary', 'legal', 'shows', 'tv', 'i', 'realized', 'was', 'never', 'producers', 'point', 'inspite', 'criticisms', 'i', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'reason', 'least', 'simple', 'CATHERIME', 'BELL', 'time', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'was', 'introduced', 'became', 'slowly', 'surely', 'show', 'i', 'think', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'fun', 'worth', 'coming', 'back', 'too', 'week', 'week', 'David', 'James', 'Elliot', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'was', 'exhausted', 'really', 'third', 'season', 'Sarah', 'Mackenzie', 'was', 'same', 'way', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'female', 'version', 'Harm', 'what', 'made', 'Catherime', 'so', 'great', 'brought', 'role', 'personality', 'was', 'Mac', 'woman', 'not', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'what', 'made', 'mac', 'become', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'difference', 'Harm', 'Mac', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'themself', 'too', 'seriously', 'other', 'did', 'very', 'much', 'Catherine', 'Mac', 'had', 'genuine', 'sense', 'humor', 'i', 'never', 'got', 'DJE', 'Harm', 'was', 'tried', 'hard', 'show', 'had', 'one.when', 'DJE', 'threatened', 'quit', 'show', 'i', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'safe', 'bet', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'nicely', 'matter', 'fact', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'what', 'intentions', 'were', 'make', 'show', 'sarah', 'i', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'even', 'CB', 'had', 'left', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'too', 'much', 'longer.but', 'being', 'said', 'i', 'Second', 'Season', 'i', 'will', 'reccommend', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'first', 'season', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'reason', 'watch', 'reason', 'own', 'DVD', 'rest', 'show', 'sure', 'come']",JAG
