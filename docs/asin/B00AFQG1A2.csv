1610443,AWKRTLXGSNRES,B00AFQG1A2,"Donald C. Hagy ""DHagy &#34;movie goer&#34;""","[2, 7]","Really, I am amazed the other two reviewers gave this ""Amateur-Night-at-the-Bijou"" release four stars.  I'm all for indie movies; most are not good--every now and then you will find a diamond in the rough.  Such is not the case here.The movie begins with the kidnapping of a young girl from a campsite--in plain view of the many other campers she was with.  Does anyone notice?  Nope.  She is drug through the woods, hoisted onto a boat, shoved in a lower-deck compartment...and then we flash-forward 10 years.  We are now with a counselor of some sort and umpteen juvenile girls who are all getting ready to go on an overnight(s) outing in the wilderness as some sort of ""bonding"" experience/juvenile service--kinda' like a ""Scared Straight on Water.""  As they meander down the river in Idaho, all seems fine...and then weird couple from hell shows up.  The movie then falls into all sorts of bad cliches:  boat trouble, adult instructor leaves (by herself, of course) to take the boat in for service AFTER her group has had a run-in with a couple who obviously failed in their audition for ""Deliverance,"" and a boatless group of teenage girls are left to fend off the killers by themselves.""  YAWN.I have stated many times before that I am well aware that in MOST movies of this type you are supposed to throw caution to the wind when it comes to plot and/or anything actually making sense.  But this script (or the lack thereof) had so many holes in it, it appeared as though you were looking through Swiss cheese.  NOTHING made any sense:  why was the first abducted girl NEVER investigated?  Why did she choose to live with country Joe and never try to escape?  What was their back story?  This film never explained anything about anybody.  You just had the victims and their predators, and they seemed to be the only people on this river for days on end.  What I found even more amazing were  there were several scenes in which cars traveling down the highway were in plain view, but yet these girls could not find any help.A bad movie and a complete waste of time.

1610444,A8NAERR5LGFI3,B00AFQG1A2,iluv2befit,"[2, 2]","This movie was very realistic. For that reason, I had a hard time watching it in several scenes. I thought the teenage girls did a fantastic job in this movie- they made it seem that much more real. There is a lot of suspense in this movie and you see things play out that you just don't want to think is going to happen but sadly does. I thought the killer did a great job in the movie too- you would have really thought this guy was a nut with the really good acting. I literally had to keep telling me myself it was just a movie and had to fast forward some parts because it was too real and hard to watch. I didn't know what to expect when I got this at redbox but it was excellent. The back premise to it is pretty cool too which makes it that much more real.

1610446,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00AFQG1A2,Michael Butts,"[1, 4]","THE MOORING has a fairly simplistic plot-----looney psycho and his subservient female sidekick chase a bevy of young girls through a forest, then offing them one by one.  No reason for these killings is ever explained.The real problem with THE MOORING is its lethargic pacing and its lightweight script.  The girls are inter-changeable with little distinctive traits.

1610447,A387BD735MI50R,B00AFQG1A2,R. Schultz,"[14, 14]","&#8220;The Mooring&#8221; is more affecting than the usual crazed-stalker-in-the-woods film. It cares enough to lend some plausibility to the girls&#8217; predicament. A group of young women are sent out on a milder &#8220;Outward Bound&#8221; sort of excursion away from their accustomed urban comforts. All of them have been compulsive over-users of cell phone and Internet technology, sometimes with serious consequences. So there&#8217;s a reason for their being set down in the woods without a working cell phone among them.Then the conversation here is much more realistic than the usual film-version of conversation among teens before they start getting picked off by backwoods psychopaths. While the two-hour limitations of the film doesn&#8217;t allow us to get to know all nine girls very well, we do get a glimpse of some of their distinctive personalities. What&#8217;s most refreshing is that these girls&#8217; conversation isn&#8217;t limited to foul-mouthed belligerence towards each other. If fact, there&#8217;s no such road rage high volume verbal abuse at all, even when one or the other of them displays some very irritating quirks. The others tend to indulge their comrades&#8217; idiosyncrasies, and to even be polite about them. A real film rarity!This group leader-counselor is also a more believable, interesting person than we usually encounter in any scary movie. She has a low-key, quiet manner that, on top of her delicate adult beauty, draws the viewer into her circle.But overall, there isn&#8217;t a lot of dialogue in this movie. The long, waiting silences add to the tension.However, it&#8217;s the film&#8217;s ending that most distinguishes it. Perhaps you can&#8217;t quite term the ending a twist, but it carries the full-blown surprise of forgotten elements &#8211; suddenly recalled. You won&#8217;t feel the shock of this surprise until the very last line of the film though. So wait for it&#8230; wait for it&#8230;",4,Touching Realism and Some Real Tension,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1958,"['8220', 'Mooring', '8221', 'more', 'affecting', 'usual', 'crazed-stalker-in-the-woods', 'film', 'enough', 'lend', 'plausibility', 'girls', '8217', 'predicament', 'group', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'sent', 'out', 'milder', '8220', 'Outward', 'Bound', '8221', 'sort', 'excursion', 'away', 'accustomed', 'urban', 'comforts', 'have', 'been', 'compulsive', 'over-users', 'cell', 'phone', 'Internet', 'technology', 'sometimes', 'serious', 'consequences', '8217', 's', 'reason', 'being', 'set', 'down', 'woods', 'working', 'cell', 'phone', 'conversation', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'usual', 'film-version', 'conversation', 'teens', 'start', 'getting', 'picked', 'off', 'backwoods', 'psychopaths', 'two-hour', 'limitations', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'allow', 'get', 'know', 'nine', 'girls', 'very', 'well', 'do', 'get', 'glimpse', 'distinctive', 'personalities', 'What', '8217', 'most', 'refreshing', 'girls', '8217', 'conversation', 'isn', '8217', 'limited', 'foul-mouthed', 'belligerence', 'towards', 'other', 'fact', '8217', 'such', 'road', 'rage', 'high', 'volume', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'other', 'very', 'irritating', 'quirks', 'others', 'tend', 'indulge', 'comrades', '8217', 'idiosyncrasies', 'even', 'be', 'polite', 'real', 'film', 'rarity', 'group', 'leader-counselor', 'also', 'more', 'believable', 'interesting', 'person', 'usually', 'encounter', 'scary', 'movie', 'low-key', 'quiet', 'manner', 'top', 'delicate', 'adult', 'beauty', 'viewer', 'circle.But', 'overall', 'isn', '8217', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'long', 'waiting', 'silences', 'add', 'tension.However', '8217', 's', 'film', '8217', 'ending', 'most', 'distinguishes', 'Perhaps', 'can', '8217', 'quite', 'term', 'ending', 'twist', 'full-blown', 'surprise', 'forgotten', 'elements', '8211', 'suddenly', 'recalled', 'won', '8217', 'feel', 'shock', 'surprise', 'very', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'So', 'wait', '8230', 'wait', '8230']",The Mooring
1610448,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00AFQG1A2,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 3]","The Mooring comes across as two separate films. The first half consists of a group of giggly young girls going camping/boating. They are all in trouble due to their addiction to the electronic media: i.e shyness, accident while texting, cyber bullying, writing Amazon reviews etc. They give up the gizmo world and are assigned tasks like ""write a hand written letter"" or play a board game...things they have difficult doing. I really liked this aspect of the movie as the effect the electronic media has had on society still lacks data points.This was a way to build character and to eliminate cell phones before it digresses into a bad abduction story with a guy who plays violent video games and has trouble relating to people.The main problem I had was there were too many girls to get to know. It was difficult to establish all those characters. The second problem I had was that the first half of the picture was pretty darn decent as a separate film. I resented the second half as it didn't meet with my formulaic expectations: The girls learn skills and then bond and combine their skills to ""Rambo"" their foe. Instead the second half was a second rate human prey film.For several of the actresses, this was their first film, apparently college drama students. They did a first rate job, perhaps having lived the early roles that they played. Having said that, if you expect a horror film, expect one with more screams then horror. There is really no suspense or terror factor. Might work as a fright film for young teen girls.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",3,HOW DO YOU MOVE THE HORSE?,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,1577,"['Mooring', 'across', 'two', 'separate', 'films', 'first', 'half', 'group', 'giggly', 'young', 'girls', 'going', 'camping/boating', 'are', 'trouble', 'due', 'addiction', 'electronic', 'media', 'i.e', 'shyness', 'accident', 'texting', 'cyber', 'bullying', 'writing', 'Amazon', 'etc', 'give', 'up', 'gizmo', 'world', 'are', 'assigned', 'tasks', 'write', 'hand', 'written', 'letter', 'play', 'board', 'game', 'things', 'have', 'difficult', 'doing', 'really', 'liked', 'aspect', 'movie', 'effect', 'electronic', 'media', 'had', 'society', 'still', 'data', 'points.This', 'was', 'way', 'build', 'character', 'eliminate', 'cell', 'phones', 'bad', 'abduction', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'violent', 'video', 'games', 'trouble', 'relating', 'people.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'girls', 'get', 'know', 'was', 'difficult', 'establish', 'characters', 'second', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'first', 'half', 'picture', 'was', 'pretty', 'darn', 'decent', 'separate', 'film', 'resented', 'second', 'half', 'did', ""n't"", 'meet', 'formulaic', 'expectations', 'girls', 'learn', 'skills', 'then', 'bond', 'combine', 'skills', 'Rambo', 'foe', 'Instead', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'second', 'rate', 'human', 'prey', 'film.For', 'several', 'actresses', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'apparently', 'college', 'drama', 'students', 'did', 'first', 'rate', 'job', 'perhaps', 'having', 'lived', 'early', 'roles', 'played', 'Having', 'said', 'expect', 'horror', 'film', 'expect', 'one', 'more', 'screams', 'then', 'horror', 'really', 'suspense', 'terror', 'factor', 'Might', 'work', 'fright', 'film', 'young', 'teen', 'girls.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",The Mooring
