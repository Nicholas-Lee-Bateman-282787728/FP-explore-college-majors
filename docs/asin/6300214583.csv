Reynolds,"[19, 19]","Peter Weller was superb as the low-life riff-raff boyfriend in this film, from the first hung-over moment he appears on the screen to his nonchalant comment, after the kids later catch him and the mom with cocaine, &quot;Life goes on.&quot;  Living in apartment complexes during the first half of the 1980s, I saw this same guy again and again, preying temporarily on single women, leeching off them for awhile, leaving their lives in varying degrees of shambles and abruptly moving on.

213816,AOSF1U99TAISB,6300214583,maze,"[8, 8]","I was a teenager at the time of this movie's release.  I can relate in alot of ways with this movie and expereinced similar issues as Collet and Haim did during the film.  Not so much the deadbeat boyfriend part, but the fact that the kids take a back seat when the divorcee parent finds a new partner.  The saying ""when a couple gets a divorce and the children are the one's that suffer"" - this statement is more than accurate.  My mother's boyfriend was a decent guy and he wasn't really the problem, it was the fact that my brother and I at such young ages were kind of left behind, no more guidance or caring of what we did.  Our mother's attention was all towards her new life and her new partner.  Sure we still had a roof over our head and we were greatful.  But as young teenagers still naive and confused about life, we needed alot more attention, caring and guidance, which was no longer there.  So this movie portrays exactly what happens when parents do not work their problems out for their children.  Most of the time parents get divorces fore selfish reasons, like they want more out of their own life.  But if you have any true love for your children you should work it out or prioritize their needs.  At least until they are grown enough to fend for themselves out in the world.  This is one of my very favorite movies from the 80's, a must have.  Also, whats takin so long for the DVD!!",5,This hits the mark with divorced parents...,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1404,"['was', 'teenager', 'time', 'movie', 'release', 'can', 'relate', 'alot', 'ways', 'movie', 'expereinced', 'similar', 'issues', 'Collet', 'Haim', 'did', 'film', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'deadbeat', 'boyfriend', 'part', 'fact', 'kids', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'when', 'divorcee', 'parent', 'new', 'partner', 'saying', 'when', 'couple', 'divorce', 'children', 'are', 'one', 'suffer', 'statement', 'more', 'accurate', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'decent', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'problem', 'was', 'fact', 'brother', 'such', 'young', 'ages', 'were', 'kind', 'left', 'behind', 'more', 'guidance', 'caring', 'what', 'did', 'mother', 'attention', 'was', 'towards', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'partner', 'Sure', 'still', 'had', 'roof', 'head', 'were', 'greatful', 'young', 'teenagers', 'still', 'naive', 'confused', 'life', 'needed', 'alot', 'more', 'attention', 'caring', 'guidance', 'was', 'longer', 'there', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'when', 'parents', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'problems', 'out', 'children', 'Most', 'time', 'parents', 'get', 'divorces', 'fore', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'want', 'more', 'own', 'life', 'have', 'true', 'love', 'children', 'should', 'work', 'out', 'prioritize', 'needs', 'least', 'are', 'grown', 'enough', 'fend', 'out', 'world', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'movies', '80', 'must', 'have', 'Also', 'whats', 'takin', 'so', 'long', 'DVD']",First Born VHS
