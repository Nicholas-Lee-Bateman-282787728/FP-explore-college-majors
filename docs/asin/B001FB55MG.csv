1190907,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001FB55MG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","In recent years I've become rather cold to anything dealing with Adam Sandler.  I find his newfound humor to be unfunny.  Maybe he hasn't really changed a whole lot; maybe my reaction to his films has something to do with my personal tastes changing as I get older, but pretty much everything he's touched since '50 First Dates' has proved itself meandering and irritating to me.Needless to say, I had no interest in seeing this film.My best friend and his wife had rented this for their kids, and they invited my wife and I to come over with our daughter and watch it.  Beings that I pride myself on being easy going I didn't insist on a different film, I just came over with the family and braced myself for a `bad' movie.I was pleasantly surprised.`Bedtime Stories' has its fair share of faults and it suffers in ways from the usual `kiddy film' clich&eacute;s, but it manages to keep you interested and entertained throughout the films entirety, which is something I did not expect.  Also, with it being a children's film, Sandler's usual flair for the unnecessarily offensive is toned down so that he actually comes off as funny as apposed to moronic.  He truly is the most impressive thing about the film, mostly because I expected him to be a befuddled mess.  He kept himself in line and managed to bring a spark of sincerity to his character, giving the films overall moral a boost from his surprisingly charming performance.Aside from Sandler, the film is littered with serviceable performances, some of them excelling more than others.  Keri Russell is charming and beautiful as ever and is the perfect complement to Sandler here.  Guy Pearce is not an actor that I have been overly fond of, and this is not his best work, so that's all I have to say.  He plays a very clich&eacute;d `villain' but he doesn't really make it his own.  Russell Brand is hilarious and serves as genuinely memorable comedic relief here.  Teresa Palmer is extremely good looking, and that's all she needed to be, so she works.  Richard Griffiths is pretty much a throwaway here, but he does fine.Courtney Cox needs more work.So, in the end, this charming little film about a lonely man whose bedtime stories start to come true is fun for the whole family and well worth giving a try.",4,Sandler surprises in this charming little children's film...,1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,2271,"['recent', 'years', ""'ve"", 'become', 'rather', 'cold', 'anything', 'dealing', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'find', 'newfound', 'humor', 'be', 'unfunny', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'really', 'changed', 'whole', 'lot', 'maybe', 'reaction', 'films', 'something', 'do', 'personal', 'tastes', 'changing', 'get', 'older', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'touched', ""'50"", 'First', 'Dates', 'proved', 'meandering', 'irritating', 'me.Needless', 'say', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'film.My', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'had', 'rented', 'kids', 'invited', 'wife', 'come', 'daughter', 'watch', 'pride', 'being', 'easy', 'going', 'did', ""n't"", 'insist', 'different', 'film', 'just', 'came', 'family', 'braced', 'bad', 'movie.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'fair', 'share', 'faults', 'ways', 'usual', 'kiddy', 'film', 'clich', 'eacute', 'keep', 'interested', 'entertained', 'films', 'entirety', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'Also', 'being', 'children', 'film', 'Sandler', 'usual', 'flair', 'unnecessarily', 'offensive', 'toned', 'down', 'so', 'actually', 'off', 'as', 'funny', 'apposed', 'moronic', 'truly', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'film', 'mostly', 'expected', 'be', 'befuddled', 'mess', 'kept', 'line', 'managed', 'bring', 'spark', 'sincerity', 'character', 'giving', 'films', 'overall', 'moral', 'boost', 'surprisingly', 'charming', 'performance.Aside', 'Sandler', 'film', 'littered', 'serviceable', 'performances', 'excelling', 'more', 'others', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'perfect', 'complement', 'Sandler', 'here', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'not', 'actor', 'have', 'been', 'overly', 'fond', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'have', 'say', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'villain', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'own', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'hilarious', 'as', 'genuinely', 'memorable', 'comedic', 'relief', 'here', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'extremely', 'good', 'looking', 'needed', 'be', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'pretty', 'much', 'throwaway', 'here', 'fine.Courtney', 'Cox', 'more', 'work.So', 'end', 'charming', 'little', 'film', 'lonely', 'man', 'bedtime', 'stories', 'start', 'come', 'true', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'well', 'worth', 'giving', 'try']",N/A
1190908,A32T2H8150OJLU,B001FB55MG,ARH,"[0, 0]","As you probably know, Adam Sandler has a tendency to make pretty darned funny movies, e.g.,Happy Gilmore (Widescreen Special Edition), but they are often too edgy or crass to be considered family viewing fare.  Bedtime Stories, however, is a watchable film.  It is still a bit edgy, but not so much so that you couldn't watch it.Sandler plays a character who grew up in a motel owned and operated by his father.  He thinks it is the most wonderful place in the entire world.  His sister, on the other hand, is a complete pragmatist, apparently with little imagination.  Fast forward to today, and Sandler is working as a maintenance man in a mega-hotel where his father's motel used to stand.  About this time Sandler's sister needs to leave town and she needs Sandler to watch her two children.There are some laugh-out-loud scenes when he meets the kids.  He discovers that his sister is  extremely socially conscious and does not allow her children to watch TV or eat any junk food at all.  Sandler doesn't quite know how to deal with this.  The scene where he asks if they have any books is hilarious!  I love the quote, as he scoffs, ""I'm reading this Communist books to you!""  It is then that the kids convince Sandler to tell them a bedtime story.  As he tells the story the kids ask questions and add bits of their own.  The magical part of the story is that his bedtime stories start to come true - after a fashion - the following day.Sandler goes from misadventure to misadventure as he tries to turn these stories to his advantage.This is a fun family show, though not likely IMO to be a classic with much staying power.

But it is entertaining and pretty darned funny, which is why I gave it a lukewarm positive review rating.I give it a positive rating with a serious note of caution for Mr. Sandler. Now I'm not an Adam Sandler fan and, in fact, have often avoided his childish and mindless comedies (I point you to the insipidness that isLittle Nicky,Mr. Deeds, and, well ...you can look up the rest). However he has surprised me on occasion with a flash of talent in such things asSpanglishandReign Over Me. But, in truth, looking at the trailers and reviews of BEDTIME STORIES, I was more than just a little hesitant to check it out. My big note of caution comes in the form of another early actor who lately has been putting out some of the worst films on celluloid. I'm talking about Eddie Murphy. Murphy's early career reads like the who's-who of great comedies:48 HOURS,Trading Places, and the king of them all,Beverly Hills Cop. These are films that are ingrained in the cinematic community. But look at what he's done lately and you can't help but become a tad nauseous.Norbit,The Haunted Mansion,Daddy Day Careand the abominable The Adventures of Pluto Nash. And that terrible list seems to be growing. Where Murphy apparently has fallen down is in that he's trying hard (and it's obvious he's trying too hard) to be family friendly. Everything he's done lately has been PG or friendlier. I'm not saying that PG films can't be good, it's just that they can stifle the creative process as production companies attempt to appeal to a broader audience. Which brings us back to Bedtime Stories...It's PG. It's good. It's not great. And it nearly slips into the shoddy category, but doesn't for a few reasons that aren't necessarily related to Sandler. The main attraction (for me, at least) was watching the two young kids, Jonathan Morgan Heit and Laura Ann Kesling. It is their infectious and animated actions that made the movie oh-so-watchable. One scene in particular that has stuck with me is when Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) is in the bathroom and has shaving cream all over her head and says, ""I""m Princess Leia!""Whenever Sandler is onscreen with the kids, the interest and impact of the story grows tenfold. And it's not just because that's when the bedtime stories are taking place, but because of the kids' interactions with Sandler and his responsiveness to them. This made it, dare I say, very family friendly and will probably bring a smile to the hardest of hearts.So, yeah, this is a fun film. It won't expand your consciousness or challenge your kids to learn anything new.

Sandler plays Skeeter Johnson, a hotel worker that has been cleaning up everyone's messes for twenty-five years. His father had once owned a motel at the same location but it was bought out by another man when they told Skeeter's father they would make Skeeter manager if he worked hard and showed initiative. They then built a big hotel around it. Skeeter has finally come to the conculusion he will never get his shot as promised. The next thing he knows his sister is begging him to watch her kids with another friend of hers while she goes out of town for an interview.All of a sudden he has to babysit his sisters two kids. He hasn't seen his sister in years and considering her unusual vegetarian diet and exaggerated attitude about saving the planet, we wonder why in the world would she choose Skeeter to babysit. His idea of diet includes junkfood and he can't stomach all the save this and that books. So he decides to make up his own story. It turns out Skeeter has a talent for telling bedtime stories like his father before him. The results of the stories on real life is where it really gets interesting. Part of his stories appears to have affected his real life. Or at least how he believes they are is what changes his life. Fun family movie. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability.

1190923,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001FB55MG,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Four of us laughed very hard at this movie, mother, father, 13 and 18 year old males. This is a really good, funny movie, that I think most families would enjoy. It doesn't run the more normal Disney route, in fact if you didn't know it was Disney, you'd never put it in the same league as the cartoons or the marvelous company that brought us Beverly Hills Chiuahua or College Road Trip.Adam Sandler is just exactly the right kind of funny in this film. He used to have the Jim Carrey disease, too much over the top stupidity that was just Adam Sandler playing Adam Sandler. He's grown up a bit, he can still crack a good slapstick joke. He didn't go so far away like in Punch Drunk Love to the serious side. He's really got a heart of gold in this film. I'm not the biggest Sandler fan, but in this film he works well.Keri Russel is simply gorgeous as Sandler's ultimate love interest. August Rush (August Rush) another fantastic family film, but this time about fitting in. Lucy Lawless (Xena) is so perfectly wound up tight at the hotel front desk. Courtney Cox, oh poor Courtney, I just wish she would get some kind of strong good role. She is Sandlers sister in this movie, and is the set up line to many of his jokes. She just seems to deserve better, or I want her to be better in the movies. Guy Pearce is so awful as the hotel nemesis, he looks like an ugly version of Brad Pitt. And Richard Griffiths (Dersley in the Harry Potter series) is perfectly fat, stupid, and mostly evil in this film - not much of a stretch from the Potter films. The supporting cast is very good - Rob Schneider shows up and is restrained.Oh just such a good fun film. The clips make it seem almost like a Ground Hog day, where Sandler is trapped in the bedtime stories. It doesn't really play like that. The stories are there as a plot element, but it's more about heart and doing the right things than those stories. In fact that is the point of this film, be good, work hard, and good things will happen to you.From a technical standpoint, this is standard high quality Hollywood film making. Big budget, well shot, well edited, well recorded...no nits to pick anywhere really. It's what we expect from a good current film. Even the CG effects are sufficiently well done even on a television screen. Yes the Roman Colessium looks fake and CG, but it's also a dream sequence, so it's not a horrible thing.The film is rated PG. It seems like younger viewers will get this film. I laughed when Skeeter finally kisses Jill, the children's mother Wendy puts her hands over their eyes so they don't watch. It's so perfectly that age, I remember it so well with my boys (don't watch the smoochy moment in the film). There are a few slightly off color jokes, but they are really mild. No violence. Nothing even remotely approaching nudity (Skeeter does hold up a pair of underwear at one point to show that he brought his toothbrush, toothpaste and clean underwear....well not so clean). It seems most children would get this humor and love the funny story.The DVD had no special features at all. A barren disc except for the movie. Well it does have that stupid Disney ""fastplay"". Whoopie, press the menu button to avoid that nonsense. When will Disney learn to get rid of that silly ""feature.""Highly recommend this one. I think most will enjoy the humor and nice message.

1190927,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001FB55MG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 5]","A child-friendly Adam Sandler film!  An enjoyable family film with a good dose of fantasy and action balancing both Walt Disney innocence and Happy Madison craziness.The film is directed by Adam Shankman (""Hairspray"", ""The Wedding Planner"", ""Bringing Down the House"" and a screenplay by Matt Lopez (""Race to Witch Mountain"") and Saturday Night Live writer Tim Herlihy (""The Wedding Singer"", ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Little Nicky"" and ""Big Daddy"")""Bedtime Stories"" is a film that kicks off a flashback from the past, taking place at a family run inn.  Father Marty Bronson (Jonathan Pryce) raising his two children (also employees of the Inn) trying to keep his business and family afloat.  Every night reading his children a bedtime story, Bronson tries to keep a happy face despite knowing his inn is not doing well financially.  Businessman and hotel mogul Barry Nottingham offers Marty plenty of money if he signs away the rights to the inn and Marty agrees to the deal if only he makes a promise that when his son Skeeter becomes older, he would run the inn.  The two make a deal.Flash forward to the present, nearly twenty five years later and the inn has now become among one of Nottingham's multi-million dollar hotel investments and is now a popular, classy and luxurious hotel in Southern California.  Meanwhile, Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler), a middle-aged man handyman/custodian is not exactly running the business as his father has hoped.When Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) makes an announcement of a new hotel to open up in Southern California, Skeeter feels that perhaps this is his time.  Unfortunately, the job is given to the arrogant Kendall (Guy Pearce).  A man who is dating Nottingham hotel heiress Violet Nottingham (Teresa Palmer), a party hopping, Paris Hilton-esque socialite and behind-the-scenes, Kendall is having fun with the hotel concierge Aspen (Lucy Lawless).Feeling that he's down on his luck, Skeeter goes to visit his sister Wendy (Courteney Cox) and his niece Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) and nephew Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heit) who is celebrating a birthday.  But all is not good with the family.  Wendy's husband has left the family and she lost her job as a principal of her school due to the school closing.  She has an interview for a job in another state but she needs someone to watch the kids for a few days.  So, she asks if Skeeter can watch the kids at night, while during the day, her friend and a teacher at the school, Jill (Keri Russell), who has the children during the day.  Unfortunately, Skeeter and Jill are at opposite ends of the spectrum and don't get along.But Skeeter, who is not really close to the kids (nor do they know each other very well) agrees to take care of them for a few days.  Also, joining them is their guinea pig (with its big eyes) named Bubsy.Both Bobbia and Patrick have been raised by their mother to eat healthy, no television but Skeeter feels they need to have some fun.  So, he lets them watch television, eat burgers and reads them a bedtime story.  But Skeeter is not exactly in the happiest moods due to his job situation, so each time he tells a story, he ends it with a bad ending.  So, the first bedtime story features a peasant named Sir Fix-a-Lot (Sandler) who is a hardworking man who is bypassed from a job which goes to Sir Butkiss (Pearce), a story that mirrors Skeeter's own life. But the children insist that a story must have a happy ending, so they start adding to the storyline of how things workout for Sir Fix-a-Lot such as his boss giving him a chance to prove that he's worthy of taking over the business and gumballs start raining in on him.  Then after the kids finish the story, a sound of chimes appear.  When Skeeter asks what that sound was, the kids tell him that it's their guinea pig ringing the chimes and wanting to go to sleep.The day after, certain things that were told in the bedtime story comes true.  After bad decision making by Kendall, Mr. Nottingham decides that he will give Skeeter a chance of taking over the new hotel.  But it all comes down to who can come up with the best plan for the new hotel.  Skeeter or Kendall.  But for Skeeter, he feels something may be magical with the bedtime story when gumballs raining on top of him (actually a gumball truck was hit in an accident and thus the balls are falling off the interstate on to his car).Feeling that the kids and even Bubsy may have something magical, he feels that perhaps he can help them come up with a great bedtime story that would benefit him in real life.  So, with the last remaining three days with the children before he returns him to his mother, Skeeter comes up with ideas for him to get a Ferrari, a kiss from a damsel in distress and more!  But of course, with the children's imaginative minds, things don't work out as smooth as Skeeter is hoping for things to be.VIDEO & AUDIO:Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has been on top of their Blu-ray game.  Becoming one of the few companies to release their Blu-rays with a bonus DVD and digital copy all in one, the Blu-ray releases are also known for its magnificent picture and audio quality.So, with the release of ""BEDTIME STORIES"", the film is featured via 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:30:1.  Picture quality is vibrant and  looks absolutely beautiful.  One of the things that helps the film is much of it is filmed outdoors.  With beautiful shots by DP Michael Barrett, the film really captures colors with the gumballs to the red Ferrari (horse and car).  I didn't see any artifacting during the dark scenes and picture quality is just magnificent via High Definition on Blu-ray.  Also, another plus is that the film utilizes a good blend of real time shooting and CG (during the sci-fi action scenes).Another positive for the Blu-ray release is that the special features are featured in 1080p.As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48kHZ, 24-Bit) and again, one of the positive things about this film is that the bedtime story sequences are action-based.  And thus you get very good audio response from your front, center and rear channels.  Scenes such as ""Gravity Wars"" from the audience to the weapon usage to Skeeter's truck backfiring, really sounds good courtesy of the DTS-HD.  I noticed certain scenes really come quite strong from the rear surround channels during the action sequences.  Dialogue overall is heard quite clearly from your front and center channels.Also, included is a French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital track as well.Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:Special features included on the ""Bedtime Stories"" Blu-ray are:* Until Gravity Do Us Part - A four minute behind-the-scenes look at the film's mindboggling special effects.  Interviews with John Adrew Berton Jr. (Visual Effects Supervisor) and Garrett Warren (Fight Choreographer) on how the segment was filmed.  Quite interesting how much was put into the making of this scene CG wise and also instead of green screen, using all blu-screen and how much went into the fight choreography and getting Sandler and Pearce ready for the role.* It's Bugsy - A near four minute featurette featuring a close up of Bugsy the big-eyed guinea pig.  Behind-the-scenes of how many guinea pigs were used in the film and how they were utilized.  Interviews with the cast of working with the guinea pig and more.* To All The Little People - A near six minute featurette featuring interviews with Laura Ann Kesling (Bobbi) and Jonathan Morgan Heit (Patrick) and how they felt about working with Director Adam Shankman, Adam Sandler, Russell Brand, Keri Russell, Courteney Cox and others.  Also, how the talent felt with working with the children.* Laughter is Contagious Outtakes - A seven minute featurette featuring outtakes and interviews with the cast of working with each other.  How Adam Sandler made everyone laugh and how he was good with the children.  How Rob Schneider would make Adam Sandler laugh and much more.* Cutting Room Flor: Deleted Scenes - Ten minutes worth of 12 deleted and extended scenes.The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled with movie chat, movie mail and Disney Movie Rewards Live.The included DVD features a special feature not included on the Blu-ray disc:* Dylan & Cole Sprouse: Blu-ray is Suite - ""The Suite Life of Zach & Cody"" talents star in a six minute special feature promoting Blu-ray technology.JUDGMENT CALL:I enjoyed ""Bedtime Stories"" for its combination of comedy, fantasy and adventure.  If anything,  it was a fun and enjoyable family film.Sure, I know it is a Happy Madison film (in collaboration with Walt Disney) but parents do not have to worry because none of the adult humor that you would come to expect from a Happy Madison film is there.  If anything, this film is a very fun and safe family film.  And if there was anything that may be deemed as risky, it ended up on the cutting room floor (which scenes you can watch in the deleted scenes special feature).If anything, I think fatherhood has brought out Adam Sandler's gentler side and I think this film is probably one of the rare film to see the side of a lighthearted Adam Sandler with children (you'll see it more evident on the special features as the children absolute adore him).  And for the primary two children of the film, both Laura Ann Kesling (Bobbi) and Jonathan Morgan Heit (Patrick) were just adorable and did a great job for their role in the film.But as much as I enjoyed the film, there were a few more things that were hits but yet a few that were misses.  One of the hits is featuring British comic Russel Brand.  His interaction with Sandler was fun as the sleep panicky, crazy friend.  And of course, what would a Adam Sandler Happy Madison film be without Rob Schneider in some crazy role and in this case, as Chief Runningmouth and the pickpocket thief.As for misses, it would have to be Lucy Lawless as Aspen.  As much as I enjoy watching the ""Xena""/""Battlestar Galactica"" actress, in the beginning, you get a feeling of the conspiring duo of Aspen and Kendall trying to gain power to run a hotel. So, you kind of get a feeling of a juicy conspiring role with her character and the protagonist Kendall but all of a sudden, she's lost in the second half of the film. If anything, what could have been a strong villain with the Aspen and Kendall duo in the film, suddenly gets degraded and the focus becomes more on family helping each other and the chemistry between Sandler's Skeeter and Russel's Jill.So, it was unfortunate that Lawless's character as Aspen didn't live up to its potential but at least she had a good appearance in the first half of the film, unlike Carmen Elektra who has only a non-speaking cameo as the girlfriend of a guy showing off his vehicle.Also, for some people who want an explanation of how these mysterious bedtime stories end up coming real for Skeeter, this is not the film to be logical (then again are many Happy Gilmore films logical?).  If anything, ""Bedtime Stories"" is a straightforward family film that the children can watch and enjoy.  I watched the film with my six-year-old son and he absolutely enjoyed it.With the release of the film on Blu-ray, the fact that this film had so many outdoor shots and a good balance of action and sci-fi scenes, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has been on the winning end in bringing films out to Blu-ray with great picture and audio quality and ""Bedtime Stories"" does not disappoint.  And the fact that you get the DVD and a digital copy on disc, that's another positive reason to own this film in my book.Overall, what I really enjoyed is how the film incorporated so many elements from sci-fi films, action films of old, and balancing it with comedy.  It was a fun film and definitely not a film to take seriously (and again, I feel like I repeat this each time with many Happy Gilmore related films that I review).  So, if you are looking for a fun family film that the children will definitely enjoy, ""Bedtime Stories"" is definitely recommended!",4,"A child-friendly Adam Sandler film! `Bedtime Stories' is an

It is never really clear why, for example, why the two main characters fall in love (they go from hating each other to nearly kissing in the span of a few minutes).

1190935,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001FB55MG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 7]","I don't really think of Adam Sandler as a polarizing creature, but the prevailing sense seems to be that you're either in his camp or you're not, either you're entertained by his low brow, mush-mouth humor, or you're not. For me, it comes and goes. I've liked stuff of his in the past, really enjoyedThe Wedding Singer - Totally Awesome Edition,The Waterboy,Big Daddy,Punch-Drunk Love (Single Disc Edition)and50 First Dates (Widescreen Special Edition). But I've also cringed at LITTLE NICKY, MR. DEEDS, ANGER MANAGEMENT and now this one, BEDTIME STORIES. I had hopes for this one.The cool premise is what drew me in. Adam Sandler plays yet another lovable underdog loser. Here, he is Skeeter Bronson, a lowly, ill-treated maintenance man toiling at the posh high-rise Sunny Vista Nottingham Hotel, which years ago used to be his pappy's humble hotel, before all the fancy remodelings. Skeeter visits his travel-bound sister (Courtney Cox) and is talked into babysitting her little boy and girl for a week.His sister is one of those uptight broads who doesn't own a TV and reads to her kids from books like ""Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"" and ""The Organic Squirrel Gets A Bike Helmet."" Skeeter hasn't seen these kids in four years, what with the brother-in-law harboring a hate on for him, so there's some awkwardness in the air. Sis has banned TV and video games for her kids and feeds them crappalicious health foods. As a last recourse Skeeter begins to regale the children with his own invented bedtime stories - these tailored around his hapless life experiences - only to be startled when his fairy tales take on life and begin to impact his everyday reality. This being an Adam Sandler character, thoughts on how to capitalize on this magical phenomenon soon crop up. This being a Disney flick, the movie audience feels secure in that Skeeter will soon turn a corner and become that guy who does the right thing.There's a subplot concerning an elementary school about to be demolished to make way for a fancy mammoth hotel. What are the odds that Skeeter's sister works at that school and that the projected hotel is actually a chain extension of the Sunny Vista Nottingham Hotel? Subtle are the inner workings of a Sandler flick.Thing is, BEDTIME STORIES is one of the more kid-friendly flicks Sandler's ever been in, so from that angle, I guess I recommend it for the tiny tots. I do think they'll laugh themselves silly and, as usual with Disney, there are good family values to pick up on. However, the more sophisticated kids may turn their nose up at Sandler's predictable sense of humor - or not. It all depends on if you like potty jokes, dwarves kicking you in the shin or snot monsters slobbering all over you. Sandler is more restrained and does tone down the raunchy stuff, to merit that PG rating. And who would've thunk that I'd feel sorry for a defanged Sandler? And I guess, with the trend nowadays of injecting that hip, contemporary wink within all these fairy tale comedies, the film had to follow suit. But, unlike inEnchanted (Widescreen Edition), the SHREK flicks, and evenElla Enchanted (Widescreen Edition), the modern-day twists in the CG-heavy fairy tale sequences feel forced and unfunny, with Sandler's laziness stampeding over the film's few grace notes. And I couldn't help but feel that the guinea pig with the disturbingly huge saucer eyes was put in mostly as a running go-to gag, so that, if the kids aren't laughing - well, hey, kids, look at the funny-looking guinea pig!Keri Russell comes in as Skeeter's co-baby-sitter and projected love interest, although there isn't much spark between the two actors. Following a certain romantic cliche, Sandler and Russell's characters are almost instantly at each other's throats and for much of the film engage in antagonistic banter, leaving me feeling lukewarm. Guy Pearce is over-the-top as the prissy, conniving hotel manager, although he does get a thumbs up for that one song and dance routine. Old Xena Warrior Princess herself, Lucy Lawless, is unrecognizable and wasted as the snooty assistant who hangs her star to Pearce's manager. Jonathan Pryce plays Skeeter's dad and Pryce is instrumental in nicely setting up the story, but then he disappears once Sandler comes into the picture. Courtney Cox is also wasted and not much in the film.Also helping to sink the movie is that the fairy tale sequences come off as dull. There's a lack of wit and charm, and, after a while, a mind-numbing repetitiveness as we see the cast time and again play characters in Skeeter's self-absorbed fairy tale dramas. There's a scene early on in which Skeeter's cool dad states, ""Your fun is only limited by your imagination."" If only the screenplay writers had heeded their own advice. As it is, when I hear another line in the movie, this time coming from Sandler - ""I'm like the stink on your feet -- I'll always be there."" - I can't help but feel vaguely threatened.On one hand, I liked Skeeter's ringtone, and I like that the flighty Paris Hilton type actually turns out to be an okay character. On the other hand, Rob Schneider makes his token appearance, and he's never been more unwelcome.Maybe I've been too hard on INKHEART.",2,dis-ENCHANTED,1246233600,"06 29, 2009",2009,5218,"['do',

I mean it had a great storyline,  and the trailers looked good, but thats about it for the good stuff.  I thought the character Sandler played was a boorish, rude and lazy person.  I don't see where it is funny for him to shut the door in a womans face (twice) when she is being nice to him and talking to him.  Yeah, let's teach our little boys to be rude.  Sandler has to take care of his sister's kids for a few days and he do so in a careless manner and expects others to pick up his slack.  He wasn't the type of character that you rooted for and had hope for.  Of course, the movie writers make the  pretty girl fall for him even though he has been nothing but rude to her. Ugh, disgusting.  Yes, I realize it is a movie, but when the main character isn't endearing or funny, it isn't a fun movie to watch.  The kids and supporting actresses were fine, so that was the only glimmer of light in the movie.  What a waste of a potential good story.

He just plays the same obnoxious, violent jerk in all his movies. I don't know why talented actors like Jack Nicholson have been drawn to work with him. Here, you have talented actors like Keri Russel, Guy Pearce, Courtney Cox and the hilarious Russel Brand.Sandler's character isn't that much different from what he usually plays. He's a little bit obnoxious and a little less violent. But for once I actually found him likable. Russel Brand easily steals every scene he shares with Sandler though. He's basically playing the same guy he did in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but I rather see him have a long career of playing the same guy than Sandler. Guy Pearce though, I have no idea what made him do this movie. He's a very talented actor but he's just wasted here as the guy who's getting the job that Sandler's character wants. He's not very good in the movie either I admit. He really should stick to more serious roles. To see what I mean, check him out in Memento or Traitor and then watch him in this. Hell, he was even better in the Time Machine.Another problem I had with it was that the guinea pig is over-used and not that funny. They just gave a guinea pig CGI big eyes and call him Bugsy, woo hoo. But hey, maybe kids will find that more funny than grown-ups.The movie did keep my attention through-out though. I found it fun at times even. Sandler is decent in a movie that someone like Brendon Fraser would usually be in. It's a much better fantasy comedy for him than Click was as well. Plus, unlike with Click, there's no scene where he attempts to make us feel for his character by crying....thank god.",3,Surprisingly not that bad,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,1713,"['usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'much', 'think', 'very', 'over-rated', 'comedian', 'just', 'same', 'obnoxious', 'violent', 'jerk', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'talented', 'actors', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'work', 'Here', 'have', 'talented', 'actors', 'Keri', 'Russel', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'hilarious', 'Russel', 'Brand.Sandler', 'character', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'different', 'what', 'usually', 'little', 'bit', 'obnoxious', 'little', 'less', 'violent', 'once', 'actually', 'found', 'likable', 'Russel', 'Brand', 'easily', 'scene', 'shares', 'Sandler', 'basically', 'playing', 'same', 'guy', 'did', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'rather', 'see', 'have', 'long', 'career', 'playing', 'same', 'guy', 'Sandler', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'made', 'do', 'movie', 'very', 'talented', 'actor', 'just', 'wasted', 'here', 'guy', 'who', 'getting', 'job', 'Sandler', 'character', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'admit', 'really', 'should', 'stick', 'more', 'serious', 'roles', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'check', 'out', 'Memento', 'Traitor', 'then', 'watch', 'Hell', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'Time', 'Machine.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'guinea', 'pig', 'over-used', 'not', 'funny', 'just', 'gave', 'guinea', 'pig', 'CGI', 'big', 'eyes', 'call', 'Bugsy', 'woo', 'hoo', 'hey', 'maybe', 'kids', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'funny', 'grown-ups.The', 'movie', 'did', 'keep', 'attention', 'through-out', 'found', 'fun', 'times', 'even', 'Sandler', 'decent', 'movie', 'someone', 'Brendon', 'Fraser', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'fantasy', 'comedy', 'Click', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'Click', 'scene', 'where', 'make', 'feel', 'character', 'crying', '.thank', 'god']",N/A

His friends help him along. There are fewer sexual innuendos than in previous Sander flicks. However, there are quite a few cleavage shots. Overall, Bedtime Stories is closer in feel to Mr. Deeds than Happy Gilmore,Wedding Singer or 50 First Dates.Why I liked it? Sandler is amusing with his sarcastic delivery and pent-up energy. The characters he plays are little boys in a man's body and that's always entertaining in my book. The movies he produces are sweet on several levels. Pro-family, not necessarily the mom, pop and 1.5 kids family, but the made up pack-type of families that tend to form on our American landscape. I love that Sandler's characters are overcomers. Regardless of the rottenness of life, they tend to struggle with the idea of change but eventually grab hold of a challenge and become better people. Sander's characters, in all the movies I've seen, are quirkily real and sometimes annoyingly sweet. The good guys have warts and the bad guys, well, they have way more warts and bad attitudes, too.  Bedtime Stories contains all of these elements.What I find annoying? The Little People aka dwarves always seem thrown in for simple laugh fodder.This is fun entertainment and classic Sandler.

True, when his father sold the location to hotel mogul Barry Nottingham (Richard Giffiths), Barry promised to make Skeeter the manager when he grew up.  But that's never happened.  And now Barry has plans to build an even bigger hotel in the area and make Kendall (Guy Pearce) the manager.Meanwhile, Skeeter's sister calls.  Wendy (Courtney Cox) needs Skeeter to watch her two kids while she is out of town looking for a new job.  Skeeter hasn't had any contact with them for four years, but he agrees.That night, he tells the kids a bedtime story that gets pretty crazy.  And yet the next day, it seems to come true.  Excited, Skeeter can't wait for the next bedtime story.  Has he figured out a way to make his every wish come true or is something else at work here?I'm not normally an Adam Sandler fan, but the previews for this movie intrigued me so much, I just had to see it.  And I'm glad I did.  There were laughs all the way through.  In fact, I'd say the best laughs weren't spoiled in the previews.  Bugsy, the hamster, has some hilarious antics.  And the story gets so crazy at times you can't help but laugh.Yet the laughs are supported by a decent story.  Yes, the broad outline is predictable, but the journey to the end is fun, so you really don't care.  Beside, the kids add a few random plot points to the film, which keep things from being too stale.The stories that Skeeter tells vary greatly in location.

Instead, I got an Adam Sandler movie that is actually suitable for kids.  (disclaimer: I'm an Adam Sandler fan and have a more favorable view of his body of work than most movie critics.)  Even though this is a Disney movie, all the telltale signs of a Sandler movie are there: a kind, simple minded protagonist who battles an arrogant bad guy; an attractive woman who wants nothing to do with Sandler but eventually falls in love with him; Sandler speaking in funny voices; Rob Schneider playing a weirdo; bit parts for Tim Herlihy and Allen Covert; and a soundtrack loaded with 80's music.The Amazon editorial review pretty much sums up the movie.  Sandler plays a hotel handy man that babysits his niece and nephew.  Their bedtime stories come true.  Craziness ensues.  Sandler saves the day.  There are plenty of jokes and references for adults and plenty of wacky adventures and visual gags for kids.  Sandler proved that he can make a funny movie suitable for the whole family, and he didn't even need Drew Barrymore to do it.  Notable supporting actors include Guy Pearce as the bad guy, Russell Brand as the sidekick, Keri Russell as the love interest, Courtney Cox as the sister, Lucy Lawless (Xena!) as the bad girl, and Richard Griffiths (Vernon Dursley) as the hotel owner.",5,a Sandler movie for a younger audience,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,1353,"['was', 'expecting', 'Disney', 'movie', 'happened', 'star', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Instead', 'got', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'actually', 'suitable', 'kids', 'disclaimer', ""'m"", 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'fan', 'have', 'more', 'favorable', 'view', 'body', 'work', 'most', 'movie', 'critics', 'Even', 'Disney', 'movie', 'telltale', 'signs', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'are', 'there', 'kind', 'simple', 'minded', 'protagonist', 'who', 'arrogant', 'bad', 'guy', 'attractive', 'woman', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'Sandler', 'eventually', 'love', 'Sandler', 'speaking', 'funny', 'voices', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'playing', 'weirdo', 'bit', 'parts', 'Tim', 'Herlihy', 'Allen', 'Covert', 'soundtrack', 'loaded', '80', 'music.The', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'movie', 'Sandler', 'hotel', 'handy', 'man', 'niece', 'nephew', 'bedtime', 'stories', 'come', 'true', 'Craziness', 'ensues', 'Sandler', 'day', 'are', 'plenty', 'jokes', 'references', 'adults', 'plenty', 'wacky', 'adventures', 'visual', 'gags', 'kids', 'Sandler', 'proved', 'can', 'make', 'funny', 'movie', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'do', 'Notable', 'supporting', 'actors', 'include', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'bad', 'guy', 'Russell', 'Brand', 'sidekick', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'love', 'interest', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'sister', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'Xena', 'bad', 'girl', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'Vernon', 'Dursley', 'hotel', 'owner']",N/A

I know little about movie stars but I do recognize Adam Sandler. He a good actor, but more importantly, the story has an interesting storyline that keeps my attention! With the others, I watch them to learn Spanish. This time, I was watching because I was interested. Here's what so good about it:1. Storyline has many surprises or twists to keep me hooked. The surprises are reasonable and sensible, not ridiculous like bad movies' plots.2. Adam Sandler is a good actor, but surprisingly, the two kids in there are very good too, which is rare for kids that young. They look about 4 and 6, and they can do these long conversations nicely. Mostly of the time, kids that young don't talk much in movies. So it's pretty cool to watch those kids talk so well.3. The special effects look really neat! Nowadays, they can do anything on TV, and this movie took advantage of that! The castle, the knights, the arena in space, the Wild West town, everything looks real and cool!I can totally see myself watching this movie again and again and enjoy the scenes while I learn Spanish.

All I can say is that my kids had a lot of fun and, in spite of a few misgivings, I did too. It's got all the inventive and enjoyable moments that madeNight at the Museumfun -- but adds to the mix the absurd ""throw logic and PC out the window"" style of a toned-down-for-the-whole-family Adam Sandler comedy.The film takes the irreverent, smart-alecky but down-on-his-luck schlub that Adam Sandler plays in almost every one of his films, and places him smack dab in the center of a Disney fairy tale. Skeeter is an overworked and underappreciated hotel employee, the true heir to his father's hotel, who is taken advantage of by the evil usurper Kendall (Guy Pearce) and overlooked by the princess Violet (Teresa Palmer). He will have to prove his mettle and win the rights to the hotel using his wits, imagination and a little Disney magic.The magic comes from the fact that everytime he tells a bedtime story to his over-protected niece and nephew, their contributions to the story somehow come true the next day. This is both good and bad for him. Gumballs falling from the sky are fine, and a fun touch. But an angry dwarf kicking him in the shin is not so much fun, for him at least. The nice thing about this is it gives a ""rationale"" for the absurd and illogical coincidences that are par for the course in Adam Sandler films -- and it reminds you that at bottom his humor is exactly the kind of humor that children come up with. Only that in most of his other films it would be kids with a nasty sense of humor and a foul mouth -- here, for the most part, it is all good clean fun. Sure he makes fun of vegetarians and environmentalists, but he makes fun of capitalist greed as well.

Seeing that movie, I lost a lot of respect for him. I kept wanting to leave the theater, but I convinced myself to stay, only to realize I shouldn't have.Anyways, I swallowed my pride and rented this movie tonight in Blu-Ray. I'm really glad I did actually. It looks like all is forgiven with Mister Sandler.Skeeter Bronson is a failing Utility man at a luxury hotel. His (overly eco-friendly) sister is leaving town for a week, so he watches over them for a week. He is to watch them at night when in the day, a friend of hers watches in the day. It seems as it they have not so good first impressions. However, they settle bad first impressions with Bedtime stories he tells. The stories are cute, fun, fantastical, and imaginative. And the funny thing is that they relate to his life- the hotel arses, him trying to win the management, the OCD boss, and much more.I liked the movie a lot actually. It was funny, it was cute. It even had that classic Journey song Don't Stop Believin'. The special effects were great too! They looked very realistic and were very well done. And Sandler was hilarious too. So if you like the Sandler-type humor, be sure to see it.BLU-RAY:-VIDEO QUALITY: 4.5/5The movie has a spectacular presentation. The video quality looks great especially in the story scenes. The best one weeing with Skeeto (I do mean the Sci-Fi one). The reason it gets half a point docked off is because of a slight grain in the few of a conversation scenes. But after a while it's unnoticeable.-SOUND QUALITY: 5/5The sound quality is excellent. The sound will blow you away, especially the ancient Rome scene. The music is quite mind blowing too. The 5.1 is great too. Good use of the back speakers too, during the story sequences you really feel like the crowd is surrounding you. It's a good release for sure.-EXTRAS: 3/5:A shame, really, about the extras. With the exception of the deleted scenes, they're very short. For one, we don't get a commentary track here. There's one about the space scene which is interesting but not really much. The one about Bugsy is wasted potential too. The one about the kids is OK, but WHERE'S A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE MOVIE? On the bright side, we have some cool deleted scenes, as well as some hilarious outtakes.OVERALL: This is a good movie that's worth it for sure if you love Adam Sandler you'll like this movie.

Despite Marty's love for the business, he never quite succeeded and ended up having to sell his beloved hotel to a large chain.  The chain's owner, Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths) promised at some point if Marty sold, Skeeter would run the hotel.It's twenty plus years later, and Skeeter does run the hotel all right.  He's the maintenance man.  His sister Wendy contacts him for the first time in four years and asks him to babysit her two kids for the week while she looks for employment in Arizona.  Though Skeeter doesn't know it yet, the school Wendy is principal of is going to be torn down to build another Nottingham hotel.Desperate for some way to entertain two kids he hardly knows, Skeeter lights on the idea of telling them bedtime stories.

I heard such horror stories from You Don't Mess with Zohan [You Don't Mess With the Zohan (Rated Single-Disc Edition)] (the previews are positively crazy) that I was not sure which incarnation of Sandler I would get when I watched Bedtime Stories.  ""Stories"" doesn't disappoint on a child level, though much of the plot does not make a lot of sense.Released during the 2008 holiday season, starring Adam Sandler, Guy Pearce, Keri Russell, Richard Griffiths, Courteney Cox, Lucy Lawless, Teresa Palmer, Russell Brand, Aisha Tyler, and Jonathan Pryce.Courtney Cox hasn't lost her comedy timing from Friends.  Lucy Lawless plays a secondary character, but her attempt at comedy gets in the way of her more serious roles from Battlestar Galactica or her campy Xena.The bug-eyed guinea-pig is a freakish large-eyed animal, that Skeeter exclaims would ""be big for a cow!""  Thankfully, the cute rodent is not overly played -- at least not too much. :)Although a Disney film, there is a mild potty humor to the piece (which makes me argue: there were plenty of funny comedy films from Disney in the 70s and 80s without the fart jokes, but I digress).The story essentially starts off in a heartwarming but dangerously boring vein.  We meet his dad and the two kids.  The boy Skeeter has an active imagination and loves to hear bedtime stories from his dad.  But Skeeter's sister is the serious type.  His dad signs away the deed to the hotel as it builds up lots of red ink.  The buyer says he will have Skeeter as the manager to the new hotel.Twenty years later, Skeeter's dad has died, his sister married then divorced and has two small children, and Skeeter?  Well, he is the janitor!Yeah the same old story of down on his luck fella somehow beats the odds and comes out on top, but not quite.  The stories the kids and Skeeter weave start to actually happen out in the real world.  His nephew imagines what it would be like to have it rain gumballs.  Later in the day, it actually does rain gumballs (dropping from a busted 18 wheeler hauling candy)!Great for the kids, the special effects are a bit fake, the humor only a child could truly appreciate.Recommended for the family, but it doesn't beat Dean Jones in the original Love Bug!

For instance, it's almost really a good movie for kids and almost really funny. It's not quite good, funny, or a movie for kids, but it comes so darn close.Here is what works in Bedtime Stories:Bedtime Stories stars Adam Sandler, who is always likable though generally inane and crude as well. In this case, Sandler toned down the frat-house humor that so hollowed the movie Click.  He turns in his usual affable performance in Bedtime Stories.Russell Brand, who is charismatic though not very versatile, also comes on strong as Sandler's quirky friend.Richard Griffiths, a.k.a. Vernon Dursley of Harry Potter fame, and Courtney Cox also turn in a decent performances... but don't look for any of them to receive an Oscar any time soon.The storyline is great fun--Skeeter Bronson (Sandler) is lowly but talented schlep satisfied with a work-a-day job in a growing hotel.  His life is changed when he agrees to take in his sister's two children while she applies for work in another state.When Skeeter begins making up bedtime stories for the kids, he finds his inventions coming true in the real world.  A good premise.So why is Bedtime Stories only ""almost"" good?In the tradition of all things Sandler, Bedtime Stories falls back on tried and true silliness instead of trusting itself.  The movie includes a string of jokes about a hamster with over-sized eyes.  Fortunately, Disney, of course, stripped out the crude humor that so often shows up in Sandler movies.The additional cast.  I'm sorry but the formula Sandler and Keri Russell did not work.  They did not play off each other.  Sandler and Drew Barrymore had energy.  Sandler and Julie Bowen were great.  Sandler and Russell... not so much.In addition, Sandler has this pathological need to keep an entourage of auxiliary cast member--most notably and dependably bad would be Rob Schneider but there are others.In the end, Bedtime Stories is mildly fun and predictably happy.  For this movie, Disney has taken the edge off Sandler without giving him substance.",3,ALMOST REALLY GOOD,1238803200,"04 4, 2009",2009,2107,"['Bedtime', 'Stories', 'almost', 'really', 'good', 'fact', 'almost', 'really', 'lot', 'things', 'instance', 'almost', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'kids', 'almost', 'really', 'funny', 'not', 'quite', 'good', 'funny', 'movie', 'kids', 'so', 'darn', 'close.Here', 'what', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'who', 'always', 'likable', 'generally', 'inane', 'crude', 'as', 'well', 'case', 'Sandler', 'toned', 'down', 'frat-house', 'humor', 'so', 'hollowed', 'movie', 'Click', 'usual', 'affable', 'performance', 'Bedtime', 'Stories.Russell', 'Brand', 'who', 'charismatic', 'not', 'very', 'versatile', 'also', 'strong', 'Sandler', 'quirky', 'friend.Richard', 'Griffiths', 'a.k.a', 'Vernon', 'Dursley', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'also', 'turn', 'decent', 'performances', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'time', 'soon.The', 'storyline', 'great', 'fun', 'Skeeter', 'Bronson', 'Sandler', 'lowly', 'talented', 'schlep', 'satisfied', 'work-a-day', 'job', 'growing', 'hotel', 'life', 'changed', 'when', 'take', 'sister', 'two', 'children', 'work', 'state.When', 'Skeeter', 'making', 'up', 'bedtime', 'stories', 'kids', 'inventions', 'coming', 'true', 'real', 'world', 'good', 'premise.So', 'why', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'only', 'almost', 'good', 'tradition', 'things', 'Sandler', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'back', 'tried', 'true', 'silliness', 'instead', 'trusting', 'movie', 'string', 'jokes', 'hamster', 'over-sized', 'eyes', 'Fortunately', 'Disney', 'course', 'stripped', 'out', 'crude', 'humor', 'so', 'often', 'up', 'Sandler', 'movies.The', 'additional', 'cast', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'formula', 'Sandler', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'Sandler', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'had', 'energy', 'Sandler', 'Julie', 'Bowen', 'were', 'great', 'Sandler', 'Russell', 'not', 'so', 'much.In', 'addition', 'Sandler', 'pathological', 'need', 'keep', 'entourage', 'auxiliary', 'cast', 'member', 'most', 'notably', 'dependably', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'are', 'end', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'mildly', 'fun', 'predictably', 'happy', 'movie', 'Disney', 'taken', 'edge', 'Sandler', 'giving', 'substance']",N/A

I thought it was going to be primarily fantasy but it wasn't.  It definately has its part of corny and fun fantasy but is really fun trying to predict what is going to happen.The story follows Adam Sandler (Skeeter) as an uncle having to babysit his sister's (Courtney Cox) kids.  They are not allowed to have much modern technology around so Skeeter has to make up his own bedtime stories to put the kids to bed.  Little does he realize but parts of the stories come true as the days go on.It is one of those movies that gives adults something to laugh about and kids at the same time.

It really wasted the opportunity to be a great movie. I have to put at least part of that failure on Adam Sandler's shoulders. His sarcastic and lowest common denominator attitude colored the whole movie in shades of bleah. But the writing was also lousy at times - in particular, the Bedtime Stories were pretty pathetically done. Wouldn't you think that in a movie called Bedtime Stories the stories would actually be fun, funny, or just plain good? No, the stories were like lousy SNL skits. I realize that the kids were helping make the story, but their additions were not really the problem. Anyway, the plot of the actual story was also poorly done.My feeling is that this could have been a GREAT movie and instead ended up as just another fairly bad Adam Sandler type of movie. That said, there are some amusing moments, Keri Russell is divine as always, and Russell Brand was fairly funny. The kids did fine, although it would be nice to just one time see a boy in a movie who doesn't have Little Kid Big Hair syndrome (pet peeve).This is not a horrible movie. It's a 2 star movie.

Disney's comedy ""Bedtime Stories"" stars Adam Sandler as Skeeter Bronson, a hotel maintenance man dreaming of becoming a hotel manager someday. Today, however, Skeeter must take care of his niece and nephew while their mother Wendy (Courtney Cox) is away from home looking for a new job. Skeeter then realizes that ""bedtime stories"" he and the two kids make up - Westerns, Roman chariot racing, etc. - all really come true next day in an unexpected fashion he can never predict.Yes, it is a Disney film with the Walt Disney castle logo, which means ""Bedtime Stories"" is Adam Sandler's (first) family picture. ""Bedtime Stories"" has one good idea about ""dreams come true,"" but the film's storyline is largely predictable with stock characters like Skeeter's mean-spirited rival played by cast-against-type, intentionally hammy Guy Pierce, plus a wide-eyed lovely guinea pig. Sandler's easygoing Skeeter makes a nice contrast with Keri Russell's serious-minded Jill, but some of his fans may be disappointed with his toned-down performances and the good-natured, but harmless comedy.Perhaps some of you will find the unique cast including Jonathan Pryce, Richard Griffiths, Russell Brand and Rob Schneider (and a cameo of one beloved character from ""Toy Story"") is more interesting than its weak subplot about Skeeter's promotion and love romance.

The other was BEDTIME STORIES, a film the critic meeting with mediocrity, but that was made major box office during the Christmas season.  The film has a pretty decent story line with enough laughs for kids and adults and is actually quite family friendly (the movie was the first Happy Gilmore Production to receive a PG rating).Sandler portrays Skeeter Bronson the son of a father (Jonathan Pryce) who attempted to fulfill his life dream of owning and operating a small hotel.  However, Skeeter's dad just isn't a very good businessmen and ends up having to sell his hotel to Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths), but only on the condition that when Skeeter is grown that he will be made manager.  The deal is struck and Nottingham tears down the quaint hotel and builds a luxurious, mega-hotel.  He keeps Skeeter around as the head janitor, but soon forgets the promise he made.  When Skeeter learns that Nottingham is going to be building a new hotel, he believes this is his big break, but then Nottingham announces his future son-in-law, Kendall (Guy Pierce) will be the manager of the new hotel.  Skeeter is heartbroken.  However, he does have other matters to occupy part of his time because his sister, Wendy (Courtney Cox) has to leave town for a job interview and asks Skeeter to watch over her kids, Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heti) and Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling), in the evenings and overnight.  Wendy has already arranged for a friend of hers, Jill (Keri Russell) to watch the kids during the day but in the evenings she has classes to attend.  Initially Skeeter is a bit hesitant with the kids and he absolutely abhors Jill.  However, after an evening of bedtime stories the kids are hooked and bond is made between them.  The next morning events from the bedtime story he told that night before begin to come true.  Skeeter is amazed and then attempts to manipulate his nephew and niece ideas to allow his own dreams come true, but true to life, things don't exactly turn out the way he imagines.I really enjoyed BEDTIME STORIES.  The idea of the film is not exactly a new one, but it was done in a fresh and interesting way.  The film has a great amount of family humor, with nothing too gross and very little crudity.  The movie also has some very positive messages about family and living in a community.  Bedtime stories can have a major impact upon children and I really enjoyed how the filmmakers used this concept as a way of strengthening the bonds between emotionally-distanced family members.  Unlike some other recent Sandler projects, BEDTIME STORIES has no pretensions about being some kind of movie it isn't.

I NEVER have been able to sit through one of Sandler's moronic, 1st-grade potty mouth movies---but this one was a perfect combination of his childish, low-brow comedy meets kids' movie. It was well written and put together very, very well! I was surprised to see it get ony 25% at Rotten Tomatoes (most everyone panned it.) What's odd about that is I am REALLY critical and dislike far, far more movies than any audience or critic. I'm fine with any movie (low brow to high brow) so long as it sticks to its own premise and concept. This one did. Judging from the basis of what this movie sets out to do, it does it, and it does it well. (I hope I don't regret this review...again, I can't believe I'm saying this...maybe I too was hexed by a bedtime dream come true.) BTW: If you don't have (or never had) kids...this probably is not a good watch. It's mostly an INSIDE laugh! I WISH Sandler would just sculpt his usual adult-movie nonsense into this venue--kids' movies! What a perfect fit!",4,Bedtime Surprise,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1167,"['am', 'shocked', 'not', 'embarrassed', 'report', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', '-great', 'whole', 'family', '-including', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'roared', 'Truthfully', 'wife', 'roared', 'NEVER', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'sit', 'one', 'Sandler', 'moronic', '1st-grade', 'potty', 'mouth', 'movies', '-but', 'one', 'was', 'perfect', 'combination', 'childish', 'low-brow', 'comedy', 'meets', 'kids', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'put', 'together', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'get', 'ony', '25', '%', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'most', 'everyone', 'panned', 'What', 'odd', 'am', 'REALLY', 'critical', 'dislike', 'far', 'far', 'more', 'movies', 'audience', 'critic', ""'m"", 'fine', 'movie', 'low', 'brow', 'high', 'brow', 'so', 'long', 'own', 'premise', 'concept', 'one', 'did', 'Judging', 'basis', 'what', 'movie', 'out', 'do', 'well', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'review', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'maybe', 'too', 'was', 'hexed', 'bedtime', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'BTW', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'never', 'had', 'kids', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'watch', 'mostly', 'INSIDE', 'laugh', 'WISH', 'Sandler', 'would', 'just', 'sculpt', 'usual', 'adult-movie', 'nonsense', 'venue', 'kids', 'movies', 'What', 'perfect', 'fit']",N/A
