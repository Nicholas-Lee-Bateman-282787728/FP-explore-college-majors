747531,AWDIIREVRB6BI,B00008V2UX,"Collector ""fan""","[3, 3]","The story of Saint Tail comes to an end in this boxset. For me, the ending was quite unexpected and exceeded my expectations. The little twists they threw in the story keep things interesting as the story reaches it's climax. If you've loved Saint Tail so far, you're going to love the ending. A fitting end to a sweet tale at a great price for the high number of episodes in this DVD set.Only negative part of this boxset was the incredible amount of filler episodes. I found myself skipping through some of the episodes because they didn't have anything important to contribute to the main storyline. Could have been a better show if it had less filler episodes but all in all a cute enjoyable show.",4,All Ends Well...,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,701,"['story', 'Saint', 'Tail', 'end', 'boxset', 'ending', 'was', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'little', 'twists', 'threw', 'story', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'story', 'climax', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'Saint', 'Tail', 'so', 'far', ""'re"", 'going', 'love', 'ending', 'fitting', 'end', 'sweet', 'tale', 'great', 'price', 'high', 'number', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'set.Only', 'negative', 'part', 'boxset', 'was', 'incredible', 'amount', 'filler', 'episodes', 'found', 'skipping', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'important', 'contribute', 'main', 'storyline', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'show', 'had', 'less', 'filler', 'episodes', 'cute', 'enjoyable', 'show']",Saint Tail: The Enchanted Collection - Volume 6

747535,A2JMIOAVBGLAJP,B00008V2UX,"R. Love ""primemaiden""","[1, 3]",I love Saint Tail but I feel the Anime is lacking in many ways. Sure this volume is lacking an english track but it also lacks the charm of the manga. The music ages this series by thirty years. I heard this show was made in the mid 1990s but I thought I heard seventies music and the lack luster animation verifies this impression what is up with cheesy seventies music in Anime.The anime has its good points such as additional stories that you won't find in the manga. The character designs are much cleaner than the manga version. Additional screen time for the parents of the heroine.I can conclude with a final note that this is a nice treat for those who haven't read the manga enjoy.,3,"Great Manga ,not so great Anime",1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,690,"['love', 'Saint', 'Tail', 'feel', 'Anime', 'lacking', 'many', 'ways', 'Sure', 'volume', 'lacking', 'english', 'track', 'also', 'charm', 'manga', 'music', 'series', 'thirty', 'years', 'heard', 'show', 'was', 'made', 'mid', '1990s', 'thought', 'heard', 'seventies', 'music', 'lack', 'luster', 'animation', 'verifies', 'impression', 'what', 'up', 'cheesy', 'seventies', 'music', 'Anime.The', 'anime', 'good', 'points', 'such', 'additional', 'stories', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'manga', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'much', 'cleaner', 'manga', 'version', 'Additional', 'screen', 'time', 'parents', 'heroine.I', 'can', 'conclude', 'final', 'note', 'nice', 'treat', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'manga', 'enjoy']",Saint Tail: The Enchanted Collection - Volume 6
