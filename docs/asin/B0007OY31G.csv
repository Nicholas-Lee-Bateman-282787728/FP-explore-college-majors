The story is about a soldier-chick named Deunan Knute (Yes, it's a very wierd name, a lot of people have wierd names in the movie) and she resides in the barren wasteland of what was once Earth and during a heated battle she gets knocked out by E.S.W.A.T. members and gets taken to a city run by Bioroids (a.k.a. clones) called Olympus and becomes a citizen. It turns out her long-lost boyfriend Bryarios is the one who brought her to the city and since their time apart he has become a machine. During her time in the city she learns about several conspiracies and sabotages involving military personnel and counsel members. I'm not revealing anything else you'll just have to watch this movie. The main problem with this movie are some cheesy acting moments, but other than that there's really nothing wrong with this movie. The animation is gorgeous, the action is awesome, and the storyline is pretty good. If you like science-fiction you'll enjoy this movie quite a bit because it's really good.

885132,AK0CENM3LUM28,B0007OY31G,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","Appleseed / B0007OY31G*Spoilers*I would really like to give Appleseed a five star review, I really would. The animation is superb, the story is intriguing, and the voice work is flawless. Unfortunately, the movie needs just that little bit of polish on the edges to be truly perfect, or at least truly perfect for beginners who come to this story brand-new, as I did.I'm unsure how much of the story in this movie will be familiar to existing fans of this anime franchise. The story revolves around a new utopia in the midst of a ruined world, populated in part by genetically modified humans who are incapable of strong human emotion, most notably the hatred, prejudice, and anger that led humanity to destroy the world in the first place. Set in the midst of this is the apparently missing-in-action-for-some-time famed female warrior Deunan Knute.Deunan Knute is many things. She's one of the best warriors on earth, descended from an equally brilliant warrior and (it will be revealed) a rather important scientist. She's the love interest for the now-mechanized Briarius who was presumed dead and is now more machine than human, and a protector of the new utopia. She is a fantastic protagonist, and a wonderfully strong and sensitive woman, managing to eschew the stereotypes that abound in some other types of anime.This is where we run into our rough edges that mar the movie. To wit, Deunan is never really allowed to reach her potential. A humorous scene where her ""training"" ends in the complete and surprising defeat of her numerous laser-tag opponents and a cute quip from her in the end is marred by Briarius' scolding that she shouldn't tease men who may save her life someday. This could work if the scene was meant to show that Briarius is conflicted about Deunan's arrival into his untroubled utopia, but the scene is played straight and Deunan silently vows to be more serious, to my own disappointment. Another drawback here is that the filmmakers do not seem to trust their underlying premise that Deunan is capable and tough - Briarius repeatedly saves her life throughout the film, often over her ridiculously protesting objections, and I cannot think of a single instance where she handles actual trouble without the protection of her imposing metal lover. This is a disappointment, for a character that is supposed to be strong, self-reliant, practical, and battle-hardened.The film also suffers from exposition issues. There are long stretches of exposition that, should have been arranged differently in order to allow the user to process the convoluted storyline. Exposition is hampered by skipping major plot points and returning to them in retrospect later, if at all - the wire fighting warriors that slice Hitomi's car in half are never explained with regards to who sent them. There are also simply too many coincidences and ""gee, that's convenient"" plot points, for instance when the multiple automated fighters are converging on the dome and we find that (a) they don't need to stop ALL the fighters, because there's a shut-down port on ONE of them that will shut them all down (convenient!) and (b) they are given the shut-down passcode by a previously comatose Hitomi who announces that her name is the passcode the elders chose to use. It's not really understand WHY she would know this - I can buy that the elders might use her name as the super-secret passcode because they are fond of her, but then they also TELL her the super-secret passcode? Very odd, and again a little too convenient.Having given all this criticism, I still highly recommend Appleseed as a solid four star movie. The story may be unpolished, but it is still far superior to most movies, anime or live-action alike. The character development and relationship exploration between Deunan and Briarius could have used a great deal of work, but I recognize that this went into the sequel and was handled very well, all things considered. And the movie also contains the most touching ""I remember now!"" amnesia scene that I have ever witnessed, with a climax that brought tears to my eyes.One more major gripe: This movie provides closed caption for the hearing impaired. But, and this is a big but, the captions *never* match the actual words being said by the voice actors. Literally, it was not at all uncommon for a caption and the voice text to share only the words ""a"", ""an"", and ""the"". I have to assume that the caption writers and the voice actors were working with different translations which yielded the same intent, but with vastly different words. If you are hard of hearing and you use the captions to follow along and pick up the words that you missed, the discontinuity between what you HEAR and what you SEE is incredibly jarring and annoying. If you are completely deaf, well, you won't be watching the same movie as your companions. There is really no excuse for such shoddy work, but I did not include this in my star rating as it will not apply to all viewers.~ Ana Mardoll",4,"Fascinating, Complex...but rough around the

Still, it holds up today as state-of-the-art and an amazing cinematic piece of work.  Anime fans should definitely add this one to their collection.First of all, let me say that as familar as I am with anime, I am by no means an expert on the subject.  I could compare this piece to some of the better known works out there (such as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, etc), but I prefer to examine this work as if from the outside, especially for those of you who are new to the genre or just starting out.  This film ranks up there with those two titles I previously mentioned, Akira and GitS.The film starts out with a bang, as rebels fight off robots in a war that doesn't even exist anymore.  Our heroine is whisked away to rejoin a lost friend and becomes embroiled in a plot to wrest control of the city away from a council of dying old men.  There is much intrigue and a good amount of action to follow, many plots twists, and some beautiful animation throughout.  I don't want to give away any spoilers or plot details, so I will merely say that the story is as catching as the animation.Overall, I gave this film 4 stars.  The only reason I held back on the fifth star was a slight letdown from the opening of the movie.  It begins with a spectacular action sequence, but after the catharsis of that scene, it is a while before the film picks up the pace again.

The animation is good--though as has been pointed out, not as good as FF: the Spirit Within, but what is?  The soundtrack supports the story, enhances the mood, and helps move the story along, which is basically what it should do.  (I was also pleasantly surprised to find many of the songs in English--and well-done.  If you're an anime fan, you know what I'm talking about.)There was precious little ""unique"" about the plot:  basic anime dystopia, techno-utopia, political machinations, with the resulting xenophobia, etc.  But it was *fun*.  (Hitomi got a little annoying, but no cast of characters pleases everyone.)  And I say this as (gasp!) someone who really didn't like the original manga.The reason this gets an extra star is due to the director/producer commentary.  The commentary itself is extremely technical--and rather boring.  However, during the commentary, I learned that ""Appleseed"" wasn't *meant* to be a rival for the animation quality of FF:the Spirit Within, or somehow project every fan's image/dream of the manga onto the big screen.  (FYI:  the creator of the original manga approved of the film and is said to be pleased with it.)They were trying for something new, to find that line between strict anime style storytelling, live-action, and/or just resting on the glory of their 3D cel animating success.  They were trying to make something *new*, which is always risky, and they did it with a series with a known cult following.  That takes guts.  That deserves some recognition.And frankly, this is hardly the worst way to spend 90 minutes.  It's entertaining, there's an understated but strong love story, and plenty of sci-fi style action.  It doesn't have the strongest plot, and it doesn't break any new ground in sheer *storytelling*.  It's not going to change your world-view, your college major, or make you love thy neighbor if you don't already.  But it's fun, with enough tension to keep it from being pure fluff.

A small zone of peace and civilization exists in Olympus, a city overseen by the supercomputer Gaia.  Balance is kept via the coexistence of humans and bioroids, artificial beings with suppressed emotions (who are thus less likely to lead to dissent and more war.)  But as it is human nature to fear other races, many fear a time when bioroids will control humans.  It is up to skilled warrior Deunan Knute to unlock the secret from her past that will prevent a new conflict from breaking out.This version of APPLESEED is entirely computer generated, to varying degrees of success.  The outdoor night scenes look spectacular, while day and indoor scenes look rather artificial.  At first I thought the human characters were hand drawn, but they too are rendered, though not as fully as those in 2001's FINAL FANTASY movie.  They appear flat and doll-like next to the scenery and mechanical constructs, with their hair curiously molded.  It might have been better if they had been done the old-fashioned way after all.The film is presented on DVD in three 5.1 soundtracks: English Dolby Digital, Japanese Dolby Digital, and Japanese DTS.  I'm not set up for DTS yet so I watched it with the second option, and it sounded fantastic.  This is a movie you'll want to show off your surround sound system with.Extras on the standard DVD edition include a director and producer commentary, previews for other Geneon releases, and staff biographies.  You can also jump directly to the musical sequences within the film; featured artists (with biographies) include Boom Boom Satellites, Paul Oakenfold, Ryuichi Sakamoto and others.  There is also an advert for the CD soundtrack, and DVD credits, but it's reaching a bit to call these extras.This film has been rated R by the MPAA which I think is harsh.  Except for a little bloody violence in the opening sequence, there's nothing in APPLESEED that wouldn't be appropriate for younger viewers, although the story may fly over their heads.  If you're going to watch it around kids, you might want to just jump past the first chapter.  Or not.Despite the ambitious nature of the production, I found it left me a bit cold overall.  This may be stating the obvious, since most of the characters we meet are artificial, but there is very little emotion or humanity in the story.  I didn't care much about any of them.  The story isn't very involving, and Deunan's ties with Olympus' origins felt contrived.  It's worth renting if you're a CG enthusiast, but I can't give this a strong recommendation otherwise.",3,A secret history,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2671,"['Based', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'Masamune', 'Shirow', 'APPLESEED', 'place', 'future', 'Earth', 'following', 'massive', 'world', 'war', 'small', 'zone', 'peace', 'civilization', 'exists', 'Olympus', 'city', 'overseen', 'supercomputer', 'Gaia', 'Balance', 'kept', 'coexistence', 'humans', 'bioroids', 'artificial', 'beings', 'suppressed', 'emotions', 'who', 'are', 'thus', 'less', 'likely', 'lead', 'dissent', 'more', 'war', 'human', 'nature', 'fear', 'other', 'races', 'many', 'fear', 'time', 'when', 'bioroids', 'will', 'control', 'humans', 'skilled', 'warrior', 'Deunan', 'Knute', 'unlock', 'secret', 'past', 'will', 'prevent', 'new', 'conflict', 'breaking', 'out.This', 'version', 'APPLESEED', 'entirely', 'computer', 'generated', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'outdoor', 'night', 'scenes', 'look', 'spectacular', 'day', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'look', 'rather', 'artificial', 'first', 'thought', 'human', 'characters', 'were', 'hand', 'drawn', 'too', 'are', 'rendered', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'fully', '2001', 'FINAL', 'FANTASY', 'movie', 'appear', 'flat', 'doll-like', 'next', 'scenery', 'mechanical', 'constructs', 'hair', 'curiously', 'molded', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'old-fashioned', 'way', 'all.The', 'film', 'presented', 'DVD', 'three', '5.1', 'soundtracks', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Japanese', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Japanese', 'DTS', ""'m"", 'not', 'set', 'up', 'DTS', 'yet', 'so', 'watched', 'second', 'option', 'sounded', 'fantastic', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'show', 'off', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'with.Extras', 'standard', 'DVD', 'edition', 'include', 'director', 'producer', 'commentary', 'previews', 'other', 'Geneon', 'releases', 'staff', 'biographies', 'can', 'also', 'jump', 'directly', 'musical', 'sequences', 'film', 'featured', 'artists', 'biographies', 'include', 'Boom', 'Boom', 'Satellites', 'Paul', 'Oakenfold', 'Ryuichi', 'Sakamoto', 'others', 'also', 'advert', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'DVD', 'credits', 'reaching', 'bit', 'call', 'extras.This', 'film', 'been', 'rated', 'R', 'MPAA', 'think', 'harsh', 'little', 'bloody', 'violence', 'opening', 'sequence', 'nothing', 'APPLESEED', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'appropriate', 'younger', 'viewers', 'story', 'may', 'fly', 'heads', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'around', 'kids', 'might', 'want', 'just', 'jump', 'first', 'chapter', 'ambitious', 'nature', 'production', 'found', 'left', 'bit', 'cold', 'overall', 'may', 'be', 'stating', 'obvious', 'most', 'characters', 'meet', 'are', 'artificial', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'humanity', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'involving', 'Deunan', 'ties', 'Olympus', 'origins', 'felt', 'contrived', 'worth', 'renting', ""'re"", 'CG', 'enthusiast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'otherwise']",Appleseed

I was walking into a Japantown store when I noticed that they were showing this movie.  Well for those wondering, they have everything there since the DVDs are direct imports from Japan in region 2.  But anyway, I decided to watch it a bit.  I loved how they dipict the robots to be larger than even Godzilla.

885141,A1HFD1S7QM8RHN,B0007OY31G,"Damon B. ""Teen Film Critic""","[5, 8]","Appleseed, based upon a manga by legendary mangaka Shirow Masamune, is the latest of feature-length Japanese anime movies to be released in movie theaters across the U.S. Those of us here in North America must generally find our needs in regards to the anime market satiated through DVDs or less-than-legal downloads off of the internet, and thus it is a cause for celebration when news hits that such a movie is to hit mainstream movie theaters. Suffice it to say, if our hopes are to be excited in such a way, the movie itself must deliver. Unfortunately, Appleseed manages to disappoint in nearly all facets it attempts to conquer. A strained story tries to be deep yet ends up swimming in the kiddie pool, promising 3D visuals end up comparing more to Reboot, an aged show that used to play on Cartoon Network, than Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence.In fact, from a visual standpoint, Appleseed has absolutely no excuse to fall flat. We've seen far better from previous films from Japan, some a few years old, yet it trips up on so many of its tangled wires. Some jagged, unpolished visuals would find themselves more at home as a PS2 cutscene than as a bigscreen feature film. Ironically, a recent PS2 game, Armored Core Nexus, has an intro sequence that features mechs that actually looks eons better than anything this movie presents. This is by no means an exaggeration. There are several sequences in the movie with grainy edges when there is no seemingly no excusable reason to have crisp, fine-tuned edges. In fact, during a dramatic scene in the movie, one can't help but notice slight texture slip-ups on regions of an outheld gun. And this is just the surface: the character models are clearly anime-inspired, and while they look plenty appealing when stationary, they begin to rip apart at the seams with movement. When talking, their mouths articulate about as well as a G.I.Joe being manipulated by a little kid. This clearly takes away from practically every dramatic shot in the entire movie, as your attention is focused away from the bland lines the characters are spouting and more towards their rubbery movements.The story supplementing these poor visuals follows suit. It's typical anime science-fiction drivel that can't compare to the greats. Its a story of a feud between humans and a new, peaceful race known as the Bio-roids contained within a new utopic city known as Olympus. While it certainly struggles with some deeper symbolism, particularly centered around Greek mythology, there's a surprising lack of substance to be had. You can't sympatheize with any of the characters, especially when they move about as gracefully as a Barbie, and in the end the plot is just a bit too distant to lend any sort of meaning to today's society.Stilted plot, bland characters, and mediocre visuals should be manageable so long as the action is entertaining. In that regard, Appleseed succeeds to a slight degree. There are a couple of action sequences that are simply bursting with energy, mostly the ones involving Mechs. Yet these sequences are really nothing special, especially when your lust for action is better fulfilled in several other mediums. The action isn't always a high-point, however, especially when it combines with the films other flaws. The climax of the movie is immensely dissapointing, with a premise so utterly overdone that you may find yourself in disbelief that the movie is actually presenting it and seriously at that. Oh, but it is.Suffice it to say, Appleseed should not be at the top of any moviegoers list. Particularly not that of anime fans, who have probably seen this exact premise thousands of times over. It may be suitable as a rental for the scant action sequences, but you'd be better off foregoing this in light of something more stellar, such as Ghost in the Shell 2 or Metropolis.",3,Mediocrity incarnate,1125273600,"08 29, 2005",2005,3844,"['Appleseed', 'based', 'manga', 'legendary', 'mangaka', 'Shirow', 'Masamune', 'latest', 'feature-length', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'movies', 'be', 'released', 'movie', 'theaters', 'U.S.', 'here', 'North', 'America', 'must', 'generally', 'find', 'needs', 'regards', 'anime', 'market', 'satiated', 'DVDs', 'less-than-legal', 'downloads', 'internet', 'thus', 'cause', 'celebration', 'when', 'news', 'movie', 'hit', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Suffice', 'say', 'hopes', 'are', 'be', 'excited', 'such', 'way', 'movie', 'must', 'deliver', 'Unfortunately', 'Appleseed', 'disappoint', 'nearly', 'facets', 'conquer', 'strained', 'story', 'tries', 'be', 'deep', 'yet', 'up', 'swimming', 'kiddie', 'pool', 'promising', '3D', 'visuals', 'end', 'up', 'comparing', 'more', 'Reboot', 'aged', 'show', 'used', 'play', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'Ghost', 'Shell', '2', 'Innocence.In', 'fact', 'visual', 'standpoint', 'Appleseed', 'absolutely', 'excuse', 'fall', 'flat', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'better', 'previous', 'films', 'Japan', 'few', 'years', 'old', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'tangled', 'wires', 'jagged', 'unpolished', 'visuals', 'would', 'find', 'more', 'home', 'PS2', 'cutscene', 'bigscreen', 'feature', 'film', 'Ironically', 'recent', 'PS2', 'game', 'Armored', 'Core', 'Nexus', 'intro', 'sequence', 'mechs', 'actually', 'eons', 'better', 'anything', 'movie', 'means', 'exaggeration', 'are', 'several', 'sequences', 'movie', 'grainy', 'edges', 'when', 'seemingly', 'excusable', 'reason', 'have', 'crisp', 'fine-tuned', 'edges', 'fact', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'slight', 'texture', 'slip-ups', 'regions', 'outheld', 'gun', 'just', 'surface', 'character', 'models', 'are', 'clearly', 'anime-inspired', 'look', 'plenty', 'appealing', 'when', 'stationary', 'begin', 'rip', 'apart', 'seams', 'movement', 'When', 'talking', 'mouths', 'articulate', 'as', 'well', 'G.I.Joe', 'being', 'manipulated', 'little', 'kid', 'clearly', 'away', 'practically', 'dramatic', 'shot', 'entire', 'movie', 'attention', 'focused', 'away', 'bland', 'lines', 'characters', 'are', 'spouting', 'more', 'towards', 'rubbery', 'movements.The', 'story', 'supplementing', 'poor', 'visuals', 'suit', 'typical', 'anime', 'science-fiction', 'drivel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'greats', 'story', 'feud', 'humans', 'new', 'peaceful', 'race', 'known', 'Bio-roids', 'contained', 'new', 'utopic', 'city', 'known', 'Olympus', 'certainly', 'deeper', 'symbolism', 'particularly', 'centered', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'surprising', 'lack', 'substance', 'be', 'had', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sympatheize', 'characters', 'especially', 'when', 'move', 'as', 'gracefully', 'Barbie', 'end', 'plot', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'distant', 'lend', 'sort', 'meaning', 'today', 'society.Stilted', 'plot', 'bland', 'characters', 'mediocre', 'visuals', 'should', 'be', 'manageable', 'so', 'long', 'action', 'entertaining', 'regard', 'Appleseed', 'slight', 'degree', 'are', 'couple', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'simply', 'bursting', 'energy', 'mostly', 'ones', 'involving', 'Mechs', 'sequences', 'are', 'really', 'nothing', 'special', 'especially', 'when', 'lust', 'action', 'better', 'fulfilled', 'several', 'other', 'mediums', 'action', ""n't"", 'always', 'high-point', 'however', 'especially', 'when', 'films', 'other', 'flaws', 'climax', 'movie', 'immensely', 'dissapointing', 'premise', 'so', 'utterly', 'overdone', 'may', 'find', 'disbelief', 'movie', 'actually', 'presenting', 'seriously', 'Oh', 'say', 'Appleseed', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'top', 'moviegoers', 'list', 'Particularly', 'not', 'anime', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', 'exact', 'premise', 'thousands', 'times', 'may', 'be', 'suitable', 'rental', 'scant', 'action', 'sequences', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'foregoing', 'light', 'something', 'more', 'stellar', 'such', 'Ghost', 'Shell', '2', 'Metropolis']",Appleseed

The animation is of good quality, but I'm only lukewarm on the style.  Visually, the scenes are complicated and intense, with the characters as the calmist things in many scenes.  Normally I'd find this very distracting, but this movie pulls it off pretty well.Good action animation with a first rate story.E. M.

885152,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B0007OY31G,General Breadbasket,"[0, 1]","I don't know anime, but I know what I like. As for CGI anime, which ""Appleseed"" is, I wouldn't have a clue. Amazon recommended this pretty high on its lists for me, so I decided to check it out. It was a fairly entertaining piece of sci-fi I thought.The film is set in the future, after a significant global war. Deunan Knute was one of the best soldiers in this war, and she has been fighting for quite some time. Little does she know the war ended, and the soldiers and robots she's been fighting have come from the city of Olympus, who wish to capture and recruit Deunan as part of their defense force. They eventually do, and Deunan is taken to a city very different from the rust and ruin the rest of the world has falled into. Olympus is green with parkland and trees, shining with metaliic skyscrapers, a bustling utopia of flying cars and happy families. Such a place exists thanks to the creation of a race of people known as Bioroids, a type of human clone that have had their life span reduced, their emotions supressed and their reproductive systems neutralized. Though they are kind and generous beings, they apparently feel no true love, thanks to the genetic repressions. They also feel no hate, so they never start wars or fight one another. They live together with humans, and in theory are supposed to keep each other in check.  Still, not everyone in Olympus is happy with the system. General Uranus, and his accomplice Hades despise the Bioroids, and want them wiped out. Acts of terror soon befall the city, and Deunan is caught up in a web of intrigue, memories, politics and science, all leading to the hunt for something the powers-that-be refer to as ""Appleseed"". But what is Appleseed? Will it put things right? Were things ever right to begin with?I've seen this CGI style of anime around the place, and I'm not exactly the biggest fan of it. It's a little too crisp, a little too clear and calculated, and it cheapens things just a little. Still, ""Appelseed"" is probably my favorite film in this medium so far. There's a lot to think about, and a lot of references to Greek mythology in and around the city of Olympus (the powerful figures are named after Greek gods, etc). Even though it doesn't hint too strongly at it I kind of got the feeling that in the world of Appleseed, time and events are circular, the creation of a new race of beings, squabbles among the creative race, etc. In the film, Deunan has a hope, that their children will be able to sort things out, that they can forge a new destiny, but I can't help doubting that a fair bit, considering how their natures are structured. Ah well.Special features (on the two disc version I have my hands on) include an audio commentary with the director and producer, original theatrical trailer, a music video for the Boom Boom Satellites song ""Dive For You"", an image gallery, and a making of documentary (in Japanese with English subtitles).Worth a look for anime fans, I suppose, though I still prefer the more traditional kind.",4,The New Olympus?,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,3018,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anime', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'CGI', 'anime', 'Appleseed', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'Amazon', 'recommended', 'pretty', 'high', 'lists', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'piece', 'sci-fi', 'thought.The', 'film', 'set', 'future', 'significant', 'global', 'war', 'Deunan', 'Knute', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'soldiers', 'war', 'been', 'fighting', 'quite', 'time', 'Little', 'know', 'war', 'ended', 'soldiers', 'robots', 'been', 'fighting', 'have', 'come', 'city', 'Olympus', 'who', 'wish', 'capture', 'recruit', 'Deunan', 'part', 'defense', 'force', 'eventually', 'do', 'Deunan', 'taken', 'city', 'very', 'different', 'rust', 'ruin', 'rest', 'world', 'falled', 'Olympus', 'green', 'parkland', 'trees', 'shining', 'metaliic', 'skyscrapers', 'bustling', 'utopia', 'flying', 'cars', 'happy', 'families', 'place', 'thanks', 'creation', 'race', 'people', 'known', 'Bioroids', 'type', 'human', 'clone', 'have', 'had', 'life', 'span', 'reduced', 'emotions', 'supressed', 'reproductive', 'systems', 'neutralized', 'are', 'kind', 'generous', 'beings', 'apparently', 'feel', 'true', 'love', 'thanks', 'genetic', 'repressions', 'also', 'feel', 'hate', 'never', 'start', 'wars', 'fight', 'one', 'live', 'together', 'humans', 'theory', 'are', 'supposed', 'keep', 'other', 'check', 'Still', 'not', 'everyone', 'Olympus', 'happy', 'system', 'General', 'Uranus', 'accomplice', 'Hades', 'despise', 'Bioroids', 'want', 'wiped', 'out', 'Acts', 'terror', 'soon', 'befall', 'city', 'Deunan', 'caught', 'up', 'web', 'intrigue', 'memories', 'politics', 'science', 'leading', 'hunt', 'something', 'powers-that-be', 'refer', 'Appleseed', 'what', 'Appleseed', 'Will', 'put', 'things', 'right', 'Were', 'things', 'ever', 'right', 'begin', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'CGI', 'style', 'anime', 'place', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'biggest', 'fan', 'little', 'too', 'crisp', 'little', 'too', 'clear', 'calculated', 'things', 'just', 'little', 'Still', 'Appelseed', 'probably', 'favorite', 'film', 'medium', 'so', 'far', 'lot', 'think', 'lot', 'references', 'Greek', 'mythology', 'city', 'Olympus', 'powerful', 'figures', 'are', 'named', 'Greek', 'gods', 'etc', 'Even', ""n't"", 'hint', 'too', 'strongly', 'kind', 'got', 'feeling', 'world', 'Appleseed', 'time', 'events', 'are', 'circular', 'creation', 'new', 'race', 'beings', 'squabbles', 'creative', 'race', 'etc', 'film', 'Deunan', 'hope', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'sort', 'things', 'out', 'can', 'forge', 'new', 'destiny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'doubting', 'fair', 'bit', 'considering', 'how', 'natures', 'are', 'structured', 'Ah', 'well.Special', 'features', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'have', 'hands', 'include', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'producer', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'music', 'video', 'Boom', 'Boom', 'song', 'Dive', 'image', 'gallery', 'making', 'documentary', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', '.Worth', 'look', 'anime', 'fans', 'suppose', 'still', 'prefer', 'more', 'traditional', 'kind']",Appleseed

885156,AM4UVNWCW9NJE,B0007OY31G,iansomniak,"[2, 2]","Though it has nothing to do with apples, Appleseed is a shiny, crisply animated film that tastefully combines traditional cell-shaded animation with juicy 3-dimensional computer graphics. As the story begins, we find the legendary camouflage-clad warrior babe, Deunan Knute, armed only with a handgun and fighting for her life against a gang of crimson-eyed fiends and an unstoppable Gatling Tank amid the dusty, blue-tinged rubble of some post-apocalyptic wasteland.  After a few very impressive slow-motion backflips and karate kicks choreographed to the rhythmic beats of Paul Oakenfold's `Burns Attack,' our fern-haired heroine is surrounded and ultimately captured by members of ES.W.A.T. and whisked away in the Tilt Rotor--an aircraft that's a cross between a plane and a helicopter.  When the tranquilizer rounds finally wear off, Deunan opens her big green eyes to find herself in a sparkling utopia called Olympus.  Here she meets the lovely ES.W.A.T. recruiter, Hitomi, and a hulking steel-headed cyborg dude with five red eyes where his face should be and a pair of metal rabbit ears atop his chrome-plated cranium.  Deunan soon discovers, much to her initial horror, that this faceless giant is not merely the Easter Bunny's worst nightmare; he is none other than her old boyfriend, Briareos Hecatonchires!  It seems that a year or so ago, the once-handsome Briareos required some cybernetic replacement parts after his body was badly damaged in a battle on the North African front...but inside he's still the same good-hearted guy he's always been (plus, he undoubtedly gets excellent TV reception).The next morning, Hitomi takes Deunan for a spin around the futuristic city in her glistening raspberry-pink hover-car.  As they observe Olympus's crystal-clear skies, picturesque parks, mirrored streets and deliriously happy residents, the raven-haired tour guide endeavors to explain the complicated facts of life in this supposed utopia.The two gigantic, highly-reflective, dome-shaped structures that dominate the cityscape are called Tartaros and Daidalos.  Inside these unusual buildings is the enormous I.N. (Intelligent Network) brain, commonly known as Gaia.  Gaia is a self-expanding network that monitors interactions between humankind and the Bioroids that make up half of the city's population.  Bioroids are an advanced species of clones, manufactured with the highest quality components.  Unlike ordinary human beings, whose unstable emotions often lead to war, Bioroids do not feel anger, jealousy or hatred.  Whether or not they can feel love is open to debate.  Hitomi says they can't, but Yoshi the blue-haired Landmate mechanic later says they can.  One thing's certain though, Bioroids cannot have children, as their reproductive systems are inactive.  Therefore, they must undergo a periodic life extension process or they will age rapidly and die.The governing body of Olympus, called the Administration, is exclusively Bioroid.  It is overseen by the slightly wrinkled Prime Minister Athena, redheaded commander-in-chief of the ES.W.A.T. force.  Athena and the Bioroids are the facilitators of balance and peace in Olympian society.  Peaceful coexistence between Man and Bioroid is believed to be the last remaining hope for the survival of the human species.  However, this peace is threatened by the Bioroid-hating extremist, General Uranus (he must've been teased relentlessly as a child), commander of the so-called Regular Army--an army comprised entirely of human beings.The ultimate authority in this shimmering dream world of alleged perfection is, of course, the Legislature, which is run by the Seven Elders (a group of crusty old gentlemen who apparently never leave their floating chairs), along with the aforementioned Gaia.  The rule of Olympus is decided by debate between these seven seniors and the big blue bubble-like computer, Gaia--a stable, unwavering, emotionless machine with no capacity for sentiment.  The Elders' aged human minds give Gaia's thinking a much-needed measure of flexibility (and probably an appreciation for Big Band music as well).Looming over all of Olympus, at the top of Tartaros, is the ominous D-Tank.  It is widely believed that this tank holds a dreadful virus that, if ever released, would wipe out all Bioroid existence.  Thankfully, the manufactured Olympian citizens can rest easy knowing that the D-Tank is guarded by the ultimate system in high-tech security.  ...Does all of this sound like a recipe for disaster to you?Complex plot aside, Appleseed is a spectacularly beautiful CG extravaganza with enough eye candy to give your corneas cavities.  The movie contains a number of thrilling action sequences featuring lightning-fast suits of gleaming robotic armor; silvery whip-swinging androids; lumbering spider-like Mobile Fortresses; blazing machineguns; and earth-rattling explosions.  And the visual mayhem is all set to pounding electronic anthems by groups like Boom Boom Satellites and Basement Jaxx.The Collector's Edition comes in a nifty metal case and includes a bonus disc, loaded with extras like design archives; image galleries; character and mecha info; and a fascinating English-subtitled featurette on the `Birth of 3D Live Anime.'  Appleseed contains a few violent death scenes, but there's no sex and very little in the way of bad language (unlike the old2-D version).  No fan of animation, computer-generated or otherwise, should be without this landmark film.

And there are some Android who hate humans and wish them to all die out. And finally, there is a big computer who runs everything.Nothing there you haven't seen before huh? It also takes a while to build up momentum. Though when it does, the plot twists and turns and action scenes are truly exhilarating. The animation quality is breath-taking with seamless blending of hand-drawn, motion capture, CGI and 3D images. Style and plot-wise it is very, very similar to Sky Blue/Wonderful Days. But since they were in production at the same time one cannot accuse the other of plagiarism.The sheer amount of technology and hardware in the movie will make you drool. There are loads of cool devices, futuristic inventions and awesome weaponry. There is also loads of atmosphere with gorgeous, gorgeous sunsets, storm-lashed oil rigs and wonderfully blue-sky-ed cityscapes with an environmentally friendly amount of trees everywhere.The Matrix 'inspired' action can be a bit annoying sometimes. We've seen people diving through the air in slow motion will taking out supposedly highly-trained soldiers? And the music is kinda uninspiring. With contributions from Basement Jaxx and Paul Oakenfold one expected it to be a lot better.When you take the good with the bad, Appleseed still comes out as worthwhile and enjoyable. If your new to Anime then you can forgive the clich?s, if your a big fan then you'll be awe-struck by the impressive production values.The DVD boasts a stunning 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer and a brilliant DTS 5.1 sound design.

885160,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,B0007OY31G,James Duckett,"[2, 8]","The story in this is not the best, but it is better than most of the trash the Hollywood puts out now-a-days.  There were parts that I felt a little bit lost (and that is pretty rare) but everything cleared up by the end.  There really is nothing ground breaking in either the story telling or science fiction technology.  However, in the end, I did find this quite entertaining and action-packed.However, what blew my mind away was the computer graphics!!  There were three things that really did fantastically well... pretty much ground-breaking.  Though none of them were perfect, they are some of the best I've seen in animation.1)  The buildings and the cities.  They looked really, really close to being real.  They weren't perfect as I was still easily reminded that I was watching a cartoon, but I haven't seen anything this close before.  The randomness of what was happening on the streets (a good variety of cars fills the streets) and the shapes of the buildings is what you would expect to find if you were looking at any large city from above.  It was really done well.2)  The people, especially their movement.  The biggest problem I had with them was their heads.  Their eyes are too big and colorful.  They are either too blue, too green, or even too ??red??.  And the hair was very clumpy as if everybody on earth only had about fifty strands of really, really thick hair.  It was too easy to remember that this was an animation I was watching whenever humanoids were on the screen.Three years ago a movie called Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within was released that nailed what I would consider perfection when it comes to facial looks and hair.  Especially the hair.So what did I like?  The motion of their bodies!  They were very, very fluid and looked very life-like.  They ran like humans, they walked like humans... they all looked very, very lifelike.  Except their heads, of course.  There is even a scene were Duenan (the story's protagonist) is hanging from something and swings her body up to get on top.  Very, very lifelike.  The motion of the bodies is fantastic and I've never seen it done this well before.Now if they would only work with the producers of Final Fantasy to perfect the heads.  Okay, enough on that.3)  The water.  Water was done well once again.  There was one time, when looking at a stormy sea of water, where I had to rewind it.  It didn't look like an animation; it looked like it was actually filmed.  I had to look very close to catch the small little imperfection and lack of randomness in order to convince myself that it wasn't filmed.  The only time water was off was when they came from the eyes of somebody crying (mostly Duenan) or tearing up.  That didn't come across convincingly whether it was swelling up in her eyes, dripping down her face, or splashing on the floor.  I haven't seen so many tears since Alice in Wonderland.If you like action, even if you don't like cartoons, pick this up.  It has plenty of it.  If you like Sci-fi then I can't think of any reason to skip this movie.  If you like Anime then this is one I doubt you'll want to miss.If you don't fit in any categories then forget it, I can't think of anybody else who would want to see it.  I must say, this isn't for the weak of heart (i.e. small children), there really is a lot of action and violence.",4,Decent Story.

885165,A2GVJ83F092MIS,B0007OY31G,J. Hayes,"[16, 20]","Appleseed recieved a ton of hype prior to its DVD release, and for good reason. Using a new technique called 3D live action CG, the original story has been given an amazing upgrade. The story involves Deunan Knute, a beautiful but deadly soldier, who after World War III is taken to the city of Olympus (which is supposed to be a Utopia). In this city, humans coexist with the Bioroids, an advanced human clone form whose purpose is to make human existence more peaceful. When the balance of this relationship is threatened, Deunan and Briareos are the only hope to save the city of Olympus (from what I wont say). I can say that this movie is action-packed throughout, and there was never a slow moment to me. Another reviewer said that this was not a deep philosophical anime like Akira or Ghost in the Shell, and that is true. But who needs that when you have something that is so visually impressive? One complaint is that the story is too rushed. I thought it was excellent, and it has been said that a sequel is in the works. But anyway, the bottom line is that this is the most impressive CG feature I have ever seen. The characters are very easy to relate to, the action will surely please any fan that wants action in an anime, and the soundtrack in the movie is awesome.So I bought the two-disc version in the LE tin. If you have more money the Briareos figure is a very cool thing to have. As far as the tin goes, it is high quality featuring great artwork from the movie. It is not metal like some others I have bought, and it is hard to explain. Very nice though and a must for anime fans and collectors.There are some great extras in this loaded set compared to other anime movie releases (most come with little or no insight into the making of the film). On disk 1 is the feature film in English or Japanese. There are also previews for other Geneon releases (Samurai Champloo, Paranoia Agent, Fafner and a couple of others). Disk 2 has some pretty great extras as well. There is a behind the scenes featurette with several of the people behind the movie to start out, and it gives their opinions on Appleseed and the pros of this new animated style. It is interesting if you like that sort of thing on DVDs. There is also a concept art gallery as well as image gallery with most of the characters from the movie. Next there are 2 Japanese trailers from the thearical release of Appleseed as well as 1 U.S. trailer. ""Appleseed Info"" fills you in on some of the names throughout the movie and what they are, such as ""Gaia"", as well as character bios. Add to this a commentary track from both the director and producer, and it makes for one excellent anime DVD.Overall this is now my favorite anime feature film (and I have seen several). The story was great and easy to understand. The action sequences with Deunan and Briareos are awesome. The songs from the movie are perfectly suited to the scene which adds to its greatness. I believe a lot of people may share my opinion upon first viewing this, but it may not appeal to everybody. Best anime movie ever? That is for you to decide. At least give it a shot, and if you become a fan then this 2 disc version is the one to own.",5,Visually amazing anime thriller--an instant classic!,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,3193,"['Appleseed', 'recieved', 'ton', 'hype', 'prior', 'DVD', 'release', 'good', 'reason', 'Using', 'new', 'technique', 'called', '3D', 'live', 'action', 'CG', 'original', 'story', 'been', 'given', 'amazing', 'upgrade', 'story', 'Deunan', 'Knute', 'beautiful', 'deadly', 'soldier', 'who', 'World', 'War', 'III', 'taken', 'city', 'Olympus', 'supposed', 'be', 'Utopia', 'city', 'humans', 'coexist', 'Bioroids', 'advanced', 'human', 'clone', 'form', 'purpose', 'make', 'human', 'existence', 'more', 'peaceful', 'When', 'balance', 'relationship', 'threatened', 'Deunan', 'Briareos', 'are', 'only', 'hope', 'save', 'city', 'Olympus', 'what', 'wont', 'say', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'action-packed', 'was', 'never', 'slow', 'moment', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'not', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'anime', 'Akira', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'true', 'who', 'when', 'have', 'something', 'so', 'visually', 'impressive', 'One', 'complaint', 'story', 'too', 'rushed', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'been', 'said', 'sequel', 'works', 'anyway', 'bottom', 'line', 'most', 'impressive', 'CG', 'feature', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'relate', 'action', 'will', 'surely', 'please', 'fan', 'action', 'anime', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'awesome.So', 'bought', 'two-disc', 'version', 'LE', 'tin', 'have', 'more', 'money', 'Briareos', 'figure', 'very', 'cool', 'thing', 'have', 'As', 'far', 'tin', 'high', 'quality', 'featuring', 'great', 'artwork', 'movie', 'not', 'metal', 'others', 'have', 'bought', 'hard', 'explain', 'Very', 'nice', 'though', 'must', 'anime', 'fans', 'collectors.There', 'are', 'great', 'extras', 'loaded', 'set', 'compared', 'other', 'anime', 'movie', 'releases', 'most', 'come', 'little', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'disk', '1', 'feature', 'film', 'English', 'Japanese', 'are', 'also', 'previews', 'other', 'Geneon', 'releases', 'Samurai', 'Champloo', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'Fafner', 'couple', 'others', '2', 'pretty', 'great', 'extras', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'several', 'people', 'movie', 'start', 'out', 'opinions', 'Appleseed', 'pros', 'new', 'animated', 'style', 'interesting', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'DVDs', 'also', 'concept', 'art', 'gallery', 'as', 'well', 'image', 'gallery', 'most', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', '2', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'thearical', 'release', 'Appleseed', 'as', 'well', '1', 'U.S.', 'trailer', 'Appleseed', 'Info', 'names', 'movie', 'what', 'are', 'such', 'Gaia', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'bios', 'Add', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'producer', 'one', 'excellent', 'anime', 'DVD.Overall', 'now', 'favorite', 'anime', 'feature', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'easy', 'understand', 'action', 'sequences', 'Deunan', 'Briareos', 'are', 'awesome', 'songs', 'movie', 'are', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'scene', 'greatness', 'believe', 'lot', 'people', 'may', 'share', 'opinion', 'first', 'viewing', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'everybody', 'Best', 'anime', 'movie', 'ever', 'decide', 'least', 'give', 'shot', 'become', 'fan', 'then', '2', 'disc', 'version', 'one', 'own']",Appleseed

First off, I love the music and it does a great job capturing the future because of the electronic beats.  The graphics are stunning, but I feel as if I'm watching a CGI clip from a videogame.  The characters move in an unnatural sort of way even though their motions are fluid.  The plot is okay and I think they could have expanded further on the conflict between bioroids and humans instead of focusing on the heroine.  The action was excellent and the sound balancing of the explosions/music/speech was out of whack.  The sound effects are usually too quiet while the music and chatter is a bit loud.

885171,A3WIOO9L0DNGZ,B0007OY31G,Kevin Major,"[4, 5]","Appleseed is an enjoyable, if ultimately cliche and hollow, anime film.The story centers around Deunan Knute, a soldier who is whisked away by a Bioroid (genetically engineered humanoid) named Hitomi to the utopian city of Olympus as part of a rather stereotypical anime political controversy.  Awaiting her in the city is Briareos, her former comrade and lover who, after nearly getting killed himself, is a cyborg, much more machine than man.While I won't spoil any of the major plot points in this review, I will state that this film had the potential to be more than just an action flick.  There were many questions raised in the film (the ethics of genetic engineering, where the line between humanity and machine blurs, the humanitarian price of keeping such a utopia whole, etc), but, unfortunately, none were answered.  Instead of fleshing out the philosophical quandries that were an essential aspect of the film's background, the plot focused on action.  While the action scenes were enjoyable to watch (more on this in a moment), most didn't really feel integral to the film's story.The film is entirely rendered in CG.  While I enjoyed the look and feel of the film, it is largely a matter of taste, so your mileage may vary.  Let me say, though, that, to this date, I haven't seen an anime film that has felt so alive.  Between the realism of the background sets (especially the water effects), and the motion captured actors, the film, by and large, feels almost lifelike.  The mechs do look a bit squat, but that gives them a certain weight.  Perhaps the most glaring flaw is that of the characters' faces, but even that's a slight quibble compared to what the film does right visually.The action scenes themselves were pretty cliche.  There were Matrix-esque slow motion bits, and even a ""do something at a control panel before time runs out"" bit.  The opening scene felt like an homage to the ending of Ghost in the Shell, especially when the tanks showed up.  Given this film's background, that sort of tipping of the cap was a welcome addition.Emotionally, the film is a bit flat.  There's a bit of psychobabble (repressed memories and the like) which serves as the catalyst for our heroine's emotional revival, and there's a 'death' scene that serves no apparent purpose.  The rest is all paint-by-numbers.  By the end of the film, my feelings towards the characters were neutral at best.The majority of the music was done by the Boom Boom Satellites.  Think Matrix/Blade techno and you'll be on the right track.In the end, Appleseed is the equivalent of a good popcorn flick.  There's the potential for something much greater lying just underneath the surface, but none of that potential is ever reached.  Instead, we're left with a stylish, flashy, action-packed film.  There's nothing wrong with that, but I can't help but feel that the story of Appleseed would be better served in a series where the characters and plot could be fleshed out over several episodes.  110 minutes (give or take) just isn't enough time to deliver on the film's premise.",3,"Enjoyable, but misses the mark",1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,3072,"['Appleseed', 'enjoyable', 'ultimately', 'cliche', 'hollow', 'anime', 'film.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Deunan', 'Knute', 'soldier', 'who', 'whisked', 'away', 'Bioroid', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'humanoid', 'named', 'Hitomi', 'utopian', 'city', 'Olympus', 'part', 'rather', 'stereotypical', 'anime', 'political', 'controversy', 'Awaiting', 'city', 'Briareos', 'former', 'comrade', 'lover', 'who', 'nearly', 'getting', 'killed', 'cyborg', 'much', 'more', 'machine', 'man.While', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'review', 'will', 'state', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'action', 'flick', 'were', 'many', 'questions', 'raised', 'film', 'ethics', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'where', 'line', 'humanity', 'machine', 'blurs', 'humanitarian', 'price', 'keeping', 'such', 'utopia', 'whole', 'etc', 'unfortunately', 'none', 'were', 'answered', 'Instead', 'fleshing', 'out', 'philosophical', 'quandries', 'were', 'essential', 'aspect', 'film', 'background', 'plot', 'focused', 'action', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'more', 'moment', 'most', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'integral', 'film', 'story.The', 'film', 'entirely', 'rendered', 'CG', 'enjoyed', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'largely', 'matter', 'taste', 'mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'Let', 'say', 'though', 'date', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anime', 'film', 'felt', 'so', 'alive', 'realism', 'background', 'especially', 'water', 'effects', 'motion', 'captured', 'actors', 'film', 'large', 'feels', 'almost', 'mechs', 'do', 'look', 'bit', 'squat', 'certain', 'weight', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'characters', 'even', 'slight', 'quibble', 'compared', 'what', 'film', 'right', 'visually.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'pretty', 'cliche', 'were', 'Matrix-esque', 'slow', 'motion', 'bits', 'even', 'do', 'something', 'control', 'panel', 'time', 'out', 'bit', 'opening', 'scene', 'felt', 'homage', 'ending', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'especially', 'when', 'tanks', 'showed', 'up', 'Given', 'film', 'background', 'sort', 'tipping', 'cap', 'was', 'welcome', 'addition.Emotionally', 'film', 'bit', 'flat', 'bit', 'psychobabble', 'repressed', 'memories', 'like', 'catalyst', 'heroine', 'emotional', 'revival', ""'death"", 'scene', 'apparent', 'purpose', 'rest', 'paint-by-numbers', 'end', 'film', 'feelings', 'characters', 'were', 'neutral', 'best.The', 'majority', 'music', 'was', 'done', 'Boom', 'Boom', 'Satellites', 'Think', 'Matrix/Blade', 'techno', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'track.In', 'end', 'Appleseed', 'equivalent', 'good', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'potential', 'something', 'much', 'greater', 'lying', 'just', 'surface', 'none', 'potential', 'ever', 'reached', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'left', 'stylish', 'flashy', 'action-packed', 'film', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'story', 'Appleseed', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'series', 'where', 'characters', 'plot', 'could', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'several', 'episodes', '110', 'minutes', 'give', 'take', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'deliver', 'film', 'premise']",Appleseed

This set a standard for CGI that may very well never be equaled without a significant technology breakthrough.  Another notable film of the period was the original Ghost in the Shell, had outstanding animation.  Appleseed has much in common with both films.  It shares the heavy use of CGI, and some interesting bits of underlying philosophy with Final Fantasy.  And, like Ghost, it was created from a manga series from Masamune Shirow.  If you're familiar with Ghost in the Shell you may very well see the world of Appleseed as that post-apocalyptic version of Ghost's, which was already unraveling.Here the world is mostly ruined, other than a small colony composed of humans and bioroids - androids whose primary function seems to be to balance humanity's tendency to self-destruct.  They are indistinguishable from humans other than that they lack the ability to breed, and cannot feel anger.  Yet all this is apparently to no avail.  With no outer war to distract them mankind has opted for inner violence, and Olympus is torn by human fear of the bioroids.Into this comes Deunan Knute, a deadly woman warrior who is the daughter of a woman who helped create the first bioroids, and, in the company of Briarius, and old lover who has become more machine than human, Deunan is Olympus's hope for the future.  Buried within her mind is the key that will complete the bioroids, and give them the capability to love and have children.  The events trigger an Armageddon like confrontation.The story is almost successful, despite it's somewhat simplistic characterization.  Director Shinji Arimaki fails to provide some needed continuity, though.  The result is that important things happen off-stage and there are too many unexplained switches in the plot.  Arimaki has seized the primary theme of human anger, suspicion and xenophobia, thrown in a lost of admittedly spectacular scenery and fight scenes.  But he only pays lip service to the deeper questions of human nature that Shirow often addresses.  The result is an vary entertaining film that just misses the mark.That being said, it's still worth watching.  There is an earlier animation film of this story that enjoys a significant cult following.  I would like to see that, and look at the manga as well.  There is something to this that does capture the imagination, and there's more to be found than what this film focuses on.",3,"""Boiroids don't kill other bioroids.""",1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2479,"['Close', 'beginnings', 'anime', 'reviewing', 'here', 'saw', '2001', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'release', 'set', 'standard', 'CGI', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'never', 'be', 'equaled', 'significant', 'technology', 'breakthrough', 'notable', 'film', 'period', 'was', 'original', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'had', 'outstanding', 'animation', 'Appleseed', 'much', 'common', 'films', 'shares', 'heavy', 'use', 'CGI', 'interesting', 'bits', 'underlying', 'philosophy', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Ghost', 'was', 'created', 'manga', 'series', 'Masamune', 'Shirow', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'see', 'world', 'Appleseed', 'post-apocalyptic', 'version', 'Ghost', 'was', 'already', 'unraveling.Here', 'world', 'mostly', 'ruined', 'other', 'small', 'colony', 'composed', 'humans', 'bioroids', 'androids', 'primary', 'function', 'be', 'balance', 'humanity', 'tendency', 'self-destruct', 'are', 'indistinguishable', 'humans', 'other', 'lack', 'ability', 'breed', 'can', 'not', 'feel', 'anger', 'apparently', 'avail', 'outer', 'war', 'distract', 'opted', 'inner', 'violence', 'Olympus', 'torn', 'human', 'fear', 'bioroids.Into', 'Deunan', 'Knute', 'deadly', 'woman', 'warrior', 'who', 'daughter', 'woman', 'who', 'helped', 'create', 'first', 'bioroids', 'company', 'Briarius', 'old', 'lover', 'who', 'become', 'more', 'machine', 'human', 'Deunan', 'Olympus', 'hope', 'future', 'Buried', 'mind', 'key', 'will', 'complete', 'bioroids', 'give', 'capability', 'love', 'have', 'children', 'events', 'trigger', 'Armageddon', 'confrontation.The', 'story', 'almost', 'successful', 'somewhat', 'simplistic', 'characterization', 'Director', 'Shinji', 'Arimaki', 'provide', 'needed', 'continuity', 'though', 'result', 'important', 'things', 'happen', 'off-stage', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'unexplained', 'switches', 'plot', 'Arimaki', 'seized', 'primary', 'theme', 'human', 'anger', 'suspicion', 'xenophobia', 'thrown', 'lost', 'admittedly', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'fight', 'scenes', 'only', 'lip', 'service', 'deeper', 'questions', 'human', 'nature', 'Shirow', 'often', 'result', 'vary', 'entertaining', 'film', 'just', 'mark.That', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'earlier', 'animation', 'film', 'story', 'significant', 'cult', 'following', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'look', 'manga', 'as', 'well', 'something', 'capture', 'imagination', 'more', 'be', 'found', 'what', 'film']",Appleseed

Olympus is the last civilized city on our war torn Earth. And humans share half the population of the city with Bioroids (almost too human Androids). While most want to live peacefully in this serenity, there are others who fear the robots. And where there is fear, there is usually a crap load of fighting. Deunan is a female warrior who is brought into Olympus to help save the city from the people who want to destroy it and kill every Bioroid in it. But within Deunan lies a secret that not even she remembers. With the help of her lost boyfriend Briareos (who is now mostly machine), she begins her search for the whereabouts of the Appleseed. The one thing that will help save not only the Bioroids, but also humanity itself.After many attempts of trying to watch this movie all the way through, I finally got the time and the energy to get through it all in one sitting. The reason I say this is, even though it's a decent story, it can be pretty long winded sometimes. Way to explanatory. I fell asleep once during the scene where Hitomi is driving Deunan to the elders and she begins to just talk and talk. And then I once fell asleep during what I believe is pivotal moment where the elders are telling Deunan some things. Mainly because of just too much talking and explaining.The animation itself is done really well movement wise. I for one am not a fan of cell shading though. So the `coloring' of the drawings themselves just look, well, kind of stupid to me. Not all the time though. Sometimes I see something and am really wowed by how it looks. Then a minute later something looks totally bland, because of the cell shading. The mix with cg and drawings and cell shading, even though done pretty well, just wasn't for me. I'll take the drawings of Akira or the cg animation of FF7: Advent Children over this type of art any day.The story was good but sometimes to clich&eacute;d. The twists were nothing we hadn't seen before. And even though it was sometimes to drawn out, it was still a lot of fun to watch, once the good parts were going at least.In the end, I seem to be about 50/50 on this movie after I keep reading my own lines. So with that being said, I would say give it a rent one day if you are into sci-fi or end of the world type of movies. Unless of course you're a big anime fan, then I'm sure you will love this.

It puts pretty much every other animated movie I've seen recently -- from ""Final Fantasy"" to ""The Incredibles"" -- to absolute shame.

The music provides counterpoint to key scenes, but is never over the top.The story is a solid one, peopled by believable characters and a steadily-moving plotline.  Action sequences are paced nicely, and the dialogue is simple but works.  My one complaint (a minor one) is that I wish that they had gotten better voice actors for some of the parts. The actress for Deunan was fine, but better actors for Briareos and Hitomi I think would have carried it a little better.

Its population is made up not only of humans but also genetically engineered clones known as ""Bioroids"", which with the help of a super-computer, control Utopia. Helping to keep the order and fight against enemies from the wastelands are cyborg soldiers called ES.W.A.T. But its enemies are not just outside. Some humans in the city are starting to chaff under what they see as Bioroid dominance. So a silent military revolution has begun, which threatens not only the city, but all humankind.

The same with the blinking of the eyes. If a great white shark could blink, that is an action I would compare it to. The problem with CG has ALWAYS been faces and the cel-shading of Appleseed, while distracting from this weakness, does not solve it. Besides these complaints, I found this movie very entertaining once you got used to the animation style. Some scenes are pretty emotional and work very well. The action especially has a kinetic energy missing from some films, even if some of the slow-mo shots are homages to The Matrix.

Basically the last city, Olympus, is half populated by humans and half populated by Bioroids (artificial clones). There are extremist human groups who want to get rid of the Bioroids completely, thusly returning full control and power to the humans. The fait of both the Bioroids and humans ends up resting on the shoulders of Deunan and her retrieving the Appleseed technology that her mother helped produce.My only complaints are that there was a tremendous amount of dialog and explaining.

I must say this is a truly unfair comparison for many reasons.  For one, if you're going to compare PIXAR films with this rare gem, you better take into consideration the budget restraints and limitations ""Appleseed"" had.  Made on a trifle $10 million, ""Appleseed"" blows the audience away with its beautiful detail and amazing animation.  Sure, it's not on par with the $150 million dollar films PIXAR pumps out, but to compare the two would be like comparing a small independent garage film to a mega dollar studio backed Hollywood blockbuster.  They're both movies, perhaps even similar genres, but they can't be compared solely for the purpose of showing contrast.What you get in Appleseed is the best 3-D animation I've seen.  I for one preferred its realism and rich tones over the soft cloth texture pastels of many PIXAR films.  I would bet that if it had the budget of a PIXAR film it would have looked 100 times better than all of PIXAR's films combined.  If you need proof, just look at how close the Japanese came this time around.Other people claim that the cell shading makes it look hokey.  I actually thing this style suits the film.  The backgrounds are realistic, and ""Appleseed"" has a style  and flair that reeks of too cool.  Considering that they cell shaded a 3-D film to look more like traditional 2-D animation almost sounds like an oxymoron, but it gives a flavor entirely unique to this movie, giving it a much needed aesthetic originality from other films within the same genre of 3-D animation.  For once we can enjoy an adult story with real emotions and characters and not have to fall to the kiddy gimmicks of a film like ""The Incredibles.""  Although ""The Incredibles"" raised the bar for action in a children's film, it is a far cry from anything resembling adult storytelling and entertainment.  Appleseed satisfies the older generation of animation lovers and lets us delight on the rarity of this high caliber story telling aimed for well rounded and mature audiences.

She cries at the drop of a hat!""Deunan!""And she's supposed to be some tough soldier- half her mates get killed int he first 5 minutes- yet someone she's just met (Mihuni or whatever her name is) is important enough for her to risk her own life?  There's no character development at ALL in this film to explain that!""Deunan!""The scenes are overwrought with so many stupid pauses wher everyone tries to look cool and japanese... I'm so sick of that.  And they point their guns at each other threateningly as if that was a threat that stops someone from shooting you!?!?- when you point a gun, you PULL THE TRIGGER- threat over!  If the guy pointing a gun at you doens't pull the trigger first, he's dead.

Being one of the first full-length films to feature 100 percent computer animation (cel-shaded, though) Appleseed is certainly an eye candy.  Everything is nicely detailed from the characters to the background and even the small technological knick-knacks.Unfortunately, the awe ends early as Appleseed lacks in what the other Shirow masterpiece, Ghost in the Shell, delivers in strides: depth.  Appleseed lacks the a thought-provoking story line for those who're into a philosophical phase.  Likewise, if you're into action, the choreography and camera angles aren't no where great.This limited ""tin"" edition contains a 2nd disc with bonus material.  However, given the lackluster story line (and English track dubbing), I'd recommend that you get the single disc version instead.",3,"Technologically breathtaking, but lacking everywhere else",1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,887,"['reworking', 'Masamune', 'Shirow', 'masterpiece', 'certainly', 'one', 'gigantic', 'leap', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'Being', 'one', 'first', 'full-length', 'films', 'feature', '100', 'percent', 'computer', 'animation', 'cel-shaded', 'Appleseed', 'certainly', 'eye', 'candy', 'Everything', 'nicely', 'detailed', 'characters', 'background', 'even', 'small', 'technological', 'knick-knacks.Unfortunately', 'awe', 'early', 'Appleseed', 'what', 'other', 'Shirow', 'masterpiece', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'delivers', 'strides', 'depth', 'thought-provoking', 'story', 'line', 'who', ""'re"", 'philosophical', 'phase', 'Likewise', ""'re"", 'action', 'choreography', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', ""n't"", 'no', 'where', 'great.This', 'limited', 'tin', 'edition', '2nd', 'disc', 'bonus', 'material', 'However', 'given', 'lackluster', 'story', 'line', 'English', 'track', 'dubbing', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'get', 'single', 'disc', 'version', 'instead']",Appleseed

But the artwork, music and sounds were exceptional. I love the imaginative weapons, vehicles, and hardware that is thought up. It's so good that it's as if the artists are mechanical engineers. The people move with fluidity. The vehicles move like they are real. And if you like weaponry and like watching it in action then this film is a must for you. Lots of fun to watch. Attention to detail is extraordinary. I loved the music too. I wish there were more animes like this one.
