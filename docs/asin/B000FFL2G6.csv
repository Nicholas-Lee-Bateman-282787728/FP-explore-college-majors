There's getting it done and not getting it done.  Period!""'16 Blocks' is pleasing fun that brings surprises.  This is special.  Surprises pop up in the development of the action and plot that keep one guessing what will happen next.  The plot is enjoyable as it unfolds in pieces like real life.  (Everything isn't just explained in an exposition at the beginning.)  The atmosphere is just right.  Simultaneously, the movie is a suspenseful thriller and a fun-filled romp.  The movie is smart, witty, and clever.  It doesn't rely as much on every window getting shattered and every cop and robber car doing gymnastics into buildings.  (Most movies since 'The French Connection' seem like recycled urban Westerns.)  '16 Blocks' takes a seemingly tired premise and gives it a lot of life.You wouldn't know that from the synopsis of the story.  A weary and wary alcoholic cop, Jack Mosely (Bruce Willis) is assigned double overtime to transport a petty criminal (Mos Def) to the courthouse for some mysterious deliberation.  As might be expected, this routine operation develops complications that are harrowing at times, but sometimes intriguing.  Mosely's ex-partner (David Morse) is determined that he expedite the prisoner properly.  Thematically, it recalls a frenetic, fictitious update of 'Serpico'.  16 Blocks tells us the length of the destination, but the intervention of Hollywood's imagination and New York's reality make every stretch of the trek seem plausible.  How they make every block interesting is the key success of the film, and Bruce Willis plays Mosely differently than with the swagger of his usual urban protagonists.  The performances are likable, especially Willis and Mos Def, who put considerable heart in the chase.(Not often liking this kind of blockbuster extravaganza, and having had my fill of cop and robber capers, I admit I had to be in the right mood to get this video.  I made a happy choice. (It may be enough at least to curb my prejudice for the next cop and robber flick.)Not uncoincidentally, the movie clocks in eighteen minutes shy of two hours.  (And, for that matter, the screenwriter (Richard Wenk) and director (Ricahrd Donner) provide a bonus section where they explain deleted scenes.  While I didn't watch the entire venue, I appreciate it when they don't insist on a tedious director's cut that isn't thoughtful to the audience.)One of the special features of this DVD is that it offers two endings.  (I'll never know the total effect of the new ending because I switched over to the second ending only after having watched the movie straight through for the first time.)  They are both worthy endings. (Although presenting both has the film effect of reading ""The Lady or the Tiger"".)  I like the original movie ending better, but there are some things they bring home with the second.  It is not unlike Springsteen's ""Born to Run"".  When he did a total remake, it was hard to reconcile with the original.",4,Surprise!  Appearance Vs.

989146,AK0CENM3LUM28,B000FFL2G6,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","16 Blocks / B000FFL2G6*Spoilers*I went into ""16 Blocks"" not knowing what to expect and my ignorance, I think, greatly increased my enjoyment of the movie.Willis stars as a jaded police officer, tired of the job, or his life, and most of all of himself. When he is asked to work overtime to transport a ""nobody"" witness to what seems to be a routine court hearing, he is overwhelmed when the witness turns out to be a key figure in a courthouse battle to expose police corruption throughout the force - an exposure that the police officers on the prowl through the city are absolutely determined to prevent.One of the most powerful things about this movie is the uncertainty generated throughout the film. It is often very difficult to create and sustain genuine suspense in movies, when movie goers are saturated with the common themes and easy answers of so many movies. ""16 Blocks"", however, keeps the viewer guessing.As the plot unfolds, the viewer grapples with the suspense and questions sustained and revealed through the course of the movie. Is Willis a good cop, ground down by a corrupt system and used to turning a blind eye (not unlike Oldman's character inBatman Begins)? Or is he part of the problem, a bad cop like the others, but one who has become so disgusted with himself that he decides to risk everything on this one chance at redemption? Mos Def's character is equally inscrutable at times: Is he really the 'stupid nobody' that he seems to be in the beginning, when we see him in jail, apparently whining about his undelivered suit? Or is he a hardened criminal, no better than the cops he will testify against, who shouldn't be trusted with a gun? Is he as genuinely innocent as he claims to be, guilty only of being in the wrong place at the wrong time?One of the fundamental questions that ""16 Blocks"" grapples with is the nature of change and whether it is possible, especially after decades of repeated behavior. The movie seeks to answer if corrupt cops and criminals can give up being corrupt cops and criminals, in much the same way that we wonder if, for example, an alcoholic can give up his drink. And, even if that behavior can change, at what price does redemption come? I was pleased that the movie did not take the easy way out in this regard.As much as I enjoyed ""16 Blocks"", and I truly did, I almost come to feel that this wonderful movie is not well-suited for repeated viewings. So much of the suspense revolves around the characters of Willis and Mos Def, and that kind of suspense is difficult to recreate in a repeated viewing. I would definitely recommend this movie for a rental, but whether it's one to own and re-watch will be a matter of personal preference.This movie provides closed captions for the hearing impaired.~ Ana Mardoll",5,Everyone Can Change,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,2782,"['16', 'Blocks', '/', 'B000FFL2G6*Spoilers*I', 'went', '16', 'Blocks', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'ignorance', 'think', 'greatly', 'increased', 'enjoyment', 'movie.Willis', 'jaded', 'police', 'officer', 'tired', 'job', 'life', 'most', 'When', 'asked', 'work', 'overtime', 'transport', 'nobody', 'witness', 'what', 'be', 'routine', 'court', 'hearing', 'overwhelmed', 'when', 'witness', 'out', 'be', 'key', 'figure', 'courthouse', 'battle', 'expose', 'police', 'corruption', 'force', 'exposure', 'police', 'officers', 'prowl', 'city', 'are', 'absolutely', 'determined', 'prevent.One', 'most', 'powerful', 'things', 'movie', 'uncertainty', 'generated', 'film', 'often', 'very', 'difficult', 'create', 'sustain', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'movies', 'when', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'saturated', 'common', 'themes', 'easy', 'answers', 'so', 'many', 'movies', '16', 'Blocks', 'however', 'viewer', 'guessing.As', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'viewer', 'suspense', 'questions', 'sustained', 'revealed', 'course', 'movie', 'good', 'cop', 'ground', 'down', 'corrupt', 'system', 'used', 'turning', 'blind', 'eye', 'not', 'Oldman', 'character', 'inBatman', 'part', 'problem', 'bad', 'cop', 'others', 'one', 'who', 'become', 'so', 'disgusted', 'risk', 'everything', 'one', 'chance', 'redemption', 'Mos', 'Def', 'character', 'equally', 'inscrutable', 'times', 'really', ""'stupid"", 'nobody', 'be', 'beginning', 'when', 'see', 'jail', 'apparently', 'whining', 'undelivered', 'suit', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'better', 'cops', 'will', 'testify', 'who', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'gun', 'genuinely', 'innocent', 'be', 'guilty', 'only', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'One', 'fundamental', 'questions', '16', 'Blocks', 'grapples', 'nature', 'change', 'possible', 'especially', 'decades', 'repeated', 'behavior', 'movie', 'answer', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'criminals', 'can', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'criminals', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'wonder', 'example', 'alcoholic', 'can', 'give', 'up', 'drink', 'even', 'behavior', 'can', 'change', 'what', 'price', 'redemption', 'come', 'was', 'pleased', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'regard.As', 'much', 'enjoyed', '16', 'Blocks', 'truly', 'did', 'almost', 'come', 'feel', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'not', 'well-suited', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'So', 'much', 'suspense', 'characters', 'Willis', 'Mos', 'Def', 'kind', 'suspense', 'difficult', 'recreate', 'repeated', 'viewing', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'rental', 'one', 'own', 're-watch', 'will', 'be', 'matter', 'personal', 'preference.This', 'movie', 'closed', 'captions', 'hearing', 'impaired.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",N/A

It's breathlessly paced, action packed and thought provoking, and while the plot may be somewhat regurgitated it stands tall thanks to stand out performances by the cast, Bruce Willis once again proving that despite his lack of Oscar nomination he's still one of our greatest working actors.  Director Richard Donner stages this film brilliantly, with twists and turns and unpredictable predicaments, and the scenes are shot with a gritty fluidity, nothing too choppy yet never too refined.Bruce Willis plays Jack Mosley, an alcoholic cop who's pretty much given up on life.  His wife has left him; his job bores him and his who attitude and demeanor has suffered because of it.  He's plagued by guilt but is not willing to confront it.  Then he's forced to.  Mosley begrudgingly agrees to transport Eddie Bunker 16 blocks across town where he's going to testify against a group of corrupt cops, cops that Jack is close with, maybe even guilty alongside.  Mosley and Bunker aren't far from the police station before these cops attack in an effort to kill Bunker, stopping him from testifying.  Mosley decides to protect Eddie instead of turn him over to the slaughter and thus begins an exhilarating ride while they race to make it to the court house in time for Bunker to testify before time runs out.Willis is effortlessly convincing as an overweight, down and out cop.  I've always been a fan of his diversity, and while the cop role may not be a new one for Willis he gives us more than just a reflux performance but creates a totally new character in Jack Mosley and does so with acting bravado.  Rapper Mos Def delivers a spot on performance as wise-cracking chatter box Eddie Bunker.  Everything is original, from his stagger to his voice and he adds layers to his performance with each passing frame.  Another standout performance is found in David Morse.  I must say that I am becoming more and more smitten with this man.  He's a brilliant actor, and delivers a solid, Oscar worthy performance just about every time.  Here is no exception.  He's fantastic here as Frank Nugent, the dirty cop heading the head hunt for Bunker.  He's smart, witty and completely evil.'16 Blocks' is exciting, entertaining and memorable, thanks to a tight script that avoids falling into predictability and avoids using the same tired clich&eacute;s.  It's a wonderfully painted canvas for some great acting and the directing deserves quite a few nods in its favor as well.  I stand by the belief that the academy will soon honor Willis with a much deserved acting nomination for in almost everyone of his diverse roles, from ghost to superhero, cop to boxer he's delivered top notch performances investing all he has into what he's given.

989149,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,B000FFL2G6,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[0, 0]","The life of a man who is involved in police work is never predictable or normal compared to a normal person's standards. That comes with a job that's main line of work is dealing with some of the darkest individuals that walk the earth. But what happens when the worst of the corruption is occurring within the Precincts themselves? NYPD Detective Jack Mosley has dedicated his life to police work, but now that he's getting older, he has become rundown, injured, and dependent on alcohol. As he is about to go home after an all night shift, his lieutenant tells him he has one more job to do, a nice and ""easy"" one. All he has to do is transfer an inmate, Eddie Bunker, to the court house 16 blocks away. What he doesn't know is that this particular inmate is scheduled to testify against six dirty cops, including his old partner. He also doesn't know that there is a whole police force willing to kill him and the inmate to keep the truth silenced. A 16 block trip would never be as memorable or thrilling.16 Blocks is an action packed thrill ride from beginning to end. Directed Richard Donner, who also directed such action-thriller's such as the Lethal Weapon films and Conspiracy Theory, brings back the old formula that made the Lethal Weapon series such a success. Plenty of action + smart and original plot + unexpected comedic scenes that draw laughs - typically bad and overdone action scenes. The most important part of most of Richard Donner's movies is that they are all fun to watch. And 16 Blocks is no exception. With surprises on every turn, the script and delivery keep you fully engorged in the film.Detective Jack Mosley is the sort of role that Bruce Willis was born to play. He is a gruff, man's man. Beaten down, depressed, and just plain exhausted from too many sleepless nights working on keeping the streets clean of the worst of New York City's criminals. A role that fits Bruce Willis to an eerie likeness. Mos Def, as the stupid, but likable, prisoner Eddie Bunker is solid. The script must of called for a man that sounds as if he has some sort of disablement or someone that is uneducated. The voice that Mos Def uses sounds just like Damon Wayons' homeless character from In Living Color. So much so, that it seems that he ripped it off from him, and those who know voice from the former comedy sketch show, may get distracted from character.16 Blocks reminds me of such films as Phonebooth and Panic Room. Which were both good in their own right, both crowd pleaser's, and both fun, but both not as good as they could have been. 16 Blocks is not a bad film. It is a slightly above-average action-thriller, but the film does not disappoint. Any one that has enjoyed any of Donner's past movies of the same genre will enjoy this film. Donner may even gain more fans from this film.

And I'd like to think that the poor performance of this movie at the box office has more to do with that baggage than the film itself.This is an excellent movie! Period. Absolutely brilliant performances from Bruce Willis as the troubled, guilt-ridden, alcoholic cop, David Morse as they heavy, and Mos Def steals the movie.Before I go on, let me say that I am not a fan of cross-genre celebrities. The ""I look great, therefore I can act"" and the ""I sing great, therefore I can act"" crowd are of no interest to me.That being said, I must applaud the brilliant, layered, moving performance Mos Def delivers in this movie. This is an action movie with heart, pairing two of the most unlikely allies on a mission to save each other and themselves. Set within the framework of a 24-style countdown thriller, the movie has something for everyone. There is a lot of great action involving characters you truly come to care about through the great performances by the leads.And it's a spiritual journey as well. Viewing it with this in mind enhances the experience. Willis and Def play characters who have made too many wrong choices in their lives and are trying to do one thing right, tip the scales and regain their lives. This element adds a wonderful dimension to the film that sets it apart from the overdone action/buddy movie genre. And this genre has been done to death. Which is why 16 Blocks is such a treat to watch as it takes the far too familiar and gives it a captivating new approach.This is a great action movie. A moving viewing experience. Well acted, well written, well directed. How this one fell through the cracks I'll never know. It's a must see in my book. The DVD features a few special features, including an alternate ending, which, although well done, is really not the way the movie should have ended. They got it right in the theatrical release. There are also a lot of deleted scenes. These would have been much more enjoyable if the director commentary could be switched off while viewing them. The director and writer talk over ALL of the deleted scenes to the point where subtitles are inserted for the dialog because you can't hear it. This commentary should have been optional, but that is a minor peeve.So if you're in the mood for an action movie that truly entertains, then try 16 Blocks.

There isn't enough action to make it a very exciting thriller, and there isn't enough drama and character development to make it an intelligent suspense movie, either.  It still manages to be an enjoyable movie, though; Bruce Willis plays the over the hill alcoholic cop (i.e., stereotype) to perfection, and Mos Def does a fine job even though, as other reviewers have said, his strange, high-pitched voice makes most of his dialgoue impossible to understand.  Another fault is that an interesting plot twist near the end is made completely unbelievable by things that happened early in the movie (just watch it and you'll see what I mean.)

But after backtracking to peak at previous efforts that at their time of release I regarded as movies by a ""flavor of the day"", as well as his new ones to come including ""16 Blocks,"" I became a bigger Bruce Willis fan increasingly with each performance I'm exposed to. 16 Blocks is one of my favorite acting jobs by Willis, ditto on David Morse's superb job as his former partner but now antagonist. With a great script as well as great direction, Willis tells us a lot about his character in the movie's first 5-6 minutes with minimal dialogue, laying the groundwork for the effective contrast with his co-star Mos Def. This pairing is the movie's heart, as Willis, in getting a witness (Def) to court has to continually outwit Morse, his fellow rogue cops, and all the obstacles a seemingly righteous group of police would be entitled to. This setting is pretty basic, but as it unfolds it allows several of the main characters to display many sides of themselves, especially Willis, whose character never stops evolving until the very end. Donner has unwittingly become one of my favorite directors. I don't go to see his movies. I see great movies that I later find out are Donner's. The combination of all the aforementioned ingredients to this movie make this a movie that I watch repeatedly on The Dish, even after i bought the DVD- it instantly became one of those movies for me. For me, that's the sign of an excellent movie. It's also  a sign that my buying The Dish and all the movie channels available means that on any given day I'll trip over a pleasant surprise. I've found some of my favorite movies that way. If you like suspenseful movies with action in an urban setting with identities of their own, you'll love this movie. If you like great movies in general, you'll like it too.",4,Outstanding movie.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[10, 11]","Resting heavily on the shoulders of THE GAUNTLET (Clint Eastwood, 1977), 16 BLOCKS gives us a standard Bruce Willis action film and does so admirably. Not overly so, but a positive nod is deserved.Jack Mosley (Willis) is an old, alcoholic cop who's always done ""the right thing"" for his department. And now he's assigned to take a fast-talking thug named Eddie (rapper Mos Def) just 16 blocks for a court appearance. Trouble is, though, Eddie is scheduled to testify against some crooked cops who live and breath right in Jack's backyard. Jack is unaware of this and soon discovers he's got much more than just a simple escort job on his hands. People (cops mainly) are trying to kill Eddie. Jack quickly has to make a decision: protect Eddie and ""do the right moral thing,"" or let his fellow brethren have their way with him and ""do the right thing for the department.""Willis plays the aging cop well. He grumbles and drinks and generally hates what he does. The dirty New York offices and streets were shot well and gave an overall sense of the uncleanliness of Jack's life (including his past, which comes up toward the end of the film).Mos Def plays the irritating convict and his grating voice bugged the crap out of me. He sounded very nasal and whiney but, in contrast, this added a strange upbeat quality to a film that could've gotten too dark.I also like the fact that Willis isn't trying to play the ""young stud"" anymore on film. He's getting older and I'm happy to see him in roles befitting his age.The alternate endings on the DVD are worth watching, too.

And thank God for that in an action movie these days. This is good, old-fashioned, straight-forward entertainment; no big tricks, special effects or political points, but not just a dumb shoot 'em up action movie either, it has a good plot, simple story, a clever script with good dialog, characters you care about and great action.

I don't know if as the movie went on he dialed it down a notch and made it less grating or if I just got used to it.  Besides the voice though, the guy is a good actor and he and Willis make a good pair.The movie almost plays like a remake of Clint Eastwood's ""The Gauntlet,"" which you may remember cast him as an alcoholic cop sent by his crooked superiors to pick up a witness they intend to kill, and expect the cop is too burnt-out to stop them or will just look the other way; but of course they underestimate his resolve big time.

989163,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000FFL2G6,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[1, 1]","Bruce Willis is still having himself a fairly good career as an action star seeing as how his body has moved into the post action movie star stage. This and ""Hostage"" both have him battling his over the hillness, and a bunch of badies, to reign supreme. These films haven't been box office smashes, but they have been good which can't always be said about the prime of his career (""Die Hard 2""). Here Willis plays Jack Mosley, a shut off, beaten down NYPD cop who is given the deceptively simple task of moving key criminal witness Eddie (Mos Def) 16 blocks so that he can testify. For the sake of contrivance he is given a two hour time limit otherwise his testimony will be useless. After Jack makes a pit stop, for booze, Eddie is nearly whacked by other cops and a conspiracy is blown wide open. Since the NYPD acts like the NYPD they have things to hide, so in their view Eddie must not be allowed to testify, no matter what the cost. Jack, being stubborn and the hero of this story, won't give in and the set up is in place. Since the vast majority of the cities cops have nothing better to do they have been given the task of stopping Eddie's arrival at the courthouse, leaving us to watch as the salt and pepper duo run the gauntlet for those oh so important 16 blocks.The film succeeds mostly because the action exists on a psychological level as opposed to an explosive one. There are gunfights and all that, but most of the fun is derived from wondering how these characters are going to get themselves out of the situations they have placed themselves in. A few times the film paints itself into a corner it can't get out of without damaging it's credibility, but I don't think that they mind. At other times I felt as though the heavies were a little too heavy. Yes, they did have Big Brother on their side, but that doesn't explain all of their magical appearances at the most convenient of locations. It does have a lot of fun with the New York setting that it was filmed in. There are a lot of everyday occurrences that show up in the film that a less knowing one would not have included. We see the crazed vagrant begging for a MetroCard swipe, the ruthlessness of the subway doors, and the buses that move at the same pace as the walkers. The whole thing is very Hollywood. Will the drunk be reformed. . .what do you think? I had a good time though. The climax lost control of itself, but not so much that is ruined the movie for me.I would also like to point out that the villains of this film are cops, and not faceless ones either, but rather our most recognizable. That stands in pretty stark contrast to the norm of Hollywood. I mean it is a fictional film so maybe it is just Richard Donner grinding his ax. But I found it to be quite brave that he tried to blow the lid off of the myth that all cops are heroes. If this film deflates that ridiculous notion at all then it has served a greater good. A cop being shot is not something that should be celebrated, nor is it something that should be exploited to justify any fascist tactic the police want to use this week. But forget the whole police angle while you watch this. It is a little bit ""Speed,"" a little bit ""Die Hard,"" and a little bit ""Dog Day Afternoon."" And yes that does mean that is shows up with a heaping pile of cliches, but that does not make it a waste of time. ***1/4",3,Old Fashioned Action Movie Fun,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,3362,"['Bruce', 'Willis', 'still', 'having', 'fairly', 'good', 'career', 'action', 'star', 'seeing', 'how', 'body', 'moved', 'post', 'action', 'movie', 'star', 'stage', 'Hostage', 'have', 'battling', 'hillness', 'bunch', 'badies', 'reign', 'supreme', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'box', 'office', 'smashes', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'said', 'prime', 'career', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'Here', 'Willis', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'shut', 'off', 'beaten', 'down', 'NYPD', 'cop', 'who', 'given', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'task', 'moving', 'key', 'criminal', 'witness', 'Eddie', 'Mos', 'Def', '16', 'blocks', 'so', 'can', 'testify', 'sake', 'contrivance', 'given', 'two', 'hour', 'time', 'limit', 'otherwise', 'testimony', 'will', 'be', 'useless', 'Jack', 'pit', 'stop', 'booze', 'Eddie', 'nearly', 'whacked', 'other', 'cops', 'conspiracy', 'blown', 'wide', 'open', 'NYPD', 'acts', 'NYPD', 'have', 'things', 'hide', 'so', 'view', 'Eddie', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'testify', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'Jack', 'being', 'stubborn', 'hero', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'set', 'up', 'place', 'vast', 'majority', 'cities', 'cops', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'task', 'stopping', 'Eddie', 'arrival', 'courthouse', 'leaving', 'watch', 'salt', 'pepper', 'duo', 'run', 'gauntlet', 'oh', 'so', 'important', '16', 'blocks.The', 'film', 'mostly', 'action', 'psychological', 'level', 'opposed', 'explosive', 'one', 'are', 'gunfights', 'most', 'fun', 'derived', 'wondering', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'situations', 'have', 'placed', 'few', 'times', 'film', 'paints', 'corner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'damaging', 'credibility', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mind', 'other', 'times', 'felt', 'heavies', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'heavy', 'Yes', 'did', 'have', 'Big', 'Brother', 'side', ""n't"", 'explain', 'magical', 'appearances', 'most', 'convenient', 'locations', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'New', 'York', 'setting', 'was', 'filmed', 'are', 'lot', 'everyday', 'occurrences', 'show', 'up', 'film', 'less', 'knowing', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'included', 'see', 'crazed', 'vagrant', 'begging', 'MetroCard', 'swipe', 'ruthlessness', 'subway', 'doors', 'buses', 'move', 'same', 'pace', 'walkers', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'Will', 'drunk', 'be', 'reformed', '.what', 'do', 'think', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'climax', 'lost', 'control', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'ruined', 'movie', 'me.I', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'villains', 'film', 'are', 'cops', 'not', 'faceless', 'ones', 'rather', 'most', 'recognizable', 'pretty', 'stark', 'contrast', 'norm', 'Hollywood', 'mean', 'fictional', 'film', 'so', 'maybe', 'just', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'grinding', 'ax', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'brave', 'tried', 'blow', 'lid', 'myth', 'cops', 'are', 'heroes', 'film', 'ridiculous', 'notion', 'then', 'served', 'greater', 'good', 'cop', 'being', 'shot', 'not', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'celebrated', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'exploited', 'justify', 'fascist', 'tactic', 'police', 'want', 'use', 'week', 'forget', 'whole', 'police', 'angle', 'watch', 'little', 'bit', 'Speed', 'little', 'bit', 'Die', 'Hard', 'little', 'bit', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'yes', 'mean', 'up', 'heaping', 'pile', 'cliches', 'not', 'make', 'waste', 'time', '***1/4']",N/A

The plot is awfully far-fetched and I don't think anyone much likes stories about corrupt cops anymore.  Maybe some do, but I don't think they resonate with the mood of the country after 9/11.  Still, Bruce Willis is usually a positive on the screen and he gives a more subtle performance than we normally see from him.  His Jack Mosely is a tired and beaten man.  We meet him after a commander asks another officer who they have that they don't need because they need someone to sit at a crime scene until the crime lab folks show up to process the scene.Mos Def plays Eddie Bunker whom Jack has to move from his cell to testify before a grand jury.  He has a couple of hours to move him 16 blocks.  That is plenty of time even in New York City.  Except that Eddie's testimony will make some folks quite unhappy.  Action ensues.David Morse plays officer Frank Nugent.  Jack and Frank were partners for twenty some years and Morse is still hard charging while Jack is pretty much just trying to stagger to retirement if he isn't lucky enough to die first.  There are many other interesting characters in the movie, but the main trio is Jack, Eddie, and Frank.  The issue the movie raises is whether people can change or not.  Jack says no, Eddie says yes, and Frank doesn't care.The DVD offers both the theatrical release and an alternate ending.  They both come to the same conclusion about human character and that is the real point of the film.  The action flick is just they sugar helping the medicine go down.  I prefer the theatrical release to the alternate ending, but they both work in their own way.This is a more than ok film.  Not a great film, but Mos Def's Eddie is someone you will remember.  It is almost impossible to place him as the same actor who portrayed the great Vivien Thomas in ""Something the Lord Made"".  This says something about the power of his talent.

Sure, he was nominated for his performance in 'In Country' at the Globes, but never once at the Oscars, and his past performances would merit more.

In '12 Monkeys' he shone and yet Brad Pitt gets the oscar nod and Willis gets snubbed...again!

Here Bruce plays burnt out cop Jack Mosley who has been given the assignment to take Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) 16 blocks to testify.  The only problem is that Eddie is going to testify against some crooked cops, cops who don't want to go down and are willing to kill Eddie and Jack if it means keeping them quiet.  The film is fast paced and intence, and while some may find it predictable it will still have you anticipating each passing scene.

989174,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000FFL2G6,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[2, 3]","This non-stop chase movie demonstrates how a very simple idea can get catapulted into conflicting cross currents of deadly agendas and levels of humanity. The matter of life or death fuels an intense journey of a mere 16 blocks of Manhattan and builds tension and considerable depth in its concentration on character. It may be a restatement of ""Midnight Run,"" which it parallels in subject matter and framework, but it's a testament to Richard Wenk's writing that it stands apart from that landmark film in a fine variation.Director Richard Donner establishes early on just how low in the NYPD hierarchy officer Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is, merely by how expendable he's regarded when he's assigned to ""sit"" on a crime scene until the detectives arrive. By the time he returns to the squad, he's worn out, in need of a drink, and looking forward to even more relaxation. So, he's stretched pretty thin when his commanding officer gives him a fresh ""overtime"" assignment. ""You can come in late tomorrow,"" he's offered. You can hear him think, ""Oh, that just makes my day"" as he picks up the assignment folder.Mosley's assignment is to pick up one Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), from the lock-up and escort him to the courthouse for a grand jury appearance in a case involving police corruption. Eddie being a petty criminal and the prosecution's key witness.No problem. It's only a matter of 16 blocks. Of course, 16 Manhattan blocks can be like miles in any other city. And, therein, lies the gauntlet the film takes us through.Badly in need of a drink, Mosley makes a pit stop en route, and visits a bar that's like his home away from home. Eddie is outraged, complaining and screeching about getting his court job done so he can make a trip to Seattle where he's going to open a bakery shop. So, he's particularly distraught when an armed man appears at the car window demanding that he roll the window down.When it's clear that his handcuffs won't allow him to, the man draws on Eddie, but the expected bullet is one the would-be shooter takes in the back. Mosley has seen the play and kills the killer. This takes on a very dark dimension when officer Frank Nugent (David Morse), Mosley's ex-partner, and his team of dirty cops show up. The killer at the car was one of their own. Eddie is going to be a witness against them. The rubout was their way of controlling their future.The scene proceeds to all concerned assembled in the bar where the slick, oily Nugent tries to convince Mosley to go along with their execution of a small time, unimportant miscreant like Eddie. Just as one of the men is about to carry out that plan, Mosley shoots the man in the leg and takes off with his witness. Mosley isn't going along. Mosley has a job to do. Mosley is on the right side. Mosley is compassion and courage.The corrupt band of cops is outraged, cunning, determined and desperate as they pursue the rebel to their cause, chasing around the city after him and his charge. Our good guys never stop engaging us in their clever series of cat-and-mouse maneuvers. But the real winner here is the sympathy built up so intensely around the weary Willis and the whining charmer Def so outnumbered and outgunned in the maze of concrete and heavy traffic. Which makes it all the more grippingly great fun in the not-unfamiliar context of cops gone very bad. Morse, an actor with a complex bad guy portfolio, has never been better nor had a better chance to exert subtle wiles in disarming the adversary.The message isn't new, but the gameboard is juicily and humorously well designed. A good night out with Bruce and Def. And, Donner's still got it.",4,Good fun,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,3638,"['non-stop', 'chase', 'movie', 'how', 'very', 'simple', 'idea', 'can', 'get', 'catapulted', 'conflicting', 'cross', 'currents', 'deadly', 'agendas', 'levels', 'humanity', 'matter', 'life', 'death', 'fuels', 'intense', 'journey', 'mere', '16', 'blocks', 'Manhattan', 'builds', 'tension', 'considerable', 'depth', 'concentration', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'restatement', 'Midnight', 'Run', 'subject', 'matter', 'framework', 'testament', 'Richard', 'Wenk', 'writing', 'apart', 'landmark', 'film', 'fine', 'variation.Director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'early', 'just', 'how', 'low', 'NYPD', 'hierarchy', 'officer', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'merely', 'how', 'expendable', 'regarded', 'when', 'assigned', 'sit', 'crime', 'scene', 'detectives', 'arrive', 'time', 'squad', 'worn', 'out', 'need', 'drink', 'looking', 'forward', 'even', 'more', 'relaxation', 'So', 'stretched', 'pretty', 'thin', 'when', 'commanding', 'officer', 'fresh', 'overtime', 'assignment', 'can', 'come', 'late', 'tomorrow', 'offered', 'can', 'hear', 'think', 'Oh', 'just', 'day', 'up', 'assignment', 'folder.Mosley', 'assignment', 'pick', 'up', 'one', 'Eddie', 'Bunker', 'Mos', 'Def', 'lock-up', 'escort', 'courthouse', 'grand', 'jury', 'appearance', 'case', 'involving', 'police', 'corruption', 'Eddie', 'being', 'petty', 'criminal', 'prosecution', 'key', 'witness.No', 'problem', 'only', 'matter', '16', 'blocks', 'course', '16', 'Manhattan', 'blocks', 'can', 'be', 'miles', 'other', 'city', 'therein', 'gauntlet', 'film', 'through.Badly', 'need', 'drink', 'Mosley', 'pit', 'stop', 'route', 'bar', 'home', 'away', 'home', 'Eddie', 'outraged', 'complaining', 'screeching', 'getting', 'court', 'job', 'done', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'trip', 'Seattle', 'where', 'going', 'open', 'bakery', 'shop', 'So', 'particularly', 'distraught', 'when', 'armed', 'man', 'car', 'window', 'demanding', 'roll', 'window', 'down.When', 'clear', 'handcuffs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'man', 'Eddie', 'expected', 'bullet', 'one', 'would-be', 'shooter', 'back', 'Mosley', 'seen', 'play', 'killer', 'very', 'dark', 'dimension', 'when', 'officer', 'Frank', 'Nugent', 'David', 'Morse', 'Mosley', 'ex-partner', 'team', 'dirty', 'cops', 'show', 'up', 'killer', 'car', 'was', 'one', 'own', 'Eddie', 'going', 'be', 'witness', 'rubout', 'was', 'way', 'controlling', 'future.The', 'scene', 'proceeds', 'concerned', 'assembled', 'bar', 'where', 'slick', 'oily', 'Nugent', 'tries', 'convince', 'Mosley', 'go', 'along', 'execution', 'small', 'time', 'unimportant', 'miscreant', 'Eddie', 'Just', 'one', 'men', 'carry', 'out', 'plan', 'Mosley', 'shoots', 'man', 'leg', 'off', 'witness', 'Mosley', ""n't"", 'going', 'along', 'Mosley', 'job', 'do', 'Mosley', 'right', 'side', 'Mosley', 'compassion', 'courage.The', 'corrupt', 'band', 'cops', 'outraged', 'cunning', 'determined', 'desperate', 'pursue', 'rebel', 'cause', 'chasing', 'city', 'charge', 'good', 'guys', 'never', 'stop', 'engaging', 'clever', 'series', 'cat-and-mouse', 'maneuvers', 'real', 'winner', 'here', 'sympathy', 'built', 'up', 'so', 'intensely', 'weary', 'Willis', 'whining', 'charmer', 'Def', 'so', 'outnumbered', 'outgunned', 'maze', 'concrete', 'heavy', 'traffic', 'more', 'grippingly', 'great', 'fun', 'not-unfamiliar', 'context', 'cops', 'gone', 'very', 'bad', 'Morse', 'actor', 'complex', 'bad', 'guy', 'portfolio', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'better', 'chance', 'exert', 'subtle', 'wiles', 'disarming', 'adversary.The', 'message', ""n't"", 'new', 'gameboard', 'juicily', 'humorously', 'well', 'designed', 'good', 'night', 'Bruce', 'Def', 'Donner', 'still', 'got']",N/A

Imagine John McLean 15 years older, drunker, and lonelier because of his wife having left him and you have this character.  The thing is, Willis is so good in the role, and it fits him so well, that it's almost like putting on an old shoe.  It just fits him.Willis plays a cop who at the end of a night shift, is on his way out the door to continue getting drunk (People like this character always seem to have some level of alcohol in their blood) when he is corraled at the precinct by a lieutenant and forced to transport a witness 16 blocks to the courthouse to testify.  The witness, played by Mos Def, is a talky, annoying guy who seems to just say whatever comes into his head whenever. He also delivers his lines in this nasally tone that you just learn to adjust to.Very early in the trip (not coincidentally, when Willis stops off at the ABC store) the car is attacked.  Someone wants Mos Def dead.  Willis helps him escape into a bar, and then he learns that the people after him are fellow police officers, led by David Morse.  Willis decides to help him get to the courthouse, giving us the film's conflict.  Morse and the force against an 80 proof Willis and a chatty witness.The setup is pretty standard.  What makes the film fun is the characters and execution of the roles.  Willis is perfect, Mos Def is a lot of fun, and David Morse (whom I still remember as Dr. Morrison from St. Elsewhere) is a great bad guy who is there ""to serve and protect"".

However, I am glad a friend let me borrow this film for nothing more than a change of pace from my normal film viewing.I don't think there is anything really new here. Bruce Willis is yet another worn down old cop.  There are ""bad guys"" out to get the ""good guys"".  The good guy, not surprisingly, knows the ways of the bad guys because he was once one of them, etc, etc, etc.What was of great interest to me was Mos Def's performance.  This actor seems to be on his way to the big leagues. The pace and timing of the film was superb. For those unaware of the ""real time"" method of filmmaking, this film is a fine example. This basically means that the film is 90 minutes long and the action you view (the scenario in the film) is supposed to be 90 mins long.  I can't express how realistic this makes a film feel.  Just imagine a film like Lord of the Rings, but instead of showing other things going on, Frodo does not leave your sight for the entire film and every action he does, you see.

One morning, after his night shift is over, he gets an assignment to escort a witness-criminal named Eddie (Mos Def) to a grand jury hearing which 16 blocks away from headquarters is. The witness has to get to court in next 118 minutes but on the way somebody wants him dead and they have all means and determination to have it happen. The kid, like everyone calls Eddie is going to testify against corruption and drug dealing within the very police department where Jack used to work and where he has long time friends and colleagues, including his former partner for many years, Det. Frank Nugent (David Morse). Now Jack and Eddie are against New York's bravest and time is certainly not on their side while they are on the trip through 16 Blocks in Chinatown to make it in time to court and preferably alive.For the first 70 minutes I loved the film but then, the creators made an implausible turn in the script which made me cringe but even the way it turned, the movie was fun to watch -the combination of Action/Crime/Thriller almost always makes me happy. The DVD features an alternate ending which I like a lot and I wish it could make it to the theatrical release. It is more logical and fits the film but I can understand why the movie makers decided to go with the different ending. Another thing - you can't go wrong with Bruce Willis.

It reminded me of how thankful I am not to be living in NYC, for example, as a number of Bruce Willis movies have done. Well, here Willis, a burned out NYC cop and weary from a very long-day's work, was assigned the extra task of ttansporting a criminal from the jail house to the courthouse, a distance of 16 blocks. It's a tough 16 blocks as a number of Willis's associates don't want the criminal to appear in court and are willing to do anything to stop it. Anything. Now, you might not think all that much could happen in a distance of only 16 blocks, but, remember, this is a Bruce Willis movie. In the movie, Bruce then managed to make an uneasy friendship with his prisoner, Mos Def, and the two finally managed to make it to the courthouse, albeit with a lot of death and destruction along the way.It's an interesting movie. Well done. I don't know how they ever managed under such crowded NYC conditions, but they did. A lot of bullets flew. Collateral damage wss everywhere and well done. The filming and sound was well done. The pacing was good and there's no boredom. Bruce Willis looked very old and weary, but I guess that's his part.

989195,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FFL2G6,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","A surprisingly good little thriller, 16 BLOCKS provides a tight, minimalist script, fine directing, excellent camera work, and  standout performances by Bruce Willis, Mos Def, and David Morse.  It is enough of a twist on the usual cop chase films to make it fresh, exciting, intelligent and touching.Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is an old drunk, a cop with NYPD who is given only minimal duties because everyone knows he has a problem (and why then aren't they doing something about it...?).  He is assigned to escort a prisoner, petty criminal loquacious Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) from his cell to the courthouse 16 blocks away where he is to testify against some bad cops.  Little does Mosley know it is a setup and very soon it is apparent that the bad cops headed by his old partner Frank (David Morse) are out to kill Eddie so that he can't testify against them.  Jack and Eddie have a face-off in a bar where Jack has a conscience change and decides to go against his fellow bad cops and get Eddie to the courthouse.  It is the getting there, involving hiding, running, commandeering a bus, etc that creates the bulk of the film.But as much as the action portion of the thriller is satisfying, the feature of this film is the extraordinary gradual development of change in the character of Jack and of Eddie as they both, as 'outsiders' doomed to careers that seem dead ends, interrelate, bond and change.  Both Willis and Def give superb performances and the film is well worth watching to just see these fine actors in parts that give them room to demonstrate their considerable skills.  Richard Donner paces his film well and there is not a dead moment in the movie.  The cinematography by Glen MacPherson and the musical score by Klaus Badelt  as well as the fine supporting cast make this a polished work.  There is an alternate ending (originally shot to be the first choice ending!) that makes the film take a different slant, but the film as it stands is a fine one.

989199,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000FFL2G6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[32, 32]","Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) is an aging, rundown, alcoholic cop who, at this stage of his career, finds himself at the bottom of the totem pole. Thus, he gets saddled with the menial errand of escorting smalltime thief Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) 16 blocks from the precinct to the courthouse, where Eddie will testify in a grand jury. But what begins as a routine assignment for Detective Mosley becomes a desperate bid for survival as the bleary eyed, hung-over cop and his charge find themselves under relentless attack by focused, well-armed assailants intent on making sure Eddie doesn't make it to his court appointment.16 Blocks is a thinking man's action thriller. Even though, on the surface, it looks like a suspense film, a case could be made for it to be considered a character study picture. Amidst all the frenetic bullets and chase sequences, you'll find many moments of casual interaction, as leisurely enacted by Willis, Mos Def and even Morse. Willis and Mos Def, in their mismatched buddy roles, put in some character acting and have several scenes where they just have conversations (some on point, some non sequitur), in between the chases. Mos Def's motormouth character, in particular, spends an inordinate amount of time just riffing about suits and signs and bakeries.Bruce Willis continues his recent trend (see Hostage) of portraying jaded, burnt-out cops who end up seizing one last shot at redemption. He excels in playing this type of role:  tired, world-weary, kicked-around, maybe even a little corrupt, but, ultimately, someone not to be eff'd with and someone who can be depended upon to doggedly do the right thing (Bruce seriously needs to patent this character). Jack Mosley, as played by Willis, is laconic, paunchy, shuffling, stuck on the bottom rung career wise, and has a dire craving for alcohol. But the audience never doubts he'll man up when the chips are down.I'm a fan of Mos Def, from way back when he was just a hip hop artist. Don't get me wrong, he was and is a great rapper. He  flows and rhymes with insight and intelligence. And he's great as the host of HBO's Def Poetry. His natural, off-the-cuff style of acting is making folks sit up and pay attention (check out Brown Sugar, The Italian Job, and Something the Lord Made). With 16 Blocks, he comes out of left field with his jazzy interpretation of Eddie Bunker: verbose, optimistic and a bit quirky. The only negative in his portrayal is the grating fashion in which he channels the nasal voice of comedian Eddie Griffin. Other than that, Mos is solid.David Morse is great as the main villain. He injects his Det. Frank Nugent, Jack's crooked current supervisor and ex-partner,  with equal doses of complexity, cynicism, and immorality. Nugent's been around the block, knows the ropes and could care less about minimizing collateral damage. Yet, a part of Nugent still cares for his former partner Mosley and regrets having to put him down. But, in the end, he's gotta do what a dirty cop's gotta do.Director Richard Donner gauges the tempo of this movie just right. Not too plodding, but not all out action, either. Oh, the action scenes are plentiful and charged with enough tension but they aren't break-neckedly constant. There is ample breathing room in between the pursuits, a pace which nicely suits Willis's middle-aged, gimpy-legged hero, as he actually gets a chance to take in oxygen, in between exchanging gunfire and platitudes.The sparse Special Features consist of an alternate ending not seen in theaters, several deleted scenes with wiseacre commentary by Richard Donner and his screenwriter, and a theatrical trailer. A film commentary would've been nice.16 Blocks is a well-meaning movie that is introspective and thoughtful, yet strives to give the fans their money's worth with its done-by-the-numbers shoot-em-up violence. There is a worthy message here trying to make itself heard, thru the voice of Eddie Bunker, that Pollyanna of a crook. The movie has a top-drawer star at the top of his game, who seems, in fact, to get better as he ages. And it's got Mos Def, who I firmly believe will be heard from for a lot of years to come.

So when I see a cop movie with Bruce Willis I never caught at the theaters, I couldn't resist.  And Bruce, as expected, does a fantastic job.  Those playing 2nd fiddle in the movie do quite well, also, but Bruce really steals the show.2)  A Good Pace of Action.  Some action movies can leave you out of breath.  This movie had a good pace that didn't leave you overwhelmed but still had some decent scenes of action.3)  A Decent Message.  Mos Def's characters (Eddie Bunker) would say throughout the movie that people can change.  The person everybody assumes needs to change is Eddie Bunker.  But nearly everybody changes throughout this movie as their actions speaks of their true character.  Personally, I liked the alternate ending because it shows how some of these changes effect people and shows the changes in more people.  Everybody can change... for the worst or for the better.Negatives:1)  Bad Cops... Again?  This theme is getting a bit tiring.  Not to mention that it is also getting insulting.  It seems like every time you watch a cop movie you get the idea that 2% of the cops out there know what they are doing, 20% are trigger happy cowboys, 30% are corrupt, 20% are buffoons, and the rest are all one step away from mass murder suicide.  It is no wonder that cops get so little respect these days from our youth, and this movie does little to show that cops are a good thing to have on the streets.  I wish they'd make more cop movies where the cops are portrayed as the good people they really are.I have other beefs with this movie, but that one is the biggest one and I'll leave it at that.So, recommended?  Well, I'd recommend many movies before this one.  Buf if you've seen them all and you dig cop movies and buddy-cop movies (though Eddie Bunker is not a cop), then yes, pick this up.  Otherwise, there isn't anything here that is fresh enough to make me recommend you rush out and pick it up.Oh, and rent it.  This isn't really worth keeping in your library.

989206,A2CB0DNKYCIQE8,B000FFL2G6,J. C. Amos,"[1, 1]","When you put together the producer/director of the Lethal Weapon movies with the star of the Die Hard movies, you can expect to see an entertaining action flick.  And 16 Blocks is entertaining at that.  It does have a few problems though, and one is that it takes itself too seriously.I won't waste too much time with the premise, but the deal is that a washed up, alcaholic cop close to retirement (Willis) has to escort a career criminal (Mos Def) to a hearing where he can testify against some crooked cops.  The distance they have to travel to get there is, you guessed it, 16 blocks.  Of course they don't have an easy time of it, as they are stopped along the way by said cops and others who are trying to keep them from reaching their destination.While the crooked cop story has been played and is pretty cliche, the premise is interesting and reminds me of Phone Booth in that it takes place in a fairly confined area within a short amount of time.  The other intruiging part about the movie was Bruce Willis' character.  It takes you off guard to see him so pale and out of shape and for me, this is the most entertaining part of the movie.  Mos Def's character is different, but for the most part a little annoying.I think my main problem with 16 Blocks is that it doesn't have as much fun as it should.  Sure, it has shootout scenes and car chase (or bus chase rather) scenes like the Lethal Weapon and Dire Hard movies had, but it doesn't seem to have as much fun doing it as those movies did.  The action scenes seemed a little forced and dutiful and there really weren't a whole lot of them.  The antagonists are very one dimensional and cliche like the plot.

""A New Yorker""","[2, 3]","`16 Blocks' is a kind of movie you can really only watch once and even at that you'll be correctly guessing what happens next as it goes through loads of familiar developments with a lot of unsubtle foreshadowing. I'm surprised that Richard Donner managed to make a film so tepid because he is really great in doing action/thrillers.Bruce Willis does what he does best. He plays a downbeat, alcoholic cop who is talked into transporting a witness Mos Def to the courthouse to testify against dirty cops. Mos Def delivers an outstanding performance in this movie, but there are times he would drive you crazy due to his constant rambling, but he does adds a lot of depth to his character and to the movie as a whole. In return, the viewers are able to sympathize with him.Since the film runs 102 minutes and they have 118 minutes to get to the courthouse, it's not strictly in real time. But it did very much remind me of `Phone Booth' in terms of brisk pacing and bustling New York backdrop. A suspension of disbelief is seriously required as a few completely implausible things happen regarding this movie. There are really clever twists and thoughtful turns, but, when push comes to shove, there's nothing better in this film than ones that Bruce has done many times before. And we've seen him in more dire straits than these.Thankfully both main actors stay into character, so that the unexpected ending fits into the movie without jarring the mood of the piece. The mood is just like Willis's character: dark, weary, and dispassionate. It is, in the end, a movie that focuses on character rather than action. Just when I thought that the movie was going to have me accepting the epiphany as a typical Hollywood clich&eacute;, it offers an explanation that is quite believable.",3,"""There are definitely signs everywhere"".........",1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,1780,"['16', 'Blocks', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'only', 'watch', 'once', 'even', ""'ll"", 'be', 'correctly', 'guessing', 'what', 'next', 'loads', 'familiar', 'developments', 'lot', 'unsubtle', 'foreshadowing', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'managed', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'tepid', 'really', 'great', 'doing', 'action/thrillers.Bruce', 'Willis', 'what', 'best', 'downbeat', 'alcoholic', 'cop', 'who', 'talked', 'transporting', 'witness', 'Mos', 'Def', 'courthouse', 'testify', 'dirty', 'cops', 'Mos', 'Def', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'movie', 'are', 'times', 'would', 'drive', 'crazy', 'due', 'constant', 'rambling', 'lot', 'depth', 'character', 'movie', 'whole', 'return', 'viewers', 'are', 'able', 'sympathize', 'him.Since', 'film', '102', 'minutes', 'have', '118', 'minutes', 'get', 'courthouse', 'not', 'strictly', 'real', 'time', 'did', 'very', 'much', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'terms', 'brisk', 'pacing', 'bustling', 'New', 'York', 'backdrop', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'seriously', 'required', 'few', 'completely', 'implausible', 'things', 'happen', 'regarding', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'clever', 'twists', 'thoughtful', 'turns', 'when', 'push', 'shove', 'nothing', 'better', 'film', 'ones', 'Bruce', 'done', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'dire', 'straits', 'these.Thankfully', 'main', 'actors', 'stay', 'character', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'fits', 'movie', 'jarring', 'mood', 'piece', 'mood', 'just', 'Willis', 'character', 'dark', 'weary', 'dispassionate', 'end', 'movie', 'character', 'rather', 'action', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'accepting', 'epiphany', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 'explanation', 'quite', 'believable']",N/A

Bruce plays Jack Mosely, a hard on his lock NYPD detective who will tie one on at a drop of a hat. First of all, Bruce looks so different in this role. I barely recognized him. He gained weight and his hair was gray and he wore glasses and just looked generally disheveled and harried. Bruce played this role precisely because his character was so believable, yet he was also against type and did exactly the opposite of what one would expect at first. Mos Def was excellent as the prisoner gone good, Eddie Bunker. I really enjoy ""16 Blocks"" because unlike just about every other action movie (I've seen them all) this one really causes the viewer to think outside the box. It's not just a story of good verses evil. Instead, it's a complex and intricate yarn that goes way past the point of no return. Instead of using his trademark action-packed moves that made John McClane a household name, Bruce relies heavily on his dramatic skills to give his character a beating heart. I especially enjoyed the part when Jack and Eddie were hiding behind the wall as Jack talked to Frank Nugent (played exceptionally by David Morse). Because we really to see what made both of these men tick and at least this viewer, got a view of evil and a view of blatant corruption that rarely gets depicted in such stark honesty and realism.

Bruce Willis stars as a burnt out drunk cop that has to take an important wittness (Mos Def) down 16 Blocks to court. Willis learns that it's not going to be that easy since crooked cops want Def dead. I don't blame them, after 2 minutes of hearing his voice I wanted him dead too lol. I don't know why Def chooses to talk like Rain Man on crack. I guess he's going for comedy but he's not even funny. He barely even acts like his life is in danger. Once they are in what they think is a safe hiding place he just talks and talks and talks. The fact that he was casted and that he plays the character how he does, it makes it hard to believe that he has an important testimony that will bring down many cops. I mean he pretty much plays him as if there's something mentally wrong with him. I just can't see how he'd be taken serious in a court room anyway.Willis however is simply solid and the film is gripping enough to make me want to sit through hearing Def's voice for 2 hours. While the under-used David Morse ""who should probably be in every movie lol"" is also excellent as Willis' former partner who wants Def. I heard that Willis wants the Hostage director to do Die Hard 4 but I think Donner would be a much better man for the job. It's silly when Willis takes a bus full of people hostage  to get away from the cops. Meanwhile of course that just drawers even more cops to them. I think Donner makes that work though because he makes you think ""how is Willis going to get out of this ?"". He always makes sure we're interested to see what will happen next. He also gets such  a good performance out of Willis that I'd love to see Willis as John McClane with him in the director chair.

On that last point, the personal issue here is the Willis character's sudden willingness to wake up and do something about all the corruption around him after years of looking the other way, and the repurcussions of this new commitment to do the right thing.  One quibble: the various characters (good and bad) talk a bit too much about Willis' newfound conscience when it would have been more elegant to just let us see it in action without all the chatter about it.  But, again, that's just a quibble.  Overall, ""16 Blocks"" is a satisfying, solid piece of late-career work by director Richard Donner (""Superman"" and the ""Lethal Weapon"" films). Extras are few but satisfying: a collection of deleted scenes introduced and narrated by Mr. Donner and his screenwriter; an alternate ending (interesting but not as good as the movie's actual ending, where David Morse's corrupt cop character stays corrupt instead of inexplicably developing a conscious during the movie's last minute or so); and a trailer.

989218,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000FFL2G6,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 7]","""16 Blocks"" is directed by Richard Donner, who helmed the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies (I know he did the first one for sure) and has, essentially, a story you've seen before. People on the run from something and have to be somewhere by a certain time, everything holds them up and they eventually pull through. While ""16 Blocks"" runs slightly different then that, it's basically what I said. Turns out though it's one of the most entertaining, funny, and smart action films I've seen this year thus far. In another role as a down-and-out cop, Bruce Willis is spectacular. He catches the tiredness perfectly. Willis plays Jack Mosley, a drunken detective who mopes around and seems like he's ready to retire. As he's leaving the station, his lieutenant tells him he has to pick up a petty criminal and drive him 16 blocks to court, the guy who was supposed to drive him apparently got held up. The guy is Eddie Bunker(Mos Def, 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""), who is testifying against a bunch of crooked cops. After two hitmen fail to kill Eddie and Jack finds out that the cops are involved, they begin to run. Heading the chase after them is Detective Frank Nugent (the always spectacular David Morse, 'The Green Mile'), an ex-partner of Jack's. As I said, the movie is very entertaining. There's a scene in the film that takes place in a bus that's reminiscent of ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and at this same scene, the movie momentarily loses it's footing; but quickly regains it. Looking beyond the story, the performances are great too. Mos Def puts on a Mike Tyson voice for some reason, but manages to deliver a charming performance; Willis is playing a character he played in ""Sin City"" but he's still great; and David Morse is always great. As for the (actual) ending...It's smart, surprising, and redeeming. The alternate ending is good, but it was a good choice that they didn't put it in the movie.GRADE: A",5,16 Blocks,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,1914,"['16', 'Blocks', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'who', 'helmed', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'movies', 'know', 'did', 'first', 'one', 'sure', 'essentially', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'People', 'run', 'something', 'have', 'be', 'somewhere', 'certain', 'time', 'everything', 'up', 'eventually', 'pull', '16', 'Blocks', 'slightly', 'different', 'then', 'basically', 'what', 'said', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'smart', 'action', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'thus', 'far', 'role', 'down-and-out', 'cop', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'spectacular', 'tiredness', 'perfectly', 'Willis', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'drunken', 'detective', 'who', 'around', 'ready', 'retire', 'leaving', 'station', 'lieutenant', 'tells', 'pick', 'up', 'petty', 'criminal', 'drive', '16', 'blocks', 'court', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'drive', 'apparently', 'got', 'held', 'up', 'guy', 'Eddie', 'Bunker', 'Mos', 'Def', ""'The"", 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'who', 'testifying', 'bunch', 'crooked', 'cops', 'two', 'hitmen', 'fail', 'kill', 'Eddie', 'Jack', 'out', 'cops', 'are', 'involved', 'begin', 'run', 'Heading', 'chase', 'Detective', 'Frank', 'Nugent', 'always', 'spectacular', 'David', 'Morse', 'Green', 'Mile', 'ex-partner', 'Jack', 'said', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'scene', 'film', 'place', 'bus', 'reminiscent', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'same', 'scene', 'movie', 'momentarily', 'footing', 'quickly', 'Looking', 'story', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'voice', 'reason', 'deliver', 'charming', 'performance', 'Willis', 'playing', 'character', 'played', 'Sin', 'City', 'still', 'great', 'David', 'Morse', 'always', 'great', 'actual', 'ending', 'smart', 'surprising', 'redeeming', 'alternate', 'ending', 'good', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'movie.GRADE']",N/A

989221,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000FFL2G6,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 5]","In 2003, director Richard Donner (""Superman:  The Movie"" and `Lethal Weapon' series) released his latest directorial effort for Warner Brothers titled ""Timeline"".  Based on a bestseller by renowned author Michael Crichton (author of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World""), the movie didn't do much to light audiences fires, and the movie was essentially a flop.  After enduring the making of this film, Donner had become disenfranchised with Hollywood for the first time in his incredibly long and successful career.  In 2006, Richard Donner returned to deliver audiences a tightly wound thriller, with a very smart story packed full of twists and turns, this thriller was ""16 Blocks"" starring Bruce Willis and Mos Def.""16 Blocks"" focuses on a down-and-out NYPD detective by the name of Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis), who is assigned the most mundane of tasks to fill up his day.  His job is to escort a lowly criminal (Mos Def) from the precinct to the courthouse before the grand jury convenes for the day.  Though this may seem a small task, especially since they only have to travel 16 blocks to get from point `A' to point `B', but Jack Mosley is soon discovering that there is more to this assignment and this criminal than meets the eye.  Now, both Jack and this criminal are on the run from Jack's fellow police officers, who it just so turns out need to silence this criminal, because he is a key witness in an extortion case against them.This movie is an incredible ride that grabs you and doesn't let go until the credits roll.  While doing an interview to promote this movie, director Richard Donner said that in order for him to want to return to directing movies, it would have to be an incredible script, with assurances that the studio wouldn't interfere as much with the moviemaking process, basically he wanted to be allowed to have fun again.  Well, he came back so if nothing else can be said about this film, that should be enough, when an acclaimed director returns from a self-imposed exile from Hollywood to direct a movie, when he really could just retire and live comfortably outside of the public eye.  In regards to the excellence that this movie employs, the script as I said was very tightly woven, and fast-paced barely leaving the audience time to catch its breath.  The acting throughout the film is of the highest caliber, Bruce Willis is great as the downtrodden detective Jack Mosley, and is virtually unrecognizable if not for his voice.  Mos Def turns in a scene stealing performance as the criminal turned star witness, Def's nasal-pitched voice (I don't believe this is how he actually talks in real-life) is so hilarious sounding, while somewhat grinding on the nerves, he is lucky to not annoy the audience entirely, this is achieved through his wit and charm that wins the audience over almost as soon as he's introduced.  David Morse also delivers a very solid performance as Jack Mosley's former partner who is leading the renegade cops in their effort to stop Jack from delivering the criminal to the courthouse.All in all, I really can't complain about this movie at all, if there is one complaint I could make is that the DVD for the movie contained very few special features, other than that there's nothing else negative to say about it, and even that complaint is something aimed not at the movie, but at Warner Brothers for being so chincy with the bonus stuff.  So, if you enjoy action-packed thrillers, that have plenty of story and twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then this is most definitely the movie for you to see.""16 Blocks"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",5,The Distance Between Life and Death Can Be Very Short...,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,3642,"['2003', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'series', 'released', 'latest', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'titled', 'Timeline', 'Based', 'bestseller', 'renowned', 'author', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'author', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Lost', 'World', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'light', 'audiences', 'fires', 'movie', 'was', 'essentially', 'flop', 'enduring', 'making', 'film', 'Donner', 'had', 'become', 'disenfranchised', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'time', 'incredibly', 'long', 'successful', 'career', '2006', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'returned', 'deliver', 'audiences', 'tightly', 'wound', 'thriller', 'very', 'smart', 'story', 'packed', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'thriller', 'was', '16', 'Blocks', 'starring', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Mos', 'Def', '16', 'Blocks', 'down-and-out', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'name', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'assigned', 'most', 'mundane', 'tasks', 'fill', 'up', 'day', 'job', 'escort', 'lowly', 'criminal', 'Mos', 'Def', 'precinct', 'courthouse', 'grand', 'jury', 'convenes', 'day', 'may', 'seem', 'small', 'task', 'especially', 'only', 'have', 'travel', '16', 'blocks', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'soon', 'discovering', 'more', 'assignment', 'criminal', 'eye', 'Now', 'Jack', 'criminal', 'are', 'run', 'Jack', 'fellow', 'police', 'officers', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'out', 'need', 'silence', 'criminal', 'key', 'witness', 'extortion', 'case', 'them.This', 'movie', 'incredible', 'ride', 'grabs', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'credits', 'roll', 'doing', 'interview', 'promote', 'movie', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'said', 'order', 'want', 'return', 'directing', 'movies', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'incredible', 'script', 'assurances', 'studio', 'would', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'as', 'much', 'moviemaking', 'process', 'basically', 'wanted', 'be', 'allowed', 'have', 'fun', 'again', 'Well', 'came', 'back', 'so', 'nothing', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'when', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'returns', 'self-imposed', 'exile', 'Hollywood', 'direct', 'movie', 'when', 'really', 'could', 'just', 'retire', 'live', 'comfortably', 'public', 'eye', 'regards', 'excellence', 'movie', 'script', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'tightly', 'woven', 'fast-paced', 'barely', 'leaving', 'audience', 'time', 'catch', 'breath', 'acting', 'film', 'highest', 'caliber', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'great', 'downtrodden', 'detective', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'virtually', 'unrecognizable', 'not', 'voice', 'Mos', 'Def', 'scene', 'stealing', 'performance', 'criminal', 'turned', 'star', 'witness', 'Def', 'nasal-pitched', 'voice', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'actually', 'real-life', 'so', 'hilarious', 'sounding', 'somewhat', 'grinding', 'nerves', 'lucky', 'not', 'annoy', 'audience', 'entirely', 'achieved', 'wit', 'charm', 'audience', 'over', 'almost', 'as', 'soon', 'introduced', 'David', 'Morse', 'also', 'very', 'solid', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'former', 'partner', 'who', 'leading', 'renegade', 'cops', 'effort', 'stop', 'Jack', 'delivering', 'criminal', 'courthouse.All', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'movie', 'one', 'complaint', 'could', 'make', 'DVD', 'movie', 'contained', 'very', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'nothing', 'else', 'negative', 'say', 'even', 'complaint', 'something', 'aimed', 'not', 'movie', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'being', 'so', 'chincy', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'So', 'enjoy', 'action-packed', 'thrillers', 'have', 'plenty', 'story', 'twists', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'then', 'most', 'definitely', 'movie', 'see', '16', 'Blocks', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language']",N/A

The prisoner is played by Mos Def, a very talented actor (and for those who want to see just HOW versative he can be, I strongly suggest you rent or buy Something the Lord Made).Both Mos Def and Bruce Willis give well-fleshed out portrayals of their characters. David Morse, who doesn't always get the opportunity  to shine as an actor on the big screen, also does a fine job as a corrupt policeman.And yet...this film wasn't as tightly wound as I expected.

989223,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000FFL2G6,Kevin Killian,"[0, 0]","16 Blocks is the story of one man, Eddie Bunker, and his dreams of creating a top of the line bakery with a specialization in cakes for children, and what happens to those dreams when you're about to testify to a grand jury about six of New York City's dirtiest cops?  As one who has held on to my own cake-related dream for many years, I certainly got a charge out of this story, see what happens when Hollywood finally throws some big budget writers, stars and SUPERMAN director Richard Donner into a movie celebrating baking and our primal need for cake.  Like Sofia Coppola's recent revisionist MARIE ANTOINETTE with Kirsten Dunst, 16 BLOCKS makes eating cake a beautiful thing, a sensual celebration of the best our palates have to offer.Mos Def does a great job in the difficult Eddie Bunker part, showing how a man from the ghetto gets his life turned around by a casual encounter in prison; after a long ""collar"" of armed robbery, petty theft, car boosting and multiple larceny convictions he makes one simple cake for the child of a friend, whips up his own interpretation of Bugs Bunny and colors it atop the mounds of buttercream frosting, and there you go.  Mos Def's face, ordinarily sad as though weighed down by all the miseries of his race, lights up as he recalls the shared pleasure of father and child when he unveiled the seminal cake, and Bruce Willis, in a supporting role as a heavy drinking cop with an urge to protect Eddie (perhaps the son he never had), listens intently, wearing an inappropriate, rueful smile: the same smile he employs in all of his more serious roles.CAKE SPOILERS AHEAD.I won't be spoiling anyone's enjoyment of the film when I tell you that the present day action climaxes in the creation of an astonishing cake celebrating not only Mos Def and Bruce Willis, but also two legendary soul men, Chuck Berry and Barry White.

In general, I find action movies involving crooked cops all have the same story to tell and it's usually done badly.  Not so with this suspense-filled drama.  Bruce Willis plays a overweight, alcoholic detective who is tasked with dropping off a witness at the courthouse just 16 blocks from his precinct.  It seems an easy enough task until people start coming out of the woodwork trying to kill his witness, played by Mos Def.  I didn't expect too much, but I have to say that Mos Def is one of the few musicians turned actors who can actually do both well.  His chemistry on screen with Bruce Willis was a huge part of what makes this film worth watching.This movie was full of twists and turns and every time I thought I might know what was going to happen, something happened to change my opinion.  The DVD also includes an alternate ending and I can't decide which I like better.

989227,A2ICI500LRO01K,B000FFL2G6,Kyle Wells,"[2, 3]","It must be getting quite difficult for directors like Richard Donner, who specialize in the police action film, to come up with new ideas for movies these days. The 1980s and, to a lesser extent, 90s were so saturated with cop movies (some good, some less so) that to now present anything that an audience has not seen time and time again takes some kind of extreme ingenuity. Donner, whose own ""Lethal Weapon"" films set the high water mark for cop movies (the first two anyways), tries with ""16 Blocks"" to present a cop film that is both exciting and emotionally engaging, but does so with only marginal success. Donner attempts to elevate this otherwise standard action film by way of this emotional element, but unfortunately relies on a certain level of audience empathy towards the characters that is never fully obtained. Some quality acting and a generous helping of thrilling action somewhat save the film, but for the most part the results fail to surpass a level of mediocrity.The movie is about an aging, alcoholic detective named Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis) who reluctantly agrees to work overtime to transport a prisoner to court. The prisoner (Mos Def) is scheduled to testify before a grand jury before a certain time, a deadline which Mosley fails to meet as both he and his prisoner are attacked en route. The set-up is fairly simple and perhaps a bit rushed, but the crux of Donner's film is the relationship that somewhat develops between Jack and Eddie as they fight and sneak their way through the streets of New York towards the court house. As far as originality is concerned ""16 Blocks"" isn't paving any new ground. The cops-as-bad-guys thing has been seen before, recently in ""Assault on Precinct 13"", and the arguments in the film over corruption and loyalty are quite hackneyed. Where Donner does try to stretch his dramatic wings is in the relationship between the Willis an Def characters and his comments on the possibilities for both social and personal change. We are asked by the end of the film to have a deep caring for these two characters and their struggles, but due to a rather rushed feel to the movie and a general emotional detachment from action films, this is only marginally achieved.One of the virtues of the film is that acting, especially the delightfully playful and yet succinct performance of Mos Def. Whether Def would be able to bring anything to a larger, more demanding role remains to be seen, but to a basic character in a basic movie Def brings surprising talent. I especially enjoy his voice, which despite relying a bit heavily on a stereotypical Chappelle-esque crack tone, still utilizes the colourful mumbles and lazy eloquence that have served Def well as an MC. Def's energy in his role helps the film immensely, and it is thanks to his efforts that a scene such as that in which Eddie attempts to comfort the passengers of a bus that he and Jack have stormed achieves the level of emotion that Donner desires. Willis is typically good as well, looking quite at home in a cop film, but willing to tackle a character far removed from his usual roles. David Morse is also notably enjoyable as the corrupt cop and head bandito of the film, bringing a certain amount of interest to an otherwise stock character.All said ""16 Blocks"" is a mediocre film. A rather standard set-up and uninspired scenario is brought some life through notable performances and some aptly directed action. The level of audience emotion the film strives for, and ultimately relies on, is not found, but there is enough talent being displayed in the film that the effort can not be entirely unappreciated.",3,"Good Performances, Mediocre Movie",1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,3640,"['must', 'be', 'getting', 'quite', 'difficult', 'directors', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'who', 'specialize', 'police', 'action', 'film', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'ideas', 'movies', 'days', '1980s', 'lesser', 'extent', '90s', 'were', 'so', 'saturated', 'cop', 'movies', 'good', 'less', 'so', 'now', 'present', 'anything', 'audience', 'not', 'seen', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'kind', 'extreme', 'ingenuity', 'Donner', 'own', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'films', 'set', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'cop', 'movies', 'first', 'two', 'anyways', '16', 'Blocks', 'present', 'cop', 'film', 'exciting', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'so', 'only', 'marginal', 'success', 'Donner', 'elevate', 'otherwise', 'standard', 'action', 'film', 'way', 'emotional', 'element', 'unfortunately', 'certain', 'level', 'audience', 'empathy', 'characters', 'never', 'fully', 'obtained', 'quality', 'acting', 'generous', 'helping', 'thrilling', 'action', 'somewhat', 'save', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'results', 'fail', 'surpass', 'level', 'mediocrity.The', 'movie', 'aging', 'alcoholic', 'detective', 'named', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'work', 'overtime', 'transport', 'prisoner', 'court', 'prisoner', 'Mos', 'Def', 'scheduled', 'testify', 'grand', 'jury', 'certain', 'time', 'deadline', 'Mosley', 'meet', 'prisoner', 'are', 'attacked', 'route', 'set-up', 'fairly', 'simple', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'rushed', 'crux', 'Donner', 'film', 'relationship', 'somewhat', 'Jack', 'Eddie', 'fight', 'sneak', 'way', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'court', 'house', 'As', 'far', 'originality', 'concerned', '16', 'Blocks', ""n't"", 'paving', 'new', 'ground', 'cops-as-bad-guys', 'thing', 'been', 'seen', 'recently', 'Assault', 'Precinct', '13', 'arguments', 'film', 'corruption', 'loyalty', 'are', 'quite', 'hackneyed', 'Where', 'Donner', 'try', 'stretch', 'dramatic', 'wings', 'relationship', 'Willis', 'Def', 'characters', 'comments', 'possibilities', 'social', 'personal', 'change', 'are', 'asked', 'end', 'film', 'have', 'deep', 'caring', 'two', 'characters', 'struggles', 'due', 'rather', 'rushed', 'feel', 'movie', 'general', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'action', 'films', 'only', 'marginally', 'achieved.One', 'virtues', 'film', 'acting', 'especially', 'delightfully', 'playful', 'yet', 'succinct', 'performance', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Whether', 'Def', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'bring', 'anything', 'larger', 'more', 'demanding', 'role', 'be', 'seen', 'basic', 'character', 'basic', 'movie', 'Def', 'surprising', 'talent', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'voice', 'relying', 'bit', 'heavily', 'stereotypical', 'Chappelle-esque', 'crack', 'tone', 'still', 'colourful', 'mumbles', 'lazy', 'eloquence', 'have', 'served', 'Def', 'well', 'MC', 'Def', 'energy', 'role', 'film', 'immensely', 'thanks', 'efforts', 'scene', 'such', 'Eddie', 'attempts', 'comfort', 'passengers', 'bus', 'Jack', 'have', 'stormed', 'level', 'emotion', 'Donner', 'desires', 'Willis', 'typically', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'looking', 'quite', 'home', 'cop', 'film', 'willing', 'tackle', 'character', 'far', 'removed', 'usual', 'roles', 'David', 'Morse', 'also', 'notably', 'enjoyable', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'head', 'bandito', 'film', 'bringing', 'certain', 'amount', 'interest', 'otherwise', 'stock', 'character.All', 'said', '16', 'Blocks', 'mediocre', 'film', 'rather', 'standard', 'set-up', 'uninspired', 'scenario', 'brought', 'life', 'notable', 'performances', 'aptly', 'directed', 'action', 'level', 'audience', 'emotion', 'film', 'strives', 'ultimately', 'relies', 'not', 'found', 'enough', 'talent', 'being', 'displayed', 'film', 'effort', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'unappreciated']",N/A

989231,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000FFL2G6,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 3]","Sometimes I like formulaic cop movies.  They allow me to relax, not think too deeply, and not feel any real emotions.  That's generally why I chose to watch this 2006 film, 16 Blocks.  It's silly.  There's a lot of guys shooting at each other.  And I could be assured of a pleasant ending.  Well, I didn't expect much from this film and I was definitely correct.  I was mostly bored but kept watching anyway.  I guess that's saying something about me.Anyway, Bruce Willis is cast as an aging cop with a drinking problem.  He's supposed to take a prisoner to testify in front of the grand jury.  It's only 16 blocks away and he has two hours to get there.  Naturally, this is not as simple as it seems.  Mos Def is cast as the prisoner and he's absolutely great in the part.  He talks nonstop, tries to make jokes, expresses fear and surprise and every other emotion known to humankind.  It's a truly great performance and he shines as at actor.  It's just too bad that the plot is so convoluted that, after a while, all I could do was count the minutes till the end of the film.In addition to Mos Def's acting, another thing I did like about the film was the location and the cinematography.  Many of the street scenes are shot in the downtown area near where I live and the film captured the Chinatown area with its narrow crowded streets perfectly.  I've walked on these streets many times and during the summer tourist months the crowds are so thick that you can't help being in physical contact with the people walking next to you.  Naturally, the chase scenes with this background were rather interesting.Basically, this film is a time waster and you have to be in the mood for it.  I can't really recommend it unless you just want to veg out and be mindless for awhile.  But that, I think, was what the filmmakers intended.",3,Mos Def's performance is great in this mind numbing formulaic cop film,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,1829,"['Sometimes', 'like', 'formulaic', 'cop', 'movies', 'allow', 'relax', 'not', 'think', 'too', 'deeply', 'not', 'feel', 'real', 'emotions', 'generally', 'why', 'chose', 'watch', '2006', 'film', '16', 'Blocks', 'silly', 'lot', 'guys', 'shooting', 'other', 'could', 'be', 'assured', 'pleasant', 'ending', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'correct', 'was', 'mostly', 'bored', 'kept', 'watching', 'anyway', 'guess', 'saying', 'something', 'me.Anyway', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'cast', 'aging', 'cop', 'drinking', 'problem', 'supposed', 'take', 'prisoner', 'testify', 'front', 'grand', 'jury', 'only', '16', 'blocks', 'away', 'two', 'hours', 'get', 'there', 'Naturally', 'not', 'as', 'simple', 'Mos', 'Def', 'cast', 'prisoner', 'absolutely', 'great', 'part', 'nonstop', 'tries', 'make', 'jokes', 'expresses', 'fear', 'surprise', 'other', 'emotion', 'known', 'humankind', 'truly', 'great', 'performance', 'as', 'actor', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'plot', 'so', 'convoluted', 'while', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'count', 'minutes', 'till', 'end', 'film.In', 'addition', 'Mos', 'Def', 'acting', 'thing', 'did', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'location', 'cinematography', 'Many', 'street', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'downtown', 'area', 'where', 'live', 'film', 'captured', 'Chinatown', 'area', 'narrow', 'crowded', 'streets', 'perfectly', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'streets', 'many', 'times', 'summer', 'tourist', 'months', 'crowds', 'are', 'so', 'thick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'physical', 'contact', 'people', 'walking', 'next', 'Naturally', 'chase', 'background', 'were', 'rather', 'interesting.Basically', 'film', 'time', 'waster', 'have', 'be', 'mood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'just', 'want', 'veg', 'out', 'be', 'mindless', 'awhile', 'think', 'was', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'intended']",N/A

989237,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000FFL2G6,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Bruce Willis is one of the many unheralded actors who works consistently in film and yet never seems to be recognized for his work. Granted his work doesn't include parts in Shakespearian dramas, but his portrayals of everymen and heroes have made him box office dynamite. Such wasn't particularly the case with the film SIXTEEN BLOCKS, which is sad since he tries to combine his past heroic type characters with a more aged hero here.Willis stars as Jack Mosley, an aging New York police detective with a bad leg and a penchant for dipping into the bottle more often than not. As he heads home after a long shift, his lieutenant asks him to do one small chore, escort prisoner Eddie Bunker (Mos Deff) downtown to give testimony to a grand jury, only sixteen blocks away. Mosley reluctantly agrees and in so doing sets himself up for one long journey not only physically but emotionally as well.Stopping on the way to pick up a bottle, Mosley prevents a would be assassin from killing Eddie. After that the film picks up speed as the two try and find a way to get downtown. They meet up with a set of other officers and Mosley starts to realize just who it is that Eddie is supposed to testify against. The bad cops, including Mosley's ex partner Frank Nugent (David Morse), try to convince him to see their side and turn Eddie over to them. But Mosley has a moment of clarity where he knows what his job is and what he has to do.The duo find their way out of this initial face down and move inch by inch, block by block on their way to the courthouse. Before films end more is revealed about Eddie and his hopes to turn his life around from one of crime to one where he owns his own bakery. And Mosley? Mosley reveals to Eddie his most inner secret while at the same time trying to do the right thing.Mos Deff as Eddie plays it perfect, speaking in one of the most annoying, nasal sounding voiced I've heard on screen. You can believe that this is a little guy hoping to make things better. And Willis is great, offering a side that is seldom seen not only in characters like Jack Mosley but from an actor willing to allow himself to be seen as an un-youthful hero. Jack has been around, done things he regrets and now has the chance to make up for it. He's a beaten man but not down for the count. And for an actor to take this challenge of showing that in a nod of the head, in the twinkle of an eye, is not an easy task to accomplish. Willis does so here and does it well.I wasn't sure I would like this movie. I wondered if the portrayal of dirty cops in New York had been played out over the past 30 years and had become clich&eacute; ridden. Such is not the case in this film. Director Richard Donner, who has always excelled with action films, shows that he still has what it takes to just get actors to do their best, but to take viewers on a rollercoaster ride that holds you until the last moment of revelation involving the characters is offered.

989243,A2BON03VAFS1SZ,B000FFL2G6,Michael Fishman,"[0, 0]","Not the best movie I've seen, but since I'm a Bruce Willis fan, also not the worst.Bruce Willis plays a John McLane-type character about 20 years in the future. He's an aging cop who's now rundown, out of shape, depressed (probably with the silly-looking mustache he's wearing) and overweight, but he's still tough. He's assigned the task of escorting a witness 16 blocks from the jail to the courthouse which is where all the movie's action takes place. The movie is filled with one dimensional characters and is pretty predictable from beginning to end, but what really bothered me the most about the movie was a nugget of information that was revealed at the end of the movie. Had this little bit of information been revealed early in the movie, there wouldn't have been a need for the movie because nothing would have had to happen. To me, that's just cheap writing that doesn't take into consideration the fact that viewers have a brain. Either that, or maybe they know the movie's pretty boring to begin with and no one's really paying that much attention?16 Blocks comes with an alternate ending which was apparently the original ending, but was changed to the version shown in theaters. I think they made the right decision with the version they chose.This is not the movie to pick if you're looking for a good cop movie. There've been so many cop movies made before this one that are much, much better, but it's still not the worst one ever made and it did have a nice emotional aspect that seems to be missing in most cop/action movies.

989244,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000FFL2G6,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","I'm a sucker for ""prop"" dramas, the kind that feature a popular actor in a peculiar situation, like Colin Farrell in a Phone Booth. Here we have Bruce Willis traveling 16 Blocks. The comparison between the two is apt because both take place in a finite space and both take place in New York City.  Except, you know, 16 Blocks was actually filmed there.The beauty of these prop dramas is that they're so simple to understand: Detective Jack Mosley (Willis) has to travel 16 blocks to protect his charge (Mos Def as Eddie Bunker).  Mosley is a broken down drunk nearing retirement, and he has the misfortune of shepherding a key witness who is about to take down a cabal of corrupt NYPD cops. This sets a host of assassins, hitmen, and cops on Bunker's trail, led by Detective Frank Nugent (chilly David Morse).The plot takes a bit to gather steam and suffers, almost immediately, from a flaw nearly as crippling as Mosley's limp: Eddie Bunker.  Mos Def chose to use a whiny voice reminiscent of Mike Tyson.  If you think listening to a Tyson interview is tough, imagine listening to him for 105 minutes. It's almost enough to make you turn the movie off.But if you stick with it, there's some old-fashioned character acting to admire.  For the first half of the film Mosley barely speaks, which keeps his motives appropriately mysterious.  When he does speak, we learn that he's not much better than the corrupt cops who stalk him. And so ensues a game of cat-and-mouse as Willis, playing a broken-down version of John McClane from the Die Hard series, once again shows that the old lion still has some teeth in him.The rest of the film consists of banter.  At heart is the question of whether or not a man can change.  If he can, does he deserve a second chance?  The two characters go about sharing their answers differently.  Bunker talks and talks and talks, while Mosley just does what he does best. In between shootouts and car chases, Nugent provides a counterargument to their high-minded ideals with his own speeches.  When 16 Blocks is good, its actors are at the top of their game.But eventually Mosley runs out of blocks. 16 Blocks, like so many prop dramas, has to do some acrobatics to earn its happy ending. The conclusion is pretty much what you might expect from a likable villain who is fond of pontificating about his illegal activities.  It's a fun ride. I just wish Bunker didn't have to talk on the way over.",3,"I get it, people can change, now PLEASE SHUT UP",1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,2429,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'prop', 'dramas', 'kind', 'feature', 'popular', 'actor', 'peculiar', 'situation', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Here', 'have', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'traveling', '16', 'Blocks', 'comparison', 'two', 'apt', 'take', 'place', 'finite', 'space', 'take', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'know', '16', 'Blocks', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'there.The', 'beauty', 'prop', 'dramas', ""'re"", 'so', 'simple', 'understand', 'Detective', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'Willis', 'travel', '16', 'blocks', 'protect', 'charge', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Eddie', 'Bunker', 'Mosley', 'broken', 'down', 'drunk', 'nearing', 'retirement', 'misfortune', 'shepherding', 'key', 'witness', 'who', 'take', 'down', 'cabal', 'corrupt', 'NYPD', 'cops', 'host', 'assassins', 'hitmen', 'cops', 'Bunker', 'trail', 'led', 'Detective', 'Frank', 'Nugent', 'chilly', 'David', 'Morse', '.The', 'plot', 'bit', 'gather', 'steam', 'suffers', 'almost', 'immediately', 'flaw', 'nearly', 'as', 'crippling', 'Mosley', 'limp', 'Eddie', 'Bunker', 'Mos', 'Def', 'chose', 'use', 'whiny', 'voice', 'reminiscent', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'think', 'listening', 'Tyson', 'interview', 'tough', 'imagine', 'listening', '105', 'minutes', 'almost', 'enough', 'make', 'turn', 'movie', 'off.But', 'stick', 'old-fashioned', 'character', 'acting', 'admire', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Mosley', 'barely', 'motives', 'appropriately', 'mysterious', 'When', 'speak', 'learn', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'who', 'stalk', 'so', 'ensues', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'Willis', 'playing', 'broken-down', 'version', 'John', 'McClane', 'Die', 'Hard', 'series', 'once', 'again', 'old', 'lion', 'still', 'teeth', 'him.The', 'rest', 'film', 'banter', 'heart', 'question', 'not', 'man', 'can', 'change', 'can', 'deserve', 'second', 'chance', 'two', 'characters', 'go', 'sharing', 'answers', 'differently', 'Bunker', 'talks', 'talks', 'talks', 'Mosley', 'just', 'what', 'best', 'shootouts', 'car', 'chases', 'Nugent', 'counterargument', 'high-minded', 'ideals', 'own', 'speeches', 'When', '16', 'Blocks', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'game.But', 'eventually', 'Mosley', 'blocks', '16', 'Blocks', 'so', 'many', 'prop', 'dramas', 'do', 'acrobatics', 'earn', 'happy', 'ending', 'conclusion', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'likable', 'villain', 'who', 'fond', 'pontificating', 'illegal', 'activities', 'fun', 'ride', 'just', 'wish', 'Bunker', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'talk', 'way']",N/A

Bruce Willis stars as a burned out cop who finds himself escorting a fast talking witness (Mos Def) who is set to testify against crooked cops; one of which (David Morse) will do anything to make sure he doesn't reach his destination.  While it has some nicely done action set pieces, and Willis and Mos Def give serviceable performances (even though Def borderlines on annoying), there's nothing really memorable about 16 Blocks.  There's no shocks or twists or anything really to keep you interested.  The storyline is predictable and it's easy to figure out what's going to happen next, and how it will all end.  Director Richard Donner, coming off the debacle that was Timeline, is in fine form in the controled yet chaotic environment that he made a name for himself in, but he's done better.  The most interesting feature of the DVD itself is the alternate ending, which would have been a welcome change of pace for the film and would have set it apart from the rest of the flock, but in the end the studio had the last word.

Gregg,"[0, 1]","This was actually a good STORY and Bruce turns in a fantastic performance - however in order to realize this was a good story and it was worth watching, you have to do some suffering.Bruce is a used up cop - lost in the bottle, putting in time basically. He is given an ""easy"" assignment of escorting a paroled convict to court. Enter 1st thing you have to ""suffer"" - the convict has the most nasal horrible voice and he just won't shut up through the whole movie. VERY very annoying.Turns out this convict is going to court to testify against at least 6 other bad cops - going high up - and they aren't about to let him make his court date. Bruce sees this and determines to get that guy safely to the court on time, though it seems to be a lost cause at every turn.The 2nd thing you have to ""suffer"" while watching this movie is that the main ""bad"" cop (David Morse) is constantly chewing a small piece of gum throughout this movie (which I think may be a habit of his since I've noticed this in other movies he was in) and while I've seen much more obnoxious gum chewing, I still found this extremely annoying - and between the nasal non-stop voice and the gum chewing I almost walked away from this movie.  No kidding.If you can ignore/tolerate those 2 things, then this movie will be a good one for you. Bruce's character (as always) is constantly in danger and finding himself in no-win situations - but (as always) he always manages to squeek out them by using his smarts his courage.  For me, even with the ""suffering"" the last 15 minutes of this movie made it all worthwhile and made me want to recommend this movie.  If however, you think those 2 things might also annoy the heck out of you - there are many more Bruce Willis movies for you to enjoy.

989252,A70YTUFJY5HXN,B000FFL2G6,Olukayode Balogun,"[0, 0]","On the face of it, this should've been a simple story of a straightfoward affair. Bleary-eyed down-on-his-luck alcoholic detective Jack Mosley (played by Bruce Willis) has to get a similarly down-on-his-luck witness Eddie Bunker (played by Mos Def) 16 Blocks from a holding cell to a courthouse to testify against some corrupt cops. Needless to say, not everyone wants to see Eddie Bunker spill the beans and thus the hunt is on to kill him en route. Jack seems to come out of his booze haze to summon the wits to come up with all kinds of tricks to ensure Bunker's safety.I love David Morse and it was so much fun to see him play one of the dirty cops on the hunt. The story is not as straightforward as is suggested in the beginning and there are unexpected twists and turns amidst the action and mayhem that ensure in Manhattan.I've been watching Mos Def's emergence as a serious actor now for some time. I always knew he had the chops, I just kept wondering when we were going to see him displaying them. He demonstrated his potential for range recently in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and while the movie was fun, he was the only reason why I watched it. I believe that it's here, in ""16 Blocks"" that he comes into his own, sharing indeed as he does, top billing with Willis. His motormouth performance as Eddie is something to watch, especially for those who have seen him in other movies or in interviews talking about his music. They will know that he is nothing like the chatty character with the whiny voice he plays to excruciating annoyance - but maybe that was the whole point. The character is obviously supposed to be annoying.While bedlam surrounds them, it's the growing friendship between the two leads that drives this movie for me. The end moved me to tears. Maybe I'm just a silly old man but the sheer purity of a friendship that's based on nothing else but a common humanity is something that always warms my heart and sadly, something I don't get to see much anymore in a world where everyone seems to have a hidden agenda.This is a fun movie and shouldn't really be taken on as anything more than that. The grey tones of the cinematography suggest a Manhattan that is still feeling a bit bleak post-9/11 but I'm not sure any further social commentary is being made here. Anyway, I like the movie because it is a well written story, with great characters and strong acting from both the leads and their supporting cast.

Willis must have that realization cemented within his own core to portray that character so well. So totally does Willis succeed that you are pulling for Mosley (Willis),and for me that is a great moment when I feel like jumping out my seat and applauding. Ok confession number two I am also a big Mos Def fan. I actually don't know who did a better job Mos or Willis.

989263,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000FFL2G6,RMurray847,"[5, 6]","Bruce Willis is the master of the world-weary blue collar guy, mostly cops.  He's built perfectly for it, with his minimal hair, his physique and mostly his well-lived in face.  By modulating himself a little bit, he can be the worn-out but still decent lead in HOSTAGE or the worn-out, seedy, alcoholic ""hero"" of 16 BLOCKS.  He's done this sort of part for so long...PULP FICTION was in many ways the start...his washed-up, punch-drunk boxer was a great role.  Even his more heroic roles, such as in DIE HARD...in which he's not called upon to be world-weary are infused with a tiredness and a nearly palbable feeling of ""I just want this to be over so I can take a nap!""  Other actors try this bit...Kurt Russell in recent years springs to mind, or Ray Liotta in NARC...but Willis is the current master.  He has no ego coming to the front of his performances.  I would assume that Willis is comfortable enough in his own skin, with his own accomplishments and with his wealth that he doesn't care how bad he looks in a role.  He's a solid actor (not brilliant, but solid) who has found the niche he belongs in.In 16 BLOCKS, his cop is a drunk, and a corrupt drunk at that.  He's clearly at the end of his rope...propped up by his fellow cops with simple chores such as sitting at a crime scene until the ""uniforms get here.""  Pretty bad when a detective is holding a crime scene for the uniformed cops...who will then no doubt turn it over to detectives who can still function.  Willis is given the chore of escorting a witness (MOS DEF) just 16 blocks away to the courthouse, where he must appear in two hours or less to testify before a grand jury.The plan is that Mos Def will be killed, and the hapless Willis won't be able to stop it.  But Willis, much to his own suprise, thwarts the first attempt, and then must go on the run with his charge.  I'm not spoiling much to say that the people who want Def killed are cops themselves, and under the leadership of the always strong and oily David Morse, begin to tighten the noose on Willis.Mos Def's character, a petty crook with aspirations to become a bakery chef (of all things...don't ask), is a fast talking guy who just can't shut up, even when his silence would be really helpful.  He doesn't believe Willis can protect him, and he works hard to get away.  Willis understands the depths of his dilemna, and finally forges a team of sorts with Def.  Mos Def was amusing in HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, and he's very different but still quite good here.  He and Willis make a very odd couple indeed.If you're looking for a movie with lots of action...you'll be disappointed.  There are some modest shoot-outs and chases, but it's mostly a game of wits and a game of waiting.  We get to see Willis and others THINKING about what they are doing or should do.  It's an exciting movie, but in a tense, low-key way...not in a DIE HARD way.The film builds to something of a predictable and perhaps not entirely believable conclusion.  I won't say what happens, but the movie does teeter on the edge of TV movie sappiness.  What saves it is that we've invested a lot in the two main characters, and while I rolled my eyes a little at how things fell into place...I was also relieved at how it all ended up.  The movie isn't saying anything terribly new or earth-shattering.  But it is offering up a gritty, contained and very tense scenario that is fun to get caught up in.  And with Bruce Willis as the anchor, the film rises to higher level.  I recommend the movie.For parents, there is some bad language.  The violence is really not much worse than you'd see on a TV action show.  On the other hand, kids might be a bit bored by a movie that tells the story on its own terms...not on typical Hollywood smash-'em-up terms.",4,The fine art of World-Weariness perfected!,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,3781,"['Bruce', 'Willis', 'master', 'world-weary', 'blue', 'collar', 'guy', 'mostly', 'built', 'perfectly', 'minimal', 'hair', 'physique', 'mostly', 'well-lived', 'face', 'modulating', 'little', 'bit', 'can', 'be', 'worn-out', 'still', 'decent', 'lead', 'HOSTAGE', 'worn-out', 'seedy', 'alcoholic', 'hero', '16', 'BLOCKS', 'done', 'sort', 'part', 'so', 'long', 'PULP', 'FICTION', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'start', 'washed-up', 'punch-drunk', 'boxer', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'Even', 'more', 'heroic', 'roles', 'such', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'not', 'called', 'upon', 'be', 'world-weary', 'are', 'infused', 'tiredness', 'nearly', 'palbable', 'feeling', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'so', 'can', 'take', 'nap', 'Other', 'actors', 'try', 'bit', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'recent', 'years', 'mind', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'NARC', 'Willis', 'current', 'master', 'ego', 'coming', 'front', 'performances', 'would', 'assume', 'Willis', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'own', 'skin', 'own', 'accomplishments', 'wealth', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'bad', 'role', 'solid', 'actor', 'not', 'brilliant', 'solid', 'who', 'found', 'niche', 'in.In', '16', 'BLOCKS', 'cop', 'drunk', 'corrupt', 'drunk', 'clearly', 'end', 'rope', 'propped', 'up', 'fellow', 'cops', 'simple', 'chores', 'such', 'sitting', 'crime', 'scene', 'uniforms', 'get', 'here', 'Pretty', 'bad', 'when', 'detective', 'holding', 'crime', 'scene', 'uniformed', 'cops', 'who', 'will', 'then', 'doubt', 'turn', 'detectives', 'who', 'can', 'still', 'function', 'Willis', 'given', 'chore', 'escorting', 'witness', 'MOS', 'DEF', 'just', '16', 'blocks', 'away', 'courthouse', 'where', 'must', 'appear', 'two', 'hours', 'less', 'testify', 'grand', 'jury.The', 'plan', 'Mos', 'Def', 'will', 'be', 'killed', 'hapless', 'Willis', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'Willis', 'much', 'own', 'suprise', 'first', 'attempt', 'then', 'must', 'go', 'run', 'charge', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'much', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'Def', 'killed', 'are', 'cops', 'leadership', 'always', 'strong', 'oily', 'David', 'Morse', 'begin', 'tighten', 'noose', 'Willis.Mos', 'Def', 'character', 'petty', 'crook', 'aspirations', 'become', 'bakery', 'chef', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'fast', 'talking', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shut', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'silence', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'helpful', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Willis', 'can', 'protect', 'hard', 'get', 'away', 'Willis', 'depths', 'dilemna', 'finally', 'team', 'sorts', 'Def', 'Mos', 'Def', 'was', 'amusing', 'HITCHHIKER', 'GUIDE', 'TO', 'THE', 'GALAXY', 'very', 'different', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'Willis', 'make', 'very', 'odd', 'couple', 'indeed.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'modest', 'shoot-outs', 'chases', 'mostly', 'game', 'wits', 'game', 'waiting', 'get', 'see', 'Willis', 'others', 'THINKING', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'should', 'do', 'exciting', 'movie', 'tense', 'low-key', 'way', 'not', 'DIE', 'HARD', 'way.The', 'film', 'builds', 'something', 'predictable', 'perhaps', 'not', 'entirely', 'believable', 'conclusion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'movie', 'teeter', 'edge', 'TV', 'movie', 'sappiness', 'What', ""'ve"", 'invested', 'lot', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'little', 'how', 'things', 'fell', 'place', 'was', 'also', 'relieved', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'movie', ""n't"", 'saying', 'anything', 'terribly', 'new', 'earth-shattering', 'offering', 'up', 'gritty', 'contained', 'very', 'tense', 'scenario', 'fun', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'anchor', 'film', 'higher', 'level', 'recommend', 'movie.For', 'parents', 'bad', 'language', 'violence', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'worse', ""'d"", 'see', 'TV', 'action', 'show', 'other', 'hand', 'kids', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'bored', 'movie', 'story', 'own', 'terms', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', ""smash-'em-up"", 'terms']",N/A

of a washed up old cop named Jack Mosley(Bruce Willis).This is a beaten down man,with years of run of the mill details,with a career in stall and with a drinking problem.Just as Jack is about to book off after a long night at a baby sitting job at a crime scene,he is given a surprise detail.He is to take one witness ,Eddie Bunker(Mos Def),16 Blocks from the precinct to the courthouse,as the grand jury awaits his testimony.Before he goes too far, Jack pulls his car up to a local liquor store to grab a picker-upper and some Advil.Unbeknownst to Jack and his charge,both have been followed from the get go by assassins out to kill Eddie.While Jack is busy inside an assassin comes up to the rear window asking Eddie to put down the window but a cuffed Eddie can't comply.He pulls out his gun and a shot rings out.Jack has, by chance,come out and seen what was happening and has killed the assassin.However a remaining assasin opens up on them and they both barely manage to escape.They take refuge in a local bar Jack frequents and a call for back up goes in.Detectives arrive led by Frank Nugent played brilliantly and coldly by actor David Morse.All seems fine until we realize these cops are not the ""marines"" but the bad guys.We learn Eddie is to testify against said cops but they want Jack just to look the other way as they dispose of him.Before they can carry it out Jack intervenes and both he and Eddie are on the run from the bad cops and the rest of the NYPD.Their escape attempts take them into some of the most seedy places of New York,both low and high,with the bad cops on their heels every step of the way.The films keeps a relentless pace of tension throughout.Jack and Eddie get into some hair-raising and seemingly impossible escape situations and just barely manage to come out of them;and both receive gun shot wounds along the treacherous paths they must ineveitably follow.As the picture progresses more details of just how deep the corruption of the force is, are revealed.In the end we find out,to our surprise, that even Jack himself was deeply involved with the bad cops and that Eddies' testimony could have put him away with the rest.Jack had always looked the other way in the past,but seeing the mechanism of corruption up close and personal for the first time,it finally twigged his conscious and he couldn't ignore things any longer.Before he reaches the courthouse with Eddie,and after a smart exchange between ambulances,he lets Eddie go.He decides he will take his place.Eddie is free and Jack carries on to the courthouse and gets his evidence to the grand jury just barely before the 10 O'Clock deadline.This DVD is presented in the original theatrical version and also comes with a shot but never shown alternate ending.Both are great to have for comparisons sake,and both are equally compelling endings and make good fodder for discussion as to which is ultimately the more satisfying.The DVD also presents you with deleted scenes all with commentary by Richard Donner and his director.All in all this film is a VERY satisfying and tension filled thrill ride that shows you just how much excitment can be packed into a 16

989265,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FFL2G6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 2]","16 Blocks (Richard Donner, 2006)At last, I have solid evidence of a hypothesis that I have long had: it is, in fact, possible that a film's theatrical ending is a stronger, better one than the ""shocking!"" alternate ending that you know they filmed just for the DVD release. It is unfortunate, however, that I finally find it at the end of what may be the least original piece of paint-by-numbers thriller-making I've seen in quite a while. Which is doubly depressing given that it came from the mighty Richard Donner.The plot is quick and easy: Jack Mosley, an alcoholic cop (Bruce Willis), is chosen to escort a prisoner (Mos Def) to the courthouse in New York to testify. Cue Murphy's Law, because it seems no one else in the entire city of New York wants them to get to the courthouse on time. This leads to a large number of chases, guns going off, and thins blowing up.Donner has managed, over the years, to come up with some of Hollywood's finest merchandise: The Omen, Lethal Weapon, and especially Inside Moves, the film that marked the debut of David Morse. But even pairing Donner and Morse again can't make this turkey fly. And that's a shame, because the cast turn in good performances. It's good to see Willis, who popped up in both this and Sin City in 2006, getting his feet back under him as an actor, and David Morse is always a pleasure to watch. Mos Def does what he can with his role, but it's not as meaty as Willis' or Morse's; he was much more impressive in The Woodsman a few years ago.There's a debate raging over this movie at IMDB, with those who liked it defending it by saying that it's your basic eighties action movie. And they're right-- that's the problem. It's a run-of-the-mill eighties action flick-- exactly the kind of thing Donner was trying not to do when he made Lethal Weapon. How is it that he succeeded so grandly in 1987, only to come back around and make the exact movie he didn't want to make twenty years later? We may never know. ** ",3,"Murtaugh and Riggs, phone home.",1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,1982,"['16', 'Blocks', 'Richard', 'Donner', '2006', 'last', 'have', 'solid', 'evidence', 'hypothesis', 'have', 'long', 'had', 'fact', 'possible', 'film', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'stronger', 'better', 'one', 'shocking', 'alternate', 'ending', 'know', 'filmed', 'just', 'DVD', 'release', 'unfortunate', 'however', 'finally', 'find', 'end', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'original', 'piece', 'paint-by-numbers', 'thriller-making', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'Which', 'doubly', 'depressing', 'given', 'came', 'mighty', 'Richard', 'Donner.The', 'plot', 'quick', 'easy', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'alcoholic', 'cop', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'chosen', 'escort', 'prisoner', 'Mos', 'Def', 'courthouse', 'New', 'York', 'testify', 'Cue', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'one', 'else', 'entire', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'courthouse', 'time', 'large', 'number', 'chases', 'guns', 'going', 'off', 'thins', 'blowing', 'up.Donner', 'managed', 'years', 'come', 'up', 'Hollywood', 'finest', 'merchandise', 'Omen', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'especially', 'Inside', 'Moves', 'film', 'marked', 'debut', 'David', 'Morse', 'even', 'pairing', 'Donner', 'Morse', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'turkey', 'fly', 'shame', 'cast', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'good', 'see', 'Willis', 'who', 'popped', 'up', 'Sin', 'City', '2006', 'getting', 'feet', 'back', 'actor', 'David', 'Morse', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Mos', 'Def', 'what', 'can', 'role', 'not', 'as', 'meaty', 'Willis', 'Morse', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'impressive', 'Woodsman', 'few', 'years', 'ago.There', 'debate', 'raging', 'movie', 'IMDB', 'who', 'liked', 'defending', 'saying', 'basic', 'eighties', 'action', 'movie', ""'re"", 'right', 'problem', 'run-of-the-mill', 'eighties', 'action', 'flick', 'exactly', 'kind', 'thing', 'Donner', 'was', 'trying', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'made', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'How', 'succeeded', 'so', 'grandly', '1987', 'only', 'come', 'back', 'make', 'exact', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'may', 'never', 'know', '**']",N/A

989267,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000FFL2G6,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 4]","**1/2""16 Blocks"" features an aging Bruce Willis as a broken-down, burned out NYPD detective assigned to transport the key witness in a police corruption trial from his jail cell to the courthouse where he is scheduled to testify 16 blocks away.  However, something goes terribly awry when the cops who are the targets of his testimony attempt to knock off the witness, forcing Willis and his charge to run for their lives through the crowded streets and deserted back alleys of downtown Manhattan.""16 Blocks"" deserves points for at least attempting to provide a bit more in the way of characterization and theme than we are used to in run-of-the-mill police procedurals, but the film winds up falling flat despite the best of intentions and some first rate performances by Willis and Mos Def as the man whose life Willis feels compelled to protect.  For even though the low-keyed approach writer Richard Wenk and director Richard Donner have taken towards the material should have made this a more believable and realistic film than most in its genre, the filmmakers keep undercutting that truth by having the two fleeing gentlemen go through so many hairbreadth escapes that we begin to think that not only are these NYPD officers corrupt but amazingly incompetent as well.  Moreover, the schmaltzy, humanity-of-man ending, with its theme of mutually achieved salvation and redemption, comes across as a contrived piece of sentimental uplift that never rings true or convincing.What's good about the movie is its occasionally witty one liners and the performances by the actors in the two lead roles.  Willis, craggy-faced, gimpy and sporting a noticeable middle-age spread, is subtle and subdued in the role of a man who has grown apathetic and cynical over the years, and Mos Def makes a very compelling character out of Eddie Bunker, the criminal-with-a-heart-of-gold who never stops talking, but whose deadpan, singsong delivery endears him to the audience.

989269,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B000FFL2G6,Scooter McGavin,"[1, 1]","Nothing says it's going to be a poor movie week at the McGavin house than seeing Bruce Willis' (Moonlighting) mug on the DVD. For the last couple years, Willis has just been collecting paycheck while new action heroes half his age not only steal the roles he used to be offered but they even started to steal his women. But in this movie, 16 Block, Willis ironically plays a worn down detective for the NYPD who gave up a while ago and years of hard living has wrecked havoc on his life and left him with a limp and a massively receding hairline. Maybe because of tenure, or out of sympathy, he has been able to keep his job even though everyone know he keeps liquor bottles in his desk. He is also routinely assigned to jobs so easy, it's an insult to give to an able-bodied colleague like watching a dead body until other authorities come to dispose of it.Another seamlessly inane chore is to deliver a witness from lockup to the courthouse sixteen blocks away. Needless to say things don't go as planned or this would have been the most boring movie since Napoleon Dynamite. Nope, instead we have another story of cops gone bad but luckily, this is revealed early on because crooked cop as the big plot twist has become a tired plot point (keep in mind the actual plot twist isn't hard to guess). And in what could be a nod to 24, the movie seems to happen in real time aside from a brief prologue as Willis only has about 140 minutes to get the felon to the courthouse as the jury gets dismissed at 10:00.The felon turned state's evidence is portrayed by rapper Mos Def (Black Head of CIA on Chappelle's Show) is captivating once you get past his ""Mike Tyson trying to imitate an Italian"" lisp. Added to the great performance is how Mos Def's character never stops talking, but Def is able to keep him from getting extremely annoying. You also have to give it up to Willis and Def, along with director Richard Donner (Superman), who keep the unlikely duo from becoming a cinema buddy flick clich&eacute; like for instance 48 Hours Donner's Lethal Weapon franchise. And with any movie like this you need a bad guy and David Morse plays this one perfectly as he never goes over the top most likely because he never seems as if he thinks Willis will ever make it to the courthouse. There are a few plot holes (like why is one of the cops Def fingered still on the force, shouldn't he be in jail or at least suspended until the result of the trial?) but as long as you let these minor hiccups go, you should be thoroughly entertained.After you watch the movie, make sure you checkout the bonus features on the DVD. There are a few deleted scenes that are commented on by Donner and screenwriter Richard Wenk that are worth watching even though they were left on the cutting room floor. Then there is an alternative ending that is actually better from a storytelling point of view, although the original ending is more satisfying. You can watch the alternative ending by itself or within the context of the movie.",4,"Days Change, Seasons Change, People Don't Change",1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,3012,"['Nothing', 'going', 'be', 'poor', 'movie', 'week', 'McGavin', 'house', 'seeing', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Moonlighting', 'mug', 'DVD', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'Willis', 'just', 'been', 'collecting', 'paycheck', 'new', 'action', 'heroes', 'age', 'not', 'only', 'steal', 'roles', 'used', 'be', 'offered', 'even', 'started', 'steal', 'women', 'movie', '16', 'Block', 'Willis', 'ironically', 'worn', 'down', 'detective', 'NYPD', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'while', 'ago', 'years', 'hard', 'living', 'wrecked', 'havoc', 'life', 'left', 'limp', 'massively', 'receding', 'hairline', 'Maybe', 'tenure', 'sympathy', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'job', 'even', 'everyone', 'know', 'liquor', 'bottles', 'desk', 'also', 'routinely', 'assigned', 'jobs', 'so', 'easy', 'insult', 'give', 'able-bodied', 'colleague', 'watching', 'dead', 'body', 'other', 'authorities', 'come', 'dispose', 'it.Another', 'seamlessly', 'inane', 'chore', 'deliver', 'witness', 'lockup', 'courthouse', 'sixteen', 'away', 'Needless', 'say', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'boring', 'movie', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Nope', 'instead', 'have', 'story', 'cops', 'gone', 'bad', 'luckily', 'revealed', 'early', 'crooked', 'cop', 'big', 'plot', 'twist', 'become', 'tired', 'plot', 'point', 'keep', 'mind', 'actual', 'plot', 'twist', ""n't"", 'hard', 'guess', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'nod', '24', 'movie', 'happen', 'real', 'time', 'aside', 'brief', 'prologue', 'Willis', 'only', '140', 'minutes', 'get', 'felon', 'courthouse', 'jury', 'dismissed', '10:00.The', 'felon', 'turned', 'state', 'evidence', 'portrayed', 'rapper', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Black', 'Head', 'CIA', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'captivating', 'once', 'get', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'trying', 'imitate', 'Italian', 'lisp', 'Added', 'great', 'performance', 'how', 'Mos', 'Def', 'character', 'never', 'talking', 'Def', 'able', 'keep', 'getting', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'Willis', 'Def', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Superman', 'who', 'keep', 'unlikely', 'duo', 'becoming', 'cinema', 'buddy', 'flick', 'clich', 'eacute', 'instance', '48', 'Hours', 'Donner', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'franchise', 'movie', 'need', 'bad', 'guy', 'David', 'Morse', 'one', 'perfectly', 'never', 'top', 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'Willis', 'will', 'ever', 'make', 'courthouse', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'why', 'one', 'cops', 'Def', 'fingered', 'still', 'force', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'jail', 'least', 'suspended', 'result', 'trial', 'as', 'long', 'let', 'minor', 'hiccups', 'go', 'should', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertained.After', 'watch', 'movie', 'make', 'sure', 'checkout', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'commented', 'Donner', 'screenwriter', 'Richard', 'Wenk', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'were', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Then', 'alternative', 'ending', 'actually', 'better', 'storytelling', 'point', 'view', 'original', 'ending', 'more', 'satisfying', 'can', 'watch', 'alternative', 'ending', 'context', 'movie']",N/A

One of his assignments is Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), a witness who has to testify before a grand jury at 10:00am.

For even though the low-keyed approach writer Richard Wenk and director Richard Donner (""Superman"", ""Lethal Weapon"") have taken towards the material should have made this a more believable and realistic film than most in its genre, the filmmakers keep undercutting that truth by having the two fleeing gentlemen go through so many hairbreadth escapes that we begin to think that not only are these NYPD officers corrupt but amazingly incompetent as well. Moreover, the schmaltzy, humanity-of-man ending, with its theme of mutually achieved salvation and redemption, comes across as a contrived piece of sentimental uplift that never rings true or convincing.What saves the film is its occasionally witty one-liners and the performances by the actors in the two lead roles. Willis, craggy-faced, gimpy and sporting a noticeable middle-age spread, is subtle and subdued in the role of a man who has grown apathetic and cynical over the years, and Mos Def makes a very compelling character out of Eddie Bunker, the criminal-with-a-heart-of-gold who never stops talking, but whose deadpan, singsong delivery endears him to the audience. The actors alone compensate for the underdeveloped script and the overall sense of ennui that permeates the film.

989278,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000FFL2G6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","Jack Mosley (Bruce Willis), an alcoholic NYC detective, is handed an assignment after finishing a long night shift. They need him to transport a witness from Central Holding to his appearance in front of the Grand Jury. He has almost two hours to transport Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) approximately 16 blocks before the Grand Jury ends their session. After that, Eddie's testimony will be no good. It's the last thing Jack wants to do, he would rather go home and curl up with a bottle of scotch for the remainder of the day. But the assignment promises to be quick, so he doesn't grumble too much and heads down to holding, picks up Eddie and puts him in a car. After Jack decides to stop at a liquor store on the way, all hell breaks loose.""16 Blocks"", directed by Richard Donner (the ""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""Superman"") and starring Bruce Willis, is the movie equivalent of putting on an old pair of shoes. They are comfortable as heck, but worn out, a little ratty looking, but boy do they fit well. This is both good and bad for Willis, Donner and the viewer.Willis has played a cop in numerous films, it almost seems second nature to him. From the ""Die Hard Series"" to his recent ""Hostage"", the persona works for him. In ""Blocks"", he adds a little twist. Jack is an overweight, alcoholic who would rather do nothing than sit at a crime scene, babysitting the evidence while he drinks the deceased person's alcohol. He doesn't care about saving the world, he only cares about existing. Or does he? The answer to that question changes every few minutes of his life. There are times when Jack seems a very real character. Resting a few moments after an attempted ambush, he downs a few glasses of scotch to calm his nerves. Most people would think he might want to retain his wits. But an alcoholic calms down by drinking more. This is a very good observation of the character. But the character is an old shoe. Even with this nice observation, we have seen this person dozens, hundreds of times already. Willis has played variations on this role at least a dozen times himself. Jack offers little new for Willis and Willis offers little new for the audience.Director Richard Donner has made many action films and this is well-traveled territory for him. As the film begins and the set-up unravels, the ticking clock begins, adding a level of suspense to the film. Jack has to get Eddie sixteen blocks in less than two hours. Seems easy, even in New York, but there are, of course, complications. Even though parts of the set-up are contrived to create this `ticking clock', the director and the writer, Richard Wenk, have established the rules of this universe in enough detail to make it credible. You might wonder why the Grand Jury would wait until the last minute to hear testimony from this witness, but they have and we go along for the ride.This `ticking clock' also establishes the parameters of the film's universe. Jack has a deadline and if he doesn't meet it, everything he just went through is meaningless. He has to meet it. As he meets the various obstacles set in his path, it quickly becomes apparent the film will attempt to follow the journey in real time. We watch every moment of the journey, from start to finish, more or less in real time. This helps to ratchet the suspense level up a few notches.Along the way, Jack and Eddie run into a series of obstacles, keeping them from their final destination. About twenty minutes into the film, after a potential ambush, Jack hides Eddie in a friendly bar, waiting for back-up to arrive. Eddie (Def) is a talker and he quickly annoys Jack (and us, but more on that later). When the back-up arrives, in the form of Jack's former partner Frank (David Morse) and a collection of other cops, Jack soon begins to put things together. When another cop shows up and Eddie immediately stops talking, Jack realizes he is in trouble. We see the thoughts clicking into place, everything adding up, in Jack's mind as he puts it together. The moment when Eddie stops talking is an effective trigger. As soon as Jack and Eddie meet, the witness has done nothing but talk and talk and talk. As soon as the cop enters, he becomes silent. Jack can tell something is wrong.As they progress closer and closer to the Grand Jury, the film becomes a series of staged sequences featuring the alcoholic cop and his witness against bad cops in a variety of locales along the way; a cramped apartment in Chinatown, a construction site in Manhattan, the cramped basements of a small neighborhood. Frankly, these become repetitive and reminders of better sequences in better films. You know that Jack and Eddie will get through these series of obstacles. If they didn't, the film would end. We watch as Frank and his colleagues close in on Jack and Eddie, only for the alcoholic detective and his witness to escape at the last moment. The film even resorts to the old `red herring' clich&eacute;. We follow both sides during a tense moment. Just as Frank and the corrupt cops close in on Jack and Eddie, they find they have been chasing an identical, but different, vehicle, piece of clothing, etc. Jack and Eddie get away again. This is a tired and lazy attempt for the screenwriter to get the two heroes out of their predicament. If it were used early in the story, it would be more interesting and forgivable. As it is used late, it seems as though the screenwriter merely ran out of ideas.This `red herring' idea is only one of a handful of clich&eacute;s the screenwriter uses, all of which point to someone who has seen a lot of films, but has few ideas of his own. Fake hostage situations, tape recorders, secret passageways, all pop-up at one point or another.Director Donner does a good job or painting the cramped, dirty look of New York. Many of the tense moments are staged in small, dark areas, adding a little to the suspense. But after Jack and Eddie successfully navigate the first of these obstacles, and then the second we realize that these sequences are staged and they lose any connection to reality. Screenwriters are always looking for new and inventive ways to gets their characters in and out of danger. But if there never appears to be any real danger, these situations ring empty and false.Mos Def, who has done some good work in previous films, doesn't fare so well with Eddie. He imbues the character with a high-pitched cartoon character voice which not only annoys Jack, but annoys us. The character's voice is a bad miscalculation, making Eddie the cartoon character he is. Throughout, Eddie carries around a notebook, which ultimately proves to be too outlandish as well. Initially, when Eddie reveals the contents of the book, I thought his explanation was an attempt to disguise the real contents. Unfortunately, I was wrong.All of the grittiness Donner attempts to create, all of the dissatisfaction Willis attempts, all of the tense situations writer Wenck creates, are thrown out the window in the last few moments of the film. ""Blocks"" isn't true to itself. If it were true to the work of all involved, it would have a gritty, realistic ending. It doesn't.There are touches here and there which hold promise and would make ""16 Blocks"" worthy of a DVD rental.",3,"Well worn, partially effective, worth a rental.",1141603200,"03 6,

989281,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000FFL2G6,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","'16 Blocks' directed by Richard Donner comes with strong acting from its star Bruce Willis. It is not as good as `Die Hard' or `Lethal Weapon,' but for all its occasional dullness and its too neat conclusion, it is still entertaining.Bruce Willis plays a burnt-out NYPD cop Jack Mosley (with wispy gray hair and bad leg) whose latest job is to escort Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) a petty criminal to a courthouse sixteen blocks away from his police station. A simple and ordinary task suddenly becomes a life-or-death matter to both characters when some people interrupt them along the way on the street of New York City.[TYPICAL B-ACTION UPGRADED] The identity of those bad people is no big secret. You can easily know it when menacing David Morse appears before us. '16 Blocks' has several well-choreographed actions but the film actually scores extra points by showing more detailed characterization of the two leads than routine B action films (though I found Mos Def's talkative criminal is a bit irritating at times).Richard Donner, whose previous film `Timeline' was a huge disappointment, came back with better results than before. This time you don't listen to elaborate time machine theory nor witness big flying fireballs, but the actions are tight and the pace is overall slick. However, I couldn't help thinking about the impossible situations. It is hard to ignore these things, like -- Why is Eddie so careless about his own safety when he knows someone is after him? -- or -- Why didn't the bad guys think of just buying off this small-time criminal (which is clearly an easier option)? These plot holes become glaring when actions stop.You may not like Bruce Willis, and his films could be sometimes awful (remember `Breakfast of Champions, anyone?) --  but he and his acting here deserve special mention. '16 Blocks' proves that with the presence of movie star a B-action film can become more engrossing than you expect.",3,B Action Film Improved by Slick Direction and Strong Acting,1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,1932,"[""'16"", 'Blocks', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'strong', 'acting', 'star', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'occasional', 'dullness', 'too', 'neat', 'conclusion', 'still', 'entertaining.Bruce', 'Willis', 'burnt-out', 'NYPD', 'cop', 'Jack', 'Mosley', 'wispy', 'gray', 'hair', 'bad', 'leg', 'latest', 'job', 'escort', 'Eddie', 'Bunker', 'Mos', 'Def', 'petty', 'criminal', 'courthouse', 'sixteen', 'away', 'police', 'station', 'simple', 'ordinary', 'task', 'suddenly', 'life-or-death', 'matter', 'characters', 'when', 'people', 'interrupt', 'way', 'street', 'New', 'York', 'City', '[', 'TYPICAL', 'B-ACTION', 'UPGRADED', ']', 'identity', 'bad', 'people', 'big', 'secret', 'can', 'easily', 'know', 'when', 'menacing', 'David', 'Morse', 'Blocks', 'several', 'well-choreographed', 'actions', 'film', 'actually', 'extra', 'points', 'showing', 'more', 'detailed', 'characterization', 'two', 'leads', 'routine', 'B', 'action', 'films', 'found', 'Mos', 'Def', 'talkative', 'criminal', 'bit', 'irritating', 'times', '.Richard', 'Donner', 'previous', 'film', 'Timeline', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'came', 'back', 'better', 'results', 'before', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'elaborate', 'time', 'machine', 'theory', 'witness', 'big', 'flying', 'fireballs', 'actions', 'are', 'tight', 'pace', 'overall', 'slick', 'However', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'impossible', 'situations', 'hard', 'ignore', 'things', 'Why', 'Eddie', 'so', 'careless', 'own', 'safety', 'when', 'someone', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guys', 'think', 'just', 'buying', 'off', 'small-time', 'criminal', 'clearly', 'easier', 'option', 'plot', 'become', 'glaring', 'when', 'actions', 'stop.You', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'films', 'could', 'be', 'sometimes', 'awful', 'remember', 'Breakfast', 'Champions', 'anyone', 'acting', 'here', 'special', 'mention', 'Blocks', 'proves', 'presence', 'movie', 'star', 'B-action', 'film', 'can', 'become', 'more', 'engrossing', 'expect']",N/A

Bruce Willis does very well at playing a drunken cop.  Maybe he's had some practice?The movie picks up steam when Willis has to shoot an assassin who is about to off his witness.  From there, it's a roller coaster ride that is fairly believable, and definitely fun, until about the last ten minutes, then things take a slide.  But what the hey, it's a fun movie.  In fact, it's the best Bruce Willis I've seen since the original Die Hard.  Another surprise is David Morse, who plays Willis' ex-partner.  Morse's character is a corrupt cop who is in on a murder and is trying to stop Mos Def from testifying against him and Bruce Willis, as well as some other cops.On one hand, 16 Blocks is just another movie about corrupt NYC cops, on the other hand it is a reasonably good character study about a drunken cop who can realize the merits of justice when he sees it, even if he is plastered.",4,A Better Bruce Willis,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,1221,"['16', 'Blocks', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'best', 'movie', 'certainly', 'best', 'effort', 'character', 'acting', 'least', 'last', 'few', 'scenes', 'aging', 'alcoholic', 'off', 'books', 'cop', 'job', 'take', 'witness', 'court', 'house', 'testify', 'cops', 'Mos', 'Def', 'witness', 'actually', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'very', 'well', 'playing', 'drunken', 'cop', 'Maybe', 'had', 'practice', 'movie', 'up', 'steam', 'when', 'Willis', 'shoot', 'assassin', 'who', 'off', 'witness', 'there', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'fairly', 'believable', 'definitely', 'fun', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'then', 'things', 'take', 'slide', 'what', 'hey', 'fun', 'movie', 'fact', 'best', 'Bruce', 'Willis', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'Die', 'Hard', 'surprise', 'David', 'Morse', 'who', 'Willis', 'ex-partner', 'Morse', 'character', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'who', 'murder', 'trying', 'stop', 'Mos', 'Def', 'testifying', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'cops.On', 'one', 'hand', '16', 'Blocks', 'just', 'movie', 'corrupt', 'NYC', 'cops', 'other', 'hand', 'reasonably', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'drunken', 'cop', 'who', 'can', 'realize', 'merits', 'justice', 'when', 'even', 'plastered']",N/A

989286,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000FFL2G6,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[2, 2]","Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon, Maverick, Conspiracy Theory) directs Bruce Willis in this somewhat unusual crime thriller about an over-the-hill, alcoholic, New York City cop (nothing new for Willis) assigned the task of escorting a witness to the courthouse. The witness, Eddie Bunker - played by Mos Def (Something The Lord Made) - is appearing in a case against a group of fellow cops. Jack was never meant to be the escort, and the witness was never meant to reach the courthouse. But Jack still has enough grit left to put up a good fight against the bad cops trying to stop Eddie, and the clock that is ticking, as he and his witness attempt to traverse the 16 blocks from the police station to the courthouse before the jury is dismissed.This is Donner at his action best. Willis is also excellent, and truly looks and acts the part of a worn out, self-abused cop, as he tries to do the right thing by helping Eddie, even though it puts him on the wrong side of former friends that are part of the corrupt group of cops. For those who are used to seeing Willis the action hero, healthy and in shape, prepare yourself: he looks old and feeble. But that's okay, he's supposed to. Def is good as the optimistic witness Eddie - a former thief that believes people can change - and provides the usual Donner talkative element. A hallmark of all Donner films, the endless chatter could get on your nerves - especially considering Eddie's nasally voice - but it is usually entertaining. David Morse is solid, though not especially interesting, as Frank Nugent, Jack's former partner and leader of the bad cops that will use any means possible to keep Jack and Eddie from reaching the courthouse.Writer-director Richard Wenk (Just The Ticket) wrote the script for this one, and although he stretches the believability factor to the absolute limit - what else would you expect in a Donner flick? - and has the predictable face-off between Jack and Frank at the end, there is plenty of action, as well as twists and turns in plot, so that most viewers will be kept on the edge of their seat for the literally 102 minute trek. The best twist is at the end; but if you don't like that ending, a second, unscripted - and weaker - one is provided.Waitsel Smith",5,BEST CRIME THRILLER IN YEARS,1151020800,"06 23, 2006",2006,2252,"['Richard', 'Donner', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Maverick', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'somewhat', 'unusual', 'crime', 'thriller', 'over-the-hill', 'alcoholic', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cop', 'nothing', 'new', 'Willis', 'assigned', 'task', 'escorting', 'witness', 'courthouse', 'witness', 'Eddie', 'Bunker', 'played', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Something', 'Lord', 'Made', 'appearing', 'case', 'group', 'fellow', 'cops', 'Jack', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'escort', 'witness', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'reach', 'courthouse', 'Jack', 'still', 'enough', 'grit', 'left', 'put', 'up', 'good', 'fight', 'bad', 'cops', 'trying', 'stop', 'Eddie', 'clock', 'ticking', 'witness', 'attempt', 'traverse', '16', 'blocks', 'police', 'station', 'courthouse', 'jury', 'dismissed.This', 'Donner', 'action', 'best', 'Willis', 'also', 'excellent', 'truly', 'looks', 'part', 'worn', 'out', 'self-abused', 'cop', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'helping', 'Eddie', 'even', 'wrong', 'side', 'former', 'friends', 'are', 'part', 'corrupt', 'group', 'cops', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Willis', 'action', 'hero', 'healthy', 'shape', 'prepare', 'old', 'feeble', 'okay', 'supposed', 'Def', 'good', 'optimistic', 'witness', 'Eddie', 'former', 'thief', 'people', 'can', 'change', 'usual', 'Donner', 'talkative', 'element', 'hallmark', 'Donner', 'films', 'endless', 'chatter', 'could', 'get', 'nerves', 'especially', 'considering', 'Eddie', 'nasally', 'voice', 'usually', 'entertaining', 'David', 'Morse', 'solid', 'not', 'especially', 'interesting', 'Frank', 'Nugent', 'Jack', 'former', 'partner', 'leader', 'bad', 'cops', 'will', 'use', 'means', 'possible', 'keep', 'Jack', 'Eddie', 'reaching', 'courthouse.Writer-director', 'Richard', 'Wenk', 'Just', 'Ticket', 'wrote', 'script', 'one', 'believability', 'factor', 'absolute', 'limit', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'expect', 'Donner', 'flick', 'predictable', 'face-off', 'Jack', 'Frank', 'end', 'plenty', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'literally', '102', 'minute', 'trek', 'best', 'twist', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ending', 'second', 'unscripted', 'weaker', 'one', 'provided.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
989287,A1RIQUDE4B8NGX,B000FFL2G6,Wildness,"[1, 1]","When I first saw the trailer for ""16 Blocks"", I immediately thought of the average Clint Eastwood film from 1977 ""The Gauntlet"", where Clint's average cop had to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix where she will testify in a mob trail that will end up having an impact on the Police Commissioner; in the end, the cop and the witness must run a gauntlet of cops shooting at them while they try to crash the courthouse in a bus.I assume that ""16 Blocks"" is a loose adaptation, but the similarities end with the premise. Bruce Willis plays an aging, overweight, and well past done NYPD detective who just works on getting through the day from one drink to the next when he is tapped by his boss to transport a grand jury witness from lockup to the courthouse - literally a distance of 16 blocks from each other. He is talked into the task, and after only one block of transporting the witness, he stops in traffic to get a bottle from the liquer store.This is when all hell breaks loose and the detective is thrust into events as a couple of gunman try to kill the witness. At first, he is ready to do anything to end the assignment until his old partner of 20 years shows up to the rescue only to try and kill the witness himself. The next 15 blocks and 90 minutes take us through the streets, buildings, and basements of New York in a running battle between the detective and some of New York's less finest. Though there is a bus involved, it is not played out like the ""The Gauntlet""; and the detective's road to redemption takes the viewer on a couple of twists and turns in a short ""16 block"" distance.",5,The Gauntlet meets NYPD Blue,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1615,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', '16', 'Blocks', 'immediately', 'thought', 'average', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film', '1977', 'Gauntlet', 'where', 'Clint', 'average', 'cop', 'had', 'escort', 'prostitute', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Phoenix', 'where', 'will', 'testify', 'mob', 'trail', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'impact', 'Police', 'Commissioner', 'end', 'cop', 'witness', 'must', 'run', 'gauntlet', 'cops', 'shooting', 'try', 'crash', 'courthouse', 'bus.I', 'assume', '16', 'Blocks', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'similarities', 'end', 'premise', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'aging', 'overweight', 'well', 'done', 'NYPD', 'detective', 'who', 'just', 'getting', 'day', 'one', 'drink', 'next', 'when', 'tapped', 'boss', 'transport', 'grand', 'jury', 'witness', 'lockup', 'courthouse', 'literally', 'distance', '16', 'blocks', 'other', 'talked', 'task', 'only', 'one', 'block', 'transporting', 'witness', 'traffic', 'get', 'bottle', 'liquer', 'store.This', 'when', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'detective', 'thrust', 'events', 'couple', 'gunman', 'try', 'kill', 'witness', 'first', 'ready', 'do', 'anything', 'end', 'assignment', 'old', 'partner', '20', 'years', 'rescue', 'only', 'try', 'kill', 'witness', 'next', '15', 'blocks', '90', 'minutes', 'take', 'streets', 'buildings', 'basements', 'New', 'York', 'running', 'battle', 'detective', 'New', 'York', 'less', 'finest', 'bus', 'involved', 'not', 'played', 'out', 'Gauntlet', 'detective', 'road', 'redemption', 'viewer', 'couple', 'twists', 'turns', 'short', '16', 'block', 'distance']",N/A
