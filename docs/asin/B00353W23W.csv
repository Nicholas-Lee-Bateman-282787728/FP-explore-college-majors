I really cannot say anything positive about this DVD.  It is of poor quality in terms of audio and video.  It reminds me of bootleg copy of a poor original.  Knowing teh Carpenter tradition of excellence, I have to question why this DVD is such a departure from the quality of the previous musical releases? I have seen better cuts of this concert on You-Tube!  I have this concert on VHS, and it is every bit as good in terms of quality as this DVD, and my VHS tape is a copy of a copy! If this is the video and audio master, then there is nothing left in the Carpenter video vault.There is a bootleg copy of the tv show, ""The Wonder Years"" that is sold on various sites, and it is clearly a recorded version (probably directly from tv, and is being presented as ""new"".  Perhaps this is a Japanese tv release that was copied and is being presented as ""new"".

There are very few DVDs on the market on Karen & Richard and so I had been looking forward to this.After a two week delay from the publisher the DVD has finally been released and I received my copy from Amazon in today's mail.  I am very disappointed to say the least.There are 10 selections from the 1971 BBC Concert from the UK in which this is taken from. This TV concert from British television contains the best ""live"" version Karen Carpenter ever sang.  However, the video quality is terrible!  I was not expecting this as VH1 aired the same concert a decade ago and the quality shown on that airing was good.  So why this is poor quality is beyond me.  The other selections like ""And When He Smiles"" are of good quality but they have Japanese titles at the top of the screen  plus English subtitles that I couldn't remove on playback on various DVD players.  This also wasn't on the VH1 broadcast so they shouldn't have been on this copy.The ten performances from Karen and Richard are as follows:1. Help2. Love Is Surrender3. And When He Smiles4. Rainy Days and Mondays5. Bacharach/David Medley6. For All We Know7. Sometimes8. Close To You9. We've Only Just Begun10. SuperstarThis, of course, is not to advise not getting this DVD.

1326027,AGW68YZZPOK6,B00353W23W,Xavier Limtuaco,"[34, 34]","For the past 5 years, I have been a regular Amazon customer and this DVD takes the prize for having the poorest video quality out of all the DVDs I have purchased. Very bad picture quality, bad editing and track 2 (LOVE IS SURRENDER) after it finishes keeps going back to the start unless there is manual intervention and you forward it to the next track (AND WHEN HE SMILES).Anyway, in any situation, there is always a positive side and inspite of the DVD's poor video quality, I must say that this DVD is still worth owning if you are a true Carpenters fan like myself. Why? Because out of 10 tracks listed, this DVD contains 8 PRECIOUS LIVE PERFORMANCES from the late, great Karen Carpenter. These are performances I have actually seen for the very first time!Rather than a standard concert, this DVD is more of a LIVE STUDIO CONCERT filmed in 1971 in the UK after the Carpenters released their second and third albums ""Close to You"" (1970)and ""Carpenters""(1971). Out of the 10 songs, only 8 are LIVE performances and the other 2 are NON-LIVE performances.These are the songs:1. HELP - this may have been performed live but in this DVD, Karen's performance is dubbed with the studio version;2. LOVE IS SURRENDER - LIVE;3. AND WHEN HE SMILES - LIVE and a RARE performance never seen before;4. RAINY DAYS AND MONDAYS - LIVE;5. BACHARACH / DAVID MEDLEY - again, like Help, this may have been performed LIVE but the performance is dubbed with the studio version; I had hoped this was a LIVE PERFORMANCE because there was a LIVE Bacharach/David medley included in the expensive Carpenters Anthology 4-cd set manufactured in Japan;6. FOR ALL WE KNOW - LIVE;7. SOMETIMES - I am not so sure if this is a LIVE version because it sounds exactly like the studio version but I think it is LIVE;8. CLOSE TO YOU - LIVE;9. WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN - LIVE;10. SUPERSTAR - this is actually my favorite LIVE performance in this DVD because Karen delivers a bravura performance that even surpasses the brilliant studio version. One thing though - this performance was definitely NOT part of this LIVE STUDIO CONCERT filmed in the UK because it is obvious that the performance was taken from another concert at another time showing Karen with a different look, different background and film was used instead of video. But, nonetheless, ""Superstar"" is a GEM of a PERFORMANCE!Aside from the poor video quality, I must also make mention that the English and Japanese lyrics on screen are downright irritating and insulting to a singer of Karen's calibre. These were clips of their performances intended for Karaoke and not for their fans. The Karaoke thing, therefore, sadly undermines the greatness of Karen's performances. The manufacturers of this DVD obviously had no respect for the artist because of the sloppy job in putting together this DVD which is being sold at $11.49!Karen is gone but her musical legacy lives on. Her voice was God-given and she possessed the qualities of a truly great singer - angelic, distinct, pure voice; flawless delivery and perfect pitch. I pray that one day, fans will be treated to a box-set of all Carpenters performances. The Carpenters are music icons who richly deserve to be immortalized in the most sophisticated audio-video form (DVD or Blu Ray) digitally remastered with 5.1 surround sound for the appreciation of their millions of fans and generations to come. Fans will eagerly await for that day to come.",3,DVD STILL WORTH OWNING BY CARPENTERS FANS,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,3432,"['past', '5', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'regular', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'DVD', 'prize', 'having', 'poorest', 'video', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'have', 'purchased', 'Very', 'bad', 'picture', 'quality', 'bad', 'editing', 'track', '2', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'SURRENDER', 'going', 'back', 'start', 'manual', 'intervention', 'forward', 'next', 'track', 'WHEN', 'HE', 'SMILES', '.Anyway', 'situation', 'always', 'positive', 'side', 'inspite', 'DVD', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'must', 'say', 'DVD', 'still', 'worth', 'owning', 'are', 'true', 'Carpenters', 'fan', 'Why', '10', 'tracks', 'listed', 'DVD', '8', 'PRECIOUS', 'LIVE', 'PERFORMANCES', 'late', 'great', 'Karen', 'Carpenter', 'are', 'performances', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'Rather', 'standard', 'concert', 'DVD', 'more', 'LIVE', 'STUDIO', 'CONCERT', 'filmed', '1971', 'UK', 'Carpenters', 'released', 'second', 'third', 'albums', 'Close', '1970', 'Carpenters', '1971', '10', 'songs', 'only', '8', 'are', 'LIVE', 'performances', 'other', '2', 'are', 'NON-LIVE', 'performances.These', 'are', 'songs:1', 'HELP', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'live', 'DVD', 'Karen', 'performance', 'dubbed', 'studio', 'version', '2', 'LOVE', 'IS', 'SURRENDER', 'LIVE', '3', 'WHEN', 'HE', 'SMILES', 'LIVE', 'RARE', 'performance', 'never', 'seen', '4', 'RAINY', 'DAYS', 'AND', 'MONDAYS', 'LIVE', '5', 'BACHARACH', 'DAVID', 'MEDLEY', 'again', 'Help', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'performed', 'LIVE', 'performance', 'dubbed', 'studio', 'version', 'had', 'hoped', 'was', 'LIVE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'was', 'LIVE', 'Bacharach/David', 'medley', 'included', 'expensive', 'Carpenters', 'Anthology', '4-cd', 'set', 'manufactured', 'Japan', '6', 'WE', 'KNOW', 'LIVE', '7', 'SOMETIMES', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'LIVE', 'version', 'exactly', 'studio', 'version', 'think', 'LIVE', '8', 'CLOSE', 'TO', 'YOU', 'LIVE', '9', 'WE', ""'VE"", 'ONLY', 'JUST', 'BEGUN', 'LIVE', '10', 'SUPERSTAR', 'actually', 'favorite', 'LIVE', 'performance', 'DVD', 'Karen', 'bravura', 'performance', 'even', 'brilliant', 'studio', 'version', 'One', 'thing', 'performance', 'was', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'part', 'LIVE', 'STUDIO', 'CONCERT', 'filmed', 'UK', 'obvious', 'performance', 'was', 'taken', 'concert', 'time', 'showing', 'Karen', 'different', 'look', 'different', 'background', 'film', 'was', 'used', 'instead', 'video', 'nonetheless', 'Superstar', 'GEM', 'PERFORMANCE', 'Aside', 'poor', 'video', 'quality', 'must', 'also', 'make', 'mention', 'English', 'Japanese', 'lyrics', 'screen', 'are', 'downright', 'irritating', 'insulting', 'singer', 'Karen', 'calibre', 'were', 'clips', 'performances', 'intended', 'Karaoke', 'not', 'fans', 'Karaoke', 'thing', 'therefore', 'sadly', 'greatness', 'Karen', 'performances', 'manufacturers', 'DVD', 'obviously', 'had', 'respect', 'artist', 'sloppy', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'DVD', 'being', 'sold', '11.49', 'Karen', 'gone', 'musical', 'legacy', 'voice', 'was', 'God-given', 'possessed', 'qualities', 'truly', 'great', 'singer', 'angelic', 'distinct', 'pure', 'voice', 'flawless', 'delivery', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'pray', 'one', 'day', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'box-set', 'Carpenters', 'performances', 'Carpenters', 'are', 'music', 'icons', 'who', 'richly', 'deserve', 'be', 'immortalized', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'audio-video', 'form', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'digitally', 'remastered', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'appreciation', 'millions', 'fans', 'generations', 'come', 'Fans', 'will', 'eagerly', 'await', 'day', 'come']",N/A
