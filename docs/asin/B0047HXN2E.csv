It is a movie that displays an ignored subject in our society - the military family and their sacrifices. What most people don't understand in America is that every person in a military family serves this country. Wives, husbands and children of military veterans sacrifice on a daily basis so that we all can live free and in peace. This movie is a great example of the strain and sacrifices that military families experience when their hero has to be away for a long extended period of time or worst pays the ultimate sacrifice of dying. I really enjoyed this movie. It had a great story line and is inspiring. The boy in the movie has a voice like an angel. I always have a soft spot in my heart for military brats. For you civilian fokes, a military brat is a child whose parent serves in the military. Another thing I liked about this movie is that it provided a good example of drug addiction and how an addict struggles on a daily basis to stay sober. Lastly, this film was done at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the surrounding area. A place dear to my heart and a place that I called home for many years.

(Just a little side-note: If you liked, or even LOVED this movie, I would strongly recommend &#34;A Christmas Visitor&#34; starring William Devane).This movie, though said to be purely fictional, is actually representative; unfortunately; of many military families out there who have experienced the loss, or even the long-term deployment of someone they hold close to their heart. This may have been a Low-Budget film, but both the acting and the storyline were phenomenal, and this film, imho, beats a lot of the offerings from Hollywood nowadays! The acting was believable enough that I felt like I was watching a long, long military family documentary, and not a movie. It's been a while since I've seen a movie where the characters have so boldly stuck in my mind. I'm a thirty-three year old man, and I cried, so I think anyone who says that &#34;Grown men don't cry&#34; ought to watch this movie. If you're a grown man who says that, then you should DEFINITELY watch this movie.Sometimes when I watch a YouTube video, afterwards, I find myself wishing I could get the time back that I spent watching the video because doing so was such a waste of time; but that couldn't be further from the truth with this movie.

The Rap in this movie is &#34;Free Styling&#34; and I can never understand how some people can actually do that but they can.  The story line is good but not great but it's definitely a believable story in many ways.  I'm sure you will enjoy Uriah Sheldon's singing as he has a wonderful voice for a young boy and he can rock it with the best of them.Go ahead and buy this DVD as I really son't think you will be disappointed, but the music and part of the story line might upset some people.  There is some violence in it and there are a couple of words used that didn't need to be there. There are also several scenes where drugs are used which is part of the movie.",5,"The story of a dad (Dash Mihok), his wife (Nicki Aycox), and their son (Uriah Sheldon) that will touch on all of your emotions.",1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,1204,"['When', 'ordered', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'read', 'site', 'was', 'real', 'surprise', 'when', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'honesty', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'now', 'seen', 'get', 'emotionally', 'tied', 'time', 'music', 'great', 'must', 'realize', 'up-beat', 'Rap', 'as', 'well', 'like', 'Rap', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'language', 'violence', 'prefer', 'be', 'God', 'Rap', 'good', 'singing', 'Lord', 'Rap', 'movie', '34', 'Free', 'Styling', '34', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'how', 'people', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'can', 'story', 'line', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'definitely', 'believable', 'story', 'many', 'ways', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Uriah', 'Sheldon', 'singing', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'young', 'boy', 'can', 'rock', 'best', 'them.Go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'DVD', 'really', 'so', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'music', 'part', 'story', 'line', 'might', 'upset', 'people', 'violence', 'are', 'couple', 'words', 'used', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'there', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'drugs', 'are', 'used', 'part', 'movie']",N/A

1388637,ARXYVR1TPTY6P,B0047HXN2E,"TJ-STL ""DVD viewer""","[2, 16]","I have only written 140 reviews on Amazon and only twice has my review differed from the ""average"" by 2 stars. I never give a synopsis of the story, to me that seems secondary you can read the 5 to 7 paragraph reviews of others. Since I purchase and review many videos, I would rather get an idea of what others think of the movie and hear some of its strong and weak points. That is the reason I look at Amazon reviews of movies and books and comments by users on APPS for my Android. That being said. This movie was rated 3 stars on Netflix and other rating services, not the 14x5star I read before I rented it. This movie is a FEEL GOOD, KIDS and CHICK FLICK. The singing was not that great, and the heavy set black girl, and the young singer with the band were clearly the best and should have won, NOT the ""poor"" kid with the ""AA"" mother. I believe the 5 stars resulted from the 3 VERY short scenes of the bullies at school, a caring minister, the druggie neighbors, the very mean grandfather, who not only repeatedly used the ""N"" word but beat-up the boy. The video also used the bank taking the house from the wife of a GI who could not pay her bills and went back to drugs and booze and compounded by the father giving his life ""for his country"", an over acted woman judge and the boy singing of the National Anthem and Start Spangled Banner. This was a low budget movie that ""slightly tugged at your heart strings"", made me tear up and made you hate the Bullies, Bank, the woman judge and the unfairness of life. It was ok for a rainy afternoon but 3 stars may have been a gift.",3,"FEEL GOOD, KIDS and CHICK FLICK with tears",1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,1587,"['have', 'only', 'written', '140', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'only', 'twice', 'review', 'differed', 'average', '2', 'stars', 'never', 'give', 'synopsis', 'story', 'secondary', 'can', 'read', '5', '7', 'paragraph', 'reviews', 'others', 'purchase', 'review', 'many', 'videos', 'would', 'rather', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'movie', 'hear', 'strong', 'weak', 'points', 'reason', 'look', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'movies', 'books', 'comments', 'users', 'APPS', 'Android', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'rated', '3', 'stars', 'Netflix', 'other', 'rating', 'services', 'not', '14x5star', 'read', 'rented', 'movie', 'FEEL', 'GOOD', 'KIDS', 'CHICK', 'FLICK', 'singing', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'heavy', 'set', 'black', 'girl', 'young', 'singer', 'band', 'were', 'clearly', 'best', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'NOT', 'poor', 'kid', 'AA', 'mother', 'believe', '5', 'stars', 'resulted', '3', 'VERY', 'short', 'scenes', 'bullies', 'school', 'caring', 'minister', 'druggie', 'neighbors', 'very', 'mean', 'grandfather', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'repeatedly', 'used', 'N', 'word', 'beat-up', 'boy', 'video', 'also', 'used', 'bank', 'taking', 'house', 'wife', 'GI', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'pay', 'bills', 'went', 'back', 'drugs', 'booze', 'compounded', 'father', 'giving', 'life', 'country', 'acted', 'woman', 'judge', 'boy', 'singing', 'National', 'Anthem', 'Start', 'Spangled', 'Banner', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'slightly', 'tugged', 'heart', 'strings', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'made', 'hate', 'Bullies', 'Bank', 'woman', 'judge', 'unfairness', 'life', 'was', 'ok', 'rainy', 'afternoon', '3', 'stars', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'gift']",N/A
