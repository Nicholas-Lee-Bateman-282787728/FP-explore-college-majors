1264856,A25Y22XPPLGPF8,B002E39R8W,"a customer ""me""","[80, 80]","Be mindful these are 4 previously release dvds, plus a stretchie band, I don't know why there is a stretchy band, because it is not incorporated, in any of these workouts, but I incorporated it, when using the weights for a tougher workout...so you might already own them. She has the same people in every single workout.  Just different backgrounds and I think clothing.  Also, I am also an advanced walker, I walk 5 or miles a day...so my level may not fit your level.  Do what is right for you and your body.I wanted to have a couple more of her dvds, for variety, so not as to get bored, but was waiting later to purchase them.  I already had one of her dvds ""Walk and Kick,"" but wanted the ""Walk and Jog"" and ""Walk Strong,"" too.  Well this dvd has them all. I use her dvds when I don't want to walk on my treadmill, or walk outside.Each workout, has it's own warm up and cool down. The dvd is all chaptered, and the workouts do not run, all together.  For example Power Mile runs for 20 minutes, and then it stops, if you want to continue exercising, you will have to go to the chapters on the dvd, pick out the one you want and start over. The four basic moves she does, is all on the dvd as well.Walks on the dvd...Power Mile 20 minutes, is a 1 mile walk, there is interval training in this, and you have the option of using light, or medium, with this.  You can use weights or balls.  She is not by herself and has 2 other walkers with her.  You will work both upper and lower body. This is a great 20 minute workout!Walk Strong, is my favorite, it is a 33 minute circuit training walk, which is called interval training.  That is you walk for a couple minutes, and then use weights for 3 minutes to tone, both upper and lower body. This is equal to a 2 mile walk. She has 4 other walkers with her. I normally use 3-5-8 lb. weights. You will work almost the entire body.Walk and Jog is 33 minutes, this is equal to a 2 mile walk.  Leslie uses her standard walking for a few minutes, and then you jog, in place, backwards and forwards. She has other walkers with her. You will work the entire body, because she does use arm movements in this as well. She has 4 other walkers with her.  Good moderate to fast pace.Walk and Kick is 33 minutes and equals a 2 mile walk.  It's mild kickboxing for about two minutes, with puches of the arms and legs, and then back to walking. You will work alot of the upper and lower body. This is good for someone who has never had any previous kickboxing, but for me, it wasn't intense enough for me, but I do use it for a light day. She is with 4 other walkers.All in all it is well worth the money, great dvd with previous releases all on one dvd!I wish it all ran together, now that would be one good workout, but since it is chaptered, I end up doing  2-3 of the chapters, because I walk 5 or more miles a day.  Two of her 5 mile walk dvds are still my favorites, and it would be nice if we seen more.To see if you have the dvds already, here they are:Power mile: http://www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Away-Pounds/dp/B0006213HG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1254064644&sr;=8-1Walk Strong: http://www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Pounds-Strong/dp/B000CS45II/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1254064699&sr;=1-1 also comes on another previous dvd, that has a green cover on it with a slipper.Walk & Jog: http://www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Away-Pounds/dp/B0006213IK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1254064798&sr;=1-1Walk & Kick:  -Away-Pounds/dp/B0006213JE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1254064831&sr;=1-1",5,Excellent because...it is 4 previous released dvds all on 1 dvd,1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,3556,"['Be', 'mindful', 'are', '4', 'previously', 'release', 'dvds', 'stretchie', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'stretchy', 'band', 'not', 'incorporated', 'workouts', 'incorporated', 'when', 'using', 'weights', 'tougher', 'workout', 'so', 'might', 'already', 'own', 'same', 'people', 'single', 'workout', 'Just', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'think', 'clothing', 'Also', 'am', 'also', 'advanced', 'walker', 'walk', '5', 'miles', 'day', 'so', 'level', 'may', 'not', 'fit', 'level', 'Do', 'what', 'right', 'body.I', 'wanted', 'have', 'couple', 'more', 'dvds', 'variety', 'so', 'not', 'get', 'bored', 'was', 'waiting', 'later', 'purchase', 'already', 'had', 'one', 'dvds', 'Walk', 'Kick', 'wanted', 'Walk', 'Jog', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'too', 'Well', 'dvd', 'use', 'dvds', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'walk', 'treadmill', 'walk', 'outside.Each', 'workout', 'own', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'dvd', 'chaptered', 'workouts', 'do', 'not', 'run', 'together', 'example', 'Power', 'Mile', '20', 'minutes', 'then', 'want', 'continue', 'exercising', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'chapters', 'dvd', 'pick', 'out', 'one', 'want', 'start', 'four', 'basic', 'moves', 'dvd', 'well.Walks', 'dvd', 'Power', 'Mile', '20', 'minutes', '1', 'mile', 'walk', 'interval', 'training', 'have', 'option', 'using', 'light', 'medium', 'can', 'use', 'weights', 'balls', 'not', 'herself', '2', 'other', 'walkers', 'will', 'work', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'great', '20', 'minute', 'workout', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'favorite', '33', 'minute', 'circuit', 'training', 'walk', 'called', 'interval', 'training', 'walk', 'couple', 'minutes', 'then', 'use', 'weights', '3', 'minutes', 'tone', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'equal', '2', 'mile', 'walk', '4', 'other', 'walkers', 'normally', 'use', '3-5-8', 'lb', 'weights', 'will', 'work', 'almost', 'entire', 'body.Walk', 'Jog', '33', 'minutes', 'equal', '2', 'mile', 'walk', 'Leslie', 'standard', 'walking', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'jog', 'place', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'other', 'walkers', 'will', 'work', 'entire', 'body', 'use', 'arm', 'movements', 'as', 'well', '4', 'other', 'walkers', 'Good', 'moderate', 'fast', 'pace.Walk', 'Kick', '33', 'minutes', 'equals', '2', 'mile', 'walk', 'mild', 'kickboxing', 'two', 'minutes', 'puches', 'arms', 'legs', 'then', 'back', 'walking', 'will', 'work', 'alot', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'previous', 'kickboxing', 'was', ""n't"", 'intense', 'enough', 'do', 'use', 'light', 'day', '4', 'other', 'walkers.All', 'well', 'money', 'great', 'dvd', 'previous', 'releases', 'one', 'dvd', 'wish', 'ran', 'together', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'good', 'workout', 'chaptered', 'end', 'up', 'doing', '2-3', 'chapters', 'walk', '5', 'more', 'miles', 'day', 'Two', '5', 'mile', 'walk', 'dvds', 'are', 'still', 'favorites', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'seen', 'more.To', 'see', 'have', 'dvds', 'already', 'here', 'are', 'Power', 'mile', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Away-Pounds/dp/B0006213HG/ref=sr_1_1', 'ie=UTF8', 's', '=dvd', 'qid', '=1254064644', 'sr', '=8-1Walk', 'Strong', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Pounds-Strong/dp/B000CS45II/ref=sr_1_1', 'ie=UTF8', 's', '=dvd', 'qid', '=1254064699', 'sr', '=1-1', 'also', 'previous', 'dvd', 'green', 'cover', 'slipper.Walk', 'Jog', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Away-Pounds/dp/B0006213IK/ref=sr_1_1', 'ie=UTF8', 's', '=dvd', 'qid', '=1254064798', 'sr', '=1-1Walk', 'Kick', '-Away-Pounds/dp/B0006213JE/ref=sr_1_1', 'ie=UTF8', 's', '=dvd', 'qid', '=1254064831', 'sr', '=1-1']",N/A

1264858,A3SKGJ8KVUNYUE,B002E39R8W,"Cynthia Danute Cekauskas, LCSW ""Lithuanian Am...","[3, 3]","As a previous reviewer pointed out, this DVD is actually a set of four distinct tapes previously made and sold individually. It's kind of like ""The Best of Walk Away the Pounds"" the series. A Stretchie resistance band comes with the DVD but I am not sure why. There are two places where free weights are used (POWER MILE and WALK STRONG) but I used my weighted 2-lb weighted balls (similar to Leslie Sansone's Walk-Away Weights) or a set of 5-lb dumbbells.The first taped segment is POWER MILE which is a fast and powerful one mile walk. Leslie walks with two of her brisk walking exercisers and uses the weighted balls.WALK STRONG is, I believe, the most important segment of the four and is the one I like the most. Early on Leslie identifies the ""four steps of all in home walking"" which she states is walking in place, side steps, kicks and knee lifts. She declares that if you can do these movements you can do any of the program as designed. Here she combines fast walking and weight training. She tells you that you can use 1-lb, 2-lbs, 3-lbs or no weights at all. She herself employs a set of 5 lb weights which she admits is for the advanced walker. This is an excellent segment where Leslie does such multimuscular exercises as bicep curls and lunges, tricep kickbacks and lunges, squats and upright rows, squats and tricep presses and squats and bicep curls. She does one phenomonal exercise where she combines squats, bicep curls and shoulder presses all at the same time. She insists that the tape is done briskly enough, however, to make sure you get the training effect. I agree with her that the addition of strength training really challenges the body. She tells you that ""you're going to continue to burn a lot of calories especially after strength training and walking together"" because you really have a metabolism boost that is superior. This segment, Leslie tells you at the end, is the equivalent of walking two miles.The third segment is WALK & JOG which to me is the precursor of some of two of my favorite Leslie Sansone tapesLeslie Sansone Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big MilesandLeslie Sansone's Walk Slim - 4 Fast Miles  (2-Disc Set)although she is not yet calling the gentle jogging ""boosted walking"". There is interval training of sorts where speedwalking for three minutes alternates with gentle jogging for two minutes. Also she demonstrates (maybe for the first time) leg swings.The final segment is WALK & KICK and here intervals of brisk walking alternate with kickboxing which I had not experienced before doing this tape. I really found this segment to be enjoyable.This has to be the first of Leslie's segmented DVD's which I really, really like.  I don't generally favor a segmented DVD such as this one preferring to exercise with the SAME group of brisk walkers for a 45-minute plus session. In this case, however, I feel it is a real bargain to get such a fine group of workouts all on one tape. My only criticism was that sometimes you could barely hear the music on the tape. Otherwise what a fine product! I can highly recommend it.",5,The key to being fit is variety.,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,3084,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'DVD', 'actually', 'set', 'four', 'distinct', 'tapes', 'previously', 'made', 'sold', 'individually', 'kind', 'Best', 'Walk', 'Away', 'Pounds', 'series', 'Stretchie', 'resistance', 'band', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'two', 'places', 'where', 'free', 'weights', 'are', 'used', 'POWER', 'MILE', 'WALK', 'STRONG', 'used', 'weighted', '2-lb', 'weighted', 'balls', 'similar', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk-Away', 'Weights', 'set', '5-lb', 'dumbbells.The', 'first', 'taped', 'segment', 'POWER', 'MILE', 'fast', 'powerful', 'one', 'mile', 'walk', 'Leslie', 'walks', 'two', 'brisk', 'walking', 'exercisers', 'weighted', 'balls.WALK', 'STRONG', 'believe', 'most', 'important', 'segment', 'four', 'one', 'like', 'most', 'Early', 'Leslie', 'four', 'steps', 'home', 'walking', 'walking', 'place', 'side', 'steps', 'kicks', 'knee', 'lifts', 'can', 'do', 'movements', 'can', 'do', 'program', 'designed', 'Here', 'fast', 'walking', 'weight', 'training', 'can', 'use', '1-lb', '2-lbs', '3-lbs', 'weights', 'set', '5', 'lb', 'weights', 'advanced', 'walker', 'excellent', 'segment', 'where', 'Leslie', 'such', 'multimuscular', 'exercises', 'bicep', 'curls', 'lunges', 'tricep', 'kickbacks', 'lunges', 'squats', 'upright', 'rows', 'squats', 'tricep', 'presses', 'squats', 'bicep', 'curls', 'one', 'phenomonal', 'exercise', 'where', 'squats', 'bicep', 'curls', 'shoulder', 'presses', 'same', 'time', 'tape', 'done', 'briskly', 'enough', 'however', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'training', 'effect', 'agree', 'addition', 'strength', 'training', 'really', 'body', ""'re"", 'going', 'continue', 'burn', 'lot', 'calories', 'especially', 'strength', 'training', 'walking', 'together', 'really', 'have', 'metabolism', 'boost', 'superior', 'segment', 'Leslie', 'end', 'equivalent', 'walking', 'two', 'miles.The', 'third', 'segment', 'WALK', 'JOG', 'precursor', 'two', 'favorite', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'tapesLeslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Slim', 'Fast', 'Firm', '4', 'Really', 'Big', 'MilesandLeslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Slim', '4', 'Fast', 'Miles', '2-Disc', 'Set', 'not', 'yet', 'calling', 'gentle', 'jogging', 'boosted', 'walking', 'interval', 'training', 'sorts', 'where', 'speedwalking', 'three', 'minutes', 'gentle', 'jogging', 'two', 'minutes', 'Also', 'maybe', 'first', 'time', 'swings.The', 'final', 'segment', 'WALK', 'KICK', 'here', 'intervals', 'brisk', 'walking', 'alternate', 'kickboxing', 'had', 'not', 'experienced', 'doing', 'tape', 'really', 'found', 'segment', 'be', 'enjoyable.This', 'be', 'first', 'Leslie', 'segmented', 'DVD', 'really', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'favor', 'segmented', 'DVD', 'such', 'one', 'preferring', 'exercise', 'SAME', 'group', 'brisk', 'walkers', '45-minute', 'plus', 'session', 'case', 'however', 'feel', 'real', 'bargain', 'get', 'such', 'fine', 'group', 'workouts', 'one', 'tape', 'only', 'criticism', 'was', 'sometimes', 'could', 'barely', 'hear', 'music', 'tape', 'Otherwise', 'what', 'fine', 'product', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

She gets you up off the couch, onto the floor and makes you Walk, Walk Walk away those pounds.  This is a good DVD to buy if you are like me and feel that you don't have a lot of rhythm.  Leslie uses the same four basic moves but  bumps up the speed to get the heart rate up so you can burn those calories.  Before starting to walk with Leslie Sansone everyday in the privacy of my home, I was weighing 207 pounds.  I am now down to 154 almost at my goal of 140.

1264861,AGAOZ53UU82G7,B002E39R8W,FashionQueen86,"[0, 0]","In my opinion, this DVD is not really in miles. Maybe the first part is, but not the rest. Leslie has said quite a few times that its NOT sissy stuff and this DVD will prove it. When I first did the this workout, I was kind of detached. But I did it again today and now it's one of my favorites.I am 26 years old, 158-7 pounds and she has helped me lose 15 pounds. My BMI is 27.1 I was able to catch up and do the entire workout at one time. From my heart monitor I burned 637 calories! I did this workout DVD twice and came out around the 600 calorie count every time. So again, this is an intense workout and if you want a challenge, this is it. Now, if you do it just one or two levels a day, it may not be so tough, but all levels in one day...yea, the 637 will burn.**Menu Options**1) Power Mile2) Walk Strong3) Walk & Jog4) Walk & KickThe power Mile is between medium and high movements. About halfway into the workout she'll introduce some sculpting, which I think was pretty good for the arms. And it's not just for 1 or 2 minutes. She'll stick it in there for a good while. I'd suggest you use 2 pound weights becuase there's one move she did that was too hard for 5 pound weights. This workout lasts about 20 minutes.The Walk Strong section introduces excellent sculpting. She'll do this pattern about four times. There is also some lunges and squatting with the weight-lifting. This workout is about 33 minutes. And I think that adds up to two miles.Walk & Jog was the section where I was getting short of breath. I mean WHOOOO! It's very brisk! You'll jog for 2-minute intervals four times. This includes the regular jog, boosted kicks and leg swings. Ladies you also want to put on a good sports bra for this level. There's a lot of bouncing. This Workout is about 33 minutes as well.The Walk & Kick level is pretty calm. She'll have you do four intervals of light kickboxing. I haven't seen her do double knee-lifts in the other sections but this one...I hate double-knee lifts! This is about 33 minutes too.***Pros***1) Leslie demeanor is VERY calm. And I mean CALM CALM CALM. She has the smile stuck on her face all day, but if you're used to her more current workout DVDs you can tell the difference. It's almost as if she's a different person.2) Her key in executing between different moves is about 4.8/5. So she won't screw you up or confuse you a lot. But remember, she is talking throughout the exercise. So, that may be difficult for her.3) The workouts really get the job done. You will sweat and you will feel your heart pounding greatly. When I did this twice, my body ached a lot! And it was somewhat hard to move around the house. So, I'd recommend doing this DVD just once a week if you're going to all of it at one time. And remember, this is almost TWO HOURS worth of stuff. So, make sure you have the time and plenty of water.4) She's with four other women; all who are a bit older with different both types. I don't like when she's alone. It makes her look too lonely. Plus I tend to observe that when she's with other people, she's happier. I like a more motivated, hyper, and encouraging Leslie.***Cons***1) There is no timer or mile bar at the bottom to help you keep progress.2) The music was really weak. You can't really hear it all that well.***Netural***1) You may not feel so connected with the area she's in. The first mile setting was pretty cheesy and it was a bit bright. She's not really in a studio or room, but it looks like she's in some kind of outside hallway or breezeway. Again, if you're used to her more current workouts, this workout will make you feel like you went back in time like into the 90's at least.2) When you're done with each workout, it will bring you back to the menu each time. So, if you're like me and tend to do the entire workout and just want it to keep going, you'll have to keep that remote nearby.3) The DVD came with a stretch band and I'm not sure why becuase she had no exercises concentrated for that. If you're looking for a good stretch Resistance band workout, buy her 'Five Really Big Miles'. She has two miles dedicated to that.

1264865,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B002E39R8W,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]",If you are looking for some variety in your workouts this might be a good choice. This DVD has four fat-burning workouts. The first workout is interesting because you use weights through the entire workout. I used three-pound weights and it was great. It does however require a lot of coordination as you will be doing lots of lower body exercises at the same time you are doing upper body exercises.The second workout is called Walk Strong because you will again be using weights. Leslie alternates walking with weigh lifting. This requires a lot of balance and the weight lifting makes your heart work faster. I'm guessing this is her most intense workout. At least I thought it was more intense than any of her other workouts I've ever tried.The third workout is called Walk and Jog. Leslie alternates walking and jogging to get the heart rate up in a moderate way. If you don't want to jog there are alternatives.The fourth workout is all about kick boxing. I'm not a huge fan of this type of workout but I actually did enjoy it. Mostly it is walking moves interspersed with boxing and small kicks.I did all the workouts in one day and that was maybe a bit much. You also have to select each workout they don't all run together.

1264866,A2XSGDB4CWSS5J,B002E39R8W,ShellBear,"[2, 2]","It took me ages to decide which Leslie Sansone compilation to buy - I'm so glad I chose this one.  I already had Walk and Jog, but the other three in the collection make it still worthwhile. What I like is that two of the workouts are strength training (Power Mile and Walk Strong)  and two are more cardio (Walk Strong and Walk and Kick).  I like to combine two of the workouts together, like Walk and Jog with Walk Strong to get a 60 min workout with both strength training and cardio. segments.  Power Mile isn't terribly strenuous  and I think you're cooling down after about 13 minutes, so I tend to combine that one with another 3 mile walk on another DVD.  Note : there's another Walk Strong DVD which, judging by the video previews I've seen, uses the stretchie. This Walk Strong uses dumbbells.Walk and Kick -for the  last year I was avidly doing kickboxing dvds - they are my favourite form of fitness. I particularly love Jeanette Jenkins, Kimberley Spreen, Turbo Jam and the 10 minute Solutions kickboxing workouts.  Towards the end of the year, I sustained a severe abdominal wall injury (totally unrelated to exercise) that required surgery and now kickboxing is definitely out.  So I have to avoid anything that even vaguely requires rotational movements like cross or hook punches or roundhouse kicks.  The kickboxing component of Walk and Kick is pretty gentle and it sure feels good to get back into some of those movements, albeit with major modifications.At the moment I'm only able to do Leslie's walking dvds as anything else causes major pain. But her routines are effective and do get your heartrate up - I'm sure I'll still be doing Leslie dvds when things improve.",5,Great compilation,1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,1690,"['took', 'decide', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'compilation', 'buy', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'chose', 'one', 'already', 'had', 'Walk', 'Jog', 'other', 'three', 'collection', 'make', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'What', 'like', 'two', 'workouts', 'are', 'strength', 'training', 'Power', 'Mile', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'two', 'are', 'more', 'cardio', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'Walk', 'Kick', 'like', 'combine', 'two', 'workouts', 'together', 'Walk', 'Jog', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'get', '60', 'min', 'workout', 'strength', 'training', 'cardio', 'segments', 'Power', 'Mile', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'strenuous', 'think', ""'re"", 'cooling', 'down', '13', 'minutes', 'tend', 'combine', 'one', '3', 'mile', 'walk', 'DVD', 'Note', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'DVD', 'judging', 'video', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'stretchie', 'Walk', 'Strong', 'dumbbells.Walk', 'Kick', '-for', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'avidly', 'doing', 'kickboxing', 'dvds', 'are', 'favourite', 'form', 'fitness', 'particularly', 'love', 'Jeanette', 'Jenkins', 'Kimberley', 'Spreen', 'Turbo', 'Jam', '10', 'minute', 'Solutions', 'kickboxing', 'workouts', 'end', 'year', 'sustained', 'severe', 'abdominal', 'wall', 'injury', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'exercise', 'required', 'surgery', 'now', 'kickboxing', 'definitely', 'out', 'So', 'have', 'avoid', 'anything', 'even', 'vaguely', 'rotational', 'movements', 'cross', 'hook', 'punches', 'roundhouse', 'kicks', 'kickboxing', 'component', 'Walk', 'Kick', 'pretty', 'gentle', 'sure', 'feels', 'good', 'get', 'back', 'movements', 'major', 'modifications.At', 'moment', ""'m"", 'only', 'able', 'do', 'Leslie', 'walking', 'dvds', 'anything', 'else', 'major', 'pain', 'routines', 'are', 'effective', 'do', 'get', 'heartrate', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'still', 'be', 'doing', 'Leslie', 'dvds', 'when', 'things', 'improve']",N/A
