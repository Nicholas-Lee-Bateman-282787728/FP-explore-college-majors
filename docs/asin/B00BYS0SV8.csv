1641221,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BYS0SV8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 17]","Note: The DVD has two versions to choose from on the opening menu.  The English Language version or the original version in Russian and Mongolian with English subtitles.  I watched the original subtitled version, so I can't speak to the quality of the dub on the English version track.  I personally hate dubbing!I'm firmly convinced that whoever marketed and prepared the DVD release of the Russian film ""The Horde"" had never seen it and didn't have ANY idea what it was about.  That's the only logical explanation that I can come up with for the bland and meaningless description used on the back of the DVD and repeated here under Editorial Review.  This is what it says: ""1357. Half of the Eastern world is controlled by the savage Golden Horde. While the West waits in fear, a bloody battle erupts inside the Khan dynasty, threatening the existence of the most powerful empire on earth.""  From this vague tidbit, you might expect a historical action epic.  That's clearly what someone wants you to believe.  That, however, is NOT what the movie is about.  ""The Horde"" is more of a faith based drama set within the Khan dynasty than a large history based adventure.  That's fine.  I actually really liked the movie.  I simply think that it is being completely misrepresented in this release.The opening of the film is set within the chambers of the reigning Khan family of Mongolia.  The film or its screenplay don't really put anything into context.  So if you don't know much about the era, you won't really learn much about it.  Instead, the sequences play out as a domestic drama as one brother replaces another as the head of the clan.  When the matriarch (a stunning Roza Khayrullina) goes blind, her devoted son will do anything to restore her sight.  When conventional practices don't work, he sends for a nearby Russian clergyman (a great Maksim Sukhanov) to work his Christian miracles.  Of course, being summoned to perform miracles is fraught with peril, but he really has no choice in the matter if he wants to prevent widespread bloodshed.  The body of the movie deals with his attempts to cure the mother, and the resultant struggle with faith that comes from the event.  The film is filled with glorious misery as one man tries to reconcile his religion with what is transpiring in the material world.Despite the fascinating Mongolian backdrop, Sukhanov is the lead to the piece.  The movie revolves around his struggles, both internally and externally.  And I found the movie both compelling and moving as a character study.  As I am not well versed on Russian history, I was not familiar with Saint Alexius on whom this is based, so I can't judge it on historical merit.  As a movie, however, I was really fascinated by this tale.  In  particular, I thought all of the performances were vivid and memorable.  In the end, the movie will probably be harmed by its misleading representation.  There is violence, to be sure, but this is not a action oriented movie.  It doesn't have the sweep of a historical epic, either.  Instead, it tells an intimate and very singular story.  But that tale is told quite well.

1641222,A11HB3LYLIQNZP,B00BYS0SV8,"PhiloX ""PhiloX""","[6, 6]","I am shock at the low reviews in Amazon but I can't blame them. I saw this movie on a religious Russian web site more than a year ago & it was advertised as the life of St. Alexius, the Metropolitan of Moscow, who prayed over & healed Taidula's blindness who was the mother of the Khan Janibeg in 1357. This movie is neither a historical documentary nor a historical fictional account on the last days of the Mongol Golden Horde instead this movie is a religious epic about a Holy Saint in Russia. The movie does over play the harshness & spiritual depravity of the Horde & over lengthens the punishment given to St. Alexius when his first attempts to heal Taidula's blindness fails. Nowhere in the history books is it written that the Saint had to wait, but that Taidula's cure of blindness was a fast & clear miracle. I guess the punishments given to St. Alexius made great movie making. There are some humorous elements as in St. Alexius's side kick novice monk who turns to other religions to save his physical dilemma but he comes around before the Metropolitan says to him ""Just wait until I get you back to Moscow"". I am guessing at this translation because I saw the movie via a web site with spoken Russian & Mongolian languages with no English sub-titles. The Good news: this DVD comes with both English sub-titles & duped English.How did, or who wrote the main preview on this DVD? As another Amazon reviewer wrote ""Did they watch the movie?""
