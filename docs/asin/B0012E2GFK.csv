1136473,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0012E2GFK,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Wristcutters- A Love Story wasn't a very funny or interesting love comedy to me.  In fact I see nothing but flaws and problems with the entire thing.  It's not a dark enough comedy to be edgy or impactful.  It's about the character of Patrick Fugit who commits suicide one day in the most anti-climactic way possible and ends up in purgatory (which is nothing more than a small desert town where nothing exciting happens).  I thought it was kind of ridiculous to have the setting be a place that actually exists with gas stations, homes and highways; places many of us have probably been at some point in our lives.  Then again if you hated your time in these small desert/mountainous towns, you might think it IS a suitable place of punishment!Anyway the only real notable parts come when Patrick's character interacts with the other people of this bland quiet place and he finds out how they too have died.  For a while this stuff is mildly amusing but the biggest flaw comes in how dry and uninteresting the main characters are and how they never grow or become better over the course of the entire film.Patrick's character is flat the entire way through, Shannyn Sossamon's character is that of an uptight young girl who we believe is leaning towards a romantic involvement with Patrick Fugit but she ends up seeming disinterested and would rather venture out on her own making the scenes with Patrick look completely unbelievable and her character lacks focus for most of the movie, and the only character that perks my interest -a Russian guy played by Goran Dukic- is only interesting because of his offbeat way of interacting with Patrick's character during car rides.  These 3 characters all take a road trip across these lonely desert highways and find themselves getting in trouble.  Well not necessarily ""trouble""- more like little mischievous situations that never amount to anything worthwhile.The problem is that the characters are constantly boring and the storyline never even tries to pick up and go anywhere.  You certainly don't care about Patrick's relationship issues with either Shannyn or Leslie Bibb, and after an hour you can't wait until the movie finishes.  I'm not sure where the comedy or the enticing storyline is supposed to occur, or how this is in *any* way a successful ""love story"" but the entire concept was completely lost on me.  It's too nonchalant/lighthearted to be a startling take on suicide so no worries there.

And watch WRISTCUTTERS: A LOVE STORY before you pull out that razor blade, swallow those pills, or pop that gun barrel into your mouth. The world beyond is not what you want!Zia (Patrick Fugit) is so depressed about his girlfriend leaving him, he feels he cannot go on. One slit of the wrists and it's bye-bye boy. But what lay beyond for Zia? Well, it ain't any prettier. In fact, it's downright depressing. No laughter. No smiles. An empty road full of empty lives lay ahead. Or so it seems.Zia runs into another lost soul named Eugene (Shea Whigham,Tigerland) who has a car and the two spark up an unusual relationship. Zia pines only for his lost love Desiree (Leslie Bibb,Talladega Nights) while Eugene wanders aimlessly (or so it seems) through this netherworld. That is, until Zia finds out that Desiree has committed suicide, too! Yes! Love cannot be denied, even in this depressing purgatory. But how to find her? Of course. Road trip! Zia and Eugene set out to find Desiree but run into several speed-bumps. Headlights that don't work. No air conditioning. And even a black hole that exists under the passenger's seat that swallows up sunglasses or anything else dropped in its direction. But none of this prepares Zia for his run-in with Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon,Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang), another lost soul that they find hitchhiking along an empty road. But Mikal claims she didn't commit suicide, and is looking for the people that ""run this place."" The journeys of the threesome interlock in unusual ways, including a romance that will play itself out in the end of all ends.Most interesting about Wristcutters is that symbolism plays a huge role. And that symbolism is actually quite funny. The fact that no one is able to smile is very funny considering the circumstances surrounding the deaths of those that are in this unhappy place. Parasailers are seen as enforcement officers (archangels?) And whoever does run this place doesn't want these souls to leave (which includes allowing suicides to happen a second time). There are also entire families of suiciders who help prove that mental illness can be genetic. And Eugene's death by pouring ""Dead Guy Ale"" over his electric guitar is something that is sure to elicit chuckles from just about everyone.Eugene is not as he seems (""You must have friends in high places"") nor is just about everyone in the film. The ending certainly makes this abundantly clear (which I won't spoil for those who decide to watch this). But I will say that I'm glad they decided to go with the ending on the DVD and not the alternate; that would've been TRULY depressing instead of depressingly funny.Even with its dark comedy, Wristcutters isn't going to be for everyone. The comedy isn't in your face or, sometimes, even self-evident. Occasionally you have to dig deep to find the witticisms but find them you will.There are some weak points to the film, most notably the production standards and some of the very lame sets, but these can be overlooked (if somewhat difficultly) by enjoying the deathly guffaws.",3,Suicide: It Ain't For Sissies!,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,3095,"['Thinking', 'suicide', 'Think', 'again', 'watch', 'WRISTCUTTERS', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'pull', 'out', 'razor', 'blade', 'swallow', 'pills', 'pop', 'gun', 'barrel', 'mouth', 'world', 'not', 'what', 'want', 'Zia', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'so', 'depressed', 'girlfriend', 'leaving', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'One', 'slit', 'wrists', 'bye-bye', 'boy', 'what', 'lay', 'Zia', 'Well', 'ai', ""n't"", 'prettier', 'fact', 'downright', 'depressing', 'laughter', 'smiles', 'empty', 'road', 'full', 'empty', 'lives', 'lay', 'ahead', 'lost', 'soul', 'named', 'Eugene', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'Tigerland', 'who', 'car', 'two', 'spark', 'unusual', 'relationship', 'Zia', 'only', 'lost', 'love', 'Desiree', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Eugene', 'wanders', 'aimlessly', 'so', 'netherworld', 'Zia', 'out', 'Desiree', 'committed', 'suicide', 'too', 'Yes', 'Love', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'even', 'depressing', 'purgatory', 'how', 'find', 'course', 'Road', 'trip', 'Zia', 'Eugene', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'Desiree', 'run', 'several', 'speed-bumps', 'Headlights', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'air', 'conditioning', 'even', 'black', 'hole', 'passenger', 'seat', 'up', 'sunglasses', 'anything', 'else', 'dropped', 'direction', 'none', 'Zia', 'run-in', 'Mikal', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'Kiss', 'Kiss', 'Bang', 'Bang', 'lost', 'soul', 'find', 'hitchhiking', 'along', 'empty', 'road', 'Mikal', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'suicide', 'looking', 'people', 'run', 'place', 'journeys', 'threesome', 'interlock', 'unusual', 'ways', 'including', 'romance', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'end', 'ends.Most', 'interesting', 'Wristcutters', 'symbolism', 'huge', 'role', 'symbolism', 'actually', 'quite', 'funny', 'fact', 'one', 'able', 'smile', 'very', 'funny', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'deaths', 'are', 'unhappy', 'place', 'Parasailers', 'are', 'seen', 'enforcement', 'officers', 'archangels', 'run', 'place', ""n't"", 'want', 'souls', 'leave', 'allowing', 'suicides', 'happen', 'second', 'time', 'are', 'also', 'entire', 'families', 'suiciders', 'who', 'help', 'prove', 'mental', 'illness', 'can', 'be', 'genetic', 'Eugene', 'death', 'pouring', 'Dead', 'Guy', 'Ale', 'electric', 'guitar', 'something', 'sure', 'elicit', 'chuckles', 'just', 'everyone.Eugene', 'not', 'must', 'have', 'friends', 'high', 'places', 'just', 'everyone', 'film', 'ending', 'certainly', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'who', 'decide', 'watch', 'will', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'decided', 'go', 'ending', 'DVD', 'not', 'alternate', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'TRULY', 'depressing', 'instead', 'depressingly', 'funny.Even', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Wristcutters', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'everyone', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'face', 'sometimes', 'even', 'self-evident', 'Occasionally', 'have', 'dig', 'deep', 'find', 'witticisms', 'find', 'are', 'weak', 'points', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'production', 'standards', 'very', 'lame', 'sets', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'somewhat', 'difficultly', 'enjoying', 'deathly', 'guffaws']",N/A

1136481,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B0012E2GFK,Douglas King,"[1, 1]","""Wristcutters"" is a movie about people who are all stuck in a sort of limbo populated by people who have committed suicide. The main character, Zia (The adorably sincere Patrick Fugit) is surprised to find that life after suicide is even more bleak than life before. Mostly, the people who inhabit this limbo just hang out, drink, work at menial jobs, and wander around in a daze. It's only when Zia discovers that his girlfriend, whose rejection drove him to suicide in the first place, also killed herself and is inhabiting the same world, that he decides to embark on a road trip to find her.For such morose subject matter, the film isn't really very heavy at all. It's more strange, surreal, and comic. The film is filled with odd, imaginative touches (like the black hole that exists at the bottom of the junkheap car Zia travels in). And although the film occassionally flirts with social commentary, at it's heart it's really a romantic comedy.

I went into this film expecting ""big things,"" which was a rookie-mistake. I quickly became frustrated with the poor film-quality and the overall low-budget feel. However, once I let go of those judgments, I was able to enjoy the film for what it is, an indie fairytale for ""weirdos"" (like me).Overall, the casting is delightful. You may recognize Patrick Fugit (Zia) from his brief stint onER - Ninth Season. Stuck in this stagnant ""purgatory,"" Zia seeks his former girlfriend (who also committed suicide shortly after him). His road-tripping friends include a ""kooky"" Russian and a ""spunky"" gal who got stuck in this dull world by accident (played byA Knight's TaleShannyn Sossamon). Granted a bit-part, Azura Skye is (yet again) a suicide victim (reprising her role in the  frighteningly bad28 Days). In a strange way, it's a relief to see her reclaim that (lame) role and do something genuinely interesting with it! Will Arnett's appearance was a pleasant surprise (and provided a nice spin to the story) ... it was entirely refreshing for him to tackle a role that isn't necessarily funny (in contrast to his work onArrested Development,30 Rock, and inBlades of Glory).The writing was fantastic!! The ennui of this alternate world is palpable. (I have already ordered Etgar Keret'sThe Bus Driver Who Wanted To Be God & Other Storieswhich contains the short-story ""Kneller's Happy Campers"" from which the film was adapted.) Now, occasionally, the writing feels ""awkward"" but this is the result of some stunningly ""bad"" (read: low-budget) graphics (especially the ""black hole"" scenes). Don't fight these moments and you will enjoy the film.The conclusion solidified the fairytale feel ... and, though both predictable and extraordinarily problematic, I found it somewhat gratifying.I genuinely wish that Dukic was granted better funding (this is rough even for an indie) ... but, as is, Wristcutters is worth your attention (if only for the fact that psychologists were ""up in arms"" over the film!!)Suggested Reading:Keret, Etgar (and artist Asaf Hanuka).Pizzeria Kamikaze.

1136483,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0012E2GFK,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Most romantic comedies take place in... you know, the world of the living. They rarely star dead people. And not suicides, either.But ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"" is not going to be tied down by that. This delicious, dark little cult film is about people who have committed suicide, and are now stuck in a limbo zone that is just like the living world, but less appealing. It's also dark, funny and poignant -- everything you want in a very original little indie movie.Because of a breakup, Zia (Patrick Fugit) has decided that life is no longer worth living. He cleans his house, slits his wrists -- and finds himself in a strange twilight-zone with no sunshine, smiles, or appetizing food, and entirely populated by suicides -- think a Midwestern small town, but more depressing. He eventually gets a job, a nasty roommate, and befriends Eugene (Shea Whigham) a likably bombastic Russian rocker.But then Zia learns from a new suicide that his girlfriend, Desiree (Leslie Bibb) has also offed herself. So he and Eugene bundle into Eugene's horrible old car, and start a road trip to find her -- picking up the pretty, feisty Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who says she's been placed there mistakenly. The odd trio rattles through this suicide world, until they stumble across a strange camp in the wilderness...I first heard about ""Wristcutters"" a long while ago, on myspace -- but in the months that followed, it just sort of floated in a limbo of its own. Pretty frustrating, but Goran Dukic actually makes it worth waiting for -- it's a quirky and dark indie comedy, a tragedy, and a love story all in one.As you can probably guess, the movie's main message is that you should live a life worth enjoying, and love someone worth loving. Yeah, the core of it is a guy who loses the girl, kills himself, tries to regain the girl, and falls in love with the worthier choice -- all while wondering if love is still possible for those whose hearts have stopped.But that potentially soppy message is wrapped up in clever little quirks in Wristcutterville (Zia works at ""Kamikaze Pizza"") or the various deaths of the people who live there (Eugene electrocuted himself to get the crowd to pay attention). It feels pleasantly, wistfully warped -- both with macabre humour (the hole-in-the-head cop) and delicious dialogue (""I'm not going out tonight. It just makes me depressed."" ""So, what you gonna do? Kill yourself?"").And you gotta admit, this postmodern Purgatorio is an interesting concept -- it's portrayed with a sort of low-budget magical realism. Suicide wounds, pale faces, bleak landscape, and ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" is a popular tune. It's pretty fitting that the place for those who have given up hope is a place where hope and joy are nonexistant.It also has a very pleasant, poignant ending -- yeah, it seems like a bit of a cop-out, but somehow by the time we got there, I didn't mind. It ties in with the lesson of the movie, and the poignant little love between Zia and Mikal.Fugit is a likably confused, sweet character who is just a bit dense, since it takes him awhile to figure out what a great, funny girl Mikal is. And Whigham -- whose character was partly based on Gogol Bordello's Eugene Hutz -- rules all the scenes he's in, as one of the few suicides who still has his vitality, libido and humour intact (""Everyone knows that man in back does not have c**k"").Sad, quirky and poignant, ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"" is an offbeat love/road-trip movie in the land of suicides -- it's a brilliantly warped little cult movie, and definitely worth seeing.",5,Amor e morte,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,3569,"['Most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'take', 'place', 'know', 'world', 'living', 'rarely', 'star', 'dead', 'people', 'not', 'suicides', 'either.But', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'tied', 'down', 'delicious', 'dark', 'little', 'cult', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'committed', 'suicide', 'are', 'now', 'stuck', 'limbo', 'zone', 'just', 'living', 'world', 'less', 'appealing', 'also', 'dark', 'funny', 'poignant', 'everything', 'want', 'very', 'original', 'little', 'indie', 'movie.Because', 'breakup', 'Zia', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'decided', 'life', 'longer', 'worth', 'living', 'house', 'wrists', 'strange', 'twilight-zone', 'sunshine', 'smiles', 'appetizing', 'food', 'entirely', 'populated', 'suicides', 'think', 'Midwestern', 'small', 'town', 'more', 'depressing', 'eventually', 'job', 'nasty', 'roommate', 'befriends', 'Eugene', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'likably', 'bombastic', 'Russian', 'rocker.But', 'then', 'Zia', 'new', 'suicide', 'girlfriend', 'Desiree', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'also', 'offed', 'Eugene', 'bundle', 'Eugene', 'horrible', 'old', 'car', 'start', 'road', 'trip', 'find', 'picking', 'up', 'pretty', 'feisty', 'Mikal', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'who', 'been', 'placed', 'mistakenly', 'odd', 'trio', 'suicide', 'world', 'stumble', 'strange', 'camp', 'wilderness', 'first', 'heard', 'Wristcutters', 'long', 'while', 'ago', 'myspace', 'months', 'followed', 'just', 'sort', 'floated', 'limbo', 'own', 'Pretty', 'frustrating', 'Goran', 'Dukic', 'actually', 'worth', 'waiting', 'quirky', 'dark', 'indie', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'love', 'story', 'one.As', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'movie', 'main', 'message', 'should', 'live', 'life', 'worth', 'enjoying', 'love', 'someone', 'worth', 'loving', 'Yeah', 'core', 'guy', 'who', 'girl', 'regain', 'girl', 'love', 'worthier', 'choice', 'wondering', 'love', 'still', 'possible', 'hearts', 'have', 'stopped.But', 'potentially', 'soppy', 'message', 'wrapped', 'up', 'clever', 'little', 'quirks', 'Wristcutterville', 'Zia', 'Kamikaze', 'Pizza', 'various', 'deaths', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'Eugene', 'electrocuted', 'get', 'crowd', 'pay', 'attention', 'pleasantly', 'wistfully', 'warped', 'macabre', 'humour', 'hole-in-the-head', 'cop', 'delicious', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'out', 'tonight', 'just', 'depressed', 'So', 'what', 'gon', 'do', 'Kill', '.And', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'postmodern', 'Purgatorio', 'interesting', 'concept', 'portrayed', 'sort', 'low-budget', 'magical', 'realism', 'Suicide', 'pale', 'bleak', 'landscape', 'Love', 'Will', 'Tear', 'Us', 'Apart', 'popular', 'tune', 'pretty', 'fitting', 'place', 'who', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'hope', 'place', 'where', 'hope', 'joy', 'are', 'nonexistant.It', 'also', 'very', 'pleasant', 'poignant', 'ending', 'yeah', 'bit', 'cop-out', 'somehow', 'time', 'got', 'there', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'lesson', 'movie', 'poignant', 'little', 'love', 'Zia', 'Mikal.Fugit', 'likably', 'confused', 'sweet', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'bit', 'dense', 'awhile', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'great', 'funny', 'girl', 'Mikal', 'Whigham', 'character', 'was', 'partly', 'based', 'Gogol', 'Bordello', 'Eugene', 'Hutz', 'rules', 'scenes', 'one', 'few', 'suicides', 'who', 'still', 'vitality', 'libido', 'humour', 'intact', 'Everyone', 'man', 'back', 'not', 'have', 'c**k', '.Sad', 'quirky', 'poignant', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'offbeat', 'love/road-trip', 'movie', 'land', 'suicides', 'brilliantly', 'warped', 'little', 'cult', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Wristcutters is a quest narrative, a road trip story, a romance, and ultimately less tragic than you might expect.  It's also extremely funny, with humor ranging from slapstick to black.  For example, most of the characters are established with a shot of how they offed themselves.  This is much funnier than you might expect.  (Which wouldn't be hard since it doesn't sound funny at all.)Director Goran Dukic made a pretty good movie, despite the obviously indie-sized budget.  Some of the effects are laughable, but he does a good job of making the landscape seem otherworldly and slightly magic.  And the soundtrack is amazing.  In addition to Tom Waits (who plays a character in the movie as well as providing music), there's a bunch of Gogol Bordello and I love me some Gogol Bordello.  (Apparently the character of Eugene was inspired by the band's lead singer.)  And of course ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" is popular in a Purgatory for suicides.I haven't read the short story Wristcutters is based on (""Neller's Happy Campers"" by Etgar Keret), but I want too in order to compare the two.  I hope the story is as funny, charming, and poignant as the movie.  But even if it isn't any good, I can just watch the movie again.

I will admit that I had a smile on my face throughout however, even if no one in the Purgatory-like setting is allowed to.  Patrick Fugit (""Almost Famous"") stars as a young man whose girlfriend just dumped him.  He decides he can't go on, so he cleans his room and offs himself by slashing his wrists with a razor blade.  When he comes around he finds himself dead in a fantasy world not unlike the one he just left.  Except that all the inhabitants are also suicides.He strikes up a relationship with a Russian rocker named Eugene played by Shea Whigham (TV's ""Boardwalk Empire"").  After finding out that Zia's (Fugit) girlfriend also committed suicide they venture out across the landscape (looks like the American West) to find her.  Along the way they pick up a cute hitchhiker (Shannyn Sossamon first seen in ""A Knight's Tale"") and the threesome travel on, not knowing exactly where they are headed.I'm not sure the director did either.  About halfway through, I pretty much figured out the ending, but the movie meanders a bit getting there.  The film does have a unique charm about it aided by some unusual characters.  In particular Tom Waits plays the head of a hippy-like troupe living in the middle of the high desert.  Filling out the cast in small roles are Leslie Bibb (""Lost"") as girlfriend Desiree, Oscar nominee John Hawkes, funnyman Will Arnett, Nick Offerman (""Parks and Recreation""), and many other familiar faces.

1136497,A1D3XQC2DIT,B0012E2GFK,Peter Shermeta,"[1, 2]","After what one would assume to be a pretty difficult breakup with his girlfriend, Zia commits suicide. Next thing he knows he is in a world -- not unlike the one he left behind -- where everyone he meets has committed suicide. When Zia runs into someone he knew pre-suicide, he learns that his ex-girlfriend chose the same fate and was thus somewhere in this strange world. This news gives his after-life new meaning and he sets out to find her.A story of a lonely heart setting out to find its compliment, either in a specific other person or someone unexpected who appears along the way, is nothing revolutionary. Wristcutters, as it followed that template, was in many ways like most romantic comedies you have already seen. That doesn't make this movie any better or worse by comparison, because many people still seek out as many ""RomComs"" as they can. What this movie did well was expand the limits within which that template may be used.There is nothing ""ordinary"" about a story where a young man, who has killed himself, is stuck in a purgatory for people who claimed their own lives searching for his ex-girlfriend, who despite being the reason he killed himself, also killed herself. Will he find her? Will he meet a different girl (or guy?) who killed herself and fall in love with her? Is Wristcutters good enough for you to watch it and find out? Yes, it is.I liked this movie, but I do think it got by mostly on the quirkiness of its setting and premise. I will admit that I'm a little too conservative to enjoy how they made suicide so matter-of-fact, but I still enjoyed the movie.

Shannyn Sossamon is delightful, the appearance of Tom Waits is always fun, and there's a wonderful turn from Shea Whigham, who centers most everything with guidance, wisdom and reckless behavior. It's hard to describe, but it's a terrific lesson against teen suicide, a subject that could be very un-PC, if not in the hands of visionary Dukic.

1136501,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0012E2GFK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Wristcutters: A Love Story (Goran Dukic, 2006)I was somehow unaware until the main titles were rolling on Wristcutters: A Love Story that it was based on Etgar Keret's graphic novel Pizzeria Kamikaze, which has been on my list of stuff to go digging for at the library for just about ever. So as soon as the movie was over, I went digging, and so I'll be comparing the two side by side (see below for PK review), and pretty much by definition there's going to be a lot of comparing of the two. Especially where a graphic novel adaptation is concerned, I'm always expecting slavish devotion to the source material (unless stuff goes on the novel it's simply not possible to film without millions of dollars' worth of special effects, unless you're Zack Snyder). And somehow, despite knowing this will never happen, I always end up wondering to myself what on earth director X and screenwriter Y were thinking when they decided to change detail Z, which doesn't save time or money, but ends up confusing the hell out of the viewer. I got a lot more of that in Wristcutters; it was only after reading Pizzeria Kamikaze that a few quirks in the personalities of the characters made sense. (I will give Dukic one huge bonus, though, for making Eugene into a failed musician, because this movie's soundtrack is everything that so many crappy indie soundtracks have tried to be recently and failed.)Plot: depressed emo kid Zia (Deadbirds' Patrick Fugit), whose girlfriend has just broken up with him, decides to kill himself. He succeeds, and when he wakes up in the afterlife, ""it's a lot like Tel Aviv, only a little bit worse."" He finds himself a job at Pizzeria Kamikaze, whose logo is wonderful, and PK's owner helps him find a place to live. Unfortunately it comes with an insane Austrian roommate (ER's Abraham Benrubi), and so Zia spends a lot of his time out at a local bar. It's there he meets Erik (Splinter's Shea Wigham), an Eastern European musician. The two of them begin to pal around, and when Zia finds out that his ex (The Midnight Meat Train's Leslie Bibb) killed herself about a month after he did, he enlists Erik (and Erik's car) and heads out on a grand quest to reclaim his lost love. Along the way, the two of them meet hitchhiker Mikal (Catacombs's Shannyn Sossamon), who throws every expected monkeywrench into the journey.The big change here is the characters' names and nationalities. The names are just kind of confusing, and that's what I was referring to in the opening paragraph; why bother changing the characters' names, of all things? The nationality thing is a little more problematic, because some of the jokes come off as less funny (or in the case of Erik's phobia of Arabs, which at least makes sense for an Israeli, outright racist), and some of the characters' tics or modes of expression make a little less sense. If they share a culture, rather than being from three wildly disparate cultures, they have at least something in common that will allow them that first bonding, and the lack of it here jars a bit, where it all works perfectly in the book from which this is adapted. (And, jeez, that ending.)Not to say that Wristcutters is a bad movie. In fact, it's a pretty good one, really. Fugit is one of those actors who does a fine, fine job with whatever material he's given, and if you haven't yet experienced the joy that is Shea Whigham, do yourself a big favor and check out a silly, but loads of fun, direct-to-video release from 2008 called Splinter, where he steals the show as effortlessly as if he were the lead. His performance here shows he's not just a one-trick pony; this is about as different a role as it could have been, and he's just as good here. Aside from a few odd juxtapositions and problems that come from breaking with the source material, this is a solid little flick with a lot to like about it; it's worth checking out. *** ",4,"Has some problems, but still good.",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,3895,"['Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'Goran', 'Dukic', '2006', 'was', 'somehow', 'unaware', 'main', 'titles', 'were', 'rolling', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'was', 'based', 'Etgar', 'Keret', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Pizzeria', 'Kamikaze', 'been', 'list', 'stuff', 'go', 'digging', 'library', 'just', 'ever', 'So', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'was', 'went', 'digging', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'comparing', 'two', 'side', 'side', 'see', 'PK', 'review', 'pretty', 'much', 'definition', 'going', 'be', 'lot', 'comparing', 'two', 'Especially', 'where', 'graphic', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'concerned', ""'m"", 'always', 'expecting', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'source', 'material', 'stuff', 'novel', 'simply', 'not', 'possible', 'film', 'millions', 'dollars', 'worth', 'special', 'effects', ""'re"", 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'somehow', 'knowing', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'myself', 'what', 'earth', 'director', 'X', 'screenwriter', 'Y', 'were', 'thinking', 'when', 'decided', 'change', 'detail', 'Z', ""n't"", 'save', 'time', 'money', 'up', 'confusing', 'hell', 'viewer', 'got', 'lot', 'more', 'Wristcutters', 'was', 'only', 'reading', 'Pizzeria', 'Kamikaze', 'few', 'quirks', 'personalities', 'characters', 'made', 'sense', 'will', 'give', 'Dukic', 'one', 'huge', 'bonus', 'though', 'making', 'Eugene', 'failed', 'musician', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'everything', 'so', 'many', 'crappy', 'indie', 'soundtracks', 'have', 'tried', 'be', 'recently', 'failed', 'Plot', 'depressed', 'emo', 'kid', 'Zia', 'Deadbirds', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'kill', 'when', 'up', 'afterlife', 'lot', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'worse', 'job', 'Pizzeria', 'Kamikaze', 'logo', 'wonderful', 'PK', 'owner', 'find', 'place', 'live', 'insane', 'Austrian', 'roommate', 'ER', 'Abraham', 'Benrubi', 'so', 'Zia', 'lot', 'time', 'out', 'local', 'bar', 'there', 'Erik', 'Splinter', 'Shea', 'Wigham', 'Eastern', 'European', 'musician', 'two', 'begin', 'pal', 'when', 'Zia', 'out', 'ex', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'killed', 'month', 'did', 'Erik', 'Erik', 'car', 'out', 'grand', 'quest', 'reclaim', 'lost', 'love', 'way', 'two', 'meet', 'hitchhiker', 'Mikal', 'Catacombs', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'who', 'expected', 'monkeywrench', 'journey.The', 'big', 'change', 'here', 'characters', 'names', 'nationalities', 'names', 'are', 'just', 'kind', 'confusing', 'what', 'was', 'referring', 'opening', 'paragraph', 'why', 'bother', 'changing', 'characters', 'names', 'things', 'nationality', 'thing', 'little', 'more', 'problematic', 'jokes', 'come', 'off', 'less', 'funny', 'case', 'Erik', 'phobia', 'Arabs', 'least', 'sense', 'Israeli', 'outright', 'racist', 'characters', 'tics', 'modes', 'expression', 'make', 'little', 'less', 'sense', 'share', 'culture', 'rather', 'being', 'three', 'wildly', 'disparate', 'cultures', 'have', 'least', 'something', 'common', 'will', 'allow', 'first', 'bonding', 'lack', 'here', 'bit', 'where', 'perfectly', 'book', 'adapted', 'jeez', 'ending', 'Not', 'say', 'Wristcutters', 'bad', 'movie', 'fact', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'really', 'Fugit', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'fine', 'fine', 'job', 'material', 'given', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'experienced', 'joy', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'do', 'big', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'silly', 'loads', 'fun', 'direct-to-video', 'release', '2008', 'called', 'Splinter', 'where', 'show', 'as', 'effortlessly', 'were', 'lead', 'performance', 'here', 'not', 'just', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'about', 'as', 'different', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'here', 'Aside', 'few', 'odd', 'juxtapositions', 'problems', 'come', 'breaking', 'source', 'material', 'solid', 'little', 'flick', 'lot', 'like', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', '***']",N/A

And, oh yea, there's a black hole under the passenger seat of the rusted-out orange station wagon our intrepid characters are riding in. These include Zia (Patrick Fugit), who slashed his wrists after he broke up with his girlfriend, Desiree (Leslie Bibb), and Eugene (Shea Whigham), a Russian guitarist who electrocuted himself on stage in front of a particularly unappreciative audience. Together, they go on a road trip through the desert in search of Desiree, who apparently offed herself not long after Zia did.  The two pick up a hitchhiker, Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), the victim of a fatal overdose, who joins them in their quest.The irony of this wry and offbeat little journey into surrealism is that, while the premise may be all about death, the movie itself is actually a celebration of life and of all the unique and wonderful things that are contained therein - the heartache and the joy, the friendships and the rivalries, and, above all, the chance to make things right again if you just hang in there and persevere through all the obstacles and rough patches that life is bound and determined to throw at you.And the ending is about as life-affirming as any movie about suicide could ever hope to be.",4,A captivating journey into surrealism,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,1530,"['****1/2The', 'clever', 'imaginative', 'indie', 'comedy', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'written', 'directed', 'Goran', 'Dukic', 'place', 'world', 'populated', 'entirely', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'committed', 'suicide', 'land', 'everything', 'live', 'world', 'offer', 'apparently', 'sky', 'full', 'stars', 'cell', 'phone', 'reception', 'oh', 'yea', 'black', 'hole', 'passenger', 'seat', 'rusted-out', 'orange', 'station', 'intrepid', 'characters', 'are', 'riding', 'include', 'Zia', 'Patrick', 'Fugit', 'who', 'slashed', 'wrists', 'broke', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Desiree', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'Eugene', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'Russian', 'guitarist', 'who', 'electrocuted', 'stage', 'front', 'particularly', 'unappreciative', 'audience', 'Together', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'desert', 'search', 'Desiree', 'who', 'apparently', 'offed', 'not', 'long', 'Zia', 'did', 'two', 'pick', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'Mikal', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'victim', 'fatal', 'overdose', 'who', 'quest.The', 'irony', 'wry', 'offbeat', 'little', 'journey', 'surrealism', 'premise', 'may', 'be', 'death', 'movie', 'actually', 'celebration', 'life', 'unique', 'wonderful', 'things', 'are', 'contained', 'heartache', 'joy', 'friendships', 'rivalries', 'chance', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'again', 'just', 'hang', 'there', 'persevere', 'obstacles', 'rough', 'patches', 'life', 'bound', 'determined', 'throw', 'ending', 'as', 'life-affirming', 'movie', 'suicide', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'be']",N/A

The main story is a young man who dies and is looking for his lost love as he befirends a few others along the way.The prosI LIKED THE idea of people dying and going to a worse or better version of their current lives rather than heaven or hell. The acting was pretty good in my opinion with his Russian friend being the funniest character in the film. A good love story to watch with your girl friend. I also kind of like films that don't have a ton of things blowing up or fight scenes some times. I like the facts that you have a bunch of friends on a long road trip bonding as they reach their goal. The film also has directors commentary and deleted scenes for people who like those tpe of things.The consI really wish they had went into some more details about the PIC people in charge and what they did exactley and why. I would have liked them to explore the causes of and issues of suicide a bit more. I also would have liked to know more of how things work in this after life as compared to the real world. There is a brief scene of one character slitting his wrist and another threatning to commit suicide by hanging  that might turn some viewers off. Also the film didn't feel like it really had any plot to be honest or much of one at times. I kind of was left wanting more from a story telling stand point.ConclusionI liked the film.

1136510,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0012E2GFK,trashcanman,"[1, 2]","Not convinced?  Fine, be that way.  ""Wristcutters: A Love Story"" is a typical offbeat indie flick with all of the positives and negatives that come with that particular label.  Hip self-awareness, black comedy, a tomboyishly sexy waif as the female lead, a meandering plot (if you can call it that), and quirky characters all figure heavily into the indie vibe here.  If this turns you off, move along.  But if the premise appeals to you and you're willing to wait for a payoff, then sit back and enjoy.The genius of ""Wristcutters"" (besides the title) is the world it's characters inhabit.  It's a bland afterlife for the pathetic souls who have committed suicide.  No true happiness, no true sadness, no joy or pain, just a mere existence that is oppressing in and of itself.  A poetic reward/punishment for those who chose to escape the pain of life if ever there as one.  After all, without pain there can be no joy and vice-versa.  each inhabitant is unable to even crack a smile.  As we are introduced to our cast of characters, we get flashes of their fates in life.  The protagonist, Zia, slashed his wrists after his girlfriend dumped him.  His best bud, Eugene -who is apparently meant to be Eugene Hutz of the gypsy punk bandGogol Bordello(who I'm a huge fan of)- poured beer on his guitar and electrocuted himself onstage while being heckled.  He proudly tells Zia that Iggy Pop was almost at that show.  It would probably be worth it to off yourself onstage if Iggy was there to see it.  This nonchalant and morbid humor really draws one into the film, but it unfortunately isn't consistently sustained.  Upon hearing that the girl he killed himself over followed suit and committed suicide as well, Zia finds himself once again obsessed with her and is determined to find her, thinking that perhaps she came to be with him.  AFTERLIFE ROAD TRIIIIIIP!!!!  Along the way, the pair pick up a hitchhiker named Mikal who just so happens to be a charming, gorgeous, free-spirited indie girl with an amusing obsession with defacing and destroying signs in an attempt to lighten the atmosphere of their new homeland.  After all, she is there by mistake (or so she says) and is just looking for the ""people in charge"" so she can straighten the whole thing out.Wait, wait.  Emo guy and quirky best bud pick up hitchhiking dream girl while he's busy pining for the girlfriend who rejected him?  Okay, so you already know how this plays out.  But did you know that Eugene's car has a black hole under the seat so anything you drop under it vanishes?  Oh, right; everyone has that.  Well, the car is also held together with duct tape.  Gotta love that.  Also, you've gotta love Eugene pulling out a tape of his old band and treating the ignorant masses to some Gogol Bordello.  There's even a sing-along. God bless you, indie directors, and your constant shoving of your favorite musical artists into our collective faces.  You rock!  More bonus points awarded for a self-proclaimed messiah who committed suicide in life to show everyone how to set their spirit free and then kills himself in the afterlife hoping to show everyone how to get back after deciding it wasn't all it was cracked up to be.  Vicious circle, yeah?  Also, it's nice to know that dogs can commit suicide as well.The cast is endearing, the premise is fantastic, the quirks are charming, and the soundtrack is different.  But on the other hand, the middle of the film drags like a sumb!+ch.  There's probably a good half hour or so where it seems like damn near nothing is happening.  Sure, it's setting up for the finale, but it seems to take longer in a film where literally nobody smiles.  When the characters all seem so bored with everything, there is definitely an energy loss there that needs to be filled.  But patience will pay off and the ending is pretty damn romantic if I may say so.  Ignore the fact that it throws a ton of WTF's at you at once after lollygagging for so long and just enjoy Shannyn Sossamon's beautiful smile.""And as we're crossing border after borderWe realize that difference is noneIt's underdogs who, and if you want itYou always have to make your own fun""3 1/2 stars rounded up for uniqueness.",4,The title alone sells this one.,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",2009,4201,"['Not', 'convinced', 'Fine', 'be', 'way', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'typical', 'offbeat', 'indie', 'flick', 'positives', 'negatives', 'come', 'particular', 'label', 'Hip', 'self-awareness', 'black', 'comedy', 'tomboyishly', 'sexy', 'waif', 'female', 'lead', 'meandering', 'plot', 'can', 'call', 'quirky', 'characters', 'figure', 'heavily', 'indie', 'vibe', 'here', 'off', 'move', 'along', 'premise', 'appeals', ""'re"", 'willing', 'wait', 'payoff', 'then', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy.The', 'genius', 'Wristcutters', 'title', 'world', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'bland', 'afterlife', 'pathetic', 'souls', 'who', 'have', 'committed', 'suicide', 'true', 'happiness', 'true', 'sadness', 'joy', 'pain', 'just', 'mere', 'existence', 'oppressing', 'poetic', 'reward/punishment', 'who', 'chose', 'escape', 'pain', 'life', 'ever', 'one', 'pain', 'can', 'be', 'joy', 'vice-versa', 'inhabitant', 'unable', 'even', 'crack', 'smile', 'are', 'introduced', 'cast', 'characters', 'get', 'flashes', 'fates', 'life', 'protagonist', 'Zia', 'slashed', 'wrists', 'girlfriend', 'dumped', 'best', 'bud', 'Eugene', '-who', 'apparently', 'meant', 'be', 'Eugene', 'Hutz', 'gypsy', 'punk', 'bandGogol', 'Bordello', 'who', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'poured', 'beer', 'guitar', 'electrocuted', 'onstage', 'being', 'heckled', 'proudly', 'Zia', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'was', 'almost', 'show', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'worth', 'off', 'onstage', 'Iggy', 'was', 'there', 'see', 'nonchalant', 'morbid', 'humor', 'really', 'one', 'film', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'consistently', 'sustained', 'hearing', 'girl', 'killed', 'over', 'followed', 'suit', 'committed', 'suicide', 'as', 'well', 'Zia', 'once', 'again', 'obsessed', 'determined', 'find', 'thinking', 'perhaps', 'came', 'be', 'AFTERLIFE', 'ROAD', 'TRIIIIIIP', 'way', 'pair', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'named', 'Mikal', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'charming', 'gorgeous', 'free-spirited', 'indie', 'girl', 'amusing', 'obsession', 'defacing', 'destroying', 'signs', 'attempt', 'lighten', 'atmosphere', 'new', 'homeland', 'there', 'mistake', 'so', 'just', 'looking', 'people', 'charge', 'can', 'straighten', 'whole', 'thing', 'out.Wait', 'wait', 'Emo', 'guy', 'quirky', 'best', 'bud', 'pick', 'up', 'hitchhiking', 'dream', 'girl', 'busy', 'pining', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'rejected', 'Okay', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'out', 'did', 'know', 'Eugene', 'car', 'black', 'hole', 'seat', 'so', 'anything', 'drop', 'Oh', 'right', 'everyone', 'Well', 'car', 'also', 'held', 'together', 'duct', 'tape', 'Got', 'ta', 'love', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'Eugene', 'pulling', 'out', 'tape', 'old', 'band', 'treating', 'ignorant', 'masses', 'Gogol', 'Bordello', 'even', 'sing-along', 'God', 'bless', 'indie', 'directors', 'constant', 'shoving', 'favorite', 'musical', 'artists', 'collective', 'rock', 'More', 'bonus', 'points', 'awarded', 'self-proclaimed', 'messiah', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'life', 'show', 'everyone', 'how', 'set', 'spirit', 'free', 'then', 'afterlife', 'hoping', 'show', 'everyone', 'how', 'get', 'back', 'deciding', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'Vicious', 'circle', 'yeah', 'Also', 'nice', 'know', 'dogs', 'can', 'commit', 'suicide', 'well.The', 'cast', 'endearing', 'premise', 'fantastic', 'quirks', 'are', 'charming', 'soundtrack', 'different', 'other', 'hand', 'middle', 'film', 'sumb', '+ch', 'probably', 'good', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'where', 'damn', 'nothing', 'happening', 'Sure', 'setting', 'up', 'finale', 'take', 'longer', 'film', 'where', 'literally', 'nobody', 'smiles', 'When', 'characters', 'seem', 'so', 'bored', 'everything', 'definitely', 'energy', 'loss', 'be', 'filled', 'patience', 'will', 'pay', 'off', 'ending', 'pretty', 'damn', 'romantic', 'may', 'say', 'so', 'Ignore', 'fact', 'ton', 'WTF', 'once', 'lollygagging', 'so', 'long', 'just', 'enjoy', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'beautiful', 'smile', ""'re"", 'crossing', 'border', 'borderWe', 'realize', 'difference', 'underdogs', 'who', 'want', 'itYou', 'always', 'have', 'make', 'own', 'fun', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', 'uniqueness']",N/A
