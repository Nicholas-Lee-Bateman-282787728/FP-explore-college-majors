Edward Azad,"[1, 2]","Short Circuit has long had the misfortune of being unfavorably compared to its predecessor (aka Police Academy with Robots) I'm glad that it's been getting more positive feedback nowadays; then again, it was only a matter of time considering the memorable quotes (""Los Locos kick your..."")Much of Short Circuit's 2's success is owed to Fisher Stevens, who steps awkwardly in the forefront but quickly wins you over. His character, Ben, is no longer psudo-racist comic relief. He will never receive the acclaim he deserves, but if we let Lawrence Olivier get away with playing Othello, then surely we can't fault a Caucasian guy for playing an Indian guy, right? Stevens endows Ben with a lot of heart and plays him as a sort of human counterpart to Johnny Five; both are good-hearted but lack people skills. The script still overuses Ben's tendency to mispronounce English (""How time is fun when you're having flies."") Awkward.Also worthy of praise is Michael McKean as the shifty Fred Ritter. He does surprisingly well for a brand-new character and makes a great foil to the &uuml;ber-scrupulous Ben. The scenes where Ben grows increasingly outraged by Fred's complete lack of morals still make me snicker even though I can pretty much recite the entire movie by memory. Luckily, Ben and Fred's opposing natures make them a good team.It's hard to describe, but the movie seems packed with events even though not much is happening in it. There's a trio of goons who want to rob a bank with Johnny's help, but it kind of pales to the impending peril of Johnny Five's military overlords in the prequel. Johnny's trials are a LOT more personal in this one, however; his ambush by axe-wielding thugs is outlandishly brutal and probably inappropriate in a kid's movie (big warning there). Mingled with the attack is a real sense of betrayal, too, as Johnny's naivete leads him to trust a vile individual.I saw this movie before Short Circuit 1, and it didn't hamper my enjoyment at all. It's better than the first. Don't let anyone tell you different.",5,How do I feel?

The viewer's suspension of disbelief is fully engaged- even as an adult I find myself lulled into feeling a deep sesne of pathos and compassion for Number Johnny Five. This is in part due to an amazing pre-CGI special effects/machine team and also due to the exceptionally unselfconscious acting of the human cast: Fisher Stevens ((the bad guye from hackers)) is truly phenomenal as Ben Jharvi, an Indian ((I think)) computer programmer who is as inept at expressing his feelings as Johnny Five is as understanding his own); Michael McKean and Cynthia Gibb are also great (McKean is perfect as a petty conman who betrays and then saves Johnny Five). The actors did an amazing job interacting with the machine and their performances add subtly dazzling layers of humor and sentiment to whta could have been a really awful movie but instead becomes a marvelous thing to watch.OK. The script is somewhat shoddy at times and the pacing is not so well-handled. There are some dead-end scenes, but for the most part everything really hangs together well- Johnny Five stumbles through several mishaps trying to understand why humans behave as they do and why he feels what he feels. Oh, there's a chase scene set to the godawful ""I need a hero,"" song. The kitschy 80's pop score wears a tad thin afterawhile. But then, this is a kid film at heart, and a rather unique one at that.One scene always breaks my heart, one of my all-time favorite poignant scenes: Johnny five, after being caught by the cops, is taken and chained in the police basement- the stolen property room. He is slowly reading two books, page by page. His friends come to have him released- when allowed to leave he breaks his chains easily and sadly leaves (you see, he could have left at anytime had he wanted to; there's some Sadean undertones in how #J5 repeatedly allows himself to be demeaned and debased and almost destroyed by humans without fighting back lethally- which he easily could... a postmodern and mechanical kin to Justine, perhaps).The books he was so slowly reading were Pinochio and Frankenstein. It always slays me, just like the Rockbiter's monologue in  The Never Ending Story (""They look like big, strong hands..."").This one is so much better, in my opinion, than Spielberg's execrable A.I., if only in that Stevie over-reached himself (again) on that crite film; trying to make a 'serious' film about 'serious' issues... and then he tacked on a completely odious ending.This film has no such pretensions- it mostly aims at fun. Because of that it achieves more than most serious cinema struggling with the same themes of technology and identity.",4,If Phillip K Dick had done Pinochio as a kids film...,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,3010,"['would', 'probably', 'be', 'much', 'two', 'everyman', 'protagonists', 'themes', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'yearning', 'robot', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'humane', 'human', 'counterparts', 'first', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'Movie', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'time', 'explore', 'character', 'Jonhhy', 'Five', 'invest', 'machine', 'character', 'second', 'film', 'just', 'very', 'well', 'viewer', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'fully', 'engaged-', 'even', 'adult', 'find', 'lulled', 'feeling', 'deep', 'sesne', 'pathos', 'compassion', 'Number', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'part', 'due', 'amazing', 'pre-CGI', 'special', 'effects/machine', 'team', 'also', 'due', 'exceptionally', 'unselfconscious', 'acting', 'human', 'cast', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'bad', 'guye', 'hackers', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'Ben', 'Jharvi', 'Indian', 'think', 'computer', 'programmer', 'who', 'as', 'inept', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'understanding', 'own', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Cynthia', 'Gibb', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'McKean', 'perfect', 'petty', 'conman', 'who', 'then', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'actors', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'interacting', 'machine', 'performances', 'add', 'subtly', 'dazzling', 'layers', 'humor', 'sentiment', 'whta', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'awful', 'movie', 'instead', 'marvelous', 'thing', 'watch.OK', 'script', 'somewhat', 'shoddy', 'times', 'pacing', 'not', 'so', 'well-handled', 'are', 'dead-end', 'scenes', 'most', 'part', 'everything', 'really', 'together', 'well-', 'Johnny', 'Five', 'stumbles', 'several', 'mishaps', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'humans', 'behave', 'do', 'why', 'what', 'Oh', 'chase', 'scene', 'set', 'godawful', 'need', 'hero', 'song', 'kitschy', '80', 'pop', 'score', 'tad', 'thin', 'afterawhile', 'then', 'kid', 'film', 'heart', 'rather', 'unique', 'one', 'that.One', 'scene', 'always', 'breaks', 'heart', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'Johnny', 'five', 'being', 'caught', 'cops', 'taken', 'chained', 'police', 'basement-', 'stolen', 'property', 'room', 'slowly', 'reading', 'two', 'books', 'page', 'page', 'friends', 'come', 'have', 'released-', 'when', 'allowed', 'leave', 'breaks', 'chains', 'easily', 'sadly', 'leaves', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'anytime', 'had', 'wanted', 'Sadean', 'undertones', 'how', 'J5', 'repeatedly', 'be', 'demeaned', 'debased', 'almost', 'destroyed', 'humans', 'fighting', 'back', 'lethally-', 'easily', 'could', 'postmodern', 'mechanical', 'kin', 'Justine', 'perhaps', '.The', 'books', 'was', 'so', 'slowly', 'reading', 'were', 'Pinochio', 'Frankenstein', 'always', 'just', 'Rockbiter', 'monologue', 'Never', 'Ending', 'Story', 'look', 'big', 'strong', 'hands', '.This', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'opinion', 'Spielberg', 'execrable', 'A.I.', 'only', 'Stevie', 'over-reached', 'again', 'crite', 'film', 'trying', 'make', ""'serious"", 'film', ""'serious"", 'issues', 'then', 'tacked', 'completely', 'odious', 'ending.This', 'film', 'such', 'pretensions-', 'mostly', 'fun', 'more', 'most', 'serious', 'cinema', 'struggling', 'same', 'themes', 'technology', 'identity']",N/A

663463,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00005LK95,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Everyone's favorite plucky robotic unit is back in the 1988 sequel to the surprise hit ""Short Circuit."" I have not seen the original ""Short Circuit 2"" on DVD, so I don't know how much of a step up this Blu-ray presentation is (although based on similar movies of that period, I'd guess that it was significant), but this new edition is clear, precise, and sounds great (1080p, hi-def, Uncompressed PCM Stereo). Those looking for extra supplemental features, however, will not find them on this reissue--so whether or not an upgrade is worth the investment will largely be determined by how much you enjoy the film. And from the plethora of glowing Amazon reviews, this certainly would appear to be a crowd pleaser.To add my two cents, I am going to be a little more reserved in my ranking simply to address the notion of new viewers discovering the film for the first time. This movie, while not without undeniable charm, has a nostalgic ""so silly, it's funny"" appeal. Capitalizing on this nostalgia factor, this is a quintessential family friendly find from the Reagan era. I suspect that many who embrace the film wholeheartedly are products of that film period who saw and fell in love with it years ago. To note--I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. And looking back is always goofy fun. To say, however, that this is a production worthy of the highest rating may set up some expectations with new viewers that this film simply has no chance of meeting. This is a movie that benefits from being discovered with no preconceived notions--and then the viewer must accept whether or not to be caught up in the madcap silliness that follows.I was no huge fan of the original film, and actually thinks its sequel has a more universal appeal. Johnny 5's comparison of himself to both Frankenstein and Pinocchio still strikes a memorable chord for anyone who has felt like an outsider. In this film, Fisher Stevens (in full Indian shtick) returns as 5's creator--now hocking toy replicas of his finest work on the mean streets of New York City. Through happenstance, he meets the world's least effective business woman (the lovely Cynthia Gibb) as a toy buyer making an only-in-the-movies deal to buy thousands of his product. Joining forces with con man Michael McKean, the two encounter many problems trying to fulfill the order. Johnny 5 to the rescue! But before you can say happily ever after, there is much comic mayhem and moments of sincere pathos as the group also thwart an unscrupulous band of thieves.As a feel good film, you pretty much know where you're going the entire time. But amidst the sublime silliness (and there's lots of it), the film has a sweet center and a message of acceptance. I like ""Short Circuit 2"" and I hope I've made that evident--but objectively, it is what it is. Anyone who approaches the film with the expectation that it will be the best thing ever has the potential to be disappointed. You need to enter this film with an open mind and an open heart to enjoy its charms. But it's silly--there's really no other way to describe it adequately. But silly good.

And why, apart from Johnny 5, was Fisher Stevens the only original character brought back?Those were only minor quibbles for a great movie. And the god awful cover art, which the more I look at, the more I hate. But then they could have done worse. It could have been a white background with the two main characters photoshopped in.I really enjoyed the first Short Circuit movie. The second? Even better. With more fun from Johnny, including even more interaction with Ben (Fisher Stevens), and more fun-ness, including making the toy Johnny 5's dance, and more, Short Circuit betters the first.I was kinda disappointed that Stephany didn't reappear for the second movie, she was a bit of a miss, and was only mentioned a couple of times, apart from a voice recording - but at least she wasn't completely forgotten about.What's good about reading other reviewer's ... reviews is that the amount of people is saw this when they were young. I always seem to get introduced to these movies a lot later in life - for example I'm a nearly mid-twenty something and seeing this for the first time. What would it have been like to see it as a child? That, I can only dream about.Short Circuit 2 pretty much follows on from the first, with Ben now in the big city, trying to sell his toy Johnny's on the street, next to a fake Rolex selling vendor. A toy buyer, Sandy, stumbles across a toy Johnny after it 'escapes' and brings it back. Talk of money is banded about, and next thing Ben knows, he needs to make 1000, in 31 days. With the fake Rolex selling vendor, Fred (Michael McKean) as his partner. But bad guys want to break into a bank to steal some priceless jewels, but how are they going to do it? The rest is predictable, but fun.Jack Weston appears as one of the bad guys, who befriends Johnny, in order to get him on his side, finding out he is incredibly naive. For any eighties rom-com fan will recognise him from Dirty Dancing, as Max Kellerman. (For anyone who hasn't seen this or Dirty Dancing, boy do you need some education!) Short Circuit 2 actually appears to have been Jack Weston's last movie before he died from lymphoma in 1996.I'm disappointed there was never another Short Circuit movie. And another one. And another one. And another one. It could have been a great franchise. But what's good is normally best left to a minimum, before it loses its glow. Short Circuit didn't pander to the major franchising deals, the endless mindless sequels, and instead left the world a different place with just the two films.Now where do I buy a little Johnny 5?",4,There needs to be more Johnny 5 in the world,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,2660,"['What', 'do', 'now', 'more', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'movies', 'watch', 'Why', 'was', 'there', 'never', 'third', 'why', 'apart', 'Johnny', '5', 'was', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'only', 'original', 'character', 'brought', 'back', 'were', 'only', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'great', 'movie', 'god', 'awful', 'cover', 'art', 'more', 'look', 'more', 'hate', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'worse', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'white', 'background', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'photoshopped', 'in.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'movie', 'second', 'Even', 'better', 'more', 'fun', 'Johnny', 'including', 'even', 'more', 'interaction', 'Ben', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'more', 'fun-ness', 'including', 'making', 'toy', 'Johnny', '5', 'dance', 'more', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'first.I', 'was', 'kinda', 'disappointed', 'Stephany', 'did', ""n't"", 'reappear', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'miss', 'was', 'only', 'mentioned', 'couple', 'times', 'apart', 'voice', 'recording', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'forgotten', 'about.What', 'good', 'reading', 'other', 'reviewer', 'amount', 'people', 'saw', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'always', 'seem', 'get', 'introduced', 'movies', 'lot', 'later', 'life', 'example', ""'m"", 'nearly', 'mid-twenty', 'something', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'child', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'about.Short', 'Circuit', '2', 'pretty', 'much', 'first', 'Ben', 'now', 'big', 'city', 'trying', 'sell', 'toy', 'Johnny', 'street', 'next', 'fake', 'Rolex', 'selling', 'vendor', 'toy', 'buyer', 'Sandy', 'toy', 'Johnny', 'back', 'Talk', 'money', 'banded', 'next', 'thing', 'Ben', 'make', '1000', '31', 'days', 'fake', 'Rolex', 'selling', 'vendor', 'Fred', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'partner', 'bad', 'guys', 'want', 'break', 'bank', 'steal', 'priceless', 'jewels', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'rest', 'predictable', 'fun.Jack', 'Weston', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'Johnny', 'order', 'get', 'side', 'finding', 'out', 'incredibly', 'naive', 'eighties', 'rom-com', 'fan', 'will', 'recognise', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'Max', 'Kellerman', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'boy', 'do', 'need', 'education', 'Short', 'Circuit', '2', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'Jack', 'Weston', 'last', 'movie', 'died', 'lymphoma', '1996.I', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'was', 'never', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'movie', 'one', 'one', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'franchise', 'what', 'good', 'normally', 'best', 'left', 'minimum', 'glow', 'Short', 'Circuit', 'did', ""n't"", 'pander', 'major', 'franchising', 'deals', 'endless', 'mindless', 'sequels', 'instead', 'left', 'world', 'different', 'place', 'just', 'two', 'films.Now', 'where', 'do', 'buy', 'little', 'Johnny', '5']",N/A

The idea of a naive ... being ... being tricked into committing a crime was old 70 years ago. ""Short Circuit 2"" is unable to find any novel twist on this. It grinds through its shopworn plot as mechanically as the first film.And it does the unforgivable by breaking its own rules. Johnny's backup power drops low enough to permanently erase his memory -- but Ben uses a defibrilator (!!!) to restore him! (In real life (???), if memory is deleted, it's deleted. And a defibrilator jolt would blow out most of the robot's circuitry.)It doesn't help that (except for Ben) the casting is terrible and the overall tone childish. Like the original, this is a kiddie film -- this time, with a bit of vulgar language.It isn't even enjoyable as entertaining fluff.
