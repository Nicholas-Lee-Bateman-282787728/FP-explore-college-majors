779123,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B0000DJYNI,Alexiel,"[14, 21]","""Morvern Callar"" was a film destined to cause some trouble, for a number of reasons. Of them:#1- A movie adaptation that plays loose and fast and false with the book is often going to cause trouble.#2- Whereas many high-minded films and their critics have decided subtlety is a wonderful thing, this movie has decided ""If some subtlety is good, more subtlety must be doubly as good!""#3- People who watch the movie are caught between their frustration with the film'd deliberate inaccessibility and their fear of appearing ignorant when rendering judgement. Thus, you have opinions that hang around on the poles of the extremes, with very little in the middle.#4- This is not really a dog on the movie itself, but you do have to wonder about the kind of people who write reviews and get on message boards that sneer ""If you don't like this movie, go watch The Fast and The Furious."" As if anyone who does not like this movie is a wifebeater-wearing, greasy cinema Philistine.#5- The idea that this movie is superior because it does not, quote ""spoon-feed you"" all the answers. I would venture that there is a difference between ""spoon-feeding"" answers and being purposefully evasive and disingenuous to the movie audience.#6- Samantha Morton is in this movie. That's cause for a lot of trouble, for you see Samantha Morton is a talented actor (I just learned two months ago we're not supposed to use the word actress anymore) who has amassed a cadre of ""devoted"" (re: rabid) fans who believe that anything she touches turns to gold. Morton has definitively proved her acting chops in movies like ""Jesus's Son,"" ""Sweet And Lowdown,"" and ""Code 46"" but went really awry in the saccharine ""In America"" and the sputtering ""Minority Report."" Morton is a good actor, she's even a good actor for what she's given in this movie.Unfortunately, that's not enough. This movie gives her too little, or perhaps too much, to work with. There is too much subtlety to this whole movie. Blank pages for the audience to ascribe what they think to them. You can either decide that look means she's torn up inside or not. You're given so little to work with, you can't say either way. Anyone who claims to have the definitive keys to this movie I would be suspicious of as a fraud out to elevate their standing.This movie doesn't give you a key, or a lock, and nowadays that's supposed to be something to be proud of. It's not. You can make a movie in this fashion, but it needs... for lack of a better word, ""meat"" to it. People go and walk and do things and mess around and party but they don't truly seem to interact with each other or their environment. Emotions that I think were meant to seem complex and multidimensional seem to be totally ignored. A feeling of numbness and even inability for release would be nice, but the audience is not even given that. Halfway through the film we begin to suspect that we're being strung along, and the ending confirms that suspicion.Stranger still, this movie gives off a very anachronistic feel to it, the film quality and setting looks like it was made in 1988 or some time.In short, I don't care for this movie. Morton did a good job with what she had to work with, but in the end this film just did not do enough, confront enough, or accomplish enough. The way this movie has been structured, I believe the reviews on here tell more about the reviewer than the movie. This movie is blank pages. Stare at them, try and figure them out. Make of them what you wish. Just don't attempt to pass any of it off as gospel truth.",2,Blank pages.,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,3549,"['Morvern', 'Callar', 'was', 'film', 'destined', 'cause', 'trouble', 'number', 'reasons', '1-', 'A', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'loose', 'fast', 'false', 'book', 'often', 'going', 'cause', 'trouble.', '2-', 'Whereas', 'many', 'high-minded', 'films', 'critics', 'have', 'decided', 'subtlety', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'movie', 'decided', 'subtlety', 'good', 'more', 'subtlety', 'must', 'be', 'doubly', 'good', '3-', 'People', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'are', 'caught', 'frustration', 'film', ""'d"", 'deliberate', 'inaccessibility', 'fear', 'appearing', 'ignorant', 'when', 'rendering', 'judgement', 'Thus', 'have', 'opinions', 'hang', 'poles', 'extremes', 'very', 'little', 'middle.', '4-', 'not', 'really', 'dog', 'movie', 'do', 'have', 'wonder', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'write', 'reviews', 'get', 'message', 'boards', 'sneer', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'go', 'watch', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'wifebeater-wearing', 'greasy', 'cinema', 'Philistine.', '5-', 'idea', 'movie', 'superior', 'not', 'quote', 'spoon-feed', 'answers', 'would', 'venture', 'difference', 'spoon-feeding', 'answers', 'being', 'purposefully', 'evasive', 'disingenuous', 'movie', 'audience.', '6-', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'movie', 'cause', 'lot', 'trouble', 'see', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'talented', 'actor', 'just', 'learned', 'two', 'months', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'use', 'word', 'actress', 'anymore', 'who', 'amassed', 'cadre', 'devoted', 're', 'rabid', 'fans', 'who', 'believe', 'anything', 'turns', 'gold', 'Morton', 'definitively', 'proved', 'acting', 'chops', 'movies', 'Jesus', 'Son', 'Sweet', 'Lowdown', 'Code', '46', 'went', 'really', 'awry', 'saccharine', 'America', 'sputtering', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Morton', 'good', 'actor', 'even', 'good', 'actor', 'what', 'given', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'not', 'enough', 'movie', 'too', 'little', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'too', 'much', 'subtlety', 'whole', 'movie', 'Blank', 'pages', 'audience', 'ascribe', 'what', 'think', 'can', 'either', 'decide', 'look', 'torn', 'up', 'inside', 'not', ""'re"", 'given', 'so', 'little', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'way', 'Anyone', 'who', 'have', 'definitive', 'keys', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'suspicious', 'fraud', 'elevate', 'standing.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'give', 'key', 'lock', 'supposed', 'be', 'something', 'be', 'proud', 'not', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'fashion', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'meat', 'People', 'go', 'walk', 'do', 'things', 'mess', 'around', 'party', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'seem', 'interact', 'other', 'environment', 'Emotions', 'think', 'were', 'meant', 'seem', 'complex', 'multidimensional', 'seem', 'be', 'totally', 'ignored', 'feeling', 'numbness', 'even', 'inability', 'release', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'audience', 'not', 'even', 'given', 'Halfway', 'film', 'begin', 'suspect', ""'re"", 'being', 'strung', 'ending', 'confirms', 'suspicion.Stranger', 'still', 'movie', 'off', 'very', 'anachronistic', 'feel', 'film', 'quality', 'setting', 'looks', 'was', 'made', '1988', 'time.In', 'short', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'Morton', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'enough', 'confront', 'enough', 'accomplish', 'enough', 'way', 'movie', 'been', 'structured', 'believe', 'reviews', 'here', 'tell', 'more', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'movie', 'blank', 'pages', 'Stare', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'Make', 'what', 'wish', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'pass', 'off', 'gospel', 'truth']",Morvern Callar

Translation is one of the problems, the characters accents are so thick at times that it's very difficult to follow what they're saying.  I was hoping for a subtitle option in the extras menu.  Morvern Callar deals with how Morvern copes or rather doesn't cope with the suicide of her boyfriend by working during the day and drinking, drugging and partying during the night while her boyfriend's corpse decomposes on her kitchen floor.It's easy to get into a completely character driven, nearly plotless novel dealing with a character coping with grief but I found after the first 40 minutes of watching the film, it didn't capture my attention. The party scenes are expertly filmed, the director does a incredible job of capturing Morvern's sense of despair and the soundtrack is excellent. However, the overall feel of the novel was lost.  Even the end is different.  Morvern returns to Spain to party some more in the film but in the book, Morvern disappears to a tiny fishing village on the coast of Scotland after discovering she's pregnant with what may or may not be her boyfriend's baby. That ending certianly does give the story a different feel.Read the novel, skip the film.

You can tell what kind of film it is right off the bat. Don't their DVD players have OFF switches?Here's who should watch it:(1) people who appreciate great acting--Samantha Morton is amazing;(2) people who realize that the choices available to middle class, college educated Americans are not the choices available to lower working class Scots living in a stratified society where your accent is your destiny. Think ""My Fair Lady"" except Eliza Doolittle never met Professor 'iggins and had to make her way on her own, only set in the 1990s, only the UK hasn't changed that much in this regard;(3) people who don't require Hollywood production values, special effects sequences, and artificially flavored happy endings;(4) people who are prepared to admire Morvern for using everything at her disposal to cope with the rotten hand life dealt her.I'd be honored to know someone like Morvern, inarticulate working-class bloke that she is. Her educated artistic boyfriend saw something in her that isn't obvious at the beginning--except that she's reasonably attractive. What's inside her is slowly revealed through the course of the movie, which will only seem aimless to those who want to be lead by the hand, like Hollywood is only too happy to do.My spouse thoroughly disapproved of this movie and Morvern's life choices, and I haven't been able to change her mind. So I understand how appalled some will be at this movie, even some who have been exposed to hundreds of interesting films from all over the world. But though Morvern's no saint and doesn't pretend to be, I approve of her actions in the context in which they occur.My own father only had a 7th grade education, so perhaps I'm in a better position to understand the working poor. There's so much we take for granted.For me the high point of the film is a scene in which she's negotiating with two publisher's representatives. She's waaay over her head and bloody well knows it, but she's also plucky and resourceful, and watching her navigate these waters, continually at the brink of disaster, is both wonderful to watch and a wonder of magnificent, mostly wordless acting on Samantha Morton's part. This is a scene I'd show to acting classes.I'd also use this if I were trying to teach people what ""middle class"" and ""lower class"" mean existentially.Lastly, I know of no other film like this. It doesn't remind me of anything else except perhaps Kurosawa's version of ""The lower depths."" But that's a stretch.See ""Morvern Callar"" if you're honestly prepared to visit the life of someone who absolutely is not from your world.",4,Morvern is a hero most Americans won't appreciate--no spoilers review,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,2739,"['do', ""n't"", 'get', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Morvern', 'Callar', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'watched', 'can', 'tell', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'right', 'bat', 'Do', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'players', 'have', 'OFF', 'switches', 'Here', 'who', 'should', 'watch', '1', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'great', 'acting', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'amazing', '2', 'people', 'who', 'realize', 'choices', 'available', 'middle', 'class', 'college', 'educated', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'choices', 'available', 'lower', 'working', 'class', 'Scots', 'living', 'stratified', 'society', 'where', 'accent', 'destiny', 'Think', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Eliza', 'Doolittle', 'never', 'met', 'Professor', ""'iggins"", 'had', 'make', 'way', 'own', 'only', 'set', '1990s', 'only', 'UK', ""n't"", 'changed', 'that', 'much', 'regard', '3', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'require', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'values', 'special', 'effects', 'sequences', 'artificially', 'flavored', 'happy', 'endings', '4', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'prepared', 'admire', 'Morvern', 'using', 'everything', 'disposal', 'cope', 'rotten', 'hand', 'life', 'dealt', 'her.I', ""'d"", 'be', 'honored', 'know', 'someone', 'Morvern', 'inarticulate', 'working-class', 'bloke', 'educated', 'artistic', 'boyfriend', 'saw', 'something', ""n't"", 'obvious', 'beginning', 'reasonably', 'attractive', 'What', 'inside', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'course', 'movie', 'will', 'only', 'seem', 'aimless', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'lead', 'hand', 'Hollywood', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'do.My', 'spouse', 'thoroughly', 'disapproved', 'movie', 'Morvern', 'life', 'choices', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'change', 'mind', 'understand', 'how', 'appalled', 'will', 'be', 'movie', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'hundreds', 'interesting', 'films', 'world', 'Morvern', 'saint', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'approve', 'actions', 'context', 'occur.My', 'own', 'father', 'only', 'had', '7th', 'grade', 'education', 'perhaps', ""'m"", 'better', 'position', 'understand', 'working', 'poor', 'so', 'much', 'take', 'granted.For', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'scene', 'negotiating', 'two', 'publisher', 'representatives', 'waaay', 'head', 'bloody', 'well', 'also', 'plucky', 'resourceful', 'watching', 'navigate', 'waters', 'continually', 'brink', 'disaster', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'wonder', 'magnificent', 'mostly', 'wordless', 'acting', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'part', 'scene', ""'d"", 'show', 'acting', 'classes.I', ""'d"", 'also', 'use', 'were', 'trying', 'teach', 'people', 'what', 'middle', 'class', 'lower', 'class', 'mean', 'existentially.Lastly', 'know', 'other', 'film', ""n't"", 'remind', 'anything', 'else', 'perhaps', 'Kurosawa', 'version', 'lower', 'depths', 'stretch.See', 'Morvern', 'Callar', ""'re"", 'honestly', 'prepared', 'visit', 'life', 'someone', 'who', 'absolutely', 'not', 'world']",Morvern Callar

Because of the technique of direction and cinematography and because the Scottish brogues used by the cast are all thick and dark and a bit plodding, the first fifteen minutes of the film may lose it audience.  But struggle a while and the rewards are plentiful.The superb Samantha Morton plays the title role, a poor, grocery store worker in dankest Scotland whose boyfriend has committed suicide as the film opens.  It is Christmas and Morvern has no idea of how to cope until she notices his computer screen with the statement READ ME.  Apparently her dead boyfriend had just completed his first novel, instructing Morvern to send it to the publisher.  In a trance Morvern changes the name of the author to her own name, prints out the novel and sends it off to the London publisher. While she gets rid of the body she takes some cash and a credit card and discovers she has enough money to take a holiday with her friend Lana.  After some reactive partying to stem her disillusionment, she convinces Lana to take a holiday to Spain with her. We move from dark (yet luminously atmospheric) Scotland to the bright madness of Spain.  There the two friends separate as Lana longs to go back home, finding the party over.  Morvern calls the publisher who comes to meet her in Spain because they have elected to publish &quot;her&quot; book for a large sum.  Morvern returns to her home a changed person, a woman who has taken risks and continues (and will continue) to explore life one day at a time.As stated before, much of the story in dialogue is lost because it is simply un-understandable.  Yet Samantha Morton really does not need words to create a character: her face, body, and inner light illuminate the screen. The film is not an easy one, but its rewards are phenomenal.

This is pretty much forgot about the rest of the movie because Morvern gets up and goes to a party with her friend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott). Morvern and Lanna begin staying together and eventually go on a trip together (Morvern doesn't tell anyone her boyfriend is dead, but merely...Gone). Our title character is pretty mysterious and we never quite know what she's going to do next. She leaves her dead boyfriend in the apartment and doesn't tell anyone. She eventually dismembers him and buries him in a field. For horror film fans, this dismemberment is not shown. She's very much like the title character in the movie ""May"". Except in that film, May is simply deranged from the beginning. In this film, Morvern is completely normal but seems to show no emotion for anything whatsoever. Any synopsis I, or anyone else, gives will not be able to appropriately sum up the movie. It's so different and weird. The soundtrack works perfect though for what it's doing. The reason I compared it to the two films above was both of those movies had a lack of dialogue. ""The Loss of Sexual Innocence"" gave us some haunting images with a background of music; ""The Brown Bunny"" was just quiet. I'm not sure how to recommend this movie (or who I should recommend it to) but it's a quiet and low-key movie that stays with you. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not something you'll forget.GRADE: A-",5,Odd,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2033,"['Morvern', 'Callar', 'independent-English', 'film', 'vein', 'films', 'Loss', 'Sexual', 'Innocence', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'So', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'former', 'Stay', 'away', 'movie', 'Two-Time', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'Best', 'Actress', ""'Sweet"", 'Lowdown', ""'In"", 'America', 'title', 'character', 'Morvern', 'Callar', 'One', 'morning', 'Morvern', 'up', 'Christmas', 'no', 'less', 'boyfriend', 'committed', 'suicide', 'computer', 'left', 'message', 'words', 'Love', 'Be', 'Brave', 'Reading', 'Morvern', 'novel', 'written', 'be', 'sent', 'publisher', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgot', 'rest', 'movie', 'Morvern', 'up', 'party', 'friend', 'Lanna', 'Kathleen', 'McDermott', 'Morvern', 'Lanna', 'begin', 'staying', 'together', 'eventually', 'go', 'trip', 'together', 'Morvern', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'boyfriend', 'dead', 'merely', 'Gone', 'title', 'character', 'pretty', 'mysterious', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'dead', 'boyfriend', 'apartment', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'eventually', 'buries', 'field', 'horror', 'film', 'fans', 'dismemberment', 'not', 'shown', 'very', 'much', 'title', 'character', 'movie', 'May', 'film', 'May', 'simply', 'deranged', 'beginning', 'film', 'Morvern', 'completely', 'normal', 'show', 'emotion', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'Any', 'synopsis', 'anyone', 'else', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'appropriately', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'so', 'different', 'weird', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'what', 'doing', 'reason', 'compared', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'movies', 'had', 'lack', 'dialogue', 'Loss', 'Sexual', 'Innocence', 'gave', 'haunting', 'images', 'background', 'music', 'Brown', 'Bunny', 'was', 'just', 'quiet', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'should', 'recommend', 'quiet', 'low-key', 'movie', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'something', ""'ll"", 'forget.GRADE', 'A-']",Morvern Callar

I agree with the first statement, but i might say instead, &quot;Morvern's not a-moral, she's not real.&quot;  The point of this film is not to be realistic.  It's not &quot;Schindler's List&quot;.  It's a metaphore, an expression of deep, emotional hurt.Morvern doesn't call the police because she's in denial.  She knows she wouldn't be able to answer questions, see his body removed, hear her family and friends comfort her.  She covers it up not because she's got something to loose, or gain as the case may be.  She could easily have (if all she wanted was the money) have called the cops and sold the novel as her own anyway, so you need to concentrate on why she chose to cover up a death she had no part of.  SHE COULDN'T TAKE IT.  That's why she had to leave with her friend Lana.  After ending up in a clubbers paradise, she decides that she's still not in a good place for her, so her journey continues.I could see why a realist wouldn't like this movie.

From the outset Morvern Callar (Samantha Morton) is passive and emotionally frozen. Waking up Christmas morning, she discovers her boyfriend dead beside her, a suicide, but she ignores the body, puts on her makeup and goes out to a party, where she drinks, dances, goes to bed with two people, participates in nude snowball-throwing, and tells her friend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott) that her boyfriend has ""gone to another country.""He has left behind Christmas presents, recorded music, a message of love, and a just-completed novel, asking her to send it to a publisher. Changing his name to her own on the manuscript, she sends it off. She then disposes of the body, cleans the apartment, and invites her girlfriend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott) over to spend the night. Her boyfriend's ""funeral money"" buys tickets to Spain for a vacation with Lanna, a fellow employee in the meat room of a local supermarket. The surprising, immediate sale of his manuscript gives her additional money to travel wherever she wants in Spain, seeking action at the beach, parties with other young people, and sensual pleasure.With some scenes filmed with a handheld camera, the film has the tone of a home movie, giving it remarkable verisimilitude. The action and the characters feel real--human--and the mumbling voices and sometimes incomprehensible accents keep the film low-key and even more realistic. The cinematography (Alwin Kuchler) is brilliant, with dramatic scenes showing stark light and dark contrasts--backlit empty halls, bleak snowfalls, staircases appearing to go nowhere, flashing lights freeze-framing action, and vast, empty expanses contrasting with frantic activity--the cinematography emphasizing the emptiness of the characters' lives and their bleak prospects. The loud, sometimes jazzy score further emphasizes their alienation.Morton makes a compelling, emotionally dissociated Movern Callar, conveying her reckless search for excitement and her slowly developing need for peace. McDermott as Lanna is even more frenetic and uninhibited, and there is never a sense that either of these actresses is acting. The director's touch is light, giving the actors leeway to explore their roles, which they do boldly but with a touching poignancy. R-rated for good reason, the film succeeds in capturing a seldom-featured segment of youthful society, presenting the constant search for pleasure as a way to escape the pain.

It opens with a dead body in an apartment and that, honestly, is the MOST EXCITING PART OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  To save you time, here is a complete and total spoiler of this film: vapid semi-attractive mannequin's boyfriend commits suicide, leaving her money for funeral, a novel he wrote, and a mixtape.  She publishes his novel as her own, disposes of the corpse, uses money to go to Ibiza with her equally horrible best girlfriend, and sporadically fast-forwards through the lovingly-crafted mixtape the whole while.That's it!  No resolution, no moral, no point whatsoever.  It's like MTV Spring Break with Scottish people.  In fact the only redeeming part of the film is the soundtrack, which is used so haphazardly and with such severe editing that you may as well be listening to a Negativland album.Artsy-fartsy types will laud the film for its cinematography.  I'm sorry, but if I want long, ponderous shots of random nonsense, I'll watch Baraka, which at least TRIES to have some sort of depth and sincerity; Morvern Callar has neither of these attributes, and in fact seems to regard them with abject scorn and mockery.I gave up an hour into this movie, because I honestly DON'T CARE HOW IT ENDS.

779135,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0000DJYNI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 9]","Morvern Callar (Lynne Ramsay, 2002)Lynne Ramsay first came to the world's attention a few years back with Ratcatcher. She now turns in her second feature film, Morvern Callar. I guess you could call Morvern Callar a slice-of-life film in the same way you could say that of Ratcatcher. The question is, is Morvern Callar's life one you want a slice of? (Ramsay is continuing in that vein in her choice of films; her next project is an adaptation of The Lovely Bones.)Morvern Callar (the gorgeous Samantha Morton, probably best known to American audiences as Agatha the psychic from Minority Report) is a low-income girl in a dead-end job. She wakes up one Christmas morning to find that her boyfriend has committed suicide (and worse yet, done it in the doorway between the living room and the kitchen), leaving her a note, money to cover the funeral expenses, and the text of his novel, with instructions on which publishers to send it to. Her reaction? Going out and partying with her best friend Lanna (Kathleen McDermott, in her first big-screen appearance). No reason to let a suicide dampen your plans...The main feeling I got from Morvern Callar (adapted from Alan Warner's novel of the same name) was that much was missing from it. This would not be unusual with films of novels, but I haven't yet read the book as a comparison. (What does it say about a film when you suspect pieces of it are missing before you even read the book?) The film ends up with an impressionist, surreal feel that keeps the viewer's attention, but at the same time leads to asking the question ""what's the backstory here?"" a few times too many. There are scenes where Morvern and Lanna's actions aren't understandable in the least, characters who wander in and out for what seems no reason (Lanna's grandmother being the first you'll encounter, but not the last), things like that.Otherwise, though, it's a very pretty film. Samantha Morton is exceptionally easy on the eyes, as are a number of cinematographer Alwin Kuchler's (you saw his work in One Day in September, didn't you?) lovely panoramic scenes of the moors and the Spanish countryside. Intercut with them are the frequent club scenes, which are jarring but meant to be. Visually, the film's a treat; I just wish there has been more substance to it. ** ",3,Where's the beef?,1073347200,"01 6, 2004",2004,2300,"['Morvern', 'Callar', 'Lynne', 'Ramsay', '2002', 'Lynne', 'Ramsay', 'first', 'came', 'world', 'attention', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Ratcatcher', 'now', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'Morvern', 'Callar', 'guess', 'could', 'call', 'Morvern', 'Callar', 'slice-of-life', 'film', 'same', 'way', 'could', 'say', 'Ratcatcher', 'question', 'Morvern', 'Callar', 'life', 'one', 'want', 'slice', 'Ramsay', 'continuing', 'vein', 'choice', 'films', 'next', 'project', 'adaptation', 'Lovely', 'Bones', 'Morvern', 'Callar', 'gorgeous', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'American', 'audiences', 'Agatha', 'psychic', 'Minority', 'Report', 'low-income', 'girl', 'dead-end', 'job', 'wakes', 'up', 'one', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'find', 'boyfriend', 'committed', 'suicide', 'worse', 'yet', 'done', 'doorway', 'living', 'room', 'kitchen', 'leaving', 'note', 'money', 'cover', 'funeral', 'expenses', 'text', 'novel', 'instructions', 'publishers', 'send', 'reaction', 'Going', 'partying', 'best', 'friend', 'Lanna', 'Kathleen', 'McDermott', 'first', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'reason', 'let', 'suicide', 'dampen', 'plans', 'main', 'feeling', 'got', 'Morvern', 'Callar', 'adapted', 'Alan', 'Warner', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'much', 'was', 'missing', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'unusual', 'films', 'novels', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'read', 'book', 'comparison', 'What', 'say', 'film', 'when', 'suspect', 'pieces', 'are', 'missing', 'even', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'up', 'impressionist', 'surreal', 'feel', 'viewer', 'attention', 'same', 'time', 'asking', 'question', 'what', 'backstory', 'here', 'few', 'times', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Morvern', 'Lanna', 'actions', 'are', ""n't"", 'understandable', 'least', 'characters', 'who', 'wander', 'what', 'reason', 'Lanna', 'grandmother', 'being', 'first', ""'ll"", 'encounter', 'not', 'last', 'things', 'that.Otherwise', 'though', 'very', 'pretty', 'film', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'exceptionally', 'easy', 'eyes', 'are', 'number', 'cinematographer', 'Alwin', 'Kuchler', 'saw', 'work', 'One', 'Day', 'September', 'did', ""n't"", 'lovely', 'panoramic', 'scenes', 'moors', 'Spanish', 'countryside', 'Intercut', 'are', 'frequent', 'club', 'scenes', 'are', 'jarring', 'meant', 'be', 'Visually', 'film', 'treat', 'just', 'wish', 'there', 'been', 'more', 'substance', '**']",Morvern Callar

The movie could go in a multitude of directions after this, but this character sucks the life out of the movie. I had trouble staying awake and keeping my sanity during viewing it. And funnily enough, this seemed exactly like the kind of movie I would usually go for--quirky, independent, different.

It's a multiple prize winner:nominated for 14 awards, it took nine.  It's based on a novel by Alan Warner, and might be considered another entry in the tartan noir school of filmmaking: just a bit bloodthirsty; more than a little graphic in its portrayal of young people going about their daily rounds of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.The highly talented Samantha Morton stars as Morvern Callar, a young woman without a future, working as a grocery store clerk in Oban, a picturesque town, full of retirees, on Scotland's west coast.  It's a town where futures are not made.  She awakes one morning to find her boyfriend has committed suicide.  Her behavior then is not what we'd expect; it goes well beyond ordinary denial as we'd conceive it.  She spends the funeral money he'd left her to get herself and her best friend from the store to a vacation in Spain; lots of sex, drugs and rock and roll to be found there.  She also signs her name to the novel the boyfriend had written, and sets about trying to sell it as he'd instructed on his last disk.Director Ramsey, in this movie, follows the maxim ""Show, Don't Tell.""  It's intense, frequently color-saturated, particularly in the Spanish scenes, and moves fast. No spoon feeding of what to think, no backstory, no voiceovers, just a close up,unblinking eye on Morvern and company.

Glaister,"[4, 5]","There's a lot to like about this film.... it has amazing sound design (maybe the best I've come across since _Requiem for a Dream_) and is terrifically visually inventive (color and framing choices are occasionally flamboyant but more often they are just enough askew so you are always seeing things afresh).  Lynne Ramsay is evidently a director to watch, and is cut from the same cloth as Lynch and Aronofsky.  But, and its going to be a big &quot;but&quot; for a lot of people, the story drifts along and is in some sense *about* drift and ennui.  If that doesn't sound like your sort of thing then this movie probably won't be.  But if you are interested in the technical aspects of film-making or enjoy the slightly somnabulent state one sometimes enters at art galleries and museums then _Morvern Callar_ is definitely worth seeing.",3,"Intriguing, polarizing film",1082764800,"04 24, 2004",2004,838,"['lot', 'like', 'film', 'amazing', 'sound', 'design', 'maybe', 'best', ""'ve"", 'come', '_Requiem', 'Dream_', 'terrifically', 'visually', 'inventive', 'color', 'framing', 'choices', 'are', 'occasionally', 'flamboyant', 'more', 'often', 'are', 'just', 'enough', 'askew', 'are', 'always', 'seeing', 'things', 'afresh', 'Lynne', 'Ramsay', 'evidently', 'director', 'watch', 'cut', 'same', 'cloth', 'Lynch', 'Aronofsky', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'quot', 'quot', 'lot', 'people', 'story', 'drifts', 'sense', '*about*', 'drift', 'ennui', ""n't"", 'sound', 'sort', 'thing', 'then', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'are', 'interested', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film-making', 'enjoy', 'slightly', 'somnabulent', 'state', 'one', 'sometimes', 'enters', 'art', 'galleries', 'museums', 'then', '_Morvern', 'Callar_', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",Morvern Callar

The opening of the film has very little dialogue and consists mostly of beautiful and yet disturbing images. The story is about a woman, Morvern Callar, who's boyfriend committs suicide. She works in a grocery store and leads a pretty simple life. The film for the most part is just watching Morvern in her life. This is an example of how a film can be just a succession of beautiful photographs. The music creates a hypnotic and numbing effect than puts the viewer in a sort of trance. This reminded me a little bit of Agnes Varda's &quot;Cleo from 5 to 7&quot; in that it just unobtructively follows a woman's life.

779142,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B0000DJYNI,Wanda B. Red,"[6, 7]","Supermarket clerk Morvern Callar's boyfriend commits suicide, leaving behind several different kinds of gifts. Literally, these include Christmas presents set beneath a tree that pulsates with red and green lights, the alternation of buzz/quiet introducing the reader to the strange dictotomy of noise and silence in this film. The boyfriend also specifically bequeaths Morvern a tape from his music collection that he has orchestrated for her and which forms the lyric background to this haunting film. But in a suicide note that Morvern finds on his computer, he also tells her that he loves her, whatever that means in the context of this grim world, and that a novel on the computer was written ""for her."" She ""takes"" this message and her lover's gifts in more than one sense.The remainder of the film explores the effects of these various gifts. After first abandoning the body for days, partying in a kind of frenzy of denial, she then gathers herself, disposes of it, and forms a plan, which seems more improvisation than calculation. Morvern remains oddly kind and innocent, even as she dismembers the boyfriend and buries him on a bluff.  She then sends off the boyfriend's novel to a publisher under her own name and uses his money to escape to Spain where she goes clubbing with her best friend Lanna, trying to blot out pain and create meaning in her life the only way she knows how. Her incorporation of her boyfriend's life signals her incorporation as well of his pain. Her actions seem less a desertion or desecration of his suicide than an embodiment of it.Brilliantly natural acting, daring cinematography, and a precise director's eye (the award-winning Lynne Ramsay) make this an interesting but disturbing film.
