The quality of the dvd however is only fair (and that's being generous).  It was obviously made from a copy, and the picture and sound quality show it.  Also, as previously mentioned by other reviewers, the box is printed in Asian, which means that I was totally unable to read it.  The film itself it in English, and there are no subtitles however.",3,"Movie is good, dvd quality is not",1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,494,"['movie', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'bit', 'overacted', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'seeing', 'how', 'based', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'novel', 'was', 'made', '1938', 'quality', 'dvd', 'however', 'only', 'fair', 'being', 'generous', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'copy', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'show', 'Also', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'box', 'printed', 'Asian', 'was', 'totally', 'unable', 'read', 'film', 'English', 'are', 'subtitles', 'however']",N/A
