The very catchy title song was written by Disney composers the Sherman Brothers, and sung by the Sons of the Pioneers. The exciting background score was by Disney veteran Oliver Wallace. Tagline for the movie, ""A tale of the old west told in story and song"". The other tagline for movie posters was, ""The Hunter... The Hunted! In one lifetime he was both"". Directed by James Algar and Jack Couffer. Jack was a long-time animal trainer for Disney, and two decades later would help produce ""Never Cry Wolf"". The filming was entirely on location in Sedona, Arizona and the scenery is beautiful. Filmed in Technicolor. Also included in many theaters with the movie was the Disney True-Life adventure short featurette ""Water Birds"", and the Goofy cartoon ""Aquamania"". Screenplay By Dwight Hauser and James Algar, based upon the story by Ernest Thompson-Seton. Released  back when there was such a thing as a ""G"" rating, on November 7, 1962. First VHS release was in 1985. Running time is 67 minutes.  DVD aspect ratio is 1.33:1STORY:  A wolf cub named Lobo is born in the desert Southwest, only to see his parents killed by man. The film follows him as he grows to the leader of his own wolf pack with his own cubs.  He becomes an arch enemy of the local ranchers who can never catch him, since he is the smartest wolf ever known. The ranchers hire a professional hunter to kill Lobo, but he has never run into the likes of this wily wolf before.

There were the True Life Adventures, and then there were those that were actual stories, like ""The Legend of Lobo"", narrated by Rex Allen and the Sons of the Pioneers. Lobo is the tale of a particularly curious and intelligent wolf cub who grows to become the leader of a great pack in the American Southwest. Losing his parents to vengeful cattlemen when he was young, Lobo learned the scent of man well, and he repeatedly uses his wit and skill to outsmart them as his legend grows. Full of those delightful Disney scenes of young animals interacting with each other and grown animals being remarkably clever, ""The Legend of Lobo"" is a pure delight. This live-action, 67 minute film from 1962 is great family entertainment, though it does include Bambi-like themes of a young animal losing his parents. There is no dialogue from the characters, unless you count animal sounds. Instead, the narrator and songs tell the tale. It's what one expects from a Disney animal story of the mid-20th century, and, as such, is a great DVD to own if you love wolves, the Southwest, or classic Disney in general.",5,A Classic Disney Animal Story,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,1227,"['are', 'Disney', 'fan', 'are', 'probably', 'familiar', 'old', 'animal', 'tales', 'often', 'narrated', 'Rex', 'Allen', 'Winston', 'Hibler', 'were', 'True', 'Life', 'Adventures', 'then', 'were', 'were', 'actual', 'stories', 'Legend', 'Lobo', 'narrated', 'Rex', 'Allen', 'Sons', 'Pioneers', 'Lobo', 'tale', 'particularly', 'curious', 'intelligent', 'wolf', 'cub', 'who', 'become', 'leader', 'great', 'pack', 'American', 'Southwest', 'Losing', 'parents', 'vengeful', 'cattlemen', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Lobo', 'learned', 'scent', 'man', 'well', 'repeatedly', 'wit', 'skill', 'outsmart', 'legend', 'grows', 'Full', 'delightful', 'Disney', 'scenes', 'young', 'animals', 'interacting', 'other', 'grown', 'animals', 'being', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'Legend', 'Lobo', 'pure', 'delight', 'live-action', '67', 'minute', 'film', '1962', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'include', 'Bambi-like', 'themes', 'young', 'animal', 'losing', 'parents', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'count', 'animal', 'sounds', 'Instead', 'narrator', 'songs', 'tell', 'tale', 'what', 'one', 'Disney', 'animal', 'story', 'mid-20th', 'century', 'such', 'great', 'DVD', 'own', 'love', 'wolves', 'Southwest', 'classic', 'Disney', 'general']",N/A
80869,A1K4AVQIU704DY,0788812475,"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan""","[3, 3]","However good the cinematography, the storyline, or the narration, it is the song sung by the Sons of the Pioneers I remember best. Of course it has been too long for me to remember the words, but the song was sung in snatches throughout the movie and complemented Rex Allen's narration very nicely. I still have Ernest Thompson Seton's Wild Animals I have Known with stories of a crow, fox, mustang and rabbit among others. The first story is The King of Currumpaw and the basis of The Legend of Lobo. There is only one other movie I can recall showing the life of a wild animal and that was The Glacier Fox. The Legend of Lobo told a more complete story in that it began with the birth of Lobo and followed his puppyhood, maturing into a full grown wolf, selecting a mate, and raising a family. The life of a wolf was filled with danger from the ranchers so it is not all pleasant. But, regardless of how old the movie is, it is still a valuable aid to gaining knowledge of this wild canine.Update on 10/16/2013. I decided to look up Rex ""The Arizona Cowboy"" Allen on line and find he was born in Willcox which is not far from my city of Tucson. When he was contracted by Walt Disney Pictures to narrate some of their documentaries he was given a new nickname, The Voice of the West.  Interesting he actually died in Tucson in 1999, just one year short of the new millennium dubbed Y2K. As for Lobo, he actually lived in the 1890's and was leader of a band of wolves who terrorized ranchers just as he did in the movie along with his mate Blanca. Unlike the movie, after Blanca was captured and killed, and Lobo himself was captured, he himself, bereft of freedom and his mate, died. His pelt can be found in the Ernest Thompson Seton Memorial Library and Museum near Cimarron, NM.",4,The Ups and Downs of Being a Wolf,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,1782,"['However', 'good', 'cinematography', 'storyline', 'narration', 'song', 'sung', 'Sons', 'Pioneers', 'remember', 'best', 'course', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'remember', 'words', 'song', 'was', 'sung', 'snatches', 'movie', 'complemented', 'Rex', 'Allen', 'narration', 'very', 'nicely', 'still', 'have', 'Ernest', 'Thompson', 'Seton', 'Wild', 'Animals', 'have', 'Known', 'stories', 'crow', 'fox', 'mustang', 'rabbit', 'others', 'first', 'story', 'King', 'Currumpaw', 'basis', 'Legend', 'Lobo', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'movie', 'can', 'recall', 'showing', 'life', 'wild', 'animal', 'was', 'Glacier', 'Fox', 'Legend', 'Lobo', 'told', 'more', 'complete', 'story', 'began', 'birth', 'Lobo', 'followed', 'puppyhood', 'maturing', 'full', 'grown', 'wolf', 'selecting', 'mate', 'raising', 'family', 'life', 'wolf', 'was', 'filled', 'danger', 'ranchers', 'not', 'pleasant', 'regardless', 'how', 'old', 'movie', 'still', 'valuable', 'aid', 'gaining', 'knowledge', 'wild', 'canine.Update', '10/16/2013', 'decided', 'look', 'up', 'Rex', 'Arizona', 'Cowboy', 'Allen', 'line', 'find', 'was', 'born', 'Willcox', 'not', 'far', 'city', 'Tucson', 'When', 'was', 'contracted', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'narrate', 'documentaries', 'was', 'given', 'new', 'nickname', 'Voice', 'West', 'Interesting', 'actually', 'died', 'Tucson', '1999', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'short', 'new', 'millennium', 'dubbed', 'Y2K', 'Lobo', 'actually', 'lived', '1890', 'was', 'leader', 'band', 'wolves', 'who', 'terrorized', 'ranchers', 'just', 'did', 'movie', 'mate', 'Blanca', 'movie', 'Blanca', 'was', 'captured', 'killed', 'Lobo', 'was', 'captured', 'bereft', 'freedom', 'mate', 'died', 'pelt', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Ernest', 'Thompson', 'Seton', 'Memorial', 'Library', 'Museum', 'Cimarron', 'NM']",N/A

Oldfield,"[0, 0]","&#34;The Legend of Lobo&#34; is a charming, engaging and very watchable Disney live action film from 1962 which I saw as a child (in a double bill with Snow White).  It's a bit like a Disney True Life Adventure film with sufficient story thread to keep us engaged, and fortunately not particularly sugary.  It tells the story of Lobo, an adventurous wolf cub who grows up to become an almost legendary creature, leader of the wolf pack and reluctantly admired  by the few humans we see for his intelligence and daring.  After the usual cutesy growing-up sequences the first real drama is when Lobo's mother is killed by hunters, this is really moving and had me crying as an 8-year-old.  We don't see a lot of the hunters which makes them feel like more of a threat (not unlike 'man' in Bambi).  There's more drama and an exciting climax before Lobo somehow overcomes impossible odds and confirms his status as 'top dog'.  It's a lovely gem of a film that I don't think was widely available for many years. Probably more appealing to adult Disney fans, may not be sophisticated enough for today's young children.

The wildlife photography was amazing and just as fresh today as it was nearly 5 decades ago. I think the only caution I would make to a family setting down to watch this is that there is animal cruelty in the form of spring loaded traps used to catch the father of Lobo.
