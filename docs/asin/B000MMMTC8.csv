1047546,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000MMMTC8,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 1]","Don't get me wrong from the title of this review.  I had absolutely no problem following along with the routines, but I have been doing cardio dance DVDs for a long time.  The beginner will find this video extremely irritating unless they have the ability to learn dance quickly.  This DVD is 60 minutes long, and it is broken into 7 sections.Warm-Up-Taught by all three (Ashley, Kym, Maksim) it is very flowing movements taught rather slowly and done enough times that anyone could follow.  Not very invigorating, however, doesn't really set the tone for the workout.Paso Doble-This could have been made a fabulous toning or cardio workout, but it was terribly boring.  Maks leads, and the first 6-7 minutes are full of the same 4 steps.  Finally, he adds some more fun type steps, but he still seems rather bored with teaching.  Moves included are lunges, flamenco moves, and more.Cha-Cha-Led by Ashly, this isn't low cardio, but it isn't medium either.  It's somewhere in between.  Ashly is a perfectly bubbly teacher, and she teaches you basic cha-cha steps (with just a little explanation) for about 6-7 minutes then puts them all together for a combo.  Moves included are New Yorkers, Spot Turns, and more.Samba-Kym instructs this segment, and she does a pretty good job.  She is very motivating, and this style is fun, too.  The samba finally get's your heart rate going as it has a little bit of fast footwork and a few hops.  Kym will go slow enough for you to get it but fast enough for the heart to work.  Moves included are whisks, botofogos, and more.Jive-This routine is VERY cardio, and it is led by all three teachers.  It's fun because they interact, and the jive is really fun, too.  It has a lot of hopping and kicking so get ready for an intense workout.  Moves include triple steps, Lindy Hop steps, and more.Challenge-The three teachers try to mess the other two up.  The average exerciser won't get anything out of this, but after you've done the DVD about 10 times (if you can stand to do it that many times) try it again and find that you are better!Cool-Down-Full of relaxing moves and stretches, this is a great cool-down that really works and put you into a relaxed mode.Overall, I recommend to big fans, otherwise get the two that came out in 2009 ""Dance Off the Pounds"" or ""Dance Body Tone.""  They are better, but this one does have it's good points.  I do have to say, though, this is more a introduction to ballroom/Latin dance than it is a workout.",3,Pretty basic steps taught with no explanation.,1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,2481,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'title', 'review', 'had', 'absolutely', 'problem', 'following', 'along', 'routines', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'cardio', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'long', 'time', 'beginner', 'will', 'find', 'video', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'have', 'ability', 'learn', 'dance', 'quickly', 'DVD', '60', 'minutes', 'long', 'broken', '7', 'sections.Warm-Up-Taught', 'three', 'Ashley', 'Kym', 'Maksim', 'very', 'flowing', 'movements', 'taught', 'rather', 'slowly', 'done', 'enough', 'times', 'anyone', 'could', 'follow', 'Not', 'very', 'invigorating', 'however', ""n't"", 'really', 'set', 'tone', 'workout.Paso', 'Doble-This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'fabulous', 'toning', 'cardio', 'workout', 'was', 'terribly', 'boring', 'Maks', 'first', '6-7', 'minutes', 'are', 'full', 'same', '4', 'steps', 'Finally', 'more', 'fun', 'type', 'steps', 'still', 'rather', 'bored', 'teaching', 'Moves', 'included', 'are', 'lunges', 'flamenco', 'moves', 'more.Cha-Cha-Led', 'Ashly', ""n't"", 'low', 'cardio', ""n't"", 'medium', 'either', 'somewhere', 'Ashly', 'perfectly', 'bubbly', 'teacher', 'basic', 'cha-cha', 'steps', 'just', 'little', 'explanation', '6-7', 'minutes', 'then', 'together', 'combo', 'Moves', 'included', 'are', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'Spot', 'Turns', 'more.Samba-Kym', 'instructs', 'segment', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'very', 'motivating', 'style', 'fun', 'too', 'samba', 'finally', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'going', 'little', 'bit', 'fast', 'footwork', 'few', 'hops', 'Kym', 'will', 'go', 'slow', 'enough', 'get', 'fast', 'enough', 'heart', 'work', 'Moves', 'included', 'are', 'whisks', 'botofogos', 'more.Jive-This', 'routine', 'VERY', 'cardio', 'led', 'three', 'teachers', 'fun', 'interact', 'jive', 'really', 'fun', 'too', 'lot', 'hopping', 'kicking', 'so', 'get', 'ready', 'intense', 'workout', 'Moves', 'include', 'triple', 'steps', 'Lindy', 'Hop', 'steps', 'more.Challenge-The', 'three', 'teachers', 'try', 'mess', 'other', 'two', 'up', 'average', 'exerciser', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'done', 'DVD', '10', 'times', 'can', 'stand', 'do', 'many', 'times', 'try', 'again', 'find', 'are', 'better', 'Cool-Down-Full', 'relaxing', 'moves', 'stretches', 'great', 'cool-down', 'really', 'put', 'relaxed', 'mode.Overall', 'recommend', 'big', 'fans', 'otherwise', 'get', 'two', 'came', 'out', '2009', 'Dance', 'Off', 'Pounds', 'Dance', 'Body', 'Tone', 'are', 'better', 'one', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'though', 'more', 'introduction', 'ballroom/Latin', 'dance', 'workout']",N/A

1047551,A1PA7GOIOH10EE,B000MMMTC8,Ana V. Alberdi,"[0, 0]","I was looking for a cardio workout to do in the mornings to replace my running, since it is getting too dark outside to go out by myself. I saw this at Target and i was on the fence buying it (I usually like to read the reviews before buying something). I ended up getting it because of the dancing and the cardio. Man was that a mistake!1) the steps are hard to follow - it was very frustrating, many times i considered turning it off. a) they don't do any instructing, they just do it. in my experience with videos, a good instructor will count you in, for example, ""in four we will add a kick with the right leg to the side. one... two..."" etc. These instructors did not do that! they just did it with no warning. b) their dark pants make it hard to see how they're knees are bending, if at all, in order to do the movement properly. c) the camara keeps moving and filming their faces instead of their feet or having a full body shot. d) they don't do enough reps of some of the movements, so once you get it it's too late, time to move on to something else you probably won't get.2) I agree with other reviewers when they said that the final chapter, the improv, is a waste of time. I can hardly follow the 'instructed' part, how am I just going to wing it?3) I found the Jive dancing to be the easiest to follow of all, but what ruined it for me was their constant comments. ""that burns"" ""oh wow, no breather?"" ""holy crap!""  (i'm not kidding you, they actually said that!) - this exercise will get your heart rate up, but unless you're really out of shape, there's no burning sensation.4) Not much of a work out. As i mentioned earlier, I thought of turning this off many times, not only because it was frustrating trying to follow, but also because I was not getting a work out at all. I wasn't expecting to sweat as much as i do when i run, but i expected SOME heavy breathing or at least sweating. neither happend. I feel like I wasted 50 minutes.I'm gonna give this video another chance, maybe once i learn the steps i will be able to follow and be able to work the right muscles instead of trying to keep up, but you'll probably see this for sale here pretty soon.",2,So dissapointing - waste of time,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,2174,"['was', 'looking', 'cardio', 'workout', 'do', 'mornings', 'replace', 'running', 'getting', 'too', 'dark', 'go', 'out', 'saw', 'Target', 'i', 'was', 'fence', 'buying', 'usually', 'like', 'read', 'reviews', 'buying', 'something', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'dancing', 'cardio', 'Man', 'was', 'mistake', '1', 'steps', 'are', 'hard', 'follow', 'was', 'very', 'frustrating', 'many', 'times', 'i', 'considered', 'turning', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'instructing', 'just', 'do', 'experience', 'videos', 'good', 'instructor', 'will', 'count', 'example', 'four', 'will', 'add', 'kick', 'right', 'leg', 'side', 'one', 'two', 'etc', 'instructors', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'just', 'did', 'warning', 'b', 'dark', 'pants', 'make', 'hard', 'see', 'how', ""'re"", 'knees', 'are', 'bending', 'order', 'do', 'movement', 'properly', 'c', 'camara', 'moving', 'filming', 'instead', 'feet', 'having', 'full', 'body', 'shot', 'd', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'reps', 'movements', 'so', 'once', 'get', 'too', 'late', 'time', 'move', 'something', 'else', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get.2', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'when', 'said', 'final', 'chapter', 'improv', 'waste', 'time', 'can', 'hardly', 'follow', ""'instructed"", 'part', 'how', 'am', 'just', 'going', 'wing', '3', 'found', 'Jive', 'dancing', 'be', 'easiest', 'follow', 'what', 'ruined', 'was', 'constant', 'comments', 'oh', 'wow', 'breather', 'holy', 'crap', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'actually', 'said', 'exercise', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', ""'re"", 'really', 'shape', 'burning', 'sensation.4', 'Not', 'much', 'work', 'out', 'i', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'thought', 'turning', 'off', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'frustrating', 'trying', 'follow', 'also', 'was', 'not', 'getting', 'work', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'sweat', 'as', 'much', 'i', 'do', 'when', 'i', 'run', 'i', 'expected', 'SOME', 'heavy', 'breathing', 'least', 'sweating', 'happend', 'feel', 'wasted', '50', 'minutes.I', ""'m"", 'gon', 'give', 'video', 'chance', 'maybe', 'once', 'i', 'learn', 'steps', 'i', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'be', 'able', 'work', 'right', 'muscles', 'instead', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'see', 'sale', 'here', 'pretty', 'soon']",N/A

Pretty good warmup but too short to be of much benefit.2) 10 minutes- paso doble led by Maksim.  Not too bad.  Pretty easy to follow along.  A lot of lunges- hard on joints, especially knees.  For me, I would do a different step for that part.3)10 minutes- an extremely fast cha cha led by Ashly. I found her voice too high and chirpy; she kept repeating steps ie. back, back, back.  Very annoying.  Ended up skipping all together because too hard to follow.4)10 minutes- samba led by Kym.  Fairly easy to follow.  A lot twisting and jumping type moves- you definitely feel the ""burn"" in your hips and buns!  After more practice it'd probably be easier.  I'm a bit uncoordinated so I may need more time than most.5)10 minutes- jive led by all three.  Really fast, more complicated steps.  Needed to be broken down and done slower (at least to start out with).  A lot of jumping and kicking.  Not too bad on your joints.  Again, following along may become easier after more attempts.  This dance is probably easier for more experienced dancers... At least I'd hope- the pros make it look so easy, their movements smooth and fluid... Gotta give credit to the stars that manage to pull off this dance- it's not easy!6) 10 minutes- ""improv"" led by all three.  This section is a complete waste of time.  They're just doing whatever they feel like.  The other two have a hard enough time following the one leading- and we're supposed to follow??  I'm going to be skipping this part in the future. (Though, it is fun to watch the interplay between the three- their competitiveness, one wanting to stump the others.)7) 5 minute cooldown.  Not bad- some good stretches but too short.Overall, I don't see this as a good enough workout to keep you moving and your heart rate up.  Maybe it would be better with more dances and less time spent on each and nixing the ""improv"" section and longer warmup and cooldown.  I see myself doing this workout only when I'm not in the mood for anything too strenuous.  Though for only $10, I guess it's not that bad; you could do worse.  Dancing with the Stars fans will delight in seeing some favorites showcased.

1047574,A1I610BOEJMTGP,B000MMMTC8,Rayna,"[0, 0]","I bought this video to be both a workout (substitute for the gym) and a way to learn some simple dance moves (I'm especially interested in Latin dance). I'm a yoga teacher with a gymnastic background, so I figured it would be pretty easy to pick up on the dance moves. Wrong. Maybe it's just that in yoga, I'm so accustomed to explaining to people exactly what they should be doing with every part of their body at any given time, but I was often frustrated trying to follow the instructors on this video.I found Ashly to be the worst; she never explained any of the moves. Her instruction was more along the lines of ""now do the cha-cha."" Not exactly, of course, but that's what it felt like. She would just do complicated moves, acting like they were simple, and throw out some lingo that only people who already knew how to do the dance would understand. I spent a lot of time just stopping and trying to figure out exactly what I should be doing, since she never specified. And it got even more confusing a couple of times when she would say ""forward"" while they moved back, and vice versa. But then other times, forward would actually meant forward. That really tripped me up.The other two were a bit better but not by much. Maks probably gave the clearest instructions, but I find the Paso Doble a little slow and I usually skip that one. I really do like the cha-cha, but again, have a hard time learning the steps. The samba is fine, kind of fun but not my personal favorite. The jive is really fun, but even more difficult to pick up on at the speed they go. If they would only just show the basic steps slowly at first, and explain them a bit, it would make a big difference. I mean, tell me exactly what to do with my feet/legs/hips/etc.! Count out the steps as we do them! Something, please! It's just not beginner friendly.Oh, and that ""dance challenge"" at the end? That's just completely ridiculous. That really seems to be more for them than the viewer, as they give no instruction, change up the steps frequently, and move too quickly to give anyone else a chance to catch on. I mean, come on! They can barely follow each other at that point.However, I give this some stars (I wish I could've given 2.5 but since that's not possible I rounded up, to be nice) because I do feel like the dances are fun and can be a good workout. It's certainly more entertaining than the treadmill or a simple aerobic tape. It may require frequent watchings, and most likely some instances of simply watching without following in attempt to learn the moves, but I think I'll probably be able to get the hang of it and it'll be a lot more fun. I have some hope. But I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't have that kind of time or patience.",3,Just goes to show that just because you can do something doesn't mean you can teach it..,1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,2743,"['bought', 'video', 'be', 'workout', 'substitute', 'gym', 'way', 'learn', 'simple', 'dance', 'moves', ""'m"", 'especially', 'interested', 'Latin', 'dance', ""'m"", 'yoga', 'teacher', 'gymnastic', 'background', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'easy', 'pick', 'up', 'dance', 'moves', 'Wrong', 'Maybe', 'just', 'yoga', ""'m"", 'so', 'accustomed', 'explaining', 'people', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'part', 'body', 'given', 'time', 'was', 'often', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'follow', 'instructors', 'video.I', 'found', 'Ashly', 'be', 'worst', 'never', 'explained', 'moves', 'instruction', 'was', 'more', 'lines', 'now', 'do', 'cha-cha', 'Not', 'exactly', 'course', 'what', 'felt', 'would', 'just', 'do', 'complicated', 'moves', 'acting', 'were', 'simple', 'throw', 'out', 'lingo', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'already', 'knew', 'how', 'do', 'dance', 'would', 'understand', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'just', 'stopping', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'never', 'specified', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'would', 'say', 'forward', 'moved', 'back', 'vice', 'versa', 'then', 'other', 'times', 'forward', 'would', 'actually', 'meant', 'forward', 'really', 'tripped', 'up.The', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'bit', 'better', 'not', 'much', 'Maks', 'probably', 'gave', 'clearest', 'instructions', 'find', 'Paso', 'Doble', 'little', 'slow', 'usually', 'skip', 'one', 'really', 'do', 'cha-cha', 'again', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'learning', 'steps', 'samba', 'fine', 'kind', 'fun', 'not', 'personal', 'favorite', 'jive', 'really', 'fun', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'pick', 'up', 'speed', 'go', 'would', 'only', 'just', 'show', 'basic', 'steps', 'slowly', 'first', 'explain', 'bit', 'would', 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'mean', 'tell', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'feet/legs/hips/etc.', 'Count', 'steps', 'do', 'Something', 'please', 'just', 'not', 'beginner', 'friendly.Oh', 'dance', 'challenge', 'end', 'just', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'really', 'be', 'more', 'viewer', 'give', 'instruction', 'change', 'up', 'steps', 'frequently', 'move', 'too', 'quickly', 'give', 'anyone', 'else', 'chance', 'catch', 'mean', 'come', 'can', 'barely', 'follow', 'other', 'point.However', 'give', 'stars', 'wish', 'could', ""'ve"", 'given', '2.5', 'not', 'possible', 'rounded', 'up', 'be', 'nice', 'do', 'feel', 'dances', 'are', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'workout', 'certainly', 'more', 'entertaining', 'treadmill', 'simple', 'aerobic', 'tape', 'may', 'require', 'frequent', 'watchings', 'most', 'likely', 'instances', 'simply', 'watching', 'following', 'attempt', 'learn', 'moves', 'think', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'hang', ""'ll"", 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'fun', 'have', 'hope', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'kind', 'time', 'patience']",N/A

I love this show and especially the 3 pro dancers they picked to lead the workouts.The Paso Doble (lead by Maks) is fun and relatively easy to do. The Cha Cha Cha (Ashly) is just a bit more energetic with some twists that I cannot seem to be coordinated enough to do. (I guess I'm ChaCha-challenged.) The Samba (Kym) is bouncy with a lot of sidestepping and backwards/forwards like you see in regular aerobic workouts. The Jive (all 3), like the dance, is fun to watch but hard to keep up with. The ""triple, triple, triple..."" trips me up every time, among other things. This one you'll need to watch a few times before actually doing it. Then they start doing The Lindy. Holy cow. Even Maks said he was sweating!The Freestyle part at the end is more fun to watch than it is doable as a workout. I love watching the 3 of them interact and have fun while I go get a sandwich. I mean, a drink of water. They start with Samba moves, then go to the Cha Cha, then whatever structure there was disintegrates and they really start having fun. I think if you just use this as a rest period and watch the first few times through (it really is entertaining) you'll be able to dance along with them here later on.One really cool feature of this DVD is the ability to customize your own workout using only the dances you want to do. You can ""Add"" or ""Skip"" each section and create your own workout, in a way.

1047579,A1VGBF6COR3SIA,B000MMMTC8,"Susan Sloate, Author, FORWARD TO CAMELOT and ...","[38, 39]","I wanted this DVD from the first time I read about it. I ended up being a little intimidated by the reviews here because they said it was `so hard' and there was no explanation of the moves. So I hesitated to buy it. Then a friend gave it to me as a birthday present (I'd put it on my wish list anyway). Am I ever glad she did!This is one of the best workout DVD's I've ever had (definitely the best dance DVD), and the previous reviews don't do it justice. Yes, it's a DANCE workout -- and yes, they just show you the steps and then get it on with the routine. However ... if you've EVER done any formal dance moves, you'll know or can pick up most of these moves anyway.I'm not a dancer, but I've taken aerobics dance classes, a line dance class, and recently an intro to ballroom (yes, because of DANCING WITH THE STARS). I had no problem at all following this tape. When they showed a cha-cha step or a triple step or a turn, for instance, I already knew it. (BTW, it was not the ballroom class that taught me this, but the more general dance aerobics). The few steps I didn't know I just watched. The dancers repeated them several times (and the camera shows them full body), even if they didn't break them down and show them to you slowly. I caught on.The workout was incredible! The individual dances are really long (ten minutes each of continuous movement), plus a warmup and cooldown which were each five minutes. The DVD has some excellent features, among them the opportunity to program your own custom workout. I did the warmup, the cha cha, the jive and the cooldown, which was 30 minutes total, and I could feel it in every single muscle when I was done. Also, you can choose to do the workout with and without the dancers' instructions, which I think I'll try later when I'm more familiar with the routines. It's well thought out and well put together.The DVD features routines for the cha-cha, the paso doble, the samba, the jive and a bonus freestyle routine. I especially wanted to do the jive as it was never taught to me and I always loved it on the show. And when it was over -- I was SOAKED!The dancers are familiar to us all from the show, and they're very personable and fun to dance with. They treat you as a fellow dancer in that they just show you what they're doing and expect you to follow along. They also tell you a little about the origin of each dance as they're starting it, which I liked. (You probably already know this from the show, but I appreciated hearing it again.)Granted, this is NOT a workout for someone who's never danced and who needs the steps broken down bit by bit. But if you've had even a little dance training (or danced in clubs) and have seen the show, you'll be delighted at what this DVD can do for you. I seldom feel my workouts in my back and hips, but I feel this one! And because the moves are fun and high-energy and you already know the dancers, it doesn't feel like work (I HATE doing something just because it's supposed to be good for you!) It's a truly remarkable full-body workout, so your entire torso, arms and legs will get the benefit. And don't say I didn't warn you: Be prepared to hit the shower immediately afterward, because you are going to sweat!In sum -- be aware that the DVD is not for complete beginners. But you can have a minimal amount of dance knowledge and do fine with this. If you give yourself time to learn to do it well, it will be an amazing workout for you very soon. As someone who loves to dance, I know this will be a regular part of my exercise routine for a long time to come.Bravo, Maksim, Ashly and Kim!",5,A Super Dance Workout ... if you've ever danced at all,1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,3607,"['wanted', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'read', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'little', 'intimidated', 'reviews', 'here', 'said', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'was', 'explanation', 'moves', 'So', 'hesitated', 'buy', 'Then', 'friend', 'gave', 'birthday', 'present', ""'d"", 'put', 'wish', 'list', 'anyway', 'Am', 'ever', 'glad', 'did', 'one', 'best', 'workout', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'definitely', 'best', 'dance', 'DVD', 'previous', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'Yes', 'DANCE', 'workout', 'yes', 'just', 'show', 'steps', 'then', 'get', 'routine', 'However', ""'ve"", 'EVER', 'done', 'formal', 'dance', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'know', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'most', 'moves', 'anyway.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'dancer', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'aerobics', 'dance', 'classes', 'line', 'dance', 'class', 'recently', 'intro', 'ballroom', 'yes', 'DANCING', 'WITH', 'THE', 'STARS', 'had', 'problem', 'following', 'tape', 'When', 'showed', 'cha-cha', 'step', 'triple', 'step', 'turn', 'instance', 'already', 'knew', 'BTW', 'was', 'not', 'ballroom', 'class', 'taught', 'more', 'general', 'dance', 'aerobics', 'few', 'steps', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'watched', 'dancers', 'repeated', 'several', 'times', 'camera', 'full', 'body', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'show', 'slowly', 'caught', 'workout', 'was', 'incredible', 'individual', 'dances', 'are', 'really', 'long', 'ten', 'minutes', 'continuous', 'movement', 'warmup', 'cooldown', 'were', 'five', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'features', 'opportunity', 'program', 'own', 'custom', 'workout', 'did', 'warmup', 'cha', 'cha', 'jive', 'cooldown', 'was', '30', 'minutes', 'total', 'could', 'feel', 'single', 'muscle', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'Also', 'can', 'choose', 'do', 'workout', 'dancers', 'instructions', 'think', ""'ll"", 'try', 'later', 'when', ""'m"", 'more', 'familiar', 'routines', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'put', 'together.The', 'DVD', 'features', 'routines', 'cha-cha', 'paso', 'doble', 'samba', 'jive', 'bonus', 'freestyle', 'routine', 'especially', 'wanted', 'do', 'jive', 'was', 'never', 'taught', 'always', 'loved', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'SOAKED', 'dancers', 'are', 'familiar', 'show', ""'re"", 'very', 'personable', 'fun', 'dance', 'treat', 'fellow', 'dancer', 'just', 'show', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'expect', 'follow', 'along', 'also', 'tell', 'little', 'origin', 'dance', ""'re"", 'starting', 'liked', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'show', 'appreciated', 'hearing', 'again', 'Granted', 'NOT', 'workout', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'danced', 'who', 'steps', 'broken', 'down', 'bit', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'had', 'even', 'little', 'dance', 'training', 'danced', 'clubs', 'have', 'seen', 'show', ""'ll"", 'be', 'delighted', 'what', 'DVD', 'can', 'do', 'seldom', 'feel', 'workouts', 'back', 'hips', 'feel', 'one', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', 'high-energy', 'already', 'know', 'dancers', ""n't"", 'feel', 'work', 'HATE', 'doing', 'something', 'just', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'full-body', 'workout', 'entire', 'torso', 'arms', 'legs', 'will', 'get', 'benefit', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'Be', 'prepared', 'hit', 'shower', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'are', 'going', 'sweat', 'sum', 'be', 'aware', 'DVD', 'not', 'complete', 'beginners', 'can', 'have', 'minimal', 'amount', 'dance', 'knowledge', 'do', 'fine', 'give', 'time', 'learn', 'do', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'amazing', 'workout', 'very', 'soon', 'someone', 'who', 'dance', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'regular', 'part', 'exercise', 'routine', 'long', 'time', 'come.Bravo', 'Maksim', 'Ashly', 'Kim']",N/A
1047580,A2T33U7BJ2517Z,B000MMMTC8,"TNTSafari ""TNT""","[15, 18]","I definitely agree with the reviews that mention how the DVD lacks instruction on how to do all the dances. You can easily get mixed up in some spots, trying to mimic what they're doing just on your own. Although I was leary about being able to do any of it (after reading some of the reviews), I was relieved that it was more manageable than I had grown to expect it to be. Trust me, I'm not saying it's easy. I definitely don't fall into the ""you're a natural"" category. I think it's true when some reviews mentioned that it'll probably get better over time, getting more used to all the moves etc. I just know that I managed to work up a sweat still, even though I couldn't manage all the moves properly on the 1st try. And even though I may never manage some of them, I can still just replace certain harder spots with moves that are easier for me. I agree that the Paso is an easier segment to keep up with because it's not as fast-paced of a dance as the other three. Although some people stated that the Jive was the most difficult, I'd have to say some parts of the Cha Cha proved tougher for me; if you have difficulty with that basic 1-2, 1-2-3 criss cross move, then it makes it hard to not get mixed up from time to time; if you're like me, you might have trouble coordinating your feet with the criss-crossing of your knees at the same time. Also, you may run into complications alone just depending on the size of the room you have to workout in. Each 10 minute segment had moves that required me to shift direction in the room as a result of it's small size; for some moves (like moving forward and back) I needed to perform them while vertically positioned in the room, and for other moves (like moving right & left) I needed to perform them while horizontally positioned in the room. And so flip flopping between those different moves throughout each segment can add to the complexity of the workout. In that regard, you'll need enough room to move forward & back and right & left anywhere from 4-8 spaces. Overall, it's a keeper although not a 100% pleaser.",3,"Not Great, But Still Good...",1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,2075,"['definitely', 'agree', 'reviews', 'mention', 'how', 'DVD', 'instruction', 'how', 'do', 'dances', 'can', 'easily', 'get', 'mixed', 'up', 'spots', 'trying', 'mimic', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'just', 'own', 'was', 'leary', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'reading', 'reviews', 'was', 'relieved', 'was', 'more', 'manageable', 'had', 'grown', 'expect', 'be', 'Trust', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'easy', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'fall', ""'re"", 'natural', 'category', 'think', 'true', 'when', 'reviews', 'mentioned', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'better', 'time', 'getting', 'more', 'used', 'moves', 'etc', 'just', 'know', 'managed', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'still', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'manage', 'moves', 'properly', '1st', 'try', 'even', 'may', 'never', 'manage', 'can', 'still', 'just', 'replace', 'certain', 'harder', 'spots', 'moves', 'are', 'easier', 'agree', 'Paso', 'easier', 'segment', 'keep', 'up', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'dance', 'other', 'three', 'people', 'stated', 'Jive', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'parts', 'Cha', 'Cha', 'proved', 'tougher', 'have', 'difficulty', 'basic', '1-2', '1-2-3', 'criss', 'cross', 'move', 'then', 'hard', 'not', 'get', 'mixed', 'time', 'time', ""'re"", 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'coordinating', 'feet', 'criss-crossing', 'knees', 'same', 'time', 'Also', 'may', 'run', 'complications', 'alone', 'just', 'depending', 'size', 'room', 'have', 'workout', '10', 'minute', 'segment', 'had', 'moves', 'required', 'shift', 'direction', 'room', 'result', 'small', 'size', 'moves', 'moving', 'forward', 'back', 'needed', 'perform', 'vertically', 'positioned', 'room', 'other', 'moves', 'moving', 'right', 'left', 'needed', 'perform', 'horizontally', 'positioned', 'room', 'so', 'flip', 'flopping', 'different', 'moves', 'segment', 'can', 'add', 'complexity', 'workout', 'regard', ""'ll"", 'need', 'enough', 'room', 'move', 'forward', 'back', 'right', 'left', 'anywhere', '4-8', 'spaces', 'Overall', 'keeper', 'not', '100', '%', 'pleaser']",N/A
1047581,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000MMMTC8,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[4, 6]","Many have written reviews already...I just wanted to add above, that they almost never go 1/2 speed to teach & if they do, it's for 4 steps & then super speed. 95% of the time they go normal speed with only saying ""kick kick kick..."" say for the lindy, but you are kicking forward and behind on one leg & back & forward on the other which would take time to learn in a slower speed. (Yes, I can see HOW they do it, but I cannot do it myself (and most people can't either) unless it's shown 1/2 speed at least for 1 min.) I don't care what anyone else says, unless you have had training, are a natural dancer or an unusually VERY quick learner in the physical area, you will be lost & frustrated.The set/colors are great, the camera zeros on on faces & close ups of the great physics, which mean even though there are 3 rows of dancers most times, you still can't see their feet.The fake banter ""OOhh... I feel this in my gluts, I'm sweating, can we take a break?"" after only 2 min (costume changes between each set) is so fake.. I did not feel anything in any muscles and I am not a skinny thing either.The most important to me... the music was too old ballroom style, I was hoping for something more lively, ethnic for the latin dances and the dancers didn't seem to have any fun except for a little in the Jive section with the faster, fun music. If they are stiff and not having fun, neither am I.You will learn some new moves and yeah, these moves aren't hard in terms of physical ability at all (seems they almost expect the audience to have very little energy ability or muscle strength), but it would take watching it over & over & wear down your rewind button to get your feet to move correctly even somewhat close to what they are doing.I would add TWO stars if there was a SEPARATE section to teach you the moves in 1/2 time for more then a few seconds each.
