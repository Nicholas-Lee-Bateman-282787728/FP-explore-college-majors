1553477,AVWV1C6ASEQ3B,B008HHTDEM,Area88,"[3, 3]","Discotek aka Eastern Star has released Eternal Fantasy for the very first time in the US. Before this release, this movie was very rare outside Japan and for years, fans could only watch low quality versions without subtitles. Now at last, the final movie in Galaxy Express 999 series is available to fans and it meets expectations. It's also a standalond piece, set 1 year after the other works, so previous knowledge is not a necessity but is helpful.Eternal Fntasy was released in 1998 and was one of the last productions to use Cel Animation. Although made in the late 90's, if you didn't know the production date, you would be forgiven for thinking it was made in the mid 80's. The animation is incredibly vivid and bright, there's not a single scratch, mark or grain on the entire print. The video is clearly using a remastered telecline print from an R2J DVD source and is in Progessive Scan and Widescreen Anamorphic. The audio is clearly remastered as well, as every sound is crystal clear and delivered to a perfect note. The orchestral score and music really shines through on this release.Unlike the previous two movies Galaxy Express 999 and Adieu, there is no English dub available. Viz dubbed both movies in the 90's but never aquired the rights to this one so no dub exists for Discotek to use. This will give some fans, the oppurtunity to listen to the Japanese audio and voice actors and familiarise themselves with it before the TV series release by S'more Entertainment, which is coming in Novembe this yearr. It will also be Japanese with English subtitles only but I'm sure the low price point and the high episode point will encourage alot of people to take the plunge.Eternal Fantasy has a interesting story although the pacing at the beginning was a little slow for my liking but that's just nitpicking, since this is typical Leiji Matsumoto material, emotional and psychological. Directed by Rhintaro who did the first two movies and other high budget movies like Dagger of Kamui, Phoenix: Karma Chapter (must see) and less known, more experimental pieces like the OVA's Take the X Train and Bride of Deimos. I would happily add this title to his list of achievements.The middle to ending this movie really delivers, there's action, tension and lots of plot twists. I love the fact we get introduced to Captain Harlock, first his ship, then his actual character, as he offers help and words of inspiration. The ending was really spectacular and I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, in many ways,  it became classic Evangelion, lots of angst, more questions and cliffhangers rather than answers, hints of characters we don't get to see, also a suspected sequel. The space scenes were geting really epic, had an almost Legend of Galactic Heroes feel to it. I just wish there was more.Grade: A-",5,"EMOTIONAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, EPIC SPACE OPERA FROM 1998",1347753600,"09 16, 2012",2012,2829,"['Discotek', 'Eastern', 'Star', 'released', 'Eternal', 'Fantasy', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'US', 'release', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'rare', 'Japan', 'years', 'fans', 'could', 'only', 'watch', 'low', 'quality', 'versions', 'subtitles', 'Now', 'last', 'final', 'movie', 'Galaxy', 'Express', '999', 'series', 'available', 'fans', 'expectations', 'also', 'standalond', 'piece', 'set', '1', 'year', 'other', 'works', 'so', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'not', 'necessity', 'helpful.Eternal', 'Fntasy', 'was', 'released', '1998', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'productions', 'use', 'Cel', 'Animation', 'made', 'late', '90', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'production', 'date', 'would', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'was', 'made', 'mid', '80', 'animation', 'incredibly', 'vivid', 'bright', 'not', 'single', 'scratch', 'mark', 'grain', 'entire', 'print', 'video', 'clearly', 'using', 'remastered', 'telecline', 'print', 'R2J', 'DVD', 'source', 'Progessive', 'Scan', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', 'audio', 'clearly', 'remastered', 'as', 'well', 'sound', 'crystal', 'clear', 'delivered', 'perfect', 'note', 'orchestral', 'score', 'music', 'really', 'release.Unlike', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'Galaxy', 'Express', '999', 'Adieu', 'English', 'dub', 'available', 'Viz', 'dubbed', 'movies', '90', 'never', 'aquired', 'rights', 'one', 'so', 'dub', 'Discotek', 'use', 'will', 'give', 'fans', 'oppurtunity', 'listen', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'voice', 'actors', 'familiarise', 'TV', 'series', 'release', ""S'more"", 'Entertainment', 'coming', 'Novembe', 'yearr', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'only', ""'m"", 'sure', 'low', 'price', 'point', 'high', 'episode', 'point', 'will', 'encourage', 'alot', 'people', 'take', 'plunge.Eternal', 'Fantasy', 'interesting', 'story', 'pacing', 'beginning', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'liking', 'just', 'nitpicking', 'typical', 'Leiji', 'Matsumoto', 'material', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'Directed', 'Rhintaro', 'who', 'did', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'other', 'high', 'budget', 'movies', 'Dagger', 'Kamui', 'Phoenix', 'Karma', 'Chapter', 'must', 'see', 'less', 'known', 'more', 'experimental', 'pieces', 'OVA', 'Take', 'X', 'Train', 'Bride', 'Deimos', 'would', 'happily', 'add', 'title', 'list', 'achievements.The', 'middle', 'ending', 'movie', 'really', 'delivers', 'action', 'tension', 'lots', 'plot', 'twists', 'love', 'fact', 'get', 'introduced', 'Captain', 'Harlock', 'first', 'ship', 'then', 'actual', 'character', 'help', 'words', 'inspiration', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'spectacular', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'many', 'ways', 'became', 'classic', 'Evangelion', 'lots', 'angst', 'more', 'questions', 'cliffhangers', 'rather', 'answers', 'hints', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'also', 'suspected', 'sequel', 'space', 'scenes', 'were', 'geting', 'really', 'epic', 'had', 'almost', 'Legend', 'Galactic', 'Heroes', 'feel', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more.Grade', 'A-']",N/A

I first became a fan when I saw Galaxy Express 999 (1979) as a kid and loved the Maetel and Tetsuo art and story which haunted me.  In that movie, he looked like a boy instead of a blob with teeth.  Many years later and having seen other Galaxy Express shows, I realize the blob seems to be the more prevalent version with 999 and Adieu being the two with the non-blob versions.  Even without the blob Tetsuo, the art is just scratchy and bad looking so I stick by my 2 star rating.",2,art is terrible,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",2014,584,"['Perhaps', 'unfairly', 'am', 'rating', 'art', 'alone', 'was', 'so', 'terrible', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'continue', 'first', 'became', 'fan', 'when', 'saw', 'Galaxy', 'Express', '999', '1979', 'kid', 'loved', 'Maetel', 'Tetsuo', 'art', 'story', 'haunted', 'movie', 'looked', 'boy', 'instead', 'blob', 'teeth', 'Many', 'years', 'later', 'having', 'seen', 'other', 'Galaxy', 'Express', 'shows', 'realize', 'blob', 'be', 'more', 'prevalent', 'version', '999', 'Adieu', 'being', 'two', 'non-blob', 'versions', 'Even', 'blob', 'Tetsuo', 'art', 'just', 'scratchy', 'bad', 'looking', 'so', 'stick', '2', 'star', 'rating']",N/A

1553481,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B008HHTDEM,Stephen M. Lerch,"[1, 1]","Eternal Fantasy is the late 90s follow up to the original Galaxy Express 999 series. My understanding is that Matsumoto Leiji began a GE999 spin-off in the '90s and this was a film designed to capture that. Unfortunately it hints at a much longer journey that we were never treated to in animated form. And I believe Matsumoto actually stopped writing it, or put it on permanent hiatus.The film takes place 1 year after the end of the TV series (or possibly the movies - it's really just academic). Maetel returns to Earth to save Tetsuro who is needed to travel the rails once again.Video-The show itself is an amalgamation of cel based animation, mixed in with some 3D models of the Galaxy Express. The 3D is quite laughable given it was attempted at a time when animation studios were experimenting with 3D animation.There are no issues to be seen in the video itself. It's well encoded and the original elements must be in great shape. I have the Japanese R2 DVD as well and I think the video is either exactly the same, or so close you can't tell.Audio-This is where it might fall down for one set of fans. If you're a fan of English dubbed Anime, you will be disappointed in this release. There is absolutely no English dub option.There are optional English subtitles.For those that enjoyed the voice acting of the original Japanese seiyuu/voice actors, you will appreciate that all of the key figures retain their original seiyuu from the 80s (and for Maetel and Tetsuro, the same seiyuu are heard in the hand full of Anime they were part of during the 2000s). No pops, clicks or other weirdness. It is just a simple stereo mix, but the effects really do a good job of using the stereo sound stage.Packaging-This follows the theme set by the other two releases by Discotek. It uses the same fonts and logo design and is well done. The back has a description and a few screen caps. Nothing amazing, but nothing horrible stands out.Extras-What extras? Really, all that's there are trailers, so it's nothing really of note.Over all-Never in a million years was it expected that anyone would ever pick up the Galaxy Express 999 and Adieu films for release on US DVD. Discotek did it, then not in a million years did I think we would see Eternal Fantasy... then Discotek delivered! Then... who ever would have thought the 113 episode TV series would be released on North American DVD? It was, but unfortunately Discotek didn't get that one, meaning we were slapped with streaming quality video on DVD. It is being released, however, so I guess that's good for fans.If you don't have any experience with Galaxy Express, you probably don't want to pick this up. There really is zero character development of the main characters, outside of the enemy. If you ARE a fan of GE 999, this is definitely worth seeing.",5,"Great video, great audio for a DVD",1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2012,2811,"['Eternal', 'Fantasy', 'late', '90s', 'follow', 'up', 'original', 'Galaxy', 'Express', '999', 'series', 'My', 'understanding', 'Matsumoto', 'Leiji', 'began', 'GE999', 'spin-off', ""'90s"", 'was', 'film', 'designed', 'capture', 'Unfortunately', 'much', 'longer', 'journey', 'were', 'never', 'treated', 'animated', 'form', 'believe', 'Matsumoto', 'actually', 'stopped', 'writing', 'put', 'permanent', 'hiatus.The', 'film', 'place', '1', 'year', 'end', 'TV', 'series', 'possibly', 'movies', 'really', 'just', 'academic', 'Maetel', 'Earth', 'save', 'Tetsuro', 'who', 'needed', 'travel', 'rails', 'once', 'again.Video-The', 'show', 'amalgamation', 'cel', 'based', 'animation', 'mixed', '3D', 'models', 'Galaxy', 'Express', '3D', 'quite', 'laughable', 'given', 'was', 'attempted', 'time', 'when', 'animation', 'studios', 'were', 'experimenting', '3D', 'are', 'issues', 'be', 'seen', 'video', 'well', 'encoded', 'original', 'elements', 'must', 'be', 'great', 'shape', 'have', 'Japanese', 'R2', 'DVD', 'well', 'think', 'video', 'either', 'exactly', 'same', 'so', 'close', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell.Audio-This', 'where', 'might', 'fall', 'down', 'one', 'set', 'fans', ""'re"", 'fan', 'English', 'dubbed', 'Anime', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'release', 'absolutely', 'English', 'dub', 'are', 'optional', 'English', 'subtitles.For', 'enjoyed', 'voice', 'acting', 'original', 'Japanese', 'seiyuu/voice', 'actors', 'will', 'appreciate', 'key', 'figures', 'retain', 'original', 'seiyuu', '80s', 'Maetel', 'Tetsuro', 'same', 'seiyuu', 'are', 'heard', 'hand', 'full', 'Anime', 'were', 'part', '2000s', 'pops', 'clicks', 'other', 'weirdness', 'just', 'simple', 'stereo', 'mix', 'effects', 'really', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'using', 'stereo', 'sound', 'stage.Packaging-This', 'theme', 'set', 'other', 'two', 'releases', 'Discotek', 'same', 'fonts', 'logo', 'design', 'well', 'done', 'back', 'description', 'few', 'screen', 'caps', 'Nothing', 'amazing', 'nothing', 'horrible', 'out.Extras-What', 'extras', 'Really', 'are', 'trailers', 'nothing', 'really', 'note.Over', 'all-Never', 'million', 'years', 'was', 'expected', 'anyone', 'would', 'ever', 'pick', 'up', 'Galaxy', 'Express', '999', 'Adieu', 'films', 'release', 'US', 'DVD', 'Discotek', 'did', 'then', 'not', 'million', 'years', 'did', 'think', 'would', 'see', 'Eternal', 'Fantasy', 'then', 'Discotek', 'delivered', 'Then', 'who', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'thought', '113', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'released', 'North', 'American', 'DVD', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'Discotek', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'meaning', 'were', 'slapped', 'streaming', 'quality', 'video', 'DVD', 'being', 'released', 'however', 'guess', 'good', 'fans.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'Galaxy', 'Express', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'really', 'zero', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'characters', 'enemy', 'ARE', 'fan', 'GE', '999', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
