Amina's rebel spirit and fierce defiance create much of the tension in the film, but its heart comes from the moving portrait of a bi-racial romance.

The actresses are very beautiful, particularly Lisa Ray, but don't expect any explicit lesbian sex: both actresses are straight women married to men in real life, and the love scene is reduced to one chaste kiss. The story is set in 1950s South Africa, and is very layered in exposing prejudice of different kinds: apartheid and racial discrimination, the inequities and unfair power of men and women in marriage, Indian cultural constrictions; and of course sexual preference in an conservative society is a main topic. Lisa Ray plays a married woman with three children in an unsatisfying marriage to a husband who cheats on her, but who cannot deny her feelings to a young woman who dresses like a man and is free about her sexual identity.
