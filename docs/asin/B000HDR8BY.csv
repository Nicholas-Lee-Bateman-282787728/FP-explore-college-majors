How does a woman who wears make-up like that think she can teach about beauty? Why should anyone listen to a woman teach about style when she's wearing the ugliest clothing imaginable?Further, there was a certain disregard for the Afghan women that I found abhorrent. For example, the woman who got the academy started (I'll call her #1) had a wonderful vision of big open windows all along the front, so people outside could look in and see the great things that were going on inside. Then #1 went home and #2 took over. The Afghan women told #2 that they did not like the big open windows so #2 covered them with light airy curtains, which let in the light while affording the students some privacy. A while later #1 came back to check on progress. She was very upset about the curtains and immediately ordered that they be taken down. She spent no time at all listening to anyone as to the purpose of the curtains. Who cares what #2 had discovered. Who cares what the Afghan women wanted. #1 wanted things her way.A bit later, the academy teachers went to visit one of the graduates. They told her what she was doing was wonderful. They told her that the world would be much better if women ran it. And when the Afghan woman left the room, they looked over her studio and criticized it behind her back.Oh yea, the world would be better so much better if bitchy women ran it.",1,Disappointing,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,1460,"['How', 'woman', 'who', 'hair', 'think', 'can', 'teach', 'hair', 'care', 'How', 'woman', 'who', 'make-up', 'think', 'can', 'teach', 'beauty', 'Why', 'should', 'anyone', 'listen', 'woman', 'teach', 'style', 'when', 'wearing', 'ugliest', 'clothing', 'imaginable', 'Further', 'was', 'certain', 'disregard', 'Afghan', 'women', 'found', 'abhorrent', 'example', 'woman', 'who', 'got', 'academy', 'started', ""'ll"", 'call', '1', 'had', 'wonderful', 'vision', 'big', 'open', 'front', 'people', 'outside', 'could', 'look', 'see', 'great', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'inside', 'Then', '1', 'went', 'home', '2', 'took', 'over', 'Afghan', 'women', 'told', '2', 'did', 'not', 'big', 'open', 'windows', 'so', '2', 'covered', 'light', 'airy', 'curtains', 'let', 'light', 'affording', 'students', 'privacy', 'while', 'later', '1', 'came', 'back', 'check', 'progress', 'was', 'very', 'upset', 'curtains', 'immediately', 'ordered', 'be', 'taken', 'down', 'spent', 'time', 'listening', 'anyone', 'purpose', 'curtains', 'Who', 'what', '2', 'had', 'discovered', 'Who', 'what', 'Afghan', 'women', 'wanted', '1', 'wanted', 'things', 'way.A', 'bit', 'later', 'academy', 'teachers', 'went', 'visit', 'one', 'graduates', 'told', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'wonderful', 'told', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'women', 'ran', 'when', 'Afghan', 'woman', 'left', 'room', 'looked', 'studio', 'criticized', 'back.Oh', 'yea', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'bitchy', 'women', 'ran']",The Beauty Academy of Kabul

Director Liz Mermin follows this venture from the grand opening and selection of the first class to the graduation dinner three months later. Two of the volunteers, Sima and Shaima, had emigrated from Afghanistan to the United States more than twenty years earlier, and their cultural reconnection is emotionally powerful. ""It's been twenty years since I was here,"" observes Sima, ""but the country has regressed a hundred years."" Two other volunteers are positively obnoxious; they cannot understand why these Afghan women would not wear makeup, drive, or anger their husbands. One of them begins classes with yoga meditation as the Afghan women giggle. Another gushes that their project is not just about hair and makeup but about ""healing the country."" The real heroes that make this film worth watching, though, are the Afghan women. ""Our men have backwards mentalities,"" one of them laments. I found the symbolism of a beauty parlor run by culturally insensitive American do-gooders in a conservative Muslim country rich with paradox.

1013154,A11XAIFA10G7TS,B000HDR8BY,"Holly ""Book addict""","[0, 0]","I had read the book written about the beauty school when it first came out and just got around to watching the documentary this weekend.  I am so glad I made the effort and would recommend all westerners view this if possible.The Afghani women are incredible -- the sacrifices they make to to attend the school and better themselves are unbelievable.  Trying to go to school with children playing at your feet before going home to cook with none of luxuries of an American kitchen and a husband who doesn't view it his role to help make be tired just watching it.  The Americans that go into the school appear to have basically very good intentions and I applaud that they are willing to disrupt their lives to help others.  That being said, there was a lot of ""ugly"" American in this film.  They were largely arrogant, insensitive and disrepectful of the culture in which these women live.  The students have come through war and poverty and one of the instructors reams them out for not being more foward-thinking in their hair color. What?  Another instructor seems to be totally shocked and confused as to why these women seem to be afraid of their husbands.  I just wanted to so ""Hello -- are all you Americans stupid ?  Did you not spend some time before going there trying to understand the way these women live and the culture/laws of the country?""My one complaint is that I wish more time had been spent on the Afghani women's stories.  They were more interesting than the Americans but got less time focused on their lives.",4,Interesting and should be seen by all,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,1533,"['had', 'read', 'book', 'written', 'beauty', 'school', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'just', 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'documentary', 'weekend', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'made', 'effort', 'would', 'recommend', 'westerners', 'view', 'possible.The', 'Afghani', 'women', 'are', 'incredible', 'sacrifices', 'make', 'attend', 'school', 'better', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'Trying', 'go', 'school', 'children', 'playing', 'feet', 'going', 'home', 'cook', 'none', 'luxuries', 'American', 'kitchen', 'husband', 'who', ""n't"", 'view', 'role', 'help', 'make', 'be', 'tired', 'just', 'watching', 'Americans', 'go', 'school', 'appear', 'have', 'basically', 'very', 'good', 'intentions', 'applaud', 'are', 'willing', 'disrupt', 'lives', 'help', 'others', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'lot', 'ugly', 'American', 'film', 'were', 'largely', 'arrogant', 'insensitive', 'disrepectful', 'culture', 'women', 'live', 'students', 'have', 'come', 'war', 'poverty', 'one', 'instructors', 'reams', 'out', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'foward-thinking', 'hair', 'color', 'What', 'instructor', 'be', 'totally', 'shocked', 'confused', 'why', 'women', 'seem', 'be', 'afraid', 'husbands', 'just', 'wanted', 'Hello', 'are', 'Americans', 'stupid', 'Did', 'not', 'spend', 'time', 'going', 'there', 'trying', 'understand', 'way', 'women', 'live', 'culture/laws', 'country', 'one', 'complaint', 'wish', 'more', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'spent', 'Afghani', 'women', 'stories', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'Americans', 'got', 'less', 'time', 'focused', 'lives']",The Beauty Academy of Kabul
1013155,A140XH16IKR4B0,B000HDR8BY,Jean E. Pouliot,"[34, 37]","""The Beauty Academy of Kabul"" is a documentary about a group of American women hairdressers who travel to Kabul to teach hairdressing to Afghani women in the post-Taliban era. The film has many positives, mainly its interviews with the women students. Surprisingly, many seem cheerful. A few talk about the war or the Taliban. But against the backdrop of bombed out buildings and ruined villas, their laughter is obviously a defense against unbearable inner pain. The glimpses of their lives -- the houses they live in, the music they listen to, the images they watch and the structure of their families -- is priceless.While I admire the Americans for their act of kindness, it becomes clear early on that they are almost completely insensitive to the mores of the Afghanis. The students, first of all, are survivors of a brutal regime in a male-dominated, Islamic society. Under the Taliban, many risked punishment to run beauty salons out their own homes.To hear these women being lectured by know-it-all Americans was ghastly. Almost to a person, the Americans were arrogant and insensitive. One woman figured she would single-handedly ""liberate"" the streets by driving a car -- unheard of in that country. The stares and glares she received did not seem to faze her. Another woman engaged the students in pre-class meditation -- something that must have seemed bizarre (and faintly heretical!) to these Muslim women. Most of the teachers treated their students as rookies -- unmoved that they had been working in the business for years and years. Overall, the Afghani women were serious, devout, family-oriented workaholics. The Americans -- beauty-obsessed, swinging singles and into New Age religion if any at all -- epitomized the stereotype that Americans are loud, brash, disconnected and uncaring.This was not a feel-good story about cultures learning from one another. It was a story about one culture enduring the rudeness of another in return for advancing its own agenda. It's not clear whether the filmmakers were aware of how awful their subjects looked. It's not clear that they realized the horrific rudeness that was being recorded.  Anyway, horrors and all, ""The Beauty Academy Of Kabul"" could have been a great film had it bothered to ask a few questions, such as, Now that the Americans have left, are you glad they came? What did you think of them? Does meeting them make you more or less receptive to Western values? And so on. It was a major shortcoming that the film left these questions unexpressed. Still, the value of a glimpse into real life in an alien culture was quote worthwhile.",3,...and ugly goes right to the bone.,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,2614,"['Beauty', 'Academy', 'Kabul', 'documentary', 'group', 'American', 'women', 'hairdressers', 'who', 'travel', 'Kabul', 'teach', 'hairdressing', 'Afghani', 'women', 'post-Taliban', 'era', 'film', 'many', 'positives', 'mainly', 'interviews', 'women', 'students', 'Surprisingly', 'many', 'seem', 'cheerful', 'few', 'talk', 'war', 'Taliban', 'backdrop', 'bombed', 'buildings', 'ruined', 'villas', 'laughter', 'obviously', 'defense', 'unbearable', 'inner', 'pain', 'glimpses', 'lives', 'houses', 'live', 'music', 'listen', 'images', 'watch', 'structure', 'families', 'priceless.While', 'admire', 'Americans', 'act', 'kindness', 'clear', 'early', 'are', 'almost', 'completely', 'insensitive', 'mores', 'Afghanis', 'students', 'first', 'are', 'survivors', 'brutal', 'regime', 'male-dominated', 'Islamic', 'society', 'Taliban', 'many', 'risked', 'punishment', 'run', 'beauty', 'salons', 'out', 'own', 'homes.To', 'women', 'being', 'lectured', 'know-it-all', 'Americans', 'was', 'ghastly', 'Almost', 'person', 'Americans', 'were', 'arrogant', 'insensitive', 'One', 'woman', 'figured', 'would', 'single-handedly', 'liberate', 'streets', 'driving', 'car', 'unheard', 'country', 'stares', 'received', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'faze', 'woman', 'engaged', 'students', 'pre-class', 'meditation', 'something', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'bizarre', 'faintly', 'heretical', 'Muslim', 'women', 'Most', 'teachers', 'treated', 'students', 'rookies', 'unmoved', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'business', 'years', 'years', 'Overall', 'Afghani', 'women', 'were', 'serious', 'devout', 'family-oriented', 'workaholics', 'Americans', 'beauty-obsessed', 'swinging', 'singles', 'New', 'Age', 'religion', 'epitomized', 'stereotype', 'Americans', 'are', 'loud', 'brash', 'disconnected', 'uncaring.This', 'was', 'not', 'feel-good', 'story', 'cultures', 'learning', 'one', 'was', 'story', 'one', 'culture', 'enduring', 'rudeness', 'return', 'advancing', 'own', 'agenda', 'not', 'clear', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'aware', 'how', 'awful', 'subjects', 'looked', 'not', 'clear', 'realized', 'horrific', 'rudeness', 'was', 'being', 'recorded', 'Anyway', 'horrors', 'Beauty', 'Academy', 'Kabul', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'had', 'bothered', 'ask', 'few', 'questions', 'such', 'Now', 'Americans', 'have', 'left', 'are', 'glad', 'came', 'What', 'did', 'think', 'meeting', 'make', 'more', 'less', 'receptive', 'Western', 'values', 'so', 'was', 'major', 'shortcoming', 'film', 'left', 'questions', 'unexpressed', 'Still', 'value', 'glimpse', 'real', 'life', 'alien', 'culture', 'was', 'quote', 'worthwhile']",The Beauty Academy of Kabul
1013156,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B000HDR8BY,Junglies,"[3, 5]","This short documentary works for me on several levels.Taking it at face value, an international group of hairdressers, American, British and Afghani establish a Beauty School in Kabul, to restore an institution which had been targeted for destruction and outlawed by the Taliban regime. It is a story which can be construed as amerikan imperialism, introducing a capitalistic, secular business in the capital city of Kabul a feat which is only possible because of the security of NATO troops in the city.  However, it becomes clear from some of the cameos of the students that hairstyling and makeup were underground activities that many women were demanding even under the threat of beheadings and the more extreme punishments available under Sharia. Throughout the film there is the juxtaposition of images of beauty and sisterhood with those of armed men looking on with considerable bemusement.On another level though, the film raises as many questions as answers. One is struck by the admission of one refugee to America of her feelings of guilt after leaving her homeland, that she did nothing to help her abandoned Afghani ""sisters"" in the series of struggles which beset her native country. What sort of society did exist in Afghanistan before the Russian invasion? We know that there was some sort of monarchy which, following a coup, became some sort of republic. Did it meet the George Bush Jr. test of a democracy? Then came the Russian invasion and the establishment of the jihadist movement, finance and armed by the US and led by one Osama bin Laden. Did the CIA know or even suspect that this would lead to the establishment of a particular type of an Islamic Republic led by the Taliban?On a human level, it is clear from the level of interest of ordinary Afghan women that beauty and makeup are things that they are interested in but they must bow to the wishes of their husbands and families who may not approve of their use of make up or different hair styles. While not wishing to tread in or on the footsteps of feminists here, I for one, believe that it is an inalienable right of every person to have self-determination.This little film deserves much wider attention than it has received. I heartily recommend it to everyone.",5,I shall be released,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2249,"['short', 'documentary', 'works', 'several', 'levels.Taking', 'face', 'value', 'international', 'group', 'hairdressers', 'American', 'British', 'Afghani', 'establish', 'Beauty', 'School', 'Kabul', 'restore', 'institution', 'had', 'been', 'targeted', 'destruction', 'outlawed', 'Taliban', 'regime', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'construed', 'amerikan', 'imperialism', 'introducing', 'capitalistic', 'secular', 'business', 'capital', 'city', 'Kabul', 'feat', 'only', 'possible', 'security', 'NATO', 'troops', 'city', 'However', 'clear', 'cameos', 'students', 'hairstyling', 'makeup', 'were', 'underground', 'activities', 'many', 'women', 'were', 'demanding', 'even', 'threat', 'beheadings', 'more', 'extreme', 'punishments', 'available', 'Sharia', 'film', 'juxtaposition', 'images', 'beauty', 'sisterhood', 'armed', 'men', 'looking', 'considerable', 'bemusement.On', 'level', 'film', 'as', 'many', 'questions', 'answers', 'One', 'struck', 'admission', 'one', 'refugee', 'America', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'leaving', 'homeland', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'abandoned', 'Afghani', 'sisters', 'series', 'struggles', 'beset', 'native', 'country', 'What', 'sort', 'society', 'did', 'exist', 'Afghanistan', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'know', 'was', 'sort', 'monarchy', 'following', 'coup', 'became', 'sort', 'republic', 'Did', 'meet', 'George', 'Bush', 'Jr.', 'test', 'democracy', 'Then', 'came', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'establishment', 'jihadist', 'movement', 'finance', 'armed', 'US', 'led', 'one', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'Did', 'CIA', 'know', 'even', 'suspect', 'would', 'lead', 'establishment', 'particular', 'type', 'Islamic', 'Republic', 'led', 'Taliban', 'human', 'level', 'clear', 'level', 'interest', 'ordinary', 'Afghan', 'women', 'beauty', 'makeup', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'interested', 'must', 'bow', 'wishes', 'husbands', 'families', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'approve', 'use', 'make', 'up', 'different', 'hair', 'styles', 'not', 'wishing', 'tread', 'footsteps', 'feminists', 'here', 'one', 'believe', 'inalienable', 'right', 'person', 'have', 'self-determination.This', 'little', 'film', 'deserves', 'much', 'wider', 'attention', 'received', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'everyone']",The Beauty Academy of Kabul
