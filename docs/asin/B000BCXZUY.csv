The movements are definitely choreographed for the lower body, and you can add your own flair to the routines.  Definitely very effective when you ""squeeze"" when you are supposed to.The three 12 minute add ons are great as well - very focused.

940538,A2U2ZPHR54XLSS,B000BCXZUY,DJ,"[19, 20]","The DVD is basically broken down into three sections; 1) dance-style cardio, 2) standing ballet work, and 3) floor pilates and yoga work.  I don't normally like ""dancey"" stuff as I'm not all that coordinated, but Lisa Wheeler breaks down the steps and builds on them, so I know I'll get it eventually.  One student, Sam, shows modified versions of the steps, and each student makes the workout her own by adding some individual flair, which encourages me to add my own little spice (I love Sam's shoulder shimmies, wish I could do 'em!)  The ballet section doesn't do much for me, but the pilates/yoga section really works my legs.  Over all, this workout is a lot of fun!",5,Like a dance party,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,672,"['DVD', 'basically', 'broken', 'down', 'three', 'sections', '1', 'dance-style', 'cardio', '2', 'standing', 'ballet', 'work', '3', 'floor', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'dancey', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'not', 'coordinated', 'Lisa', 'Wheeler', 'down', 'steps', 'builds', 'so', 'know', ""'ll"", 'get', 'eventually', 'One', 'student', 'Sam', 'modified', 'versions', 'steps', 'student', 'workout', 'own', 'adding', 'individual', 'flair', 'add', 'own', 'little', 'spice', 'love', 'Sam', 'shoulder', 'shimmies', 'wish', 'could', 'do', 'ballet', 'section', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'pilates/yoga', 'section', 'really', 'legs', 'workout', 'lot', 'fun']","Shape Your Butt, Hips and Thighs"

Done a couple of times a week along with their cardio workout and you'll be in shape in no time.  This killed the first couple of times, but now it's getting better and I am seeing results.  I love the set, the music and the instructor is great.  It's motivating and challenging, but worth the effort.  Get this if you want a tighter butt and if you want your thighs a little leaner.

940541,A3O930D1JAQEKV,B000BCXZUY,ReaderInChicago,"[26, 27]","There are four workouts on this DVD.  One is a ballet-type lower body, one is yoga/pilates inspired lower body, a 12 minute full body weight workout and a cardio work-out.  I loved the two lower body and the full body weight workouts.  I like the short duration of each.  I almost never do shorter workouts in isolation.  I like doing them together and the short segments mix it up a bit.  I've been having a hard time finding DVDs that focus on the lower body and this has a lot of different exercises and it definitely worked up a sweat.  Jury's out still on whether it produces good results.  I'm suspecting it will.What I didn't like was the cardio.  This is based on MY personal preferences however.  It is a dance-style cardio workout.  I don't like these because I find them too difficult to follow.  I've never been into dance-style cardio at the gym or at home.  But if you like that kind of workout, you might like this one.  I just find it difficult so I end up not watching and just doing what I want along to the beat and listen to the talk-along as if it was referencing what I am actually doing!I would definitely recommend this DVD though for the two lower body and the bonus 12 minute full body weight workout.  It'll get a lot of use even if I don't ever use the cardio portion.",4,like everything except the cardio,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,1296,"['are', 'four', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'One', 'ballet-type', 'lower', 'body', 'one', 'yoga/pilates', 'inspired', 'lower', 'body', '12', 'minute', 'full', 'body', 'weight', 'workout', 'cardio', 'work-out', 'loved', 'two', 'lower', 'body', 'full', 'body', 'weight', 'workouts', 'short', 'duration', 'almost', 'never', 'do', 'shorter', 'workouts', 'isolation', 'doing', 'together', 'short', 'segments', 'mix', 'up', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'finding', 'DVDs', 'lower', 'body', 'lot', 'different', 'exercises', 'definitely', 'worked', 'up', 'sweat', 'Jury', 'out', 'still', 'good', 'results', ""'m"", 'suspecting', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'cardio', 'based', 'MY', 'personal', 'preferences', 'however', 'dance-style', 'cardio', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'find', 'too', 'difficult', 'follow', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'dance-style', 'cardio', 'gym', 'home', 'like', 'kind', 'workout', 'might', 'like', 'one', 'just', 'find', 'difficult', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'watching', 'just', 'doing', 'what', 'want', 'beat', 'listen', 'talk-along', 'was', 'referencing', 'what', 'am', 'actually', 'doing', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'two', 'lower', 'body', 'bonus', '12', 'minute', 'full', 'body', 'weight', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'use', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'use', 'cardio', 'portion']","Shape Your Butt, Hips and Thighs"
