It is not only about extraordinary activist and film archivist Vito Russo, but about gay history. The archival film footage is amazing. I was stunned to see that there were problems amongst the gay community as early as 1973 (drag queens, lesbians, gay men at odds with each other). I didn't know that. I thought that all began in my generation (late 80's early 90's). Clips of Bette Midler can be seen that I have also never seen before.The vintage cinematic clips (1890's till about 1970) are something to be cherished. A few seen herein are not seen in The Celluloid Closet DVD. We are so lucky Russo sought these things out and preserved them.He seemed like a very exceptional person. As of 2013 we have NO ONE like him. Gay people have become extremely passive and complacent and we are losing gay neighborhoods yearly. Ken and Barbie types, as well as hipsters, are gentrifying us back into obscurity. So while this DVD made me extremely proud, there is a certain melancholy that comes with it, because the days of real activism and pride are gone.",5,Everyone Should Have This in their DVD Library,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1108,"['first', 'saw', 'cable', 'then', 'later', 'bought', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'extraordinary', 'activist', 'film', 'archivist', 'Vito', 'Russo', 'gay', 'history', 'archival', 'film', 'footage', 'amazing', 'was', 'stunned', 'see', 'were', 'problems', 'amongst', 'gay', 'community', 'as', 'early', '1973', 'drag', 'queens', 'lesbians', 'gay', 'men', 'odds', 'other', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'thought', 'began', 'generation', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'Clips', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'have', 'also', 'never', 'seen', 'before.The', 'vintage', 'cinematic', 'clips', '1890', 'till', '1970', 'are', 'something', 'be', 'cherished', 'few', 'seen', 'herein', 'are', 'not', 'seen', 'Celluloid', 'Closet', 'DVD', 'are', 'so', 'lucky', 'Russo', 'sought', 'things', 'out', 'preserved', 'them.He', 'seemed', 'very', 'exceptional', 'person', '2013', 'have', 'ONE', 'Gay', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'extremely', 'passive', 'complacent', 'are', 'losing', 'gay', 'neighborhoods', 'yearly', 'Ken', 'Barbie', 'types', 'as', 'well', 'hipsters', 'are', 'gentrifying', 'back', 'obscurity', 'So', 'DVD', 'made', 'extremely', 'proud', 'certain', 'melancholy', 'days', 'real', 'activism', 'pride', 'are', 'gone']",Vito

1606067,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00A6GZV7K,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[13, 13]","VITO (HBO films, 105 minutes) is a stunning documentary about a great man in the gay rights movement - a man with whom I was completely unfamiliar. Vito Russo, a name I had certainly seen in my time, author ofThe Celluloid Closetand an important handful of other books, was a major pioneer in our equal rights struggle of the latter 20th century.This excellent documentary helped me to understand Vito as a scholar, perhaps the only scholar, who decided to tackle America's history of homophobia - which is the backbone of CELLULOID CLOSET and Vito's other books (such as his photography in COMMON THREADS: STORIES FROM THE QUILT, 1989). Like me, he was a scholar, a very involved film lover, critic and most importantly, film fan. His explosive appearance on ""20/20"" in May, 1982, changed America.At the Gay Alliance's famous Firehouse in New York, Vito instigated film night - whereby the entire audience was one huge gay family enjoying a film together. Through this he developed his initial ideas for CLOSET - as a film curator with MOMA, Vito had seen gay characters commonly in film up til the 1930s when the censorship began. Thus in film there were 'hinted-at' gay characters, and Vito made a point to show what happened to them at the end of the film (they died violently or were murdered). From all that, Vito perfected a lecture which eventually became the book.Thus Vito gave the gay community its very sense of being a community. With friends like Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler, he united the entire Gay Family (as I call it); with his parents and Midler he introduced the concept of the Gay Ally, which few people wanted at the time. Vito said we often think something that is going to take 10 years takes 100. He helped shave a lot of decades off that.This history, of the way Vito took all his personal qualities and transformed them into movements for social change, was something I was ashamed I hadn't really known before. Being a pillar of the early Gay Alliance (as we called it) which sort of morphed into GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), which I came to take for granted during its short years of existence, made Vito the ultimate hero in my eyes along with his writings. He even developed and hosted his own all-gay TV talk/news segment, ""Our Time"", in 1983.The Gay Alliance is the template for all the later alliances, and Vito was the key element in bringing about movements like ACT UP and QUEER NATION. His talk show foreshadowed MSNBC. Even more importantly, Vito was instrumental in keeping the gay liberation movement from self-destructing, by throwing himself in the middle of the frequent fights that erupted between gay men, women, transvestites and even transgendered people. The 1970s could get ugly.Vito would shout at a crowd, ""LISTEN TO HER!!"" whenever an angry lesbian had something to say and the crowd didn't want to hear it. He made allowances for drag queens (at the time there was a drag queen alliance working through its own troubles) to speak at public protests, where drag queens were in fact not welcome. Vito made them welcome. Finally, Vito ushered in straight allies by embracing anyone who would embrace him. As one friend of his says, Vito changed the current of the Movement. Everyone should know how difficult that is to accomplish. But Vito Russo did it.This fabulous documentary, which interviews everyone from Armistead Maupin to Larry Kramer to Lily Tomlin, is an eye-opener in many ways. It is just the right dose of biography, allows Vito to speak for himself since he was filmed and interviewed so often, and is perhaps one of the most important pieces of gay history scholarship. Vito is also able to speak to us, briefly, through his TV segment. Perhaps most importantly, it defines how Vito Russo taught us to be gay historians in the first place and therefore to love, to accept, ourselves.Sometime before Vito's departure from us in November, 1990, he gave an interview which was prophetic, according to Larry Kramer. In the interview, Russo said that in 15 or 20 years, gay people would begin to experience equality under the law and in society. He further prophesied that there would be a huge improvement in AIDS treatment and a president who would stand firmly for gay rights - which after all are really everyone's rights.On every count, Russo was accurate. What a mind!And to think I never really knew who Vito Russo was - until now. We cannot afford to miss this wonderful film (I almost did), but I offer a word of caution: the names/job titles of the guests move far too rapidly to read accurately. Keep your finger over your DVD player's PAUSE button to get the complete skinny. Once you've done all that, Vito will surely move you as he moved me.",5,Vito - one need say no more,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,4743,"['VITO', 'HBO', 'films', '105', 'minutes', 'stunning',
