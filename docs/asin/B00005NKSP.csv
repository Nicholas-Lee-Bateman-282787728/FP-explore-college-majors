As an attorney ""Stormy Weathers"" he can't be beat. He will stretch the limits of courtroon etiquette well past the limit if it will win his case. This is by far one of the best melodramas I have seen. Not often do we see a movie full of comedy and drama at the same time.The beginning is very light stuff, but midway into the movie we start to see the darkside of humanity. John Hurt turns in a magnificent performance as Judd's client in a murder case. Judd can't decide if his client is innocent or guilty, but once he knows for sure he has to learn new tactics in dealing with the judicial system.Fans of courtroom movies should enjoy this even if they are not fans of the 80s bratpack. Great directing and excellent cast make this a winner. A nice soundtrack and scenes in Boston don't hurt either.

669202,A3PTOYW3XDY0ID,B00005NKSP,feedthecat,"[0, 0]","First saw FROM THE HIP back in 1988 (it was released a year earlier in theatres) or so off a Canadian ""premium channel"" (First Choice) and liked it so much that I scanned the cable listings to find out when it wd be next aired, and then recorded it ""off air"".  Over the next year or so, I watched it a few more times, but, after a move, misplaced that VHS tape and pretty much forgot all about this flick (now that I think of it, there must have been some reason why it never aired on ""free"" tv - at least not while I was watching).Twenty plus years later, while looking for a dvd on kijiji, saw that someone had one of these dvds for sale and, of course, I promptly went to Amazon (Canada) and ordered one.  While the extras are nonexistent and the picture is widescreen with no option for fullscreen (why is a legal dramedy in widescreen, anyway?), the dvd was worth it becuz it reminded me why I enjoyed this Judd Nelson ""vehicle"" so much in the first place.Since other reviewers have already gone into the plot I'll just note that one of the things that made FROM THE HIP so interesting was the casting of stellar supporting actors, many of whom are well known to tv and movies viewers, even if few of them  played a lead role in anything, actors such as Edward Winter and Alan Arbus (""Colonel Flagg"" and ""Sydney Freedman"", respectively, from M*A*S*H), Ray Walston (""Mr. Hand"" from FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH), Darren McGavin (KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER and several good X-FILES eps), Nancy Marchand (LOU GRANT and THE NAKED GUN series), and Beatrice Winde (can't remember any ""big roles"", but have seen her in a couple LAW & ORDER eps).  Since many of them have, unfortunately, passed on since this film was made, it's nice to see them at the top of their games in HIP.And, while some antics/scenes are quite over the top in this young-lawyer-trying-to-make-a-name-for-himself story, the screenplay, on the whole, is a good one.  Never bothered to catch who wrote FROM THE HIP when I first saw this one, but the name David E. Kelley leapt out from the screen this time around and, if memory serves, he's the person behind ALLY McBEAL, so those of you who are sitting on the fence about buying this dvd but are Kelley fans will prob like this one ('tho, to be sure, there aren't any stick figured women in HIP and the lead isn't neurotic).All in all, a solid four star movie ('tho a 3 star dvd).
