1643387,A12DQZKRKTNF5E,B00C7BZZ32,Andrea Polk,"[1, 1]","Touching upon the teenage angst we've all felt while living with our parents, and the frustrations parents feel while living with teenagers, The Kings Of Summer is a movie that my 15 year old daughter and I truly enjoyed.Best friends run away from home, to live in the woods.  To become men. Joined by a third-wheel who they never quite figure out, but who they accept just the same, these teenage boys are frustrated with their parents and are actively rejecting their authority by secretly building a house in the nearby forest.  Their initial sense of joyful relief, their emotional growth as they learn to figure things out on their own, and the girl who tug deeply at one boy's heartstrings, are all elements of a story that flow easily into a semi-dramatic, satisfying conclusion.We laughed a lot watching this film, perhaps recognizing ourselves in the characters.  It is a drama, but one with a strong sense of the ridiculousness of life and the characters we are, as well as the ones we meet along the way.I recommend this movie.  It's quirky, but the characters are real, the story is good, as is the acting. It's a movie that doesn't have sex or violence, but it does have a message that I  think both adults and teens can appreciate and learn from in the end.",4,Enjoyable family movie,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,1271,"['Touching', 'teenage', 'angst', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'living', 'parents', 'frustrations', 'parents', 'feel', 'living', 'teenagers', 'Kings', 'Summer', 'movie', '15', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'truly', 'enjoyed.Best', 'friends', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'live', 'woods', 'become', 'men', 'Joined', 'third-wheel', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'accept', 'just', 'same', 'teenage', 'boys', 'are', 'frustrated', 'parents', 'are', 'actively', 'rejecting', 'authority', 'secretly', 'building', 'house', 'nearby', 'forest', 'initial', 'sense', 'joyful', 'relief', 'emotional', 'growth', 'learn', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'own', 'girl', 'who', 'deeply', 'one', 'boy', 'heartstrings', 'are', 'elements', 'story', 'flow', 'easily', 'semi-dramatic', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.We', 'laughed', 'lot', 'watching', 'film', 'perhaps', 'recognizing', 'characters', 'drama', 'one', 'strong', 'sense', 'ridiculousness', 'life', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'ones', 'meet', 'way.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'quirky', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'violence', 'have', 'message', 'think', 'adults', 'teens', 'can', 'appreciate', 'learn', 'end']",The Kings of Summer
1643388,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00C7BZZ32,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","I think I&#8217;ve come to the realization that you just cannot be cool anymore unless you watch TV, and I mean regularly.  I never watch anything on television that doesn&#8217;t involve some sort of competition or isn&#8217;t some syndicated rerun of a show that was around when I was a teenager.  I don&#8217;t really know why, but maybe it has to do with the fact that there are only so many hours in a day and only so much time I have allotted for &#8216;in front of the TV&#8217; and so I either watch brainless stuff I can veg out to while I&#8217;m awaiting sleep to overtake me, or I watch a movie.  Still, with myself FINALLY getting on Twitter, I have come to see that everyone I follow is constantly &#8216;tweeting&#8217; about this show and that show and this actor in that show that I don&#8217;t watch and thus have no idea who they are, and I feel so constantly out of the loop.What does that have to do with this review?Well, I had no idea who Nick Offerman was until I saw &#8216;We&#8217;re the Millers&#8217; a few months ago, and then seeing him here and hearing all the &#8220;OMG we love him&#8221; come from everyone who has seen this or who I&#8217;ve talked to about this made me realize that if I don&#8217;t start watching TV soon I&#8217;m not going to know who anyone is anymore.  I mean, this cast is made up almost entirely of television actors.Nick Robinson&#8230;&#8216;Melissa & Joey&#8217;Gabriel Basso&#8230;&#8216;The Big C&#8217;Moises Arias&#8230;&#8216;Hannah Montana&#8217; and recently &#8216;The Middle&#8217;Nick Offerman&#8230;&#8216;Parks and Recreation&#8217;Erin  Moriarty&#8230;&#8216;One Life to Live&#8217;, &#8216;Red Widow&#8217; and now &#8216;True Detective&#8217;And we all know who Megan Mullally is.Seriously, I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit this, but I&#8217;ve seen NONE of these shows and knew who NONE of these people were, outside of Mullally, and that&#8217;s because I watch SYNDICATED &#8216;Will and Grace&#8217;.I&#8217;m so out of touch.So, maybe it is because of this un-coolness that I have, but I didn&#8217;t fall head over heels for this like I had thought I was going to.  I liked it enough, but it all felt so very sitcom to me, and not in a good way.  It also felt so utterly underdeveloped, and while I liked the concept to a certain extent and I thought that Offerman was pretty fantastic, the character development here felt so clich&eacute; and the actual build of the plot felt so skeletal.  It didn&#8217;t help that the characters all felt so displaced, like none of them belonged in the real world, and the character of Colin was borderline &#8216;Sid from &#8216;The Descendants&#8217; territory&#8217;, to the point where I really wanted George Clooney to pop out of nowhere and punch him in the face, and I never want George Clooney to pop out of anywhere.Oh wait, that was Robert Forster.  I like him.  He should have popped up in this movie.Anyways, back to the point.  &#8216;The Kings of Summer&#8217; tells the story of misunderstood teens (go figure) who are fed up with their misunderstanding parents (go figure) who decide that they would be better off alone (go figure).  They decide to build a house in the woods where no one can find them and basically disappear (yay, original idea) but then things get murky and complicated when they both fall for the same girl (go figure) and she chooses the one that is not the chief protagonist (go figure).  Things fall apart, friendships are skewed and eventually the protagonists father turns out to be a pretty great guy and amends are made (go figure).But getting there was so&#8230;hollow.I wanted more meat.  Instead we are given random shots of enjoyment and yet nothing to really build on, nothing to really make it all mesh together.  I think the focus on other things, like the girls and the parents, took away from what they really SHOULD have been developing, which was the friendship, comradery and innocence of the boys.I mean, I love this concept despite the fact that I made fun of all the clich&eacute;d aspects, but there was no character development outside of the obvious.  It felt like ideas strung along with no real development.  The fact that I saw this just a week ago and honestly kept forgetting what movie it was that I watched is not a good sign.But Offerman is pretty hilarious and honestly feels grounded, even if his delivery felt somewhat displaced from the film itself.  His arc (which isn&#8217;t really an arc since he was there the whole time and the only person who couldn&#8217;t see it was his son) is the nicest in the film, even if it is a walking clich&eacute;.",3,Maybe I&#8217;m just too uncool&#8230;,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,4644,"['think', '8217', 'come', 'realization', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'cool', 'anymore', 'watch', 'TV', 'mean', 'regularly', 'never', 'watch', 'anything', 'television', '8217', 'involve', 'sort', 'competition', 'isn', '8217', 'syndicated', 'rerun', 'show', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'don', '8217', 'really', 'know', 'why', 'maybe', 'do', 'fact', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'hours', 'day', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'allotted', '8216', 'front', 'TV', '8217', 'so', 'either', 'watch', 'brainless', 'stuff', 'can', 'veg', 'out', '8217', 'awaiting', 'sleep', 'overtake', 'watch', 'movie', 'Still', 'FINALLY', 'getting', 'Twitter', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'everyone', 'follow', 'constantly', '8216', 'tweeting', '8217', 'show', 'show', 'actor', 'show', 'don', '8217', 'watch', 'thus', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'are', 'feel', 'so', 'constantly', 'loop.What', 'have', 'do', 'review', 'Well', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'was', 'saw', '8216', '8217', 're', 'Millers', '8217', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'then', 'seeing', 'here', 'hearing', '8220', 'OMG', 'love', '8221', 'come', 'everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'who', '8217', 've', 'talked', 'made', 'realize', 'don', '8217', 't', 'start', 'watching', 'TV', 'soon', '8217', 'not', 'going', 'know', 'who', 'anyone', 'anymore', 'mean', 'cast', 'made', 'up', 'almost', 'entirely', 'television', 'Robinson', '8230', '8216', 'Melissa', 'Joey', '8217', 'Gabriel', 'Basso', '8230', '8216', 'Big', 'C', '8217', 'Moises', 'Arias', '8230', '8216', 'Hannah', 'Montana', '8217', 'recently', '8216', 'Middle', '8217', 'Nick', 'Offerman', '8230', '8216', 'Parks', 'Recreation', '8217', 'Erin', 'Moriarty', '8230', '8216', 'One', 'Life', 'Live', '8217', '8216', 'Red', 'Widow', '8217', 'now', '8216', 'True', 'Detective', '8217', 'know', 'who', 'Megan', 'Mullally', 'is.Seriously', '8217', 'm', 'embarrassed', 'admit', '8217', 'seen', 'NONE', 'shows', 'knew', 'who', 'NONE', 'people', 'were', 'Mullally', '8217', 'watch', 'SYNDICATED', '8216', 'Will', 'Grace', '8217', '.I', '8217', 'so', 'touch.So', 'maybe', 'un-coolness', 'have', 'didn', '8217', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'like', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'liked', 'enough', 'felt', 'so', 'very', 'sitcom', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'also', 'felt', 'so', 'utterly', 'underdeveloped', 'liked', 'concept', 'certain', 'extent', 'thought', 'Offerman', 'was', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'felt', 'so', 'clich', 'eacute', 'actual', 'build', 'plot', 'felt', 'so', 'skeletal', '8217', 'help', 'characters', 'felt', 'so', 'displaced', 'none', 'belonged', 'real', 'world', 'character', 'Colin', 'was', 'borderline', '8216', 'Sid', '8216', 'Descendants', '8217', 'territory', '8217', 'point', 'where', 'really', 'wanted', 'George', 'Clooney', 'pop', 'nowhere', 'punch', 'face', 'never', 'want', 'George', 'Clooney', 'pop', 'anywhere.Oh', 'wait', 'was', 'Robert', 'Forster', 'should', 'have', 'popped', 'up', 'movie.Anyways', 'back', 'point', '8216', 'Kings', 'Summer', '8217', 'story', 'misunderstood', 'teens', 'go', 'figure', 'who', 'are', 'fed', 'up', 'misunderstanding', 'parents', 'go', 'figure', 'who', 'decide', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'alone', 'go', 'figure', 'decide', 'build', 'house', 'woods', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'basically', 'disappear', 'yay', 'original', 'idea', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'murky', 'complicated', 'when', 'fall', 'same', 'girl', 'go', 'figure', 'one', 'not', 'chief', 'protagonist', 'go', 'figure', 'Things', 'fall', 'apart', 'friendships', 'are', 'skewed', 'eventually', 'protagonists', 'father', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'great', 'guy', 'amends', 'are', 'made', 'go', 'figure', 'getting', 'was', 'so', '8230', 'wanted', 'more', 'meat', 'Instead', 'are', 'given', 'random', 'shots', 'enjoyment', 'yet', 'nothing', 'really', 'build', 'nothing', 'really', 'make', 'mesh', 'together', 'think', 'focus', 'other', 'things', 'girls', 'parents', 'took', 'away', 'what', 'really', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'developing', 'was', 'friendship', 'comradery', 'innocence', 'boys.I', 'mean', 'love', 'concept', 'fact', 'made', 'fun', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'aspects', 'was', 'character', 'development', 'obvious', 'felt', 'ideas', 'strung', 'real', 'development', 'fact', 'saw', 'just', 'week', 'ago', 'honestly', 'kept', 'forgetting', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'watched', 'not', 'good', 'sign.But', 'Offerman', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'honestly', 'feels', 'grounded', 'even', 'delivery', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'displaced', 'film', 'arc', 'isn', '8217', 'really', 'arc', 'was', 'there', 'whole', 'time', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'couldn', '8217', 'see', 'was', 'son', 'nicest', 'film', 'even', 'walking', 'clich', 'eacute']",The Kings of Summer

The heart of the plot is dramatic: several young boys, annoyed with their families, run away from home to be independent only to find their goals thwarted by a painfully formulaic love triangle. However, the cast is weighted with heavy comedic talent (everyone from Nick Offerman to Hannibal Burress makes an appearance, including a few lesser known names from multiple sketch shows and comedy troops). There's a whole lot of silliness going on, especially in the character of Bellagio (that's probably not how you spell his name; he's one of our runaways, the weirdest and least grounded in reality of the three boys), which makes the movie feel like it's going for a nonsensical level of humor. The two halves aren't so bad, but mixed together, they tend to come across as uneven.In spite of the fairly predictable plot points, the movie's glut of musical montages, and its occasional leaps of logic (three boys -- by all accounts unskilled in shop class -- manage to build a house in the woods in what appears to be two days), the movie is warmhearted and just nutty and tender enough to avoid backsliding into pure nonsense (either of the dramatic or humorous variety). While it's not nearly the coming of age tale it is marketing itself to be, it's definitely entertaining as long as you put a fair-sized chunk of your disbelief aside and focus most of your attention on the film's continuous stabs at goofiness.

Joe's dad (Nick Offerman) is a wisecracking, insensitive ""s.o.b."".  Patrick's folks (Megan Mullally, Marc Evan Jackson) are on the ""creepy"" side, and, except for one brief scene, we don't really meet Biaggio's parents, but he's a bit ""weird,"" so that should tell us something.The truth is that, from a teenager's standpoint, all parents are insensitive, creepy and/or weird.In an ultimate act of independence, the three boys decide to spend their summer building a ramshackle house in the woods and living off the land.  The house goes up amazingly fast, and while the parents and the police (led by Mary Lynn Rajskub) search for them, the teens have a great time.  The adventure, however, turns south when Kelly (Erin Moriarty), enters the boys' domain...and jealously rears its ugly head.With a sharp eye for the beauty of nature, Jordan Vogt-Roberts directed Chris Galletta's well-written  screenplay.

1643412,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C7BZZ32,Paul Allaer,"[4, 7]","""The Kings of Summer"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of two best friends, Joe and Patrick, both 15 and just having finished their HS freshman year. Joe's dad is heavy-heanded (""my house, my rules!"") and Patrick's parents are outright bizzare. Joe hatches a plan to build a cottage out in the woods over the summer. They are joined a strange kid, Biaggio, who works himself up to be a great (and funny) sidekick. As the boys are working on building the shack, they are equally enjoying being out in the woods or daydraming when they feel like it. Once the cottage has been built, they invite some achool friends over, including beautiful Kelly (played by up-and-coming Erin Moriarty). Joe is smitten by her, but she seems to be attracted more to Patrick. At this point we are about half-way into the movie and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: a few months ago we had a fantastic coming-of-age movie called ""Mud"", and now this movie. It is hard to truly compare the two, as ""The Kings of Summer"" is a very different kind of ""coming of age"" movie, with the boys being 4-5 years older than in ""Mud"". Here, the themes are more directed towards the tensions with the parents on the one hand, and surrounding the girl on the other hand. Stylistically, the movie is a curious mix of a number of genres, some scenes being almost sitcom-like, others reminding of magic-realism (lots of late afternoon orange sunlight) and of nature-adventure (lots of shots of animals in the woods), yet other scenes building suspense on the outcome of it all. Somehow it works. The fact that this is a fairly short movie works to its advantage as this zips by in no time. Kudos also to Ryan Miller for scoring that nice soundtrack. I would be remiss not to mention that this movie was filmed entirely in Ohio (where I am). Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts makes it look beautiful!This movie was well received at the 2013 Sundance film festival (where it was shown as ""Toy's House""). The movie opened today here at my local art-house theatre in Cincinnati, but regretfully the screening I attended was not well attended. I hope that is not a sign of things to come. Regardless, ""The Kings of Summer"" is a different kind of coming-of-age movie that is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD.",4,"Different kind of ""coming of age"" movie",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2389,"['Kings', 'Summer', '2013', 'release', '93', 'min', 'story', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Joe', 'Patrick', '15', 'just', 'having', 'finished', 'HS', 'freshman', 'year', 'Joe', 'dad', 'heavy-heanded', 'house', 'rules', 'Patrick', 'parents', 'are', 'outright', 'bizzare', 'Joe', 'plan', 'build', 'cottage', 'out', 'woods', 'summer', 'are', 'joined', 'strange', 'kid', 'Biaggio', 'who', 'up', 'be', 'great', 'funny', 'sidekick', 'boys', 'are', 'working', 'building', 'shack', 'are', 'equally', 'enjoying', 'being', 'out', 'woods', 'daydraming', 'when', 'feel', 'cottage', 'been', 'built', 'invite', 'achool', 'friends', 'including', 'beautiful', 'Kelly', 'played', 'up-and-coming', 'Erin', 'Moriarty', 'Joe', 'smitten', 'be', 'attracted', 'more', 'Patrick', 'point', 'are', 'half-way', 'movie', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Several', 'comments', 'few', 'months', 'had', 'fantastic', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'called', 'Mud', 'now', 'movie', 'hard', 'truly', 'compare', 'two', 'Kings', 'Summer', 'very', 'different', 'kind', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'boys', 'being', '4-5', 'years', 'older', 'Mud', 'Here', 'themes', 'are', 'more', 'directed', 'tensions', 'parents', 'one', 'hand', 'surrounding', 'girl', 'other', 'hand', 'Stylistically', 'movie', 'curious', 'mix', 'number', 'genres', 'scenes', 'being', 'almost', 'sitcom-like', 'others', 'reminding', 'magic-realism', 'lots', 'late', 'afternoon', 'orange', 'sunlight', 'nature-adventure', 'lots', 'shots', 'animals', 'woods', 'yet', 'other', 'scenes', 'building', 'suspense', 'outcome', 'Somehow', 'fact', 'fairly', 'short', 'movie', 'advantage', 'zips', 'time', 'Kudos', 'also', 'Ryan', 'Miller', 'scoring', 'nice', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'not', 'mention', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'Ohio', 'where', 'am', 'Director', 'Jordan', 'Vogt-Roberts', 'look', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'received', '2013', 'Sundance', 'film', 'festival', 'where', 'was', 'shown', 'Toy', 'House', 'movie', 'opened', 'today', 'here', 'local', 'art-house', 'theatre', 'Cincinnati', 'regretfully', 'screening', 'attended', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'attended', 'hope', 'not', 'sign', 'things', 'come', 'Regardless', 'Kings', 'Summer', 'different', 'kind', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'checking', 'out', 'be', 'theatre', 'DVD']",The Kings of Summer
1643413,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00C7BZZ32,RMurray847,"[5, 13]","One of the best movies of 2013 so far has been the coming-of-age drama MUD.  And now, during a summer blockbuster season, another coming-of-age drama/comedy has arrived.  THE KINGS OF SUMMER had a very enticing trailer, making it look like a good-natured story of three boys who run away from home to live in the nearby forest in a house of their own construction.  It features funny actors such as Nick Offerman and Megan Mullaly.  (Yes, I know they are husband and wife in real life.)The movie ended up being more (and less) than what I expected.  It is a far darker, more serious exploration of the family lives of these boys, particularly Joe (Nick Robinson) who lives with his recently widowed father (Offerman) a bitter, sarcastic man who is gruff almost to the point of abuse on his teen son.  The two are ""dealing"" with their loss by lashing out at each other, and Joe finally has enough and decides to move out.  He encourages his friend Patrick (Gabriel Basso) to join him.  Patrick has very overbearing parents who are experts at embarrassing him.  These two old friends are joined by the VERY odd Biaggio (Moises Arias), a bit of an outcast who simply clings to these two and becomes part of their lives.The movie constantly struggles with tone.  It clearly wants to be full of lighthearted moments...gentle humor and ironic observations about how kids and parents often don't see eye-to-eye.  Yet the relationship between Joe and his dad is so caustic that we are much more likely to cringe than chuckle or smile.  The actors play everything straight, which is what they SHOULD do, but the script makes it tough to balance the comedy and drama.  The two want to exist at the same time, but the drama smothers that comedy.  There certainly are laughs in the film, particularly around the odd (and highly unbelievable) Biaggio.In fact, much of the film just felt false.  Biaggio is a quirky kid, no doubt with some deep mental challenges.  But his strange utterances are mostly funny...but in a way that makes you realize this character could not exist in the real world.  He is a comic construction.  That's fine...except the film clearly intends to be ""realistic.""  Also, Joe's dad is, I'm sure, meant to be a character for whom we feel some sympathy.  A nice, gruff dad who is rattled to the core by his wife's death.  But he is SO mean to everyone around him that it's hard not to hate him.  He just doesn't feel well thought out.  It's possible a guy like this exists...but he just feels wrong.I liked individual scenes in the film, and I enjoyed many of the performances.  It has plenty to recommend it.  But the screenplay (and by extension the direction) clearly aspires to more meaning than is actually contained therein.  Coming-of-age films have hard-won lessons, tears, laughter and a sense of relief and of character maturing.  This film checks all those boxes, but clumsily.  And of course these kinds of films need to have some sort of romance as well.  Yet the female character in this film is made to behave in ways towards the 2nd half that betray her behavior in the first half.  Instead of a sweetness, an innocence, KINGS OF SUMMER is more bitter and angry.Don't get me wrong...I don't need my movies to be sweet and gentle and happy.  But when the film is harsh and bitter even though you can tell it WANTS to be sweet and gentle...that's a problem.  So while I marginally recommend KINGS OF SUMMER, I can't also help feeling very let down by it.",3,"3.5 stars.

1643420,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B00C7BZZ32,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[0, 0]","""The Kings of Summer"" from director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts, uses a tried and tested teenage coming-of-age storyline with only one place to go, taking the obvious route to get to it. It therefore throws up few surprises along the way. What carries the movie and makes it something more than it might otherwise have been are the outstanding performances from the younger cast members, together with a series of magical inter-scene episodes which lighten and illuminate the tale's telling, enhanced by superb cinematography and an excellent soundtrack.The film has more that its fair share of kludgy moments too but while these prevent it from running as smoothly as it might, they don't detract too badly from the underlying feel-good factor that the film tries to convey.  That said, whilst most of the screenplay is gentle, things do at times take an uncomfortable turn, in a way that some of the cast seemed unable to really handle, resulting in a certain degree of over-playing the drama's main crisis points. I wondered at times how some scenes had made it through the editing phase. There seem to have been some odd casting decisions made at times, too, with some of the cast wasted in their roles (most notably Mary Lynn Rajskub in a role that amounts to little more than a bit part), while others such as Nick Offerman (Frank) seem out of their depth in major parts.  Happily, the principals -- Nick Robinson (Joe), Gabriel Basso (Patrick), Moises Arias (Biaggio) and love interest, Erin Moriarty (Kelly), are all excellent.In summary, then, although it offers something of a bumpy roller-coaster ride, often straying from the believable and constantly over-stating things to some extent, the film is nevertheless entertaining pretty much throughout. While much of the dialogue may limp along, the visuals are often stunning; all in all, well worth a watch.",4,Coming of age isn't always pretty,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1861,"['Kings', 'Summer', 'director', 'Jordan', 'Vogt-Roberts', 'tried', 'tested', 'teenage', 'coming-of-age', 'storyline', 'only', 'one', 'place', 'go', 'taking', 'obvious', 'route', 'get', 'therefore', 'up', 'few', 'surprises', 'way', 'What', 'movie', 'something', 'more', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'younger', 'cast', 'members', 'together', 'series', 'magical', 'inter-scene', 'episodes', 'lighten', 'illuminate', 'tale', 'telling', 'enhanced', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'soundtrack.The', 'film', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'kludgy', 'moments', 'too', 'prevent', 'running', 'as', 'smoothly', 'might', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'badly', 'underlying', 'feel-good', 'factor', 'film', 'tries', 'convey', 'said', 'whilst', 'most', 'screenplay', 'gentle', 'things', 'do', 'times', 'take', 'uncomfortable', 'turn', 'way', 'cast', 'seemed', 'unable', 'really', 'handle', 'resulting', 'certain', 'degree', 'over-playing', 'drama', 'main', 'crisis', 'points', 'wondered', 'times', 'how', 'scenes', 'had', 'made', 'editing', 'phase', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'odd', 'casting', 'decisions', 'made', 'times', 'too', 'cast', 'wasted', 'roles', 'most', 'notably', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'role', 'little', 'more', 'bit', 'part', 'others', 'such', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'Frank', 'seem', 'depth', 'major', 'parts', 'Happily', 'principals', 'Nick', 'Robinson', 'Joe', 'Gabriel', 'Basso', 'Patrick', 'Moises', 'Arias', 'Biaggio', 'love', 'interest', 'Erin', 'Moriarty', 'Kelly', 'are', 'excellent.In', 'summary', 'then', 'something', 'bumpy', 'roller-coaster', 'ride', 'often', 'straying', 'believable', 'constantly', 'over-stating', 'things', 'extent', 'film', 'nevertheless', 'entertaining', 'pretty', 'much', 'much', 'dialogue', 'may', 'limp', 'along', 'visuals', 'are', 'often', 'stunning', 'well', 'watch']",The Kings of Summer
