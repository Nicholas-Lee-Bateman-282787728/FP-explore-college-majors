853434,AVEUT0KMTZOEG,B0002ZIVYK,Individualist,"[6, 11]","Herb Myers identifies several threats to Western Civilization. He defines our civilization by separation of church and state, and individual and economic freedom.Threats are both external and internal. Currently the major external threat is radical Islam, which believes it has the sanction of God to destroy us, and by doing so they will win paradise.Internally, our civilization is threatened because what western civilization is, and how it came about, is not taught in schools.Second, A new ideology has appeared that places power in the State, rather than the in the people who delegate power to government. With the new ideology, the rule of law is being overturned.Third, western countries and Japan are having so few children they are not replacing their populations. In Europe, the people gap means immigrants from Islamic countries, who have no concept of western values, are coming, but not integrating into society. Also, countries are becoming more populated by aging people who do not work, putting an increasing pressure on younger workers for support.Fourth, he is concerned about the policitians we elect; he believes they are not effective in solving pressing problems, but competent people are not being elected.This is a thought-provoking commentary which deserves attention, but it I consider a brief overview, and I disagree with some of his comments.",3,The Siege of Western Civilization,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,1373,"['Herb', 'Myers', 'several', 'threats', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'civilization', 'separation', 'church', 'state', 'individual', 'economic', 'freedom.Threats', 'are', 'external', 'internal', 'Currently', 'major', 'external', 'threat', 'radical', 'Islam', 'sanction', 'God', 'destroy', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'win', 'paradise.Internally', 'civilization', 'threatened', 'what', 'western', 'civilization', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'not', 'taught', 'schools.Second', 'A', 'new', 'ideology', 'appeared', 'places', 'power', 'State', 'rather', 'people', 'who', 'delegate', 'power', 'government', 'new', 'ideology', 'rule', 'law', 'being', 'overturned.Third', 'western', 'countries', 'Japan', 'are', 'having', 'few', 'children', 'are', 'not', 'replacing', 'populations', 'Europe', 'people', 'gap', 'immigrants', 'Islamic', 'countries', 'who', 'have', 'concept', 'western', 'values', 'are', 'coming', 'not', 'integrating', 'society', 'Also', 'countries', 'are', 'becoming', 'more', 'populated', 'aging', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'putting', 'increasing', 'pressure', 'younger', 'workers', 'support.Fourth', 'concerned', 'policitians', 'elect', 'are', 'not', 'effective', 'solving', 'pressing', 'problems', 'competent', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'elected.This', 'thought-provoking', 'commentary', 'attention', 'consider', 'brief', 'overview', 'disagree', 'comments']",N/A
