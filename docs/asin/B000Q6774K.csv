Production notes, little quirks, etc. would popup and give you more background about the filming of the episode. We were very disappointed that that wasn't continued for Season 2. My older children were as disappointed as their parents.However, if you loved the Muppet Show in it's original run, there's no doubt you'll love it again. Your kids will too.

Marold""","[0, 0]","Season 2 in general is a better buy than season 1 because it seems there is less ""filler"" material, while the guest stars are equal to or perhaps a tad better than for season 1. The Muppets invariably do better with comedians than with singers or dancers, since it is so much easier to blend the comedians into the Muppets sthick. The opening is livelier and the guest star appears a lot earlier (with a few exceptions). Gonzo is a tad less rediculous, Miss Piggy is just a tad more subtle, and it seems as if the band has it more together.But, for all the great moments that I remember so fondly with the guest stars, lots of stock skits, such as Veterinarian's Hospital, the Dance, Pigs in Space, and the Swedish Chef tend to lose their charm on rewatching, one episode after another. The brightest addition is Beaker, to the Muppet Labs skits.By far the very best use for these shows is for small kids who are fond of Sesame Street.

Mom""","[0, 0]","The ""Muppet Show""  thirty years after it's original airing on network television is either an acquired taste for younger viewers watching the complete second season series for the first time... or a box of chocolates for those fans who remember first-hand.And like a box of chocolates, some of them are rather strangely flavored. Or as my daughter pointed out, after the first three episodes, (featuring Don Knotts, Zero Mostel, Milton Berle) many of the guest stars during the second season have now departed for that great vaudeville stage in the hereafter: ""Mom, are any of these people still alive?!""  She also asked, ""And they were funny... when?""  It's a fair question, as Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope and George Burns were in the `elder statesmen of comedy"" category in the 1970s anyway, and their appearance in this Muppet show collection constitutes a sort of historical document, suitable for veneration. In the age of Carlos Mencia, though,  they all must seem positively antediluvian. (Imagining Carlos Mencia as a Muppet Show guest; that is a heck of a mental image). In the merciless eye of the TV camera, you can clearly see Edger Bergen's lips moving, when Charley McCarthy talks. You wouldn't have seen it on stage, but it's painfully obvious in television close-up. And the extra feature, the Valentine's Day special with a very pregnant Mia Farrow as a guest is just too creepy for words, in the light of subsequent events. Mercifully from my daughters' point of view, other guests included Steve Martin, Julie Andrews and John Cleese.The Muppets themselves have worn much better than the guest stars: the Swedish Chef with his rebellious lobsters,  Doctor Strangepork and the Swinetrek,  Kermit and the possessive diva Miss Piggy, and any number of timeless gags were funny thirty years ago, and are funny now.  For a fan of puppetry, and of the Muppets, this is an absolutely essential collection.

Flash forward to adulthood: often the things you enjoyed as a child may not seem quite as funny or quite as innovative as you thought they were in your youth. The Muppets definitely hold up. The guest stars on this DVD set are outstanding: Julie Andrews, Elton John, Steve Martin, Cloris Leachman, and more. Unlike other variety shows that had many klunkers inserted between the stars that were hired during Sweeps Weeks, The Muppets consistently had top-rate talent. This four disc set proves that. The extras are also great; a Valentine's Day show with Mia Farrow (who should definitely stick to acting, not singing), an interview with The Muppets section (which has some dark humor when the Muppets reminisce about Jim Henson), and even a Weezer video (don't skip over this one; it's very entertaining!).

Compiliation of season one was apparently fraught with copyright squabbles, resulting in some missed segments and shows of varied length. Happily, all shows on this set run to approximately the same length and show no signs of slicing and dicing. And that's good, because The Muppets became stars (well, quasi-stars, they were puppets) during this season and were able to attract bigger names. In contrast to season one, anyone alive in 1977-78 would recognize 95% of the names listed on the box: Elton John, Bob Hope, George Burns, Julie Andrews, Steve Martin, Peter Sellers, Petula Clark, and on and on. Anyone who wasn't there will probably wonder how a bunch of fancy talking oven mitts ever caught on with the public. Those who were there know why. Season 2 solidified the cast: Kermit as undisputed front runner (he plays marginal roles in the pilots), Miss Piggy as the pig infused with unrequited love, Fozzy as the cheesy comedian, Statler and Waldorf as the curmudgeon critics, Gonzo as the frustrated artist. The indefatigable ""Pigs in Space"" also made its debut. Season two ends up being worth the wait. It even has a fuzzy cover.The show's formula remained vaudevillian with songs, skits, and stars. Ghosts of the Marx Brothers loom in the background. Puns and slapstick abound. Even international artistic sensations such as Rudolph Nureyev drop all pretensions. Nureyev dances with a large pig. He sings, dressed only in a towel, ""Baby, it's cold outside"" with an aroused Miss Piggy. She tries to abscond with the towel. The guy definitely had a sense of humor. When Steve Martin appeared, the show was canceled. Instead they held auditions for new acts. Martin plays his famous ""wild and crazy guy"" (sans obscenities) to its hammy limits. He has to compete with the brilliant ""ribbit"" song duet, who do moving renditions of ""Old Man Ribbit"" and ""Way Down Upon the Swami Ribbit."" A hard act to beat, for sure. Elton John fits right in with chickens in leather, large feathery creatures and singing crocodiles providing accompaniment. Judy Collins does an amazing rendition of ""There was an Old Woman who Swallowed a Fly."" Julie Andrews, still in robust voice, reprises her Sound of Music days with Muppetry. Peter Sellers delivers the usual hilarious and disturbing performance. He squawks to Kermit ""There is no me I do not exist. There used to be a me but I had it surgically removed."" And of course John Cleese steals the entire show. Even Muppets can't compete.Season one included the show's pilot, and this set includes a sort of a pilot. In 1974 ""The Muppets Valentine Special"" aired with guest Mia Farrow. It was a test run. The formula wasn't exactly perfected yet, though an it presents an interesting look at the formation of the Muppets. Ernie and Bert even appear. But don't blink. This experiment remains a far cry from the hit show that debuted a few years later. By 1981 the Muppets were so big that Jim Henson pulled the TV show for larger bait, namely more movies.

Each show has all of its original content, includes segments originally seen only in the United Kingdom, and runs a full 25:30. As with those in the other years, the guest stars for this season are a mix of Hollywood legends and then-current celebrities, but this year had more than its share of major stars. Here's the complete line-up:EPISODE 1: Don KnottsEPISODE 2: Zero MostelEPISODE 3: Milton BerleEPISODE 4: Rich LittleEPISODE 5: Judy CollinsEPISODE 6: Nancy WalkerEPISODE 7: Edgar BergenEPISODE 8: Steve MartinEPISODE 9: Madeline KahnEPISODE 10: George BurnsEPISODE 11: Dom DeLuiseEPISODE 12: Bernadette PetersEPISODE 13: Rudolf NureyevEPISODE 14: Elton JohnEPISODE 15: Lou RawlsEPISODE 16: Cleo LaineEPISODE 17: Julie AndrewsEPISODE 18: Jaye P. MorganEPISODE 19: Peter SellersEPISODE 20: Petula ClarkEPISODE 21: Bob HopeEPISODE 22: Teresa BrewerEPISODE 23: John CleeseEPISODE 24: Cloris LeachmanMost of these shows have a lot to offer, but to me two really stand out. First, the John Cleese show is hilarious. In its Pigs in Space skit, the Monty Python star chews up the scenery as pirate Long John Silversteen. ""A pirate don't use an intercom!"" Cleese scarls when a Muppet suggests a modern way to communicate. ""'Twould be sissy!"" The Nureyev episode, on the other hand, is a real oddity. After the ballet star sings ""Putting On My Top Hat,"" he shoots down his chorus line with a machine gun. Later, he dances to ""Swan Lake"" with a human-size pig.Bonus features include ""The Muppets Valentine Day Special,"" a 1974 television pilot which aired more than two years before ""The Muppet Show"" debuted. Kermit the Frog and actress Mia Farrow star, but the host is Wally, a Henson character who would rarely be seen again. Also included is ""The Muppets on The Muppets,"" (a 13-minute series of tongue-in-cheek interviews) and the 2002 music video ""Keep Fishin'"" by Weezer.Also worth mentioning is the packaging. The menus on each disc are hosted (Fozzie Bear and Kermit chat with you on Discs 1 and 3; Animal and Rizzo handle Discs 2 and 4) and the episodes themselves have (unidentified) chapter stops. In addition, the box itself is more than just cardboard, at least in this initial printing. On the front, Miss Piggy's face is fuzzy, and her blue eyes sparkle.Problems?

Overstreet,"[0, 0]","The Muppet Show is something which, in all likelihood, could never happen again; the days of the television variety show and the British music hall are gone for good. Certainly post-Henson Muppet fare has been, to be blunt, lackluster. Despite that, the Muppet Show remains evergreen for future audiences, giving not only a time capsule to the 1970s, not only a bit of insight to stars great and small who crossed the Muppet stage, but a thick slice of wholesome family entertainment. What's more, the Muppet Show's provided family entertainment that did not lower itself to kiddie pablum, but rather appealed to broad, simple and universal emotions: the desire to be loved, the desire to find happiness, and the absurdity of the world.Thus, how could I help but love Season 2 of the Muppet Show?There are only two flaws for me. If there's a sound flaw (as other reviewers have repeatedly stated) I can't detect it- or at least I don't care enough to detect it. I definitely miss the Muppet Morsels from Season One, though (but not enough to endure the not-quite-uncut nature of Season One's episodes). The Morsels added greatly to the DVD. Second, The Muppet Valentine Show is, and I'm sad to say this about anything Jim Henson himself worked on, it was really horrible. The original Koozbane sketch and ""Frog Went a'Courtin'"" were all that was worth salvaging from that sickly-sweet disaster.There is one other distinct improvement over Season One's release- aside, that is, from Season One containing expurgated versions of several episodes. That improvement is the addition of chapter break points within each episode, so that the viewer is not obliged to hold thumb to a scan button to rewind or fast-forward through half the episode to watch a really good bit.Buena Vista is, apparently, learning from past mistakes; let's hope the learning continues.",4,"Of course I love the Muppets, but the release?",1219276800,"08 21, 2008",2008,1857,"['Muppet', 'Show', 'something', 'likelihood', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'again', 'days', 'television', 'variety', 'show', 'British', 'music', 'hall', 'are', 'gone', 'good', 'Certainly', 'post-Henson', 'Muppet', 'fare', 'been', 'be', 'blunt', 'lackluster', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'evergreen', 'future', 'audiences', 'giving', 'not', 'only', 'time', 'capsule', '1970s', 'not', 'only', 'bit', 'insight', 'stars', 'great', 'small', 'who', 'crossed', 'Muppet', 'stage', 'thick', 'slice', 'wholesome', 'family', 'entertainment', 'What', 'more', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'provided', 'family', 'entertainment', 'did', 'not', 'lower', 'kiddie', 'pablum', 'rather', 'appealed', 'broad', 'simple', 'universal', 'emotions', 'desire', 'be', 'loved', 'desire', 'find', 'happiness', 'absurdity', 'world.Thus', 'how', 'could', 'help', 'love', 'Season', '2', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'flaws', 'sound', 'flaw', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'repeatedly', 'stated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'detect', 'it-', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'detect', 'definitely', 'miss', 'Muppet', 'Morsels', 'Season', 'One', 'not', 'enough', 'endure', 'not-quite-uncut', 'nature', 'Season', 'One', 'episodes', 'Morsels', 'added', 'greatly', 'DVD', 'Second', 'Muppet', 'Valentine', 'Show', ""'m"", 'sad', 'say', 'anything', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'worked', 'was', 'really', 'horrible', 'original', 'Koozbane', 'sketch', 'Frog', 'Went', ""a'Courtin"", 'were', 'was', 'worth', 'salvaging', 'sickly-sweet', 'one', 'other', 'distinct', 'improvement', 'Season', 'One', 'release-', 'aside', 'Season', 'One', 'containing', 'expurgated', 'versions', 'several', 'episodes', 'improvement', 'addition', 'chapter', 'break', 'points', 'episode', 'viewer', 'not', 'obliged', 'hold', 'thumb', 'scan', 'button', 'rewind', 'fast-forward', 'episode', 'watch', 'really', 'good', 'bit.Buena', 'Vista', 'apparently', 'learning', 'past', 'mistakes', 'let', 'hope', 'learning']",The Muppet Show: Season 2

Classic performers abound like Milton Berle, Rich Little, George Burns and Bob Hope; there's even an episode with Rudolf Nureyev.

Well Excuuuuuse MEEEEE!!!!!)Love is in the air for Gonzo and Madeline Kahn (?!?) and Julie Andrews puts in a fabulous appearance.  What totally sold me were the musical guests (although I am not a fan of Judy Collins).  Lou Rawls, Jaye P.

1073783,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000Q6774K,Mark Baker,"[0, 0]","The second season of the Muppet Show finds our heroes in fine form as they continue to attempt to put on their weekly show.  Once again, the cast is made up of the Muppets with one human guest start each episode.  And again, the wackiness is incredible fun.Not everything is old and the same, however.  Beaker, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant in Muppet Labs makes his first appearance here.  Poor Beaker is always the guinea pig in the experiments, which always have poor results.  This season also introduces us to ""Pigs in Space,"" the Star Trek spoof that is out of this world.But there is much that is familiar from the first season as well.  ""At the Dance"" may not be in every episode this time around, but you still get to laugh at all the jokes on one topic.  ""Veterinarian's Hospital"" really hits its stride this go around as they milk every topic for as many puns as they possibly can.  I was thrilled to see it was the most used recurring sketch.The writing has gotten sharper.  Each episode has some kind of problem going on backstage that plays out between musical numbers and skits.  In one episode, the theater is in danger of being sold.  In another, Kermit is out sick and needs Fozzie to fill in as host.  Then there's the week that a cow is wandering around backstage.  Miss Piggy pays the audience to cheer extra loudly for her in an attempt to get star billing.  Later, she decides to lose some weight.  And we can't forget the week she gets jealous of Kermit doing a duet with Miss Mousy.  Finally, there's the show when the pigs completely take over, including new host Kermit the Pig and comedian Fozzie Pig.And I can't leave out the guest stars.  While I once again hadn't heard of many of them, others are familiar.  Julie Andrews was charming and funny as she interacted with the Muppets.  Her interview segment was especially funny.  Watching Milton Berle play straight man to Statler and Waldorf was wonderful.  George Burns finds a new side kick in Gonzo in a bit that could have fit on any of his old shows with Gracie Allen.  Bernadette Peters gets a very touching song with Kermit's nephew Robin.  Some guest stars aren't in as many sketechs, but it all works out.  For example, the running gag in Bob Hope's episode was that he was overbooked at charity events.  While he hardly shows up, it was funny.And this set includes the famous Steve Martin episode where they suspend production to audition new acts, including bits from Steve's stand up routines.The weakest episodes of the season were the first couple.  Maybe the writers didn't quite know how to work with the slightly altered format, but I just didn't find them as funny.  Additionally, the special features aren't really worth watching more than once.The same can't be said for the shows themselves.  I know I'll be going back to this collection to enjoy the timeless humor for many years to come.",5,"""Turn in Next Week to See Last Week's Show.""",1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2891,"['second', 'season', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'heroes', 'fine', 'form', 'continue', 'attempt', 'put', 'weekly', 'show', 'Once', 'again', 'cast', 'made', 'Muppets', 'one', 'human', 'guest', 'start', 'episode', 'again', 'wackiness', 'incredible', 'fun.Not', 'everything', 'old', 'same', 'however', 'Beaker', 'Dr.', 'Bunsen', 'Honeydew', 'assistant', 'Muppet', 'Labs', 'first', 'appearance', 'here', 'Poor', 'Beaker', 'always', 'guinea', 'pig', 'experiments', 'always', 'have', 'poor', 'results', 'season', 'also', 'Pigs', 'Space', 'Star', 'Trek', 'spoof', 'world.But', 'much', 'familiar', 'first', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Dance', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'episode', 'time', 'around', 'still', 'get', 'laugh', 'jokes', 'one', 'topic', 'Veterinarian', 'Hospital', 'really', 'stride', 'go', 'around', 'milk', 'topic', 'many', 'puns', 'possibly', 'can', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'was', 'most', 'used', 'recurring', 'sketch.The', 'writing', 'gotten', 'sharper', 'episode', 'kind', 'problem', 'going', 'backstage', 'out', 'musical', 'numbers', 'skits', 'one', 'episode', 'theater', 'danger', 'being', 'sold', 'Kermit', 'out', 'sick', 'Fozzie', 'fill', 'as', 'host', 'Then', 'week', 'cow', 'wandering', 'around', 'backstage', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'audience', 'cheer', 'extra', 'loudly', 'attempt', 'get', 'star', 'billing', 'Later', 'lose', 'weight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'week', 'jealous', 'Kermit', 'doing', 'duet', 'Miss', 'Mousy', 'Finally', 'show', 'when', 'pigs', 'completely', 'take', 'over', 'including', 'new', 'host', 'Kermit', 'Pig', 'comedian', 'Fozzie', 'Pig.And', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'guest', 'stars', 'once', 'again', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'familiar', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'was', 'charming', 'funny', 'interacted', 'Muppets', 'interview', 'segment', 'was', 'especially', 'funny', 'Watching', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'play', 'straight', 'man', 'Statler', 'Waldorf', 'was', 'wonderful', 'George', 'Burns', 'new', 'side', 'kick', 'Gonzo', 'bit', 'could', 'have', 'fit', 'old', 'shows', 'Gracie', 'Allen', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'very', 'touching', 'song', 'Kermit', 'nephew', 'Robin', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'many', 'sketechs', 'out', 'example', 'running', 'gag', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'episode', 'was', 'was', 'overbooked', 'charity', 'events', 'hardly', 'up', 'was', 'funny.And', 'set', 'famous', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'episode', 'where', 'suspend', 'production', 'audition', 'new', 'acts', 'including', 'bits', 'Steve', 'stand', 'up', 'routines.The', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'first', 'couple', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'work', 'slightly', 'altered', 'format', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'Additionally', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once.The', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'shows', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'going', 'back', 'collection', 'enjoy', 'timeless', 'humor', 'many', 'years', 'come']",The Muppet Show: Season 2

My review is more about the emotional side of watching my favorite thing from childhood.  The Muppets has, and always will, induce a sense of joy and laughter in me like nothing else can.  From the great cast of characters to their sometimes slapstick, sometimes subtle, but always amazing sense of humor, it really is the best franchise/brand in entertainment.  Sure they've had their misses (most of them after the passing of a genius, Jim Henson), Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets From Space stand out, but by and large their collection is a series of laughs and pop culture mainstays.Season 2 of the Muppet show has all the great guest stars.  Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Steve Martin, et. al.  I love all of the episodes and each one brings a little something different.  If you are a fan of the Muppets, buy this.

1073787,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000Q6774K,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Kermit the Frog hosts and runs a vaudeville-style variety show in a rundown theater every week, presenting an insane array of performers to an equally insane crowd. A different celebrity guest star, the sole non-Muppet on the show, suffers through the experience each week as well, and the result is one of the most original and delightful programs ever to have hit television!Season 2 of Jim Henson's 70's classic is a real treat for longtime Muppet fans. Beloved characters that are almost unrecognizable in season one finally come into their own. Miss Piggy is now unmistakably Miss Piggy, Janice is Janice, and so on... Some of the comedy is a little dated and overly corny, but much of it is still fantastic! Pigs in Space and Veterinarian's Hospital will have you in stitches. Man, I miss Rowlf being a main Muppet player like he was back on this show, don't you? The charming moments are all there too (Rowlf was always one of the best at that), and the second season has some outstanding guest stars on its roster! Disc One has Don Knotts, Zero Mostel, Milton Berle, Rich Little, Judy Collins, and Nancy Walker. Disc Two has Edgar Bergen, Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn, George Burns, Dom DeLuise, Bernadette Peters, and Rudolf Nureyev. Disc Three has Elton John, Lou Rawls, Cleo Laine, Julie Andrews, Jaye P. Morgan, and Peter Sellers. And, finally, Disc 4 has Petula Clark, Bob Hope, Teresa Brewer, John Cleese, and Cloris Leachman.All the guests are fabulous, though to point out a few things that stick in my memory: Milton Berle's episode was particularly enjoyable, and Elton John's was just incredible! Rich Little wasn't as good at impressions as I thought I remembered, though some were good. Seeing Edgar Bergen, Charlie McCarthy, and Mortimer Snerd with the Muppets was a delight! While Steve Martin is one of the funniest guys and best comedic actors out there, I was rather disappointed in his episode and didn't find his very bits funny (yeah, I was very surprised). Madeline Kahn was, of course, wonderful, and so were George Burns, Dom DeLuise, Peter Sellers, Don Knotts, Zero Mostel, Rudolph Nureyev, Cloris Leachman, John Cleese, and especially Julie Andrews! Bob Hope was another whom I was sad about because he is a fave of mine but didn't do much on his episode. The others don't stick in my mind as well because I wasn't as familiar with them (the more dated guests, I suppose), but another that was fantabulous was the always wonderful and lovely Bernadette Peters, who was also particularly smokin' hot in her last number (picture Bernadette Peters circa 1977 in pigtails, made up like Elly May Clampett).This DVD set is excellent! Disney put out an excellent DVD set for a TV show? Yep. Where's the love for the Disney Afternoon shows, Disney? You didn't even finish any of those sets and only barely touched on the range of titles there. Oh well, I'll keep nagging them about that. Anyway, The quality of these uncut shows is very good, despite being over 30 years old, and we even get hosted menus throughout and bonus features on Disc 4! Three wonderful bonus features, to be specific. Remember that Weezer video that featured the Muppets back in 2002, ""Keep Fishin'""? Well, that's on here! Good stuff, too. There's also a collection of new gag interviews with the Muppets called, ""The Muppets on The Muppets"". And finally, the most significant bonus feature here is ""The Muppets Valentine Show"". It's a 1974 ABC Special that was basically a pilot for a very different take on ""The Muppet Show"". It's set in a house, it would seem, (a boarding house perhaps?) and features a just not wacky enough cast of Muppet characters led by one writer named Wally. Kermit is just one of the gang, though he already is doing his Koozbane bits. The guest star is a pregnant Mia Farrow, and she's very sweet and Rosemary's Baby-ish, but the program itself, in my opinion, was pretty awful. Some describe it as similar to the Muppet show, just in a different setting. I didn't feel it very similar at all. Yeah, it was a human guest star with Muppets, Kermit was there and there were musical numbers, but I guess the dull characters and kids' morning show setting just put me off on the whole thing. It looked more like a pilot for Under the Umbrella Tree for me, except when they did the musical numbers that were all sort of imagined. Don't get me wrong though, I am thrilled that this special was included on the set. It is fascinating and just the kind of bonus features DVDs SHOULD have. I hope the Star Wars Holiday Special makes it as a bonus feature someday too! I enjoy that one a lot though, ha. Don't ask me why.Anyway, to sum up, Disney did a great job here and the set is a must own, and I can't wait to get Season 3 and for the rest of the show to come out (with Muppets At Walt Disney World as a bonus feature on one, I hope)! Especially Season 4 with the Star Wars episode!

Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","It's been nearly four decades since it first aired on television, and yet ""The Muppet Show"" has lost absolutely none of its charm, wit or technical wizardry. As a child of the eighties, most of my experiences with the Muppets were thanks to my parents recording old episodes and movies onto videotape, and so it was a gratifying upgrade to settle down with the restored clarity of DVDs.It was all as I remembered it. In a rundown old theatre, a disparate group of performers put on a variety show each night for a rowdy crowd, including two old hecklers in the balcony. Hosted by Kermit the Frog and joined by a special (human) guest per episode, the range of Muppet stars included Miss Piggy the diva, Fozzie Bear the comedian, Gonzo the daredevil, Scooter the gofer, Rowlf the piano player, and the band members of Electric Mayhem.With twenty-four episodes spread out over four discs, season two carries on the winning formula of juxtaposing the on-stage routines against the backstage chaos. The result is puppetry at its finest and most creative, with performances that include dancing gingerbread men, old ladies wrestling, singing owls, live animals, shadow puppets, ventriloquist dummies, a Western gunfight played out by chickens and roosters, and puppets ranging in size from giant full-body costumes to tiny caterpillars.As you watch, certain segments are sure to stick in your memory. In one sketch an elderly inventor moves around his lab, creating potions and getting progressively younger as he sings about the passage of time; ultimately ending up old once again as his concoctions reverse the aging effect and his song comes to an end. In another, a puppet who only has half the features on his face sings a sad ditty about how he's missing something profound, and is only made complete when his love appears. And of course, who could forget Kermit's beautiful rendition of ""It's Not Easy Being Green""?There are regular skits such as Doctor Bob Veterinarian's Clinic and At The Dance (both loaded with terrible puns), Muppet Labs, in which Professor Honeydew and his hapless assistant Beaker perform various science experiments, the Swedish Chef's cooking show, Muppet Newflash (which invariably end with something landing on the presenter's head) and Pigs in Space - which is exactly what it sounds like. There's also room for our main characters to perform: Kermit tap-dances, Miss Piggy sings, Fozzie tells bad jokes, Gonzo...does odd things and calls it ""art"".To be honest, I didn't actually know most of the guest stars. Out of the twenty-four episodes I only recognized Steve Martin, Bernadette Peters, Elton John, Julie Andrews and John Cleese, though that's an indicator of my own age rather than a criticism - but parents should expect their children to be completely nonplussed by the celebrities they have on the show. Ranging from impressionists, actors, comedians, singers, ventriloquists and ballet dancers, the skills that the guests provide often shape the episode itself, and every second is teeming with creativity, from the moment Scooter fetches the guest star from their dressing room to the final curtain call.Though the canned laughter is often loud and distracting (and apparently Jim Henson hated it himself) and at least one segment appears twice over the course of the season (Fozzie and Rowlf playing the piano together) you can actually *see* the puppeteers skills increase from episode to episode. This is a must-have for any collector, but also for long-time fans who are ready to share the Muppets with the latest generation.Season two also comes with an old Valentine's Day Special (guest starring Mia Farrow, and featuring several early prototypes of Muppets that were later jettisoned), as well as some more contemporary interviews with the Muppet cast and Weezer's ""Keep Fishin"" music video.",5,"""It's Time to Meet the Muppets...""",1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,3843,"['been', 'nearly', 'four', 'decades', 'first', 'aired', 'television', 'yet', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'lost', 'absolutely', 'none', 'charm', 'wit', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'child', 'eighties', 'most', 'experiences', 'Muppets', 'were', 'thanks', 'parents', 'recording', 'old', 'episodes', 'movies', 'videotape', 'was', 'gratifying', 'upgrade', 'settle', 'down', 'restored', 'clarity', 'DVDs.It', 'was', 'remembered', 'rundown', 'old', 'theatre', 'disparate', 'group', 'performers', 'put', 'variety', 'show', 'night', 'rowdy', 'crowd', 'including', 'two', 'old', 'hecklers', 'balcony', 'Hosted', 'Kermit', 'Frog', 'joined', 'special', 'human', 'guest', 'episode', 'range', 'Muppet', 'stars', 'included', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'diva', 'Fozzie', 'Bear', 'comedian', 'Gonzo', 'daredevil', 'Scooter', 'gofer', 'Rowlf', 'piano', 'player', 'band', 'members', 'Electric', 'Mayhem.With', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'spread', 'out', 'four', 'discs', 'season', 'two', 'winning', 'formula', 'juxtaposing', 'on-stage', 'routines', 'backstage', 'chaos', 'result', 'puppetry', 'finest', 'most', 'creative', 'performances', 'include', 'dancing', 'gingerbread', 'men', 'old', 'ladies', 'wrestling', 'singing', 'owls', 'live', 'animals', 'shadow', 'puppets', 'ventriloquist', 'dummies', 'Western', 'gunfight', 'played', 'out', 'chickens', 'roosters', 'puppets', 'ranging', 'size', 'giant', 'full-body', 'costumes', 'tiny', 'caterpillars.As', 'watch', 'certain', 'segments', 'are', 'sure', 'stick', 'memory', 'one', 'sketch', 'elderly', 'inventor', 'moves', 'lab', 'creating', 'potions', 'getting', 'progressively', 'younger', 'passage', 'time', 'ultimately', 'ending', 'up', 'old', 'once', 'again', 'concoctions', 'reverse', 'aging', 'effect', 'song', 'end', 'puppet', 'who', 'only', 'features', 'face', 'sad', 'ditty', 'how', 'missing', 'something', 'profound', 'only', 'made', 'complete', 'when', 'love', 'course', 'who', 'could', 'forget', 'Kermit', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'Not', 'Easy', 'Being', 'Green', 'are', 'regular', 'skits', 'such', 'Doctor', 'Bob', 'Veterinarian', 'Clinic', 'Dance', 'loaded', 'terrible', 'puns', 'Muppet', 'Labs', 'Professor', 'Honeydew', 'hapless', 'assistant', 'Beaker', 'perform', 'various', 'science', 'experiments', 'Swedish', 'Chef', 'cooking', 'show', 'Muppet', 'Newflash', 'invariably', 'end', 'something', 'landing', 'presenter', 'head', 'Pigs', 'Space', 'exactly', 'what', 'also', 'room', 'main', 'characters', 'perform', 'Kermit', 'tap-dances', 'Miss', 'Piggy', 'sings', 'Fozzie', 'bad', 'jokes', 'Gonzo', 'odd', 'things', 'art', '.To', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'most', 'guest', 'stars', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'only', 'recognized', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'Elton', 'John', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'John', 'Cleese', 'indicator', 'own', 'age', 'rather', 'criticism', 'parents', 'should', 'expect', 'children', 'be', 'completely', 'nonplussed', 'celebrities', 'have', 'show', 'Ranging', 'impressionists', 'actors', 'comedians', 'singers', 'ventriloquists', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'skills', 'guests', 'provide', 'often', 'shape', 'episode', 'second', 'teeming', 'creativity', 'moment', 'Scooter', 'guest', 'star', 'dressing', 'room', 'final', 'curtain', 'canned', 'laughter', 'often', 'loud', 'distracting', 'apparently', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'hated', 'least', 'one', 'segment', 'twice', 'course', 'season', 'Fozzie', 'Rowlf', 'playing', 'piano', 'together', 'can', 'actually', '*see*', 'puppeteers', 'skills', 'increase', 'episode', 'episode', 'must-have', 'collector', 'also', 'long-time', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'ready', 'share', 'Muppets', 'latest', 'generation.Season', 'two', 'also', 'old', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Special', 'guest', 'starring', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'featuring', 'several', 'early', 'prototypes', 'Muppets', 'were', 'later', 'jettisoned', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'contemporary', 'interviews', 'Muppet', 'cast', 'Weezer', 'Keep', 'Fishin', 'music', 'video']",The Muppet Show: Season 2
