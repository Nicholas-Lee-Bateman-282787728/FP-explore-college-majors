Armes,"[0, 0]","i purchased this film in the first part of January this year. i remembered seeing this film many years ago on tv. when it was first released i was hesitant to buy it due to the inflated pricing of Amazon. i finally conceded, however, and bought it. it was well worth the price. i am an avid conisseur of classic films, but only a few are engrossing enough to warrant multiple viewings. this is one of those. from the opening credits to the final chilling climax it seizes your attention and never ceases to keep it.the film conveys the true events depicting the life of Robert E. Burns (though the names are changed in the film). Burns was apprehended, wrongly convicted and sentenced to 10 years of incarceration on a chain gang. that premise alone should warrant interest in this landmark film. i won't divulge any details of he film, that would only ruin it for someone who hasn't seen it.as for the DVD. good transfer and sound. no real extras. a biography of the real man would have been great, but the studios seem to be getting lazier by the year in respect to spcial features. still highly recommended.",5,engrossing biopic,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,1110,"['i', 'purchased', 'film', 'first', 'part', 'January', 'year', 'i', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'tv', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'i', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'due', 'inflated', 'pricing', 'Amazon', 'i', 'finally', 'conceded', 'however', 'bought', 'was', 'well', 'price', 'i', 'am', 'avid', 'conisseur', 'classic', 'films', 'only', 'few', 'are', 'engrossing', 'enough', 'warrant', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'one', 'opening', 'credits', 'final', 'chilling', 'climax', 'attention', 'never', 'ceases', 'keep', 'it.the', 'film', 'conveys', 'true', 'events', 'depicting', 'life', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Burns', 'names', 'are', 'changed', 'film', 'Burns', 'was', 'apprehended', 'wrongly', 'convicted', 'sentenced', '10', 'years', 'incarceration', 'chain', 'gang', 'premise', 'alone', 'should', 'warrant', 'interest', 'landmark', 'film', 'i', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'details', 'film', 'would', 'only', 'ruin', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.as', 'DVD', 'good', 'transfer', 'sound', 'real', 'extras', 'biography', 'real', 'man', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'studios', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'lazier', 'year', 'respect', 'spcial', 'features', 'still', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

146221,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792841018,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","One of the most earnest and brutally honest films of the 30's; `I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang' is a nearly flawless depiction at injustice and corruption within the judicial system.James Allen, freshly returning from World War I, finds himself unjustly accused of a crime and sentenced to ten years on a chain gang.  Treated with no respect and basically emotionally and physically tormented each day, James dreams of escape.  Then he does just that; escapes.  For years he lives his life under another identity, keeping very minimal contact with family so as not to be found by the men in hot pursuit of him.  He is a productive man who proves by his actions that he is not the type of man to commit the crimes he was sentenced for, but once he is found his fate seems to be sealed yet again.Is there escape for him this time?The film, based on a true story, I'm sure takes some liberties; but it is a brutally honest and uncompromising tale of the brazen hypocrisy within the legal system at the time.  I had seen on TCM where they discussed the real James Allen being present (actually `hidden' because he was still being hunted) on set during the shot to give insight into what he actually went through and so the representation of the harsh atmosphere is apparently accurate; so accurate that it caused an outrage in Georgia, where the real James Allen was imprisoned.  It within the films authentic delivery that it really soars as a brilliant depiction of humanity and the struggle to survive in a world seemingly determined to destroy us.  James Allen was a very strong man who rose above repeatedly; but as the harrowing finale shows, there is only so much one can do.I have not seen a lot of Muni's films, but I heard a lot of his character; which was apparently hard to get along with and very hard to work with.  The arrogant Muni has failed to really impress me in other films that I have seen, but here is a revelation to say the least.  He is so human, so natural, SO GIFTED that it is almost understandable why he became so full of himself.  I don't justify his behavior, but I can't help but rave his commanding performance, so full of heart, soul and rich development.In the end I highly, highly recommend this film.  It challenges our faith in a system set up for our benefit, and raises concern as to the treatment of individuals we consider `criminal'.  It is an unforgettable story that is delivered in an unforgettable way; thus providing a MUST-SEE film!",5,"Uncompromising honesty, no matter how difficult to take...",1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,2482,"['One', 'most', 'earnest', 'brutally', 'honest', 'films', '30', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'depiction', 'injustice', 'corruption', 'judicial', 'system.James', 'Allen', 'freshly', 'returning', 'World', 'War', 'unjustly', 'accused', 'crime', 'sentenced', 'ten', 'years', 'chain', 'gang', 'Treated', 'respect', 'basically', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'tormented', 'day', 'James', 'escape', 'Then', 'just', 'escapes', 'years', 'life', 'identity', 'keeping', 'very', 'minimal', 'contact', 'family', 'so', 'as', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'men', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'productive', 'man', 'who', 'actions', 'not', 'type', 'man', 'commit', 'crimes', 'was', 'sentenced', 'once', 'found', 'fate', 'be', 'sealed', 'yet', 'again.Is', 'escape', 'time', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', ""'m"", 'sure', 'liberties', 'brutally', 'honest', 'uncompromising', 'tale', 'brazen', 'hypocrisy', 'legal', 'system', 'time', 'had', 'seen', 'TCM', 'where', 'discussed', 'real', 'James', 'Allen', 'being', 'present', 'actually', 'hidden', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'hunted', 'set', 'shot', 'give', 'insight', 'what', 'actually', 'went', 'so', 'representation', 'harsh', 'atmosphere', 'apparently', 'accurate', 'so', 'caused', 'outrage', 'Georgia', 'where', 'real', 'James', 'Allen', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'films', 'authentic', 'delivery', 'really', 'brilliant', 'depiction', 'humanity', 'struggle', 'survive', 'world', 'seemingly', 'determined', 'destroy', 'James', 'Allen', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'man', 'who', 'rose', 'repeatedly', 'harrowing', 'finale', 'shows', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'do.I', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'lot', 'Muni', 'films', 'heard', 'lot', 'character', 'was', 'apparently', 'hard', 'get', 'very', 'hard', 'work', 'arrogant', 'Muni', 'failed', 'really', 'impress', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'here', 'revelation', 'say', 'least', 'so', 'human', 'so', 'natural', 'SO', 'GIFTED', 'almost', 'understandable', 'why', 'became', 'so', 'full', 'do', ""n't"", 'justify', 'behavior', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'rave', 'commanding', 'performance', 'full', 'heart', 'soul', 'rich', 'development.In', 'end', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'faith', 'system', 'set', 'up', 'benefit', 'concern', 'treatment', 'individuals', 'consider', 'criminal', 'unforgettable', 'story', 'delivered', 'unforgettable', 'way', 'thus', 'providing', 'MUST-SEE', 'film']",N/A

The ending of the film is certainly one of the best and the most haunting ever filmed. Paul Muni's performance is more than outstanding, and he clearly shows how much he is into the character of James Allen. The portrayal of the chain gang on I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang was enough for the public to denounce the practice, and forever gone is that by 1955.

146223,A3L61G6N7AT8N2,0792841018,"Bartok Kinski ""A casual stroll through the lu...","[0, 5]","This film is hardly a ""classic"", nor is it a ""social protest movie"" that most of these misguided reviewers would have you believe. It falls into the realm of impressionable 'exploitation' films that attempted to substantiate struggling theaters with their wealthy competitors. Warner Bros. looked for ""controversial"" themes to release them from their box office slump and found it with topics like this, packaging emotional rubbish into the screens in the form of low budget B grade ""content films"". Anyone who thinks Warner Bros was a ""redeeming and caring company interested in the plight of man"" is deluded, they were merely out to make a profit, nothing more. Examine their union records, dictatorial management and abuse of rights at the time if you don't believe me. Surely, a film which pulls at your heart is only intended to pull at your wallet.The film itself has a weak script, stale acting (bordering on dull to over anxious), B grade direction, poor dialogue and is tedious. It meanders through one half hearted empty skit after another, dislodging us from any sincere interest at all. Muni is a boorish actor, neither disguising his brusque acting method nor elaborating on any convincing emotion. Standard film shots are scattered throughout, of locations and events in history, a parade from WW 1, a real street scene in Chicago, and this further aggravates the authenticity of the whole subject, making the film look ""cut up"" because most of it was filmed on cheap Warner Bros sets in Pasadena.The chain gang scenes are unrealistic, exaggerated, and only attempt to garner instant condemnation from the viewer. I don't need a mediocre film to instigate that ""chain gangs are evil"", I should know that from my own knowledge, and further more, this film contradicts itself because capitalism itself is slavery and there is so much insane dialog about the ""virtues of work"" in the beginning. I fail to believe that there is a difference between a worker at a factory occupied for 12 hours a day like a slave and a man stuck on a chain gang!An average film reduced by film historians and buffs to a ""classic"" merely because they can not understand why films had to make a profit for the capitalistic and authoritarian film companies which produced them.

Nor will you find a more effective performance than Paul Muni's as James Allen. Mervin Leroy was given a chance to direct by WB Vitaphone and proved himself more than capable. This film is as fresh and powerful today as it was in 1932, thanks in part to the pre-Hay's office frankness of its subject matter. It is a film about the role destiny and fate play in our lives. You will never look at the life you have in the same way after seeing this film.James Allen, returns from WWI a changed man. Working as an engineer in the military has given him dreams for something more than his brother expects from him. Only his mother understands and gives him her blessing to go out into the world and find himself. So he sets off to work in construction to build, traveling all across the country from job to job.Times are lean in the depression and when Preston Foster offers to mooch a hamburger for him he can not refuse. But Foster pulls a gun and forces Allen to help him rob the diner. He is killed during the robbery by the police and Allen is unjustly sentenced to 10 years in the chain gangs of the deep south. The brutality and demoralization of the human spirit is more than he can bear and with a little help from his friend (nicely played by Edward Ellis) he plans a successful escape. He manages to avoid the police and changes his name to Allen James.In her brief screen time, Noel Francis as Linda, a speakeasy girl, gives a touching performance, offering a little humanity and love back to James. He seems to have a fresh start and slowly works his way up in construction to become a prominent and respected member of the community, helping Chicago become a great city.But fate forms a dark cloud once more in the form of Marie (Glenda Farrel), a self absorbed girl who blackmails him into marriage when she accidently learns his secret. Her hard drinking and free-spending lifestyle and her free loving ways are only made bearable when he meets the wonderful Helen, played nicely by the lovely Helen Vinson. In Helen, he finds the love that has been missing in his life and asks for a divorce so they can be together. He calls Marie's bluff only to find it was not a bluff.His prominence in the community keeps him from jail for a time and he lashes out publicly against the brutality of the chain gangs of the deep south. This film changed public opinion about the chain gangs and was the impetus for its demise in the deep south.James finally strikes a deal where he will return for 90 days and then receive a pardon. He accepts so he and Helen can live free from the cloud that has been hanging over him. But the state reneges on its deal and offers one year as a model prisoner before his release.He has no choice but to accept and it is a quietly powerful scene when that deal also is taken away after the year is up and it breaks Allen's spirit. He plans another escape from the chain gang and is once more successful, but his friend is killed this time. Allen's last stint in the chain gang has changed him, however, and he must now live a life on the run, barren of love and devoid of humanity.Robert E. Burns wrote this powerful story and Paul Muni gives an unforgettable performance. The final scene is as powerful as any you will ever see, as he hunts down his beloved Helen just to see her one last time and say goodbye. Her desperate words as they embrace embody this entire film: ""It was all going to be so different."" As Allen backs away into the darkness and she asks him how he survives, you will never forget Muni's heartbreaking response.Don't be turned off by this film, thinking it is just a prison movie from the past. It is about fate and destiny, and our own humanity. You will not see anything else like it in American cinema.

146226,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,0792841018,Bomojaz,"[2, 2]","One of the truly great movies. Paul Muni plays a WW I soldier hero, now discharged and eager to make something of himself, preferably in civil engineering. But jobs are tight and, down on his luck, he goes into a diner with a stranger he's met hoping to get a handout - only the stranger pulls a gun and robs the joint; things go flooey and Muni ends up holding the money when he's caught and sent to a prison farm and chain gang. Conditions are hellish but he escapes and makes his way to Chicago, where he gets a job building roads and bridges. He does good for a couple of years until a vengeful woman reveals his past to the cops and he's arrested again. Promised a pardon after 90 days if he agrees to return to the chain gang, he does, but the pardon never comes. So he escapes again and the movie ends with him on the lam - a truly desperate man.One of the earliest social protest movies ever made, the picture packs quite a punch, even today. It has one of the great (and depressing) closing lines in screen history: when asked how he lives, he answers (in a voice dripping with anger and desperation), ""I steal."" It's about how good, decent people are destroyed by an uncaring judicial system.

146227,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,0792841018,Buenoslibros.es,"[3, 3]","Almost perfect classic by Mervyn LeRoy. A man returned from fighting WWII decides not to go back to his routine job at the factory. His experience doing some engineering work in the Army inspires him to look into the construction business, study and maybe become an engineer. But society has other plans for him. One little mistake will start him in the opposite direction he had planned.Social realism, without being preachy or melodramatic, is the best description for this film's style. High quality direction, great photography. The story is well developed and interesting all the way. The flaws are some characterizations: the mother and the older brother in the first scenes are too clich&eacute;d and poorly played. Luckily we don't see them much. The film goes increscendo in intensity and quality.  One cannot help comparing it to ""Cool Hand Luke"". Muni was no Paul Newman but he manages it.It's not just a criticism of the justice system in some States of the Union. It has a lot more meat, which saves it from the mediocrity of so many films on fugitives and prison life. There's a good study on female stereotypes; the disadvantages of individualism & the entrepreneural spirit in a totalitarian state; and, of course, the quiet resignation and resilience of blacks to injustice.I loved this line said by a woman: ""There're no musts in my life.

And, like Cagney, his breakthrough role was that of a gangster, in a Warner Brothers film. In Cagney's case, it was in 1931's The Public Enemy, and in Muni's case it was a year later, in the original Scarface (yes, this was the film that the 1980s Al Pacino quasi-comedy was loosely based on). Later, that same year, Muni delivered his second powerhouse performance, in another black and white Warner Brothers social crime drama: I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang, directed by Mervyn Leroy, who was coming off the successful Little Caesar, which made Edward G. Robinson a star. Of the stars of the Big Three Gangster films of that era, only Muni totally escaped the shadow of gangster typecasting, but that did not mean he could not do a crime drama about another subject entirely. But, before I move on, let me return to the Cagney comparison, for while their career trajectories toward stardom were fairly similar, they also succeeded because of another similarity: both men were great actors whose styles were far more `real' than the overt acting styles that were carryovers from the silent days, and would not be relinquished until the 1950s, when, first Neo-Realism, then the New Wave, changed film forever. And this was, like Cagney, in large part to being a Broadway and Vaudeville star before hitting film. Another similarity the two actors shared was an ability to dominate the screen. Cagney did so with sheer brute magnetism. He was, despite any roles, always JIMMY CAGNEY! Muni, on the other hand, was a sort of Lon Chaney who could transcend horror genres. Muni's face was like clay, whether in makeup or not, and one could read his characters' thoughts just by watching his facial reactions and the glint in his eyes. Simply one of the best actors in film in any era, and a good quarter century ahead of the curve in acting, in terms of realism.I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang is also a very good film, near-great. The only thing that holds it back from true greatness are a few plot holes and some weak acting from the supporting cast. It's greatest quality, though, is how relevant and undated a film it is re: race, injustice, evil, society, the so-called `justice system,' etc.",4,Good,1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,2305,"['James', 'Cagney', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'was', 'Broadway', 'star', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'early', 'sound', 'era', 'Cagney', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'was', 'gangster', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'film', 'Cagney', 'case', 'was', '1931', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Muni', 'case', 'was', 'year', 'later', 'original', 'Scarface', 'yes', 'was', 'film', '1980s', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'quasi-comedy', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'Later', 'same', 'year', 'Muni', 'delivered', 'second', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'black', 'white', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'social', 'crime', 'drama', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'A', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'directed', 'Mervyn', 'Leroy', 'who', 'was', 'coming', 'off', 'successful', 'Little', 'Caesar', 'made', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'star', 'stars', 'Big', 'Three', 'Gangster', 'films', 'era', 'only', 'Muni', 'totally', 'escaped', 'shadow', 'gangster', 'typecasting', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'crime', 'drama', 'subject', 'entirely', 'move', 'let', 'return', 'Cagney', 'comparison', 'career', 'trajectories', 'stardom', 'were', 'fairly', 'similar', 'also', 'succeeded', 'similarity', 'men', 'were', 'great', 'actors', 'styles', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'real', 'overt', 'acting', 'styles', 'were', 'carryovers', 'silent', 'days', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'relinquished', '1950s', 'when', 'first', 'Neo-Realism', 'then', 'New', 'Wave', 'changed', 'film', 'forever', 'was', 'Cagney', 'large', 'part', 'being', 'Broadway', 'Vaudeville', 'star', 'hitting', 'film', 'similarity', 'two', 'actors', 'shared', 'was', 'ability', 'dominate', 'screen', 'Cagney', 'did', 'so', 'sheer', 'brute', 'magnetism', 'was', 'roles', 'always', 'JIMMY', 'CAGNEY', 'Muni', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'sort', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'who', 'could', 'transcend', 'horror', 'genres', 'Muni', 'face', 'was', 'clay', 'makeup', 'not', 'one', 'could', 'read', 'characters', 'thoughts', 'just', 'watching', 'facial', 'reactions', 'glint', 'eyes', 'Simply', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'film', 'era', 'good', 'quarter', 'century', 'ahead', 'curve', 'acting', 'terms', 'realism.I', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'A', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'near-great', 'only', 'thing', 'back', 'true', 'greatness', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'weak', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'greatest', 'quality', 'how', 'relevant', 'undated', 'film', 're', 'race', 'injustice', 'evil', 'society', 'so-called', 'justice', 'system', 'etc']",N/A

Essentially the question this film raises is if the correction system is designed to rehabilitate the offender or punish them for their alleged crimes against society.  Another question this film raises is that does this very same system create criminals out of individuals who are not predisposed to crime.  Interesting questions that we are still debating to this day which ultimately make this film timeless.  Credit director Mervyn LeRoy and writer Robert Burns for concocting an entertainment that also provides food for thought.

He received his first nomination in 1929 (""The Valiant"") and his last in 1959 (""The Last Angry Man""), and he won for his role in ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" (1936). His 1932 performance in ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" earned him his second nomination (he lost to Charles Laughton  in ""The Private Live of Henry VIII""). The film came out after the success of ""The Big House"" in 1931 (Wallace Beery), and was part of the early 30s interest in crime dramas (e.g., ""Public Enemy"", ""Little Ceasar"",  ""Scarface""). In fact, a few months before its release, David Selznick at RKO released ""Hell's Highway"" which was also based on a chain gang, but the film had little critical or commercial success and is mostly forgotten.There would be many chain gang flicks after this one. Most people agree that the best depiction was ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967). Other memorable chain gang films include ""Road Gang"" (1936), ""Take the Money and Run"" (1969), ""Chain Gang Women"" (1971), and ""The Longest Yard"" (1974)""Chain Gang"" features Allen Jenkins, one of those actors whose name you don't recognize but whose face you've seen 100 times.

Beginning in the 50s he appeared in dozens of TV shows, best remembered as Muggsy in ""The Red Skeleton Show"".The film was directed by Melvyn LeRoy who directed Edward G Robinson in ""Little Ceasar"" the year before. LeRoy directed dozens of films, the most memorable of which were ""Tugboat Annie"" (1933), ""Random Harvest"" (1942), ""30 seconds over Tokyo"" (1944), ""Mister Roberts"" (1954), and ""No Time for Sergeants"" (1958). He is perhaps best remembered as the man who introduced Ronald Reagan to Nancy Davis.""Chain Gang"" is based on a true story about Robert Elliott Burns' experience in a Georgia chain gang. It so outraged audiences that significant changes were made as a result. By 1937 chain gangs were outlawed in Georgia.While the picture focuses on the chain gang experience, the background is the Depression and the difficulties of finding work.

146236,A2TT4AA3QO0DPY,0792841018,Jay Young,"[0, 0]","Since we're in the midst of a crisis that is looking like the Great Depression in some ways, ""I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,"" released in 1932, is more relevant than ever. It's incumbent on people to understand how a social/economic crisis can affect individual lives.The plot is simple enough. It's about James Allen, a WWI veteran who one day goes with his friend Pete to a restaurant in an unnamed Southern state. Pete coaxes the owner into giving the two men a free meal, but then he pulls a gun and demands the owner's money, and that Allen himself get the money from the cash drawer. At that moment, the police burst in and shoot Pete, and since Allen is caught with the cash in his hand, he is arrested as an accessory. He is sent to a work in a chain-gang, that slave labor punishment that is once again becoming popular in the South, but manages to escape and flee to Chicago. Allen takes on an alternate identity and makes a good living as an engineer, and gets romantically involved with someone in the process. Eventually, his identity is discovered, and his extradition is demanded. Illinois refuses, but Allen agrees to go back to the chain gang, on condition that he be released in 90 days. He soon discovers that that was an empty promise, and has no choice but to escape again. I will say no more about the plot here, but the ending is one of the most effective and devastating in Hollywood history.Many movies in the 1930s were cloying and sentimental, but there was a large social protest genre during the same time period which sought to alert people to the problems going on around them, and ""I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang"" is arguably the best example of it. Of course, the film's main target is the chain-gang system, and the vengeful attitude of punishment that spawned it, which has not entirely gone away. But it also gives a glimpse of how the Great Depression affected individual people. The socio-economic situation now is very different from what it was in the 30s, but the kinds of problems people are facing now are very similar.

This is Paul Muni's best role, playing Paul Allen, the real life author of the book by the same name. In fact, as he wrote it, Allen was still being pursued & fearful of being returned to prison. This subject is red meat for Warner Bros. studio as they loved movies on the social ills of the time. They did take some liberties. Paul Allen was not the sterling character Muni played. For one he was not a decorated WWI hero. Also most interesting was the fact that the events in the movie took place right after WWI & in the 1920's. This was a time of  prosperity with lots of jobs & opportunity for a bright guy like Allen. But the movie was made during the very hard times of the depression & Allen became a vagrant, riding the rails, hungry & drifting from job to job thru-out the country. He also claimed he was innocent, which is taken as fact in the movie. Happily, this movie was also made before the infamous movie codes & Allen was able to enjoy a one-night stand with the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold. Warner Bros. did make some concessions, specifically with the state of Georgia. Apparently embarassed by their penal system & the corrupt nature of their government, Georgia was not mentioned as the place where Allen served his sentence.It is an amazing story of an innocent man that escapes, not once but twice from his tormentors. If you like the prison genre, you'll really like this.  One of the first, the best & a classic.

Maybe all kids pass through a phase where the idea of being held against one's will is particularly scary.  My therapist says this fear has two causes, one, that the infant remembers being in the mother's womb, farfetched as it seems, and the other, more reasonable, is that children resent their lack of agency, that is, when you're a child you're unable to do the things you want to do and thus feel imprisoned.  Actual prison time is but a way to turning the screws a bit, of actualizing these fears.  Paul Muni does an incredible job at representing everyman in this film, or every child, because his plight is something that all children can identify with-getting blamed for something that really isn't your fault.It isn't James Allen's fault either.  First, it's the Depression, then second, it's that other guy who forced him to rub the diner, the other guy who got shot and then Jim Allen gets fingered for the job.  In vain does he protest, I didn't want to do it!  Clearly such a scenario could happen to anyone, at any time.  It's the worst nightmare of the citizen.  All your rights prove to be flimsy, paper-thin trifles that at any time could be suspended.  Watching the DVD now, I flash back to nightmares of a restless youth, and also to today's political climate when any of us could find our civil rights stolen at any moment depending on the will of the electorate and the man on top.Muni hisses that he steals, before disappearing into the darkness, leaving wan Helen (""free, white, and twenty-one"") as abruptly as if he had died.  Helen Vinson, who plays the good-hearted Helen, is one of several fine Warners actresses who really shine here, very unusual for a prison-themed movie.  The women seem to sense that, since their screen time is limited, they better make the most of it.  Halfway through the movie, Muni changes his name, switches around his monicker from James Allen to Allen James.  It's subtle, but an indication that in modern life, everything is topsy-turvy now, surreal, ""ass-backwards.""

146246,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0792841018,mirasreviews,"[34, 36]","""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" is one of the most respected Depression-era ""social conscience"" pictures. The story was adapted from Robert Burns' autobiography ""I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang"", and Burns was an advisor on the film even though he was a wanted man at the time it was made. The film was released to great popular success less than a year after Burns' book was published. The story is essentially true, although some details have been changed. The real Robert Burns was perhaps a little less a victim than his character, James Allen, in the movie, and he was a magazine editor, not an engineer. Allen is a man who is consistently wronged in spite of trying to do right, and Depression-era audiences identified with his victimhood. Robert Burns was a crusader against the inhumanities of chain gangs, on which he was twice forced to serve. Instead of confining its themes to one cause, filmmakers made ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" into a platform for a host of social issues of the time, including unemployment, veterans' rights, the penal system, and the criminal justice system. Although most of the events of the film take place in the 1920s, the economic circumstances depicted in the film have been altered to reflect the hardships of the 1930s, when the film was made.James Allen (Paul Muni) is a World War I veteran returning home with high hopes of putting the engineering skills he learned in the Army to civilian use. He takes a factory job, but is reluctant to replace the routine of the military with that of the factory. So he travels the country in search of construction work but has trouble making ends meet. One evening, he accompanies an acquaintance to a lunch wagon for a hamburger. His friend tries to rob the proprietor, and James is sentenced to 10 years hard labor on a chain gang as his accomplice. On the chain gang. prisoners are beaten, starved, and sleep deprived, and James makes a successful escape. He ends up in Chicago, where his landlady, Marie (Glenda Farrell), blackmails him into marrying her with threats of exposure. But James works his way up from a laborer on a bridge project all the way to engineer and becomes a honored and affluent citizen of the city. When he threatens the free-spending and philandering Marie with divorce, she exposes James to the police. And things begin to repeat themselves.The social agenda of ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" is heavy-handed, but there is no denying the film's impact on audiences in 1932. And this film isn't nearly as political as some of the New Deal movies that would follow later in the decade, as it was made during the Hoover administration. It's just a very good example of ""social conscience"" filmmaking of the 1930s, made all the more interesting because the story is essentially true. Paul Muni gives a sympathetic performance as a bright, hardworking man who is trying to build America into a better nation as America keeps tearing him down. I have to mention Edward Ellis, a wonderful character actor of the 1930s who is memorable here as James' friend on the chain gang, Bomber. ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" was critically acclaimed, popular, and timely in the 1930s. It's also a very good film that fans of 1930s cinema won't want to miss.The DVD ( Warner Brothers 2005 release): This is a good print of the film, but it does not appear to be a restored print. There is an occasional white speck on the image, but picture and sound quality are basically good. Bonus features include a short film, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. The short film is ""20,000 Cheers for the Chain Gang"" (20 minutes), which is a comedic spoof of ""I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"". A zany group of convicts escape the chain gang only to try to return because the conditions have become luxurious in preparation for a review by the Governor's Committee. The audio commentary is by USC film professor Richard  B. Jewell. Jewell talks about the actors, making the film, the film's reception, and compares the life of the real Robert Burns to his fictional counterpart in the film. This is an informative, generally well-organized commentary that I recommend if you enjoyed the film.

It might be a little slow for today's audience and less rough than what's out there today but it wasn't at all for it's time. It came out in the early 1930s during the pre-code era and was one of the most controversial movies for it's time. It was actually based on a true story of Robert Burns who was wrongly convicted. James Allen (Paul Muni) has returned from WWI who has changed since and finds his job boring. He leaves home to find a job in Chicago but can't find anything. Soon sinking lower into poverty and staying at a homeless shelter in Georgia, he gets unintentionally involved in a robbery. Allen is wrongly convicted, sentenced to prison and put on a chain gang. He decides to escape after being mistreated and beaten by the warden. When he gets out, he goes by the name Allen James so he can get a job without anyone knowing. This time his work is appreciated and he gets promoted, making it back to the top eventually. It comes back to haunt him though when his landlord Marie (Glenda Farrell) finds out an blackmails him.Paul Muni (Life of Emile Zola, Scarface) was a great actor and gives his best role to date. Glenda Farrell (Little Caesar, Mystery Of The Wax Museum) gives a great supporting role, a little different from her usual but believable.

It falls into the realm of impressionable 'exploitation' films that attempted to substantiate struggling theaters with their wealthy competitors.  Warner Bros. looked for ""controversial"" themes to release them from their box office slump and found it with topics like this, packaging emotional rubbish into the screens in the form of low budget B grade ""content films"".  Anyone who thinks Warner Bros was a ""redeeming and caring company interested in the plight of man"" is deluded, they were merely out to make a profit, nothing more.  Examine their union records, dictatorial management and abuse of rights at the time if you don't believe me.  Surely, a film which pulls at your heart is only intended to pull at your wallet.The film itself has a weak script, stale acting (bordering on dull to over anxious), B grade direction, poor dialogue and is tedious.  It meanders through one half hearted empty skit after another, dislodging us from any sincere interest at all.  Muni is a boorish actor, neither disguising his brusque acting method nor elaborating on any convincing emotion.  Standard film shots are scattered throughout, of locations and events in history, a parade from WW 1, a real street scene in Chicago, and this further aggravates the authenticity of the whole subject, making the film look ""cut up"" because most of it was filmed on cheap Warner Bros sets in Pasadena. The chain gang scenes are unrealistic, exaggerated, and only attempt to garner instant condemnation from the viewer.  I don't need a mediocre film to instigate that ""chain gangs are evil"", I should know that from my own knowledge, and further more, this film contradicts itself because capitalism itself is slavery and there is so much insane dialog about the ""virtues of work"" in the beginning.  I fail to believe that there is a difference between a worker at a factory occupied for 12 hours a day like a slave and a man stuck on a chain gang!  An average film reduced by film historians and buffs to a ""classic"" merely because they can not understand why films had to make a profit for the capitalistic and authoritarian film companies which produced them.

146252,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0792841018,Reviewer,"[0, 0]","In a society known for freedom and justice, how is that justice truly measured and meted out?  When an individual's very life hinges on a verdict of innocent or guilty, is there such a thing as an objective call?  Or is a person's life subject to mere perception; a subjective evaluation of ""facts"" assimilated through a filter of bloated egos and personal agenda?  All questions that many, perhaps, would prefer not to have answered, nor indeed, even asked at all.  Those who are so secure in the absolutism of our justice system that they will willingly defer to the establishment in all matters, and with a clear conscience.  The ""system,"" after all, is infallible; or at least good enough, isn't it?  Good enough, that is, when it's being tested on ""someone else.""  But what if that glitch in the system becomes personal?  What if ""you"" are the one who falls victim to a miscarriage of justice, and your voice becomes impotent, grinding your pleas into so much pulp beneath the wheels of a machine to which you are nothing more than another insignificant cog?  It's a situation examined in the absorbing drama, ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,"" directed by Mervyn LeRoy, and starring Paul Muni.James Allen (Muni) returns home from WWI to find his old job in a shoe factory awaiting him.  But James is a changed man, with aspirations of doing something meaningful with his life; and he wants to put the experience he received in the Army-- in the Engineering Corps-- to use.  He wants to build things-- bridges, roads-- useful things.  And toward that end he sets out and scours the East Coast from north to south looking for work, but jobs are scarce.  Finally, having taken to ""walking the ties,"" the rail leads him into St. Louis, just another out-of-work bum in the eyes of society.  There he meets up with a guy named Pete (Preston Foster), who tells James he knows where they can get a hamburger as a hand-out.  The trusting and somewhat naive James goes along, only to find himself on the wrong end of a stick-up gone bad.From that point, the justice system moves swiftly, and James Allen finds himself sentenced to ten years at hard labor on a chain gang.  His offense?  Being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong guy.Based on the autobiographical story by Robert E. Burns, and written for the screen by Sheridan Gibney and Brown Holmes, LeRoy's riveting film is an inditement of the justice system-- specifically the brutality of the chain gangs-- but also of a society too smug and filled with self-righteousness to realize how fragile and tentative the freedoms we enjoy really are.  America is the greatest country in the world-- a veritable bastion of freedom-- but those who would throw out their chests while holding up the Constitution, citing whichever amendment it is that suits their personal agenda, should be made to walk a mile in the shoes of Robert Burns/James Allen.  Or for a start, be required to watch this film.Released in 1932, this film is devoid of the melodrama common to many films of this era, and instead presents the story in very realistic terms, the meaning of which is indisputable.  Like Hitchcock's unnerving 1957 film, ""The Wrong Man"" (also based on a true story), this film is not only disconcerting, but down-right scary when you stop to consider the implications of it.  It also evokes a sense of Kafka's ""The Trial"" (also made into a movie in 1963 by Orson Welles), but without the abstractedness; unlike ""The Trial's"" Joseph K., James Allen knows exactly what's happened to him and how.  What he can't understand is ""Why.""  Nor would any rational man, betrayed by the very society in which he placed his implicit trust, understand.Paul Muni gives a dynamic, stirring performance as James Allen, capturing all of the confusion, exasperation, pain and anguish of his inexplicable situation, all of which you can see in his expression, in his eyes and in his body language and demeanor.  You feel the darkness into which he is forced to descend, and with him you share that sense of hope fading away more with each passing day.  From the tension of the moment when he first attempts to ""Hang it on the limb,"" to what is one of the most haunting endings ever filmed, you're right there, living it with him.  It's a powerful, truly memorable performance by Muni.The supporting cast includes Helen Vinson (Helen), Noel Francis (Linda), Allen Jenkins (Barney), Berton Churchill (Judge), Edward Ellis (Bomber Wells), David Landau (Warden), Hale Hamilton (Rev. Robert Allen), Sally Blane (Alice), Louise Carter (Allen's Mother), James Bell (Red), William Le Maire (Texan), Edward Arnold (Lawyer) and Willard Robertson (Prison Commissioner).  In no way does this film exaggerate the situation it depicts; it doesn't have to.  In the end, ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" is a wake-up call of sorts, a warning to those who take personal freedom for granted or place too much trust in a flawed system mired in bureaucracy.  That a film made in 1932 can still have such an impact today says more than enough about how good it is.  And once you've seen it, you'll never forget that final, haunting scene, and James Allen's final words.",5,Powerful Performance by Paul Muni,1009065600,"12 23, 2001",2001,5193,"['society', 'known',

It revolves around a man named James Allan (Paul Muni), a solider from WWI who comes out wanting more out of life than just working in a factory. He sets out to find work in engineering, a skill he gained from the military. He finds work, but it is sporadic and soon he finds himself stealing rides on trains to get to the next town. As a bum, he meets a guy (Preston Foster) who gets him involved in a small robbery at a diner, guaranteeing him a spot in a chain gang. In the gang, everyone is treated badly, and when Allan has enough, he finds a way to escape. He is more successful than one might think and finds himself rising in the engineering field under the name Allan James. In order to save himself from the chain gang, he marries a blackmailing cheat named Marie (Glenda Farrell). However, he soon finds himself caught again.Paul Muni is excellent in this film. He uses his haunted, attractive eyes quite well to his advantage; he never loses the look of youth in his eyes despite all the hardships his character endures. Muni is especially good in his emotional scenes, being sure never to overact.Glenda Farrell is good in her part. Her face looks like the face of a woman who used to be beautiful but who has deteriorated like her soul over time.This DVD includes a commentary over the film, a theatrical trailer, and a short called 2000 Cheers For the Chain Gang, a comical musical short about a chain gang.

146256,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,0792841018,Simon Davis,"[5, 5]","I always find a viewing of ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" a soul wrenching experience and it never fails to leave me stunned and slightly uneasy that man could be so incredibly cruel to their fellow man.The film without a doubt is one of the most significant and brutally honest depictions of life on the chain gangs of the 1920's and 1930's. I'm glad the film was made by Warner Bros in the early thirties bacause not only was the topic still fresh but Warners were expert at portraying gritty and emotional situations with all the surface verneer stripped off. Indeed ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" never glamourises the story of one man wrongly convited of a crime he didn't commit and who finds himself sentenced to the living hell of life in one of America's notorious chain gangs. Not only the lack of justice offered is explored but also the almost unspeakable brutality that all the prisoners are subjected to. The film never flinches from displaying the soul destroying and totally degrading de- personalisation that the men go through in the course of their backbreaking work on the mountains and highways they are clearing.Paul Muni is nothing short of brilliant in the lead role of James Allen the man wrongly accused on a petty crime who experiences the unendurable nightmare of life on the gangs and who seeks to escape, seeing any existence as better than that he is living. Rarely has Muni been more suited to a role and his progression from naive innocent to a hardened member of the chain gang is both compelling and brilliantly portrayed. Muni had a way of actually getting under the skin of most of the characters that he played and here he expertly conveys the anguish of a man wrongly accused who seeks proper justice only to find that system betray him and sentence him to a second term on the gangs.There are so many memorable and thought provoking moments in ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"". Notable scenes include the muster first thing in the morning of all the prisoners, the miserable rotten food they are forced to eat, the back breaking work that they perform day in day out, the ongoing cruelty by the guards towards the men, and the scenes during Muni's illfated attempts to escape and make a new life for himself.So many other performers also shine in this production as well. Notable among them are Glanda Farrell as Marie who plays the conniving wife of Muni who eventually betrays him to the authorities after he has built a new life for himself. Hers is a vicious and despicable performance and indeed was one of the best Farrell ever did. Allen Jenkins also shines in the role of Muni's elderly pal on the chain gang Barney, a character that has seen it all and has basically resigned himself to a life time of suffering. His performance is tragic yet brutally honest at the same time and his eventual death is a heart wrenching experience to witness on screen.As stated previously the movie has a harsh and gritty look and feel to it. Any sentiment is stripped to the bone and the production benefits greatly from the terrific on location photography that was employed, in particular in the scenes of the chain gangs working on the highways and on sides of mountains. It gives the film a dull and honest feel, as though we were almost there with the men. Theawe inspiring scope of the story really fills the viewer with a feeling of the awesome sense of hopelessness that these unfortunate men must have experienced.I often wonder if such a confronting film as this released at the time it was did any good in getting the running of these gangs reviewed. One would certainly hope so as it shows quite clearly that it only brulaised men and didn't help to reform them and send them back to society as useful citizens.I cannot recommend ""I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" highly enough. It is a splendid motion picture that really makes you think and stuns with its superb central performance by Paul Muni. It is one of the very best social justice films of the 1930's or of any decade for that matter.For Paul Muni's work alone in this film, of which he is the heart and soul, it is worth having in your film collection and it deserves multiple viewings.",5,"Stark And Compelling View Into Our Quite Recent History,",1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,4208,"['always', 'find', 'viewing', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'A', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'soul', 'wrenching', 'experience', 'never', 'leave', 'stunned', 'slightly', 'uneasy', 'man', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'incredibly', 'cruel', 'fellow', 'man.The', 'film', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'brutally', 'honest', 'depictions', 'life', 'chain', 'gangs', '1920', '1930', ""'m"", 'glad', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'early', 'thirties', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'topic', 'still', 'fresh', 'Warners', 'were', 'expert', 'portraying', 'gritty', 'emotional', 'situations', 'surface', 'verneer', 'stripped', 'off', 'Indeed', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'A', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'never', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'wrongly', 'convited', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'who', 'sentenced', 'living', 'hell', 'life', 'one', 'America', 'notorious', 'chain', 'gangs', 'Not', 'only', 'lack', 'justice', 'offered', 'explored', 'also', 'almost', 'unspeakable', 'brutality', 'prisoners', 'are', 'subjected', 'film', 'never', 'displaying', 'soul', 'destroying', 'totally', 'degrading', 'de-', 'personalisation', 'men', 'go', 'course', 'backbreaking', 'work', 'mountains', 'highways', 'are', 'clearing.Paul', 'Muni', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'lead', 'role', 'James', 'Allen', 'man', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'petty', 'crime', 'who', 'unendurable', 'nightmare', 'life', 'gangs', 'who', 'escape', 'seeing', 'existence', 'better', 'living', 'Rarely', 'Muni', 'been', 'more', 'suited', 'role', 'progression', 'naive', 'innocent', 'hardened', 'member', 'chain', 'gang', 'compelling', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Muni', 'had', 'way', 'actually', 'getting', 'skin', 'most', 'characters', 'played', 'here', 'expertly', 'anguish', 'man', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'who', 'proper', 'justice', 'only', 'find', 'system', 'betray', 'sentence', 'second', 'term', 'gangs.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'thought', 'provoking', 'moments', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'A', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'Notable', 'scenes', 'include', 'muster', 'first', 'thing', 'morning', 'prisoners', 'miserable', 'rotten', 'food', 'are', 'forced', 'eat', 'back', 'breaking', 'work', 'perform', 'day', 'day', 'ongoing', 'cruelty', 'guards', 'men', 'scenes', 'Muni', 'illfated', 'attempts', 'escape', 'make', 'new', 'life', 'himself.So', 'many', 'other', 'performers', 'also', 'shine', 'production', 'as', 'well', 'Notable', 'are', 'Glanda', 'Farrell', 'Marie', 'who', 'conniving', 'wife', 'Muni', 'who', 'eventually', 'authorities', 'built', 'new', 'life', 'Hers', 'vicious', 'despicable', 'performance', 'indeed', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'Farrell', 'ever', 'did', 'Allen', 'Jenkins', 'also', 'role', 'Muni', 'elderly', 'pal', 'chain', 'gang', 'Barney', 'character', 'seen', 'basically', 'resigned', 'life', 'time', 'suffering', 'performance', 'tragic', 'yet', 'brutally', 'honest', 'same', 'time', 'eventual', 'death', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'experience', 'witness', 'screen.As', 'stated', 'previously', 'movie', 'harsh', 'gritty', 'look', 'feel', 'sentiment', 'stripped', 'bone', 'production', 'benefits', 'greatly', 'terrific', 'location', 'photography', 'was', 'employed', 'particular', 'scenes', 'chain', 'gangs', 'working', 'highways', 'sides', 'mountains', 'film', 'dull', 'honest', 'feel', 'were', 'almost', 'men', 'Theawe', 'inspiring', 'scope', 'story', 'really', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'awesome', 'sense', 'hopelessness', 'unfortunate', 'men', 'must', 'have', 'experienced.I', 'often', 'wonder', 'confronting', 'film', 'released', 'time', 'was', 'did', 'good', 'getting', 'running', 'gangs', 'reviewed', 'One', 'would', 'certainly', 'hope', 'so', 'quite', 'clearly', 'only', 'brulaised', 'men', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'reform', 'send', 'back', 'society', 'useful', 'citizens.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'A', 'Chain', 'Gang', 'highly', 'enough', 'splendid', 'motion', 'picture', 'really', 'think', 'stuns', 'superb', 'central', 'performance', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'social', 'justice', 'films', '1930', 'decade', 'matter.For', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'work', 'alone', 'film', 'heart', 'soul', 'worth', 'having', 'film', 'collection', 'multiple', 'viewings']",N/A
146257,AK61LQI92GTCH,0792841018,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[12, 14]","Good movies tend to make bad history and I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG, a great movie, is no exception.I AM A FUGITIVE is the story of James Allen, a character closely modeled on the real individual named Robert Burns, who, along with two other men, in 1922 robbed an Atlanta grocer of $5.80  Burns was tried, convicted, and sentenced to serve six to ten years of hard labor on a Georgia chain gang.  After only a couple of months into his sentence Burns escaped and fled to Chicago, where he found a good measure of success.  Burns married into some money and, within a few years, was a respected and somewhat influential member of society.  During this time Burns founded and edited the real estate trade magazine, Greater Chicago Magazine.Then, fate decreed, his life was to change again.  Burns fell in love with another woman and asked his wife for a divorce.  At this point his wife, who had some knowledge of Burns' troubled past, reported him to authorities.  Georgia sued for extradition and, after some negotiations which, according to Burns, included a promise of an early parole, Burns returned to Georgia and her notorious chain gang in July, 1929.  Slowly realizing that an early release was unlikely, 14 months into his internment Burns escaped the chain gang for a second time.  Fugitive Burns sold his story to True Detective magazine, where it ran as a serial and was soon published as a book, a best-seller, entitled I am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang.The movie is based on Burns' best-selling book, although in the movie Burns is named James Allen and he's a decorated vet with dreams of becoming an engineer.  At every turn the character is buffed, burnished, and elevated by the filmmakers.  The guy can't do no wrong in the movie.  The real life Burns, after his first escape, apparently married into some wealth.  The movie's James Allen is a self-made man saddled with a shrewish wife.  No big deal, but the movie pounds into us the notion that Allen is a darn good egg, a self made man fighting the odds who had some of the awfulest breaks you could imagine.The accomplished actor Paul Muni throws his heart and soul into the role of James Allen and, in so doing, pretty much seals the deal.  The righteous purity of Allen's character isn't the main issue anyway.  The chain gang system defined cruel and unusual punishment and director Mervyn LeRoy captures its dehumanizing brutality with astonishing force.  Given the censorship practices of the time it's just this side of a miracle that I AM A FUGITIVE retains such power.  Film historian Richard Jewell, in some detail, discusses the problems posed by a stricter code for a movie of this type.  He also goes into quite a bit of detail about the real life character the movie was based on.  If you like background histories of stars and stories above film deconstruction you'll love Jewell's informative commentary.The print is in good shape and the ending is, in my opinion, one of the most powerful in film history.  Mervyn LeRoy is usually described as a competent, but something of a journeyman, director.  Although he's somewhat dismissed because of his lack of a distinctive auteur style, he had a heck of a lot of great movies to his credit.  I'm a sucker for strong endings, and I AM A FUGITIVE and another LeRoy movie, LITTLE CAESAR, have terrific closing scenes.Also included on the dvd is the 20-minute Vitaphone musical-comedy short ""20,000 Cheers for the Chain Gang.""  It's very goofy, with miniature French poodles acting as bloodhounds and the inmates barracks infested with lace doilies, tuxedoed inmates, and scantily clad chorus girls.

146258,A2JVR4P3BPDWNK,0792841018,"The Queen of Noirs ""I'm no stinkin' princess""","[3, 3]","This crackerjack movie is from the same mold as ""Brute Force"" in that is exposes the ugly brutality of prison life in all it's hideous, nasty glory. Our protagonist is falsely accused of a crime, is sent to the chain gang, escapes, becomes a model citizen, gets ratted out by the femme fatale, believes a southern lawyer's promise, gets sent back to the chain gang again, becomes angry and hardened and escapes again. Great story, well filmed, with truly brutal depictions of chain gang life. Paul Muni is excellent. The story structure presages ""Cool Hand Luke"" in a big way.However, I also see this movie as a precursor to the film noir genre. We have the hapless protagonist who is dragged down by the cold hand of fate. We have the stock femme fatale with her finger in her mouth. We have the good girl who wants to save him. There is the inevitability of Fate. The major difference is that the protagonist, James Allen, is not disillused and cynical as the movie starts. This has changed by the end of the movie where our upstanding citizen has been transormed into an almost subhuman paranoid criminal fading into the darkness who's haunting final line is truly electifying.

146259,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,0792841018,trebe,"[1, 1]","Supposedly based on the true experiences of a prisoner in Georgia's penal system, I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang (1932) is a simply told tale about a man swept up by circumstances, into a life on the run from the law.Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, unfairly earns ex-soldier James Allen (Paul Muni) a ten year jail sentence at hard labor.  Allen is sent to a prison where the prisoners are locked in chains, and taken out to work on road crews, swinging pickaxes and sledgehammers in the hot sun.  Like any other prisoner, Allen has to quickly adapt to the brutal conditions, or die.  Fellow prisoner Bomber Wells (Edward Ellis) befriends him, and helps educate him about prison life.Allen endures the hardships, hoping to be released after serving a year, but when that doesn't happen, he decides to escape.  Allen succeeds in escaping the chain gang, and eventually winds up in Chicago, where he begins to work his way up the ranks in a construction company.  His landlord, a woman named Marie (Glenda Farrell) learns that he is a fugitive, and blackmails him into a marriage.  Later Allen meets a woman named Helen (Helen Vinson) and falls in love, but when he asks Marie for a divorce, she turns him into the authorities.Having turned his life around and become a success, Allen puts his trust in the system and agrees to return to prison, with the belief that he will serve a short sentence as a trusty, and then be pardoned.  Unfortunately when back in the State's clutches, James finds himself in an even tougher prison, and back on the chain gang with his old pal Bomber Wells.  Once again, James has faith in the system, doing hard labor while waiting to be pardoned.  Once again he is royally screwed, when the parole committee tables his case indefinitely.  In what was a pretty spectacular escape for its time, Allen and his buddy Wells take off in a dump truck, in a bold escape attempt, with Sykes dropping dynamite to try and discourage the pursuit.  After blowing a bridge, Allen manages to escape for a second time.After nearly a year on the run, James Allen returns to Chicago and catches a glimpse of Helen, exchanging a few brief words.  Looking like a ghost, apparently doomed to live in fear and on the run, he fades away into the shadows.  Paul Muni gives a very good performance, as cruel injustices suffered by James Allen touch the heart.  Most of the other characters are simple and one dimensional, either good or bad.  This does not prevent the film from making its point, as the `evil' that is being pointed out is not a particular person, but a cruel and abusive penal system that treats men like slaves.  While perhaps regarded as simplistic now, the story is still compelling, and the film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Paul Muni's performance for best actor.",4,a tragic story of a man who trusted the system...,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2829,"['Supposedly', 'based', 'true', 'experiences', 'prisoner', 'Georgia', 'penal', 'system', 'Am', 'Fugitive', 'A', 'Chain', 'Gang', '1932', 'simply', 'told', 'tale', 'man', 'swept', 'up', 'circumstances', 'life', 'run', 'law.Being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'unfairly', 'ex-soldier', 'James', 'Allen', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'ten', 'year', 'jail', 'sentence', 'hard', 'labor', 'Allen', 'sent', 'prison', 'where', 'prisoners', 'are', 'locked', 'chains', 'taken', 'out', 'work', 'road', 'crews', 'swinging', 'pickaxes', 'sledgehammers', 'hot', 'sun', 'other', 'prisoner', 'Allen', 'quickly', 'adapt', 'brutal', 'conditions', 'die', 'Fellow', 'prisoner', 'Bomber', 'Wells', 'Edward', 'Ellis', 'educate', 'prison', 'life.Allen', 'hardships', 'hoping', 'be', 'released', 'serving', 'year', 'when', ""n't"", 'happen', 'escape', 'Allen', 'escaping', 'chain', 'gang', 'eventually', 'up', 'Chicago', 'where', 'work', 'way', 'ranks', 'construction', 'company', 'landlord', 'woman', 'named', 'Marie', 'Glenda', 'Farrell', 'fugitive', 'marriage', 'Later', 'Allen', 'woman', 'named', 'Helen', 'Helen', 'Vinson', 'love', 'when', 'Marie', 'divorce', 'authorities.Having', 'turned', 'life', 'around', 'become', 'success', 'Allen', 'trust', 'system', 'return', 'prison', 'belief', 'will', 'serve', 'short', 'sentence', 'trusty', 'then', 'be', 'pardoned', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'back', 'State', 'clutches', 'James', 'even', 'tougher', 'prison', 'back', 'chain', 'gang', 'old', 'pal', 'Bomber', 'Wells', 'Once', 'again', 'James', 'faith', 'system', 'doing', 'hard', 'labor', 'waiting', 'be', 'pardoned', 'Once', 'again', 'royally', 'screwed', 'when', 'parole', 'committee', 'case', 'indefinitely', 'what', 'was', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'escape', 'time', 'Allen', 'buddy', 'Wells', 'take', 'off', 'dump', 'truck', 'bold', 'escape', 'attempt', 'Sykes', 'dropping', 'dynamite', 'try', 'discourage', 'pursuit', 'blowing', 'bridge', 'Allen', 'escape', 'second', 'time.After', 'nearly', 'year', 'run', 'James', 'Allen', 'Chicago', 'glimpse', 'Helen', 'exchanging', 'few', 'brief', 'words', 'Looking', 'ghost', 'apparently', 'doomed', 'live', 'fear', 'run', 'away', 'shadows', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'very', 'good', 'performance', 'cruel', 'injustices', 'suffered', 'James', 'Allen', 'touch', 'heart', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'simple', 'one', 'dimensional', 'either', 'good', 'bad', 'not', 'prevent', 'film', 'making', 'point', 'evil', 'being', 'pointed', 'out', 'not', 'particular', 'person', 'cruel', 'abusive', 'penal', 'system', 'men', 'slaves', 'perhaps', 'regarded', 'simplistic', 'now', 'story', 'still', 'compelling', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'several', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'including', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'performance', 'best', 'actor']",N/A
