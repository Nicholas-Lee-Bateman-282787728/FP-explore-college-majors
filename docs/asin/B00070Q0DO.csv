It's late in 1946, and the US is just getting back onto a peacetime footing: the stores are full of merchandise, but there's a housing shortage that beats anything.  Newspaperman and veteran Jim Bullock (Don DeFore) becomes a victim of it when the building in which he was living is slated to be torn down to make room for a new corporate skyscraper.  Homeless, he meets a charming old tramp, Aloysius T. McKeever (Victor Moore), whose custom it is to move into luxurious homes when the owners are away for the season, and who is currently living in the huge Fifth Avenue mansion of self-made industrialist Michael J. O'Connor (Charles Ruggles).  When he invites Jim to join him, Jim eagerly accepts, seeing it as suitable revenge on O'Connor, whose skyscraper was the doom of his apartment.  Before they know it, though, they're being joined by a whole congregation of other displaced folk, including O'Connor's daughter Trudy (Gale Storm), who has run away from her boarding college and is seeking work under an alias; two service pals of Jim's (Alan Hale Jr., Edward Ryan Jr.) with their wives (Dorothea Kent, Cathy Carter), a small son, and an infant; and, ultimately, O'Connor himself (incognito) and his divorced wife Mary (Ann Harding).  As they create a family in his mansion, O'Connor begins to realize what he's lost by giving more and more of his attention to making money, and while no supernatural agency takes a hand and the holiday itself is only peripherally part of the story, he definitely undergoes a reformation at least as major as Ebenezer Scrooge's.  The picture of a bygone era will be almost as interesting to today's viewers (most of whom, of course, are Boomers and their descendants) as Dickens's England, and the cast, especially DeFore, Storm, and Ruggles, does its job very well.",4,Improvising in Manhattan,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1952,"['sort', 'modern', 'American', 'version', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'least', 'was', 'probably', 'intent', 'people', 'responsible', 'late', '1946', 'US', 'just', 'getting', 'back', 'peacetime', 'footing', 'stores', 'are', 'full', 'merchandise', 'housing', 'shortage', 'anything', 'Newspaperman', 'veteran', 'Jim', 'Bullock', 'Don', 'DeFore', 'victim', 'when', 'building', 'was', 'living', 'slated', 'be', 'torn', 'make', 'room', 'new', 'corporate', 'skyscraper', 'Homeless', 'charming', 'old', 'tramp', 'Aloysius', 'T.', 'McKeever', 'Victor', 'Moore', 'custom', 'move', 'luxurious', 'homes', 'when', 'owners', 'are', 'away', 'season', 'who', 'currently', 'living', 'huge', 'Fifth', 'Avenue', 'mansion', 'self-made', 'industrialist', 'Michael', 'J.', ""O'Connor"", 'Charles', 'Ruggles', 'When', 'Jim', 'join', 'Jim', 'eagerly', 'seeing', 'suitable', 'revenge', ""O'Connor"", 'skyscraper', 'was', 'doom', 'apartment', 'know', 'though', ""'re"", 'being', 'joined', 'whole', 'congregation', 'other', 'displaced', 'folk', 'including', ""O'Connor"", 'daughter', 'Trudy', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'boarding', 'college', 'seeking', 'work', 'alias', 'two', 'service', 'pals', 'Jim', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'Edward', 'Ryan', 'Jr.', 'wives', 'Dorothea', 'Kent', 'Cathy', 'Carter', 'small', 'son', 'infant', 'ultimately', ""O'Connor"", 'incognito', 'divorced', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Ann', 'Harding', 'create', 'family', 'mansion', ""O'Connor"", 'realize', 'what', 'lost', 'giving', 'more', 'more', 'attention', 'making', 'money', 'supernatural', 'agency', 'hand', 'holiday', 'only', 'peripherally', 'part', 'story', 'definitely', 'reformation', 'least', 'as', 'major', 'Ebenezer', 'Scrooge', 'picture', 'bygone', 'era', 'will', 'be', 'almost', 'interesting', 'today', 'viewers', 'most', 'whom', 'course', 'are', 'Boomers', 'descendants', 'Dickens', 'England', 'cast', 'especially', 'DeFore', 'Storm', 'Ruggles', 'job', 'very', 'well']",N/A

It's a poignant, contemplative tale.Sadly, the basic story is ruined with the film's screenplay.  It's scattered and meandering, continually dragging one's attention away from the basic story.  It introduces far too many characters, each with a story of their own.  It has so many sub-plots zig-zagging around that the viewer can never predict what likely will happen next.  These drawbacks give the impression that this screenplay went through a lot of re-writes and countless writers, each adding their own focus.As a result all these uneccessary twists and turns,the film felt like it was 4 hours long and mind-numbing.

In the aftermath of WWII, many vets are having trouble finding work and affordable housing for their families in NYC, and Jimmy Bullock (Don DeFore) hatches a plan to purchase and renovate local barracks into apartments. A homeless drifter, Aloysius McKeever (Victor Moore), has made a comfortable life for himself by squatting in Fifth Ave. mansion while its magnate owner, ""the second richest man in the world"", winters in Virginia. McKeever has a good heart, and he provides a home for the vets while they work out their plan. Meanwhile, the magnate's daughter (Gale Storm) has run away from her school, and falls in love at first sight with Jimmy, who has no idea that she comes from wealth. What plays out is a warm-hearted comedy of role-reversal, in which the magnate (Charles Ruggles) finds the heart that he'd encased in granite long ago.The casting department did itself proud by assembling these actors, who play very well against each other. The real star is Victor Moore, who masterfully pulls off  the role of tramp living like king without overplaying a single scene. There are many funny moments, and some schmaltzy ones as well.

876449,A1H7Y5XKPGT0OS,B00070Q0DO,"Rama Rao ""Rama""","[0, 1]","Every year during the Christmas season, I enjoy watching some of the best from my Christmas movie collection. It feels great to watch, again and again, such classics as; It's a Wonderful Life, Scrooge (starring Seymour Hicks), Miracle on 34th Street (starring Maureen O'Hara), White Christmas, Bishop's Wife, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Home Alone, Home Alone2, Christmas Wife (starring Jason Robards) and even movies set in Christmas times, such as; Apartment, Holiday (starring Cary Grant & Katharine Hepburn),  Little Women (starring Katharine Hepburn), Christmas in Connecticut, Meet me in St Louis, Desk Set and Night & Day. This movie, `It Happened on 5th Avenue' is set in winter in New York, partly around the Christmas season. This is reminiscent of Frank Capra-style dynamics; in some way similar to the all-time classic, ""It's a wonderful life.""The story is set in New York during the housing crunch just after the WWII. Folks, including many war veterans, find any way they can to have an affordable accommodation, especially during the winter. A drifter named Aloysious T. McKeever, a.k.a. Mac (Victor Moore) solves his housing problem by staying in a luxury home belonging to a wealthy investor named, Michael O'Connor (Charles Ruggles), when O'Connor stays in Virginia during winter, and his ex-wife Mary O'Connor (Ann Harding) resides in Florida. The devious scheme of Mac work so well that he invites new homeless folks like war veteran Jim Bullock (Don DeFore), and his war-buddies, Hank and Whitey and their families. When O'Connor's daughter, Trudy O'Connor (Gale Storm) enters her father's house, the ""free-loaders"" think that she is a run-away. She plays along with them as another homeless girl, and soon starts to enjoy the company of the new residents, and eventually falls in love with Jim Bullock. When O'Connor arrives in New York and finds Trudy leaving for her new job at a music shop, he insists that she must go back to school. Trudy expresses her love for Jim Bullock to her father. O'Connor agrees to meet Jim, and reluctantly agrees to pose as a drifter, and becomes a ""house guest,"" doing menial chores which he is not accustomed to. Finally O'Connor gets frustrated and tries to call the police, in the meantime Trudy sends for her mother. Mary O'Connor joins the household as another ""hobo"" and then rekindles her love for her ex-husband. On Christmas Eve, Mac encourages them to get married unaware of their true relationship. Eventually all turns well after Mary makes Michael O'Connor realize that money is not everything. He accepts Jim as his son-in-law, and helps him and his war buddies, Whitey and Hank to buy Camp Kilson and renovate the vacant army barracks into housing projects.In the final analysis, in the spirit of Charles Dickens, the ""Christmas-spirit of the Past"" of O'Connor doesn't have much in his future. The ""Christmas-spirit of the Future"" scares him when he sees the ""light"" through the eyes of his wife and realize that he was immersed himself in his financial world and completely forgot how beautiful Mary is and what he missed all these years, the true happiness of married life.I was hoping to see a little more Yuletide spirit; Christmas wreaths decorating the walls of churches, homes, shops, buildings and streets. Christmas trees, singing Christmas carols in the background, women and children shopping for the holidays in New York, and the whole atmosphere of celebration as we see in the movie ""Home Alone."" Unfortunately this is absent; director Roy Del Ruth missed a great opportunity to make this a true classic, but he is able to show the tender side of human nature using writers who have put their minds and hearts.

Gale Storm is the daughter of the third richest man in America(Charles Ruggles); she is in love with Don DeFore's character, and somehow this homeless guy who has the keys to all the rich folks homes gets in there while the owner's are away. In this case, the owner really didn't go away, he gets picked up by Storm, DeFore and the homeless guy and they bring him home for the holidays. Of course, the man is mad as heck over these folks in his house, but for the happiness of his daughter, he keeps the peace. Things heat up even more when his ex wife (Ann Harding) comes to visit and they reconcile, but the other folks don't know about the real identities of Storm, Ruggles and Harding. DeFore also is trying to get army posts to convert into much needed housing but Ruggles is stopping the show in the background, but in time, along with the Christmas season, things change his heart and love prevails. a cute little film that can be watched on TCM for the holidays.
