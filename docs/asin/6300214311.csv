211838,A3O8PRRQT3DPF8,6300214311,A. Anderson,"[4, 6]","Okay picked up the new re-issue of FRIDAY THE 13TH in 3-D recently and felt I HAD to share this with other fans who are waffling on whether or not to pick this triple-dip up or not.First, let me say I have a copy of the old Japan-issued Polarized version (this requires the powered polarized glasses not the current red/blue paper things) and while it was a dubdown (the orig release in Japan was only on VHS) the 3-D was leaps and bounds better then this new release. Ok to be fair, I know it isnt very practical to release the old 3-D version in that format as it would require everyone to go out and spend at least $60-$130 on a pair of glasses to view it. So, with the recent release of some 3-D films in the new 3-D versions on home video(JOURNEY TO CENTER OF THE EARTH, POLAR EXPRESS etc) I figured it won't be too awful when redone in the red/blue format will it? The answer is both yes and no.First off this new re-issue of the film lays claim on the cover to be from an HD Source? Well, where is the Blu Ray then (Grrrrrrr). And this new print of the film is FILTHY DIRTY! I mean the old one in the box set was speckly and dirty, but this print is waaaaay granier and just plain AWFUL. Somehow they have managed to make the film look like a bad VHS dub down on dvd! Setting aside the dirty elements problem, the new 5.1 mix on the audio? Sorry compared it to the box set original audio mix, didn't notice a dang thing that was any different.But what of the 3-D you ask? How was that? Well, for the most part it offers some good 3-D dimension and does remind me a little of what it was like in the theater (I saw the film in 3-D back in 1983 at least 18-20 times) but not even close to the clarity. You see ghost images bleed off to the other parts of the image and its kinda messy. But the worst sin of all?! If you saw it originally in 3-D in theaters, you know how ultra cool the opening credit sequence is as it shoots out of the decapitated eye sockets of Mrs. Voorhees' head on the table. The credits literally shoot out and are right in front of your face (I do not exaggerate, this was waaaay better than any other 3-D movie has done before or after). Well what did Paramount decide to do? Well since the beg of PART 3 is a brief recap of the end of PART 2, they put a brief note onscreen that the beginning is not in 3-D. So the 3-D doesn't begin now until AFTER the credits are over!!!! In theaters, the 3-D begins with the shot of Amy Steel and BF outside out of the cabin (they are in front of it) and then we cut back to inside of cabin as Jason gets wakes and grabs his machete and gets up as we go to Mrs. Voorhees' head and the credits pop out of her eye sockets straight at you, out of the screen. All that is gone now, not even recreated for this 3-D version. Sad, very sad indeed. Lazy actually is a better word.Now you are wondering, how are the extras? Well, on this release we get a trailer for the 3-D version of the film that ran originally in theaters. And, err... thats it. You don't even get the actor audio commentary from the box set and this is a stand alone release asking you to buy it again?!?! Huh?So, in short, until we get that new Japanese 3-D home television technology over here, this 3-D version will have to do. Still, with the disappointments, one would have hoped for more pimped up extras, but seeing how it is Paramount (AKA cheap and no extras) its hardly surprising.Hope this helps some of you decide on this one. My opinion, rent it if you can and then quickly return it!",2,DIRTY PRINT AND FAKE 3-D DISAPPOINTING AT BEST,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,3527,"['Okay', 'picked', 'up', 'new', 're-issue', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH', '3-D', 'recently', 'felt', 'HAD', 'share', 'other', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'waffling', 'not', 'pick', 'triple-dip', 'up', 'not.First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'copy', 'old', 'Japan-issued', 'Polarized', 'version', 'powered', 'polarized', 'glasses', 'not', 'current', 'red/blue', 'paper', 'things', 'was', 'dubdown', 'orig', 'release', 'Japan', 'was', 'only', 'VHS', '3-D', 'was', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'better', 'then', 'new', 'release', 'Ok', 'be', 'fair', 'know', 'isnt', 'very', 'practical', 'release', 'old', '3-D', 'version', 'format', 'would', 'require', 'everyone', 'go', 'out', 'spend', 'least', '60-', '130', 'pair', 'glasses', 'view', 'So', 'recent', 'release', '3-D', 'films', 'new', '3-D', 'versions', 'home', 'video', 'JOURNEY', 'TO', 'CENTER', 'THE', 'EARTH', 'POLAR', 'EXPRESS', 'etc', 'figured', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'awful', 'when', 'redone', 'red/blue', 'format', 'will', 'answer', 'yes', 'no.First', 'new', 're-issue', 'film', 'claim', 'cover', 'be', 'HD', 'Source', 'Well', 'where', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'then', 'Grrrrrrr', 'new', 'print', 'film', 'FILTHY', 'DIRTY', 'mean', 'old', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'speckly', 'dirty', 'print', 'waaaaay', 'granier', 'just', 'plain', 'AWFUL', 'Somehow', 'have', 'managed', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'bad', 'VHS', 'dub', 'down', 'dvd', 'Setting', 'aside', 'dirty', 'elements', 'problem', 'new', '5.1', 'mix', 'audio', 'Sorry', 'compared', 'box', 'set', 'original', 'audio', 'mix', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'dang', 'thing', 'was', 'different.But', 'what', '3-D', 'ask', 'How', 'was', 'Well', 'most', 'part', 'good', '3-D', 'dimension', 'remind', 'little', 'what', 'was', 'theater', 'saw', 'film', '3-D', 'back', '1983', 'least', '18-20', 'times', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'clarity', 'see', 'ghost', 'images', 'bleed', 'off', 'other', 'parts', 'image', 'kinda', 'messy', 'worst', 'sin', 'saw', 'originally', '3-D', 'theaters', 'know', 'how', 'ultra', 'cool', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'decapitated', 'eye', 'sockets', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'head', 'table', 'credits', 'literally', 'shoot', 'out', 'are', 'right', 'front', 'face', 'do', 'not', 'exaggerate', 'was', 'waaaay', 'better', 'other', '3-D', 'movie', 'done', 'Well', 'what', 'did', 'Paramount', 'decide', 'do', 'Well', 'beg', 'PART', '3', 'brief', 'recap', 'end', 'PART', '2', 'put', 'brief', 'note', 'onscreen', 'beginning', 'not', '3-D', '3-D', ""n't"", 'begin', 'now', 'AFTER', 'credits', 'are', 'theaters', '3-D', 'begins', 'shot', 'Amy', 'Steel', 'BF', 'cabin', 'are', 'front', 'then', 'cut', 'back', 'cabin', 'Jason', 'wakes', 'grabs', 'machete', 'up', 'go', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'head', 'credits', 'pop', 'eye', 'sockets', 'straight', 'screen', 'gone', 'now', 'not', 'even', 'recreated', '3-D', 'version', 'Sad', 'very', 'sad', 'indeed', 'Lazy', 'actually', 'better', 'word.Now', 'are', 'wondering', 'how', 'are', 'extras', 'Well', 'release', 'get', 'trailer', '3-D', 'version', 'film', 'ran', 'originally', 'theaters', 'err', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'actor', 'audio', 'commentary', 'box', 'set', 'stand', 'alone', 'release', 'asking', 'buy', 'again', 'Huh', 'So', 'short', 'get', 'new', 'Japanese', '3-D', 'home', 'television', 'technology', 'here', '3-D', 'version', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'Still', 'disappointments', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', 'more', 'pimped', 'up', 'extras', 'seeing', 'how', 'Paramount', 'AKA', 'cheap', 'extras', 'hardly', 'surprising.Hope', 'decide', 'one', 'opinion', 'rent', 'can', 'then', 'quickly', 'return']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

I do not wish to invest in a Blue Ray player because i feel that it is prototype technology, like the old Laserr Disk players, (ive still got mine.).If i buy a Blue Ray now. Something far better will be here in about 5 years.Second. The 3-D works fine, on a computer, TV, whatever. This is really surprising since its in the Red/Blue stereo-vision format. The original was done using the gray lensed glasses that were polarized. So the had to adapt it to this format. A digital 3-D version, with the flickering shutter glasses was released in Japan.This version has one drawback The opening credits arent in 3-D, and they most definitely were in theoriginal release, and they are on the Japan disc release. Also, the first few minutes, stock sequence fromPart 2 does not have the 3D process. In the original version it had a double image that created a sort of""phoney"" 3D effect. Though not in the full ""POP out at you"" 3D process. It did have a sense of depth to itand the new inserted shot of Jason pulling the machete out of his arm was in full 3D.

211844,A89MGH1RHEOQN,6300214311,Adam Paul Bailey,"[4, 4]","Friday the !3th part 3 is easily the best film in the series. It is fast paced, especially with the chase scene at the end where Jason pursues Chris through the cottage and barn.There are twelve murders or so in this picture, all attributed to Jason: a woman is lying on a hammock and a knife goes through her throat, a man is walking on his hands and gets split in half by Jason's machete and then is later wrapped around a rafter.I just read a review about this picture saying that Jason was not the killer in the original Friday the 13th that Mrs Voorhees was. But I think it was both of them. For starters, when Annie,a camp counsellor gets a ride from probably Mrs Voorhees,realises her ride goes past a turnoff to Camp Crystal Lake and keeps going, she jumps from the car and runs into the forest. There she runs into a man(if you look closely you will see it is a man and not a woman) who slits her throat. Later, towards the end of the film, Jason throws the body of a camp counsellor through a window, and it is not til later that Mrs Voorhees turns up in her Jeep, meaning that Jason probably did a couple of the murders.

211845,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,6300214311,A. Gammill,"[23, 27]","Getting old is hell.  It's true.  You see, I'm old enough to have seen Friday the 13th Part 3 in the theater back in 1982.  There were a handful of pretty bad 3-D movies made during that brief resurgence of the fad.  Believe it or not, this was actually the best of them.  The film took full advantage of the process, poking every possible object, body part, etc. at the screen.  All in polarized 3-D.  Polarized?  Well, I don't know all the technical details, but the glasses were tinted gray, instead of the old-style red and blue that was used during the early 1950's heyday of 3-D movies.  A polarized 3-D movie doesn't just have depth; things literally pop off the screen and, at times, would appear to be inches from your face.Sadly, this 3-D release of Friday the 13th Part 3 is NOT the same picture I saw all those years ago.Apparently, the polarized process can't be recreated for the home screen (not yet, anyway. . .if you'd told me ten years ago I'd be able to store thousands of songs on a gadget the size of a cigarette lighter, I'd have called you crazy).  So what we have here is a sort of ""remixed"" cut of the film, with the old-school glasses.  And all the headaches those involve.Disappointments aside, it's not a complete waste.  The film itself was made to have depth (as in the third dimension of depth, not the philosophical kind!), and many scenes translate fairly well.  The more notorious shock scenes (SPOILERS AHEAD) involving a spear gun and an eyeball rushing toward the camera come pretty close to duplicating the original format's intensity.  Objects in the background often suffer some blurriness--hence the possibility of headaches--and the print itself is surprisingly grainy in spots.The film itself is no better or worse than any of the FRIDAY sequels.  But if you were lucky enough to have the film as intended on the big screen, you will almost certainly be disappointed with this presentation.

211846,AJ7PN0MNUEXCL,6300214311,"A guy loving talented guys ""Chaka Cenk""","[2, 6]","First of all I am bored to death reading all these complaints about 3-D. Anyone without any clue about the movie could not have any decent idea about its substance unless he went back ten or eleven pages to find any nugget of information about it. Almost all reviews are blah blah blahs about 3D. Yes you have the right to complain about it but I don't think it merits four to five huge paragraphs about the wisdoms and atrocities of 3D technology or whatsoever without anything about the content of the movie.That said, this is the worst of the series I have watched so far. I had watched the first two ones years ago and the second one (the ending of which starts up this drivel) still thrills me. But this one, despite the introduction of famous hockey mask, loses all the steam of the first two. Yes there are several corpses around, yes there are interesting killing styles but characterization is far worse than the first two and all are butchered in a way faster than before, almost back to back without any tension, any chase whatsoever. A man enters into a barn and is killed finished! A man steps out of the room upside down on his hands and is killed finished! Yes this is a slasher movie but wouldn't it be nice if we had some nice chase scenes? No, Jason appears, slashes and the business is finished. No tension whatsoever.Secondly (I guess because he now dons a mask) Jason walks around as if he was another member of the team. He runs around like a housekeeper; I almost expected him in one scene to chat with the victim girl; as if he would come and drink tea. So overt, so obvious, nothing subtle. The first two had some subtlety at least. When you see the killer that clearly, you only watch it to pass the scene. After all you know that he will kill whatever happens.After this nonsense and laughable romantic dialogues are passed, the only good bit starts: The scenes involving the heroine, Chris and Jason are the only strength of the movie.

There's nothing new or different with this one, but it is still a pleasing slasher/horror film. There is no plot whatsoever. It's just another bunch of horndogs shacking up at a cabin in the woods and you know who is there. Surprised?. Of course not. The only historical thing about Part 3 is that it was originally in 3-D(not on video, sadly). Plus, it was also the introduction to Jason's hockey mask. The heroine, played horribly by Dana Kimmell, was a history with Jason. Apparently she was attacked by him a while back after she ran into the woods after having a fight with her parents. Whatever. Anyways, the film is violent and bloody as expected. There's even a murder scene that is very reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's demise in the original. The biker gang in this film are the only ones who do good jobs. Everyone else is pretty bad. Still, I like this movie. It's not the best Friday film, but it's up there.

211857,A3D1W9DU4XB30Q,6300214311,Bobby,"[3, 3]","I'm not gonna lie, Friday the 13th Part 3 is not only my favorite film of the series, but it's probably my favorite film from the golden age of slasher films.Exactly one day after the massacre in Friday the 13th Part 2, Chris and her friends decide to spend the weekend at Higgins Haven which sits directly on Crystal Lake. Jason who's perfectly ok after his fight with Ginny the night before, watches the friends from a creepy barn. And it's not until night falls where he finally makes his move. Will anybody survive the night?Friday the 13th Part 3 is the film where Jason gets his hockey mask for the first time, and in a scene that is clearly the ""I am your father"" moment of the series, Jason makes his entrance with the iconic hockey mask for the first time. The way it done is absolutely perfect. It's almost like they knew this was a special moment, not only in the series, but in pop culture in general. Richard Brooker (RIP) made one heck of a good Jason too. People mention how great Kane Hodder was all the time, but Brooker is right up there with him.But for me, what really makes this film so good is it's characters. Very rarely in slasher movies are a group of characters as great as they are here. Not only are they a bit more mature than the norm, but they actually seem like a real group of friends. Every single of them is likable in their own way, and you're actually sad when Jason starts to knock them off. Sure you can say Chris is no Ginny, but really it's the supporting cast which makes the film in this one. For example one of my favorite relationships in the film is between Vera and Shelley. I'd even go as far as saying their storyline is somewhat touching! I always liked the scene where Vera looks at the picture in Shelley's wallet. Even after all the times throughout the day he's annoyed her with his jokes, it shows that she does seem to care about him on some level.Another great relationship in the film is between Andy, and again Shelley. Andy is this real good looking athletic guy, and Shelley is this overweight and mostly misunderstood outcast. Even so, Andy sees Shelley as his best friend (a pairing you'd never see be friends in 99 percent of other slasher movies), and I really like the scene early on where Shelley's like ""would you be yourself if you looked like this?"". Andy gives him a supportive smile, and pat on the back, and it's just a nice moment :). Speaking of Andy , his girlfriend Debbie is the series only pregnant character (something incredibly rare in slasher movies in general), and I liked how later on in the film she changed her mind about having a beer. It's something small, but it showed a lack of stupidity you see in most movies like this. Sure there's a couple of misplaced stoners in here, but they're also likable, and I like that they're in the movie.Overall it's good to see a slasher movie that wasn't afraid to actually make their characters likeable and caring. It does wonders for the film.To top it off we get one heck of a good final chase scene that rivals the one from part 2, and some really good special effects/3D sequences.The movies rated R. The kills are more brutal then they are gory (The MPAA did make them cut this a bit like the others), and the film also has a scene of sexuality, and brief nudity.Overall Friday the 13th Part 3 is my favorite film from a series that I'm a huge fan of.

I did not see this film in theatres in 3-D.  And I wish I had.  But on DVD it's just as good without.  This is propably the most frightening film in the series.  Jason is scarier then ever before.  The murders are propably the goriest and the most scary of the original four.It is one day after the events in Friday The 13th Part 2, and now, mad killer Jason Voorhees is on the loose.  Meanwhile, a new group of teenagers have decided to stay for a weekend at Camp Higgin's Haven, a few miles from Camp Crystal Lake.  However, Chris, our heroine, is not looking forward to the trip.  Two years earlier she suffered a traumatic shock and is going to Higgin's Haven to face her personal demons.  Her boyfriend, Rick, is a little bit annoyed with her, and attempts to get her back to her normal self.  Meanwhile, Jason arrives at Higgin's Haven, and the murders begin.Part 3 has more little subplots that are a nice little touch.  There's also much, much more humor than before (my personal favorite charecter is Shelly).  Now, as you all know, since the film was shot in 3-D, many objects are thrown at the screen.  Some people think this is annoying.  I don't mind.  Without the 3-D the film still stands on it's own as scary, maybe more scary. I would vote for #3 as the scariest of the series, because it is.

That's really important because when it comes to a slasher film, you have to actually care if these people live or die, and this one succeeds better in that regard than just about any other slasher I've seen.  Oh, they're the usual bunch of teenagers, smoking dope and having sex, but they each have a unique personality and are very sympathetic.  Also, some of the scenes are actually kind of ""scary"", especially the one where the hippie guy goes into the basement to turn the electricity back on.  Then there's the great ""disco"" theme music, and all the goofy 3-D shots - the film was shown in 3-D in theaters, but the DVD is NOT in 3-D - but you still get all sorts of things thrust in the direction of the camera that were supposed to jump out at you when it was in 3-D.  Jason is especially good in this one, like some crazed maniac, just like he's supposed to be.The picture quality is exceptionally good, the film looks like it could have been made last year.  The sound quality also seems a bit better than on the first two movies.  On those movies, the sound seemed quite thin, on this one it's more full and rich.  Certainly no Dolby 5.1, but for a mono track it's quite satisfying.Overall, if you like slashers from the '80s, this is about as good as it gets.  I would have given it 5 stars but it goes too light on the T&A.;  Really odd considering the movie teases us with a couple of scenes, but don't blink or you'll miss what little there is to see.

In 1982, director Steve Miner brought us another sequel entitled, Friday The 13th Part 3, Steve Miner's second turn in directing a Friday The 13th film, his first being 1981's Friday The 13th Part 2.In this horrifying chapter, which starts off by showing what happened at the end of the second film, Jason (played by Richard Brooker) goes on to feed on more victims. Now, this sequel is sort of a continuation of the last film, just like Halloween 2 continued on from the first Halloween. First, Jason stumbles onto a married couple named Harold and Edna. Harold is an insecure man, who allows his b*tch of a wife order him around. Edna watches the news and find out about the murders from the second film (when this film is actually taking place only a day after the second film). At that moment, Harold comes running into the house to ""make a call to nature"". He finishes his bathroom business, but he hears a strange noise coming from outside the bathroom door. He opens the door and Jason knocks him off, where Jason then kills Edna.The next morning, a van pulls up into a nice looking neighborhood. Inside the van are Chris Higgins (played by Dana Kimmell), Debbie (played by Tracie Savage), Andy (Jeffrey Rogers), Shelley (played by Larry Zerner), and potheads, Chuck (played by David Katims) and Chili (played by Rachel Howard). They are on their way to Chris' family cabin in Camp Crystal Lake for the weekend. Right now, they're stopping to pick up Vera Sanchez (played by Catherine Parks), a girl who is going along as a date for Shelley. Shelley is very insecure about his looks and weight. In order for him to get people to like him, he has to scare the ever-loving sh*t out of them.The friends pull up to the cabin, where Chris is greeted by her boyfriend, Rick (played by Paul Kratka). After another Shelley-scaring-the-hell-out-everyone joke, Vera and Shelley drive off to the grocery store to get some food for the weekend, where they have a run-in with three bikers named, Ali (played by Nick Savage), Loco (played by Kevin O'Brien), and Fox (played by Gloria Charles). Shelley pays them back with revenge, but not before the bikers follow them back to the cabin, where they plan to set the kids' barn on fire. Before they even have a chance to burn the place, Jason takes care of business with the three of them.That night, Chris and Rick go for a long ride, just to catch up on things. Chris hasn't seen Rick for two years, since she hadn't gone back until now. Her reason: she was attacked by Jason and nearly killed by him. As she tells Rick the story of her terrifying ordeal, their car breaks down, `causing them to walk back to the cabin.At the cabin, Debbie and Andy have a little fun in the sac, until Debbie goes to get a shower. Andy goes for a beer, but is evilly greeted by Jason. Debbie finishes her shower and goes to bed, but she is then killed by Jason. Shelley again scares the crap out of Vera, this time where an old goalie mask. He goes off into the barn, all hurt from the way Vera yelled at him. But Shelley does not come back out; Jason comes out, wearing the goalie mask. He finds Vera and shows her how to play darts with just her left eye.Chuck and Chili also greet their demise. Chris and Rick return, but Rick is suddenly killed by Jason. Chris is all alone to battle Jason. She battles him in the barn. As she battles Jason, Ali suddenly appears to be alive. He tries to help Chris out, but Jason really finishes him off. As he kills Ali, Chris grabs an axe and jams it into Jason's forehead. He drops down to the ground and appears to be dead. It is then where Chris realizes that Jason is the one who attacked her all those years ago.Chris then goes off into a canoe and falls asleep. She wakes up and is relieved to find that morning has arrived. She finds Jason still alive and is running after her. As she tries to sail away with the canoe, she finds that she was only hallucinating. But at that moment, Mrs. Voorhees' dead body jumps up out of the lake and grabs Chris violently and pulls her underneath the water. But Chris is lucky to find that it was only dream. Chris is unlucky in the fact that she has gone completely mental from this whole ordeal.I told you twice before: no more camping until Jason is finished having his fun.

Both ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Friday the 13th Part 2"" look excellent and filmic on Blu-ray with appropriate amounts of grain and so on. (Read my reviews for those individual titles.)""Friday the 13th Part 3"" on Blu-ray (BD) continues the trend of offering up this series in the best quality possible. However, this BD does not get a perfect 5-star rating from me, unlike the previous two releases. Not that the BD itself doesn't transfer the film accurately--it does--but the problem lies within the film's original photography. To achieve the 3D effect, certain filming processes were required. (I couldn't give you the technical know-how on this, however.) What you get is a film that looks rather cheap and corny in 3D, as all 3D films did (and in my opinion still do, even with the advances in technology).When viewed in 2D, you can clearly tell that the movie was filmed for 3D. The 3D effect is missing, so the perspective is awkward, and the photography looks quite a bit blurred, especially on the sides. Again, this is inherent to the original photography and not the HD transfer itself, so I can't fault the Blu-ray for this.Taking all that into consideration, the BD looks far more filmic and representative of the original film than any DVD releases. Far better clarity of detail, with excellent grain structure and color reproduction.

Chris Higgins, along with her pals Shelly, Debbie, Andy, Vera, Chuck and Chili, returns to her family cabin, called Higgins Haven, the first time since she was attacked by a disfigured man two years earlier. Already at the cabin is Chris's boyfriend, Rick (who is way to old for her).Shelly (the goofball of the group) and Vera run into a group of bikers briefly. The bikers follow them to the cabin, where the bikers attempted to burn down the barn, but Jason is hiding there and he gets rid of them. While Chris and Rick go out for a drive, one by one Jason slaughters her friends Then he slips on the hockey mask for the first time.I vividly recall watching Friday the 13th part 3 for the first time when I was around eight or nine on a Saturday afternoon. Even though it was heavily cut, I instantly became a fan of the series. Several years ago, around Halloween, my local Walmart had 1 through 8 on DVD for five dollars each. At the time I didn't have the money to buy them, but to my surprise I received the DVDs as a Christmas present from my parents. I take them out and watch them around Friday the 13th or Halloween. The fourth, third, second and sixth movies are my favorites out the series.Part 3 was originally released in 3D, which wasn't technology developed as it is now. The 3D version was released on DVD a few years ago, but I only have the 2D version. The opening credits suffer from it, and there are a few instances where an object is forced toward the audience.

Sawin,"[3, 3]","Chris and her friends just want to have a good time this weekend, so they're taking a trip to her family's nice, relaxing family cabin in Higgins Haven. Unfortunately for them, Jason survived his encounter with Ginny from the last film. He winds up at a store where he kills a married couple and gets a change of clothes. Higgins Haven just happens to be close by. Chris has more than one reason for going on this trip though. She was attacked a few years ago by a hideously disfigured man and is facing her fears in hopes of moving past it. Could this mysterious man and Jason have something in common?This is the film that introduced us to the hockey mask and was originally in 3-D. It's a shame that's all it really offers though. Watching the 3-D version now will just leave you with a horrible headache. I actually prefer the film in 2-D. The nudity in the film is also rather light and before you jump on me for saying that, that's one of the main things you look forward to in a Friday the 13th film; Jason Voorhees, inventive kills, T&A;, and maybe a few laughs. That's what makes the Friday the 13th films fun. Especially compared to the first two films, sideboob and a brief glimpse in the shower doesn't really cut it. I guess what really ruined it for me was the homages to the first film. By the way, what was up with the ending? And why does Mrs. Voorhees suddenly have her head again? It wasn't a bad idea to do a few throwbacks to the original, but it felt like too much by the end of the film.Rating - 5/10",3,The Hockey Mask Legend is Born,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,1523,"['Chris', 'friends', 'just', 'want', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'weekend', ""'re"", 'taking', 'trip', 'family', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'family', 'cabin', 'Higgins', 'Haven', 'Unfortunately', 'Jason', 'survived', 'encounter', 'Ginny', 'last', 'film', 'up', 'store', 'where', 'married', 'couple', 'change', 'clothes', 'Higgins', 'Haven', 'just', 'be', 'close', 'Chris', 'more', 'one', 'reason', 'going', 'trip', 'was', 'attacked', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'hideously', 'disfigured', 'man', 'facing', 'fears', 'hopes', 'moving', 'Could', 'mysterious', 'man', 'Jason', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'film', 'introduced', 'hockey', 'mask', 'was', 'originally', '3-D', 'shame', 'really', 'Watching', '3-D', 'version', 'now', 'will', 'just', 'leave', 'horrible', 'headache', 'actually', 'prefer', 'film', '2-D', 'nudity', 'film', 'also', 'rather', 'light', 'jump', 'saying', 'one', 'main', 'things', 'look', 'forward', 'Friday', '13th', 'film', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'inventive', 'kills', 'T', 'A', 'maybe', 'few', 'laughs', 'what', 'Friday', '13th', 'films', 'fun', 'Especially', 'compared', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'sideboob', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'shower', ""n't"", 'really', 'cut', 'guess', 'what', 'really', 'ruined', 'was', 'homages', 'first', 'film', 'way', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'ending', 'why', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'suddenly', 'have', 'head', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'idea', 'do', 'few', 'throwbacks', 'original', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'film.Rating', '5/10']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"
211883,AODDKGNNV7AG2,6300214311,"Cult DVD Hunter ""Rico""","[1, 2]","Whew! Paramount wasn't wasting any time making sequels for this series! Part 3 as released just one year after part 2 (same period of time between the original and the sequel) but I must admit, this time there were some upgrades. First off, I must remark that this movie was originally called Friday The 13th Part 3: 3-D because it was presented in theatres in 3-D, which explains many of the odd focuses on objects pointed at the screen.The third movie decides that maybe rebuilding the camp again is just a little too far feched for now, so instead we get a group of young adults (which is funny because the hippy couple looks like they're in their forties and the youngest looking couple seems very casual with the fact that they're having a baby) going to a cabin for the weekend on Crystal Lake. Jason's back in this film and this time he gets to finally get his hands on the famous hockey mask that will stay with him as his signature for future films. This cast is a little more tight knit than the others in that they all kinda stick together. Eventually Jason makes his way through all of the characters until there's only one left standing, Chris (female). Jason's stronger this time around and it's he's a lot more convincingly strong than his Part 2 version (the hockey mask also adds to this drastically).This installment was actually much better than the criticism it recieves. I know, it's annoying to see all the wierd 3-D shots and at times it can take focus away from the action, but remember that they didn't film it for the purpose of 2-D home viewing. The characters are more developed in this film than any other, the writer this time around allowed us to actually connect with most characters before we violently take them out. The gore is getting better, complete with the scene where Andy is cut in half! Chris is a whiney and traumatised girl, even before enduring a showdown with Jason, but it's mostly from her fears of encountering Jason in the past (we get a brief flashback sequence). Jason is also bigger, badder, and stronger, now taking a fifteen foot drop onto a noose and getting up almost immediately to fight. What I liked most about this film was that it introduced and layed the groundwork for the Jason that we see in every other movie from here on.The DVD is still staying standard, nothing too special going on here but still an improvement from the SLP grainy versions for rent on VHS. The video is clean (almost too clean when you see the famous eye-popping scene) and the audio is crisp and clear (and still in 2.0). I must admit that although I don't think there's an &quot;uncut&quot; version of this either, I am disappointed in the lack of a 3-D option (C'mon, Shrek 3-D is only 15 mins and sold a million copies!). Deleted scenes or an &quot;uncut&quot; would also be cool to see as the new degree of violence in this movie makes me wonder what the MPAA didn't approve.I would give the same advice to this installment as I did to Part 2, which depends on the type of viewer you are. If you are an avid Jason fan, pick it up, it won't let you down (too much). As far as a 3-D version, the boxed set won't have it and this version doesn't either (maybe in the future, but don't hold your breath, Paramount is making it pretty clear that since Jason is a New Line franchise now that it isn't all that focused on him). If you're just a horror fan, you may want to watch it first. Not necessarily in need of its own disc but may not be a reason to go for the boxed set, either.",3,Jason gets an upgrade: Protective Head Gear,1091664000,"08 5, 2004",2004,3523,"['Whew', 'Paramount', 'was', ""n't"", 'wasting', 'time', 'making', 'sequels', 'series', 'Part', '3', 'released', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'part', '2', 'same', 'period', 'time', 'original', 'sequel', 'must', 'admit', 'time', 'were', 'upgrades', 'First', 'must', 'remark', 'movie', 'was', 'originally', 'called', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '3', '3-D', 'was', 'presented', 'theatres', '3-D', 'many', 'odd', 'focuses', 'objects', 'pointed', 'screen.The', 'third', 'movie', 'maybe', 'rebuilding', 'camp', 'again', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'feched', 'now', 'so', 'instead', 'get', 'group', 'young', 'adults', 'funny', 'hippy', 'couple', 'looks', ""'re"", 'forties', 'youngest', 'looking', 'couple', 'very', 'casual', 'fact', ""'re"", 'having', 'baby', 'going', 'cabin', 'weekend', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'Jason', 'back', 'film', 'time', 'finally', 'get', 'hands', 'famous', 'hockey', 'mask', 'will', 'stay', 'signature', 'future', 'films', 'cast', 'little', 'more', 'tight', 'knit', 'others', 'kinda', 'stick', 'together', 'Eventually', 'Jason', 'way', 'characters', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'standing', 'Chris', 'female', 'Jason', 'stronger', 'time', 'lot', 'more', 'convincingly', 'strong', 'Part', '2', 'version', 'hockey', 'mask', 'also', 'drastically', '.This', 'installment', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'criticism', 'know', 'annoying', 'see', 'wierd', '3-D', 'shots', 'times', 'can', 'take', 'focus', 'away', 'action', 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'purpose', '2-D', 'home', 'viewing', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'developed', 'film', 'other', 'writer', 'time', 'around', 'allowed', 'actually', 'connect', 'most', 'characters', 'violently', 'take', 'out', 'gore', 'getting', 'better', 'complete', 'scene', 'where', 'Andy', 'cut', 'half', 'Chris', 'whiney', 'traumatised', 'girl', 'even', 'enduring', 'showdown', 'Jason', 'mostly', 'fears', 'encountering', 'Jason', 'past', 'get', 'brief', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'Jason', 'also', 'bigger', 'badder', 'stronger', 'now', 'taking', 'fifteen', 'foot', 'drop', 'noose', 'getting', 'up', 'almost', 'immediately', 'fight', 'What', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'introduced', 'layed', 'groundwork', 'Jason', 'see', 'other', 'movie', 'here', 'on.The', 'DVD', 'still', 'staying', 'standard', 'nothing', 'too', 'special', 'going', 'here', 'still', 'improvement', 'SLP', 'grainy', 'versions', 'rent', 'VHS', 'video', 'clean', 'almost', 'too', 'clean', 'when', 'see', 'famous', 'eye-popping', 'scene', 'audio', 'crisp', 'clear', 'still', '2.0', 'must', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quot', 'uncut', 'quot', 'version', 'either', 'am', 'disappointed', 'lack', '3-D', 'option', ""C'mon"", 'Shrek', '3-D', 'only', '15', 'mins', 'sold', 'million', 'copies', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'quot', 'uncut', 'quot', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'cool', 'see', 'new', 'degree', 'violence', 'movie', 'wonder', 'what', 'MPAA', 'did', ""n't"", 'approve.I', 'would', 'give', 'same', 'advice', 'installment', 'did', 'Part', '2', 'type', 'viewer', 'are', 'are', 'avid', 'Jason', 'fan', 'pick', 'up', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'As', 'far', '3-D', 'version', 'boxed', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'version', ""n't"", 'either', 'maybe', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'breath', 'Paramount', 'making', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Jason', 'New', 'Line', 'franchise', 'now', ""n't"", 'focused', ""'re"", 'just', 'horror', 'fan', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'need', 'own', 'disc', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'reason', 'go', 'boxed', 'set']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"
211884,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300214311,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Some fans name this as their favorite Friday the 13th film - but I'm not one of them.  Sure, Jason finally gets the hockey mask and really gets his slashing groove on, but there's no denying the fact that the silliness factor that marred the series as a whole began here.  Dope-smoking hippies and the world's worst and dweebiest practical joker definitely lowered my expectations early on, and the whole deal with opening the movie with an extended flashback of the climactic moments of the last film had already gotten old (plus, in this case, those events really have very little to do with the story as it unfolds here), so I was in a three-star mood about halfway through the action.  Jason really stepped up to the plate, though, delivering some pretty cool kills.  Maybe, just maybe, I might have been tempted to go all the way up to five stars if this were the original 3-D version released in theaters, but it's not (the 3-D version is apparently available only in Japan) - but I doubt it because I have a few issues with the film's blood and gore.  Regrettably, the film's best blood and gore had to be edited out in order to avoid an X rating, which is just silly.  Then you have the fact that two of the murders feature some of the fakest special effects you're likely to see.  As it is, I give the film four stars - thanks largely to Jason's standout work.Having escaped an attack from a deformed, mad killer a year earlier, Christy (Dana Kimmell) comes back to the property to prove something to herself, but all she really proves is that she's an idiot.  Of course, she's apparently oblivious to the fact that Jason had just killed a gaggle of camp counselors the day before (although her old boyfriend Rick, being a local, certainly should have heard something about it).  Personally, though, if I ever drive up on an old coot sleeping in the middle of the road who proceeds to get up, shove a fresh human eyeball in my face, and warn me to go back where I came from, I'm turning around, brother.  Of course, all of Christy's friends are either too young or too stoned to worry about their mortality, especially when there's sex to be had just down the road.So, basically, Jason has decided to hide out in a barn near Higgins Haven (and, despite what should be a massive manhunt for yesterday's Crystal Lake massacre killer, no cop even shows up to peruse the nearby lakeside property).  Upon arrival, Christy and her friends go into basic slasher film mode - with some hooking up, some getting high, and some taking a drive so that they can arrive back home right after Jason has killed all of their friends.  You know the drill.  This time around, the designated oddball is Shelly (Larry Zerner); not being the best-looking fellow around (not by a long shot), he keeps trying to impress the ladies by playing stupid practical jokes (as if the old machete-in-the-head joke ever impressed a woman anywhere on the face of the earth).  At one point, he even sports a wetsuit, underwater harpoon spear (huh?), and - wait for it - a hockey mask.I believe this film was originally intended to be the final film in the series.  That is the only rationale I can come up with to explain the conclusion, which I found worthy of a few boos.  Not only are there some logistical problems involved with the whole idea, its payoff moment is of a distinctly ""been there, done that"" nature that pretty much backfires, in my opinion.

211885,A3O0GQ6YB0CX3H,6300214311,Daniel Siciliano,"[4, 4]","I remember seeing this film in theaters back in '82. This was the height of the ""Friday the 13th"" craze and 3-D was making a comeback. The re-release of the '53 classic ""House of Wax"" with Vincent Price and ""Comin' at Ya"", helped spark some reinterest in this forgotten format. Soon, Chicagoland TV viewers would get ""Revenge of the Creature"" in 3-D on local horror show ""Son of Svengoolie"" (A Historic TV event, even if it didn't look all that 3-D ish!)and ""Jaws 3-D"" and ""Amityville 3-D"" would soon follow in theaters all over the country. Friday the 13th part 3, boast the first film that Jason sports his famous hockey mask, taken from a victim. The killings are typical, the characters are what you would expect from a slasher film, dumb, curious to a fault and just in the wrong place at the wrong time. All that aside, this film is a ""cut"" above the rest, well done, creepy and fun. If you take these films for what they are, 80's slasher flicks, and you're in the right frame of mind (not sure what that is), you will enjoy this film. The transfer is typical paramount from the era, slightly grainy, but overall good pix quality. Not too much in the extras dept, just the theatrical trailer, (They could have put in a few more trailers for the other films). One thing, I do remember the title sequence being in 3-D as well, but, it is presented here flat, or in 2-D, and the 3-D starts after the opening sequence and titles. The 3-D glases that accompany this DVD are made to look like ""Hockey Masks"", pretty neat.

From a slow Part 1 and 2 nobody expected to see this as a decent horror movie but in  fact it wasn't that bad. Jason gets his murdermask in this one, the famous  hockeymask. More humour is added in this suspenseful slasher thriller with  3D effects, which at the time in the early eighties was a real plus.  Probably one of the best of the series but the plot still remains the same-  a group of libidinous teenagers despite warnings enter the bloody Camp  Crystal only to be stalked upon one by one.

211887,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6300214311,Dave. K,"[2, 3]","Of all the Friday the 13th movies this one is my favorite of the series and would possibly make my top 50 favorite horror films. You know those movies you like a lot more than you should? Well Friday the 13th Part 3 is that movie for me. Sure this is your typical slasher flick with the typical horror movie characters, but there is just something about this movie I love.By this time a formula for what worked well with this franchise was found and the makers were sticking to it. Even with the knockoff films that were being released around the same time the early Friday the 13th movies were able to edge them out and be a lot better. The biggest thing this movie has going for it is; this is the first time Jason wore the famous hockey mask.Screenwriters Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson actually try and elevate the screenplay to be more than the typical stalk and slash movie. They seemed to have a few ideas, but it just wasn't quite there yet. I think this is one of the better written ones of the series, which granted isn't saying much, but Kitrosser and Watson do try and make more of the movie. There really isn't much in the way of plot, but than again this series isn't known for that. This one probably has the least amount of plot, but with that said is also has a little more than some of the others.The characters mostly lack any depth, but they do come across as real people and that helps make up for the lack of character development. There were some interesting ideas presented, but weren't explored enough. There was a back-story with the character Chris and how she encountered Jason a couple of years back. The concept seems like it's going to lead to something, but it never comes about. I did hear that an original idea was a sexual assault and if you pay close attention to the dialog early it does seem like that was a direction the movie was heading.But come a certain point the idea is dropped, which isn't a bad thing and we find out how Jason attacked her. Despite not really going anywhere it actually works in the favor of the movie and helped give Chris more depth. There was also a back-story with Rick and Chris, which normally in these movies feels very out of place, but it works rather well and adds some more depth to Chris and even a little bit for Rick that subplot could have been a disaster, but works well as does the story with Shelly and Vera; another one that could have been a disaster worked well.That is why I go back to the script having some decent ideas. Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson had some good ideas with the Chris character and overall they had a good idea with the movie. It seems like they had some interesting ideas, but never fully developed it. The script though is simple and that is what helps it work.Director Steve Miner is able to create plenty of atmosphere and looming dread; he manages to use his setting to his full advantage. In Friday the 13th Part II, Steve Miner very much followed what Sean Cunningham did with the original. In Friday the 13th Part III it seems he took some influence from John Carpenter. The shots of Jason watching and waiting to strike remind me a lot of Halloween; instead of being a carbon copy, Miner is also able to add his own style. While I liked what he did with Friday the 13th Part II, I felt he did much better here.Steve Miner has made some enjoyable movies, but the problem with him is he doesn't really have an original idea he mostly follows what other filmmakers do, and this time around I do think he owes a bit to John Carpenter, but he is able to at times inject a little bit of his own style. Steve Miner has done some fairly good work in his career and while he isn't an Icon of the genre he has done a little more than people might realize.Horror flicks work best when the characters are isolated and Miner gets the job done there. The pacing of the movie was done quite well. Once things slow down too much there is a shot of Jason, which helps keep the tension going strong. The kill scenes were effective and set up quite well done as well.As stated before the characters come across as real people and I think are all quite likable. Friday the 13th Part III features my favorite characters of the series and some of my favorites in a horror flick. To be honest this is one of the few horror movies where I liked all the characters.The acting wasn't bad either; what people seem to forget is this is a slasher movie Oscar worthy performances really wouldn't fit. The actors all do a fine job with their characters and come across as real people and that for me made me like the movie even more since when they died I felt bad for them.Dana Kimmell who played Chris was by far my favorite character of the series and quite honestly might be my favorite character in a horror movie. I really just loved her character. Chris made a very strong and likeable heroine, while vulnerable also stepped up and fought back with everything she had in her.Richard Brooker made an excellent Jason; he was big and strong but still had some human qualities to him. Richard Brooker is by far my favorite Jason. In my personal opinion Richard Brooker was by far the scariest Jason. I loved his movements and even at times his fun in killing and his frustration.The scene with the spear gun was a classic moment. There are two reasons for that. For starters it's the first time Jason appears with the mask on and 2nd after he kills Vera he just walks away like it was nothing. I found Richard Brooker very creepy at times.When it comes to horror movies the final act is so very important. A great horror movie could be ruined by it and an average horror movie could suddenly become much better cause of it. In my opinion the final act of Friday the 13th Part 3 just might be the most solid of the whole series. The first sequel had a good chase scene, but it was pretty much shot for shot the same thing as the first, even the way it was edited was the same.The overall atmosphere for the final chase between Chris and Jason can be quite creepy. We all know horror flicks work at their best when the characters are isolated in a certain area and when you only have the killer and the intended victim in the isolated area it's even better. What made it work so well wasn't just Steve Miner's directing, but Chris being vulnerable, but not too scared to fight back, and Jason was quite creepy. The barn scene when Jason can't find Chris and he starts getting frustrated was a great scene, which now might look out of place cause of what Jason has become. But back in 1982 this was only Jason's 2nd outing so it wasn't out of character.Friday the 13th Part 3 is far from perfect; make no mistake it does have its flaws. But it's also a well made slasher flick with a creepy villain and likable characters. Something some of the later installments didn't have.",4,Excellent Slasher Flick,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,6867,"['Friday', '13th', 'movies', 'one', 'favorite', 'series', 'would', 'possibly',

The slasher scenes are poor, blood effects dismal, and the girls. . . Well, certainly not enough is shown to even make it the slight bit interesting.The plot is simple. A bunch of teens and what looks to be like a guy in his late 20's goes to where 'Camp Blood' used to be. Of course, 'yours truly', (Jason), is thee, ensuring they have a weekend  to die for, no pun intended.The plot is weak, because NO one seems to fight back decently.

211890,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,6300214311,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[2, 7]","Gather around, young children, for I have a tale to impart. It is of a young boy with a severe Oedipal complex who lived on Crystal Lake. The days of peaceful skinny-dipping and sweet young love are gone. Jason's mom has died at the hands of some buxom girl, and Jason is out for teenage blood. Please don't look behind the hockey mask, for it is horrifying. He is scarred, nearly mutated. He seems to possess super-powers because he is incapable of dying. Accept your destiny because he will always come back. Forget about slicing and dicing this once-kind lad. He is indestructible. Run for your life. No, don't go into the woods and down the road. That would make too much sense. Lock yourself in the house. Stand still. Breathe and wait to die.There you have it my dear on-lookers. This is the story of Friday the 13th Part 3, the same story as in just about all the sequels to Friday the 13th, except this time Jason goes to New York City. Since I was six years old when this film came out, my parents had little interest in taking me to this film. This is unfortunate because I will never get the chance to relish what might have been pretty nifty 3D effectsThe film was shot in 3D and looks pretty bland on video or DVD. A kid is about to swing a bat and it is strangely positioned near the filmmaker's camera lens. Ditto for a variety of other objects like a rope, a yo-yo, and a spear entering the eye of a Hispanic girl who only carries food stamps in her wallet. Without the ability to experience the 3D aspect, all that remains are gratuitous shot compositions.Watching this film is an unbearable experience because it rehashes the original's formula. There is no spontaneity, just by-the-numbers killings surrounded by crude filler material. The audience is aware that the purpose of the film is to see Jason kill a couple of a teenagers, with one teenager (two, if you're lucky) surviving at the film's end. There is no need to hear couples talk about sex and relationships because the material serves no lasting purpose. Our emotional attachment is to Jason's slings and arrows.Director Steve Miner gets credit for the camp element, though. It's delightful hearing characters say such things as ""you put this barrier between us and I want to break through"" or ""nothing is going to happen if we're all here together."" He seems to have fun with the idea of the teenager in peril and he flies with it. But all of this is ultimately irrelevant because the film is not particularly scary. An opening flashback reminds us of the events that transpired in the first two films causing us to expect more of the same. Teenagers will dress like Pat Benatar and smoke as much pot as they want and when they take off their clothes, heads will fly.",1,Friday the 13th Part 3,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,2749,"['Gather', 'young', 'children', 'have', 'tale', 'impart', 'young', 'boy', 'severe', 'Oedipal', 'complex', 'who', 'lived', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'days', 'peaceful', 'skinny-dipping', 'sweet', 'young', 'love', 'are', 'gone', 'Jason', 'mom', 'died', 'hands', 'buxom', 'girl', 'Jason', 'out', 'teenage', 'blood', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'hockey', 'mask', 'horrifying', 'scarred', 'nearly', 'mutated', 'possess', 'super-powers', 'incapable', 'dying', 'Accept', 'destiny', 'will', 'always', 'come', 'back', 'Forget', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'once-kind', 'lad', 'indestructible', 'Run', 'life', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'woods', 'road', 'would', 'make', 'too', 'much', 'sense', 'Lock', 'house', 'Stand', 'still', 'Breathe', 'wait', 'die.There', 'have', 'dear', 'on-lookers', 'story', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '3', 'same', 'story', 'just', 'sequels', 'Friday', '13th', 'time', 'Jason', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'parents', 'had', 'little', 'interest', 'taking', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'chance', 'relish', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'nifty', '3D', 'effectsThe', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '3D', 'pretty', 'bland', 'video', 'DVD', 'kid', 'swing', 'bat', 'strangely', 'positioned', 'filmmaker', 'camera', 'Ditto', 'variety', 'other', 'objects', 'rope', 'yo-yo', 'spear', 'entering', 'eye', 'Hispanic', 'girl', 'who', 'only', 'food', 'stamps', 'wallet', 'ability', 'experience', '3D', 'aspect', 'remains', 'are', 'gratuitous', 'shot', 'compositions.Watching', 'film', 'unbearable', 'experience', 'original', 'formula', 'spontaneity', 'just', 'by-the-numbers', 'killings', 'surrounded', 'crude', 'filler', 'material', 'audience', 'aware', 'purpose', 'film', 'see', 'Jason', 'kill', 'couple', 'teenagers', 'one', 'teenager', 'two', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'surviving', 'film', 'end', 'need', 'hear', 'couples', 'talk', 'sex', 'relationships', 'material', 'lasting', 'purpose', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'Jason', 'slings', 'arrows.Director', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'credit', 'camp', 'element', 'though', 'delightful', 'hearing', 'characters', 'say', 'such', 'things', 'put', 'barrier', 'want', 'break', 'nothing', 'going', 'happen', ""'re"", 'here', 'together', 'have', 'fun', 'idea', 'teenager', 'peril', 'ultimately', 'irrelevant', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'scary', 'opening', 'flashback', 'events', 'transpired', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'causing', 'expect', 'more', 'same', 'Teenagers', 'will', 'dress', 'Pat', 'Benatar', 'smoke', 'much', 'pot', 'want', 'when', 'take', 'off', 'clothes', 'heads', 'will', 'fly']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

211892,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,6300214311,David J. Brown,"[2, 10]","[...].  Part Five gets points for being a guilty pleasure, though--so bad it's kind of good sort of thing.  This film is basically a cobbled together mess of half hearted atttempts at being scary.  Hell, they even threw in the 3-D gimmick to cover up their lame movie's shortcomings.  Unfortunately, in the home video arena you don't even get the satisfaction of the gimmick, but more on that later....Firstly, the acting is all uniformly atrocious, especially the actress who plays the film's last girl.  She has an infamous scene where she describes an encounter she had with Jason, and her performance, the editing, the dialogue is so bad that it ends up being hysterical, so I give it points for being so bad that it's good. Plus, as far as the plot, and use the word 'plot' very loosely for a lack of a better word, is utterly pointless and adds nothing to the movie or the overall Jason mythology, if anything it further muddles the notorious Friday The 13th poor continuity. Funnily enough, Jason Takes Manhattan makes a similar mistake, but at least it was filmed and written in a competent manner.  The character of Shelly has to be the most annoying character to ever appear in any slasher film.  Though, he does get some of the best bad dialogue in the film. ""I just want you to like me.""  LOL!  I thought Jason was the only retard in the movie.  The other actors are just forgettable and leave nothing beyond the manner that they are dispatched worth remembering.Speaking of memorable deaths, the make-up effects in this film are also pretty weak, not as weak as part 5, but pretty close.  I will give kudos to Stan Winston's company's design, specifically the great Kenny Myers, on Jason's visage.  It's creepy, fairly realistic, and fierce.  Why Jason went from a long haired, long faced hill-billy with a Picasso face to a fat, bald brown guy is anybody's guess.  I mean, these films were barely made within a year of each other, why was continuity such a hardship?  I 'eye ball' scene is pretty neat, but that's about it as far as the creative onscreen carnage goes.This movie almost validated the moral police anti-slasher critics.  What was the point of the whole biker gang?  Oh,  yeah, just more bodies to pointlessly and unscarily get killed by Jason.  It is funny when the should be dead black biker shows up at the climax only to have his hand lobbed off.  Real original stuff going on here.  What a surprise too.  It's almost like a bad super hero film where they keep adding new super heroes to take place of an orignal plot or a plot at all.  Plus, the film is just dull, TOTALLY DULL.  It's actually sleep inducing and that's real death in a horror film!The only thing this film contributes to the series is it's the first time Jason dons his hockey mask.  Which is funny that the hockey mask has become so iconic, because it's such a silly idea for the mother of all slashers to be walking around with it on.  Michael Myers' maks was scary, even Scream's ghost face killer mask is scarier then a hockey mask.  I would've personally stuck it out with the Elephant Man sack.  Can't do much about it though, it's part of the pop culture horror zeitgeist for all time now. Though, without the hockey mask I wouldn't have got the huge belly laugh out of the remake.  The scene where Jason discovers the hockey mask, again, and the score rises to overwrought levels of absurdity was laugh out loud funny.Aw, crap even the third act chase is so poorly edited and performed it's sleep inducing!  This movie just plain [..].  Thankfully part 4 came along and put the series back together.All the Friday movies have been re-released with new special features this year and this is the only black sheep in the bunch.  It's bare bones with the exception of a trailer and  the useless 3-D effect that just doesn't hold up on home video.  Though, the transfer and sound is a huge improvement over the previous From Crystal Lake To Manhattan box set.  Though, that set had a 15 minute retro doc with some of the cast and Sean S. Cunnigham on the Killer Extras disc.  Plus, it also had a cast commentary track over the film, so you might want to hang on to those if you are a die hard fan of this film.Like the Friday Part 2 Deluxe Edition, and all previous editions, director Steve Miner is nowhere to be found.  He doesn't even look back on this series in print.  He was the only person to direct two of them and he was involved in the making of the original.  Is he ashamed of his involvement?  Well, after watching this piece of crap again, I could see why.",1,"Really lame sequel, worst in the series, and an even lamer Deluxe Edition DVD!",1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,4573,"['[', ']', 'Part', 'Five', 'points', 'being', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'though', 'so', 'bad', 'kind', 'good', 'sort', 'thing', 'film', 'basically', 'cobbled', 'together', 'mess', 'half', 'hearted', 'atttempts', 'being', 'scary', 'Hell', 'even', 'threw', '3-D', 'gimmick', 'cover', 'up', 'lame', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'Unfortunately', 'home', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'gimmick', 'more', 'later', '.Firstly', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'atrocious', 'especially', 'actress', 'who', 'film', 'last', 'girl', 'infamous', 'scene', 'where', 'encounter', 'had', 'Jason', 'performance', 'editing', 'dialogue', 'so', 'bad', 'up', 'being', 'hysterical', 'give', 'being', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'use', 'word', ""'plot"", 'very', 'loosely', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'nothing', 'movie', 'overall', 'Jason', 'mythology', 'anything', 'further', 'notorious', 'Friday', '13th', 'poor', 'continuity', 'Funnily', 'enough', 'Jason', 'Takes', 'Manhattan', 'similar', 'mistake', 'least', 'was', 'filmed', 'written', 'competent', 'manner', 'character', 'Shelly', 'be', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'ever', 'appear', 'slasher', 'film', 'get', 'best', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'like', 'LOL', 'thought', 'Jason', 'was', 'only', 'retard', 'movie', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'forgettable', 'leave', 'nothing', 'manner', 'are', 'dispatched', 'remembering.Speaking', 'memorable', 'deaths', 'make-up', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'weak', 'not', 'as', 'weak', 'part', '5', 'pretty', 'close', 'will', 'give', 'kudos', 'Stan', 'Winston', 'company', 'design', 'specifically', 'great', 'Kenny', 'Myers', 'Jason', 'visage', 'creepy', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'fierce', 'Why', 'Jason', 'went', 'long', 'haired', 'long', 'faced', 'hill-billy', 'Picasso', 'face', 'fat', 'bald', 'brown', 'guy', 'anybody', 'guess', 'mean', 'films', 'were', 'barely', 'made', 'year', 'other', 'why', 'was', 'continuity', 'hardship', ""'eye"", 'scene', 'pretty', 'neat', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'creative', 'onscreen', 'carnage', 'goes.This', 'movie', 'almost', 'validated', 'moral', 'police', 'anti-slasher', 'critics', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'whole', 'biker', 'gang', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'just', 'more', 'bodies', 'pointlessly', 'unscarily', 'get', 'killed', 'Jason', 'funny', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'dead', 'black', 'biker', 'up', 'climax', 'only', 'have', 'hand', 'lobbed', 'off', 'Real', 'original', 'stuff', 'going', 'here', 'What', 'surprise', 'too', 'almost', 'bad', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'where', 'keep', 'adding', 'new', 'super', 'heroes', 'take', 'place', 'orignal', 'plot', 'plot', 'film', 'just', 'dull', 'TOTALLY', 'DULL', 'actually', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'real', 'death', 'horror', 'film', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'Jason', 'hockey', 'mask', 'Which', 'funny', 'hockey', 'mask', 'become', 'so', 'iconic', 'such', 'silly', 'idea', 'mother', 'slashers', 'be', 'walking', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'maks', 'was', 'scary', 'even', 'Scream', 'ghost', 'face', 'killer', 'mask', 'scarier', 'then', 'hockey', 'mask', 'would', ""'ve"", 'personally', 'stuck', 'out', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'sack', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'part', 'pop', 'culture', 'horror', 'zeitgeist', 'time', 'now', 'Though', 'hockey', 'mask', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'got', 'huge', 'belly', 'remake', 'scene', 'where', 'Jason', 'hockey', 'mask', 'again', 'score', 'overwrought', 'levels', 'absurdity', 'was', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny.Aw', 'crap', 'even', 'third', 'act', 'chase', 'so', 'poorly', 'edited', 'performed', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', '[', '..', ']', 'Thankfully', 'part', '4', 'came', 'along', 'put', 'series', 'back', 'Friday', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 're-released', 'new', 'special', 'features', 'year', 'only', 'black', 'sheep', 'bunch', 'bare', 'bones', 'exception', 'trailer', 'useless', '3-D', 'effect', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'home', 'video', 'Though', 'transfer', 'sound', 'huge', 'improvement', 'previous', 'From', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'Manhattan', 'box', 'set', 'Though', 'set', 'had', '15', 'minute', 'retro', 'doc', 'cast', 'Sean', 'S.', 'Cunnigham', 'Killer', 'Extras', 'disc', 'also', 'had', 'cast', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'might', 'want', 'hang', 'are', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'Friday', 'Part', '2', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'previous', 'editions', 'director', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'back', 'series', 'print', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'direct', 'two', 'was', 'involved', 'making', 'original', 'ashamed', 'involvement', 'Well', 'watching', 'piece', 'crap', 'again', 'could', 'see', 'why']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

And just to think, that this is one of the better films in the series. First of all, this movie is okay in its sense to add a little suspense into the movie, but the act gets old quick when Jason (Richard Brooker) is everywhere, yet he rarely pops out to kill someone. It's just like a movie from the ""Halloween"" series, just much, much cheesier and duller. The acting, unlike the first two installments, is a bad mix. I could never get over the casting either. In this movie, there is a group of six (...)driven college aged students who are staying at a cabin on the lake in the woods. Then there are these two people who to be about 35 years old who consistantly smoke weed and talk like hippies (...). To add more deaths, the writers decided to throw in dead meat, which turned out to be suprisingly the most interesting characters of the whole movie. They were three bikers, with Gloria Fox as my favorite playing the tough-girl Fox. Despite its many flaws, the movie does connect the thrid installment and the second installment very well, (...) does an excellent job creating a spooky atmosphere, even despite his bad actors. Audiances will notice objects always flying in their direction, which is becuase the film was originally shown in 3D (and hopefully they will discover a way to bring that 3D to DVD someday). But even with the consistant flying objects, the film makes me think the most about the 80's, with its funky opening theme and rad clothing, plus of course Jason was a phenominon back then.

Why, in the flashback scene, is Jason wearing his current clothes even though the flashback was several years ago and he didn't get the black jumpsuit until the beginning of this movie?  Why does Jason apparently shave his head between Part 2 (which happens the night before) and Part 3?  Why would you spend money on an expensive 3-D process and then leave the wires that control the snake, knife, eyeball, and harpoon visible?  Wouldn't it be Saturday?Other than that, it's okay.

211907,A2T0XBQM7N923Y,6300214311,Fady Ghaly,"[0, 2]","Now here is where the series goes downhill in deliberation that it was once one to have initially been taken seriously, for this one was not at all in the sense that it would have likely wanted to be. The undistinguishing nature of Jason's victims permits consistency to fall by the wayside, thereby indicating the film's status as little more than a senseless thrill-machine.Obviously, it isn't really going to appeal to those outside of the genre. But to those who like things to be shockingly repellent, there are some really intense scenes here, such as the one where Andy, a sex-crazed teenager who has impregnated his gorgeous girlfriend, his body is split in half lengthwise while walking on his hands.Despite of what little subplot there was (something that is easily noticed from what little synopsis there was describing the film in the back of the cover), what little intelligence there was put into the script and what little effort there was put into the performances, for the majority of it was ever so laughable, it is one that manages to be both fun in nature and mean-spirited. It's an interesting little scare-fest that not only grossed out a greater audience when it was released in theaters than the last two for the usage of three-dimensional graphics, but somehow stood as my favorite. Perhaps because this is the one where Jason departs from that somewhat ludicrous looking bag of his and dons the infamous hockey mask, which, being a highly significant factor, presented a strong visual imagery of him. Also, perhaps because it's more conceptive with regards to the creative events and for the fact that acclaimed director Steve Miner injects it with a lot more atmosphere and tension, for I had completely admired his cunning style of filmmaking toward depictions of menacing lurking presence that could merely be from whom else but his favorite creation?Although the characters in the films aren't always that appealing for the individuals in whom they are in general, these ""wild bunch"" that were featured in this one were quite hysterical and classical. You, in fact, almost don't want to see them getting hacked apart, for the filmmakers actually manage to have us sympathize for a number of them; some of whom struggle with their self-image, while others strive to move on with their lives and not let the past hinder with them-dark themes that have since haunted them.It's only fair to say that this installment was simply and purely well-crafted from beginning-to-end; it's a perfect depiction of a summer camp horror movie gone wrong, for the campers, as day grew weary and the meteorological conditions, including temperature, precipitation, and wind, prevailed, ultimately find themselves trapped in a campground where they are rendered helpless and are forced to witness what becomes of those who fall victim to their foe's rampage, until there can only be one left who shall face this horror on hers-or his-own. As the film tightened to its climax and the lone survivor was left face-to-face with what has created havoc of her-or his-life, I was completely frozen with fear, and still, regardless of how many times I watch the film-for I have well over twenty times-remain to be as I begin to perceive of the film's gradual change of mood and signs that the trip isn't the serene one it is made out to be.",5,Fady Ghaly's reviews,1001030400,"09 21, 2001",2001,3342,"['Now', 'here', 'where', 'series', 'downhill', 'deliberation', 'was', 'once', 'one', 'have', 'initially', 'been', 'taken', 'seriously', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'wanted', 'be', 'undistinguishing', 'nature', 'Jason', 'victims', 'consistency', 'fall', 'wayside', 'thereby', 'indicating', 'film', 'status', 'little', 'more', 'senseless', 'thrill-machine.Obviously', ""n't"", 'really', 'going', 'appeal', 'genre', 'who', 'like', 'things', 'be', 'shockingly', 'repellent', 'are', 'really', 'intense', 'scenes', 'here', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'Andy', 'sex-crazed', 'teenager', 'who', 'impregnated', 'gorgeous', 'girlfriend', 'body', 'split', 'half', 'lengthwise', 'walking', 'hands.Despite', 'what', 'little', 'subplot', 'was', 'something', 'easily', 'noticed', 'what', 'little', 'synopsis', 'was', 'describing', 'film', 'back', 'cover', 'what', 'little', 'intelligence', 'was', 'put', 'script', 'what', 'little', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'performances', 'majority', 'was', 'ever', 'so', 'laughable', 'one', 'be', 'fun', 'nature', 'mean-spirited', 'interesting', 'little', 'scare-fest', 'not', 'only', 'grossed', 'out', 'greater', 'audience', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'last', 'two', 'usage', 'three-dimensional', 'graphics', 'somehow', 'stood', 'favorite', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'where', 'Jason', 'somewhat', 'ludicrous', 'looking', 'bag', 'infamous', 'hockey', 'mask', 'being', 'highly', 'significant', 'factor', 'presented', 'strong', 'visual', 'imagery', 'Also', 'perhaps', 'more', 'conceptive', 'regards', 'creative', 'events', 'fact', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'lot', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'had', 'completely', 'admired', 'cunning', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'depictions', 'menacing', 'lurking', 'presence', 'could', 'merely', 'be', 'whom', 'else', 'favorite', 'creation', 'characters', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'appealing', 'individuals', 'whom', 'are', 'general', 'wild', 'bunch', 'were', 'featured', 'one', 'were', 'quite', 'hysterical', 'classical', 'fact', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'getting', 'hacked', 'apart', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'manage', 'have', 'sympathize', 'number', 'whom', 'struggle', 'self-image', 'others', 'strive', 'move', 'lives', 'not', 'let', 'past', 'hinder', 'them-dark', 'themes', 'have', 'haunted', 'them.It', 'only', 'fair', 'say', 'installment', 'was', 'simply', 'purely', 'well-crafted', 'beginning-to-end', 'perfect', 'depiction', 'summer', 'camp', 'horror', 'movie', 'gone', 'wrong', 'campers', 'day', 'grew', 'weary', 'meteorological', 'conditions', 'including', 'temperature', 'precipitation', 'wind', 'prevailed', 'ultimately', 'find', 'trapped', 'campground', 'where', 'are', 'rendered', 'helpless', 'are', 'forced', 'witness', 'what', 'who', 'fall', 'victim', 'foe', 'rampage', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'left', 'who', 'shall', 'face', 'horror', 'hers-or', 'his-own', 'film', 'tightened', 'climax', 'lone', 'survivor', 'was', 'left', 'face-to-face', 'what', 'created', 'havoc', 'her-or', 'his-life', 'was', 'completely', 'frozen', 'fear', 'still', 'regardless', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'film-for', 'have', 'well', 'twenty', 'times-remain', 'be', 'begin', 'perceive', 'film', 'gradual', 'change', 'mood', 'signs', 'trip', ""n't"", 'serene', 'one', 'made', 'out', 'be']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

This still holds true for this release, but the anaglyph is much better than I expected it to be.I have not watched this movie from start to finish yet, but have sampled scenes from each chapter. Overall, I was very happy with the results.  Convergence seemed good, with a few exceptions in some scenes.  Color-accuracy was acceptable given that the colored lenses of analglyph glasses will always prevent true color purity.One thing that I was upset about, however, is that the opening credits were not in 3D!

I bought this entry, ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" and was bit nick picky on the overall flaws this film has.What's not to say about a Jason movie? Honestly, the films has been called terrible. I could somewhat understand that. This movie has the same old plot device with the typical stupid hormoned counselors who get hacked up one by one by Jason. Another problem is, along with bad acting, is the somewhat lack of screen time for Jason. I just hate watching the characters taking the whole movie that deserves to Jason. Every time Jason kills somebody, the camera hardly shows Jason's appearance. Just a quick killing. Why are the filmmakers hiding Jason's identity? We all know Jason is doing the killings! It's not like someone else is doing the murders. Just cut out the surprises!Despite all that, a good thing about this movie is that Jason finally gets his iconic hockey mask. Beats the heck out of that stupid potato sack he wore in ""Part 2."" There's also a good amount of frights and scares. It replaces some of the minimal amount of gore this film has.It's a good and bad slasher flick . It's better then most ""Friday"" entries. That's not saying much.

Yes Jason is the juggernaut who slices and dices his way through a small group of unsuspecting people. They just happen to be unlucky enough to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.The movie starts off with a local drive by store near Camp Crystal Lake. A presumed married couple reside there. We are introduced to a stalking figure who hides behind the hanging laundry. We cannot see his face but we presume the worst.This movie is undeniably Jason's movie. It is his coming out party of sorts. His identity is no longer hidden; just his face is. In this movie he recieves an iconic accesory which he will carry with him on the rest of his journeys.We meet other characters in this movie shortly after Jason's roadside shopping excursion. They are a group of funloving young adults who are picking up some friends and taking a drive to an area near the infamous Camp Crystal Lake where ghastly murders just took place. On the way to their destination they are not aware of all of the blatant warning signs of evil that are marked all along their path.They arrive and settle in. Not much happens for awhile except some socializing and a mishap at a nearby convience store. Night then begins to fall upon the area and that is where fun begins. It is Jason's area and he won't be denied.This movie soon turns into a typical stalk and slash movie. We are then left with a final act that is full of that previously lacking suspense. And we even get to see the big man's face - which is quite scary-looking to say the least. And what we are left with in the end is more questions than answers - which is almost as entertaining as the previous sequel.To add to the mystique of your usual Friday movies there are a few death scenes are quite good.

211918,A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,6300214311,Gregorio,"[2, 3]","This Deluxe DVD Edition has some great stuff and not so great.  First the Great stuff:  The packaging is excellent with a holographic 3D slipcase that matches the new editions of part 1 and 2, making up a matching trilogy of sorts.  The 3D is NOT the awesome polarized process that I remember watching back in high school but is instead anaglyphic (red and blue glasses).  I've always been a fan of 3D films and saw all the 3D stuff back in the late 80's (JAWS 3D, AMITYVILLE 3D, PARASITE, TREASURE OF THE FOUR CROWNS etc.) and FRIDAY was always the best of the lot.  The polarized 3D was far superior to the anaglyphic (although more recent efforts in anaglyphic such as FREDDY'S DEAD and the terrific NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D have come a long way since ROBOT MONSTER and BLACK LAGOON).So anyhow, I know a little something about how 3D should look and I've gotta say this is the most successful home video rendition of 3D I have seen yet.  There is true dimensionality in every scene and there are many terrific effects where objects (and body parts) fly off the screen at you.  Although I knew exactly what was coming, I still found myself ducking out of the way!  It is wonderful to see the 3D aspect of this film restored.  I viewed this DVD with a 1080p HDMI DVD player on a 50 inch 1080 LCD flat panel and the 3D effect came close to what I viewed this past weekend in the theatre watching MY BLOODY VALENTINE.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack has never sounded better and there are plenty of aural jolts in this presentation.  The two pairs of 3D glasses are designed well and have a hocky mask motif printed on them, not just white cardboard. / Now for the not so great: The 3D, although highly effective, has some SEVERE problems with blur and ghosting.  Occasionally lips end up on noses and eyeballs on foreheads.  It isn't enough to spoil the film but it makes me wonder why Paramount couldn't have corrected that.  It has the worst ""ghosting"" problem I have seen on a home video 3D release.  Also not so great is the 2D transfer which has in fact never looked worse.  This thing is ate up with film grain and dirt.  I know 3D films rendered in 2D for home video often have these problems but Paramount should have fixed this digitally, at least cleaning up the spots on the film and trying to calm down the artifacting and film grain.  Not great either is that the only ""special feature"" on this DVD is the theatrical trailer.  No commentary, documentary, photos, NOTHING.  Maybe those will turn up on a future Blu Ray release (forcing me to buy this title yet again). Also, this is the R rated version when a restored uncut version is certainly in order at this point.  Nevertheless I'm gonna give this one 4 stars simply because the 3D looked pretty impressive and the film itself is a classic.",4,Decent 3D Transfer,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,2813,"['Deluxe', 'DVD', 'Edition', 'great', 'stuff', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'First', 'Great', 'stuff', 'packaging', 'excellent', 'holographic', '3D', 'slipcase', 'new', 'editions', 'part', '1', '2', 'making', 'up', 'matching', 'trilogy', 'sorts', '3D', 'NOT', 'awesome', 'polarized', 'process', 'remember', 'watching', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'instead', 'anaglyphic', 'red', 'blue', 'glasses', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', '3D', 'films', 'saw', '3D', 'stuff', 'back', 'late', '80', 'JAWS', '3D', 'AMITYVILLE', '3D', 'PARASITE', 'TREASURE', 'THE', 'FOUR', 'CROWNS', 'etc', 'FRIDAY', 'was', 'always', 'best', 'lot', 'polarized', '3D', 'was', 'far', 'superior', 'anaglyphic', 'more', 'recent', 'efforts', 'anaglyphic', 'such', 'FREDDY', 'DEAD', 'terrific', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', '3D', 'have', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'ROBOT', 'MONSTER', 'BLACK', 'LAGOON', '.So', 'anyhow', 'know', 'little', 'something', 'how', '3D', 'should', 'look', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'most', 'successful', 'home', 'video', 'rendition', '3D', 'have', 'seen', 'yet', 'true', 'dimensionality', 'scene', 'are', 'many', 'terrific', 'effects', 'where', 'objects', 'body', 'parts', 'fly', 'screen', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'still', 'found', 'ducking', 'way', 'wonderful', 'see', '3D', 'aspect', 'film', 'restored', 'viewed', 'DVD', '1080p', 'HDMI', 'DVD', 'player', '50', 'inch', '1080', 'LCD', 'flat', 'panel', '3D', 'effect', 'came', 'close', 'what', 'viewed', 'past', 'weekend', 'theatre', 'watching', 'MY', 'BLOODY', 'VALENTINE', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'are', 'plenty', 'aural', 'jolts', 'presentation', 'two', 'pairs', '3D', 'glasses', 'are', 'designed', 'well', 'have', 'hocky', 'mask', 'motif', 'printed', 'not', 'just', 'white', 'cardboard', '/', 'Now', 'not', 'so', 'great', '3D', 'highly', 'effective', 'SEVERE', 'problems', 'blur', 'ghosting', 'Occasionally', 'lips', 'end', 'up', 'noses', 'eyeballs', 'foreheads', ""n't"", 'enough', 'spoil', 'film', 'wonder', 'why', 'Paramount', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'corrected', 'worst', 'ghosting', 'problem', 'have', 'seen', 'home', 'video', '3D', 'release', 'Also', 'not', 'so', 'great', '2D', 'transfer', 'fact', 'never', 'looked', 'worse', 'thing', 'ate', 'film', 'grain', 'dirt', 'know', '3D', 'films', 'rendered', '2D', 'home', 'video', 'often', 'have', 'problems', 'Paramount', 'should', 'have', 'fixed', 'digitally', 'least', 'cleaning', 'up', 'spots', 'film', 'trying', 'calm', 'down', 'artifacting', 'film', 'grain', 'Not', 'great', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'commentary', 'documentary', 'photos', 'NOTHING', 'Maybe', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'future', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'release', 'forcing', 'buy', 'title', 'yet', 'again', 'Also', 'R', 'rated', 'version', 'when', 'restored', 'uncut', 'version', 'certainly', 'order', 'point', ""'m"", 'gon', 'give', 'one', '4', 'stars', 'simply', '3D', 'looked', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'film', 'classic']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

Indeed, the new ""super 3D"" process was great - super clear and a lot of depth. However, unless you are able to view in 3-D --unlikely--, this is one of the lamest of the series with one of the lamest endings (although, Dana Kimmel is great at being hysterical and you might get a kick out of the stoned chick and her boyfriend).Special effects were par for the day.

211928,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6300214311,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[6, 7]","First, let me preface this review by saying that if you don't like slasher/horror flicks to begin with, then you sure as hell aren't going to like ""Friday the 13th part 3"", but if you are a fan of the genre then you are in for a treat with this one.  Still, with that being said, some horror movie fans and critics alike would disagree with my assertion that ""Friday the 13th part 2"" and/or ""Friday the 13th part 3"" are the best of the ""Friday the 13th"" series and those people would clearly be wrong.  The acting and scripts for parts 2 & 3 are without a doubt superior to the other movies.  Steve Miner did an outstanding job with both Friday the 13th part 2 and 3, which are also the most dynamic movies of the series, and while one could legitimately argue that part 2 is technically superior than part 3 in the sense of being scary (it's a tough call, but Jason with the hood and his style in part 2 was scarier in my opinion), I think that part 3 has a little extra something that makes it a little more interesting than part 2.  I should say that I think the score is even better for ""Friday the 13th part 3"" with the advent of that funky-scary music that we get in the opening credits of this brilliant horror flick.At any rate, part 3 starts out recapping what happened at the end of ""Friday the 13th part 2"".  Immediately following the part 2 murders, the audience is introduced to a very attractive young lady named Chris who has had a traumatic and mysterious confrontation with Jason Voorhees.  Chris is trying to overcome her fear of this past experience by going back to the ""scene of the incident"" if you will.  Hence, you have the plot of this movie in a somewhat different setting than the other Friday 13th flicks.  I like this underlying theme of the mysterious attack by Jason Voorhees against Chris...I think it really sets the tone and provides an interesting and refreshing perspective for this series.Chris and her friends return to the cabin location and Chris tries to deal with her fears and her memory of the horrible attack.  I thought the addition of the barn was a terrific arena for horror with this type of movie...you have it all in this one: the woods, the barn and the cabins...great setting for what is a great slasher flick.  Meanwhile, while Chris and friends are arriving at the cabin, Jason has just finished a massive killing spree and is hungry for more blood, and of course, Chris in her crew are most definitely in the wrong place at the wrong time.In ""Friday the 13th part 3"", we have more dynamic characters and better character development in general; this is where part 3 is slightly better than part 2, although I did like Paul and Ginny as well.  For instance, in part 3, Shelley provides an interesting character as he is a weird kind of fellow with an inferiority complex.  He constantly engages in morbid-like pranks with gore in which he tricks everyone into thinking he has been brutally murdered.  This sets the tone for later of course when Jason actually kills Shelley and it is a really great scene when Shelley is finally discovered dead for real.  Also, I really loved the advent of the biker crew...I thought the little altercation between Shelley and the bikers was an interesting and fun subplot.  The actors who played Ali, Fox and Loco were outstanding.  In fact, Ali is a dangerous man in his own right and provides Jason with some combative competition...okay, not much competition but he's better than the girls he ends up losing to in the end.  I must admit that my favorite part of the movie is when Fox is swinging on that rope on the second floor of that barn and Loco reprimands her while she is having such a good time and then when he looks back, Fox aint there no more...I guess she found Jason somewhat more formidable than that little girl she bullied in the grocery mart.Anyway, Jason disposes of his prey in the usual fashion with some creativity.  In fact, I really love the murder scene when that guy is always walking with his hands and eventually runs into Jason. OUCH!!!  But, by and large, the acting and script for this movie is just superior to the others...I give ""Friday the 13th part 3"" a slight but distinct edge over ""Friday the 13th part 2"" from that perspective.  Steve Miner did a brilliant job with both movies and both are slasher classics and must own DVDs for horror movie fans.As an interesting point of trivia, Jason donnes the notorious hockey mask in ""Friday the 13th part 3""...it belonged to Shelley and was rudely stolen from him after his gruesome demise.""Friday the 13th part 3"" is one of the very best slasher flicks ever and is an absolute must own for all serious and sophisticated horror movie fans.  Anyone who thinks this is bad slasher flick obviously has no idea what he/she is talking about.  Enjoy Jason's finest and buy ""Friday the 13th part 3""...you'll be glad you did as you can watch this one over and over again...a solid 4 STAR slasher-horror flick.",4,The best of the Friday the 13th/Jason series.

Jason Voorhees gets up off his rear from shortly after number two and gets rid of the bag, that was kind of a lame mask anyway and I think Steve Miner knew that. Steve did an average job on number two, but nothing close to this one. He proved that he can do horror well, and he earned my respect. .... if you are going to sit and watch a Friday the 13th movie, you must get used to bad acting! I found that hallarious and totally agreed. The characters in part three reffered to as &quot;the wild bunch&quot; are believable and quite hysterical. I dont always like the characters in all of the Friday films, but these ones were classical and a good type of strange. You got your ... prankster, you got your two lovebirds, you got your two hippie lovebirds, a chick with a terrible past, a country boy, a blind date for the fat... prankster, two durranged adult lovebirds, a motorcycle gang, and an old man on the road completing the dead or alive Ralph character. My favorite character in this movie seems to change over the years, but recently it is Debbie,  and  or  Chuck. I dont know why. Anywho, this one is different from the others, is more conceptive about the creative events and lets you get to know Crystal Lake more.... I thought the funniest part in the movie was after Chuck roughed up the bikers bikes and the the black biker, I think Ali, approached him in his car. You will just have to see what happens then. Crystal Lake has nice greenery and woods, bueatiful sparkling lakes( wouldnt swim in them if you know what I mean )and some of the MOST of the people are nice. The art of this film is to turn a pleasant environment with funny people and nice couples to a living homicidal hell that the residents wish that they hadnt entered. Steve Miner did to the wilderness outdoor country what Alfred Hitchcock did to hotels and showers. Although the MPAA chops his movies up a bit sometimes, Steve Miner is a great director. The simplicity of Friday 3 is as simple as everyday life, that is what makes it and the other Friday movies what they are. This was the best one though, it was a classic, and anyone who says that it is an over used, poorly acted ...fest is not looking hard. This is a classic, you will like. Really. This is also the first one where infamous Jason recieves his hockey mask, that certainly makes it a cant miss.

211934,A319SKSB556033,6300214311,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[2, 3]","If Paramount's A-movie franchise was Star Trek, then their B-movie franchise would definitely be Friday The 13th. A total of eight were made and, with the exception of '83, there was a Friday The 13th for every year in the Eighties, with the TV series debuting in '87.They were tacky, badly made and infrequently showed any professionalism, or dynamic filmmaking. But they sure had their moments and Part 3 is definitely the best of the first four, Part 5 being the joker in the pack and 6-8 the second instalment of the Jason Voorhees legacy.Copy pictureApparently, not getting enough of butchering teenagers with the first sequel, director Steve Miner returns for more unlucky day murders. While his first outing was almost the exact same as the original, only with a different killer, Part 3 reinvents the franchise and totally solidifies Jason as a horror movie icon.Chris (Dana Kimmel) has had a difficult past few years and she decides to spend a long weekend at Higgins Haven with her friends. Too bad for them that Jason (Richard Brooker) is lurking in the woods. He and Chris have had a scuffle in the past and she's afraid to go out there alone.Her friends are an unusual bunch. There are a couple of stoners, Shelly, a fat kid who just wants to be loved (Larry Zerner), a pregnant friend (Tracie Savage) and her hunky squeeze (Paul Kratka). These are not the typical goofball sex-mad teenagers of the early Eighties. For some reason, the writers have made them somewhat subdued and realistic. They seriously want a quiet weekend - no partying, no loud music. It helps that we like them, because in most other occasions we can't wait for them to get slaughtered.And they aren't the only ones in trouble. A non-threatening biker gang plan to cause havoc at Higgins Haven, because Shelly knocked over their scooters, and end up regretting it. If anything, they make for some light comedy - intentional, or not.Halfway through, Shelly pulls a joke on the girl he fancies. He leaps out of the water wearing a hockey mask and brandishing a harpoon. Five minutes later Jason gets his hands on them. And ever since, the image of the hockey mask has been the trademark of the series.In every other sequel, Jason is a walking monolith. He'd kick Freddy's ass, show Michael Myers a thing or two about the art of teenage massacre and somehow be able to maintain his cool and make it all seems effortless. This is the only time you will see him for what he really is - a retarded hillbilly. He evens smiles! Twice!!Miner would return later to the same location in Lake Placid. Here, he successfully portrays Crystal Lake as a tranquil, peaceful place and manages, in the final scenes, to infuse it with atmospheric excitement, all without the use of rain, or lightning.It wouldn't be hard to make a sequel superior to the original Friday The 13th. Miner failed with Part 2, but excels in Part 3. It has a lighter tone and different feel from the others. In fact, it shouldn't be viewed as a horror film at all. It's an adventure movie, set in the woods, with one of the best villains ever.",4,This time Jason will come to YOU!,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,3087,"['Paramount', 'A-movie', 'franchise', 'was', 'Star', 'Trek', 'then', 'B-movie', 'franchise', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'Friday', '13th', 'total', 'eight', 'were', 'made', 'exception', ""'83"", 'was', 'Friday', '13th', 'year', 'Eighties', 'TV', 'series', 'debuting', ""'87.They"", 'were', 'tacky', 'badly', 'made', 'infrequently', 'showed', 'professionalism', 'dynamic', 'filmmaking', 'sure', 'had', 'moments', 'Part', '3', 'definitely', 'best', 'first', 'four', 'Part', '5', 'being', 'joker', 'pack', '6-8', 'second', 'instalment', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'pictureApparently', 'not', 'getting', 'enough', 'butchering', 'teenagers', 'first', 'sequel', 'director', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'more', 'unlucky', 'day', 'murders', 'first', 'outing', 'was', 'almost', 'exact', 'same', 'original', 'only', 'different', 'killer', 'Part', '3', 'franchise', 'totally', 'solidifies', 'Jason', 'horror', 'movie', 'icon.Chris', 'Dana', 'Kimmel', 'had', 'difficult', 'few', 'years', 'spend', 'long', 'weekend', 'Higgins', 'Haven', 'friends', 'Too', 'bad', 'Jason', 'Richard', 'Brooker', 'lurking', 'woods', 'Chris', 'have', 'had', 'scuffle', 'past', 'afraid', 'go', 'out', 'there', 'alone.Her', 'friends', 'are', 'unusual', 'bunch', 'are', 'couple', 'stoners', 'Shelly', 'fat', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'loved', 'Larry', 'Zerner', 'pregnant', 'friend', 'Tracie', 'Savage', 'hunky', 'squeeze', 'Paul', 'Kratka', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'goofball', 'sex-mad', 'teenagers', 'early', 'Eighties', 'reason', 'writers', 'have', 'made', 'somewhat', 'subdued', 'realistic', 'seriously', 'want', 'quiet', 'weekend', 'partying', 'loud', 'music', 'like', 'most', 'other', 'occasions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'slaughtered.And', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'ones', 'trouble', 'non-threatening', 'biker', 'gang', 'plan', 'cause', 'havoc', 'Higgins', 'Haven', 'Shelly', 'knocked', 'over', 'scooters', 'end', 'up', 'regretting', 'anything', 'make', 'light', 'comedy', 'intentional', 'not.Halfway', 'Shelly', 'joke', 'girl', 'water', 'wearing', 'hockey', 'mask', 'brandishing', 'harpoon', 'Five', 'minutes', 'later', 'Jason', 'hands', 'ever', 'image', 'hockey', 'mask', 'been', 'trademark', 'series.In', 'other', 'sequel', 'Jason', 'walking', 'monolith', ""'d"", 'kick', 'Freddy', 'ass', 'show', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'thing', 'two', 'art', 'teenage', 'massacre', 'somehow', 'be', 'able', 'maintain', 'cool', 'make', 'effortless', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'retarded', 'hillbilly', 'smiles', 'Twice', 'Miner', 'would', 'return', 'later', 'same', 'location', 'Lake', 'Placid', 'Here', 'successfully', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'tranquil', 'peaceful', 'place', 'manages', 'final', 'scenes', 'infuse', 'atmospheric', 'excitement', 'use', 'rain', 'lightning.It', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', 'make', 'sequel', 'superior', 'original', 'Friday', '13th', 'Miner', 'failed', 'Part', '2', 'excels', 'Part', '3', 'lighter', 'tone', 'different', 'feel', 'others', 'fact', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'viewed', 'horror', 'film', 'adventure', 'movie', 'set', 'woods', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'ever']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

And Jason returns to slaughter more beautiful, unsuspecting young people who have ventured into his woods.""Friday the 13th Part 3"" is very different from the first two.  I envy those who saw it in 3D and wish it would be re-released at the theatres in 3D.  Perhaps 4D and this time we can smell the fear of the victims.This film is also presented in a much wider aspect than the previous ones, 2.35:1 versus the standard 1.85:1.  I believe I prefer the wider aspect.The characterization is much better than the previous ones.  There is Chris who must've been attacked by Jason and survived.  She still suffers from paranoia because of the incident and imagines that someone is watching them.  The best character, and the most three dimensional of them all, is Shelly who likes to play dangerous practical jokes in order to get attention.  We all can sympathize with his character.  At one time or another, we've pulled stunts in order to gain popularity, only to regret it later.  Unfortunately, Shelly never seems to learn that people like him for himself.I believe that I've always been afraid of hockey and hockey masks.  They make the players look so ferocious and evil.  And the ice skates they wear have blades that can slice your hands and face if they come in contact with them.  Shelly must've found hockey masks scary.  Why else would he be wearing one when he performs his last stunt to scare someone?  Jason also must've thought it would be cool to wear a hockey mask when he killed people.  Maybe that is why he killed poor Shelly and took it from him.  From then on, he wore it throughout the rest of his stalking career.  His competition, Michael Myers of ""Halloween,"" had a cool mask; perhaps Jason felt that he needed one as well.Great characterization and some gruesome, unique killings give ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" four stars.

Jason has managed to survive having a machette thrust into his neck at the end of part 2, and now he has come upon a small general store and its two unsuspecting occupants.  Soon, they are added to Jason's body count.Meanwhile, another group of ""innocent"" and horny teenagers are on their way to the lake.  Chris (Dana Kimmel) has survived an earlier encounter with Jason.  She ran away from her house and ended up alone in the woods.  That was when Jason tried to attack her.  However, she blacked out and somehow ended up back in her own room.  She's come back to finally get rid of her fears.  Several of her friends have decided to come along.Their first mistake occurs when Chris and Shelley go into town to buy groceries.  They run into a rough motorcycle gang.  Unfortunately for Shelley, he backs into one of the motorcycles, which in turn knocks over the rest.  Enraged, the gang takes off after Chris and Shelley.  They follow Chris and Shelley back to camp where they decide to burn down the barn, but Jason get ahold of them before they can carry out their plan.After that, the teenagers start dropping off one by one until Chris is left to face Jason alone.  Will Chris survive, or will Jason add her to his ever-growing list of victims?I thought this movie was worse than the first tow.  This was billed to be even more scary, because it was filmed in 3-D.  The 3-D effects may have looked good in the theater, but they are non-existant on the DVD.  The plot of this series has become very predictable, and there is nothing really different from the first two movies of the series.  Jason does find his trademark hockey mask in this movie, however.I recommend this movie only if you are serious about watching every following one.  One aspect I do like is that there is a short recap of part 2 at the beginning of this movie.  This helps the viewer in case one forgot what happened previously.

Parts 2, 3 & 4 gave us the birthing of a supernatural serial killer, and make up the first of the three.  Michael Myers may have laid down the rules for the genre, but Jason Voorhees became its icon.  This chapter, as the middle of any trilogy should, had a nerve-drilling ending that left the hero in the most uncertain position.  But Jason was more than a hero; he was an anti-hero.  That meant he was a mystery, a wild card.  Every time he got killed, throughout the series, he came back more invulnerable.  In part 1, we were told about a death curse on Crystal Lake.  Curses tend to get worse the more one tried to interfere with them.  They adapted to each new threat. This chapter began only a few hours after part 2, which left Jason suffering from a machete wound.  Needing to heal and hide from a massive manhunt, he found an apparently abandoned barn behind an old lake house.  The location was familiar to him, though.  One year before, he assaulted a young girl there.  She too has returned to that place to heal.  He acts like a trapdoor spider, hiding in the barn, killing one poor unsuspecting soul at a time.  Before the end of the night, he will be stabbed, hanged, and the victim of a vicious axe to the head. This is not Jason at his most powerful.  But every time he gets killed he comes back stronger.  Still he is very creative, due to his injuries, and completely unstoppable.",4,"Injured, hungry and cornered",1021766400,"05 19, 2002",2002,1478,"['Jason', 'story', 'recent', 'X', 'been', 'broken', 'up', 'three', 'trilogies', 'Parts', '2', '3', '4', 'gave', 'birthing', 'supernatural', 'serial', 'killer', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'three', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'may', 'have', 'laid', 'down', 'rules', 'genre', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'became', 'icon', 'chapter', 'middle', 'trilogy', 'should', 'had', 'nerve-drilling', 'ending', 'left', 'hero', 'most', 'uncertain', 'position', 'Jason', 'was', 'more', 'hero', 'was', 'anti-hero', 'meant', 'was', 'mystery', 'wild', 'card', 'time', 'got', 'killed', 'series', 'came', 'back', 'more', 'invulnerable', 'part', '1', 'were', 'told', 'death', 'curse', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'Curses', 'tend', 'get', 'worse', 'more', 'one', 'tried', 'interfere', 'adapted', 'new', 'threat', 'chapter', 'began', 'only', 'few', 'hours', 'part', '2', 'left', 'Jason', 'suffering', 'machete', 'wound', 'Needing', 'heal', 'hide', 'massive', 'manhunt', 'found', 'apparently', 'abandoned', 'barn', 'old', 'lake', 'house', 'location', 'was', 'familiar', 'though', 'One', 'year', 'before', 'assaulted', 'young', 'girl', 'there', 'too', 'returned', 'place', 'heal', 'trapdoor', 'spider', 'hiding', 'barn', 'killing', 'one', 'poor', 'unsuspecting', 'soul', 'time', 'end', 'night', 'will', 'be', 'stabbed', 'hanged', 'victim', 'vicious', 'axe', 'head', 'not', 'Jason', 'most', 'powerful', 'time', 'killed', 'back', 'stronger', 'Still', 'very', 'creative', 'due', 'injuries', 'completely', 'unstoppable']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

Also for those who never saw the movie.First off, the 3D is killer! I've heard some complain about it and saying 3-D doesn't work on DVD. Maybe I read those complaints on the ""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"" DVD, but still, my dvd player is old and the 3-d is so good that even on regular dvds things stand out. The 3-D works well, if it doesn't then it is your dvd player.The images are crisp and clear and much better than the original dvd release. As with The Final Chapter, the picture quality alone is worth double dipping if you already have the original dvd. Also you have the option to view the movie in 2-D (regular) or 3-D. You get two 3-D glasses with Friday The 13th on them. Not much in the way of extras here, but it does have the theatrical trailer.For me, this is one of the better Friday The 13th's (my 2nd favorite to part 4 ""The Final Chapter""). It's the one where Jason first gets the hockey mask. It's also one of the spookier films in the series. At times the movie is silly with some of the 3-D stuff and a little dated (nothing beats 80's gangs for sillyness). This was back when Jason was a bit more inventive with his killings. The film also follows one of the better aspect of late 70's and early 80's horror flicks in that the people are isolated (like Halloween, Halloween 2, The Thing etc). Basically they are at a house & barn. No real running through woods type stuff here.There are plenty of spooky moments. I rate this my 2nd fav Friday The 13th (including the remake & Freddy vs Jason which are 3rd and 4th in Friday movies for me.)If you like movies that scare this one is for you. If you already have the older dvd release and don't even care about the 3-D you would like this DVD because of how good this DVD restores the movie.

211955,A2RUAKOIIKT006,6300214311,"Joel Adrian ""Ubervamp""","[1, 2]","F13th part III is one of the best films on the entire franchise, but... it lacks the 3D feature and the main plot of the movie can be cheesy, but beliable.The film centers in... one day later after part II. The first few minutes of the movie shows the last minutes of part II plus some things that we didnt see in that movie, you get to see that Jason is still alive and breathing, he then goes to this mini store near camp crystal lake, and he kills the owners then gets new clothes.After this a group of like.. 7 people get to go to this place called Higgins haven (dont know if this is spelled right) near that mini store at the beginning of the movie. This place is not a camp, but a vacational spot for the teenagers, however.. the setting is sooo incredible (specialy the house and the barn) that you are going to rewind your movie everytime you see it, it just looks sooo great... but the lake looks like a swamp... not exactly like that, but you can see that the water is not clean. Another thing is that in this movie Jason stays in the barn for the most part of the film, and almost all of the kills scenes are there.The good thing about F13th is that it looks so different from the others films (personal opinion) from the fictional place, to the characters, here you get to see the handsome, virgin (the main character and not so memorable) two horny girls, the clown (and one of the best characters in the franchise), the crac smokers, and some random biker guys.The Main character of the film named Chris, is not memorable due that her lines are soo cheesy, one of them are: ""He had a knife... and he attacked me with it!"" she also looks very insecure, the actress didnt perform that character properly. there are some rumors out there that she complaint about the ending (Chris was supposed to be killed) and about some nudity and sex scenes... In less words there were going to be more interesting scenes, if the original ending wasnt cancelled F13th part III would be the first and different film in the entire franchise.the producer had this idea coming to their head, to replace that good and DARK ending of the movie... replacing it with a CHEESY and stupid scene of Mrs. Voorhees popping out of the lake and grabbing chris, pulling her unders (another continuity error, and it was  a copycat of the first film) this is a continuity error, cause Chris never knew about Jason or Mrs. Voorhees. the characters doesnt mention the name of Jason throughtout of the film, so you will know..What really bugs me about this movie is that it has some serious plot holes and continuity errors, one example of them is that you could see Jason with some hairs over his head (part two) , but in this film he is completely bald, of course maybe there is an explanation to this, but it wasnt never explained in this film. ONE SERIOUS error that is very very annyoing is that the DVD case says ""A group of naive counselors"" and however, they were NOT counselors.Overall... if you can get past Chris, some plots holes, the lack of the 3d feature and the ending, you are good to go..",4,"One of the great 80s Horror Flick.. still, no 3D feature.",1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,3084,"['F13th', 'part', 'III', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'entire', 'franchise', '3D', 'feature', 'main', 'plot', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'cheesy', 'film', 'centers', 'one', 'day', 'later', 'part', 'II', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'last', 'minutes', 'part', 'II', 'things', 'didnt', 'see', 'movie', 'get', 'see', 'Jason', 'still', 'alive', 'breathing', 'then', 'mini', 'store', 'camp', 'crystal', 'lake', 'owners', 'then', 'new', 'clothes.After', 'group', '7', 'people', 'get', 'go', 'place', 'called', 'Higgins', 'haven', 'dont', 'know', 'spelled', 'right', 'mini', 'store', 'beginning', 'movie', 'place', 'not', 'camp', 'vacational', 'spot', 'teenagers', 'setting', 'sooo', 'incredible', 'specialy', 'house', 'barn', 'are', 'going', 'rewind', 'movie', 'everytime', 'see', 'just', 'sooo', 'great', 'lake', 'looks', 'swamp', 'not', 'exactly', 'can', 'see', 'water', 'not', 'clean', 'thing', 'movie', 'Jason', 'barn', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'almost', 'kills', 'scenes', 'are', 'there.The', 'good', 'thing', 'F13th', 'so', 'different', 'others', 'films', 'personal', 'opinion', 'fictional', 'place', 'characters', 'here', 'get', 'see', 'handsome', 'virgin', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'so', 'memorable', 'two', 'horny', 'girls', 'clown', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'franchise', 'crac', 'smokers', 'random', 'biker', 'guys.The', 'Main', 'character', 'film', 'named', 'Chris', 'not', 'memorable', 'due', 'lines', 'are', 'soo', 'cheesy', 'one', 'are', 'had', 'knife', 'attacked', 'also', 'very', 'insecure', 'actress', 'didnt', 'perform', 'character', 'properly', 'are', 'rumors', 'there', 'ending', 'Chris', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'killed', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'less', 'words', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'original', 'ending', 'wasnt', 'cancelled', 'F13th', 'part', 'III', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'different', 'film', 'entire', 'franchise.the', 'producer', 'had', 'idea', 'coming', 'head', 'replace', 'good', 'DARK', 'ending', 'movie', 'replacing', 'CHEESY', 'stupid', 'scene', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'popping', 'lake', 'grabbing', 'chris', 'pulling', 'unders', 'continuity', 'error', 'was', 'copycat', 'first', 'film', 'continuity', 'error', 'cause', 'Chris', 'never', 'knew', 'Jason', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'characters', 'doesnt', 'mention', 'name', 'Jason', 'throughtout', 'film', 'will', 'know..What', 'really', 'bugs', 'movie', 'serious', 'plot', 'holes', 'continuity', 'errors', 'one', 'example', 'could', 'see', 'Jason', 'hairs', 'head', 'part', 'two', 'film', 'completely', 'bald', 'course', 'maybe', 'explanation', 'wasnt', 'never', 'explained', 'film', 'ONE', 'SERIOUS', 'error', 'very', 'very', 'annyoing', 'DVD', 'case', 'A', 'group', 'naive', 'counselors', 'however', 'were', 'NOT', 'counselors.Overall', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'Chris', 'plots', 'holes', 'lack', '3d', 'feature', 'ending', 'are', 'good', 'go..']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

He first kills random people after the second ""counselor dispatch spree"" because he gets bored, and then our next group arrives.  They are no more cautious about Mr. Goalie than the other group from Part 2 was.  One by one, Jason gets them, including a group of gangsters who are there to seek revenge for an ugly confrontation in town that happened with the teenage counselors.  For some reason he leaves one unconcious (who has to say bye bye to his hand later) probably because he has no better weapon.  Eventually, he gets his hockey mask from Shelly, and then he mutilates everyone else except Dana Kimmell, who is literally the bravest girl you will ever see in these movies, except for maybe the physicic Tina in ""The New Blood"".  Going back to Kimmell, though, she stabs Jason, beats him down, and at the end gives him his sleepy medicine.  Of course, we all know that sleepy potion is only for a while.Some of the best, yet scary scenes in here are where Rick's face is squeezed out and where Jason's mask is taken off, revealing to Dana Kimmell that Jason is the person who chased her through the woods some time ago.  The only question is, why did he change his looks from long hair to bald?Oh, well; it doesn't matter.

211958,A11XKY4EIU2KNR,6300214311,"Johny Bottom ""Insane and lonely guitarist""","[1, 2]","Jason Voorhees has become the most beloved of Hollywood's strong, silent type. Part 3 is a step above Parts 1 &amp; 2. Although the first two films definately had their moments, Part 3 is where the famous 'Jasonesque' takes root and conquers America. Not only is Jason finally the way we want him to be, Part 3 also included a complex script with side stories and deeper character development. If you really analyze this film, you will see that not only does it have all the makings of an Acadamy Award, it is a brilliant tribute to directing. Let me explain.......This film is most infamous because Jason finally gets his hockey mask. He takes it off his victim (he also takes the speargun). The victim in question is a fat, pathetic white kid with a big afro. He is always pulling practical jokes, not to scare or hurt, but for attention. His friend asks him why he continues with his hijinks. Poeticly, he answers &quot;I'd rather be a loser than nothing at all'. How many here reading this right now have not told themselves the same thing? Everyone, all together, group hug.Even though this movie is early 80's it is far ahead of its time in social views. For the first time in a movie, a Latino / Hispanic American is represented in the form of a teenage girl. The story gives subtle yet obvious clues into her life. She has an argument with her 'mama' before heading out to the farm. Her mother doesn't want her hanging around her 'white hoodlum devil' friends. &quot;We don't take food stamps here!&quot; is a phrase I'm sure she's heard many times, but our fat loser saves the day with cash, but the wallet causes a whole other problem......The beautiful thing about this movie is that it breaks the social and racial barriers. A biker gang (consisting of course of three people) is post-racial. We have a white guy, a black guy, and a Spanish woman. See how the three of them get along as equals. Harmony for all, that is the real message of Friday the 13th Part 3.And lastly we have a tribute to our noble past, the 1960's. Two middle aged burnouts who have nothing to do with the story and who have nothing to contribute to the plot, simply become fodder for the machette. This is the director telling us that the glory days of drug abuse is over. Clean bodies and minds will lead us through the 80's, 90's and into the millenium. Drug users have no place in society's future and thank God it worked out that way.With plenty of action (tubby running over motorcycles with a VW Beetle to defend the honor of his hot tamale love interest) and suspense (will Jason survive a hanging and axe to the head?) to drama (who could have guessed the biker was alive in the barn the whole time? Swing that chain!) and finally the conclusion of this exciting and marvellous film.

211964,A3RY85QM7F3XF6,6300214311,Josh Brooks,"[1, 3]","It's the third entry in the Friday the 13th series. So what do we get that's new? Jason gets his mask, the film was filmed in 3d, and we get a lead chick who has a past with Jason. That's about all of the new. The original F13 formulas we love are there: the new group of teens who will eventually be offed in a variety of gruesome ways, the random people over the age of 30 who get offed, POV shots, the chichichi score (yet in disco form this time around!), and the lead chick who has no idea what's going on until the final showdown where she eventually survives but goes crazy. Yes! Good times in store.And good times are had with F13 pt 3. There were actually some characters that you begin to care about before Jason gets to them. The one who stuck out the most was Shelly, the awkward gore FX freak who only wanted to be accepted. I liked him. He should have been the hero instead of the heroine we got. Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, was a bit of a nuisance to me. I don't know why. I just didn't enjoy her.I do want to mention that this entry does have one of the creepiest moments in the series to me. Near the end, where Chris is in the canoe in the lake, and she sees Jason staring outside of a window sans his mask, and he growls? Yeah, creeps me out. And from this, I will go on to say that Steve Miner's (who later went on to director H20, a favorite of mine) vision of the film was great.But still, fun times are had with the film.

211965,A3GMS5XLDOIAJF,6300214311,Josh H.,"[3, 3]","Okay, I'm sick of people saying that ""Friday The 13th"" is just a rip-off of ""Halloween"".  That's ridiculous.  Jason Voorhies is a much better horror character than Michael Meyers could ever hope to be (call me crazy, but I didn't think that Meyers was scary at all).  That being said, now let me discuss this excellent movie.Originally seen in 3D when it hit the theaters in 1982, ""Friday The 13th Part 3"" is possibly the best movie in the whole series (and it's definitely the most gruesome).  The plot isn't exactly monumental, but who cares about the plot when you have such eerie, wicked murder scenes?Another reason I love this movie is the girls.  Dana Kimmell and Tracie Savage are two of the most beautiful female specimens that I've ever laid eyes on (Savage looks like a goddess in that blue bikini)!  Anyway, my hormones notwithstanding, the acting is actually not that bad.  Kimmell does by far the best acting job in the film, and she might just be the greatest heroine in the whole series.  The rest of the actors all do their best but they're nowhere near as good.This movie stands out among the others for two reasons.  First, it's the first one where Jason gets his infamous hockey mask (from one of his victims, no less).  And second, the murder scenes are much more graphic and sickening than in the first two (check out the eyeball-popping scene, among others).  Jason seems to be more confident than he had been before and would be since.This movie is DEFINITELY worth owning if you're a hardcore horror fan, like me.  You won't be disappointed.

The DVD now comes with a pair of 3D glasses, but I watched the standard version...I just don't really care. None of the ""Friday"" films can be called masterpieces and part 3 isn't much different from it's predecessors, but it's the weakest of the first three films as a result of low-quality acting, dialogue, and story.The first seven minutes serve as a recap of the last film and then we meet characters who we all know will be quickly dispatched by Jason so we can meet all the main characters. Returning director Steve Miner piles on the cheap scares leading up to Jason's first kill.Next we meet a large number of college kids heading out to a cabin in the woods for a weekend stay. Of course, Jason is already awaiting their arrival.No further description of the plot is needed; you all know what happens next. Part 3, as I said, does not differ much from the previous entries...22 minutes into the film we get the stereotypical old man character that warns the kids about the doom that awaits them.There are more problems with it. All of the actors are inexperienced and that's obvious. No one gave an Oscar-caliber performance in the other films either, but here...The actors seem shy and awkward. The dialogue and the delivery of it is atrocious. As if that's not bad enough, the movie has two stoner characters that are completely out of place. They both look about 10 years older than the others and their presence makes no sense.This, however, is the installment where Jason (played by Richard Brooker this time around) got his iconic hockey mask. Good thing too as Jason looks more funny than frightening without it.Most of my complaints about the movie are common for a slasher film. The whole concept of a slasher film is for a group of people to be systematically killed in interesting ways by some maniac, so why does dialogue and acting matter? Well, really, it doesn't. But I just don't see any of the actors, writers, or director having much passion for this project. It seems like they all just wanted to get it over with. It is that factor that makes this the weakest ""Friday"" up to this point.Luckily, ""Friday the 13th: Part Three"" does have it's moments of suspense and, for all it's faults, is entertaining. It's not a complete pile of garbage, but there's nothing impressive here.GRADE: C",3,Review for Non-3D Version,1247356800,"07 12, 2009",2009,2397,"['1982', 'saw', 'release', 'third', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'was', 'presented', '3D', 'DVD', 'now', 'pair', '3D', 'glasses', 'watched', 'standard', 'version', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'None', 'Friday', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'masterpieces', 'part', '3', ""n't"", 'much', 'different', 'predecessors', 'weakest', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'result', 'low-quality', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'story.The', 'first', 'seven', 'minutes', 'serve', 'recap', 'last', 'film', 'then', 'meet', 'characters', 'who', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'quickly', 'dispatched', 'Jason', 'can', 'meet', 'main', 'characters', 'Returning', 'director', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'piles', 'cheap', 'scares', 'leading', 'up', 'Jason', 'first', 'kill.Next', 'meet', 'large', 'number', 'college', 'kids', 'heading', 'cabin', 'woods', 'weekend', 'stay', 'course', 'Jason', 'already', 'awaiting', 'arrival.No', 'further', 'description', 'plot', 'needed', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'Part', '3', 'said', 'not', 'differ', 'much', 'previous', 'entries', '22', 'minutes', 'film', 'get', 'stereotypical', 'old', 'man', 'character', 'kids', 'doom', 'are', 'more', 'problems', 'actors', 'are', 'inexperienced', 'obvious', 'one', 'gave', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'other', 'films', 'here', 'actors', 'seem', 'shy', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'atrocious', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'movie', 'two', 'stoner', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'place', 'look', '10', 'years', 'older', 'others', 'presence', 'sense.This', 'however', 'installment', 'where', 'Jason', 'played', 'Richard', 'Brooker', 'time', 'around', 'got', 'iconic', 'hockey', 'mask', 'Good', 'thing', 'too', 'Jason', 'more', 'funny', 'frightening', 'it.Most', 'complaints', 'movie', 'are', 'common', 'slasher', 'film', 'whole', 'concept', 'slasher', 'film', 'group', 'people', 'be', 'systematically', 'killed', 'interesting', 'ways', 'maniac', 'so', 'why', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'matter', 'Well', 'really', ""n't"", 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'actors', 'writers', 'director', 'having', 'much', 'passion', 'project', 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'over', 'factor', 'weakest', 'Friday', 'up', 'point.Luckily', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', 'Three', 'have', 'moments', 'suspense', 'faults', 'entertaining', 'not', 'complete', 'pile', 'garbage', 'nothing', 'impressive', 'here.GRADE', 'C']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"
211968,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6300214311,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 2]","Friday The 13th part III went more for the gimmick route. I don't know if you know that I'm not a fan of 3D but I would be lying if I said that this movie didn't have some ok 3D. Plus back in the 80's they knew 3D was stupid. The movie had a budget of $2.5 miollion made $36 million. Directed by Steve Miner once again & for whatever reason he doesn't wan't to talk about Friday The 13th part 2 & III. It stars Dana Kimmell as Chris, Paul Krata as Rick, Larry Zerner as Shelly, Jeffery Rodgers as Andy, Catherine Parks as Vera, Rachel Howard as Chili, David Katams as Chuck, Traci Savage as Debbie & Richard Booker as Jason Voorhees. The story is pretty much staright forward taking place after part 2 Jason is going around this Ma & Pa Grocery Store on this couple named Harold & Edna own it. On The TV they are talking about what happend at Cap Crystal Lake where 8 people were killed so that confirms Paul wan't killed. Cause the victims were Terry, Scott, Sandra, Jeff, Mark, Vicki Crazy Ralph & a cop. Jason kills Harold & Edna. Then you go to this group of teens Chris, Debbie, Andy, Vera, Shelly, Chuck & Chili who are going to this Farm House in The Crystal Lake area. You have a bit of humor where they think the van is on fire & it's just Chuck & Chili smoking weed. They head off into the country there is this bum lying in the road he has an eye ball & he tells them to turn back. When they get to The Farm House you learn about Chris & Rick's relationship. Meanwhile you have a funny scene in town with these bikers & Shelly where he accidently backs the car into the biker gangs motorcycles. 1 of The Bikers Ali is mad it's funny when Ali & Shelly laugh at each other Ali busts out the windows on the car which happens to be Rick's car. You have the biker gang follow them to the farm. They try to syphon gas out of the van. This biker named Fox goofs around in the barn Loce another biker goes in tells her to stop. Fox is killed by Jason he takes a pitchfork stabs her in the throat with it he kills Loco with the pitchfork through the stomach. Ali goes in the barn Jason hits him with a wrench.That night Chris & Rick go out to the country side to talk she tells Rick about the night that she showed up late & her mother smacked her she ran away ended up getting lost in the woods & was attacked by a hideous man & it looks like Jason wants to do more than kill her. She fainted during the attack & awoke in her bed her parents never brought it up. Meanwhile Vera is at the dock where someone tries to pull her in the lake it's Shelly who is a prankster. His throat is slit in a grizzly way by Jason. Jason takes his hocky mask this is the introduction of the hockey mask. Vera accidently drops Shelly's wallet into the lake when she retrives it Jason is standing there Jason shoots her in the eye with a spear gun  it's a nice practical effect. Then heads into the house where after doing it Andy goes to get him & Debbie some beers. He's doing this handstand thing & Jason kills him in a very painful way. You have Debbie reading a Fangoria Magazine with an artical about Tom Savini. There is some blood dripping down she sees Andy has been killed then Jason stabs Debbie right through the hammock into her chest btw Debbie was pregnet so Jason ain't playing around. You have Chuck go into the basement to get the power working in the house Jason throws him into the fuse box where he is electrocuted. When Chili opens the door Shelly's body falls to the floor she thinks he's messing around but she discovers that oh yeah he's dead. She freaks out goes upstairs where she finds Debbie & Andy Jason takes a hot fire poker impales Chili with it. Chris & Rick come back to the house & Chris finds bloody clothes in the bath tub. Rick goes outside to see if he can find any. Chris calls out for Rick but Jason has him & covered his mouth when she goes back in Jason squeeze's his head until his eye balls pop out in a very good 3D effect. Jason goes after Chris he throws Rick's body through a window Chris goes into a closet she discovers Debbie's  body pulls out the knife starts attacking Jason with it. She stabs Jason in the leg. She gets into the bathroom escapes out a window takes a plank of wood hits Jason in the back of the head. She gets into the van tries to leave where the van shuts down on a wooden bridge & the bridge starts to break on the weight of the van. Jason grabs her she rolls the window up on his arm gets to the barn where he follows her she gets to the 2nd floor takes a shovel hits Jason with it she puts a noose around Jason & hangs him. When she starts to go outside Jason is still alive takes off the noose takes off his mask reveals that he is the 1 that attacked her that night. Ali who is still alive goes after Jason. Jason cuts Ali's hand off great practical effect then Jason continually stabs Alie while Jason is distracted it allows Chris to take an axe  strikes Jason in the head with the axe it's stuck & Jason dies. Then you have Chris take a canoe she falls asleep & the next morning she sees Jason in the house she tries to paddle out of there Jason comes outside but then she doesn't see him then the decaying courpse of Pamela Voorhees pops up grabs her it turns out to be a dream the police take a histarical Chris off & then the camera pans to Jason's dead body & then to Crystal Lake. Once again if I didn't do a good job explaining the plot in my retrospective I'm sorry about that. A good sequel to part 2. Not as good as part 2 & the stoner characters were pretty much fodder but there are still likeable characters good gore & a brutal Jason. Unfortantly no features on The Delux DVD except you can watch it in 3D. Steve Miner did a good job directing again. Dana Kimell was good. Paul Krata was good. Larry Zerner was decent. Jeffery Rodgers was decent. Davied Katims was just ther I didn't really care for him or Rachael Howard. Traci Savage was decent. Richard Booker made a really good Jason. The cast doesn't click as well as part 2 but their fine & this was a solid sequel. Next I will review Friday The 13th The Final Chapter.

Chris, it seems, is haunted by an earlier encounter with Jason, and her romantic entanglements with local boy Rick (Paul Kratka) do little to ease her nightmares. Meanwhile, the gruesome antics of Shelly (Larry Zerner), a chubby practical joker who just wants to be loved (and get laid), leads to an escalating case of the boy who cried wolf. When he's not incurring the wrath of leather-clad motorcyclists, he's annoying the other guests with his mock mutilations.

The MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D Blu-Ray is phenomenal when compared to this junk...but at least you get to see it in 3D the way it was meant. The 3D itself isn't that bad, it's the set-piece killings that fall flat. When a object gets forced into the foreground (3D's purpose!) the split image fails to coalesce properly with these glasses, but the 3D effect in ""normal"" situations is fine. The film was meant to be viewed in polarized fashion, not anaglyph. But MY BLOODY VALENTINE was also shown in polarized 3D and given the anaglyph treatment on DVD with no problems, so who knows..?Ok, rant over. The film rates a 4/5 stars in the Friday the 13th canon. The first four films are  the best, IMHO. The 2D version in Blu-Ray is probably the best we will ever get. I have compared every edition on DVD ever made for the US market through my 1080p HD projector onto a 100"" screen (I know, I'm lucky!) and the Blu-Ray is tops. I would also like to point out that it seems the exact same print was used to make every DVD. All the artifacts, dust, hairs in the camera gate, etc. are exactly the same in every version. So, again, this is probably the best we can expect, sans some kind of digital clean up, which I'd be against. Although, as noted in other reviews, the ""upgrade"" to the Blu-Ray from the Deluxe Edition is a matter of personal choice, my advice: If you plan on watching the film on a screen over 40"", then you might as well spend the extra $6 for the Blu-Ray.Extras are nice, but not mind blowing and certainly nothing new is covered for the die-hard fan....I'd rate the extras 3/5 stars.Overall, this is a welcome edition to my library. You may want to wait as the Blu-Ray will eventually fall in price, maybe even to the $12-$15 range by around November, as usual for these horror releases.This Blu-Ray DVD is probably the best quality they can muster from the print, so I say 'job well done'. 4/5 stars.

211971,A236PDCSYIOQBU,6300214311,"K. Cope ""Kcope""","[8, 8]","The Friday the 13th series is my favorite horror movie series, and Part 3 is my favorite. It has all the elements of a good horror movie, which I'll get to in a minute, and Jason I think is the creepiest he ever was.*This was the first horror movie I ever saw. It was on TV and I watched a part of it at age  7 or 8 while my parents weren't watching me :). I saw the shower part in the movie and needless to say I didn't take a shower for two weeks. I'd go in the bathroom and turn on the water, but I wouldn't get in because I was afraid I'd open the shower curtain and get an axe in the head. :)I know the chances of you reading my review out of 217 other peoples reviews, and I know that people have given this movie pretty high marks, as well as low. But I think this is the best movie out the series and here's why.I always look for three things in horror movies. The first is, is the movie well made and is the acting up to par. This movie looks creepy. It's kind of dark many times which just adds to the feel of it. It has that 1980's feel which really gives a horror movie an edge in my book. The scenes are all well put together and the directing is right up there. The acting is pretty good for the most part. Sometimes Cris is a little unbelievable in the beginning but she is the prettiest girl out of the whole series. The rest of the actors do a great job especially Jason.This is the movie that started the whole hockey mask mania. In the later movies, Jason got more of a personality, especially once Kane Hodder took over, but they kindof ruined the character for me. Jason is supposed to be a mindless emotionless killer, which is what makes him so scary. When they gave him emotions and facial expressions in part 7 and Fred Vs J, they ruined the character for me. In this movie, Jason walks creepy, takes his time and gives a great performance. Nice job.... uh..... guy.The next thing I look for is are the death sequences well done and believable. If you've read my other reviews you know nothing turns me off faster than an elaborate and stupid death sequences. In this film they do it right. They are all quick, show some blood but not too much and all could have really happened. With the exception of the spear gun through the eye, but I'm sure Jason is an excellent marksman.........I'm not going to argue with him.The last thing I look for in a horror movie is a great ending. I thought number two was pretty decent but had a lot of mistakes in it. Some things in the movie just don't make sense, especially the end. What dog was in the woods if that other white fluff ball came back??? but anyway....Part 3 really brings the first movie into play. It's a nice reverse at the end, without giving too much away. I always felt that this should have been the sequel, instead of two because of the way it ended.All in All this is a great horror movie. I would rank it number one in the series, with four next, then one, then probably the others, with the exception of seven. It's the first horror movie I ever saw, and it will always hold a special knife-hole in my heart. Alright so that wasn't funny, but this movie is great. My favorite scene is the fuse box when the guy gets the lights to go on, but who's behind him?????

211972,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,6300214311,K. Driscoll,"[4, 6]","It's hard to rate a film now that likely depended heavily on its effect in the theater.  Friday the 13th part 3 was released in the theater in 3-D.  3-D saw a popular revival in the early 1980s, so Steve Miner and Paramount Pictures wanted to follow-up his successful sequel to the original slasher film about Jason and his mom with a new sequel that could cash in even more.  It worked and Friday the 13th part 3 was a huge box-office success.  It grossed $36 million with a budget of $2.5 million.  Not too shabby.The same formula is here that exists in all of these films.  Part 3 takes place right after part 2.  Jason survives, grows a few inches and gains a few pounds and goes to a store where he changes into something more menacing than overalls.  He of course kills anything that might be alive along the way.  Jason waits in a barn unmasked and begins killing those who enter.  He eventually wanders out and obtains his iconic goalie mask.  Like any Friday the 13th film, it has gratuitous content but it is even more evident due to the fact that it is supposed to be in 3-D.  There are clearly some things that are intentionally meant to pop out at you but don't because the 3-D version is not available on DVD.  This insane girl Chris at the lakeside resort where Jason is killing all these people eventually chops Jason in the head and kills him.  In imitation of the first movie's big scare, she ends up in a canoe in the middle of the lake and Jason's mother's reassembled head and body leaps from the lake and drags her into the murky green deep.  It worked the first time in the first film, although that was even somewhat derivative.  It worked less so the second time in part 2 when Jason jumped through the window.  At this point, it isn't really that scary and how the hell did Pamela Voorhees sew her head back onto her body anyway?In Friday the 13th lore, there are rumors of an alternate ending which I think would've been far more appropriate and entertaining.  Instead of Chris dreaming Jason's mother jumps out of the lake, she dreams of Jason chopping off her head.  Part 3 really establishes the marketing drive behind these movies and Paramount took it and ran with it. It also established a Jason that was more worthy of audience cheers than screams.  Steve Miner had enough of this series and would not return for part 4.  I can see why, the series took a significant dive here and it would soon get worse.",2,Second Sequel Establishes the Iconic Status of Jason Voorhees,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,2439,"['hard', 'rate', 'film', 'now', 'likely', 'depended', 'heavily', 'effect', 'theater', 'Friday', '13th', 'part', '3', 'was', 'released', 'theater', '3-D.', '3-D', 'saw', 'popular', 'revival', 'early', '1980s', 'so', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'wanted', 'follow-up', 'successful', 'sequel', 'original', 'slasher', 'film', 'Jason', 'mom', 'new', 'sequel', 'could', 'cash', 'even', 'more', 'worked', 'Friday', '13th', 'part', '3', 'was', 'huge', 'box-office', 'success', 'grossed', '36', 'million', 'budget', '2.5', 'million', 'Not', 'too', 'shabby.The', 'same', 'formula', 'here', 'films', 'Part', '3', 'place', 'right', 'part', '2', 'Jason', 'few', 'inches', 'gains', 'few', 'pounds', 'store', 'where', 'something', 'more', 'menacing', 'overalls', 'course', 'kills', 'anything', 'might', 'be', 'alive', 'way', 'Jason', 'barn', 'unmasked', 'killing', 'who', 'enter', 'eventually', 'out', 'iconic', 'goalie', 'mask', 'Friday', '13th', 'film', 'gratuitous', 'content', 'even', 'more', 'evident', 'due', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', '3-D', 'are', 'clearly', 'things', 'are', 'intentionally', 'meant', 'pop', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", '3-D', 'version', 'not', 'available', 'DVD', 'insane', 'girl', 'Chris', 'lakeside', 'resort', 'where', 'Jason', 'killing', 'people', 'eventually', 'chops', 'Jason', 'head', 'imitation', 'first', 'movie', 'big', 'scare', 'up', 'canoe', 'middle', 'lake', 'Jason', 'mother', 'reassembled', 'head', 'body', 'leaps', 'lake', 'drags', 'murky', 'green', 'deep', 'worked', 'first', 'time', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'even', 'somewhat', 'derivative', 'worked', 'less', 'so', 'second', 'time', 'part', '2', 'when', 'Jason', 'jumped', 'window', 'point', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'how', 'hell', 'did', 'Pamela', 'Voorhees', 'sew', 'head', 'back', 'body', 'anyway', 'Friday', '13th', 'lore', 'are', 'rumors', 'alternate', 'ending', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'far', 'more', 'appropriate', 'entertaining', 'Instead', 'Chris', 'dreaming', 'Jason', 'mother', 'lake', 'Jason', 'chopping', 'off', 'head', '3', 'really', 'marketing', 'drive', 'movies', 'Paramount', 'took', 'ran', 'also', 'established', 'Jason', 'was', 'more', 'worthy', 'audience', 'cheers', 'screams', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'had', 'enough', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'return', 'part', '4', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'series', 'took', 'significant', 'dive', 'here', 'would', 'soon', 'get', 'worse']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

Miner seemed to take a novel approach with this one.  The B-movie shaky cameras are no-longer existent, making the film somewhat less thrilling.  At the same time, the humor that pervades this sequel comes off as corny, rather than funny.  Honestly, two dopeheads don't really belong in this series.  Save that for &quot;Halloween&quot;.  This movie started Jason's cult appearance, as he bares his trademark hockey mask and goes after college kids who invade his forest habitat.Contrary to what many fans believe, this one actually takes place at a separate camp ground, Higgins Haven, located just miles down the road from Crystal Lake.  And yet somehow, Jason manages to find them and kill them in fashionably violent, if not comical ways.  Entertaining still, but the series started to show its limits, and needed to go off in a different direction, which it does starting with the fourth installment.Probably one of the weaker sequels, but a benchmark film nonetheless.  It has its moments, and definitely captures the darkness provoked by its predecessors.

It serves no other purpose. Whereas the first two movies established the basic premise (the villain in part 2 takes up where his/her predecessor left off in part 1), ""Part III"" doesn't advance the scenario at all, merely restages the same plot as before: Teens take a weekend trip into the woods and are targeted for destruction by the seemingly unstoppable Jason.The plot is negligible, the characters conform to stereotype, and the constant stream of violent murders seems even more senseless than before. In fact, the indiscriminate nature of Jason's victims allows consistency to fall by the wayside, thereby signalling the film's status as little more than a mindless thrill-machine, the victim of lazy scriptwork by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson. To be fair, however, it's doubtful that a radical change in the basic scenario would have been acceptable to contemporary audiences. In 1982, these simple thrills were more than enough to ring the box-office bell, and woe betide any producer who dared to mess with a winning formula!The best efforts of sophomore director Steve Miner (also responsible for FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2, 1981) are compromised by two important factors: First, the cast seems to have been chosen on the basis of looks rather than acting ability, and the only character with a halfway decent plot-thread (the overweight guy whose feeble pranks are a desperate attempt to ingratiate himself with his peers) meets a predictably 'ironic' end long before his genuine emotional distress can be allowed to detract from the orchestrated mayhem. And secondly, the requirements of 3-D photography - in particular, the attention paid to the point of convergence from shot to shot, in order to prevent eyestrain and headaches in the audience - has resulted in visual and dramatic compromises, slowing the movie's rhythm and sapping all vitality from the narrative (this was true of many other 3-D movies which opened the following year). Seen in 3-D, the extra dimension is a genuinely effective novelty which enhances the viewing experience tenfold, from the opening credits (which seem to shoot out of the screen with startling clarity) through to the extended finale when Jason's rampage literally spills into the audience's lap. Viewed flat, for all its bloody violence and exaggerated body count, the film is a lumbering, pointless rehash of the first two entries, with no identity of its own.Followed by FRIDAY THE 13th: THE FINAL CHAPTER (1984).",2,Best viewed in 3-D...,989884800,"05 15, 2001",2001,2773,"['FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'PART', 'III', 'USA', '1982', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', '3-Depix', 'Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'MonoThough', 'not', 'entertainment', 'value', 'third', 'entry', 'long-running', 'series', 'initiated', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', '1980', 'more', 'disposable', 'fluff', 'reliant', '3-D', 'gimmick', 'draw', 'mass', 'audience', 'other', 'purpose', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'established', 'basic', 'premise', 'villain', 'part', '2', 'up', 'where', 'his/her', 'predecessor', 'left', 'off', 'part', '1', 'Part', 'III', ""n't"", 'advance', 'scenario', 'merely', 'same', 'plot', 'Teens', 'take', 'weekend', 'trip', 'woods', 'are', 'targeted', 'destruction', 'seemingly', 'unstoppable', 'Jason.The', 'plot', 'negligible', 'characters', 'conform', 'stereotype', 'constant', 'stream', 'violent', 'murders', 'even', 'more', 'senseless', 'before', 'fact', 'indiscriminate', 'nature', 'Jason', 'victims', 'consistency', 'fall', 'wayside', 'thereby', 'signalling', 'film', 'status', 'little', 'more', 'mindless', 'thrill-machine', 'victim', 'lazy', 'scriptwork', 'Martin', 'Kitrosser', 'Carol', 'Watson', 'be', 'fair', 'however', 'doubtful', 'radical', 'change', 'basic', 'scenario', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'acceptable', 'contemporary', 'audiences', '1982', 'simple', 'thrills', 'were', 'more', 'enough', 'ring', 'box-office', 'bell', 'woe', 'betide', 'producer', 'who', 'dared', 'mess', 'winning', 'formula', 'best', 'efforts', 'sophomore', 'director', 'Steve', 'Miner', 'also', 'responsible', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'PART', '2', '1981', 'are', 'compromised', 'two', 'important', 'factors', 'First', 'cast', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'basis', 'rather', 'acting', 'ability', 'only', 'character', 'halfway', 'decent', 'plot-thread', 'overweight', 'guy', 'feeble', 'pranks', 'are', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'ingratiate', 'peers', 'predictably', ""'ironic"", 'end', 'long', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'distress', 'can', 'be', 'allowed', 'detract', 'orchestrated', 'mayhem', 'secondly', 'requirements', '3-D', 'photography', 'particular', 'attention', 'paid', 'point', 'convergence', 'shot', 'shot', 'order', 'prevent', 'eyestrain', 'headaches', 'audience', 'resulted', 'visual', 'dramatic', 'compromises', 'slowing', 'movie', 'rhythm', 'sapping', 'vitality', 'narrative', 'was', 'true', 'many', 'other', '3-D', 'movies', 'opened', 'following', 'year', 'Seen', '3-D', 'extra', 'dimension', 'genuinely', 'effective', 'novelty', 'viewing', 'experience', 'tenfold', 'opening', 'credits', 'seem', 'shoot', 'screen', 'startling', 'clarity', 'extended', 'finale', 'when', 'Jason', 'rampage', 'literally', 'audience', 'lap', 'Viewed', 'flat', 'bloody', 'violence', 'exaggerated', 'body', 'count', 'film', 'lumbering', 'pointless', 'rehash', 'first', 'two', 'entries', 'identity', 'own.Followed', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'FINAL', 'CHAPTER', '1984']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

All the rest of the Deluxe Editions have loads of great extras to fill out the disc. I rented the Blu-Ray just to see what there was. As another reviewer posted in their review, here are the extras exclusive to the Blu-Ray copy:FRESH CUTS: 3D TERROR - 12:51Solid feature that explains how the movie came to be plus the original idea before it became the movie we know; the 3D process is also covered and overall this was a solid feature that gives us enough info, but does leave you wanting slightly more, but overall it's a solid feature. Interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Larry Zerner, Richard Brooker, Sandi Love, Douglas White.LEGACY OF THE MASK - 9:32Another strong feature, which explains how Jason got the mask and overall it was a fun feature and it also gets into the mask in the rest of the movies plus Jason's look through out the series; brief, but to the point; interviews with Peter Bracke, Martin Jay Sadoff, Richard Brooker, Douglas White, Larry Zerner.SLASHER FILMS: GOING FOR THE JUGULAR - 7:06Another strong feature, which covers quickly what, makes these movies work so well and this might be my favorite feature on the disc even if we've seen numerous documentaries and books on this subject I still always find it entertaining. My only complaint is that it's too brief; Ari Lehman, Stu Charno, Tony Todd, Del Howison, Tony Moran, Harry Manfredini, Richard Brooker, Robbi Morgan and Larry Zerner appear.LOST TALES FROM CAMP BLOOD- PART 3 - 4:47This is a short film written and directed by Andrew Ceperley and the first 2 parts can be found on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the first 2 movies; this one can only be seen on the Blu-ray for Part 3.

211986,A1V5G1O9TRGO7M,6300214311,matt,"[8, 10]","Friday the 13th part 3 is a relatively good third entry in this extremely popular series.  Part 3 stands out with some very good acting and some great shocks-including one very frightening final confrontation with the masked killer.The plot is nothing terribly original-or even existant-but the characters are a little bit more fleshed out than usual and some of the murders are truly shocking (the sphere in the eye, the pitchfork in the barn and the throat slashing of Shelley).  People who follow the series from afar have pointed out that Jason looks terribly different than in the previous film (which took place the previous day).  This is entirely untrue.  Jason is a little bigger this time out, but he's still a wild child, malformed and creepy to the extreme.  Richard (Jason) Brooker played a very underrated Jason, the entire chase at the film's finish is almost worth the price of this DVD alone.  Brooker's Jason is part wild child and part methodical assassin, a hunter both brilliant and untamed.  Jason is what's lurking in the woods at night when you sleep.  He's a creepy character and here in part 3, he's totally effective.Paramount's DVD is pretty well done, the film looks great in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format, the transfer is very nice.

My boyfriend thankfully saw it at the cinema in 3D, and explained why the credits and everything else seems to come towards the camera at random points in the film. However, it does work well in 2D, but it still would have been good to see it in 3D. There's some gory scenes that would have had you ducking in your seat.As much as I liked Friday 13 III, there are a few similarities to the previous movies. Able (the old man near the beginning) is much like Crazy Ralph from the first two films. It's a shame he only had a small part, cos Crazy Ralph's part was extended. Some of the other similar scenes include: Debbie seeing drops of blood falling from above, she looks up and a knife goes through her throat, almost exactly the same as Kevin Bacon's scene in the first film; after Chris thinks she had killed Jason she goes to sleep in a canoe on the lake much like Alice did in the first film; and when Chris awakes from the canoe Mrs. Voorhees comes out of the water and drags her under water much like what Jason did to Alice in Part 1.You actually see Jason smiling in this film, which is quite freaky. I didn't feel as sorry for him in this film as I did in the last (with his mother), but there are a couple of odd bits, which I ended up thinking about. I'm not sure whether my boyfriend gave me this impression, or the film did, but there is the idea that the reason why Jason didn't kill Chris is because she passed out, so he decided to rape her. And her parents never told her what happened while she was out. But I just don't think Jason has the mental capability to rape someone. Considering how young he ""died"", he probably didn't know about the ""birds & the bees"" then. But then my boyfriend thinks he did rape her. It's one of those puzzling aspects of this movie.The other puzzling thing about this movie (which I JUST worked out - how blonde am I?) is it's Friday 13th part 3 - but it's not actually SET on a Friday 13th. It actually takes place the day after the events of Part 2, making it Saturday the 14th. While the beginning of the movie takes place on the evening of Saturday the 14th, when the overweight store owner and his nagging wife are killed, the majority of the movie takes place on the following day, making it Sunday the 15th.From various reviews, I've heard this is the last ""good"" Friday 13th movie. (Apart from Freddy vs Jason, is that included?) If that's the case, I still have the rest to watch! The only thing I wasn't keen on in this was the recap from the previous Friday 13th. Yes, it's always good to have a little reminder, but at this point, you just want to get on with the new film. Hopefully, the rest of the movies won't be as bad as everyone says they are.",3,Disappointing not to see it in 3D,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,2766,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'local', 'cinema', 'again', 'soon', 'boyfriend', 'thankfully', 'saw', 'cinema', '3D', 'explained', 'why', 'credits', 'everything', 'else', 'come', 'camera', 'random', 'points', 'film', 'However', 'work', 'well', '2D', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'see', '3D', 'gory', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'ducking', 'seat.As', 'much', 'liked', 'Friday', '13', 'III', 'are', 'few', 'similarities', 'previous', 'movies', 'Able', 'old', 'man', 'beginning', 'much', 'Crazy', 'Ralph', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'shame', 'only', 'had', 'small', 'part', 'cos', 'Crazy', 'Ralph', 'part', 'was', 'extended', 'other', 'similar', 'scenes', 'include', 'Debbie', 'seeing', 'drops', 'blood', 'falling', 'up', 'knife', 'throat', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'scene', 'first', 'film', 'Chris', 'had', 'killed', 'Jason', 'sleep', 'canoe', 'lake', 'much', 'Alice', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'Chris', 'canoe', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'water', 'water', 'much', 'what', 'Jason', 'did', 'Alice', 'Part', '1.You', 'actually', 'see', 'Jason', 'smiling', 'film', 'quite', 'freaky', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'film', 'did', 'last', 'mother', 'are', 'couple', 'odd', 'bits', 'ended', 'up', 'thinking', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'boyfriend', 'gave', 'impression', 'film', 'did', 'idea', 'reason', 'why', 'Jason', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Chris', 'passed', 'out', 'decided', 'rape', 'parents', 'never', 'told', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'out', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Jason', 'mental', 'capability', 'rape', 'someone', 'Considering', 'how', 'young', 'died', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'birds', 'bees', 'then', 'then', 'boyfriend', 'did', 'rape', 'one', 'puzzling', 'aspects', 'movie.The', 'other', 'puzzling', 'thing', 'movie', 'JUST', 'worked', 'out', 'how', 'blonde', 'am', 'Friday', '13th', 'part', '3', 'not', 'actually', 'SET', 'Friday', '13th', 'actually', 'place', 'day', 'events', 'Part', '2', 'making', 'Saturday', '14th', 'beginning', 'movie', 'place', 'evening', 'Saturday', '14th', 'when', 'overweight', 'store', 'owner', 'nagging', 'wife', 'are', 'killed', 'majority', 'movie', 'place', 'following', 'day', 'making', 'Sunday', '15th.From', 'various', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'last', 'good', 'Friday', '13th', 'movie', 'Apart', 'Freddy', 'vs', 'Jason', 'included', 'case', 'still', 'have', 'rest', 'watch', 'only', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'keen', 'was', 'recap', 'previous', 'Friday', '13th', 'Yes', 'always', 'good', 'have', 'little', 'reminder', 'point', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'new', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'rest', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'everyone', 'are']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

211992,A2E9TRM8096BXU,6300214311,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[4, 5]","It is not easy to say which one of the F-13 movies is the best. Each of the first four adds a little more to the grim story of Jason Voorhees until they come to their bloody (if temporary) finale in ""The Final Chapter."" I think everyone would agree, however, that despite the gimmick of 3-D, which was enjoying one of its brief revivals of interest back in '82, and despite the ususal undertone of silliness that marks all of these films, that Part III is a damned good slasher movie, and one which will go down in horror-movie history as the ""one where Jason got his mask.""Part III picks up almost immediately where Part II left off, with a wounded Jason Voorhees resuming his killing spree at a roadside convenience store run by a sadly likeable man and his shrilling hag wife. After this further reduction of the population of Crystal Lake, we are introduced to this movie's batch of victims: a husband-wife pair of stoners, a horny teen couple, an annoying prankster, a snobby-hot girl, a dudely-doorite with a torch for the troubled heroine, and the heroine herself. Via an incident at yet another roadside store, we also meet three Central Casting bikers who are dumb enough to think they will be the film's antagonists, but who merely present additional fodder for Jason's knife. All these unfortunates convene at Higgins' Hideaway, the ususal rustic house set beside the usual rustic barn. There's just one problem. Jason's in the barn!There obviously is no need to go into the plot. All F-13 films are essentially plot-free, the ""story"" merely being how each individual sucker will die at Jason's hands, and how the heroine (for it is almost always a girl, though sometimes she has male help) will ultimately put the pause button on Jason's crusade to curb teenage sex and marijuana abuse in Crystal Lake. In that regard the film delivers fairly well, beginning with more or less ordinary kills and ramping up to some truly savage acts of violence, not the least of which is one poor slob who gets a machete right through the crown jewels, and another whose head gets crushed like a rotten tomato in a vice.Now, I am only giving credit where it is due to say that some of these poor people are actually fairly well-drawn, and that the actors all do credible [or better] jobs of conveying their characters' limited personalities. I truly didn't want some of these folks to die, which of course adds to the suspense. What's more, the scene in which Jason finally appears with his newfound hockey mask is not only a piece of horror-movie history, it's also a damned effective piece of visual terrorism. And the movie's climax is just relentless, with the violently active Jason tearing the barn to pieces trying to get at our long-suffering heroine. There are a lot of real jumpy moments in this flick, a couple of nice in-jokes (""Fangoria"" magazine, for example) and the shrieking musical score by Harry Manfredini only adds to the viewer's jangled nerves.To be sure the film has its problems. All slasher films, and FRIDAY films in particular, depend upon the extreme stupidity of the characters and their complete failure to exercise common sense or even rudimentary brain-function (""Go down to the cellar and check the fuse box."") Also on the audience's willingness to swallow a lot of preposterous occurances, some of which are just plain physically impossible. Part III is no exception. Nearly everyone in the movie is clueless, and their collective failure to notice the hulking murderer with the deformed head constantly walking in and out of a barn 30 feet from their house is cause for dismay. The fact that the Jason had a machete plunged halfway through his torso at the climax of Part II is not in much in evidence here either; since he doesn't become truly supernatural until Part VI, it's hard to explain how that wouldn't effect his performance, or how he survives some of the abuse he takes in this film while trying to put down the heroine. What's more, in regards to the need for greater acts of violence, I was personally offended by the choice of making one of the victims pregnant, and on top of that killing her via a red-hot poker through the belly. The dude in the wheelchair from ""II"" was bad enough, but a pregnant woman impaled on a poker? Come on, man. That's just vulgar.Having said that, this is my personal fave of all the FRIDAY films. If you can ignore the many gratuitous shots of yo-yos and cigarette butts and popcorn flying at the camera to show off a 3-D effect you can't see, this is definitely the slasher flick for you.",4,"""Go down to the cellar and check the fuse box.""

Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[1, 2]","While FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 2 left some to be desired, the ending to that movie was satisfying and ultimately led us into this third and impressive entry into the popular horror series. While the intro credits score was a little cheesy, the movie itself is anything but that. Thanks to a better cast, a biker gang, and a little more believable hormone-driven agenda, this entry is worthwhile for all fans of the series. While no longer presented in 3-D on DVD (the 3-d was cool), you can still feel hints of that technology in some of the movies scenes featuring Jason's weapons of choice.Once again, Camp Crystal Lake is open for business and another population of sex-inspired teens are on duty for more. Not only that, but we also have a biker gang that adds more to the movie than just the counselors...now anyone can go if Jason don't like you...and he doesn't. He wastes no time in dispatching away one counselor or biker after the other (the biker that got the pitchfork got the worst of it, ouch!). This is also the first movie where Jason finally dons the hockey mask, which is now a most sought after costume accessory where I'm from. There are many good scenes in the movie, especially where poor Jason is hanging and then finally gets free...there's just no way to stop him, he seems to be invincible. The ending, of course, leaves the movie open for what would be one of the most superior of the series, THE FINAL CHAPTER.But while you sift through the series, don't skip over this little goody. This a landmark in the series as it shows the first scenes of Jason in his official mask. FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 3 is a must-see for anyone who wants to see where Jason ""officially"" came to life.

The images ghost into chaos before that ever happens.  So, if you were looking forward to seeing Jason fire a speargun at you, don't get your hopes up.

212000,A1COG8T9MPP3KA,6300214311,"Mount_Olympus ""pegasusblue""","[1, 1]","First let me say this film is very nostalgic to me. I was fortunate enough to see it in its original theatrical 3-D release. I remember the credits coming out at you in 3-D. As a kid, It was a thrill for me, scary and exciting. Part 3 is my favorite film out of  11 Jason films. I had read this was the most profitable 3-D theatrical release ever. That may have changed with the new onslaught of 3-D movies. While we are at it, My Bloody Valentine 3D was loads of fun!I almost fell out of my chair when I read this Friday the 13th was being released as a special version. I went out immediately and bought it. I must say this DVD must be making some money because many stores had sold out of it, but had plenty of the other 2 special releases in stock. I finally snagged the last copy from Best Buy.My favorite part of the film was the 3-D opening credits. I am even one of those rare birds that dig the theme song. I even own the theme song. It was written by Harry Manfredini under the name of Hot Ice.I am really let down by the opening credits not being in 3-D. Why? I cannot understand this glaring omission. I skimmed through the movie to see how effective the 3-D effects were.Here is a rundown of some of the effects (but not all of them):The first noticeable effect was the laundry pole being handled by Harold. It literally came out right in front of my face. Excellent.The snake in the rabbit cage. Not so good. I saw 2 snakes. (there should only be one)Passing the joint in the van: again I saw double vision here. Not so good.The bum holding the eyeball up to the camera. This time it worked excellent.Lifting the hay into the barn and the hay swaying back and forth on the rope was good. Again this worked great. The depth was excellent, almost dizzying.The fist through the car glass. Not so good.The yo-yo scene: the first part wasn't working but the last few swings really did came straight out of the screen.The gas siphon scene seemed to have perfect clarity and amazing depth. The whole film should have looked like this.The two thugs getting a pitchfork in the barn. Only average here. Could have been better. But the pitchfork handle did come out of the screen.The juggling scene. It was effective. Not bad but not great. The room depth was good here.Kris telling about her encounter with Jason. Her head seemed to float around while the story played in the background behind her. This was good. I don't even remember this scene being in 3-D.The harpoon in the eye scene did not seem to work to well for me. I tried it several times. This was suppose to be the highlight effect of the film. It just happened so fast.The popcorn worked. I think it would work better on a bigger screen.The hippy getting electrocuted; the sparks flew out of the screen, very cool.Effects that did not work. The female hippy with the fire poker through her. And the boy doing the hand stand and getting a machete in his hoo hoo, neither of these had much effect.The eyeball popping out of the head. This was funny, because when the eyeball pops out, you can hear a horn beep. Like a horn at the end of a joke by Groucho Marx. I don't remember the horn noise LOL. Oh and yes the eyeball scene worked very well.Other minor effects: Jason throws a knife at Chris. Jason plummets through the front porch and grabs at Kris.Jason being hung. This worked well as far as the depth. The rope seemed to be on the outside of the screen.Jason getting the meat cleaver in the head and putting his hands out to the camera. Worked excellent, very exciting!All in all it is kind of a headache watching this thing. But I thought the sound was of a much better quality than the earlier Friday Part 3 DVD I have. I really didn't get the ending where Jason's mother pops up out of the water, but hey what part of the movie is realistic anyway? I am glad to have this.

Well, that is somewhat typical of slasher films. Friday the 13th doesn't have a continuous story line until Part 4 (aka the Final Chapter). Anyway, on with the review. The two things I like about Part 3 is that it is short-to the point and Jason obtains the one thing that stuck with him for sequels to come...the hockey mask.

Is this because the plot has gotten any better? No. Is this because the acting has improved? No. Is this because there's substance to the murders this time? Definitely not. This one is just simply likable in spite of the fact that it plays just like the first two films. Jason rises from the dead once more to prey on another batch of teens at the now infamous Camp Crystal Lake. There's plenty of gore this time for sure. There's also a much more thrilling atmosphere this time around as well as a much-welcomed sense of humor. Being that i wasn't alive when the original theatrical releases of almost any of the 80's Friday The 13th movies occurred, I only saw the video releases of these movies as a kid in the early 90's. But, I always hear that the original release of this movie was in 3-D. While i already liked this movie the way it is, I always was curious about what this movie was like in 3-D and would be happy if Paramount re-released this movie on DVD with the original 3-D version included. Anyway, This was a rather surprisingly enjoyable installment in the Friday series. This one is also notable for the debut of the now famous hockey mask that Jason is known for wearing in the movies. I reccomend this one to horror fans who don't want to think too much about the murder and mayhem that they're gonna see.

""normadesmondlives!""","[1, 2]","YES, like Jaws 3, Amityville 3, and countless others during the early 80s, Friday the 13th jumped on the 3D bandwagon.  Out of the 3D movies I mention here, Friday the 13 may have been the best (Amityville was awful and boring, and Jaws was just plain laughable).  I must say that this is not one of my favorites of the series though. It ranks pretty low on my list.  The only 2 things that even make this entry notable is the fact that it was done in 3D and also this is the entry where Jason gets the infamous HOCKEY MASK. One reason for my dislike is that the acting was below average and most of the characters unappealing and drab.  The lead female, Chris, played by Dana Kimmel was not the right choice.  She sounded so whiny whenever she said anything and her back story had more holes in it than Jason's hockey mask.  One funny thing that I always like to bring up, is that this is the ONLY entry in the entire series that no one mentions the name ""Jason Voorhees"".  Kinda strange, considering the fact that in every other entry everyone seems to know of and fear ""'ol Jason"". No one seems to even mention Crystal Lake (execept for the news broadcast on tv), Mrs. Voorhees, or the murders that just happened from part 2 (which in this movie they make it seem like it only happened days before).  It just doesn't seem like this one fits in with all the rest in the series. Some other aspects that leave me dry is the location this was filmed.  The ""lake"" did not live up to the famous name, it looked like a polluted creek.  You can tell this was filmed in a tropical climate because in one shot you can even see a friggin' palm tree (this was filmed in CA, opposed to the first 2 which were filmed on the east coast). However, some of the 3D effects are rather interesting (even though we don't see it in actual 3D on the dvd).  You can tell which parts were meant to be 3D (pitchfork handles, popcorn popping, a yo-yo, a squished eyeball popping outta a guy's head, a shooting spear gun).  The ending of this one reaches new depths of silliness.  They basically rip-off the ending of the 1st film but with NONE of the style or shock.  Chris is in a canoe when an apparent Mrs. Voorhees (with her head mysteriously back on) jumps out of the lake and pulls Chris under.  Even if it was a dream, it doesn't make much sense because no one mentions Jason or Mrs. Voorhees in the movie, so I doubt Chris would be dreaming about being attacked by someone she's never (to our knowledge) heard of.  But, this entry made a killing at the box office, making the 2nd biggest profit of the series, after part 1 (without counting Freddy vs. Jason which did huge numbers).",3,I got blood on my 3D glasses!,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,2666,"['YES', 'Jaws', '3', 'Amityville', '3', 'countless', 'others', 'early', '80s', 'Friday', '13th', 'jumped', '3D', 'bandwagon', '3D', 'movies', 'mention', 'here', 'Friday', '13', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'Amityville', 'was', 'awful', 'boring', 'Jaws', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'laughable', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'one', 'favorites', 'series', 'pretty', 'low', 'list', 'only', '2', 'things', 'even', 'make', 'entry', 'notable', 'fact', 'was', 'done', '3D', 'also', 'entry', 'where', 'Jason', 'infamous', 'HOCKEY', 'MASK', 'One', 'reason', 'dislike', 'acting', 'was', 'below', 'average', 'most', 'characters', 'unappealing', 'drab', 'lead', 'female', 'Chris', 'played', 'Dana', 'Kimmel', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'choice', 'sounded', 'so', 'whiny', 'whenever', 'said', 'anything', 'back', 'story', 'had', 'more', 'holes', 'Jason', 'hockey', 'mask', 'One', 'funny', 'thing', 'always', 'bring', 'up', 'ONLY', 'entry', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'name', 'Jason', 'Voorhees', 'Kinda', 'strange', 'considering', 'fact', 'other', 'entry', 'everyone', 'know', 'fear', ""'ol"", 'Jason', 'one', 'even', 'mention', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'news', 'broadcast', 'tv', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'murders', 'just', 'happened', 'part', '2', 'movie', 'make', 'only', 'happened', 'days', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'one', 'rest', 'series', 'other', 'aspects', 'leave', 'dry', 'location', 'was', 'filmed', 'lake', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'famous', 'name', 'looked', 'polluted', 'creek', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'filmed', 'tropical', 'climate', 'one', 'shot', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'friggin', 'palm', 'tree', 'was', 'filmed', 'CA', 'opposed', 'first', '2', 'were', 'filmed', 'east', 'coast', 'However', '3D', 'effects', 'are', 'rather', 'interesting', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'actual', '3D', 'dvd', 'can', 'tell', 'parts', 'were', 'meant', 'be', '3D', 'pitchfork', 'handles', 'popcorn', 'popping', 'yo-yo', 'squished', 'eyeball', 'popping', 'guy', 'head', 'shooting', 'spear', 'gun', 'ending', 'one', 'new', 'depths', 'silliness', 'basically', 'rip-off', 'ending', '1st', 'film', 'NONE', 'style', 'shock', 'Chris', 'canoe', 'when', 'apparent', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'head', 'mysteriously', 'back', 'lake', 'pulls', 'Chris', 'Even', 'was', 'dream', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'one', 'mentions', 'Jason', 'Mrs.', 'Voorhees', 'movie', 'doubt', 'Chris', 'would', 'be', 'dreaming', 'being', 'attacked', 'someone', 'never', 'knowledge', 'heard', 'entry', 'made', 'killing', 'box', 'office', 'making', '2nd', 'biggest', 'profit', 'series', 'part', '1', 'counting', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'did', 'huge', 'numbers']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

I would classify this one, the second of many sequels to come as my next favorite! One of the things I enjoyed the most about it was Dana Kimmell's performance. Her character Chris is more layered than the female heroine characters in the other films (although Lar Park Lincoln did a good job as telekinetic Tina in part VII). Chris is troubled from a traumatic experience that is still running around in her mind. When Chris and her friends go away for the weekend, she begins to see and hear things. Is it just her imagination or has someone from the past returned? The chase sequence in the end is also my favorite in the entire series. It's long, but not too long and there are some very suspenseful moments to savor. Dana Kimmell is so enjoyable to watch, and I liked that her character was the ""morally proper"" type that one can respect and admire. After the night is over, the whole ordeal will have been too much for Chris as she goes off the deep end and into hysterics. I thought that was a very realistic approach for someone who has gone through something like this. The atmosphere has a very spooky touch to it and the high winds at night were great as opposed to using the rain we see so many times in a horror film. I would say that Jason is the scariest in this one (and also The Final Chapter) plus the murders were all very unique and different.This film sets itself apart from the others in a few different ways. This does not take place at Crystal Lake but at a place called Higgen's Haven. Maybe it's near Crystal Lake but the film never specifies. However a mummified Mrs. Voorhees does make a brief appearance in the lake near the end when she pulls Chris out of the canoe much like how Jason did with Alice in the original film. I thought that was a nice touch. The characters in this film also never say the name ""Jason"" as in the others. It's almost as if it were a completely different movie. This was one of the most successful at the box office (not counting Freddy vs. Jason) making almost as much as the first film. Obviously, having the 3D factor also sets it apart, but I have never seen it in that form. As a horror film, I would easily give this 4 stars but Dana makes it a 5!

Now in the real film, the opening titles show a cool 3-D effect with the credits popping out with this cool, funky music playing in the backround.Well, we open to the film with the teens. But what I found unusual about this one was that instead of Camp Crystal Lake, they go to this little barnyard, because its like a farmhouse, with a barn, which was a cool setting for me though.One of my favorite actors in this film was actually the comedic relief Larry Zerner. I know this is a really random useless fact, Larry Zerner was on the game show ""1 vs. 100"" and didn't mention Friday the 13th III, but back to the film,  he is the comic relief, playing pranks on everybody. Plus, this guy is also how Jason recieves his hockey mask, because he scares a woman by popping up under the lake wearing it, and then drops it in the barn.I also love the ending to this movie was sort of a reference to the first film, and literally is a SPOT ON remake of the ending of the first ending, exept with Jason running out of the house without his mask on.The deluxe edition DVD has a 3D feature, and the movie comes with 3D glasses which are really cool looking.

We all know what the story is about, or lack thereof. Actually, I found this sequel to be the most scariest since its original film, with Jason creeping in and out of the barn, as this was the first film Jason gets his hockey mask, which would later become his trademark.FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 has an amazing menu board, identical to the frontal video cover. Also, there is an amazing theatrical trailer that was the best I seen that would make me want to see this movie in an instant. And best of all, this is the only film in the Friday series to be presented in full widescreen (2.35:1) format, with the picture and sound quality that could never have sounded better. When I was watching this film on DVD, it was like watching another movie as there was more imagery, never seen fully as the former pan & scan VHS version definitely need the full widescreen treatment.Although the first two films are great on DVD, this is the title to WATCH on DVD.

However, Jason really is quite dumb when you look at these movies objectivly. This crap can't decide if its B or not. That should never be a question. If its us, we're going B all the way. Instead of giving Jason that dumb limp, why not have him hop merrily from one foot to the other while chasing down his victims? The thing that made this one ridiculous was that the plot was predictable and there weren't any of those ""how did they get to this point?"" moments. A distictly non-B characteristic! Anyway, the only reason we decided on this one was because we remembered watching it years ago and marveling at the fact that these idiots kept going into the barn to get killed. They all looked like cows being led to slaughter. It would have been a 5-star effort if Jason was waiting in the barn, jumped out of a giant stocking, then killed. But, he didn't. That's why all these nerds loved it. The only saving grace was the fat kid. We couldnt wait for him to get offed, only they should have had DMX do it with his giant chain.

People that say otherwise are simply mis-remembering something from nearly 30 years ago. It just didn't happen. THe colored glasses have rarely been used for 3-D movies. Even in the 1950's all the movies were shown using polarized light and clear glasses. The anaglyphic downconversions came later, via TV broadcast and re-issue.The theatrical version of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART III was excellent, with full color, great depth and amazing off the screen gimmicks. The opening titles shot off the screen and seemed to come right to the end of your nose. Audiences screamed with delight at them at each screening I saw.While Paramount released a good field sequential version in 3-D years ago via a Japanese disc format, they have chosen to present this latest DVD in a red/cyan anaglyphic conversion only, so that it can be viewed on any TV with a simple pair of cardboard glasses.How does it look? Just OK.  NOTHING like the original 3-D version, though. Gimmicks tend to disolve into double images here, the color is thrown off through the colored lenses, and the picture isn't so sharp. Worst of all...the wonderful opening titles are only in 2-D form! I guess they felt an anaglyph version of them wouldn't work well.

It's probably the least distinguished and least distinct of its series, but it succeeds in spite of itself.  There are some interesting ideas (that could have been fleshed out more), but also some seeming contradictions in the time scale.  There are some likable characters (though not to the level of ""Part 2""'s overall cast) and some less likable ones.  The girls are very pretty.In the last 20 minutes or so, the quality of the film picks up sharply.  Prevoiusly a good watch, it suddenly starts to attain the superior feel and spirit of its two predecessors, almost but not quite making it to their level, albeit a little late.Obviously much of the appeal of the original theatrical release was its 3-D nature, but unfortunately it is not available over here in that format, despite the capacity of DVD to support it, nor does it look like it'll get a domestic release in 3D anytime soon.  In that case I wish they'd re-release it theatrically, because even though its not one of the best Fridays, I'd still love a chance to give the 3D version a chance.

212046,A26A8T38C2GQD7,6300214311,Taheen Lopez,"[3, 3]","FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III is an awesome sequel and was the sequel that made both the brutal Jason Voorhees & his hockeymask an icon and still to this very day, since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 was the the first installment to the FRIDAY THE 13TH saga phenomenom where Jason(Richard Brooker) uses his hockeymask, which was a marvelous improvement and upgrade from his bagged mask in FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2 along with the fact that FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III was the first and only FRIDAY THE 13TH sequel to be in 3-D, which was part of what made this movie so popular and such a big hit when it hit theatres back in the Summer of 1982 when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 during Ronald Reagan's presidency, which reminds me that FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 was released the same year as HALLOWEEN 3:THE SEASON OF THE WITCH, which was released in the Fall of 1982.I also thought it was really cool how they had displayed all the credits at the beginning of FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 the way they had zoomed the words and letters of the credits in and back out instead of just using a black screen to display the credits right after after they had gotten through with showing scenes from FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 2 where Paul(John Furey) and Ginny(Amy Steel) have a scuffle with Jason and barely get on with their lives after Ginny stabs Jason(Warrington Gillette).In addition, FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III was the 3rd FRIDAY THE 13TH installment 3 years in a row, since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 3 had been made a year later after FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART II was released in 1981 and released 2 years later after the original FRIDAY THE 13TH hit theatres in the Summer of 1980, plus I think director Steve Miner did an awesome job at directing both FRIDAY THE 13TH-PARTS 2 and 3 too, since Steve Miner has also directed other big hit horror flicks like HOUSE and HALLOWEEN H20, plus I liked the heartpumping music scoring done by Harry Manfredini in this movie too when he starts setting his sights on a bunch of immature teenagers at a farm retreat in Crystal Lake killing them off one by one right like flies on the same day they arrive too and even ends up getting 3 sleazy bikers in the process during his killing spree leaving only one survivor left(Dana Kimmell).Additionally, I like most other people back then had assumed FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III was going to be the last & final FRIDAY THE 13TH installment, since they didn't make 4th sequels back then, but it just so happened that Paramount ended up making FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART IV:THE FINAL CHAPTER 2 years later, which got released in the Spring of 1984, which by the way had started fourth sequels for every other movie, including HALLOWEEN IV, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART 4, POLICE ACADEMY IV, ROCKY 4, PSYCHO 4, etc.It's just too bad that Paramount couldn't make FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART III in 3-D and that they don't make movies in 3-D anymore either, despite the fact that 3-D was a very popular thing in the movie theatres back in the early 1980's.",5,The Sequel That Made Jason & His Hockeymask An Icon,1227484800,"11 24,

When I found out it was on DVD I was pleased and quickly purchased it. I found watching now that I'm in my twenties it is still a great horror/slasher film,it didn't give me nightmares like when I was a kid but it certainly will make you jump at scenes. This movie is about a group of teenagers that take a weekend and visit a friends cabin near Camp Crystal Lake. The main character has alreadly encountered Jason before when she ran away from home and went to the woods. I like the concept of mystery that she saw Jason but didn't know about the murders at Camp Crystal,and the fact that her friends don't realize either. Friday The 13th 3 uses the same winning formula as other classic 80's slashers,scary music(composed by Harry Manfredini) that did the original score,same atmosphere(the woods,lake,barn)and by far the best and most brutal deaths of the franchise,including a guy walking on his hands and getting split in half, and a harpoon in the eye(just to name a few).

I was in my local video store last night, saw this for sale, and immediately grabbed it up.I specifically avoided getting theFriday the 13th box setbecause they didn't offer the third movie in 3D. New Line Cinema had the right idea when they releasedThe Nightmare on Elm Street box setwith ""Freddy's Dead"" in 3D.I must admit, I was very pleased at finally seeing this not only in 3D format, but widescreen format as well. I've watched the pan & scan version more times than I could possibly count - with roughly 66% of the scene getting trimmed to fit on a standard tv screen, that's a lot of lost material. The 3D glasses have Jason's hockey mask design on them...a nice touch.Some of the better 3D sequences are as follows:- Andy & Shelly's juggling scene- The harpoon bolt scene- The ""pass the joint"" scene- Rick's ""eye pop"" sceneHere's the main issue I had with this version: unlike the newer versions of 3D films like My Bloody Valentine which were done in digital format, Friday the 13th 3D used an ""over and under"" technique which eliminated the need for dual projector set-ups, and produced widescreen, but darker, less vivid, polarized 3-D images.Basically this means that in this edition, we have images that don't jump out like newer versions do.

212053,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,6300214311,The Piper at the Gates,"[2, 4]","First off..I want to make it clear. I'm am NOT basing my review on the film itself. Personally, I love this movie, its one of my top two favorites in the whole Friday the 13th series,, so there's no way I would rate this movie this low. This review is simply based on the 3-D aspect of the film, which I must say..is pretty disappointing. First off, the generic Red & Blue 3-D glasses always give me headaches when I watch 3-D movies with them, but if the effects are good, its usually well worth it. Unfortunately, I was pretty much just left with the headache after viewing this one. The only thing that kept it interesting was the fact that the movie is great, and I just stayed focused on watching it, and for the most part, had to ignore the 3-D! In a nutshell..they're just wasn't much ""3-D"" in this 3-D movie. Most of the gimmicks just didn't work..I kept just seeing double a lot on the screen, rather than images actually standing out. They were a couple of kinda cool moments here and there (Harold putting the stick back on the clothesline, the yo yo gimmick was alright, and the pitchfork through the throat of Fox), but other than that, the 3-D was just more of an annoyance rather than a bonus. Also, I was really disappointed that there were no other special features on the DVD. I recently repurchased the Deluxe Editions of Parts 1 and 2 simply because of the special features (and a pretty cool sliding case!), but I was surprised that there wasn't any added features to this one, except the 3-D feature. This just clearly shows another attempt at the movie companies to sucker fans into buying the film yet again. And I guess its working, cause I bought it! The non 3-D version of the film is also included, so you don't need to glasses to watch the movie, and if you don't own this movie, then this is a decent buy..at least you'll have the ""deluxe"" 3-D version, but unless you're a die hard horror fan like myself, there no real reason to buy this if you already have it. Believe me, the 3-D just isn't worth it! I'm giving this 2 stars simply because of my love for this film, the fact that the non 3-D version of the film is on the disc, and the sliding case is kinda cool! But shame on Paramount for not adding anything else new to the film, and yet calling it a ""Deluxe Edition""..one special feature (and a poorly executed one, at that) doesn't make it deluxe by any means.",2,3-Disapppointed!,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,2398,"['First', 'off..I', 'want', 'make', 'clear', ""'m"", 'am', 'NOT', 'basing', 'review', 'film', 'Personally', 'love', 'movie', 'one', 'top', 'two', 'favorites', 'whole', 'Friday', '13th', 'series', 'way', 'would', 'rate', 'movie', 'low', 'review', 'simply', 'based', '3-D', 'aspect', 'film', 'must', 'say..is', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'First', 'generic', 'Red', 'Blue', '3-D', 'glasses', 'always', 'give', 'when', 'watch', '3-D', 'movies', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'usually', 'well', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'left', 'headache', 'viewing', 'one', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'interesting', 'was', 'fact', 'movie', 'great', 'just', 'stayed', 'focused', 'watching', 'most', 'part', 'had', 'ignore', '3-D', 'nutshell..they', ""'re"", 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', '3-D', '3-D', 'movie', 'Most', 'gimmicks', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work..I', 'kept', 'just', 'seeing', 'double', 'lot', 'screen', 'rather', 'images', 'actually', 'standing', 'out', 'were', 'couple', 'kinda', 'cool', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'Harold', 'putting', 'stick', 'back', 'clothesline', 'yo', 'yo', 'gimmick', 'was', 'alright', 'pitchfork', 'throat', 'Fox', 'other', '3-D', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'annoyance', 'rather', 'bonus', 'Also', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'were', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'recently', 'repurchased', 'Deluxe', 'Editions', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'simply', 'special', 'features', 'pretty', 'cool', 'sliding', 'case', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'added', 'features', 'one', '3-D', 'feature', 'just', 'clearly', 'attempt', 'movie', 'companies', 'sucker', 'fans', 'buying', 'film', 'yet', 'again', 'guess', 'working', 'cause', 'bought', 'non', '3-D', 'version', 'film', 'also', 'included', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'glasses', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'movie', 'then', 'decent', 'buy..at', 'least', ""'ll"", 'have', 'deluxe', '3-D', 'version', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'horror', 'fan', 'real', 'reason', 'buy', 'already', 'have', 'Believe', '3-D', 'just', ""n't"", 'worth', ""'m"", 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'simply', 'love', 'film', 'fact', 'non', '3-D', 'version', 'film', 'disc', 'sliding', 'case', 'kinda', 'cool', 'shame', 'Paramount', 'not', 'adding', 'anything', 'else', 'new', 'film', 'yet', 'calling', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', '..one', 'special', 'feature', 'poorly', 'executed', 'one', ""n't"", 'make', 'deluxe', 'means']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"

This doesn't stop a new group of friends from going to the lake for a good ol' weekend of sex and relation. While their, two of them, Shelly (Larry Zerner) and Chris (Dana Kimmell) leave the lake to go buy supplies, and run afoul of a local biker gang. Shelly nearly destroys the leader's (Nick Savage) bike, and they vow payback on the kids. While sabotaging their van, two of them get killed by Jason, who the kids don't know is there. With Chris and boyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka) enjoying a talk in the woods, they begin to suspect foul play when their car dies out. Shelly ends up scaring a girl he likes, Vera (Catherine Parks) who sends him away. He goes into the barn, where he thinks Chuck (David Katims) and Chili (Rachel Howard) are, but runs into Jason. Jason goes back and kills Vera, then goes into the cabin were the kids are 'sleeping' and kills two more, leaving only Chuck, Chili, Chris and Rick; no one aware of Jason's presence. Jason now launches an all-out assault on the camp, leaving only Chris and Rick, leading to a solo fight against the killer.Director Steve Miner returns to the helm for his second sequel in a row, both does not pull through as he did with ""Part 2""; his inability to build up any good scares or shocks as well as the fact that he takes too long to get the movie going. His direction hasn't improved much at all and he's certainly not helping himself by not trying anything new or different in this film. There are a few memorable death scenes, particularly one guy who gets slashed in half when he's walking around on his hands, but these moments aren't built up to particularly well, there's no sense of dread and almost no suspense; what little of it is there is mainly because of Harry Manfredini's very effective and creepy Ennio Morricone-esque score.  The gore effects are in more abundance than in the previous two films, but they still look rather cheesy sometimes.  The film is actually saved by a very riveting, exciting finale, in which all the cliches are used, such as the car that (in)conveniently runs out of gas, the dead body in the closet, the killer who's really not dead, etc., but Steve Miner actually handles the entire sequence quite well.  Overall, a sequel with much to be desired; however, at least it created a Halloween icon with its first usage of the famed hockey mask.

I never understood the hold-up in transferring it to DVD with the 3-D effects in the film, wasn't it just a simple film transfer? Turns out it was much more than that. Anway, here we are!!--The 3-D Aspect--There are many people complaining about the 3-D aspects of the movie. Personally I didn't have much problem with them at all. Being that they were the old fashioned red-blue kind (and I didn't have to spend extra for a special pair of glasses or some kind of unique device to watch it on), it DOES take some time to adjust your eyes. But once you do it's really amazing! Its what I remember 3-D to be like. I haven't seen anything recently in 3-D (be it Imax or some other theatrical form), so I'm not sure what people were expecting with this release. It is what it is. It's probably not the best thing out there, but people asked for it and now we got it. Considering the wait, I'm very pleased with the results.--The Movie--This is my favorite Jason movie out there! It's the one where he gets his mask, and seeing him march out on set with it on really fills you with that feeling of ""here we go!"" and then things really start to happen. The characters are what you expect from a Friday movie, similar to those in the other 3 movies. We have the camp, a lake, JasonThe kills are probably the best & most creative in the series, especially with the added 3-D effects. I love Richard Brooker's take on how he plays Jason, which is similar to the one we're all used to. To me, he defined how Jason moves (a concept redefined by Kane Hodder) and isn't just a zombie stumbling around with a knife. Jason is precise, he knows what he wants, he does what he wants, and no one can stop him.--Side Notes---This movie takes place immediately after the events ofPart 2, yet his look is completely different. Guess we just have to believe it's the same character.-The character of Shelly (the prankster where Jason gets his mask) could be compared to an early version of Jason. Jason was an outcast, made fun of by other members of his camp. And Shelly takes on that role in this movie; though no one really picks on him, he is rejected by the other members for his antics of trying to get people to like him. It seems fitting, then, that Jason takes his mask and fools another into thinking he is really Shelly.Bottom line this is a great movie and one I've been wanting to review for a while. I can only say that you'll be taking your chances with the 3-D aspect(it worked fine for me); there are no other extra features. Not a bid deal. Just seeing it for the first time in 3-D is good enough.",5,My Favorite Friday Ever!

212058,AUY5FSOVQMD3H,6300214311,"Tim Hill (""B.C."")","[1, 1]","This review refers to the Paramount DVD edition of the film.THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka, Tracie Savage, Jeffrey Rogers, Catherine Parks, Larry Zerner, David Katims, Rachel Howard, Richard Brooker, Steve Miner. Score Composed By Harry Manfredini. Title Theme Co-Written By Michael Zager. Directed By Steve Miner. (R) For Violence, Gore, Profanity, Drug Use, Very Brief Nudity and Mild Sexual Content; 95m.; 1982.WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Well, there may not be any camp counselors in this one, but there are definitely enough victims for the misshapen maniac Jason Voorhees to slice and dice his way through. Picking up mere moments (screen time) after its predecessor left off, we find a group of vacationing friends traveling to a small house located in the general vicinity of Crystal Lake. Instead of the carefree recreation they were searching for, they find a gruesome killer stalking them at every turn. After his success with part two of this franchise, director Steve Miner returned for another unnerving outlet of terror. Unfortunately he's now working with standard material that, while suspenseful and still intriguing, has lost its ability to downright shock the audience. The players in this film have reverted back to the original ""Friday the 13th"" by being offered generic representations of youth culture. Even bikers Ali (Nick Savage), Loco (Kevin O'Brien) and Fox (Gloria Charles) are garden variety examples of their brethren. However, the actors involved rise above the material and turn in remarkable performances nonetheless. Of particular interest is leading lady Dana Kimmell as Chris and the humorous flunky Larry Zerner as Shelly, a wannabe actor and lover of practical jokes who inadvertently provides Jason with his trademark hockey mask. Other cast members include Tracie Savage as the pregnant Debbie, Jeffrey Rogers as Debbie's quasi-macho boyfriend Andy, Catherine Parks as Shelly's blind date Vera and Paul Kratka as reliable country bumpkin Rick. Rounding out the ensemble is David Katims and Rachel Howard as the stoner couple Chuck and Chili. ""Crazy"" Ralph's prophet of doom position has been replaced by the fabulous Abel (David Wiley in an all too brief segue). True ""Friday"" fans relish this film for the presence of Richard Brooker as Jason Voorhees, the incontrovertible king of the role. Years later, Kane Hodder would go on to play Jason more often and to much critical acclaim. But all of the little traits and quirks he brought to the role were carbon copy rip-offs of what Brooker had already accomplished. Trivia buffs take note: the man who co-wrote the film's opening theme is disco legend Michael Zager whose band performed the hit song ""Let's All Chant"" in the late seventies. Also, director Steve Miner briefly appears as a television newscaster. Overall, this film is a solid entry into the ""Friday the 13th"" film canon. It recognizes the classic heights reached by its predecessors and doesn't assume it will automatically reach those same levels. Miner and his cast work hard to make this a memorable movie without relying on name power alone.THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: This film comes with a 2.35:1 widescreen transfer that, not surprisingly, looks like it was converted from an old VHS copy of the film. The presentation has a certain fuzziness to its quality and has regular intervals of grain making it the worst of the original three transfers. However, in a startling one-eighty, the accompanying 2.0 mono track is the clearest, most precise audio track to be included on a ""Friday"" film. The separation is very good and each sound is uniquely perceptible. There's a great tonality to the lower registers as well. A French mono track is also available for the film. English subtitles for this disc have a wonderful yellow coloring and have been placed within the frame of the movie. The cover for this DVD is a veridical reproduction of the original video release cover. The back cover is a bland excuse for a montage of film photos and information. The one sheet insert that comes with this film features better stills than the back cover and also spotlights the fourteen chapter stops for this ninety-five minute movie. The DVD itself is a silver top affair and features the same painting scheme (film title, Paramount logo, etc.) utilized on the discs for parts one and two. Continuing the tradition for the ""Friday"" films, the only extra available on this disc is the original theatrical trailer (2:13). The trailer is a sad reminder that this film was originally presented in the 3-D format, although Paramount foolishly (for whatever reason) did not return the film to its full third dimensional glory for this DVD release.THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Paramount has never been known for plying their releases with additional footage, let alone hiding anything on the disc. You're more likely to make friends with Jason Voorhees than you are of finding hidden easter eggs on this one.THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Debbie (Tracie Savage) appears in a blue bikini while sunbathing. We then have the pleasure of watching her take a shower. While the viewer doesn't see too much, what we are allowed to see of her is lovely. Regrettably the ravishing Latin vixen Vera (Catherine Parks) isn't given the opportunity to express any true sexuality.THE GORE REPORT: One of the girls is speared through the eye but there's not really that much blood. Another cast member has his head squeezed until his left eyeball pops out of its socket. Another luckless character loses a hand and one guy has a very realistic gash across his throat that should give cinematic bloodhounds a thrill. Even Jason gets in on the action by receiving a very bloody ax wound to the head. But the best scene of gore in this third film is when we see one of the young men split in half with his bloody intestines hanging out.SAY AGAIN: ""Why do you always have to be such an a**hole?"" - Andy (Jeffrey Rogers). ""I beg your pardon. I'm not an a**hole. I'm an actor."" - Shelly (Larry Zerner). ""Same thing."" - Andy (Jeffrey Rogers).THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. Even though Paramount has not reinstated the 3-D format for the film, it's still a worthy successor to the original two ""Friday the 13th"" features. It's more suspenseful than most of the remaining sequels and has a handful of scenes that will stick in the viewer's mind long after they've finished watching the film.PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: ""Friday the

212060,A96JD9312DHWC,6300214311,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[16, 21]","After the ending of Part 2 left the handsomely rugged (well, one out of two isn't bad) Vorhees with a machete in the back of his neck, it seemed that the worst was over. Camp Crystal Lake, an area stretching just over four square miles, had been the sight of eight grotesque murders, with the media speculating over rumors of mutilations and cannibalism that had followed in suite. Still, and ending had been achieved. As is the case with many a primal killing machine, however, one blow is often not enough to do the deed - especially if that blow is to the lower neck on the back of the aggressor - and Jason was left with the ability to breath, thereby allowing him to heal and start again. Enter a van loaded with seven occupants on their way to a secluded home just outside of Crystal Lake, lead by a former introductee to Mr. Vorhees scarred by the run-in and who wants to confront and vanquish those demons. Well, her friends are there for her like good friends should be, and they opt to journey into the seclued home where the deed took place to have fun/ be there for her. On the way there they are confronted by an elderly gentlemen that tells them, amidst his insane rambling, that they are all in peril and to flee, but this is a time for fun and sun so they ignore this herald and continue on with their troubled colleague. Yes, her friends are there for her, until the would-be fun turns into a nightmare and then the dying times begin.While showing some signs of aging in the world of more modern effectual bliss, the movie still has some strong points in the ways of slasher flicks and is the portion of the Friday the 13th legacy that introduced a icon into the fold. That's because it was here, amidst the suffering introduced to many a victim, that the persona of Jason was adopted and his mask was found. Still, that's only one of the points I liked about the movie. Personally, I enjoy the drawn out stalking that takes place as Jason plays cat-and-mouse in those early days, letting the audience familiarize themselves with his potential victims before the killing begins. This lets personalities develop amongst the troops, showcasing two chronically abusive merrymen as they seek out high after high, a local countryboy, the damaged damsel, the two lovers that are expecting, the jerk/prankster, and the somewhat stuck-up blind date as they wander toward that machete-toting brick wall. Combine this with the fact that there are plenty of other disposable portions of suffering to pad the scenes, letting the mind do a little shopping and follow a few bikers into the realms of attitude correction, and you have yourself a funderland of experiences.If you've seen other Friday the 13ths and you are looking for some of the more serious slasher times, then this is one of introduction points. The effects aren't the best here and the storyline does have its holes, but the characters tend to find ways to overcome that and the ending chase and the damage that ensues in the end more than make up for it. Its like a fun-loving romp, with scissors!",5,"Sir, Will That Be Paper Or Plastic To Go With Your Head?",1044662400,"02 8, 2003",2003,3070,"['ending', 'Part', '2', 'left', 'handsomely', 'rugged', 'well', 'one', 'out', 'two', ""n't"", 'bad', 'machete', 'back', 'neck', 'seemed', 'worst', 'was', 'over', 'Camp', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'area', 'stretching', 'just', 'four', 'square', 'miles', 'had', 'been', 'sight', 'eight', 'grotesque', 'murders', 'media', 'speculating', 'rumors', 'mutilations', 'cannibalism', 'had', 'followed', 'suite', 'Still', 'ending', 'had', 'been', 'achieved', 'case', 'many', 'primal', 'killing', 'machine', 'however', 'one', 'blow', 'often', 'not', 'enough', 'do', 'deed', 'especially', 'blow', 'lower', 'neck', 'back', 'aggressor', 'Jason', 'was', 'left', 'ability', 'breath', 'thereby', 'allowing', 'heal', 'start', 'again', 'Enter', 'van', 'loaded', 'seven', 'occupants', 'way', 'secluded', 'home', 'just', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'lead', 'former', 'introductee', 'Mr.', 'Vorhees', 'scarred', 'run-in', 'who', 'confront', 'vanquish', 'demons', 'Well', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'like', 'good', 'friends', 'should', 'be', 'opt', 'journey', 'seclued', 'home', 'where', 'deed', 'took', 'place', 'have', 'fun/', 'be', 'there', 'way', 'are', 'confronted', 'elderly', 'gentlemen', 'amidst', 'insane', 'rambling', 'are', 'peril', 'flee', 'time', 'fun', 'sun', 'so', 'ignore', 'herald', 'continue', 'troubled', 'colleague', 'Yes', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'would-be', 'fun', 'nightmare', 'then', 'dying', 'times', 'showing', 'signs', 'aging', 'world', 'more', 'modern', 'effectual', 'bliss', 'movie', 'still', 'strong', 'points', 'ways', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'portion', 'Friday', '13th', 'legacy', 'introduced', 'icon', 'fold', 'was', 'here', 'suffering', 'introduced', 'many', 'victim', 'persona', 'Jason', 'was', 'adopted', 'mask', 'was', 'found', 'Still', 'only', 'one', 'points', 'liked', 'movie', 'Personally', 'enjoy', 'drawn', 'out', 'stalking', 'place', 'Jason', 'cat-and-mouse', 'early', 'days', 'letting', 'audience', 'familiarize', 'potential', 'victims', 'killing', 'personalities', 'develop', 'troops', 'showcasing', 'two', 'chronically', 'abusive', 'merrymen', 'seek', 'out', 'high', 'high', 'local', 'countryboy', 'damaged', 'damsel', 'two', 'lovers', 'are', 'expecting', 'jerk/prankster', 'somewhat', 'stuck-up', 'blind', 'date', 'wander', 'machete-toting', 'brick', 'wall', 'Combine', 'fact', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'disposable', 'portions', 'suffering', 'pad', 'scenes', 'letting', 'mind', 'do', 'little', 'shopping', 'follow', 'few', 'bikers', 'realms', 'attitude', 'correction', 'have', 'funderland', 'experiences.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Friday', '13ths', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'serious', 'slasher', 'times', 'then', 'one', 'introduction', 'points', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'best', 'here', 'storyline', 'have', 'holes', 'characters', 'tend', 'find', 'ways', 'overcome', 'ending', 'chase', 'damage', 'end', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'fun-loving', 'romp', 'scissors']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"
212061,AI0PLL5DQAHRG,6300214311,"Ty Arthur ""xFiruath""","[1, 3]","Anyone who has viewed the first two installments in the Friday the 13th series can skip part 3, as they have already seen it.  The director from Part 2 returns to offer audiences every where an exact duplicate copy of his original attempt at a Jason movie.  The movie starts with an exceedingly long flashback of the ending to Part 2 (not re-enacted mind you, just lifted directly from that movie), moves on to the youthful cannon fodder heading into the woods where they are yet again warned by a crazy old man to avoid the death that obviously awaits them, they are stalked and murdered one by one without being granted the opportunity to warn their friends that a killer is amongst them, and finally a grand chase scene occurs with the lone survivor.  Ad Naseum seven more times, and you have the Friday the 13th series.  Part 3 was originally filmed in 3-D, which is pretty obvious to everyone who isn't wearing 3D glasses, as they will have yo-yos, baseball bats, eyeballs, shovels, and an odd assortment of other items thrust directly into the camera, which was probably just as silly when viewed as originally intended.The paradox of Jason is taken to whole new level in this chapter of the series.  Many viewers have asserted that Jason is not actually a psychopath or even an intentional murderer, but actually an unbending force of nature such as a hurricane.  Others take the view that he became insane while living alone in the woods for years, and he doesn't understand the difference between life and death.  These arguments might have held some merit if Part 3 had never been added into the sequence.  Whether  intentional, or simply a product of the various directors' and screenwriters ineptitude at movie production, it is quite clear that Jason has magical powers of some kind, and is highly intelligent.  Despite appearing to be a lumbering hulk of a man with a mild form of mental retardation, Jason is able to stealthily sneak his way through forests, homes, and shops without ever being noticed.  He can hide under a hammock without being seen, walk directly by someone and stand behind them with being noticed until the person turns around, blend into the forest like a chameleon, lie in wait for hours on end until someone enters a basement or finally goes off into the forest alone, and breathe underwater for indefinite periods of time.  Since it's assumed that at least some of the people in the world lock their doors, he is also an expert at picking locks (unless people have seen him, in which case his magical lock picking ability is nullified and he MUST break down doors and windows with his hands or a machete).  Jason can also make recently deceased bodies, and all the forms of blood and gore associated with these bodies, disappear without a trace, so no one would ever be able to tell that another individual was recently hacked apart with a machete in the room.  He also displays keen intelligence and a desire for revenge in this movie, as he takes the time to remove his mask and reveal his face to someone who had previously escaped his clutches, for the sole purpose of letting this person know that escaping him is not a possibility.Continuity is a serious problem here.  Towards the beginning of the movie several characters are discussing a time in the past when the heroine Chris was chased by a bogeyman of some sort in the woods.  Initially this incident is placed at five years before the present.  A few minutes later when the subject is brought up again, it suddenly has changed to two years in the past.  Later, when the subject comes up again, it is referred to as occurring ""last summer"".  People will randomly have different clothes or accessories on in the same scene when the camera cuts away from them, characters repeat actions twice in a row for no apparent reason, and camera/crew equipment is frequently visible.  Astoundingly, the acting is even worse than in the second movie, which is a feat that really shouldn't have been possible.Although there are a few fun frights and some decent gore, overall Friday the 13th Part 3 is a movie that didn't need to be made, and everyone except Jason fanatics can safely skip it without missing out on anything.",2,Entirely Unnecessary,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,4216,"['Anyone', 'who', 'viewed', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'Friday', '13th', 'series', 'can', 'skip', 'part', '3', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'director', 'Part', '2', 'returns', 'offer', 'audiences', 'where', 'exact', 'duplicate', 'copy', 'original', 'attempt', 'Jason', 'movie', 'movie', 'exceedingly', 'long', 'flashback', 'ending', 'Part', '2', 'not', 're-enacted', 'mind', 'just', 'lifted', 'directly', 'movie', 'moves', 'youthful', 'cannon', 'fodder', 'heading', 'woods', 'where', 'are', 'yet', 'again', 'warned', 'crazy', 'old', 'man', 'avoid', 'death', 'obviously', 'are', 'stalked', 'murdered', 'one', 'one', 'being', 'granted', 'opportunity', 'warn', 'friends', 'killer', 'amongst', 'finally', 'grand', 'chase', 'scene', 'lone', 'survivor', 'Ad', 'Naseum', 'seven', 'more', 'times', 'have', 'Friday', '13th', 'series', 'Part', '3', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', '3-D', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'wearing', '3D', 'glasses', 'will', 'have', 'yo-yos', 'baseball', 'bats', 'eyeballs', 'shovels', 'odd', 'assortment', 'other', 'items', 'thrust', 'directly', 'camera', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'silly', 'when', 'viewed', 'originally', 'intended.The', 'paradox', 'Jason', 'taken', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'chapter', 'series', 'Many', 'viewers', 'have', 'asserted', 'Jason', 'not', 'actually', 'psychopath', 'even', 'intentional', 'murderer', 'actually', 'unbending', 'force', 'nature', 'such', 'hurricane', 'Others', 'take', 'view', 'became', 'insane', 'living', 'alone', 'woods', 'years', ""n't"", 'understand', 'difference', 'life', 'death', 'arguments', 'might', 'have', 'held', 'merit', 'Part', '3', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'added', 'sequence', 'Whether', 'intentional', 'simply', 'product', 'various', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'ineptitude', 'movie', 'production', 'quite', 'clear', 'Jason', 'magical', 'powers', 'kind', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'appearing', 'be', 'lumbering', 'hulk', 'man', 'mild', 'form', 'mental', 'retardation', 'Jason', 'able', 'stealthily', 'sneak', 'way', 'forests', 'homes', 'shops', 'ever', 'being', 'noticed', 'can', 'hide', 'hammock', 'being', 'seen', 'walk', 'directly', 'someone', 'stand', 'being', 'noticed', 'person', 'around', 'blend', 'forest', 'chameleon', 'lie', 'wait', 'hours', 'end', 'someone', 'enters', 'basement', 'finally', 'off', 'forest', 'alone', 'breathe', 'underwater', 'indefinite', 'periods', 'time', 'assumed', 'least', 'people', 'world', 'lock', 'doors', 'also', 'expert', 'picking', 'locks', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'case', 'magical', 'lock', 'picking', 'ability', 'nullified', 'MUST', 'break', 'down', 'doors', 'windows', 'hands', 'machete', 'Jason', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'recently', 'deceased', 'bodies', 'forms', 'blood', 'gore', 'associated', 'bodies', 'disappear', 'trace', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'individual', 'was', 'recently', 'hacked', 'apart', 'machete', 'room', 'also', 'keen', 'intelligence', 'desire', 'revenge', 'movie', 'time', 'remove', 'mask', 'reveal', 'face', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'escaped', 'clutches', 'sole', 'purpose', 'letting', 'person', 'know', 'escaping', 'not', 'possibility.Continuity', 'serious', 'problem', 'here', 'beginning', 'movie', 'several', 'characters', 'are', 'discussing', 'time', 'past', 'when', 'heroine', 'Chris', 'was', 'chased', 'bogeyman', 'sort', 'woods', 'Initially', 'incident', 'placed', 'five', 'years', 'present', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'when', 'subject', 'brought', 'up', 'again', 'suddenly', 'changed', 'two', 'years', 'past', 'Later', 'when', 'subject', 'up', 'again', 'referred', 'occurring', 'last', 'summer', 'People', 'will', 'randomly', 'have', 'different', 'clothes', 'accessories', 'same', 'scene', 'when', 'camera', 'away', 'characters', 'repeat', 'actions', 'twice', 'row', 'apparent', 'reason', 'camera/crew', 'equipment', 'frequently', 'visible', 'Astoundingly', 'acting', 'even', 'worse', 'second', 'movie', 'feat', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'are', 'few', 'fun', 'frights', 'decent', 'gore', 'overall', 'Friday', '13th', 'Part', '3', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'made', 'everyone', 'Jason', 'fanatics', 'can', 'safely', 'skip', 'missing', 'out', 'anything']","Friday the 13th, Part 3 VHS"
212062,A3LQ6XMR25MRJ9,6300214311,"Vlad Cuellar ""vlad""","[6, 7]","THe Final CHapter is my favorite Friday but Part 3 is great in its own way. THis film picks off where Part 2 left off. Jason has just finished off a bunch of kids at Crystal Lake and now he's laying low in a barn owned by a redneck and his hag wife. Jason kills them and then moves to another barn where a bunch of kids have decided to spend their weekend. This group is probably the best of the Friday gangs. There are some memorable characters here, the best one is Shelly a fat white guy with an Afro! He claims to be an actor and he carries a little suitcase with his acting makeup in it, and he's always playing tricks on the others. The group also includes two nymphos and two potheads. Plus the heroine of the film Chris(yummy Dana Kimmell) and her hard-luck boyfriend Rick. This film was originally shown in theatres in 3-D but that effect is missing on the video and DVD. Still the movie is a terrific entry into the Friday series. Part 3 has great atmosphere, you really feel like you're out in the country. You also feel how menacing it gets at night out in the woods! THe kills here are really good and original. The 3-D effect was really important for two kills. When Jason kills Vera with the speargun to the eye, in 3-D you really see the spear coming at you! Also when Jason crushes Rick's head with his hands you actually see Rick's eye come out of the screen right into your face! Too bad you can't duplicate that effect on DVD or video. But the movie is good regardless. The acting is ok but the guy who plays Jason is really good. This Jason is probably one of the scariest. His makeup is grotesque, and he's huge, bald, with a nasty attitude!

212066,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,6300214311,William,"[4, 5]","Friday the 13th Part 3 is the best of the first 3, in my opinion. This is not because of the 3D effects, it is that there are more enjoyable characters and more murders to watch. I was lucky enough to see this in 3D at the cinemas back in 1983, and these effects added value to an already good sequel.There are many reviews here stating how bad the 3D is which has been presented on the new deluxe DVD. In a nutshell, it is. There are odd moments of acceptability, but essentially it is dismal. This could be because the 3D technology used way back in 1982 does not work well on today's viewing monitors. I watched it on a 40"" LCD TV, maybe LCD is what stuffs it up. The red/blue glasses don't help the experience either. They make your eyes feel weird and you can suffer headaches as a result. However, these type of glasses are necessary to view 3D films of that era. Simply put, you can't use modern 3D glasses (i.e. black lenses) to watch old time 3D movies.As others have pointed out, when objects come out of the screen in Friday the 13th Part 3, as part of the 3D effect, it just looks terrible. It blurs and the effect is lost. It may be worth trying to watch the DVD on your computer or a smaller screen to see if it resolves it. Also, the red/blue glasses give the overall picture a tint which makes the film unrealistic.I'm not sure if you can blame Paramount for any of the issues with this 3D movie being transferred to DVD.  As I said, there are the odd few scenes where the 3D effect works well, but overall it is no fun to watch. I understand Paramount have been hassled for years to release the 3D version on DVD but declined - possibly for all the problems I have listed above. That is probably why the original DVD of this movie came with the 2D version.So is it worth buying this DVD? Well, the disc does come with the 2D version which is nicely cleaned up. BUT, the remixed 5.1 sound is nothing to rave about, and most of the noise still comes out of the one speaker (like the original DVD). There are no special features except for a trailer and two sets of 3D glasses.Save your money, and stick with your original DVD.
