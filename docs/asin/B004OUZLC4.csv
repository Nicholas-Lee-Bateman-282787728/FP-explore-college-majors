1423134,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004OUZLC4,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Daydream Nation is a fairly interesting film with only a few questionable moments.  It's about Kat Dennings playing the character of a mature, witty, slightly sarcastic and introverted high school student who happens to find herself rocking the cradle with her teacher after several flirtatious suggestions as well as having more of a forced and unwelcomed relationship with a student by the name of Thurston.  Nevermind the awkwardness that a teacher is having sex with a student who may or may not be over 18.  I don't think that point was ever addressed- it was just assumed Kat's character was old enough.  Also the way Kat and her teacher finally hit it off felt strange since the build up before it occurred was about as unnatural as you can possibly imagine.  Kat was WAY too confident and comfortable around her teacher and I never understood why.  Unless she was so desperate for attention in a small town and had nothing better to do.The problem with Thurston is that despite his best efforts to win over the love of his life, there's always a series of struggles that prevent the relationship from properly and completely getting off the ground (such as a couple awkward situations where Thurston approaches Kat's father at the front door and doesn't know how to introduce himself without stuttering and getting confused).  This scene is hilarious for the way he tries to strike up a conversation by way of handing the father some cupcakes and yet the father *still* wants nothing to do with him, and surely doesn't want his daughter dating such a gibberish spounting weirdo, lol.We eventually realize that the teacher has issues of his own.  He plays the role of a guy in his mid 30's looking for a relationship and at first he seems like a regular likeable teacher but after going at it with Kat Dennings, he's develops mental issues that we discover later on.  Actually these issues just happen suddenly and surprisingly after a bizarre phone call.One disappointing aspect is the conclusion.  Without spoiling what happens (and you'd probably never guess anyway because it's a million to one odds *that* would occur) there's a killer on the loose somewhere in town.  One of his victims is a cheerleader.  However what's unusual is that this part of the story almost NEVER comes up other than a couple scenes, so its inclusion feels like there should have been more to it than there is.  That's why the ending is so surprising, along with another reason.Overall, Kat Dennings (who I just found out was born in Philadelphia, my home town.  Go Kat!) saves the movie with her intelligent and mature ways of communication with everyone.  No this is definitely not your typical school/relationship type movie.  The plot is deeper than the usual things you associate with such an environment such as partying, loud music, driving and sexual encounters.  This movie takes these common overused themes and builds on them in a more interesting and thought provoking way compared to other films that might fall under this category.",4,different kind of drama,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,3034,"['Daydream', 'Nation', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'film', 'only', 'few', 'questionable', 'moments', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'playing', 'character', 'mature', 'witty', 'slightly', 'sarcastic', 'introverted', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'find', 'rocking', 'cradle', 'teacher', 'several', 'flirtatious', 'suggestions', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'more', 'forced', 'unwelcomed', 'relationship', 'student', 'name', 'Thurston', 'Nevermind', 'awkwardness', 'teacher', 'having', 'sex', 'student', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', '18', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'point', 'was', 'ever', 'addressed-', 'was', 'just', 'assumed', 'Kat', 'character', 'was', 'old', 'enough', 'Also', 'way', 'Kat', 'teacher', 'finally', 'hit', 'off', 'felt', 'strange', 'build', 'up', 'occurred', 'was', 'about', 'as', 'unnatural', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'Kat', 'was', 'WAY', 'too', 'confident', 'comfortable', 'teacher', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'desperate', 'attention', 'small', 'town', 'had', 'nothing', 'better', 'do.The', 'problem', 'Thurston', 'best', 'efforts', 'win', 'love', 'life', 'always', 'series', 'struggles', 'prevent', 'relationship', 'properly', 'completely', 'getting', 'off', 'ground', 'such', 'couple', 'awkward', 'situations', 'where', 'Thurston', 'Kat', 'father', 'front', 'door', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'introduce', 'stuttering', 'getting', 'confused', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'way', 'strike', 'up', 'conversation', 'way', 'handing', 'father', 'cupcakes', 'yet', 'father', '*still*', 'nothing', 'do', 'surely', ""n't"", 'want', 'daughter', 'dating', 'such', 'gibberish', 'spounting', 'weirdo', 'lol.We', 'eventually', 'realize', 'teacher', 'issues', 'own', 'role', 'guy', 'mid', '30', 'looking', 'relationship', 'first', 'regular', 'likeable', 'teacher', 'going', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'develops', 'mental', 'issues', 'discover', 'later', 'Actually', 'issues', 'just', 'happen', 'suddenly', 'surprisingly', 'bizarre', 'phone', 'call.One', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'conclusion', 'spoiling', 'what', ""'d"", 'probably', 'never', 'guess', 'anyway', 'million', 'one', 'odds', '*that*', 'would', 'occur', 'killer', 'loose', 'somewhere', 'town', 'One', 'victims', 'cheerleader', 'However', 'what', 'unusual', 'part', 'story', 'almost', 'NEVER', 'up', 'other', 'couple', 'scenes', 'inclusion', 'feels', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'why', 'ending', 'so', 'surprising', 'reason.Overall', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'who', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'born', 'Philadelphia', 'home', 'town', 'Go', 'Kat', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'mature', 'ways', 'communication', 'everyone', 'No', 'definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'school/relationship', 'type', 'movie', 'plot', 'deeper', 'usual', 'things', 'associate', 'environment', 'such', 'partying', 'loud', 'music', 'driving', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'movie', 'common', 'overused', 'themes', 'builds', 'more', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'way', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'might', 'fall', 'category']",N/A
1423135,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004OUZLC4,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","This indy film takes a look at a small town, its inhabitants and how they/we float through life not facing the reality of things.Here's the scoop. Caroline (Kat Dennings) is from the big city. She's bright, savvy and is having a difficult time adjusting to this town where an industrial fire raging just off its borders, the kids imbibe copious amounts of and there is a serial killer on the loose. So what does she do? She puts the moves on her English teacher and dates a nice, local schoolmate to cover her tracks. Said teacher dates the school's female Phys Ed teacher to cover his. Things don't go very well.This has a lot of cool things happening. Lights, sparklers and fireworks are nearly ubiquitous. They appear, in one form or another, in many scenes. Then there's the ominous plume of smoke, off in the distance, issuing from the burning factory. It lends a sense of dread to the proceedings. I also like how certain scenes are repeated using different characters. I thought it was a nice touch. How about the characterrs. Thurston (Reece Thompson) is a good hearted, smart enough guy who gets too high too often. He likes Caroline. She IS witty and her sharp tongue might be the slap he needs to wake him up from the mind-numbing existence of small time life. How about Barry Anderson (Josh Lucas) the English teacher. What a knucklehead. He has to know, in the back of his mind, that sleeping with a student can only end badly. Then to think she's the love of his life?!  Grow up!Like all good indy flicks this is all writing and acting. The cast is more than decent and it's peppered with some really nifty tunes as well. It's directed and shot professionally. I didn't see the bones showing. So, if you're prone toward this sort of thing this is a good outing.",4,At Some Level We're All Kidding Ourselves,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1775,"['indy', 'film', 'look', 'small', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'how', 'they/we', 'float', 'life', 'not', 'facing', 'reality', 'things.Here', 'scoop', 'Caroline', 'Kat', 'Dennings', 'big', 'city', 'bright', 'savvy', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'adjusting', 'town', 'where', 'industrial', 'fire', 'raging', 'just', 'borders', 'kids', 'imbibe', 'copious', 'amounts', 'serial', 'killer', 'loose', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'moves', 'English', 'teacher', 'nice', 'local', 'schoolmate', 'cover', 'tracks', 'Said', 'teacher', 'school', 'female', 'Phys', 'Ed', 'teacher', 'cover', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'very', 'well.This', 'lot', 'cool', 'things', 'happening', 'Lights', 'sparklers', 'fireworks', 'are', 'nearly', 'ubiquitous', 'appear', 'one', 'form', 'many', 'scenes', 'Then', 'ominous', 'plume', 'smoke', 'off', 'distance', 'issuing', 'burning', 'factory', 'sense', 'dread', 'proceedings', 'also', 'how', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'repeated', 'using', 'different', 'characters', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'How', 'characterrs', 'Thurston', 'Reece', 'Thompson', 'good', 'hearted', 'smart', 'enough', 'guy', 'who', 'too', 'high', 'too', 'often', 'Caroline', 'witty', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'might', 'be', 'slap', 'wake', 'up', 'mind-numbing', 'existence', 'small', 'time', 'life', 'How', 'Barry', 'Anderson', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'English', 'teacher', 'What', 'knucklehead', 'know', 'back', 'mind', 'sleeping', 'student', 'can', 'only', 'end', 'badly', 'Then', 'think', 'love', 'life', 'Grow', 'up', 'good', 'indy', 'flicks', 'writing', 'acting', 'cast', 'more', 'decent', 'peppered', 'really', 'nifty', 'tunes', 'as', 'well', 'directed', 'shot', 'professionally', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'bones', 'showing', 'So', ""'re"", 'prone', 'sort', 'thing', 'good', 'outing']",N/A

1423137,AM7LW0PNRNNH6,B004OUZLC4,Lisa Carter,"[1, 2]","The movie is good, in terms of great acting with a dark, twisted and not-too fast pace.  In fact, that's what sells the whole film.  Kat Dennings is solid in her performance as an egotistical teen with a somewhat third person view of events.  She beings sleeping with her teacher, as played by Josh Lucas; all the while being pursued by the guilt ridden pre-junkie destined to become her age appropriate boytoy.  Set against the backdrop of a bitter town with a serial killer tooling around, the first half of the movie holds promise.  And falls flat.  Essentially, she begins  dating the other teen, who betrays her in the end, but we realize that she will tolerate this--and more--probably for the entirety of her life because drugs are a valid excuse and life is temporary.  Well, life is temporary, but I was left with the impression that she really is the 'foppish little moron' that her by all accounts mentally-ill teacher fictionalized in his novel.  Well acted, but predictable.  A one-time watch.

The story at times is third person, at other times Caroline narrates. She tells us of a tale of a girl in school who worked as a stripper until 2AM then showed up for school and took extra classes. The football team, she tells us, would heat up quarters and throw them at her while she walked through the halls. A &#34;serial killer&#34; (dubbed a serial killer after first body was found) kills the girl and they find marks of heated quarters on her legs.The waste dump fire and serial killer were under utilized as metaphors/symbols.After her death, it appears the overly mature Caroline is the prettiest girl in school. She seduces her teacher and a classmate. As time goes on we discover the teacher has the persona of a psychotic character portrayed from his own novel and has developed an unhealthy need to continue his relationship with Caroline.The movie makes clever use of juxtapositions to create humorous scenes. There are also slow scenes and slightly annoying first person narration. The soundtrack was fairly lame. The climax scene is supposed to be a culmination of the scenes building up upon each other. In an indie, it is not necessarily predictable, but it is at least metaphorically or symbolically part of the movie. This one was not. It was a complete let down and a lack of closure by the writer.
