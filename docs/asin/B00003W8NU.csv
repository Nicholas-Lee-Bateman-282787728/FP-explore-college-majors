The same issues with  androids, the same tops of buildings with large extractor fans turning  slowly with steam bellowing from the ground.What stops it from becoming  the usual TV series based on a film is a compelling plot and the boldness  to have nudity, violence and strong language.Picture and sound quality  are good although nothing special.

Ramer ""TheRamer""","[6, 6]","I remember watching this on late night cable when I was 19 or 20 and thinking, ""This show is AMAZING!!!"" and then one day it was gone as quietly as it had appeared. I was just recently watching Total Recall when I remembered this. So I looked it up, found Machine Dreams and bought it. I LOVE this show, and coming from me, that's a huge thing to say, because I make it my business to watch EVERY TV show and critique it. I can't even count how many GREAT shows I've come across in the past decade that disappeared after a season due to funding, time slot or marketing errors. The Adventures of Brisco County Jr., Firefly, Cleopatra 2525... and now Total Recall: 2070!This show is just the perfect combination of old school detective novels, sensual sex, science fiction and action!!! I was very dissapointed to find out that only Machine Dreams (basically the 2 hour pilot for the series) is out on DVD currently, but as have others stated, I'm going to email Showtime's (cbs's) PR department and see if I can get a response as to when, or if, they plan to release the whole season at some point. If you enjoyed this, I highly recommend you taking the same action.In all, I would definitely recommend Total Recall: 2070 ""Machine Dreams"" to anyone looking for a great way to enjoy 1 hour and 20 minutes in their evening.!!!Thanks,TheRamer",5,Where is the rest of this show?!,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,1338,"['remember', 'watching', 'late', 'night', 'cable', 'when', 'was', '19', '20', 'thinking', 'show', 'AMAZING', 'then', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'gone', 'as', 'quietly', 'had', 'appeared', 'was', 'just', 'recently', 'watching', 'Total', 'Recall', 'when', 'remembered', 'looked', 'up', 'found', 'Machine', 'Dreams', 'bought', 'LOVE', 'show', 'coming', 'huge', 'thing', 'say', 'make', 'business', 'watch', 'EVERY', 'TV', 'show', 'critique', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'GREAT', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'come', 'past', 'decade', 'disappeared', 'season', 'due', 'funding', 'time', 'slot', 'marketing', 'errors', 'Adventures', 'Brisco', 'County', 'Jr.', 'Firefly', 'Cleopatra', '2525', 'now', 'Total', 'Recall', '2070', 'show', 'just', 'perfect', 'combination', 'old', 'school', 'detective', 'novels', 'sensual', 'sex', 'science', 'fiction', 'action', 'was', 'very', 'dissapointed', 'find', 'out', 'only', 'Machine', 'Dreams', 'basically', '2', 'hour', 'pilot', 'series', 'out', 'DVD', 'currently', 'as', 'have', 'others', 'stated', ""'m"", 'going', 'email', 'Showtime', 'cbs', 'PR', 'department', 'see', 'can', 'get', 'response', 'when', 'plan', 'release', 'whole', 'season', 'point', 'enjoyed', 'highly', 'recommend', 'taking', 'same', 'action.In', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Total', 'Recall', '2070', 'Machine', 'Dreams', 'anyone', 'looking', 'great', 'way', 'enjoy', '1', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'evening.', 'Thanks', 'TheRamer']",N/A

If any more impressive source could have been cited, I assume the makers would have used that quote instead.This could be a made-for-TV effort. Instead of acting, this relies on stereotypes, like sneering bad-guy, maverick cop, and don't-make-waves boss of the maverick. Then there's that cop's partner, the one with a secret that you'll pretty much guess in the first few seconds of his appearance. In fact, when it came time to out that guy in a big dramatic scene, I had long since forgotten that his secret was secret at all.The  big bad corporation theme still works, especially after the recent implosion of the financial corporations.
