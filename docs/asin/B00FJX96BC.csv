The first scene didn't help either when she rescues a girl being harassed by some thugs in an open field surrounded by forest which just happens to have four or five 44 gallon drums hanging around with something volatile inside them.Cue explosions during fight scene.I soon got over that however when the rescued damsel takes her back to meet the rest of her motley crew who live in an abandoned post apocalyptic warehouse and various personality clashes ensue.They can't quite believe this girl with an iron suit is a cross between Clint Eastwood and Donnie Yen.Yes,she's very stoic,talks little and you don't find out her name until the end.I quite liked that about her character though because she pulls it off well and like most of those kinds of characters' actions speak louder than words.When some more of the gang come to exact their revenge dragging the original thugs with them ,they get their behinds handed to them also.This results in the whole gang coming for the final showdown some time later.By this time quite a lot of character development has been revealed and the relationships between all the characters becomes very interesting and raises the action to an emotional level rather than just having action for actions sake.There are two interesting twists at the end which made it even more enjoyable for me and made me realize that time had passed quite quickly and I didn't look at the timer on my player once.Good purchase.",4,Pretty Good,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,1608,"['Look', 'must', 'admit', 'had', 'doubts', 'because', 'face', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'when', 'doing', 'kind', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'good', 'really', 'corny', 'cheesy', 'first', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'when', 'girl', 'being', 'harassed', 'thugs', 'open', 'field', 'surrounded', 'forest', 'just', 'have', 'four', 'five', '44', 'gallon', 'drums', 'hanging', 'something', 'volatile', 'them.Cue', 'explosions', 'fight', 'scene.I', 'soon', 'got', 'however', 'when', 'rescued', 'damsel', 'back', 'meet', 'rest', 'motley', 'crew', 'who', 'live', 'abandoned', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'warehouse', 'various', 'personality', 'clashes', 'ensue.They', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'believe', 'girl', 'iron', 'suit', 'cross', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Donnie', 'Yen.Yes', 'very', 'stoic', 'talks', 'little', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'name', 'end.I', 'quite', 'liked', 'character', 'off', 'well', 'most', 'kinds', 'characters', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words.When', 'more', 'gang', 'come', 'exact', 'revenge', 'dragging', 'original', 'thugs', 'get', 'behinds', 'handed', 'also.This', 'results', 'whole', 'gang', 'coming', 'final', 'showdown', 'time', 'later.By', 'time', 'quite', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'been', 'revealed', 'relationships', 'characters', 'very', 'interesting', 'action', 'emotional', 'level', 'rather', 'just', 'having', 'action', 'actions', 'are', 'two', 'interesting', 'twists', 'end', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'made', 'realize', 'time', 'had', 'passed', 'quite', 'quickly', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'timer', 'player', 'once.Good', 'purchase']",N/A

1671720,A1JV1H24R0FNVM,B00FJX96BC,EdM,"[4, 5]","Iron Girl is a Japanese action film released in Japan in July 2012 and is now available in US. Directed by Masatoshi Nagamine and starring Asuka Kirara as Iron Girl, this film has good potential for a franchise like the Iron Man films. Set in the near future after an unknown event causes life to revert to a pre-electrical era, the heroine agrees to help a group of people trying to survive against the predatory attacks of the Crazy Dogs who are a &#34;mad max&#34; type gang. Iron Girl wears a power suit that gives her super strength, tactical speed, and high agility. The suit is powered by a disc implanted in her so it works only for her. The villain is Crazy Joe, the gang leader but he is also the Iron Saint. Both Iron Girl and Joe have no memories of how they came to be but are obviously some type of super soldier. The film is limited budget as some parts are well done and others look low budget. The film is in Japanese with English subtitles. (No dubbing option-thanks!) The making of feature is worth watching as well. A good film to see and happy with purchase. Note: The film is definitely for those that like the genre.
