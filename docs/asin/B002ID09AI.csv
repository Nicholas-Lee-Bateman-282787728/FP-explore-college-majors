No regrets.Pros: The price is excellent, the action is not 2010 quality but still very impressive and the stories are entertaining.Cons; The sound is without surround, the quality of the picture is far from perfect and the acting is not close to any oscars.I recommend them to any person that wants relaxing movies to watch after a long day at work and ready to watch anything without being too picky.",4,No regret,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,615,"['have', 'bought', 'collection', 'watch', 'bed', 'late', 'night', 'going', 'sleep', '40', 'Inch', 'Bedroom', 'TV', 'not', 'movie', 'Theatre', 'room', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lots', 'thinking', 'are', 'well', 'entertaining', 'regrets.Pros', 'price', 'excellent', 'action', 'not', '2010', 'quality', 'still', 'very', 'impressive', 'stories', 'are', 'entertaining.Cons', 'sound', 'surround', 'quality', 'picture', 'far', 'perfect', 'acting', 'not', 'close', 'oscars.I', 'recommend', 'person', 'relaxing', 'movies', 'watch', 'long', 'day', 'work', 'ready', 'watch', 'anything', 'being', 'too', 'picky']",N/A
