881726,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B0007KUH24,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","""The Whole Truth"" is the worst Twilight Zone episode that I have ever seen; it is fundamentally a lame example of political propaganda. Harvey Hunnicut is a used-car dealer with a specialty in passing off clunkers as valued transportation devices. He is a slick talker, overwhelming his customers with praise for his junk, confusing them with endless and rapid rhetoric. All of this changes when he buys a very old car from an old man, who tells him in a parting statement that the car is haunted.From the time of the sale, Hunnicut now cannot keep himself from always uttering the truth, openly telling potential customers the structural flaws in his wares. Given that he sells only junk, his business collapses. Finally, a man speaking with a foreign accent offers to buy the vehicle for his boss. The episode ends with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev the new owner of the haunted car.The dialog is terrible, lighting is odd, making the scenes appear crude and the political message is so incongruous and poorly executed that I was just glad when the episode ended.""Death Ship"" is another very weak episode; Spaceship E-89 from Earth is searching for new planets to colonize. As the ship orbits the 13th planet of system 51, Lieutenant Mason (Ross Martin) spots what appears to be a reflection from refined metal. Since the planet otherwise appears to have no intelligent life, this is an enormous contradiction. Captain Ross (Jack Klugman) orders the ship landed nearby and when the men look out the porthole, they see what appears to be their crashed ship. Lieutenant Carter (Frederick Beir) is the third member of the crew and together they explore the crashed ship and to their shock, inside they find what appear to be their bodies.This starts a meltdown of Carter, as he starts exhibiting emotional instability. Mason holds it together more than Carter, but he too starts to unwind. Such actions are examples of what I consider one of the worst traits of some television science fiction, when the astronauts rapidly exhibit emotional or psychological instability. To ever make it into space, one would have to be heavily screened and repeatedly demonstrate the highest level of discipline. In my opinion, that is one reason why Star Trek was so successful, Captain Kirk and the command crew of the Enterprise never panicked or wavered, even when it appeared that their destruction was imminent.Captain Ross maintains his personal discipline, constantly searching for a rational explanation for an irrational situation. He concludes that there are creatures on the planet that are manipulating their minds, although he is wrong and they all eventually reach the conclusion that they somehow died in a crash that none of them have any memory of.The idea of being helped to cope with your death by deceased loved ones immediately after you die is a compelling one, but in this case it is oddly presented. In this scenario, the premise is that your memory is blacked out starting right before your death until immediately afterward and it is up to you to reach the conclusion that you have died. The relatives encountered act as if they also know nothing of their deaths as well, it is as if the subsequent deceased are required to inform the previously deceased of their demise.An essentially immortal creature that gains eternal life by sucking the life force from youth is an old story that is retold in ""Queen of the Nile."" Jordan Herrick is a journalist covering the society beat and he is astonished when he meets longtime starlet Pamela Morris. Even though she has been making movies for years, Morris appears not to have aged at all. After a date, a warning from Morris' ""mother"" and further research, Herrick concludes that there is something inaccurate about Morris' stated age. He has learned that she was playing in a theater that was torn down decades before.Even though he is warned, Herrick's curiosity is overpowering and he returns to question Morris about the inconsistencies in her story. That proves to be his undoing, as Morris is far, far older and more resourceful than he could have imagined.My favorite performance in this episode is by Celia Lovsky as Morris' ""mother."" From it, you can see why she was cast as the dour T' Pau in the original Star Trek episode ""Amok Time."" While this episode is good, it is also somewhat predictable in sequence; it was clear very early what kind of creature Morris was.",2,"""The Whole Truth"" is just awful and ""Death Ship"" has serious logical inconsistencies",1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,4435,"['Whole', 'Truth', 'worst', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episode', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fundamentally', 'lame', 'example', 'political', 'propaganda', 'Harvey', 'Hunnicut', 'used-car', 'dealer', 'specialty', 'passing', 'off', 'clunkers', 'valued', 'transportation', 'devices', 'slick', 'talker', 'overwhelming', 'customers', 'praise', 'junk', 'confusing', 'endless', 'rapid', 'rhetoric', 'changes', 'when', 'very', 'old', 'car', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'parting', 'statement', 'car', 'time', 'sale', 'Hunnicut', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'always', 'uttering', 'truth', 'openly', 'telling', 'potential', 'customers', 'structural', 'flaws', 'wares', 'Given', 'only', 'junk', 'business', 'collapses', 'Finally', 'man', 'speaking', 'foreign', 'accent', 'offers', 'buy', 'vehicle', 'boss', 'episode', 'Soviet', 'Premier', 'Nikita', 'Khrushchev', 'new', 'owner', 'haunted', 'car.The', 'dialog', 'terrible', 'lighting', 'odd', 'making', 'scenes', 'appear', 'crude', 'political', 'message', 'so', 'incongruous', 'poorly', 'executed', 'was', 'just', 'glad', 'when', 'episode', 'ended', 'Death', 'Ship', 'very', 'weak', 'episode', 'Spaceship', 'E-89', 'Earth', 'searching', 'new', 'planets', 'colonize', 'ship', '13th', 'planet', 'system', '51', 'Lieutenant', 'Mason', 'Ross', 'Martin', 'spots', 'what', 'be', 'reflection', 'refined', 'metal', 'planet', 'otherwise', 'have', 'intelligent', 'life', 'enormous', 'contradiction', 'Captain', 'Ross', 'Jack', 'Klugman', 'orders', 'ship', 'landed', 'nearby', 'when', 'men', 'look', 'out', 'porthole', 'see', 'what', 'be', 'crashed', 'ship', 'Lieutenant', 'Carter', 'Frederick', 'Beir', 'third', 'member', 'crew', 'together', 'explore', 'crashed', 'ship', 'shock', 'find', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'bodies.This', 'meltdown', 'Carter', 'exhibiting', 'emotional', 'instability', 'Mason', 'together', 'more', 'Carter', 'too', 'unwind', 'Such', 'actions', 'are', 'examples', 'what', 'consider', 'one', 'worst', 'traits', 'television', 'science', 'fiction', 'when', 'astronauts', 'rapidly', 'exhibit', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'instability', 'ever', 'make', 'space', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'heavily', 'screened', 'repeatedly', 'demonstrate', 'highest', 'level', 'discipline', 'opinion', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'command', 'crew', 'Enterprise', 'never', 'panicked', 'wavered', 'even', 'when', 'appeared', 'destruction', 'was', 'imminent.Captain', 'Ross', 'personal', 'discipline', 'constantly', 'searching', 'rational', 'explanation', 'irrational', 'situation', 'are', 'creatures', 'planet', 'are', 'manipulating', 'minds', 'wrong', 'eventually', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'somehow', 'died', 'crash', 'none', 'have', 'memory', 'of.The', 'idea', 'being', 'helped', 'cope', 'death', 'deceased', 'loved', 'ones', 'immediately', 'die', 'compelling', 'one', 'case', 'oddly', 'presented', 'scenario', 'premise', 'memory', 'blacked', 'out', 'starting', 'right', 'death', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'up', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'have', 'died', 'relatives', 'encountered', 'act', 'also', 'know', 'nothing', 'deaths', 'well', 'subsequent', 'deceased', 'are', 'required', 'inform', 'previously', 'deceased', 'demise.An', 'essentially', 'immortal', 'creature', 'gains', 'eternal', 'life', 'sucking', 'life', 'force', 'youth', 'old', 'story', 'retold', 'Queen', 'Nile', 'Jordan', 'Herrick', 'journalist', 'covering', 'society', 'beat', 'astonished', 'when', 'longtime', 'starlet', 'Pamela', 'Morris', 'Even', 'been', 'making', 'movies', 'years', 'Morris', 'not', 'have', 'aged', 'date', 'warning', 'Morris', 'mother', 'further', 'research', 'Herrick', 'something', 'inaccurate', 'Morris', 'stated', 'age', 'learned', 'was', 'playing', 'theater', 'was', 'torn', 'down', 'decades', 'before.Even', 'warned', 'Herrick', 'curiosity', 'overpowering', 'question', 'Morris', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'be', 'undoing', 'Morris', 'far', 'far', 'older', 'more', 'resourceful', 'could', 'have', 'imagined.My', 'favorite', 'performance', 'episode', 'Celia', 'Lovsky', 'Morris', 'mother', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'dour', 'T', 'Pau', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Amok', 'Time', 'episode', 'good', 'also', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'sequence', 'was', 'clear', 'very', 'early', 'what', 'kind', 'creature', 'Morris', 'was']","Twilight Zone Collector's Edition (The Whole Truth, Death Ship, and Queen of the Nile)"

The statement on humanity or more correctly the human experience is what is important here. The fantasy element catapults the human element and it is absolutely effective. IN HIS IMAGE demonstrates how the Twilight Zone one-hour episodes had their advantage where good writing and well defined characters helped pushed the narative.THE MIRROR is a classic episode.NIGHTMARE AS A CHILD is one of my favorites. I like ""Nightnmare As a Child"" and always did. In fact there is indeed a nightmarish quality about it. I thought Janice Rule was excellent as the schoolteacher Helen Foley who is haunted by the recurring image of herself as a child. These things actually happen and as we get older we often think back to things back in our childhood half forgotten and sometimes half remembered. I thought this was one of Rod Serling's better scripts.",5,IN HIS IMAGE,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,954,"['IN', 'HIS', 'IMAGE', 'one', 'best', 'hour-long', 'episodes', '4th', 'season', 'starring', 'George', 'Grizzard', 'Good', 'acting', 'statement', 'humanity', 'more', 'correctly', 'human', 'experience', 'what', 'important', 'here', 'fantasy', 'element', 'catapults', 'human', 'element', 'absolutely', 'effective', 'IN', 'HIS', 'IMAGE', 'how', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'had', 'advantage', 'where', 'good', 'writing', 'well', 'defined', 'characters', 'helped', 'pushed', 'narative.THE', 'MIRROR', 'classic', 'episode.NIGHTMARE', 'CHILD', 'one', 'favorites', 'Nightnmare', 'Child', 'always', 'did', 'fact', 'indeed', 'nightmarish', 'quality', 'thought', 'Janice', 'Rule', 'was', 'excellent', 'schoolteacher', 'Helen', 'Foley', 'who', 'haunted', 'recurring', 'image', 'child', 'things', 'actually', 'happen', 'get', 'older', 'often', 'think', 'back', 'things', 'back', 'childhood', 'half', 'forgotten', 'sometimes', 'half', 'remembered', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'better', 'scripts']","Twilight Zone Collector's Edition (The Whole Truth, Death Ship, and Queen of the Nile)"
881729,A3V5JJF982NS48,B0007KUH24,"ricardo_guerrero ""ricardo_guerrero""","[0, 0]","This tape is one of my favorites - I didn't subscribe to the entire Columbia House VHS series back in the 90s.  This was the last tape I got.  ""In HIs Image"", the first of the 18 one-hour episodes, was probably the best of the 18.  Virtuosic writing, directing, acting, and production.  In the leads, Gail Kobe and George Grizzard are outstanding.  Absolutely stunning performances.  The episode reminds me of ""The After Hours"" by Serling, done 3 years earlier, in the sense that the set-up and tension are built layer by layer and then shockingly resolved at the conclusion.  With 30 additional minutes, there was a lot more time for the storyline to develop - and more story to develop - and this is the one of the few of the 18 episodes that succeeds on a great level.  Despite all of this, it is rarely discussed.  It's not anywhere near superclassic status, but should be.  The plot, in a nutshell, is about a man named Walter Ryder who constructs a duplicate of himself.  His duplicate, Alan Talbot, goes out into the world, and meets a girl and falls in love. Unfortunately, he realizes that he is seriously flawed and has no inhibitions - he is a murderer!  Charles Beaumont wrote the episode in 1962 based on his short story of the same title.  Beaumont was always my favorite TZ writer.  Perry Lafferty was the director and turned out a flawless product - undoubtedly one of the best of TZ episodes.  The other two episodes on this tape were lesser.  ""The Mirror"", starring Peter Falk, was a Rod Serling commentary about Fidel Castro.  The object of interest was a mirror.  It is a dark story with not much to recommend it.  ""Nightmare as a Child"" is an excellent episode from the first season by Serling.  Janice Rule and Shepperd Strudwick got star billing, but Terry Burnham was in fact the star.  The story involves schoolteacher Helen Foley (Rule) who comes home from school one day to find a cute 10 year old girl (Burnham) sitting on the steps outside her apartment.  Helen invites the girl in and moment by moment, Helen realizes that this child is someone she knew very well much earlier in life...the child is her. But how could it be?!  A question only to be answered in The Twilight Zone...and it got a very good answer.  Terry Burnham turns in an unforgettable performance that, lo these 55 years later, is still cherished by TZ fans.  Like the other two episodes on this tape, ""Nightmare as a Child"" isn't talked of much and has been endlessly criticized for being a pedestrian, ordinary situation that could take place at any time.  Indeed, the conclusion is weak, but as a whole, it is one of Rod's better episodes.  It's probably in my top 30, or 'short' favorite episode list.",5,It has one of the best - In His Image.,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,2704,"['tape', 'one', 'favorites', 'did', ""n't"", 'subscribe', 'entire', 'Columbia', 'House', 'VHS', 'series', 'back', '90s', 'was', 'last', 'tape', 'got', 'HIs', 'Image', 'first', '18', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'was', 'probably', 'best', '18', 'Virtuosic', 'writing', 'directing', 'acting', 'production', 'leads', 'Gail', 'Kobe', 'George', 'Grizzard', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Absolutely', 'stunning', 'performances', 'episode', 'Hours', 'Serling', 'done', '3', 'years', 'earlier', 'sense', 'set-up', 'tension', 'are', 'built', 'layer', 'layer', 'then', 'shockingly', 'resolved', 'conclusion', '30', 'additional', 'minutes', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'storyline', 'develop', 'more', 'story', 'develop', 'one', 'few', '18', 'episodes', 'great', 'level', 'rarely', 'discussed', 'not', 'anywhere', 'superclassic', 'status', 'should', 'be', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'man', 'named', 'Walter', 'Ryder', 'who', 'duplicate', 'duplicate', 'Alan', 'Talbot', 'out', 'world', 'girl', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'inhibitions', 'murderer', 'Charles', 'Beaumont', 'wrote', 'episode', '1962', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'title', 'Beaumont', 'was', 'always', 'favorite', 'TZ', 'writer', 'Perry', 'Lafferty', 'was', 'director', 'turned', 'out', 'flawless', 'product', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'best', 'TZ', 'episodes', 'other', 'two', 'episodes', 'tape', 'were', 'lesser', 'Mirror', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'was', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'commentary', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'object', 'interest', 'was', 'mirror', 'dark', 'story', 'not', 'much', 'recommend', 'Nightmare', 'Child', 'excellent', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'Serling', 'Janice', 'Rule', 'Shepperd', 'Strudwick', 'got', 'star', 'billing', 'Terry', 'Burnham', 'was', 'fact', 'star', 'story', 'schoolteacher', 'Helen', 'Foley', 'Rule', 'who', 'home', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'cute', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Burnham', 'sitting', 'steps', 'apartment', 'Helen', 'girl', 'moment', 'moment', 'Helen', 'child', 'someone', 'knew', 'very', 'well', 'much', 'earlier', 'life', 'child', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'question', 'only', 'be', 'answered', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'got', 'very', 'good', 'answer', 'Terry', 'Burnham', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'lo', '55', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'cherished', 'TZ', 'fans', 'other', 'two', 'episodes', 'tape', 'Nightmare', 'Child', ""n't"", 'talked', 'much', 'been', 'endlessly', 'criticized', 'being', 'pedestrian', 'ordinary', 'situation', 'could', 'take', 'place', 'time', 'Indeed', 'conclusion', 'weak', 'whole', 'one', 'Rod', 'better', 'episodes', 'probably', 'top', '30', 'favorite', 'episode', 'list']","Twilight Zone Collector's Edition (The Whole Truth, Death Ship, and Queen of the Nile)"
