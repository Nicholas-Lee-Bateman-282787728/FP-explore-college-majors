It's the coming of age story of four young men who graduate high school with plans on leaving town, a promise they made to each other that only one of the boys even wants to keep.  This causes problems for them, fights ensue and then there's a happy ending.  The problem is that getting to that happy ending is so boring.  Nothing happens that holds your interest.  I mean, I never really 'want' to turn off a movie, mostly so I can finish and write me opinion, but I was struggling to care about this movie.  The young actors are a good bunch, but the script they were given doesn't allow you to care much for them.

If it wasn't for the cast, which includes a good number of my  favorites, this film might have received one star from me and a much more  stinging review. There is no doubt that the relative slowness of the movie  was to paint a more accurate portrayal of small town life, but how does  that explain the poor dialogue? For someone who is about to move to LA I  never got much feeling of excitement from Breckin Meyer. The friend who's  father ran a ranch(can't remember his name) had a story which was very  poorly characterized.  Maybe it's me but this film nearly drove me to tears  it was so dull.

""Dancer, Texas"" stands or falls based on the four young men at its center, and all four of those actors turn in excellent and authentic performances.""Dancer, Texas"" doesn't fall into the typical Hollywood trap of overly-romanticizing the small town.  Dancer has its attractions, but the movie doesn't hesitate to show us the squalor just outside town (Squirrel's trailer), the lack of jobs, and even the lack of available women.  ""Dancer, Texas"" also doesn't fall into the other Hollywood trap of making every small Southern town a seething cauldron of barely-constrained violence.Neither those who stay nor those who leave are demonized or looked down upon.  It's just that living in Dancer agrees with some and not with others, which is a point one of the characters makes early in the movie.  That kind of tolerance is rare in mainstream movies, most of which really love or really hate the small town.I knocked off one star because there are a few points in the movie that become tedious and simply repeat things we already know or points that have already been made.

15649,ARPTJEKQNOBWJ,0767819624,lasher,"[8, 8]","This starts out so simply, but cuts to the heart of the American midwest, having spent my summers there as I child, I understand that mentality very well. My mother was born in a small town in New Mexico, and the people there have a wonderful, if simple charm to themselves. They are caring, yet ultimately unchanging, they can't possibly understand why anyone would want to leave a small town, very much as the townspeople in the movie were.The four main characters in this film were portrayed wonderfully, by Breckin Meyer(Keller), Peter Facinelli(Terrel Lee), Eddie Mills (John), and the ever charming Ethan Embry(Squirrel). The friendship they had felt real, as if they had really known each other their whole lives. When their oath to leave town after their High School Graduation begins to fall apart when Terrel Lee Announces he cannot leave his family behind, each member examines his reasons for leaving the small town of Dancer. Of course, the truly bright spot in the film is the incredible performance of Ashley Johnson who you might remember from Growing Pains as the youngest member Chrissy. She plays John's little sister, she is simply heart-felt and charming in this role, amazing you with her ability to speak about difficult subjects better than some adults I know. Of course, you can't leave out Patricia Wettig as Terrel Lee's tyrannical mother, even though she only makes about three appearances in the film, she fills the screen with her presence each time.All in all, this film is a well done venture. I recommend this film to anyone who comes from a small town, or would like to know what one is like, this is your best bet.

15650,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767819624,Matthew Horner,"[20, 21]","Those of us who did not grown up in or around a small town certainly know people who did. I, for example, have a cousin from Wartburg, Tennessee. I'm not sure exactly sure where it is, and I certainly can't figure out who gave it that name or why.Even before television turned the world into a fake global village, the majority of small town adolescents seem to have dreamed of moving to a big city. This yearning is the subject of the story in ""Dancer, Texas Pop. 81"". Its makers have an interesting point of view on a matter which movies have covered numerous times in the past.The film opens on the morning of Graduation Day at the local school. Four boys, who are members of the graduating senior class of five, are sitting in lawn chairs in the middle of the two-land road that goes past the town. At first, this seems to be both silly and dangerous. Then we learn that these lads are best friends who, years earlier, made a sacred vow to move to Los Angeles together the Monday after they finished high school. They even bought their bus tickets at the end of their sophomore year. The scene becomes a metaphor for the highway of life.The movie takes place over a three day period. There is not much of a plot. The only central question is which, if any, of the four will actually get on the bus come Monday. Writer and director Tim McCanlies presents us with vignettes which create four exceptionally strong character studies. In fact, all of the town's residents are shown to be unique individuals. You rarely see so many interesting people in one movie.Breckin Meyer, Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry and Eddie Mills, all relative newcomers, show great promise in portraying their characters. These are, respectively, Keller, Terrell Lee, Squirrel and John. Occasionally, Peter Facinelli slips out of character. When he does, it's a little too obvious he's a city boy playing at being one from the middle of nowhere. After all, Jeff Davis County, Texas, where the picture was made, is bigger than Rhode Island and has a lot more cows than people living on it.Is a place like Dancer really the middle of nowhere? That's the fundamental question McCanlies examines so thoroughly here. With brilliant assistance from cameraman Andrew Dintenfass, the country around the town is spectacularly photographed. There has to be more than scenery to make people live their whole lives in a place, but the visuals in the film help us to see that being nowhere is often a state of mind.""Dancer, Texas Pop. 81"" is as much a comedy as it is a drama. The humor is rarely aimed at people who live in isolated places, Much of it derives from the characters' keen observations on the hazards of living in huge cities, as well as from eccentricities which could exist in people living anywhere.The philosophy of the movie is probably best summed up in a scene where the four boys are sitting around a campfire. One of them wonders out loud how much they have missed by growing up in a place like Dancer, Texas. Another boy agrees that it's a good question, but then counters by asking what others might have missed by not growing up in such a place. McCanlies is happily neutral on the issue, allowing the film's viewers to decide such questions for themselves.",5,A great little movie,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3246,"['who', 'did', 'not', 'grown', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'certainly', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'example', 'have', 'cousin', 'Wartburg', 'Tennessee', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'sure', 'where', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'gave', 'name', 'why.Even', 'television', 'turned', 'world', 'fake', 'global', 'village', 'majority', 'small', 'town', 'adolescents', 'seem', 'have', 'dreamed', 'moving', 'big', 'city', 'yearning', 'subject', 'story', 'Dancer', 'Texas', 'Pop', '81', 'makers', 'have', 'interesting', 'point', 'view', 'matter', 'movies', 'have', 'covered', 'numerous', 'times', 'past.The', 'film', 'morning', 'Graduation', 'Day', 'local', 'school', 'Four', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'members', 'graduating', 'senior', 'class', 'five', 'are', 'sitting', 'lawn', 'chairs', 'middle', 'two-land', 'road', 'town', 'first', 'be', 'silly', 'dangerous', 'Then', 'learn', 'lads', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'years', 'earlier', 'made', 'sacred', 'vow', 'move', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'together', 'Monday', 'finished', 'high', 'school', 'even', 'bought', 'bus', 'tickets', 'end', 'sophomore', 'year', 'scene', 'metaphor', 'highway', 'life.The', 'movie', 'place', 'three', 'day', 'period', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'only', 'central', 'question', 'four', 'will', 'actually', 'get', 'bus', 'come', 'Monday', 'Writer', 'director', 'Tim', 'McCanlies', 'vignettes', 'create', 'four', 'exceptionally', 'strong', 'character', 'studies', 'fact', 'town', 'residents', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'unique', 'individuals', 'rarely', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'interesting', 'people', 'one', 'movie.Breckin', 'Meyer', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Eddie', 'Mills', 'relative', 'newcomers', 'show', 'great', 'promise', 'portraying', 'characters', 'are', 'respectively', 'Keller', 'Terrell', 'Lee', 'Squirrel', 'John', 'Occasionally', 'Peter', 'Facinelli', 'character', 'When', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'city', 'boy', 'playing', 'being', 'one', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Jeff', 'Davis', 'County', 'Texas', 'where', 'picture', 'was', 'made', 'bigger', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'lot', 'more', 'cows', 'people', 'living', 'it.Is', 'place', 'Dancer', 'really', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'fundamental', 'question', 'McCanlies', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'here', 'brilliant', 'assistance', 'cameraman', 'Andrew', 'Dintenfass', 'country', 'town', 'spectacularly', 'photographed', 'be', 'more', 'scenery', 'make', 'people', 'live', 'whole', 'lives', 'place', 'visuals', 'film', 'help', 'see', 'being', 'often', 'state', 'mind', 'Dancer', 'Texas', 'Pop', '81', 'as', 'much', 'comedy', 'drama', 'humor', 'rarely', 'aimed', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'isolated', 'places', 'Much', 'characters', 'keen', 'observations', 'hazards', 'living', 'huge', 'cities', 'as', 'well', 'eccentricities', 'could', 'exist', 'people', 'living', 'anywhere.The', 'philosophy', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'scene', 'where', 'four', 'boys', 'are', 'sitting', 'campfire', 'One', 'out', 'loud', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'missed', 'growing', 'up', 'place', 'Dancer', 'Texas', 'boy', 'good', 'question', 'then', 'counters', 'asking', 'what', 'others', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'not', 'growing', 'up', 'place', 'McCanlies', 'happily', 'neutral', 'issue', 'allowing', 'film', 'viewers', 'decide', 'such', 'questions']",N/A

One is orphaned and living with his grandfather, another is the  child of a life-long alcoholic, another the son of a rich oil man and  finally one that is the son of a rancher who intends to pass the business  off to his son.Different boys who become men, all with different  families, commitments and hopes that they must deal with. Going from a town  of 81 people to a town of 13 million seems exciting and overwhelming at the  same time and the four must face the fact that some may stay behind because  they want to and some might leave because they have to. It's nothing what  any of them had foreseen and it puts their friendship to the test.The  characters are real and if you've ever had friends that came from a small  town, these guys will remind you of their most endearing qualities. The  film doesn't put a stereotypical slant on these guys... they are educated  and plan on going to college. They've heard of the Internet and actually  know how to use a computer... they're not just riding broncos all day,  chewin' tobacco and leaning on fence posts... but they do have a different  perspective on life. They're less obsessed with &quot;things&quot; and more  interested in getting out of the small town to meet other people and see  how other folks live... and their friendship is the most important thing  they have, in or out of Dancer, TX.For those from big cities who might  read this review, I lived in Dallas for 30 years before moving to Denton, a  town of 80,000... don't be misled that only folks from tiny little towns  will be able to appreciate this film.My only negative comment would be  that the DVD is without any extras. No interviews, cast bios or behind the  scenes footage. How about interviews of some of the folks that actually  live in the town this was filmed in?  Word of mouth will continue to make  this film popular in the video market and not having extras on the DVD  makes it almost silly to have it on DVD to begin with.No nudity or foul  language, car explosions or light-sabre duels... this is a realistic  portrayal of real guys in a small town facing their families, their  friendships and their future. If you're into action-only films, this will  not satisfy, but rest assured this is not a coma-inducing film. It is  cerebral and touching and I highly recommend it.",5,"touches your heart, family safe",964828800,"07 29, 2000",2000,2478,"['Four', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'childhood', 'ponder', 'lifelong', 'promise', 'leave', 'remote', 'tiny', 'town', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'when', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'One', 'orphaned', 'living', 'grandfather', 'child', 'life-long', 'alcoholic', 'son', 'rich', 'oil', 'man', 'finally', 'one', 'son', 'rancher', 'who', 'pass', 'business', 'son.Different', 'boys', 'who', 'become', 'men', 'different', 'families', 'commitments', 'hopes', 'must', 'deal', 'Going', 'town', '81', 'people', 'town', '13', 'million', 'exciting', 'overwhelming', 'same', 'time', 'four', 'must', 'face', 'fact', 'may', 'stay', 'want', 'might', 'leave', 'have', 'nothing', 'what', 'had', 'foreseen', 'friendship', 'test.The', 'characters', 'are', 'real', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'friends', 'came', 'small', 'town', 'guys', 'will', 'remind', 'most', 'endearing', 'qualities', 'film', ""n't"", 'put', 'stereotypical', 'slant', 'guys', 'are', 'educated', 'plan', 'going', 'college', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Internet', 'actually', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'computer', ""'re"", 'not', 'just', 'riding', 'broncos', 'day', 'chewin', 'tobacco', 'leaning', 'fence', 'posts', 'do', 'have', 'different', 'perspective', 'life', ""'re"", 'less', 'obsessed', 'quot', 'things', 'quot', 'more', 'interested', 'getting', 'small', 'town', 'meet', 'other', 'people', 'see', 'how', 'other', 'folks', 'live', 'friendship', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'have', 'Dancer', 'TX.For', 'big', 'cities', 'who', 'might', 'read', 'review', 'lived', 'Dallas', '30', 'years', 'moving', 'Denton', 'town', '80,000', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'only', 'folks', 'tiny', 'little', 'towns', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'film.My', 'only', 'negative', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'DVD', 'extras', 'interviews', 'cast', 'bios', 'scenes', 'footage', 'How', 'interviews', 'folks', 'actually', 'live', 'town', 'was', 'filmed', 'Word', 'mouth', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'film', 'popular', 'video', 'market', 'not', 'having', 'extras', 'DVD', 'almost', 'silly', 'have', 'DVD', 'begin', 'with.No', 'nudity', 'foul', 'language', 'car', 'explosions', 'light-sabre', 'duels', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'real', 'guys', 'small', 'town', 'facing', 'families', 'friendships', 'future', ""'re"", 'action-only', 'films', 'will', 'not', 'satisfy', 'rest', 'assured', 'not', 'coma-inducing', 'film', 'cerebral', 'touching', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

It reminded me somewhat of a cross between a West Texas BREAKING AWAY  and a PG rated THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.  The movie centers on four young men who in their middle school years made a pact to leave their tiny town for LA the Monday after high school graduation and graduation weekend has arrived along with some doubts as to whether they all really want to or should leave town.  The four boys are all quite different and probably would not have become close friends if they had not grown up together as the only males in their class (the other classmate is female).  We quickly come to know and care about these young men as well as their families and the other townspeople.  The film has a lot of authentic small town touches from the FFA jacket, John who lives on a ranch wears, to the petty snobbery of Terrell Lee's mother who is probably neither as wealthy or as sophisticated as she likes to pretend.  Filmed on location in a small town (Dancer itself is fictional) in the Big Bend region of West Texas the movie surprisingly even contains some breathtaking scenery.  My main criticism of this well acted film is that a couple of the actors seem too old to be playing teenagers and the kids are almost too good and wholesome for believability.  I also had to suspend disbelief when the woman Squirrel's father picks up in a waffle house is so nice, pretty and eager to stay with Squirrel and his dad in their literally lopsided trailer.  Still this is a wonderful movie with great heart that will be enjoyed by many.",4,Their Last Sunset Together,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,1598,"['charming', 'film', 'also', 'inspirational', 'family', 'friendly', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'cross', 'West', 'Texas', 'BREAKING', 'AWAY', 'PG', 'rated', 'THE', 'LAST', 'PICTURE', 'SHOW', 'movie', 'centers', 'four', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'middle', 'school', 'years', 'made', 'pact', 'leave', 'tiny', 'town', 'LA', 'Monday', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'graduation', 'weekend', 'arrived', 'doubts', 'really', 'want', 'should', 'leave', 'town', 'four', 'boys', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'had', 'not', 'grown', 'up', 'together', 'only', 'males', 'class', 'other', 'classmate', 'female', 'quickly', 'come', 'know', 'care', 'young', 'men', 'as', 'well', 'families', 'other', 'townspeople', 'film', 'lot', 'authentic', 'small', 'town', 'touches', 'FFA', 'jacket', 'John', 'who', 'ranch', 'petty', 'snobbery', 'Terrell', 'Lee', 'mother', 'who', 'probably', 'wealthy', 'as', 'sophisticated', 'pretend', 'Filmed', 'location', 'small', 'town', 'Dancer', 'fictional', 'Big', 'Bend', 'region', 'West', 'Texas', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'main', 'criticism', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'couple', 'actors', 'seem', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'teenagers', 'kids', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'good', 'wholesome', 'believability', 'also', 'had', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'when', 'woman', 'Squirrel', 'father', 'up', 'waffle', 'house', 'so', 'nice', 'pretty', 'eager', 'stay', 'Squirrel', 'dad', 'literally', 'lopsided', 'trailer', 'Still', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'great', 'heart', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many']",N/A

I felt like I was peeking into the lives of real people with real challenges and authentic relationships. I think about this movie often and it has been over 10 years since I saw it last. My wife and I use some of the lines in our daily lives. ""Leave them fly bodies alone!"" The script is very good, the characters are real and the plot is very plausible. This movie sticks with you, not because of the big name stars (there are none), or grand production values, but because these characters become close to your heart and we care about their journey through one of life's biggest milestones: leaving/staying home after graduating.
